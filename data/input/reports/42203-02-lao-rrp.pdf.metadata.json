I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Northern  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will address sector constraints2 by rehabilitating existing irrigation \nfacilities and, where appropriate, developing new ones, as well as rehabilitating and upgrading \nrural access roads from district centers and kumban (village cluster) centers to villages. To \nenhance the impact of subproject investments, the project will support (i) technical extension \nservices to subproject beneficiaries, (ii) producer groups to coordinate supplies of agricultural \nproduce  to  markets  and/or  processors,  (iii)  contracted  agricultural  production  with  price \nincentives based on quality, and (iv) initiatives to secure tenure and access to land for sedentary \nagricultural production and land rezoning to protect the integrity of watersheds and reservoirs \nabove rehabilitated irrigation systems. This will contribute to improving agricultural productivity, \ndiversifying crops, and commercializing the low-performing agriculture sector in the northern \nregion. These investments will be complemented by (i) institutional capacity building for national, \nprovincial, and district agencies towards a sector development approach and (ii) heightened \nawareness  of  gender  issues  and  the  participation  of  local  communities  in  designing  and \nefficiently implementing about 25 subprojects.3 The proposed project will be implemented in the \nfour northern provinces of Bokeo, Luang Namtha, Oudomxay, and Phongsaly, which have a \ncombined population of 760,000 people, a third of whom are considered poor. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Lao PDR is steadily increasing its exposure to international markets and commercial \nopportunities and reducing its dependence on traditional subsistence agriculture and logging. Its \ncommitment  to  free  trade  and  an  improved  transport  network  is  transforming  the  northern \nregion\u2019s participation in the market economy, albeit from a low baseline. Its abundant land \nresources  and  high  agricultural  potential  have  recommended  the  Lao  PDR  to  neighboring \ncountries  as  a  potential  supplier of  agricultural  goods,  both  food  for  consumption  and  raw \nmaterials for agro-processing. The development of higher-capacity transport corridors linking the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and Thailand, as well as the smaller transport routes east to Viet \nNam, have enabled the supply of agricultural produce from northern Lao PDR to its neighbors. \n \n4.  A significant transport network of national and international routes has been developed. \nHowever, the coverage of rural access roads connecting these corridors is limited and generally \nof  poor  quality,  inflating  transport  costs  and  constraining  Lao  competitiveness  in  regional \nmarkets. The commercialization of agriculture is hampered not only by an underdeveloped rural \nroad  network  but  also  by  the  limited  opportunities  to  intensify  agricultural  production,  the \npredominant livelihood. The northern region is still dominated by subsistence production on \nlowland rain-fed and irrigated lands, as well as upland cropping on sloping lands, usually under \nsome form of shifting cultivation. In 2007, 60% of the rice area of 75,000 hectares in the four \ntargeted provinces was planted in bunded paddies, of which only 3% were irrigated. Production \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Analyzed in the Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n3  ADB project preparatory technical assistance No. 7362-LAO was approved on 2 October 2009 to design the project \nand support project implementation. ", "2 \nsystems use traditional varieties and few inputs because of limited access to higher-yielding \nvarieties,  irrigation,  or  other  production  inputs.  With  the  predominance  of  smallholder  and \ngeographically dispersed subsistence production, value addition and marketing are limited to \ndrying, packaging, and the small-scale production of items such as sauces and spices. The more \nsuitable agricultural areas, often located around district centers, have the greatest potential for \nhigher agricultural productivity, production surpluses, and increased participation in the market \neconomy. \n \n5.  The proposed project is to be implemented in four northern provinces of Bokeo, Luang \nNamtha, Oudomxay, and Phongsaly, where the average poverty rate is 37%, significantly higher \nthan the national average of 30%. Recent analysis indicated that poverty incidence has declined \nsince 1995 from a rate above 55%. The analysis found the greatest gains were achieved where \nthere are links to markets and infrastructure, and that poverty persists in remote northern upland \nareas where there is only limited road access. Moreover, 52% of the residents of the northern \nregion are ethnic minorities who have little opportunity to integrate into the market economy, \nwhich is an important cause of their high average poverty rate of 42%. The incidence of poverty \namong minorities is reported to have declined more slowly since 2005 than that of the dominant \nLao\u2013Thai. Poverty is a result of infrastructure deficit. \n \n6.  The proposed project will enhance rural inhabitants\u2019 access to and participation in the \nmarket economy to improve food security and livelihoods. The focus will be on the incremental \nproduction of commodities for which the Lao PDR has a comparative advantage in the region. \nEnhancing agricultural productivity on existing agricultural land is essential, as little suitable land \nexists for expanding agricultural area. While wet season rainfall is plentiful, it is highly seasonal, \nand  uncertainty  constrains  yields  and  limits  production  options.  Irrigation  holds  the  key  to \nremoving  the  risk  associated  with  rain-fed  agriculture,  enhances  productivity,  and  provides \noptions  for  diversifying  into  new  crops  with  more  potential  for  profit,  such  as  dry  season \nvegetables  and  melons.  Significant  potential  to  enhance  agricultural  productivity  exists  in \nrehabilitating small gravity irrigation systems to secure water supplies at the end of the wet \nseason and, where possible, provide for dry season cropping by retaining water in reservoirs. \nPotential exists to deliver more efficiently other yield-enhancing technological interventions. \n \n7.  Generating production surpluses can contribute little to production if access to markets is \nconstrained.  The  limited  and  unreliable  transport  network  and  constant  risk  of  landslides \nconstrain market access and limit production options to nonperishable goods. An improved road \nnetwork is a prerequisite to achieving market access for small, widely scattered production units. \nMoreover, it will facilitate private investment in value-addition through processing. A system by \nwhich agricultural products are aggregated, stored, handled, processed, and delivered to the \nmarket is a relatively new concept in northern Lao PDR but is gaining currency, fuelled by strong \ninterest in contract farming and foreign direct investment. \n \n8.  The proposed project will address the two fundamental constraints of low agricultural \nproductivity and limited market access.4 It will do so through investments in (i) rural infrastructure \nfor irrigation and rural access roads and (ii) initiatives to achieve greater commercialization in \nagriculture by exploiting opportunities in the Lao PDR and neighboring countries. \n \n                                                 \n4  A sector modality is proposed, as the Lao PDR has its Draft Strategy for Agricultural Development to 2020 to meet \nthe priority development needs of the sector. It has the institutional capacity to implement this sector development \nplan, following experience in four previous sector development projects financed by ADB. The policies applicable to \nthe agriculture sector are appropriate and will be improved through the proposed project. \n ", "3 \n9.  Project  objectives  are  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR  and  its  focus  on  rural  infrastructure  as  a  means  of \npromoting pro-poor, sustainable growth through private sector development, regional integration, \nand  transforming  agriculture  from  its  subsistence  orientation  into  a  diversified  sector  by \naddressing bottlenecks to agriculture commercialization. The proposed design draws on the \nexperience of recent rural development initiatives that ADB has financed, including the recently \ncompleted  Northern  Community  Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project  and  other  development \nprojects implemented in northern Lao PDR.5 Recent experiences and approaches found to be \nsuccessful in the Draft Sector Assistance Program Evaluation have guided the preparation of the \ndesign, in particular the need for advance action and the prescreening of eligible subprojects. \nThe proposed project is similarly consistent with the government\u2019s sector development objectives \nas presented in its Draft Strategy for Agricultural Development to 2020, which promotes the \nexpansion of market-oriented agricultural production in an environmentally sensitive manner. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved rural household incomes in the four northern provinces of \nBokeo, Luang Namtha, Oudomxay, and Phongsaly. The outcome will be increased agricultural \nproductivity in these project provinces. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The  four  main  outputs  are  (i)  productivity-enhancing  rural  infrastructure  constructed \nand/or rehabilitated; (ii) productivity- and impact-enhancing initiatives adopted; (iii) the capacity \nof  national,  provincial,  and  district  agencies  strengthened  to  enable  a  sector  development \napproach; and (iv) the efficient and effective delivery of subprojects and project management. \n \n12.  Output 1: Productivity and production-enhancing rural infrastructure constructed \nand/or rehabilitated. This output will include the rehabilitation and/or construction of small to \nmedium-scale gravity irrigation systems6 and the rehabilitation and/or upgrading of rural access \nroads.7 Subprojects have been identified by the provinces based on eligibility criteria and will \nhave been prescreened before grant effectiveness to ensure conformity with government and \nADB social and environmental safeguards. Subproject appraisal will ensure technical feasibility, \neconomic viability, consistency with overall project objectives, and strict adherence to the social \nand environmental safeguards of the government and ADB. The technical specifications of \nsubprojects will be scrutinized and approved by the line agency responsible with support from \ngrant implementation consultants to ensure conformity with established design standards in the \nLao PDR. Construction contracts will specify the preferential employment of local women and \nmen from poor households with equal pay for equal work, prohibiting construction camps. Local \nlabor will be mobilized through community mobilization to assist in detailed design through \nconsultation,  the  construction  of  on-farm  tertiary  canals,  and  the  routine  operation  and \nmaintenance of the infrastructure developed. \n \n13.  Output 2: Productivity- and impact-enhancing initiatives adopted. This output will \ninclude initiatives to enhance the impact and sustainability of investments in rural infrastructure. \n                                                 \n5  ADB 2004.Northern Community Managed Irrigation Sector Project, Manila. (Loan 2086-LAO, approved on 5 July \n2004). \n6  Small and medium-scale systems have command areas of 50\u2013200 hectares. \n7  Infrastructure investments will be restricted to Bokeo, Luang Namtha, and Phongsaly. In Oudomxay, only the \nassociated initiatives will be implemented to prepare this province for a firmly planned development initiative \nfinanced by the International Fund for Agricultural Development.  \n ", "4 \nIt is based on the extensive research carried out by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department \nthat confirms infrastructure as necessary but not sufficient for socioeconomic development.8 \nThese investments will be identified in a participatory and gender-sensitive manner from a list of \noptions9 and  developed  with  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries.  They  will  be  closely  linked  to \ninfrastructure investments and included in the investment costs for each subproject. Specific \nitems will be identified during feasibility studies and delivered through services contracted by the \nrelevant agency or competent entity. Capacity building will be an integral requirement of all \nactivities to ensure that women and vulnerable ethnic groups have the necessary skills to fully \nparticipate in and benefit from these activities. \n \n14.  Output 3: Capacity of national, provincial, and district agencies strengthened to \nenable  a  sector  development  approach. This output will build capacity in the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the implementation capacity of staff in the national project \nmanagement office (NPMO), provincial project offices (PPOs), and district coordination offices. \nNational initiatives will support the government\u2019s policy to establish a project management facility \ntoward implementing a sector development approach. This will include support for the nascent \nmonitoring and evaluation section in MAF\u2019s Department of Planning covering technical support \nfor  the  design  of  a  project  monitoring  and  information  system,  equipment  and  networking \nfacilities to link with participating districts, and training in management planning and performance \nmonitoring.  It  will  provide  resources  to  operate  a  system  for  monitoring  the  impact  of  the \nnumerous development projects and programs currently under implementation.10 The project will \nprovide resources to the National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute\u2019s Policy Research \nCenter to prepare studies to assist in policy development for the sector. In particular, the project \nwill  support  policy  research  studies  related  to  (i)  external  demand  for  land  for  agricultural \nproduction that effectively removes land from traditional shifting cultivation, (ii) the associated \nimpact on the livelihoods of smallholders, and (iii) approval mechanisms for private investors \nwho aim to undertake commercial activities in the provinces that inhibit their ability to compete \nwith similar enterprises in neighboring countries. In this regard, the proposed project will link with \nthe ADB-financed Greater Mekong Subregion trade initiatives currently planned for Boten, on the \nborder with the People\u2019s Republic of China, that are intended to reform superfluous sanitary and \nphyto-sanitary constraints associated with border closure for trade in agricultural commodities.11 \n \n15.  To ensure the efficient and effective implementation of sector projects, NPMO, PPO, and \ndistrict coordination office staff need capacity building in project administration, procurement, \nfinancial  management,  progress  reporting,  impact  monitoring,  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards, and contract management. The project will engage existing provincial and district \npersonnel, strengthen their capacity, and familiarize them with ADB and government procedures \nto ensure the smooth implementation of this project and future sector development initiatives. \n \n16.  Output 4: Efficient and effective delivery of subprojects and project management. \nProject management will be supervised by the NPMO in Vientiane and implemented by PPOs \n                                                 \n8 X.

This recognizes limited implementation capacity and a general lack of familiarity \nwith ADB procedures, particularly among provincial and district staff. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $24.6 million (Table 1). \n \n18.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $23 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project. This will be used for infrastructure subprojects and \ntheir associated initiatives, capacity building, project management and consulting services, and \ntaxes and duties. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

The government will finance the equivalent of $1.17 million for staff secondment to assist \nwith subproject implementation and for land acquisition and compensation under subproject \nresettlement  plans.  Beneficiaries  will  contribute  labor  estimated  at  $0.46  million  to  the \ndevelopment of tertiary, on-farm irrigation structures and to the routine maintenance costs of \nroad and irrigation infrastructure (Table 2). \n                                                 \n12  A formal PPO will not be established in Oudomxay, but resources will be provided to its PAFO to manage, \nimplement, and monitor associated initiatives. \n ", "6 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  23.00    93.4 \nGovernment  1.17    4.8 \nBeneficiaries  0.46    1.8 \n  Total    24.63    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The executing agency will be MAF, which will delegate responsibility for overall project \nmanagement and coordination to its Department of Planning, under which an NPMO will be \nestablished and led by a full-time national project coordinator responsible for the day-to-day \nimplementation of activities nationally. PAFOs will be the implementing agencies and establish \ntheir  own  PPOs  to  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  and  management  of \nsubprojects.13 To  assist  with  implementation  in  districts,  district  coordination  offices  will  be \nestablished  in  participating  district  agriculture  and  forestry  offices.  National  and  provincial \nsteering  committees  will  be  established  to  provide  overall  guidance  and  interagency \ncoordination. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the project administration manual (Appendix 2). \n \nTable 3: Summary Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2011\u2013February 2017 (6 years) \nEstimated project completion date  February 2017 \nProject Management \n(i)  Oversight body  Vice minister, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; chairperson, national \nproject steering committee with national agency and provincial representation. \nDeputy governors of participating provinces as chairpersons of provincial \nsteering committees with provincial agency representation and district \ngovernors from participating districts. \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, NPMO. \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Provincial agriculture and forestry offices, PPOs in participating provinces. \n(iv)  Project implementation unit  NPMO (15 staff) and PPOs (11 staff in each). \nProcurement  (only ADB-financed  ICB  None   \ngoods and works)  NCB  Multiple contracts  $12.9 million \nShopping  Multiple contracts    $0.8 million \nConsulting services (only ADB- CQS  10    $1.7 million \nfinanced consulting services)  QCBS  309 person-months    $3.77 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting is requested for the recruitment of grant implementation \nconsultants. \nDisbursement  Grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualifications selection, NPMO = national project management \noffice, ICB= international competitive bidding, NCB = national competitive bidding, PPO = provincial project office, \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n13  In the three provinces of Bokeo, Luang Namtha and Phongsaly.

All subprojects eligible for financing under the project will be prescreened before grant \neffectiveness  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  and  Lao  PDR  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards. Irrigation systems will be simple water-management structures based on established \ndesigns  and  standards  developed  under  the  ADB-financed  Northern  Community  Managed \nIrrigation Sector Project (footnote 5). For rural access roads, rehabilitation will follow existing \nalignments and improve surface drainage. Most alignments identified in subprojects proposed by \nparticipating provinces follow relatively flat terrain, reducing the requirement for complex bank \nstabilization with extensive cut and fill. In view of the harsh climatic and topographic conditions \nand  budgetary  constraints  in  the  provinces,  priority  will  be  given  to  rehabilitating  those \nalignments that can demonstrate an economic net benefit from sealed surfaces to ensure the \nsustainability of benefits and minimize maintenance requirements. Maintenance will be financed \nby beneficiary contributions for such labor-intensive tasks as trimming vegetation and filling \npotholes, while grant funds will enable district and provincial authorities to use heavier equipment \nfor  more  significant  repairs.  Resources  to  improve  rural  roads  will  target  the  most  critical \nobstacles to access. Improvements will follow existing alignments using Ministry of Public Works \nand Transport geometric design classes as appropriate. Special attention will focus on the \ndesign  of  sustainable  road  drainage  (surface,  side,  and  cross)  and  the  use  of  appropriate \nsurfacing and paving options to carry projected traffic loads. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Direct  benefits  from  rehabilitating  irrigation  and  rural  access  roads  are  increased \nagricultural  productivity  and  reduced  travel  costs  and  times.  Indirect  benefits  include  the \ndiversification of sources of income and market-oriented agricultural outputs, increased value-\naddition, improved access to health and education services, and reduced costs for agricultural \ninputs and household commodities. Together, the benefits will reduce poverty in beneficiary \ncommunities. Subprojects will focus on enhancing market integration through rural infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  associated  investments  in  technical  extension  services,  strengthening \nproducer  organizations,  and  improving  the  supply  of  inputs.  All  anticipated  benefits  are \nincremental compared with the without-project scenario, in which competition for agricultural land \nis expected to remain high, the social and environmental consequences of existing practices to \nintensify, and economic returns to worsen.14 \n \n23.  The economic analysis of the Nam Haad Irrigation Rehabilitation Subproject in Bokeo \nindicates an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 15.6% based on quantified benefits from \nincreased agricultural productivity for wet season crops plus opportunities for increased cropping \nintensity with some dry season irrigation and quality enhancement through extension initiatives. \nIt  is estimated  that  annual  paddy  output  will  increase  from  360  tons  in  the  without-project \nscenario to 654 tons in the with-project scenario, generating an increment of 294 tons per year. \nGross economic crop production value will increase from KN988 million in the without-project \nscenario to KN1,749 million in the with-project scenario\u2014an increment of KN762 million per \nyear. The net economic value of crop production (i.e., net of all material and labor costs) will \nincrease  from  KN349  million  to  KN963  million  per  year\u2014an  increment  of  KN614  million. \nIncremental net crop financial value of production per household is estimated at KN2.2 million \nper year, for an increase of 176%. The poor, or 45% of the beneficiary population, are expected \nto  get  an  increase  in  net  annual  crop  financial  value  of  KN1.1  million  per  household.  In \n                                                 \n14  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \naggregate, 25% of the net crop benefits from subprojects are likely to go to the poor. Estimates \nfrom the economic analyses of representative rural access road and irrigation rehabilitation \nsubprojects in Phongsaly and Luang Namtha indicate EIRRs in the range of 14%\u201315.5% based \non quantifiable benefits. \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  All procurement to be financed by the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).15 MAF shall ensure that \nall accounts administered by the NPMO and PPOs are consolidated and audited annually by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. The capacity-building component will strengthen the capacity of \nNPMO and PPO staff in financial management procedures to allow the efficient operation of \nadvance accounts and reporting of financial performance to the government and ADB. The \nimplementation of the project will be consistent with the government\u2019s requirement for national \ncoordination.  Provincial  implementation  will  seek  the  involvement  of  district  and  lower \nadministrative units and communities to ensure their participation in monitoring design and \nconstruction, as was done under the successful Northern Community Managed Irrigation Sector \nProject (footnote 5). Coordination with other agencies will be achieved through their participation \nin the national and provincial project steering committees to achieve the necessary technical \nsupport. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MAF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual and will be posted on the project website. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The proposed project will be implemented in northern rural Lao PDR, where the average \npoverty rate is 37%.16 The analysis of declines in poverty rates since the mid 1990s show the \ngreatest  gains  achieved  where  there  are  links  to  markets  and  infrastructure,  with  poverty \npersisting  in  remote  upland  areas  of  the  north  that  lack  road  access.  Ethnicity  is  also  a \ndeterminant of poverty, as ethnic minority groups have poverty rates above 42% and have \nrecorded a slower decline in the incidence of poverty since 2005 than that seen in the dominant \nLao\u2013Thai. Most subprojects will be implemented in areas where ethnic groups constitute a \nmajority and where poverty tends to be more pervasive than the national average. Investments \nin irrigation rehabilitation will improve the incomes and food security of households and, through \nassociated initiatives, provide opportunities for women and men to build their capacity17. The \nproject will provide resources for implementing subproject gender action plans and indigenous \npeople\u2019s plans. Women and children will benefit from reduced time spent collecting water. As \nwomen  are  greatly  underrepresented  in  village  and  community  decision-making  institutions, \nthere will be specific interventions to increase their involvement in producer and water user \ngroups. Vulnerable groups, mainly ethnic minorities and households headed by females, will \nenjoy preferential opportunities for construction employment. Intensified agricultural activity will \nincrease demand for labor. Investments in rural access roads will improve access to public \nservices  and  options  for  commercial  enterprises  and  marketing.  Through  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure and road access, the proposed project is anticipated to contribute to improved \n                                                 \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Ministry of Planning and Investment, Department of Statistics. 2010.

The benefits from improved access \ndirectly affect household incomes and facilitate access to health and education services. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Resettlement. Little resettlement is anticipated as subprojects will rehabilitate existing \ninfrastructure and require insignificant land acquisition. Further, subprojects will be prescreened \nbefore grant effectiveness to ensure they do not entail significant resettlement.18 Only category B \nand  C  subprojects  will  be  eligible  for  financing  under  the  proposed  project.  Any  minor \ncompensation  that  may  be  needed  will  be  provided  in  accordance  with  resettlement  plans \nprepared for each subproject based on the guidelines outlined in the resettlement framework \nagreed with the government19. The project is categorized as B for involuntary resettlement. \n \n28.  Environmental. Prescreening aims to ensure that subprojects considered for financing \nwill not have significant negative environmental impacts and that minor impacts can be mitigated \nthrough the implementation of the subproject environmental management plans prepared as part \nof each initial environmental examination.20 In the case of rural access road rehabilitation and \nupgrading, subprojects are limited to existing alignments and will most likely involve limited cut \nand fill, minor widening, and little realignment. For irrigation rehabilitation and development, \nfeasibility studies will ensure that water off-take during the dry season allows sufficient flows to \nmaintain the riparian ecosystem and ensure adequate resources for downstream users. The \nintroduction of land zoning in the catchment areas of reservoirs will minimize inappropriate land \nuse and reduce the risk of siltation while assuring dry season flows. Environment category A \nsubprojects will be ineligible for financing under the proposed project. Technical specialists will \nprepare national and provincial environmental assessments and management plans for each \nsubproject. The project is categorized as B for environmental safeguard. \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. The otherwise dominant Lao\u2013Thai ethnic group is a minority in \neach of the four target provinces, where the main ethnic groups are Mon-Khmer in Bokeo and \nOudomxay and Chine-Tibet in Luang Namtha and Phongsaly. The principles followed in all \nsubproject preparation will be consultation, inclusion, and preferential access to employment \nopportunities for vulnerable ethnic minority groups. As with socioeconomic baseline surveys, all \ndata collected will be disaggregated by ethno-linguistic group, age (where appropriate), and \ngender to allow the monitoring and evaluation of beneficiary inclusion. The proposed project is \ncategory B for indigenous peoples because (i) most people in the four provinces are ethnic \nminorities who generally have higher poverty rates than the nationally dominant Lao\u2013Thai group \nand (ii) impacts are expected to be positive. The prescreening of subprojects and consultation \nprocesses will exclude subprojects that would disadvantage any groups. Indigenous peoples \nplans for each approved subproject will detail requirements for inclusion, benefit measuring, and \nmonitoring21. The project is categorized as B for indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  The integrated benefits and impacts of the proposed project are expected to outweigh the \ncosts. The major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n \n                                                 \n18  Based on feasibility studies of representative subprojects and initial prescreening, the total cost of land acquisition \nand resettlement is estimated to be $268,000, or 2% of civil works costs. \n19 Resettlement Framework is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n20 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n21 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nEconomic development  Subprojects will be prescreened to ensure technical and prima facie economic \npotential in subproject  viability during preparation.
