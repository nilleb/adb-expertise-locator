To \nenhance  the  impact  of  subproject  investments,  the  project  will  support  (i)  technical  extension \nservices  to  subproject  beneficiaries,  (ii)  producer  groups  to  coordinate  supplies  of  agricultural \nproduce  to  markets  and/or  processors,  (iii)  contracted  agricultural  production  with  price \nincentives based on quality, and (iv) initiatives to secure tenure and access to land for sedentary \nagricultural  production  and  land  rezoning  to  protect  the  integrity  of  watersheds  and  reservoirs \nabove  rehabilitated  irrigation  systems.  This  will  contribute  to  improving  agricultural  productivity, \ndiversifying  crops,  and  commercializing  the  low-performing  agriculture  sector  in  the  northern \nregion. These investments will be complemented by (i) institutional capacity building for national, \nprovincial,  and  district  agencies  towards  a  sector  development  approach  and  (ii)  heightened \nawareness  of  gender  issues  and  the  participation  of  local  communities  in  designing  and \nefficiently implementing about 25 subprojects.3 The proposed project will be implemented in the \nfour  northern  provinces  of  Bokeo,  Luang  Namtha,  Oudomxay,  and  Phongsaly,  which  have  a \ncombined population of 760,000 people, a third of whom are considered poor. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe Lao PDR is steadily increasing its exposure to international markets and commercial \nopportunities and reducing its dependence on traditional subsistence agriculture and logging. Its \ncommitment  to  free  trade  and  an  improved  transport  network  is  transforming  the  northern \nregion\u2019s  participation  in  the  market  economy,  albeit  from  a  low  baseline.  Its  abundant  land \nresources  and  high  agricultural  potential  have  recommended  the  Lao  PDR  to  neighboring \ncountries  as  a  potential  supplier  of  agricultural  goods,  both  food  for  consumption  and  raw \nmaterials for agro-processing. The development of higher-capacity transport corridors linking the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Thailand,  as  well  as  the  smaller  transport  routes  east  to  Viet \nNam, have enabled the supply of agricultural produce from northern Lao PDR to its neighbors. \n \n4. \nA significant transport network of national and international routes has been developed. \nHowever, the coverage of rural access roads connecting these corridors is limited and generally \nof  poor  quality,  inflating  transport  costs  and  constraining  Lao  competitiveness  in  regional \nmarkets. The commercialization of agriculture is hampered not only by an underdeveloped rural \nroad  network  but  also  by  the  limited  opportunities  to  intensify  agricultural  production,  the \npredominant  livelihood.  The  northern  region  is  still  dominated  by  subsistence  production  on \nlowland rain-fed and irrigated lands, as well as upland cropping on sloping lands, usually under \nsome  form  of  shifting  cultivation.  In  2007,  60%  of  the  rice  area  of  75,000  hectares  in  the  four \ntargeted provinces was planted in bunded paddies, of which only 3% were irrigated. Production \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Analyzed  in  the  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Agriculture  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n3   ADB project preparatory technical assistance No. 7362-LAO was approved on 2 October 2009 to design the project \n\nAppendix 2). \n\nand support project implementation. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nsystems  use  traditional  varieties  and  few  inputs  because  of  limited  access  to  higher-yielding \nvarieties,  irrigation,  or  other  production  inputs.  With  the  predominance  of  smallholder  and \ngeographically  dispersed  subsistence  production,  value  addition  and  marketing  are  limited  to \ndrying, packaging, and the small-scale production of items such as sauces and spices. The more \nsuitable  agricultural  areas,  often  located  around  district  centers,  have  the  greatest  potential  for \nhigher  agricultural  productivity,  production  surpluses,  and  increased  participation  in  the  market \neconomy. \n \nThe  proposed  project  is  to  be  implemented  in  four  northern  provinces  of  Bokeo,  Luang \n5. \nNamtha, Oudomxay, and Phongsaly, where the average poverty rate is 37%, significantly higher \nthan the national average of 30%. Recent analysis indicated that poverty incidence has declined \nsince 1995 from a rate above 55%. The analysis found the greatest gains were achieved where \nthere are links to markets and infrastructure, and that poverty persists in remote northern upland \nareas  where  there  is  only  limited  road  access.  Moreover,  52%  of  the  residents  of  the  northern \nregion  are  ethnic  minorities  who  have  little  opportunity  to  integrate  into  the  market  economy, \nwhich is an important cause of their high average poverty rate of 42%. The incidence of poverty \namong minorities is reported to have declined more slowly since 2005 than that of the dominant \nLao\u2013Thai. Poverty is a result of infrastructure deficit. \n \n6. \nThe  proposed  project  will  enhance  rural  inhabitants\u2019  access  to  and  participation  in  the \nmarket economy to improve food security and livelihoods. The focus will be on the incremental \nproduction of  commodities  for  which  the  Lao  PDR  has  a  comparative  advantage  in  the  region. \nEnhancing agricultural productivity on existing agricultural land is essential, as little suitable land \nexists for expanding agricultural area. While wet season rainfall is plentiful, it is highly seasonal, \nand  uncertainty  constrains  yields  and  limits  production  options.  Irrigation  holds  the  key  to \nremoving  the  risk  associated  with  rain-fed  agriculture,  enhances  productivity,  and  provides \noptions  for  diversifying  into  new  crops  with  more  potential  for  profit,  such  as  dry  season \nvegetables  and  melons.  Significant  potential  to  enhance  agricultural  productivity  exists  in \nrehabilitating  small  gravity  irrigation  systems  to  secure  water  supplies  at  the  end  of  the  wet \nseason  and,  where  possible,  provide  for  dry  season  cropping  by  retaining  water  in  reservoirs. \nPotential exists to deliver more efficiently other yield-enhancing technological interventions. \n \nGenerating production surpluses can contribute little to production if access to markets is \n7. \nconstrained.  The  limited  and  unreliable  transport  network  and  constant  risk  of  landslides \nconstrain market access and limit production options to nonperishable goods. An improved road \nnetwork is a prerequisite to achieving market access for small, widely scattered production units. \nMoreover,  it  will  facilitate  private  investment in  value-addition  through  processing. A  system  by \nwhich  agricultural  products  are  aggregated,  stored,  handled,  processed,  and  delivered  to  the \nmarket is a relatively new concept in northern Lao PDR but is gaining currency, fuelled by strong \ninterest in contract farming and foreign direct investment. \n \n8. \nThe  proposed  project  will  address  the  two  fundamental  constraints  of  low  agricultural \nproductivity and limited market access.4 It will do so through investments in (i) rural infrastructure \nfor  irrigation  and  rural  access  roads  and  (ii)  initiatives  to  achieve  greater  commercialization  in \nagriculture by exploiting opportunities in the Lao PDR and neighboring countries. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   A sector modality is proposed, as the Lao PDR has its Draft Strategy for Agricultural Development to 2020 to meet \nthe priority development needs of the sector. It has the institutional capacity to implement this sector development \nplan, following experience in four previous sector development projects financed by ADB. The policies applicable to \nthe agriculture sector are appropriate and will be improved through the proposed project. \n\n\fProject  objectives  are  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \n9. \npartnership  strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR  and  its  focus  on  rural  infrastructure  as  a  means  of \npromoting pro-poor, sustainable growth through private sector development, regional integration, \nand  transforming  agriculture  from  its  subsistence  orientation  into  a  diversified  sector  by \naddressing  bottlenecks  to  agriculture  commercialization.  The  proposed  design  draws  on  the \nexperience of recent rural development initiatives that ADB has financed, including the recently \ncompleted  Northern  Community  Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project  and  other  development \nprojects  implemented  in  northern  Lao  PDR.5 Recent  experiences  and  approaches  found  to  be \nsuccessful in the Draft Sector Assistance Program Evaluation have guided the preparation of the \ndesign,  in  particular  the  need  for  advance  action  and  the  prescreening  of  eligible  subprojects. \nThe proposed project is similarly consistent with the government\u2019s sector development objectives \nas  presented  in  its  Draft  Strategy  for  Agricultural  Development  to  2020,  which  promotes  the \nexpansion of market-oriented agricultural production in an environmentally sensitive manner. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  improved  rural  household  incomes  in  the  four  northern  provinces  of \n10. \nBokeo,  Luang  Namtha,  Oudomxay,  and  Phongsaly.  The  outcome  will be  increased  agricultural \nproductivity in these project provinces. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe  four  main  outputs  are  (i)  productivity-enhancing  rural  infrastructure  constructed \nand/or  rehabilitated;  (ii)  productivity-  and  impact-enhancing  initiatives  adopted;  (iii)  the  capacity \nof  national,  provincial,  and  district  agencies  strengthened  to  enable  a  sector  development \napproach; and (iv) the efficient and effective delivery of subprojects and project management. \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Productivity  and  production-enhancing  rural  infrastructure  constructed \nand/or  rehabilitated.  This  output  will  include  the  rehabilitation  and/or  construction  of  small  to \nmedium-scale gravity irrigation systems6 and the rehabilitation and/or upgrading of rural access \nroads.7 Subprojects  have  been  identified  by  the  provinces  based  on  eligibility  criteria  and  will \nhave  been  prescreened  before  grant  effectiveness  to  ensure  conformity  with  government  and \nADB social and environmental safeguards. Subproject appraisal will ensure technical feasibility, \neconomic viability, consistency with overall project objectives, and strict adherence to the social \nand  environmental  safeguards  of  the  government  and  ADB.  The  technical  specifications  of \nsubprojects  will  be  scrutinized  and  approved  by  the  line  agency  responsible  with  support  from \ngrant implementation consultants to ensure conformity with established design standards in the \nLao  PDR.  Construction  contracts  will  specify  the  preferential  employment  of  local  women  and \nmen from poor households with equal pay for equal work, prohibiting construction camps. Local \nlabor  will  be  mobilized  through  community  mobilization  to  assist  in  detailed  design  through \nconsultation,  the  construction  of  on-farm  tertiary  canals,  and  the  routine  operation  and \nmaintenance of the infrastructure developed. \n \n13. \nOutput  2:  Productivity-  and  impact-enhancing  initiatives  adopted.  This  output  will \ninclude initiatives to enhance the impact and sustainability of investments in rural infrastructure. \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB  2004.Northern  Community  Managed  Irrigation  Sector  Project,  Manila.  (Loan  2086-LAO,  approved  on  5  July \n\n2004). \n\n6   Small and medium-scale systems have command areas of 50\u2013200 hectares. \n7   Infrastructure  investments  will  be  restricted  to  Bokeo,  Luang  Namtha,  and  Phongsaly.  In  Oudomxay,  only  the \nassociated  initiatives  will  be  implemented  to  prepare  this  province  for  a  firmly  planned  development  initiative \nfinanced by the International Fund for Agricultural Development.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nIt is based on the extensive research carried out by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department \nthat  confirms  infrastructure  as  necessary  but  not  sufficient  for  socioeconomic  development. 8 \nThese investments will be identified in a participatory and gender-sensitive manner from a list of \noptions 9  and  developed  with  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries.  They  will  be  closely  linked  to \ninfrastructure  investments  and  included  in  the  investment  costs  for  each  subproject.  Specific \nitems will be identified during feasibility studies and delivered through services contracted by the \nrelevant  agency  or  competent  entity.  Capacity  building  will  be  an  integral  requirement  of  all \nactivities  to ensure  that women  and  vulnerable  ethnic  groups  have  the  necessary  skills  to  fully \nparticipate in and benefit from these activities. \n \n14. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  of  national,  provincial,  and  district  agencies  strengthened  to \nenable  a  sector  development  approach.  This  output  will  build  capacity  in  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  and  the  implementation  capacity  of  staff  in  the  national  project \nmanagement  office  (NPMO),  provincial  project  offices  (PPOs),  and  district  coordination  offices. \nNational initiatives will support the government\u2019s policy to establish a project management facility \ntoward  implementing  a  sector  development  approach.  This  will  include  support  for  the  nascent \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  section  in  MAF\u2019s  Department  of  Planning  covering  technical support \nfor  the  design  of  a  project  monitoring  and  information  system,  equipment  and  networking \nfacilities to link with participating districts, and training in management planning and performance \nmonitoring.  It  will  provide  resources  to  operate  a  system  for  monitoring  the  impact  of  the \nnumerous development projects and programs currently under implementation.10 The project will \nprovide resources to the National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute\u2019s Policy Research \nCenter to prepare studies to assist in policy development for the sector. In particular, the project \nwill  support  policy  research  studies  related  to  (i)  external  demand  for  land  for  agricultural \nproduction  that  effectively  removes  land  from  traditional  shifting  cultivation,  (ii)  the  associated \nimpact  on  the  livelihoods  of  smallholders,  and  (iii)  approval  mechanisms  for  private  investors \nwho aim to  undertake commercial activities in the provinces that inhibit their ability to compete \nwith similar enterprises in neighboring countries. In this regard, the proposed project will link with \nthe ADB-financed Greater Mekong Subregion trade initiatives currently planned for Boten, on the \nborder with the People\u2019s Republic of China, that are intended to reform superfluous sanitary and \nphyto-sanitary constraints associated with border closure for trade in agricultural commodities.11 \n \nTo ensure the efficient and effective implementation of sector projects, NPMO, PPO, and \n15. \ndistrict  coordination  office  staff  need  capacity  building  in  project  administration,  procurement, \nfinancial  management,  progress  reporting,  impact  monitoring,  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards,  and  contract  management.  The  project  will  engage  existing  provincial  and  district \npersonnel, strengthen their capacity, and familiarize them with ADB and government procedures \nto ensure the smooth implementation of this project and future sector development initiatives. \n \n16. \nOutput 4: Efficient and effective delivery of subprojects and project management. \nProject  management  will  be  supervised  by  the  NPMO  in  Vientiane  and  implemented  by  PPOs \n\n                                                 \n8 X.

Irrigation systems will be simple water-management structures based on established \ndesigns  and  standards  developed  under  the  ADB-financed  Northern  Community  Managed \nIrrigation  Sector  Project  (footnote  5).  For  rural  access  roads,  rehabilitation  will  follow  existing \nalignments and improve surface drainage. Most alignments identified in subprojects proposed by \nparticipating  provinces  follow  relatively  flat  terrain,  reducing  the  requirement  for  complex  bank \nstabilization with extensive cut and fill. In view of the harsh climatic and topographic conditions \nand  budgetary  constraints  in  the  provinces,  priority  will  be  given  to  rehabilitating  those \nalignments  that  can  demonstrate  an  economic  net  benefit  from  sealed  surfaces  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of benefits and minimize maintenance requirements. Maintenance will be financed \nby  beneficiary  contributions  for  such  labor-intensive  tasks  as  trimming  vegetation  and  filling \npotholes, while grant funds will enable district and provincial authorities to use heavier equipment \nfor  more  significant  repairs.  Resources  to  improve  rural  roads  will  target  the  most  critical \nobstacles to access. Improvements will follow existing alignments using Ministry of Public Works \nand  Transport  geometric  design  classes  as  appropriate.  Special  attention  will  focus  on  the \ndesign  of  sustainable  road  drainage  (surface,  side,  and  cross)  and  the  use  of  appropriate \nsurfacing and paving options to carry projected traffic loads. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nDirect  benefits  from  rehabilitating  irrigation  and  rural  access  roads  are  increased \nagricultural  productivity  and  reduced  travel  costs  and  times.  Indirect  benefits  include  the \ndiversification  of  sources  of  income  and  market-oriented  agricultural  outputs,  increased  value-\naddition,  improved  access  to  health  and  education  services,  and  reduced  costs  for  agricultural \ninputs  and  household  commodities.  Together,  the  benefits  will  reduce  poverty  in  beneficiary \ncommunities. Subprojects will focus on enhancing market integration through rural infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  associated  investments  in  technical  extension  services,  strengthening \nproducer  organizations,  and  improving  the  supply  of  inputs.  All  anticipated  benefits  are \nincremental compared with the without-project scenario, in which competition for agricultural land \nis expected to remain high, the social and environmental consequences of existing practices to \nintensify, and economic returns to worsen.14 \n \n23. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Nam  Haad  Irrigation  Rehabilitation  Subproject  in  Bokeo \nindicates an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 15.6% based on quantified benefits from \nincreased agricultural productivity for wet season crops plus opportunities for increased cropping \nintensity with some dry season irrigation and quality enhancement through extension initiatives. \nIt  is  estimated  that  annual  paddy  output  will  increase  from  360  tons  in  the  without-project \nscenario to 654 tons in the with-project scenario, generating an increment of 294 tons per year. \nGross  economic  crop  production  value  will  increase  from  KN988  million  in  the  without-project \nscenario  to  KN1,749  million  in  the  with-project  scenario\u2014an  increment  of  KN762  million  per \nyear.  The  net  economic  value  of  crop  production  (i.e.,  net  of  all  material  and  labor  costs)  will \nincrease  from  KN349  million  to  KN963  million  per  year\u2014an  increment  of  KN614  million. \nIncremental  net  crop  financial  value  of  production  per  household  is  estimated  at  KN2.2  million \nper year, for an increase of 176%. The poor, or 45% of the beneficiary population, are expected \nto  get  an  increase  in  net  annual  crop  financial  value  of  KN1.1  million  per  household.  In \n                                                 \n14  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\naggregate, 25% of the net crop benefits from subprojects are likely to go to the poor. Estimates \nfrom  the  economic  analyses  of  representative  rural  access  road  and  irrigation  rehabilitation \nsubprojects in Phongsaly and Luang Namtha indicate EIRRs in the range of 14%\u201315.5% based \non quantifiable benefits. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nAll  procurement  to  be financed  by  the  ADB  grant  will  be  carried  out in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).15 MAF shall ensure that \nall  accounts  administered  by  the  NPMO  and  PPOs  are  consolidated  and  audited  annually  by \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  capacity-building  component  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of \nNPMO  and  PPO  staff  in  financial  management  procedures  to  allow  the  efficient  operation  of \nadvance  accounts  and  reporting  of  financial  performance  to  the  government  and  ADB.  The \nimplementation  of  the  project  will  be  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  requirement  for  national \ncoordination.  Provincial  implementation  will  seek  the  involvement  of  district  and  lower \nadministrative  units  and  communities  to  ensure  their  participation  in  monitoring  design  and \nconstruction, as was done under the successful Northern Community Managed Irrigation Sector \nProject (footnote 5). Coordination with other agencies will be achieved through their participation \nin  the  national  and  provincial  project  steering  committees  to  achieve  the  necessary  technical \nsupport. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MAF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures \nare described in the project administration manual and will be posted on the project website. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nThe proposed project will be implemented in northern rural Lao PDR, where the average \npoverty  rate  is  37%.16 The  analysis  of  declines  in  poverty  rates  since  the  mid  1990s  show  the \ngreatest  gains  achieved  where  there  are  links  to  markets  and  infrastructure,  with  poverty \npersisting  in  remote  upland  areas  of  the  north  that  lack  road  access.  Ethnicity  is  also  a \ndeterminant  of  poverty,  as  ethnic  minority  groups  have  poverty  rates  above  42%  and  have \nrecorded a slower decline in the incidence of poverty since 2005 than that seen in the dominant \nLao\u2013Thai.  Most  subprojects  will  be  implemented  in  areas  where  ethnic  groups  constitute  a \nmajority and where poverty tends to be more pervasive than the national average. Investments \nin irrigation rehabilitation will improve the incomes and food security of households and, through \nassociated  initiatives,  provide  opportunities  for  women  and  men  to  build  their  capacity17.  The \nproject  will  provide  resources  for  implementing  subproject  gender  action  plans  and  indigenous \npeople\u2019s  plans.  Women  and  children  will  benefit  from  reduced  time  spent  collecting  water.  As \nwomen  are  greatly  underrepresented  in  village  and  community  decision-making  institutions, \nthere  will  be  specific  interventions  to  increase  their  involvement  in  producer  and  water  user \ngroups.  Vulnerable  groups,  mainly  ethnic  minorities  and  households  headed  by  females,  will \nenjoy  preferential  opportunities  for  construction  employment.  Intensified  agricultural  activity  will \nincrease  demand  for  labor.  Investments  in  rural  access  roads  will  improve  access  to  public \nservices  and  options  for  commercial  enterprises  and  marketing.  Through  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure  and  road  access,  the  proposed  project  is  anticipated  to  contribute  to  improved \n\n                                                 \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  Department  of  Statistics.  2010.

The Gender Action Plan is accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n\flivelihoods  and  reduced  incidence  and  depth  of  poverty.  The  benefits  from  improved  access \ndirectly affect household incomes and facilitate access to health and education services. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nResettlement.  Little  resettlement  is  anticipated  as  subprojects  will  rehabilitate  existing \ninfrastructure and require insignificant land acquisition. Further, subprojects will be prescreened \nbefore grant effectiveness to ensure they do not entail significant resettlement.18 Only category B \nand  C  subprojects  will  be  eligible  for  financing  under  the  proposed  project.  Any  minor \ncompensation  that  may  be  needed  will  be  provided  in  accordance  with  resettlement  plans \nprepared  for  each  subproject  based  on  the  guidelines  outlined  in  the  resettlement  framework \nagreed with the government19. The project is categorized as B for involuntary resettlement. \n \n28. \nEnvironmental.  Prescreening  aims  to  ensure  that  subprojects  considered  for  financing \nwill not have significant negative environmental impacts and that minor impacts can be mitigated \nthrough the implementation of the subproject environmental management plans prepared as part \nof  each  initial  environmental  examination.20 In  the  case  of  rural  access  road  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading, subprojects are limited to existing alignments and will most likely involve limited cut \nand  fill,  minor  widening,  and  little  realignment.  For  irrigation  rehabilitation  and  development, \nfeasibility studies will ensure that water off-take during the dry season allows sufficient flows to \nmaintain  the  riparian  ecosystem  and  ensure  adequate  resources  for  downstream  users.  The \nintroduction of land zoning in the catchment areas of reservoirs will minimize inappropriate land \nuse  and  reduce  the  risk  of  siltation  while  assuring  dry  season  flows.  Environment  category  A \nsubprojects will be ineligible for financing under the proposed project. Technical specialists will \nprepare  national  and  provincial  environmental  assessments  and  management  plans  for  each \nsubproject. The project is categorized as B for environmental safeguard. \n \n29. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  otherwise  dominant  Lao\u2013Thai  ethnic  group  is  a  minority  in \neach  of  the four  target provinces, where  the main  ethnic  groups  are  Mon-Khmer  in  Bokeo and \nOudomxay  and  Chine-Tibet  in  Luang  Namtha  and  Phongsaly.  The  principles  followed  in  all \nsubproject  preparation  will  be  consultation,  inclusion,  and  preferential  access  to  employment \nopportunities for vulnerable ethnic minority groups. As with socioeconomic baseline surveys, all \ndata  collected  will  be  disaggregated  by  ethno-linguistic  group,  age  (where  appropriate),  and \ngender to allow the monitoring and evaluation of beneficiary inclusion. The proposed project is \ncategory  B  for  indigenous  peoples  because  (i)  most  people  in  the  four  provinces  are  ethnic \nminorities who generally have higher poverty rates than the nationally dominant Lao\u2013Thai group \nand  (ii)  impacts  are  expected  to  be  positive.  The  prescreening  of  subprojects  and  consultation \nprocesses  will  exclude  subprojects  that  would  disadvantage  any  groups.  Indigenous  peoples \nplans for each approved subproject will detail requirements for inclusion, benefit measuring, and \nmonitoring21. The project is categorized as B for indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe integrated benefits and impacts of the proposed project are expected to outweigh the \n\n30. \ncosts. The major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n18  Based on feasibility studies of representative subprojects and initial prescreening, the total cost of land acquisition \n\nand resettlement is estimated to be $268,000, or 2% of civil works costs. \n\n19 Resettlement Framework is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n20 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n21 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nEconomic development \npotential in subproject \nareas is limited. \nInsufficient operation and \nmaintenance causes \npremature asset \ndeterioration. \n\nSubprojects will be prescreened to ensure technical and prima facie economic \nviability during preparation. Feasibility studies including economic and financial \nanalyses will be conducted before implementation. \nParticipating provinces have committed to providing adequate operation and \nmaintenance funding as a condition for subproject selection. Robust designs and \ngood quality control will reduce the maintenance burden.
