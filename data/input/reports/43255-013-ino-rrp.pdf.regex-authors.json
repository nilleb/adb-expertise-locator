I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Urban Sanitation and Rural Infrastructure Support to the \nPNPM  Mandiri  Project.1 The  report  also  describes  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Strengthening \nSanitation Planning and Efficiency Improvement, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the administration of \nTA.2  \n \n2.  The  project  forms  part  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  ongoing  flagship  poverty \nreduction  program\u2014the  National  Program  for  Community  Empowerment  (PNPM  Mandiri), \nwhich was launched in 2006 with the commitment to reduce poverty by adopting a community-\ndriven development approach and providing direct support to poor rural and urban communities \nto improve essential social services and basic infrastructure. The project will be implemented in \na geographic slice of the PNPM Mandiri Program and will include about 600 rural communities \nin four provinces and 1,350 poor urban neighborhoods in 34 cities. The project is included in the \nIndonesia country operations business plan, 2010\u20132012.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The government requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to scale up ongoing \nassistance to the PNPM Mandiri scheme to (i) upgrade basic rural infrastructure in poor villages \nin provinces covered by ongoing ADB-supported projects, and (ii) promote community-driven \nsanitation development to contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) \ntarget to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to basic sanitation.  \n  \n4.  Population below the poverty line in Indonesia declined by 1.51 million from 32.53 million \nin March 2009 to 31.02 million in March 2010.  While continued poverty reduction during a \nperiod  of  significant  external  uncertainties  is  a  good  achievement,  the  poverty  headcount \nremains quite large. The causes of poverty include lack of access to basic services (such as \nhealth,  education,  safe  water,  and  sanitation);  absence  of  economic  opportunities;  limited \naccess to capital; and poor rural connectivity and infrastructure. The poor are vulnerable to \nexternal shocks and the large numbers of \u201cnear poor\u201d are at risk of falling back into poverty in \nthe event of sickness, natural disaster, harvest failure, rising food prices, or economic recession.  \n  \n5.  The government has made poverty alleviation a development priority. The Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan (RPJM), 2010\u20132014 targets average growth of 6%\u20137% per year, with a \nreduction in the poverty rate from 14.2% in 2009 to 8%\u201310% by 2014. The government\u2019s \nforemost poverty reduction program is PNPM Mandiri, which provides assistance to poor rural \nand urban communities nationwide through up to three cycles of block grants for improving \nessential  social  services  and  basic  infrastructure.  The  RPJM,  2010\u20132014  includes  PNPM \nMandiri  as  a  development  tool  to  accelerate  poverty  alleviation  with  an  indicative  budget \nallocation of $6,754 million over 5 years for seven PNPM programs.4  \n                                                 \n1  The project is reflected in the government\u2019s blue book as (i) Rural Infrastructure Support \u2013 National Community \nEmpowerment Program, Phase 3; and (ii) Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project, Phase 1. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n4  PNPM programs included in the RPJM are the PNPM Urban ($664 million); PNPM Rural ($5,420 million); PNPM \nRegional  Infrastructure  for  Social  and  Economic  Development  ($132  million);  PNPM  Rural  Infrastructure \n($335 million); PNPM for sanitation\u2014SANIMAS ($37 million); PNPM for water supply and sanitation\u2014PANSIMAS ", "2 \n6.  ADB is supporting the government\u2019s PNPM Mandiri scheme through two projects: (i) the \nRural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project (RIS-PNPM) for $50.0 million;5  and \n(ii) the RIS-PNPM Project II for $84.2 million.6  Both projects include assistance for community \nmobilization, and provide block grants to upgrade basic rural infrastructure in 2,160 villages in \nfour provinces (Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra7). More than 3.5 million poor people \nwill benefit from infrastructure improvements in their villages, including newly constructed roads \nand small bridges, upgraded footpaths and drainage, and improved sanitation and water supply \nfacilities. Building on lessons and achievements of both projects, the proposed new project will \nfollow a community-driven development approach.8  \n \n7.  Limited access to rural infrastructure. Infrastructure investments, which accounted for \nmore than 6% of gross domestic product before 1997, fell to a low of 2% in 2000 and have only \nreached 3% in 2009, reflecting a sharp decline in public and private spending. As a result, \ninfrastructure  conditions  in  many  rural  areas  are  alarming.  Rural  roads  are  deteriorating \nbecause of inadequate maintenance. About 50% of rural villages are not connected by asphalt \nroads and more than 10% of all villages are inaccessible even by four-wheel-drive vehicles at \ncertain  times  of  the  year.  Poor  roads  or  no  roads  mean  that  government  services  are \ninaccessible;  higher  transportation  costs  cause  an  additional  burden  for  poor  and  remote \ncommunities. In addition to poor road conditions, infrastructure needs related to water supply \nneed special consideration. While the MDG target set for access to safe water sources in rural \nareas is 65.8% of households, only 45.7% of rural households have sustainable access to \nimproved water sources. The percentage of rural communities with access to sanitation facilities \nis even more alarming\u2014only 34%. Furthermore, it is estimated that about 90 million people in \nrural communities have no access to electricity. The four project provinces (Jambi, Lampung, \nRiau, and South Sumatra) have high rural poverty and unequal access to infrastructure, with a \ntotal of almost 4 million poor people in 2009. South Sumatra (16%) and Lampung (20%) had \npoverty incidence well above the national average.  \n \n8.  Limited  access  to  sanitation.  While Indonesia has generally made good progress \ntoward accelerating achievement of the MDGs, the MDG targets for access to basic sanitation \nneed special attention. The percentage of Indonesians with access to improved sanitation \nfacilities has doubled since 1993, but progress has been slower than in other countries in the \nregion at similar levels of economic development. In 2009, only 51% of the national population \nhad access to improved sanitation, while the MDG target for accessing basic sanitation facilities \nis 62.37% of the population by 2015.9 The poor often do not have access to safe water sources \n                                                                                                                                                          \n($469 million); and PNPM Support for Poor and Disadvantaged Areas\u2014SPADA ($277 million). In 2010, the \ngovernment increased the allocation for PNPM Mandiri to $1.3 billion (from $1.1 billion in 2009). \n5  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n6  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri Project II. Manila. \n7  The RIS PNPM has been completed and closed in mid 2011, while the RIS PNPM II is currently being implemented \nans scheduled for completion in late 2013. \n8  Key lessons from previous PNPM initiatives for good project design and implementation include (i) community \ncontrol  of  decision  making  over  resources  and  investment  choices;  (ii)  simple  and  transparent  funds  flow \narrangements with direct transfers to community accounts; (iii) comprehensive facilitation support, including social \nfacilitators to ensure full community participation, and engineering facilitators to oversee technical quality of civil \nworks; (iv) strong accountability procedures, such as public disclosure of budgets and contracts; (v) village \nmanagement  of  funds  and  procurement  matters;  and  (vi)  training  for  communities  in  establishing  effective \nmechanisms to operate and maintain new infrastructure. \n9  In Indonesia, sanitation facilities are defined as those that provide safe, hygienic, and convenient facilities that \nprevent the user and the immediate environment from coming into contact with human excreta. Improved sanitation \nfacilities are defined to include flush and pour flush toilets that are linked to a piped sewer system or a septic tank. \nImproved pit latrines with a slab seal and ventilation are also classified as improved sanitation facilities, as are \n ", "3 \nand basic sanitation facilities, which has severe consequences for their health and livelihoods. \nWaterborne diseases have a high cost in terms of health among those without access to \nimproved water and sanitation. Two of the most important causes of mortality for children under \n5 years old are fecal-borne diseases, and waterborne diseases, including cholera, diarrhea, and \ntyphoid fever, which are linked to use of unprotected water, poor sanitation, and inadequate \nawareness among communities of hygienic practices. Some 30% of Indonesians suffer from \nwaterborne diseases. \n \n9.  Efforts to increase basic sanitation coverage are complicated by population growth, \nespecially in urban areas where growth rates are higher than the national rate. At the current \nnational  population  growth  rate\u20141.3%  per  year\u2014an  additional  2.8  million  Indonesians  will \nrequire  basic  sanitation  facilities  every  year  from  now  until  2015,  adding  to  more  than \n100 million people currently without basic sanitation.  The main challenges to increasing access \nto improved sanitation are summarized below:  \n(i)  The regulatory framework for water supply and sanitation is less than adequate.  \n(ii)  The growth of urban populations has been greater than the development of water \nand sanitation infrastructure. Investments in connection rates of urban water \nsupply have failed to keep pace with the growth in urban populations while the \nuse of household on-site sanitation systems has not been accompanied by public \ninvestments in collection, treatment, and disposal infrastructure. \n(iii)  Community  awareness  of  the  importance  of  clean  water  use  and  sanitation \nremains low. While almost all households boil water for drinking, 48% of such \nwater still contains E. coli.  \n(iv)  Responsibility for water and sanitation management has been devolved to local \ngovernments, but local capacity to ensure that adequate systems are in place or \noperating correctly is limited.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  Corresponding to the overall objective of PNPM Mandiri, the impact of the project will be \nreduced poverty in the project areas. The outcome will be improved access to service delivery \nand healthy livelihoods for the poor, near poor, and women in the project communities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project will have three outputs: (i) strengthened capacity for community planning \nand development, (ii) improved rural basic infrastructure, and (iii) improved sanitation services. \n \n12.  Output 1: Strengthened capacity for community planning and development. The \nproject will support and strengthen community empowerment and capacity to prioritize, design, \nimplement, manage, and monitor community-based projects. Social mobilization and community \nfacilitation are crosscutting activities that will occur at all stages of the community empowerment \nprocess and are keys for ensuring pro-poor investments and sustainability. Following the PNPM \nMandiri guidelines, the project will deploy community facilitators10 to assist communities to carry \nout  poverty  mapping,  identify  problems  and  needs,  evaluate  community  implementation \ncapacity,  develop  efficient  planning  and  decision-making  processes,  establish  and  run \ncommunity  implementing  organizations  (CIOs),  formulate  development  plans  and  specific \ninvestment plans to be financed by block grants, prepare technical designs and implement civil \nworks, and formulate and implement operation and maintenance (O&M) plans to ensure the \n                                                                                                                                                          \ncomposting toilets. Unimproved sanitation facilities include toilets that drain to an open sewer, ditch, open drain, \nstream, river or open field, pit latrines without slab coverings, buckets, and hanging toilets. \n10  The government will contract and finance community facilitators. \n ", "4 \nsustainability of completed facilities. Community facilitators will be organized in teams, each \nconsisting of facilitators for (i) social development, (ii) technical matters, and (iii) overall project \nmanagement. At least 30% of the facilitators will be women. As successfully implemented under \nthe ongoing RIS-PNPM projects, each participating community will work with the project through \na CIO (an existing village organization or a new project organization).11  \n \n13.   To assist communities in rural areas to design and implement investments plans to \nupgrade basic infrastructure financed by block grants provided under output 2, facilitators will be \nrecruited from teams engaged under ongoing RIS-PNPM projects. The executing agency will \nidentify experienced and well-performing facilitators to be employed under the project.  \n \n14.  To  assist  communities  in  urban  neighborhoods  to  establish  and  improve  sanitation \nfacilities  financed  by  block  grants  under  output  3,  the  executing  agency  will  engage  new \nfacilitators with good experience in participatory planning methods, community mobilization and \nempowerment, and specifically in community-based sanitation services. Facilitators assigned for \ncommunity empowerment will be trained specifically on approaches to foster sanitation and \nhygiene behavioral changes. Facilitators assigned to provide technical guidance on community-\nbased sanitation will be trained on suitable and simple sanitation technologies and appropriate \nconstruction methods.  \n \n15.  Output 2: Improved rural basic infrastructure through community development \ngrants. Block grants12 will be provided to villages to upgrade basic infrastructure to meet local \nneeds identified by the village community. Consistent with the PNPM Mandiri guidelines, the \nmenu of investment opportunities for communities will be open except for a short negative list of \nactivities prohibited by the government or ADB policies. Selection of community investments will \nbe based on the guidelines prepared for ongoing RIS-PNPM projects. The project will allocate \ntwo cycles of block grants of Rp250 million each for about 600 villages. After the completion of \nthe first cycle of block grants, the executing agency, assisted by the district and provincial \nproject implementation units (DPIUs and PPIUs), will carry out a village performance evaluation. \nOnly villages that are evaluated as good performers will continue to receive the second cycle of \nblock grants. Poorly performing villages will be excluded for the second round of block grants \nand replaced by new villages.  \n \n16.  Out of the 600 targeted villages, about 200 villages have already received one cycle of \nblock grants under the overall PNPM program financed by the government\u2019s own resources. \nThe remaining 400 villages, selected from a list of the poorest villages in the country, have not \nreceived any PNPM support. All 600 villages are located in the 215 subdistricts in Jambi, \nLampung, Riau, and South Sumatra covered by the ongoing RIS-PNPM projects. Villages will \nbe selected based on poverty incidence ranking using the latest available data.  The list of \nvillages  will  be  confirmed  by  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  People  Welfare  and  verified  by \nprovincial and district governments to ensure that the poorest villages are selected and that no \nbetter-off villages are included. The executing agency will replace selected villages that are not \nwilling to participate or have been affected by force majeure or disaster (which would encumber \ntheir participation) with other poor villages within the project subdistricts.  \n  \n                                                 \n11 Overall CIO membership will comprise at least 40% women. The CIO representative committee will consist of five \nmembers, including at least two women. The CIO will be legalized by the village or neighborhood head and \nregistered with the kecamatan (subdistrict) head, which is a prerequisite for opening a CIO bank account. CIO \ndecisions will be validated in village or neighborhood meetings with at least 60% household attendance. \n12 Under this project, a block grant is defined as a fixed sum of money granted by the national government, which is \ntransferred in three tranches to a selected community that has met certain criteria for the financing of construction \nof (i) basic rural infrastructure, or (ii) sanitation facilities in urban areas. A cycle of block grant consists of at least \nthree block grants to a selected community. \n ", "5 \n17.  Following the approach established under the ongoing RIS-PNPM projects, block grants \nwill be transferred directly to community bank accounts managed by the CIOs. The CIO will take \nthe lead in developing investment plans, with assistance from community facilitators and the \nDPIUs. After the village investment plans, which include the final technical designs and cost \nestimates, have been approved at a village assembly and submitted to the DPIU for approval, a \ncontract will be executed between the CIO and the DPIU and the first installment of the block \ngrant will be released. Communities will undertake civil works with technical guidance from the \ncommunity facilitators, DPIUs, and project management consultants. The proposed project will \nutilize the same funds flow mechanism for block grants as the ongoing RIS-PNPM projects.  \n \n18.  Output  3:  Improved  sanitation  services  through  neighborhood  development \ngrants. The project will provide block grants of about Rp350 million to about 1,350 urban \nneighborhoods in 34 cities in the provinces of Central Java, DI Yogyakarta, East Java, South \nSulawesi,  and  North  Sulawesi  to  improve  community-driven  sanitation  services  including \n(i) construction of public bathing, toilets, and washing facilities; (ii) improvement of communal \nsewerage systems and waste treatment;13 and (iii) improvement of disposal or reuse systems.14 \nTo ensure that community sanitation facilities established under the project will be integrated in \ncity development plans and linked to city sewerage systems, only neighborhoods located in \ncities with an approved city sanitation strategy will participate in the project. By 2011, local \ngovernments in the project provinces are expected to have endorsed strategies for 43 cities. To \nassure support from the respective city administrations, local governments will provide a firm \nletter  of  confirmation  documenting  their  readiness  to  participate  in  the  project  and  their \ncontributions to support community-led sanitation development.  \n  \n19.  Given the limited community awareness on the importance of sanitation and hygiene, \nand the lack of understanding on community-driven sanitation technologies, the project will \nallow  sufficient  time  for  the  community  empowerment  process.  Facilitators  will  assist  local \ncommunities to develop their own action plans for sustainable sanitation services and improved \nhygiene and heath environments. The process will start with the establishment of a long list of \ncommunities showing interest to participate. Based on selection criteria,15 neighborhoods will be \nchosen to participate in the project. Facilitators will help community members to (i) identify \nissues  and  needs  related  to  health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation;  (ii)  formulate  inclusive  and \nsustainable sanitation plans with investment plans to be financed by block grants; (iii) prepare \ntechnical designs; (iv) implement civil works; and (v) formulate and implement O&M plans to \nensure the sustainability of completed facilities.  \n \n20.   The implementation mechanism will be similar to output 2 and follow good practices \nestablished under RIS-PNPM projects. Each participating neighborhood will work through a \nCIO; block grants will be transferred directly to community bank accounts; procurement process \nand  fund  flow  mechanisms  will  be  in  line  with  procedures  described  under  output  2  and \nestablished under RIS-PNPM projects.  \n \n \n   \n                                                 \n13 Treatment systems could include communal septic tanks, bio-digesters, baffled reactors, anaerobic filters, ponds.  \n14 This could include river disposal, sludge drying, use as fertilizer, and sucking by sludge trucks. \n15 Neighborhoods will be selected based on the following: (i) the neighborhood shall be located in cities with an \napproved City Sanitation Strategy; (ii) the community members within the neighborhood shall have agreed to \ndesign and implement sanitations facilities; (iii) the CIO for the neighborhood shall have been established and \naccountability and governance mechanism shall have been in place; and (iv.) the community members within the \nneighborhood  shall  indicate  their  willingness  to  improve  overall  hygiene  and  health  environments  in  the \nneighborhood. \n \n ", "6 \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n21.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.16 The executing agency for the project is the Directorate \nGeneral of Human Settlements (DGHS), within the MPW. The DGHS will also act as the key \nproject implementing agency. The project will be implemented over 4 years, from January 2012 \nto December 2015. In the four provinces of Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra under \noutput 2, the project will use the existing implementation arrangements established under the \nongoing RIS-PNPM projects; and continue working with the established district and province \nimplementation units. At new project locations under output 3, where sanitation-related project \nactivities  will  be  implemented,  the  DGHS  will  establish  project  management  units  at  the \nrespective city administrations. Tasks of these new PPIUs and DPIUs will comprise the same \nresponsibilities assigned to PPIUs or DPIUs under the RIS-PNPM projects. The MOH will be \nclosely involved in the preparation of training and awareness strategies to promote sanitation \nand hygiene behavioral changes. \n \n                                                 \n16  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2012\u2013December 2015 \nEstimated project completion date  31 December 2015 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  Oversight body for the National Program for Community Empowerment \n \n(ii)   Executing agency  Directorate General of Human Settlements (DGHS), within the Ministry of \nPublic Works (MPW) \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  DGHS . \n(iv)  Project implementation unit  Central project management unit, DGHS, MPW, 5 staff  \nProvincial project implementation units (PPIUs) in nine participating provinces, \n3\u20135 staff in each PPIU \nDistrict implementation unit in 71 districts and cities, 3\u20135 staff in each unit \nProcurement  Community  2,550 contracts  $86.0 million \nProcurement  \nConsulting services  3,015 person-months  $7.9 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  None \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23.  Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the borrower shall establish immediately after the \neffective date, an imprest account at the Bank of Indonesia. The imprest account shall be \nestablished,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements \nagreed upon between the borrower and ADB. The currency of the imprest account shall be in \nUS dollars. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure may be used for reimbursement of \neligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not  exceeding  $50,000  and  to  liquidate \nadvances provided into the imprest account. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n24.  The government has requested capacity development TA from ADB to support project \nimplementation. In partnership with ongoing initiatives, the TA seeks to (i) strengthen the quality \nof community facilitation to improve infrastructure built under the PNPM by consolidating training \nmodules and materials related to community mobilization and technical matters associated with \ncommunity-constructed  infrastructure  (including  affordable  and  replicable  technologies  for \ncommunity-driven  sanitation  development);  (ii)  promote  demand-driven  public  and  private \ntraining supply, including development of strategies to establish quality assessment schemes for \ntraining modules, trainers, and training providers, and to procure training services from private \nsector providers; and (iii) develop strategies to scale up and anchor sanitation-related training \nand advocacy.  \n \n25.  To assess impacts of sanitation interventions and guide future strategies to advance \ncommunity-driven sanitation, the TA will include a baseline survey on sanitation in selected \nneighborhoods at the project start and carry out subsequent impact assessments after the first \nand second years. The TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide in-kind support of about $500,000. To support activities under the TA, UNICEF has \nindicated  that  it  will  provide  national  and  international  consulting  services  to  assist  in \n ", "8 \nconsolidating  training  modules  and  materials,  preparing  a  certification  scheme  for  training \nproviders  and  trainers,  and  developing  advocacy  strategies  to  promote  community-based \nsanitation.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The expected economic benefits of the project are significant and include (i) improved \npublic health status and reduced per capita costs for health care treatment as a result of the \nincreased  coverage  of  sanitation  services  and  improved  hygiene,  particularly  in  densely \npopulated urban neighborhoods of participating cities; (ii) reduction in pollution; (iii) sustained \nimpacts on the economies of participating villages by improving essential rural infrastructure and \naccess to basic services; and (iv) considerable short-term employment generation.  \n \n27.  Project interventions will be identified by community members through a participatory \ncommunity-driven  development  (CDD)  process.  CDD  approaches  provide  good  quality \ncommunity-level infrastructure at significantly lower costs than technically comparable projects \nusing  traditional  (non-CDD)  modes  of  government  contracting.  Evaluations  of  CDD \ninfrastructure  projects  using  local  government  unit  costs  and  local  contractor  costs \ndemonstrated that the investment costs of CDD-provided infrastructure were on average only \n63.7% of local government costs.  \n \n28.  Local manual labor will largely carry out the implementation of civil works financed by \nblock grants. The project is projected to generate about 6 million person-days of short-term \nemployment at an average wage rate of $5 per day, and additional short-term income of \n$30.0 million.  As  this  employment  is  largely  provided  in  the  agricultural  off-season,  it  has \nparticular benefits for reducing unemployment and vulnerability among the poor. There is also \nevidence that increased demand for manual labor has a broader impact in raising the wages of \nunskilled workers outside the project areas, which contributes to poverty reduction.   \n \n29.  The project is expected to have significant impacts on the economies of participating \ncommunities. Similar types of investments have been shown to yield an average economic \ninternal rate of return of 28%\u201368%. Economic benefits arise from opening access to markets \nand  lowering  transport  costs  in  the  case  of  rural  roads  and  bridges,  increased  incomes, \nadditional crop cycles from improved irrigation, and time saved in collecting water and health \nbenefits from water and sanitation projects. Overall, project investments are expected to benefit \nmore than 1.3 million people in more than 270,000 households.  \n \nB.  Governance \n30.  Community-based planning mechanisms are the key to instituting good governance \npractices. The project will strengthen the ability of communities to articulate their needs and to \nseek support for their development plans, and will improve the respective district governments\u2019 \nability to respond to the demands of poor communities. As the project will target poor villages \nand urban neighborhoods, capacity building activities will directly benefit the poor by providing \nthem  with  the  means  to  draw  the  attention  and  resources  of  local  governments  to  their \ndevelopment needs.  \n \n31.  Previous community development projects indicate a risk of elite capture. This risk is \nminimized by several features of the project design, including (i) community poverty mapping; \n(ii) establishment of CIOs with representation of women, minority, and marginalized groups \namong the community representatives; and (iii) transparent mechanisms of publicly displaying \n ", "9 \ndecision  making  processes,  tender  documents,  fund  transfers  and  disbursements  of  block \ngrants, and progress of civil works. All civil works will be contracted to the CIOs and will be \nundertaken primarily through manual labor. This will help ensure that the jobs generated by the \nproject are filled by community members. Infrastructure projects involving procurement of large \namounts of goods and services for civil works may be prone to corruption. To a large extent, this \nwill  be  mitigated  through  community  management  of  the  planning,  oversight,  and \nimplementation of the civil works. In addition, the existing financial management systems and \nfiduciary  controls  under  PNPM  Mandiri,  which  have  been  developed  with  assistance  from \ninternational development partners, are sound and have adequate checks and balances to \nminimize  corruption  risks.  Finally,  the  project\u2019s  complaints  and  problems  handling  unit  will \nreview and address any grievances of project stakeholders in relation to the project, any of the \nservice providers, or any person responsible for carrying out the project.  \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Ministry of Public Works. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The  project  will  target  poor  communities  in  less  developed  villages  and  urban \nneighborhoods  that  lack  basic  services  and  infrastructure.  The  selected  villages  and \nneighborhoods  will  have  higher  than  average  poverty  levels  and  lower  than  average \nachievement levels for MDGs. Improvements in basic infrastructure will improve income-earning \nopportunities and increase the availability and accessibility of education and health services for \nthe rural poor and near poor. Improved sanitation and cleaner environments resulting from \nproject activities in poor neighborhoods will reduce diseases linked to unsafe water and poor \nhygiene, and will thus contribute to improving the health of the poor. This benefit will particularly \naccrue to infants and children, who are more vulnerable and suffer more frequently and severely \nfrom diseases caused by poor sanitation and hygiene practices. A gender action plan, which \nhas been included in the project design, aims to enhance women\u2019s ability to participate in the \ndecision-making process and to ensure that women and men in the project sites benefit equally \nfrom increased access to improved basic infrastructure and social services.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n34.  Land acquisition and resettlements. The project has been classified category B as the \nscope  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  expected  to  be  insignificant.  In  urban \nneighborhoods,  the  project  might  require  limited  land  acquisition  occasionally  for  small \ncommunity  sanitation  facilities,  but  will  not  entail  any  resettlement  of  people,  relocation  of \nhouses, or significant impact upon productive land or other productive assets. It is expected that \nsmall land acquisitions will be provided by project beneficiaries voluntarily. ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and its requirements will be adopted if any compensation is needed in \ncase of land acquisition. Safeguard specialists at national, provincial, and district levels have \nbeen included in the consultant packages. The resettlement framework has been prepared.17 \n \n35.  Environment. The project is classified environmental category B. Overall, the project \nwill  have  significant  positive  impacts  on  the  quality  of  life  and  environment  of  the  project \ncommunities. Because of the small scale of expected civil works, most of the expected negative \neffects are site-specific, short-term and temporary, and easily mitigated to acceptable levels. \nThe environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared.18  \n                                                 \n17  Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n  \n36.  Indigenous peoples. The project is not expected to have any negative impacts on \nindigenous peoples. It will not discriminate against them or other marginalized groups. Following \nCDD  principles,  the  project  will  include  opportunities  for  screening  project  impacts  on \nindigenous groups and incorporating mitigation measures, if any, into the overall design and \nimplementation of any investment. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the \nproject has been classified category C.19  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  The project overall risks are assessed to be medium. The following table summarizes \nproject key risks and the mitigating measures: \n \nTable 3:  Summary of Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack  of  adequate  operation  and  Community  facilitators  and  consultants  will  advise  community \nmaintenance  (O&M)  can  reduce  the  members on the importance of O&M; O&M concepts will be a \nbenefits from investments and jeopardize  mandatory part of the investment plans to be approved by the \nsustainability  district project implementation unit. \nLack of understanding of the importance of  The attached capacity development technical assistance will help \nsanitation  to  consolidate  and  improve  existing  awareness  strategies,  and \nscale up and roll out awareness campaigns and training programs \nat all levels in the project cities. \nPoor  technical  design  and  poor  Community facilitators and consultants will be carefully selected \nimplementation of civil works  and trained to support communities; a monitoring system will be \nestablished  to  provide  additional  supervision  by  government \nexperts from the respective district and municipality administration \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n38.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Urban Sanitation and Rural Infrastructure \nSupport to PNPM Mandiri Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n15 July 2011 \n                                                 \n19 Specific actions have been included in the project: (i) the selection criteria for community investments includes that \nindigenous people and other vulnerable groups are part of the capacity building, planning, implementation, and \npost-implementation  processes;  (ii)  minority  and  marginalized  groups  will  be  represented  on  CIOs;  and \n(iii) indigenous groups will benefit proportionally from easier access to service delivery, rural infrastructure, training, \nand construction-related jobs. \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and/or  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n  National and regional \nBy 2017:  PNPM Mandiri \nReduced poverty in  governments continue \nevaluations  \nthe project areas   Number of households in project  to support community-\n  villages living below poverty line  PODES village-level and  driven development. \n  reduced by at least 15% from project  National Statistic   \nbaseline   (SUSENAS household  Risk \nsurveys)  Natural or financial \n  disasters will impact the \n     project areas.  \n \nOutcome  By 2014:     \n  Assumptions \nAbout 0.6 million poor people in  PPMS reports \nImproved access to  National budget funds \n600 villages will have access to \nboth service delivery  PODES village-level and  are adequate and \nimproved rural infrastructure and \nand healthy  SUSENAS household  provided in a timely \nbetter service delivery. \nlivelihoods for the  surveys  manner. \npoor, near-poor, and  At least 50% of villagers in project \nwomen in the project  villages, of which half are women, are  Baseline and follow-up  Central and local \ncommunities  satisfied with improvements in local  impact evaluation  governments continue \n   roads, drinking water, sanitation, and  surveys in target project  to prioritize reduction of \nareas (Ministry of Public  environmental pollution \nother basic infrastructure.  \nWorks)   in urban areas. \n \n \nAt least 50% of men and women in \nIndependent NGO   \nproject urban neighborhoods have \nmonitoring and   \nincreased awareness of sound \nevaluation reports \nhygiene and sanitation practices.  \nPNPM Mandiri \nIncrease in population with access to \nmanagement information \nimproved sanitation services by 20% \nsystem and evaluations  \nin 2014 from baseline that will be \nestablished at the project start; about   \n0.5 million people will have access to \nimproved sanitation and new facilities \nin the 34 cities.  \n \nOutputs  By 2014:     \n1.
