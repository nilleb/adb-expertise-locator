THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Guangxi  Beibu  Gulf  Cities  Development \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve basic urban infrastructure facilities and living condition of Beihai, \nQinzhou, and Fangchenggang, three medium-sized seaport cities on the Beibu Gulf in the \nsouthern part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi). Given their high growth \npotential and strategic location, the project will develop these cities to be engines of growth for \nGuangxi  and  gateways  for  the  country  to  its  Southeast  Asian  neighbors.  The  project  will \nincorporate  innovative  ideas  on  environmentally  friendly  and  climate-proof  technologies, \nuniversal  design,  and  transport  planning  for  enhancing  urban  safety.  These  new  urban \napproaches will be widely replicable within Guangxi and in the rest of the PRC.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Guangxi is one of 12 less-developed provinces and autonomous regions covered under \nthe PRC\u2019s Western Development Strategy.3 Guangxi shares a border of 1,020 kilometers (km) \nwith Viet Nam and has 1,595 km of seacoast, which make Guangxi the only province that \nprovides both seaport and land access for the neighboring landlocked provinces of Guizhou, \nYunnan, and Hunan and farther west. Guangxi is emerging as an important national multimodal \ntransport and trade gateway to link south and west parts of the PRC with neighboring countries \nin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This can help Guangxi better contribute \nto achieving greater balance in the social and economic development of the PRC. \n  \n4.  Although the growth in Guangxi\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has exceeded the \nnational average since 2001 due to support under the Western Development Strategy, GDP per \ncapita in 2010 is only $2,791 and far below the national average of $4,394.4 Trade statistics \nshow that the speed at which Guangxi is achieving growth from regional economic integration is \nnot great enough. Guangxi is significantly less urbanized than the other provinces and its per \ncapita rates of urban infrastructure investment and coverage are among the country\u2019s lowest. \nThe growth potential of Guangxi has been effectively constrained by the less developed urban \ninfrastructure of the port cities along the Beibu gulf, which are endowed with deepwater harbors \nto serve as the national gateway for international trade and economic cooperation. \n \n5.  Together with the capital city of Nanning, the three project cities comprise the core part \nof  the  Guangxi  Beibu  Gulf  Economic  Development  Zone.5 Despite  national  and  provincial \ngovernment  support,  they  are  struggling  to  expand  their  basic  urban  infrastructure  quickly \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China for Preparing the Guangxi Beibu Gulf Cities Development Project. Manila. \n3  The Western Development Strategy launched in 1999 aims to support economic development in the western \nregions of the PRC so that that they can catch up with the faster-growing eastern provinces. The strategy covers \nsix provinces (Gansu, Guizhou, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan), five provincial-level autonomous regions \n(Guangxi Zhuang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui, Xizang [also known as Tibet Autonomous Region], and Xinjiang \nUygur), and one municipality of provincial status directly administered by the central government (Chongqing). \n4  Guangxi\u2019s GDP growth in 2010 was 14.2%, compared with the national average of 10.3%. \n5  In March 2008, the national and Guangxi governments identified the Guangxi Beibu Gulf Economic Development \nZone for a key development thrust to promote domestic and international regional economic integration. ", "2 \nenough to improve poor living conditions and meet their growth targets. In Qinzhou and Beihai, \nlimited  road  networks  and  the  poor  quality  of  existing  roads  result  in  fragmented  urban \nexpansion  and  low  quality  of  life  for  residents.  Inefficient  transport  connections  between \nresidential areas and port industrial zones also make industrial operations difficult in these \ncities. In Fangchenggang, inadequate existing road capacity and poor traffic safety cannot \nsupport  basic  living  conditions  for  the  increasing  urban  population  and  growing  logistics \nactivities  with  the  border  city  of  Dongxing.  Untreated  municipal  and  industrial  wastewater \ndegrades the urban environment and increases public health risks. The lack of a centralized \nwastewater  treatment  plant  (WWTP)  is  also  a  bottleneck  for  industrial  development  in \nFangchenggang. All of these lead to (i) deterioration in the quality of life especially for the poor, \n(ii)  limited  investment  prospects  in  the  three  project  cities,  and  (iii)  delay  in  promoting \ninternational and national regional economic integration for Guangxi.6 \n \n6.  The  project  will  help  these  three  cities  (i) promote  environmentally  sound  urban \ndevelopment; (ii) improve quality of life by providing access to better social services and a \ncleaner environment to the poor; (iii) improve the investment climate, as well as international \nand domestic trade and commerce; and (iv) accelerate sustainable socioeconomic development \nand  poverty  reduction  through  increased  employment  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  rural \nmigrants. Improved road access and transport facilities will connect key urban districts and port \nindustrial areas, and contribute to better ambient air quality and fuel efficiency. A WWTP will \nalleviate environmental pollution of surface water and reduce health hazards. The project design \nincorporates lessons from past Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed projects in the PRC to \nensure financial viability of the wastewater facility, close institutional coordination for timely \nsewer network construction, enhanced road safety, and sustainable operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of project facilities.7  \n \n7.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 that is now \nunder preparation and that will continue to highlight sustainable urban development with low \nenvironmental impacts. This will also be the focus of the government's Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2011\u20132015. The PRC\u2019s national and regional strategies for growth prioritize urban infrastructure \nand  environmental  sustainability.  The  project  is  also  consistent  with  ADB's  urban  sector \nstrategy, water policy, and strategic priorities on climate change,8 and will help the PRC work to \nachieve Millennium Development Goal 7, Target 7.C.9 The project will demonstrate special \nfeatures for potential replication in other cities in the PRC: \n(i)  Environmentally  friendly  technologies.  The  choice  of  technology  for  the \nproject has been driven by medium- and long-term environmental, social, and \neconomic benefits. The project roads will be the first in Guangxi to use public \nutility  conduits  for  underground  urban  infrastructure  to  avoid  unnecessary \nenvironmental impact from O&M.10 Energy-efficient street lighting and signage \nwill also support low-carbon city development. The WWTP will use advanced \n                                                \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  ADB. 2004.

The three coastal \ncities are vulnerable to future climate change impacts. The technical design of \nthe project roads includes such climate-proofing measures as slope protection \nand erosion control and permeable surfacing for sidewalks for a sustainable \nurban drainage system. A study on design guidelines for climate proofing will also \nbe prepared under the capacity development component. \n(iii)  Universal design for urban infrastructure and public facilities.11  The project \nwill strengthen the cities\u2019 capacity to adopt the concept of universal design in \nplanning urban infrastructure. This will enable them to raise livability standards \nand better meet the needs of elderly and vulnerable people. The basic design will \nbe  considered  during  the  detailed  design  and  a  separate  study  will  be \nimplemented under the project to enhance design concept and planning policy. \n(iv)  Human-centered  planning  of  urban  districts  transport.  The  project  will \nprovide  capacity  development  training  to  promote  urban  safety  and  human-\ncentered  district  and  transport  planning,  including  advanced  urban  transport \nplanning for  emergency  response  and  inclusive  district  land  use  planning to \nbenefit the poor and rural migrants. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be improved basic living conditions and socioeconomic development in \nthe three port cities to support the PRC\u2019s regional cooperation. The outcome will be better urban \ninfrastructure services and environment in the three project cities. \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The project will generate outputs from five investment components and one capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening component:  \n(i)  Beihai Zhulin urban road and related infrastructure.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n14.  The project will pose little technical risk. Engineering designs with records of proven \nreliable performance will be adopted for construction of roads and bridge, the WWTP, and \nrelated municipal infrastructure. Technical feasibility was found to be adequate after careful \nexamination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and future demand projections for \nroad traffic and wastewater generation. Different technical options were analyzed to identify the \nbest routes  and  plant  location, road materials,  bridge  design,  and  wastewater  and  sludge \ntreatment process. The project engineering designs will adopt advanced technologies, such as \nenergy-saving  street  lighting,  public  utility  conduits,  and  a  treatment  process  capable  of \nremoving more nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater. Technical due diligence analysis \nrevealed little technical risk in having these components locally constructed and operated. The \nproject will provide training under its capacity development component to ensure sustainable \nO&M of project facilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n15.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated by comparing with- and \nwithout-project  scenarios.  The  project\u2019s  economic  costs  reflect  (i)  the  capital  cost  for \nconstruction, including physical contingencies, land acquisition, resettlement and environmental \nmonitoring costs; and (ii) O&M costs, which include routine annual maintenance and periodic \nmajor maintenance. The economic benefits of the road components are savings in (i) vehicle \noperating costs, (ii) travel time for road users, and (iii) road accident costs\u2014the result of fewer \naccidents. Quantifiable economic benefits of the Maoling WWTP component are focused on \nhealth benefits. The EIRRs for the project\u2019s five components ranged from 12.7% to 23.7%. The \nnet present value for the whole project is CNY1,391.8 million and the EIRR is 18.7%. Sensitivity \n ", "7 \nanalysis shows that the EIRRs for a 20% reduction in benefits, a 20% increase in capital cost, a \n1-year project completion delay, and the combination of these three cases are 16.0%, 16.6%, \n18.6%, and 13.8% respectively. This indicates that the project is economically viable.15 \n \n16.  The financial viability of the revenue-generating Maoling WWTP component indicates \nthat the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 5.2%, which exceeds the weighted average \ncost of capital (WACC) of 2.4%. Sensitivity analysis of the FIRR shows that the project remains \nfinancially robust in the face of adverse changes including capital cost increases, demand \ndecreases, operating cost increases, and a 1-year delay in project completion. Wastewater \ntariffs will need to be increased every 5 years after the ADB-financed facilities commence \noperation.  The  analysis  concluded  that  low-income  households  will  be  able  to  afford  the \nprojected tariff increases since the share of income expended on water and wastewater will be \naround  0.6%  of  household  income  per month  which  is  well  below  the  benchmark  of  5%. \nLessons from past urban sector projects generated recommendations for detailed financial \nanalysis of potential delays in water and wastewater tariff increases. The financial sustainability \nof the Maoling WWTP was also supported by the analysis that its FIRR would remain higher \nthan the WACC (2.4%) if the proposed tariff increase is implemented every 10 years instead of \nevery 5 years. The FIRR drops to 2.5%, in the case of a combination of (i) a 10% increase in \ncapital costs, (ii) a 10% decrease in demand, and (iii) a 10% increase in operating costs. The \nFangchenggang  municipal  government  has  committed  to  provide  subsidies  to  sustain  the \noperation if revenues do not cover O&M costs. For nonrevenue road components, the financial \nanalysis indicated that the three cities present acceptable levels of fiscal risk in their abilities to \nprovide counterpart funds, service project debt, and fund the O&M of the project components. \nThe highest percentage of the cities\u2019 municipal fiscal revenues that would be required for such \nfunding  annually  ranges  from  0.65%  to  1.28%  over  the  project  period  (2011\u20132016).  The \nmaximum projected debt service requirements for the three cities will be about 0.03% to 0.06% \nof their projected annual revenues during the project operation period.16 \n \nC.  Governance \n17.  The project will be ADB\u2019s ninth loan to Guangxi, which is also successfully managing \nother multisector urban development projects funded by other bilateral and multilateral financial \ninstitutions. The financial management and procurement capacity assessments concluded that \nGZARG, the municipal governments, and the project implementing companies (PICs) have \nadequate capacity for financial management and procurement in accordance with ADB policies \nand procedural requirements, and national procurement laws and regulations. Under GZARG \nsupervision, the municipal governments and the PICs are also receiving support and knowledge \non  governance  issues  from  the  project  cities  of  ADB\u2019s  Guangxi  Southwestern  Cities \nDevelopment  Project.17 They  and  GZARG  will  also  benefit from  the capacity  development \nprograms and governance activities under ADB\u2019s technical assistance for Capacity Building for \nEnhanced Partnership and Development Impact.18 The project\u2019s technical support provides a \nfurther opportunity for the PICs to strengthen their internal audit system through training. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with GZARG, \nthe municipal governments, and their project management offices. Specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n                                                \n15  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2010.

The  project \nconstruction  phase  will  create  9,850  person-years  of  direct  employment  opportunities  and \nanother 25,610 person-years indirectly, generating an estimated CNY240.36 million in earnings \nfor the direct beneficiaries and CNY624.94 million for those who benefit indirectly. Direct jobs \nduring the project operation phase will total 1,190, indirect jobs, 3,090. They will generate \nestimated earnings of CNY26.89 million and CNY69.83 million, respectively. GZARG and the \nmunicipal governments have committed to prioritizing the employment of vulnerable groups, \nincluding the poor, women, and ethnic minorities. To reinforce the positive benefits of improved \ntransport and wastewater treatment, municipal governments will conduct public programs on \nroad safety and environmental awareness during the project. These programs will address the \nneeds of and risks to women and children presented by increased traffic and environmental \ndegradation. The social action plan will be supervised and monitored by resettlement and social \ndevelopment specialists under the project management consulting services.19 \n \n19.  Gender benefits. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Results \nfrom the household survey and focus group discussions indicate that the primary responsibilities \nof women in the project-influenced area are household-related travel, housekeeping activities, \nand taking care of sick and old family members. The project will reduce travel time burdens on \nwomen and improve their mobility and access. Women in all project areas strongly support the \nproject and expect it to improve their quality of life and to create employment and income \nopportunities. The project includes a gender action plan to help ensure (i) increased women\u2019s \nparticipation  in the  project,  including  a target of  at  least  20%  employment for  women; (ii) \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in gender-sensitive training  on  public road  safety  and environmental \nawareness programs; and (iii) the setting and tracking of gender targets, indicators, and sex-\ndisaggregated  data  for  project  monitoring  and  evaluation. 20  Resettlement  and  social \ndevelopment  specialists  in the  project management  consulting  service  will  ensure  that  the \ngender action plan is implemented and monitored. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n20.  Environment. The project is classified under environmental category A. Environmental \nimpact assessments (EIAs) were prepared for each of the five investment components and \nreviewed and approved by the respective environmental protection bureau. GZARG disclosed \nrelevant environment information to environmentally affected people through consultations in \nApril\u2013October 2010 and the results and findings were reflected in the EIAs and the project \ndesign. A project EIA, including an environmental management plan (EMP) and environmental \nmonitoring  program,  assesses  the  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  urban  road \nnetworks and the WWTP during construction and operation of project facilities.21 The main \nidentified environmental impacts relate to air, water and noise pollution, solid waste disposal, \nand borrow and spoil management during project construction. The EMP fully addresses these \nimpacts as well as occupational health and safety issues to ensure residual environmental \nimpacts are insignificant. In addition to addressing common environmental protection issues, the \nproject also demonstrates good environmental due diligence practice by pursuing measures to \nenhance  environmental  management  on  an  existing  nature  reserve.  The  municipal \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  will  support  the  municipal  governments  and  the  PICs  in \n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nimplementing the EMPs. Capacity building in environmental management will be provided for \nGZARG, the municipal governments, and the PICs. An environmental monitoring report will be \nprepared by GZARG and submitted to ADB semiannually during implementation and annually \nfor 2 years after project completion. A grievance redress mechanism was established under \nGZARG, the municipal governments, and the PICs to receive and redress public grievances \nrelated to environment. The EIA was circulated to the ADB Board of Directors and made publicly \navailable through the ADB website on 10 December 2010. \n \n21.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  under  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguard category A.22 Five resettlement plans were approved by ADB on 7 January 2011, \ndisclosed to affected persons, and uploaded to the ADB website on 25 January 2011.23 Overall, \nthe project will acquire 5,288.55 mu of land permanently, of which 30.36% is classified as \nfarmland.24 Permanent land acquisition will affect 4,555 persons. Temporary acquisition of 469 \nmu of land will affect 3,173 persons. A total of 1,045 persons will be relocated and about 34,804 \nsquare  meters  of  residential  and  non-residential  buildings  will  be  demolished.  Removal  of \n546.62 mu of shrimp aquaculture ponds will affect the livelihoods of 155 persons. In addition, \nassociated productive assets, ground attachments, and basic infrastructure facilities will also be \naffected. The levels of compensation are based on the relevant PRC regulations, which were \nconfirmed to be adequate after consultation with local governments and those affected, and \nconsidering  general  practice  in  project  cities.  The  implementation  of  the  project\u2019s  five \nresettlement plans will be monitored and evaluated internally and externally. The municipal \ngovernments  will  report  implementation  progress  regularly  to  GZARG,  which  in  turn  will \nsummarize the land acquisition and resettlement progress in the quarterly progress report to \nADB. The Guangxi project management office will also engage an independent external monitor \nwho will (i) review resettlement progress and the general welfare of affected persons, (ii) make \nrecommendations to resolve any issues or problems, and (iii) provide advice to GZARG and the \nmunicipal governments. The external monitor will pay special attention to vulnerable groups, \nincluding the poor, women, and the ethnic minorities, to assess whether they have fully regained \ntheir standard of living. Monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared semiannually during \nimplementation and annually for 2 years after resettlement is completed. They will be submitted \nto  ADB  and  published  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  project  has  also  established  a  transparent \ngrievance channel that will (i) provide a meaningful consultation mechanism and (ii) trigger \nremedial action by GZARG and the municipal governments. \n \n22.  Indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  under  indigenous  people  safeguard \ncategory C. Ethnic minorities, predominantly from the Zhuang ethnic group, make up 23.7% of \nthe urban population. The poverty and social assessment survey and consultations concluded \nthat all urban beneficiaries, including ethnic minorities in the project areas, will benefit from the \ninfrastructure improvements. There will be no adverse impacts other than resettlement for 13 \nethnic  minority  households.  This  will  be  addressed  under  the  resettlement  plan  for  the \nFangchenggang Fangcheng\u2013Jiangshan road and related infrastructure component. The overall \nproject design includes prioritization of ethnic minorities for construction jobs and O&M activities \nand  the  use  of  the  local  language,  where  necessary,  in  communication  and  outreach  for \ninvoluntary resettlement consultations. \n                                                \n22 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) adjusted the terminology for involuntary resettlement, changing \"affected  \npersons\" to \"displaced persons,\" who were defined as persons physically and/or economically displaced due to \ninvoluntary acquisition of land or involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally designated parks and \nprotected areas. Although resettlement plans for ADB projects in the PRC maintain the original terminology of \n\u201caffected persons,\u201d this is equivalent to the new Safeguard Policy Statement definition of \u201cdisplaced persons.\u201d \n24 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.667 square meters). \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n23.  The  overall  risk  assessment  was  reduced  to  low  through  the  formulation  of  risk \nmanagement measures to be implemented prior, during, and after project implementation. Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.25 The project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh costs and risks. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWastewater treatment plant  (i) Capacity building on various aspects of O&M for the wastewater \nO&M not implemented  treatment plant. \neffectively  (ii) Provision of subsidies from Fangchenggang municipal government to \nsupport the sustainable operation of the wastewater treatment plant. \nDelayed land acquisition  (i) Early availability of compensation for affected persons. \napprovals and  (ii) Knowledge transfer from other cities in Guangxi with on-going ADB-\nimplementation  financed projects. \nLack of project coordination  (i) Coordination support from the project management consulting service. \nand synchronization  (ii) Close project implementation monitoring by frequent site inspections \nbetween agencies  and regular coordination meetings. \nCost higher than expected  (i) Rigorous technical reviews during detailed design to estimate \nprovisional contract prices.  \n(ii) Additional counterpart funds, as necessary, to finance cost overruns. \nADB=Asian Development Bank, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n24.  The national government and GZARG have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n25.
