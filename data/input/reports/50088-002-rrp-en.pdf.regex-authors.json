THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the Upscaling Renewable Energy Sector Project. The report also describes the \nproposed administration of grants to be provided by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF)1 and the \nJapan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM) for the project, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration of the SCF and JFJCM grants. \n \n2.  The project will (i) support the Government of Mongolia\u2019s policy of decarbonizing the \nenergy system in remote and less-developed regions; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity to \nimplement the State Policy on Energy, 2015\u20132030,2 and Mongolia\u2019s Nationally Determined \nContribution under the Paris climate accord of 2015,3 which set the targets of increasing the share \nof renewable energy capacity in total installed capacity to 20% by 2023 and to 30% by 2030. The \nproject will develop a 41 megawatt (MW) first-of-its-kind distributed renewable energy system with \na variety of renewable energy technologies supplying clean electricity and heat in geographically \nscattered load centers in the less-developed region of western Mongolia. Once completed, the \nproject will generate 99 gigawatt-hours of clean electricity yearly, thereby enabling the country to \nreduce its carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by 87,968 tons per year.4 \n2\n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Sector Performance \n3.  Growing power demand since 2007 has stressed the country\u2019s power system. Mongolia \nhas a total of 1,158 MW of installed capacity, but because of aging power facilities that are well \npast their economic life, only 969 MW is available. Electricity imports met about 20% of power \ndemand in 2017.5 The country\u2019s energy sector relies heavily on coal-fired power generation, \nwhich accounts for 91% of total installed capacity and contributes over 63% of CO  emissions. \n2\nMongolia is the world\u2019s fifth most carbon-intensive economy, but has tremendous renewable \nenergy potential, which could theoretically meet all domestic demand. Promoting a diversified \nenergy mix with a higher share of renewable energy is a core priority of the government, both to \nreduce dependence on high-cost imported electricity and to decarbonize the energy sector. \n \n4.  Since 2000, the Government of Mongolia has taken several initiatives for renewable \nenergy  deployment,  most  notably  (i)  implementing  the  successful  100,000  Solar  Ger \nElectrification Program (2000\u20132012), which provides nomadic herders with access to modern \nenergy through solar home systems; and (ii) passing the Law on Renewable Energy (2007, \namended in 2015), which has facilitated the development of 137 MW of renewable energy power \nplants through a set of regulatory arrangements with a United States dollar-denominated feed-in-\ntariff (FIT). However, the  share of renewable energy in total  installed capacity is still only 12%. \n                                                \n1 Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries (SREP). \n2  Government of Mongolia, 2015.

ADB. 2016. Technical \nAssistance to Mongolia for Preparing the Upscaling Renewable Energy Sector Project. Manila. \n5  Energy Regulatory Commission of Mongolia. 2017. Statistics of Energy Performance. Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "2 \n2.  Sector Challenges and Opportunities \n5.  The country\u2019s power system consists of four grid systems, which have successfully \nexpanded electricity access to 97% of the population.6 The central energy system, covering \naround 90% of power demand, has attracted private sector-led renewable energy projects totaling \naround 400 MW, of which 120 MW have been commissioned. At the same time, other grid \nsystems in the western Mongolia, which supply power to 25% of the population in the country and \nhave exhibited annual demand growth of more than 10% between 2010 and 2015, have not \nattracted any private investment in utility-scale grid-connected renewable energy development, \nmainly because of the relatively small size of power demand in geographically scattered load \ndemand centers. Inadequate investment in power generation capacity addition for remote grid \nsystems has led to heavy dependence on imported electricity from neighboring countries across \nlong stretches of transmission lines, accounting for around 30% of transmission and distribution \nlosses.7 To address such unique challenges in remote grid systems, the government has sought \nto develop a distributed energy system using a variety of renewable energy technologies and \nresources comprising smaller-scale and modular plants to produce reliable electricity for local use \nwhile reducing electricity imports. \n \n6.  The government has a coherent policy framework to guide renewable energy deployment, \nwhich is being implemented. In 2015, the government issued its Intended Nationally Determined \nContribution to the Paris climate accord (footnote 3), which would reduce CO  emissions by 14% \n2\nby 2030 compared with the business-as-usual scenario through renewable energy capacity \nexpansion, transmission and distribution loss reduction, and other energy efficiency measures. In \nparallel, the State Policy on Energy, approved by the Parliament in 2015, is aimed at achieving \nenergy independence and increasing renewable energy capacity to 20% of total installed capacity \nby 2023 and 30% by 2030. \n \n7.  As part of the overall policy framework in support of renewable energy development, the \ngovernment prepared the renewable energy investment plan in 2015, with the assistance of \nmultilateral development banks.8 The investment plan will help meet medium- and long-term \nrenewable energy targets through a two-track approach: (i) strengthening the energy policy and \nregulatory  framework  to  stimulate  private  sector-led  development;  and  (ii)  scaling  up  rural \nrenewable energy in remote grid systems through the development of a distributed renewable \nenergy system in remote and less-developed regions of western Mongolia. In November 2015, \nthe investment plan was endorsed by the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income \nCountries (SREP) subcommittee, with total indicative grant financing of $30 million.9 \n \n                                                \n6  United Nations Development Programme and National Statistical Office of Mongolia. 2012. Millennium Development \nGoals and Poverty Map-2011. Ulaanbaatar.  \n7  Imported electricity meets around 70% of electricity demand in western and Altai-Uliastai regions. 95% of electricity \nhas been imported from the Siberian grid of the Russian Federation with an emission factor of 1.02 tons of CO2 \nequivalent per megawatt-hour. \n8  ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. \n9  The SREP is a Climate Investment Fund subprogram that supports transformation in eligible developing countries \nthrough the deployment of scaled-up renewable energy solutions. The first pillar of the investment plan is being \nimplemented with $1.2 million in World Bank TA to support regulatory framework strengthening, including grid control, \nlicensing, and FIT adjustments. SREP grant cofinancing of $28.5 million supports project preparatory TA ($1.5 \nmillion), and distributed renewable energy development under ADB ($14.6 million) and the World Bank ($12.4 \nmillion). \n \n ", "3 \n3.  Sector Loan Modality and Asian Development Bank Interventions \n8.  The project is targeted at geographically scattered demand centers in the less-developed \nregion of western Mongolia. These regions are vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations, which \nmake livelihoods more fragile and the regions more likely to fall back into poverty. In the ongoing \neconomic downturn since 2015, poverty incidence in western Mongolia has worsened, rising to \n41.0% in 2017 from 26.0% in 2014.10 The project will be implemented under the sector loan \nmodality of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for more flexible project implementation. The \napproach is deemed suitable as it will (i) ensure the grid stability based upon actual core \nsubproject impacts upon the grid; (ii) minimize the complexity of subproject implementation \nbecause of the wide range of location-specific demand and grid conditions; and (iii) appropriately \nenhance the capacity of local utilities to manage the grid system through learning by doing. The \nproject will also help (i) develop technical capacity in local utilities and national dispatching centers \nto manage renewable electricity connections to the existing grid, (ii) prepare an investment plan \nup to 2030, and (iii) facilitate policy reform to establish a FIT adjustment mechanism to give private \ninvestors appropriate incentives, through output 3, for the sustainable scaling up of distributed \nrenewable energy systems.  \n \n9.  The project will help remove barriers to future private investment through (i) demonstrating \nsuccessful distributed utility-scale solar photovoltaic and wind power plants; and (ii) building \nappropriate financial incentives. Once it is completed in 2023, the project will deliver (i) confidence \nin using distributed renewable energy systems for future expansion, (ii) enhanced capacity among \ngrid operators and local utilities to absorb progressively greater amounts of renewable energy into \nthe grid, and (iii) needed capacity expansion to help meet the renewable energy target for 2030 \n(para. 6). \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s Energy Policy supports the project rationale by promoting renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency, access to energy, and sector reforms to catalyze private sector development.11 \nThe  project  is fully  aligned  with  the  policies  of  the government  and  its  renewable  energy \ninvestment plan in 2015 (paras. 6\u20137), and with Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access \nto affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. \n \n4.  Development Partner Coordination \n11.  In 2017, the World Bank approved $12.4 million in SCF grant funding for the construction \nof a 10 MW solar photovoltaic power plant in Hovd, western region.12 ADB and the World Bank \nprojects will be administered by a single project steering committee under the Ministry of Energy \n(MOE) to minimize project administration-related transaction costs, and to allow for the sharing of \nlessons  learned  and  issues resolved  during  subproject  implementation for  effective  project \nadministration. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: greenhouse gas emissions reduced and \nimported electricity reduced.  The project will have the following outcome: clean sources of energy \nsupply in the country increased.13 \n \n                                                \n10 Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 ADB. 2009.

Output 1: Distributed renewable energy system developed. A total of 40.5 MW of solar \nphotovoltaic and wind power subprojects will be set up in the western and Altai\u2013Uliastai regions. \nThe project will also demonstrate advanced battery storage technology with energy management \nsystems, a first-of-its kind application in the country.14 The subprojects will be implemented in two \nbatches: (i) core subprojects with 25.5 MW of capacity in the first batch (2018\u20132021); and (ii) \nnoncore subprojects with 15 MW of capacity in the second batch (2019\u20132022), as detailed in \nTable 1.15 \n \n14.  Output 2: Shallow-ground heat pump system developed. In selected targeted regions, \n500 kilowatts-thermal of shallow-ground heat pump capacity will be installed in public buildings in \nthree batches.16 This will supply air pollutant-free space heating for 10,000 square meters of floor \narea. The subprojects will demonstrate the performance of the heat pump systems and increase \nexperience in design, installation, operation, and maintenance for future scale-up. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Institutional  framework  strengthened  and  organizational  capacity \nenhanced. This output will (i) enhance the technical capacity of local utilities and the national \ndispatching center for renewable energy investment planning, renewable electricity dispatching, \nand grid control and protection; (ii) support the preparation of a renewable energy investment plan \n(2023\u20132030) for the targeted regions; and (iii) support the project management unit for the project \nimplementation. It will also support the evolution of the FIT system into a more economically \nefficient tariff mechanism that reflects actual capital costs, while ensuring sufficient commercial \nfinancial viability.   \n \nTable 1: Subprojects \nCapacity  Construction \nLocation and Province  Applied Renewable Energy Technology  (MW)  Period \nOutput 1: Distributed renewable energy system developed \nUmunogovi, Uvs  Wind power  10.0  2018\u20132021 \nAltai City, Govi\u2013Altai  Solar PV  10.0  2018\u20132021 \nAltai soum (county), Govi\u2013Altai  Solar PV and wind with battery storage  0.5  2018\u20132021 \nUliastai, Zavha  Solar PV and battery storage  5.0  2018\u20132021 \nTelmen, Zavhan  Wind power  5.0  2019\u20132022 \nMoron, Khovsgol  Solar PV  10.0  2019\u20132022 \nSubtotal  40.5   \nOutput 2: Shallow-ground heat pump system developed \nHovd, the other soums  Shallow-ground heat pump         0.5  2018\u20132023 \n(counties) \nTotal  41.0   \nMW = megawatt, PV = photovoltaic. \nSource: Project feasibility study report approved by the Ministry of Energy in 2018. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n23.  Resource assessment, grid stability, system design. A comprehensive renewable \nenergy resource assessment was done for each core subproject site. Intermittency of renewable \npower generation could result in variability of frequency and voltage. As the project is designed \nas a distributed renewable energy system, the transmission grids in the targeted sites in western \nMongolia should be able to respond to such variability. Existing hydropower plants and the battery \nstorage system to be installed under the project will also be able to make up for the intermittence \nof renewable energy sources and ensure electricity supply throughout the day. An assessment of \nnecessary generation capacity and system configuration design was made, considering solar and \nwind resources, peak load demand, and grid stability. The subprojects under output 1 (distributed \nrenewable energy system developed) will include remote control, monitoring, and protection \nsystems to stabilize the grid in line with international design standards. Capital cost estimates \nwere based on current international market prices plus  the necessary costs for associated \nfacilities, transportation, and insurance. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Financial analysis of the project indicated a financial internal rate of return of 7.42%, which \nis higher the corresponding weighted average cost of capital of 4.77%. Sensitivity analysis \nshowed that financial internal rates of return would be (i) 6.37% when project capital costs \nincrease by 10%, (ii) 7.25% when operation and maintenance (O&M) costs increase by 10%, and \n(iii) 6.01% if the energy yield decreases by 10%. The project\u2019s overall financial viability is sensitive \nto changes in capital cost and energy yield, but remains robust under all scenarios. \n \n25.  Economic analysis of the project indicated an economic internal rate of return of 15.18% \nwith environmental benefit, which is higher the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9.00%. \n ", "8 \nSensitivity analysis showed that economic internal rates of return with environmental benefit \nwould be (i) 13.74% when project capital costs increase by 10%, (ii) 15.08% when O&M costs \nincrease by 10%, (iii) 13.49% if the energy yield decreases by 10%, and (iv) 14.25% if the \nimported electricity tariff decreases by 10%. The project\u2019s economic viability is also robust under \nall adverse scenarios. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  Financial management assessments were conducted for MOE, WRES, AUES, and NREC, \nand overall financial management risk is assessed moderate. The financial management and \naccounting procedures are aligned with the regulations and policies issued by the Ministry of \nFinance, and are considered effective and adequate for the project. However, since WRES, AUES, \nand NREC have no prior experience in ADB-financed projects, continuous capacity enhancement \ntrainings in financial management for the implementing agencies are essential. These agencies \nhave developed and maintained financial management monitoring and supervision structures for \nbudgeting, asset management, fund management, internal and external auditing, and reporting, \nwith internal financial management rules and a centrally managed online financial management \nsystem. The assessments indicated that (i) accrual-based accounting and international financial \nreporting standards are being followed by the agencies; (ii) the separation of authorization, \ntransaction, recording, and asset management functions is well established; and (iii) robust \nfinancial management and internal auditing systems are in place. However, business operations \nof the implementing agencies have been largely dependent on the government subsidy because \nof low level of end user\u2019s tariff. Improving financial sustainability of the implementing agencies \nthrough a tariff increase while ensuring affordability for end users is essential to meet the net profit \nmargin targets in 2023 and 2030.18 \n  \n27.  Procurement capacity assessments were also carried out for MOE, WRES, AUES, and \nNREC, and overall procurement risk is assessed moderate. The four entities have experienced \nand trained personnel in procurement and contract management, supported by well-established \ninternal procedures and management systems. The accountability mechanism is also deemed \neffective to perform procurement and contract award, disbursement, and internal audit activities. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment, WRES, AUES, and NREC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. Integrity due diligence for related risk analysis for WRES, \nAUES, and NREC were carried out and assessed low risk. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The project will directly benefit 258,313 people (118,960 of whom are women), or 50% of \nthe population in the project areas, through distributed renewable energy system development. \nBy providing cleaner and more affordable electricity while reducing air pollution associated with \ncoal use in power generation, the project will have a positive social impact. A side benefit will be \nthe generation of employment opportunities for the local population: 2,365 person-months of \nunskilled labor per year during construction and 450 jobs per year during O&M. Priority will be \ngiven to low-income and unemployed women in local communities adjacent to the project sites. \n \n                                                \n18 The State Policy on Energy, 2015-2030 (para. 6) includes the financial sustainability targets of public utilities: 0% net \nprofit margin by 2023 and 5% by 2030. \n \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n30.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  the  core \nsubprojects (paras. 13 and 14), including an environmental management plan (EMP), has been \nprepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national environmental regulations. \nEnvironmental audits of the existing facilities have been conducted. The IEE will be updated after \nthe completion of detailed design, if needed. Domestic environmental clearance was obtained in \nJune 2018. An environmental and social assessment and review framework was drawn up to \nguide the selection and environmental assessment of subsequent noncore subprojects. Both the \nIEE and environmental and social assessment and review framework were disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite upon obtaining the domestic environmental clearance.20 Meaningful public consultation \nhas been conducted and information disclosure requirements have been met. Grievance redress \nmechanisms will be established by the implementing agencies. Potential impacts, including soil \nerosion, construction noise and dust, waste generation, and effects on community and worker \nhealth and safety, are mostly temporary, predictable, and reversible, and can be mitigated through \nregulatory  compliance  and  through  EMP  implementation.  Sensitive  ecosystems  will  not  be \naffected. Core subproject sites are far from sensitive receptors, which helps to minimize noise, \nshadow flicker, glare, and blade throw risks. Sufficient budgets have been allocated in the EMP \nto ensure the proper implementation of mitigation and monitoring measures. Capacity building \nprograms  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  that  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and \ncontractors are able to undertake all construction and operation activities following the IEE and \nEMP.  Environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  every  6  months  during \nconstruction and every year during operation. Contractors will be required to comply with the EMP \nduring the preconstruction and construction stages. The EMP will be updated as necessary if \nunanticipated  impact  is  identified  during  implementation.  The  executing  and  implementing \nagencies have agreed on a comprehensive set of environment-related loan covenants and \ntraining programs in environmental safeguards. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C) and indigenous peoples (category C). The \nproject will not entail permanent or temporary land acquisition, land use restriction, demolition of \nstructures, or relocation of people. All subproject sites are either within existing substation \npremises or on government-owned land. The project will be implemented in ethnically diverse \nprovincial capitals and townships with no boundaries between majority and minority groups, \nwhether in lifestyle, socioeconomic status, or vulnerability. No impact on ethnic minorities is \ntherefore expected. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n32.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n   \n                                                \n19 ADB.

The integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n34.  The government and WRES, AUES, and NREC have assured ADB that implementation \nof  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government and the \nWRES, AUES, and NREC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the draft loan agreement, grant agreements, and project agreement. \n \n35.  The loan effectiveness is conditional on the effectiveness of the (i) SCF grant agreement \nbetween ADB and the borrower, and (ii) JFJCM grant agreement between ADB and the borrower. \nThe disbursement is also conditional on the borrower\u2019s certification that a relending arrangement \nfor the loan and an arrangement for passing on the grants are in place. \n  \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.
