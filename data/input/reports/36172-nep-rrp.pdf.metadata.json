The rationale for this program also stems from the fact that the country \nwill  soon  have  a  federal  form  of  government  in  which  subnational \ngovernments will play major roles in local development. Thus, strengthening \nlocal  governance  is  a  must.  Finally,  the  present  context  in  Nepal  demands \nreforms in local governance and community development  that are medium \nto long term, which justifies the program cluster approach of the GSP. \n \nThe  GSP  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  on  devolution  and \nsubnational governance and contributes directly to desired outcomes in local \ngovernance and community development.  \n \nThe  proposed  program  cluster  for  supporting  local  governance  and \ncommunity  development  in  Nepal  will  offer  phased  assistance  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  short-  to  medium-term  reform  plans  in  this  sector.  The \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nSubprogram I \nGrant \n \nImpact and \nOutcomes \n\nexpected  impact  of  the  GSP  will  be  social  and  economic  transformation  in \nNepal  through  (i)  capable  and  accountable  government  at  all  levels  that \nprovides  effective  and  inclusive  services,  and  (ii)  empowered  communities \nthat  engage  actively  with  government  to  hold  it  accountable.  ADB  will \ndevelop two subprograms to support the attainment of these outcomes. \n \nSubprogram  I  (SP1)  (2008\u20132012)  will  emphasize  community  mobilization \nand  strengthening  to  hold  local  bodies  accountable,  strengthening  their \ncapability to provide effective and inclusive services and instituting relevant \nprotocols  and  systems  in  the  central  Government  to  support  the  local \ngovernance  reform  agenda.  Subprogram \nII  (SP2)  (2012\u20132015)  will \nconcentrate on the business process reengineering needed at the center to \nsupport a federal government structure, putting in place the legal framework \nfor  proper  local  governance,  strengthening  the  fiscal  transfer  process  and \nsystem, and then strengthening community organizations and local bodies. \n \n \n\n \nSP1  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  national  Local  Governance  and \nCommunity Development Program (LGCDP), which will contribute to poverty \nreduction  through  inclusive,  responsive,  and  accountable  local  governance \nand  participatory,  community-led  development.  There  are  three  main \noutcomes  that  SP1  will  contribute  to  through  its  support  to  the  LGCDP:  (i) \ncitizens  and  communities  engage  actively  with  local  bodies  and  hold  them \naccountable; (ii) better management of resources and delivery of services in \nan  inclusive  and  equitable  manner  by  capable  local  bodies;  and  (iii) \nstrengthened  policy  and  national  institutional  frameworks,  including  legal \nframeworks, for decentralization, devolution, and community development.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAmount and \nTerms \n\nFinancing Plan  SP1 will finance a portion of the expenses for the LGCDP, whose total costs \nare  approximately  $470.0  million.  ADB  will  finance  $106.3  million  of  these \ncosts,  the  Government  will  provide  $260.8  million,  and  the  rest  will  be \nfinanced  through  assistance  from  other  development  partners  that  have \nexpressed their commitment of support through a signed letter of intent. \n \nIt is proposed that the ADB support the Government\u2019s efforts to reform local \ngovernance  and  community  development  by  providing  a  program  grant  of \n$106.3  million  for  SP1  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  recipient  will \nbe the Government of Nepal. The grant proceeds are expected to be utilized \nfor 48 months from the date of effectiveness. \n \nThe grant will be provided in three tranches. The first tranche, not exceeding \n$20.0  million,  will  be  disbursed  upon  grant  effectiveness.  The  second \ntranche,  not  exceeding  $45.0  million,  will  be  disbursed  upon  finalization  of \nthe  joint  financing  arrangement  (JFA)  between  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners for the LGCDP and will be subject to the Government \nfulfilling  all  second  tranche  release  requirements.  The  third  tranche,  not \nexceeding $41.3 million, will be disbursed within 12 months after the second \ntranche and upon satisfactory fulfillment of all corresponding tranche release \nrequirements. \n\nSubprogram I \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \n\n\fExecuting \nAgency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \nand \nDisbursement \n\nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nMitigating \nMeasures \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD)  is  the  Executing  Agency. \nImplementing agencies include the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction for \nwork  related  to  the  local  peace  committees  and  such  participating  local \nbodies  as  district  development  committees,  village  development \ncommittees, and municipalities. Civil society organizations and private firms \nwill  implement  parts  of  the  GSP  that  are  outsourced  by  local  bodies.  A \nnational  advisory  committee  at  the  center  has  been  established  for  overall \ncoordination,  policy  advocacy,  and  supervision  of  the  LGCDP.  A  program \ncoordination  unit  in  MLD  is  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  coordination  of \nGSP work nationally. Local development officers will coordinate the program \nin  districts,  as  will  executive  officers  in  municipalities  and  secretaries  in \nvillage development committees. \n \nIn the initial stages of SP1, the JFA will be prepared by the Government and \nparticipating  development  partners  to  guide  implementation  arrangements \nfor the LGCDP. \n \nThe proceeds of the SP1 grant will finance the full foreign exchange costs, \nexcluding  local  duties  and  taxes,  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember countries other than items specified in the list of ineligible items in \nAppendix  8  and  imports  financed  from  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loan, the \nproceeds  of  the  SP1  grant  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Federal  Democratic \nRepublic  of  Nepal  as  the  Grant  Recipient.  The  Grant  Recipient  will  certify \nthat  the  volume  of  eligible  imports exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected \ndisbursement  under  the  SP1  grant  for  the  given  period.  ADB  reserves  the \nright to audit the use of grant proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Grant \nRecipient\u2019s certification. \n \nThe  local  currency  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be \nused by the Government to strictly implement the sector reforms specified in \nthe LGCDP document. \n \nThe  SP1  grant  will  support  LGCDP  improvements  in  the  effectiveness  of \nlocal  service  delivery  through  strong  local  bodies  and  engaged  and  strong \ncommunity organizations. In the medium term, this is expected to bring good \nlocal  governance  and,  ultimately,  inclusive  development.  Beneficiaries \ninclude \nlocal  government  administrations,  community  organizations, \nwomen\u2019s and disadvantaged groups, midlevel agencies such as local body \ntraining  centers,  and  central  Government \nassociations  and  regional \nagencies. Local service recipients and citizens will also benefit from SP1. \n \nThe  main  assumptions  for  SP1  are  that  (i)  the  elected  Government  will \nremain  committed  to  reforms  in  local  governance,  as  evidenced  in  the \nLGCDP,  and  the  process  of  making  Nepal  a  federal  republic  will  proceed \nsmoothly; (ii) development partners remain engaged, as will be reflected in \ntheir  continued  presence  in  the  JFA  when  it  is  prepared;  (iii)  the  political \nsystem  will  be  stable  during  subprogram  implementation;  and  (iv)  the \ncountry\u2019s \nfinancial \nintergovernmental \nmanagement systems are fairly robust.  \n\nfiscal  arrangements  and  public \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks that may occur are mitigated by (i) the presence of political consensus \nacross all parties on the move toward a federal structure, and (ii) the intent \nof a range of development partners to support the LGCDP, as confirmed in \nthe  letter  of  intent.  The  fiduciary  risks  identified  in  the  2007  assessment  of \npublic  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  have  been  responded  to  in \nthe  form  of  an  action  plan  currently  being  prioritized  by  the  Financial \nComptroller General\u2019s Office and expected to be available by end-2008. The \nresulting  public  financial  management  reform  agenda  is  likely  to  include  (i) \nadjustments  to  the  budget  classification  system  to  bring  it  fully  in  line  with \ninternational  government  financial  statistics  standards,  (ii)  support  to  the \nOffice  of  the  Auditor  General,  and  (iii)  refinements  to  the  existing \ncomputerized  financial  information  system.  The  prioritized  action  plan \nprovides  a  platform  upon  which  to  base  a  coherent  approach  to  public \nfinancial  management \nlocal \ngovernments is provided through the extensive due diligence constraints of \nthe  performance-based  funding  modality  that  will  be  rolled  out  under  the \nLGCDP. \n \nAdditional  mitigating  measures  include  instituting  public  and  social  audits \nwidely so that the public has access to information necessary to monitor the \nperformance of local bodies. \n\nreforms.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Assessment and Outlook \n\n2. \nBetween  2005  and  2007,  economic  growth  in  Nepal  averaged  only  2.8%  per  annum, \nwell  short  of  even  the  pessimistic  scenario  of  the  tenth  plan,  which  had  targeted  4.3%.2 The \ngrowth of the gross domestic product (GDP) steadily slowed from 3.1% in fiscal year (FY) 2005 \nto 2.8% in FY2006 and 2.5% in FY2007. In the current fiscal year, however, the economy grew \nat  5.6%,  propelled  by  strong  growth  in  agriculture  and  other  sectors.  This  is  the  fastest \neconomic expansion in the past 7 years. The service sector, particularly tourism, has performed \nbetter than expected, but industrial growth has stagnated. The country\u2019s per capita income now \nstands at $470. \n  \nFairly  sound  macroeconomic  policies  have  helped  preserve  macroeconomic  stability \n3. \nduring  this  period.  With  the  resolution  of  the  internal  conflict,  the  Government  of  Nepal  (the \nGovernment) adopted an increasingly expansionary fiscal policy,3 but strong tax administration \nand  sustained  donor  assistance  were  sufficient  to  mitigate  the  adverse  effects  of  this  policy. \nInflationary  pressures  exist  nevertheless.  While  the  rate  of  inflation  averaged  6.3%  during \nFY2005\u2013FY2007,  by  mid-May  2008  it  had  reached  9.2%.  Still,  sustained  current  account \nsurpluses  and  aid-related  capital  inflows  have  facilitated  continued  balance  of  payments \nsurpluses.4 Remittance inflows have emerged as the major source of foreign exchange earnings, \nwhile merchandise exports have stagnated.  \n \n4. \nEconomic  growth  is  expected  to  be  around  4%  per  annum  in  the  coming  year,  but \nindustrial  growth  is  likely  to  be  constrained  by  fuel  and  power  shortages,  continued  political \nuncertainty,  and  structural  weaknesses  in  the  economy.  Macroeconomic  stability  in  the  period \nahead  will  depend  largely  on  a  continued  prudent  policy  stance,  particularly  in  addressing \nemerging  challenges  posed  by  new  fiscal  pressures  from  the  peace  process,  including  those \nrelated  to  Government  commitments  resulting  from  various  political  compromises;  higher  food \nand fuel prices; and chronic fuel and power shortages. \n \nB. \n\nStatus of Spatial Poverty Reduction \n\nThe Nepal Living Standards Survey in 2003/04 showed the poverty incidence declining \n5. \nsharply  from  42%  in  1996  to  31%  in  2004,  driven  by  growth  in  per  capita  consumption  and \nincome,  each  averaging  4.5%  per  annum.  Nepal  may  have  made  progress  in  human\n\n                                                 \n1  This analysis is drawn largely from the Asian Development Bank Country Partnership Strategy Mid-Term Review \n\nfor Nepal in June 2008. \n\n2  The tenth plan had envisaged two economic growth scenarios: (i) 6.2% based on an expected improvement in the \n\nsecurity situation, and (ii) 4.3% assuming continuation of the conflict. \n\n3  The Government doubled the budget deficit after grants from less than 1% of GDP in FY2004 to 2% in FY2007. \n4  However, the current account surplus weakened to 0.5% of GDP in FY2007 from over 2% in earlier years, due to a \n\nwidening trade deficit. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\ndevelopment,5 but the spatial incidence of poverty and depravation is a cause for rising concern. \nThe country continues to have stark and widening socioeconomic disparities. The Nepal Living \nStandards Survey shows that income inequality increased significantly, with the Gini Coefficient \nrising  from  34.2%  in  1996  to  41.1%  in  2004.  Further,  the  11  percentage  point  drop  in  poverty \nwas unevenly distributed geographically and across caste, ethnic, and minority groups. Poverty \nlevels  are  still  high  in  rural  areas,  especially  in  the  Midwestern  region  (45%)  and  Farwestern \nregion  (41%).  Poverty  is  much  worse  among  lower  caste  and  minority  groups,  such  as  Dalits, \nhill Janajatis, and Muslims (all above 40%), than in upper caste groups such as Brahmins and \nChettris (19%) and Newars (14%). Gender disparities are stark, as women lag far behind men in \nall spheres of life despite efforts to improve equality.6  \n \n6. \nThis untenable situation has to be seen in the context of the political changes that have \nbeen  the  hallmark  of  Nepali  life  in  recent  years.  For  particular  political  parties,  the  economic \nstraitjacket is juxtaposed with the need for dramatic and fundamental political reforms. Now that \nthe country has moved from having a monarchy to being a federal democratic republic, and now \nthat there is an elected government in place, a new economic model may well evolve that will \nseek to fundamentally realign the political economy of the country. \n \n7. \nThe  main  tasks  facing  Nepal  at  present  are  (i)  formulating  a  new  constitution  that \nformalizes  the  recent  political  changes  in  the  country;  (ii)  restructuring  the  state,  including \ntranslating the vision of federalism into a more practical reality, while engendering public trust in \ngovernment  and,  in  the  process,  giving  a  peace  dividend  to  the  people;  (iii)  reenergizing  the \neconomy to capitalize on the more favorable political situation; and (iv) providing services in an \ninclusive manner so that the numerous disadvantaged groups (DAGs) can enter the economic \nand political mainstream of national life. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR7 \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n \n1. \n\nPolitical Context \n\n \nAfter  multiparty  democracy  was  introduced  in  1990,  the  political  situation  in  Nepal \n8. \ndisplayed  dual  tendencies  toward  a  lack  of  credibility  in  political  parties,  which  were  rendered \nineffective  largely  by  their  constant  bickering  among  one  another,  and  the  continued \nmarginalization of large segments of the population. In the mid-1990s, the Communist Party of \n\n                                                 \n5   The  child  mortality  rate  declined  from  91  per  1,000  live  births  in  2001  to  48  in  FY2006/07,  the  mortality  rate  for \ninfants below 1 year fell from 64 to 34 in the same period, and the maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births fell \nfrom  539  to  281  over  the  last  decade.  From  2001  to  2006,  the  adult  literacy  rate  improved  from  43%  to  52%, \nprimary  school  net  enrollment  increased  from  80%  to  87%,  and  the  proportion  of  the  population  with  access  to \nimproved  water  supply  increased  from  72%  to  77%  and  with  improved  sanitation  from  28%  to  46%.  These  are \nimpressive  numbers,  particularly  as  conflict  existed  in  Nepal  for  more  than  a  decade  (National  Planning \nCommission, 2007. Three Year Interim Plan (2007/08-2009/10). Kathmandu (December)). \n\n6  The  gender-related  development  index  (GDI)  and  gender  empowerment  measure  for  Nepal  have  not  moved  up \nsignificantly,  currently  at  0.391  and  0.452  respectively  (National  Human  Development  Report,  2004).  However, \nconsiderable disparities in both indices exist both within and across geographic regions. According to the National \nPlanning Commission (2007), the GDI value is higher in urban areas (0.562) than in rural areas (0.430) and in the \nhills (0.973) than in the terai (0.943) or in the mountains (0.941). The assessment of the tenth plan indicates that \nthe decline in poverty in the past decade has not been even for different groups and regions. Women in general\u2014\nand women from the Midwestern and Farwestern regions in particular\u2014remain  excluded from access to services \nand economic opportunities. \n\n7  Taken  to  mean  local  governance  and  community  development,  which  encompasses,  inter  alia,  decentralization \nand  devolution,  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers,  local  administration,  and  community  action  for  development.  It \nexcludes  governance  components  such  as  the  electoral  system,  human  rights,  police  reforms,  or  political  party \nreforms. Appendix 2 contains a more detailed sector analysis. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\nNepal  (Maoist)  (CPN[M])  splintered  from  the  core  alliance  of  leftist  parties  and  initiated  a \n\u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d against what it termed the feudal state. In the decade-old conflict, 11,715 people \nwere reported killed and 19,000 displaced.8 Physical losses have been estimated at Rs5 billion \n(approximately $68 million), not to mention the untold misery and agony of thousands of people \naffected by the conflict. In February 2005, the King took over the reins of power with a promise \nto  steady  the  political  situation  and  resolve  the  matter  of  the  insurgency.  His  attempts  failed, \nhowever.  A  mere  14  months  after  his  takeover,  all  the  political  parties\u2014in  alliance  with \nCPN(M)\u2014united  to  force  the  King\u2019s  hand  to  reinstate  Parliament,  and  soon  the  decade-long \nconflict came to an end. \n \n9. \nSince then, political governance has been characterized by attempts to steer the country \ntoward a different political landscape. At the core of this is the consensus among political parties \nto  move  the  country  toward  a  federal  state  based  on  a  new  constitution  drafted  by  the \nConstituent Assembly, the elections for which were held in April 2008 after two postponements. \n \n10. \nThe  Constituent  Assembly  elections  were  generally  peaceful  and  orderly,  with  a \nreasonably high voter turnout of 61%, reflecting the Nepali people\u2019s aspiration for lasting peace \nand  stability.  In  what  came  as  a  surprise  to  many,  CPN(M)  won  the  largest  number  of  seats \nunder both the first-past-the-post and the proportional representation electoral systems.9 In May \n2008,  the  Constituent  Assembly,  in  its  first  session,  formally  declared  Nepal  to  be  a  federal \ndemocratic  republic,  thus  ending  the  almost  two-and-half-century  reign  of  the  Shah  dynasty. \nThe  Constituent  Assembly  itself  is  more  inclusive  of  historically  marginalized  groups  than \nprevious legislatures,10 and this augurs well for the process of preparing the constitution. \n \nThese  have  been  significant  achievements  in  the  political  process  in  Nepal  in  the  past \n11. \ncouple  of  years,  but  much  more  still  remains  to  be  done.  Of  particular  importance  will  be  the \nprocess of restructuring the state with a federal structure of government. This process is fraught \nwith  challenges  but  is  the  single  political  measure  that  will  have  the  most  momentous \nimplications  for  how  development  space  is  structured  in  the  country  (see  Supplementary \nAppendix C on the issues related to federalism in Nepal).  \n \n12.  While all political parties have agreed on the transition toward a federal structure for the \ncountry, as reflected in the Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP), \nlittle  agreement  yet  exists  among  them  on  exactly  how  this  should  play  out,  and  the \ndisagreements are not always clearly articulated at this stage. While the Constituent Assembly \nhas yet to discuss this in earnest, there is a need to be mindful of local governance implications \nof the various ideas on federalism currently being aired (see Supplementary Appendix C). What \nis  not  contested  are  the  three  principles  under  the  LGCDP:  a  strengthened  national  and \ninstitutional  framework;  the  need  for  strong  local  bodies  capable  of  delivering  services  in  an \neffective and socially inclusive manner; and the need for empowered local communities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLocal Governance Context \n\n \n13. \nLocal governance was until 1990 always dominated by a focus more on administrative \nconsiderations than on political or economic autonomy, and very little political space was given \n                                                 \n8  Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction, cited in The Himalayan Times. 2008. Miseries continue to dog thousands of \n\nconflict-hit. 8 May (Kathmandu, page 1).  \n\n9  CPN(M) won 220 seats in total, followed by Nepal Congress with 110, Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-\nLeninist)  with  103,  Madhes  People\u2019s  Right  Forum  with  52,  and  other  smaller  parties  with  90.  The  remaining  26 \nseats for the 601-member Constituent Assembly were nominated by the interim Government in June 2008. \n\n10 The  Constituent  Assembly  Member  Electoral  Act  2007  allocated  special  seats  to  women  and  DAGs  as  follows: \nDalits  13%,  indigenous  groups  37.8%,  backward  regions  4%,  Madhesis  31.2%,  and  other  groups  30.2%.  Males \nand females equally shared each of these quotas.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nto  local  governments.  This  changed  with  the  constitution  of  1990,  and  since  then  (and \nparticularly  after  the  legal  framework  provided  by  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act  in  1999  and \nthe Interim Constitution of 2007 that provided priority to local self-governance and equity-based \nresource  allocation),  local  governance  reforms  have  been  debated  in  the  same  breath  as \noverarching, national political reforms. \n \n14. \nAt  the  moment,  the  administrative  divisions  in  place  for  the  past  4  decades  persist.  In \nthis set up, there are 75 districts (each comprising 9\u201317 ilakas\u2014or areas that cover clusters of \nvillages  and  municipalities\u2014and  varying  in  terms  of  geographical  characteristics  and,  more \nimportantly,  economic  endowment),11 3,915  village  development  committees  (each  with  nine \nwards that contain several settlements or communities),12 and 58 municipalities with anywhere \nfrom 9 to 35 wards. For law and order purposes, the country was divided into 14 zones, but this \ndemarcation  does  not  currently  hold  any  administrative  or  economic  significance. The  districts \nand  villages  are  coalesced  into  development  committees  that  have  parallel  development  and \nadministrative areas of focus. \n \nNepal  has  not  had  local  elections  since  2002,  which  means  that  there  are  no  local \n15. \nelected  representatives.  This  has  myriad  consequences,  the  most  significant  of  which  is  that \nlocal administrations run by bureaucrats deputed from the central government13 have very little \ndownward  accountability  even  though  they  are  supported  by  an  all-party  alliance  at  the  local \nlevel. This has hindered local stakeholder ownership of the development process. \n \n16. \nRecognizing  the  variance  in  socioeconomic  status  among  the  districts,  and  largely  to \nascertain the nature and extent of marginalization across them, the Government is conducting a \nDAG mapping exercise in 70 of the country\u2019s 75 districts, with surveys in the remaining five to \nbe  completed  in  the  near  future. 14  The  DAG  mapping  exercise  has  revealed  significant \ndepravation among districts.  \n \nA primary feature of the state of local governance in Nepal is that ordinary citizens, and \n17. \nin particular DAGs, have been unable to participate effectively in the local political economy and \nhave failed to hold local bodies15 accountable for their performance. This lack of accountability \nis at the core of the program that has been designed by the Government. \n \n\n3. \n\nLegal and Policy Environment for Decentralization and Local Governance \n\nThe legal and policy environment for decentralization and local governance in Nepal has \n\n \n18. \nundergone a substantial shift in the past 2 decades, as considered from these perspectives: \n \n\n                                                 \n11 The  Ministry  of  Local  Development  estimates  that  Kathmandu  District  alone  collects  40%  of  all  revenue  in  the \ncountry; Parsa District, which handles much of Nepal\u2019s overland imports from India, collects another 20%; and 64 \nof the 75 districts in the country together collect only 14%. The remaining nine districts collect the residual 26%. \n12 These  have  various  community-based  organizations  that  are  characterized  by  localized  membership,  small  size, \n\nand self-help orientation. They increasingly provide local services on contract with local governments.  \n\n13 This  includes  executive  officers  in  municipalities,  local  development  officers  in  district  development  committees, \n\nand secretaries in village development committees. \n\n14 Criteria  used  in  DAG  mapping  to  find  out  who  the  DAGs  are  and  how  they  are  disadvantaged  include  food \nsufficiency in the past 3 months, access to primary school and health posts, participation in planning and decision-\nmaking forums, and the prevalence of gender discrimination. DAG mapping is used by policy makers to determine \nthe extent of additional support needed to uplift the marginalized and vulnerable groups in a particular area. \n\n15 This document distinguishes between local governments and local bodies. As there are currently no local elected \nrepresentatives, the term \u201clocal bodies\u201d is used. The Local Self-Governance Act, 1999, uses the term \u201clocal bodies\u201d \nto refer to all village and district development committees and municipalities. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\nConstitutional. The Interim Constitution of 2007 specifies that decentralization is \nthe cornerstone of national development.16 It says that a conducive environment \nwill  be  created  to  promote  grassroots  participation.  The  fifth  amendment  to  this \nConstitution  allows  for  creating  interim  local  bodies  representing  all  political \nparties in the Constituent Assembly until local elections are held. \nLegal. The legal basis17 for the policy environment is contained in the (a) Local \nSelf-Governance Act, 1999,18 which, though rather dated, continues to serve as \nthe  fundamental  legal  basis  for  local  governance  and  the  primary  institutional \nfoundation for local bodies; (b) Local Bodies Financial Administration Regulations, \n2007,  which  are  designed  to  strengthen  the  financial  authority  of  local  bodies, \nimprove  transparency  through  the  provision  of  community  procurement  and \npublic  audit,  and  enhance  the  accountability  of  local  bodies;  (c)  Right  to \nInformation Act, 2007, which helps strengthen accountability and transparency in \ngovernment, including at the local level; and (d) Governance (Management and \nOperation)  Act,  2008, which  focuses  on  good governance  principles  and  norms \n(including fiscal discipline), aligns civic rights to good governance, delineates the \nfunctions  and  responsibilities  of  officials  at  different  levels  of  government,  and \nlegally  provides  for  transforming  the  role  of  government  administration  toward \nthat of a service provider. \nInstitutional.  The  Local  Bodies  Fiscal  Commission,  created  in  2002,  plays  a \ncentral institutional role with respect to intergovernmental fiscal transfers related \nto  local  bodies.  Other  relevant  institutions  include  the  National  Planning \nCommission, the Ministry of Finance, and local body associations. \nPlanning.  The  current  Three-Year  Interim  Plan  (TYIP)  (FY2008\u20132010)  lays \nemphasis  on  economic  backing  to  the  political  vision  of  devolved  local \ngovernance. The TYIP specifies decentralization as a main means of enhancing \ngood governance; details a process of administrative, political, social, economic, \nand  development  works;  and  presents  a  strategy  for  promoting  the  peoples\u2019 \nparticipation  and  empowerment.  The  2007  Concept  Paper  on  Self-Governance \nand Local Development from the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) effectively \ndefines the strategic direction for local governance in Nepal. \n\n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n \n1. \n\nIssues \n\nEngineering  a  New  Paradigm  of  Central\u2013Local  Relations. It is clear that the center \n19. \nwill  play  a  strong  policy  coordinating,  facilitating,  and  monitoring  role  on  most  matters  of \ngovernance.  This  requires  that  embedded  approaches  to  engaging  local  bodies  undergo  a \nsubstantive shift. This is what the federalism debate in Nepal now centers on. The Local Self-\nGovernance Act (LSGA) is still the basic legal provision for local governance, but this piece of \nlegislation, crafted almost a decade ago, does not reflect the political reality of 2008. \n\n                                                 \n16 It  sets  the  future  direction  for  the  social,  political,  and  economic transformation  of  Nepal  by  guaranteeing  social \njustice and affirmative action for women and DAGs. It proposes the future restructuring of the state to promote and \ninstitutionalize  an  inclusive,  democratic,  and  progressive  local  governance  system,  maximizing  people's \nparticipation  through  decentralization,  devolution  of  power,  and  the  equitable  distribution  of  resources  to  local \nbodies.  The  Interim  Constitution  provides  for  creating  such  interim  local  bodies  as  municipalities  and  village  and \ndistrict development committees as per political consensus.  \n\n17 Relevant here are the rather innovative aspects of social inclusion and gender equality that are now being included \n\nin various pieces of legislation, rules, and procedures, as well as in development programs. \n\n18 Supplementary Appendix B discusses this in detail. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nEnsuring  a  Peace  Dividend.  Providing  citizens,  and  particularly  DAGs,  with  a  peace \n20. \ndividend  and  earning  greater  trust  in  Government  is  currently  the  main  challenge.  This  is \nimportant to heal damaged social relations quickly and recoup the development momentum lost \nto  the  conflict  through  programs  of  reconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  reintegration,  as  well  as \nthe  effective  delivery  of  basic  services.  This  last  point  is  crucial,  for  it  goes  to  the  heart  of \ninteraction  between  government  and  citizens.  The  current  state  of  public  service  delivery  is \nconsidered  weak,  with  the  possible  exception  of  some  aspects  of  delivery  of  health  and \neducation  services  following  sectoral  devolution.19 Unless  such  service  delivery  is  improved, \ngovernment\u2013citizen interactions will continue to be weak, and efforts to gain greater public trust \nin government will not yield a peace dividend. \n\n21. \nImproving  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Transfers  and  Funds  Flow.  To  make  local \ninvestments  more  responsive  to  community  needs,  the  Government  will  increase  the \ndiscretionary block grant that is currently transferred to local bodies. The defining feature of this \nexpanded  block  grant  (EBG)  is  that  its  actual  allocation  is  never  an  entitlement  but  subject  to \ncompliance  with  specified  minimum  eligibility  conditions  and  further  set  in  accordance  with  an \nannual  performance  assessment\u2014a  minimum  conditions  and  performance  measures  (MCPM) \nsystem.20 The  actual  size  of  the  EBG  is  thus  adapted  to  proven  institutional  capacity  in  key \nfunctional  areas,  mainly  relating  to  public  financial  management,  and  so  provides  fiscal \nincentives  for  compliance  with  the  existing  legal  and  regulatory  framework  that  guides  the \noperations of local bodies. This makes the EBG and the MCPM system the first systematic and \nnationwide approach to promoting good governance and needs-based local service delivery.21 A \nsecond  salient  feature  of  the  EBG  is  that  its  basic  allocation  is  based  on  a  clear,  transparent, \nand  poverty-focused  formula.  This  positively  distinguishes  the  EBG  from  the  vast  majority  of \nconditional grants  that  flow  to  the  districts,  which  are  not  formula  based  and  thus  are  open  to \nunwarranted discretion in their allocation.  \n\n22. \nInstituting a Workable Local Government Service. What passes for local government \nservice  at  the  moment  is  still  controlled  by  the  center  through  resource  flow  and  human \nresource management. Given that, a particular issue that the Government will need to consider \nurgently is how to institute a local government service such that local bodies will not have to rely \nexcessively on the center for human resource systems. Despite the fact that representatives of \npolitical  parties,  in  conjunction  with  officers  deputed  from  the  center  to  local  bodies,  manage \nlocal body operations, putting in place a workable local government service is critical. \n\n23. \nProviding Services Effectively and Inclusively. One of the root causes of the conflict \nin  Nepal  was  the  glaring  failure  of  the  public  sector  to  provide  services,  especially  local  ones, \neffectively  and  inclusively.  The  recent  inability  of  the  Government  to  provide  textbooks  to \nstudents is one glaring example of this failure. Across the board, DAGs, and women in particular, \nhave been marginalized regarding access to services as their right, and this has fed wariness \ntoward government.22 \n\n                                                 \n19 An assessment done by ADB has found that in several districts local school management committees have been \nsomewhat  successful  in  getting  better  services  from  schools  (the  assessment  work  was  done  under  ADB.  2006. \nTechnical  Assistance  to  Nepal  for  Preparing  the  Governance  Reforms  and  Decentralization  Cluster  Program  I. \nManila  (TA  4834-NEP,  approved  31  August)).  For further  analysis  of  service  delivery  issues,  see  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n\n20 Details on the MCPM system and the EBG are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n21 Component  2  of  the  LGCDP  is  a  nationwide  roll  out  of  the  MCPM  pilot,  which  has  been  successfully  tried  in  25 \n\ndistricts since FY2005. The Government decided to introduce the system for all local bodies. \n\n22 Service delivery experiences across such sectors as water supply and sanitation, education, health, urban service \ndelivery,  etc.,  generally  reveal  that  the  Government  has  not  managed  to  keep  pace  with  public  demand  for \nservices.  This  service  delivery  deficit  is  particularly  severe  with  respect  to  DAGs,  who,  because  of  caste \ndiscrimination and social exclusion, cannot access basic services even when generally available. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\nHolding  Local  Bodies  Accountable  to  Communities.  This  issue  has  to  do  with \n\n24. \nstrengthening demand for good local governance and has several facets: \n\n(i) \n\nWith no elected local representatives, civil servants deputed from the center run \nlocal administrations, so local bodies exhibit very little downward accountability to \ncitizens.  An  all-party  mechanism  exists  at  every  level  to  help  the  bureaucracy \nfunction, but this cannot substitute for direct accountability to citizens. \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii)  While the all-party mechanism is expected to give guidance on local governance \nmatters until local elections take place, there are vestiges of political meddling in \nlocal service delivery. This has not diminished, even with the far-reaching political \nchanges in the country.  \nSome  communities  have  historically  not  been  able  to  participate  in  the  public \naccountability  process.  Making  local  bodies  more  sensitive  to  the  needs  and \nvoices  of  children,  women,  and  DAGs  is  very  challenging.  The  country  has  a \nhighly stratified society in which women and the underprivileged exert  very little \npower and find it difficult to articulate their needs. \nChallenges remain as to how to adapt social mobilization activities in a manner \nthat  allows  broad-based  and  targeted  community  interaction  with  local  bodies \nand promotes downward accountability.  \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\nOpportunities \n\n2. \n \n25. \nThere  are  several  opportunities  to  bring  about  substantial  and  far-reaching  reforms  at \nthe moment, made more accessible to policy makers by the movement toward federalism. They \ninclude the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCommitment  of  major  political  parties.  Everyone  strongly  realizes  the \nunderlying cause of the conflict was the marginalization of vast segments of the \npopulation.  Recent  years  have  seen  a  commitment  on  the  part  of  all  political \nparties to pay more attention to this. The political realignment evident in Nepal in \nrecent years has contributed to this opportunity. The major political parties have \nexpressed  active  commitment  to  state  restructuring  to  ensure  a  decentralized, \naccountable,  people-oriented,  and  democratic  self-governance  system,  as  well \nas to address the needs of DAGs and remote regions and communities. \nNew  realignment  of  the  state.  Realignment  following  the  abolition  of  the \nmonarchy and the move toward a federal state better reflect the aspirations of all. \nThe formation of local peace committees in 32 districts so far, with their provision \nof an all-party mechanism and the representation of women and DAGs, provides \nsignificant opportunities to improve linkages with the local administration to help \narbitrate  in  conflicts  that  impede  development  efforts.  The  state  realignment  is \nalso  evidenced  in,  for  example,  the  second  amendment  in  2007  to  the  Civil \nService  Act,  1992,  which  reserves  45%  of  positions  for  women  and  excluded \ngroups,  and  a  declaration  by  the  Interim  Parliament  for  33%  representation  for \nwomen in all state institutions. \nCommitment  to  increased  fiscal  transfers  to  local  bodies.  The Government \nis  committed  to  increasing  fiscal  transfers  to  local  bodies.  In  2006,  it  increased \nthe size of village development committee (VDC) block grants from NRs500,000 \nto  NRs1  million  (in  September  2008,  this  was  doubled  to  NRs2  million). \nIncreased fiscal transfers from the center provide opportunities to strengthen and \nimprove  the  quality  of  local  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  and  to  empower \nthe  community.  Similarly,  the  Government  is  moving  ahead  to  consider  the \nperformance-based  allocation  of  resources  to  district  development  committees \n(DDCs) and other local bodies as a basic measure to improve good governance. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nlocal  governance.  Demand  for  good \nIncreased  demand  for  stronger \ngovernance in Nepal has now been fuelled by an active media and civil society. \nThere  is  increasing  acceptance  of  such  tools  as  citizens\u2019  charters,  codes  of \nconduct,  social  audits,  citizen  report  cards,  sunshine  provisions,  etc.,  and  this \nhas helped fuel demand for stronger local governance.23This provides substantial \nopportunities  to  strengthen  transparent  and  accountable  local  governance. 24 \nPublic  demand  has  been  evident  in  calls  to  redefine  the  relationship  between \nlocal  administrations  and  local  communities  and  to  promote  more  constructive \ninteraction between them. \nHarmonized  approach  of  development  partners. Development partners have \ncome together substantively to work with the Government and support reforms in \nlocal governance and community development. This is evident in the manner in \nwhich  they  have  expressed  their  joint  support  to  the  LGCDP.  This  provides  an \nopportunity to pool resources and learn directly from different experiences. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \n3. \n \n26. \nPicking  up  from  the  policy  environment  for  decentralization  and  local  governance,  the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term vision on local governance and decentralization is to have local bodies \nrestructured  according  to  the  concepts  of  inclusion,  democracy,  and  a  federal  governmental \nsystem  capable  of  effectively  delivering  services.  This  means  a  focus  on  two  specific  things: \nlocal governance and service delivery. In the TYIP, the Government specifies two objectives to \nattain  its  vision:  (i)  promoting  good  local  governance  by  clearly  delineating  the  rights  and \nresponsibilities  of  the  central  Government  and  local  bodies,  and  (ii)  enhancing  local  body \neffectiveness by developing a participatory planning system based on peoples\u2019 aspirations and \nlocal demand through inclusion and mainstreaming gender. \n \n27. \n\nThe Government\u2019s strategy to meet these objectives is to do the following:  \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nRestructure  local  bodies  on  the  basis  of  geography,  population,  resources  and \nmeans, and service delivery.  \nLimit the functions of the central Government to policy formulation, setting norms \nand quality standards, human resource development, etc., and devolve the rest \nto local bodies. \nImplement the Local (Government) Service Act to ensure that local civil service is \nstrengthened. \nDirectly  transfer  funds  to  local  bodies  through  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  district \ndevelopment funds, municipality funds, and, through DDCs, to VDCs. \nFormulate and implement human resource development plans in areas related to \nlocal governance. \nEncourage the mobilization and sharing of revenues between local bodies. \nPut in place a \u201cone window\u201d system so that local bodies can hold to account all \ndevelopment  partners,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  others  that \nprovide funding. \n\n(viii)  Encourage a rights-based approach to formulating and implementing local plans \n\nand programs. \n                                                 \n23 MLD reports that the results of some of its surveys show substantial utility in applying these tools more extensively. \nThe experiences of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in the field in Nepal show that public \nand  social  auditing  gives  voice  to  DAGs  and  helps  improve  operational  transparency  and  accountability.  Its \nexperiences show that such tools have been useful in empowering DAGs and improving downward accountability. \n(CIDA\u2019s notes on lessons learned from its field operations are available from the Mission.) \n\n24 There  is  a  clear  distinction  between  strengthening  local  governance  and  a  generic  focus  on  decentralization \nreforms. The former is much more encompassing and brings to the fore the relationship of local governments with \nthe communities they serve. Decentralization reforms are not as extensive. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n28. \nThe TYIP focuses on the Government\u2019s strategy with respect to good local governance. \nThis  centers  on  promoting  access  to  economic  and  social  service  delivery  through  public \nparticipation,  transparency,  accountability,  and  the  creation  of  a  corruption-free  environment. \nOne particular strategy that the Government wishes to pursue in this respect is to reiterate the \nfundamental  rights  of  the  client  to  receive  effective  and  quality  service  by  making  service \ndelivery that is provided by all government agencies inclusive. Another is to encourage a greater \nrole for NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) in social mobilization. \n \n29. \nrests on the following: \n\nThe  Government  strategy  with  respect  to  service  delivery  as  part  of  good  governance \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nMinimize  corruption  by  strengthening  institutions  such  as  the  National  Vigilance \nCenter and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. \nTransfer local services to local bodies. \nContinue  to  emphasize  citizens\u2019  charters  and  public  hearings  and  give  civil \nsociety  a  greater  monitoring  role  largely  through  a  more  comprehensive  social \nmobilization policy. \nDisseminate  information  more  effectively  by,  for  example,  computerizing  all \ninformation  in  public  agencies  involved  in  service  delivery  and  enhanced \ncommunication among service providers. \nMake available to the public all information on services delivered by the state. \nGive  greater  authority  to  institutions  that  deliver  services  and  equip  them \nadequately. \nPlace greater emphasis on consumer rights. \n\n \n30. \nAll of this is contained in the LGCDP, which the Government has developed, owns, and \nis  fully  committed  to.  The  LGCDP  seeks  to  meet  the  TYIP  goals  of  socially  inclusive  and \ngender-responsive  service  delivery;  provide  a  peace  dividend;  empower  communities, \nparticularly  DAGs,  to  reassert  their  rights;  and  harmonize  the  support  and  programs  of \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n\n4. \n\nADB Strategy, Operations, and Lessons \n\n \n31. \nStrategy.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP) \n(2005\u20132009)25 for  Nepal  is  premised  on  the  assumption  that  the  development  process  in  the \ncountry  needs  to  be  more  broad-based  and  inclusive.  In  this  regard,  the  overarching  goal  of \npoverty reduction is tied to the intermediate goal of inclusive development. One of the primary \nstrategies  of  ADB  in  helping  Nepal  develop  is  the  focus  on  improved  governance,  which  has \nsignificant  implications  for  the  delivery  of  economic  and  social  services.  As  a  result,  the  CSP \nhighlights that all sector operations should include measures aimed at improving governance. In \nparticular, the CSP asserts that key priorities in governance include promoting decentralization \nand  greater  transparency  and  accountability  in  public  service  delivery,  as  well  as  building \ncapacity. ADB\u2019s latest country operations business plan for Nepal26 confirms this focus. \n \n32. \nAn  inclusive  development  process  contributes  to  social  and  economic  progress  and \npolitical stability, and mainstreaming inclusion and emphasizing transparency and accountability \nare key components of development. ADB\u2019s strategy of focusing on good governance is central \nto ensuring an inclusive development process. In  this regard, ADB\u2019s operations in Nepal have \nplaced emphasis on the following: (i) encouraging public policies that facilitate the participation \nof  women  and  DAGs  in  the  development  process  and  government;  (ii)  providing  targeted \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2004.

ADB  operations  in  Nepal  have  covered  the  gamut  of  sectors,  including \nagriculture  and  rural  development,  education,  energy,  transport  and  communications,  water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  urban  development,  finance,  and  governance.  With  respect  to \ngovernance, the focus has been on civil service reforms, anticorruption, governance reforms for \nbetter  service  delivery,  institutional  capacity  building,  and  decentralized  governance.  Relevant \ncrosscutting  themes  include  gender  and  social  inclusion,  particularly  empowering  women  and \nmainstreaming gender considerations in ADB operations. \n \n34. \nAs  in  other  countries,  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  Nepal  recognize  the  criticality  of  (i)  a  long-\nterm commitment to capacity development, (ii) encouraging good governance practices, and (iii) \nan  appropriate  policy  and  institutional  environment.  ADB  has  continually  sought  to  emphasize \nownership and commitment to reforms by political leaders, the Government, and civil society as \nthe basis of development effectiveness. \n \n35. \nLessons.  Lessons  drawn  from  the  operations of  ADB  and  other  development  partners \nguide  the  formulation  of  the  GSP  Cluster.  Some  relevant  lessons  are  that  (i)  clear  targeting \ncriteria for DAGs should be transparent and specified upfront; (ii) the qualitative participation of \nwomen  and  other  DAGs  in  governance  is  still  a  challenge;  (iii)  a  project-oriented  and  ad  hoc \napproach  to  local  development  is  not  likely  to  be  very  effective  in  attaining  development \noutcomes; and (iv) the approval of rules and regulations should be expedited, as their absence \ncompromises effective service delivery. \n\n36. \nADB\u2019s rather substantial familiarity with the country\u2019s governance challenges resulted in \nassistance  with  the  Governance  Reform  Program.27 It  showed  that  (i)  a  support  program  on \ngovernance  should  not  be  very  broad  but  should  at  the  same  time  provide  for  flexibility  in \nprogram  design  and  implementation  arrangements;  (ii)  a  long-term  commitment  to  reforms  is \nimportant;  and  (iii)  in  a  conflict  situation  as  existed  in  Nepal,  continuous  engagement  with \nstakeholders  at  all  levels  is  the  only  way  to  ensure  the  attainment  of  program  outcomes. \nFollowing the closure of the Governance Reform Program, the Government requested targeted \nand  focused  support  for  improving  local  service  delivery  during  the  political  transition  and  for \ngovernance reforms at  the center following the completion of state restructuring. The program \ncluster approach in the GSP is ADB's response to the Government\u2019s request. \n\n37. \n\nLessons learned from relevant technical assistance28 include the following: \n(i) \n\nEven  small  investments  can  make  a  big  difference  locally,  particularly  as  they \nrelate to development efforts by women\u2019s groups.  \nConsensus-based development effort is not only necessary but very possible at \nthe local level. \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n27 ADB.  2001.

While  development  partners  have  always  been  active  in  Nepal  in  the  areas  of  good \ngovernance, local development, and decentralization (see Appendix 3), what has been absent is \na coherent approach to aligning their support into a program that is truly national in scope and \ncharacter. The LGCDP, designed by the Government with the support of development partners, \nfills that void. Key areas of support in local governance include (i) local development, including \nsupport  to  communities  and  CBOs;  (ii)  decentralized  governance  advisory  support;  (iii)  social \ninclusion for DAGs; (iv) decentralized financing; and (v) participatory local planning processes.  \n\n40. \nCoordination  among  development  partners  for  actions  in  these  areas  is  done  through \nseveral local consultative group committees, including those on governance. ADB is an active \nmember  of  these  committees.  Cooperation  among  development  partners  is  evident  in  their \ndecision to (i) be involved in the conceptualization and development of the LGCDP, (ii) do joint \nassessments, and (iii) pool resources to fund the resulting reforms. \n\nRationale \n\n6. \n \n41. \nRationale  for  the  GSP  and  Program  Cluster  Approach.  The  rationale  for  the  GSP \ncenters  on  the  need  to  support  reforms  in  local  governance  and  community  development  in \nNepal  at  a  critical  juncture  in  its  history.  In  seeking  to  provide  this  support,  ADB  is  keen  to \nemploy  a  program  cluster  approach  with  the  hope  that,  in  the  medium  term,  the  Government \nand  its  development  partners  will  be  able  to  employ  a  program-based  approach  to  reforms  in \nline with the coordinated support for a Government-owned program. The rationale for a program \ncluster approach is based on the fundamental premise that only a holistic and long-term, vision-\noriented program of support will enable the Government to plan reforms better (see Appendix 6). \nThis is especially so at a time of significant and fundamental political changes in the country that \nhave  deep  implications  for  local  governance.  A  program  cluster  approach  will  enable  the \nGovernment to take a sustained approach to reforms. \n \n42. \nRationale  for  Subprogram  I.  While  the  rationale  for  the  program  cluster  approach  is \nrelated to the manner in which support is to be provided to Government, the underlying rationale \nfor the GSP, whose subprogram I supports the outcomes of the national program, is premised \non a number of considerations: \n\n(i) \n\nPoverty  reduction  is  at  the  core  of  development  action  in  Nepal,  and  one  of  its \nkey  elements  is  the  effective  delivery  of  basic  public  goods  and  services,  with \nparticular attention to supporting communities in remote and marginalized areas. \n\n                                                 \n29 For example, Operations Evaluation Department. 2007. Summary of Lessons from Evaluations of ADB Programs \n\nin Support of Public Sector Reform. Manila: ADB.  \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nIn  the  post-conflict  environment  that  exists  in  Nepal,  the  need  to  ensure  a \ntangible peace dividend and a framework for recovery is a major justification for \nthe  GSP.  This  particular  recovery  effort  is  premised  on  the  broad  political \nconsensus on federalism.  \nThe current system of rather ad hoc distribution of grants to local bodies needs \nimprovement.  The  LGCDP  will  replace  it  with  criteria-based  grants,  and  top-up \ngrants will be provided for the equitable distribution of resources to local bodies \nas part of the peace dividend. \nThe  Government  has  stated  its  dissatisfaction  with  project-oriented  support \nmodalities toward reform, and the LGCDP provides the right opportunity to work \nin a more holistic manner. The LGCDP is also well balanced in terms of its focus \non demand for and supply of good local governance. \nThere  is  a  need  to  mobilize  DAGs  and  empower  communities  to  make  optimal \nuse  of  the  development  space  created  by  recent  political  changes.  Widespread \nbuy-in from development partners enables a joint approach to reforms. \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n \n43. \nADB  support  for  the  Government\u2019s  reform  of  local  governance  and  community \ndevelopment  is  premised  on  the  country\u2019s  movement  toward  federalism,  which  creates \nsignificant  need  for  the  right  structures  and  mechanisms  both  centrally  and  locally  to  make \nfederalism work. This requires a medium-term plan of support to the Government. The proposed \nGSP cluster addresses this need. \n \nThe  overriding  goal  of  the  GSP  is  social  and  economic  transformation  to  build  a  new \n44. \nNepal through (i) a capable and accountable government at all levels that provides effective and \ninclusive  services,  and  (ii)  empowered  communities  that  engage  actively  with  government  to \nhold it accountable. The main outcomes include (i) a better local operating environment, (ii) fully \nfunctional local governments that are capable and accountable, (iii) stronger CBOs and DAGs, \n(iv)  inclusive  and  participatory  service  delivery  systems,  (v)  supportive  central  agencies  and \nprocesses, and (vi) a strong national system and Government leadership. \n \nTo attain the goal and outcomes detailed above, the GSP takes a phased approach to \n45. \nsupporting  the  Government.  As  such,  it  consists  of  two  subprograms  (see  Appendix  6). 30 \nSubprogram I (SP1) (2008\u20132012) will emphasize community mobilization and strengthening to \nhold  local  bodies  accountable,  strengthen  their  capability  to  provide  effective  and  inclusive \nservices,  and  institute  relevant  central  protocols  and  systems  to  support  the  local  governance \nreform  agenda.  Subprogram  II  (SP2)  (2012\u20132015)  will  concentrate  on  the  reengineering  of \nbusiness processes needed at the center to support a federal government structure, putting in \nplace the legal framework for proper local governance, strengthening the fiscal transfer process \nand system, and then strengthening community organizations and local bodies. \n \n46. \nThe  Government,  for  its  part,  has  prepared  the  LGCDP,  which  SP1  mirrors.  The \nGovernment  has  sought  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners,  and  SP1  will \ndirectly support the LGCDP. In that regard, the term \u201cprogram\u201d in this document should be taken \nto mean both the GSP SP1 and the LGCDP, unless otherwise indicated.  \n \n\n                                                 \n30 Total support to the Government for these two subprograms is $156.3 million ($106.3 million for subprogram 1 and, \n\ntentatively, $50 million for subprogram 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nImpact  \n\nthrough  socially \n\ninclusive,  gender-responsive,  strong,  and  accountable \n\nThe overall impact of the proposed SP1 is to contribute, through the LGCDP, to poverty \n47. \nreduction \nlocal \ngovernance  and  participatory,  community-led  development,  which  will  ensure  the  increased \ninvolvement of women and DAGs (including Dalits, Madhesis, Adibasis, and Janajatis) in local \ngovernance processes and outcomes. The program is in keeping with the Government\u2019s stated \noutcomes with respect to these areas in the TYIP. \n \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nOutcomes \n\n48. \nThe  policy  framework  and  actions  of  SP1  draw  entirely  from  the  LGCDP.  They  are \nbased  on  the  premise  that,  by  early-  to  mid-2009,  multiple  donors  will  have  committed  funds \nthrough  a  joint  financing  arrangement  to  support  the  LGCDP.  These  funds  will  be  released  in \naccordance  with  the  annual  implementation  plans  of  the  LGCDP,  subject  to  having  reached \ncertain performance indicators under the plan of the previous year. The policy conditions for the \nfirst tranche are steps that are required to finalize the details of the LGCDP. There is consensus \namong  development  partners  in  Nepal  that  the  framework  and  actions  need  to  be  strongly \nsupported if the Government is to attain its vision for reform. \n \n \n \n49. \nThe  outcomes  as  detailed  in  the  LGCDP  are  (i)  citizens  and  communities  empowered \nand actively engaged with local bodies and holding them accountable; (ii) the improved capacity \nof local bodies to manage resources and deliver basic services inclusively and equitably; and (iii) \nstrengthened  policy  and  national  institutional  frameworks,  including  legal  frameworks,  for \ndecentralization, devolution, and community development.31 \n \n \n \nSP1  of  the GSP  will  support  achieving  the  goals  of  the  LGCDP.32 A  programmatic  and \n50. \nlogical  link  exists  among  the  three  outcomes  listed  above  and  to  the  specifications  of  the \ncomponents  and  outputs  of  the  LGCDP. 33  First,  on  the  side  of  demand  for  good  local \ngovernance, citizens and communities will be encouraged to speak up more than they currently \ndo  and  to  engage  actively  in  local  body  resource  allocation  and  decision  making.  Second,  on \nthe supply side, the focus will be on improving the capacity of local bodies to manage resources \nand  deliver  basic  services  inclusively  and  equitably.  Finally,  to  provide  the  needed  macro  and \npolicy  support,  the  national  institutional  framework  for  decentralization,  devolution,  and \ncommunity development will be strengthened.34 \n\nProgram Components and Outputs  \n\n2. \n\nComponent  1:  Citizens  and  Communities  Actively  Engaged  with \nLocal Bodies and Hold Them Accountable \n\na. \n\n \n\n51. \nThis  component  aims  to  promote  the  capacity  of  communities,  especially  the  more \ndisadvantaged  groups  and  those  in  more  remote  rural  areas  and  urban  pockets,  to  articulate \n                                                 \n31 The development policy letter and policy matrix of SP1 are in Appendix 5. \n32 The outputs and performance targets of the program are in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. All \n\nthe descriptions and specifications of the program are from the approved document on the LGCDP. \n\n33 See Supplementary Appendix A for a discussion of the program logic and results chain. \n34 There will also be a strong focus on institutional mechanisms for downward accountability; as there are no elected \nlocal  representatives  yet,  alternative  institutional  mechanisms  for  downward  accountability  are  needed.  Activities \nwill aim to ensure the capacity of communities to hold decision makers accountable and act on their development \npriorities. Basic tools (e.g., public hearings, public and social audits, etc.) will be used for this purpose. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\ntheir needs and priorities and make their claims on local bodies\u2014i.e., to promote more effective \ndemand  and  voice.  Activities  under  this  component  are  explicitly  intended  to  ensure  that \ncommunities are able to access these resources and use them in ways that are consistent with \nlocal needs and priorities. Social mobilization activities will empower communities and CBOs to \nengage  in  the  local,  bottom-up  planning  process,  as  provided  for  in  the  LSGA,  to  ensure  that \nthey access the public resources and services that they require on a priority basis.35 \n\ni. \n\nOutput  1.1:  Empowered  Communities  and  CBOs \nParticipate in Local Governance Processes \n\nthat \n\n \n52. \nTo help achieve this output, the program will focus on social mobilization in communities \naimed  at  encouraging  communities  and  CBOs  to  (i)  interact  with  local  bodies,  including  in  the \nplanning and budgeting process; (ii) have a voice in the process by which decisions are made \nabout plan implementation; and (iii) gain oversight of local body activities. Social mobilizers and \nmobilizing  agencies36 will  help  communities  and  CBOs  to  engage  with  their  local  bodies  and \nestablish linkages with other service-providing local agencies.37 \n\nii. \n\nOutput 1.2: More Capable Communities, Including DAGs, that \nAssert Their Rights and Hold Local Bodies Accountable \n\n \nThis output will ensure that the general public becomes more aware of local governance \n53. \nissues and processes. Communities will be provided with meaningful opportunities to hold their \nlocal bodies accountable for their performance in effectively and efficiently meeting local needs \nand priorities. This will be done through (i) information, education, and communication activities; \n(ii)  strengthened  mechanisms  for  local  and  community  advocacy  and  monitoring;  and  (iii) \ncapacity-building support to citizens\u2019 institutions that are led by DAGs so that they can promote \ninteraction with local bodies. \n \nIt is recognized that it will be necessary to go simultaneously into social mobilization and \n54. \ncore information, education, and communication activities to foster more meaningful interaction \nbetween citizens and civil society, on the one hand, and local bodies on the other. Through a \nLocal  Governance  and  Accountability  Facility  (LGAF),38 local  bodies  will  be  able  to  build  on \nmonitoring results to finance a range of more innovative activities. \n\nb. \n\nComponent  2:  Better  Management  of  Resources  and  Delivery  of \nServices Inclusively and Equitably by Capable Local Bodies \n\n \n55. \nComponent  2  recognizes  that  making  the  demand  side  of  local  governance  more \neffective through component 1 is needed, but that little will be achieved unless the supply side is \nalso strengthened to effectively meet the increased demands of citizens. Local bodies need to \nbuild their capacity to respond effectively to expressed priorities and needs. To ensure that this \nhappens, component 2 will focus on three outputs. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n35 See Appendix 7 for a detailed discussion of the role of social mobilization in program implementation.  \n36 Where  needed,  and  staying  within  the  resource  envelope,  gender  focal  points  will  be  established  locally  to  work \n\nwith the social mobilizers. \n\n37 Support will be provided to facilitate community-to-community linkages, and exposure trips for selected groups to, \n\nfor example, district headquarters or even regional training centers will be programmed. \n\n38 The  LGAF,  to  be  provided  as  part  of  development  partner  support  to  the  national  program,  is  a  mechanism  by \nwhich  Government  will  enable  independent  monitoring  of  functions  of  the  local  bodies  to  ensure  that  they  are \ncarried out accountably and in the manner specified in the national program. This will make it possible for citizens \n(particularly DAGs) to hold to account service providers. The Facility\u2019s scope of work will be limited to independent \nmonitoring functions, and will not constitute a parallel financing mechanism in the Program. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ni. \n\nOutput  2.1:  Access  to  Greater  Fiscal  Resources  for  Local \nBodies in Equitable and Appropriate Ways \n\n \n56. \nThere are two primary methods by which this output will be attained: (i) increased block \ngrant transfers to local bodies and, on a more selective basis, (ii) improvements in local bodies\u2019 \nown-source revenue collection. The former will act as a fiscal incentive for citizens to participate \nin local governance because more resources will be at stake. Application of the MCPM39 linked \nto development grants will promote better performance in core areas such as planning, financial \nmanagement, good governance, and transparency.40 \n \n\nii. \n\nOutput  2.2:  Appropriate  Measures  to  Build  Capacity  in  All \nLevels of the Local Body Service Delivery System \n\n57.  While access to more fiscal resources will undoubtedly strengthen the capacity of local \nbodies to respond to priorities and needs, developing systemic and human capacities will also \nbe  required.  This  will  be  done  in  a  variety  of  ways  and  will  allow  for  the  inclusion  of  capacity \nbuilding for implementation and production functions:41 \n\na supply-driven component wherein all local bodies are provided with training in \nbasic  areas  of  management  and  user-friendly  manuals  in  general  systems  and \nprocedures designed to help them manage better; \na  demand-driven  component  through  which  local  bodies  formulate  their  own \ncapacity-development  plans  and  finance  their  implementation  out  of  annual \ncapacity-development grants; and \na  DDC-led  system  of  support,  regular  backstopping,  and  mentoring  for  VDCs, \nlinkages  among \nwhich  will  enable \ndevelopment  grants, \nincentives  (rewards  and  sanctions,  assessment \nsystems),  and  their  ability  to  address  the  identified  functional  gaps  and \nweaknesses in an equitable manner.  \n\nlocal  bodies \n\nto  establish \n\nimportant \n\nthe \n\niii. \n\nOutput  2.3:  Fine-tuned  Local  Body  Service  Delivery \nMechanisms and Processes \n\n \nTo make existing service delivery processes more effective, the program will experiment \n58. \nwith new ways of doing things in four specific areas, with a view to having these pilots scaled up \nlater. They include the following: \n\nPiloting  updates  on  procedures  on  public  expenditure  management  and \npublic  finance  management.  This  will  be  expanded  to  include  monitoring, \nevaluation,  and  reporting  systems  by  local  bodies,  with  provisions  made  to \nincorporate gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) indicators. It will include \npiloting  alternative  ways  for  VDCs  to  access  technical  support  to  implement \ninvestment  subprojects,  including  conducting  necessary  assessments  regarding \nrelevant safeguards that may be triggered as a result of investment decisions. \nTesting safety nets and social assistance programs. Piloting will take place of \nthe  administration  of  safety  net  and  social  assistance  programs  by  VDCs  to \nprovide the poorest people and communities with opportunities to build up assets. \nThe  type  of  social  assistance  programs  to  be  piloted  will  be  cash-transfer \nsystems, both targeted and not and conditional and not.42 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n39 See Appendix 4 for a discussion of the MCPM system. \n40 Efforts will also be made to ensure that gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) issues are incorporated in the \n\ncriteria for MCPM grants to local bodies, and that MCPM indicators better reflect GESI considerations. \n41 Many of these functions will be fulfilled by agencies (e.g., user groups, CBOs, and private contractors). \n42 Safety net programs will address the immediate needs of DAGs as prioritized by themselves.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nPiloting innovative uses of conditional sector grants. These will be piloted for \neducation,  health,  and  agriculture  in  a  limited  number  of  DDCs.  Sector-\nconditional grants will be made to DDCs, which will then undertake joint planning \nand  budgeting  exercises  with  the  relevant  district  sector  offices.  The  grants  will \nnot  be  limited  to  capital  expenditures  but  will  also  be  used  for  financing \noperational  development  expenditures  (e.g.,  travel  allowances,  equipment,  etc.) \non the basis of Government budget norms. \nTesting  DDC  local  coordination  functions.  While  mandated  by  LSGA,  DDC \ncoordination  across  the  country  displays  considerable  variation  in  effectiveness \nand  quality.  The  LGCDP  will  therefore  pilot  innovative  mechanisms  by  which \nDDCs can fulfill their coordination functions (e.g., involving NGOs and the private \nsector  in  service  delivery).  This  will  include  establishing  forums  for  coordination \nand sharing experiences. \n\nc. \n\nComponent  3:  Strengthened  Policy  and  National \nFramework for Devolution and Local Self-Governance \n\nInstitutional \n\n59.  While  components  1  and  2  of  the  program  will  jointly  make  a  significant  contribution \ntoward better public services locally and ultimately poverty reduction, actions taken in regard to \npolicy and national institutions will further enhance program impact. This is needed because of \nuncertainty about the form and nature of the forthcoming national framework for federalism and \ncenter\u2013local  relationships.  In  this  vacuum,  central  agencies such  as  MLD  will  continue  to  play \ncritical roles in local development issues. Two particular outputs are targeted here. \n\ni. \n\nOutput 3.1: Policy Framework for Decentralization to Promote \na More Enabling Environment for Effective, Transparent, and \nAccountable Local Governance \n\nProgram-specific activities to help yield this output include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nReview decentralization and sector devolution policy in close liaison with the \nState Restructuring Commission to be formed by the Constituent Assembly. \nEstablish  a  broad  decentralization  approach  that  will  contribute  to  a  more \nholistic and program-based approach to local governance. \nPrepare  a  more  effective  policy  environment  for  the  demand  side  of  local \ngovernance,  including  conducting  a  thorough  review  of  the  constraints  to \ncommunity engagement with local bodies. \nPrepare improved staffing policies for local bodies.43 \nPrepare a national capacity-development strategy for local bodies.44 \nSupport  evidence-based  policymaking  by  conducting  outcome  and  impact \nstudies of local governance and community development initiatives. \n\nii. \n\nOutput  3.2:  Strong  Central  Government  and  National \nNongovernment Institutions that Provide Appropriate Support \nto Local Bodies \n\nThe LGCDP will strengthen the capacity of central institutions by \n\n                                                 \n43 The  LGCDP  seeks  to  create  a  more  stable  and  effective  staffing  system  for  local  bodies,  which  has  added \nimportance  with the ongoing absence of elected bodies. Close linkages will be maintained  with other agencies in \nthe process, such as the involvement of the Ministry of General Administration, and articulation with other ongoing \nreform processes, such as the commitment for 33% representation for women at all levels of administration. \n\n44 This  will  take  into  account  the  MCPM  system,  the  need  to  avoid  any  monopoly  over  the  provision  of  training \n\nservices, and the role of various local body associations, such as the Municipality Association of Nepal. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n60. \n\n \n61. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nproviding  support  to  the  Local  Bodies  Fiscal  Commission,  particularly  in \nelaborating  and  fine-tuning  the  grant-allocation  formula  and  expenditure  and \nrevenue  assignment  and  revenue  mobilization  activities,  and  by  reviewing  and \npiloting PFM procedures, including accounting systems; \nproviding  support  to  the  Ministry  of  Peace  and  Reconstruction  and  local  peace \ncommittees (LPCs) in their work supporting local development;45 \nproviding  support  to  local  body  associations  to  enhance  their  role  in  key  policy \ndiscussions with the Government in terms of advocacy for local bodies, including \nissues related to fiscal transfers and capacity building; \nsupporting the implementation of the National Capacity Development Strategy for \nlocal bodies through training institutions, regional workshops and training events, \nprivate consultants, and development partners;46 \ndesigning  and  implementing  the  local  body  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation  (M&E)  system  in  MLD,  particularly  on  improving  the  system  of  both \nfinancial and physical reporting; \nstrengthening  GESI  in  MLD  such  that  it  can  mainstream  GESI  issues  in  the \nsupport that it provides to local bodies; \norganizing  capacity-building  programs  for  the  decentralization  focal  units  of \nvarious line ministries47 and local body associations to ensure that the principles \nof decentralization and sector devolution are internalized; and \nproviding  capacity-building  support  to  the  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  (OAG) \nwith  foci  on  outreach  to  DDCs  and  VDCs,48 the  elaboration  of  audit  guidelines, \nand \nthe  MCPM  system, \nprocurement regulations, and accounting systems.  \n\ntools  and  programs \n\nincluding \n\nin  new \n\ntraining \n\n \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n62. \nSP1, in its support of the LGCDP, (i) conforms to the vision, policies, outcomes, and new \ninitiatives  of  the  Government;  (ii)  places  strong  emphasis  on  inclusiveness  and  gender  equity, \ntwo  outcomes  that  have  been  at  the  bedrock  of  the  new  political  movement  in  Nepal;  (iii)  is \naligned  with  the  peace-building  process;49 and  (v)  is  based  on  a  harmonized  approach  with \nother development partners. \n \n63. \n\nSP1 provides support to the LGCDP by focusing on the following tools: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe social mobilization of communities and CBOs (see Appendix 7), \nthe expanded system of block grants to local bodies so that resource scarcity is \nnot a binding constraint on strong local development action, \na  rigorous  MCPM  system  that  relies  on  performance  criteria-based  funding  to \nlocal bodies,50 \npiloting new ways of doing things in the area of service delivery, and \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n45  The  LPCs  are  constituted  with  all-party  and  civil  society  representation  and  function  as  an  early  warning \n\nmechanism to minimize conflict; they also provide support to improve government\u2013citizen interaction. \n\n46 This  activity  will  also  include  provisions  by  MLD  to  support  the  capacity  of  local  bodies  to  conduct  socio-\nenvironmental  assessments  through  contracts  with  external  parties  and  through  the  enhanced  capacity  of  the \ndistrict technical office and other suitable local entities. \n\n47 Including  the  National  Planning  Commission  Secretariat,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and \n\nCouncil of Ministers, Ministry of General Administration, and selected ministries such as health and education. \n\n48 OAG is not expected to carry out all the audits but be involved in quality assurance and oversight.  \n49 It  will  follow  conflict-sensitive  implementation  approaches  and  promote  factors  for  peace  building,  as  well  as \n\ncoordinate with LPCs to ensure that they support government\u2013citizen interactions. \n\n50 Funding will be allocated to allow a substantial increase in the Government\u2019s current annual grant support to local \nbodies nationwide and to introduce incentives for better local performance and compliance with agreed governance \nstandards through the use of the MCPM system. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n(v) \n\ncapacity building both centrally and locally so that all institutions receive support \nto attain their desired outcomes.  \n\nD. \n\nCosts and Financing Plan \n\nThe estimated costs51 for the LGCDP are based on medium-term adjustment scenarios \n\n64. \nand are illustrated in Table 1 (see also Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n \n \n\nCosts \n\n1. \n\n        Table 1.

The  Government  expects  to  address  the  funding  gap \nthrough  commitments  of  support  from  other  development  partners.  At  this  stage,  those  that \nhave  indicated  their  intention  to  support  the  program  include  the  Canadian  International \nDevelopment Agency (CIDA) for $10 million, the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International \nDevelopment for $30 million, Denmark for $15 million, Norway for $10 million, the Swiss Agency \nfor  Development  and  Cooperation  for  $4  million,  and  other  United  Nations  agencies  for  $25 \nmillion (United Nations Development Programme for $5 million, United Nations Population Fund \nfor  $9  million,  United  Nations  Volunteers  for  $0.5  million,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  for \n$8.5 million, and United Nations Capital Development Fund for $2 million). CIDA has informed \nGovernment  that  it  will  channel  its  contribution  of  C$10  million  through  a  cofinancing \narrangement with ADB. Financing from other development partners will be provided in parallel \nand not through ADB administration. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  LGCDP  by  providing  a  grant  of \n67. \n$106.3  million  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  Grant  Recipient  will  be  the  Federal \nDemocratic Republic of Nepal. \n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \nThe  program  management  structure  for  the  LGCDP  is  already  in  place  in  MLD,  which \n68. \nwill execute it (see Appendix 7). MLD will take overall responsibility for attaining the outcomes of \nthe LGCDP. To accomplish this, it has already established a national advisory committee (NAC) \nfor  coordination,  policy  advocacy,  and  supervision  of  the  program,  as  well  as  for  making \nstrategic  recommendations  concerning  its  implementation.  NAC  is  chaired  by  the  secretary  of \nMLD and guided by the policy coordination committee (PCC) that already exists in MLD. NAC \nconsists  of  senior  officials  of  MLD  and  other  sectoral  ministries,  as  well  as  representatives  of \ndevelopment partners and local body associations. The MLD secretary has appointed the joint \nsecretary  of  the  Local  Governance  Coordination  Division  as  the  part-time  national  program \ndirector (NPD), who acts as member-secretary of NAC. NAC will meet whenever necessary, but \nnot less than twice a year, to (i) provide support on policy matters related to local governance \nand  community  development,  (ii)  oversee  program  implementation  and  progress,  and  (iii) \nfacilitate cooperation and coordination among all relevant agencies and development partners. \n \n69. \nA  program  coordination  unit  (PCU)  has  been  established  under  the  Local  Governance \nCoordination  Division  of  MLD,  which  will  ensure  the  internal  coordination  of  policy  activities \n\n                                                 \n52 The  Government,  in  late  September  2008,  announced  a  national  budget  in  which  the  amount  of  grant  for  each \nvillage development committee was increased by 100%. The implications of this increase in grant amount on the \nprogram budget have not been reflected here as the Ministry of Local Development has yet to revise the LGCDP \ndocument accordingly. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nrelated  to  the  LGCDP.  The  LGCDP  is  being  managed  full-time  by  an  undersecretary  of  MLD, \nacting as program manager and heading the PCU day to day. The program manager reports to \nthe NPD, who reports in turn to the MLD secretary and NAC. The PCU is responsible for work \nplanning, monitoring and evaluation, and providing technical support to the relevant agencies as \nnecessary.  It  coordinates  the  daily  activities  of  the  various  implementing  agencies  (the  local \nbodies)53 and provides secretariat services as needed for program implementation.  \n\n70.  Within the PCU are dedicated output managers for each of the seven outputs, selected \nfrom  among  the  various  section  chiefs  of  MLD  who  are  PCU  members.  This  introduces  a \ndegree of accountability internally in MLD in terms of results-based output management. PCU \noutput  managers  meet  monthly  to  discuss  issues  regarding  program  implementation,  and  the \nPCU  will  prepare  progress  reports  every  trimester.  The  output  managers  will  be  supported  by \nseveral professional advisors, who will bring specific technical skills related to local governance \nand community development.  \n \n71. \nProgram management arrangements related to the work of LPCs are in the Ministry of \nPeace and Reconstruction (MPR).  The Local Peace Mechanism Coordination Section in MPR \nserves as the program implementation unit (PIU) for this component of the LGCDP. The PIU is \nheaded  by  an  undersecretary  and  has  two  section  officers  to  provide  administrative  support. \nThe PIU in MPR is supported by the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Division, and the MPR \nsecretary provides overall guidance to the LPC component of program work. \n \n72. \nLocally,  the  LGCDP  is  coordinated  in  municipalities  by  their  executive  officers,  with \nassistance from ward secretaries; in DDCs by local development officers, supported by a district \nprogram  facilitator;  and  in  VDCs  by  secretaries,  supported  by  social  mobilizers  as  needed. \nDDCs will also rely on the All-Party Mechanism and the integrated plan formulation committee \n(IPFC), which consists of members of political parties,54 CBOs, user groups, etc. The aim is to \nduplicate the IPFC process in VDCs and municipalities. \n \n73. \nJoint  Financing  Arrangement  (JFA)  Provisions.  As  the  Government  and  interested \ndevelopment partners in the LGCDP have expressed a strong preference for a JFA to govern \ntheir participation in the program, all the implementation arrangements specified above will be \ndetailed  in  the  JFA  when  it  is  finalized.  While  specific  program  management  arrangements \nunder the JFA cannot be ascertained in advance, these generally include the responsibilities of \neach party to the JFA, the funding mechanism, and fiduciary requirements. \n \nProvision  will  be  made  for  development  partners  party  to  the  JFA  to  meet  regularly  to \n74. \nreview  the  financial  and  operational  status  and  progress  of  the  program  and  to  commit  and \ndisburse  funds.  Finally,  under  the  JFA,  each  year  MLD,  as  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  will \nprepare  an  annual  strategic  implementation  plan  and  an  annual  work  plan  and  budget  for  the \nLGCDP.  These  will  be  reviewed  by  all  participating  development  partners  at  the  annual  joint \nreview mission. Based on the outcome of the review, the JFA development partners will commit \nresources and agree on the share of funding for the coming fiscal year. \n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nReforms supported under SP1 will be completed 48 months after grant effectiveness. \n\n \n75. \n \n \n                                                 \n53 With the exception of the LPCs, whose work will be coordinated by the district administrations. \n54 Political parties represented in the All-Party Mechanism are only the seven that signed the Comprehensive Peace \n\nAccord; in the IPFC, other parties have a presence as well. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n76. \nThe proceeds of the SP1 grant will be used to finance the costs, excluding local taxes \nand  duties,  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  those \nspecified  in  the  ineligible  list  in  Appendix  8  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources.  \n \n77. \nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans, 55  the  proceeds  of  the  SP1  grant  will  be \ndisbursed to the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal as the Grant Recipient. No supporting \nimport  documentation  will  be  required,  but  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  on  the  basis  of \ncertification provided by the Grant Recipient for a period of 12 months for eligible expenditures, \nstarting  180  days  prior  to  grant  effectiveness.  When  grant  proceeds  are  expected  to  be \ndisbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible \nimports, and (iii) imports financed under other official development assistance will be equal to or \ngreater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the year. The Government will certify \nthat  its  withdrawal  request  complies  with  this  formula.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under \nexisting procedures will be required.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n78. \nThe Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated from the proceeds \nof  the  SP1  grant  are  made  available  to  meet  the  indicative  costs  associated  with  the \nimplementation  of  the  LGCDP. 56  Counterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  support  (i)  community \norganizations, particularly of women and DAGs; (ii) the operations of DDCs and VDCs, including \nas  block  and  top-up  grants; 57 (iii)  capacity  building  for  local  bodies  through  grants;  (iv)  the \noperations of  LPCs;  and  (v)  relevant  central  Government  agencies  that  provide  policy  support \nfor decentralization. \n\n \n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n \n79.  Monitoring mechanisms for the LGCDP as described in the national program document \nwill  also  apply  for  SP1;  as  these  mechanisms  are  already  detailed  in  the  LGCDP  document, \nthey are also expected to be incorporated in the JFA when it is finalized. \n \n80. \nAs  soon  as  possible  after  grant  effectiveness,  MLD  will  develop  a  performance  M&E \nsystem based on the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), which will integrate local \nGESI indicators.58 Arrangements will be made for on-the-ground monitoring and mentoring to be \ndone by roving support-and-monitoring teams from the center consisting of key MLD, PCU, and \nline  agency  staff.  These  teams  will  operate  under  the  supervision  of  MLD  and  the  central \nprogram team. These teams will, in principle, comprise national specialists in local governance, \nsocial mobilization, local capacity building and planning, financial management, and monitoring. \nThe  roving  teams  will  have  a  dual  role:  on  the  one  hand,  provide  support  to  local  bodies  to \nmonitor their own performance and, on the other, interact with and, in some cases, contract and \nbackstop local bodies, various NGOs, and other social mobilization agencies active in the area. \nFinally, the LGAF will be involved in the independent monitoring of the program. \n \n\n                                                 \n55 ADB.  1998.  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans.  Manila \n\n(R50-98, 23 March). \n\n56 Program adjustment indicative costs and assumptions are highlighted in Supplementary Appendix E. \n57 And of municipalities from year 2 of the program. \n58 Details of the M&E system will be worked out after grant effectiveness. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\n81.  Monitoring the work of the LPCs, pursuant to the increase in resource allocation to them \nas part of this program, will be done by MPR. ADB will participate in this monitoring as part of its \ninvolvement in the monitoring of the LGCDP as a whole. \n \nFinancing from SP1 for the LGCDP will be in three tranches (see Appendix 5): the first \n82. \ntranche,  not  exceeding  $20  million,  to  be  disbursed  upon  grant  effectiveness;  the  second \ntranche,  not  exceeding  $45  million,  to  be  disbursed  upon  finalization  of  the  JFA  between  the \nGovernment  and  development  partners,  and  subject  to  the  Government  fulfilling  all  second \ntranche  release  requirements;  and  the  third  tranche,  not  exceeding  $41.3  million,  to  be \ndisbursed  within  12  months  after  the  second  tranche,  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of  all \ncorresponding tranche release requirements.  \n \nFor tranche 1 release, immediately after grant effectiveness, the Government will open a \n83. \ndeposit account and a special account at Nepal Rastra Bank. The special account will be used \nspecifically  for  depositing  and  utilizing  counterpart  funds,  i.e.,  the  rupees  generated  from  the \nproceeds of the grant. Once the JFA has been finalized, a pooled foreign exchange account at \nthe Nepal Rastra Bank will be used as the deposit account for the program. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nTo  ensure  proper  fund  management,  ADB  retains  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  grant \n84. \nproceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification  for  each  withdrawal \napplication. In this regard, ADB may also request a performance-related audit of the LGCDP to \nbe  carried  out  by  OAG  in  close  consultation  with  other  development  partners  supporting  the \nLGCDP.  As  for  reporting,  the  PCU  will  send  monthly  progress  and  status  reports  to  ADB59 on \npolicy  and  institutional  reforms.  The  progress  reports  will  be  results  based  and  describe \nprogress  on  the  implementation  schedule  and  identify  any  problems  encountered  and  the \nremedial actions taken. \n \n85. \nReporting formats for the LGCDP will be developed and provided to all local bodies. A \nrobust system for physical progress reporting, linked to an office in MLD, will be established to \nconsolidate, review, and follow up on reports. The progress, efficiency, and effectiveness of the \nLGCDP will be monitored through a regular reporting system that includes monthly, trimesterly, \nand  annual  reports.  Finally,  annual  monitoring  and  performance  reports  will  be  published  by \nMLD  and  include  both  physical  and  financial  progress,  including  major  achievements.  Once \nother  development  partners  come  on  board,  the  JFA  will  reflect  all  necessary  accounting, \nauditing, and reporting requirements for the Program. \n \n86. \nA  separate  stream  of  reports  will  be  provided  by  MPR  with  respect  to  the  work  of  the \nLPCs.  These  reports  will  be  collated  by  MPR  twice  a  year  and  forwarded  to  the  peace  and \nconflict management committee and NAC, with a copy going to ADB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n  \nProgram performance monitoring during the initial stages of the LGCDP (i.e., prior to the \n87. \nJFA being finalized) will be done by the Government and ADB. A program performance system \nwill be developed, at the latest by the time of the signing of the JFA, that will detail the relevant \nindicators  and  targets  based  on  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  will  serve  as  the \n\n                                                 \n59 In  light  of  CIDA  entering  into  a  cofinancing  arrangement  with  ADB,  once  that  arrangement  has  been  formalized \nthrough  a  memorandum  of  understanding,  currently  expected  before  end-2008,  all  program  management \narrangements that apply to ADB will also apply to CIDA. In that respect, CIDA will team up with ADB for all reviews, \nmonitoring, and other program-related actions. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\nbasis  on  which  to  monitor  performance.  The  system  will  have  these  features:  (i)  realistic \nbaseline  data  and  performance  targets;  (ii)  a  provision  to  incorporate  the  results  of  regular \nprogram monitoring; (iii) the use of such a system to better inform periodic review, particularly \nfor confirming the fulfillment of tranche policy requirements; and (iv) a provision to incorporate \nrelevant information from any associated evaluations that may be undertaken. The PCU will be \ninstrumental  in  preparing  the  program  performance  system  and  revising  it  as  necessary.  The \nJFA is expected to reflect these monitoring arrangements, as they are already incorporated in \nthe LGCDP document. \n \n88. \nA  key  component  of  the  program  performance  monitoring  system  will  be  relevant \nbaseline data. At the moment, MLD has managed through the DAG mapping exercise to collect \na  fair  amount  of  relevant  information,  and  some  development  partners,  such  as  the  United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), are helping to augment this. However, that information has \nyet to be converted to a format that would be the basis of the program performance monitoring \nsystem.  Much  of  it  is  still  in  rudimentary  form,  and  MLD  is  refining  its  content  and  structure. \nIndeed,  one  of  the  primary  tasks  during  the  program\u2019s  inception  phase  should  be  making  the \nnecessary arrangements for collecting and incorporating baseline data in reporting structures.  \n \n89. \nThe PIU in MPR will maintain a database of existing and planned LPCs, including details \nof their work. Within a month of grant effectiveness, the PIU will have developed performance \nindicators for LPCs and put in place a workable monitoring regime that can easily be adhered to. \n \n\n8. \n\nProgram Review \n\nJoint  annual  reviews  (JARs)60 for  the  program  will  be  organized  in  accordance  with  a \n\n \n90. \nschedule to be determined in the JFA. \n \n91.  Midway  through  the  LGCDP,  there  will  be  an  evaluation  of  progress  in  (i)  meeting \nprogram  outcomes,  (ii)  legislative  or  financial  actions,  (iii)  the  use  of  program  funds,  and  (iv) \ncapacity  development  measures,  particularly  at  MLD  and  the  DDCs.  The  review  will  consider \nany shifts in the policy environment for local governance pursuant to the debates in formulating \nthe new Constitution, at the core of which is expected to be the move  toward federation. This \nreview  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  LGCDP  stays  relevant  even  as  macro  and  contextual \nchanges  occur  in  the  program  environment.  There  will  be  a  final  review  at  the  end  of  the \nprogram period, to be done by an independent party, with representation from among DAGs. \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption \n\n \n92. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  the  Second  Governance \nand Corruption Action Plan were explained to and discussed with the Government and the EA \n(see  section  B.1  below).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability, \nand transparency, and in keeping with provisions that the JFA may specify, but not restricted by \nit,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  allegedly  corrupt, \n\n                                                 \n60 The  first  JAR  will  be  the  mechanism  for  proposing  changes  to  the  program  document  and  implementation \nmodalities,  etc.  ADB,  as  part  of  the  JFA,  will  monitor  program  implementation  through  periodic  progress  reports \nsubmitted  by  MLD  to  all  development  partners  and  will  be  part  of  the  joint  development  partner  missions  to  (i) \nconfirm  the  fulfillment  of  policy  requirements  for  release  of  tranche  2  and  3  funds;  (ii)  confirm  the  release  of \nadequate  funds  from  the  Government  for  LGCDP  activities;  (iii)  monitor  the  continued  applicability  of  the \nassumptions  that  may  impact  program  success,  such  as  on  political  conditions;  and  (iv)  advise  on  actions  to \nmaintain effective implementation in the program period. As the JFA is expected to be prepared within the next 6 \nmonths,  no  specific  pre-JFA  program  review  mechanism  is  specified.  Should  this  not  occur,  ADB  and  MLD  will \njointly review the program on the sixth month after grant effectiveness. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  LGCDP.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant agreement.61  \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Benefits \n\nSectoral Benefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n \n93. \nThe  benefits  and  impact  of  SP1  will  be  evident  at  various  levels.  Locally,  it  will  help \nimprove the effectiveness of service delivery through strong local bodies that will be more aware \nof  how  they  need  to  engage  with  service  recipients,  particularly  DAGs.  Through  the  LGCDP, \nSP1  will  specifically  target  community  empowerment  through  holistic  and  targeted  social \nmobilization  such  that  communities  will  be  able  to  demand  better  services,  access  greater \nresources,  and  effectively  hold  accountable  local  bodies  through,  e.g.,  relying  increasingly  on \nsocial  and  public  audits  and  public  hearings.  These  benefits  are  important.  In  an  environment \nwhere public awareness of rights in the political arena is at an all-time high, the program seeks \nto  ensure  that  these  rights  are  translated  into  opportunities  to  demand  and  attain  economic \nrights.  In  the  medium  term,  this  is  expected  to  make  local  good  governance  increasingly \npossible and emphasize inclusive development. \n \n94. \nAt  a  higher  level,  the  benefits  of  SP1  are  expected  to  be  (i)  strengthened  policy \ncoordination  among  local  bodies,  central  line  agencies  that  have  field-based  operations,  and \ncentral  planning  and  operational  bodies;  (ii)  a  workable  interim  arrangement  on  local \ngovernance and community development until a federal structure of government is in place; and \n(iii) a contribution toward building urgently needed public trust in government. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Benefits and Poverty Impact \n\n \n95. \nSP1  seeks  to  minimize  the  impact  of  vulnerabilities  to  poor  local  service  delivery.  The \nGESI  focus  of  the  program  particularly  will  target  better  access  for  women  in  DAGs  (see \nAppendix 11). In line with other relevant work of ADB on the gender theme, the GESI plan will \nbe  implemented  as part  of  ADB  support  to  the  Government.  Dedicated  support to  the  work  of \nthe LPCs in all districts where they operate now and in the future will mean that provisions will \nbe  made  to  ensure  that  women  and  representatives  from  DAGs  have  an  opportunity  to \nparticipate  in  local  affairs.62 The  LPCs  are  central  to  applying  a  conflict-sensitive  approach  to \nlocal  development,  which  the  Government  and  development  partners  accept  as  the  primary \nmeans of bringing about inclusive development and public trust in local government.  \n \n96. \nThe  impacts  of  SP1  are  expected  to  be  evident  in  the  long  term  on  poverty  reduction. \nSocially inclusive and gender-responsive service delivery is apt to help the poorest segments of \nsociety  gain  better  access  to  resources  and  opportunities.  This,  coupled  with  improvement  in \nthe environment to provide feedback to local bodies, will mean that the socioeconomic benefits \nof the program will accrue to the poor as well. Greater scrutiny by communities will ensure that \nthere  are  fewer  leakages  in  the  system,  thus  providing  more  resources  for  development \nactivities.  Finally,  there  are  political  benefits  as  well,  as  SP1  will  enhance  transparency  and \naccountability  in  local  bodies  and,  hopefully,  bring  greater  public  trust  in  Government  in  the \nmedium-to-long term. A summary social and poverty analysis is in Appendix 10. \n \n                                                 \n61 ADB will also ensure that all provisions in the JFA align with its Anticorruption Policy. \n62 The extent to which they will really be able to do so depends to a large extent on the effectiveness of local social \n\nmobilization efforts. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Benefits \n\n \n97. \nThe institutional benefits expected  from SP1 are as follows: (i) As local bodies acquire \ngreater  resources  and  effective  control  over  how  to  employ  them,  the  transaction  costs  of \nservice delivery are expected to drop. (ii) Local bodies will have opportunities to improve their \ncapacity  to  fulfill  their  mandates  more  effectively.63 (iii)  The  institutional  capacity  of  the  local \nbodies and midlevel agencies, such as the Association of District Development Committees in \nNepal,  Municipality  Association  of  Nepal,  and  National  Association  of  Village  Development \nCommittees  in  Nepal,  will  correspondingly  improve.  (iv)  Capacity  for  policy  making  and \nmonitoring  at  MLD  and  other  central  agencies  will  improve,  as  technical  assistance  will  be \nprovided for these functions. (v) Ancillary and associated entities such as the LPCs will benefit \nfrom the scope given to them to participate more effectively in interacting with local bodies and \ncommunities. \n \n\nB. \n\nRisk Assessment and Safeguards \n\n1. \n\nRisk Assessment \n\n \n98.  While  there  is  significant  commitment  to  and  enthusiasm  for  the  LGCDP  in  the \nGovernment, there are some primary risks as well. 64 \n \n99. \nPublic  Financial  Management  and  Fiduciary  Risks.  The  Government\u2019s  self-\nassessment  of  public  financial  management  in  2007  revealed  a  well  designed  but  unevenly \nimplemented system.65 In particular, significant implementation constraints were identified in the \nbudget.  Local  public  financial  management  is  considered  to  be  particularly  weak  due  to  poor \ngovernment  commitment,  small  revenue  bases,  constrained  grants,  unclear  roles  and \nresponsibilities,  and constrained  fund-flow  mechanisms.  Further,  two  relevant  risks highlighted \nin  the  country  financial  accountability  assessment  carried  out  in  May  2005  by  the  World  Bank \nand  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  are  (i)  a  lack  of \ntransparency  in  the  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfer  system;  and  (ii)  weak  reporting  and \noversight  on  the  part  of  various  agencies,  including  local  bodies.66 The  assessment  found  the \ncountry\u2019s fiduciary risks high. \n \n100.  Specific mitigating measures that are proposed to manage fiduciary risks include:67 \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nFunds flow directly from MOF to local bodies (see Supplementary Appendix D). \nMonthly reports will be sought from the Government to track budget expenditures \non relevant program items. \n\n                                                 \n63 One particular benefit that local bodies will gain from the program is capability enhancement for conducting socio-\nenvironmental  assessments  and  maintaining  adherence  to  the  safeguards  framework  in  alignment  with  the \nEnvironmental Protection Act and its associated regulations.  \n\n64 The summary governance risk assessment in Appendix 9 was updated during the Appraisal Mission in conjunction \nwith the Government and development partners. The Government has approved the aide memoire of the Appraisal \nMission. See Supplementary Appendix F for a detailed risk assessment. \n\n65 Government  of  Nepal.  2007.  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability:  Public  Financial  Management \n\nPerformance Measurement Framework 2007. Kathmandu.  \n\n66 Other identified fiduciary risks include (i) ineffective fund-flow processes, (ii) weak financial management capacity \nin local bodies and MLD, (iii) poor capacity to audit and lack of follow-up on audits, (iv) weak procurement capacity \nand experience in MLD and local bodies, and (v) weak financial management performance in local bodies. \n\n67 A  method  of  getting  a  better  handle  on  fiduciary  risks  is  to  finalize  the  JFA,  which  requires  that  a  fiduciary  risk \nassessment  be  completed  at  that  time.  The  Government  has  concurred  with  this  measure.  Through  the  JFA, \nappropriate  fiscal  controls  in  the  program,  including  continuous  monitoring  by  JFA  partners,  are  expected  to \nmitigate some of the fiduciary risks. For a more detailed analysis of the fiduciary risks in the program and mitigating \nmeasures, see Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nInitial fiduciary due diligence will be done with selected development partners to \nensure that the relevant risk mitigation measures have been incorporated in the \nLGCDP. \nAssurances  have  been  sought  from  and  given  by  the  Government  that \ncounterpart funds will be made available and that they will be spent for program-\nspecific  outputs.  Regular  monitoring  of  this  commitment  will  be  done  during \nprogram implementation.  \nThe  release  of  funds  will  be  subject  to  demonstrated  progress  in  meeting \nprogram outcomes. \nLocal  bodies  will  receive  incentives  to  improve  financial  management  from  the \nMCPM system and other measures, such as disclosure of results and public and \nsocial audits, report cards, etc. \nSupport  will  be  provided  to  OAG  toward  developing  local  audit  guidelines  and \ntraining, including assisting in the quality assurance of VDC audits. \n\n \n101.  Low Institutional Capacity. SP1 may place some demands on the institutional capacity \nof Government agencies that execute and implement it. At the moment, a particular risk in this \nregard  arises  from  non-adherence  to  Civil  Service  Act  policies  and  rules  on  staff  transfers, \nwhich  has  meant  difficulties  in  retaining  staff  in  conflict  areas.  Close  performance  monitoring \nand  targeted  technical  assistance  to  MLD  and  local  bodies  will  help  mitigate  some  of  the \nadverse effects of implementation delays due to capacity constraints. Stronger compliance with \nthe  Civil  Service  Act  will  be  an  effective  mitigating  measure  in  this  regard.  Strengthening \ninstitutional capacity is at the core of the technical assistance currently being provided to MLD \nby various development partners. The provision of specific capacity-development grants to local \nbodies is meant to partly address this risk. \n \n102.  Misgovernment and Corruption. These risks in the LGCDP stem from the following: (i) \nweaknesses  in  legislative  instruments,  such  as  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act;  (ii)  weak \ninstitutions;  (iii)  opaque  government  business  processes,  such  as  procurement  and \nintergovernmental  fiscal  transfers;  (iv)  the  lack  of  measures  to  make  local  bodies  accountable \nand  transparent;  and  (v)  weak  program  execution  and  implementation  arrangements.  The \nseverity of the risks vary, but type I risks, requiring urgent attention, are being managed partly \nby  ongoing  assistance  from  development  partners,  including  ADB,  in  specific  agencies  and \nsectors  such  as  the  Commission  for  Investigation  of  Abuse  of  Authority,  OAG,  Financial \nComptroller  General\u2019s  Office,  MLD,  etc. 68  Another  mitigating  measure  is  seeking  closer \ncompliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Local  Bodies  Financial  Administration  Regulations, \nGovernance (Management and Operation) Act, Procurement Act, Right to Information Act, etc. \n \n103.  Uncertainty in Continued Political Commitment. This could be a risk in the program, \nbut it must be said that the Government\u2019s political commitment to reforms in local governance \nand  community  development  is  currently  very  strong.  It  is  expected  to  remain  so  in  the  near \nfuture, as it is directly related to the debate on federalism, which all political parties publicly and \nconsistently  support. 69 This  has  been  evident  in  the  share  of  resources  set  aside  for  local \n\n                                                 \n68 Government commitment has remained high for this program even at a time of political uncertainty. This, coupled \nwith the fact that the present Government has put a bit more emphasis on broadly addressing misgovernment and \ncorruption,  is  likely  to  facilitate  efforts  to  contain  these  risks.  For  further  risk  analysis,  see  Appendix  9  and \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n\n69 Although the nature and scope of federalism are not yet clear, the commitment to state restructuring is manifest, \nand the LGCDP has been designed in a flexible manner to account for any shifts that may occur in the operating \nenvironment as a result of discussions on the nature of the future federal state. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n27\n\n \n\ngovernment in recent years,70 including the doubling of local body grants and accepting that top-\nup grants will be made available to local bodies that perform well.  \n \n104.  SP1 assumes that (i) the Government\u2019s commitment to reforms will remain high, (ii) the \npolitical system will be more or less stable during implementation, and (iii) development partners \nwill  continue,  singly  and  jointly,  to  be  engaged  in  the  medium  term.  All  these  assumptions \nremain  valid  to  date  and  are  expected  to  be  so  at  least  until  a  new  constitution  is  in  place \nsometime in 2010 or 2011. \n \n\n2. \n\nSafeguard Measures \n\n \n105.  SP1 will have positive direct impact on socially disadvantaged groups, including women, \nindigenous  people,  and  ethnic  minorities  (Appendix  10).  The  implications  for  the  environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  were  reviewed;  while  no  significant  adverse \nimpacts  are  anticipated,  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  a  social \nsafeguard  framework  were  prepared  and  endorsed  by  the  Government  in  case  local  bodies \ndecide  to  invest  in  physical  infrastructure  that  would  have  impact.  Appendix  12  presents  the \nsocial and environmental safeguards framework (see also Supplementary Appendix G).71 \n \n106.  As  local  bodies,  particularly  VDCs,    do  not  generally  have  any  capacity  to  conduct  the \nneeded safeguard assessments on their own, the Government has agreed to earmark specific \nresources to (i) provide technical assistance to have the assessments provided by a third party \nto  deal  with  short-term  capability  gaps  and  (ii)  develop  and  finance  a  capacity-building  plan \nwhereby officials of the district technical office and other relevant individuals will receive training \non relevant skills to deal with long-term gaps. The necessary program assurance and budgeting \nprovisions have been made in the program. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n107. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the grant agreement: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  counterpart  funds  in  local  currency  generated \nfrom  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  grant  will  be  used  to  meet  the  financial \nrequirements associated with the implementation of the LGCDP; for that purpose, \nthe  Government  will  establish  a  special  account  at  Nepal  Rastra  Bank \nimmediately  after  grant  effectiveness.  Throughout  program  implementation, \nadequate allocation of counterpart funds will be made, approved, and released in \na timely manner to ensure the proper implementation of the LGCDP.  \nOf  the  total  ADB  contribution,  the  Government  will  earmark  in  equal  amounts \nfrom each tranche and for the program period (a) $4.5 million to support the work \nof LPCs, and (b) $1.8 million to support the capacity of local bodies and MLD to \nconduct  environmental  and  social  assessments  and  manage  related  safeguard \nreview, monitoring, and reporting activities. \n\n(iii)  Within  1  month  of  grant  effectiveness,  MLD  will  have  established  a  budget \ntracking system to track the use of counterpart funds generated by the grant on a \nfour-monthly  basis  until  such  a  time  that  a  JFA  is  in  place  in  support  of  the \nLGCDP, at which time the provisions of the JFA will apply. \n\n                                                 \n70 The  share  of  expenditures  for  local  government  in  the  TYIP  is  the  highest  among  all  expenditure  categories \n\n(17.53%). \n\n71 Detailed safeguard framework documents will be incorporated in the Program Administration Manual. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n \n\n(iv)  MLD  will  ensure  that  all  local  bodies,  as  and  when  they  are  included under  the \nLGCDP,  will  be  adequately  staffed  and  provided  with  the  necessary  financial, \ntechnical,  and  other  resources  (including  equipment)  to  perform  their  functions \nunder the program. \nMLD  will  ensure  the  timely  and  effective  implementation  the  GESI  action  plan \nagreed between ADB and MLD, as well as the GESI strategy and guidelines to \nbe approved for the LGCDP. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  MLD  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  LGCDP  in  accordance  with  the \nprovisions of the social and environmental safeguards framework for the LGCDP \nto  ensure  compliance  with  ADB's  environmental  assessment  and  applicable \ngovernment  environmental  requirements,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  requirements  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples development plans. \n\n(vii)  MLD  will  ensure  the  provision  of  allocated  financial  resources  for  the  LGAF \n\nthroughout the program implementation period. \n\n(viii)  The  baseline  dataset  for  the  program  will  be  continually  updated  to  ensure  the \n\nproper application of results-based management. \n\n(ix)  MLD  will  ensure  to  review  the  program  budget  assumptions  at  the  end  of  the \ninception  phase  of  the  LGCDP;  MLD  will  make  necessary  reallocations  across \nbudget  line  items  in  keeping  with  the  agreed  strategies,  action  plans,  and \nprogram approaches that will have been developed by then. \n\n \nB. \n\nFirst Tranche Conditions \n\n108.

This means that the country \nwill soon frame arrangements for transforming the hitherto unitary state into a federal system of \ngovernment. A primary consideration of the federal nature of governance will then focus on the \nnature of local government in the country. Until a federal structure is in place, local governance \nin Nepal is characterized by the following. \n \n\n1. \n\nStructure \n\n2. \nThe administrative divisions set up under the royal regime continue to be in place. In this \nset-up, there are 14 zones, which have ceased to be meaningful; 75 districts that are varied in \nterms of geographical characteristics and, more importantly, in terms of economic endowment; \n3,915 village development committees; and 58 municipalities. Development committees exist in \nall  districts  and  are  mandated  to  lead  development  work  in  the  local  governance  unit. \nAdministrative  oversight  of  the  development  committees  is  provided  by  the  Ministry  of  Local \nDevelopment  (MLD)  whose  mandate  is  to  involve  a  majority  of  the  people  in  the  decision-\nmaking process of the governance system and empower them for overall development through \nlocal self-governance. \n \nThe system of local governance consists of village development committees (VDCs) and \n3. \nmunicipalities  at  the  lower  level  and  district  development  committees  (DDCs)  at  the  upper.  All \nVDCs  are  divided  into  nine  wards,  and  there  are  several  community  settlements  in  each. \nMunicipalities are divided into a minimum of nine wards and a maximum of 32. Wards are the \nsmallest  units  of  local  governance.  Each  district  is  divided  into  nine  to  seventeen  Ilakas  (or \nareas), which cover clusters of VDCs and municipalities. Each district has a district council and \nan executive committee. The district council is made up of DDC chairpersons, vice-chairpersons \nand  members,  the  district\u2019s  member(s)  of  Parliament,  mayors  and  deputy  mayors  of \nmunicipalities,  VDC  chairpersons  and  vice-chairpersons,  and  six  nominated  members.  The \ndistrict council meets annually to discuss and approve DDC policies, programs, and budget. The \ndistrict  executive  committee  runs  daily-to-day  DDC  affairs,  and  MLD  appoints  secretaries  in \nVDCs,  executive  officers  in  municipalities,  and  local  development  officers  in  DDCs.  It  also \ndeputes  additional  professional  staff  such  as  accountants,  engineers,  and  planners  to  DDCs. \nLocal  bodies  generally  appoint  lower-level  staff,  though  some  DDCs  have  started  to  appoint \nprofessional staff by themselves. \n \n\n2. \n\nLegal and Policy Environment \n\n4. \nThe  current  bases  for  decentralization  in  Nepal  are  the  stipulations  in  the  Interim \nConstitution  of  20071 and  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act  (LSGA),  1999.  The  Act  gives  VDCs, \nmunicipalities, and DDCs greater political, administrative, and financial powers to lead, facilitate, \n\n                                                 \n1  The Interim Constitution makes several provisions on devolution, including that (i) interim bodies are to be created \nlocally  as per  consensus among political parties, (ii) a balanced approach is  to be taken in resource mobilization \nand allocation and in the equitable distribution of development results, and (iii) the roles and responsibilities of local \nbodies are to be delineated to make them more accountable in the planning and implementation of local services \n(special attention to be given to uplift socially and economically backward communities in revenue mobilization and \nallocation). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n36 \n \n \n\nand manage local affairs. Other relevant legislative, institutional, and policy instruments on local \ngovernance include the (i) Local Bodies Fiscal Commission (2002), (ii) Local Body Finance and \nAdministration  Regulations  (2007),  and  (iii)  Governance  (Management  and  Operation)  Act, \n2008.2 Finally, the Government\u2019s emphasis on decentralization, as it relates to planning, is best \ncontained  in  the  Three  Year  Interim  Plan  (FY2008\u20132010),  which,  while  necessarily  interim  in \nnature in line with the interim political arrangements currently in place, is very specific about the \nvision, objectives, and methodologies for strengthening local governance.  \n\n \n\nIn  2007,  the  Government  prepared  a  White  Paper  on  Local  Development  and  Self-\n5. \nGovernance,  which  encourages  (i)  functional  devolution  to  local  bodies  for  greater  self-\ngovernance;  (ii)  awareness  raising  to  transform  the  state  machinery  to  become  more \nparticipatory,  responsive,  accountable,  inclusive,  and  transparent;  (iii)  a  purification  process \nfrom  the  leadership  to  eradicate  corruption,  unfair  norms,  favoritism,  partisanship,  delays,  and \nmisappropriation; and (iv) targeted  programs for poor areas and communities to make service \ndelivery more equitable and accessible. \n \nA particular aspect of this policy environment is that the country is now genuinely moving \n6. \naway  from  the  simple  notion  of  decentralization  to  the  more  broad-based  and  politically  more \npowerful  and  meaningful  one  of  devolution.  The  policy  environment  is  vastly  facilitated  at  this \nstage  by  the  harmonized  approach  among  Government  and  development  partners  on  how  to \nproceed with local governance and community development. \n \nB. \n\nSituational Analysis  \n\n1. \n\nSocial and Poverty Indicators \n\n7. \nThe  measures  mentioned  above  are  of  recent  origin,  and  their  impact  has  yet  to  be \nnoticeably  felt.  In  the  meantime,  gross  spatial  inequity  establishes  the  need  to  fundamentally \nalter the paradigm of local governance.3 While poverty has declined across all regions, poverty \nlevels  are  still  high  in  the  remote  Midwestern  region  (where  the  poverty  rate  is  45%)  and \nFarwestern region (41%), compared with 27% in the Western and Central regions and 29% in \nthe Eastern region. The 11% point drop in poverty is distributed unevenly across different caste, \nethnic,  and  minority  groups.  In  the  last  decade,  poverty  declined  most  significantly  in  upper \ncaste groups (by 46% in the upper caste Brahmin and Chhetri group) but only by 21% among \nthe lower caste Dalits, 10% among the hill Janajatis, and 6% among the Muslims.  \n \nGender  disparities  in  terms  of  access  to  social,  economic,  and  political  opportunities \n8. \npersist.  Women  have  a  lower  literacy  rate  (38.2%)  compared  with  men  (69.3%),  less \nrepresentation  in  bureaucracy  (only  12.7%  of  civil  servants),  and  less  access  to  productive \nresources. Gender disparities are more pronounced in rural areas than in urban. Women from \nsocially  excluded  groups  and  regions  are  even  poorer  and  have  lower  educational  and  health \nstatus. There is a strong gender dimension to political exclusion, with women\u2019s representation in \nthe current Constituent Assembly at only 18%.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  The  Act  spells  out  administrative  functions  and  the  responsibility  of  officials  at  different  levels,  including  work \nprocedures to be adopted in government administration. It mandates, inter alia, keeping a citizen charter, providing \nmobile  services,  determining  service  fees  on  the  basis  of  social  justice,  setting  up  a  governance  reform  unit  in \ngovernment  agencies,  conducting  public  hearings,  managing  grievances,  setting  up  monitoring  and  evaluation \ncommittees, and the submission of annual reports by Government agencies.  \n\n3  Table A2.1 shows that, while Nepal as a whole performs poorly in various social indicators, spatial concentrations \n\nof poverty and depravation are even more profound. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2   \n\n37\n\nTable A2.1: Social and Poverty Indicators \n\nComparator Period \n\nLatest Year \n\nPeriod \n\n \nIndicators \nA.

Manila (May). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n38 \n \n \n\n \n10. \nThe  failures  in  Table  A2.2  notwithstanding,  there  have  been  some  achievements.  In \nparticular,  several  sectoral  functions,  such  as  in  agricultural  extension,  have  been  devolved; \nrevenue  sharing  arrangements  are  in  place  in  the  tourism  sector,  hydropower,  etc.;  and  a \nsystem  of  minimum  conditions  and  performance  measures  has  been  instituted  for  transferring \nadditional funds to local bodies. \n \nC. \n\nFuture Steps \n\nIt is clear that, until federalism is firmly in place, efforts to strengthen local governance in \n\n11. \nNepal will have to be centered on the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nInclusiveness and empowerment for downward accountability. These are at \nthe  core  of  the  outcomes  of  the  Interim  Constitution.  Disadvantaged  groups \n(DAGs) have for too long been left out of the governance process, and for them \nto  better  participate  in  local  governance  and  receive  services  more  effectively \nand  equitably  it  is  critical  for  government  to  specifically  target  and  empower \nthem. \nCapacity of local bodies for service delivery. To better enable local bodies to \nprovide services effectively, equitably, and inclusively, their capacity needs to be \nsubstantially  upgraded.  This  refers  not  only  to  capacity  related  to  physical \ninfrastructure4 but also to financial resources and technical expertise, as well as \nchanges in attitude toward public service. \nLegislative  arrangements  for  local  governance.  This  is  evident  in  (a)  the \nLSGA, 1999, needing a substantive revamp as it conflicts with various other acts; \nand  (b)  the  absence  of  a  Local  (Government)  Service  Act  means  the  center \ncontinues to dictate human resource management policies and practices in local \nbodies, which is neither desirable nor practical. \nStrengthened  associated  institutions.  While  the  absence  of  local  elected \nofficials has led to intransparent, often ad hoc, and politically motivated decision \nmaking,  it  is  not  likely  that  local  elections  will  take  place  any  time  soon.  In  the \nmeantime, the Government will need to ensure that interim local bodies are fully \nfunctional and that other associated institutions are strengthened. \nHolistic  approach.  For  too  long,  work  on  local  governance  has  been  ad  hoc. \nDonor  harmonization  has  generally  been  missing,  and  this  has  forced  the \nGovernment  to  prepare  guiding  principles  for  a  harmonized  approach  to  donor \nactivity in this sector; the LGCDP is a result of this effort. \nReconsider  the  size  and  number  of  local  bodies.  As  part  of  the  work  on \nrestructuring  the  country  along  federal  lines,  it  will  be  essential  to  thoroughly \nreview  the  size  and  number  of  local  bodies. 5 The  vast  variance  in  resource \nendowment and other economic conditions among the presently constituted local \nbodies requires consideration of a more streamlined local governance system. \n\n \n12. \nneed to be sustained.6 Its proposed LGCDP is in response to this necessity. \n\nThe Government has made some positive moves in the Three-Year Interim Plan, which \n\n                                                 \n4  Some VDCs have no permanent office or updated records. MLD estimates that 1,216 VDC buildings in 44 districts \n\nwere completely destroyed during the conflict. \n\n5  Concerns  have  been  expressed  about  the  feasibility  of  the  existing  structure  and  number  of  local  bodies.  It  is \nestimated that more than 90% of VDCs, 40% of municipalities, and 25% of DDCs depend on government grants \neven for providing an honorarium to elected officials and to cover their basic administrative expenses. \n\n6  For example, the sectoral allocation of development expenditures in the plan (in 2006\u20132007 constant prices) shows \nthat expenditures for local development are by far the greatest among all sectors (17.53% of total expenditures). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n39 \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX  \n(Major Donors and Relevant Governance Areas) \n\nDevelopment partners are active in Nepal in areas similar to what is being proposed in \n\nTable A3: Development Partners\u2019 Work in Nepal on Program-Related Areas \n\n \n\n \n1. \nthe LGCDP (Table A3). \n \n\nDevelopment \nPartners \nCanadian \nInternational \nDevelopment \nAgency \n\n \nProgram \n\nLocal \nDevelopment \nFacility \nSahakarya\u2014\nBuilding Self-\nReliant \nCommunities I \n\nDanish \nInternational \nDevelopment \nAssistance \n\nHuman Rights \nand Good \nGovernance \nProgram \n\nUnited \nKingdom \nDepartment \nfor \nInternational \nDevelopment \n(DFID) \nFinland \n\nGTZ \n\nEnabling State \nProgram \n\nFund for Local \nCooperation \n\nPoverty \nAlleviation in \nSelected Rural \nAreas of Nepal  \n\nUrban \nDevelopment \nThrough Local \nEfforts \n\nNetherlands \n\nNorway \nSwiss Agency \nfor \nDevelopment \n\nDecentralized \nGovernment \nAdvisory \nSupport \nDLGSP \nRights, \nDemocracy, \nand Inclusion \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and Areas of Focus \nAddresses basic human needs of women, \npoor, and disadvantaged groups to mitigate \nthe effects of the conflict. \nAims to improve socioeconomic conditions of \nselected communities by promoting equitable \nand representative CBOs capable of \nmanaging local resources and interacting with \nlocally elected bodies and government \nagencies.  \nProgram now in its second phase with the  \nobjective of establishing a functional and \ninclusive democracy based on respect for \nhuman rights.

Consequently, \nthe  fiduciary  risk  assessment  (FRA)1 focuses  on  Nepal\u2019s  country  systems  for  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) and procurement. Since roughly 63% of funding from development partners \nwill be used to finance an expanded block grant (EBG),2 the FRA will specifically look into the \nrisks attached to the management and administration of that grant by local bodies. Finally, the \nFRA will include some observations on the program budget.  \n \nB. \n\nFiduciary Risks at the National Level \n\nNepal\u2019s  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  PFM  ranks  amongst  the  best  that  can  be \n2. \nfound  in  developing  countries,  but  the  gap  between  that  solid  framework  and  its  practical \nimplementation is large at all stages of the budget cycle. The resulting fiduciary risk environment \nis assessed as high. As highlighted in the public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) \nassessment,  development  partners  have  been  responding  to  fiduciary  risks  by  by-passing \nnational systems rather than addressing the risks inherent in them.3 A promising feature of the \nrecent  PEFA  exercise  is  that  it  includes  an  action  plan,  which  is  currently  prioritized  by  the \nFinancial  Comptroller  General\u2019s  Office  (FCGO)4 and  is  expected  to  be  available  by  end-2008. \nThe action plan provides a platform on which to base a coherent approach to PFM reforms.   \n \n3. \nTable  A4.1  highlights  the  PEFA  indicators  and  proposed  mitigating  actions  that  are \nespecially  relevant  to  the  LGCDP.  The  proposed  risk-mitigation  measures  either  reflect  the \naction plan that is attached to the PEFA assessment or the risk-mitigation measures that have \nbeen included in the LGCDP document.

\n\nFiduciary Risks at the Local Level: EBG and MCPM System  \n\nThe  EBG  and  the  minimum  conditions  and  performance  measures  (MCPM)  system5 \n4. \nrepresent  the  first  systematic  and  nationwide  approach  to  promote  good  governance,  notably \nincluding prudent local PFM.6  The EBG is unconditional7 and will thus increase the volume of \n\n                                                 \n5  Details of the MCPM system and the EBG are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n6  Component  2  of  the  LGCDP  is  a  nationwide  roll  out  of  the  MCPM  pilot,  which  has  been  successfully  tried  in  25 \ndistricts since fiscal year 2005. The Government subsequently decided to introduce the system for all local bodies. \n7  The  term  \u201cunconditional\u201d  is  used  to  denote  the  multi-sectoral  nature  of  the  EBG,  which  distinguishes  it  from  the \nwide array of conditional sector-specific grants currently transferred to the districts. However, \u201cunconditional\u201d does \nnot mean that there are no constraints on the use of the  grant. First, these constraints are  provided  by the  legal \nand  regulatory  framework  for  financial  management  and  administration,  including  requirements  relating  to  the \npreparation  of  annual  plans  and  budgets.  Further  constraints  are  then  provided  by  the  application  of  the  MCPM \nsystem, which promotes compliance with existing rules and regulations. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n43 \n\ndiscretionary  resources  under  the  direct  purview  of  DDCs.  Its  key  feature,  however,  is  that \nactual allocation is never an entitlement but subject to compliance with minimum conditions and \nthen further fixed in accordance with an annual performance assessment. The actual size of the \ngrant is thus adapted to proven performance capacity in key functional areas, mainly relating to \nPFM,  and  so  provides  fiscal  incentives  for  compliance  with  the  existing  legal  and  regulatory \nframework  that  guides  the  operations  of  local  bodies.  This  means  that,  by  design,  the  MCPM \nsystem substantially mitigates local fiduciary risks.   \n \nA second risk-mitigating feature of the EBG is that its basic allocation is based on a clear \n5. \nand  transparent  formula.  This  positively  distinguishes  the  EBG  from  the  vast  majority  of \nconditional  grants  that  flow  into  districts  and  are  not  formula  based,  and  are  thus  open  to \nunwarranted discretion in their allocation.  \n \n6.  \nMinimum conditions are the basic fiduciary safeguard in the system. Local bodies that \nfail to meet any of the minimum conditions are ineligible to receive funds under the EBG in the \ncoming  fiscal  year,  except  for  a  notional  amount  that  will  allow  them  to  perform  certain  key \nactivities. The minimum conditions address three functional areas:8 (i) planning and budgeting, \n(ii) financial management and administration, and (iii) transparency requirements.  \n \n7. \nPerformance measures determine whether local bodies will receive a reward on top of \ntheir basic allocation or be sanctioned. The performance measures cover eight functional areas: \n(i) planning and program management, (ii) budget management, (iii) financial management, (iv) \nfiscal  effort,  (v)  budget  release  and  program  implementation,  (vi)  communication  and \ntransparency,  (vii)  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (viii)  internal  organization  and  asset \nmanagement. The effect of the MCPM system on the allocation of the EBG is displayed below. \n \n\nTable A4.2: Application of the MCPM System \n\n \nPerformance Rating and Conditions \nNoncompliance with any of the minimum conditions  \nFailure to obtain minimum score in any one of the functional areas of \n\nperformance measures  \n\nPassed all measures and obtained score between 36 and 50  \nPassed all measures and obtained score between 51 and 65 \nPassed all measures and obtained score between 66 and 79 \nPassed all measures and obtained score 80 or above  \n\nReward/Sanction \n(for the coming fiscal year) \n\nNo EBG \n \nSanction, 20% reduction in EBG  \nStatic, neither increase or decrease \nReward, 20% increase in EBG  \nReward, 25% increase in EBG \nReward, 30% increase in EBG \n\nEBG = expanded block grant, MCPM = minimum conditions and performance measures. \nSource: Government of Nepal. \n\n \n8. \nQuality  Assurance  and  Corruption.  The  LGCDP  has  introduced  several  quality-\nassurance measures to safeguard the integrity of the MCPM system, i.e., to rule out corruption \nin  the  assessment  process  and/or  the  allocation  of  the  corresponding  block  grants.  First,  the \nallocation of the block grant is done on the basis of a clear and transparent formula. Second, the \nannual  assessment  of  local  bodies  is  contracted  out  to  the  private  sector  following  existing \nregulations  for  national  competitive  bidding.  Third,  the  indicators  that  are  used  to  assess \nminimum  conditions  and  performance  levels  are  all  taken  from  existing  legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks, thus minimizing discretion in the assessment. Fourth, assessments are carried out \nin  the  presence  of  representatives  from  MLD  or  LBFC,  who  will  have  to  sign  off  on  the \nassessment  report.  Fifth,  the  results  of  the  assessment  are  vetted  and  summarized  by  LBFC, \nand  the  corresponding  allocations  are  forwarded  to  the  MCPM  supervision  committee  for  final \nendorsement.  Sixth,  local  bodies  are  allowed  to  appeal  against  the  outcome  of  the \n\n                                                 \n8  After  the  reinstatement  of  elected  local  governments,  a  fourth  area  will  focus  on  the  functioning  of  political \n\ncommittees. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n44 \n \n \nassessment.9 Finally, both the results of the annual assessments and the corresponding block \ngrant are announced in local and national media such as newspapers and radio.  \n \n9. \nEquitable  Utilization  of  the  Block  Grant.  Several  requirements  ensure  the  socially \ninclusive and gender-responsive utilization of the EBG. These include (i) the poverty orientation \nof  the  allocation  formula; 10 (ii)  the  proposed  mandatory  requirement  to  reserve  20%  of  the \ndistrict level EBGs for investments directly benefiting women and disadvantaged groups (DAGs); \n(iii) the proposed prioritization in VDCs of investments that benefit women, children, DAGs, and \nthe disabled; (iv) support for a range of community-driven initiatives like public and social audits \nand public hearings; (v) special support to DAGs and/or the organizations representing them to \nstrengthen their interaction with and voice in local governance, including their ability to set own \npriorities  and  attain  resources  to  fund  them;  and  (vi)  support  to  existing  district  coordination \ncommittees of Dalits, Janajatis, and women. \n \nD. \n\nFiduciary Risks at the Program Level \n\nNational Program Budget. The budget has generally been well prepared, and the rigor \n10. \nof the overall estimates of required resources cannot be questioned. In particular, the estimates \nwith regard to the top-up part of component 2, representing roughly 63% of development partner \ncontributions, have been well worked out on the bases of clear and justifiable assumptions. With \nregard to components 1 and 3, however, there are several budget line items that need further \nclarification.  The  Government  has  committed  to  providing  the  needed  clarity  in  the  form  of \na \u201dnote to budget,\u201d in which the assumptions underlying the various line items will be detailed. \nThe budget assumptions will be further reviewed and necessary reallocations across budget line \nitems will be done at the end of the inception phase of the LGCDP at end-2008, in keeping with \nthe agreed strategies, action plans, and program approaches that will have been developed by \nthen.  Finally,  one  of  the  conditions  for  the  release  of  the  second  tranche  funds  concerns  the \nfinalization of the JFA, which will be informed by a comprehensive, program-specific FRA. \n \n11. \nInsufficient Funding. The risk that sufficient funds may not be available is mitigated by \n(i) the Government\u2019s commitment to the LGCDP of $260.8 million and (ii) the intent of several \ndevelopment partners to support the program under a single programmatic framework and the \nJFA, which is clearly stated in a letter of intent signed by development partners.  \n \n12. \nRisk Mitigation Measures for the First Tranche. A substantial part of the first tranche \nwill  be  used  to  finance  the  top-up  of  the  existing  grants  and  will  thus  be  subjected  to  the  risk \nmitigation measures provided by the MCPM system. Government has already endorsed a fund-\nflow  mechanism  that  will  allow  for  the  direct  transfer  of  funds  from  the  FCGO  to  the  District \nTreasury Control Office, thus reducing the scope for delays and possible leakages in the system. \nThird,  ADB  has  specified  in  its  program  document  its  right  to  audit  the  use  of  grant  proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification for each withdrawal. \n \n13. \nADB has sought and received an assurance from the Government that it will continue to \nengage  on  the  FRA  and  mitigating  measures  so  that  the  program  can  be  substantially \nstrengthened. Further details on the fiduciary risk assessment can be found in Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n\n                                                 \n9  If  so,  another  assessment  team  will  be

The  Government  concurs  that  it  is  aligned  with  its  own  vision  of  local \ngovernance reforms in the present context. The primary caveat in the program approach is that \nmany  contextual  elements  of  subprogram  2  and  its  components  cannot  be  predetermined, \nrequiring a processing mission for subprogram 2 to determine them and assess their alignment. \n \n\nPeriod \nOverriding \ngoal \n\nMain \noutcomes \n\nTotal costs \n\nTable A6.1: Program Cluster Approach \n      Governance Support Program Cluster \n\n2008\u20132015 \nSocial and economic transformation to build a new  Nepal through (i) a capable \nand accountable government at all levels of the state that provides effective and \ninclusive  services  and  (ii)  empowered  communities  that  engage  actively  with \ngovernment to hold it accountable. \n\u2022  Better local operating environment \n\u2022  Fully functional local governments \n\u2022  Capable and accountable local governments \n\u2022  Stronger community organizations and disadvantaged groups \nInclusive and participatory service delivery systems in place \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Supportive central agencies and processes \n\u2022  Strong national system and government leadership in the sector \nTBD \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nCentral \n\nPeriod \nLevels \nand \nareas \nof \nfocus \n\nSubprogram 1 (Support to LGCDP) \n2008\u20132012 \n\u2022  Policy framework for devolution \n\nand local governance \n\n\u2022  Capacity enhancement in central \n\n\u2022 \n\nGovernment institutions to \nbackstop and support local bodies \n\nMidlevel \n\n\u2022  Support to midlevel agencies  \n\u2022  Midlevel agencies input in state \n\n\u2022  Support to midlevel agencies \n \n\nSubprogram 2 (tentative)a \n\n2012\u20132015 \n\u2022  Central BPR and change \n\nmanagement \nIntergovernmental fiscal and \nadministrative system \n\n\u2022  Legal and statutory framework of \nlocal governments in federal \ngovernment \n\n\u2022  Civil service\u2013local government \n\nservice interactions \n\nservice \n\ndelivery \n\ngroups \n\n\u2022  Operationalizing local government \n\n\u2022  Good governance in local service \n\n\u2022  Enhanced capability of local \n\ngovernments for service delivery \n\u2022  Support to CBOs and disadvantaged \n\n\u2022  MCPM system \n\u2022  Social and community mobilization \n\n \n\nLocal \n\nrestructuring exercise \n\u2022  Capacity building of key \nintermediate institutions \n\u2022  Support to communities and \n\nCBOs, including empowerment of \ndisadvantaged groups \n\n\u2022  Social and community mobilization \n\u2022  Greater fiscal resources to local \n\nbodies \n\nbodies \n\n\u2022  Enhanced capability of all local \n\n\u2022  Local service delivery \n\nmechanisms and processes \n\u2022  Good governance in local service \n\ndelivery \n\n\u2022  MCPM system \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n \n52 \n \n\n \n\n  Costs \n\nFinan-\ncing \n\nGovernmentb \nDevelopment \nPartners \nof which ADB \n\nContext and Assumptions \n(at the beginning of the \nsubprogram, unless \notherwise mentioned) \n\n \n\nSubprogram 1 (Support to LGCDP) \n\nSubprogram 2 (tentative)a \n\n\u2022  Strengthening LPCs \n$468 million (tentative) \n\n$260.8 million \n$191.3 million (tentative) \n\nTBD \n \nTBD \nTBD \n\n$106.3 million \n\u2022  Peace process and national \nreconstruction continues \n\n\u2022  Deliberations on new constitution \n\u2022  Existing local body mechanisms in \n\nplace \n\n\u2022  Consensus-based politics \n\u2022  New constitution in place by end \n\nof the subprogram \n\n\u2022  Three Year Interim Plan \n\u2022  New economic plan by an elected \n\ngovernment by 2012 \n\u2022  Harmonized approach of \n\ndevelopment partners in support \nof local governance \n\n$50 million (tentative) \n\u2022  Federal structure, including \n\nstreamlined local governments \n\n\u2022  Restructured civil service \n\u2022  New constitution in place \n\u2022  Local government framework in \n\nplace for local service, new roles for \ncentral bodies, etc. \n\n\u2022  Elected local governments by end of \n\nsubprogram 2 \n\nArea of \nFocus \nRationale for \nSP2 \n\nBPR = business process reengineering, CBOs = community-based organization, LPC = local peace committee, \nMCPM = minimum conditions and performance measures, TBD = to be determined. \na  This  will be developed and confirmed toward the end of  subprogram 1, with the results of the subprogram 1 \nmidterm  evaluation  in  mind.

Provision  has  already  been  made  in  the  Country  Programming \nMission (2008) for subprogram 2, which the Government has endorsed. \n\nb  Including own revenue of local bodies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n2. \nRegarding the program cluster modality of providing support to the local governance and \ncommunity  development  sector,  it  is  essential  to  discuss  the  tentative  outcomes  and \ncomponents, including policy directions of subprogram 2. These are detailed in Table A6.2.1 \n \n\nTable A6.2: Tentative Outline of SP2 on Local Governance and Community Development \nReforms \n\nDetails \n\nLocal  governance  and  community  development  is  complex  in  any  jurisdiction;  in  Nepal,  it  is  even \nmore  so  as  the  country  debates  the  structure  of  a  new  Nepal,  one  in  which  a  federal  form  of \ngovernment will replace the existing one. The first cluster of support in this regard focuses primarily \non  local  governance  and  community  development  (i.e.,  with  a  much  more  local  focus).  Once  the \nfederal structure is in place, hopefully in the next 3\u20134 years, a program will be needed to sustain the \nnew political arrangement. SP2 provides it, and cueing the Government now about the program to \ncome 4 years later will hopefully enable a better and more rigorous program. \n \n\nAssumptions  The Government will be able to continue reforms in this sector under the following assumptions: (i) \npolitical  stability  at  the  center,  (ii)  the  maintenance  of  peace,  (iii)  the  constitutional  basis  of  state \nrestructuring complete or well under way, (iv) institutional realignment to support local governance, \n(v) strong central level policy coordination to support local governance, and (vi) all preparations for \nlocal elections done or the elections themselves completed. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  This is a tentative formulation, and the Government has confirmed that a separate programming mission will have \nto be fielded prior to the end of subprogram I to finalize the program objectives and components, including program \nimplementation and funding arrangements. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nArea of \nFocus \nObjectives \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n53\n\nDetails \n\nThe  objectives  of  SP2  are  to  support  the  Government  in  strengthening  the  federal  form  of \ngovernment  with  its  consequent  impact  on  ensuring  that  subnational  governments  continue  to  be \naccountable  and  to  provide  services  effectively  and  inclusively.  One  of  the  objectives  of  SP2  is  to \nensure a strong central Government, since its role in a federal state will vary dramatically from what \nit is currently.  \n \n\nPolicy directions: Policy directions that will be reflected in SP2 include the following: \n\nGender \nequality \n\n \n\nStronger focus on gender equality, as evident in the mainstreaming of these issues in government \noperations,  including  at  the  local  level.  To  this  end,  the  gender-equality  focus  of  SP1  will  remain \nrelevant, including the GESI strategy developed in SP1. \n\nSocial \nmobilization \n \n\nSocial mobilization will continue to be the primary means to raise the awareness of disadvantaged \ngroups that may still be left out of the impacts of SP1. Social mobilization is expected to continue to \nbe both holistic across spatial units and targeted on particular communities and themes. \n\nDevolution \n \n\nCommunity \ndevelopment, \nand inclusive-\nness \n \nGood \ngovernance \n\nService \ndelivery \n\nLocal \nfinancing \n\nDevolution  is  expected  to  be  the  primary  state  mechanism  for  center\u2013local  relations,  having \nreplaced the narrow focus on decentralization, if the political leadership is willing to be bold and the \ncurrent  ideas  on  federalism  (i.e.,  fewer  VDCs  and  replacing  DDCs  with  provinces)  are  put  into \npractice. \n \nCommunity development and inclusiveness are expected to go hand-in-hand, and the policy bases \nfor  this  will  be  various  proclamations  made  recently  by  the  Government.  The  term  \u201dinclusiveness\u201d \nwill  likely  have  been  better  nuanced  so  that  local  governments  and  others  are  aware  of  how  to \nemphasize it in their work. \n \nGood  governance  centrally  and  locally  will  continue  to  be  the  mainstay  of  the  political  economy  in \ntransparency,  accountability,  participation,  and  rights-based \nSP2. \napproaches to development are expected to be the focus in SP2. Accountability in particular is likely \nto take on a political hue as local elections will likely have been completed either by the start of SP2 \nor during its initial years. \n \nService delivery will continue to be the primary focus of SP2 because the functions of local bodies \nwill not have shifted even in a federal form of government. It is arguable, though, that there may well \nbe other service providers encouraged to enter the sector. \n\nIn  particular,  notions  of \n\nPolicy  directions  in  local  financing  are  expected  to  be  geared  toward  ensuring  that  (i)  local  bodies \nhave  greater  access  to  own-source  revenues,  (ii)  performance  grants  continue  to  be  key  in \nrewarding local bodies that do well, and (iii) a greater degree of equalization among local bodies will \nbe evident, as this is currently skewed toward districts in the south and with urban pockets. \n\nStructural and \nfunctional \nadjustment \n\nFunctional \nallocation and \naccountability \n\n \n\nDuring  SP2,  the  functions  of  local  governments,  as  they  are  expected  to  have \ngraduated from being local bodies to being governments following local elections, \nare  expected  to  be  exclusive.  In  other  words,  only  what  the  central  Government \ndoes  will  be  specified,  and  everything  else  will  be  the  responsibility  of  local \ngovernments. In such a scenario, local governments will be solely accountable for \nservice  delivery  and  other  functions  of  the  state  at  the  local  level.  The \naccountability  of  the  central  Government  will  be  restricted  to  the  macro \nenvironment of policy coordination, monitoring support, etc. \n \nBy the inception of SP2, the country will likely have determined the nature of the \nfederal  form  of  government,  including  the  number  and  design  of  provincial  and \nlocal governments. This will facilitate subnational planning.  \n \nGiven  the  assumption  of  greater  authority  and  accountability  of  subnational \ngovernments during SP2, review of their performance will be carried out by (i) the \ngovernments  themselves  through  the  usual  self-review  mechanisms  such  as \naudits,  etc.;  (ii)  civil  society  and  other  nongovernment  entities  that  will  use  the \nresults  of  tools  such  as  citizen  card  surveys,  public  and  social  audits,  public \n\nLocal \ngovernment \nperformance \nreview \nmechanism \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n \n54 \n \n\n \n\nArea of \nFocus \n\nTentative \npolicy actions \nfor SP2 \n\nDetails \n\nhearings, etc., to demand better performance from local governments; and (iii) the \ncentral  Government  in  specific  cases,  such  as  when  conditional  funds  are \ntransferred  for  a  particular  infrastructure  project,  to  ensure  that  resources  are \nused effectively and accountably. \n \nDuring  SP2,  there  will  likely  be  some  significant  changes  in  the  legal  and \nregulatory  bases  of  local  government  work.  The  new  constitution  that  is  to  be \ndrafted will specify a federal form of government. Specific laws that will have been \namended or promulgated anew include the Local Self-Governance Act, the Local \n(Government)  Service  Act,  and  others  that  will  relate  to  the  powers  of  local \ngovernments  to  carry  out  their  work  independent  of  control  from  the  center. \nProcurement  regulations  may  undergo  amendments,  as  they  currently  have \nseveral weaknesses.  \n \n\nChanges to \nlaws and \nregulations \n \n\nAs  ADB  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  reform  efforts  in  local  governance  and  community \ndevelopment  using  a  program  cluster  approach,  a  tentative  set  of  policy  actions  for  the  second \ncluster program could include the following: \n1.  All central sectoral line agencies such as health, education, transport, agriculture, etc., will have \nundertaken  a  business  process  reengineering  exercise  to  better  align  their  functions  and \noperations  with the requirements of a federal system of government, with particular respect to \nsectoral devolution to local governments. \n\n2.  The intergovernmental fiscal and administrative system will have been reviewed and amended \n\nto remove bottlenecks and allow local governments to operate more effectively. \n\n3.  The legal and statutory framework of local governments will have been clarified, and there will \n\nbe no loopholes in the legal bases of their functions and powers. \n\n4.  A Local (Government) Service Act will have been promulgated, specifying the manner in which \n\nlocal governments can manage their own human resources. \n\n5.  Midlevel  agencies  such  as  the  Association  of  District  Development  Committees  in  Nepal, \nMunicipality Association of Nepal, and National Association of Village Development Committees \nin Nepal\u2014or whatever local government associations will be in place then, in keeping with the \nform  of  subnational  governments\u2014will  be  strengthened  to  provide  policy  and  operational \nsupport to local governments. \n\n6.  Local service delivery mechanisms will have been strengthened. \n7.  Community organizations, particularly of disadvantaged communities and women\u2019s groups, will \n\ncontinue to be strengthened so that they can better engage local governments. \n\n8.  The MCPM system of fiscal transfers to local governments will have been reviewed and refined, \nkeeping  in  mind  the  policies  that  will  be  in  place  to  strengthen  intergovernmental  fiscal \ntransfers.  There  is  apt  to  be  some  form  of  central  grant  system,  and  the  MCPM  system  is \nexpected to continue to play a key role in providing incentives to local governments to perform. \n\n \nThese  tentative  policy  actions  based  on  the  situation  during  SP1  are  expected  to  be  the  focus  of \nSP2. They will undergo fundamental review as SP1 draws to a close. \n  \n\nDDC  =  district  development  committee,  GESI  =  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion,  MCPM  =  minimum \nconditions and performance measures, SP1 = subprogram 1, SP2 = subprogram 2, VDCs = village development \ncommittees. \na  This  will be developed and confirmed toward the end of  subprogram 1, with the results of the subprogram 1 \nmidterm  evaluation  in  mind.  A  separate  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  will  be  prepared  and \nsubmitted  to  the  Board  for  consideration.  Provision  has  already  been  made  in  the  Country  Programming \nMission (2008) for subprogram 2, which the Government has endorsed. \n\nb  Including own revenue of local bodies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n55\n\n \nA. \n\nAt the Center \n\nPROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n1. \nThe Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP) will be executed \nby the Ministry of Local Development (MLD), which will take overall responsibility for the program \nand  establish  a  national  advisory  committee  (NAC)  for  policy  advocacy  and  coordinating  and \nsupervising  the  program,  as  well  as  for  making  strategic  recommendations  concerning  its \nimplementation. NAC will be chaired by the secretary of MLD and will consist of the MLD\u2019s joint \nsecretaries, the director general of the Department of Local Infrastructure and Agricultural Roads \nand representatives of relevant line ministries, including the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction \nand  the  Ministry  of  Women;  development  partners;  and  local  body  associations.  The  joint \nsecretary of the Local Governance Coordination Division will be the national program director and \nact as member-secretary for the committee. The committee will meet at least twice a year. \n \n2. \nA  program  coordination  unit  (PCU)  has  been  established  under  the  Local  Governance \nCoordination Division of MLD and ensures the internal coordination of policy activities related to \nthe LGCDP through the policy coordination committee (PCC), which already exists in MLD. The \nLGCDP will be managed full-time by an under secretary from MLD, acting as program manager \nand heading the PCU on a daily basis, who will report to the national program director, who will \nreport in turn to the MLD secretary and the NAC. \n \nThe  PCU  will  have  dedicated  output  managers  for  each  of  the  seven  program  outputs, \n3. \nselected  from  among  the  various  section  chiefs  in  MLD  who  will  be  PCU  members.  This  will \nintroduce  a  degree  of  accountability  internally  in  MLD  in  terms  of  results-based  output \nmanagement  (see  Figure  A7).  PCU  output  managers  will  meet  monthly  to  discuss  issues \nregarding program implementation, and the PCU will prepare trimesterly progress reports. Once \nthe JFA is in place, the PCU will prepare annual work plans and budgets and present them to the \nNAC. The work plans and budgets will be linked to Government systems and based on the Local \nSelf-Governance  Act  (LSGA)  and  Local  Bodies  Financial  Administration  Regulations  (LBFAR). \nThe  PCU  will  be  responsible  for  drawing  up  procurement  plans  in  accordance  with  the  2007 \nProcurement Act and Regulations. \n \n4. \nThe PCU will include a technical cell made up of full-time national specialists in capacity \nbuilding,  financial  and  fiscal  decentralization,  social  mobilization,  gender  and  social  inclusion, \nprocurement,  information  and  communication  technology,  geographic  information  systems,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. These technical specialists will work under the daily supervision of the \nprogram  manager  and  provide  output  managers  with  technical  assistance  and  advice.  They  will \nact  as  resource  persons  to  the  working  committee  of  the  decentralization  implementation  and \nmonitoring  committee,  as  provided  for  under  the  LSGA.  Augmenting  the  full-time  national \ntechnical  specialists,  the  PCU  will  draw  on  international  expertise  as  necessary  to  provide \ntechnical core expertise to its staff. The PCU team will be housed in MLD premises. \n \n5. \nThe  PCU  will  include,  at  least  for  the  first  2  years  of  program  implementation,  two \nmanagement  specialists,  one  to  provide  MLD  with  support  for  procurement  according  to  the \nprovisions of the 2007 Procurement Act and related regulations, and the other to provide MLD\u2019s \nfinancial  management \nGeneral  Administration  Division  with  support \n(consolidated reports, withdrawal applications, etc.). \n \n\nfor  program-related \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n56 \n \n \nProgram management arrangements related to the work of local peace committees (LPCs) \n6. \nwill be handled by MPR. The Local Peace Mechanism Coordination Section in MPR will serve as \nthe program implementation unit (PIU), which will be headed by an undersecretary and have two \nsection  officers  to  provide  administrative  support.  The  PIU  will  be  supported  in  MPR  by  the \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation Division, and the MPR secretary will provide overall guidance \nto the LPC component of program work. Links between MPR and the LGCDP will be through NAC \nat the center and through the program implementation committees at the local body level. \n \n\nFigure A7: Implementation Structure for the National Program \n\nLPC \nSteering \nCommittee \n\nProgram \nManager, LPC \n\nPIU Head \n\nCentral \nLevel \n\nNACa \n\nPCC \n(at MLD)\n\nPCU \n(Headed by NPD) \n\nProgram \nManager\n\nSecretariat \n(including secretaries, \nsupport officials, \nadministrative assts, \nmessenger, and driver) \n\nTechnical Cell \n7 managers for outputs 1\u20137, \nsupported by 12 professional \nadvisors \n\nAll party mechanism \n \n PFCb \n\nAll party mechanism \n \n IPFC \n\nAll party mechanism \n \nPFCb \n\n \n\nLPCs in 75 \ndistricts \n\nPIC headed by EOs \n(coordinator) (Municip.

The local development officer \nwill  coordinate  the  LGCDP  in  districts,  the  executive  officer  in  municipalities,  and  secretaries  in \nvillage  development  committees  (VDCs).  The  program  will  be  integrated  into  the  local  bodies\u2019 \nplans, and district development committee (DDC), municipal, and VDC councils will approve their \nrespective program action plans. Finally, the integrated plan formulation committee of the DDCs \nwill  be  expanded  with  representatives  of  political  parties,  civil  society  organizations,  chairman\u2013 \nmanagement committees, and user committees to work as program implementation committees. \nLPCs will continue to rely on the Office of the Chief District Officer for support and work together \nwith that Office and DDCs. \n\n \n\nC. \n\nProgram Implementation Through Social Mobilization \n\n8. \nSocial mobilization is central to managing and implementing the LGCDP. It is a key part of \ncomponent 1 in the LGCDP and the principal means of empowering communities and community-\nbased organizations. Specific provisions in the LGCDP for this include that (i) DDCs will contract \nout  social  mobilization  services  to  appropriate  institutions  in  the  private  sector  and  civil  society, \netc.,  based  on  competitive  processes;  (ii)  a  comprehensive  social  mobilization  training  program \nand  operational  manual  will  be  designed,  and  all  service  providers  and  social  mobilizers  will  be \ntrained and provided with an operational manual toward ensuring a common approach; (iii) robust \noutcome-based monitoring of the performance of social mobilization service providers will be put \nin  place,  with  poor  performance  and  failure  to  achieve  the  outcomes  being  accompanied  by \nsanctions; (iv) new VDC and municipality wards will be selected on the bases of disadvantaged \ngroup  (DAG)  mapping  using  tools  already  developed  by  MLD;  (v)  DDCs  will  map  social \nmobilization  agencies\u2019  coverage  and  methodologies,  etc.,  and  assess  their  performance  and \npotential;  and  (vi)  VDCs  will  target  the  most  disadvantaged  and  poorest  families  by  using \nappropriate criteria. \n \n9. \nThe social mobilizers\u2019 primary functions will be to strengthen local voice and local groups\u2019 \nand communities\u2019 active participation in decision making on the use of block grants and ability to \nhold local bodies and service delivery agencies accountable. A community-led social development \napproach  will  strengthen  community  participation  in  local  governance.  The  program\u2019s  socially \nmobilized  groups  will  be  able  to  influence  the  use  of  block  grants  and,  in  many  cases,  be  the \nimplementing  body  in  the  production  of  goods  and  services  by  engaging  with  the  regular  local \nplanning and budgeting process.  \n \n10. \nSocial  mobilization  methods  will  ensure  social  inclusion  to  enable  citizens  from \ndisadvantaged  groups  to  participate  in  public  affairs  by  interacting  with  local  bodies,  public \nservices,  and  other  agencies.  Addressing  the  structural  causes  of  inequality  and  exclusion \nrequires both changes in the formal rules by which local bodies and service providers operate and \nthe more challenging transformation in people\u2019s attitudes and behavior. This may require targeted \nsocial mobilization, which the LGCDP recognizes. At the same time, the LGCDP will ensure that \nthis targeted social mobilization approach does not result in the exclusion or alienation of better-\noff or privileged members of the wider community, who may become resentful or obstructive. \n \n11. \nThis  social  mobilization  intervention  will  focus  on  the  wider  capacity  of  communities  and \ndisadvantaged groups to articulate their needs and priorities and exercise their rights in regard to \nlocal  administration.  This  will  be  undertaken  by  supporting  (i)  communities  with  resources  and \ntechnical support for funding their development priorities or pooling with others; (ii) communities\u2019 \nright to prioritize their needs and the methods by which to attain their developmental outcomes; (iii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n58 \n \n \ninnovative, \ninformation  and  awareness  campaigns  on \nunconventional approaches; (iv) the dissemination of local body plans, budgets, and expenditures, \netc.; (v) support to public and social audits and public hearings, etc.; (vi) training and support to \nthe  local  and  national  media  to  ensure  more  informed  and  active  reporting  of  local  governance \nissues; and (vii) support for surveys tracking public expenditure and the dissemination of findings. \nOnce the interim local bodies are established, a key activity will be training and guiding them in \nthe basics of responsible local governance and government\u2013community relations. \n\nlocal  governance \n\nissues,  using \n\n \n\n\fTable A7: Program Implementation Schedule \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n59\n\n2008 (month) \n\n2009 \n\n(July\u2013Dec)\n\n(qtrs)\n\n2010 \n\n(qtrs)\n\n2011 \n\n2012  \n\n(qtrs)\n\n(qtrs)\n\n \n\nComponent, Subcomponent, Activity\n\n1.

Accordingly, this assessment considers potential risks in \nsupporting a program in the particular sector and relevant mitigation measures.2  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nDiscussions  with  the  Government  of  Nepal  (the  Government),  development  partners, \nand  other  stakeholders  reveal  six  specific  vectors  of  risks  and  vulnerabilities  in  the  program.3 \nThere is agreement that, while there could be more risks, these constitute a particular challenge \nfor  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Local  Governance  and  Community  Development \nProgram (LGCDP). \n \nVector  1:  Legislative  and  Policy  Framework.  The  overarching  legal  framework  on \n3. \nlocal governance is the 1999 Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) and the Local Body Financial \nAdministration  Regulations,  1999.  The  LSGA  needs  to  be  amended  swiftly,  as  it  contravenes \nvarious other Acts. Another vulnerability in the legislative framework is the absence of a Local \n(Government)  Service  Act,  which  means  that  human  resource  management  for  local  bodies \ncontinues to be under the control of the center. \n \n4. \nVector  2:  Institutional  Dimensions.  Across  the  board,  the  capacity  of  the  various \ninstitutions that will be involved in the program is weak. This ranges from the central agencies \nsuch  as  the  MLD  to  the  midlevel  agencies,  including  public  sector  training  service  providers \nsuch  as  the  Local  Development  Training  Academy  and  more  local  entities  such  as  village \ndevelopment committees (VDCs). Not only does the physical infrastructure need repair, but the \nweak  technical  expertise  of  local  body  staff  members  and  the  frequent  transfer  of  field-based \nstaff  pose  vulnerabilities.  These  institutions  and  the  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD)  are \nalso under-resourced and unable to carry out their mandates effectively. That legal provisions in \nthe  Civil  Service  Act  with  respect  to  policies  and  rules  on  staff  transfers  are  not  adhered  to \nexacerbates these vulnerabilities. \n \n5. \nVector  3:  Government  Business  Processes. Two main vulnerabilities are (i) general \nweaknesses  in  specific  and  relevant  government  business  processes,  such  as  public \nprocurement,  and  the  consequent  vulnerability  to  corruption  and  mismanagement,  and  (ii) \nopaque business processes related to central\u2013local relations, such as uneasy and often unclear \nrelationships  among  line  agencies at  the  center,  their  field level  offices,  and  local bodies.  The \nProcurement Act has been gazetted, and relevant regulations prepared, to address the former \nvulnerability,  but  government  officials  with  experience  and  expertise  in  implementing  the  new \nprovisions,  especially  subnationally,  are  absent.  With  respect  to  the  latter  vulnerability,  there \ncontinue to be overlaps and inconsistencies in relationships, which have hindered effective local \nservice delivery. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II). Manila. \n2  Discussions  with  the  Government  on  this  risk  assessment  have  taken  place  during  the  fact-finding  and  appraisal \nmissions.  It  has  also  been  shared  with  development  partners  at  both  stages.  The  Government  has  engaged \nextensively with the mission on this assessment and has agreed on the need to continue to do so to better address \nthe risks (see Supplementary Appendix F for a detailed governance risk assessment). \n\n3  The sixth, on fiduciary risks, is discussed separately in Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n63\n\nVector  4:  Accountability  and  Transparency.  Disadvantaged  groups  are  not  able  to \n6. \nhold local bodies accountable for poor, ineffective service delivery. Some measures have been \ntaken  to  improve  the  transparency  of  local  body  operations  but  are  considered  inadequate. \nAnother serious risk is gaps in accountability and transparency regarding the use of resources. \nMismanagement  of  resources  and  the  broader  fiduciary  risks  of  intergovernmental  fiscal \ntransfers constitute particular risks that the program will have to deal with.4 \n \n7. \nVector  5:  Program-Related.  The political situation may jeopardize the sustainability of \nthe policy reforms. One risk could be rising fuel and food prices that will indirectly but certainly \naffect  fund  transfers  to  local  bodies,  particularly  at  a  time  of  strong  expectations  of  a  greater \nshare  of  such \nimplementation \narrangements  also  contain  some  weaknesses  such  as  unclear  protocols  for  reporting  from \nvillages  to  the  center.  An  under-appreciated  risk  is  the  management  of  expectations  with \nrespect  to  the  program.  There  are  currently  phenomenal  expectations  of  the  incoming \ngovernment, and not all of them are realistic. The risk is that failure to achieve even a fraction of \nexpectations may create a backlash against the reform process.  \n\nthe  center.  Program  management  and \n\ntransfers \n\nfrom \n\n \nRisk Severity \n\nB. \n \n8. \nAnalyzing the severity of risks is necessarily imprecise, though both the Government and \ndevelopment  partners  have  continually  engaged  in  this  exercise.  The  severity  of  the  risks \nidentified in the five vectors can be categorized under four types, with types 1 and 2 being the \nmost  severe  (see  Table  A9  and,  for  more  detail  and  description  of  the  methodology, \nSupplementary Appendix F). This review focuses only on selected type 1 and type 2 risks.  \n \n\nTable A9: Severity of Selected Risks \n\nType 1 \n\nTypes of Risk \n\nVector of \nRisks \n\nVector 1. \nLegislative and \npolicy framework \nVector 2. \nInstitutional \ndimensions \nVector 3. \nGovernment \nbusiness \nprocesses \nVector 4. \nAccountability and \ntransparency \nVector 5.

This is analyzed in detail in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nRisk Mitigation Measures \n\nMany  of  the  mitigation  measures  for  the  risks  listed  above  are  already  in  place. \n\nC. \n \n9. \nMitigation measures for selected type 1 risks can be detailed as follows. \n \n10.  Weaknesses in Institutions. This is inherently a type I risk, and the program will need \nto  ensure  that  adequate  resources  and  provisions  are  made  for  strengthening  institutions. \nDevelopment  partners  have  pledged  significant  resources  for  strengthening  local  bodies  and \nprocesses within MLD. Active engagement will need to continue with central and local agencies \nto ensure that resources are used judiciously and effectively. Close performance monitoring will \nbe necessary to help reduce the negative effects of implementation delays caused by capacity \nconstraints.  Assistance  should  also  be  provided  to  MLD  to  ensure  that  the  LSGA  is  amended \nswiftly and that the Local (Government) Service Act drafted promptly. Finally, closer compliance \nwith existing legal provisions, such as the Civil Service Act and its rules and policies, the Right \nto  Information  Act,  etc.,  will  strengthen  institutions.  Finally,  the  Government  will  need  to  be \nsupported  to  ensure  that  all  legal  provisions  (e.g.,  on  the  Civil  Service  Act,  etc.)  are  complied \nwith. \n \n11.  Marginalized  Populations  and  Voice.  This  is  a  critical  vulnerability.  The  program \nmakes  considerable  provisions  to  ensure  that  holistic  and  targeted  social  mobilization  will \nempower marginalized groups and that they will be supported financially to engage local bodies \nregarding ineffective service delivery. Local bodies themselves will be monitored to ensure that \nthey respond adequately to inputs from marginalized groups.  \n \nFiduciary  Risks. This is a general risk that exists in policy reform programs. It can be \n12. \nmitigated partly by ring-fencing specific levels of program funds for specific policy reform actions \nand  then  following  up  rigorously  during  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Two  such  ring-fencing \nmeasures  have  been  put  in  place,  one  for  local  peace  committees  and  the  other  for \nimplementing  the  social  and  environmental  safeguards  in  the  program.  Civil  society  and \nnongovernment  organizations  can  be  involved  in  monitoring  and  evaluation,  thereby  applying \nindependent pressure on the Government to ensure that resources are spent as planned. In the \nLGCDP,  this  is  proposed  through  a  Local  Governance  and  Accountability  Facility.  The \nGovernment  has  initiated  a  system  of  flow  of  funds  to  local  bodies  that  minimizes  the  role  of \nMLD  for  a  more  direct  fund-flow  mechanism.  Finally,  there  is  now  greater  attention  paid  to \ntransparency in this fund flow.5 \n \nD. \n \n13. \nThis assessment puts forth a few risk-mitigating measures that have been incorporated \ninto  the  LGCDP.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThere is a clear link between the Governance Support Program (GSP) and the Government\u2019s national poverty \nreduction  strategy,  as  contained  in  the  Three-Year  Interim  Plan  (TYIP)  (2008\u20132010)  and  the  Nepal  country \npartnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).a The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is, \nin  the  first  instance  and  for  the  short  term,  geared  toward  ensuring  a  smooth  transition  to  a  modern, \ndemocratic,  and  federal  state.  The  TYIP  reaffirms  that  for  this  to  happen  local  governance  needs  to  be \nrestructured,  peace  efforts  should  be  solidified  locally,  and  the  problem  of  low  institutional  capacity  in  local \nbodies needs to be addressed. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nTwo key issues that contextualize the poverty aspects of local governance are the following: \n(i) \n\nVoice Mechanism. The contribution of strong local governance to poverty reduction is well documented. \nGood governance creates an institutional environment characterized by the principles of accountability, \ntransparency,  predictability,  and  participation.  This  gives  the  poor  a  say  in  decision  making  in  local \nbodies  and  in  how  services  are  delivered.  This  voice  mechanism  ensures  that  local  bodies  become \nmore responsive, which is an important link between good local governance and poverty reduction.  \nCapacity Building. One key component of effective service delivery by local bodies is their capacity to \ndo  so.  As  managerial  and  executive  leadership  in  local  bodies  is  deputed  from  the  center,  local \nexpertise  is  not  developed.  This  needs  to  be  adequately  dealt  with  in  any  program  that  seeks  to \nenhance effective and inclusive service delivery through accountable local bodies. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n2. Design Features \n \nSubprogram 1  (SP1)  of  the  GSP  (i)  supports  the  Government  as  it  prepares,  for  the  first  time,  a  sector-wide \napproach to local development programming; (ii) employs the minimum conditions and performance measures \n(MCPM)  tool  to  reward  good  performance  by  local  bodies  (Appendix  4);  (iii)    supports  more  effective  local \ngovernance  through  midlevel  organizations;  (iv)  adheres  to  the  harmonized  approach  to  community-led  local \ndevelopment agreed to by all development partners in early 2008; and (v) is wholly aligned with the outcomes \nand new initiatives of the Government in the areas of local governance and community development.  \n \nIn  addition,  the  Local  Governance  and  Community  Development  Program  (LGCDP)  component  on \nstrengthening the national framework includes several important features that further the Government\u2019s intent \nto  adhere  to  the  provisions  in  the  Interim  Constitution  related  to  devolution,  state  restructuring,  and \ninclusiveness.  A  pro-poor  feature  of  SP1  is  the  attention  paid  to  inclusive  service  delivery,  which  will  ensure \nthat historically disadvantaged groups and other segments of society have a say in local governance, including \nholding service providers accountable.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nC.

The conceptual basis of (ii) is grounded on the positive impact of good local governance on growth. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n67\n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nKey Issues \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \n \n \nThe  key  socioeconomic  issues  that  are  evident  in  SP1  deal  with  the  impact  of  mismanagement  of  public \nresources by local bodies that harms local people, largely through poor service delivery and greater costs for \naccessing services. This further marginalizes disadvantaged groups and perpetuates mistrust in government. \nWhile  mismanagement  and  poor  service  delivery  by  local  bodies  cannot  be  completely  done  away  with, \nparticularly  in  the  time  period  specified  in  the  LGCDP,  SP1\u2013in  line  with  the  LGCDP\u2013attempts  to  improve  the \ncapability of local bodies to be more in tune with popular demands and make them more accountable to service \nusers.  This  is  expected  to  have  positive  economic  and  social  effects,  including  greater  public  trust  in \ngovernment. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n \nStakeholder groups engaged in the formulation process of SP1 and the LGCDP include central policy makers, \nmidlevel  actors,  and  local  officials  and  civil  society  groups.b  The  questions  discussed  in  the  consultations \nincluded the following: (i) What outcomes should a program on strengthening local governance and community \ndevelopment  focus  on?  (ii)  How  should  the  program  be  structured  so  that  it  is  aligned  with,  and  contributes \nsubstantially to, the Government\u2019s vision? (ii) How can development partners be coordinated? (iii) What is the \nbest way to mainstream successful initiatives such as in social mobilization and come up with new ones? (iv) \nHow  can  commitment  from  top  political  and  bureaucratic  leaders,  and  ownership  by  local  communities,  be \nsecured? \n \nMoving  forward,  the  consultation  and  participation  processes  will  involve  ensuring  that  SP1,  through  the \nnational advisory committee at MLD, is substantially engaged with the Government to ensure alignment with its \nstated outcomes and vision. \n \nWhat level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaboration     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \nWas a consultation and participation plan prepared? \n \n\n Yes   \n\n Noc   \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\nKey Issues \n\n \nC.   Gender and Development \n \n \nEmpirical evidence shows that women suffer more than men when governments are unable to provide services \neffectively  because  of  the  inherent  biases  in  the  system  that  inhibit  their  proper  access  to  services.  This \nsituation  is  aggravated  for  women  of  disadvantaged  groups.  By  addressing  the  problem  of  weak  service \ndelivery  with  more  attention  on  inclusiveness,  as  required  in  the  LGCDP,  and  by  empowering  communities. \nSP1 will have indirectly maximized impacts on women.d \n \n \n \nMeasures  included  in  the  design  to  promote  equality  between  men\u2019s  and  women\u2019s  access  to  and  use  of \nrelevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities: \n \n\nKey Actions \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \nSpecific measures are needed to ensure that gender issues in service delivery are effectively considered. The \npolicy changes in the area of social inclusiveness are expected to have an impact across the full range of local \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n \nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\n \nLabor \n\n \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor   \n\n     retrenchment \n Core labor  \n\n     standards \n \n \n\nAffordability \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \n Human \nTrafficking \nOthers  \n\n \n\ngovernance and service delivery issues, of which gender is one (see Appendix 11 for an action plan to ensure \ngender  equality  and  social  inclusion  in  the  program).  One  of  the  key  actions  in  this  regard  is  strengthening \ngender equality and social inclusion (GESI) capability in MLD, which is executing the LGCDP. Other relevant \nprovisions of GESI have also been built into the LGCDP as outputs and activities. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\n \nStrategy to Address \nIssue \n\nPlan/Measures Included in \nDesign \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThere are no specific involuntary \nresettlement issues inherent in \nthe program e \n\n \nThere are no \u00e0 priori specific \nissues in the program that relate \nto indigenous people e \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \nIssues of employment \nopportunities for disadvantaged \ngroups may arise as a result of \nmore effective service delivery. \nThere could be some small civil \nworks in the program as a result \nof investment decisions of local \nbodies. As the issue of local \ngovernment service may be \naddressed, any legislation \nrelating to this will need to be \nclear about how personnel \nactions are to be made more \nmerit based and unbiased. \n \nThe problem of affordability will \narise if local bodies decide to \nraise the cost of accessing \nservices as part of the drive to \nmeet costs from own revenues \nor provide services at cost. \nGovernment has encouraged \nown-revenue collection by local \nbodies; special attention has to \nbe paid to this issue. \n\n \nThere is a possibility that the \ndirect benefits of the program \nmay not be evident in the short \nterm as policy reforms related to \nservice delivery take some time \nto be embedded. Lack of \ncapacity in MLD and local \nbodies is a potential risk of \nprogram implementation. A \nbroader risk as it relates to \nwomen and disadvantaged \ngroups is the management of \n\n \n \nTo the extent that it is \nnecessary and possible, \nlocal bodies and the \nExecuting Agency will \nensure that women and \nmen are given equal \nopportunity for \nemployment, and that \ncontractors for \nrehabilitation will be made \nto consider equal payment \nfor equal work. \n \n \n\nThis can be precluded by \nensuring that local bodies \nhave access to adequate \nresources to pay for cost \nincreases in service \ndelivery. One strategy \nwould be to set aside \ndedicated funding for \nservices likely to be more \nin demand by women and \ndisadvantaged groups. \n \n \nEnsure that \ndisadvantaged groups \nhave a voice. Use the \ntechnical assistance \ncurrently provided to MLD \nand others by various \ndevelopment partners to \ndevelop capacity. Pooling \ntechnical assistance \nresources may also be \nmore effective.

Start off with \nachievable and visible \ntargets for quick results. \n\n \n \nIV.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n69\n\n \nSocial indicators have been included in the design and monitoring framework (see Appendix 1) to facilitate the \nmonitoring  of  activities  or  social  impacts  during  program  implementation.  These  include  (i)  measures  of \nsatisfaction  regarding  public  access  to  local  services;  (ii)  public  perceptions,  particularly  of  women  and \ndisadvantaged groups, of good local governance; and (iii) citizens\u2019 report cards and reports of public and social \naudits. Reviews and evaluation of the program, including a midterm one, will be conducted, in some instances \nby independent nongovernment organizations so that a more unbiased view is formed of program outcomes. \nEfforts will be made to include representatives of women and disadvantaged groups in program review teams. \n \nAre  social  indicators  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  to  facilitate  monitoring  of  social \n  No       \ndevelopment activities and/or social impacts during project implementation?                   \nIGA = income-generating activities, MLD = Ministry of Local Development, PPP = public-private partnership. \na  ADB.  2005.

It  is  expected  to  detail  how  effective  coverage \nwill  be  ensured across the country and  how  stakeholders as diverse as disadvantaged groups and  central  policy \nmakers  will  be  consulted  in  the  implementation  of  the  program.  This  is  expected  to  be  ready  by  the  end  of  the \ninception phase of the LGCDP at end-2008. \n\nd  See Appendix 11 for further discussion on key issues surrounding gender related to this program. \ne  However,  to  account  for  the  possibility  that  the  investment  decisions  of  local  bodies  may  have  impact,  the \n\nsafeguard frameworks (see Appendix 12) detail the strategies and actions to address this issue. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nSUMMARY GENDER EQUALITY AND SOCIAL INCLUSION ACTION PLAN \n\nIntroduction \n\nto  have  differential \n\nKey Principles and Approaches \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  premise  of  the  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI)  action  plan  is  that \n1. \nsubprogram  1  (SP1)  of  the  Governance  Support  Program,  which  helps  the  Government  of \nNepal  (the  Government)  to  implement  its  Local  Governance  and  Community  Development \nProgram  (LGCDP),  has  strong  potential \nimpact  on  women  and \ndisadvantaged groups (DAGs). While the LGCDP has a dedicated component to strengthening \ncommunity mobilization, it does not necessarily follow that this alone will adequately address the \ndemands and needs of the women and DAGs. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe key principles and approaches of the LGCDP that support including GESI concerns \nare  (i)  affirmative  action  policies  in  favor  of  the  poor,  women,  and  DAGs  to  maximize  their \nparticipation in and benefit from the program; (ii) capacity building in leadership and managerial \nskills  for  women  and  DAGs  (including  Dalits,  Janajatis,  and  others)  to  empower  them;  (iii)  the \nharmonization  of  procedures  for  working  with  communities  and  for  targeting  the  poorest  and \nmost  disadvantaged  segments  of  these  communities;  (iv)  a  rights-based  approach  based  on \nparticipatory  planning  and  the  development  of  demand-responsive  local  service  providers \nthrough social mobilization and advocacy for civil rights; and (v) special targeted programs and \nmechanisms to ensure that DAGs are covered by the program and that their voices are heard \nthrough participation, empowerment, and access to resources and capacity building. \n \n3. \n(MLD)  will  prepare  GESI  strategy  and \nimplementation guidelines for the LGCDP in the inception phase, by January 2009. This GESI \naction plan of SP1 will support incorporating GESI issues in the comprehensive strategy. It lays \nout some specific actions to ensure the inclusion of issues relevant to women and DAGs in all \nthree  program  components.  It  highlights  implementation  arrangements  for  the  plan  and \nprovisions for appropriate monitoring and evaluation (M&E) related to GESI. \n \nC. \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Local  Development \n\nProgram Design \n\n4. \nComponent  1  of  the  LGCDP  specifically  targets  GESI  inclusion,  resulting  from \ninteractions among numerous stakeholders.

\n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n5. \nImplementation arrangements in the LGCDP specifically to incorporate GESI provisions \ninclude  the  (i)  inclusion  of  gender  and  development  specialists  in  the  teams  designing  the \nLGCDP  and  developing  its  relevant  strategies;  (ii)  provision  of  a  GESI  specialist  in  program \ncoordination  unit  (PCU)  for  program  duration;  (iii)  provision  of  GESI  specialists  and  related \nofficers in the PCU for specific technical inputs (e.g., gender budgeting), intermittently based on \nneed;  (iv)  provision  of  gender  focal  points  in  all  local  bodies;  and  (v)  inclusion  of  GESI \nspecialists  in  all  review  teams.  The  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social  Welfare  and \nDepartment of Women Development (DWD) will be key partners, along with gender focal points \nin each line agency, in ensuring that gender considerations are taken on board by the program. \nThe  Women  Development  Office  will  be  a  key  local  partner,  with  coordination  support  from \nDWD.  Women\u2019s  and  DAGs\u2019  community-based  and  nongovernment  organizations  will  be \nidentified  to  ensure  their  concerns  are  reflected  in  the  implementation  of  the  program.  The \nWomen\u2019s  Development  Training  Center  and  Local  Development  Training  Academy  will  play \nroles in providing training to local women.  \n \n6. \nBudget  and  Capacity  Building  Provision.  While  the  action  plan  does  not  require  a \nseparate budget, as it is integrated into the overall program cost, the LGCDP makes particular \nprovisions to ensure that capacity-building opportunities for women and disadvantaged groups \nare facilitated. Budgeting provisions have been incorporated in the LGCDP to ensure this.1  \n \n7. \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation. The LGCDP makes several provisions related to M&E: (i) \nProvisions are made to incorporate GESI indicators in M&E systems such that implementation \narrangements can be continually strengthened depending upon the review results based on the \ngender-sensitive  M&E  system.  (ii)  Reporting  requirements  will  be  strengthened  in  the  LGCDP \nsuch  that  specific  indicators  of  program  impact  can  be  tracked  as  they  relate  to  women  and \ndisadvantaged  groups.  (iii)  DAG  mapping  will  ensure  that  more  specific  monitoring  provisions \ncan  be  built  in  for  areas  with  a  category  4  (most  disadvantaged)  rating.2 (iv)  Finally,  provision \nhas been made for women\u2019s and disadvantaged groups to be part of program review. The M&E \nof  the  action  plan  will  be  incorporated  into  the  overall  M&E  plan  developed  for  all  the  project \ncomponents. This is to be done in the PCU, which has provision for a GESI specialist and an \nM&E specialist. A midterm evaluation and regular reviews will provide scope for realigning the \nprogram  focus  so  that  attention  to  gender  and  DAG  issues  continues  to  enjoy  emphasis.  The \nnational  advisory  committee  and  the  PCU  in  MLD  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  and \ncoordinating M&E activities.  \n \nD. \n\nConclusion \n\n8. \nIssues of gender equity and social inclusion have been given central importance in the \nLGCDP, and this has been conveyed to the implementing agencies down to the local level. The \naction  plan  on  GESI  will  be  updated  regularly  to  ensure  that  any  central  policy  directions  are \ntranslated into local practice. In that regard, all output managers in the PCU and members of the \nnational  advisory  committee  will  be  made  familiar  with  this  action  plan  and  its  implications  for \ntheir own work. \n\n                                                 \n1  Separately,  the  Local  Development  Training  Academy  will  strengthened  (out  of  the  purview  of  the  LGCDP  but  in \nalignment with it) to train female social mobilizers that will, in the short term, be involved in local social mobilization \nand, in the medium term, be the core of a cadre of local body staff that will serve in the districts. This is a unique \nprovision that the Government has been very supportive of. \n\n2  DAG mapping will be used to ensure that gender-disaggregated data in the baseline surveys are used to assess \n\nthe gender-differentiated impact of the program. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n73\n\nSUMMARY SAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK \n\nWhile local bodies are entitled to make investment decisions for subprojects in the Local \n1. \nGovernance and Community Development Program (LGCDP), prior to making any investments \nthey  will  be  required  to  ensure  compliance  with  safeguards  against  possible  adverse  socio-\nenvironmental, indigenous people, or involuntary resettlement impacts.1 \n \nB. \nProgram Policy Matrix \n\nSocial  and  Environmental  Safeguards  Framework  (SESF)  Implications  of  the \n\nWhile  there  are  no  direct  SESF  implications  from  many  of  the  program  policy  matrix \n\n2. \nconditions, the points in Table A12 need to be made about the few that do. \n \n\nTable A12: Implications of the Program Policy Matrix \n(selected actions) \n\nTranche \n1 \n\nPolicy Action \n\nMLD to issue public and social audit \nguidelines for local bodies in the delivery \nof services and ensuring transparency in \nlocal governance \nMLD to approve an SESF for use by local \nbodies \n\n2 \n\nMLD to approve a GESI strategy, \nincluding detailed implementation \narrangements with budget allocation  \n\nNAC to approve an action plan on how to \nimprove MLD\u2019s capacity to coordinate \nprograms on local governance and \ncommunity development \n\nSESF Implications \n\nNo direct implications, as the audits will reveal \ninformation that is relevant to costs of relevant impacts of \nsubprojects. \n\nInvestment decisions resulting from the grants could \nimpact the environment, indigenous peoples, and \ninvoluntary resettlement, so plans need to be prepared. \nPart of the GESI strategy will deal with mobilizing \nindigenous peoples and, in light of the focus on \nassessing the impact of any subprojects on them, the \nstrategy should be mindful of how to manage this impact. \nPart of this capacity development has to with ensuring \nthat the Environment Management Section of MLD has \ndeveloped capacity to help local bodies in implementing \nthe SESF and overseeing its implementation. \n\nSafeguards on Environmental Impacts \n\nGESI  =  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion,  MLD  =  Ministry  of  Local  Development,  NAC  =  national  advisory \ncommittee, SESF = social and environmental safeguards framework. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nAll  investments  are  subject  to  categorization  using  the  project  classification  system  of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  as  well  as  the  Government\u2019s  requirements  under  the \nEnvironmental Protection Act and its regulations.2 The decision as to which classification system \nholds  is  straightforward:  the  stricter  rule  applies  (i.e.,  if  ADB\u2019s  project  classification  system \nrecommends a higher level of environmental assessment compared with that resulting from  the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Regulations  (EPR)  screening,  ADB\u2019s  requirement  applies;  on  the \nother hand, if the EPR screening of the subproject gives a stricter requirement compared with \nADB\u2019s, the former applies). \n\n                                                 \n1  Detailed documentation on the safeguards framework, including all applicable checklists that have been finalized, \nwill be included in the program administration manual after approval of the program. The safeguards document will \nbe used by local bodies as they make investment decisions on usage of the grant funds. \n\n2  Category  A  subprojects  are  those  with  potential  for  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts,  for  which  an \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  needed.  Category  B  subprojects  are  judged  to  have  some  adverse \nenvironmental impacts but of lesser degree and/or significance than those of category A subprojects, and for which \nan  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  is  needed.  Category  C  subprojects  are  unlikely  to  have  adverse \nenvironmental impacts, and no EIA or IEE is needed, but environmental implications are still reviewed. \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSafeguards on Impacts on Indigenous People \n\n \n4. \nInformation  Disclosure.  The  summary  initial  environmental  evaluation  (IEE)  and \nsummary  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  reports  must  be  circulated  widely  to  the \ngeneral public. The full IEE or EIA reports are also to be made available to interested parties on \nrequest.  Finally,  the  summary  EIA  or  summary  IEE  for  category  B  subprojects  deemed \nenvironmentally sensitive must be made available to the general public at least 120 days before \nthe subproject is to be submitted for final approval by the local body.  \n \nResponsibilities  and  Authorities. The Environment Management Section of MLD will \n5. \nensure smooth communications in district development committees and other stakeholders and \nwill have overall responsibility for ensuring environmental assessments throughout all program \nphases.  The  Ministry  of  Science,  Environment,  and  Technology  will  be  responsible  for  issuing \nnecessary environmental permits or consents for category A subprojects when all conditions are \nmet. ADB will (i) review and clear environmental assessment reports for category A subprojects \nand  category  B  subprojects  deemed  sensitive  and  (ii)  conduct  review  missions  to  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  any \nsubprogram proposal or its EIA or IEE.  \n \nD. \n \nInitial screening of subproject impacts on indigenous peoples will be done to categorize \n6. \nthe  impacts  and  identify  subsequent  approaches  and  resource  requirements  to  address \nindigenous issues. A thorough screening will be conducted as part of a subproject\u2019s feasibility \nstudy.  Relevant  staff  in  local  bodies  or  external  contracted  parties,  such  as  nongovernment \norganizations,  will  be  required  to  identify  communities  belonging  to  the  various  indigenous \ngroups  and  their  characteristics  as  compared  with  the  main  population  in  the  subproject \ninfluence  zone.  The  subprojects  will  be  categorized  as  (i)  category  A,  expected  to  have \nsignificant  impacts  that  require  an  indigenous  peoples  development  program;  (ii)  category  B, \nexpected  to  have  limited  impacts  that  require  specific  action  for  indigenous  peoples  in \nresettlement plans and/or social action plans; and (iii) category C, not expected to have impacts \non indigenous peoples and therefore not requiring special provision for them.  \n \nE. \n \n7. \nAs most local people will voluntarily donate part of their land for building community and \nrural roads and small-scale rural infrastructure that directly benefit the community, subprojects \nunder the LGCDP are likely to continue, to some extent, the tradition of land donation. However, \nadequate processes and safeguards will be built into the resettlement plan to ensure that land \ndonation  is  truly  voluntary  and  does  not  impoverish  affected  people.  Full  consultation  with \naffected people will occur at site selection and design. \n \n8. \n As  a  first  principle,  affected  people  will  be  informed  of  their  right  to  compensation  for \nany  loss  of  property  caused  by  subproject  construction.  Affected  people  will  have  the  right  to \nrefuse  land  donation.  Any  voluntary  land  donation  will  be  confirmed  through  a  written  record, \nincluding  a  \"no  coercion\"  clause  verified  by  an  independent  third  party.  The  donation  will  be \nlimited to land and minor assets, with houses and major assets excluded. A grievance redress \ncommittee with representation of affected people will be set up, and affected people who are not \nsatisfied with the land donation can file a complaint with it.  \n \n \n \n \n\nSafeguards on Involuntary Resettlement \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n75\n\nDedicated Resources for Capacity in Applying Safeguards \n\nF. \n \n9. \nAs  local  bodies,  particularly  VDCs,  do  not  generally  have  capacity  to  conduct \nassessments  on  their  own,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  earmark  $1.8  million  during  the \nprogram period specifically to (i) provide to local bodies technical assistance toward having the \nassessments  provided  by  a  third  party  to  deal  with  short-term  capability  gaps  and  (ii)  develop \nand finance a capacity-building plan whereby officials of the district technical office and others \nwill be trained in the relevant skills to fill the long-term gaps.
