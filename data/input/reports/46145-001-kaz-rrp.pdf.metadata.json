In  parallel  with  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  financing,  the  European  Bank  of  Reconstruction  and  Development \n(EBRD) will fund the rehabilitation of the remaining 62 km of the Shymkent\u2013Tashkent road and \nprovide institutional development assistance.  \n\n3. \nThe  rationale  for  the  project  emanates  from  (i)  economic  and  social  performance  in \nsouth  Kazakhstan,  which  is  below  the  country\u2019s  average;  (ii)  the  regional  significance  of  the \nproject road at the junction of two CAREC corridors; and (iii) the dilapidated physical condition \nof the project road, which impedes transport, efforts to diversify South Kazakhstan\u2019s economy, \nand regional integration. \n\n4. \nSince  2009,  Kazakhstan  has  experienced  strong  economic  growth  driven  mainly  by  a \nsubstantial  increase in oil  production,  prevailing  high commodity  prices, and an  influx  of  direct \nforeign  investment.  However,  the  positive  macroeconomic  development  has  masked  growing \ndisparities  across  regions.  South  Kazakhstan  is  among  the  provinces  that  have  not  benefited \nproportionately from the favorable macroeconomic development (para. 20). It has limited good \nroads  and  inadequate  public  transport  services.  As  a  result,  a  majority  of  local  people  have \ndifficulty in reaching the administrative centers of the province, markets, and social services. \n\n5. \nThe  government  of  Kazakhstan  has  adopted  the  2020  Strategy  for  Economic \nDevelopment and the State Program on Accelerated Industrial-Innovative Development (SPAID) \nto diversify the economy and promote balanced regional development.3 To this end, Shymkent, \nSouth  Kazakhstan\u2019s  capital,  with  a  population  of  about  0.6  million  in  2011,  is  designated  a \nnational  growth  center.  To  support  the  2020  Strategy  for  Economic  Development  and  the \nSPAID,  the  government  has  reformulated  and  expanded  its  road  development  plan  into  the \nTransport Sector Program (TSP) for 2010\u20132014.4 The TSP aims to develop a transport system \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the ADB-financed portion of the project is in Appendix 1.  ADB provided \nproject  preparatory  small-scale  technical  assistance  to  conduct  due  diligence  and  prepare  the  project.  Unless \notherwise specified, the \u201cproject\u201d used in this report and recommendation of the president refers to the project to be \nfinanced by ADB. \n\n2  The  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  and  its  Implementation  Action  Plan  identify  six  CAREC \ncorridors. The CAREC Ministerial Conference endorsed the Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy in 2007 and \nthe Implementation Action Plan  in 2008. Corridor 3 links the  Russian Federation with the Middle East and South \nAsia, connecting Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n\n3  http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2437463. \n4  Government of Kazakhstan. 2010.

Astana \n(approved in July). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nthat  is  integrated  into  the  international  transport  network.  Improving  the  Shymkent\u2013Tashkent \nroad  will  complement  the  government\u2019s  regional  development  activities  and  contribute  to \nachieving  the  objectives  of  the  SPAID  and  TSP  in  Kazakhstan.  The  project  also  aligns  with \nADB's  Strategy  2020 5  and  its  Country  Partnership  Strategy  2012\u20132016,  which  identifies \ntransport infrastructure as a core area of ADB operations.6 \n \n6. \nKazakhstan\u2019s geographic location and economic structure make the country\u2019s economy \nhighly  freight  intensive,  affecting  its  trade  competitiveness.  Kazakhstan  has  an  approximately \n93,600  km  road  network,  which  includes  23,495  km  of  republican  (national  and  international) \nroads; the remainder is rural and urban roads. Road freight traffic has increased in recent years. \nRoads  accounted  for  25%  of  the  country\u2019s  freight  traffic  by  ton-km  and  85%  of  its  passenger \ntraffic by passenger-km in 2009. These shares are likely to continue to grow. However, a major \nshare  of  the  republican  road  network  is  in  a  poor  state  of  repair  with  about  50%  requiring \nrehabilitation.  Cross-border  impediments,  coupled  with  deteriorated  road  infrastructure,  are \nimpeding trade flows.  \n\nThe government\u2019s strategic goals in the transport sector are to establish an efficient and \n7. \nsustainable  transport  system  in  Kazakhstan  through  policy  reforms,  sector  restructuring,  and \ninfrastructure development. The government has made policy changes to improve cost recovery, \nincrease competition, strengthen management of  operations and maintenance, and encourage \npublic\u2013private partnerships. The government has also made significant investments on transport \ninfrastructure  through  external  borrowing  and  budgetary  allocation.  The  safeguard  policies  of \nboth  ADB  and  Kazakhstan  are  being  adhered  to  ensure  that  (i)  negative  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are minimized, and (ii) adverse impacts are adequately mitigated. \n\n8. \nIn line with ADB\u2019s country strategy for Kazakhstan and the government\u2019s transport sector \nstrategy,  ADB  operations  in  the  transport  sector  support  policy  reforms,  sector  restructuring, \ninfrastructure improvement, and capacity development. ADB\u2019s experience in the transport sector \nhas  been  positive,  with  all  ongoing  ADB-assisted  road  projects  expected  to  be  completed  on \ntime. The key lessons learned from ADB\u2019s past experience include the needs of (i) close project \nsupervision  to  ensure  smooth  implementation,  (ii)  enhanced  monitoring  of  environmental  and \nsocial  safeguards  compliance,  and  (iii)  continued  support  for  capacity  development  for  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies. These lessons have been incorporated in the design of \nthe project. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  closer  regional  cooperation  and  increased  trade  along \nCAREC 3. The outcome will be an efficient transport network in the South Kazakhstan section \nof CAREC Corridor 3. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nfrom Shymkent toward Tashkent. \n\nThe output of the project will be a 37 km (km 705 to km 742) rehabilitated road section \n\nOutput \n\n                                                \n5  ADB.  2008.

The  loan  will  have  a  20-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  4  years,  repayment  by  straight-line  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \nlending  facility,  \na commitment charge of 0.15% per year,8 and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.25 years; and no maturity \npremium  is  payable  to  ADB.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n\ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nThe Project [Shymkent\u2013Tashkent Section (km 705 to km 742)] \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Kazakhstan \n     Subtotal \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n\nShare \n(%) \n\n \n125.0 \n22.0 \n147.0 \n\n85.0 \n15.0 \n100.0 \n\nEBRD Financed Project [Shymkent\u2013Tashkent Section (km 742 to km 804)] \n\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nGovernment of Kazakhstan \n     Subtotal  \n\n \n \n \n \nSources:  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications,  Government  of  Kazakhstan;  and  the  Asian  Development \nBank estimates. \n                                                \n7  Through  a  letter  to  ADB  in  April  2012,  EBRD  stated  its  intent  to  provide  parallel  financing  and  collaborate  on \n\n196.5 \n27.7 \n224.2 \n371.2 \n\nTotal \n\n8  Interest  and  other  charges  during  construction  will  not  be  capitalized  in  the  loan  and  will  be  financed  by  the \n\nimplementation arrangements. \n\ngovernment from its own resources. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n13. \nThe  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  will  be  the  executing  agency. \nThe  South  Kazakhstan  Committee  of  Roads  (COR)  under  MOTC  will  be  the  implementing \nagency  with  direct  responsibility  for  overall  project  implementation.

The climate of the province is marked \nby  cold  winters  with  heavy  snowfall,  hot  summers  with  temperatures  rising  to  45\u00b0C,  and  an \naverage annual rainfall of 951 millimeters. The project road was built around 1970 and was not \ndesigned for the traffic loads that the road has carried over the last two decades. The advent of \n                                                \n9  The PMU is composed of technical, financial management, and administration staff. \n10 The  civil  works  under  the  EBRD-financed  project  will  be  supervised  by  a  separately  recruited  construction \n\n11 A  consultant  engaged  under  the  ADB-financed  project preparatory  technical assistance  will  provide  procurement \n\nsupervision consultant.  \n\nsupport. \n\n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fheavy  trucks,  not  common  at  the  time  the  road  was  designed,  has  been  damaging  to  the \nstructure  of  the  pavement.  The  road  has  not  undergone  major  rehabilitation  or  reconstruction \nworks. As a result, about 70% of the pavement is in a less-than-satisfactory condition with major \nstructural  problems,  such  as  cracking,  raveling,  and  potholes  indicating  the  urgent  need  for \nreconstruction. \n \n15. \nA  4-lane  project  road  will  accommodate  the  projected  traffic  volume.  The  designed \nformation width of the road is 27.5 meters. The proposed pavement design is cement-concrete, \nwhich  requires  a  much  smaller  operation  and  maintenance  budget  compared  with  asphalt \npavement. Concrete pavement also provides better rider quality, which saves fuel cost for road \nusers.  In  addition,  concrete  roads  are  safer  as  night  time  visibility  is  greater  and  require  less \nstreet  lighting.  The  government  plans  to  install  weighbridges  under  the  project,  which  will \nenhance  control  of  vehicle  overloading  and  thus  will  serve  as  preventive  maintenance.  ADB \nconducted due diligence on the design and suggested improving the design of U turns to ensure \nsafe and smooth traffic flow. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n16. \nThe project will contribute to achieving the envisaged benefits of the improved transport \ncorridor:  lower  transport  costs,  shorter  travel  time,  and  improved  road  safety  standards.  \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  undertaken  using  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects 13  and  following  the  analytical  framework  of  the  highway \ndevelopment  and  management  model. 14  The  traffic  forecast  is  based  on  traffic  counts \nconducted on the project road in early 2012. Using the 2012 average daily traffic volume, annual \nnormal traffic growth is forecast at 3% for 2016\u20132035. Generated traffic, estimated at about 20% \nof normal traffic, is included in the analysis. Project costs and benefits are calculated based on a \ncomparison of with- and without-project scenarios. The economic costs are (i) capital, including \nphysical  contingencies  but  excluding  taxes;  and  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance,  including \nreplacement  of  depreciated  equipment.  The  economic  benefits  are  (i)  savings  in  vehicle \noperating costs resulting from the improved project road, and (ii) time savings. The results of the \neconomic  analysis  show  that  the  project  is  economically  feasible  with  an  estimated  economic \ninternal rate of return of 15.9%. Sensitivity tests confirm that the project would remain feasible \nshould the envisaged project costs increase or benefits be reduced. No financial analysis  was \nundertaken because the project road will not generate revenues. \n\n17. \nThe fiscal impact of the project road is considered insignificant given the relatively short \nlength  of  the  project  road  and  the  projected  robust  fiscal  position  of  the  government  in  the \nforeseeable  future.  In  addition,  the  government  has  consistently  increased  the  budgetary \nallocations  for  road  maintenance  so  that  the  service  quality  of  the  entire  road  network  has \nimproved.  Moreover,  the  proposed  cement  concrete  pavement  for  the  project  road  will  reduce \nmaintenance cost. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \n18. \ndiscussed  with, \nthe  government  and  MOTC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM.

While poverty rates have declined in the country, the decrease of poverty rates \ncross regions varies. South Kazakhstan is among the country\u2019s poorer provinces with a poverty \nrate  of  11.5%  in  2011,  which  is  the  second  highest  in  the  country  and  significantly  above  the \nnational average of 6.5%.16 South Kazakhstan is dominated by agriculture. The main economic \nactivities  in  the  project  area  are  agriculture,  specifically  livestock  and  poultry.  The  project  is \nexpected to contribute to poverty reduction in the province by increasing the transport of goods \nand  improving  people\u2019s  access  to  services  and  markets.  The  project  will  also  benefit  local \nresidents and enterprises by creating jobs during construction and cutting transport costs. Social \nand  poverty  assessments  were  conducted  and  are included  in the  summary  poverty  reduction \nand  social  strategy.17 The  project  is classified  as a  general  intervention, with no  direct  poverty \nreduction component. However, it will benefit poor people in the project area by improving their \naccess to markets and social services. \n \n21. \nThe  civil  works  contract  will  require  that  contractors  (i)  comply  with  Kazakhstan\u2019s \napplicable labor laws; (ii) not differentiate payment between men and women for work of equal \nvalue;  (iii)  not  employ  child  labor  in  construction  and  maintenance  activities;  (iv)  to  the  extent \npossible,  maximize  employment  of  local  poor  and  disadvantaged  residents  for  project \nconstruction,  provided  that  the  requirements  for  job  and  efficiency  are  adequately  met;  and  \n(v)  encourage  employment  of  women  laborers.  In  addition,  MOTC  will  ensure  that  information \non  the  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  including  HIV/AIDS,  is  disseminated  to  the \nemployees of the works contractors under the project and members of local communities in the \nproject area. \n \nE. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \nThe  ADB-financed  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \n22. \nenvironmental examination was prepared and disclosed in July 2012, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  major  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  project \ninclude  (i)  air  and  water  pollution;  (ii)  noise  impacts;  (iii)  soil  erosion;  (iv)  generation  of \nconstruction  and  domestic  waste;  (v)  occupational  health  and  safety;  (vi)  cutting  of  trees;  and \n(viii)  disruptions  and  utilities  relocation,  occurring  mainly  during  construction.

In  accordance  with \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, a land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) was \nprepared.  The  LARF  provides  an  entitlement  matrix  for  possible  impacts  and  the  institutional \narrangements for implementation and supervision, monitoring, and grievance redress.  It will be \nused  if  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  issues  arise  due  to  design  changes  or \nunanticipated impacts during project implementation. MOTC shall report to ADB any LAR issues \nidentified upon full completion or update of the final design or during implementation, and obtain \nADB\u2019s prior approval before execution. In sections with pending LAR issues, no civil works will \nbe  allowed  to  commence.  The  supervision  consultant  will  include  a  resettlement  specialist  to \nconduct  training  for  COR  staff  and  prepare  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement-related \nreporting, if required. The South Kazakhstan COR is responsible for addressing all LAR-related \nissues  and  grievances  from  the  project.  Its  capacity  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  has \nbeen  strengthened  through  implementation  of  the  multitranche  financing  facility  for  CAREC \nTransport Corridor 1 (Zhambyl Oblast Section) [Western Europe-Western People's Republic of \nChina International Transit Corridor] Investment Program.19 \n \n25. \nThe EBRD-financed project (km 742\u2013km 804) will affect 130 residential and commercial \nstructures.
