A total of 221 person-months of international and 128 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  inputs  will  be  financed. \nConsulting services will be engaged in two packages. Of the three \ncontracts  under \nfor \nagribusiness support fund promotion, and project management and \nstudies.  ADB  will  select  the  consultants.  A  second  contract  will \nprovide agribusiness capacity building, and agribusiness policy and \nregulatory framework development. ADB will select the consultants. \nA  third  contract  will  focus  on  building  awareness  of  agribusiness \nfinance and monitoring. The State Bank of Pakistan will select the \nconsultants.  Each  contract  will  engage  an  international  firm  in \nassociation  with  domestic  firms.  Quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nprocedures  will  be  used  to  recruit  the  consultants,  using  full \ntechnical  proposals.  The  second  consultant  package  will  be  to \nestablish  and  operate  an  agribusiness  lending  function  within \nselected  PFIs.  It  will  have  3\u20135  separate  performance-based \ncontracts.  The  quality-based  selection  method  will  be  used \nbecause  the  services  to  be  performed  are  highly  specialized,  and \nonly available from a limited number of companies. A high degree \nof  flexibility  will  be  written  into  each  consulting  contract  to  allow \nimplementing  agencies  to  recruit  consultants  according  to  needs \nidentified as project implementation proceeds. \n\n \n\n\fto \n\ninvestment \n\nThe Project seeks to address market failures leading to inadequate \nfinancial  and  technical  support  for  the  private  sector  to  initiate \nagribusiness  enterprises,  failures  in  institutional  capacity,  and  the \nabsence  of  consistent  and  coherent  agribusiness  policies.  The \nin  new  or \nProject  will  encourage  private  sector \nupgraded  enterprises  that  have  been  constrained  by  financial  and \ntechnical  capacity  and  support.  The  Project  will  also  strengthen \ninstitutions  to  formulate  policies  and  implement  a  regulatory \nframework in compliance with international standards. The focus on \nstrengthening  private  sector  delivery  mechanisms \nthe \nagribusiness  sector  throughout  the  value  chain  is  expected  to \nincrease  client  power,  and  lead  to  greater  responsiveness  of \ninstitutions  and  market  mechanisms  in  the  value  chain  to  farmers' \nand  entrepreneurs\u2019  needs.  This  will  result  in  (i)  increases  in \nefficiency  by  reducing  transaction  costs,  and  (ii)  an  increased \nsupply  of  the  services  demanded  by  agribusiness  clients.  The \nProject will improve service delivery, institutional capacity, and the \nagribusiness policy environment in a comprehensive and systemic \nmanner  throughout  the  value  chain.  This  is  to  ensure  the  project \nimpact of supporting economic growth and employment generation \nthrough  agribusiness  development  is  efficiently,  effectively,  and \nsustainably  achieved.  About  2,000  agro-enterprises  in  both  the \nformal  and  informal  sectors  are  expected  to  benefit  from  ASF \noperations over the 5-year Project. Further, as a result of technical \nassistance  provided  to  PFIs,  3\u20135  institutions  are  expected  to \ndevelop  dedicated  agribusiness  finance  functions.  These  could \nbenefit  an  additional  10,000  agro-enterprises,  including  up  to \n12,500 farmer entrepreneurs, by improving access to finance, and \nincome  generating \nproviding \nopportunities, conservatively estimated at 100,000 person-years of \npermanent employment.  \n \nProject  implementation  involves  a  number  of  agencies  and  the \nprivate  sector,  and  could  encounter  delays.  This  risk is  addressed \nthrough  the  establishment  of  strong  oversight,  implementation \ncoordination,  and  governance  provisions  in  the  implementation \ntimely \narrangements.  To \nimplementation,  the  project  management  unit  will  recruit  well-\nqualified  staff  through  an  open  and  competitive  selection  process. \nMaximizing  the  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  project \nimplementation  will  also  mitigate  the  risk  of  failure  of  specific \ngovernment  institutions  to  implement  project  activities  efficiently \nand effectively. Sound business ethics will be used to ensure good \ngovernance in project implementation. To avoid undue government \ninterference,  particularly  in  ASF  operations,  the  ASF  will  be \nincorporated as an independent company. \n\nfacilitate  effective  coordination  and \n\nsignificant  employment  and \n\nvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Agribusiness Development Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nPakistan\u2019s  agriculture  sector,  accounting  for  25%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP), \nalmost 50% of employment, and about 70% of exports, is at a crossroads. Growth of the sector, \nwhich  is  dominated  by  traditional  food  (wheat,  rice)  and  industrial  (cotton,  sugarcane)  crops, \ndeclined  to  an  average  annual  rate  of  2.4%  with  sharp  year-to-year  fluctuations  from  1990  to \n2002,  as  compared  with  the  overall  rate  of  3.5%  achieved  from  1960  onward.  Yields  of  major \ncrops  have  largely  stagnated  for  the  past  decade.  Diversification  into  commercially  oriented \ncrops1 and dynamism in the livestock subsector is encouraging, but the dominance of the major \ncrops  in  agricultural  GDP  has  slowed  the  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  as  a  whole. \nRural poverty remained high at 38.9% in 2002, exacerbated by periodic drought. \n \nThe  stagnating  performance  and  persistence  of  high  poverty  in  agriculture  stand  in \n3. \ncontrast with the potential growth opportunities provided by domestic and international markets. \nWith  the  Government  targeting  8%  GDP  growth  in  the  medium  term,  and  with  wide-ranging \nmacroeconomic  and  sector  (including  financial)  reforms  well  under  way,  the  country  is  poised \nfor  a  period  of  sustained  economic  expansion.  In  Pakistan,  as  in  all  other  rapidly  growing \ndeveloping countries, sustained growth is universally accompanied by changes in food demand, \nas consumers shift away from diets dominated by starchy staples and unprocessed foodstuffs \ntoward  much  more  income-elastic  horticulture  and  livestock  products.  This  embodies  much \nhigher value addition and employment generation in agroprocessing and the marketing system. \nDuring  the  medium  term,  and  in  part  as  a  result  of  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO) \nagreements,  international  markets  will  pose  new  opportunities  and  challenges  for  Pakistan\u2019s \nagriculture  and  agribusiness2  sectors  in  an  increasingly  global  agribusiness  market.  However, \nwhile many developing countries have seen a fairly rapid expansion in agricultural exports over \nthe  past  decade,  Pakistan\u2019s  share  in  total  world  exports  has  actually  declined.  Pakistan\u2019s \nagricultural exports have remained heavily concentrated in low-value-added goods, while other \nregional producers have improved product technology and value addition. The stagnation in the \nexport  market  is  largely  because  world  markets  are  demanding  better  quality  products  and \nimproved  traceability,  related  to  WTO  regulations  and  standards,  and  other  increasingly \nstringent  standards  in  developed  markets.  Over  time  and  with  suitable  support,  Pakistan\u2019s \nagribusiness  subsector  will  expand  in  these  markets,  but  during  the  near  term,  the  domestic \nmarket alone provides substantial scope for much more rapid growth.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The total area devoted to fruit and vegetable production has increased rapidly in recent years, reaching 1.5 million \nhectares (ha) in FY2004. Between FY2002 and FY2003, production rapidly increased for some fruit crops such as \npeach  (103%),  persimmon  (76%),  and  pomegranate  (67%),  reflecting  the  strong  domestic  market  demand  for \nhorticultural crops. Citrus, with total production of 2.1 million tons in FY2004, is the largest horticulture crop group \nby  volume,  and  a  major  export  revenue  earner,  along  with  dates  and  mangoes.  Floriculture  is  a  relatively  new \nhorticultural subsector, and has grown at an annual rate of at least 10% over the past 3 years. All of these crops \nhave  good  competitive  potential  that  needs  to  be  exploited.  A  detailed  comparative  and  competitive  advantage \nanalysis of these crops is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n2   Agribusiness  in  the  context  of  the  Project  refers  to  horticulture,  livestock,  and  dairy  production,  processing,  and \n\nmarketing. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nAgribusiness enterprises range from micro-scale village based operations to large-scale, \n4. \nnationally recognized companies. Small and medium-scale agribased enterprises in the informal \nsector  employ  an  estimated  1.5  million  people.  As  the  smaller  enterprises  are  labor-intensive \nand  generally  located  in  or  close  to  rural  areas,  the  potential  for  direct  and  indirect  (through \nlinkages to farms) growth and employment generation is much greater than for the large firms. \nHence,  there  is  a  need  to  promote  the  transition  of  small  agribusiness  enterprises  into  larger, \nmore dynamic operations in order to develop a competitive agribusiness sector that maximizes \nthe impacts on rural growth and poverty reduction. A sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nWhile markets provide economic opportunities, commercial agriculture and agribusiness \ndevelopment in Pakistan is constrained by poor infrastructure (energy, transport, and storage); \nsector  institutions  and  policies,  and  governance  practices;  as  well  as  access  to  modern \ntechnology and to financial and business development services. No single project can address \nall  these  constraints.  Through  an  ambitious  public  investment  program,  the  Government  of \nPakistan  is  committed  to  rapidly  developing  major  infrastructure  to  support  broad-based \neconomic growth. In addition, in part with Asian Development Bank (ADB) support (paras. 8, 11, \nand 16), the Government wishes to improve governance, accelerate private sector development \nand  decentralization,  and  improve  the  performance  of  the  financial  sector.  The  Project  will \ncomplement  these  initiatives  through  a  set  of  carefully  targeted  interventions  specific  to  the \nneeds and constraints of the agribusiness subsector. \n \n6. \nThe constraints facing agribusiness are present throughout the product value chain from \ninput  supply  to  processing  and  exports,  leading  to  low  productivity  and  value  added.  The \nconstraints  must  be  addressed  with  a  comprehensive  and  systemic  approach  to  remove \nproduction,  market,  and  institutional  failures  and  rigidities  that  impede  the  development  of  the \nsector,  and  promote  demand-driven  development  with  maximum  participation  of  the  private \nsector,  including  farmers.  World  agricultural  product  markets  are  demanding  increasingly  higher \nproduct  quality,  and  unless  Pakistan's  agribusiness  products  conform  to  these  standards,  the \nagribusiness subsector will not be able to enter, let alone compete in, world markets under a WTO \nregime, including imports. The following key constraints, identified during the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance,3  must  be  removed:  (i)  market  failures,  including  limited  availability  of \nbusiness  development  services  (BDS,  para.  19)  to  small  entrepreneurs  to  support  business \nactivities  and  to  start  new  enterprises,  limited  access  to  finance,  and  limited  capacity  for  farmer \ngroup formation for agribusiness or agro-enterprise purposes to develop economies of scale, and \ncontinuity  of  supply  to  ensure  strong  market  penetration;  (ii)  institutional  constraints,  including \nweak  public-private  partnerships,  weak \ninstitutional  capacity,  poor  coordination  between \ngovernment agencies, and an absence of demand-driven agricultural research and extension; and \n(iii) the lack of a guiding national policy and long-term strategy aimed at developing a dynamic and \ncompetitive  agribusiness.  The  constraints  have  a  national  impact  because  the  government \ndecision-making process and facilitation capacity in agribusiness is limited and not cohesive; and \nthe private sector is not dynamic, competitive, or internationally compliant.  \n \nMarket Failures. The lack of a vibrant small and medium enterprise (SME) subsector for \n7. \nagribusiness  is  largely  a  result  of  market  failure.  Technical,  managerial,  marketing,  financial, \nand  legal  advisory  services  to  agribusiness  by  the  private  sector  are  almost  nonexistent. \nSeveral of the systemic constraints to sector development\u2014including low levels of technical and \nmanagerial  capacity,  low  product  quality  and  market  penetration,  limited  access  to  market \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Preparing the Agribusiness Development \n\nProject. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\ninformation, and virtually no access to finance from formal financial sector institutions\u2014could be \nresolved  through  improved  access  to  BDS  to  improve  the  creditworthiness  of  agribusiness \nenterprises.  The  limited  existing  services  are  primarily  in  the  public  sector.  They  have  not \nperformed  well  because  of  weak  management  and  staff  capacity,  and  inadequate  financing. \nAgribusiness research and extension services have been largely unresponsive to the needs of \nprivate  sector  agribusiness  enterprises.  The  demand  from  farmer  organizations  for  currently \ninaccessible BDS services is significant.  \n \nOther  developing  countries  have  effectively  improved  the  provision  of  BDS  by \n8. \nestablishing  time-bound,  cost-sharing  grant  schemes  that  provide  funding  for  enterprises  to \naccess  BDS,  and  for  BDS  providers  to  develop  and  upgrade  the  type  of  service  that  they \nprovide to agribusiness clients. Well-conceived and implemented BDS can (i) lower barriers to \nentry;  (ii)  facilitate  the  establishment  of  new  agribusiness  enterprises;  (iii)  lower  unit  costs  of \nproduction,  transport,  and  marketing;  (iv)  increase  marketable  surpluses;  (v)  encourage  and \nfacilitate  innovation  at  the  enterprise  and  sector  levels;  (vi)  help  individual  enterprises  to \ncoalesce into cohesive sector associations with a common  vision in terms of competitiveness, \ncountry  position,  and  target  markets;  (vii)  attract  private  capital;  (viii)  strengthen  backward \nlinkages  to  suppliers  and  forward  linkages  to  buyers;  and  (ix)  enhance  the  overall  viability  of \nenterprises and the sustainability of industries. International experience indicates BDS can have \na strong impact on economic growth in developing and emerging markets.4 The ADB-financed \nSmall  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector  Development  Program  (SMESDP)5  seeks  to  expand \naccessibility  to  BDS  through  the  Business  Support  Fund,  which  provides  matching  grants  to \nenterprises  for  BDS  support  in  areas  such  as  technology  development,  marketing,  business \nplanning, and training. Provision of such support to agribusiness enterprises is needed. \n \n9. \nA  major  constraint  for  agribusiness  SME  development  is  the  lack  of  access  to  formal \nsector debt and equity finance (Appendixes 2 and 5). Agribusiness, in particular SMEs, remains \nunderserved. The financing gap for small entrepreneurs is significant: only 5% of some 250,000 \nmicroenterprises  with  less  than  5  employees  receive  funding  from  formal  financial  institutions. \nThis is a sizeable underserved market. Many entrepreneur surveys confirm that lack of access \nand the cost of bank financing are significant barriers to expansion. Banks need to move from \ncollateral-based  lending  to  agribusiness  to  longer  term,  cash-flow-based  loans.  While  many \nbanks regard the SME sector as a growth market with considerable potential, most institutions \nstill  view  agribusiness  as  a  risky  subsector  with  a  history  of  high  loan  default.  This perception \nwas  largely  created  because  agricultural  borrowers  defaulted  on  input  loans  from  inefficiently \noperated public sector banks. Financial sector lending to agribusiness needs to be promoted by \nfocusing  on  (i)  improving  agribusiness  SME  creditworthiness  (to  be  achieved  in  part  through \naccess  to  BDS,  paras.  7\u20138),  thereby  reducing  the  perceived  level  of  risk  faced  by  financial \ninstitutions in lending to agribusiness; and (ii) enhancing the capacity of financial institutions to \nidentify  agribusiness  lending  opportunities,  and  to  appraise  and  supervise  agribusiness  loans \nbased on viable business plans and cash-flow projections, rather than collateral-based lending. \nThe SMESDP is providing support to financial institutions to improve their capacity to establish \neffective  lending  processes  to  select  and  serve  creditworthy  SMEs,  and  is  supporting  the \nestablishment  of  a  partial  credit  guarantee  facility  to  help  leverage  greater  financial  resources \nfor SMEs. It is also improving the SME policy environment. These interventions complement the \nspecialized assistance needed for agribusiness SMEs to access financing. \n\n                                                 \n4   Benefit-cost  ratios  of  5:1  are  common  for  interventions  to  provide  BDS.  Exports  generated  per  dollar  of  cost-\nsharing  grants  amounted  to  48  times  within  5  years  in  India,  36  times  within  1  year  in  Indonesia,  and  30  times \nwithin 1 year in Kenya.  \n\n5  ADB.  2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nInstitutional  Constraints.  Agro-enterprises  require  enhanced  technical  skills,  greater \n10. \nmarketing  orientation  and  networking,  better  market  information,  and  better  linkages  with \nservice providers to enable them to contribute more significantly to economic growth. Pakistan\u2019s \ninformal  (unregulated)  sector  is  estimated  to  generate  37%  of  the  country's  gross  national \nincome.  The  sector  comprises  97%  of  all  enterprises.  These  small  enterprises  face  significant \nbarriers  to  entry  and  operation  in  the  formal  economy.  The  country  has  few  examples  of \neffective  public-private  partnerships  to  exploit  the  comparative  advantage  possessed  by  each \nsector, and to address existing institutional and market failures. The private-sector-led Pakistan \nHorticulture  Development  and  Export  Board  (PHDEB)  is  one  example.  It  was  established  in \nAugust  2002  to  enhance  and  upgrade  horticultural  production  and  its  products,  and  exploit \nexport  potential.  PHDEB  has  effectively  created  a  comprehensive  network  of  linkages  and \nworking  relationships  in  the  horticulture  subsector.  This  experience  and  linkages  must  be \nutilized  to  stimulate  private  sector  investment  in  the  horticulture  subsector.  No  similar \norganization exists to represent the views of the private sector and promote the development of \nthe livestock and dairy subsector, and entrepreneurs in the livestock and dairy subsector have \nexpressed the need for such an organization.    \n \n11. \nHorticultural and agribusiness research is undertaken entirely by the public sector, with \n90%  of  all  funds  assigned  to  staff  salaries,  not  research.  Research  institutes  are  not \ncommercially oriented, or demand driven, to respond to entrepreneurs\u2019 needs. The Government \nmandates the Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department (FSCRD) to control seed \nquality and introduce standards for fruit propagation material. Because FSCRD does not have \nthe facilities to regulate and certify seed effectively, good quality and true-to-type seeds and fruit \ntree  seedlings,  and  disease-free  propagation  material  are  not  widely  available.  This  results  in \nfarmers  cultivating  poor  quality  and  not  true-to-type  horticulture  products  that  command  low \nmarket  prices,  and  prevent  producers  from  entering  lucrative  export  markets.  The  agriculture \nextension service has a comparatively high cost, lacks efficiency and quality, does not respond \nto the expressed needs of small farmers and the private sector, and has a major problem with \nfiscal sustainability. Extension services operated by private organizations are being successfully \nprovided  to  farmer  associations,  which  have  been  willing  to  pay  for  such  services.  Private-\nsector-led  and  demand-driven  extension  services  need  to  be  developed  through  farmer \norganization  and  private-sector  provision.  The  ADB-financed  Agriculture  Sector  Program  II6  is \nsupporting reforms to improve the efficiency of commodity markets; accelerate the provision and \ncoordination of agricultural support services, including relevant research and extension (such as \nintegrated  pest  management);  and  quality  control  and  regulation  measures \nthat  are \ncomplementary to the proposed Project. The Agriculture Sector Program also finances projects \nthat  support  the  development  of  agribusiness,  such  as  establishment  of  germ-plasm  units  for \nhorticultural  crops,  and  animal  export  holding  centers,  that  can  contribute  to  addressing  the \nconstraints faced by agribusiness.  \n \nThe Department of Agriculture and Livestock Product Marketing and Grading (DALPMG) \n12. \nis  responsible  for  providing  market  information.  Available  market  information  does  not \ncorrespond to the needs of entrepreneurs or producers. Private sector demand for the provision \nof commercial information services is increasing, demonstrated by agro-enterprises subscribing \nto  commercial  market  information  services.  The  development  of  such  services  needs  to  be \nsupported.  DALPMG  is  also  responsible  for  assuring  product  uniformity  and  quality  through \ngrading  standards.  However,  Pakistan's  reputation  as  an  exporter  of  fresh  fruit  and  vegetable \nproducts  is  poor  because  of  unreliability  of  product  quality  and  uniformity,  lack  of  traceability, \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2001.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\nand no standardization of product presentation and grading. Phytosanitary, hygiene, health, and \nsafety  regulations  also  do  not  conform  to  international  standards.  The  Government  is \nconsidering  giving  PHDEB  the  responsibility  for  horticulture  product  quality  assurance  by \noutsourcing  to  internationally  experienced  private  sector  firms.  The  need  to  ensure  the  quality \nand uniformity of agribusiness products is vital to creating a dynamic agribusiness subsector.   \n \n13. \nLack of Integrated Agribusiness Policy. The few national and provincial public agencies \nrelated to agribusiness work largely in isolation. An integrated and well-coordinated agribusiness \nstrategy  is  needed  to  (i)  support  and  promote  the  growth  and  performance  of  agribusiness, \nincluding  enterprise  start-up  and  expansion,  value-chain  integration,  and  product  specialization; \nand (ii) incorporate the informal sector into the agribusiness mainstream, particularly in the context \nof  globalization,  international  competitive  pricing,  the  need  for  investment  incentives,  and  world \ntrade  issues.  Also,  no  province-specific  horticulture  policies  prioritize  specific  local  product \nopportunities and the use of limited public financial resources. The existence of a well-publicized, \nprioritized, and stable policy environment is important both to existing and potential agribusiness \nventures. Private sector stakeholders have expressed a strong reluctance to increase investment \nin  the  sector  in  the  absence  of  a  favorable  policy  and  regulatory  environment  that  supports \nagribusiness development in a systemic, comprehensive fashion. \n \n14. \nLessons Learned. The Government has implemented many projects in the agriculture, \nrural  development,  irrigation,  horticulture,  livestock,  and  SME  and  trade  promotion  sectors \nduring  the  last  two  decades  (Appendix  2).  The  operational  lessons  from  Pakistan  and  other \nemerging markets are that (i) where policy, institutional, financial, and technical market failures \nexist, a comprehensive approach to overcoming them is required; (ii) while governments play a \nkey  role  as  facilitators  for  market  development,  direct  service  provision  should  be  left  to  the \nprivate sector, except where a clear market failure requires public sector service provision;7 (iii) \nregulatory  support  and  stimulation  of  market-based  BDS  has  proven  effective  in  promoting \neconomic  growth  and  employment  generation;  (iv)  BDS  should  be  demand  driven;  and  (v) \nsound business ethics must be established to ensure good governance and public credibility of \ndelivery schemes. These lessons have been carefully considered in designing the Project. \n \n15. \nThe  Project  is  to  address  the  constraints  outlined  in  paras.  5\u201313,  and  exploit  the \ndomestic  and  export  market  opportunities  that  exist  in  agribusiness,  thereby  contributing  to \nincreased  economic  growth  and  rural  employment.  The  Project  will  promote  the  realization  of \nthese  opportunities  by  (i)  improving  the  managerial,  production,  and  processing  skill  levels  of \nentrepreneurs and farmers to ensure the production of good quality raw material,  and uniform \nand high standard products; (ii) supporting participating financial institutions (PFIs) to increase \nagribusiness  lending  to  allow  stakeholders  to  exploit  market  opportunities;  (iii)  reorienting \ngovernment institutions to become facilitators of agribusiness development, using public-private \npartnerships;  (iv)  improving  the  policy,  regulatory,  and  financial  environment  to  make  it  more \nresponsive to private sector needs, and encourage producers and entrepreneurs to invest in the \nsubsector;  and  (v)  establishing  the  framework  and  standards  to  comply  with  increasingly \nstringent international standards. \n \nThe  Project  is  consistent  with,  and  included  in  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  for \n16. \nPakistan  2002\u20132006,  which  incorporates  the  promotion  of  private  sector  development  by \nsupporting  the  development  of  SMEs,  rural  finance,  and  agribusiness;  and  assisting  in  capital \nmarket development, and the restructuring and privatization of state-owned financial institutions. \n\n                                                 \n7   This lesson is substantiated by the experience gained in the ADB-financed Second Agriculture Development Bank \nof  Pakistan  Project.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Country Strategy and Program recognizes that the agribusiness subsector has the potential \nto  contribute  substantially  to  greater  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Pakistan. \nPromotion  of  private  sector  development  in  agribusiness  by  creating  an  enabling  environment \nand providing appropriate support for agribusiness, and its raw material supply, in particular, will \nincrease rural employment and income generating opportunities. The Project is complemented \nby ADB interventions in the agriculture sector (the Agriculture Sector Program II, rural finance \nand  microfinance  projects,  and  rural  development  projects),  and  in  capital  market  and  SME \ndevelopment,  supporting  the  provision  of  market-based  access  for  beneficiaries.  Appendix  3 \ndescribes external assistance to agriculture and agribusiness. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n17. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  agribusiness  growth.  The  outcome  is  to  develop  a  more \ncompetitive and sustainable agribusiness subsector. Project activities will focus in particular on \nimproving access of agribusiness enterprises to BDS, strengthening BDS providers to enhance \nskills  throughout  the  agribusiness  subsector,  expanding  access  to  agribusiness  finance,  and \ndeveloping  institutional  capacity.  The  Project  seeks  to  create  a  flexible  private  sector  service \ndelivery mechanism driven by market demand. The Project will concentrate on horticulture and \nhortibusiness;  interventions  to  improve  the  livestock  and  dairy  institutional  framework  will  also \nbe supported. The project interventions will contribute to strengthening and developing private \nsector  capacity,  involvement,  and  investment  in  agribusiness.  This  will  ultimately  lead  to  a \nstrong foundation for SMEs operating in the sector.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n18. \nThe  Project  comprises  five  components:  (i)  agribusiness  support  service  provision,  (ii) \nagribusiness  finance  development,  (iii)  agribusiness  capacity  building,  (iv)  agribusiness  policy \nand enabling environment development, and (v) project management support.  \n \n\n1. \n\nAgribusiness Support Service Provision \n\n \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  increased  access  to  BDS  by  agribusiness  enterprises  by \n19. \nfinancing  eligible  services  for  capacity  building,  including  technical,  managerial,  financial,  and \nmarketing skills. The Project will establish an agribusiness support fund (ASF) to provide funds \nto  eligible  agribusiness  enterprises,  farmers,  research  and  extension  service  providers,  and \nBDS providers (Appendix 4). Eligible services for ASF finance include (i) capacity-building and \nrelated  assistance  to  existing  agribusiness  enterprises  and  for  enterprise  start-ups,  but \nexcluding  the  financing  of  capital  equipment;  (ii)  support  to  individual  farmers  and  farmers\u2019 \ngroups for the formation of legally registered agribusiness enterprises that can then obtain ASF \nsupport  for  other  eligible  services;  (iii)  demand-driven  research  by  private  or  public  sector \nresearch institutions leading to increased and better quality production and improved production \nprocesses, or to meet an identified market demand; (iv) development of private sector extension \nservices to be provided to small-scale farmers proposing to supply raw materials to agribusiness \nenterprises;  and  (v)  support  for  private  sector  BDS  providers  to  enhance  the  availability  and \nquality of services provided to agribusiness enterprises. The ASF will finance 50% of the cost of \nthe  services  provided,  with  the  recipient  contributing  the  remainder.  To  support  the  entry  of \nsmall farmers into agribusiness, the ASF will finance 100% of the costs of establishing farmer \ngroup enterprises. The formation of farmer groups will be outsourced to eligible organizations, \nincluding  rural  support  programs  that  are  involved  in  the  creation  of  farmer  groups  for  both \ncommunity mobilization and credit delivery, and the creation of linkages to agro processors. The \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\ninvolvement  of  rural  support  programs  will  be  encouraged  given  the  clear  synergy  with  their \nmicrofinance programs, and linkages with processors.  \n \n20. \nThe  output  of  this  component  will  be  the  creation  of  commercially  viable  agribusiness \nenterprises of varying sizes producing a more diversified product range to meet the demand of \nincreasingly  discerning  consumers  in  both  domestic  and  international  markets.  Pakistan\u2019s \nreputation  for  supplying  agricultural  produce  that  complies  with  standards  will  be  significantly \nenhanced.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  develop  the  demand  for,  and  supply  of,  private  sector \nBDS  and  research  and  extension  services  specifically  geared  to  serving  agribusiness.  Finally, \nthrough  the  provision  of  support  to  farmers,  the  Project  will  develop  numerous  farmer  group \nenterprises, including those operated by women, enabling small farmers to compete effectively \nin the supply of agribusiness produce, and to capture a greater proportion of value added and \nincrease net incomes in the agricultural supply chain. \n \n\n2. \n\nAgribusiness Finance Development \n\n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  development  of  financial  services,  particularly  credit,  to \n21. \nagribusiness  enterprises  that  do  not  have  ready  access  to  such  services  (Appendix  5).  The \nProject  will  support  PFIs  to  develop  their  understanding  of  the  potential  agribusiness  finance \nmarket,  and  subsequently,  to  enhance  their  capacity  to  undertake  agribusiness  lending. \nCooperation with PFIs will be implemented using the services of international consultants, first \nthrough awareness building, and second, through specific in-house consulting services provided \nto  PFIs.  The  first  phase  will  involve  the  selection  of  private  sector  financial  institutions \n(predominantly  commercial  banks)  having  an  interest  in  developing  an  agribusiness  loan \nportfolio,  according  to  selection  criteria  to  be  agreed  with  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP).8 \nThe awareness-building phase will identify a shortlist of PFIs to be given guidance in preparing \na  proposal  to  access  capacity-building  support  from  the  Project,  including  an  agribusiness \nfinance  strategy  and  work  plan.  Proposals  will  be  submitted  to  SBP  for  review.  Based  on  the \nreview,  3\u20135  PFIs  will  be  selected  to  receive  customized,  in-house  support  to  develop  their \nagribusiness  finance  capacity.  In  the  capacity-building  phase,  separate  teams  of  international \nconsultants  will  work  with  each  selected  PFI  to  refine  its  strategy  and  work  plan,  and  identify \nmarket opportunities. Each consultant team will establish and operate an agribusiness lending \nunit over approximately 3 years. Capacity-building support will also help PFIs meet the eligibility \ncriteria  for  participation  in  the  partial  credit  guarantee  facility  established  under  the  SMESDP. \nThe output of this component will be 3\u20135 PFIs that have commercially viable agribusiness loan \nportfolios, and qualified and experienced staff who can expand the PFIs\u2019 agribusiness lending. \nThe Project will therefore act as a catalyst for the broader development of agribusiness finance \nin other financial institutions.  \n \n\n3. \n\nAgribusiness Capacity Building  \n\n \n22. \nCapacity  building  for  agribusiness  will  focus  on  horticulture  and  hortibusiness,  but  will \nalso  support  project  activities  to  be  undertaken  in  the  livestock  and  dairy  subsector.  The \ncomponent  will  seek  to  increase  the  private  sector  participation  in  the  provision  of  services \ncurrently  provided  by  public  sector  institutions.  To  facilitate  agribusiness  development  and \ninternational  compliance,  the  Project  will  support  the  rationalization,  restructuring,  and \ncoordination  of  relevant  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Food  and  Livestock  (MINFAL)  agencies  and \noffices concerned with alignment with WTO regulations and international product standards.  \n \n\n                                                 \n8   The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  identified  eight  commercial  banks  and  two  microfinance  institutions \n\nhaving an interest in developing an agribusiness lending function. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n23.  Market  Information.  The  Project  will  improve  the  availability  of  market  information, \nidentified  as  a  significant  constraint  to  agro-enterprise  expansion.  The  Project  will  promote  the \ndevelopment  of  information  on  private  sector  markets  through  outsourcing  by  DALPMG.  An \nappropriate private sector provider will be supported to develop a system that will initially focus on \nthe 11 major wholesale markets in the country, and Pakistan\u2019s major export markets for fruits and \nvegetables. DALPMG will continue to provide market information for other horticultural crops not \ncovered by the private sector provider. The outputs of this subcomponent will be to (i) establish a \nprivate  sector  market  information  system  providing  reliable,  impartial  market  information  on  a \ncommercially  viable  and  sustainable  basis;  (ii)  provide  agribusiness  stakeholders  with  market \ninformation  that  meets  their  needs;  and  (iii)  improve  market  efficiency  and  competitiveness  by \nproviding easily available and improved market information.  \n \nExport  Quality  Certification.  Support  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of \n24. \nDALPMG  in  export  quality  certification  by  (i)  providing  international  training  for  key  DALPMG \nstaff; (ii) revising and updating national quality standards consistent with international standards; \n(iii) upgrading DALPMG\u2019s export certification centers; and (iv) introducing operating procedures \nof  international  standard  for  sampling,  inspection,  and  quality  monitoring  systems.  Subject  to \nstatutory requirements, the Project may support PHDEB to contract quality certification services \nto the private sector through public-private partnerships. The subcomponent outputs will be to (i) \nstreamline  procedures  for  export  inspection  and  certification,  (ii)  ensure  compliance  with \ninternational requirements for quality standards and procedures, (iii) develop a quality-oriented \napproach  and  specific  standards,  (iv)  develop  linkages  with  international  agencies  monitoring \nexport,  and  (v)  improve  the  reputation  and  reliability  of  exports  leading  to  increased  export \nmarket penetration and greater demand.  \n\n25. \nSeed and Planting Material Certification. The Project will help strengthen the Federal \nSeed Certification and Registration Department (FSCRD) by (i) establishing and equipping nine \nregional  testing  laboratories;  (ii)  developing  a  systematic  and  quality-oriented  approach  to  the \nproduction of fruit and vegetable propagation materials; (iii) introducing internationally accepted \nstandards; (iv) training staff in field inspection techniques; (v) improving operating systems; (vi) \ntraining nursery producers in improved production techniques, and better plant propagation and \nhygiene  practices;  and  (vii)  reviewing  and  updating  existing  vegetable  seed  and  fruit  tree \nseedling certification standards and legislation. The outputs of strengthening FSCRD will be to \n(i) establish a practically based,  efficient, and effective FSCRD with testing facilities located in \nall  major  commercial  production  areas;  (ii)  restore  farmers\u2019  confidence  in  public  and  private \nsector  nurseries  and  seed  producers  producing  quality  propagating  materials;  (iii)  establish  a \nlocal vegetable seed industry producing selected varieties; (iv) improve the quality of all planting \nmaterials;  and  (v)  register  fruit  nursery  producers  and  establish  a  producers'  association  to \npromote their activities.  \n \nTraining.  The  PHDEB  horticulture  unit  training  coordinator,  supported  by  provincial \n26. \ntraining coordinators, will organize training to (i) develop curriculum and course content specific \nto  agribusiness;  (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  private  sector  trainers  and  the  institutions  or  service \nproviders that will provide training to entrepreneurs; (iii) improve technical and managerial skills \nin agribusiness enterprises; (iv) improve product output, quality and uniformity, and continuity of \nsupply  at  the  farm  level;  and  (v)  provide  agribusiness  training  to  provincial  and  special  area \nstaff. Support will be provided to selected institutions such as government commerce colleges, \nvocational  training  institutes,  and  business  schools  through  training  of  trainers  and  facilitators, \ncurriculum development, training methodology, and procurement of agribusiness-related training \nequipment and teaching aids. The training institutions will then provide agribusiness training to \nexisting  and  potential  entrepreneurs,  contractors,  traders,  and  businesses  in  enterprise \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\ndevelopment, management and management psychology, contract farming, and alignment with \nnational  and  international  standards.  Women's  participation  in  all  training  activities  will  be \nproactively promoted by the project management unit (PMU). At the farm level, the farmer field \nschool  concept9  will  be  implemented  as  a  pilot  program  in  each  of  the  provinces  and  special \nareas. Farmers trained in farmer field schools will be encouraged to associate and apply to the \nASF for support. The outputs of this subcomponent are to (i) improve the capacity of public and \nprivate sector institutions in agribusiness training delivery; (ii) familiarize master trainers with the \nfarmer  field  school  concept  and  have  them  develop  trainer-of-trainer  curricula,  and  training \nmodules for each crop; (iii) provide training of trainers to staff of provincial agricultural extension \ndepartments, nongovernment organizations, research institutes, projects, and the private sector \nto enable them to facilitate farmer field school events; (iv) hold farmer field school events to train \nabout  25,000  farmers,  including  women  farmer  groups,  to  use  integrated  pest  and  crop \nmanagement techniques on their crops; and (v) provide training for a minimum of five crops per \nprovince based on market demand.  \n \n27. \nPakistan  Horticulture  Development  and  Export  Board.  To  develop  more  effective \nlinkages  between  the  public  sector  and  private  agribusiness,  the  Project  will  establish  a \nhorticulture  unit  within  the  private-sector-led  PHDEB.  The  PHDEB  unit  will  help  implement \nproject  activities  in  the  horticulture  subsector,  and  facilitate  interaction  with  agribusiness \nenterprises. PHDEB will undertake a proactive promotional campaign to stimulate awareness of \nproject  activities.  PHDEB  will  (i)  contribute  to  and  support  provincial  and  special  area \nhorticultural  policy  task  forces;  (ii)  in  association  with  provincial  and  special  area  project \nimplementation  offices  (PIOs),  identify  potential  recipients  for  ASF  (para.  19)  cost-sharing \ngrants,  and  forward  their  applications  to  the  ASF;  (iii)  identify  enterprises,  farmer  group \nenterprises, and processors to determine training, extension, and research needs; and organize \ntheir  training;  (iv)  identify  farmer  groups,  exporters,  packers,  and  processors  that  wish  to \nbecome  internationally  compliant,  and  help  them  obtain  project  support;  and  (v)  work  closely \nwith the project horticulture and hortibusiness consultants to support their activities. PHDEB will \nintegrate these functions into its regular operations, to ensure sustainability after the Project. \n \n28. \nLivestock  and  Dairy  Development  Board.  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment \nof  a  livestock  and  dairy  development  board  (LDDB)  as  a  corporate  body,  which  will  play  a \nsimilar role to that of PHDEB in the livestock sector. The responsibilities of LDDB will be to (i) \ncoordinate national and provincial activities in livestock and dairy, (ii) promote investment in the \nsector, and (iii) promote livestock as the primary vehicle for poverty reduction among small and \nlandless  farmers,  especially  women.  The  Project  will  support  LDDB  by  commissioning  a \ncomprehensive livestock study to clearly identify constraints, suggest possible ways to improve \nthe  livestock  and  dairy  subsectors,  and  determine  possible  agro-enterprise  interventions  for \nfuture support. The findings and recommendations of the study will provide a basis for reviewing \nthe livestock and dairy policy. The Project will contract training service providers to help LDDB, \nparticularly  in  terms  of  stakeholder  agro-enterprise  development  and  business  support, \nstandards  compliance,  and  livestock  and  dairy  farmer  group  formation,  including  women-only \nlivestock groups.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAgribusiness Policy and Enabling Environment Development \n\n \n29. \nThis  component  will  assist  the  Government  to  develop  an  appropriate  policy  and \nenabling  environment  for  private-sector-led  agribusiness  development.  This  includes  national \nand  provincial  interventions  to  redefine  roles  and  responsibilities  in  the  sector;  strengthen  the \n                                                 \n9   The  farmer  field  school  concept  is  basically  integrated  crop  management  through  training  of  trainers  and \n\nfacilitators. Farmers have begun to pay for such services in selected areas.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nregulatory  framework,  in  particular  for  alignment  with  international  standards;  and  create \neffective public-private partnerships to promote sector development. Consultants and funds for \nmeeting costs will be provided to MINFAL to establish a task force to develop a comprehensive \nnational agribusiness policy based on a participatory and consultative approach (Appendix 6). A \nPMU  and  consultants  will  supervise  the  task  force  in  its  activities.  The  policy  will  cover  (i) \ndefinition, vision, and strategy; (ii) institutional framework and scope of government facilitation; \n(iii)  sector  objectives  including  priority  subsectors  and  products  to  exploit  comparative  and \ncompetitive  advantages;  (iv)  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  implementing  the  strategy  with  key \nproduction targets; and (v) other key issues identified by the task force.  \n \n30. \nProvincial  policy  task  forces  will  also  be  constituted,  and  consultant  and  meeting  costs \nwill be supported to formulate horticultural development policies for Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh, \nand  special  areas;  and  to  review  the  existing  policy  in  North-West  Frontier  Province.  These \npolicies will emphasize promoting greater private sector participation, rationalizing government \nprogram  and  project  initiatives;  and  establishing  crop-specific  development  priorities  based  on \nresource audits and comparative and competitive advantage analysis, including an action plan \nto  implement  the  policies.  The  agribusiness  and  horticulture  policies  will  be  completed  and \nissued by their respective federal and provincial governments by the end of the first project year, \nwhen the task forces will terminate. The task forces will have no more than five members, with \nthe majority from the private sector. The international agribusiness policy advisor will chair the \nagribusiness task force, while the national horticulture policy advisor will chair the provincial and \nspecial area task forces.  \n \n31. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  development  of  the  regulatory  framework,  and  establish \nquality  and  certification  requirements  for  locally  produced  products  to  align  with  international \nstandards.  In  particular,  the  Project  will  assist  the  WTO  cell  in  MINFAL  to  formulate \namendments to the legal framework to align with commitments made in regard to sanitary and \nphytosanitary  measures  in  Pakistan\u2019s  agreements  with  WTO.10  The  Project  will  also  help \nMINFAL  develop  programs  to  collate  and  disseminate  information  relating  to  international \nstandards to relevant stakeholders in both the private and public sectors.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Management Support \n\n \n32. \nA PMU will be attached to the Islamabad office of DALPMG, within MINFAL, and will be \nresponsible  for  project  management  and  implementation  of  project  activities,  coordinating \nconsultant  inputs,  reporting,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  A  horticulture  unit  will  be \nestablished  in  PHDEB  to  support  project  activities  in  horticulture  and  hortibusiness.  At  the \nprovincial level and in the special areas, PHDEP will establish PIOs. They will coordinate with, \nand  provide  technical  support  in  horticulture,  and  livestock  and  dairy  agribusiness  to  the \nprovincial  agriculture  agencies.  The  Project  will  undertake  studies  on  key  agribusiness-related \nissues,  including  studies  to  determine  the  comparative  and  competitive  advantage  of  a  select \nnumber  of  targeted  markets  and  products  within  hortibusiness,  and  to  identify  agribusiness-\noriented livestock interventions in areas of comparative advantage. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n10  The laws requiring amendment include the (i) Pakistan Plant Quarantine Act (1976), (ii) Federal Seed Certification \nAct  (1976),  (iii)  Agricultural  Produce  (Grading  and  Marketing)  Act  (1937),  and  (iv)  Pakistan  Animal  Quarantine \n(Import and Export of Animals and their Products) Act (1985). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nthat  have  demonstrated  potential \n\nC. \n \n33. \nThe  Project  will  establish  market-based  approaches  to  agribusiness  development  and \nenhance  technical  and  managerial  capacity  in  the  subsector.  It  will  dismantle  barriers  to  entry \nfor  new  enterprises,  or  expansion  of  existing  enterprises  enabling  them  to  operate  more \neffectively,  penetrate  new  markets,  and  improve  profitability,  with  significant  multiplier  effects \nthroughout the agribusiness production and marketing chain. The introduction of greater market \norientation  in  agribusiness  will  be  accompanied  by  the  mobilization  of  domestic  financial \nresources  to  improve  the  delivery  of  financial  services,  in  particular  credit  to  agribusiness. \nComplementary  project  interventions  to  refocus  government  activities  on  policy  and  regulation \nrather  than  on  direct  involvement  in  production  and  marketing  will  enhance  the  potential  for \nprivate-sector-led growth in agribusiness to meet the demand for safe, high-quality products in \ndomestic and international markets. To maximize the Project\u2019s impact, interventions are tailored \ntoward  specialization  in  a  range  of  specific  products  with  comparative  and  competitive \nadvantage to which resources can be targeted to make a significant impact. The interventions \nwill  begin  in  the  first  year  of  the  Project  by  identifying  and  working  with  farmer  groups  and \nthe  production,  productivity, \nprocessors \nprocessing, and marketing of products with revealed comparative and competitive advantage to \nbegin  to  develop  the  potential  of  agribusiness  in  Pakistan.  The  interventions,  spearheaded  by \nthe agribusiness support service provision, agribusiness finance development, and agribusiness \ncapacity building components, will lead to vertical integration in the value chain (from the field to \nthe consumer) in production areas or clusters of single or similar types of products. The Project \nwill  support  this  specialization  in  conjunction  with  quality  improvement  to  achieve  greater \nproduct  comparative  and  competitive  advantage.  These  initial  project  interventions  are \nanticipated  to  have  a  demonstration  effect  that  will  stimulate  more  rapid  development  of  the \nsector\u2019s potential. \n \nD. \n \n34. \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $49  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and service charges during implementation (Table \n1).  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $8.3  million,  17%  of  the  total  cost.  The  local \ncurrency  cost  is  estimated  at  $40.7  million  equivalent,  83%  of  the  total  cost.  Local  currency \ncosts  include  an  estimated  $3.6  million  equivalent  in  taxes  and  duties  to  be  paid  by  the \nGovernment.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum during amortization. The loan will fund the entire foreign exchange cost of $8.3 \nmillion  and  $22.7  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  (56%  of  the  total  local  currency \ncost).  The  Government  will  provide  $6.9  million  equivalent,  or  14%  of  the  project  cost. \nAgribusiness enterprises including BDS and private sector research and extension providers will \nfund $10.4 million (21% of total project costs) as their matching contribution to the services to be \nsupported  by  the  ASF,  including  training  costs.  Private  sector  institutions  (market  information \nservice  providers,  market  committees,  and  PFIs)  will  finance  $0.6  million  (1%  of  total  project \ncosts) as their contribution to operating costs of the services that they provide under the Project. \nBeneficiaries  (farmers)  will  finance  $0.1  million  (0.2%  of  project  costs)  by  contributing  to  the \ncosts  of  training  received  under  the  Project.  The  use  of  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources  and \nlocal cost financing is justified because the project components provide capacity building as a \ncatalyst  to  develop  agribusiness  and  enhance  skill  levels.  Over  the  life  of  the  Project,  the \nGovernment,  agribusiness  enterprises,  and  private  sector  institutions  will  make  an  increasing \n\n \n\n\fcontribution to project operating costs.11 The Borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plana \n($ million) \n  \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nAgribusiness Enterprises \nPrivate Sector Institutions \nBeneficiaries \n\nTotal \n\nLocal \nCurrency\n22.7 \n6.9 \n10.4 \n0.6 \n0.1 \n\nTotal \nCost \n31.0 \n6.9 \n10.4 \n0.6 \n0.1 \n\nPercent \n\n63 \n14 \n21 \n1 \n0 \n\n40.7 \n\n49.0 \n\n100 \n\n8.3 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n8.3 \n\na Figures may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Execution \n\n36.  MINFAL will be the Executing Agency for the Project.12 It will oversee the establishment \nof  the  ASF  until  its  board  of  directors  is  appointed.  Thereafter,  the  ASF  will  operate  as  an \nautonomous  private  sector  company  independent  of  government.  SBP,  as  the  Implementing \nAgency  for  the  agribusiness  finance  development  component,  will  be  responsible  for  (i) \nestablishing  PFI  eligibility  criteria,  (ii)  approving  PFIs  that  will  benefit  from  capacity  building  in \nagribusiness finance, and (iii) coordinating the selection and recruitment of the capacity-building \nconsultants  for  agribusiness  finance  awareness  and  agribusiness  finance.  PHDEB  and  LDDB \nwill also be important project implementation partners and facilitators, particularly in identifying \npotential  applicants  to  the  ASF.13  PHDEB  will  be  especially  important  given  its  extensive \nnetwork in the horticulture subsector and allied industries. A project steering committee, chaired \nby  the  MINFAL  secretary,  has  been  established  to  approve  the  appointment  of  key  PMU \npersonnel;  approve  the  annual  workplan  and  budget;  review  project  performance  and  provide \nguidance on required project modifications; provide policy, strategic, and regulatory advice and \noversight;  and  facilitate  coordination  among  the  participating  agencies.14  Prior  to  loan \n                                                 \n11  Institutions  and  enterprises  are  assumed  to  increase  contributions  to  operating  costs  financed  by  the  Project  by \none third each year starting from the second year, contributing 100% from year 4 onward. Farmers\u2019 contributions \nwill be increased by one quarter each year from the second year onward, contributing 100% in the final year of the \nProject. \n\n12 A financial management assessment of MINFAL was made, and the project implementation arrangements (paras. \n36  and  38)  are  designed  to  mitigate  financial  management  risks,  with  maximum  use  of  private  sector  service \nproviders, including the project director and ASF general manager.  \n\n13ADB  will  enter  into  a  project  agreement  with  SBP.  Upon  the  incorporation  of  the  ASF,  it  will  enter  into  a  project \nagreement with ADB. Similarly, each of LDDB and PHDEB, upon either the effectiveness of a bill to establish each \nof them as an autonomous statutory agency, or their incorporation as a not-for-profit company pursuant to Section \n42 of the Companies Ordinance, will also enter into a project agreement with ADB. Each of ASF, LDDB, PHDEB, \nand SBP will also enter into a performance agreement with MINFAL. \n\n14  Other  members  of  the  steering  committee  may  include  the  joint  secretaries  of  the  Ministries  of  Finance, \nCommerce,  and  Industries;  director,  Agricultural  Credit  SBP;  chief  executives  of  PHDEB,  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise Development Authority, and  LDDB; project director; and nine  members drawn from the private sector, \nincluding farmer associations, traders, processors, exporters, and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce. The \nprovincial and special area secretaries of agriculture and livestock, and chambers of commerce will nominate the \nprovincial and special area members. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  Project\u2019s  primary \n\neffectiveness, a small-scale technical assistance will be used to support MINFAL and the PMU \nto prepare for project implementation. A project implementation chart is in Appendix 8. \n \n37. \nThe  PMU  will  be  attached  to  DALPMG  at  the  federal  level  in  Islamabad.  MINFAL  will \nrecruit  and  appoint  a  project  director  with  qualifications  and  experience  satisfactory  to  ADB, \nfollowing an open and competitive selection process.15 The director will be assisted by a project \ncoordinator;  two  deputy  project  directors  for  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  finance  and \nadministration;  a  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  specialist;  and  necessary  support  staff, \nincluding an accountant. A project implementation coordination committee will be chaired by the \ndirector general of DALPMG, and include representatives of FSCRD, PHDEB, PFIs, PIOs, SBP, \nthe ASF general manager, provinces and special areas, private sector representatives, and the \nproject  director  and  coordinator.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least  every  6  months.  Its \nresponsibility will be to address and resolve implementation issues, and to advise the PMU on \ntechnical matters and the project steering committee on policy matters. Composite provincial or \nspecial  area  coordination  committees  for  horticulture  and/or  livestock  will  be  established  to \ncoordinate  project  activities.16  Given \nfocus  on  horticulture  and \nhortibusiness, PHDEB will help implement project activities in these areas, coordinating closely \nwith  the  PMU.  A  horticulture  agribusiness  manager  recruited  from  the  private  sector  will  head \nthe  horticulture  unit  in  PHDEB  (reporting  to  the  PHDEB  chief  executive  officer),  assisted  by  a \ntraining coordinator and finance manager. The PIOs will report to the PHDEB horticulture unit. \nThe primary function of the PIOs is to promote the Project\u2019s concepts, create awareness of and \nidentify  potential  clients  of  the  ASF,  identify  potential  areas  of  intervention,  and  interface  with \nexisting  and  prospective  agribusiness  enterprises  and  respond  to  their  specific  needs.  In \naddition,  the  PIOs  will  liaise  closely  with  PHDEB  to  manage  activities  concerned  with \nhorticultural  production  and  agro-enterprise  development.  A  provincial  coordinator  with \nagribusiness experience in the private sector will head each PIO, assisted by an  agribusiness \nspecialist, finance and administration manager, and training coordinator. \n \nThe  ASF  will  be  established  under  the  auspices  of  MINFAL  within  9  months  of  loan \n38. \neffectiveness. The Project will provide the ASF with its funds on a grant basis. It will be a not-\nfor-profit  company  limited  by  guarantee,  following  the  same  procedures  used  to  establish  the \nBusiness  Support  Fund.17  An  independent  board  of  directors  comprising  eight  members,  five \nfrom  the  private  sector  and  three  from  project-related  government  agencies,  will  oversee  its \noperations. The ASF will be run by a full-time general manager of international standard to be \nappointed  by  MINFAL  based  on  a  transparent,  openly  publicized,  and  competitive  recruitment \nprocess.  An  appraisal  panel  will  be  established  within  the  ASF  to  appraise  all  applications  for \nASF funding. The appraisal panel will be chaired by the general manager and will consist of four \nadditional  members  who  will  also  be  appointed  through  transparent,  openly  publicized \nrecruitment procedures. Three financial analysts will be recruited to review applications prior to \nsubmission for evaluation by the appraisal panel. Additional financial analysts will be recruited to \nreflect  the  volume  and  type  of  applications  received.  The  ASF  will  also  have  access  to  funds \nfrom which it will be able to finance consultants to review applications when an expert opinion \nbeyond  the  scope  of  the  financial  analysts  may  be  required.  The  ASF  will  take  sole \n                                                 \n15  The director will have 10\u201315 years of experience in agribusiness at a senior level. The Government agreed to the \n\nappointment of project directors following this process during the 2004 Country Portfolio Review Mission. \n\n16  The  secretaries  of  agriculture  and  livestock  will  chair  the  respective  provincial  or  special  area  horticulture  or \nlivestock  coordination  committee.  Each  province  or  area  will  determine  the  composition  of  the  respective \ncommittees,  but  generally  they  will  comprise  at  least  the  PIO  coordinator,  representatives  of  the  planning  and \ndevelopment, finance, industries, agriculture, and livestock departments; the private sector; farmers associations; \nand other concerned agencies such as FSCRD, LDDB, and PHDEB. \n\n17  Under a licence from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, under Section 42 of the Companies \n\nOrdinance, 1984. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\nresponsibility for processing applications for grant support. A supervision officer will be engaged \nto monitor and supervise the utilization of grant funds by recipient enterprises. \n \n39. \nThe  PMU,  PIOs,  and  other  project-related  institutions  will  promote  the  ASF  and  link \npotential  ASF  clients  to  it.  Rural  support  programs  may  be  contracted  through  the  ASF  to \nidentify existing farmer clients wishing to form a legally registered farmer group enterprise, and \nsupport  them  through  enterprise  incorporation  and  establishment  procedures.  Following  their \nestablishment  as  an  enterprise,  the  farmers  will  be  able  to  submit  applications  to  access  ASF \nfunds  for  eligible  services.  In  all  cases,  responsibility  for  completing  grant  applications  will  be \nthat  of  the  grant  applicant.  All  contractual  arrangements  relating  to  approved  grants  will  be \nmade  between  the  ASF  and  grant  recipients,  and  will  not  involve  any  intermediary  or  agent. \nDetails of the scope, management, and operation of the ASF are in Appendix 4. \n \n40. \nSBP  will  select  and  recruit  consultants  for  the  agribusiness  finance  awareness \ncampaign; they will work with potential PFIs to advise them on the preparation of proposals for \nestablishing  or  expanding  an  agribusiness  lending  function.  Subject  to  the  review  of  PFI \nproposals  and  PFI  eligibility  criteria  (to  be  formulated  by  SBP  with  support  of  the  awareness-\nbuilding consultants), SBP will select a number of PFIs to receive customized capacity-building \nsupport. SBP will then, in consultation with individual PFIs, select and recruit consultants for PFI \ncapacity  building.  SBP  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  consultants\u2019  performance  throughout \nthe capacity-building period. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  (Appendix  9).  Year  1  will  be  spent \n41. \nestablishing  the  project  management  and  implementation  framework,  including  the  PMU, \nPHDEB  horticulture  unit,  and  PIOs.  The  ASF  will  be  incorporated  within  9  months  of  loan \neffectiveness.  Immediately  upon  its  incorporation,  the  ASF  will  process  a  limited  number  of \napplications  to  enable  fine-tuning  of  procedures  and  processes,  and  to  ensure  that  the \nadministrative  capacity  will  not  be  overwhelmed  in  the  early  stages.  This  will  allow  the  client \nbase to be built in a gradual and focused manner.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n42. \nGoods and related services financed by ADB will be procured following ADB Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Supply  contracts  for  equipment  or  materials  are  not  expected  to  exceed \n$500,000, but should such a contract be required it will be awarded on the basis of international \ncompetitive  bidding.  Those  costing  less  than  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  (other  than  minor \nitems) will be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding, or as applicable, international \nshopping.  Direct  purchase  will  be  used  for  small  or  off-the-shelf  items  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000. The PMU will procure the equipment and vehicles. Indicative procurement packages \nare in Appendix 10. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the \n43. \nUse of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants. A total of 221 person-months of international and 128 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting inputs will be financed under the Project. Consulting services will \nbe engaged in two packages. The first package will have three contracts. One contract will be \nissued for agribusiness support fund promotion, and project management and studies. ADB will \nselect the consultants. A second contract will be issued for agribusiness capacity building, and \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nagribusiness policy and regulatory framework development. ADB will select the consultants. A \nthird contract will be used for agribusiness finance awareness building and monitoring. SBP will \nselect  the  consultants.  Each  contract  will  engage  an  international  firm  in  association  with \ndomestic  firms.  Quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  will  be  used  to  recruit  the \nconsultants, using full technical proposals. ADB will recruit consultants required for horticulture \ntraining  as  individuals.  SBP  will  administer  the  second  consultant  package  to  establish  and \noperate  an  agribusiness  lending  function  within  selected  PFIs.  Three  to  five  separate \nperformance-based contracts will be developed, one for each PFI. The quality-based selection \nmethod  will  be  used  because  the  services  to  be  performed  are  highly  specialized,  and  only \navailable  from  a  limited  number  of  companies.  A  high  degree  of  flexibility  will  be  written  into \neach  consulting  contract  to  allow  implementing  agencies  to  recruit  consultants  according  to \nneeds  determined  as  project  implementation  proceeds.  The  ASF  general  manager  will  be \nrecruited directly by MINFAL, subject to the approval of ADB. The summary terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 11.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n44. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. For the timely release of funds, imprest accounts will be established at the National \nBank of Pakistan for the use of the ASF, MINFAL, PHDEB, and SBP.18 The imprest accounts \nwill  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB. \nThe initial cumulative amount to be deposited in the imprest accounts will not exceed 6 months \nof estimated expenditure or 10% of the total loan amount, whichever is less. The ADB statement \nof  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate \nadvances made to the imprest account in accordance with ADB loan disbursement guidelines. \nAny  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting and Auditing \n\n45. \nASF,  MINFAL,  PHDEB,  and  SBP  will  prepare  and  maintain  separate  accounts  for \nproject-related disbursements. ASF, PHDEB, and SBP, as implementing agencies, will prepare \nand  submit  their  accounts  to  MINFAL.  MINFAL  will  consolidate  the  accounts  and,  after  audit, \nsubmit them to ADB.  MINFAL will establish an audit review process and commission financial \nand performance audits of the PMU by an audit agency in accordance with auditing standards \nacceptable to ADB. ASF, PHDEB, and SBP will establish similar audit procedures using auditing \nfirms associated with internationally recognized firms, or an audit agency acceptable to ADB, in \naccordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited accounts \nand financial statements will be submitted to ADB in English within 6 months of the end of each \nfiscal  year,  and  should  include  an  audit  with  a  separate  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure procedure. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Reporting \n\n46. \nThe PMU, assisted by consultants, will use a project performance monitoring program to \nensure  that  project  activities  and  facilities  are  managed  efficiently,  and  that  target  groups \nreceive  the  intended  benefits.  The  PMU  and  its  consultants  will  submit  a  detailed  plan  for \nmonitoring  performance  on  a  gender-disaggregated  basis  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and  concurrence \nwithin  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  A  baseline  survey  will  be  completed  within  the  first  6 \n                                                 \n18  The ASF imprest account will be opened upon incorporation of the ASF. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\ntraining, \n\nincluding \n\nformulation,  capacity-building \n\nmonths of the Project, and will include a review of existing agribusiness enterprises, and factors \nsuch  as  raw  material  sourcing,  access  to  credit,  technology  utilized,  managerial  and  staff \ncapacity,  existing  market  and  market  share,  product  quality,  and  customer  satisfaction.  The \nbaseline  information  will  later  be  utilized  to  assess  the  Project's  impact  on  agribusiness \nenterprises.  Monitoring  activities  will  assess  whether  the  project  inputs  and  activities  have \ndelivered the expected outputs and benefits to the intended beneficiaries, covering agribusiness \npolicy \nthe \neffectiveness of the ASF, the lending performance of PFIs, and project management including \nthe performance of consultants. The monitoring system will also be used to detect, at an early \nstage,  any  discrepancy  between  the  project  plan  and  its  execution.  Project  stakeholders  will \nalso monitor and evaluate project activities using workshops, and participatory appraisals. The \nPMU  will  collect  information,  and  prepare  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  for  ADB, \nincluding annual benefit monitoring reports. Project impact assessment consultants, engaged by \nthe Project, will identify additional strategic indicators in addition to the baseline indicators, and \nmonitor them twice a year, with more detailed reviews in years 3 and 5. MINFAL will complete \nan impact evaluation study prior to submitting to ADB, within 3 months of project completion, a \nthe  progress  on  project \nproject  completion  report  providing  a  detailed  evaluation  of \nimplementation,  costs,  consultants'  performance,  social  and  economic  impacts,  and  other \ndetails as may be requested by ADB. \n \n\nthe  provision  of  BDS  and \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n47. \nIn  the  first  3  years  of  the  Project,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  reviews  to  determine \nwhether  the  implementation  and  monitoring  arrangements  are  appropriate  and  effective.  These \nreviews will monitor relevant indicators, to be identified at the beginning of project implementation, \nto assess whether the process-oriented approach is working. During year 3, a detailed study will \nreview project progress before the ADB comprehensive midterm review to assess performance; \nidentify  any  problems  and  constraints  affecting  project  implementation,  including  changes  in  the \npolicy  and  institutional  environment;  and  reach  agreement  on  required  changes  to  address  any \nshortcomings. Any required changes in scope, activities, and associated financial reallocation will \nbe incorporated following the midterm review. These periodic reviews will draw upon information \nprovided by the project performance monitoring system. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n48. \nThe  Project  seeks  to  address  (i)  market  failures  leading  to  inadequate  financial  and \ntechnical  support  to  the  private  sector  to  initiate  agribusiness  enterprises,  (ii)  failures  in \ninstitutional capacity, and (iii) the absence of consistent and coherent agribusiness policies and \ndirection.  The  Project  will  encourage  investment  by  the  private  sector  in  new  or  upgraded \nenterprises. It will also strengthen institutions to formulate policies and implement a regulatory \nframework in compliance with international standards. The focus on strengthening private sector \ndelivery  mechanisms  to  agribusiness  throughout  the  value  chain  will  increase  satisfaction  in \ndomestic  and  international  markets,  and  lead  to  greater  responsiveness  of  institutions  and \nmarket mechanisms to the needs of consumers, entrepreneurs, and farmers. This will result in \nincreases  in  efficiency  by  reducing  transaction  costs,  and  increasing  the  supply  of  services \ndemanded  by  agribusiness  clients.  Through  improved  service  delivery  the  project  goal  of \nsupporting economic growth and employment generation through agribusiness development will \nbe  efficiently,  effectively,  and  sustainably  achieved.  Agribusiness  clients  (primarily  horticulture \nagro-enterprises  and  farmer  groups)  will  gain  greater  power  in  product  and  service  markets, \nthereby improving access at lower costs, accountability, and service delivery. About 2,000 agro-\n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nEnvironmental and Social Impacts \n\nenterprises  in  the  formal  and  informal  sectors  are  anticipated  to  benefit  from  ASF  operations, \nwhich will include up to 12,500 farmer entrepreneurs incorporated into agribusiness enterprise \ngroups over the 5-year Project. Further, with anticipated technical assistance provided to PFIs, \n3\u20135  institutions  will  develop  dedicated  agribusiness  finance  functions  that  could  benefit  an \nadditional  10,000  agro-enterprises  by  improving  access  to  finance,  and  providing  significant \nemployment and income generating opportunities, conservatively estimated at 100,000 person-\nyears of permanent employment.  \n \nSince  the  project-supported  provision  of  BDS  and  other  services  in  agribusiness  is \n49. \nentirely  demand  driven,  the  precise  mix  and  scale  of  outputs  from  the  Project  are  difficult  to \npredict.  Furthermore,  the  long-term  benefits  of  a  stronger  enabling  environment  for  private \nsector  activity  in  agribusiness  cannot  be  quantified  with  any  degree  of  precision.  Therefore,  a \nfull  financial  and  economic  analysis  of  the  overall  Project  is  considered  impractical. \nNevertheless,  financial  models  were  prepared  for  a  range  of  indicative  horticultural  crops  and \nlivestock  production,  and  small  and  medium-sized  agro-enterprises  that  could  be  supported \nunder the ASF to determine financial incentives for beneficiaries to tap its resources and other \nproject-related  support  services.  The  analysis  of  the  models  indicates  that  most  crop  and \nlivestock  production  opportunities  and  agro-enterprises  are  financially  viable  and  sustainable. \nFurther details of the financial analysis are in Appendix 12. \n \nB. \n \n50. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  FI  in  accordance  with  ADB  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines. The Project's focus is on capacity building, so the Project will not have \nadverse  impacts  on  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  or  the  environment,  and  thus  will  not \ntrigger  mitigating  measures  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  on  indigenous  peoples  and  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  (Appendix  13).  Nonetheless,  initial  environmental  examinations  were \ncarried  out  on  potential  agro-enterprises  as  part  of  project  preparation.  The  Project  will  also \nfor \nsupport  an  environmental  monitoring  consultant;  environmental  awareness \nagribusiness  enterprises;  and  monitoring  of  environmental  risks  of  agribusinesses  receiving \nASF  grants,  to  improve  their  environmental  practices.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy.19  In  addition,  in  the  poverty  partnership  agreement, \nthe Government and ADB have agreed that the medium-term strategy for agriculture and rural \ndevelopment  is  to  increase  agricultural  productivity  and  diversification  through  a  move  to \nmarket-based  agricultural  prices  and  expansion  of  the  role  of  the  private  sector.20  The  Project \nwill  contribute  to  the  realization  of  these  strategic  objectives  through  its  support  for  private-\nsector-led agribusiness development. The Project will increase income-earning and employment \nopportunities for SME owners, small farmers, landless laborers, and low-wage workers in urban \nareas,  which  in  turn  will  help  to  facilitate  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  accelerate  poverty \nreduction.  \n \nC. \n \n51. \nThe Project involves a number of agencies and the private sector, and could encounter \ndelays.  This  risk  has  been  addressed  through  the  establishment  of  strong  oversight, \nimplementation  coordination,  and  governance  provisions  in  the  implementation  arrangements. \nThe  PMU,  PHDEB,  and  PIOs  will  help  to  facilitate  effective  coordination  and  timely \nimplementation, and all three will recruit well-qualified staff from the private sector. The private \n\ntraining \n\nRisks \n\n                                                 \n19  Government of Pakistan. 2003. Accelerating Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty.

Maximizing  the  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in \nproject  implementation  will  also  mitigate  the  risk  of  failure  of  government  institutions  to \nimplement  project  activities  efficiently  and  effectively.  A  predominately  private  sector  board  of \ndirectors  will  manage  the  ASF  and  its  funds,  with  an  internationally  experienced  general \nmanager, and staff recruited from the private sector, who will recruit required consultants. SBP \nwill also select the consultants to support the PFIs. \n \nA demand-driven, process-oriented approach to project implementation is relatively new to \n52. \nPakistan,  and  risks  undue  government  interference,  particularly  in  ASF  operations.  This  risk  is \nmitigated  by  incorporation  of  the  ASF  as  an  independent  company,  which  itself  is  autonomous \nfrom  government,  and  support  for  PFIs  implemented  by  SBP.  The  demand-driven  process  will \nalso  be  supported  through  a  series  of  awareness-building  and  consultation  meetings  and \nworkshops. The creation of a strong enabling environment, capacity building targeted primarily to \nthe private sector, support to create capable BDS providers, and creation of focused agribusiness \nlending units in PFIs will all contribute to the growth of small- and medium-scale horticultural and \nlivestock production and agro-enterprises, and the long-term sustainability of project outcomes. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n53. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\nWithin  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  a  project \nimplementation  coordination  committee  to  be  chaired  by  the  director  general  of \nDALPMG  and  include  as  members,  the  project  director,  project  coordinator, \nrepresentatives  of  FSCRD,  PFIs,  PHDEB,  PIOs,  SBP,  the  private  sector,  and \neach of the provinces and special areas.  \n\n(ii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  in  each \nprovince and special area, a horticulture and livestock coordination committee to \nbe  chaired  by  the  secretaries  of  agriculture  and  livestock  as  appropriate,  with \nmembers  comprising  the  PIO  coordinator;  representatives  of  the  agriculture, \nfinance,  industries,  livestock,  planning  and  development  departments  in  the \nrespective  province  or  special  area;  the  private  sector;  and  other  concerned \nagencies such as FSCRD, LDDB, and PHDEB. \n\n(iii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness  the  PMU,  and  within  6  months  of  loan \neffectiveness,  the  horticulture  unit  of  PHDEB,  and  PIOs  will  be  respectively \nestablished,  adequately  staffed,  and  assigned  powers  and  functions  to  the \nmutual satisfaction of the Government and ADB. \n\n(iv)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure that the ASF \n\ngeneral manager is recruited. \n\n(v)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, a first year work plan for the Project will be \n\nprepared and submitted for ADB approval. \n\n(vi)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nto \n\nmemorandum,  articles  of  association,  and  other  required  documents \nincorporate ASF are prepared. \n\n(vii)  Within 9 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure that the ASF \nis  incorporated  as  a  not-for-profit  company  under  Section  42  of  the  Companies \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n(viii) \n\nOrdinance  with  the  board  of  directors  comprising  eight  members  (five  from  the \nprivate sector and three from project-related government agencies).  \nImmediately following its incorporation, the Government will ensure that the ASF \n(a)  enters  into  a  project  agreement  with  ADB;  (b)  adopts  a  business  plan, \nstandard  operating  procedures  that  incorporate  the  principles  of  equitable \nparticipation of women and conflict of interest rules, and code of conduct for staff \nand members of the board of directors acceptable to ADB; and (c) establishes an \nimprest account. \n\n(ix)  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  adopt  the  national \nagribusiness  development  policy,  and  ensure  that  the  respective  provincial  and \nspecial areas adopt horticulture policies formulated under the Project.  \n\n(x)  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will either (i) submit to \nits Cabinet for approval and submission to Parliament a bill to establish LDDB as \nan  autonomous  statutory  agency,  or  (ii)  incorporate  LDDB  as  a  not-for-profit \ncompany  with  responsibility  to  promote  the  development  of  the  livestock  and \ndairy subsectors.  \n\n(xi)  Within 15 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will either (i) submit to \nits Cabinet for approval and submission to Parliament a bill to establish PHDEB \nas an autonomous statutory agency, or (ii) incorporate PHDEB as a not-for-profit \ncompany with responsibility to promote horticulture development and exports.   \n\n(xii)  Within 2 years of loan effectiveness, the Government will submit to its Cabinet for \napproval  and  submission  to  Parliament  the  amendment  of  the  relevant  laws, \nincluding those specified in para. 31, to achieve alignment with the requirements \nunder the WTO commitments. \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  implementation  of  the  Project, \nadequate  budgetary  allocations  of  the  required  counterpart  funds  are  approved \nand released in a timely manner to ensure proper project implementation.  \n(xiv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not  cause  any  involuntary \nresettlement and negative impact on indigenous people.

interlinked activities related to the commercial production of \n1. \nagricultural  commodities  (including  crops,  livestock,  fisheries,  and  forestry);  the  transformation \nof agricultural commodities into products; the provision of inputs to the production of agricultural \ncommodities  (including  planting  and  genetic  material,  agrochemicals,  equipment,  and \npharmaceuticals);  and  the  marketing,  distribution,  and  trade  of  agricultural  commodities  and \nproducts.  Agribusiness  in  the  context  of  the  Project  refers  to  horticulture  and  hortibusiness \ndevelopment,  with  selected  interventions  to  improve  the  livestock  and  dairy  institutional \nframework and support selected enterprises. \n \n2. \nMinor  crops,  which  include  horticultural  crops,  contribute  12%  of  value  addition  in \nagriculture, and grew by 1.7% in FY2004 against a target of 3.5%. Estimates indicate that the \ntotal  area  of  fruit  and  vegetable  production  in  FY1998  was  995,000  hectares  (ha); by  FY2000 \nthis had increased to around 1,500,000 ha. Cultivation of fruit and vegetable crops has steadily \nincreased,  however  total  production  has  varied,  and  in  more  recent  years  shown  a  downward \ntrend  mainly  because  of  the  drought,  and  restricted  water  supply  in  fruit  production  areas. \nNevertheless  between  FY2002  and  FY2003  output  increased  for  some  fruit  crops\u2014peach \n(103%),  persimmon  (76%),  and  pomegranate  (67%)\u2014reflecting  sustained  growth  in  domestic \nmarket  demand.  Pakistan  is  a  major  producer  of  fruit  and  vegetables,  with  most  produce \nconsumed  domestically,  including  over  90%  of  mango,  date,  and  citrus  production.  Globally \nPakistan  ranks  fourth,  eighth,  and  sixth  for  date,  citrus,  and  mango  production  respectively. \nFloriculture is a relatively new horticultural subsector, and is growing at a rate of at least 10% \nper year. \n \n3. \nThe  livestock  subsector  accounts  for  49.1%  of  total  agricultural  value,  with  an  11.4% \ncontribution  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  In  FY2003  the  total  export  value  of  livestock \nproducts  was  PRs53  billion,  which  represented  12.3%  of  total  exports.  Pakistan  is  the  fifth \nlargest  producer  of  milk  in  the  world  with  29.8  million  tons  in  FY2004.  Over  the  last  decade, \nannual milk consumption has increased by 2.5\u20135%. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nAlthough  markets  provide  the  economic  opportunities,  constraints  to  commercial \nagriculture  and  agribusiness  development  in  Pakistan  encompass  infrastructure  (energy, \ntransport, and storage); sector institutions and policies, and governance practices; and access \nto  modern  technology  and  to  financial  and  business  development  services.  No  single  project \ncan  address  all  these  constraints.  Through  an  ambitious  public  investment  program,  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  is  committed  to  rapidly  developing  major  infrastructure  to  support \nbroad-based economic growth. Similarly, in part with Asian Development Bank (ADB) support, \nthe Government is moving to improve governance, accelerate private sector development and \ndecentralization,  and  improve  the  performance  of  the  financial  sector.  The  Project  will \ncomplement  these  initiatives  through  a  set  of  carefully  targeted  interventions  specific  to  the \nneeds and constraints of agribusiness. \n \n5. \nMarket  Failures.  The  horticulture  subsector  and  its  agro-enterprises  are  not  classified \nas an industry and do not have access to competitive loans for enterprise establishment. Risk \naversion among the private sector financial institutions is high, with low lending comfort levels. \nThe  subsector  is  at  a  distinct  disadvantage  as  compared  with  other  subsectors  such  as \n\nSectoral Constraints and Issues \n\n\fAppendix 2          25 \n\nindustrial  crops.  The  bulk  of  agro-enterprises  are  family  owned,  and  are  characterized  by \ninvestment  based  on  internal  sources  of  funding  and  organic  growth.  One  outcome  of  recent \nfinancial sector reforms is a significant increase in private sector credit, including credit delivery \nin the agriculture sector. However, while the share of agriculture in total loans has increased, it \naccounted for only 4.7% (PRs11.5 billion) of total net loans of PRs244.6 billion made from July \n2003  to  March  2004.  The  total  credit  requirement  in  agriculture  for  2004/05  is  estimated  at \nPRs252  billion  compared  with  a  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP)  target  of  PRs85  billion, \nrepresenting  a  financing  gap  of  PRs167  billion.  Moreover,  79%  of  all  disbursements  in \nagriculture were for seasonal production loans rather than development loans. Notwithstanding \nthe  increase  in  agricultural  lending,  agribusiness,  in  particular  small  and  medium  enterprises \n(SMEs),  remains  largely  underserved.  Large-scale  agribusiness  enterprises  account  for  the \nmajority  of  agribusiness  credit  provided  by  financial  institutions.  The  primarily  large-scale  food \nand  beverage  subsector,  for  instance,  accounted  for  16%  (PRs35.9  million)  of  total  net  loans \nfrom July 2003 to March 2004. Prospective or existing agribusiness SMEs are not adequately \nserved  with  financial  services,  particularly  credit,  by  the  formal  financial  sector.  Although  data \nrelating to agribusiness is limited, in the SME sector, only 5% of some 250,000 enterprises with \nless  than  five  employees  are  estimated  to  receive  funding  from  formal  financial  institutions. \nAbout  13%  of  medium  SMEs  use  formal  financing  for  working  capital.  Access  improves \ngradually  with  firm  size.  This  does  not  include  entrepreneurs  seeking  to  establish  SME \nagribusiness enterprises, and indicates the sizeable underserved market that exists. \n \n6. \nThe  banking  system  encompasses  40  banks,  most  are  privately  owned.  About  90%  of \nlending  to  SMEs  comes  from  the  commercial  and  private  banks.  Many  banks  and  leasing \ncompanies  are  facing  increasing  competition  in  their  traditional  markets,  and  regard  the  SME \nsector  as  a  growth  market  with  considerable  potential.  However,  most  institutions  still  view \nagribusiness  as  a  high  risk  sector with  high  historical  levels  of  loan  default.  This,  and  the  fact \nthat  many  smaller  agribusiness  enterprises  operate  outside  the  formal  commercial  system, \nsuggests that the solution to providing increased volumes of credit to agribusiness does not lie \nin simply making more funds available, but in removing market failures. To address this issue, \nefforts  need  to  focus  on  (i)  improving  agribusiness  SME  creditworthiness;  (ii)  reducing  the \nperceived  level  of  risk  faced  by  financial  institutions  in  lending  to  agribusiness;  and  (iii) \nenhancing the capacity of financial institutions to identify agribusiness lending opportunities, and \nto appraise and supervise agribusiness loans.  \n \n7. \nInstitutional  Failures.  Hortibusiness  and  agro-enterprises  require  enhanced  technical \nskills,  greater  marketing  orientation  and  networking,  better  market  information,  and  better \nlinkages  with  service  providers  to  enable  them  to  contribute  more  significantly  to  economic \ngrowth.  The  coordination  between  government  ministries  that  have  an  input  in  the  sector  is \nlimited.  The  ministries  of  food,  agriculture,  and  livestock  (MINFAL);  commerce;  finance;  and \nindustry  all  have  a  role  to  play  in  agribusiness.  Even  within  MINFAL,  coordination  between \nrelevant sections and cells is poor. Under the auspices of MINFAL there is an agribusiness cell \nin  the  Pakistan  Agricultural  Research  Council,  the  Agricultural  Export  Promotion  Cell  in  the \nAgricultural  Prices  Commission,  and  a  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  section.  All  work  on \nseparate  agendas  and  responsibilities.  Decision  making \nis  haphazard  without  strong \nagribusiness  leadership.  The  federal  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Livestock  Product \nMarketing  and  Grading  (DALPMG)  has  the  mandate  for  (i)  market  information  services;  (ii) \nquality  control  and  grading  standards,  which  includes  international  standards  compliance;  and \n(iii) agricultural commodity research. However, it needs to promote private sector involvement in \nthe provision of some of these services, particularly market information services, and commodity \nresearch. The private sector cannot develop fully unless an environment is created that allows it \nto enter into service areas currently being provided by government. \n\n\f26          Appendix 2 \n\n \n8. \nAll agricultural and agribusiness research in the country is funded by the public sector. \nFiscal  constraints  affect  operational  research  funding,  with  90%  of  all  funds  assigned  to  staff \nsalaries,  and  only  10%  available  for  operational  activities\u2014grossly  insufficient  to  conduct \ntangible research activities. Research institutes are not commercially oriented; they are not even \nallowed  to  sell  their  germ-plasm  and  breeding  materials  to  the  private  sector.  The  extension \nservice  has  a  comparatively  high  cost,  lacks  efficiency  and  quality,  with  fiscal  sustainability  a \nmajor  problem.  The  agriculture  extension  service\u2019s  main  focus  is  on  the  major  staple  and \nindustrial  crops,  and  primarily  on  production,  with  little  work  in  the  field  of  postharvest \ntechnology  and  processing.  Farmers  lack  knowledge  and  awareness  of  modern  production \ntechniques, and need practical training and extension to support development. The approach of \nthe  farmer  field  school  has  proven  to  be  highly  successful  in  providing  farmers  with  improved \nagronomic, postharvest, and integrated pest management practices, and leads to formation of \nfarmer groups that are able to access required extension advice from private sector providers. \n \n9. \nThe  Federal  Seed  Certification  and  Registration  Department  is  mandated  by  the \nGovernment  to  control  seed  quality  and  the  introduction  of  standards  for  fruit  propagation \nmaterial.  The  department  does  not  have  the  facilities  to  implement  effectively  the  necessary \nregulation  and  certification,  primarily  because  of  the  lack  of  facilities  located  in  the  main \nproduction  centers.  Poor  quality  seeds  and  seedlings,  and  the  lack  of  enforcement  of \nregulations  are  a  major  limiting  factor  in  raising  yields  and  achieving  product  uniformity  and \nquality.  Average  fruit  yields  declined  by  9%  between  1995  and  2002,  and  only  in  dates  and \nmangoes have yields increased slightly, whereas vegetable yields have increased by 9% during \nthe same period due primarily to a 21% increase in the potato crop output as a direct result of \nplanting improved seed. Seed quality needs to be improved, involving the private sector to the \nextent possible. \n \n10. \nThe country\u2019s phytosanitary, hygiene, health, and safety regulations are not aligned with \ninternational  standards,  and  require  revision.  Knowledge  of  sanitary  and  phytosanitary,  other \nWTO  standards,  and  the  Euro-retailer  Produce  Working  Group  Good  Agriculture  Practices \nregime is not adequate in both the public and private sectors. The identification of new export \nmarkets  and  expansion  of  existing  markets  will  falter  because  of  increased  regulations  and \nrestrictions  in  importing  countries,  unless  Pakistan  aligns  with  WTO  and  other  export \nrequirements.  \n \n11. \nThe market information utilized in Pakistan is primarily price oriented, and does not take \ninto  account  product  quality,  grade,  volumes  traded,  consignment  size,  and  origin.  The  prices \nare  disseminated  without  analysis,  and  do  not  correspond  to  the  specific  needs  (strategic, \ntactical,  and  operational)  of  the  various  stakeholders.  Price  information  is  mainly  for  the \nconsumption  of  the  public  sector.  DALPMG  collects  market  prices  for  26  essential  items  on  a \ndaily  basis  and  200  products  on  a  weekly  basis,  from  11  wholesale  markets  throughout  the \ncountry.  A  comprehensive  and  holistic  market  information  system  primarily  attuned  to  the \ncommercial needs of the private sector, and provided by the private sector is needed. \n \nLack  of  Agribusiness  Policy.  Although  a  few  national  and  provincial  public  agencies \n12. \nare  related  to  agribusiness,  these  agencies  work  largely  in  isolation.  An  integrated  and  well-\ncoordinated  agribusiness  strategy  is  needed  to  (i)  support  and  promote  the  growth  and \nperformance  of  the  agribusiness  subsector, including  enterprise  start-up  and  expansion,  value \nchain  integration,  product  specialization;  and  (ii)  incorporate  the  informal  sector  into  the \nagribusiness  mainstream,  particularly  in  the  context  of  globalization,  international  competitive \npricing,  the  need  for  investment  incentives,  and  world  trade  issues.  Also,  no  province-specific \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2          27 \n\nLessons Learned \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\nhorticulture  policies  prioritize  specific  local  product  opportunities,  and  the  use  of  limited  public \nfinancial resources. The existence of a well-publicized, prioritized, and stable policy environment \nis  important  both  to  existing  and  potential  agribusiness  ventures.  Private  sector  stakeholders \nhave  expressed  a  strong  reluctance  to  increase  investment  in  the  sector  in  the  absence  of  a \nfavorable  policy  and  regulatory  environment  that  supports  agribusiness  development  in  a \nsystemic, comprehensive fashion. \n \nC. \n \n13.  MINFAL  has  stated1  that  a  number  of  policy  issues  need  to  be  addressed  by  the \nGovernment in agriculture and agribusiness. Those relevant to agribusiness include (i) making \nagriculture  a  priority  area  to  address  issues  of  rural  unemployment,  poverty  reduction,  and \neconomic  growth;  (ii)  providing  a  policy  focus  for  sustainable  food  security,  increasing \nproductivity,  commercial  agriculture,  import  substitution,  income  diversification,  and  export \norientation; (iii) increasing farmer productivity and profitability; (iv) prioritizing the private sector's \nrole  in  leading  public-private  sector  partnerships;  (v)  restructuring  the  institutional  services  of \nagricultural research and extension to raise farmer productivity and profitability; (vi) establishing \nnew markets in areas where the marketing structure is weak; and (vii) building capacity on WTO \nissues.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe Government has implemented many projects in the agriculture, rural development, \nirrigation,  horticulture,  livestock,  and  SME  and  trade  promotion  sectors  during  the  last  2 \ndecades (Appendix 3). The operational lessons from Pakistan and other emerging markets are \nthat (i) where policy, institutional, financial, and technical market failures exist, a comprehensive \napproach  to  overcome  these  constraints  is  required;  (ii)  while  governments  play  a  key  role  as \nfacilitators for market development, direct service provision should be left to the private sector, \nexcept where the market failure requires public sector service provision;2 (iii) regulatory support \nand  stimulation  of  market-based  business  development  services  has  proven  effective  in \npromoting  economic  growth  and  employment  generation;  (iv)  business  development  services \nshould be demand driven; and (v)  sound business ethics must be established to ensure good \ngovernance  and  public  credibility  of  delivery  schemes.  These  lessons  have  been  carefully \nconsidered in designing the Project. \n \nE.  \n \n15. \nDuring project preparation, the financial viability of nine representative agro-enterprises \nwas studied. All had a financial internal rate of return of more than 12%, clearly demonstrating \nthe  opportunities  that  exist  for  entrepreneurs  in  agribusiness  (Appendix  12).  About  1.5  million \npeople  are  employed  in  such  small-  and  medium-size  horticultural  enterprises.  There  is  a \npressing  need  to  encourage  the  growth  of  micro  horticultural  enterprises  to  support  the \ntransition  to  small  and  ultimately  medium-scale  enterprises  to  make  the  sector  competitive  on \ndomestic and international markets.  \n \n\nAgribusiness Opportunities \n\n                                                 \n1  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock.  2004.  A  Status  Report  on  Agricultural  Perspectives  and  Policies. \n\n2   This lesson is substantiated by the experience gained in the ADB-financed Second Agriculture Development Bank \n\nIslamabad. \n\nof Pakistan Project. \n\n\f28          Appendix 2 \n\n16.  Market Opportunities. With a rapidly growing population,3 the domestic demand for fruit \nand  vegetables  and  their  processed  products  is  expanding,  which  presents  an  opportunity  for \nproducers and processors. The income elasticity of fruits ranges across income groups, but on \naverage is high enough to sustain an annual growth in demand of about 8%, given the current \nannual  population  growth  rate  of  1.9%,  and  GDP  growth  rate  of  6.4%.  Income  elasticities  for \nvegetables  and  fresh  milk  are  lower  than  fruits,  but  still  significantly  positive,  and  support  an \nestimated  annual  growth  in  demand  of  about  6%.  The  income  elasticities  for  processed  fruits, \nvegetables,  and  milk  products  are  much  higher,  and  result  in  annual  increases  in  demand  in \nexcess of 10% on average, indicating a sizeable potential market for domestic processors.  \n \n \n17. \nThe major commercial fruits with a strong domestic demand are apples, apricots, dates, \ncitrus  (mainly  kinnow),  guavas,  grapes,  mangoes,  peaches,  and  plums.  The  major  vegetable \ncrops  are  chili,  carrot,  cauliflower,  onion,  potato,  and  tomato.  The  market  for  fruit  juices,  fruit-\nbased  drinks,  and  tomato  ketchup  is  expanding  rapidly,  at  about  15\u201320%  annually.  The \nproduction  for  horticultural  products  is  highly  seasonal.  In  addition,  large  price  variations  and \ncyclic trends lead to fruit and vegetable imports, creating opportunities for import substitution.  \n \n18. \nFrom 1999\u20132003, the top 10 horticultural export products based on export earnings by \nvalue  were  dates  (dried),  kinnow,  onions,  mangoes,  pine  nuts,  potatoes,  mushrooms,  dates \n(fresh),  chilies  (powder),  and  cumin  seed.  Annual  fruit  and  vegetable  exports  have  recently \ngrown by 32%, except for fresh dates, which have declined by 10.6% per annum, indicating the \npotential  for  further  exploitation  of  world  demand  for  horticulture  products.  In  Pakistan\u2019s  main \nfruit and vegetable export markets, the country\u2019s export market share is less than 1%, except for \nDubai  and  Afghanistan.  Horticulture  exports  to  the  leading  markets  of  the  European  Union, \nNorth  America,  and  Japan  are  miniscule,  indicating  the  need  to  remove  the  constraints  to \npenetrating  these  markets.  Floriculture  is  a  relatively  new  subsector  even  in  the  domestic \nmarket, with a growth potential of at least 10%. The world trade in flowers is around $30 billion, \nwhile  Pakistan\u2019s  annual  floriculture  exports  are  only  about  $2  million.  While  the  markets  are \ncompetitive, opportunities do exist, and importers are continually seeking new products.  \n \n19. \nAnnual  per  capita  consumption  of  fresh  milk  is  estimated  at  72  kilograms,  leading  to  a \nfresh  milk  demand  in  2002  of  about  10.0  million  tons,  which  is  expected  to  increase  to  an \nestimated 12.8 million tons by 2010, assuming fresh milk consumption trends remain constant. \nNearby countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China and Russian Federation are expected \nto experience 40% growth in milk demand by 2008. Both domestic and regional export market \nopportunities therefore exist. \n \n20. \nThe  private  sector  is  increasingly  involved  in  slaughterhouses.  Per  capita  meat \nconsumption is expected to rise by 290% by 2020, with red meat production not keeping pace \nwith demand. The Gulf States have relaxed their trade restrictions on the export of livestock and \nlivestock products from Pakistan, and the Afghan market has opened up. If slaughterhouses can \nget  easier  access  to  better  quality  and  healthier  stock  through  direct  purchasing  from  farmers \ngrouped  in  fattening  associations,  and  the  raw  material  can  be  traced,  this  subsector  could \nexpand rapidly. \n\n                                                 \n3   Estimated to be 141 million with a per capita income of $652, the population is expected to grow to 344 million by \n\n2050 with a sizeable middle income consumer base of 69 million. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3        \n\n29\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURE \nAND AGRIBUSINESS RELATED SECTORS \n \n\n \n \nProject Title \nAgriculture Sector Program-II  \nAgriculture Sector Program-II  \nBahawalpur Rural Development Project \nSindh Rural Development \nNWFP Barani Area-II  \nDera Ghazi Khan Rural Development \nMalakand Rural Development  \nKhushhali Bank  \nSmall and Medium Trade Enhancement Project \nTrade Export Promotion and Industry \nPakistan Poverty Alleviation Project Phase-I  \nSecond Poverty Alleviation Fund Project  \nAJK Community Infrastructure and Services  \nBanking Sector Technical Assistance Project  \nState Bank Partnership for Microfinance \nFinancial Sector Strengthening Program \nEU Capacity Building for Trade Related Activities  \nTrade Initiatives from a Human Development Perspective \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AJK  =  Azad  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  EU  =  European  Union,  IBRD  =  International \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  IDA  =  International  Development  Association,  NWFP  =  North-West \nFrontier  Province,  SDC  =  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation,  UNDP  =  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme. \nSources:  Ministry  of  Food  Agriculture  and  Livestock,  Economic  Affairs  Division  Ministry  of  Finance,  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, Islamabad, Food and Agriculture Organization, Islamabad, assistance agencies and their \nwebsites.\n\n \n \nFunding Agency \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nIBRD/IDA \nIBRD/IDA \nIBRD/IDA \nIBRD/IDA \nSDC \nSDC \nEuropean Union \nUNDP \n\nExternal \nAssistance \n($ million) \n249.6\n2.3\n36.5\n56.1\n59.3\n38.0\n45.4\n150.0\n150.0\n7.5\n90.0\n238.0\n20.0\n26.5\n0.7\n2.4\n7.3\n2.0\n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n          Appendix 4 \n\nA. \n\nRationale    \n\nAGRIBUSINESS SUPPORT FUND \n \n\nIn  many  countries,  access  to  effective  business  development  services  (BDS)  has \n1. \ncatalyzed enhanced enterprise productivity and profitability. In Pakistan, technical, managerial, \nmarketing, financial, and legal advisory services are limited and, in the context of agribusiness, \nalmost nonexistent. Services that do exist have tended to be in the public sector and have not \nperformed  well  because  of  a  lack  of  policy  direction,  management  and  staff  capacity,  service \nmarketing,  and  adequate  financing.  As  a  result,  choice  in  the  BDS  market  is  limited  as  the \nprivate sector has effectively been prevented from entering the market by uncompetitive service \npricing by public sector entities. Public sector research and extension services have also been \nlargely unresponsive to the needs of private sector agribusiness enterprises. These supply-side \nconstraints are exacerbated by a lack of demand on the part of some agribusiness enterprises, \nwhich  have  yet  to  appreciate  the  benefits  of  BDS,  and  have  limited  choice  of  competitively \npriced services to meet their business development needs. \n \n2. \nBDS  related  to  agribusiness  need  to  be  developed.  One  approach,  which  has  worked \neffectively  for  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  other  developing  countries,  is  to \nestablish  a  time-bound  cost-sharing  grant  scheme  that  provides  support  to  BDS  providers  in \ndeveloping  and  upgrading  the  type  of  service  they  are  able  to  offer  to  business  clients,  and \nsupports agribusiness enterprises to access such services. This approach has been adopted in \nthe  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector  Development  Program  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). It will also be adopted in the proposed Project.  \n \nB. \n\nScope \n\n3. \nThe Project will establish and fund on a grant basis an agribusiness support fund (ASF) \nto provide matching funds to finance a range of capacity-building services aimed at increasing \nenterprise  productivity  and  profitability,  and  at  facilitating  enterprise  startups.  ASF  funding  will \nalso be available for demand-driven research and extension services that will lead to increased \nand  better  quality  production,  improved  production  processes,  or  meet  an  identified  market \ndemand. To support enterprises in sourcing such services, ASF grants will also be available to \nBDS providers to enhance their capacity to deliver effective services to agro-enterprise clients. \nFinally,  the  ASF  will  also  cooperate  with  rural  support  programs  (RSPs)  to  support  individual \nfarmers and farmers\u2019 groups to form legally registered agribusiness enterprises that will then be \nable  to  access  ASF  support  for  other  eligible  services.  Eligible  enterprises  will  be  required  to \nfinance  50%  of  the  cost  of  the  services  they  employ,  the  remaining  50%  being  contributed  by \nthe  ASF  as  a  grant.  To  facilitate  the  development  of  small  farmers  into  agribusiness  ASF \nfunding  will  be  available  to  only  finance  100%  of  the  costs  of  farmers\u2019  enterprise  formation. \nFunds  will  not  be  available  for  the  financing  of  capital  equipment.  The  life  of  the  ASF  is \nintentionally designed to be temporary, ending upon project completion, to achieve a one-time, \nand  sustainable  increase  in  the  capacity  and  supply  of  BDS  to  agribusiness.  However,  other \noptions  may  be  considered  if  continuation  of  the  ASF  beyond  the  project\u2019s  completion  date  is \ndeemed advisable. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4        \n\n31\n\nC. \n\nEstablishment, Management, and Operation \n\n1. \n\nEstablishment \n\nASF  activities  will  be  overseen  by  a  board  of  directors  comprising  eight  directors,  of \n4. \nwhich  at  least  five  will  be  from  the  private  sector,  with  a  maximum  of  three  directors  from  the \npublic sector, to be nominated by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock (MINFAL). All \nboard members will be respected individuals from the private and public sectors, acting in their \nindividual capacities, rather than as representatives of particular organizations. Governance and \nmanagement  structures  and  operating  procedures  will  broadly  follow  those  of  the  Business \nSupport  Fund  (BSF)  of  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector  Development  Program \n(detailed  in  paras.  5-18).  ASF  structure  and  operation  will  benefit  from  experience  gained  in \noperating  the  BSF  prior  to  project  implementation  and  may,  as  a  result,  change  prior  to  its \nestablishment.  \n \n5. \nThe ASF will be incorporated within 9 months of loan effectiveness. MINFAL will act as \nthe Implementing Agency for the ASF until its incorporation, when it will become independent of \ngovernment.  Prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  a  small-scale  technical  assistance  will  be  used  to \nsupport MINFAL prepare the ASF articles of association and the process of incorporation. The \ntechnical assistance consultant will also prepare a preliminary work plan and standard operating \nprocedures  for  the  ASF,  develop  criteria  for  staff  qualifications  and  experience,  and  develop \neligibility  criteria  for  grant  recipients  and  services  to  be  supported.  Eligibility  criteria  for  ASF \nfunding applications and ASF operating procedures will be subject to approval by the ASF board \nof  directors.  A  full-time  manager  with  recognized  international  experience  managing  similar \nfunds will be recruited by MINFAL subject to the approval of ADB. Given the innovative nature \nof the ASF in supporting agribusiness development, ASF applications will initially be restricted to \ndevelop  experience  in  the  effective  appraisal  and  processing  of  applications.  The  phased \nexpansion of ASF operations will be reflected in staff recruitment.  \n \n \n \n6. \nThe ASF management will be responsible for finalizing the work plan, standard operating \nprocedures,  and  recipient  and  service  eligibility  criteria;  and  for  recruiting  ASF  staff.  Three \nnational  financial  analysts,  who  will  each  be  responsible  for  a  portfolio  of  applications  and \ngrants,  will  support  the  manager.  Additional  financial  analysts  and  technical  specialists  will  be \nemployed as required based on the volume and type of applications received. Financial analysts \nwill  primarily  be  responsible  for  the  initial  screening  and  review  of  funding  applications  and \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  projects  and  activities  supported  by  the  ASF.  An  appraisal \npanel will be established within the ASF to appraise all applications for ASF funding. The ASF \nmanager  will  chair  the  appraisal  panel,  which  comprise  four  additional  part-time  members \nrecruited  by  the  ASF  manager  and  approved  by  the  board  of  directors.  As  necessary,  the \nappraisal  panel  may  request  the  ASF  to  contract  individuals  from  relevant  private  or  public \nsector institutions as consultants where an expert technical opinion may be required to properly \nevaluate an application. The ASF will also employ a farmer enterprise formation coordinator to \nbe  responsible  for  overseeing  the  operation  of  participating  RSPs  in  implementing  the  farmer \ngroup enterprise formation. A supervision officer will be engaged to monitor and supervise the \nutilization of ASF funds by grant recipients. All ASF staff and facilities will be financed entirely \nfrom the proceeds of the project loan.  \n \n \n \n\nManagement \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n          Appendix 4 \n\n3. \n\nFunding Application Eligibility and Processing \n\n \n \n7. \nAny service that leads to outputs for a new, specifically identified market or that develops \nnew  products  or  adds  value  to  existing  products  will  be  eligible  for  ASF  funding.  Proposals \naimed at increasing production alone will not be eligible. Proposals considered by the ASF staff \nto  have  potentially  serious  environmental  risks  associated  with  their  implementation  will  be \nrequired  to  undertake  an  environmental  assessment.  For  this  purpose,  ASF  staff  will  refer  the \napplicant to the project management unit (PMU), which will engage an appropriate consultant or \nservice provider using project funds allocated for this purpose. Guidelines for use by ASF staff \nin referring proposals for an environmental assessment will be formulated as part of the project \nenvironmental management plan. \n \nAll applicants will be required to identify quantitative or qualitative verifiable outputs that \n8. \nwill result from the receipt of ASF support, and the means of verification, both of which will be \nagreed with the ASF prior to disbursement of a grant. ASF grants will in general be subject to a \nceiling of $25,000 equivalent (representing a total cost for the service to be funded of $50,000). \nIn  exceptional  circumstances  where  benefits  are  widespread  or  where  multiplier  effects  are \nobvious (for instance for private sector research and extension), the ASF will provide grants in \nexcess of this amount. All applications for grants in excess of the $25,000 ceiling will require the \napproval of the board of directors. An individual enterprise will be eligible to receive more than \none grant but the maximum amount payable to a single recipient will be $100,000.  \n \n9. \nFunding  proposals  will  be  submitted  in  standard  application  forms  to  the  ASF  either \ndirectly by the applicant or through project implementation agencies. In the latter case, the role \nof such agencies will be restricted to supporting applicants in the application process. They will \nnot  be  permitted  to  act  as  intermediaries  or  representatives  for  applicants  with  the  ASF,  or \nparticipate  in  the  management  or  implementation  of  activities  supported  by  an  ASF  grant. \nApplications  will  be  handled  strictly  on  a  first-come,  first-served  basis.  ASF  financial  analysts \nunder supervision of the ASF manager will undertake an initial review of each application and \nprepare  necessary  documentation  relating  to  eligible  applications  for  submission  to  the \nappraisal  panel.  The  appraisal  panel  will  meet  on  a  monthly  basis  as  a  minimum,  or  more \nfrequently as determined by the ASF manager according to the number of applications received. \nThe  appraisal  panel  will  reach  a  decision  on  each  application  presented  to  its  meeting  but  in \ncertain  circumstances  may  request  additional  information  to  evaluate  properly  an  application. \nThe decision of the panel on all applications will be final.  \n \nOnce an application has been approved, a funding agreement will be drawn up between \n10. \nthe  ASF  and  the  grant  recipient,  who  will  be  required  to  demonstrate  the  availability  of  the \nmatching  contribution.  Based  on  recipient  preference,  grants  will  be  paid  either  on  a \nreimbursable basis once satisfactory documentation detailing eligible expenditures by the grant \nrecipient has been received and approved by the ASF, or in advance of such expenditures on \ncondition  that  the  recipient  provides  a  bank  or  personal  guarantee  in  favor  of  ASF  for  the \namount of the grant on terms and conditions acceptable to ASF. Where the service in question \nis to be provided over an extended period in clearly identified separate phases, funding will be \npaid in an appropriate number of tranches. As part of the funding agreement between the ASF \nand the grant recipient, the recipient will undertake to provide ASF management on request with \nall  documentation  relating  to  the  use  of  ASF  funds,  including  information  relating  to  the \nverification  of  outputs  from  the  employment  of  the  funded  service  as  identified  in  the  funding \napplication.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4        \n\n33\n\nFor the ASF farmer group enterprise formation program, the ASF manager will prepare \n11. \neligibility  criteria  for  participating  RSPs  for  approval  by  the  ASF  board.  Potential  RSPs  will  be \nrequired  to  prepare  a  proposal  for  use  of  ASF  funds  specifying  details  of  their  farmer\u2019s \nenterprise  formation  program,  the  number  of  participating  farmers,  the  type  of  agribusiness \nactivities to be supported, funding requirements, and potential outputs. Subject to the review of \nthe  proposal  and  eligibility  criteria,  the  ASF  manager  will  identify  potential  participating  RSPs \nand  determine  their  eligibility  according  to  the  agreed  criteria.  Selection  of  participating  RSPs \nwill be subject to approval of the ASF board of directors. The ASF will enter into an agreement \nwith  each  RSP  outlining  the  scope  of  service  to  be  provided,  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of \nboth the RSP and ASF, and financing arrangements. The activities and utilization of ASF funds \nby each RSP will be coordinated and monitored by an ASF staff member specifically assigned \nto this task. \n\n12. \nThe  ASF  will  prepare  quarterly  activity  and  status  reports  and  financial  statements  for \nsubmission  to  the  PMU,  MINFAL,  and  ADB.  It  will  also  be  subject  to  a  semiannual  audit  by \nindependent  auditors  to  ADB.  Audited  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  MINFAL  and \nADB.  The  ASF  board  of  directors  will  also  establish  an  audit  committee  consisting  of  at  least \nthree directors to oversee ASF financial and operational management, and the audit process. \n\nD. \n\nASF Promotion \n\n13. \nEffective promotion of the ASF will be critical to its success. Under the supervision of the \nASF manager, consultants will develop a promotion campaign to disseminate the ASF concept, \nobjectives,  application  procedures,  and  eligibility  criteria  among  relevant  public  and  private \nsector  institutions.  One  person-month  of  international  and  three  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultant  inputs  will  be  engaged  to  prepare  a  promotion  campaign  once  the  ASF  is \nincorporated  and  the  manager  appointed.  The  international  consultant  will  work  with  the  ASF \nmanager  to  design  the  promotion  campaign  and  identify  target  audiences.  The  consultant  will \nalso  design  an  ASF  website,  road  shows,  and  workshops.  Domestic  consultants  will  be \nemployed  to  develop  and  implement  the  website  and  support  the  ASF  manager  in  the \npreparation of inaugural road shows and workshops. The ASF manager with the support of ASF \nstaff will be responsible for replicating road shows and workshops in the provinces and special \nareas, and, as necessary, to replicate them on an annual basis. ASF administrative staff will be \nprovided with basic training in managing and updating the ASF web site.  \n \nE. \n \n14. \nThe  impact  of  the  funds  provided  by  the  ASF  to  agribusiness  enterprises  will  be \nassessed  through  the  development  and  implementation  of  a  performance  measurement \nframework  based  on  experience  in  similar  projects,  and  following  guidelines  developed  by  the \nSmall Enterprise Education and Promotion Network. The framework will monitor indicators such \nas  increases  in  output  quantity  and  quality,  increases  in  revenue  and  decreases  in  costs, \nvolume of produce marketed domestically, export growth and import substitution with associated \nforeign  exchange  earnings,  new  markets  penetrated  and  increased  share  in  existing  markets, \nemployment  generated,  new  business  relationships  established,  and  new  enterprises  created \nand their survival rate. The impact assessment will be undertaken by monitoring and evaluation \nconsultants assigned to the PMU based on surveys of a sample of enterprises supported, and \nmore in-depth case studies. \n \n\nASF Impact Assessment \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n          Appendix 4 \n\nF. \n\nProject Support to ASF \n\n15. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  ASF  with  a  fund  of  $13.9  million  equivalent  from  loan \nproceeds  to  (i)  finance  successful  grant  applications  and  operate  the  ASF;  (ii)  recruit  an  ASF \nmanager for the duration of the Project; (iii) engage consulting services for ASF promotion; (iii) \nprocure vehicles, office equipment, and information technology equipment and related software; \n(iv)  finance  the  costs  of  ASF  staff,  the  appraisal  panel,  and  a  fund  to  finance  unspecified \nconsultant  advice  to  the  appraisal  panel  to  assess  specialized  grant  applications;  and  (v) \nfinance  the  costs  of  ASF  operation,  including  office  rental,  office  supplies,  communications, \ntravel,  ongoing  promotion,  and  report  preparation  and  dissemination  (including  semiannual \naudits). \n \nConsulting services will be engaged in accordance with ADB  Guidelines on the Use of \n16. \nConsultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method. Vehicles and office equipment \nwill be procured on the basis of local competitive bidding in accordance with ADB Guidelines for \nProcurement. \n \n17. \nOnce  the  ASF  is  incorporated,  it  will  enter  into  a  project  agreement  with  ADB  and  a \nperformance  agreement  with  MINFAL  setting  out  the  responsibilities  of  the  ASF  under  the \nProject.  The  ASF  will  open  two  accounts  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  one  for \npayment  of  grants,  and  one  for  payment  of  ASF  operating  costs.  The  initial  deposit  into  the \ngrant account will be based on the proposed program of grant financing to be made during the \nfirst  6  months  of  ASF  operations.  Subsequent  deposits  into  the  account  will  be  made  on  a \nsemiannual basis to cover targeted grant amounts for the coming 6 months. The initial deposit \ninto  the  ASF  operating  account  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  costs  of  procuring  vehicles  and \nequipment, and the first 6 months of ASF operating cost. Subsequent deposits into the account \nwill be made on a 6 monthly basis. Requests for replenishment of both accounts signed by the \nASF  manager  and  two  representatives  of  the  board  of  directors  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  and \ncopied to MINFAL, in accordance with procedures specified in the project agreement between \nthe ASF and ADB. \n \n18. \nFor  the  farmers\u2019  enterprise  formation  program,  the  ASF  will  provide  funds  to  individual \nparticipating  RSPs  on  the  basis  of  the  programs  specified  in  their  prospective  implementation \nproposals. An initial payment will be made to cover the first 6 months\u2019 activities with subsequent \ndisbursements made semiannually.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5        \n\n35\n\nAGRIBUSINESS FINANCE DEVELOPMENT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n1. \nWhile lending to agriculture is increasing, in terms of the overall level of demand market \npenetration is limited. A financing gap of almost PRs167 billion ($2.8 billion) has been identified. \nCommercial banks that claim to have embarked on agriculture and agribusiness credit tend to \nrestrict  lending  to  financing  of  seasonal  production  (70\u201375%  of  all  loans)  with  the  balance  for \ndevelopment lending. Development lending is itself largely limited to on-farm investments such \nas tractors, tube wells, and farm equipment. Lending to agribusiness, other than for large-scale \nfood and beverage enterprises, is almost nonexistent. At the lower end of the market, potential \nsources  of  financing  include  recently  established  formal  microfinance  institutions  and  rural \nsupport programs offering credit services, although the loan ceilings and relative inexperience of \nthese  institutions  (especially  in  agribusiness  lending)  limit  the  type  and  size  of  enterprise  that \nthey are able to serve. Therefore, a substantial gap remains in the financing of agribusinesses \nthat operate on a scale between the large-scale enterprises served by commercial banks, and \nmicroenterprises  that  may  be  served  by  microfinance  institutions.  Most  institutions  still  see \nagribusiness  as  a  high  risk  sector  characterized  by  high  historical  levels  of  loan  default.  This, \nand  the  fact  that  many  smaller  scale  agribusiness  enterprises  operate  outside  the  formal \ncommercial  system,  suggests  that  the  solution  to  providing  increased  volumes  of  credit  to \nagribusiness  does  not  lie  in  simply  making  more  funds  available.  The  banking  subsector  in \nPakistan  is  highly  liquid  at  present,  and  the  delivery  of  credit  to  the  private  sector  has  been \nincreasing in recent years. The problem is one of market failure rather than a lack of funding. To \naddress  this  issue,  efforts  need  to  focus  on  (i)  improving  enterprise  creditworthiness  and \nreducing the perceived level of risk faced by financial institutions in lending to agribusiness, and \n(ii) enhancing the capacity of financial institutions to identify agribusiness lending opportunities \nand to appraise and supervise agribusiness loans.  \n \n2. \nDeveloping  financial  sector  policy  and  regulation  and  improving  access  to  credit \ninformation  relating  to  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  already  being  addressed  by \nthe Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program (SMESDP). As the majority of \nagribusinesses to be supported under the proposed Project will be SMEs, further interventions \nin these areas by the Project are not considered necessary. While these steps will establish a \nmore  favorable  environment  for  agribusiness  lending,  the  issue  remains  that  financial \ninstitutions  have  very  little  exposure  to  agribusiness.  The  SMESDP  is  addressing  financial \ninstitutions\u2019  aversion  to  SME  lending  through  the  provision  of  consulting  services  to  enhance \nSME lending capacity and a partial credit guarantee (PCG) facility to address credit risk, thereby \nacting  as  a  catalyst  to  the  development  of  new  financial  products  for  SMEs  and  leveraging \nfinancial institutions\u2019 existing funds to expand lending to SMEs. The SMESDP interventions are \nsupervised by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) because it has experience in this area and can \nact  more  independently  than  a  government  ministry  to  expedite  project  activities.  The  Project \nwill  adopt  a  similar  approach  by  providing  capacity-building  support  for  participating  financial \ninstitutions  (PFIs)  encouraging  them  to  expand  lending  to  agribusiness,  supervised  by  SBP. \nFinancial  institutions  eligible  for  the  PCG  will  also  be  supported  to  enable  them  to  access  the \nfacility for agribusiness lending.  \n \nWhile  support  for  capacity  building  to  increase  the  supply  of  agribusiness  finance  is \n3. \nclearly needed on the demand side, agribusiness support fund enterprise capacity building will \nenhance  the  technical,  managerial,  financial,  and  marketing  skills  of  potential  borrowers.  By \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n          Appendix 5 \n\naddressing  the  perception  among  management  of  financial  institutions  that  agribusiness \npractitioners  are  not  well  qualified,  the  Project's  agribusiness  support  fund  will  complement \nactivities in agribusiness finance development. \n \nB. \n\nAgribusiness Finance Capacity Building \n\n4. \nThe Project will provide support in two phases, first in awareness building, and second, \nin  customized  consulting  services  for  PFIs  in  agribusiness  finance.  Given  concerns  over \nconfidentiality and conflict of interest, all contact with financial institutions will be conducted in-\nhouse. Therefore, seminars or workshops with participants from multiple financial institutions will \nnot  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  awareness  building  campaign.  SBP  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency  for  this  component.  It  will  be  responsible  for  selecting  and  recruiting  consultants  and \nmonitoring  their  performance  (through  the  use  of  international  consultants),  defining  PFI \neligibility  criteria,  disbursing  project  funds  for  payment  of  consultants,  and  preparing  accounts \nand  reports  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  on  the  implementation  of  the  agribusiness \nfinance capacity-building component. \n \n\n1. \n\nAwareness Building \n\n \n5. \nThe  first  phase  will  involve  the  identification  of  private  sector  financial  institutions \n(predominantly commercial banks but possibly leasing companies) that have already developed \nor express an interest in SME or agribusiness lending. During project preparation, 14 financial \ninstitutions  were  consulted,  of  which  8  commercial  banks  and  2  microfinance  institutions \nexpressed an interest in increasing their lending to agribusiness with project assistance.1 Some \nof the banks are already seeking to increase their lending products to small-scale agribusiness, \nand are prepared to submit business development plans that could be supported by the Project. \nA senior financial or banking consultant will be contracted for 3 person-months to undertake this \nphase.  The  consultant  will  make  a  series  of  presentations  to  senior  management  of  selected \nfinancial  institutions  to  build  their  awareness  of  the  agribusiness  subsector  as  a  potential \nmarket,  and  to  discuss  broad  proposals  relating  to  developing  a  strategy  and  approach  to \nestablishing  or  expanding  agribusiness  lending.  The  consultant,  in  collaboration  with  SBP,  will \nidentify a shortlist of financial institutions each of which will prepare a detailed strategy and work \nplan  for  introducing  and  expanding  agribusiness  lending.  Based  on  the  assessment  by  the \nawareness-building  consultants,  in  collaboration  with  appropriate  project  staff  and  SBP,  of  the \neligibility,2 level of commitment of each PFI, and the quality of their proposed lending strategy, \n3\u20135 PFIs will be selected to receive customized capacity-building support. The level of support \nprovided to each PFI will be dependent upon the PFI\u2019s perceived needs. Subject to the financial \ninstitution  impact  monitoring  experience  of  SBP,  the  awareness-building  consultant  will  also \nprovide  advice  to  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultants  of  the  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  on  appropriate  agribusiness  finance  development  impact  monitoring  indicators  to  be \nincluded in the project performance monitoring system.  \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Fourteen potential PFIs were consulted during loan processing, including commercial banks, microfinance banks, \nleasing  companies,  and  nongovernment  organizations  providing  microcredit  services.  Four  of  these  were  not \nconsidered eligible or appropriate, but the remainder expressed strong interest in participating in the Project both to \nbuild their awareness of agribusiness lending, and to receive customized in-house capacity building to establish an \nagribusiness lending function. \n\n2   The consultant in collaboration with SBP will establish PFI eligibility criteria. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5        \n\n37\n\n2. \n\nCapacity Building \n\n \n6. \nThe  capacity-building  phase  will  assist  each  selected  PFI  to  refine  its  agribusiness \nfinance  strategy  and  business  plan;  identify  market  opportunities;  design  appropriate  financial \nproducts; establish lending targets; and prepare necessary operating procedures and manuals, \nloan  supervision  and  recovery  mechanisms,  and  monitoring  and  management  information \nsystems in the context of the PFI\u2019s existing procedures and systems. For this purpose, a PFI will \nhave  access  to  customized  consulting  support  to  be  provided  by  the  Project.  Separate \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  for  each  PFI  during  the  first  project  year  to  avoid  concerns  over \nconflict  of  interest  and  confidentiality.  Consultants  for  capacity  building  will  be  engaged  on \nperformance-based contracts in which performance targets and associated verifiable indicators \nwill  be  agreed  for  such  criteria  as  loan  portfolio  quality,  loan  product  viability,  recovery \nperformance, outreach, and staff training. A tripartite agreement between the PFI, consultants, \nand SBP acceptable to ADB will be finalized to define the role and responsibilities of each party. \nThe agreement will also specify conditions for continuation or curtailment of consulting services \naccording to regular performance reviews. \n \n7. \nEach  PFI  consultant  will  establish  and  operate  an  agribusiness  lending  unit.  Lending \nauthority for all loans disbursed will remain with the PFI. While the consultants will not have a \nright  to  veto  the  approval  of  a  loan,  the  consultant  will  be  entitled  to  formally  register  an \nobjection to the decision that will be taken into account in assessing performance. At the end of \nthe  capacity-building  period  each  PFI  will  have  a  commercially  viable  agribusiness  loan \nportfolio,  and  appropriately  qualified  and  experienced  staff  that  can  expand  its  agribusiness \nlending.  The  capacity  building  will  also  include  support,  as  appropriate,  to  assist  each  PFI  in \nmeeting  the  eligibility  criteria  for  participation  in  the  PCG  facility  established  under  the \nSMESDP.3  The  agribusiness  finance  capacity  building  under  the  Project  is  designed  to \ncomplement the capacity building component of the SMESDP.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPerformance Monitoring \n\n \n8. \nA further 3 person-months of international consulting input have been included to allow \nfor  semiannual  performance  reviews,  in  years  3\u20135  of  the  Project,  to  monitor  progress  in \nagribusiness  lending  by  supported  PFIs,  and  to  identify  additional  potential  PFIs  for  capacity-\nbuilding support. The performance reviews will determine the extent to which consultants have \nmet  the  targets  established  in  the  agreement  with  the  PFI  and  recommend  future  action  that \nmay include continuation or expansion of consulting inputs, financial penalties, or cancellation of \nthe agreement. The PMU  monitoring and evaluation consultants will monitor the  impact of the \ndevelopment  of  the  PFIs\u2019  agribusiness  finance  activity  upon  agribusiness  enterprises  financed \nand  the  agribusiness  subsector,  using  guidelines  established  by  the  awareness-building \nconsultant in consultation with SBP. \n \nC. \n\nAccess to the SMESDP PCG Facility \n\n9. \nIn the SMESDP, ADB established a PCG facility to act as a catalyst to expand lending to \nthe SME sector. The essence of the scheme is to provide  a market-based mechanism, rather \nthan the now discredited credit line approach, to leverage existing financial sector resources for \nSME  lending,  and  in  doing  so  to  build  capacity  among  financial  institutions.  The  PCG  will \n\n                                                 \n3   Further details of the structure and  operation procedures  of the PCG facility  are  provided in Appendix 9 of ADB. \n2003.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\n          Appendix 5 \n\noperate initially with two international commercial banks, and based on experience and subject \nto meeting eligibility criteria and due diligence, domestic financial institutions will also be able to \naccess  the  facility.  The  project  PFIs  will  also  be  able  to  submit  agribusiness  loans  within  the \nportfolio of loans to be covered by the PCG, providing the concerned PFIs have both received \nagribusiness  finance  capacity  building  by  the  Project,  and  meet  eligibility  criteria  for  the  PCG. \nThe  Project  will  thus  capitalize  on  the  experience  gained  under  the  SMESDP  in  operating  the \nPCG.  Agribusiness  enterprises  receiving  project  support  will  predominantly  be  SMEs,  and  are \ntherefore  expected  to  meet  the  SME  eligibility  criteria  as  defined  in  the  SMESDP  for  PCG-\nbacked lending. \n \nD. \n\nProject Support for Agribusiness Finance Development \n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  development  of  agribusiness  finance  with  consulting \n10. \nservices for (i) awareness building; (ii) customized capacity building in 3\u20135 PFIs; (iii) monitoring \nconsultants\u2019 performance in operating agribusiness lending activities in PFIs; and (iv) financing \nthe management and administration costs of operating an agribusiness finance unit in each PFI, \nincluding  office  rental,  office  supplies,  communications,  travel,  and  report  preparation  and \ndissemination. The hiring and appointment of consultants during implementation will be flexible, \nand based on the demand of the PFIs. \n \nGiven  that  experience  in  Pakistan  in  lending  to  agribusiness  enterprises  is  limited,  all \n11. \nconsultants  are  expected  to  be  recruited  internationally.  All  consultants  will  be  contracted  by \nSBP  subject  to  approval  by  ADB,  and  in  the  case  of  the  capacity-building  consultants,  the \napproval of the PFI in which they will work, in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  Consultants  for  awareness  building  and  performance  monitoring  will  be  engaged \nas  part  of  a  single  contract  package  using  the  quality-  and  cost-  based  selection  method. \nConsultants engaged for capacity building will be engaged in separate contract packages using \nthe  quality-based  selection  method.  Each  participating  PFI  will  be  required  to  finance  the \nthe \nmanagement  and  administration  costs  associated  with  developing  and  operating \nagribusiness lending function. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6          39 \n\nAGRIBUSINESS POLICY AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT \n\nAgribusiness Policy Development \n\nA. \n \nOne  of  the  constraints  highlighted  in  project  preparation  workshops  and  stakeholder \n1. \nfeedback  was  the  lack  of  a  central  or  federal  agribusiness  policy  and  provincial  horticultural \npolicies.  The  direction  and  stability  of  the  policy  environment  is  important  to  both  existing  and \npotential  agribusinesses.  Any  policy  must  provide  stability  and  an  effective  and  realistic  time \nhorizon.  The  policies  will  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  encouraging  and  facilitating \nsustainable agribusiness development and horticultural production. \n  \n\n1. \n\nNational Agribusiness Policy Background and Rationale \n\n \n2. \nA national agribusiness policy is required to (i) promote and encourage enterprise start-\nup and expansion, value chain integration, and product specialization; and (ii) determine ways \nto incorporate the informal sector into the agribusiness mainstream. The agribusiness subsector \nrequires  support  in  a  number  of  ways  including  (i)  incentives  for  company  start-ups;  (ii) \nenterprise zones in areas with a product-based comparative advantage; (iii) government support \nfor  achieving  value  chain  integration  through  outgrower  schemes;  (iv)  fast  track  export \nfacilitation  and  standards  readiness,  (v)  measures  to  incorporate  the  informal  sector  into \nmainstream  agribusiness,  so  that  small  agribusinesses  can  benefit  from  the  opportunities  that \nexist  in  the  market  place;  (vi)  and  a  review  of  taxation  regulations  on  horticultural  products, \nparticularly fruit juices. The country will require an agribusiness policy at the macro level so that \nall stakeholders in the country are aware of their responsibilities and obligations.  \n \n3. \nTask Force. A policy will be formulated utilizing the services of a task force, nominated \nby  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  approved  by  the  project  steering  committee.  The \nagribusiness task force will be constituted with both private and public sector members, with a \nmaximum of two  members nominated from each sector and an international advisor acting as \nchairperson. The members will be provided with an honorarium, per diem, and travel allowance \nfor the time spent working with the task force. To prepare the policy, the task force will gauge \nthe  views  of  all  stakeholders  within  the  sector  over  4  months,  through  formal  and  informal \ndiscussions, and workshops.  The purpose of the agribusiness policy will be to (i) establish the \ndefinition and vision of agribusiness; (ii) determine institutional involvement and capabilities; (iii) \nprepare aims and objectives that include subsectors and products for growth and prioritization; \n(iv)  delineate  the  focus  of  Government  support  through  policy  reforms  and  targeted \nfor  an  enabling  agribusiness \ninterventions,  policy  stability  measures,  and  safeguards \nenvironment;  (v)  address  and  identify  demand-side  agribusiness  concerns  including  the \nbusiness environment, required taxation regulation review, tax incentives, access to credit, and \ncompetitiveness;  (vi)  prepare  an  action  plan  for  implementing  the  strategy,  identifying  key \nindicators or targets and time horizons; (vii) identify measures to attain policy consistency and \ncommitment; and (viii) identify other priority issues. \n \n4. \nDeveloping  an  Agribusiness  Policy.  The  policy  will  be  developed  over  a  year.  In \nchronological  order  the  activities  include  (i)  task  force  identification  and  constitution,  (ii) \nstakeholder discussions and policy preparation, (iii) policy submission, (iv) policy feedback and \nreview  by  key  stakeholders,  and  (v)  policy  and  action  plan  approval  by  government  within  18 \nmonths from project start-up.  \n \n5. \nConsulting Services. The PMU will recruit an international agribusiness policy advisor. \nThe advisor will be mobilized within the first 3 months of the implementation period for 6 person-\n\n \n\n\f40          Appendix 6 \n\nmonths.  The  advisor  will  have  expertise  in  policy  formulation  with  experience  in  agribusiness \npolicy and regulatory frameworks. The advisor will  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\ndetermine  the  scope  of  work  for  the  development  of  an  agribusiness  policy  in \nconsultation with the project director; \nassist the PMU in recommending the complement and profile of the agribusiness \npolicy task force, and preparing the task force member\u2019s terms of reference; \nmanage the task force and be its chairperson to achieve its objective of preparing \nthe  draft  policy,  and  present  the  policy  for  review  and  approval  to  the \nGovernment, and if necessary refine the policy further; \nensure that all stakeholders are consulted when preparing the policy; and \nliaise  with  the  national  horticulture  policy  consultant  to  ensure  that  the \nhorticultural  policies  and  the  agribusiness  policy  are  consistent  with  each  other \nregarding the overall strategy objectives. \n\n2. \n\nProvincial  and  Special  Area  Horticultural  Policies  Background  and \nRationale \n\n6. \nHorticulture and its products are generally regarded as a minor subsector. Horticulture is \nnot  considered  an  industry,  and  is  not  given  due  priority  and  emphasis  as  a  potential  income \ngenerator  in  rural  areas.  Horticulture  production,  and  cropping  profiles  and  seasons  vary \nbetween areas; each province and special area is distinct and needs its own policy tailored to its \nagro  climate,  cropping,  and  production  profiles.  The  Pakistan  Horticulture  Development  and \nExport Board already has the mandate to help formulate and implement the national horticulture \npolicy, which is in the process of preparation.  \n \n7. \nProvincial  and  special  area  policy  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  (i)  promotion  of  greater \nparticipation of the private sector, and the convergence of programs and projects implemented \nby  various  developmental  agencies  and  government  departments;  (ii)  policy  definition  and \nvision;  (iii)  institutional  involvement  and  capabilities;  (iv)  aims  and  objectives  that  include \nsubsectors  and  products  for  growth,  and  prioritization  based  on  comparative  advantage  and \ninherent  production  and  marketing  skills;  (v)  focus  on  government  support  on  policy  reforms, \nand  targeted  interventions  such  as  policy  stability  measures  and  safeguards  to  create  an \nenabling horticultural subsector environment; (vi) preparation of an action plan for implementing \nthe strategy, with key indicators or targets specified with time horizons; and (vii) determination of \nrequired institutional support and legislation. \n \n8. \nTask Force. The Project will establish provincial and special area policy task forces to \nliaise  with  the  Pakistan  Horticulture  Development  and  Export  Board  to  develop  horticultural \npolicies in Balochistan, Punjab, and Sindh provinces, and special areas; and review the North-\nWest Frontier Province policy that has been prepared and is still in the process of being revised. \nProvincial  and  special  area  horticultural  task  forces  will  consist  of  five  members,  two \nrepresentatives from the public sector, and three from the private sector (which may include a \nmember from the Pakistan Horticulture Development and Export Board).  \n \n9. \nConsulting Services. The PMU will recruit a national horticulture policy advisor who will \nbe mobilized within the first 6 months of project implementation for two assignments of 10.5 and \n3.5  person-months  in  the  first  2  years  of  the  Project.  The  advisor  will  have  expertise  in  policy \nformulation with particular experience in horticultural policy. The advisor will  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6          41 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\ndetermine the scope of work for the development of provincial and special area \nhorticultural policies;  \nassist the PMU in recommending the complement and profile of the horticultural \npolicy task forces, and preparing the task force members' terms of reference; \nmanage the task forces to achieve their objectives of preparing the draft policy, \nand  present  the  policies  to  the  implementing  and  executing  agencies,  and  the \nprovincial and special area governments; \nensure that all stakeholders are consulted when preparing the policies; and \nliaise  with  the  international  agribusiness  policy  consultant  to  harmonize  the \nhorticultural  policies  with  the  agribusiness  policy  regarding  the  overall  strategy \nobjectives. \n\n \nEnabling Environment Development and International Standards Compliance \n\nB. \n\n1. \n\nBackground and Rationale \n\nDuring  1994,  Pakistan  signed  a  number  of  agreements  with  the  World  Trade \n10. \nOrganization  (WTO)  that  relate  partly  or  wholly  to  food,  agriculture,  and  livestock.  The \nagreements  included  the  agreements  on  agriculture,  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures \n(SPS),  technical  barriers  to  trade,  and  trade-related  intellectual  property  rights.  Pakistan  as  a \nsignatory is committed to implement and become compliant with these agreements. \n\n11. \nDeveloped  countries  have  prepared  and  enforced  stringent  standards  and  quality \nrequirements  for  all  foodstuffs,  in  accordance  with  SPS  and  technical  barriers  to  trade,  to \ncounter  the  import  of  substandard  poor  quality  food  and  ingredients.  Countries  that  export  to \ndeveloped, and even developing markets, have to comply with, and harmonize their standards \naccordingly.  Implementation  of  the  agreements  and  conformity  with  standards  is  not  an  easy \ntask. However, if Pakistan\u2019s food exports do not comply with the new standards, they will lose \ntheir traditional markets as regulations become more stringent. Existing laws that are relevant to \nWTO agreements need to be amended, and capacity and knowledge of the agreements for all \nplayers  in  the  agribusiness  subsector  needs  to  be  strengthened.  To  comply  with  the  SPS \nagreement  the  Government  is  in  the  process  of  amending  a  number  of  laws  and  acts  before \nWTO regime enforcement.1  \n\n2. \n\nProject Support \n\n12. \nThe  Project  will  provide  assistance  in  a  number  of  areas  to  strengthen  the  regulatory \nframework, and international compliance and certification. Activities will include (i) assisting the \nWTO  cell  in  the  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock  (MINFAL)  to  expedite  the \namendment  of  the  laws  and  acts  related  to  the  WTO  agreements;  (ii)  collating  and \ndisseminating international standards information to the relevant stakeholders in both the private \nand  public  sectors,  through  the  Project's  capacity-building  component;  (iii)  coordinating  with \nother  trade  related,  WTO  capacity-building  projects  in  MINFAL,  Ministry  of  Commerce,  and \nMinistry  of  Industry  to  avoid  duplication  of  activities;  and  (iv)  helping  strengthen  and  promote \nimproved food standards, and hazard analysis critical control point certification. The Project will \n\n                                                 \n1  (i)  Pakistan  Plant  Quarantine  Act  (1976),  (ii)  Federal  Seed  Certification  Act  (1976),  (iii)  Agricultural  Produce \n(Grading  &  Marketing)  Act  (1937),  and  (iv)  Pakistan  Animal  Quarantine  (Import  &  Export  of  Animals  and  their \nProducts) Act (1985). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f42          Appendix 6 \n\nrecruit  a  national  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  advisor  to  the  PMU  for  the  first  3  project \nyears  to  work  closely  with  the  PMU  project  director  and  advise  on  policy  institutional  and \nregulatory  framework  issues  that  affect  agribusiness.  The  advisor  will  assist  the  regulatory \nframework and compliance specialist to bring about necessary amendments in laws to conform \nwith WTO regulations and agreements relating to agribusiness. \n\n \n13. \nConsulting  Services.  The  Project  will  identify  and  field  an  international  consultant  to \nassist with legal framework amendments, preparation of awareness seminars, and elaboration \nof an action plan for MINFAL to align with international standards. The consultant will be fielded \nin  the  first  project  year  for  3  months.  The  consultant  will  have  expertise  in  trade  policy, \ninternational  standards  compliance,  and  the  WTO  Agreement  on  Agriculture,  SPS/technical \nbarriers  to  trade,  and  trade-related  intellectual  property  rights,  and  will  be  selected  by  ADB  in \nconsultation with MINFAL. The consultant will  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nwork  under  the  direct  supervision  of  the  PMU,  and  with  the  project  policy, \ninstitutional, and regulatory specialist; \nassess the existing situation with regard to the country\u2019s international regulatory \nframework,  and  alignment  with  the  WTO  agreements  that  affect  agriculture  and \nagribusiness; \nin conjunction with the WTO-related agencies and offices in MINFAL, assess the \nlegal  framework  recommendations  put  forward  by  the  various  government \ndepartments, and make necessary recommendations; \nin  relation  to  (iii),  develop  the  necessary  legal  framework  amendments  for \npresentation to the Government; \nreview the progress made regarding other trade and WTO awareness programs \nin other ministries; \non  the  basis  of  the  consultant's  international  regulations  and  standards \nexperience,  develop  a  series  of  awareness  seminars  to  provide  training  to  the \nproject  stakeholders  on  WTO  requirements,  international  standards,  and  the \neffects of noncompliance and harmonization in respect of Pakistan\u2019s international \ntrade prospects; \ndevelop  an  action  plan  for  MINFAL  to  follow  to  harmonize  standards  and  to \nbecome internationally compliant, and recommend how to improve enforcement; \ndetermine the mechanism in which Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group Good \nAgriculture  Practices,  and  hazard  analysis  critical  control  point  certification  can \nbe promoted within the country, identifying possible service providers that could \noffer registration and certification to the agribusiness subsector; and \n\n(ix)  make  recommendations  for  project  interventions  to  improve  the  regulatory \n\nframework, and its harmonization with other countries. \n\nMINFAL Departmental Coordination \n\n1. \n\nBackground and Rationale \n\nThe country has no agribusiness coordination. There is a WTO cell in the economic wing \n14. \nof  MINFAL.  The  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Livestock  Product  Marketing  and  Grading  has \nthe  responsibility  for  providing  market  information,  and  product  uniformity  and  quality  through \ngrading standards. WTO activities need to be better coordinated by institutional restructuring. \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6          43 \n\n2. \n\nProject Support \n\n15. \nThe  policy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  specialist  recruited  by  the  PMU  for  the  first  3 \nyears  will  help  the  international  institutional  and  restructuring  and  coordination  advisor  by \nundertaking an assessment of the capability and capacity of the relevant MINFAL WTO cells to \nmake  recommendations  regarding  achieving  better  coordination  between  them,  or  possible \nrestructuring measures that need to be undertaken. \n\n \n\nConsulting  Services.  An  international  institutions  institutional  and  restructuring  and \n16. \ncoordination advisor will be recruited, once the national agribusiness policy is drafted in the first \nyear of the Project, for 6 person-months in the first year, and an additional 6 person-months in \nthe second project year. The advisor will improve coordination between agribusiness policy and \ninternational  compliance  recommendations,  and  have  expertise  in  institutional  matters  and \ninterdepartmental coordination. The consultant\u2019s scope of work will include \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nidentify  the  need,  requirements,  and  parameters  for  restructuring  and  reforming \nMINFAL  operations  related  to  agribusiness,  WTO  matters,  prices,  and  produce \nand livestock marketing; \nconduct a workshop with all concerned departments to assess their capabilities, \nconstraints, and linkages; \nassess,  based  on  the  outcome  from  activities  (i)  and  (ii),  the  capacity  of  the \nconcerned  departments,  divisions,  and  cells  to  undertake  their  assigned  tasks, \nand their linkages with other departments; \nanalyze  the  information  collected,  study  comparable  successful  models  and \nexperiences  elsewhere  in  the  world,  and  prepare  an  action  plan  for  improved \ncoordination  between \nconcerned  MINFAL  groups,  and  make \nrecommendations; \nbuild  measures  into  the  action  plans  that  will  improve  organizational  and \noperational efficiency of the concerned departments and cells, and the quality of \ntheir service delivery; and \nin  association  with  the  project  director,  and  relevant  project  staff,  prepare \nrecommendations  for  consideration  by  MINFAL.

Given the \nneed to enhance Pakistan\u2019s agribusiness quality standards to international levels, the innovative \nnature  of  the  Agribusiness  Support  Fund  (ASF),  and  the  Project\u2019s  approach  to  agribusiness \nfinance  development,  a  major  part  of  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  international \nconsultants. A total of 221 person-months of international and 128 person-months of domestic \nconsulting  inputs  will  be  financed  under  the  Project.  A  high  degree  of  flexibility  will  be  written \ninto each consulting contract to allow implementing agencies to recruit consultants according to \nneeds determined as project implementation proceeds. \n\nAgribusiness Finance Development \n\nAgribusiness Support Service Provision \n\nB. \n \nInternational  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  at  the  start  of  project \n2. \nimplementation to prepare and implement a nationwide promotion campaign for the ASF. Given \nthe innovative nature of the ASF within the agriculture sector in Pakistan and the need for sound \ngovernance and management to ensure effective delivery of ASF funding, the ASF manager will \nbe  recruited  as  an  international  consultant  for  the  duration  of  the  Project.  The  consultant  will \ninitially  be  responsible  for  incorporating  and  establishing  the  ASF,  preparing  a  business  plan \nand operating procedures, and coordinating the promotion campaign. Thereafter, the consultant \nwill be responsible for day-to-day management of the ASF and evaluating funding applications. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nSince  the  financing  of  agribusiness  of  the  type  to  be  supported  by  the  Project  is  very \nlimited in Pakistan at present, agribusiness finance development consultants will all be recruited \ninternationally.  The  first  phase  will  involve  a  program  of  awareness  building  within  potential \nparticipating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  to  discuss  with  them  on  a  one-to-one  basis  the \nconstraints  and  opportunities  for  agribusiness  finance  development.  These  discussions  will \nresult  in  the  preparation  of  a  shortlist  of  PFIs  that  demonstrate  a  commitment  to  developing \nagribusiness lending with the support of the Project. From the shortlist, 3\u20135 PFIs will be selected \nfor  the  second,  capacity-building  phase.  In  the  capacity-building  phase,  separate  teams  of \nconsultants  will  work  with  individual  PFIs  to  avoid  issues  of  confidentiality  and  conflict  of \ninterest, and will negotiate individual contracts with the State Bank of Pakistan, and subsidiary \nagreements with the PFI they support. Consultants will review business plans for agribusiness \nfinance development prepared by the selected PFIs. Based on a strategy and work plan (with \nperformance  targets  and  evaluation  criteria)  agreed  with  the  PFI  management,  they  will \nestablish an agribusiness lending unit within the PFI. Consultants will support the unit for up to \n36  months,  during  which  time  they  will  develop  loan  products,  prepare  operating  procedures \nand manuals, and train PFI staff. At the end of the assignment, each PFI will have an operating \nagribusiness finance unit that it can take over and operate itself. The participation of PFIs in the \nProject is expected to be phased over the first 3 years of the Project.  \n \n4. \nThroughout the implementation of the capacity-building phase, independent international \nconsultants will monitor the performance of the international consultants in agribusiness finance \ndevelopment  in  each  PFI,  in  accordance  with  the  targets  agreed  with  each  PFI.  Contracts \nbetween  the  capacity-building  consultants  and  each  PFI  will  stipulate  actions  to  be  taken \ndepending on the results of the performance monitoring review.  \n\n \n\n\f50          Appendix 11 \n\ninformation  on  department \n\ntraining  and  dissemination  of \n\nCapacity Building for Agribusiness \n\nD. \n \n5. \nCapacity  building  in  both  public  and  private  sector  institutions  is  a  priority  to  support \nimplementation  of  the  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  environment,  and  to  move  agribusiness \ntoward  a  more  private  sector  and  market-oriented  approach.  An  international  institutional \nrestructuring  and  coordination  consultant  will  be  engaged  in  the  first  year  of  the  Project  to \nsupport  the  reorganization  of  the  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and  Livestock  to  enable  it  to \nperform  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  new  policies  and  regulatory  framework.  The \nDepartment  of  Agriculture  Livestock  Products  Marketing  and  Grading  will  be  supported  by \ninternational  consultants  in  the  first  year  to  enhance  its  export  certification.  Domestic \nconsultants  employed  intermittently  over  the  first  3  years  of  the  Project  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  staff \nfunctions. \nInternational consultants will be engaged intermittently during the first 3 years to strengthen the \nrole of the Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department in improving seed and fruit \nnursery certification and enforcing germ-plasm standards and uniformity.  \n \nThe Project will implement a significant training of trainers program aimed at upgrading \n6. \nthe capacity of public sector training institutes and private sector providers to deliver training in \nbusiness  management,  technical  skills,  total  quality  management,  and  alignment  with  World \nTrade  Organization  regulations.  Senior  staff  and  lecturers  at  vocational  training  institutes  and \ngovernment commerce colleges will receive training in school management and training delivery \nmethods.  A  combination  of  international  agribusiness  training  curriculum  development  and \nnational curriculum development and training dissemination and coordination consultants will be \nengaged to implement the training program. Curriculum and training program development will \nbe  an  ongoing  exercise  during  the  first  3  years  of  the  Project  to  allow  for  refinement  of  the \ntraining message and delivery mechanisms based on implementation experience. In recognition \nof the potential for floriculture, an international floriculture training consultant will provide training \nto  vocational  training  institute  and  government  commerce  college  staff  and  other  training \nproviders  in  flower  production  and  presentation  for  onward  training  to  flower  growers  and \nprocessors. The consultant will be engaged intermittently during the life of the Project. \n \nE. \n\nPolicy Formulation and Enabling Environment \n\n7. \nInternational  consultants  supported by  task  forces  comprising  public  and  private  sector \nnominees  will  be  engaged  to  develop  a  national  agribusiness  policy  using  a  consultative \napproach with relevant sector stakeholders. Provincial and special area horticulture policies will \nbe developed in a similar way using domestic consultants and public and private task forces. An \ninternational consultant will be employed to develop an agribusiness regulatory framework and \nto  promote  compliance  with  international  quality  standards  among  Pakistan\u2019s  agribusiness \ninstitutions  and  enterprises.  Both  the  agribusiness  and  horticulture  policies  and  regulatory \nframework will be completed in the first year of the Project in order to facilitate implementation \nthereafter. \n \nF. \n \n8. \nAn international consultant with experience of implementing similar projects with diverse \ncomponents  and  activities  will  be  recruited  to  support  the  Ministry  of  Food,  Agriculture,  and \nLivestock in the establishment of the project management unit, provincial project implementation \noffices,  and  project  implementation  procedures  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank \nguidelines. A domestic monitoring and evaluation consultant will be contracted to establish the \nproject  performance  monitoring  system  and  to  assess  project  impact  during  the  life  of  the \n\nProject Management Support \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11          51 \n\nProject.  Starting  in  the  second  year  and  for  the  duration  of  the  Project,  a  domestic \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultant  will  assess  the  environmental  impact  of \nproject-supported interventions. \n \nDomestic consultants will be engaged to undertake two studies identified as priorities for \n9. \nsupporting  agribusiness  development.  These  are  a  competitive  and  comparative  advantage \nstudy  to  identify  horticulture  products  that  may  offer  the  greatest  potential  for  development  in \nPakistan, and a livestock and dairy study to identify potential areas of growth and investment. \n \n10. \nTo  accommodate  unforeseen  consulting  service  needs,  6  months  international  and  12 \nmonths domestic consulting services have been included, but not allocated to any specific area \nor task. These will be available at the discretion of the project management unit to supplement \nconsulting inputs as necessary.  \n \nG. \n \nConsultants  selected  must  have  proven  international  experience  in  relevant  fields  of \n11. \nexpertise  and  prior  exposure  in  South  Asia.  Companies  will  be  eligible  to  bid  for  providing \nconsulting services in more than one of the identified packages. \n \n \n\nProcurement of Consulting Services \n\n \n\n\f52          Appendix 12 \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nto \n\nfailures \n\nThe  Project  seeks  to  support  the  contribution  of  agribusiness  to  economic  growth  and \n1. \nemployment  generation  by  addressing  market \nfacilitate  private-sector-led \nagribusiness  development  throughout  the  agribusiness  product  value  chain,  and  increasing \ninstitutional and market efficiencies by directly linking clients and service providers. This would \nbe  achieved  by  extending  financial  and  technical  capacity-building  support  to  entrepreneurs, \nservice  providers,  financial  institutions,  and  farmers;  and  improving  policy  and  regulatory \nframeworks.  The  Project  is  designed  to  (i)  support  agribusiness  development  to  contribute  to \nrural  growth  and  employment;  (ii)  provide  a  private  sector  focus  for  agricultural  diversification \nand export orientation; (iii) encourage enhanced public-private sector partnerships; (iv) improve \nthe output of agricultural research and extension to make it more demand driven; (v) establish a \nnetwork  of  quality  control  and  certification  laboratories;  and  (vi)  provide  capacity  building  on \nWorld  Trade  Organization  compliance  issues.  The  sector  analysis  in  Appendix  2  provides \ndetails  of  sectoral  constraints  and  issues,  lessons  learned,  and  opportunities  that  provide  the \nbackground for the project justification and analysis. \n \nB. \n\nProject Justification and Benefits \n\n2. \nThe  need  for  the  Project  arises  from  (i)  current  market  failures  leading  to  inadequate \nfinancial  and  technical  support  to  the  private  sector  to  initiate  agribusiness  enterprises,  (ii) \nfailures  in  institutional  capacity,  and  (iii)  the  absence  of  consistent  and  coherent  agribusiness \npolicies. The Project will be a catalyst to improve the contribution of agribusiness to the national \neconomy. It will encourage investment by the private sector in new or upgraded enterprises that \nhave been constrained by limited financial and technical capacity and support. The Project will \nalso  strengthen  institutions  to  formulate  policies  and  implement  a  regulatory  framework  in \ncompliance  with  international  standards.  The  Project  is  designed  to  provide  benefits  to  all \ninvolved  in  the  value  chain,  including  landless  laborers;  fruit,  vegetable,  livestock,  and  dairy \nfarmers;  support  industries;  service  providers;  financiers;  processors;  government  staff;  and \nconsumers.  \n \n3. \nThe  focus  on  strengthening  private  sector  delivery  mechanisms  to  the  agribusiness \nsubsector  throughout  the  value  chain  is  expected  to  (i)  increase  entrepreneurs\u2019  capacity  to \nserve  increasingly  discerning  consumer  preferences,  (ii)  lead  to  greater  responsiveness  of \ninstitutions and market mechanisms to respond to farmers' and entrepreneurs\u2019 needs, and (iii) \nas  a  result  lead  to  increases  in  efficiency  by  reducing  transaction  costs  and  increasing  the \nsupply  of  services  demanded  by  agribusiness  clients.  Key  services  in  this  regard  will  be \nbusiness  development  services, \nfor  agribusiness  development,  agricultural  and \nagribusiness  training,  product  grading  and  marketing,  improved  seed  certification  and  quality, \nand  more  focused  agricultural  research  and  extension.  The  Project  will  improve  the \nagribusiness policy environment, institutional capacity, and service delivery in a comprehensive \nand systematic manner throughout the value chain to ensure that the project goal of supporting \neconomic  growth  and  employment  generation  through  agribusiness  development  is  efficiently, \neffectively, and sustainably achieved. The deficiencies of the existing approaches are outlined in \nAppendix 2. In essence, the Project's approach will assist clients in the value chain to access \nneeded  services  using  market-based  mechanisms,  and  to  improve  their  capacity  to  provide \nhigh-quality, higher-value-added products demanded by domestic and international markets.  \n \n\nloans \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12          53 \n\nThe  private  sector  has  indicated  a  willingness  to  provide  the  services  demanded  by \n4. \nagribusiness  entrepreneurs  (including  farmers),  and  entrepreneurs  the  willingness  to  pay  for \nthese services. The fiscal impact of improved service delivery by the Government in areas such \nas  seed  certification,  product  grading  and  marketing,  regulatory  supervision,  and  policy \ndevelopment and guidance is relatively minor.  \n \n5.  \nThe  Project  will  also  support  improvements  to  ensure  quality  and  continuity  of  uniform \nraw material, without which value addition and marketing activities associated with agribusiness \nwill  not  be  successful.  Farmers  and  raw  material  suppliers  will  not  only  be  supported  through \nagro-enterprise development support and training, but the Project will also support germ-plasm \nimprovement  to  ensure  that  it  is  true  to  type,  uniform,  and  viable.  Development  of  new \nmarketing channels and bringing together stakeholders in the value chain will be promoted by \nencouraging  processors,  packers,  and  distributors  to  work  with  farmer  groups  to  satisfy \ninternational standards and product traceability requirements.  \n \nC. \n\nMethodology \n\n6. \nThe  Project  will  support  a  wide  variety  of  demand-driven  interventions  identified  during \nimplementation. As a result, the likely mix of the scale and types of interventions, and the overall \nproject benefits cannot be accurately ascertained. Therefore, a full-scale cost-benefit analysis is \nconsidered impractical. The analysis is therefore based on a quantitative (financial) assessment \nof  selected  indicative  enterprises  that  could  be  implemented  by  the  private  sector  under  the \nProject, and an estimate of the number of direct and indirect beneficiaries of project support.  \n \nThe  assumptions  employed  in  the  preparation  of  indicative  model  budgets  and  their \n7. \nanalysis  includes  (i)  all  cash  inflows  and  outflows  are  priced  at  constant  mid  2004  prices;  (ii) \nenterprise life is generally assumed as 20 years; (iii) the opportunity cost of capital used is 12%; \n(iv) general sales tax of 15% is applied to all enterprises except for those that are farm-based, \nand 10% income tax is adjusted from revenues; (v) increased production will have insignificant \nimpact  on  the  prices,  as  the  main  benefits  are  qualitative  improvements  and  reduction  of \npostharvest  losses;  and  (vi)  entrepreneurs  will  finance  the  enterprises  themselves.  Model \nbudgets were based on conservative cost and revenue estimates, and are based on the use of \ntraditional  technologies,  rather  than  the  technologies  and  approaches  being  promoted  by  the \nProject. If project interventions are successful and allow producers and entrepreneurs to benefit \nfrom  an  improved  regulatory  framework,  improved  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  service \nprovision,  and  access  to  finance  to  invest  in  improved  and  cost-efficient  processes  and \ntechnologies,  much  higher  returns  can  be  expected  (paras.  15\u201316).  The  detailed  feasibility \nstudies  outline  the  critical  factors  that  need  to  be  monitored  to  ensure  success  of  the \nenterprises.  \n\n \n\nD. \n\nFinancial Analysis of Indicative Model Enterprises \n\n8. \nDetailed crop models were prepared for the major fruit, vegetable, and flower crops; and \nfor milk (cow and buffalo) costs of production were estimated. Most crops and milk production \nwere found to be profitable and sustainable. Indicative agro-enterprises were analyzed for their \nfinancial viability and sensitivity analysis was undertaken. Results are in Table A12.1. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fSwitching Values \n(FIRR 12%) \n\nIncrease \nin Cost \n\nDecrease \nin \nBenefits \n59.6 \n9.5 \n6.4 \n\n54          Appendix 12 \n\nTable A12.1: Summary Financial Analysis \n\n \n \n \nName of Enterprise \n\n \nIndicative \nCapital \nInvestment \n(PRs million) \n\n \nBase Case \nEstimated \nFIRR (%) \n\n5.0  \n\n26.3 \n\n32.0 \n\n12.6 \n\n46.8 \n\n60.5  \n\n14.9  \n\n76.6 \n37.7 \n28.6 \n\n24.0 \n18.2 \n16.8 \n\n10.4 \n2.8 \n13.0 \n\n11.7 \n2.9 \n14.9 \n\n0.3  \n91.7  \n22.7 \n\n29.8  \n18.0  \n16.2  \n\n147.3 \n10.5 \n6.9 \n\nFruit tree nursery production \nLivestock fattening yard \nMilk collection and chilling center \nCool chain distribution and \nmarketing for cut flowers  \nDate processing plant \nMango-packing enterprise \nCold storage enterprise \nVegetable seed production and \nmarketing \nKinnow pack house \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9. \nSeven of the enterprises are highly profitable, and exhibit relatively robust sensitivity to \nchanges  in  benefits  or  costs.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  the  selected \nenterprises  ranges  between  12.3%  and  76.6%.  The  FIRRs  of  vegetable  seed  production  and \nmarketing,  and  kinnow  pack  house  are  just  above  12%.  The  switching  values  for  these  two \nsuggest  that  they  are  high-risk  investments.  Two  enterprises,  milk  collection  and  chilling \ncenters, and mango-packing enterprise have reasonable FIRRs (28.6% and 18.2% respectively) \nbut are sensitive to cost increases and decreases in benefits, and are medium risk investments. \nThe  remaining  five  enterprises,  fruit  nursery  production,  livestock  fattening  yard,  cool  chain \ndistribution  and  marketing  for  cut  flowers,  date  processing  plant,  and  cold  storage  have \nrelatively  attractive  FIRRs,  and  are  not  sensitive  to  cost  increases  or  decreases  in  benefits. \nThey are therefore financially robust and sustainable investments.  \n \nE. \n\nBeneficiaries of Project Support \n\n12.3 \n\n0.1 \n\n0.1 \n\n0.3 \n\n0.3 \n\n10. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  wide  range  of  direct  and  indirect  beneficiaries.  Direct \nbeneficiaries include farmers, landless laborers, market functionaries, processors and their staff \nand  workers,  and  other  related  entrepreneurs.  The  subsector  is  highly  labor  intensive  and \nprovides  employment  to  a  large  number  of  skilled  and  unskilled  workers.  Expansion  in  the \nsubsector and adoption of good practices is expected to foster an increase in labor demand and \ngenerate additional employment. Indirect beneficiaries include consumers, input suppliers, staff \nof government and project-related institutions, and service providers. \n \n\n1. \n\nDirect Beneficiaries \n\n11. \nThe  direct  beneficiaries  during  the  project  life  would  include  male  and  female  faculty \nmembers  of  government  commerce  colleges,  and  vocational  training  institutes,  farmers, \nlandless  laborers,  entrepreneurs,  employees  of  processors  and  packing  plants,  agribusiness \nservice  providers,  and  financiers.  The  Project  will  provide  assistance  to  about  800  trainers  to \nacquire  skills  in  training  farmers  in  integrated  crop  and  pest  management,  and  to  serve  as  a \nresource  for  further  training.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  training  to  500  extension \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12          55 \n\nofficers.  At  the  completion  of  the  Project,  about  25,000  farmers  will  have  been  trained  in \nimproved farm production, integrated crop and pest management, and postharvest technology; \n140  persons  will  acquire  cut  flower  decoration  and  market  presentation  skills;  and  more  than \n3,000  workers  and  entrepreneurs  will  acquire  managerial,  processing,  and  total  quality \nmanagement and international compliance skills; and 40 training institute and college managers \nand principals will be trained in management. An estimated 3,200 staff in federal, provincial, and \nspecial areas government service will be provided with agribusiness awareness training. \n \nThrough the Agribusiness Support Fund (ASF), the Project will support beneficiaries through \n12. \ncost-sharing  grants  for  business  development  support,  agro-enterprise  start-ups,  farmer  group \nenterprise  formation,  demand-driven  research,  private-sector-led  extension  service;  and  help \nbusiness  development  support  providers  to  enhance  their  capacity  in  the  agribusiness  subsector. \nThe estimated grant value of $13.9 million will provide financial leverage of an additional $9.9 \nmillion from grant recipients. The ASF in conjunction with 3\u20135 participating financial institutions \n(PFIs)  will  directly  enhance  agro-enterprise  competitiveness  and  productivity.  This  will  have  a \npositive  impact  on  enterprise  profitability,  and  lead  to  job  security  and  employment.  Following \nthe awareness-raising and capacity-building activities of the PFIs, lending is expected to be at \nleast  five  times  the  amount  leveraged  from  the  ASF.  This  could  benefit  an  additional  10,000 \nagro-enterprises,  and  provide  significant  employment  and  income-generating  opportunities, \nconservatively  estimated  at  100,000  person-years  of  direct  employment,  and  700,000  person-\nyears of indirect employment.  \n \n13. \nIn  trying  to  estimate  the  potential  beneficiaries  from  the  indicative  agro-enterprises  that \nhave  been  analyzed,  the  number  of  potential  beneficiaries  in  the  farming  community  is  high \nwhere enterprises rely on raw materials that are either produced on an intensive scale, or are \nreared  or  cultivated  by  small  farmers.  This  is  particularly  true  in  floriculture,  animal  fattening \nyards,  and  date  processing.  For  the  nine  agro-enterprises  identified,  raw  material  suppliers \ncould  amount  to  about  4,500  growers  or  livestock  farmers.  Based  on  the  amount  of  ASF \nassistance  that  may  be  provided  to  agro-enterprises,  100,000  farmers  may  be  required  to \nprovide products to those enterprises; of those 100,000 farmers, 12,500 will be associated with \nfarmer agribusiness enterprises groups.  \n \n\n2. \n\nIndirect Beneficiaries \n\n14. \nIndirect beneficiaries will include other farmers, who will benefit from certified vegetable \nseed  and  nursery  plants;  consumers  who  will  have  improved  access  to  quality  and  hygienic \nproducts; and service providers, for example, transporters, packing material suppliers, and farm \ninput  and  processing  industry  input  suppliers.  Market  functionaries,  processors,  and  exporters \nwill  benefit  from  qualitative  improvement  in  raw  unprocessed  supplies,  and  confidence  in \ninvestment in improved processing technologies and exploring international markets. \n \nF. \n\nExpected Project Impact \n\n15. \nFor optimum project impact, interventions are tailored toward specialization in a range of \nproducts  to  which  limited  resources  can  be  channeled  to  make  a  significant  impact.  This  will \nlead to vertical integration in the value chain (from the field to the consumer) in production areas \nor  clusters  of  single  or  similar  types  of  products.  The  Project  will  support  specialization  in \nconjunction with quality improvement to achieve greater product comparative advantage.  \n \n16. \nIn  the  medium  term  (within  3  years  of  project  start-up),  an  environment  for  encouraging \nagribusiness  stakeholders  to  invest  in  agribusiness  is  expected  to  be  in  place,  leading  to  more \n\n \n\n\f56          Appendix 12 \n\nmarket outlets through an increase in the number of processing and packing units. Farmers are \nexpected to be able to realize increases in net revenue, especially those who have diversified into \nmore intensive (high-value crop) production. The creation of farmer marketing groups will result in \nimproved  quality  and  packaging  resulting  in  a  minimum  10%  price  premium  on  selected \nproducts. Farmers are expected to be able to realize income increases by minimizing postharvest \nlosses that amount to between 20\u201330% of the value of fruits and vegetables produced each year, \nor 2.7 million tons of products, with an estimated local market value of $522 million. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13          57 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n\n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority  in  country  poverty  partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n\n \nAgriculture  contributes  25%  to  the  gross  domestic  product\u201470%  toward  export  earnings\u2014and  employs  48%  of  the \nlabor  force.  Over  100  million  people,  68%  of  the  population,  live  in  rural  areas,  and  95%  earn  their  livelihood  from \nagriculture,  directly  or  indirectly.  Farmers,  laborers,  producers,  traders,  processors,  exporters,  and  various  service \nproviders will benefit from the development of agro-enterprises promoted by the project components. Agribusiness has \nthe potential to become a much more important source of economic growth and income generation, with small farmers \nas major beneficiaries. \n \nThe  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  signed  in  September  2002  focuses  on  support  for  poverty  reduction  measures.  In  this  agreement,  the \nmedium-term strategy for agriculture and rural development is to \u201cIncrease agricultural productivity and diversification \nthrough  a  move  to  market-based  agricultural  prices  and  expansion  of  the  role  of  the  private  sector.\u201d  The  Project \ncontributes  to  the  medium-term  strategy  as  it  facilitates  the  development  of  private-sector-led  agribusinesses.  The \nproject  interventions  include  (i)  agribusiness  policy  formulation  and  enabling  environment  development,  (ii) \nagribusiness capacity building, (iii) agribusiness support service provision, (iv) agribusiness finance development, and \n(v)  project  management  support  These  interventions  will  promote  production  diversification,  and  investment  in  agro-\nenterprises, contributing to economic growth in the agriculture sector. The creation of an enabling policy environment, \ncapacity  building,  and  the  provision  of  financing  for  agro-enterprises  will  result  in  the  development  of  small  and \nmedium size agro-enterprises, and the creation of employment opportunities in rural areas. \n\nB. \n\n \nPoverty Analysis                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\nPakistan  has  witnessed  a  worsening  poverty  situation  in  recent  years,  particularly,  in  rural  areas  where  39%  of  the \npopulation was living below the official poverty line in 2003. The Pakistan Economic Survey 2003/04 reported a 4.2% \ndecline in poverty based on a small sample survey by the Federal Bureau of Statistics. The total population below the \npoverty  line  was  23%  at  the  national  level,  13.7%  in  urban  areas  and  28.4%  in  rural  areas.  Pakistan\u2019s  human \ndevelopment index score is very low. It was ranked 144th on the Human Development Index with a score of 0.499 in \n2003.  In  2004,  its  rank  improved  to  142nd  but  its  score  on  the  Human  Development  Index  decreased  to  0.497.  The \nindex is based on 2002 data when Pakistan had a life expectancy at birth of 60.7 years; adult literacy was 53.4% for \nmales  and  28.6%  for  females;  and  combined  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  gross  enrolment  ratio  was  43%  for \nmales and 31% for females.  \n\nLow  levels  of  earnings  and  social  vulnerability  due  to  a  lack  of  access  to  health,  education,  water  supply,  and \nsanitation  facilities  characterize  poverty  in  Pakistan.  Lack  of  opportunities,  denial  of  basic  rights,  social  exclusion, \ncorruption, manipulation of regulatory controls, and insecurity also characterize poverty. The poor have few physical \nassets, and rely disproportionately on informal sector jobs. Poverty characteristics include high levels of income and \nasset poverty, economic and social vulnerability, gender disparity, and low levels of human capital development. The \ndistribution of land is highly skewed. The total farm area is 20.4 million hectares and the total number of landowning \nhouseholds is 6.6 million. Nearly 57.6% of the total ownership holdings are smaller than 2 hectares and account for \n15.5% of the total farm area. Only 1.6% of the landholdings are larger than 20 hectares, and account for 21.2% of the \ntotal  farm  area.  Concentration  of  land  owned  by  a  small  number  of  large  landholders  is  impoverishing  because  the \npoor have limited assets with which to work.  \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  reducing  the  incidence  of  poverty  to  below  15%  at  the  completion  of  the  10-Year \nPerspective Development Plan in 2011. The Government is committed to attaining the Millennium Development Goals \nby  2015.  The  economic  growth  rate  was  5.1%  in  FY2003  and  6.4%  in  FY2004,  and  in  the  past  5  years  cumulative \nspending  on  the  social  sector  and  poverty-related  programs  was  over  PRs860  billion.  The  project  components  will \nsupport increased investment in agribusiness production and processing, leading to economic growth that will reduce \npoverty  in  rural  areas.  The  development  of  agro-enterprises  will  contribute  to  economic  expansion,  and  create \nemployment opportunities in both rural and urban areas that will also reduce poverty. \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix  13 \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                \n \nThe  proposed  Project  will  encourage  the  organization  of  small  farmer  groups  to  establish  agro-enterprises.  Some \nnongovernment  organizations,  particularly,  rural  support  programs  (RSPs)  have  initiated  rural  development  activities \nwith  community  participation.  RSPs  organize  small  community  groups,  mobilize  group  resources  to  build  financial \ncapital,  and  provide  training  to  develop  skills  of  its  members.  RSPs  provide  microfinance  services  to  members  of \ncommunity  organizations  without  collateral.  RSPs  can  organize  small  groups  of  farmers  interested  in  enterprise \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  provide  support  to  RSPs  to  organize  specific  training,  and  business  development \nservices needed for agro-enterprise development by small farmers. Agro-enterprise groups would borrow money from \nthe  sponsor  RSPs  for  small  investments,  and  the  Project\u2019s  agribusiness  support  fund  (ASF)  would  match  these \namounts for eligible activities specified in the ASF component. Farmer agro-enterprise groups would not be recipients \nof  project  funds  for  capital  expenditure,  but  would  be  linked  to  the  Project  for  training  and  skills  enhancement. \nSustainability of agro-enterprises is not linked to project support, but to the skills provided to the groups, and the funds \nthat the groups borrow from the RSPs or financiers to operate the enterprise profitably.  \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nGender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen  entrepreneurs  will  have  equal  opportunities  in  establishment  of  agro-enterprises,  and  in  access  to  project \nservices.  Women  are  expected  to  obtain  training  and  employment  in  agro-enterprises.  An  improved  market  system \nwith necessary mobilization and training will encourage the entry of women entrepreneurs into agribusiness. Increased \naccess  among  the  women  will  require  more  women  staff,  which  will  improve  job  creation  for  women  and  empower \nthem.  \n \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.
