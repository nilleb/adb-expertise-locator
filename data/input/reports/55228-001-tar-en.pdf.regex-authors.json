THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n1.  Improvements in key health outcomes. Bangladesh has a pluralistic health system with \ndiverse  stakeholders,  such  as  the  government,  private  sector  partners,  nongovernment \norganizations, and donor agencies supporting in the development of policies and implementation \nof health sector initiatives.1 The health care delivery system in the country covers the entire \nspectrum of services, from health education and promotion to treatment, care, and rehabilitation.2 \nBangladesh  has  achieved  significant  improvements  in  health  service  coverage  and  health \noutcomes since its independence in 1971. In the last 50 years, life expectancy at birth in the \ncountry has improved from 44 to 72 years,3 while the under-five mortality rate has declined almost \ntenfold in the same period (from 239.68 to 28.95 deaths per 1,000 live births).4 As of 2019, infant \nand maternal mortality ratios have also improved significantly and stand at 21 (per 1,000 live \nbirths) and 165 (per 100,000 live births) respectively, compared to the average of 37 per 1,000 \nlive births and 265 per 100,000 live births in lower-middle countries.5 Since its establishment in \n1974,  the  Expanded  Programme  on  Immunization  has  achieved  notable  successes, \naccomplishing  a  total  immunization  rate  of  86.00%,  and  increasing  the  proportion  of  fully \nvaccinated children from 2.00% in 1984 to 83.90% in 2019.6 Bangladesh is also on track to \nachieve its 2022 targets for all nutritional indicators (footnote 3). Between 2014 and 2018, stunting \nof children decreased from 36.10% to 31.00% and wasting decreased from 14.30% to 8.00% \n(footnote 3). The country has shown great achievements in reducing the threat of communicable \ndiseases before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Mortality from communicable \ndiseases fell dramatically since 1990, with similar decline in males and females, due to the \nsignificant fall in the prevalence of childhood infectious diseases. The country has made several \nefforts to increase access to health services through a combination of facility, community, and \nhousehold-level service provision strategies. As a result, Bangladesh has made significant \nimprovement in health and population indicators, and consistent progress towards achieving its \nSustainable Development Goal health targets. Although Bangladesh has demonstrated much \nprogress in achieving health-related indicators, there are still many unmet health needs as \ndiscussed.  \n \n2.  Low  government  health  expenditure.  Bangladesh\u2019s  domestic  general  government \nhealth expenditure (as percentage of general government expenditure) has steadily decreased \nfrom 4.44% in 2010 to 2.98% in 2018.7 The domestic general government health expenditure as \na share of current health expenditure has also continually declined from 21.03% in 2010 to            \n \n1  World Health Organization and Asia Pacific Observatory on Health Systems and Policies. 2015.

Moreover, out-of-pocket expenditures \non health (as percentage of current health expenditure) in the country is extremely high at 73.88%, \ncompared to the average of 51.23% in lower middle-income countries.10 High out-of-pocket \nexpenditures heighten vulnerability for large portions of the population as catastrophic health \nexpenditure forces 5.7 million Bangladeshis into poverty.11 This necessitates the need for health \nfinancing measures to be undertaken to provide health security for vulnerable populations.  \n \n3.  Health  inequality.  Bangladesh  has  deep-rooted  socioeconomic  inequalities,  which \nremain among the key development challenges in the country. Inequities, including high poverty \nrate, large income divide, social barriers, and spatial disparities reflect in the limited availability, \naccess, and utilization of health services. This has been observed in routine immunization \ncoverage, which is unevenly distributed across geographic and socioeconomic groups, with \ncoverage as low as 78% among children in Dhaka slums and with coverage increasing according \nto  income  and  educational  attainment.12 Similarly,  maternal  health  care  and  treatment  for \nchildhood services remain disproportionate according to income levels.  \n \n4.  Emerging  noncommunicable  diseases.  Bangladesh  is  facing  a  double  burden  of \ncommunicable and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) due to epidemiological and demographic \nchanges. While deaths due to infectious diseases have decreased, the country\u2019s disease burden \nis shifting towards NCDs. As of 2019, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and chronic \nrespiratory diseases accounted for 67% of all deaths in the country.13 Despite the development \nof a wide network of primary health care (PHC) facilities, access to quality health services remains \nfar less than expected for large segments of the population. Both urban and rural health care \nproviders have been unable to fully respond to the diverse problems faced by the population. The \nchallenges are further compounded due to rapid urbanization in urban settings which has placed \nsignificant pressure on public health facilities in the country.  \n \n5.  Health human resource shortage. Bangladesh also suffers from both an absolute \nshortage and geographic maldistribution of the health workforces, as well as clustering of health \nfacilities (both public and private) at the district and sub-district headquarters.14 In 2019, the \nvacancy rate for Director General of Health Service-sanctioned posts was above 25.0%. There \nare only less than 20.0% of health workers deployed to rural areas where 62.5% of the total \npopulation of Bangladesh are living. The nurse-to-doctor ratio is the reverse of the World Health \n \n8  The World Bank. Data.

These contribute towards poor quality of health services due to \nunavailability or overburdening of human resources. \n \n6.  Slow digitalization in the health sector. The Digital Bangladesh campaign by the \ngovernment has prioritized e-health for delivery of health care services through information and \ncommunication technology. E-health initiatives aim to apply technologies to effectively improve \nthe quality and access of health care for populations. However, they are constrained by several \nbarriers such as limited access to internet, lack of equipment and digital e-health tools, skilled and \ncomputer trained human resources, provisions for patient data security, etc.16  \n \n7.  Ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely \naffected the health sector through both demand and supply-side disruptions. Since the first case \nof the disease was detected on 8 March 2020, the country has confirmed more than 1.57 million \ncases and over 27,900 deaths as of 14 November 2021.17 During the pandemic, outpatient \nconsultations have declined by 40% compared to 2019 and facility births have decreased by 29%. \nShortages in supplies affected service delivery as 96% of districts in the country reported gaps in \nreproductive health supplies. Moreover, routine immunization rates fell and over 40% of districts \nreported less than 50% immunization coverage. COVID-19 also added to the mental health toll. \nHigh rates of depression (33%) and suicide ideation (5%) were reported during lockdown. \n \n8.  Asian Development Bank assistance. The Bangladesh\u2013Asian Development Bank (ADB) \npartnership started in 1973 when the country was reconstructing from the damage of the War of \nLiberation. ADB\u2019s Bangladesh program evolved in close alignment with the country\u2019s priorities, \nbeginning with a focus on infrastructure investments and broadening into other areas over time.18 \nADB has been supporting the government to strengthen urban PHC infrastructure and deliver \nprimary health services to urban population in selected urban areas through public-private \npartnerships (PPPs) through various health sector projects for more than 20 years. A sizeable \nportion of the development budget in Bangladesh has been financed through international \ndevelopment partners, including ADB since the 1990s. ADB has also supported the government \nthrough the COVID-19 response, including (i) immediate support of $500 million under the \nCOVID-19 pandemic response option to mitigate immediate effects of COVID-19 on health and \neconomic  sectors,  (ii)  additional  support  of  $100  million  through  the  COVID-19  Response \nEmergency  Assistance  Project  to  support  the  health  system  investments  and  community \nresponse to the pandemic, and (iii) $940 million through the Responsive COVID-19 Vaccine for \nRecovery Project under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility to procure COVID-19 vaccines \nfor the massive nationwide COVID-19 immunization program.19  \n \n9.  Rationale  for  technical  assistance  facility.  Although  ADB\u2019s  interventions  have \nstrengthened the government\u2019s capacity to provide PHC services, the scope and coverage of \nsupport need to be expanded and the service delivery model needs to be reformed, as the country \n \n15 World Bank. 2015.

Manila. \n \n ", "4   \nis currently facing more diversified health needs. Key challenges being faced by the country \ninclude rapid growth of urban population, the double burden of communicable and NCDs, and the \neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government is looking for innovative approaches with the \nsupport  of  developing  partners,  including  ADB,  to  improve  the  access  and  quality  to \ncomprehensive  PHC  services,  including  immunization,  strengthening  the  effectiveness  and \nefficiency of the health system to achieve Universal Health Coverage, and mitigating COVID-19-\nrelated adverse impacts through vaccine manufacturing, genomic surveillance and mobile testing \ncapacity, research on vaccine hesitancy and health sector needs, etc. Additionally, there is also \nthe need to focus on the use of information technology tools for efficient health service delivery, \nPPPs, telemedicine, movement towards electronic health records, World Health Organization \ncompliant vaccine certification, etc.  \n \n10.  For these reasons, the transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project \npreparation and implementation support to the ensuing Support for Health Care Improvement \nProject and the ongoing Responsive COVID-19 Vaccines for Recovery Project under the Asia \nPacific  Vaccine  Access  Facility  project  implementation,  including  additional  financing  in \nBangladesh,  to  ensure  quality  project  preparation  and  due  diligence,  and  improve  the \ngovernment\u2019s readiness for the project implementation. As ADB expands its health sector portfolio \nin Bangladesh, the proposed transaction TA facility will enable ADB to deepen the policy dialogue \nand provide technical support to address health sector challenges through locally appropriate and \ninnovative approaches. Both the ensuing and the ongoing projects are in the health sector and \nrequire a similar set of technical, safeguard, financial management, procurement, and capacity \nbuilding supports. The proposed transaction TA facility is listed in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023.20  \n \n11.  Support for Health Care Improvement Project (ensuing project). The ensuing results-\nbased lending (RBL) program aims to improve access to and quality of comprehensive PHC \nservices and strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the health system to achieve Universal \nHealth Coverage. According to the consultation meeting with the Ministry of Health and Family \nWelfare during the human and social development sector portfolio review mission convened from \n9 to 12 December 2020, areas of intervention where the ministry requires assistance include (i) \nstrengthening PHC through community-based health care (community clinics); (ii) tackling NCD \nthrough community-based approach; (iii) training of human resources including doctors, nurses, \nparamedics,  laboratory,  and  other  technicians  for  better  skills  mix  in  human  resource \nmanagement and to deliver quality health care; (iv) strengthening the capacity of the National \nInstitute of Preventive and Social Medicine to guide policy makers in timely decision-making \nthrough education and research; (v) strengthening information technology infrastructure for health \nthrough a management information system for shared health record; and (vi) bridging the doctor-\npatient gap with telemedicine. The TA facility will support a feasibility study or needs assessment \nto further guide the scope of the ensuing project, in light of learnings during the COVID-19 \npandemic. The proposed ensuing project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nBangladesh, 2021\u20132025 and several of ADB Strategy 2030 operational priorities: (i) addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress and gender equality, and \n(iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.21 The ensuing project will strive for the \neffective gender mainstreaming category or higher.

Responsive COVID-19 Vaccines for Recovery Project under the Asia Pacific Vaccine \nAccess Facility (ongoing project).23 The TA facility will support the ongoing project as required \nand agreed with the executing and implementing agencies. Continued support from ADB will be \ncrucial  particularly  in  expediting  the  vaccination  campaign  and  other  non-pharmacological \ninterventions e.g., vaccine procurement and safeguards, strengthening cold chain systems, \nreducing vaccine wastage and vaccine hesitancy. The TA will also be used for strengthening \ngenetic or genomic surveillance and COVID-19 testing capacity (including mobile testing units) in \npartnership with other available grants. Technical and training support will be provided to the \nongoing project to ensure project sustainability, compliance of safeguard requirements, transfer \nof capacity, knowledge management, and dissemination of best practices, including workshops, \netc. for all concerned stakeholders. As the demand of COVID-19 vaccines might further increase \ndue to the rapidly evolving situation of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ground, the executing and \nimplementing agencies may also require support to process and implement additional financing \nto the ongoing project from the TA facility to ensure that additional doses of live-saving vaccines \ncan be procured and delivered in a timely and efficient manner.  \n \n13.  The  TA  facility  approach  is  considered  suitable,  as  it  will  reduce  transaction  costs \ncompared to resources required for separate stand-alone transaction TA projects. It will enhance \nthe efficiency of preparation of the ensuing project and implementation of both the ensuing and \nthe ongoing projects, enable the incorporation of lessons from the ongoing project in the ensuing \nproject designs, and improve project implementation readiness by (i) allowing the same experts \nand  consultants  to  be  mobilized  for  similar  due  diligence  and  project  implementation  and \nprocessing support activities, (ii) facilitating learning on project processing and implementation \nacross different projects, and (iii) creating synergies from working with common technical inputs \nand capacity building opportunities. The TA facility is classified as complex because both the \nensuing and ongoing loan amounts exceed $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n14.  Output 1: Quality of design and readiness of ensuing project strengthened. The \noutput will provide technical expertise to support the preparation of the ensuing projects for \npotential ADB financing. The scope of activities under the output covers (i) review and conduct of \nanalytical studies, including, but not limited to, identification of key areas for ADB investment in \nhealth, health sector assessment, stakeholder analysis, landscape analysis of demand and \nsupply of PHC services, health financing assessment, health human resource forecasting, health \neducation and research capacity assessment, assessment of impacts of changing climate to \nhuman health, health service needs and gap analysis, and project soundness assessment as \nappropriate for the ensuing projects; (ii) identification of scope and design of activities and \nimplementation arrangement of the ensuing projects; (iii) feasibility studies, including exploring \ndelivering selected activities through PPP approach as required for the ensuing projects; (iv) \ndevelopment  of  project  results  framework,  and  conduct  of  project  results  assessment  and \nmonitoring and evaluation system assessment for the ensuing RBL program; (v) safeguard \n \n22 According to the tentative scope described in para. 14, the tentative safeguards categorizations of the ensuing \nSupport for Health Care Improvement Project are B for environment, C for involuntary resettlement, and C for \nindigenous peoples. \n23 The ongoing project was approved on 24 June 2021 and effective on 5 July 2021.

Output  2:  Project  implementation  and  management  capacity  of  executing  and \nimplementing agencies improved. Technical expertise and capacity building will be provided \nunder this output to executing and implementing agencies of the ensuing and the ongoing projects \nfor successful implementation and sustainability. In addition, the output will also provide non-\nprocessing related capacity building and knowledge sharing support to the Ministry of Health and \nFamily Welfare to address technical gaps, challenges, and issues with health sector development \nand pandemic response relevance. Support will be provided, including (i) provision of human \nresources with required technical expertise to executing and implementing agencies to support \nthe implementation of the ensuing and ongoing projects, including the preparation of bidding \ndocuments; (ii) provision of quality training capacity building to concerned government officials \nand stakeholders that are closely involved in the project implementation, which will also include \nthe procurement of training equipment; (iii) establishment of effective monitoring and evaluation \nsystems,  and  ensuring  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  for  timely \nimplementation and sustainability; (iv) knowledge sharing activities between the executing and \nimplementing agencies of the ensuing and ongoing projects, such as seminars and workshops to \nshare lessons learned and best practices across stakeholders; and (v) technical support to \naddress health sector issues, conduct assessments, and initiate policy dialogues, including \ncollaborating with Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and other development \npartners  in  supporting  the  government  in  mitigating  COVID-19  pandemic  effects  through \nstrengthening epidemiological research, genetic and genomic disease surveillance capacity, \nmobile testing, etc. to enable better detection of trends for variants and efficiently manage disease \nprevention and control efforts.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The transaction TA facility is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000, will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n17.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nand housing accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the transaction TA \nfacility does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n \n24 Procurement due diligence for the ensuing Support for Health Care Improvement Project will follow the RBL \nguidelines (ADB. 2019.
