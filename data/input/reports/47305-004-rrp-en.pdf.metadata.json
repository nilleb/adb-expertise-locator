It will increase the outreach of participating financial institutions \n(PFIs)  and  improve access to  market-based  bank finance for  horticulture enterprises (farmers, \nagro-processing  enterprises,  owners  and  operators  of  cold  storage  facilities,  and  trading  and \nlogistics service suppliers). These will include both additional enterprises not financed under the \nexisting  project  and  enterprises  already  financed  under  the  existing  project  to  enable  them  to \nexpand operations. The additional financing will enhance the impact of the existing project and \nfurther  increase  farm  productivity,  improve  processing  and  storage  capacity,  and reduce  post-\nharvest  losses  through  upgrading  and  establishing  intensive  orchards;  modern  and  efficient \ngreenhouses; and processing, storage, and refrigeration facilities. This will, in turn, promote long-\nterm  economic  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  enhance  profitability  for  farmers  and \nagribusiness enterprises. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nSector performance. Uzbekistan\u2019s economy grew consistently during 2010\u20132016, when \n3. \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 8.0%, reaching $63.4 billion in \n2016.2 The economy has proved resilient to the downward pressures exerted from 2008 onwards \non other economies by the global financial crisis. Despite an economic downturn in the Russian \nFederation (Uzbekistan\u2019s major trading partner and source of remittances), the Uzbek economy \nachieved GDP growth rates of 7.8% in 2016 and 5.3% in 2017. GDP growth is expected to be \n7.3% in 2018.3 According to national poverty line estimates, overall poverty declined from 27.5% \nof  the  population  in  2001  to  12.8%  in  2016  as  a  result  of  rapid  economic  growth.4 Along  with \noverall economic growth, agriculture GDP in Uzbekistan grew at an average annual rate of 6.7% \nduring 2012\u20132016. There was however, a slowdown in 2017 when the sector grew by only 2.0%. \nThe  higher  rate  of  growth  in  other  sectors  resulted  in  a  decline  in  the  agriculture  sector\u2019s \ncontribution to GDP, from 34.4% in 2000 to 19.2% in 2017. Agriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP has \ntraditionally derived from the production of cotton and wheat, which the government has regarded \nas  strategic  crops  and  supported  through  preferential  access  to  land,  inputs,  and  finance. \nHowever, there has been a shift in the contribution of these crops to GDP since 2000. The share \nof cotton production in GDP declined from 3.6% in 2000 to 2.3% in 2016. Over the same period, \nthe contribution of grains to GDP fell from 3.4% to 2.4%, while the combined share of fruit and \nvegetables increased from 5.2% to 10.6%.5 \n \n4. \nDespite its declining share of GDP, agriculture remains an important sector. In 2017, it \naccounted for 27% of total employment. It is also a key income source in rural areas, where 49% \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank estimate in dollars. http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/uzbekistan (accessed 1 January 2018). \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Asian Development Outlook 2017. Manila. \n4  On the basis of $1.90 purchasing power parity criterion, an estimated 68.1% of the population was below the poverty \n\nline in 2012. ADB. 2017. Basic 2017 Statistics. Manila. \n\n5  Government of Uzbekistan, State Committee on Statistics. 2017. Statistical Report 2017. Tashkent. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nof the population resides, and which account for 75% of people living below the poverty line. About \n4.7  million  rural  households  operating  dehkan  (small-scale)  farms  derive  their  income  from \nagriculture. Dehkan farms, which operate independently of government support, account for the \nproduction of 66% of vegetables, 76% of potatoes, 54% of fruit, and 49% of grapes on farms of \n0.35\u20130.50 hectares (ha). \n \n5. \nThe shift in production from cotton and wheat to horticulture is also reflected in exports. \nAgricultural  exports  grew  at  an  annual  average  rate  (in  current  dollar  terms)  of  12.5%  during \n2000\u20132013, while cotton exports grew by an annual rate of only 2.0%. During 2010\u20132017, cotton \nexports  declined  from  $1.5  billion  to  $477.1  million,  while  the  share  of  cotton  exports  in  total \nexports fell from 27.5% in 2000 to 3.4% in 2017. By comparison, the share of food products in \nexports rose from 5.00% in 2000 to 6.35% in 2017.6 Fruit and vegetable exports grew from $68.7 \nmillion in 2000 to $1.45 billion in 2016, equating to an average annual growth rate of 21%, while \nthe share of fruit and vegetables in total exports increased from 2% to 9%. In 2016, the value of \nfruit and vegetable exports exceeded that of cotton exports by more than 30% ($600 million). \n \nBinding constraints. Although it is expected to continue to grow, the agriculture sector \n6. \nis  characterized  by  low  productivity  and  remains  labor  intensive.  The  horticulture  subsector  is \nconstrained  by  limited  access  to  quality  land,  specialized  horticulture  machinery,  appropriate \ninputs, and, in particular, finance. Limited access to either equity or long-term debt financing for \nproducers and enterprises throughout the value chain constrains development. The horticulture \nsubsector does not receive preferential financing under government programs, as is the case for \ncotton  and  wheat  production.  Financial  institutions  have  a  largely  negative  perception  of  the \nprofitability  and  creditworthiness  of  the  agriculture  sector,  exacerbated  by  an  undeveloped \nregulatory framework for the use of movable assets as loan collateral, and a lack of acceptable \ncollateral  among  many  small-scale  producers  or  collateral  with  low  realizable  values  among \nagribusiness enterprises. Further, access to information on potential borrowers is limited as the \ncredit information system is not efficient. Financial institutions have yet to develop credit policies \nand loan products appropriate to the needs of horticulture producers and enterprises, including \ncash-flow-based loan appraisal suitable for horticulture investment and seasonality of production. \n \n7. \nThe high cost of funds, perceived risks, and administrative costs associated with lending \nto individuals and small businesses require banks to charge interest rates of 11%\u201325% for local \ncurrency  loans  and  6%\u201315%  for  foreign  currency  loans.  Individuals  and  small  businesses  are \ngenerally  required  to  borrow  at  the  higher  end  of  these  ranges. 7  Deposit  mobilization  is \nundermined  by  public  mistrust  in  banks  and  is  compounded  by  administrative  hurdles  in \nwithdrawing cash from bank accounts. Bank loans are mainly short-term, with an average maturity \nof 18 months. While there is a high demand for medium- and long-term loans, banks are not able \nto  finance  due  to  their  lack  of  equivalent  medium-  and  long-term  funding  sources.  Moreover, \naccess  to  finance  for  private  individuals  and  enterprises  is  constrained  by  weak  rural  branch \nnetworks and limited mobile banking services. Family, friends, and informal sources fund 80% of \nsmall  businesses. 8 In  addition,  farmers  and  agribusiness  enterprises  have  poorly  developed \nbusiness and managerial skills and generally low financial literacy.  \n\n \n\n                                                \n6  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investment, and Trade. http://www.mfer.uz (accessed 1 January 2018). \n7   Under the existing project, PFIs receive ADB loan funds via the Ministry of Finance at 3%. To this PFIs add 2.5\u20133.5 \n\npercentage points based on their normal credit and risk management policies. \n\n8  World Bank. 2014. Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, 2012\u20132014. Washington, DC. \n \n\n\f3 \n\nOpportunities. The potential of a growing and more sophisticated consumer demand for \n8. \nboth fresh and processed products in domestic and export markets is not being realized because \nof  such  constraints.  Significantly  larger  volumes  of  produce  with  improved  quality  could  be \nmarketed if better post-harvest logistics, notably cold storage and transport, existed.9 Of the 20 \nmillion tons of horticultural output in 2016, only 15% was processed. Of the 3 million tons of fruit \nproduced, 69% are consumed fresh, 20% are processed, and 11% are exported, while for the 10 \nmillion tons of vegetables,  81.0% are consumed fresh, 11.3% are processed, 4.3%  are used for \nseeds, and 3.4%  are exported. This indicates a significant opportunity for improved value addition \nfrom  increased  processing  and  exports  of  both  fresh  and  processed  products.  The  revealed \ncomparative  advantage  analysis  by  ADB  staff  suggests  that  Uzbekistan  produces  more \nspecialized  horticultural  products  than  many  other  countries,  indicating  potential  to  expand \nexports. \n \n9. \nContinued diversification from cotton and wheat production toward horticulture also offers \nsignificant  environmental  benefits  as  it  could  decrease  demand  for  irrigation  water.  Climate \nchange projections for Uzbekistan from 2005 to 2050 indicate that (i) water supply will decrease \nfrom 57 billion cubic meters (m3) to 52\u201354 billion m3, (ii) water demand will increase from 59 billion \nm3 to 62\u201363 billion m3, and (iii) the water deficit will increase by more than 500% from about 2 \nbillion  m3  to  11\u201313  billion  m3.10 Horticulture  crops  typically  use  less  water  than  cotton  and  are \nmore efficient in water use than grain crops. In Uzbekistan, 4,426 m3 of water is required to grow \n1  ton  of  cotton  and  2,068  m3  of  water  is  required  for  1  ton  of  wheat.11 By  comparison,  grape \nproduction per ton requires about 2,400 m3 of water and apples 820 m3. Diversification of fruit and \nvegetable production from field to greenhouse cultivation, which is specifically supported under \nthe project, also offers significant water use efficiency and environmental management benefits. \n \n10. \nGovernment\u2019s  sector  strategy.  The  government  aims  to  take more  steps  to  increase \nagriculture  production. 12  Measures  include  (i)  further  structural  reforms  in  agriculture  and \ndiversification  of  agricultural  production;  (ii)  mechanization  of  agriculture,  improvement  of \ninfrastructure, and development of agribusiness; (iii) more productive use of land and water; (iv) \ngreater financial stability of farm entities; and (v) more market-oriented agricultural policies. The \ngovernment\u2019s sector development plan up to 2020 includes further reductions in cotton and wheat \nproduction and an increase in horticulture production. The strategy for further land reallocation \nwill  result  in  the  following  production  area  increases:  36,000  ha  for  potatoes,  91,000  ha  for \nvegetables, 18,000 ha for fruit orchards, and 11,200 ha for vineyards.13 The strategy will also aim \nat  improving  logistics  and  processing  to  boost  exports  of  agricultural  products,  including \nhorticulture.14  \n \n11. \nIn  the  finance  sector,  the  government  has  implemented  programs  to  support  small \nbusinesses and banking industry growth, and has increased access to finance. To improve the \n\n                                                \n9  Staff estimates indicate that post-harvest losses are up to 45.0% of the harvested crop, and that existing cold storage \n\nwill only be able to store 2.3% of the total forecast horticulture output by 2020. \n\n10 World Bank. 2010.

Delft, the Netherlands: UNESCO-IHE Institute of Water \nEducation. \n\n12 Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2015.  Presidential  Decree  No.  UP-4707.  Tashkent.  Under  this  decree,  a  program  of \n\nmeasures on structural reforms, modernization, and diversification of production for 2015\u20132019 was adopted. \n\n13 Under the farm size optimization program approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 29 December 2015. \n14 Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2016.  Presidential  Decree  PP-2505.  Tashkent.  Under  this  decree,  a  program  on \nmeasures to further develop the raw material base; expand the processing of horticulture, meat, and dairy products; \nand increase production and export of foodstuffs during 2016\u20132020 was adopted. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\ncapacity  of  the  banks  to  assess  borrower  creditworthiness,  the  Law  on  Credit  Information, \npromulgated in 2011, has established a public credit bureau. To facilitate registration of movable \nassets  as  loan  collateral,  the  2013  Law  on  Collateral  Registry  supports  establishing  an \nelectronically secured transactions registry. Laws enacted in the late 1990s need to be improved \nto  facilitate  the  use  of  movable  property  as  collateral.  Assisted  by  the  International  Finance \nCorporation,  the  government  prepared  draft  legal  amendments  for  enactment  in  2017.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  development  strategy  is  consistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u2013\n2016  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Uzbekistan  and  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations business plan, 2016\u20132018.15 \n \n12. \nDevelopment  partners  have  supported  agriculture  and  horticulture  through  a  variety  of \nprojects  and  technical  assistance.  The  World  Bank  has  implemented  two  rural  enterprise \nrestructuring  projects  that  included  the  provision  of  credit  to  farmers  and  food  processing \nenterprises. The World Bank is also implementing a horticulture development project with total \nfinancing of $650 million (including $500 million additional financing approved in January 2018).16 \nThis project includes (i) providing credit lines to PFIs, (ii) improving financial literacy and business \nplanning skills for horticulture farmers and agribusiness enterprises, (iii) establishing a national \nnetwork of private growers through training and technical assistance, and (iv) strengthening state \nresearch  institutes  and  plant  protection  services.  The  International  Fund  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment  (IFAD)  is  implementing  a  $30  million  horticulture  development  project. 17 Other \ndevelopment partners have also provided broad support to enhance the business environment \nand  capacity  building  for  financial  institutions  and  small  businesses. 18  Despite  the  recent \ninjections of long-term finance (estimated at $0.9 billion) in horticulture through these World Bank \nand IFAD projects and ADB\u2019s ongoing project, there remains significant unmet demand for long-\nterm  finance  in  the  horticulture  subsector.  The  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA),  which  is \nimplementing  these  projects,  estimates  the  demand  for  additional  investment  finance  during \n2018\u20132022 to be in the range of $0.8 billion\u2013$1.0 billion. \n \nAssessment  of the  existing  project. The  existing  project  was approved  in November \n13. \n2016  and  became  effective  in  April  2017.  Overall,  implementation  progress  is  rated  highly \nsatisfactory.  As  of  February  2018,  cumulative  fund  release  was  $151.7  million,  accounting  for \n98.5% of total loan proceeds ($154.0 million). A total of $151.4 million has been released to PFIs \nfor subloan financing, of which $130.2 million has been disbursed by PFIs to subborrowers. The \nremaining $21.2 million has also been committed to eligible subprojects. Cumulative liquidated \nsubloans amount to $82.1 million, accounting for 63% of total loan proceeds versus 22% of project \nimplementation  time  elapsed.  The  project  has  supported  124  horticulture  subprojects  through \nsubloans.  Fifty-four  of  the  subprojects  financed to  date,  with  a  subloan  value  of  $66.4  million, \nhave been for production, and 70 subprojects, with a subloan value of $63.8 million, have been \nfor post-harvest storage and processing. The project has helped (i) establish 2,753 ha of intensive \norchards  and  109  ha  of  water-  and  energy-saving  greenhouses,  (ii)  increase  the  refrigerated \nstorage capacity by 39,150 tons and post-harvest processing capacity by 7,224 tons, (iii) establish \npackaging  material  manufacture  of  12  million  square  meters,  and  (iv)  procure  171  units  of \nagricultural machinery. Given the nature of subprojects financed, in both production and modern \npost-harvest facilities, the project will have a positive effect on the production, marketing, branding, \nand export of Uzbek horticultural produce.19 \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2012.

All PFIs have \nbeen implementing environmental and social management systems (ESMSs) and will be required \nto further strengthen their ESMS and staff capacity during the remaining project implementation \nperiod. Risk management arrangements are satisfactory. PFIs have assigned staff to the existing \nproject who are able to effectively appraise subloan financing, subproject safeguards, and social \nand gender development aspects. Other than in certain limited cases, all PFIs are compliant with \nCentral Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) prudential regulations and ADB loan covenants. Subproject \nrisks  are  further  mitigated  by  screening  of  PFIs\u2019  advance  requests,  demand  projections,  and \nindividual subloan applications by the RRA, which is well staffed and is capable of undertaking \nsubproject appraisal and monitoring functions. The project performance rating is on track since \nApril 2017, when the project became effective. \n \n15. \nThe rapid disbursement of existing project funds reflects the high level of demand within \nthe horticulture subsector for long-term finance. PFIs and the RRA estimate that demand exists \nfor  financing  of  a  further  $1  billion.  The  scaling  up  of  the  existing  project  through  additional \nfinancing rather than a separate stand-alone project represents the most effective and fastest way \nto  meet  such  demand.  The  PFIs  engaged  in  the  existing  project  will  also  participate  in  the \nproposed additional financing project. These PFIs have well-established systems and procedures \nfor  subloan  identification,  appraisal,  disbursement,  and  monitoring.  The  PFIs  concerned  also \ncontinue to satisfy ADB\u2019s financial intermediary eligibility criteria, and the existing project meets \nADB\u2019s criteria for additional financing.20 \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  and  lessons.  The  project  will  help  enhance  private  sector \nparticipation in the agriculture value chains to increase efficiency gains while reducing the fiscal \nburden on the state. Moreover, through enhanced access to long-term finance, PFIs will be able \nto  sustainably  increase  their  outreach  into  horticultural  business  as  a  high-potential  niche. \nExpanded export of horticultural produce will help increase overall price and income transmission \nto  small-scale  producers  and  small  and  medium-sized  agribusinesses.  Capacity  development \nactivities  under  the  existing  project  will  enhance  subborrowers\u2019  technical  capacity  for  their \nproposed investments. Implementation results of the existing project suggest that the success of \nprojects  of  a  similar  nature  lies  in  PFIs  proactively  identifying  a  diverse  potential  clientele  (or \nsubborrowers) with financing demand for export-oriented horticulture value chain activities. Seven \nqualified  PFIs  have  undertaken  an  inventory  of  potential  clientele,  the  preliminary  demand \nestimates of which indicate that the proposed additional financing loan of $198 million can be fully \nutilized by December 2021.21 \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe impact and outcome for the overall project will be the same as for the existing project. \nThe overall project is aligned with the following impact: improved contribution of the horticulture \nsubsector to inclusive economic growth and rural employment (footnote 12). The overall project \nwill  have  the  following  outcome:  increased  production  and  marketing  of  horticultural  products, \nwhich also remains unchanged from the existing project. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n                                                \n20 ADB. 2011.
