In  2009,  it \ncommissioned the first pilot solar thermal power project based on tower technology in India with \na  capacity  of  2.5  megawatts  (MW).  Since  then  it  has  developed  65  MW  of  solar  photovoltaic \nprojects. In October 2013 EDF Energies Nouvelles (EDF EN) and EREN, two leading renewable \nenergy  developers  from  France,  took  a  combined  equity  stake  of  50%  in  ACME  Solar  Energy \nPrivate  Limited  (ASEPL),  the  solar  subsidiary  of  ACME. With  these  new  investors  and  a  solid \npipeline,  ASEPL  is  expected  to  significantly  contribute  to  the  goal  of  the  Jawaharlal  Nehru \nNational Solar Mission (JNNSM), which aims to achieve an installed capacity of 22,000 MW of \nsolar  power  in  India  by  2022.2 In  February  2014,  ASEPL  won  100  MW  of  solar  photovoltaic \npower projects under the JNNSM phase 2 tender. \n \nIt  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  direct  support  to  solar  photovoltaic  projects  developed  under  the \n3. \nJNNSM.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is  required  to  support  decreasing  solar  tariffs  through  long-tenor \nfixed-rate  loans.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  also  support  the  entry  of  foreign  renewable  energy \ndevelopers  (EDF  EN  and  EREN)  into  the  Indian  solar  sector,  catalyzing  much-needed  foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) and expertise into this key sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n \n\nThe  project  involves the  financing and  implementation  of  200  MW of  solar  photovoltaic \n4. \nprojects by ASEPL during 2014\u20132017. ADB will provide debt financing to the 100 MW already \nawarded under JNNSM phase 2, as well as to 100 MW of projects to be identified after approval \nby the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n5. \nThe  100  MW  of  capacity  awarded  under  the  JNNSM  phase  2  encompasses  five \nindividual  projects  of  20  MW  each  that  will  be  developed  by  five  different  special  purpose \nvehicles  (SPVs):  ACME  Gurgaon  Power  Private  Limited  (Gurgaon  Power),  ACME  Mumbai \nPower  Private  Limited  (Mumbai  Power),  ACME  Rajdhani  Power  Private  Limited  (Rajdhani \nPower), Medha Energy Private Limited (Medha Energy), and Ranji Solar Energy Private Limited \n(Ranji Energy). The five projects are all located near the village of Badi Sid in Jodhpur district of \nRajasthan,  160  kilometers  northwest  of  the  city  of  Jodhpur.  The  annual  global  horizontal \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy.  2010.

Second, \nGurgaon Power, Mumbai Power, Rajdhani Power, and Medha Energy, awarded under the open \ncategory,  will  procure  panels  without  any  geographical  restriction.  The  panel  suppliers  are \nselected by ASEPL in compliance with ADB\u2019s procurement policies. Commissioning of the five \nprojects is expected by 28 April 2015. \n \n7. \nThe additional 100 MW of projects to be financed by ADB will be selected by ADB and \nstructured  on  standard  terms  and  conditions  similar  to  the  first  five  projects.  The  selection  of \nsuch additional projects will be based on the following criteria and standard ADB private sector \noperations  and  due  diligence  procedures:  (i)  solar  photovoltaic  projects  in India  with long-term \nofftake, (ii) financial viability, (iii) risk-adjusted pricing of the ADB loans, and (iv) compliance with \nall  ADB  policies.  Subject  to  the  approval  of  the  proposed  loans  by  the  Board,  the  borrowers, \namount and structure of the financing for the additional projects will be reviewed and approved \nby  ADB\u2019s  Investment  Committee. 6 To  ensure  full  utilization  of  the  proposed  loans  within  a \nreasonable  time  after  Board  approval,  the  additional  100  MW  of  projects  will  need  to  be \nfinanced by December 2016. Due diligence has been conducted on the first five borrowers, the \nsponsors, as well as their respective shareholders, directors, and key management. The project \nteam  will  update due diligence during project  implementation,  and undertake due diligence on \nall additional borrowers.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n \n8. \nAll  borrowers  will  be  different  SPVs  controlled  and  owned  by  ASEPL.  ASEPL  was \nestablished  by  ACME  to  develop  solar  energy  projects  across  India.  ASEPL  has  25  MW  of \noperational  solar  photovoltaic  projects  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  25  MW  of  projects  under \nconstruction  in  Odisha.  ASEPL  is  owned  50%  by  ACME  (32%  by  ACME  Cleantech  Solution \nLimited  [ACSL]  and  18%  by  MKU  Holdings  Private  Limited),  26%  by  EDF  EN,  and  24%  by \nEREN. EDF EN and EREN have together committed to invest $100 million in ASEPL. \n \n9. \nACME is specialized in energy saving solutions for telecommunication companies and in \nthe  development  of  renewable  energy  projects. The  company  was  founded  in  2003  by  Manoj \nKumar  Upadhyay,  a  research  engineer  in  the  telecommunications  and  power  sectors. \nHeadquartered  in Gurgaon,  India,  ACME  has  over  20  offices in India and a  presence  in  more \nthan 10 countries.  \n \nEDF EN is fully owned by EDF, the second-largest utility in the world. EDF acquired EDF \n10. \nEN  from  P\u00e2ris  Mouratoglou  and  other  investors  in  2011.  EDF  EN  has  more  than  20  years  of \nexperience in solar power. With 7,190 MW of capacity in operation7 and 2,320 MW of capacity \n\n                                                \n3  Measure  of  intensity  and  availability  of  sunlight  in  a  given  location,  which  can  be  converted  to  electricity  either \n\nthrough photovoltaic solar panels or concentrating solar thermal power technology. \n\n4  The global horizontal radiance estimation is based on the METEONORM  6.0  weather database developed by the \n\n5  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy.  2012.

EDF  EN  operates  in  17  countries,  mainly  in  Europe  and  North  America,  and \nmore  recently  in  Africa  and  the  Middle  East.  EDF  EN\u2019s  turnover  for  the  fiscal  year  ending  31 \nDecember 2013 was $1.7 billion. \n \n11. \nEREN,  founded  in  2012  by  P\u00e2ris  Mouratoglou  and  David  Corchia,  is  a  company \ndedicated to renewable energies and natural resource savings. EREN has a diversified portfolio \nof circa 300 MW of renewable energy projects (wind, solar, and hydro power) in operation and \nconstruction  in  France,  Greece,  Italy,  Israel  and  India  and  is  an  active  investor  in  several \ncompanies  with  innovative  technology  solutions  that  allow  for  more  efficient  use  of  natural \nresources.  \n \nASEPL\u2019s board of directors consists of four individuals: (i) Manoj Kumar Upadhyay, the \n12. \nfounder of ACME; (ii) R. M. Samy from ASEPL, with over 30 years\u2019 experience in administration, \ncorporate  affairs,  finance,  and  accounting;  (iii)  Antoine  Garret,  vice-president  of  EDF  EN  in \ncharge of business development in Asia; and (iv) Pierre Dagallier, board member of the EREN \ngroup. The board of directors of ASEPL is supported by a well-qualified management team with \na strong solar and/or business background.  \n \nB. \n \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n \n13. \nThe project's impact will be the diversification of India\u2019s energy mix through the addition \nof  renewable  energy  capacity,  helping  the  country  progress  towards  its  clean  energy  targets.8 \nTo  achieve  sustainable  long-term  economic  growth,  India  is  promoting  alternative  sources  of \nenergy, such as solar, for power generation. Solar is a secure, reliable, and sustainable source \nof  electricity  that  diversifies  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix,  strengthening  energy  security  and \nreducing reliance on fossil fuels. \n \n14. \nThe  project  also  contributes  to  the  acceleration  and  expansion  of  private  sector \ninvestment,  including  FDI,  in  clean  energy  infrastructure  in India.  ASEPL  and  its  shareholders \nsee  ADB\u2019s  potential  assistance  as  a  key  success  factor  to  expanding  the  company\u2019s  solar \nportfolio. In particular, it is expected that ADB\u2019s assistance will help demonstrate the viability of \nthe  JNNSM  phase  2  offtake  structure,  which  in  turn  will  help  attract  further  investments  in  the \nIndian solar sector from both within and outside India. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \n15. \nThe  project's  outcome  is  increased  solar  power  capacity  installed  and  operated  by  the \nprivate  sector.  The  project  will  generate  380,000  megawatt-hours  of  clean  energy  per  annum \nand  contribute  to  avoiding  280,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  annually  from  2018 \nonwards. \n \n\n                                                \n8  The  government  has  established  targets  of  adding  30  gigawatts  of  renewable  power  (including  solar,  wind, \n\nbiomass, and small hydro) by 2017 under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n \n\n16. \nThe  project  output  is  the  development  and  commissioning  of  100  MW  of  solar \nphotovoltaic  power  projects  under  JNNSM  phase  2  by  December  2015  and  an  additional  100 \nMW of solar photovoltaic power projects by December 2017. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.9 The  midterm \n17. \nreview calls for investing $2 billion annually in clean energy (including renewable energy). The \nmidterm  review  highlights  the  key  role  of  the  private  sector  in  climate  change  mitigation  and \nconfirms that ADB should continue to prioritize private sector operations in clean and renewable \nenergy. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s India country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017, which \ncalls for \u201cinvestments in renewable energy development, particularly solar.\u201d10 \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n \nThe project is fully aligned with ADB's Energy Policy.11 The policy states that support for \n18. \nrenewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened. In 2013, ADB increased its target \nof clean energy investments to $2 billion a year from the previous target of $1 billion a year. As \npart  of  the  policy  implementation,  ADB  is  emphasizing  private  sector  participation  as  a tool  to \nincrease energy sector efficiency by introducing increased competition and increased investable \nresources. The proposed investment also contributes to ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative and \ncomplements  sovereign  interventions  in  the  sector  (for  example,  the  sovereign  project  that  is \nsupporting renewable power evacuation from Rajasthan to other states).12  \n \nD. \n \n19. \n \n20. \n \n \n\nThe total funding requirement for the 200 MW pipeline is estimated at $265 million. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n \n\n                                                \n9  ADB.  2014.

The life of the PPA with SECI is 25 years from COD. The remaining 100 \nMW of projects will be developed between 2015 and 2017. \n All projects will enter into lump-sum turnkey contracts (EPC contracts) for the \nprocurement and supply of foreign and domestic equipment and erection, \nconstruction, and services for the project. The EPC contracts will include standard \nprovisions for liquidated damages on schedule and performance.  \nFor the first five projects, ACSL will source panels from well-reputed suppliers and \nfrom different technologies (thin film, multi-crystalline). All selected technologies \nare suited to warm and dry environments such as Rajasthan. All modules will \nbenefit from performance warranties for 25 years.  The remaining 100 MW of \nprojects will use suppliers of similar quality, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \nConfidential information deleted  \nThe electricity generated from the five first projects will be evacuated from the \nproject site to the nearest  substation under the responsibility of Rajasthan Vidyut \nPrasaran Nigam Limited through a 132-kilovolt double-circuit transmission line to \nbe built under the EPC contracts of the five projects. The substation is under \nconstruction and is expected to be operational by December 2014. \nEach borrower of the first five projects has entered into a PPA with SECI, which is \nwholly owned by the Government of India, to sell 100% of the output of the project \nfor a period of 25 years at a fixed tariff of Rs5.45 per kWh ($0.089 per kWh). SECI \nwill on-sell the electricity to a pool of distribution utilities (10\u201320 state electricity \nboards or distribution utilities) under a power sale agreement at a price of Rs5.50 \nper kWh ($0.09 per kWh) and for a period of 25 years. The PPA provides for the \npayment of a subsidy\u2014the viability gap funding\u2014over the first 5 years of operation. \nThe viability gap financing is payable in six tranches: 50% is paid upon successful \ncommissioning and 50% is released over the next 5 years in five equal installments \nof 10% if the borrower maintains a certain level of electricity generation. For the \nremaining 100 MW of projects, output will be sold to government-owned entities \nsuch as state utilities or central government entities such as SECI or private sector \nofftakers with a credit standing, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \nASEPL will be responsible for operation and maintenance of all projects for 25 \nyears from COD.  \nKey performance indicators will be reported by the borrowers of the ACME-EDF \nSolar Power Project and monitored by ADB.

ADB  will  support  the  first  round  of  projects \nfinanced under JNNSM phase 2. While the objective of JNNSM phase 1 was to \npilot  different  solar  power  technologies  in  India,  the  objective  of  phase  2  is  to \ndramatically  scale up  capacity  addition  in  the  sector.  ADB\u2019s  assistance will  help \ndemonstrate the viability and bankability of the new offtake structure (i.e., pooling \nof multiple offtakers through the Solar Energy Corporation of India [SECI]), which \nwill ensure the success of the subsequent rounds of phase 2. \nSingle  Board  approval,  multiple  projects.  The  requested  Board  approval  will \nenable ADB to support multiple projects that likely would have been too small for \nseparate financing by ADB. Further, ADB\u2019s commitment for a total of $100 million \nin  long-term  project  finance  loans  through  a  single  Board  approval  will  enable \nASEPL  to  implement  additional  solar  photovoltaic  projects  in  a  manner  that \ndelivers competitively priced solar tariffs to Indian distribution utilities. \nForeign direct investment support. ADB\u2019s assistance will support the entrance \nof leading foreign renewable energy players (EDF EN and EREN) into the Indian \nmarket.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  facilitate  $100  million  in  FDI,  which  EDF  EN  and \nEREN have committed to invest as equity in ASEPL. In addition to much-needed \ncapital, FDI will bring new technical knowledge and expertise to the country. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks14 \n \n25. \nOfftaker risk. The first five projects have entered into a power purchase agreement with \nSECI at a tariff of Rs5.45 per kWh. SECI will on-sell the power to a pool of distribution utilities \nand  bulk  purchasers  (10\u201320  offtakers)  at  a  price  of  Rs5.50  per  kWh.  These  projects  are \nexposed to a nonpayment risk from SECI and indirectly from SECI\u2019s offtakers. However, (i) the \ncompetitive  tariff  of  Rs5.45  and  the  renewable  purchase  obligation  partly  mitigates  the  risk  of \nstate  utilities\u2019  default  in  the  short  and  long  term;  (ii)  the  first  five  projects  benefit  from  a \ndiversification  effect  of  the  final  electricity  purchasers;  and  (iii)  SECI  is  a  Government  of  India \nenterprise and, as such, benefits from the implicit support from the central government.  \n \n26. \n \n27. \n \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\n                                                \n14  This section relates to the first five projects awarded under JNNSM phase 2. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nTechnology risk. All modules selected for the first five projects are proven technologies \n28. \nwhich  have  been  in  commercial  operation  globally  for  more  than  10  years.  EDF  EN  led  the \nselection and certification of technology and equipment providers, providing an additional level \nof  comfort.  Unique  local  conditions  in  Rajasthan,  such  as  high  ambient  air  temperatures  and \nhigh levels of dust and soiling, could impair module performance. The forecast of energy yields \nhas  conservatively  factored  in  the  loss  in  performance  caused  by  high  temperatures,  soiling, \nand other factors. Adequate performance guarantees and liquidated damages  will be obtained \nfrom manufacturers and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor. \n \n29. \n \n30. \n \n31. \nConstruction  delay  risk.  Under the  SECI  power  purchase  agreement,  commissioning \nfor  the  first  five  projects  is  due  by  28  April  2015.  A  delay  of  more  than  3  months  in  the \ncommissioning date of the first five projects will affect the tariff, resulting in reduced cash flows \nfor  the  project.  Risk  of  delay  beyond  3  months  is  viewed  as  limited  because  (i)  the  EPC \ncontractor  and  the  sponsors  have  extensive  experience,  and  (ii)  the  EPC  contract  will  provide \nfor liquidated damages for any delay in completion.  \n \nOperation  and  maintenance  risk.  Operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  risk  for  a  solar \n32. \nphotovoltaic plant is primarily limited to ensuring adequate cleaning and replacing inverters after \n10 years. ASEPL is considered to have the necessary experience, being the O&M contractor for \nits 40 MW operational portfolio since 2012. O&M risk is not considered significant. \n \n33. \n \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\n \nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n34. \nThe project is processed as corporate finance from a safeguards and social dimensions \nperspective, with ADB funds expected to be allocated for implementing specific solar projects. In \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified category B \nfor  environment  and  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  The \npotential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  projects  will  be  identified  and  effective \nmeasures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  will  be \nincorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  In  addition  to  compliance  with  the  safeguard \nrequirements  for  individual  projects,  ASEPL  has  established  and  commits  to  maintain  an \nenvironmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  to  screen,  assess,  and  address \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of \nASEPL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n35. \nThe  first  five  projects,  developed  under  JNNSM  phase  2  in  Jodhpur  district,  Rajasthan \nwill  be  constructed  on government  land,  classified  as barren  and  non-agriculture land.  ASEPL \nwill avoid any impacts on local population by excluding from the project site parcels of land used \nby  locals  for  grazing  or  agricultural  purposes.  Unavoidable  impacts,  if  any,  on  non-titleholders \noccupying  the government  lands will  be  addressed in line  with  ADB  requirements.  An audit of \nthe  land  procurement  process  to  confirm  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009)  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  that  no  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\noccurred  will  be  carried  out.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB requirements.15 \n \n36. \nA corporate audit was conducted on the ASEPL\u2019s ESMS. Key findings of the audit show \nthat the ESMS is substantively compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, \nwhile  gaps  exist  with  respect  to  the  actual  implementation  of  ESMS  provisions,  for  which \ncorrective  actions  have  been  agreed  upon  by  ASEPL.  ASEPL  commits  to  have  in  place  an \nESMS that is compliant with the Safeguard Policy Statement, which is satisfactory to ADB, prior \nto  the  first  disbursement.  ASEPL\u2019s  project  selection  criteria  will  include  that  only  projects  with \nland allotted by government or purchased in the private land market will be eligible for inclusion. \nASEPL  will  submit  monitoring  reports  on  the  implementation  of  its  ESMS  and  the  projects.  In \naddition, an initial environmental examination and a resettlement plan or a due diligence report \ndocumenting  the  negotiated  settlement  for  land  acquisition  will  be  prepared  for  each  of  the \nprojects to be funded by the ADB loan (para. 7).  \n \n37. \nOther  social  dimensions.  ASEPL  is  committed  to  prioritizing  local  residents  for  jobs \ncreated  during  construction  and  operation.  ASEPL\u2019s  human  resource  policies  promote  equal \nopportunities  for  women  and  ensure  that  the  rights  of  women  are  protected.  The  project  is \nclassified  as  having  no  gender  elements.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation \nincludes appropriate provisions requiring the borrowers to comply with national labor laws and, \nin  addition,  to  take  specific  measures  (including  in  relation  to  contractors)  in  relation  to  the \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standard  for  the  ADB-financed  portion  of  the  project,  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.16 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n \n38. \nASEPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  financing  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n \nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \n\n39. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n \n40. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  India  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance to ASEPL and its subsidiaries. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in \nform and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the \nBoard of Directors. \n \n \n \n\nAssurances \n\n                                                \n15  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; and Findings of the Corporate Safeguards Audit: Environmental \nand Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n16   ADB. 2003.
