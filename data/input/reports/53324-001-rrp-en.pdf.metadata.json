The  report  also  describes  the \nproposed  administration of  grants  to  be  provided  by  (i) the  Strategic  Climate  Fund (SCF)1 and \n(ii) the Clean Energy Fund (CEF)2 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for the \nGrid  Reinforcement  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the SCF and CEF grants. \n \n2. \nThe project will support Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC), the state-owned power utility, in \nimproving the capacity and stability of its transmission network. It will (i) expand and reinforce the \nelectricity transmission infrastructure by constructing four 115 kilovolt (kV)\u2013230 kV transmission \nlines  and  10  substations  in  Phnom  Penh,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Cham,  and  Takeo \nprovinces; and (ii) introduce as a pilot the first utility-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) \nin Cambodia to understand the technology\u2019s performance and assess different business models \nwith  a  view  to  providing  combined  services  for  (a)  renewable  energy  integration,  (b)  primary \nfrequency response, (c) curtailment reserve, and (d) transmission congestion relief. EDC will also \nreceive  institutional  support  to  implement  the  project  and  strengthen  its  capacity  for  improving \nefficiency, inclusion, and gender equality. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nCambodia has achieved sustained economic progress. Cambodia\u2019s per capita gross \n3. \nnational  income  grew  on  average  by  7.1%  per  annum  from  $950  in  2013  to  $1,390  in  2018.3  \nStrong economic growth was driven mainly by urban-based industries such as garment exports \nand tourism, and, more recently, construction and real estate.  \n \n4. \nHowever,  COVID-19  pandemic  threatens  to  undermine  progress.  Whereas \nCambodia\u2019s economy was projected to grow by 6.8% before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, it is now expected to contract by 5.5% in 2020. It risks pushing an additional 1.3 million \npeople  into  poverty.  The  government  is  implementing  an  assistance  program  to  mitigate  the \nadverse  social  and  economic  impacts. 4  Moreover,  financing  and  constructing  needed \ninfrastructure,  including  those  that  enables  the  provision  of  reliable  and  sustainable  electricity \nsupply, is important to create employment and support the country\u2019s post COVID-19 economic \nrecovery. Cambodia aspires to attain middle-income status by 2030.  \n \n5. \nGovernment  prioritizes  energy  sector  development.  In  its  Socio-Economic  Policy \nAgenda, 2018\u20132023, the government recognizes the importance of developing the energy sector \nto increase competitiveness, ensure sustained economic growth, and thereby continue to reduce \npoverty.5 Its key policy objectives call for (i) extending the coverage of power supply, (ii) stepping \nup  power  reliability  by  expanding  and  upgrading  the  transmission  network  infrastructure,  (iii) \n\n \n\n1  Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries. \n2  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Phnom Penh. \n\n \n\n\ffurther  lowering  systemwide  costs  to  enable  a  tariff  reduction,  and  (iv)  providing  access  to \nelectricity from 74.8% in 2019 to 95% of all households by 2030. \n \n6. \nMore robust electricity supply will enhance economic productivity. Electricity supply \nincreased on average 19.1% annually from 2,515 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2010 to 12,015 GWh \nin  2019.  Large  investments  in  power  generation  help  address  rapidly  growing  demand  for \nelectricity  that  propels  economic  growth.  Most  (86.5%)  of  electricity  is  generated  domestically \nfrom  hydro  (50.2%),  coal  (32.3%),  renewable  energy  (0.7%),  and  diesel  fuel  (3.3%).  In  2019, \n98.5% of power generated domestically was provided by independent power producers. Power \nimports from neighboring countries contributed 13.5% to electricity supply. \n \n7. \nHowever, electricity services are still unreliable with poor quality. One major pressing \nconcern is that the existing transmission infrastructure is reaching capacity. At the end of 2019, \nCambodia\u2019s transmission infrastructure consisted of 2,267 kilometers (km) of 115 kV and 230 kV \ntransmission  lines  and  36  substations. 6 Several  substations  serving  the  provinces  of  Phnom \nPenh, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Cham, and Takeo are overloaded, resulting in transmission \nconstraints and disproportionate transmission losses (2.3%). A large number of households still \ndo not have access to electricity in Kampong Chhnang (32.3%), Kampong Cham (13.3%), and \nTakeo (9.2%) provinces, and those with access face frequent and unpredictable power shortages \naveraging  2  hours  per  day.  It  severely  hampers  the  quality  of  life,  erodes  Cambodia\u2019s \ncompetitiveness and effort to diversify into a manufacturing destination. Both domestic firms and \nforeign  investors  name  inadequate  electricity  supply,  in  addition  to  its  high  cost,  as  a  main \nconstraint to doing business in Cambodia.  \n \nTransmission infrastructure investment requirement of $2.27 billion. EDC, a wholly \n8. \nstate-owned  limited  liability  company,  is  responsible  for  electricity  supply,  transmission,  and \ndistribution.  It  does  not  receive  budgetary  support  from  the  government  and  finances  power \npurchases and transmission infrastructure costs from its operational cash flow. Private domestic \nand foreign investors are encouraged to invest.7 Several have already done so and operate 41.7% \nof  the  total  length  of  115  kV\u2013230  kV  transmission  lines  (945  km)  as  well  as  10  associated \nsubstations (27% of operational substations) under build\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer arrangements of \n10  years  or  more.8 In  addition,  Cambodia's  rural  electricity  enterprises  represent  an  important \nprivate-sector-based  framework  for  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the  country\u2019s \ndistribution  network. 9 However,  the  estimated  transmission  investment  requirement  of  $2.27 \nbillion  exceeds  the  financing  available  from  any  one  partner.  Concessional  financing  from \ndevelopment  partners  is  therefore  a  critical  supplement  to  EDC  and  private  financing,  and \nessential  for  accelerating  the  development  of  power  infrastructure that  can  advance  economic \ngrowth and poverty alleviation in Cambodia. \n \n9. \nProject's  role  as  an  important  economic  and  post-COVID-19  enabler.  The \nreinforcement  of  EDC's  infrastructure  will  enable  reliable  electricity  transmission  and  thereby \nenhance  economic  productivity,  competitiveness,  and  diversification.  Also,  the  construction  of \nfour  transmission  lines  and  10  substations  under  the  project  will  create  direct  employment  for \n1,300 people over a period of 2 years, with nearly 27% of the jobs to be created accessible to \nunskilled  workers.  Because  of  the  economywide  spillover  effects,  the  volume  of  indirectly \ngenerated employment is likely to be much larger. Direct and indirect jobs created in backward \n\ntransformer capacity. \n\n \n\n6  1,730 MVA of 115 kV / 22 kV substation transformer capacity and 1,330 MVA of 230 kV / 115 kV / 22 kV substation \n\n7  The promotion of private participation in electrification is anchored in Cambodia\u2019s Electricity Law (2001). \n8  Electricity Authority of Cambodia. 2019. Power Sector Report of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Phnom Penh. \n9  Rural electricity enterprises are private operators of small, isolated distribution systems in remote parts of Cambodia. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fsupply chain industries will add to household income, which will increase spending and in turn \ngenerate more jobs in other sectors.10 In parallel, however, the energy sector needs to become \nmore  inclusive.  Gender-based  stereotypes  related  to  women\u2019s  participation  in  sector  activities \nand  employment  prevail.  Women  account for  17%  of the  5,584  people  employed  by  EDC  and \nwork mainly in accounting, finance, billing, and public relations. Only a few women hold senior \nand  management  positions.  The  project  will  focus  on  education  and  training  activities  to \nstrengthen inclusion and gender equality at EDC.11 \n \nImprovements in sector planning and efficiency. Substantial increases in transmission \n10. \ninvestment can cause small tariff increases, unless they are wholly offset by savings from low-\ncost  generation,  fewer  transmission  and  distribution  losses,  and  congestion  cost  control.  EDC \nand  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Energy  (MME)  are  making  progress  in  strengthening  sector \ndevelopment planning with direct support from ADB.12 This includes technical assistance (TA) for \nproject  readiness,  procurement,  and  financial  management  to  improve  probity,  efficiency,  and \nadequate  service  delivery,  and  avoid  excessive  costs. 13  Concessional  financing  from \ndevelopment  partners  will  also  help  minimize  the  impact  of  the  substantial  transmission \ninvestments on end-user tariffs. \n \n11. \nIntroducing  the  battery  energy  storage  system.  As  costs  fall,  BESS  are  likely  to \nbecome a valuable asset because it (i) can enable EDC to adapt to uncertain electricity demand \nand reduce the risk of overbuilding and overinvesting in power generation, (ii) is more modular \nand can be moved more easily than power plants, and (iii) helps integrate intermittent renewable \npower  generation  capacity  and  can  thus  contribute  to  achieving  Cambodia\u2019s  target  of  a  16% \nreduction in energy greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 2010 level.14 EDC and Cambodia\u2019s \nelectricity  regulator,  Electricity  Authority  of  Cambodia,  must  start  now  to  understand  how  the \nlarge-scale deployment of low-cost battery energy storage can be used to (i) plan and operate \nCambodia\u2019s  future  grid  and  (ii)  reduce  systemwide  costs.  A  pilot  project  located  at  the  ADB \nsupported  100  MW  National  Solar  Park  and  coupled  with  on-the-job  training  is  ideal  for \nunderstanding the performance of an emerging technology such as the BESS, and for assessing \ndifferent business models.  \n \n12. \nADB  sector  experience  and  lessons  learned.  Since  1994,  ADB  has  awarded  nearly \n$200 million in loans and grants to Cambodia\u2019s energy sector and provided $6 million in technical \nassistance. ADB funding has focused on (i) transmission and distribution network expansion and \n(ii)  support  for  sector  reforms  and  institutional  capacity  building. 15  Experience  from  ADB\u2019s \npreviously financed transmission infrastructure projects shows that implementation delays can be \nmitigated  by  (i)  a  high  degree  of  project  readiness,  (ii)  advance  procurement,  and  (iii) project \nimplementation support. ADB will apply this experience to the proposed project.  \n \n\n \n\n10 International  Finance  Corporation.

In 2017, at \nthe government\u2019s request, ADB developed a national solar photovoltaic (PV) grid integration study \nand road map. It contributed to the government\u2019s plan to increase solar PV generation capacity \nfrom  155  MW  in  2019 to  415 MW  by  2022.  The target  includes the  construction  of  a  100 MW \nNational Solar Park which ADB helped to structure as a public-private partnership.16 This project \nalso exemplifies the one-ADB approach. Sovereign financing has been provided to help reduce \nprivate investment risk by building the solar park and transmission infrastructure. ADB\u2019s Office of \nPublic-Private  Partnership  helped  EDC  in  designing  and  conducting  a  competitive  tender  for \nprocuring the first private sector-led 60 MW solar power plant (Phase 1) within the park. It resulted \nin a competitive tariff of $0.03877 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), the lowest tariff for a solar project \nso  far  recorded  in  Southeast  Asia.

The transmission lines and \nsubstations will feature standard technology with which EDC is familiar. For the BESS, lithium-ion \nbattery  technology  will  be  used.25 The  BESS,  capable  of  storing  16  MWh  of  electricity,  will  be \ninstalled at a substation financed by ADB under the National Solar Park Project (footnote 16). The \ninstallation and commissioning of the BESS will be aligned with the construction of the solar park \nand  associated  transmission  infrastructure.  Project  implementation  consultants  will  ensure \n\n25  Lithium-ion battery technology is the most widely used battery energy storage technology for utility-scale applications \n\nbecause of its price competitiveness and high energy density. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial Viability \n\ncoordination between contractors for planning, layout, and site formation to help synchronize the \ninstallation  of  the  BESS  with  the  construction  of  the  new  substation.  The  substations  and  the \nBESS  will  include  remote  monitoring  and  protection  systems  in  line  with  international  design \nstandards and good practice.  \n \nB. \n \n26. \nADB  project  team  assessed  the  economic  viability  for  the  project  as  a  whole.  The \nconstruction of the four transmission lines and 10 substations results in incremental benefits of \nmeeting  growing  demand  and  non-incremental  benefits  of  reducing  losses.  The  pilot  BESS \nprovides multiple benefits to the transmission system, including (i) solar plant output smoothing, \n(ii)  curtailment  reserve,  (iii) primary  frequency  response,  and  (iv)  congestion  relief  to  defer \ninvestment in transformer upgrades. The project is economically viable with an economic internal \nrate of return of 30.6%, which exceeds the economic hurdle rate of 9%. \n \n27. \nThe financial analysis was carried out separately for output 1 (construction of transmission \nlines and substations financed by the ADB loan) and output 2 (introduction of the BESS financed \nby  the  SCF  and  CEF  grants).  For  output  1,  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  10.9%  and \nexceeds  the  calculated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  1.15%.  For  output  2,  the  financial \ninternal rate of return does not exceed the weighted average cost of government borrowing of \n3.6%. The average annual net revenues from the BESS, however, are sufficient to cover annual \noperating  expenditures,  ensuring  the  sustainability  of  the  BESS  throughout  its  operating  life \nwithout any direct financial cost to EDC. The pilot project is essential for EDC to understand the \nperformance of the technology and assess different business models that can enable large-scale \ndeployment of low-cost battery energy storage in the future. \n \n28. \nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, EDC forecasts electricity sales in 2020 to grow by \n5% from the 2019 level, before rebounding to double-digit growth in 2021. Various stress tests \nwere  conducted.  Even  under  a  scenario  of  demand  contraction  in  2020  and  slower-than-\nanticipated growth\u2014at an average 10.8% per year, compared with the initially projected 17.6% \nper year\u2014EDC and the project remain financially viable.26 \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe  BESS  is  a  new  technology  for  EDC.  The  lack  of  standardization  can  make  its \nprocurement  difficult.  Based  on  experience  in  other  countries  where  ADB  has  financed  such \nsystems, the project team will look for evidence during the bid evaluation that the bidders already \ndelivered  several  systems  of  the  type  being  sought  and  that  their  operational  data  has  been \nverified.  A  battery  energy  storage  engineer  was  engaged  to  support  EDC  throughout  the \nprocurement  process. 27  The  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contractor  will  be \nrequired to provide 3 years of operation and maintenance services, including knowledge transfer \nto EDC to operate and maintain the system over its 10-year lifetime. This will create the foundation \nfor EDC to scale up energy storage as part of future power system developments. \n \nEDC has sufficient staff and expertise to support the operation of transmission lines and \n30. \nsubstations after commissioning. Consultants will support in ensuring that contracts are awarded \nto qualified bidders and that construction of transmission infrastructure complies with approved \n\nSustainability \n\n26 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents Appendix 2).  \n27 Financed  through  ADB.  2018.

The project is assessed as financially viable and is expected to generate \npositive  cash  flow  contributing  to  EDC\u2019s  long-term  financial  sustainability.  Climate  adaptation \nmeasures identified in accordance with the project\u2019s climate change assessment are incorporated \nin EDC\u2019s standard designs for transmission lines and substations.28 \n \nD. \n \n31. \nEDC  has  experience  in  managing  externally  financed  projects  and  has  satisfactorily \nimplemented  previous  ADB  projects.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  the  Guidance  Note  on  Procurement-Procurement  Risk  Framework,  the \nGuidance Note on Strategic Procurement Planning, and the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time).29 The project procurement arrangements were decided with attention to value \nfor money. To achieve value for money and ensure competitive tension, the procurement is split \ninto four large packages for the transmission lines, substations, and BESS, which will be procured \nthrough  open  competitive  bidding  with \ninternational  advertisement.  The  pre-mitigation \nprocurement  risk  is  assessed  as  moderate,  mainly  because  the  capacity  of  EDC  staff  for \ntransparent open competitive bidding needs to be strengthened. \n \n32. \nThe financial management assessment of EDC was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Financial Management and Analysis of Projects, and Financial Due Diligence: A \nMethodology  Note.30 The  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  assessed  as  moderate, \nmainly because the capacity of EDC staff leaves room for improvement when it comes to financial \nmanagement, accounting, budgeting, internal controls, internal auditing, and financial reporting; \nas do the still relatively weak public financial management systems in the institutional environment \nin which the utility operates. \n \n33. \nProject implementation consultants will be engaged to give EDC staff on-the-job-training \nin  project management, including  procurement,  financial  management,  and  safeguards.  These \nactivities  will  be  complemented  by  ongoing  TAs  to  reform  the  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement practices of public sector entities in Cambodia (footnote 13). \n \nADB project team conducted integrity due diligence. An integrity risk was found to arise \n34. \nfrom adverse media in relation to one of EDC\u2019s managing directors, who was assigned to oversee \nthe implementation of this project.31 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and EDC. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \nE. \n \nThe poverty and social analysis assessed the impacts from a sector perspective, since \n35. \nidentifying specific categories or groups of consumers is difficult in the context of transmission \nnetwork  expansion.  About  one-third  of  the  population  in  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Cham, \nand Takeo provinces is considered poor. People are mainly engaged in agriculture, cattle raising, \nhandicraft  production,  and  small-scale  services.  The  average  monthly  household  income  of \nKR1,303 ($320) in these provinces is 10% lower than the national average.

A further expansion of the transmission infrastructure \nis urgently needed to (i) provide reliable electricity supply to consumers and (ii) connect remaining \nunserved households to the grid. Better service will contribute to improving people's quality of life, \nproductivity, and diversification of sources of income; and will also improve the provision of school \nand health services. In addition, many households, especially outside of Phnom Penh, are often \nnot  aware  of  the  dangers  of  electricity,  such  as  shock,  burns,  and  fire.  Also,  gender-based \nstereotypes  toward  women\u2019s  participation  in  energy  sector  activities  and  employment  make  it \ndifficult to achieve more gender equality in the sector and within EDC. The project is categorized \nas having some gender elements. Consultants will support EDC in implementing specific activities \nas described in the PAM (footnote 24) to inform communities about the safe use of electricity, \ndismantle gender-based stereotypes related to women\u2019s participation in energy sector activities \nand employment, and promote inclusion and gender equality within EDC. \n \nF. \n \n36. \ncategories are as follows. \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  EDC  conducted  an  initial  environmental  examination  and \n37. \nprepared an environmental management plan (EMP), which cover the environmental impacts and \nrisks of the four transmission lines, 10 substations, and the BESS.32 The transmission lines\u2019 right-\nof-way and the substations are in urban, peri-urban, and rural settings that include a combination \nof  agricultural  land  (paddy,  plantation,  and  economic  trees),  shrubland,  and  mixed-use  land \n(residential, commercial, industrial, and educational). No protected areas, significant bird and bat \nspecies  and  flyways,  or  other  particularly  sensitive  environmental  receptors  were  found  in  the \nareas of influence. The identified impacts are site-specific and can be reduced to an acceptable \nlevel through mitigation measures. Adverse environmental impacts will primarily occur during the \nconstruction  phase  from  solid  waste  and  vegetation  clearance,  some  earthworks  and  site \nlevelling, dust and noise, disposal of construction spoils, occupational and community health and \nsafety hazards, increased traffic, and disruption because of power outages (e.g., during towers \nerection  and  stringing  of  conductors).  The  EMP  includes  (i)  mitigation  measures  during  both \nconstruction and operation, such as the preparation of construction management plans; and (ii) \nidentification  of  responsible  parties  and  budget  for  implementation  and  monitoring.  These \nmeasures and plans will be included in the bid documents and conditions of contracts. \n \n38. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The construction of the four transmission lines, \n10 substations, and the BESS is expected to have minor involuntary resettlement impacts. The \nconstruction of the 11.1 km long 115 kV transmission line in Kampong Chhnang Province could \nimpact 107 households (539 persons). It is estimated that 0.615 hectares (ha) will be required \npermanently  for  the  construction  of  tower  footings.  The  permanent  loss  of  land  could  affect \n28 households (142 persons), including four severely affected households (16 persons) and 16 \nvulnerable  households  (83  persons).  Land  use  restrictions  (15.835  ha)  within  the  right-of-way \nmight affect 79 households (395 persons) and might result in two households (10 persons) having \nto  relocate.  A  draft  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  was  prepared  for  this \ntransmission line in accordance with government laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThe three remaining transmission lines and four of the 10 substations will be constructed on public \n\n32 The BESS will be constructed at the site of the National Solar Park substation financed by ADB (footnote 16) Initial \n\nEnvironmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fland in Phnom Penh. The land is free of encumbrances (with no adverse permanent or temporary \nimpacts on households), encroachment, or squatters. EDC prepared a resettlement due diligence \nreport  for  these  subprojects.  For  the  remaining  six  substations  to  be  constructed  in  Kampong \nChhnang, Kampong Cham, and Takeo provinces, EDC will acquire 16.6 ha of privately owned \nland from 58 households through negotiated settlement. EDC prepared a due diligence report for \nthese substations. EDC will engage an independent external party to document the negotiation \nand  settlement  processes.  The  third-party  verification  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \nclearance. EDC prepared a land acquisition and resettlement framework in case negotiations fail \nor  result  in  expropriation,  and  to  guide  any  unexpected  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts.33 \n \n39. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). Based on a social impact assessment, the project will \nneither directly nor indirectly affect indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities. Members of the Cham \nethnic group were found to be residing within 2 km or more of the project-affected area but will \nnot be affected by the project. \n \nEDC  organized  four  public  consultations  and  focus  groups  (disaggregated  by  sex) \n40. \ninvolving 184 people, including 76 women, to discuss the safeguards that will inform the project \ndesign and to assess the environmental and social impacts and risks. EDC will continue these \nconsultations during project implementation and will set up a project-specific grievance redress \nmechanism to receive, record, and facilitate the resolution of any concerns.

The average annual \nnet revenues from the BESS are sufficient to cover \nannual operating expenditures, ensuring the system\u2019s \nsustainability throughout its operating life without any \ndirect financial cost to EDC. \nCapacity will be further improved through training, with \nassistance from ADB under ADB technical assistance \n(footnote 13). Review missions will perform random \nchecks on expenditures.  \nClimate adaptation measures are incorporated in the \ndesign of transmission lines, substations, and BESS, and \nwill be reflected in bidding documents and contracts. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; BESS = battery energy storage system; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; EDC = \nElectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge; EPC = engineering, procurement, and construction. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n42. \nThe government and EDC have assured ADB that the implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \nas described in detail in the PAM and loan and grant documents.
