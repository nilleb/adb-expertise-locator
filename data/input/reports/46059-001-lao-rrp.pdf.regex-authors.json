I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic  approach  for  the  Governance  and  Capacity  Development  in  Public  Sector \nManagement  Program,  (ii)  a  proposed  policy-based  loan  to  the  Lao  People's  Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR) for subprogram 1 of the Governance and Capacity Development in Public \nSector  Management  Program,  (iii)  a  proposed  policy-based  grant  to  the  Lao  PDR  for \nsubprogram 1 of the Governance and Capacity Development in Public Sector Management \nProgram,  and  (iv)  a  proposed  grant  to  the  Lao  PDR  for  the  Governance  and  Capacity \nDevelopment in Public Sector Management Project.1 \n \n2.  The program supports the strategy of the Government of the Lao PDR to improve the \noverall  public  sector  capacity  and  governance  framework  and  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) and public administration reforms as a way to achieve sustained and \ninclusive  economic  growth.  The  program  and  the  related  capacity  development  project  is \nembedded in the Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP7), 2010\u20132015, \nwhich envisages an accountable, effective, transparent, and responsive public administration as \na key development objective to strengthen service delivery. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Improved governance in public sector management is critical to ensuring better service \ndelivery. In the Lao PDR, significant lack of resources and capacity constraints undermine the \neffectiveness of public sector management (PSM) at all levels. The underlying institutional \nweaknesses  exacerbate  expenditure  inefficiencies  in  the  achievement  of  better  budgetary \noutcomes, and affect quality of frontline services.2 Skewed planning, weak PFM, and an ad hoc \nsystem  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  arrangements  affect  strategic  allocation  of  resources. \nWeakened institutional capacities also arise in part from significant inadequacies in financial \nresources. Despite recent progress in public finance, and increased allocations for education \nand health services, budget resources are grossly inadequate when compared with the needs \nidentified in sector development plans. Local administrations, responsible for delivering most of \nthe pro-poor programs, have major capacity constraints, especially for efficient and equitable \neducation  and  health  outcomes.3 While  the  Lao  PDR  has  made  significant  progress  in \nadvancing  gender  equality,  striking  inequalities  persist  along  rural\u2013urban  lines,  geographic \nareas (north, center, and south), and between ethnic groups. These have directly contributed to \nslow achievement of critical Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n \n4.  The private sector has been identified as the main engine of growth. To overcome \npersistent resource scarcity in the public sector and chronic inefficiency, the government has \nadopted policies to facilitate the gradual transition to a private-sector-led market economy, and \nis seeking domestic and foreign direct investment (FDI) in key sectors, including agriculture, \neducation, and health, to achieve gross domestic product growth of at least 8% annually and to \naddress the financing gap under the NSEDP7. Increasing recognition of the potential of the \nagriculture and natural resources sector has led to a large flow of FDI since 2008. While FDI \nbrings capital, technology, and skills, in several instances, investments in the agriculture and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for subprograms 1 and 2 is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank. 2010. Lao People's Democratic Republic: Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability: Public \nFinancial Management Assessment. Washington, DC. \n3  World Bank. 2008. Lao PDR: Public Expenditure Tracking Survey in Primary Education and Primary Health. \nWashington, DC. \n ", "2   \nnatural  resources  sector,  arising  from  highly  discretionary  large-scale  land  concession \nagreements, has led to environmentally and socially damaging results. The government also \nfaces a growing governance and institutional gap, and lacks the capacity both at the national \nand the local government levels to implement and enforce the current law on investment to \nensure long-term sustainability and widespread social gains. Gaps remain in enforcement of \nland concession agreements and public sector capacity to enforce contracts. Doing Business \n2012 ranks the Lao PDR 182 among 183 economies in investor protection and 165 in ease of \ndoing business overall.4 \n \n5.  Government commitment. Governance is a key strategic priority under the NSEDP7. \nThe  government  has  adopted  several  measures,  including  a  long-term  strategic  plan,  to \nimplement public sector governance reforms. The government is committed to strengthening the \nPFM  system  under  the  ongoing  Public  Financial  Management  Strengthening  Program \n(PFMSP).5 Revenue  management  arrangements  for  the  Nam  Theun  2  and  Nam  Ngum  3 \nhydropower projects commit the government to using hydropower revenues to achieve poverty \nreduction  and  environmental  management  goals  through  strategic  allocation  of  budget \nresources. The National Governance and Public Administration Reforms (NGPAR), 2011\u20132015 \nseek to ensure an accountable and effective civil service at all levels. Major political reforms are \nunder way to strengthen districts as the primary administrative units for service delivery, as a \nprecursor  to  fundamental  reforms  in  intergovernmental  financial  arrangements.  In  addition, \ngender  equality  and  women\u2018s  empowerment  issues  have  been  prioritized  in  the  national \ndevelopment plans, including the National Strategy for the Advancement of Women (NSAW), \n2011\u20132015. The business regulatory environment continues to be streamlined and a broad \nrange of economic reforms has resulted in an improved investment climate, trade, and private \nsector development. The Lao PDR is geographically well placed to attract foreign investment \nfrom the rest of the Greater Mekong Subregion and from the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations, and private sector participation. \n \n6.  Support  to  strengthen  public  sector  capacity  is  a  key  theme  across  the  country \npartnership  strategy  core  sectors.  The  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u201320166 and  the \ncountry operations business plan, 2012\u201320147 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the \nLao  PDR  recognize  governance  as  a key  driver  of  change. The  2010  country  assistance \nprogram evaluation recognized the importance of PSM in improving public sector governance.8 \nSince  2001,  ADB  has  provided  continued  support  through a cluster of technical assistance \nprojects to address institutional and capacity weaknesses focusing on (i) PFM subsystems \nrelating to budget formulation, reporting, and accounting; and (ii) external audit by the State Audit \nOrganization (SAO). During 2006\u20132011, ADB also supported medium-term fiscal and expenditure \nframeworks. In addition, the implementation of several projects under the education and health \nsectors strengthened the capacity for budget planning and execution in the sector ministries. \nDesign of the proposed program builds on these legacy works. \n \n7.   Lessons  and  complex  nature  of  governance  reforms.  Key  lessons  from \nimplementing PFM and civil service reforms in a capacity-constrained environment require that \na step-by-step approach is followed to allow changes to be introduced gradually. A longer time \nframe is a prerequisite for external assistance given the ground realities and weak starting point. \n                                                \n4  World Bank. 2011.

These lessons have been incorporated into the \ndesign of the program. \n \n8.  The  program  priorities  are  aligned  with  government  reform  priorities,  and  are  well \ncoordinated with development partners. The program is consistent with key objectives of the \nNSEDP7 that underline the link between good governance and broader development goals. \nSupport to the PFMSP, NGPAR, and NSAW goals maximizes harmonization and ownership. \nUsing a programmatic approach, the program seeks to sequence high-impact policy reforms, \nwhich allows reforms to be phased over the medium term. Development partners recognize that \nthe lack of institutional capacity in the public sector is a crosscutting challenge. The World Bank, \nthe  European  Union,  and  Australia  represented  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  are  supporting  the  PFMSP  to  strengthen  PSM  through  a  series  of  poverty \nreduction  support  operations  and  complementary  technical  assistance  via  a  World  Bank-\nmanaged  multidonor  trust  fund.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is  the  lead \nagency in public administration reforms.9 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The program impact will be improved delivery of key public services. The  program \noutcome will be strengthened national and subnational PSM. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.   Link  between  subprograms  1  and  2.  The  program  comprises  two  subprograms, \nfacilitating a concerted policy dialogue on the basis of an agreed program policy matrix related \nto key government reforms and sector priorities. In addition,  the program provides a clear \nfinancing framework for the government over the medium term. The program policy matrix \nincludes  reforms  completed  prior  to  consideration  of  subprogram  1  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors, and indicative triggers for subprogram 2 to facilitate continuous dialogue with the \ngovernment (Appendix 4).  \n \n11.  Subprogram  1  supports  the government\u2018s  efforts  through (i)  implementing multiyear \nbudgeting and intergovernmental fiscal relations; (ii) strengthening civil service capacity at the \ncentral  and  subnational  level,  including  gender-responsive  capacity;  and  (iii)  strengthening \ninvestment  management  capacity  in  the  public  sector  for  private  sector  investments  and \nidentifying potential public\u2013private partnership (PPP) arrangements. Reform in these areas will \nbe key policy pillars under subprograms 1 and 2. Under subprogram 1, the government began \nundertaking these reforms in January 2010, and all 19 policy measures required for subprogram \n1 were completed. Subprogram 2 specifies 11 triggers (prior actions that are to be completed \nbefore submission to the Board) that need to be satisfactorily accomplished by mid-2014. These \ntriggers advance accomplishments under subprogram 1.   \n \n12.  Output  1:  Multiyear  budgeting  and  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations \nimplemented. The government\u2018s PFM system continues to be strengthened under the PFMSP, \nand a medium-term implementation plan 2011\u20132015 monitors progress. The overall legislative \nframework and basic orderliness of budget processes has improved. Budget timetables are \nbetter aligned with budget execution.  A draft public finance development strategy in support of \nthe NSEDP7 is under consideration. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) had undertaken capacity \ndevelopment for implementation of medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), in line with the \n                                                \n9  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4   \nmandate of the 2006 State Budget Law and the 2009 Budget Implementation Decree. MTEF \nlinks policy, planning, and budgeting to improve efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. \nKey government staff members in the MOF, the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES), and \nthe Ministry of Health (MOH) were trained to develop medium-term fiscal and expenditure \nframeworks. The MOF budget instruction for FY2012 required the MOES and MOH to prepare \nmedium-term budget projections for FY2012\u2013FY2015 on a pilot basis, but much effort will be \nneeded to institutionalize a MTEF during the implementation of subprogram 2. The government \nis committed to increasing total budget resources by 18% for the education sector and 9% for \nthe health sector under the national budget. The MOES allocated $30 million in August 2010 \nunder the Education for All \u2013 Fast Track Initiative Program that targeted increased enrolment of \ngirls in primary schools in remote and ethnic areas. \n \n13.  A new set of accounting regulations for implementing the 2007 Law on State Accounting \nwas approved by the minister of finance (Regulation 1325) in June 2010, and ministry and \nprovincial staff were trained to strengthen accounting functions. All line ministries at the center \nand the provinces have access to government financial information system for transaction \nprocessing. In addition, Budget, Treasury, and other departments of the MOF are connected to \nthe GFIS to improve budget reporting. Under subprogram 2, the MOF will make efforts to \ncomply with the requirements of the 2007 Law on State Accounting, initially on a cash basis, \nthrough the phased adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards. The SAO has \nrecently  finalized  an  implementation  plan  for  institutional  strengthening  and  professional \ndevelopment,  identifying  immediate  and  longer-term  support,  and  has  prepared  a  detailed \ncapacity development plan for procurement audit for implementation during 2012\u20132014. To \nstrengthen legislative support to audit reports, the economic planning finance committee (EPFC) \nof  the  National  Assembly  and  SAO  has  developed  draft  rules  of  procedure  to  improve \ncoordination and strengthen discussion and examination of the audit reports by the EPFC. The \nSAO and EPFC are committed to the approval of the draft rules and to continue strengthening \nlegislative oversight of public expenditure during the subprogram 2 implementation period. \n \n14.  Since the approval of the State Budget Law in 2006, the Lao PDR has successfully \nimplemented critical reforms of the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. In particular, it has \nrecentralized the revenue functions (the Treasury, Customs, and Tax administration offices). \nImportantly,  the  reforms  have  contributed  to  increased  revenue  collection  since  FY2006\u2013\nFY2007. The MOF has also prepared a decree on budget norms that should rationalize the \nsystem of budget appropriation to the major spending ministries such as Education and Health. \nThe MOF has recently established a working committee to examine issues concerned with \namendment of the 2006 State Budget Law. The current strategy in the Lao PDR is to strengthen \nthe basic pillars of the deconcentrated fiscal system, and develop the role of districts as the key \nlevel of administration for service delivery, including transfers directly to the districts, initially as \na pilot. In the area of fiscal transfers, further efforts will be made to shift to a transparent and \nformula-based mechanism for the distribution of tax revenues to be shared between the central \nand subnational administrations over the subprogram 2 implementation period. \n \n15.  Output 2: Civil service capacity at the central and subnational levels, including \ngender-responsive  capacity,  strengthened.  Governance  reforms  are  gradually  being \nmainstreamed, underlined by a strong political commitment from the Ninth Party Congress. The \nMinistry of Home Affairs (MOHA) has prepared a draft governance strategy for 2011\u20132020 that \naims to improve the public service, strengthen the rule of law and people\u2018s representation and \nparticipation, and improve PFM. A strategy to promote gender equality in public administration is \nunder consideration by the government so as to support gender-sensitive policy and programs \nrelated to governance reforms. A national leading committee has been established to guide the \nimplementation of the government\u2018s governance reforms. In a significant decision to strengthen \n ", "  5 \ninstitutional focus, the MOHA became a full fledged ministry in June 2011, responsible for \ngovernance-related reforms and addressing systemic weaknesses within the civil service. To \nsupport the implementation of the strategy for the advancement of women, the Division for the \nAdvancement of Women was established in the MOHA. The NGPAR, 2011\u20132015 was approved \nby the prime minister in February 2012 to ensure an accountable, effective, and responsible \nadministration and civil service. A program board for NGPAR implementation, chaired by the \ndeputy prime minister, has been constituted. The Public Administration Research and Training \nInstitute was established in 2011 to lead and coordinate research and training on civil service \nissues at the national and subnational levels. The MOHA continued to lead efforts to strengthen \nMDG-focused service delivery in 35 districts through the District Development Fund (DDF).10  \nBased on the prime minister\u2018s order in June 2012, the MOHA is also working out the policy \nframework and institutional processes needed to (i) build awareness and disseminate the nature \nof reforms to strengthen districts, initially as a pilot for 1 year (two districts in each province); \nand (ii) build on lessons learned. Under subprogram 2, the MOHA and other stakeholders are \ncommitted to strengthening implementation and monitoring of the strategic plan on governance, \nincluding the strategy for the promotion of gender equality by the National Leading Committee \nand the NGPAR Program Board. Effective implementation of the NGPAR will ensure enhanced \nskills and competencies for a modern public administration system through greater and more \nfocused training, including gender-responsive training in the Public Administration Research and \nTraining  Institute.  The  MOHA  will  continue  to  lead,  coordinate,  and  support  measures  to \nstrengthen district administrations to perform efficiently for improved service delivery over the \nsubprogram 2 implementation period. \n \n16.  Policies and processes related to gender equality are gradually being mainstreamed. \nThe  National  Commission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  (NCAW),  responsible  for  the \npromotion of gender equality and  the empowerment of women, has developed its second \nNSAW, for 2011\u20132015. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) approved the \nFive\u2013Year Strategy for the Advancement of Women in Agriculture and Forestry Sector, 2011\u2013\n2015 in May 2012, supporting women\u2018s increased access to resources and decision-making \npositions. As part of strengthening capacity at the district level, a number of trainings were \norganized to improve gender-sensitive planning, monitoring, and evaluation, including gender-\nspecific  health  issues  on  improving  service  delivery  for  maternal  and  child  health.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the MAF and NCAW will continue to monitor the implementation of action plans \nand sector targets developed under the NSAW, 2011\u20132015 and the Five\u2013Year Strategy for the \nAdvancement of Women in Agriculture and Forestry Sector. \n \n17.  Output 3: Investment management capacity in the public sector for private sector \ninvestments  and  identifying  potential  public\u2013private  partnership  arrangements \nstrengthened. 11 Land concessions issued have resulted in losses of anticipated revenues and \nraised  a  number  of  governance  challenges  with  regard  to  promoting  sustainable  land \nmanagement. The government established the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment \n(MONRE) in 2011 to improve the enforcement of land concession agreements, contracts, and \nstrengthen interagency coordination in order to avoid overlap in mandates at various levels, \nincluding measures to develop capacity. The government has recently issued a moratorium on \nconcessions for 2 years pending review of the existing policies and legal framework, and \nendorsed  the  revised  Technical  Guidelines  on  Compensation  and  Resettlement  of  People \n                                                \n10 DDF supports administrative capacities for delivering local government services that primarily supports expansion \nof infrastructure to improve service delivery at kum ban (a cluster of villages) and district levels. DDF facility is \nintended to operate as a stimulus and foundation for intergovernment fiscal transfers. \n11 Public Sector Capacity for Management of Investments in Land and Private Sector Participation through Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnerships \u2013 A Background Note for the Proposed ADB Capacity Development Support (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents from Appendix 2). \n ", "6   \nAffected  by  Development  Projects  in  June  2011.  Training  on  social  safeguards  (including \ngender issues in resettlement) was also provided to staff of the MONRE and line agencies from \nthree provinces and nine districts. Two working groups are finalizing the National Land Master \nPlan and the National Land Policy to further streamline land management. Subprogram 2 will \nsupport further measures for training and to strengthen capacity to screen, award, and monitor \ninvestment proposals by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), MAF, and MONRE. \n \n18.  The government is seriously looking at PPP models to meet the funding gap in the social \nsector. Since 2010, the MPI, MAF, MOES, and MOH have strengthened the policy framework \nfor enlisting private sector investment.12 The government is identifying policy measures required \nto  strengthen  the  enabling  investment  environment  to  promote  PPPs  in  the  Lao  PDR, \nspecifically  in  the  health  and  education  sectors  to  start  with.  A  draft  PPP  policy  is  being \nconsidered  by  the  government.  It  is  expected  that  upon  adoption  of  the  PPP  policy  the \ngovernment will develop a combination of policy and regulatory reforms\u2014including institutional \nsupport,  incentives,  and  financing  modalities\u2014to  increase  incentives  for  private  sector \nparticipation  in  financing,  developing,  and  managing  future  infrastructure  and  development \nprojects.  Under  subprogram  1,  ADB  facilitated  a  number  of  strategic  policy  dialogues  to \nstrengthen advocacy to foster an enabling framework for PPPs. Under subprogram 2, the MPI \nwill seek to finalize the PPP policy framework, and adopt measures to develop an appropriate \nlegal and regulatory framework. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n19.   To support the government reform initiatives outlined in the program, tentative financing \nneeds of $20 million have been identified. For subprogram 1, the government has requested a \nsingle tranche loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR1,655,000 and a single tranche grant \nnot  exceeding  $7.5 million,  in  each  case from  ADB\u2018s  Special  Funds  resources  to finance \nsubprogram 1. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The \nloan and grant will be subject to such other terms and conditions substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft financing agreement. The policy-based loan and grant reflects \nthe development financing needs based on estimated gross external borrowings for 2012\u20132013 \nof $218.0 million to implement development projects, including the proposed loan and grant \nunder subprogram 1. Financing of subprogram 2 will also come from Special Fund resources \nand is estimated at $10 million. Additional budget resources for subprogram 2 are to be utilized \nfor ensuring sustainability of the reforms under subprogram 1, with special focus on a greater \nlevel of public financing for the education and health sectors for improved service delivery. \nDuring 2010\u20132012, the net increases in the government budget for the education and health \nsectors (excluding foreign assistance) was about $88 million. Given that these sectors are \nsignificantly underfunded, the budget increases will readily exceed the amount of ADB financing \nover the medium term. The policy adjustment cost to the government of implementing and \ncomplying with the reform measures is estimated at $24 million. \n \n20.  Implementation  arrangements  for  the  program.  The  implementation  period  for \nsubprogram 1 is from January 2010 to July 2012, and the implementation period for subprogram \n2 is from August 2012 to September 2014. The executing agency for the program will be the \nMOF, which will also be responsible for the overall coordination and disbursement of resources \nunder the programmatic approach. A program steering committee, chaired by the vice-minister \n                                                \n12 MPI: Investment Promotion Law 2009, National Investment Strategy 2011, and Prime Minister\u2018s Decree 119 for \nImplementation of the New Investment Promotion Law; MAF: Agricultural Development Strategy 2010; MOES: \nMinisterial Decree 113 of 29/3/2011 promoting private education; MONRE: State Land Law 2002; and MOH: Health \nFinancing Strategy, 2011\u20132015 and Seventh Five-Year Health Sector Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n ", "  7 \nof finance, will oversee the implementation of the program and provide overall guidance. The \nMAF, MONRE, MPI, MOH, MOHA, MOES, NCAW, and SAO will be the implementing agencies. \nAs  the  executing  agency,  the  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of \nsubprogram  1  including  disbursements,  maintenance  of  all  program  records,  and \ncommunicating with ADB on behalf of the government. \n \n21.  Procurement and disbursement arrangements. The policy-based loan and grant for \nsubprogram 1 will be released in a single tranche, following loan and grant effectiveness. The \nclosing date of the loan and grant will be 31 March 2013. The government will primarily use the \nlocal currency counterpart funds generated by the loan and grant proceeds to meet program \nexpenditures and associated costs of reform. The proceeds of the subprogram 1 loan and grant \nwill be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB's Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.13 Before withdrawing any funds, the \ngovernment will open or nominate a deposit account with the Bank of the Lao PDR to receive \nthe  loan  and  grant  proceeds.  The  account  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2018s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time). \nADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan and grant proceeds, and to verify the \naccuracy of the government\u2018s certification for the withdrawal application. \n \nIII.  PROJECT GRANT FOR CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT \n \n22.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $6 million from ADB\u2018s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project. Implementation will require technical inputs and \ntargeted on-the-job support, given the weak civil service capacity to undertake public sector \nreforms  and  to  meaningfully  engage  with  the  private  sector.  The  project  will  have  three \ncomponents:  (i)  strengthening  multiyear  budgeting  and  intergovernmental  financial \narrangements; (ii) strengthening civil service management reforms and administrative capacity, \nincluding support to the NCAW; and (iii) strengthening investment management capacity in the \npublic sector and for PPP initiatives. The project is estimated to cost $6.5 million. ADB will \nfinance $6 million equivalent from ADB's Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), \nincluding applicable taxes, duties, and bank charges. The government contribution will be $0.5 \nmillion equivalent through in-kind contributions of counterpart staff and various facilities. The \nproject administration manual (PAM) outlines the proposed activities under the project grant, \nand will be further refined prior to implementation.14 The project financing plan and project \ninvestment plan are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank (Asian Development Fund)  6.00  92.31 \nGovernment  0.50  7.69 \nTotal  6.50  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The project implementation period will be from January 2013 to 31 July 2016. At the \nrequest and on behalf of the government, ADB will assist in the selection of consultants while the \nMOHA will sign and administer the contract with the consultants, following ADB\u2018s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) for the loan project or grant-financed \nproject.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The  program  will  have  allocative  efficiency  gains  from  the  reallocation  of  financial \nresources to development priorities with higher rates of socioeconomic returns. The program will \nresult in greater budget for the education and health sectors, and the expected expenditure \nefficiencies will be achieved through a medium-term budget. In addition, the government's plans \nto strengthen districts will potentially lead to better assignment of functions and better service \ndelivery  of key  MDGs. Enforcement  and  effective  supervision  of  large-scale  private sector \ninvestment in agriculture and potential PPPs will have large potential economic spin-offs. As \nreforms progress and regulatory changes are adopted, more accurate quantification of reform \nbenefits and costs will be possible by the subprogram 2 in 2014.15 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n25.  The government is committed to strengthening its PFM system through the PFMSP. A \nnew procurement decree, implementing rules and regulations, a standard procurement manual, \nand standard bidding documents have improved procurement practice. The government has \ntaken credible measures to strengthen key oversight agencies such as the SAO, and has \nadopted the Law on Anti-Corruption, Law on State Inspection, Law on Complaints and State \nAudit, and Law on State Accounting. ADB\u2018s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government and the executing agencies. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, Gender, and Development \n \n26.  The program is a general intervention, which will indirectly reduce poverty by improving \nimplementation of programs targeting poor and vulnerable groups. The key gender issues \nimpacted by the program include (i) gender gaps in education in poor, rural, remote, and ethnic \ngroup areas; (ii) high maternal mortality as a result of lack of access to emergency obstetric \ncare and skilled attendants at birth, and financial barriers; (iii) limited women\u2018s participation in \ndecision  making;  and  (iv)  lack  of gender  awareness  and gender-sensitive  capacity  of civil \nservants to support service delivery. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n27.  The  program  does  not  trigger  safeguard  policies  and  is  classified  category  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, impact on indigenous peoples, and impact on the environment. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n28.   Implementation of the program faces three potential risks (Table 4), described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan. 16  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPotential external risks may arise from a prolonged global  Highest political leadership has strong commitment to \nand  regional  economic  downturn,  deterioration  in  focus on supply-side public investment and reduce \nmacroeconomic conditions, and inherent volatility in prices  reliance on the mining sector. \nof key commodities. \n                                                \n15 Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nInstitutional  and  implementation  risks  from  weak  This  risk  is  partially  mitigated  through  sustained \nadministrative  capacity  to  implement  new  policies and  technical assistance from development partners,  as \npublic  financial  management  and  public  administration  well as the proposed capacity development project \nreforms  grant. \nInstitutional resistance to change, including gap between  Efforts are under way by the government to strengthen \nlegislation and the cumbersome procedures actually faced  regulation and supervision, and to improve ease of \nby the private sector  doing business and enforce contracts. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n29.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 1 and the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM, the financing agreement, and grant agreement. The government has agreed with \nADB on certain covenants for subprogram 1 and the project, which are set forth in the financing \nagreement  and  grant  agreement.  The  conditions  for  loan  and  grant  effectiveness  are  the \nestablishment of (i) the program steering committee in the MOF, and (ii) a project management \nunit for each of the three components of the project. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n30.
