(OAP IV) is a private equity fund established as a Cayman \nIslands exempted limited partnership with an expected fund size of $650 million. OrbiMed Asia \nGeneral Partner IV, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, is the general partner \nof  OAP  IV.  The  adviser  of  the  general  partner  and  the  fund  manager,  OrbiMed  Advisors  LLC \n(OrbiMed), is a limited liability company incorporated in Delaware, United States (US).1 OrbiMed \nwas established in  1989  and  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  largest  health  care-dedicated  investors  with \nabout $14 billion in assets under management as of 31 March 2020.2 This is a second follow-on \nequity investment by ADB into a health care fund managed by OrbiMed.3 \n \n3. \nOAP IV is expected to provide mainly growth capital to health care companies operating \nin India and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) across the biopharma, medical technology, \nhealth  care  services,  diagnostics,  and  distribution  subsectors.  Since  OAP  IV  is  a  health  care \nfocused  fund,  no  climate  change  impact  is  expected  from  this  investment.  The  ongoing \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  is  driving  the  need  for  higher  health  care  capacity \nreserves and stimulating direct demand for health care services and products, as well as  hard \nand soft health infrastructure across the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADBs) developing member \ncountries. In this context, ADB\u2019s proposed investment in OAP IV is expected to be highly catalytic \nin  developing  effective  long  term  solutions  and  responses  to  global  health  care  crises  by \nenhancing disease detection and treatment and response capacities in India and the PRC. \n\n4. \nEven  though  OAP  IV  is  a  health  care  focused  fund,  the  proposed  investment  is  not \ncategorized as  a  COVID-19  response  project  because OrbiMed  did  not specifically  design  the \nfund to address COVID-19 related issues. Instead, the fund has a broader and longer-term focus \ngiven  its  aim  of  seeking  equity  investments  in  established  and  growing  companies  across the \nhealth care segment in India and PRC.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n5. \nOAP IV, however, could potentially end up supporting companies involved in COVID-19 \nresponses given OrbiMed\u2019s global expertise and focus on health care. The blind pool nature of \nprivate  equity  funds  further  means  that  investors  in  the  fund  (including  ADB)  do  not  know  the \ncomposition of the OAP IV\u2019s portfolio at the time of our investment. Therefore, it is not possible to \nestimate the COVID-19 impact of the fund\u2019s investments ex-ante.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n6. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n \n\n \n\n1  In this report, references to OrbiMed are to OrbiMed Advisors LLC. \n2  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)].. \n\n3   ADB\u2019s earlier investments in OrbiMed-managed funds include: (i) ADB.

The investment in OAP IV is a continuation of ADB\u2019s efforts to \nincrease nonsovereign financing support to the critical health care sector and an endorsement of \nOrbiMed as a strong health care partner for ADB in the Asia and Pacific region. OrbiMed is unique \nbecause it is the first Asian regional dedicated health care fund manager with expertise across \nthe entire health care spectrum.

In  addition  to  the  investment  committee,  OAP  IV  will  have  an \nadvisory  committee  of  up  to  seven  members  representing  OAP  IV\u2019s  limited  partners  to  be \nappointed  by  the  general  partner.  ADB  is  expected  to  be  represented  on  OAP  IV\u2019s  advisory \ncommittee, which will opine on matters related to potential conflicts of interest, exercise its right \nto  consent  to  certain  matters  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  limited  partnership \nagreement, and act in an advisory role to the general partner and its advisor. \n \nD. \n \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access \nto Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nFinancial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n \nA. \n \nADB intends to make an equity investment of up to $75 million in OAP IV, representing \n18. \n11.5%  of  the  expected  fund  size.

The  general  partner  will  be  required  to  provide  ADB  with \nunaudited  quarterly  reports,  audited  annual reports  with  financial  statements,  a fund overview, \nannual  development  effectiveness  monitoring  reports,  and  an  overview  of  the  portfolio  with \nsummary information on each portfolio company\u2019s performance. ADB will review this information \nand follow up with the general partner if more information or clarification is needed. If the information \nreceived from the general partner raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in \nOAP IV, ADB could decide to put OAP IV on a watch list for more frequent and detailed review. \n \nD. \n \nCatalytic anchor role. OrbiMed continues to demonstrate to institutional investors that a \n22. \ndedicated  health  care  private  equity  fund  is  an  investable  asset  in  Asia.  ADB's  ongoing \nparticipation in the Asia platform provides new investors with the necessary comfort and validation \nof  the  strategy,  team  and  health  care market  opportunities  in  Asia.  [This  information  has  been \nremoved as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. \n17.2.(v)]. As one of the major anchor investors, ADB\u2019s continued support of OrbiMed provides the \nearly  validation  needed  to  secure  commitments  from  such  new  institutions,  thereby  enabling \nOrbiMed to successfully raise its largest targeted Asia fund since inception in 2008. \n \n23. \nIncreased  gender  inclusiveness.  OrbiMed  has  committed  to  working  with  ADB  to \nexplore  and  adopt  measures  to  achieve  a more gender  equitable  work  force  at  OAP  IV.  As  a \nresult, ADB aims to secure a gender categorization for the investment of some gender elements. \n \n24. \nEnvironmental,  social,  and  governance  standards.  ADB's  participation  will  obligate \nOrbiMed to ensure that OAP IV's investee companies comply with ADB's environment and social \nsafeguard  standards,  and  to  report  on  development  indicators.  ADB's  role,  along  with  other \nmembers of OAP IV's advisory committee, will also be to assist in providing oversight on important \ngovernance  matters,  which  are  critical  for  investee  companies  to  demonstrate  as  they  seek \nadditional sources of growth capital from institutional and/or individual investors. \n \nE. \n \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n\f[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n25. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n26. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n27. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n28. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n29. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n30. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n31. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n32. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n33. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n34. \nImpact.  The  project  is  aligned  with the  following  impact:  funding  increased  to  enhance \ncapacity and resilience of health care systems to fight and control pandemic outbreaks in Asia, \nparticularly in India and the PRC. \n \n35.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: financial and social sustainability \nof  private  equity  investments  in  innovative  health  care  companies  demonstrated,  such  as \ncompanies  producing  or  distributing  essential  medicines  or  vaccines,  introducing  innovative \nmedicines,  medical  devices  or  diagnostics,  or  providing  health  care  services  targeting  lower-\nincome segments or rural or peri-urban markets, while also generating additional employment. \n \n36.  Outputs. The outputs of the project are (i) OAP IV established and (ii) gender equality of \nOAP IV\u2019s operations increased. \n \nB. \n \n37. \nConsistency with ADB strategy. The investment in OAP IV aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030  operational  priority  1,  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  which \nmandates  ADB  to  undertake  efforts  to  contribute  to  the  overarching  goal  of  universal  health \ncoverage and to generate quality jobs to support inclusive growth for all. This engagement also \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\naccelerates  progress  in  gender  equality  and  contributes  to  operational  priority  2,  accelerating \nprogress in gender equality. \n \n38. \nConsistency with country strategies. The investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 and country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u2013\n2020, which include support for the countries\u2019 health sectors as strategic priorities. \n \n39. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  investment  in \nOAP IV is consistent with ADB\u2019s operational plan for health, which strongly supports private sector \napproaches to improve quality, affordability, and accessibility in the health sector.5 \n \n40. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n4 \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n\n \nA. \n \n41. \nStatement (2009).6 \n \n42. \nCategory  FI.  ADB  has  assessed  the  investment's  potential  environmental  and  social \nimpacts,  its risks  associated  with  OrbiMed\u2019s  existing  and  likely  OAP IV future portfolio,  and  its \ncommitment and capacity for environmental and social management. During due diligence, ADB \nhas identified the following actions to enhance the environmental and social management system \n(ESMS):  improve  the  pre-capital  call  process  for  investment  screening  notification  to  ADB, \ndevelop  subsector-specific  environmental  risk  and  regulatory  compliance  screening  checklists, \nimplement a training plan based on identified needs of the OAP IV investment team, and refine \nannual  environmental  and  social  performance  reporting.  OrbiMed  has  agreed  to  required \nenhancements to the ESMS and such will be applied prior to first capital call for an investment. \nOrbiMed will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments using \nADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by applicable national laws \nand regulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB before \ndisbursement.7 The ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national \nlabor  laws  and  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards, \npursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy. ADB will retain the right to opt out of contributing \ncapital to any investment categorized as A, and any investment categorized as B for involuntary \nresettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  impacts.  The  ESMS  will  also  contain  requirements,  as \napplicable,  for  information  disclosure  and consultation with  affected  people in  accordance  with \nADB requirements. OrbiMed will include in its annual reporting information to ADB (i) the nature \nof  subprojects  and  categorization,  (ii)  compliance  with  the  safeguard  and  social  requirements, \nand (iii) compliance with applicable national and international laws and standards. \n \n\n \n\n4  ADB.  2017.

Following  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  OAP  IV  has  incorporated  measures  to  promote \ngender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Key features of the gender actions are (i) promoting \nat least one female staff member to vice-president or senior associate; (ii) starting a mentorship \nprogram in OrbiMed\u2019s Asia offices that includes at least 50% of female investment professionals; \nand (iii) recruiting a female lead in India for environmental, social, and governance issues. OAP \nIV will submit periodic reports on its implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB. \n \n44.
