The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for Support for Integrated and Sustainable Urban Development along Mass Rapid \nTransit Corridors in Bengaluru City, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \nThe project will support the Government of India in expanding the metro railway network \n2. \nin Bengaluru city by financing two new metro corridors totaling 56 kilometers (km) in length. The \nproject  will  also  support  the  preparation  of  urban  development  plans  and  implementation \nframeworks  based  on  the  principles  of  transit-oriented  development  (TOD)  and  multimodal \nintegration (MMI). In addition, the project will improve the institutional capacity of relevant state \ngovernment  agencies  and  stakeholders  at  all  levels  for  the  delivery  of  sustainable  and \ncomprehensive  urban  mobility  solutions  and  planning,  designing,  and  managing  TOD-based \nurban development schemes and programs. The project will improve mobility, livability, and the \nurban  environment  in  Bengaluru  by  supporting  provision  of  an  efficient,  safe,  and  inclusive \ntransport  system  for  all  commuters  that  caters  to  the  needs  of  elderly,  women,  children,  and \ndifferently abled persons. The project is included in the country operations business plan for India, \n2020\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nBengaluru city. Bengaluru is the capital city of the state of Karnataka in southern India.2 \n3. \nIt  is  India\u2019s  fourth  most  populous  city  and  one  of  the  largest  and  fastest-growing  metropolitan \nareas in the country, with an estimated population of 12.34 million in its urban area as of 2017, \nup from 8.5 million in 2011.3 Bengaluru district is the most urbanized in Karnataka state, with 91% \nof its population living in urban areas. The city is a leading center of high-technology industries \nand information technology (IT), including robotics, biotechnology and engineering, electronics, \nand  IT-enabled  services.  Manufacturing,  services,  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  in \ndiversified sectors also make significant contributions to the local economy. \n \n4. \nUrban environment. The population of Bengaluru grew 49% from 2000 to 2018. Migration \nfrom other areas in Karnataka and elsewhere, driven by work  opportunities, has accounted for \nabout  30%  of  that  growth.4 It  is  expected  that  the  population  of  Bengaluru  city  will  reach  16.2 \nmillion by 2030, from about 11.4 million in 2018.5 The rapid pace of urbanization has not been \nwithout  problems,  which  include  urban  sprawl,  unplanned  and/or  sporadic  development,  and \ninadequate infrastructure. This has resulted in congestion, declining mobility for people and goods, \nhigh  land  prices,  deteriorating  infrastructure,  and  environmental  degradation.  These  impacts \nreduce productivity, inhibit economic efficiency, and negatively affect quality of life. Although the \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2020\u20132022.

Bengaluru. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has slowed economic activity in the city, the trend of population \ngrowth and urbanization is expected to continue. \n \n5. \nTransport  congestion. Rapid  population  growth  and  urbanization,  a  lack  of  integrated \nurban planning, and lagging transport network development have contributed to Bengaluru being \none of the most congested cities in the world.6 Peak hour traffic congestion in the city is worse \nthan in other major cities in India, including Delhi and Mumbai, and the cost of congestion in the \ncity  is  estimated  at  $6  billion  per  year. 7 Vast  urban  sprawl  is  lengthening  the  average  travel \ndistance and time for commuters, especially for those travelling by private vehicle, while average  \ntravel speeds have been steadily declining.8 \n \n6. \nPublic  transport.  Compared  with  other  Indian  megacities,  Bengaluru  relies  heavily  on \nroad transport (footnote 7). Public transport in the city consists of railway, bus, and metro rail. The \nrailway is mainly used for intercity services, although a few morning and evening suburban trains \nserve commuters living outside the city. Public bus service is the mainstay, mainly operated by \nBangalore  Metropolitan  Transport  Corporation,  with  a  fleet  of  6,000  city  buses  providing \ntransportation to more than 3.5 million passengers per day.9 However, city bus travel has been \nadversely  affected  by  the  rising  congestion  and  declining  average  travel  speeds  on  the  city\u2019s \nroads.  Average  daily  ridership  of  buses  declined  from  5.0  million  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2014  to \n3.5 million in FY2019.10 Inadequate public transport and growth in family incomes in Bengaluru \nhave  resulted  in  a  sharp  increase  in  private  vehicles  on  the  roads.  The  number  of  registered \nvehicles in Bengaluru city rose from 3.2 million in 2009 to 8.6 million in 2020.11 A 2016 survey \nfound that about 91% of respondent households would be willing to shift to an improved public \ntransport system if it offers attractive savings in travel time and cost.12 \n \n7. \nRoad network. The total road length in the city boundary is about 2,537 km, 20% of which \nis of four lanes or more. The major roads are the Outer Ring Road (ORR) and six radial arterial \nroads stretching outward from the city center. The ORR, with a length of about 60 km, envelops \nBengaluru\u2019s core. Most government, business, commercial, and institutional establishments are \nwithin  or  along  the  ORR.  This  has  led  to  high  pressure  on  housing,  civic  infrastructure,  traffic \ncongestion, and pollution. Radial roads and the ORR are heavily congested, and intersections of \nthe ORR and radial roads are often gridlocked despite efforts to improve the roads and construct \nflyovers. The road network inside the ORR is already close to capacity, and little land is available \nto  strengthen  the  transport  system  because  of  high  land  prices  and  dense  development.  The \nnewer business zones are mainly located along the ORR and along the north\u2013south axis outside \nthe ORR. Meanwhile, outside the ORR, accessibility to transport is constrained because of a less \ndense  road  network  and  fewer  public  transport  services.  New  circular  roads  outside  the  ORR \nhave been proposed and discussed for years, but not implemented. \n \n\n \n\n6  ADB. 2019. Fostering Growth and Inclusion in Asia\u2019s Cities.

Multinational  IT  and  IT-enabled  service  industries \n8. \nemploying numerous professionals are located in IT parks along  the ORR, and along National \nHighway 44 (NH-44). A radial arterial road stretching northeast from the city core, NH-44, is the \nmain access road for Bengaluru\u2019s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA).13 NH-44 is the locus \nfor the growing peri-urban areas north and northeast of Bengaluru, where land is available and \nKIA  acts  as  a  development magnet.  This  has  catalyzed residential  and  industrial  development \nbetween Bengaluru city and the town of Devanahalli to the north. The ORR and NH-44 form the \nmain access route from the north to the city.  \n \n9. \nBengaluru Metro. Metro rail is the newest form of public transport in the city. Established \nin  2005  as  a  special  purpose  vehicle  jointly  held  by  the  Government  of  India  and  the  State \nGovernment of Karnataka, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) constructed and \noperates the Bengaluru Metro. Phase 1 of Bengaluru Metro, which is 42.3 km long, was completed \nand  became  fully  operational  in  2017.14 It  comprises  the  East\u2013West  (Purple  Line)  and  North\u2013\nSouth (Green Line) lines. Phase 2 will extend the Purple and Green lines and construct two new \ncorridors (Pink and Yellow lines) with a total length of 72.1 km. Phase 2 is being commissioned \nprogressively, beginning in 2020, and will become fully operational by 2024.15 Phases 2A and 2B \nare  new  phases  planned  as  another  two  new  corridors  (expressed  in  blue  and  light  blue \nrespectively in project map). Developing metro rail connectivity along the ORR and NH-44 toward \nKIA  will  significantly  improve  the  public  transport  situation  and  reduce  the  number  of  private \nvehicles on the road. \n \n10. \nSocial  inclusion  and  green  transport.  Congestion  increases  travel  time  and  costs, \nimposes  social  and  economic  costs  on  society,  and  impedes  economic  activity  and  growth. \nConstrained mobility has more adverse effects on socially vulnerable people, including the elderly, \nwomen, and differently abled persons. Newer metros in India have adopted  good practices for \ngender  equality  and  social  inclusion,  which  this  project  will  also  adopt  (para.  36).16 A  survey \nconducted by BMRCL in February 2020 found that 41.1% of Bengaluru Metro users are female, \nand that women consider metro rail safer than conventional public transport modes. Users also \nappreciate  the  affordability  of  metro  rail  since  about  56.6%  of  Bengaluru  Metro  users  have \nmonthly  incomes  of  less  than  \u20b950,000  (about  $660).  Meanwhile,  the  rapidly  rising  quantity  of \nvehicles  on  the  road  has  caused  the  air  quality  in  Bengaluru  to  deteriorate;  concentration  of \nparticulate  matter  10  (PM10)  exceeded  international  standard  in  2019. 17  Improved  public \ntransport,  especially  rail-based  mass  transit,  leads  to  fewer  private  vehicles  on  the  road  and \nimproves air quality and the environment in general. \n \n11.  Multidimensional approach to urban development and transport. Population growth \nin  Bengaluru  city  creates  challenges  related  to  urbanization,  especially  traffic  congestion, \ndecreased mobility, and poor quality of life. To become a livable and inclusive city that balances \neconomic  growth  with  environmental  and  social  equality  considerations,  Bengaluru  needs  to \n\n \n\n13 KIA is the third busiest airport in the country, with 33.3 million passengers in 2018\u20132019.  A second runway and \nterminal building are under construction to meet projected passenger volume of 55 million per annum by 2025. \n\n14 Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD) provided financial \nsupport for phase 1, together with domestic financial institutions. Bengaluru Metro is also known as Namma Metro \nor Bangalore Metro. \n\n15 AFD, European Investment Bank, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank provided financial support for phase 2, \n\ntogether with domestic financial institutions. \n\n16 ADB.

Details are in Environment Impact Assessment reports. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nadopt  a  multidimensional  approach  covering  urban  planning,  urban  development,  and  public \ntransport  development.  To  meet  the  development  objectives  of  the  city,  the  state  government \nplans  to  (i)  expand  and  improve  public  mass  transit  systems  for  the  city,  including  metro  rail, \nsuburban rail, and bus transport; and (ii) pursue TOD, an urban development model to realign \ngrowth and densities along sustainably developed mass transit corridors to create higher density, \ncompact,  mixed  use,  mixed  income,  safe,  and  resource  efficient  neighborhoods.  TOD  aims  to \nraise land values along these corridors, generating capital revenues for the state government to \nmeet  the  city\u2019s  long-term  investment  needs.  However,  implementing  the  approach  will  require \nstrengthening the capacity of relevant state agencies.18 \n \n12. \nGovernment  strategy.  Supporting  rail-based  mass  transit  is  in  line  with  the  National \nUrban Transport Policy 2006 of India, which promotes TOD and emphasizes nonmotorized and \npublic transport over private automobiles.19 TOD is promoted under the National Transit Oriented \nDevelopment Policy 2017. Rail-based mass transit will alleviate air pollution in the city, in line with \nIndia\u2019s  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  to  reducing  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions. 20 \nImproved public transport and TOD are also in line with the development plan of Bengaluru city \n(footnote  5).  The  Rights  of  Persons  with  Disabilities  Act  (2016)  of  India  promotes  mobility  of \nvulnerable people. At state level, the Directorate of Urban Land Transport, established in 2007, \noversees all urban land transport initiatives in Karnataka state including MMI. BMRCL issued the \ndraft Bengaluru Transit Oriented Development Policy in February 2019.21 The state government \nwill revise the city master plan to integrate TOD principles in urban development plans and state \nregulations. The state government is expected to approve the Comprehensive Mobility Plan for \nBengaluru by 2021 as a long-term plan of transport in the city emphasizing the needs of the metro. \nThe  project  remains  a  high  priority  for  the  government  because  public  expenditure  on \ninfrastructure can stimulate economic activity by creating jobs, thereby supporting the country\u2019s \nefforts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  strategic  context.  The  project  is  aligned  with  all  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy: (i) boosting economic competitiveness by expanding infrastructure networks \nand corridor development, (ii) providing inclusive access to these infrastructure networks, and (iii) \naddressing climate change.22 The project also meets the following operational priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities;  (ii)  accelerating \nprogress in gender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability; and (iv) making cities more livable.23 \n \n14. \nImplications of coronavirus disease on public transport. Because of the COVID-19 \npandemic,  public  transport  demand  plunged  globally,  with  people  shifting  to  private  transport. \nHowever, considering constrained road capacity and the need for environment-friendly transport \nin Bengaluru, public transport will continue to play a significant role in transport network and a \nlivable city beyond the short and medium term. Under the \u201cnew normal\u201d brought about by COVID-\n19, public transport will be governed by new rules related to social distancing, off-peak commuting, \n\n \n\n18 State line agencies concerned include BMRCL, the Directorate of Urban Land Transport, the Bengaluru Metropolitan \n\nTransport Corporation, and BDA. \n\n19 Government of India, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

Implementing these  rules  will  require  better \nMMI,  improved  operational  efficiency,  and  application  of  IT.  Transport-led  urban  development \nemphasizing TOD principles and MMI will alleviate pressure on urban transport and contribute to \nmore livable and walkable cities during the new normal and beyond. \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: urban mobility in Bengaluru improved.24 \n15. \nThe  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  efficiency,  safety,  and  gender  and  social \ninclusiveness of urban rail transport in Bengaluru increased.25  \n \n16. \nOutput 1: New metro lines completed. The project will finance the construction of new \nmetro line phases 2A and 2B with a total length of 56 km, and 30 stations, about 90% of which \ncomprises elevated structure, with the remaining 10% at ground level. The new metro lines will \nconnect to other metro lines, i.e., yellow, purple, and red lines at three junction stations and Indian \nrailways at one junction station, Phase 2B will also provide accessibility to public transport along \nthe  northern  development  axis  (para.  8)  along  NH-44  up  to  KIA.  Multimodal  facilities  to  be \ndeveloped at project metro stations include motorcycle pools, taxi stand, bus bays, and pedestrian \nwalkways and bridges, which will enable smooth intermodal connectivity and provide  improved \nlast-mile connectivity. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Urban  development  plans  and  implementation  frameworks  based  on \ntransit-oriented  development  principles  and  multimodal  integration  plan  developed  for \nBengaluru. The project will support the state government\u2019s plan to increase the city\u2019s economic \nproductivity  through  strategic  urban  renewal  and  densification,  and  devise  people-oriented, \nenvironment-friendly mobility solutions. Consultants hired under the attached technical assistance  \nwill deliver (i) a TOD vision plan for the metro corridors and TOD-based urban development plans \nfor six selected zones along the metro corridors; (ii) a TOD implementation framework; and (iii) \nan  MMI  plan  for  physical,  informational,  operational,  and  ticketing  aspects,  and  support  for \ninstitutionalization of this planning process. \n \n18. \nOutput 3: Capacity of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited and relevant state \nline  agencies improved in  transit-oriented  development  and  multimodal integration.  The \nconcepts of TOD and MMI are new and complex. This output, funded by the attached technical \nassistance, will strengthen the capacity of state line agencies concerned (footnote 18) to design \nand implement TOD and MMI plans. The output will support line agencies in preparing TOD and \nMMI manuals, standard operating procedures, and tool kits. It will also support the development \nof a communication strategy, including public consultations, to promote public awareness of TOD. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nThe project will include strong gender and social inclusion measures, as per best practices \nfollowing  previous  metro  projects.  The  project  includes  non  ADB-administered  parallel \ncofinancing  with  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  which  will  finance  rolling \nstock and signaling and telecommunication. A public\u2013private partnership module is in advanced \nstage of discussion with Bangalore International Airport Ltd. to construct and lease back the metro \nline  within  the  airport  boundary.  In  addition,  corporate  sponsorships  of  station  access  and  co-\nbranded stations have been finalized or under negotiations as part of public\u2013private partnership \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n24 Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Urban  Development.  2006.

Maintenance of system and rolling stock will be contracted \nout  mostly  with  the  same  suppliers  or  vendors  after  the  defect  liability  period  while  operation \nremains  under  BMRCL.  BMRCL  expressed  its  commitment  to  involve  private  parties  for \nmaintenance  of  assets.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  initiated  discussion  with \nBMRCL  to  build  up  their  capacity  to  explore  non-sovereign  borrowing  to  address  future \nrequirements.  The  project  will  showcase  the  multidimensional  approach  of  urban  and  public \ntransport  to  pursue  effective  urban  transformation  and  to  facilitate  replication  to  other  metro \nprojects elsewhere in India, other South Asian countries and regions. The project will demonstrate \neffective methodology and implementation arrangement with multiple agencies and stakeholders \nrelated  to  TOD  and  MMI.  ADB\u2019s  participation  contributed  to  initiating  the  partnership  between \nBengaluru  and  advanced  cities,  and  facilitated  knowledge  transfer  about  best  practices  of \ntransport-led urban development from the advanced cities to Bengaluru.26 \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe project is estimated to cost $1,055.8 million (Table 1). JICA will provide $318 million \nin parallel cofinancing for components of rolling stock and telecommunication and signaling, with \ncorresponding $471.2 million counterpart financing from the Government of India. These will be \nunder separate contracts and will not be administered by ADB. \n \n21. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM).27 The  loan  will  finance  civil  works  for  new  metro  lines. \nBMRCL will finance minor civil works, land acquisition costs, recurrent costs, and taxes and duties. \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \na  Includes taxes and duties of $76.5 million.

The climate change assessment revealed \nmedium  overall  risk  for  the  project.  Bengaluru  is  projected  to  experience  increased  average \ntemperature and occurrence of extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves, extreme rainfall events \nleading to floods). The project includes modern design and technology such as the use of head-\nhardened,  heat-treated,  and  continuous  welded  rail  to  withstand  extreme  temperatures.  To \nminimize flooding and facilitate recharging of groundwater, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits \nwill be installed at stations and viaducts. In addition, waterproofing of tunnel walls and parapet \nwalls at ramp sections will be carried out at the Yelahanka cut-and-cover section under line 2B. \nThese  measures  to  prevent  flooding  are  estimated  to  cost  about  $1.47 million,  including \nincremental costs. The project is considered a positive climate mitigation project as it will result in \na modal shift from road to rail, which is a cleaner mode of transport. Hence, the entire $500 million \nof ADB financing is considered climate change mitigation and adaptation costs.29 \n \nE. \n \nThe Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA) acting through BMRCL will be the \n25. \nexecuting  agency  for  the  project.  BMRCL  has  established  a  project  implementation  unit  in \nBengaluru,  led  by  a  project  director.  A  general  consultant  will  be  engaged  by  BMRCL  using \ncounterpart  funds  to  support  the  executing  agency.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 27). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nDecember 2020\u2013December 2026 \n31 December 2026 \n30 June 2027 \n\nMinistry of Housing and Urban Affairs, acting through BMRCL \nProject implementation unit in BMRCL \nBengaluru, 113 staff  \nOpen competitive bidding \n(internationally advertised) \nBMRCL will use advance contracting and retroactive financing for \ncivil works for the project.

Readiness is high as \nthe complete scope of the project was appraised by ADB. Environmental and social due diligence \nhas  been  completed  for  the  entire  metro  corridor.  The  detailed  designs  are  ready,  based  on \nengineering survey results. Land acquisition and resettlement have progressed. The COVID-19 \npandemic  has  not  affected  the  project  implementation  arrangements  or  cost  estimate.  The \nimplementation period of 6 years is adequate to complete the project without delays. Based on \ngovernment orders, guidelines and standard operating procedures have been developed and are \nbeing strictly implemented for resumption of construction works on phase 2 of the metro. Under \nthe project, construction works will include measures such as social distancing at site, sanitation \nand  disinfection  requirements,  temperature  checks,  and  mandatory  insurance  requirements \ncovering  COVID-19.  Operation  of  the  Bengaluru  Metro  resumed  on  7  September  2020  with \nstandard operating procedures under the government\u2019s guideline, introducing social distancing, \nsanitization, and other safety measures for passengers and workers. \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nThe attached transaction TA, Support for Integrated and Sustainable Urban Development \n27. \nalong  Mass  Rapid  Transit  Corridors  in  Bengaluru  City,  will  assist  the  state  government  in \nstructuring  mobility  solutions  and  developing  a  new  model  for  sustainable  redevelopment  and \ngrowth for Bengaluru city, taking advantage of the proposed mass rapid transit system expansion \nplan.  The  TA  will  support  the  state  government  to  prepare  urban  development  plans  and \nimplementation frameworks based on TOD principles to facilitate urban rejuvenation in Bengaluru \nby  realigning  growth  and  densities  along  the  new  mass  transit  corridors  (para.  11).  This  new \nplanning approach will reduce Bengaluru\u2019s carbon footprint while enhancing land values along \nthe  corridor  to  generate  capital  revenues  to  meet  the  city\u2019s  long-term  investment  needs.  To \nprovide efficient, accessible, convenient, and safe mobility options for all commuters, the  state \ngovernment  will  use  the  TA  support  to  plan  enabling  infrastructure  and  to  create  institutional \nprovisions for seamless integration of different modes of public transport. The TA will strengthen \ninstitutional  structures  and  build  the  capacities  of  BMRCL,  the  Directorate  of  Urban  Land \nTransport, and the state government to plan and implement TOD and MMI. The TA will also help \nthe state government incorporate lessons from similar brownfield TOD developments and MMI \ninitiatives in the region, and identify measures, including broad-based participatory approaches, \nto ensure stakeholder and market buy-in and enable urban transformation at the required scale \nfor the benefit of all segments of society. \n \n28. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $2,200,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others), and will be implemented over \n24 months. The state government, acting through BMRCL, is the executing agency of the TA.30 \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and other in-\nkind contributions. \n\n30 The implementation arrangements are in Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \nAn external engineering consultant firm funded by BMRCL prepared the detailed design \nof  the  civil  works.  The  technical  viability  is  sound,  with  the  use  of  well-proven  technology  and \nstandards. About 90% of the project alignment comprises elevated structures on road medians \nor alongside roads, while the remaining alignment is at ground level. Station locations and layout \nwere prepared to secure connectivity with other lines of the metro, and other transport modes. \nThe impact of climate change was considered and is reflected in the design of the infrastructure. \nMMI at major junction stations will be further elaborated under the attached TA. The application \nof similar standards and specifications for rolling stock, telecommunications, signaling, and other \nequipment,  as  in  previous  phases  of  the  metro,  will  minimize  the  operational  and  engineering \nrisks. The project will also introduce new technology such as nationwide integrated fare cards, \nwhich will replace the stand-alone card system in place. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic  assessment.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \n30. \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  and  compared  the  project  costs  and  benefits  in  the  \u201cwith-\nproject\u201d and \u201cwithout-project\u201d cases, using a 9% discount rate and economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) and net present value as decision criteria. The project will transform Bengaluru into a more \nlivable, inclusive, and green city. Its benefits were measured in terms of vehicle operating cost \nand travel time savings for both public transport users and road users, reduced road accidents, \nimproved metro passenger safety, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. The \nEIRR of the project is estimated to be 13.4%, with a net present value of $798.6 million, although \nit is based on a demand forecast prepared before the COVID-19 pandemic. A sensitivity analysis \nindicated that the EIRR remained above 9% under all scenarios, demonstrating that the project \nwould remain economically viable given adverse changes in costs and benefits. As found in the \nsurvey  (para.  10),  public  transport  users  expect  the  project  metro  to  remain  affordable,  safe, \nsocially inclusive, and gender-equal.31 \n \n31. \nFinancial  assessment.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines.32 It  assessed  the  incremental  costs  and  earnings  that  would \naccrue to the BMRCL as a result of the project, and calculated the financial internal rate of return. \nThe project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital was estimated to be 2.63%. For the purposes of \nfinancial sustainability, capital costs, irrespective of the financier, include the cost of rolling stock; \ncivil works and its associated facilities, including stations; and a maintenance depot. Operations \nand  maintenance  costs  include  all  staff  costs,  unit  maintenance  costs,  and  energy  costs.  The \nevaluation conservatively assumes that the traffic level in the first 2 years of operations will remain \nlow and ramp up to the forecast estimates  by the third year after commencement. The project \nrevenues include farebox revenues from ticket sales, non-farebox revenues from advertisements, \nand rentals at metro stations as non-farebox revenue. A conservative approach to determine the \nnon-farebox revenue, at 10% of the farebox revenue, has been adopted. All financial projections \nare assessed in 2020 prices, in real terms. The estimated financial internal rate of return of the \nnet cash flows for the project is 1.92% in real terms, which is below the weighted average cost of \n\n31 Financial Analysis; and Economic Analysis (both accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 ADB. 2019.

BMRCL will \nrequire a sponsor to provide support for its debt service obligations to the extent of \u20b94,803 million \nin 6 years out of 25 years of the projection period (footnote 33). The project\u2019s lending decision is \nbased on economic viability rather than financial viability. \n \nC. \n \n32. \nBMRCL,  as  a  special  purpose  vehicle  set  up  jointly  by  the  government  and  the  state \ngovernment,  will  own,  operate,  and  maintain  the  new  metro  lines.  BMRCL  is  dependent  on \ngovernment and state government funding for capital expenditures. Any sovereign borrowing is \nthrough  the  government,  while  non-sovereign  borrowing  is  limited  and/or  backstopped  by  the \nstate government. There is an institutional mechanism to ensure the financial sustainability of the \nmetro whereby any future operational loss will be backstopped by the state government, similar \nto previous phases of the metro.35 Since becoming fully operational from phase 1 in 2017, the \nmetro  has  been  recognized  as  a  safe,  fast,  reliable,  and  environment-friendly  form  of  public \ntransport in the city. As of FY2019, the metro was able to meet its operational costs (excluding \ndepreciation and finance costs) from its operating revenue, with the state government reimbursing \ncash losses (mainly due to finance costs). With ridership projected to keep increasing after phases \n2, 2A, and 2B are operational, the metro is expected to play a more significant role in the entire \ntransport  network  to  meet  travel  demand.  Also,  the  project\u2019s  TOD  approach,  which  will  be \nimplemented by a multiagency forum established under the attached TA, will remain mainstream \nin urban development in the medium and long term. Aside from guaranteeing reimbursement of \ncash losses to BMRCL, the state government will collect incremental revenues through land value \ncapturing along TOD which will be credited for the benefit of urban transport projects, including \nthe metro, in the state. Credit rating agencies have given BMRCL an AA stable credit rating for \nits 10-year secured, nonconvertible, privately placed debentures Namma Metro Bonds Series 1.36  \n \nD. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted \n33. \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.37 BMRCL\u2019s  relative  strengths  in  financial  management  include  (i) \ngovernance  by  a  robust  national  legislative  framework;  (ii)  an  annual  external  audit  by  the \ncomptroller and auditor general of India and by an independent firm of chartered accountants with \nunqualified audit opinions on financial statements and internal control over financial reporting; (iii) \nnomination  or  appointment  of  board  members  and  senior  management  directly  by  central  and \nstate  governments;  (iv)  organization-wide  use  of  a  centralized  enterprise  resources  planning \nsoftware;  and  (v)  extensive  experience  with  the  disbursement  and  procurement  procedures  of \ninternational  development  agencies  through  the  construction  of  previous  phases  of  the  metro. \nThe  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  was  assessed  as  moderate.  The  primary \nrisk factors include (i) vacancies at key accounting positions (recruitment already in process); (ii) \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n33 Details are in Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Defined as operational revenue (farebox and non-farebox) less operational expenses (staff, power, and maintenance \n\nexpenses). Interest expense (finance cost) is not part of operational expenses. \n\n35 Memo  of  Understandings  will  be  signed  before  loan  signing  of  the  project  among  MOHUA,  the  government  of \n\nKarnataka, and BMRCL. \n\n36 BMRCL issued 10-year secured, nonconvertible privately placed debentures Namma Metro Bonds Series 1 in 2014. \nCredit rating agencies India Ratings & Research Private Limited and Brickwork Ratings rate these debt instruments \nAA stable. \n\n37 ADB. 2019.

BMRCL  has  agreed  to  implement  a  comprehensive \nfinancial management action plan to address the identified risks. Key mitigation measures agreed \nwith  BMRCL  include  (i)  hiring  key  accounting  staff,  (ii)  updating  the  accounting  manual,  (iii) \ndeveloping a comprehensive chart of accounts, and (iv) fully automating processes in all areas in \nthe enterprise resource planning along with integration of existing software modules. At the project \nlevel, BMRCL has agreed to assign a dedicated team of accounting staff, headed by a general \nmanager, to assume financial management of the project. \n \n34. \nProcurement  and  value-for-money.  The  project  procurement  risk  assessment  shows \nlow  to  medium  risk  after  mitigation  measures  are  implemented.  BMRCL  follows  domestic \nprocurement regulations, which are consistent with the core principles of the ADB Procurement \nPolicy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  BMRCL  has  experience  with  procurement  on \nprojects funded by bilateral agencies and multilateral development banks to construct previous \nphases  of  the  metro.  Procurement  will  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). An ADB project team will \nclosely  monitor  procurement  to  ensure  timely  completion  of  procurement  activity.  All  works \npackages will be subject to prior review procedures to avoid any risks of noncompliance in the \nprocurement  process.  Optimizing  value-for-money  was  sought  through  strategic  procurement \nplanning  and  risk-managed  approaches  such  as  (i)  open  competitive  bidding  with  multiple-\ncontracts  bidding, (ii)  attractive  contract  sizes  for  international  bidders, (iii)  higher-performance \nsecurities to avoid abnormally low bids, (iv) framework for prompt interim progress payments to \ncontractors, (v) additional advance payments for smooth cash flow, and (vi) incentive clauses for \nearly  completion.  There  are  strict  prohibitions  on  fraud  and  corruption  through  the  Fraud \nPrevention  Policy  and  Whistleblower  Policy  in  the  legal  framework  of  BMRCL.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and  BMRCL.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nE. \n \nPoverty. Based on 2012 estimates, the poverty incidence38 in the state of Karnataka is \n35. \npegged at 21% on average (rural 25%, urban 15%). About 20% of the city\u2019s population is believed \nto be living in slums where poverty is prevalent. The project will improve the interconnectivity and \nincrease  the  reach  of  the  metro  rail  network,  while  supporting  the  economic  development  of \nBengaluru city and Karnataka state. At a broader level, economic activity and competitiveness \nwill increase, while at the local level, access to urban public and social services such as schools, \nhealth facilities, and workplaces will improve. The population, especially the poor and vulnerable, \nwill  benefit  from  the  improved  urban  transport  and  improved  access  to  economic  and  social \nopportunities and amenities. \n \nGender  equality  and  social  inclusion.

BMRCL conducted extensive public consultations and stakeholder engagement \nactivities in preparing a gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan.39 Building upon \nthe  existing  gender  and  development  initiatives  of  BMRCL,  the  GESI  action  plan  integrates \nadditional  GESI  activities  into  the  project  design,  including  (i)  ensuring  that  Bengaluru  Metro \nphases 2A and 2B follow international standards and address gender-specific safety and public \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n38 Percentage of population below poverty line. \n39 Gender Equity and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nhealth  concerns,  with  a  focus  on  the  needs  of  elderly,  women,  children,  differently  abled,  and \ntrans-person  (EWCDT)  user  groups;  (ii)  ensuring  that  TOD  and  MMI  urban  development \nstrategies  incorporate  GESI  measures;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  BMRCL  and \nrelevant state line agencies to be gender-sensitive and socially inclusive. The project GESI action \nplan  has  benefitted from  multiple  focus  group  discussions  with transgender  persons,  women\u2019s \ngroups, and students from different learning institutions in Bengaluru. In addition, a GESI \u201cwalk\u201d \nin an existing metro station was organized with trans women, persons with visual and mobility \nimpairments, and women\u2019s groups. The walk was an opportunity to allow these user groups to \noffer feedback on issues such as access, movement within the station, and the experience of the \ntrain commute. \n \n37. \nPublic health and safety. Under the project, metro facilities will be used as platforms for \neducating the public on public health and safety; prevention of communicable diseases, including \nCOVID-19  and  any  other  pandemic  prevention;  and  the  zero-tolerance  approach  to  sexual \nharassment. Messages will be transmitted via an integrated EWCDT-friendly signage system and \nmultimedia materials in all coaches and stations. \n \nF. \n \n38. \ncategories are as follows.40 \n \n39. \nEnvironment  (category A).  The  project  will  entail  new  construction  of mostly  elevated \nstructures and viaducts with very short at-grade segments, mostly along the centerlines of existing \nhighways. Phase 2A passes through more developed parts of the city, but proposed designs for \nthis line have adopted a site-specific design approach that will greatly reduce environmental and \nsocial impacts. The immediate corridor is mostly lined with commercial establishments, with some \nportions  of  phase  2B  passing  through  open  government  lands  and  large  residential  areas \noccupying  several  segments  of  the  300-meter  assessment  corridor  for  both  lines.  Stations  of \nphase 2B mostly fall within open grounds. Phase 2A passes through more developed parts of the \ncity  but  proposed  designs  for  this  line  have  adopted  a  site-specific  design  approach  that  will \ngreatly reduce environmental and social impacts. \n \n40. \nSeveral  sensitive  receptors  are  along  the  alignment  such  as  hospitals,  religious \nestablishments,  and  schools; these  will  require  particular  attention.  Because  of  the  large-scale \nand  elevated  nature  of  most  of  the  construction  works,  most  anticipated  risks  are  related  to \ncommunity  and  occupational  health  and  safety,  especially  along  congested  segments  of  the \nalignment with high pedestrian traffic. The risk of COVID-19 spread is a particular concern, both \nduring construction and operation. Other construction-related issues are noise and vibration, dust, \nwater  pollution,  and  large  volumes  of  excavated  waste,  but  these  will  be  mostly  limited  to  the \nconstruction phase. However, long-term noise and vibration impacts as well as alteration of the \nskyline and cityscape were also identified during due diligence. \n \n41. \nimpact \nassessments  and  contract  package-specific  environmental  management  plans  (EMP),  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, which were disclosed on the ADB website \non 15 June 2020. The EMPs, which include measures for communicable disease prevention with \nparticular  attention  to  COVID-19  and  the  safety,  health,  and  environment  guidelines  for  metro \nprojects in India, were included in the bidding documents. COVID-19 provisions may be revised \n\nthe  detailed  project  report,  BMRCL  prepared  environmental \n\nBased  on \n\n40 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n \n\n \n\n\faccording to national guidelines and international best practices as the situation evolves. Through \nits social and environment unit, BMRCL will ensure that all environmental safeguard requirements \nunder the project will be implemented as required in these documents. Consultations with affected \ncommunities and key stakeholders were held during project design preparation to gather inputs \nfor the EMPs. Regular consultation meetings will be held between the project management and \nthe  community.  In  addition,  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established  and  will  be \nmade available online. An external monitor will be engaged to conduct independent monitoring of \nEMP compliance. Semiannual environment monitoring reports will be prepared and disclosed in \nthe ADB website throughout construction and during the first 2 years of operation. 41 \n \n42. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). Land acquisition and resettlement for lines 2A \nand 2B will affect private assets\u2014mainly land and structures that are being acquired under the \nproject. Line 2A will entail impacts on 111 households comprising 46 titled owners and 65 tenants. \nTotal land acquisition for the project section of Line 2A will be 48,215.5 square meters (m2), of \nwhich  26,379.3  m2  is  private  land  and  the  remainder  is  government  land.  Line  2B  will  entail \nimpacts on 380 households comprising 187 titled owners, 189 tenants, and 4 non-title holders. \nTotal land acquisition for the project section of Line 2B will be 319,244.5 m2, of which 101,217.38 \nm2 is private land and the remainder is government land. Total affected households for the two \nlines  are  491,  covering  an  estimated  816  affected  persons.  Land  acquisition  commenced  in \nSeptember 2018 and should be completed by the end of 2020. BMRCL prepared resettlement \nplans, including due diligence for land that had already been acquired. The resettlement plans \noutline entitlements consistent with national and ADB safeguard requirements, summarize public \nconsultations  and  information  disclosure,  describe  the  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and \nstipulate institutional arrangements to ensure that the plans are implemented accordingly.  Due \ndiligence on land already acquired indicate consistency with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements, particularly the replacement cost principle. BMRCL is found to have the capacity \nand the commitment to ensure that land acquisition and resettlement are carried out adequately \nand in accordance with national and ADB requirements. BMRCL will engage an external monitor \nto validate the implementation of resettlement plans. \n \n43. \ndefined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nG. \n \n44. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.42 \n \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C).
