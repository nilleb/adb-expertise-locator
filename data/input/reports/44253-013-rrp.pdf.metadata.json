In close alignment with the government\u2019s reforms, the program assists efforts \ntoward improved efficiency of public expenditure, enhanced accountability of local  government \nadministration, and the creation of a fiscal framework conducive to job creation.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nEfficient  service  delivery  for  inclusive  growth.  The  Philippine  Development  Plan, \n3. \n2011\u20132016 identifies specific challenges for local government units (LGUs) in the achievement \nof  its  main  goals:  promoting  inclusive  growth  and  generating  employment, \nimproving \ngovernance  and  human  development  standards,  and  achieving  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \nsustainability.3  Reducing  local  disparities  in  access  to  services  is  critical  to  achieving  the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of inclusive growth and poverty reduction. The poverty incidence was 27.9% \nin  2012  (a  decrease  from  28.6%  in  2009),  which  is  above  the  prevailing  rates  in  neighboring \ncountries  in  Southeast  Asia.4  Although  recent  high  economic  growth  (6.8%  in  2012)  is \nencouraging,  earlier  growth  spurts  in  the  Philippines  have  not  been  effective  in  reducing \npoverty.  Geographically,  the  poor  remain concentrated  in the southern  Philippines  and in rural \nareas. The poverty incidence in the Visayas and Mindanao regions is double that in Luzon, and \ntwo-thirds  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas.  Provincial  poverty  disparities  are  even  larger,  with \nseveral provinces in Eastern Visayas and Mindanao reporting rates of over 40%, while poverty \nincidence in several southern Luzon provinces remains below 10%. Similar disparities are found \nin terms of access to services. The average infant mortality rates in 2008 in the Eastern Visayas \n(45 deaths per 1,000 births) and Cagayan Valley (38 per 1,000) were more than 50% above the \nnational  average.  In  2009,  six  regions  of  the  country  reported  that  less  than  80%  of  their \npopulation had access to electricity, compared to almost 99% in the national capital region; and \nless  than  70%  of  the  population  of  Central  Visayas  and  Zamboanga  had  access  to  potable \nwater in 2009, compared to some 97% in Central Luzon. \n \n4.  \nInadequate  and inequitable distribution  of financial resources. Flaws in the design \nof the revenue base of LGUs are partly responsible for the geographical disparities observed in \naccess  to  services.  Following  the  first  drive  of  decentralization  after  the  approval  of  the  Local \nGovernment  Code  1991  (LGC),  subnational  government  expenditures  have  remained  stable. \nBetween  2001  and  2011,  subnational  expenditure  (including  provinces,  cities,  municipalities, \nand barangays) stayed at about 4% of gross domestic product, and represented some 17% of \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian Development Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance for  Local  Government    \n     Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program (TA 8390). \n3   Government  of  the  Philippines,  National  Economic  Development  Authority.  2011.  Philippine  Development  Plan \n\n4   Report  from  the  National  Statistical  Coordination  Board.  2012.  (http://www.nscb.gov.ph/pressreleases/2013/PR- \n\n2011\u20132016. Manila. \n\n201304-NS1-04_poverty.asp)  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ntotal public expenditure in 2011 (25% if debt amortization is excluded). The composition of LGU \nexpenditures  shows  a  worrisome  declining  trend  in  terms  of  the  allocations  made  to  health, \neducation,  and  other  basic  services  between  2001  and  2011.  Against  this  background,  LGUs \ncollected an average of 24% of their operating income from their own revenue sources between \n2008 and 2011 (the remaining income derived from transfers and revenue sharing). The share \nof local tax and non-tax as a proportion of LGU revenues is stagnating because of outdated and \nunproductive tax and non-tax instruments, as well as limited tax efforts from local governments. \nAs  expected,  large  differences  exist  in  revenue  collection  capacity,  with  the  top  province \ncollecting more than four times the national average from its own revenue sources in 2011.  \n \n5.  \nIncomplete system of transfers to local government units. The increasingly complex \ndistribution of service delivery responsibilities across levels of government in the Philippines has \nnot been matched by a system of transfers that assists the equitable and efficient distribution of \nfinancial  resources. The  internal revenue  allotment  (IRA)  has  limited fiscal  equalization  power, \nresulting  in  very  significant  disparities  in  LGU  expenditures  per  capita.  The  implementation  of \nperformance-based  transfers  that  encourages  LGU  governance  and  efficiency  upgrades  has \nlagged behind, and the coordination between central and local authorities in service delivery is \ncompromised by the absence of a system of conditional grants.  \n \n6. \nOutdated regulatory framework. There is widespread agreement among stakeholders \nthat  the  LGC  has  structural  deficiencies  that  need  to  be  addressed through  a government-led \nreview.5  The  deficiencies  include  lack  of  clarity  in  functional  assignments,  limited  and \nunproductive sources of local revenues, and inadequate and inequitable transfer mechanisms. \nIn addition, the LGC requires a review of the criteria defined for jurisdictional formation, and the \nsimplification of procedures for LGUs to access commercial sources of credit.   \n \n7.  \nImproved transparency of the local government units through efficient local public \nfinancial  management  systems. Recent reforms to local public financial management (PFM) \nsystems have increased the predictability of revenues to LGUs, established the foundations of \nfinancial  management  information  systems,  and  improved  the  capacity  of  LGUs\u2019  financial \nmanagement  personnel.  The  latter  efforts  need  to  be  continued,  however,  and  undertaken \nwithin  the  framework  of  a  medium-term  plan  for  local  PFM  reforms  that  consolidates  and \nharmonizes  current  initiatives.  Policy  priorities  include  the  improvement  of  local  revenue \nforecasting  systems  and  LGU  credit  worthiness  assessments.  In  addition,  there  is  a  need  to \nclarify  the  legal  status  of  local  economic  enterprises  (to  prevent  these  enterprises  from \njeopardizing  the  fiscal  stability  of  LGUs  due  to  unclear  accounting  practices)  and  of  LGU \nalliances (currently formed by non-legally binding agreements that limit long-term cooperation in \nservice delivery). \n \n8.  \nStrengthening accountability of the local government units to their constituencies. \nThe  implementation  of  participatory  planning,  budgeting,  and monitoring systems that  improve \nthe accountability of the national government and LGUs to their citizens is still ongoing. These \nsystems  will  allow  improvements  to  allocative  efficiency  in  public  expenditure  by  aligning \nnational and local development priorities for service delivery. A number of parallel local planning \nprocesses need to be harmonized around the comprehensive development plan system to allow \nfor  more  efficient  links  between  planning  and  budgeting.  Additional  efforts  are  required  in  the \ndevelopment  of  LGU  performance  measurement  systems.  The  foundations  of  a  local \ngovernment  performance  measurement  system  (LGPMS)  are  in  place,  but  significant  work  is \n\n \n\n                                                \n5  The  code  instructs  regular  reviews  every  5  years,  but  none  has  taken  place  since  its  enactment.  The \nrecommendation for the review of the LGC  was included in the statement of the recent Philippines Development \nForum 2013. \n\n\frequired to expand and increase the  system\u2019s analytical capacity and its integration with other \nlocal government performance tools. Because these systems are normally based on LGUs\u2019 self-\nreported information, instruments that directly channel local constituents\u2019 views and preferences \non service delivery are also required to enhance the efficiency of local budget formulation. \n \n9.  \nSustaining and expanding local government reforms. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  supported  government  efforts  in  local  government  finance  reforms  in  the  Philippines \nthrough  the  Local  Government  Finance  and  Budget  Reform  (LGFBR)  Program,  consisting  of \ntwo policy-based loans and several technical assistance (TA) projects.6 LGFBR support focused \non  strengthening  national  and  local  PFM  systems,  improving  the  efficiency  of  budgeting \nprocesses,  assisting  access  to  credit  by  LGUs,  and  laying  the  basis  of  LGU  performance \nmonitoring  systems.  The  completeness,  timeliness,  and  transparency  of  the  release  of  LGU \nshares  in national government revenues  was improved,  and  LGU revenues  increased  by 30% \n(mostly  from  transfers)  between  2007  and  2009.  Regulations  were  passed  providing  for  the \nautomatic  appropriation of  the  IRA from  2007  and  for  the timely  estimation  and certification of \nthe IRA shares. Under the LGFBR, support was provided for the development, computerization, \nand  implementation  of  the  electronic  statement  of  receipts  and  expenditures  (ESRE),  the \nfinancial reporting system for LGUs. These efforts are being sustained in the proposed program. \nThe  LGFBR  supported  the  development  of  the  government\u2019s  performance-based  grant  policy, \nwhich has materialized upon the establishment of performance-based grants. Also, the LGFBR \nsupported  the  development  of  the  LGPMS,  while  the  proposed  program  will  assist  the  further \ndevelopment of accountability mechanisms for LGUs.     \n \n10.  \nLessons  learned.  The  experience  gained  from  the  LGFBR  and  subsequent  country \nanalytic work on critical development constraints, decentralization, and local governance in the \nPhilippines  has  generated  a  number  of  important  lessons.  First,  the  implementation  of  the \nLGFBR  program  underlined  the  need to sustain  a  long-term  commitment  to  reforms,  ensuring \nfuture initiatives are demand-driven. Second, the importance of local government reforms in the \nachievement of high, inclusive, and sustainable growth needs to be made more explicit. Thus, \nthe  program  will  support  high  and  sustainable  growth  through  several  channels,  including  \n(i)  improved  service  delivery  by  LGUs,  (ii)  the  rationalization  of  local  revenue  frameworks  to \nassist  local  business  development,  and (iii)  strengthened PFM  systems.  Third,  earlier  work  on \ndecentralization has shown that the reform program needs to be anchored in a rich institutional \nframework.  The  first  government-led  review  of  the  LGC  since  1991  will  be  articulated  through \nrobust consultative mechanisms that will include all stakeholders. Lastly, during program design, \nADB drew upon its experiences from supporting decentralization in other countries in the region. \nAs  a  result,  attention  has  been  focused  on  supporting  capacity  development,  strengthening \naccountability mechanisms, and encouraging LGUs\u2019 tax effort for enhanced fiscal autonomy and \nlower transfer dependence.7 \n \n11.   Programmatic  approach  and  innovative  features.  The  comprehensive  nature  of  the \nreforms  needed  requires  a  lending  modality  that  offers  a  flexible  and  long-term  framework  for \nADB  support.  The  programmatic  approach  is  favored  based  on  past  experiences  supporting \nsimilar  reforms  in  the  region.  The  Philippines  displays  an  adequate  institutional  setting  for \nintergovernmental  relations  and  a  rich\u2014although  inconsistent\u2014policy  framework,  making \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2007.

The program adopts, in comparison with \nthe  LGFBR,  a more  ambitious  approach to  local  government reforms,  including  (i)  a review  of \nthe  regulatory  framework  for  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations;  and  (ii)  an  emphasis  on \ndemand-side  aspects  of  local  governance  and  performance-based  monitoring  approaches, \nwhile fostering incremental progress made through earlier PFM reform initiatives.  \n \n12.  \nThe  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132016  identifies  supporting  local  government \nfinance and fiscal decentralization reforms as priority.8 The program has been designed by the \nGovernment of the Philippines, ADB, and the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). It is \ninformed  by  the  sectoral  assessments  produced  jointly  by  ADB  and  AFD  by  the  lessons  from \nthe  implementation  of  TA  projects,9  and  by  the  dialogue  sustained  with  national  government \ninstitutions,  local  government representatives,  private  sector  organizations,  academe,  and civil \nsociety.  The  processing  team  is  coordinating  the  program  design  with  the  European \nCommission\u2019s LGU public financial management reform program and the Decentralization and \nLocal Government (DIALOG) Trust Fund. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe impact will be improved delivery of services by LGUs. The outcome will be efficient \nand  transparent  local  governments  with  an  adequate  and  equitable  fiscal  framework.  The \nGovernment has completed all of the 35 reform actions (7 policy triggers and 28 milestones) for \nsubprogram 1. \n \nC. \n \nThe  program  includes  two  subprograms  structured  around  four  policy  outputs:  \n14.  \n(i)  creating  a conducive fiscal framework for  inclusive  growth; (ii)  developing  an  adequate and \nequitable  resource  framework  for  fiscal  sustainability;  (iii)  strengthening  public  financial \nmanagement to assist efficient LGU service delivery; and (iv) fostering good local governance, \ntransparency, and accountability. \n \n15. \n Conducive  fiscal  framework  for  inclusive  growth. The government is reviewing the \noutdated  regulatory  framework  for  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations.  For  the  first  time  since  it \nwas  approved,  the  LGC  will  undergo  a  government-led  substantive  review  led  by  the \nDepartment  of  the  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG).  The  review  is  articulated  under  the \nCoordinating  Committee  on  Decentralization  (CCD).10  The  scope  of  the  review  includes  LGU \nexpenditure and revenue assignments, and fiscal transfers; and it will be supported by an ADB \nTA.11  For  subprogram  2,  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  LGC  will  be  submitted  through  the \nCabinet  Cluster  on  Good  Governance  and  Anti-corruption  to  the  Oversight  Committee  on \nDevolution  (OCD)  and  to  the  Legislative-  Executive  Development  Advisory  Council.  The  OCD \nincludes  representation  from  national  agencies,  the  leagues  of  local  governments,  12  and  the \nlegislature (House of Representatives and Senate). \n                                                \n8   ADB.  2011.

Manila.  \n\n12 Established under the LGC, the leagues are associations of LGUs that are formed to defend their interests. There \n\nis a league for each level of local government (provincial, cities, municipalities, and barangays).  \n\n\fAdequate and equitable resource framework for fiscal sustainability. As part of the  \n16. \ngovernment\u2019s drive toward good governance and fiscal sustainability, the DILG has developed \nperformance-based  financing  mechanisms  for  LGUs,  incentivizing  efficient  and  transparent \nfinancial  management  under  subprogram  1.  The  Performance  Challenge  Fund  (PCF), \nestablished  in  2010,  is  a  performance-based  transfer  that  requires,  as  an  eligibility  condition, \nthat LGUs be awarded the Seal of Good Housekeeping.13 For the seal to be awarded, LGUs are \nrequired  to  obtain  a  no  adverse  or  disclaimer  opinion  from  the  Commission  on  Audit  and  to \ncomply  with  the  Full  Disclosure  Policy.  In  2013,  the  PCF  already  budgeted  over  P1  billion  for \ncapital  development  projects  at  the  local  level,  for  which  LGUs must  provide  cofinancing.  The \nDILG approved, in addition, new guidelines for the appropriation and utilization of the 20% of the \nIRA that is devoted to capital investment projects.  \n \nThe  Department  of  Finance  (DOF)  has  improved  the  revenue  collection  capacity  of \n17. \nLGUs. A new computer module including a tax payer database and a system for the estimation \nof  the  business  tax  has  been  developed.  The  system  assists  accurate  estimates  of  local \ngovernment  revenues.  The  DOF  has  developed  uniform  valuation  standards  of  real  estate  for \nthe  local  assessors\u2019  manual,  and  requested  all  assessors  to  be  licensed  as  a  condition  for \nappointment.  In  addition,  the  flow  of  information  between  the  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  and \nthe LGUs for tax collection purposes has been improved, and the DILG has produced guidelines \nfor the preparation of local revenue codes and local incentives codes with the aim of improving \nconsistency  between  them.  The  lack  of  consistency  in  local  regulations  has  been  highlighted \nregularly by the private sector as one of the major constraints to investment at the local level.  \n  \n18. \nSubstantive  improvements  to  financial  information  systems  have  been  achieved, \nallowing  for  enhanced  access  to  credit  by  LGUs.  The  DOF  has  developed  a  creditworthiness \nsystem that assists evaluations of prospective LGU borrowers by creditors. This represents an \nimportant step toward the improved transparency of LGUs. In addition, the DOF has developed \nan  LGU  debt  certification  system  that  facilitates  the  issuance  of  certificates  on  maximum \nborrowing and debt service capacities.  \n \n19.  \nFor  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  continue  to  improve  the  quality  of  local \nexpenditure  with  the  implementation  of  a  monitoring  system  for  the  LGU  capital  investment \nprojects and through the full development of the Seal of Good Governance for LGUs (including \nthe  seals of  competitiveness,  disaster  preparedness,  and  environment). The  DOF  will  improve \nthe  collection  performance  of  the  real  property  tax  by  assisting  the  updating  of  the  revised \nLGU\u2019s schedules of market values. These schedules define the base of the property tax and in \nmany  cases  have  not  been  updated  for  years.  The  government  will  explore  options  for \nexpanding LGUs\u2019 revenue assignments, including green taxes,14 and will work toward ensuring \nthe timely and equitable release of mining revenue shares to LGUs. Efforts will continue toward \nthe rationalization of  national fiscal  incentives  to investment,  with  a view  toward  ensuring  their \npositive impact on local economic development and fiscal revenues. Finally, the government will \ncomplete  the  roll  out  of  the  new  modules  on  credit  worthiness  and  debt  certification  to  DOF \nregional offices and will work toward establishing a single agency LGU loan monitoring system. \n \n\n                                                \n13  The  Seal  of  Good  Housekeeping  for  LGUs  aims  to  recognize  LGUs  with  good  performance  in  internal   \nhousekeeping  focusing  in  four  areas:  (i)  good  planning;  (ii)  sound  fiscal  management;  (iii)  transparency  and \naccountability; and (iv) valuing of performance information. The Seal of Good Housekeeping is a component of the \nsystem of Seal of Good Governance. \n\n14 Green taxes (also called \"environmental taxes\" or \"pollution taxes\") are excise taxes on environmental pollutants or \non  goods  whose  use  produces  such  pollutants  (http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/key-elements/ \nenvironment/what-is.cfm).  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fStrengthened  public  financial  management  for  efficient  service  delivery  of  local \n20. \ngovernment  units.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government\u2014in  coordination  with  all  relevant \nagencies\u2014is  developing  the  strategic  planning framework for  local  PFM  reforms. In particular, \nthe Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has initiated the drafting of the medium-term \nLGU public financial management road map, which is expected to be completed early in 2014 \nand will contain the policy actions incorporated in subprogram 2.  \n \n21. \nThe  alignment  of  national  and  local  expenditure  priorities  has  been  improved  by  a \nnumber of initiatives. The DBM has implemented the bottom-up budgeting (BUB) and planning \ninitiative,  encouraging  participatory  planning  processes  at  LGUs  and  gender-sensitive  project \nselection.15 In 2013, P8 billion  was budgeted, with 595 LGUs participating in the  initiative. The \nDILG has developed guidelines for the allocation and utilization of the Disaster Risk Reduction \nManagement Fund, and has finalized the compendium of planning documents required for the \npreparation of LGUs\u2019 comprehensive development plans. \n \n22. \nThe  accuracy  of  revenue  target  setting  by  LGUs  has  been  strengthened  with  the \ndevelopment  of  an  ESRE  module  on  LGU  revenue  forecasting.  This  instrument  allows  for  the \nreconciliation of LGU targets with the assessment from DOF regional offices, thereby improving \nthe credibility of budget preparation. In addition, a limitation to the use of certain LGU transfers \nfor personnel salaries of local economic enterprises and public utilities has been issued. \n \n23.   During subprogram 2, the government will produce the first implementation report of the \nmedium-term  road  map  for  LGU  PFM  reforms.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  harmonize  the  LGU \nplanning  processes  and  to  integrate  participatory  planning  principles  in  the  consolidated \nguidelines. The implementation of the BUB initiative will proceed, including the preparation of a \ngovernment-led evaluation of it and the review of its budgetary allocation formula. The DBM will \ninitiate  the  revision  of  the  Budget  Operations  Manual16  to  incorporate  policies  in  participatory \nbudgeting, performance-based mechanisms, and policy changes to the Special Education Fund \nand the regime of local economic enterprises. The DBM will incorporate an expenditure module \nto  the  ESRE  and  work  toward  the  approval  of  the  new  guidelines  for  the  establishment, \ndivestiture, and operations of local economic enterprises. \n \nGood  local  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability.  Assisting  inter-local \n24. \ncooperation  for  economic  development  and  service  delivery  is  a  government  priority.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the DILG has undertaken a review of the financing framework for LGU alliances \nto  guide  the  implementation  of  a  new  policy  framework  that  defines  the  corporate  powers  of \nLGU alliances, clarifies their legal personality, and defines their financing options. \n \n25. \nThe  DILG  has  improved  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  LGUs  toward  their \nconstituents  by  issuing  the  Full  Disclosure  Policy,  mandating  LGUs  to  publicly  disclose  key \noperations  reports.  In  addition, through the  Civil  Society  Participation  Fund, the government  is \nfacilitating the capacity building of civil society organizations to improve their analytical capacity. \nTo generate feedback from constituents on LGU service delivery performance,  and thus assist \nwith  budget formulation and policy  design, the  DILG  is  piloting the  Citizens\u2019  Satisfaction  Index \nSystem, which should become a key tool for measuring LGU performance.  \n \n\n                                                \n15 The BUB is a conditional grant from line agencies to LGUs to assist national development priorities through locally \nimplemented  projects.  It  encourages  local  good  governance  (through  the  Seal  of  Good  Housekeeping)  and \nparticipatory planning and budgeting practices.   \n\n16 The  manual  systematizes  methods  and  procedures  in  budget  preparation,  authorization,  execution,  and \n\naccountability for LGUs (Department of Budget and Management. 2012. Operations Budget Manual. Manila). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fThe  capacities  of \n\nlocal  government  political \nlocal  government  officials  and \n26. \nrepresentatives  continue  to  improve.  The  Newly  Elected  Officials  program  trained  100%  of \nnewly elected officials after the 2010 elections. The program has since undergone substantive \nredesign, and full participation of all new officials has been pursued after the 2013 elections.  \n \n27. \nImportant steps  toward assisting  women  representation at  LGU  committees  have been \ntaken,  and  the  government  remains  committed  to  the  implementation  of  gender-responsive \nplanning  and budgeting systems,  such  as through  the recent  BUB  initiative.  In  addition,  LGUs \nhave adopted a referral system on violence against women.  \n \n28. \nThe government continues to strengthen performance monitoring systems to assist local \naccountability  relationships.  In  particular,  the  DILG  has  improved  the  coverage  of  the  LGPMS \nwhere  over  90%  of  LGUs  now  provide  data  that  is  used  in  preparing  their  comprehensive \ndevelopment  plans.  The  information  provided  is  also  used  to  prepare  the  state  of  local \ngovernance  and  the  state  of  local  development  reports,  which  are  regularly  uploaded  into  the \nLGPMS website and are publicly available.  \n \n29.   During  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  implement  the  reviewed  policy  on  LGU \nalliances and will integrate compliance to the full disclosure policy as a condition of eligibility to \nLGU  financing  programs  such  as  the  PCF,  or  the  BUB  initiative.  Efforts  to  improve  the \ncapacities  of  local  officers  will  continue  with  the  development  of  a  performance  evaluation \nsystem  for  local  budget  officers.  The  improved  assessment  of  gender  and  development  plans \nand  budget  implementation  from  LGUs  will  be  pursued,  with  a  view  toward  increasing  the \ngender responsiveness of LGU budgets. The LGPMS will be substantially revised with two main \ngoals: (i) it will be integrated with the Seal of Good Governance, and (ii) its analytical capacity \nwill be improved in order to assist LGU decision making.     \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $802  million.  Subprogram  1  is  estimated  at  \n$401 million, including cofinancing, and an equal amount is estimated for subprogram 2 (Table \n1). The loan size is based on the financing needs of the Philippines, the strength of the policy \nreform  package,  and  its  development  impact.  The  Philippines\u2019  gross  financing  needs  remain \nhigh. In 2013, with a budget deficit target of 2%, the government will need to borrow P735 billion \n($16.5  billion).  In  2012,  deficit  financing  was  obtained  from  domestic  sources  (84%)  and \nexternal  sources  (16%).  About  38%  of  external  borrowing  was  accounted  for  by  official \ndevelopment assistance. In 2013, the government expected to borrow an estimated $1.5 billion \nthrough  official  development  assistance  to  close  the  budget  gap.  The  subprogram  1  loan \nproceeds will support key development spending in the 2013 budget, including the BUB initiative  \n(approximately $190 million) and the PCF (approximately $20 million). \n \n31. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $250  million  from  ADB's \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1,  which  will  be  disbursed  in  two \ninstallments  of  $125  million  each  during  2014.  The  government  requested  two  installments  in \norder to ensure efficient  cash flow  management  by  minimizing  the  incidence of  negative carry \nthat  may  occur  due  to  a  potential  mismatch  in  timing  between  disbursement  of  the  full  loan \namount  and  its  full  utilization.  The  government  also  aims  to  minimize  the  burden  of  financing \ncharges that would arise due to higher interest payments payable on a fully disbursed loan as \ncompared to  lower  commitment  charges  payable  on  a  loan  disbursed  in  two installments. The \nloan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years  (30%  annuity  amortization \nmethod), an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  this,  the  average  loan \nmaturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The financing plan is \nin  Table  1.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow \nunder  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full \nexchange  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources, in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.17 The proceeds of the policy-based \nloan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  as  the  borrower.  Subprogram  1  will \nreceive parallel cofinancing of $150 million from the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.  \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \n\nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (loan)a \nGovernment of the Philippines (in kind) \n\nTotal \n\nSubprogram 1 \n Amount  \n($ million) \n 250.00 \n \n150.00 \n    1.00 \n  401.0 \n\nSubprogram 2 \nAmount  \n($ million) \n250.00 \n \n150.00 \n1.00 \n401.00 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n62.30 \n\n \n\n37.40 \n0.30 \n100.00 \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\na  Negotiations with the Department of Finance on the cofinancing agreement were being finalized at the time of Board \ncirculation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE. \n \n32.  \nThe subprogram 1 period is from September 2010 to June 2013, and the subprogram 2 \nperiod is from July 2013 to June 2015. The DOF will be the executing agency for the program \nand  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  both  subprograms  and  the  medium-\nterm  results  framework.  The  CCD  will  serve  as  the  steering  committee  for  the  program,  as  it \nincludes all the implementing agencies and relevant stakeholders. The CCD will lead the review \nof  the  LGC,  and  the  recommendations  will  be  submitted  to  the  OCD  for  consideration.  The \nprogram\u2019s  implementing  agencies  include  the  DOF,  the  DILG,  the  DBM,  and  the  National \nEconomic  and  Development  Authority.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  responsible  for  the \nday-to-day  implementation  of  subprogram  1.  The  DOF  will  coordinate  with  implementing \nagencies and meet with them as required to monitor the progress on subprogram 1 reforms.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n33.  \nThe implementation of the reform program include the cost of implementation of the BUB \ninitiative, the PCF, the associated funds to the Seal of Good Governance, and costs related to \npolicy  development  and  implementation.  The  benefits  expected  include  allocative  efficiency \ngains from the reassignment of financial resources to local government budgets, the expected \nimpact  of  increased  local  government  expenditure  on  regional  gross  domestic  product,  and \nsavings from financial management efficiency.18   \n\n                                                \n17  ADB. 1998.

Good  governance  and  anticorruption  remain  permanent  priorities  of  the  government. \nThe  government\u2019s  PFM  plan  was  announced  in  February  2011,  and  its  local  counterpart\u2014the \nmedium-term LGU public financial management reform plan\u2014is currently being drafted, with the \nsupport  of  development  partners.19  ADB  has  assisted  local  government  finance  and  budget \nreforms  since  2007,  starting  with  the  LGFBR  reform  program  loan  completed  in  2009.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the DOF, \nthe DILG, the DBM, and the National Economic and Development Authority.  \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n35.  \nThe program will assist the government to reduce poverty and achieve inclusive growth \nby  (i)  helping  prioritize  and  improve  the  coordination  of  pro-poor  expenditures  at  national  and \nlocal  governments;  (ii)  assisting  in  the  creation  of  predictable  and  transparent  LGU  revenue \npolicies  that  support  private  entrepreneurship  and  business  investment;  and  (iii)  developing \nparticipatory and accountable planning, budgeting, and monitoring systems for LGUs that allow \nfor  good  project  selection  and  good  governance  practices  in  implementation.20  The  impact  on \nefficient service delivery is expected to be felt over the medium term, and particularly upon low \nincome individuals. Implementation of reforms will greatly assist the government\u2019s rehabilitation \nstrategy  of  local  governments  in  areas  affected  by  the  Yolanda  typhoon.  Subprogram  1  is \nclassified as having some gender elements. Key gender designs include the mainstreaming of \ngender  issues  in  local  expenditure  programs,  women\u2019s  participation  in  local  governance \nprocesses,  inclusion  of  gender  indicators  in  the  LGPMS,  and  the  inclusion  of  women  in \ncapacity-development initiatives. \n \nD. \n \n36.  \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  1  is \nclassified under category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n37.

ADB will provide TA to support capacity \ndevelopment in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. This \nprogram\u2019s emphasis on updating the schedules of market \nvalues for the RPT will contribute to higher revenues at the \nLGU level.   \nAn ADB TA project will finance studies to review LGC \nprovisions on intergovernmental fiscal relations, which will \nbe prepared and discussed in a participatory way to ensure  \n\nWavering commitment to reforms to the system of \nintergovernmental fiscal relations. \n\n                                                \n19 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 The  Summarized  Poverty  Reduction and Social Strategy  (accessible from  the  list  of  linked documents  in        \n    Appendix 2) provides further details.      \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks  \n \nParliamentary consideration and approval of ad \nhoc LGC reform proposals without providing an \nopportunity for consideration by stakeholders \nLack of coordination in policy formulation among \ncentral government agencies may undermine the \npace of reform. \n\nDistortion of allocation of budget due to weak PFM \nand procurement systems and lack of oversight. \n\nAvailability of resources for capacity development \nof LGUs.  \n\nMitigating Measures \nfull ownership among oversight agencies and LGUs.   \nThe review of the LGC will incorporate representatives from \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives from the \noutset to ensure their ownership of the process.    \nTo resolve possible issues and to ensure continued \nprogress, the CCD has been organized to address issues in \nintergovernmental coordination regarding the LGU issues. \nThe CCD has been accepted by oversight agencies and \nLGU leagues as a forum for openly discussing conflicting \npositions.  \nThe government is implementing a PFM road map with \nAusAID support. ADB support will focus on (i) results-based \nbudgeting, (ii) CSO initiatives related to mitigating public \nfinancial management and procurement risks at the local \ngovernment level, (iii) piloting innovations introduced under \nthe PFM reform map in ADB-supported sectors, and  \n(iv) analytical work in procurement.     \nThis program is developed in close coordination with the \nPhilippines Development Forum working group for \ndecentralization and local government, and financing for \ntraining programs will be provided by various development \npartners, such as the European Commission.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, CCD = Coordination \nCouncil  on  Decentralization,  CSO  =  civil  society  organization,  LGC  =  Local  Government  Code,  LGU  =  local \ngovernment unit, PFM = public financial management, RPT = real property tax, TA = technical assistance.    \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n38.  \nThe  government  and  the  DOF  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan documents. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \n39.  \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\nthe  programmatic  approach  for  the  Local  Government  Finance  and  Fiscal \nDecentralization Reform Program, and \nthe loan of $250,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the \nLocal  Government  Finance  and  Fiscal  Decentralization  Reform  Program,  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n21 January 2014 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nImproved delivery of \nservices by local \ngovernment units. \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets and Indicators \nwith Baselines \n\n \nBy 2017, overall performance index \nincreased by 15% (2011 baseline: \n4.31) \n \nBy 2017, CSIS increased by 10% \nfrom its 2013 baseline, currently \nunder preparation. \n \n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nDILG CSIS reports \n \n \n \nDILG LGPMS \n\n \n\n \n\nOutcome \nEfficient and transparent \nlocal governments with \nan adequate and \nequitable fiscal \nframework. \n\n \nDBM PFMAT \nreports \n \n \nDOF ESRE \n\n \nBy 2015, LGU PFMAT average \nscore improved by 20% (2013 \nbaseline: 2.34) \n \nBy 2015, real property tax collection \nincreased by 20% (2010 baseline: \nP29.6 billion) \n \nBy 2015, local government \nexpenditures increased by 20%.  \n(2011 baseline: 17% of total \nexpenditure) \n \n\nOutputs  \n1.
