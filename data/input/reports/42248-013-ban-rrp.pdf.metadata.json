Aid Effectiveness:   \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Rural \nDevelopment Project.1 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n2. \nThe project will contribute to poverty reduction by making social services and economic \nopportunities more accessible to rural people, including indigenous people and poor women, in \nthree hill districts (Banderban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati) of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).2 \n\n3. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  institutional  capacity;  improve  the  access  of  remote \ncommunities  to  main  roads;  and  provide  improved  irrigation  and  other  water  resources \ninfrastructure  and  agribusiness  support  to  increase  economic  opportunities,  particularly  of \nwomen, to improve rural incomes. \n\nCHT3 lies  in  the  southeast  of  Bangladesh,  bordering  India  and  Myanmar.  Its  land  area \n4. \ncovers  13,000  square  kilometers,  of  which  90%  are  sloping  lands.  The  area  has  indigenous \npeoples  from  11  distinct  ethnic  groups4 and  Bengali  inhabitants  who  were  settled  in  the  early \n1980s under government-sponsored transmigration. \n\nIn 1960, the construction of Kaptai Dam inundated 40% of the prime cultivable lands in \n5. \nthe CHT and displaced one-third (about 100,000) of the CHT population, resulting in intensified \nshifting  cultivation  in  all  three  districts  as  affected  people  were  resettled.  This  changed  CHT \nfrom  being  self-sufficient  in  cereals  to  becoming  a  food-deficit  area.  The  pressures  of  land \npolicies (transmigration and awarding of land to migrated persons) and their associated ethnic \nconfrontations aggravated an insurgency that spanned more than 20 years, and ended with the \nsigning  of  the  CHT  Accord  in  1997.  CHT  residents  were  economically  adversely  affected. \nInsurgency  also  damaged  much  of  the  rural  infrastructure  and  depleted  natural  resources,  as \nland  pressures  increased  from  an  influx  of  population  from  outside  CHT.5 Since  the  signing of \nthe CHT Accord, the area has had less development interventions than plain land Bangladesh.   \n\n6. \nOver  60%  of  CHT  rural  households  are  involved  in  agriculture  and  agricultural  labor. \nCommunities  are  remote,  and  road  and  market  infrastructure  is  limited.  CHT  suffers  from \nincome and human poverty.6 Average annual household incomes are about 30% lower than the \nnational average of Tk84,000. Overall incidence of severe poverty7 is 36% in CHT, within which \nindigenous  communities  have  higher  incidence  (44%)  than  other  communities  (31%).  About \n40% of the CHT population can be categorized vulnerable (with 8 months food access), while \nanother 10% is categorized invisible poor8 (with only 3 months food access). \n\n7. \nLack of access to markets impedes the transformation of production in CHT. Only 16% \nof CHT villages have access to paved roads,9 and the average distance between a village and \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2010.  Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Preparing  the  Second  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Rural \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n\n3  Comprising Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati districts. \n4  Each group has its own unique background, language, heritage, and culture. The major groups are: Bawm, Chak, \n\nChakma, Khumi, Kheyang, Lushai, Marma, Mro, Pankhua, Tanchungya, and Tripura. \n\n5  The non-indigenous population in CHT increased tenfold from around 100,000 in the 1950s to 1,000,000 in 2001. \n6  This refers to the social dimensions of poverty such as poor sanitation, poor access to education, etc. \n7  Below the hardcore poverty line is defined as food consumption less than 1,805 kilocalories per day. \n8  Refers to poor people who have food security issues and low nutrition diets. \n9  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  2009.  Socio-economic  Baseline  Survey  of  Chittagong  Hill \n\nTracts. Dhaka. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthe nearest paved road is 4.5 kilometers (km). Economic hubs are on average 7 km away from \nvillages. Manual transportation of goods from village to paved road severely limits the extent to \nwhich producers can benefit from larger national and regional markets. The planned rural road \nnetwork  for CHT  is  8,867  km;  83% of  it  is  currently  unpaved.  Less  than  half  of  the  population \nhas  access  to  tube  well  water,  and  supplies  are  scarce  (over  0.5  km  from  villages)  and  of \nvariable quality. \n\n8. \nGreater  land  pressures  caused  by  increased  population  have  resulted  in  land \ndegradation. Reduced fallow periods, deforestation, loss of topsoil, and increased water runoff \nhave serious impacts on food security and environmental sustainability. Changing land use and \nclimatic variations (including predicted impacts of climate change) require effective monitoring to \nunderstand  spatial  and  temporal  variations  in  the  resource  base  and  for  sustainable  natural \nresources planning and management.            \n\nCHT  is  further  challenged  by  a  unique  multi-tiered  administrative  structure  comprising \n9. \nministry and line department counterparts, district administration, local government institutions, \nand two sets of CHT-specific institutions. These are the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs \n(MOCHTA),  responsible  for  all  development  activities  in  CHT;  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts \nRegional  Council  (CHTRC),  which  supervises  and  coordinates  all  activities;  and  hill  district \ncouncils (HDCs), which are to implement activities. There are also traditional institutions of circle \nchiefs,  headmen,  and  karbari. 10  The  CHTRC  and  HDCs  remain  (i)  understaffed,  (ii)  lack \nrequisite  finances  and  technical  capacity,  and  (iii)  lack  sufficient  technical  capabilities  for \nplanning and undertaking development interventions. \n\n10. \nThe project is based on lessons learned from its predecessor, the Chittagong Hill Tracts \nRural  Development  Project  (CHTRDP),11 which  was  rated  successful.12 The  main  lessons  are \nas  follows:  (i)  improvement13 of  all-weather  road  communication  increases  access  of  the  rural \npopulation to growth center markets; (ii) attainment of high economic return on investments in \nrural infrastructure through savings in transport costs and promotion of commercial agriculture; \n(iii) establishment of new private institutions and enterprises around upgraded and rehabilitated \nroads and increased employment opportunities; and (iv) planning and implementation of a more \nrigorous  social  safeguards  to  avoid  resettlement  impacts  on  rural  communities  (particularly \nindigenous peoples) who lost land, crops, and income.  \n\nUnder  the  CHTRDP,  six  CHT-based  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs\u2014two  for \n11. \neach of the three project districts) were hired to assist the HDCs in implementing the community \ndevelopment  component.  NGOs\u2019  capacities  were  strengthened  under  the  loan  implementation \nprocess  and  stimulated  establishment  of  new  NGOs  in  the  area.  However,  CHT-based  NGOs \nremain small and specialized. There is potential to broaden their skills set under the project. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe project impact will be an increase in rural household incomes in subproject areas \nin CHT. The key performance target will be an increase in average annual household income in \nsubproject  areas  by  Tk20,000  at  2010  price  level  from  Tk63,000  in 2010.  The  outcome  of  the \nproject  will  be  increased  income-generating  opportunities  for  men  and  women  in  subproject \nareas. \n\n                                                 \n10 This is the village headman. The circle chief, headmen, and karbari  were established  by CHT Regulations of the \n\nyear 1900. \n\n11 ADB.  2000.

Completion Report: Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural Development Project in Bangladesh. Manila. \n13 Existing rural roads, including access tracks, were upgraded. \n\n\fC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThere  will  be  five  main  outputs:  (i) institutional  development  and  capacity  building, \n(ii) upgraded  rural  roads,  (iii)  maintenance  of  community  infrastructure,  (iv)  sustainable  micro \nagribusiness development (MAD), and (v) efficient project management operational. \n\n1. \n\nOutput A: Institutional Development and Capacity Building \n\n14. \nThe  project  will  strengthen  MOCHTA;  CHTRC;  Local  Government  Engineering \nDepartment (LGED) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives; \nand HDC through capacity building and training in (i) indigenous peoples and safeguard issues, \n(ii) village mapping, and (iii) improved project management and organizational enhancement. \n\n15. \nThe project will establish three district project management offices (DPMOs) within each \nHDC. Each HDC will be enhanced by an additional assistant engineer, recruited by the project, \nwho  will  receive  on-the-job  training  by  implementing  project  activities  in  association  with  the \nDPMO. At the end of the project, those engineers trained will be capable of implementing similar \ndevelopment  activities. These  positions  will  be  transferred  to  full-time  HDC  posts  by  year  4  of \nproject implementation to continue replication of rural development interventions. \n\nOutput B: Rural Roads \n\n2. \nThe  project  will  undertake  upgrading 14  and  improvement  of  166  km  of  rural  roads \n16. \ncomprising  (i)  105  km  of  union  (subdivision  of  an  upazila  [subdistrict])  roads;  (ii) 61 km  of \nupazila  roads;  (iii)  3,884  meters  of  bridges  and  culverts;  and  (iv)  extension  of  3  functional \nbuildings of Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati executive engineers\u2019 offices of LGED. Of \nthe total proposed road length, 71 km of the roads are to be in Bandarban, 53 km in Rangamati, \nand 42 km in Khagrachari. A comprehensive long list of potential rural roads (up to 264 km) was \nagreed  with  the  CHTRC  and  LGED  during  the  project  preparation  stage.  All  roads  to  be \nconstructed  under  the  project  will  be  selected  from  the  long  list.  Rigorous  procedures  will  be \nadopted  for  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  in  accordance  with  the  land  acquisition \nand resettlement framework (LARF) of the project.15 \n\nThe LGED will allocate sufficient budget to maintain completed roads in accordance with \n17. \ntheir  standard  procedures.  Women  belonging  to  labor  contracting  societies  (LCSs) 16\n will  be \nengaged to improve road shoulders, embankment stabilization, planting of trees on roadsides, \nplanting of shrubs on embankments, and other road maintenance works. \n\n3. \n\nOutput C: Community Infrastructure \n\n18. \nSmall  village  roads  and  footpaths  between  and  within  village  and  markets.  The \nproject  will  provide  improved  access  within  villages  and  to  union  roads  and  upazila  roads  by \nconstructing  about  92  km  of  village  roads,  footpaths,  and  steps  through  community  contracts. \nThis  will  facilitate  access  to  health  services,  schools,  and  markets;  and  provide  increased \neconomic opportunity. Communities will also construct about 100 market sheds17 with technical \nbackstopping from the LGED and capacity development support from an NGO. At each market \nshed,  50%  of  space  will  be  allocated  for  women  to  sell  their  goods  and  will  promote  gender \nequity in economic opportunities. \n\n                                                 \n14 Bituminous coated or herringbone brick. \n15 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 LCSs  comprise  poor  women  with  limited  income-earning  capabilities  who  carry  out  routine  maintenance  on  rural \nroads using basic hand tools and materials supplied by the LGED. Each LCS contract will have a ceiling value of \n$10,000. \n\n17 Simple shed structure with corrugated sheet roofing with toilet facilities for men and women, which will be located \n\nat local collection points. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n19. \nSmall-scale  water  resources  infrastructure.  The  project  will  improve  small-scale \nirrigation and water supply in up to 600 villages to be selected along roads already constructed \nby the CHTRDP or other agencies like LGED and Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board will \nconstruct. Villages up to 5 km from these roads will be included subject to them   (i) having no \nprior water resources interventions under the CHTRDP, and (ii) not receiving free rations from \nthe government. Activities will include construction of small weirs, lined channels, and provision \nof ring wells and shallow and deep tube wells for potable water. A total of about 4,000 hectares \nwill  receive  increased  irrigation  supplies  and  600  villages  will  benefit  from  improved  water \nsupply.  Civil  works  will  be  undertaken  by  beneficiary  communities  (using  the  LCS  concept), \nwhich will be trained in technical and management skills by a suitably qualified NGO. Inclusion \nof women in planning, implementation, and operation and maintenance (at least 30% of women \nwill be members of the water supply operation and maintenance team) of village water supply \nwill enhance their capacity and role in decision making, and strengthen technical skills. \n\n20.  Watershed management. The project will support participatory watershed management \ninterventions  (including  vegetative  and  bioengineering  measures,  agroforestry,  growing  and \nintercropping leguminous crops, composting, mulching of root crops, and small-scale structural \nworks)  in  six  sample  watersheds.  Two  watersheds  per  district  were  pre-identified  during  the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance.  Activities  will  be  implemented  by  beneficiary \ncommunities, with support from a suitably qualified NGO; and will cover about 55 hectares on a \npilot basis, which may be replicated based on lessons learned.18  \n\n4. \n\nOutput D: Micro Agribusiness Development \n\n21. \nThe MAD component will improve incomes of poor rural households through (i) capacity \nbuilding  in  high  potential  commodities,  marketing,  and  organizational  skills;  (ii)  marketing  by \nrepresentation;  and \ninterest  groups,  comprising  30%  women\u2019s \nestablishing  common \n(iii) improved  agriculture  production  of  high  potential  commodities  of  CHT  like  pond  fisheries, \nhigh-value  fruits  and  vegetables,  and  medicinal  plants.  The  MAD  component  will  benefit  from \nmarkets to be built along rural roads (implemented under the CHTRDP and the project) and will \nbe implemented in nine upazilas. Implementation will be through the same NGO responsible for \nsocial  mobilization  and  watershed  management,  with  specialist  support  for  MAD  activities  as \nrequired from the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute.19  \n\n5. \n\nOutput E: Project Management \n\n22. \nProject  management  support  will  include  the  (i)  establishment  of  project  management \noffice (PMO) and DPMO;20 (ii) provision of technical and implementation expertise from project \nimplementation  consultants  (PICs);  and  (iii)  establishment  of  a  safeguards  and  quality \nmonitoring cell (SQMC), which will provide impartial observation of project implementation to be \nreported independently to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Individual consultants (national) \nwill provide survey, design, and implementation support for the infrastructure interventions. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n23. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $70.81  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure  category  and  detailed  cost  estimates  by  financier  are  included  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM). \n\n \n\n                                                 \n18 Activities will be reviewed at midterm, based on which a stand-alone grant project for poor shifting cultivators may \n\nbe formulated. \n\n19 The  Bangladesh  Agriculture  Research  Institute  is  functional  in  the  area  and  was  consulted  during  the  project \n\npreparation process for concurrence to support activities. \n\n20 The PMO and all DPMOs will be provided a special project allowance to enhance their performance and incentivize \nefficient and collaborative project implementation.

MOCHTA  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation.  The  CHTRC  will  be  the  lead  implementing  agency  and  the  LGED  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for the rural roads component. A PMO headed by a project director will be \nestablished  within  the  CHTRC  to  manage  and  closely  coordinate  project  activities  across  all \nagencies. Another project director responsible for the rural roads component will be appointed \nfrom  the  LGED  to  implement  the  rural  roads.  One  DPMO  for  each  of  the  three  districts  will \nreport directly to the project director, PMO.  \n\n                                                 \n21 The loan will finance recurrent costs and may also finance transportation and insurance costs. \n22 Project  Administration  Manual,  Table  15:  Detailed  Cost  Estimates  by  Financier  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n27. \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  by  MOCHTA.  The  PSC  will  be \nresponsible for overall coordination and policy guidance and will meet as required, but at least \ntwice  annually.  A  regional  coordination  committee  will  be  established  in  CHT  for  more \nimmediate decisions on project-related matters. The committee will meet quarterly and refer any \ninteragency  problems  to  the  PSC.  A  district  level  coordination  committee  will  facilitate  project \nimplementation  and  monitoring  with  all  agencies  below  the  district  level.  The  committee  will \nconvene monthly. \n\nThe PIC will be selected using the quality- and cost-based selection23 method. A total of \n28. \n561 person-months of specialist consulting services will be required, of which 36 person-months \nwill be for the international rural development specialist/team leader and 525 person-months for \nnational  consulting  services.  National  NGOs  (given  their  in-depth  knowledge  of  local  issues, \nlinguistic  advantage,  and  ease  of  mobility  in  the  area)  will  be  recruited  using  the    quality-  and \ncost-based  selection  method  (90:10  weighting)  to  provide  social  mobilization  and  community \ninfrastructure  and  MAD  support.  There  will  be  three  NGO  packages  for  outputs  C and  D  (one \nper  district).  Resettlement  activities  will  be  implemented  by  a  separate  NGO  with  prior \nexperience  in  similar  types  of  activities.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n\n29. \nProcurement  of  works  and  goods  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). For national competitive bidding, \nthe  government\u2019s  applicable  Public  Procurement  Act  and  rules  as  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be \nused. \n\n30. \nCoordination  with  development  partners.  The  only  ongoing  major  development \nproject in CHT is the Promotion of Development and Confidence Building in the Chittagong Hill \nTracts  Program.  This  is  a  $160  million  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP) 24 \ninitiative focusing on rural livelihoods development and confidence building to underpin the CHT \naccord.  A  draft  memorandum  of  understanding  developed  with  UNDP  will  avoid  duplication  of \nactivities.25  \n\n The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n31. \nthe PAM.26 \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated Project completion date \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\nArrangements \nSeptember 2011\u2013November 2018 \n31 December 2018 \n30 June 2019 \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing agencies  Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council (lead implementing agency) \n\nPSC, chaired by minister, Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs \nMinistry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nLocal Government Engineering Department (for rural roads) \nProject management office, 20 staff \nDistrict project management office, 10 staff \nNational competitive \nbidding (upazila [subdistrict] roads) \nNational competitive \n\n12 contracts \n\n20 contracts \n\n$18.4 million \n\n$9.8 million \n\n                                                 \n23 The priority for PIC services is quality outputs.

The \n32. \nproject provides benefits through reduced transportation cost. New opportunities from improved \naccess  to  markets  and  the  support  of  value  chain  development  activities  will  lead  to  more \ndiversified  cropping  patterns,  increased  cropping  intensities  (up  to  40%),  and  improved  yields. \nThe  project  will  lead  to  increased  rice  production  of  1,800  tons  per  year  and  to  significant \nincreases  in  the  production  of  cash  crops  such  as  ginger  and  turmeric.  Fruit  production  will \nincrease by some 13,000 tons per year as a result of MAD interventions. The economic internal \nrate of return for the overall project is robust at 15.6% which reduces to 13.0% with a 20% cost \noverrun for community infrastructure combined with a 20% shortfall in benefits.  \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n33. \nAssessments  were  made  of  MOCHTA,  CHTRC,  and  LGED  financial  management \nsystems  to  ensure  that  financial  management  and  procurement  capacities  are  adequate  to \nimplement the project. Financial management on CHTRDP was also reviewed. The project has \nestablished  clear  input  and  output  targets  to  ensure  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency.  Procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  in \naccordance  with  its  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  For \nnational  competitive  bidding,  the  government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act,  2006  and  the  Public \nProcurement  Rules,  2008  will  be  used  with  such  amendments  as  required  to  ensure \nconsistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n\n34. \nThe  procurement  capacity  of  MOCHTA,  CHTRC,  and  LGED  varies  significantly.  Given \nlimited  development  activities  and  government  expenditure  in  CHT,  MOCHTA,  CHTRC,  and \nHDCs  have  limited  prior  experience  in  procurement  activities.  Contrastingly,  LGED  is  a  highly \ncapable  institution  with  significant  knowledge  and  experience  of  implementing  externally  and \ngovernment-financed  rural \ninfrastructure  projects.  Risk  will  be  mitigated  by  recruiting \nexperienced and competent staff on a competitive basis for the PMO and DPMO. PICs will also \nprovide  daily  support  to  the  project  director,  PMO  and  DPMOs  to  facilitate  institutional \nstrengthening through a combination of formal and on-the-job training. \n\n35. \nRisks  associated  with  project  management,  including  procurement  and  disbursement, \nwill  be  mitigated  by  (i)  engaging  international  and  national  consultants  to  advise  and  assist  in \nthe  procurement  of  goods  and  services;  (ii)  establishing  a  competent  PMO  and  DPMO  with \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nexperienced  and  capable  personnel  directly  engaged \nthrough  a  competitive  process; \n(iii) providing  capacity  building  on  disbursement,  financial,  and  project  management  for  all \nproject  staff;  (iv)  establishing  an  independent  SQMC  to  provide  technical  guidance  and \noversight on resettlement implementation and quality control of civil works; (v) requiring that civil \nwork contracts include a condition that contractors adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date); (vi) the PMO periodically inspecting the contractor\u2019s fund withdrawals and \nsettlements; and (vii) reporting on project activities and implementation on the MOCHTA, LGED, \nand  project  websites  to  foster  transparency  and  timely  awarding  of  contracts.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the government, MOCHTA, CHTRC, \nand LGED. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM (footnote 26). \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \nThe  Socio-Economic  Baseline  Survey  carried  out  by  UNDP  in  200827 found  that  the \n36. \naverage  income  in  the  CHT  region  is  about  Tk66,000  per  year  per  family  of  5.2,  much  below \nBangladesh\u2019s  average  of  Tk84,000.  ADB  conducted  a  separate  socioeconomic  study  of \n60 villages likely to be included under the project covering 6,040 people. This study found 53% \nof the households (47% in the valley regions and 61.2% in the hill areas) to be very poor, 37.3% \n(43.4%  in  the  valley  regions  and  29.4%  in  the  hill  areas)  poor,  and  9.5%  (9.6%  in  the  valley \nregions and 9.3% in the hill areas) better off.28 It also found that (i) less connected villages have \nmuch higher poverty incidences; and (ii) the closer one gets to the market, the lower the poverty \nincidence; and the higher the size of the relative middle class, the higher the size of the better \noff. \n\n37. \nThe project will have a positive impact on reducing poverty. A high proportion of project \nbenefits will accrue directly to households. Allowing for annual inflation from 2009 to 2011, the \ncurrent  equivalent  amounts  are  about  Tk60,000  and  Tk70,000  per  household  per  year  for  the \nlower and upper poverty line groups. In this case, an annual increase of Tk10,000 in household \nincome arising from project interventions represents an increase of 14%\u201317% for households at \nthe poverty line and could lift many households above the poverty line. \n\n38. \nGender and development. Implementation of a gender action plan will help ensure that \nwomen  participate  in  and  benefit  from  rural  infrastructure. 29  Women\u2019s  involvement  in \ninfrastructure  planning  and  implementation  will  enable  them  to  participate  in  decision  making \nand  better  empower  them  to  express  their  needs.  New  jobs  will  be  created  for  women  in \nconstruction and maintenance through LCSs, and elements of the core labor standards will be \nenforced to benefit them. Allocation of 50% of market space for women and 30% representation \nin agriculture common interest groups will encourage greater engagement in economic activity. \nWomen  will  take  the  lead  role  in  planning  of  village  water  supply,  particularly  hand  pump \nlocations, and will be responsible for collection of user fees. They will have skills enhanced in \nbasic maintenance for which they will receive organizational and technical training. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n39. \nIndigenous  peoples. The project is categorized A for indigenous peoples. The area is \nhome  to  41%  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  total  indigenous  peoples  population.  The  indigenous  peoples \nplan  details  principles  and  methodology  to  design  and  implement  the  project  to  ensure \nindigenous  peoples  (i)  receive  culturally  appropriate  social  and  economic  benefits,  (ii)  do  not \nsuffer  adverse  impacts  as  a  result  of  projects,  and  (iii)  can  participate  actively  in  projects  that \n\n                                                 \n27 UNDP. 2009. Socio-Economic Baseline Survey of Chittagong Hill Tracts. Dhaka. \n28 In the ADB study, \u201cvery poor\u201d is defined as having not enough income to meet basic food requirements, \u201cpoor\u201d as \nhaving  enough  to  meet  basic  needs  but  no  surplus/savings,  and  \u201cbetter  off\u201d  as  those  families  that  can  generate \nsavings. \n\n29 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\faffect them.30 There are four key elements: (i) where there  are resettlement impacts, payment \nwill  be  made  (under  the  loan)  for  indigenous  peoples  common  lands  to  usufruct  and  legal \nowners  of  land;  (ii)  participatory  village  mapping  to  ensure  inclusion  in  infrastructure  planning \nand  development,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism;  (iii)  assistance  to  minor  indigenous \npeoples groups that are more vulnerable to disproportionate benefit capture; and (iv) awareness \nraising of government officers in indigenous peoples issues and resources of CHT. \n\n40. \nResettlement. The project is categorized A for resettlement. Lessons learned from the \nCHTRDP indicate that lack of transparent guidelines for project land acquisition appears to have \nresulted  in  poverty-inducing  impacts.  Much  of  the  land  in  CHT  is  under  customary  land \nownership. In terms of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), this is equivalent, in terms of \neligibility for compensation, to titled land ownership. There may also be titled land to be acquired \nunder  the  project.  Therefore,  the  project  LARF  outlines  an  approach  to  the  valuation  and \ncompensation of land that is a blend of statutory and customary laws, for valuation, verification, \nand  settling  disputes.  The  LARF  also  details  a  robust  system  for  monitoring  the  resettlement \nand  land  acquisition  process,31 including  provision  for  verification  of  monitoring  by  an  external \nexpert.  The  PIC  safeguard  specialist,  SQMC,  and  implementing  NGO  will  provide  further \nsupport to ensure a rigorous process is followed for resettlement planning and implementation, \nparticularly payment of compensation.  \n\n41. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  B  for  environment.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  and  an  initial  environmental  examination  for  six  sample \nsubprojects have been prepared.32  Since the project will improve the existing rural road network \nand  community  infrastructure  and  new  roads  are  not  planned,  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are expected. Likely impacts from construction activities are (i) silting of \ncanals  and  drainage  structures,  (ii)  reduction \n(iv) deterioration of water quality. An environmental management plan has been prepared and \nwill be adhered to in construction contracts. Those likely impacts can be mitigated through the \nimplementation  of  the  environment  management  plan.  CHTRC  institutional  capacity  for \nimplementation  of  environmental  safeguards  is  assessed  as  weak,  therefore  the  necessary \nsupport  is  provided  both  project-wise  (component  A)  and  through  provision  of  relevant \nspecialists  in  the  PMO  and  SQMC.  The  LGED  has  sufficient  experience  in  preparing  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  for  road  subprojects.  For  all  subprojects,  formal  and  documented \npublic  consultation  and  information  disclosure  will  be  required  in  compliance  with  ADB \ninformation disclosure and consultation requirements. \n\nin  water \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nDespite  a  challenging  policy  framework  and  political  environment,  the  CHTRDP  was \n42. \nrated  successful.  The main  assumption  for  the  second  CHTRDP  is  that  the  1997  CHT  accord \nand  the  enabling  legislation  remain  effective.33 To  ensure  continuity  in  project  implementation, \nthe PMO and DPMOs will be established so that they will continue to function regardless of the \nexisting legal challenge to the CHTRC Act, 1998. Although progress remains to be made in the \nimplementation  of  the  CHT  accord,  particularly  with  regard  to  securing  land  titles  and  in  the \ntransfer of subjects as stated in the HDC Act of 1999, this is not expected to be an impediment \nto  project  implementation  and  realization  of  benefits.  Progress  has  also  been  made  in  policy \ndialogue  on  amendment  of  the  CHT  Land  Disputes  Resolution  Commission  Act,  2001,  which \n\n                                                 \n30 Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework, Section VI: Monitoring and Evaluation (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2).
