I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Rural \nDevelopment Project.1 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The project will contribute to poverty reduction by making social services and economic \nopportunities more accessible to rural people, including indigenous people and poor women, in \nthree hill districts (Banderban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati) of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).2 \n3.  The  project  will  strengthen  institutional  capacity;  improve  the  access  of  remote \ncommunities  to  main  roads;  and  provide  improved  irrigation  and  other  water  resources \ninfrastructure  and  agribusiness  support  to  increase  economic  opportunities,  particularly  of \nwomen, to improve rural incomes. \n4.  CHT3 lies in the southeast of Bangladesh, bordering India and Myanmar. Its land area \ncovers 13,000 square kilometers, of which 90% are sloping lands. The area has indigenous \npeoples from 11 distinct ethnic groups4 and Bengali inhabitants who were settled in the early \n1980s under government-sponsored transmigration. \n5.  In 1960, the construction of Kaptai Dam inundated 40% of the prime cultivable lands in \nthe CHT and displaced one-third (about 100,000) of the CHT population, resulting in intensified \nshifting cultivation in all three districts as affected people were resettled. This changed CHT \nfrom being self-sufficient in cereals to becoming a food-deficit area. The pressures of land \npolicies (transmigration and awarding of land to migrated persons) and their associated ethnic \nconfrontations aggravated an insurgency that spanned more than 20 years, and ended with the \nsigning of the CHT Accord in 1997. CHT residents were economically adversely affected. \nInsurgency also damaged much of the rural infrastructure and depleted natural resources, as \nland pressures increased from an influx of population from outside CHT.5 Since the signing of \nthe CHT Accord, the area has had less development interventions than plain land Bangladesh.   \n6.  Over 60% of CHT rural households are involved in agriculture and agricultural labor. \nCommunities  are  remote,  and  road  and  market  infrastructure  is  limited.  CHT  suffers  from \nincome and human poverty.6 Average annual household incomes are about 30% lower than the \nnational average of Tk84,000. Overall incidence of severe poverty7 is 36% in CHT, within which \nindigenous communities have higher incidence (44%) than other communities (31%). About \n40% of the CHT population can be categorized vulnerable (with 8 months food access), while \nanother 10% is categorized invisible poor8 (with only 3 months food access). \n7.  Lack of access to markets impedes the transformation of production in CHT. Only 16% \nof CHT villages have access to paved roads,9 and the average distance between a village and \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010. Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Second Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n3  Comprising Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati districts. \n4  Each group has its own unique background, language, heritage, and culture. The major groups are: Bawm, Chak, \nChakma, Khumi, Kheyang, Lushai, Marma, Mro, Pankhua, Tanchungya, and Tripura. \n5  The non-indigenous population in CHT increased tenfold from around 100,000 in the 1950s to 1,000,000 in 2001. \n6  This refers to the social dimensions of poverty such as poor sanitation, poor access to education, etc. \n7  Below the hardcore poverty line is defined as food consumption less than 1,805 kilocalories per day. \n8  Refers to poor people who have food security issues and low nutrition diets. \n9  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2009. Socio-economic Baseline Survey of Chittagong Hill \nTracts. Dhaka. ", "2 \nthe nearest paved road is 4.5 kilometers (km). Economic hubs are on average 7 km away from \nvillages. Manual transportation of goods from village to paved road severely limits the extent to \nwhich producers can benefit from larger national and regional markets. The planned rural road \nnetwork for CHT is 8,867 km; 83% of it is currently unpaved. Less than half of the population \nhas access to tube well water, and supplies are scarce (over 0.5 km from villages) and of \nvariable quality. \n8.  Greater  land  pressures  caused  by  increased  population  have  resulted  in  land \ndegradation. Reduced fallow periods, deforestation, loss of topsoil, and increased water runoff \nhave serious impacts on food security and environmental sustainability. Changing land use and \nclimatic variations (including predicted impacts of climate change) require effective monitoring to \nunderstand spatial and temporal variations in the resource base and for sustainable natural \nresources planning and management.            \n9.  CHT is further challenged by a unique multi-tiered administrative structure comprising \nministry and line department counterparts, district administration, local government institutions, \nand two sets of CHT-specific institutions. These are the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs \n(MOCHTA),  responsible  for  all  development  activities  in  CHT;  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts \nRegional Council (CHTRC), which supervises and coordinates all activities; and hill district \ncouncils (HDCs), which are to implement activities. There are also traditional institutions of circle \nchiefs,  headmen,  and  karbari.10 The  CHTRC  and  HDCs  remain  (i)  understaffed,  (ii)  lack \nrequisite  finances  and  technical  capacity,  and  (iii)  lack  sufficient  technical  capabilities  for \nplanning and undertaking development interventions. \n10.  The project is based on lessons learned from its predecessor, the Chittagong Hill Tracts \nRural Development Project (CHTRDP),11 which was rated successful.12 The main lessons are \nas follows: (i) improvement13 of all-weather road communication increases access of the rural \npopulation to growth center markets; (ii) attainment of high economic return on investments in \nrural infrastructure through savings in transport costs and promotion of commercial agriculture; \n(iii) establishment of new private institutions and enterprises around upgraded and rehabilitated \nroads and increased employment opportunities; and (iv) planning and implementation of a more \nrigorous social safeguards to avoid resettlement impacts on rural communities (particularly \nindigenous peoples) who lost land, crops, and income.  \n11.  Under  the  CHTRDP,  six  CHT-based  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs\u2014two  for \neach of the three project districts) were hired to assist the HDCs in implementing the community \ndevelopment component. NGOs\u2019 capacities were strengthened under the loan implementation \nprocess and stimulated establishment of new NGOs in the area. However, CHT-based NGOs \nremain small and specialized. There is potential to broaden their skills set under the project. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project impact will be an increase in rural household incomes in subproject areas \nin CHT. The key performance target will be an increase in average annual household income in \nsubproject areas by Tk20,000 at 2010 price level from Tk63,000 in 2010. The outcome of the \nproject will be increased income-generating opportunities for men and women in subproject \nareas. \n                                                 \n10 This is the village headman. The circle chief, headmen, and karbari were established by CHT Regulations of the \nyear 1900. \n11 ADB. 2000.

There  will  be  five  main  outputs:  (i) institutional  development  and  capacity  building, \n(ii) upgraded rural roads, (iii) maintenance of community infrastructure, (iv) sustainable micro \nagribusiness development (MAD), and (v) efficient project management operational. \n1.  Output A: Institutional Development and Capacity Building \n14.  The  project  will  strengthen  MOCHTA;  CHTRC;  Local  Government  Engineering \nDepartment (LGED) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives; \nand HDC through capacity building and training in (i) indigenous peoples and safeguard issues, \n(ii) village mapping, and (iii) improved project management and organizational enhancement. \n15.  The project will establish three district project management offices (DPMOs) within each \nHDC. Each HDC will be enhanced by an additional assistant engineer, recruited by the project, \nwho will receive on-the-job training by implementing project activities in association with the \nDPMO. At the end of the project, those engineers trained will be capable of implementing similar \ndevelopment activities. These positions will be transferred to full-time HDC posts by year 4 of \nproject implementation to continue replication of rural development interventions. \n2.  Output B: Rural Roads \n16.  The  project  will  undertake  upgrading14 and  improvement  of  166  km  of  rural  roads \ncomprising (i) 105 km of union (subdivision of an upazila [subdistrict]) roads; (ii) 61 km of \nupazila roads; (iii) 3,884 meters of bridges and culverts; and (iv) extension of 3 functional \nbuildings of Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati executive engineers\u2019 offices of LGED. Of \nthe total proposed road length, 71 km of the roads are to be in Bandarban, 53 km in Rangamati, \nand 42 km in Khagrachari. A comprehensive long list of potential rural roads (up to 264 km) was \nagreed  with  the  CHTRC  and  LGED  during  the  project  preparation  stage.  All  roads  to  be \nconstructed under the project will be selected from the long list. Rigorous procedures will be \nadopted for resettlement planning and implementation in accordance with the land acquisition \nand resettlement framework (LARF) of the project.15 \n17.  The LGED will allocate sufficient budget to maintain completed roads in accordance with \ntheir standard procedures. Women belonging to labor contracting societies (LCSs)16will be \n \nengaged to improve road shoulders, embankment stabilization, planting of trees on roadsides, \nplanting of shrubs on embankments, and other road maintenance works. \n3.  Output C: Community Infrastructure \n18.  Small village roads and footpaths between and within village and markets. The \nproject will provide improved access within villages and to union roads and upazila roads by \nconstructing about 92 km of village roads, footpaths, and steps through community contracts. \nThis will facilitate access to health services, schools, and markets; and provide increased \neconomic opportunity. Communities will also construct about 100 market sheds17 with technical \nbackstopping from the LGED and capacity development support from an NGO. At each market \nshed, 50% of space will be allocated for women to sell their goods and will promote gender \nequity in economic opportunities. \n                                                 \n14 Bituminous coated or herringbone brick. \n15 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 LCSs comprise poor women with limited income-earning capabilities who carry out routine maintenance on rural \nroads using basic hand tools and materials supplied by the LGED. Each LCS contract will have a ceiling value of \n$10,000. \n17 Simple shed structure with corrugated sheet roofing with toilet facilities for men and women, which will be located \nat local collection points. \n ", "4 \n19.  Small-scale  water  resources  infrastructure.  The  project  will  improve  small-scale \nirrigation and water supply in up to 600 villages to be selected along roads already constructed \nby the CHTRDP or other agencies like LGED and Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board will \nconstruct. Villages up to 5 km from these roads will be included subject to them   (i) having no \nprior water resources interventions under the CHTRDP, and (ii) not receiving free rations from \nthe government. Activities will include construction of small weirs, lined channels, and provision \nof ring wells and shallow and deep tube wells for potable water. A total of about 4,000 hectares \nwill receive increased irrigation supplies and 600 villages will benefit from improved water \nsupply. Civil works will be undertaken by beneficiary communities (using the LCS concept), \nwhich will be trained in technical and management skills by a suitably qualified NGO. Inclusion \nof women in planning, implementation, and operation and maintenance (at least 30% of women \nwill be members of the water supply operation and maintenance team) of village water supply \nwill enhance their capacity and role in decision making, and strengthen technical skills. \n20.  Watershed management. The project will support participatory watershed management \ninterventions (including vegetative and bioengineering measures, agroforestry, growing and \nintercropping leguminous crops, composting, mulching of root crops, and small-scale structural \nworks) in six sample watersheds. Two watersheds per district were pre-identified during the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance.  Activities  will  be  implemented  by  beneficiary \ncommunities, with support from a suitably qualified NGO; and will cover about 55 hectares on a \npilot basis, which may be replicated based on lessons learned.18  \n4.  Output D: Micro Agribusiness Development \n21.  The MAD component will improve incomes of poor rural households through (i) capacity \nbuilding in high potential commodities, marketing, and organizational skills; (ii) marketing by \nestablishing  common  interest  groups,  comprising  30%  women\u2019s  representation;  and \n(iii) improved agriculture production of high potential commodities of CHT like pond fisheries, \nhigh-value fruits and vegetables, and medicinal plants. The MAD component will benefit from \nmarkets to be built along rural roads (implemented under the CHTRDP and the project) and will \nbe implemented in nine upazilas. Implementation will be through the same NGO responsible for \nsocial mobilization and watershed management, with specialist support for MAD activities as \nrequired from the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute.19  \n5.  Output E: Project Management \n22.  Project management support will include the (i) establishment of project management \noffice (PMO) and DPMO;20 (ii) provision of technical and implementation expertise from project \nimplementation  consultants  (PICs);  and  (iii)  establishment  of  a  safeguards  and  quality \nmonitoring cell (SQMC), which will provide impartial observation of project implementation to be \nreported independently to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Individual consultants (national) \nwill provide survey, design, and implementation support for the infrastructure interventions. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n23.  The project is estimated to cost $70.81 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure  category  and  detailed  cost  estimates  by  financier  are  included  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM). \n \n                                                 \n18 Activities will be reviewed at midterm, based on which a stand-alone grant project for poor shifting cultivators may \nbe formulated. \n19 The Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute is functional in the area and was consulted during the project \npreparation process for concurrence to support activities. \n20 The PMO and all DPMOs will be provided a special project allowance to enhance their performance and incentivize \nefficient and collaborative project implementation. This is additional, and will vary between 10% and 20% of PMO \nand DPMO staff salaries as incentive for working in a challenging area. \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million)  \nItem  Amount a \nA.

Compensation for resettlement impacts (including land \nacquisition) are to be financed under the loan. A robust procedure is established under the \nproject to ensure transparency and accountability in land acquisition and resettlement payment \namounting to $2.3 million, excluding costs of consulting services for the resettlement NGO \n(footnote 15). \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  55.00  77.7 \nGovernment of Bangladesh  14.36  20.3 \nBeneficiaries a  1.45  2.0 \nTotal  70.81  100.0 \na To be provided in cash or in kind. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  MOCHTA  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation. The CHTRC will be the lead implementing agency and the LGED will be the \nimplementing agency for the rural roads component. A PMO headed by a project director will be \nestablished within the CHTRC to manage and closely coordinate project activities across all \nagencies. Another project director responsible for the rural roads component will be appointed \nfrom the LGED to implement the rural roads. One DPMO for each of the three districts will \nreport directly to the project director, PMO.  \n                                                 \n21 The loan will finance recurrent costs and may also finance transportation and insurance costs. \n22 Project Administration Manual, Table 15: Detailed Cost Estimates by Financier (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n27.  A project steering committee (PSC) will be established by MOCHTA. The PSC will be \nresponsible for overall coordination and policy guidance and will meet as required, but at least \ntwice  annually.  A  regional  coordination  committee  will  be  established  in  CHT  for  more \nimmediate decisions on project-related matters. The committee will meet quarterly and refer any \ninteragency problems to the PSC. A district level coordination committee will facilitate project \nimplementation and monitoring with all agencies below the district level. The committee will \nconvene monthly. \n28.  The PIC will be selected using the quality- and cost-based selection23 method. A total of \n561 person-months of specialist consulting services will be required, of which 36 person-months \nwill be for the international rural development specialist/team leader and 525 person-months for \nnational consulting services. National NGOs (given their in-depth knowledge of local issues, \nlinguistic advantage, and ease of mobility in the area) will be recruited using the  quality- and \ncost-based selection method (90:10 weighting) to provide social mobilization and community \ninfrastructure and MAD support. There will be three NGO packages for outputs C and D (one \nper  district).  Resettlement  activities  will  be  implemented  by  a  separate  NGO  with  prior \nexperience in similar types of activities. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n29.  Procurement  of  works  and  goods  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). For national competitive bidding, \nthe government\u2019s applicable Public Procurement Act and rules as acceptable to ADB will be \nused. \n30.  Coordination  with  development  partners.  The  only  ongoing  major  development \nproject in CHT is the Promotion of Development and Confidence Building in the Chittagong Hill \nTracts Program. This is a $160 million United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)24 \ninitiative focusing on rural livelihoods development and confidence building to underpin the CHT \naccord.

Economic and financial analyses indicate that the project is economically viable. The \nproject provides benefits through reduced transportation cost. New opportunities from improved \naccess to markets and the support of value chain development activities will lead to more \ndiversified cropping patterns, increased cropping intensities (up to 40%), and improved yields. \nThe project will lead to increased rice production of 1,800 tons per year and to significant \nincreases in the production of cash crops such as ginger and turmeric. Fruit production will \nincrease by some 13,000 tons per year as a result of MAD interventions. The economic internal \nrate of return for the overall project is robust at 15.6% which reduces to 13.0% with a 20% cost \noverrun for community infrastructure combined with a 20% shortfall in benefits.  \nB.  Governance \n33.  Assessments  were  made  of  MOCHTA,  CHTRC,  and  LGED  financial  management \nsystems to ensure that financial management and procurement capacities are adequate to \nimplement the project. Financial management on CHTRDP was also reviewed. The project has \nestablished clear input and output targets to ensure good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency.  Procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  in \naccordance with its Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. For \nnational competitive bidding, the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act, 2006 and the Public \nProcurement  Rules,  2008  will  be  used  with  such  amendments  as  required  to  ensure \nconsistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n34.  The procurement capacity of MOCHTA, CHTRC, and LGED varies significantly. Given \nlimited development activities and government expenditure in CHT, MOCHTA, CHTRC, and \nHDCs have limited prior experience in procurement activities. Contrastingly, LGED is a highly \ncapable institution with significant knowledge and experience of implementing externally and \ngovernment-financed  rural  infrastructure  projects.  Risk  will  be  mitigated  by  recruiting \nexperienced and competent staff on a competitive basis for the PMO and DPMO. PICs will also \nprovide  daily  support  to  the  project  director,  PMO  and  DPMOs  to  facilitate  institutional \nstrengthening through a combination of formal and on-the-job training. \n35.  Risks associated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, \nwill be mitigated by (i) engaging international and national consultants to advise and assist in \nthe procurement of goods and services; (ii) establishing a competent PMO and DPMO with \n ", "8 \nexperienced  and  capable  personnel  directly  engaged  through  a  competitive  process; \n(iii) providing  capacity  building  on  disbursement,  financial,  and  project  management  for  all \nproject  staff;  (iv)  establishing  an  independent  SQMC  to  provide  technical  guidance  and \noversight on resettlement implementation and quality control of civil works; (v) requiring that civil \nwork contracts include a condition that contractors adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date); (vi) the PMO periodically inspecting the contractor\u2019s fund withdrawals and \nsettlements; and (vii) reporting on project activities and implementation on the MOCHTA, LGED, \nand  project  websites  to  foster  transparency  and  timely  awarding  of  contracts.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the government, MOCHTA, CHTRC, \nand LGED. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM (footnote 26). \nC.  Poverty and Social \n36.  The Socio-Economic Baseline Survey carried out by UNDP in 200827 found that the \naverage income in the CHT region is about Tk66,000 per year per family of 5.2, much below \nBangladesh\u2019s  average  of  Tk84,000.  ADB  conducted  a  separate  socioeconomic  study  of \n60 villages likely to be included under the project covering 6,040 people. This study found 53% \nof the households (47% in the valley regions and 61.2% in the hill areas) to be very poor, 37.3% \n(43.4% in the valley regions and 29.4% in the hill areas) poor, and 9.5% (9.6% in the valley \nregions and 9.3% in the hill areas) better off.28 It also found that (i) less connected villages have \nmuch higher poverty incidences; and (ii) the closer one gets to the market, the lower the poverty \nincidence; and the higher the size of the relative middle class, the higher the size of the better \noff. \n37.  The project will have a positive impact on reducing poverty. A high proportion of project \nbenefits will accrue directly to households. Allowing for annual inflation from 2009 to 2011, the \ncurrent equivalent amounts are about Tk60,000 and Tk70,000 per household per year for the \nlower and upper poverty line groups. In this case, an annual increase of Tk10,000 in household \nincome arising from project interventions represents an increase of 14%\u201317% for households at \nthe poverty line and could lift many households above the poverty line. \n38.  Gender and development. Implementation of a gender action plan will help ensure that \nwomen  participate  in  and  benefit  from  rural  infrastructure. 29  Women\u2019s  involvement  in \ninfrastructure planning and implementation will enable them to participate in decision making \nand better empower them to express their needs. New jobs will be created for women in \nconstruction and maintenance through LCSs, and elements of the core labor standards will be \nenforced to benefit them. Allocation of 50% of market space for women and 30% representation \nin agriculture common interest groups will encourage greater engagement in economic activity. \nWomen will take the lead role in planning of village water supply, particularly hand pump \nlocations, and will be responsible for collection of user fees. They will have skills enhanced in \nbasic maintenance for which they will receive organizational and technical training. \nD.  Safeguards \n39.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized A for indigenous peoples. The area is \nhome to 41% of Bangladesh\u2019s total indigenous peoples population. The indigenous peoples \nplan  details  principles  and  methodology  to  design  and  implement  the  project  to  ensure \nindigenous peoples (i) receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits, (ii) do not \nsuffer adverse impacts as a result of projects, and (iii) can participate actively in projects that \n                                                 \n27 UNDP. 2009. Socio-Economic Baseline Survey of Chittagong Hill Tracts. Dhaka. \n28 In the ADB study, \u201cvery poor\u201d is defined as having not enough income to meet basic food requirements, \u201cpoor\u201d as \nhaving enough to meet basic needs but no surplus/savings, and \u201cbetter off\u201d as those families that can generate \nsavings. \n29 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \naffect them.30 There are four key elements: (i) where there are resettlement impacts, payment \nwill be made (under the loan) for indigenous peoples common lands to usufruct and legal \nowners of land; (ii) participatory village mapping to ensure inclusion in infrastructure planning \nand development, and a grievance redress mechanism; (iii) assistance to minor indigenous \npeoples groups that are more vulnerable to disproportionate benefit capture; and (iv) awareness \nraising of government officers in indigenous peoples issues and resources of CHT. \n40.  Resettlement. The project is categorized A for resettlement. Lessons learned from the \nCHTRDP indicate that lack of transparent guidelines for project land acquisition appears to have \nresulted  in  poverty-inducing  impacts.  Much  of  the  land  in  CHT  is  under  customary  land \nownership. In terms of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), this is equivalent, in terms of \neligibility for compensation, to titled land ownership. There may also be titled land to be acquired \nunder  the project.  Therefore,  the project  LARF  outlines an  approach  to  the  valuation  and \ncompensation of land that is a blend of statutory and customary laws, for valuation, verification, \nand settling disputes. The LARF also details a robust system for monitoring the resettlement \nand land acquisition process,31 including provision for verification of monitoring by an external \nexpert.  The  PIC  safeguard  specialist,  SQMC,  and  implementing  NGO  will  provide  further \nsupport to ensure a rigorous process is followed for resettlement planning and implementation, \nparticularly payment of compensation.  \n41.  Environment.  The  project  is  categorized  B  for  environment.  An  environmental \nassessment and review framework and an initial environmental examination for six sample \nsubprojects have been prepared.32  Since the project will improve the existing rural road network \nand  community  infrastructure  and  new  roads  are  not  planned,  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are expected. Likely impacts from construction activities are (i) silting of \ncanals  and  drainage  structures,  (ii)  reduction  in  water  flows,  (iii)  soil  erosion,  and                     \n(iv) deterioration of water quality. An environmental management plan has been prepared and \nwill be adhered to in construction contracts. Those likely impacts can be mitigated through the \nimplementation  of  the  environment  management  plan.  CHTRC  institutional  capacity  for \nimplementation of environmental safeguards is assessed as weak, therefore the necessary \nsupport  is  provided  both  project-wise  (component  A)  and  through  provision  of  relevant \nspecialists in the PMO and SQMC. The LGED has sufficient experience in preparing initial \nenvironmental examinations for road subprojects. For all subprojects, formal and documented \npublic  consultation  and  information  disclosure  will  be  required  in  compliance  with  ADB \ninformation disclosure and consultation requirements. \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n42.  Despite a challenging policy framework and political environment, the CHTRDP was \nrated successful. The main assumption for the second CHTRDP is that the 1997 CHT accord \nand the enabling legislation remain effective.33 To ensure continuity in project implementation, \nthe PMO and DPMOs will be established so that they will continue to function regardless of the \nexisting legal challenge to the CHTRC Act, 1998. Although progress remains to be made in the \nimplementation of the CHT accord, particularly with regard to securing land titles and in the \ntransfer of subjects as stated in the HDC Act of 1999, this is not expected to be an impediment \nto project implementation and realization of benefits. Progress has also been made in policy \ndialogue on amendment of the CHT Land Disputes Resolution Commission Act, 2001, which \n                                                 \n30 Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework, Section VI: Monitoring and Evaluation (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). There is an estimated 1,141 affected persons. \n32 Initial  Environmental  Examination  for  Six  Sample  Subprojects,  and  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Although the High Court of Bangladesh in 2009 declared the CHTRC Act illegal, the writ petition is under review in \nthe Appellate Division. \n ", "10 \nwould  safeguard  beneficiary  communities  in  receiving  long-term  benefits  of  project \ninterventions. The government will submit a road map for the amendment of the Land Disputes \nResolution Commission Act, 2001. Other major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \nin Table 4 and detailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nResettlement   Rigorous  advance  consultation  and  review  of  lessons  learned  under  CHTRDP. \nComprehensive process for resettlement planning and implementation identified in LARF. \nEstablishment of SQMC for monitoring resettlement implementation, grievance redress \nmechanism for recording complaints, PIC safeguards specialist for additional support. \nAdvance preparation of resettlement plans for rural roads, one in each district.

ASSURANCES  \n43.  The government and MOCHTA have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and MOCHTA have agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. Agreements have \nalso been reached with MOCHTA, CHTRC, HDC, and LGED on implementation arrangements \nwhich are set forth in the project agreement. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n44.
