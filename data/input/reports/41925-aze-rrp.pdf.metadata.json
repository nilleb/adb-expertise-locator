Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  expanded  by  a \nrecord  34.5%  in  real  terms  during  2006,  which  was  the  world\u2019s  highest  growth  rate  for  the \nsecond  year  running.  By  far  the  greatest  driver  of  growth  has  been  the  industrial  sector, \nspecifically the oil and gas sector, which increased by 56% in 2006 (for a cumulative growth rate \nof  150%  in  2005\u20132006).  The  non-oil  economy  has  also  expanded,  rising  by  12%  in  2006; \nhowever, its contribution to GDP has fallen in the last few years as the oil sector has grown. The \nnon-oil  sector  was  47%  of  nominal  GDP  in  2006,  down  from  58%  in  2005  and  61%  in  2004. \nRising  oil  prices  and  export  volumes  have  contributed  to  a  significant  strengthening  of \nAzerbaijan's external position.1  \n \n3. \nThe  medium-term  outlook  for  the  Azerbaijan  economy  is  positive.  GDP  is  expected  to \npost  double-digit  growth  for  the  next  few  years,  in  line  with  increases  in  oil  and  gas  exports. \nHowever,  foreign  investment  is  projected  to  decrease  as  the  major  oil  and  gas  projects  move \ntowards less intensive stages. It is expected that domestic public investment will partially offset \nthe decline in foreign investment. Government expenditures rose by over 80% in 2006 and are \nprojected to rise by a further 50% in 2007. Partly due to the increase in government spending \nand partly the continued strong foreign exchange inflows associated with the oil and gas sector \nand robust private consumption, there will be increasing inflationary pressure. Annual inflation is \nexpected to rise from 11.4% in 2006 to over 15% in 2007.2 \n \n4. \nIn February 2007, Fitch Ratings upgraded the Republic of Azerbaijan's foreign and local \ncurrency  issuer  default  ratings  to  BB+  from  BB.  Fitch  Ratings  noted  that  the  country\u2019s  outlook \nremained stable. Fitch Ratings\u2019 upgrade of Azerbaijan's sovereign ratings is driven by (i) strong \nand  sustainable  economic  growth,  (ii)  low  government  and  external  debt  ratios,  and  (iii)  a \ngrowing  current  account  surplus  underpinned  by  rapidly  increasing  oil  and  gas  production.  In \naddition, in September 2006, Moody's Investors Service assigned a foreign and local currency \nissuer rating of Ba1 to Azerbaijan. \n \nB. \n\nFuture Challenges  \n\n5. \nIn the long term, given potential volatility in the international oil market, Azerbaijan\u2019s high \ndependence  on  oil  exports  poses  a  potential  threat  to  the  economy.  The  main  challenge  is  to \n                                                 \n1  In 2006, Azerbaijan had a current account surplus of $3.7 billion, equivalent to 18.7% of GDP and a sharp reversal \n\nfrom the current account deficit of 30% of GDP recorded in 2004. \n\n2  As  a  result  of  the  substantial  increase  in  public  spending  and  high  demand  growth,  the  inflation  rate  for  the  first \n\nquarter of 2007 was 16.6%. \n\n\f 2 \n\ndevelop  the  non-oil  sector  to  ensure  the  economy  continues  to  grow  sustainably  after  the  oil \nboom,  meeting  both  short-term  expectations  and  longer-term  demands.  A  key  objective  is  to \ndevelop  income-generating  and  new  employment  opportunities  in  the  non-oil  sector  in  such \npriority areas as banking and finance, trade, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  \n \nC. \n\nBanking Sector in Azerbaijan  \n\n1. \n\nOverview  \n\n6. \nThe Azerbaijani banking system has shown significant improvement in key performance \nindicators since 2000, mainly due to strong growth in the economy and financial sector reform. It \nis, however, still considered one of the weakest among the sovereigns rated by Fitch Ratings.3 \nThe financial system remains small and highly  concentrated. As of the beginning of 2007, the \nAzerbaijani  banking  system  consisted  of  44  commercial  banks  operating  under  license  of  the \nNational Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA), with total statutory capital of $693 million4 (Figure 1). \n \nThe Azerbaijani banking sector is almost fully privatized. The last remaining 100% state-\n7. \nowned bank (Kapital Bank) is expected to be privatized in the near future. The private banks are \nstill relatively small, with total assets of $30 million\u2013$80 million and equity of around $10 million \nfor a typical top-tier private bank. The leading private banks are generally owned by individuals \nor  private  business  groups,  and  state-owned  enterprises  hold  only  small  stakes  (if  any).  In \nrecent years, a top tier of approximately 10 private banks has emerged, and these account for \nhalf of the total bank capital in the country. The remaining banks are smaller, with low levels of \ntotal  assets.  It  is  expected  that  there  will  be  consolidation  within  the  banking  sector  in  the \nmedium  term,  especially  since  the  NBA  is  increasing  the  minimum  required  capital.  Major \ninternational banks do not have substantial operations in Azerbaijan mainly due to the small size \nof the domestic market and certain legal restrictions.  \n \nWhile the authorities continue to improve prudential regulations, significant vulnerabilities \n8. \nin the banking system remain. In response to rising credit and foreign exchange risks, the NBA \nhas  tightened  the  prudential  rules  pertaining  to  loan  collateral  and  open  positions  in  foreign \ncurrencies, and has also increased the minimum capital requirement. \n \nThe  Heritage  Foundation  Banking  Index5 rating  of  3.5  (on  a  scale  of  1  to  5)  shows  a \n9. \nrelatively  restrictive  environment  for  banks,  which  is  reflected  in  the  absence  of  any  major \ninternational  bank  operating  in  the  country.  However,  this  result  is  similar  to  the  average \nbanking index score of 3.73 for ADF borrowing countries. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  Fitch Ratings. 2007.

This consisted \nof  94  nonbanking  organizations  (77  credit  unions  and  17  microfinance  institutions  funded  mainly  by  international \naid organizations) and 44 commercial banks. \n\n5 Heritage Foundation. 2006.

The provision of financial services to households and the \nprivate sector is very limited (only an estimated 10% of the total population has bank accounts), \nreflecting low confidence in the banking sector. Financial services have mainly been provided to \nthe  oil,  construction,  and  trade  sectors,  leaving  the  retail  and  SME  sectors  notably \nunderserviced. \n \n11. \nThe  banking  system\u2019s  assets  (the  main  pillar  of  the  Azerbaijan  financial  system) \nrepresented  only  21%  of  GDP  in  2006,  significantly  below  the  ratios  for  Russia  (53%)  and \nKazakhstan (91%). As of the end of 2006, the total volume of assets grew by almost 60% and \namounted  to  $4,344  million.  The  most  significant  element  in  the  structure  of  bank  assets  are \nloans  issued  to  customers,  which  total  $2,537  million  (58.4%  of  total  assets).  Half  of  the  total \nbanking  assets  in  the  country  are  held  by  the  state-owned  International  Bank  of  Azerbaijan \n(Figure 2).  \n \n\nFigure 2: Share of Banks\u2019 Assets \n(as of 1 January 2007) \n\n22%\n\n2%\n\n2%\n2%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n4%\n\n4%\n\n52%\n\nIBA\n\nBank Standard\n\nKapital\n\nUnibank\n\nTexnikabank\n\nAzerigazbank\n\nRespublika\n\nBank of Baku\n\nKochbank\n\nAzerdemiryolbank\n\nOther\n\nIBA = International Bank of Azerbaijan. \nSource: International Bank of Azerbaijan, JP Morgan. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nOn the liability side, the most significant element comprises deposits issued to corporate \n12. \nand individual customers, which total $2,253 million (64.23% of total liabilities). Banking sector \ndeposits have grown rapidly but remain low, and are not commensurate with Azerbaijan\u2019s level \nof  development.  According  to  NBA,  deposits  rose  by  50%  in  2006  to  AZN2.0  billion,  an \nestimated 11% of GDP.  \n \n13. \nThe  use  of  dollars  in  the  economy  remains  high,  with  the  share  of  savings  in  foreign \ncurrency  as  at  the  end  of  2006  being  more  than  50%,  and  the  volume  of  lending  in  foreign \ncurrency  being  53%.  The  share  of  deposits  held  in  Azerbaijan  new  manats  has,  however, \nincreased notably during 2006, at least in part because of the appreciation of the local currency \nagainst  the  dollar.  By  November  2006,  37%  of  total  deposits  were  held  in  Azerbaijan  new \nmanats, up from just 20% at the end of 2005. \n \n14. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  commercial  banks  have  used  the  rapidly  growing  deposit  base  to  expand \ntheir  loan  portfolios\u2014an  important  and  positive  development  given  the  marginal  financial \nintermediation role that they have played in the economy up until now. As of December 2006, \nconsolidated  lending  by  banks  was  AZN2.36  billion,  up  64%  from  the  previous  year.  By  April \n2007,  this  figure  reached  AZN2.87  billion.  Despite  the  large  increase  in  the  deposit  base,  this \nfigure is still too small to meet the growing demand for financial services, especially from SMEs.  \n \nThe  private  and  state-owned  commercial  banks  each  provide  about  48%  of  total  loans \n15. \noutstanding, with the remainder coming from nonbank institutions. However, most private banks \nfocus exclusively on lending to the private sector\u2014primarily individual entrepreneurs and SMEs. \nBy  virtue  of  their  small  size  and  customer  focus,  the  private  banks  provide  mainly  small  and \nmicro loans and typically do not serve the oil and gas sector. \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure 3: Share of Banks\u2019 Loans \n(as of 1 January 2007) \n\n25%\n\n2%\n2%\n2%\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n3%\n\n4%\n\nIBA\n\nTexnikabank\n\nUnibank\n\nKapital\n\nBank Standard\n\n50%\n\nAzerigazbank\n\nRespublika\n\nBank of Baku\n\nAzerdemiryolbank\n\nTurnabank\n\nOther\n\n \n\nIBA = International Bank of Azerbaijan. \nSource: International Bank of Azerbaijan, JP Morgan. \n\n \n \n16. \nThe share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) and the level of capital at risk are moderate. \nAccording  to  national  statistics,  the  share  of  NPLs  in  2006  was  considerably  low  at  3.33%, \ncompared to 4.73% in the previous year. However, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nDevelopment\u2019s  (EBRD)  Transition  Report  2006 6 noted  that  the  level  of  NPLs  in  the  entire \nbanking system should have been 14.9% in 2005, 0.4% higher than 2004. Of particular concern \nin the banking system is the ratio and quality of capitalization, particularly as credit continues to \ngrow rapidly. In response to this, the authorities have worked to improve the supervision of the \nbanking system. Minimum capital requirements will be raised from the current level of AZN8.2 \nmillion  to  AZN10.0  million  by  July  2008,  and  this  is  expected  to  translate  into  further \nconsolidation  and  mergers,  resulting  in  fewer  and  better-capitalized  banks.  This  is  a  positive \nstep towards strengthening the financial system in Azerbaijan. Currently, only 10 of Azerbaijan\u2019s \n44 banks have capital of AZN10.0 million or more.   \n \n17. \nThe  financial  condition  of  Azerbaijani  banks  remains  stable  while  displaying  positive \ndynamics. Based on the results of 2006, the average return on equity of Azerbaijani banks was \napproximately  30%,  and  the  return  on  assets  was  2%.  As  oil  prices  remain  high  and  new \ninvestment comes to Azerbaijan, interest rates are set to decrease. As interest rates decrease \nand  the  economy  grows,  the  banking  sector  is  almost  certainly  set  for  further  expansion. \nMoreover, as the domestic economy is growing at an annual rate of 10% in real terms, there will \nbe  more  investment  opportunities  in  areas  like  hotels  and  tourism,  retail,  catering,  and  real \nestate.  Construction  related  to  the  oil  industry  also  stimulates  some  sectors,  such  as \ntransportation,  engineering,  and  the  steel  industry.  In  fact,  even  without  any  structural \nimprovement,  the  banking  sector  may  show  quite  good  growth  (comparable  to  GDP  growth). \nStructural improvement may give a much more significant boost to the banking sector, and the \npace  of  growth  will  be  determined  by  the  success  of  structural  reforms.  Appendix  1  gives  an \noverview of the development of the Azerbaijani banking sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutlook \n\n18. \nDespite  substantial  support  to  banks  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  most \nprivate  banks  are  expected  to  remain  illiquid  and  undercapitalized  in  the  medium  term.  State-\nowned  banks  will  continue  to  dominate  the  sector,  which,  together  with  continued  strong \neconomic growth, will ensure that the risk of a banking crisis is low. Structural changes in the \nbanking  sector  will  foster  further  consolidation  and  greater  foreign  participation.  The  new \nbanking  system  and  central  bank  laws  have  significantly  strengthened  the  banking  sector \nlegislation. The authorities are confident that this will provide the basis for improving the quality \nof  the  financial  sector  in  Azerbaijan,  especially  with  the  strengthening  of  the  supervisory \nframework. Furthermore, the Government is developing banking infrastructure to make it better \nsuited  to  channeling  savings  into  the  economy.  The  Government  and  NBA  have  issued \nprudential  regulations  conforming  to  best  international  practices,  including  risk-based  capital, \nloan loss provisioning, and asset classification regulations. For more details refer to Appendix 2. \n \nD. \n\n \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Azerbaijan \n\n1. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n19. \nBetween  1995  and  2006  the  privatization  of  state-owned  property  and  the  creation  of \nnew businesses greatly contributed to the development of the private sector in Azerbaijan. As of \n1 January  2007,  the  number  of  registered  legal  entities  was  74,354,  80.6%  of  which  were \nprivate  enterprises.  As  of  March  2007,  there  are  4,161  foreign  legal  entities  registered  in \nAzerbaijan. \n \n\n                                                 \n6 EBRD. 2006. Transitions Report 2006. London. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nIn  2006,  the  share  of  the  private  sector  in  GDP  was  about  81%.  Private  firms  are  the \n20. \nmajor  source  of  employment  and  Government  revenue.  Presently,  the  share  of  the \nnongovernment  sector  in  the  manufacturing  and  service  areas  such  as  agriculture,  industry, \ntrade, hotels, catering services, civic construction, transport, and communication is in the range \nof 70\u201395%. \n \n\n2. \n\nConstitution of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n\nThe  development  of  SMEs  is  crucial  to  the  development  of  the  non-oil  sector  in \n21. \nAzerbaijan.  As  a  result  of  structural  reforms  and  improvements  in  legislation  and  taxation,  the \nnumber of entrepreneurs has increased considerably in the past 10 years. In 2006, there were \n243,473 people registered as individual entrepreneurs. They are involved in fields such as trade \n(49.4%),  transport,  storage,  and  telecommunications  (17.9%),  agriculture  (9.5%),  public  and \nsocial  services  (8.2%)  and  real  estate  operations  (5.9%).  SMEs  currently  account  for \napproximately 80% of registered private businesses operating in Azerbaijan, and over the past 5 \nyears have, on average, represented an estimated 10% of GDP. SMEs are the largest source of \ndomestic  employment  outside  of  the  public  sector,  providing  a  livelihood  for  over  75%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  workforce.  An  estimated  70%  of  SMEs  are  located  in  Baku  and  the  Absheron \nPeninsula, and have limited capacity for regional expansion.   \n \nThe importance of SMEs in relation to general economic vitality is widely acknowledged. \n22. \nStudies have shown that in most countries the SME and the informal sector account for about \n45\u201375%  of  employment  and  65\u201370%  of  GDP,  regardless  of  the  development  stage  of  the \neconomy.7 This is especially true for Azerbaijan, as explained in the preceding paragraph.   \n \n23. \nFurther  efforts  are  therefore  needed  to  develop  the  SME  sector.  One  of  the  biggest \nproblems  facing  SMEs  in  Azerbaijan  today  is  the  lack  of  access  to  finance.  This  problem  has \nbeen identified and recognized by both the Government and the donor community. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Efforts \n\n24. \nThe  Government  continues  to  support  SME  growth  and  improve  the  business \nenvironment. In the past 2 years, state policy has shifted from providing direct aid to SMEs to \nimproving the regulatory and business infrastructure in order to facilitate the development of the \nprivate sector. In consultation with the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business team, the Government has \nidentified a list of urgent measures and actions necessary to simplify business regulations in the \ncountry.  \n \n25. \nIn  2005,  the  Government  completed  the  2-year  state  program  for  SME  development. \nThe major objectives of the program were (i) the creation and development of legal and physical \ninfrastructures for efficient operation of SMEs, (ii) the expansion of foreign economic activity of \nSMEs and export promotion, and (iii) the expansion of opportunities for financial and investment \nassistance for SMEs.  \n \nTo  help  alleviate  the  problem  of  lack  of  financing  faced  by  SMEs,  the  Government \n26. \nestablished  a  special  state  budget  fund  for  SME  development,  supervised  by  the  Ministry  of \nEconomic  Development.  The  fund  is  expected  to  disburse  a  total  of  $94  million  in  2007  for \nvarious SME projects via 25 private bank agents, one nonbank institution and five credit unions. \n                                                 \n7 Corporation for Enterprise Development. 2004. SMEs and Poverty Reduction. New York. The report, commissioned \nby the Ford Foundation's Affinity Group  on  Development  Finance (SME  committee), reviews current literature on \nthe SME sector and its links to poverty reduction strategies in the United States and internationally. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nWhile the loan size varies from $50,000 to $1 million, the annual interest rate is limited to 7% \n(market  rates  are  in  the  15\u201320%  range).  However,  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development \nrecognizes  that  the  fund  should  not  be  a  continuing  source  of  subsidized  financing  for  SMEs \nand  that  private  banks  have  to  actively  become  involved.  The  private  banks  are  asked  to \nactively  look  for  external  funding  sources  in  order  to  reduce  the  market  lending  rates.  Before \nyear-end 2007, the Ministry of Economic Development is expected to revise the charter of the \nbudget fund in accordance with a new draft of the second state program on SME development \nto be approved in early 2008. Further, in May 2007, the president issued a special decree aimed \nat  accelerating  SME  development  in  Azerbaijan.  According  to  the  decree,  development  of \nentrepreneurship  requires  new  measures  to  reduce  impediments,  such  as  changing  the  time-\nconsuming  registration  procedures  and  licensing.  The  cabinet  of  ministers  and  other  line \nagencies have been authorized to prepare and submit to the president their suggestions for (i) \nthe  elimination  of  abuses,  (ii)  the  acceleration  of  entrepreneurial  development,  and  (iii)  the \ncreation of an advantageous business environment.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE BORROWER \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\n27. \nBank Respublika, headquartered in Baku, was established as a joint-stock company in \n1992  by  a  group  of  entrepreneurs  led  by  Natig  Gouliyev.  The  bank  operates  under  a  general \nbanking license, although the scope of its activities has been upgraded in two instances: (i) in \n1994 the bank received approval to commence foreign exchange operations; and (ii) in 1999 the \nbank  was  authorized  to  issue  credit  cards.  Throughout  the  early  and  mid-1990s,  Bank \nRespublika\u2019s  principal  focus  was  on  corporate  banking,  providing  services  to  businesses, \nseveral  of  which  were  related  parties.  Following  the  turmoil  of  the  Russian  financial  crisis  in \n1998, however, Bank Respublika has repositioned itself as a universal bank expanding into the \nretail market, specifically targeting the consumer banking needs of the middle class, in addition \nto servicing the corporate needs of the SME sector.  \n \n28. \nUnder  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  as  of  the  end  of  2006  Bank \nRespublika reported total assets of AZN111.3 million and shareholder equity of AZN11.9 million. \nThe bank has increased its market share in the Azerbaijan banking system from 2.5% in 2005 to \n2.95% at the end of 2006 (3.2% as of 1 May 2007). It ranks 5th among the private sector banks \nin  the  country  in  terms  of  assets  and  is  among  the  top  10  banks  by  deposits  and  loans \n(Appendix 3 gives a detailed peer analysis).  \n \n29. \nAs  a  means  of  strengthening  its  position  in  the  market,  Bank  Respublika  has  forged \nrelationships  with  several  international  financial  institutions.  In  January  2002,  the  bank  began \nparticipating in the German-Azerbaijan Fund, with a \u20ac2 million credit line for SMEs. In addition, \nthe  Retail  Banking \nBank  Respublika \nDevelopment  Project  in  mid-2002  from  the  Savings  Banks  Foundation  for  International \nCooperation. In 2004, Bank Respublika became involved in the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \n(KfW)-funded Corporate Standards Implementation project. Bank Respublika\u2019s relationship with \nKfW  deepened  with  the  sale  of  a  16.67%  equity  interest  to  Deutsche  Investitions-  und \nEntwicklungsgesellshaft  mbH  (DEG,  a  member  of  the  KfW  banking  group)  and  of  8.33%  to \nSparkassen International Development Trust in early 2005. \n \nBank  Respublika  received  its  initial  credit  rating  from  Moody\u2019s  Investors  Services  in \n30. \nDecember  2006.  The  assessed  rating  was  B2  (foreign  currency  deposit  rating)  with  a  positive \noutlook  (upgraded  in  June  2007),  and  this  was  the  highest  rating  among  the  private  sector \n\ntechnical  assistance  under \n\nreceived  extended \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nbanks  in  Azerbaijan.  Moody\u2019s  indicated  that  its  rating  reflected  Bank  Respublika\u2019s  (i) \nstrengthening  franchise  in  the  country\u2019s  banking  market  and  its  ability  to  increase  its  market \nshare  while  maintaining  rigid  credit  underwriting  procedures,  supported  by  a  dedicated \nmanagement  team;  (ii)  access  to  wholesale  funding  from  foreign  banks;  (iii) strategic \nrepositioning to focus on retail and SME banking activities; (iv) relatively good loan granularity or \ndiversification;  and  (v)  equity  partnership  with  two  German  public  sector  financial  institutions \nwhich has a positive influence on corporate governance, systems, and controls. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Strategy: Retail and Small and Medium-Enterprise Focus \n\n31. \nFor  several  years  after  its  founding,  Bank  Respublika  focused  on  corporate  banking. \nHowever, in the late 1990s, after surviving the turmoil of the Russian financial crisis, the bank \nbegan  shifting  its  strategy.  To  better  position  itself,  Bank  Respublika  sought  transition  into  a \nuniversal  bank,  offering  retail  banking  services  and  expanding  its  corporate  banking  activities, \nspecifically  its  SME  portfolio.  As  part  of  this  transition  process,  the  bank  has  expanded  its \ndistribution  network  to  12  branches  and  seven  service  points  throughout  the  country  (five \nadditional branches are to be opened in the second half of 2007) and broadened the types of \nproducts that it offers to service consumer needs.  \n \n32. \nBank Respublika currently offers eight different types of loans. Retail banking products \ninclude car, new family, useful trip, education, and mortgage loans. SME and corporate banking \nproducts  are  categorized  by  size  as  follows:  (i)  micro  loans  from  AZN300  to  AZN10,000,  (ii) \nSME loans from AZN10,000 to AZN500,000, and (iii) macro loans over AZN500,000. Appendix \n6 gives an overview over the various loan products. \n \n33. \nGoing  forward,  Bank  Respublika  seeks  to  build  on  its  presence  in  the  Azerbaijan \nbanking sector and gain market share in retail and SME banking. In addition to conducting an \naggressive  marketing  campaign  to  strengthen  brand-name  recognition  and  attract  new \ndepositors  and  borrowers,  the  bank  also  seeks  to  improve  customer  service  to  develop \ncustomer loyalty, as well as offer other loan products tailored to customer needs.  \n \n34. \nBank  Respublika\u2019s  focus  on  SME  and  retail  lending  offers  good  opportunities  for \nsustainable  growth,  as  both  sectors  are  currently  underdeveloped  in  Azerbaijan.  Further,  this \nbusiness focus avoids excessive concentrations, to which many of the other small banks in the \ncountry are prone. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nOverview \n\nADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance  to  Bank  Respublika  will  be  in  the  form  of  a  US  dollar \n35. \ndenominated  subordinated  loan  of  up  to  $10  million  in  order  to  strengthen  the  bank\u2019s  capital \nposition  and  underpin  the  expansion  of  its  lending  activities,  particularly  to  SMEs.  The \nsubordinated loan will be structured in a way to qualify as Tier II capital. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\nA. \n\nJustification for the ADB Investment \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\n36. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe proposed ADB assistance will promote development in the following key areas. \n\nIncrease  access  to  finance  for  SMEs.  SMEs  play  a  significant  role  in  the \neconomies of all ADB developing member countries (DMCs) and are key drivers \nof  employment,  economic  growth,  and  development.  They  often  have  a \nsignificant  impact  on  GDP,  and  in  most  cases  grow  faster  than  state-owned \nenterprises. The development of SMEs is therefore an important driver of growth \nand  a  key  contributor  to  poverty  reduction  by  (a)  creating  employment,  (b) \nincreasing individual incomes, and (c) generating tax revenues. \n\nSMEs  rely  heavily  on  access  to  external  capital  to  finance  their  operations. \nHowever, in most ADB DMCs, SMEs have difficulty accessing financial services \nand securing financing. Although bank loans dominate external financing (due to \nthe  underdeveloped  corporate  bond  markets),  only  a  small  number  of  SMEs  in \nthe region have access to bank lending (mostly only for working capital). In most \nDMCs  the  lack  of  access  to  bank  lending  is  considered  the  main  financing \ndifficulty  and  hindrance  to  sustaining  growth  of  SMEs.8 This  is  no  different  in \nAzerbaijan, as discussed in Section II. SME development is key to the country\u2019s \nfuture development and economic diversification.  \n \nThe  proposed  assistance  will  allow  Bank  Respublika  to  provide  increased \nfinancial intermediation in line with its strategic plan. The increased availability of \ncapital or funding will help clients promote their operations, increase profitability, \nand  enhance \nto  private  sector \ndevelopment and sustainable economic growth in Azerbaijan.   \n\ntheir  competitiveness, \n\nthus  contributing \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nin  the  non-oil  sector.  Azerbaijan\u2019s  economy  is \nPromote  development \ndominated  by  the  oil  sector  and  is  expected  to  remain  so  for  the  foreseeable \nfuture. In the absence of further oil discoveries, the country\u2019s oil wealth is set to \npeak  relatively  early.  As  such,  diversification  of  the  economic  base  will  become \nan increasingly important means of sustaining growth and reducing the country\u2019s \nvulnerability to a sustained fall in oil prices. The proposed transaction, which will \nindirectly lead to increased lending to SMEs that are presently underserviced, will \nsupport  the  creation  of  employment  and  livelihood  opportunities  for  a  broader \nportion of the population outside the oil and gas sector.   \n \nSupport  the  emerging  private  banking  sector. The proposed intervention will \nhelp  strengthen  the  banking  sector  at  a  critical  point  in  its  development  and \nenhance confidence in the county\u2019s banking system. The private banking sector \nis small and underdeveloped and not fully able to mobilize available liquidity and \nchannel  it  towards  SME  investment  through  extension  of  credit.  Support  for  the \ngrowth of a promising and well-managed private bank will contribute to the shift \n\n                                                 \n8 Appendix 14 discusses the development impact of SME finance and Appendix 15 discuss the SME financing gap in \n\nAsia. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n \nB. \n\naway from the state-owned banks\u2019 dominance of the sector. As private banks are \na  key  source  of  small  and  micro  loans  for  the  private  sector  (particularly \nindividual entrepreneurs and SMEs), they are critical to the economy.    \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n37. \nThe proposed loan from ADB  will allow Bank Respublika to strengthen its capital base \nand this will in turn enhance the bank\u2019s ability to expand its lending activities, providing greater \nfinancing intermediation in Azerbaijan, especially to SMEs.   \n \n38. \nIn  addition,  ADB  will  strengthen  its  relationship  with  Bank  Respublika,  and  in  doing  so \nencourage and support the adoption of better practices (through covenants) for critical banking \nfunctions (such as credit, asset-liability management, anti-money laundering, anticorruption, and \nenvironmental safeguard policies and procedures).  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Safeguard Policies  \n\n39. \nThe proposed loan will be classified as category FI (financial intermediary) under ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of ADB\u2019s existing senior loan \nto  Bank  Respublika,  the  bank  has  issued  an  environmental  and  social  policy  in  2007  and \ndeveloped  and  implemented  detailed  environmental  management  procedures  which  are \nacceptable  to  ADB  (a  short  summary  appears  in  Appendix  17).  ADB  will  be  furnished  with  an \nannual  environmental  and  social  report,  which  will  document  the  compliance  with  ADB's \nsafeguard  policies.  Bank  Respublika  has  the  capacity  to  run  the  procedures  put  in  place.  The \nproposed loan will be classified category C under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nand Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), as no involuntary resettlements or adverse impacts \non indigenous peoples are foreseen in relation to any activities of Bank Respublika.  \n \nD. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  \n\n40. \nBank Respublika has been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  and  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  Financing  of  Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  will  require  Bank  Respublika,  through  covenants  in  the  loan  documentation,  to  institute, \nmaintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best-practice \nstandards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the \nfinancing  of  terrorism,  and  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities. \nBank  Respublika  has  adequate  anti-money \nterrorism \nprocedures in place. \n \n\nlaundering  and  anti-financing  of \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n41. \nADB will enter into an acceptable loan agreement and other required legal documents, \nfollowing approval of the proposed loan by the Board. These agreements will be on terms and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n42. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be asked to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed ADB loan to Bank \nRespublika.  No  funding  under  the  loan  will  be  made  available  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation. \n\n\f11\n\nVII.

Measures  were \n\nA. \n \nInstitutional and legal establishment of the banking system of the Republic of Azerbaijan \n1. \nbegan after independence in 1991. The basic objectives of the development stage of the bank \nsystem  were  to  establish  the  institutions  and  infrastructure  and  provide  for  the  normal \nfunctioning of the banking system. \n \n2. \nAdoption of the Law on the National Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic (NBA) and the Law \non Banks and Banking Activity in the Azerbaijan Republic laid foundation for the legal-normative \nbasis of the banking system. The initial stage of the banking system was accompanied by liberal \nconditions  of  entry  into  the  banking  market.  With  the  objectives  of  stimulating  the  process  of \ninstitutional establishment of the bank system, the NBA made minimal capital requirements and \nused  relatively  soft  control  mechanisms.  As  a  result  of  those  processes,  233  banks  and  370 \nbank branches were registered and operated during 1993-1994 in Azerbaijan. \n \n3. \nThe  evolution  stage  of  the  banking  system,  which  began  in  1996,  established  new \npriorities  by  taking  into  account  completion  of  the  institutional  establishment  of  the  banking \nsystem. Administrative means, which were used by the NBA for regulation of bank sector, were \ninternational \ngradually \nstandardization of the normative legal basis, which regulated banking activity and the economic \nnormative requirements were continuously tightened.  \n \nAs a result of the strengthening of the banking system, protection of depositors\u2019 interests, \n4. \npromotion  of  sound  competition,  quantitative  parameters  were  transformed  to  qualitative \nparameters.  Special  attention  was  paid  to  financial  indicators  of  banks,  i.e.,  capital,  liquidity, \nprofitability,  security  of \ntechnological  processes  and \nmanagement-information systems. \n \n5. \nConsolidation  of  the  banking  system,  development  of  banks  and  strengthening  of  their \ncapitalization resulted in an increase of aggregate bank capital by 22 times, total investment by \n3 times, and the amount of attracted savings increased by 8 times. The weight of bank assets in \nGDP has now reached 28%. \n \n6. \nAt  this  stage  of  development  of  the  banking  system,  in  order  to  restructure  the  state \nbanks, the capital of banks was incorporated and the share of the state in the banking system \nas a proprietor was reduced. Twinning Programs with foreign banks were carried out to prepare \nstate banks for privatization and institutional development.  \n \nThe  objective  of  increasing  institutional  variety  on  the  legal  basis  of  non-bank  credit \n7. \norganizations  was  established  in  1998.  The  number  of  such  financial  entities  was  13  in  1998 \nand  reached  82  in  2001.  The  next  stage  of  historical  evolution  of  the  banking  system,  i.e. \nintensive restructuring and recovery of the banking system, started in 2000. Recovery measures \nwere  aimed  at  the  establishment  of  a  banking  system  that  was  adequately  capitalized  with \nsound, sufficient management systems. To establish precise efficiency parameters, audits were \ncarried  out  to  evaluate  financial  condition,  capitalization,  liquidity,  profitability  management \nmechanisms  and  systems,  in-house  procedures  and  other  aspects.  Furthermore,  raising  the \nefficiency of bank services, improvement of management-information systems, and application \nof new bank technologies was supported. These measures fully embraced the private banking \nsector. \n\ntransactions,  use  of  progressive \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1   \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n8. \nRestructuring and recovery of the banking system were carried out in two systems, i.e. \nrestructuring  of  state  banks  and  the  private  banking  system.  In  the  process,  Industrial-\nInvestment  Bank,  Savings  Banks  and  Agrarian-Industrial  Bank  were  merged  and  BUS  Bank \nwas established. In addition, in July 2002, Mbank and Promtekhbank announced their merger to \ncreate Unibank, Azerbaijan\u2019s third largest bank by assets. \n \n9. \nOther  state  bank  structures  were  consolidated  into  the  Agrarian-Industrial  Bank.  The \nAgrarian-Industrial  Bank  was  transformed  into  a  non-bank  credit  organization  acting  under  a \nlimited  license  to  regulate  bad  debts  and,  thereby,  solve  the  problem  of  low  quality  assets \ninherent in post-soviet states. \n \nB.       Role and Regulations of the National Bank of Azerbaijan \n\n10. \nAs early as 7 August 1992, in addition to the Law on Banks and Banking Activity in the \nAzerbaijan Republic, the Law on the National Bank of Azerbaijan was adopted. On 15 August \n1992, the manat, the national currency of the Azerbaijan Republic, was issued. On 1 December \n1992,  the  Milli  Mejis  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic  passed  the  Resolution  on  Approval  of  the \nCharter  of  the  NBA.  The  aforesaid  legislative  acts  established  the  NBA  as  the  supreme  state \nbank, which has exclusive right to issue banknotes and carry out reserve system functions. At \nthe  same  time,  the  NBA  was  granted  regulatory  and  supervisory  authority  over  the  banking \nsystem. The NBA is the central bank of the Azerbaijan Republic. Its status, basic functions and \nduties,  organization  and  principles  of  activity  are  determined  by  the  Constitution  of  the \nAzerbaijan Republic, Law on the National Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic and other legislative \nacts. \n \n11. \nThe  basic  objectives  of  the  NBA  are  to  ensure  manat  stability,  to  take  measures  to \nregulate  its  purchasing  power  and  exchange  rate  versus  foreign  currency,  to  determine \nmonetary and credit policy; to carry out cash emission; to pay off state debts in accordance with \nthe current laws of Azerbaijan; to participate in the preparation of balance of payments forecasts \nand to draw up balanced payment reports of Azerbaijan. \n \nThe  main  functions  of  the  NBA  are  pursuing  state  policy  in  the  sphere  of  monetary, \n12. \ncredit and currency relations; facilitating accomplishment of settlements and stable operation of \nthe payment system; accomplishing transactions in the securities market, as well as purchase \nand sale of foreign currency; taking necessary measures for development and strengthening of \nthe banking system in Azerbaijan; carrying out currency regulation, determining procedures for \nsettlements with foreign countries and managing foreign currency reserves; adopting normative \nacts in the field of banking activity. \n \nThe NBA has in recent years successfully used the exchange rate of the manat to help \n13. \nanchor domestic price levels contributing to low inflation, increasing international reserves and \ngrowing  external  competitiveness,  as  reflected  in  the  rapid  growth  of  non-oil  exports  in  recent \nyears. It also plans to continue to follow carefully the developments in the domestic market. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n     Appendix 2 \n\nBANKING SECTOR OUTLOOK \n\n \n1. \nIt is forecasted that the asset growth trend in Azerbaijan during the next few years will \nexceed  the  pace  of  previous  years.  The  National  Bank  of  Azerbaijan  (NBA)  expects \nimprovements of banking indicators and bank performance. Banks will continue to increase their \ncapital,  further  attract  foreign  investments,  improve  risk  management,  increase  profitability, \nefficiency and asset quality. \n \nThe  process  of  revising  the  legislative  framework  of  the  Azeri  banking  system  will \n2. \ncontinue.  New  legislation  will  foster  banking  sector  development,  strengthen  banks\u2019  corporate \ngovernance  provide  a  new  framework  for  mortgage  lending,  bolster  the  central  bank\u2019s \nsupervisory control, improve the ability to fight money-laundering and the financing of terrorism, \nstrengthen  the  NBA\u2019s  independence  in  the  formulation  and  execution  of  monetary  policy, \nimprove  the  accountability  of  the  NBA  and  enhanced  its  transparency  by  establishing  a  clear \nmechanism for distributing NBA\u2019s profit.  \n \nAdditionally, NBA started redenomination of the manat, from 1 January 2006 the value of \n3. \nthe  manat  has  increased  by  a  factor  of  5,000.  Six  new  banknotes  and  5  types  of  coins  have \nbeen  issued.  According  to  NBA,  the  main  reason  behind  redenomination  is  preventing  further \ndollarization  of  the  economy  since  the  nominal  exchange  rate  is  now  close  to  the  current  US \ndollar  rate.  Furthermore,  the  redenomination  plays  a  vital  role  in  strengthening  the  national \ncurrency  and  simplifying  arithmetical  calculations  during  trade  operations  and  it  will  also  ease \nthe  work  of  banks.  Currently,  the  International  Bank  of  Azerbaijan  (IBA)  stands  as  the  largest \nbank  with  the  largest  number  of  current  accounts  of  physical  customers.  Therefore,  the \nresponsibility of IBA in the process of re-denomination is significant.  \n \n4. \nOn  15  April  2005,  the  Mortgage  Law  was  adopted.  As  of  1  March  2006,  the  first \napplications for mortgage loans were submitted by the authorized banks and a number of them \nhave  already  granted  mortgages  to  individuals.

In  turn,  such  growth  and \nmodernization are associated with general poverty reduction.  SMEs play a crucial role in driving \neconomic  growth  in  both  developing  and  developed  countries.    SMEs  typically  generate  the \nmost new jobs; introduce locally (and sometimes globally) relevant innovative ideas, products, \nand business methods; and can push economic reform and the modernization of uncompetitive \neconomies. \n \n2. \nstrategies: \n \n\nSME  development  is  also  often  seen  as  a  critical  component  of  pro-poor  growth \n\nSMEs generate many of the new jobs in the economy.  Since many of these jobs \nare  suitable  for  semi-skilled  or  unskilled  workers,  they  can  be  taken  up  by  the \npoor. \n\nSMEs introduce business methods, products, and services that help restructure \nweak  agricultural  sector  or  other  uncompetitive  transition  economies,  thereby \nabsorbing labor that would otherwise drop into the ranks of the poor. \n\nSMEs  help  spread  the  benefits  of  economic  growth  by  engaging  low-income \ngroups  in  national  development.    They  form  dynamic  supply-chain  linkages \nbetween small-scale producers and lucrative urban, national, or export markets.  \nIn  the  reverse  direction,  they  link  large  urban  business  with  mass  consumer \nmarkets in remote areas. \n\n3. \n\nThe following are the effects of SMEs on poverty: \n\nRemoval  of  bias  against  labor-intensive  production. The removal of market \ndistortions  that  lead  to  a  bias  against  labor-intensive  production  techniques \nshould have a clearly positive impact in reducing poverty. Moreover, reducing \npoverty may improve the environment for SME expansion, so that these efforts \ncan  be  expected  to  be  mutually  reinforcing.  And  although  the  expansion  of \nSMEs  may  not  be  sufficient  for  poverty  reduction,  the  likely  positive  effects \nthrough  the  families  of  the  SMEs'  employees,  the  better  utilization  of  more \ngeneral aid-donor interventions across firms, and the resulting acceleration of \nhuman and community development, make it plausible to suppose that there is \nan enormous \"bang for the buck\" in fighting poverty through investing in SMEs. \n\nThe effect of employing relatively more low skilled workers. Since it is likely \nthat  both  SMEs  and  their  suppliers,  on  average,  employ  a  greater  share'  of \nlocal,  low  skilled  workers  than  do  large  firms  or  the  suppliers  to  large  firms, \nand  since  to  the  extent  that  SMEs'  hire  less  skilled  workers,  these  workers \nplausibly spend a larger share of their income on other products produced by \nless skilled workers, there is more likely to be a positive multiplier effect on the \nalleviation of poverty through SME support than through development projects \nthat lack this focus. \n\n                                                 \n1 The Development Impact of Small and Medium Enterprises: Lessons Learned from SEAF Investments. Volume 1. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i)  \n\n \n(ii)  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n     Appendix 4 \n\n(iii)  \n\n \n(iv)  \n\n \n(v) \n\nLinkage to small suppliers. It is plausible that SMEs have more supply links \nthan  large  firms  to  the  local  economy,  given  their  small  size  or  lesser \nsophistication,  which  would  generally  inhibit  sourcing  directly  from  abroad. \nSMEs probably import fewer intermediate goods than large firms, suggesting \na  larger  local  multiplier  effect.  It  is  also  a  reasonable  hypothesis  that  SMEs \nbuy a greater percentage of these products from labor-intensive SMEs. This in \nturn  should  lead  to  a  greater  expansion  of  sustainable,  local,  employment \nbenefits. \n\nSecurity  of  employment. When  employees  leave  micro-enterprises  to  accept \nSME  employment,  their  wage  incomes  are  likely  to  rise,  but  also  to  become \nless variable, making it easier to plan for their families' welfare. \n\nImpact on children through employment of mothers. If investment in an SME \nraises the incomes of poor mothers with small children, the impact on poverty \ncan be great. The development microeconomics literature consistently shows \nthat  a  much  larger  fraction  of  an  extra  dollar  earned  by  a  mother  goes  to  the \nwelfare of her children than of an extra dollar earned by the father. This holds \nfor spending on children's health and education, as well as on improvements in \nthe home and other  important  factors.  The  impact  is  especially significant  for \ndaughters. Though no \n\n(vi)   Magnified impact on poverty reduction among very poor people. Targeting \na  small  number  of  very  poor  people  provides  greater  social  benefits  than \ntargeting a larger number of less poor people. Thus, to the degree that SMEs \nhire  relatively  poor  people,  the  impact  of  any  given  income  increase  on \npoverty  would  be  magnified.  Given  the  correlation  between  wage  level  and \nskill level, the tendency of SMEs to hire more unskilled people than do larger \nenterprises suggests that this magnified impact is likely at the SME level. \n\n \n(vii)   SME  tax  payments.  To  the  extent  that  tax  revenues  are  used  to  implement \npoverty  impacting  programs  such  as  local  infrastructure  improvements,  health \nservices,  or.  school  meals,  and  to  the  extent  that  SMEs  contribute  more  tax \nrevenue than do micro-enterprises (who in practice may pay few or no taxes) or \nlarge  firms  (which  can  often  find  loopholes  or  use  their  influence  to  pay  less \nthan statutory tax rates), support to SMEs could be expected to have a greater \nindirect  impact  on  poverty  reduction  than  other  forms  of  developmental \nassistance.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Currency Unit\n", "Azerbaijan new manat (AZN) \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2007) \n", "AZN1.00\n$1.00\n", "$1.0953 \nAZN0.9147 \n", " \n \n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n", " \n", "ADB  \u2013 \nDEG  \u2013 \nDMC  \u2013 \nGDP  \u2013 \nKfW  \u2013 \nNBA  \u2013 \nNPL  \u2013 \nSME  \u2013 \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \nDeutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellshaft mbH \ndeveloping member country \ngross domestic product \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \nNational Bank of Azerbaijan \nnonperforming loan \nsmall and medium-sized enterprise \n", " \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", "NOTE \n \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n \n", " \nL.
