The President would \napprove  the  TA  in  the  event  that  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approves the program cluster and the loans. \n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Public finance and expenditure management \nThemes:  Governance,  private  sector  development, \ndevelopment \nSubthemes:  Public \nreforms, human development \n \nCategory C \n\npolicy/institutional/legal/regulatory \n\ninclusive  social \n\ngovernance, \n\nto  be  an \n\ninternational \n\ntrade  corridor.  However, \n\n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is  expected \nfrom program implementation. \n \nBalochistan  is  the  largest  province  in  Pakistan  in  terms  of  land  area, \ncovering  44%  of  the  country.  Yet,  it  accounts  only  for  5%  of  Pakistan\u2019s \npopulation  or  8  million  people.  The  province  is  rich  in  natural  resources, \nparticularly in minerals. With 1,100 kilometers of coastline, it also has the \nthese \npotential \nendowments are largely untapped. The provincial economy has remained \nlargely agricultural, with crops and livestock contributing about 65% of the \nprovincial  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Agriculture  growth  has  been \nconstrained,  however,  due  to  perennial  water  scarcity  and  Balochistan\u2019s \ntopography, characterized by mountainous terrain. Only a third of the land \narea  is  productive  agricultural  and  grazing  land.  Industry  is  rudimentary \nand accounts for only 10% of provincial GDP. As a result, Balochistan has \nhad  the  weakest  economic  performance  among  the  four  provinces  of \nPakistan. Between FY1973 and FY2005, the economy grew at an average \nannual  rate  of  4.2%\u2014or  0.7  percentage  points  lower  than  North-West \nFrontier Province and Sindh, and 1.0 percentage point lower than Punjab. \nIn 2005, annual per capita income was $410, only two-thirds the national \nlevel and slightly more than half the level of Punjab and Sindh. \n \nBalochistan  faces  both  exogenous  and  endogenous  challenges.  Its  large \nlandmass,  scattered  population,  and  extremely  low  population  density \ntranslate  into  high  costs  to  deliver  public  services,  lack  of  economies  of \nscale  in  public  spending,  and  segmented  factor  and  output  markets. \n\n\fii \n \n\n \n\n \nProgram \nDescription \n\nCompounding  these  issues  are  weak  government  mechanisms  for \nplanning and fiduciary control, resulting in waste and inefficient allocation \nof  resources.  In  addition,  the  government  of  Balochistan  (GOB)  is \nresource  constrained.  Its  own-source  revenue  generation  is  low,  and  the \nprovince  depends  heavily  on  federal  transfers.  The  province  suffers  from \nchronic  fiscal  deficits,  resulting  in  mounting  overdrafts  with  the  central \nbank. \n \nThe lack of private sector participation in the development process further \nhurts growth prospects. While the province is rich in minerals, the private \nsector plays a limited role in the sector. The entry barriers are significant, \nand  these  are  aggravated  by  poor  physical  infrastructure  and  adverse \nsecurity conditions. \n \nThe  GOB  has  recognized  these  challenges,  and  has  made  improving  its \nfiscal  management  the  top  priority.  The  government  will  take  steps  to \nshore  up  its  own-source  revenues,  as  well  as  strive  to  obtain  the \nprovince\u2019s  financial  share  from  the  federal  Government.  In  parallel,  it \nneeds  to  strengthen  expenditure  management  through  prudent  fiscal \npolicy,  controls  to  limit  waste  in  current  expenditures,  and  adoption  of  a \nrealistic public sector development program. Expenditures at all levels will \nneed  to  be  rationalized  to  ensure  that  public  spending  does  not  exceed \nresources, and does not cause excessive deficit financing. The GOB also \nrecognizes the vast potential of the minerals sector, and the need to bring \ninvestments into the sector. \n \nIn  the  areas  of  fiscal  decentralization,  public  resource  management,  and \nsocial  service  delivery,  ADB  has  supported  Balochistan  through  the \nDecentralization  Support  Program,  Balochistan  Public  Resource \nManagement  Program,  and  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services \nProgram. The GOB has requested ADB support for its agenda through the \nproposed  BRMP  II  to  deepen  these  reforms,  particularly  in  resource \nmobilization. \n \nThe  long-term  impact  of  BRMP  II  is  higher  and  sustained  economic \ngrowth.  The  outcome  of  BRMP  II  will  be  improved  public  resource \nmanagement,  characterized  by  higher  own-source  revenues  and  greater \nefficiency  in  resource  allocation  and  utilization.  Better  public  resource \nmanagement  also  entails  improving  governance  in  key  sectors  in \nBalochistan,  such  as \nto  allow  sustainable \nthe  minerals  sector, \ndevelopment, which generates more fiscal resources, creates jobs, raises \nincomes, and reduces poverty. This is to be achieved through reforms that \nwill  expand  resources,  enhance  fiduciary  controls  and  safeguards, \nimprove  fiscal  planning  and  coordination,  and  improve  governance  and \nenvironmental safeguards in the minerals sector. \n \nBRMP  II  will  assist  the  GOB  to  (i)  improve  public  financial  management, \n(ii) develop  an  affordable  and  sustainable  pension  and  employee  benefit \nsystem,  and  (iii) enhance  government\u2019s  role  as  facilitator  of  minerals \nsector growth. The details are as follows: \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nImproved  public  financial  management.  BRMP  II  will \nhelp the government improve tax administration, implement \nbetter  revenue  and  budget  planning  and  monitoring,  and \nstrengthen internal controls. \nAn  affordable  and  sustainable  pension  and  employee \nbenefit system. BRMP II will help the government develop \neffective  governance  and  investment  structures  for  the \npension  and  general  provident  investment  funds,  improve \npension  administration,  and  streamline  the  pension  and \nemployee benefit system. \nEnhanced role as facilitator of minerals sector growth. \nBRMP II will help the government build capacity in contract \nnegotiations,  apply  environmental  safeguards  in  line  with \nbest  practices,  and  improve  governance  with  greater \ntransparency in mineral receipts and assignment of mining \nclaims. \n\n \nThe  proposed  program  cluster  consists  of  two  subprograms.  Two  loans, \ntotaling $100 million, will help finance subprogram 1 of BRMP II. The first \nloan of $45 million will be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank \noffered  rate-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  program  loan  agreement.  The \nsecond  loan  of  $55  million  will  be  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, with an annual interest rate of 1% during the grace period and \n1.5%  thereafter;  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  program  loan \nagreement. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan will relend the local currency generated from \nthe proceeds of the loan to the GOB. The terms and conditions will be the \nsame  as  those  extended  by  ADB  to  the  Government  of  Pakistan.  The \nGovernment of Pakistan will assume the foreign exchange risk. \n \nSubprogram  2  of  BRMP  II  is  also  expected  to  involve  a  loan  of \n$100 million,  subject  to  reform  progress,  and  resource  requirements  and \navailability.  \n \nThe GOB will ensure that the local currency counterpart funds generated \nby the loans will be used to support essential reform requirements as well \nas  to  finance  general  development  expenditures.  Specifically,  funds \ngenerated  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  loan  as  well  as  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan will be used to capitalize the pension and general \nprovident  investment  funds.  A  part  of  the  resources  generated  from  the \nAsian  Development  Fund  loan  will  be  used  to  supplement  development \nspending  in  districts  through  a  performance  grant  system  and  program \nimplementation. \n \nThe Program cluster covers the period from November 2007 to June 2010. \nThe  implementation  period  for  subprogram  1  is  November  2007  to \n\n \nLoan Amounts \nand Terms \n\n \nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nProgram Period \nand Tranches \n\n \n\n\fExecuting \nAgency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement  and \nDisbursement \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\niv \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDecember  2008.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  available  for  withdrawal  in  a \nsingle tranche of $100 million for subprogram 1, and will be released after \nall the prior actions in the subprogram policy matrix are met and after the \nloans become effective. The report and recommendation of the President \nfor  subprogram  2  will  be  submitted  for  Board  consideration  about  18 \nmonths  after  the  subprogram  1  loans  become  effective,  subject  to  the \nreadiness of the GOB to continue with its reform agenda. \n \n\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  BRMP  II  will  be  the  Finance  Department.  The \nimplementing agencies for subprogram 1 will be Board of Revenue, Excise \nand  Taxation  Department,  Finance  Department,  Mines  and  Minerals \nDepartment  and  Planning  and  Development  Department.  A  high-level \nsteering committee will be chaired by the chief secretary and comprise as \nmembers  an  additional  chief  secretary  (development),  finance  secretary, \nsenior member of the Board of Revenue, secretary of Excise and Taxation \nDepartment,  and  secretary  of  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Department.  The \nfinance  secretary  will  serve  as  secretary-member  of  the  committee.  The \nsteering  committee  is  envisaged  to  (i)  increase  government  ownership  of \nthe program, (ii) facilitate better program implementation, and (iii) provide \nprogram oversight to achieve the reforms envisaged under BRMP II. \n \nA program coordination unit (PCU) within the Finance Department will be \nestablished,  headed  by  a  senior  officer  with  the  rank  of  at  least  an \nadditional secretary. The PCU will coordinate and monitor the day-to-day \nimplementation  of  the  reform  agenda  of  BRMP  II.  The  head  of  the  PCU \nwill report directly to the finance secretary. Each implementing agency will \nappoint a focal person to coordinate with the head of the PCU in achieving \nthe reform agenda under BRMP II.  \n \nThe loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding local \nduties and taxes) of items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member \ncountries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  from  other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. ADB will have the right to audit the use \nof \nthe  Borrower\u2019s \ncertification.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans (1998). \n \nBRMP  II  outcomes  will  help  the  GOB  address  some  of  the  binding \nconstraints on economic growth by allowing for more efficient use of public \nresources, and paving the way for greater private investment, especially in \nthe  minerals  sector.  BRMP  II  will  help  the  GOB  apply  environmental \nsafeguards in line with best practices to ensure sustainability of growth of \nthe  minerals  sector.  Subprogram  1  of  BRMP  II  will  aim  to  address  the \nrevenue  dimensions  first  to  allow  the  GOB  to  obtain  tangible  results  with \nits  limited  capacity  and  provide  a  sound  basis  for  more  far-reaching \nreforms. Improved public resource management will create the necessary \nfiscal space and discipline to allow more spending on social services in the \nfuture. \n \n \n\nloan  proceeds  and  verify \n\nthe  accuracy  of \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nPart  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  meet  the  mounting  pension \nliabilities in the province. The accumulation under the pension and general \nprovident  investment  funds  will  allow  part  of  the  accrued  pension  and \ngeneral provident fund liabilities to be pre-funded; as such, in the medium \nand long term more fiscal space will be created to finance social services \nand  development  spending.  Pension  reform  will  also  benefit  current  and \nfuture pensioners by ensuring that future pension payments will be met by \na system with greater funding. The remaining loan proceeds will be used \nfor  development  spending  through  the  system  of  performance  grants  to \nlocal governments. Under the devolved structure, this translates into better \neducation and health services in the districts, and improvements in water \nand sanitation services in subdistricts and villages. \n \nThe benefits to be realized under BRMP II will be contingent on a number \nof assumptions and will be subject to risks. Therefore, mitigating measures \nhave been integrated into the design of the Program. \n \nMacroeconomic Risks. Pakistan\u2019s economy remains vulnerable to short-\nterm shocks as well as medium-term macroeconomic imbalances. Growth \nwill slow down in 2008-2009, and recovery will be contingent on domestic \nas  well  as  global  factors.  The  Government  has  launched  a  medium-term \nstabilization  program  with  support  from  development  partners.  ADB  is  a \nlead  partner  through  its  support  under  the  Accelerating  Economic \nTransformation Program. This 4-year program cluster aims to facilitate the \nstructural  transformation  of  Pakistan\u2019s  economy,  leading  to  sustained \neconomic growth of 8% per year between 2010 and 2020. \n \nSecurity  and  Political  Risks.  Continued  reports  of  instability,  attacks, \nplots, bombings, and even less-destructive activities such as protests and \nwork  stoppages  affect  investors\u2019  views  of  the  country\u2019s  overall  stability. \nThese  perceptions  affect  Balochistan  even  more,  given  the  security \nconcerns in the province. Balochistan\u2019s borders with neighboring countries \nare  porous,  smuggling  is  rampant,  and  law  enforcement  is  weak.  In \naddition, the province faces the risk of political and regulatory capture by \nthe local elite and subsequent continuation of privileges. Although most of \nthese political risks are beyond the control of a program such as BRMP II, \nthe policy actions aim to set up transparent mechanisms for revenue and \nexpenditure management, and to increase private sector participation. The \nintroduction of  more  efficient  and  accountable processes  and  procedures \nunder BRMP II will reduce the risk of political and regulatory capture. \n \nGovernance,  Corruption,  and  Bureaucratic  Risks.  Transparent  and \naccountable processes and procedures may be resisted for two reasons. \nFirst,  the  bureaucracy  might  be  unwilling  to  alter  established  routines. \nSecond,  moving  away  from  a  discretionary  to  a  rule-based  system  will \nlikely  limit  corruption  and  discourage  rent-seeking.  The  resistance  to \nreforms might be stronger in the second case. BRMP II proposes specific \nmeasures that will become part of the legal framework, and will track their \nimplementation.  \n \n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\fCapacity  Constraints.  Weak  capacity  in  the  province  is  likely  to  restrict \nthe  pace  of  reform.  BRMP  II  focuses  on  a  limited  number  of  practical \nactions.  Advisory  and  technical  support  through  a  TA  grant  will  also  be \nprovided to implementing agencies. \n \nFiscal  Sustainability  Risk.  Balochistan  has  limited  fiscal  resources, \ngenerates  little  own-source  revenue,  and  depends  heavily  on  federal \ntransfers,  which  account  for  about  93%  of  its  total  revenue.  At  the  same \ntime,  the  GOB  has  a  high  overdraft  with  the  central  bank.  The  GOB  is \ncommitted to increasing its own-source revenue to 9% of its total revenue \nby  FY2010.  The  pension  reform  and  other  expenditure  management \nmeasures  will  help  manage  contingent \nrecurrent \nexpenditures better. \n \nA  TA  grant  for  the  equivalent  of  $800,000  will  support  the  effective \nimplementation of BRMP II. It will focus on (i) improving fiscal and financial \nin  contract  management  and \nmanagement; \nenvironmental  safeguards  within  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Department; \n(iii) strengthening  governance,  investment  structures,  and  record-keeping \nin  the  pension  system;  and  (iv) strengthening  service  delivery  in  health \nand education. \n \n\n(ii)  building  capacity \n\nliabilities  and \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \nGrant \n\nvi \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  cluster  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Second  Balochistan  Resource \nManagement  Program  (BRMP  II),  comprising  two  subprograms;  and  (ii)  proposed  loans  for \nsubprogram  1  of  BRMP  II.1  The  report  also  describes  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for \nSupporting the Second Balochistan Resource Management Program. If the Board of Directors \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approves the proposed program cluster and the loans, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nBetween  FY2004  and  FY2007,  Pakistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  on \n2. \naverage  more  than  7%  per  year.  However,  global  recessionary  trends,  domestic  political \ninstability,  and  shortfalls  in  agricultural  production  have  dampened  growth  prospects.  GDP \ngrowth for FY2008 is estimated at 5.8%, more than a percentage point below the earlier target \nof  7.2%.  Other  indicators  point  to  deteriorating  macroeconomic  imbalances  on  various  fronts. \nInflation has reached double digits. Weak revenue growth and rising expenditures, because of \nsharp increases in food and fuel prices and interest payments, widened the fiscal deficit to 7.4% \nof  GDP  in  FY2008.  The  gap  between  savings  and  investment  has  also  expanded.  With  rising \ninternational commodity prices driving up the cost of imports, the trade deficit has also hit record \nlevels. Foreign portfolio and direct investment have declined, and the growth in remittances has \nnot been sufficient to offset these. External imbalances are also being manifested through the \ndepletion  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  at  the  central  bank  and  significant  currency \ndepreciation.2  In  order  to  restore  macroeconomic  stability,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  has \nsigned  a  Letter  of  Intent  on  20  November  2008  seeking  a  $7.6  billion  stand-by  arrangement \nfrom the International Monetary Fund, as part of which broad-ranging macroeconomic reforms \nhave been agreed upon. \n \n3. \nBalochistan is the largest province in Pakistan in terms of land area, covering 44% of the \ncountry, but is the smallest in terms of population, accounting for about 5% of the national total. \nThe  provincial  economy  has  remained  largely  agricultural,  with  crops  and  livestock  producing \nmore than 65% of provincial GDP and employing 60%\u201365% of the total labor force. However, \nthe  province\u2019s  topography  and  water  scarcity  constrain  agricultural  growth.  Only  a  third  of  the \nland area is productive agricultural and grazing land. Most industry is concentrated in Lasbela, \nand to a lesser extent in Quetta. Industry is rudimentary and only accounts for 10% of provincial \nGDP. Including mining, industry employs only 3.4% of the labor force. \n \n4. \nBalochistan  has  had  the  weakest  economic  performance  among  the  four  provinces  of \nPakistan because of its narrow agricultural and industrial base. Between FY1973 and FY2005, \nthe  economy  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  4.2%,  compared  with  4.9%  in  North-West \nFrontier Province and Sindh, and 5.2% in Punjab. In 2005, annual per capita income was $410, \nonly  two-thirds  the  national  level  and  slightly  more  than  half  the  level  of  Punjab  and  Sindh. \nBalochistan\u2019s  large  landmass  and  small,  scattered  population  have  resulted  in  segmented \noutput and factor markets. Compounding these issues is the adverse security situation, resulting \nin  the  poor  investment  climate.  Balochistan  is  rich  in  natural  resources,  but  most  of  these  are \nlargely untapped. Although Balochistan accounts for more than half of the country\u2019s prospective \n\n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework for BRMP II is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2008.

With 1,100 \nkilometers of coastline, Balochistan also has the potential to be an international trade corridor. \nHowever,  some  infrastructure,  logistics,  and  security-related  obstacles  need  to  be  removed \nbefore investors begin to consider investing in the province. \n \n5. \nThe  ongoing  economic  slowdown  in  Pakistan  will  likely  test  the  resilience  of \nBalochistan\u2019s  economy.  Structurally,  the  economy  is  vulnerable  to  downturns  because  of  its \nheavy dependence on a constrained agriculture sector with low productivity and the absence of \nan  industrial  base.  Inflation  will  likely  erode  incomes,  which  are  already  low,  and  no  major \neconomic alternatives are available. The provincial public sector will have to bear much of the \nburden  of  providing  social  safety  nets,  but  its  fiscal  performance  has  been  poor  for  several \nyears. \n \n6. \nBRMP I was approved by ADB in December 2004 and implemented over a period of 28 \nmonths.3  The  program  aimed  to  improve  provincial  finances  through  fiscal  and  financial \nrestructuring, and enhance service delivery. The Government of Balochistan (GOB) has sought \nfurther  support  to  deepen  and  sustain  the  revenue  management  reforms  and  to  undertake \nspecific  measures  to  attract  private  investments  in  the  minerals  sector,  one  of  the  very  few \navenues for promoting growth in the province. Section III (subsection D) provides further details \non BRMP I.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, ISSUES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description, Issues, and Opportunities \n\n7. \nThe  public  sector  plays  an  essential  role  in  the  development  of  Balochistan.  GOB  has \ntwo main tasks: (i) providing the public investment and regulatory framework to facilitate private \nsector activity that drives economic growth; and (ii) delivering public goods to address key social \nneeds,  such  as  education  and  health.  However,  government  inefficiency  has  hampered  this \nnexus,  weakening  the  province\u2019s  economic  and  social  performance.  Figure  1  shows  how \ngovernment inefficiency arises in Balochistan. It has two proximate causes: lack of fiscal space \nand  weak  institutional  capacity.  In  terms  of  fiscal  space,  GOB  depends  heavily  on  federal \nGovernment transfers, though having limited control over such transfers. Own-source revenues \nare low because of a narrow revenue base (arising from an underdeveloped private sector) and \npoor revenue administration. Expenditures, inherently high because of the larger cost required \nto  serve  sparsely  populated  and  scattered  communities,  are  constrained  by  poor  budget \nplanning  and  coordination,  inefficient  subsidies,  increasing  pension  payments,  and  lack  of \ninternal  controls.  As  such,  expenditures  are  poorly  targeted  and  prone  to  leaks.  Inefficient \nbusiness processes and large but poorly skilled bureaucracies weaken the institutional capacity \nin the provincial and local governments. \n \n8. \nThe 2007 public financial management and accountability (PFMA) assessment indicates \nthe  urgency  of  improving  fiscal  and  financial  management  to  address  the  lack  of  fiscal  space. \nAreas with low ratings include tax assessment and collection, expenditure composition outturns, \ninternal controls and account reconciliation, and weak tracking of resources for service delivery. \nA  summary  of  the  PFMA  assessment  is  in  Appendix  2.  As  such,  the  major  areas  for  policy \nintervention  would  be  in  (i)  revenue  administration;  (ii)  expenditure  management,  including \nbudgeting, internal controls, and pension liabilities management; and (iii) governance in sectors \nwith high growth and revenue potential, such as minerals.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2004.

Balochistan\u2019s  fiscal  performance  is  weak.  After  running  surpluses  in  the \nsecond half of the 1990s, followed by narrow fiscal deficits in FY2001 and FY2002, the province \nhas  experienced  widening  fiscal  deficits.  During  FY2003\u2013FY2006,  expenditures  increased \nrapidly,  far  outpacing  revenue  growth.  This  resulted  in  large  budget  deficits,  which  peaked  at \nPRs8.5 billion in FY2004 (more than double that in FY2003). Higher development spending and \nincreases in current expenditure transfers to local governments accounted for most of the rise in \nexpenditures.  While  total  expenditure  growth  has  been  slower  in  Balochistan  than  in  other \nprovinces,  the  ratio  of  recurrent  to  development  expenditures  has  continued  to  remain  high  in \nBalochistan  because  the  large,  sparsely  populated  province  necessitates  higher  operational \nexpenditures.  In  FY2007,  an  across-the-board  gain  in  federal  transfers\u2014more  than  PRs10 \nbillion  or  34%  more  than  the  federal  transfers  in  previous  fiscal  year\u2014significantly  boosted \nprovincial revenues and created additional fiscal space. This resulted in a sharp contraction of \nthe budget deficit to PRs244 million in FY2007 (from PRs5.7 billion in FY2006), even as local \ngovernment  current  expenditure  transfers  and  development  spending  continued  to  expand.  In \nFY2008,  the  growth  in  federal  transfers  tapered  off,  largely  because  of  declines  in  straight \ntransfers,  but  provincial  expenditures  continued  to  rise,  mainly  for  debt  servicing,  transfers  to \nlocal governments, general administration expenditures, and development outlays.4 As a result, \nthe budget deficit again widened to PRs3.3 billion. The sector analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n \n\nFigure 2: Fiscal Trends in Balochistan\n\n60.0\n\n50.0\n\n40.0\n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nB\n \ns\nR\nP\n\n30.0\n\n20.0\n\n10.0\n\n0.0\n\n(10.0)\n\n1988\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2008\n\nFiscal Year\n\nFiscal Balance\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nTotal Expenditures\n\nSources: Government of Balochistan. 2008.

Weak  Revenues.  Weak  own-source  revenue  generation  has  reduced  the  financial \nresources available for public spending. Balochistan\u2019s own-source revenue, while improving in \nrecent  years  (from  5.5%  of  total  revenues  in  FY2002  to  6.7%  in  FY2007),  remains  the  lowest \namong the four provinces of Pakistan. Recent inflows from land-related revenues have largely \ncome  from  one-off  receipts  from  the  sale  and  long-term  lease  of  public  land.  Reforms  in  the \nmotor vehicle tax (MVT) and provincial excise tax on liquor have led to higher collections. One \nof  the  BRMP  I  conditions  was  to  limit  the  property  tax  exemption  for  self-occupied  property  to \n139.35  square  meters  (1,500.00  square  feet).  Despite  an  executive  commitment  to  this \ncondition by the previous coalition government in 2004, the Provincial Assembly increased the \nexemption  to  464.52  square  meters  (5,000.00  square  feet)  in  2005.  Nonetheless,  perhaps \nbecause  of  better  property  tax  collection,  revenues  from  property  taxes  did  not  decline \nsignificantly  with  the  higher  exemption.  Property  tax  collections  were  PRs38  million\u2013PRs40 \nmillion in FY2006\u2013FY2008, slightly less than the PRs41 million collected in FY2005. However, \nrevenue administration remains weak, both for tax and nontax sources. \n  \n11.  Weak  revenue  performance  is  attributable  to  several  factors.  First,  procedures  give \nrevenue  officers  substantial  discretion,  which  often  encourages  underreporting  and  corrupt \npractices. Stamp duties and property taxes are still not based on proper valuation  and annual \nrental  value  tables,  resulting  in  ad  hoc  and  discretionary  valuation  of  properties.  The \nassessment  of  urban  immovable  property  tax,  for  example,  depends  on  the  tax  officer\u2019s \njudgment  of  the  rental  value  of  the  property.  For  the  stamp  duty,  no  valuation  rule  has  been \nformally prescribed.5 More important, while attempts to use valuation tables were made in the \n1990s, this was discontinued when a high court in 1996 disallowed the use of the tables. In the \nabsence of a computerized system of record-keeping, it is difficult to assess if MVTs are being \npaid on time, and at the required rates.  \n \n12. \nSecond,  uncoordinated  procedures  between  the  Board  of  Revenue  (BOR)  and  Excise \nand  Taxation  Department  (ETD)  have  resulted  in  revenue  leaks  from  capital  gains  tax  on  the \ntransfer  of  property.  The  BOR  registers  property  transfers  without  requiring  a  no-objection \ncertificate  from  ETD.  In  the  absence  of  any  required  documentation  from  ETD  certifying  that \ntaxes accruing to it, such as the property tax and capital gains tax, have been paid, properties \nare transferred without payment of these taxes. Unless the seller of the property voluntarily pays \ncapital gains taxes, ETD is unable to track property transfers that are occurring in the province. \n \n13. \nThird, the concept of internal audits within the tax collecting departments is nonexistent \nin Balochistan. A mechanism to verify the accuracy of tax assessments and collection, as well to \ndetect fraud, is not in place. Fiduciary arrangements are weak as the assessment and collection \nfunctions are entrusted to the same officer. As a result, opportunities for rent-seeking have been \navailable for years. \n  \nFourth,  collections  are  not  properly  reflected  in  provincial  accounts.  Reconciliation  of \n14. \nrevenue  receipts  between  the  Finance  Department  and  revenue  collection  agencies  is \ninfrequent,  and  there  is  no  integrated  database  to  facilitate  this  process.  From  a  policy \nperspective,  the  inability  to  have  complete  information  on  receipts  prevents  the  Finance \nDepartment from making optimal budgeting decisions. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n5   BOR has indicated a rule-of-thumb equivalent to the 3-year average of sale deeds in nearby similar properties with \nan upward adjustment of up to 13% per year, but this is not formally prescribed and is not uniformly being followed \nby revenue officers. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nBox 1: Summary of Key Constraints on the Revenue Front \n\n \nMain Problem: Low own-source revenues \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n\nUnbalanced and excessive discretionary power to tax officers \nLack of coordination in tax collection and verification procedures \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)  Weak tax and nontax receipts reconciliation \n(iv) \n\nAbsence of tax audits \n\n \n15. \nPoor Budgeting Processes. The current budget planning and preparation process is not \nconducive  to  proper  fiscal  discipline  or  allocative  efficiency.  Budget  preparation  is  mostly  an \nincremental  exercise  that  involves  little  consultation  with  stakeholder  departments  regarding \nallocations for recurrent expenditure. Expenditure allocation and past performance are not linked. \nThe  negotiations  on  allocations  occur  only  when  line  departments  submit  statements  of  new \nexpenditure to the Finance Department. Most departments\u2019 capacity for budget preparation is low. \nSystematic coordination among the Finance Department, Planning and Development Department \n(P&DD), and line departments for preparing current and development budgets is missing.  \n  \n16.  With  respect  to  the  development  budget,  the  weak  fiscal  position  has  compelled  the \nP&DD  to  refrain  from  starting  new  projects  until  ongoing  ones,  which  require  development \nfunds, are completed. The development budget for FY2008 is PRs10 billion, equivalent to 19% \nof  total  provincial  expenditures\u2014the  lowest  proportion  allocated  for  development  spending \namong  all  the  provinces.  However,  in  absolute  terms,  it  is  the  highest  ever  for  Balochistan. \nFunding  and  quality  of  spending  are  two  major  issues.  With  just  enough  revenues  to  cover \ncurrent  expenditures,  the  development  budget  depends  on  debt  financing,  of  which  expensive \noverdrafts  from  the  central  bank  have  been  increasing  since  FY2005.  No  limits  or  norms  for \ndeficit financing are in place, and debt liability management generally has been handled in an \nad hoc manner. Because of P&DD\u2019s weak capacity, the quality of public investments has been \nundermined by poorly planned and ad hoc loading of development schemes.  \n \nThe current level of aggregation in the budget prevents effective tracking of expenditures \n17. \ndown  to  the  spending  units.  This  allows  substantial  discretion  in  reallocating  funds  within \ndepartments.  The  resulting  misallocation  of  funds  and  the  bottlenecks  in  fund  flows  impede \nefficient delivery of public services. \n \n18. \nSubsidies for the operation of electric tube wells remain a major concern in Balochistan. \nThe  government  of  Balochistan  (GOB)  has  refrained  from  allowing  additional  subsidized  tube \nwells, and has maintained the PRs2 billion nominal cap on the government\u2019s share (about 4.6% \nof the provincial budget). Actual subsidy payments by the Irrigation and Power Department have \nremained below the ceiling. However, tube well owners are likely to be significantly affected by \nthe recent 20% increase in the electricity tariff, and the capping decision is likely to come under \nsevere pressure. A lifting of the cap would mean an increase in this inefficient subsidy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                        \n\n7\n\nBox 2: Summary of Key Expenditure Constraints \n\n \nMain Problem: Poor expenditure allocation and lack of fiscal discipline \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n\n(i) \n\nPoor  coordination  between  Finance  Department  and  Planning  and  Development \nDepartment \nPoor budget preparation capacities in departments \n\n(ii) \n(iii)  Weak budget execution \n(iv)  Weak development planning capacity \nUnfunded development budget \n(v) \n(vi) \nProportionately low and ineffective development spending \n(vii)  Continuation of inefficient tube well subsidies \n\n \n19. \nLack  of  Internal  Controls  and  Weak  Financial  Management.  Under  the  current \nfinancial management framework, internal controls necessitate verification of budget cover and \npre-audit, as delegated by the Accountant General Office (AGO), by the treasury officers before \npayment.  Payment  vouchers  are  then  forwarded  to  district  accounts  officers  (DAOs)  for \naccounting, with  reconciliations  taking  place  after  the  end  of  the  month.  However,  only  one  of \nthe 30 districts in Balochistan has a fully functional DAO office (in Uthal District). Yet, the bulk of \npublic expenditures take place in at the district level. The Finance Department has promoted its \ntreasury  officers  to  a  higher  grade,  and  designated  them  as  DAOs.  However,  they  have  not \nbeen  adequately  trained  in  the  accounting  and  are  unfamiliar  for  the  most  part  with  the  new \naccounting  model  and  chart  of  accounts.  Instead  of  treasury  officers  or  DAOs  preparing \naccounts  in  the  districts,  vouchers  are  sent  to  the  AGO  or  the  two  Accountant  General \nsuboffices for subsequent classification. This results in delays in the submission of the monthly \naccounts, misclassification, and subsequent problems in reconciling receipts and expenditures. \n \n20. \nThe GOB does not have full knowledge of its cash balances. Off-system funds, such as \npersonal  ledger  accounts  and  assignment  accounts,  are  widely  used.  Unlike  regular  budget \nitems,  these  accounts  are  not  transparent;  fund  movements  are  not  explained  because  their \noperations  are  not  classified.  In  addition,  the  existence  of  these  accounts  tends  to  be \noverlooked  as  they  are  part  of  the  public  accounts  and  not  the  provincial  consolidated  fund. \nThus, they are virtually outside the discipline of the budget.  \n \n\nBox 3: Summary of Key Constraints on Internal Controls \n\n \nMain Problem: Lack of transparency in and proper monitoring of public spending \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nWeak enforcement of control mechanisms for matching budget commitments and \nexpenditure  billings  at  the  level  of  the  drawing  and  disbursing  officer  and  district \naccounts officer (treasury officer)  \nDistrict-level accounting is delegated to untrained personnel \nInability to verify monthly expenditure statements \nPrevalence of non-transparent off-system funds \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nNeed  to  Improve  the  Management  of  Expenditure  Liabilities  through \nStrengthening the Civil Service Pension System \n\n21. \nBackground. The GOB employs about 142,000 civil servants and pays pension benefits \nto  about  33,000  retirees  and  dependants.  The  GOB  provides  a  multi-pillar  old-age  protection \nsystem to its civil servants, consisting of a pension scheme and a general provident fund (GPF), \nsimilar to the old-age systems of the federal Government and the other provincial governments. \nCivil  servants  pay  monthly  contributions  to  the  GPF,  while  the  GOB  pays  pensions  from  its \nprovincial budget. \n \n22. \nGrowing  Pension  and  Employee  Benefit  Liabilities.  The  Finance  Department \nestimates that pension and GPF payments increased on average fivefold between FY1997 and \nFY2007.  The  group  insurance  payout  has  quadrupled  over  the  same  period.  For  FY2007,  the \npayments  were  estimated  at  PRs942.78  million  for  pensions,  PRs561.94  million  for  GPF,  and \nPRs99.56 million for group insurance. The estimate of the financial cost of the accrued pension \nand GPF liabilities will require an actuarial valuation.  \n \n23. \nThe  GOB  recognizes  that  its  pension  and  GPF  obligations  have  major  implications  for \nthe  finances  of  the  province.  In  response  to  the  growing  fiscal  burden,  the  government \nestablished a pension section within the Finance Department. The main tasks of the section are \nto  quantify  the  pension  liability  of  the  GOB  and  to  prepare  cash-flow  projections  to  support \nbudgetary allocations.  \n \n24. \nGaps  in  Record-Keeping,  Administration,  and  Payment  Systems.  The  AGO  in \nQuetta  is  responsible  for  the  administration  of  the  pension  and  GPF  schemes.6  The  AGO \ndetermines  pension  and  GPF  entitlement  for  civil  servants  in  the  entire  province.  This  service \ndoes  not  currently  exist  at  the  district  level,  requiring  retiring  employees  to  travel  to  Quetta  to \nclaim their pension and GPF entitlements.  \n \n25. \nThe  system  of  record-keeping,  and  benefit  calculation  and  payments,  is  still  largely \nmanual  and  paper-based.  However,  it  is  gradually  being  automated  under  the  Project  for \nImprovement in Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA),7 using software that registers payroll, \npension, and GPF data needed to determine the eligibility and benefit amounts. The transition \nwas initiated in Quetta, Pishin, and Mastung districts, which are now computerized.8 While the \npayroll data were transferred from an earlier database, the collection of pension and GPF data \nhas been more challenging. Some data required in the pension module are not readily available \nin  the  paper  records.  For  the  GPF,  the  contributions  collected  since  each  employee\u2019s  date  of \nhire  are  required  to  calculate  the  value  of  the  GPF  account.  However,  many  records  are \nincomplete and require a long follow-up process. \n \nAnother  vital  step  in  the  administrative  process  occurs  when  retirement  benefits  are \n26. \nawarded.  A  claimant  currently  has  to  go  through  a  lengthy  process  of  completing  the  pension \npayment  order,  which  needs  to  be  cleared  by  the  claimant\u2019s  department  and  approved  by  the \nAGO.  Leaks  in  the  system,  in  the  form  of  \u201cghost\u201d  employees  and  \u201cghost\u201d  pensioners,  are \nbelieved  to  be  significant.  The  current  centralized  system  leads  to  collusion  and  the  failure  of \n\n                                                 \n6   Its functions include (i) government payroll administration, including the registration and record-keeping of the civil \nservants;  (ii)  pension  scheme  benefit  determination,  payment  of  annuity  benefits,  and  partial  commutations;  and \n(iii) pension fund record-keeping and payment of lump sum distributions. \n\n7   PIFRA  is  a  multiyear,  multiphase  World  Bank  project  designed  to  automate,  standardize,  link,  and  improve  all \n\naspects of financial reporting and analysis related to all agencies of the federal Government. \n\n8   The AGO has an Accountant General suboffice covering Pishin and Mastung districts. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                        \n\n9\n\nchecks and balances. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many pension payments continue after \nthe death of the pensioner, with the pension booklet being passed on over different generations. \n \n27.  Weak  Benefit  Structure.  Certain  features  of  the  current  pension  and  GPF  schemes \nhave led to inequitable and arbitrary outcomes for employees. For instance, an employee\u2019s final \nmonthly  payroll  is  used  as  the  basis  for  calculating  the  pension.  This  creates  an  incentive  for \nemployees  to  secure  a  pay  raise  or  promotion  immediately  before  retirement.  In  addition,  the \nunfunded promises under the pension and GPF schemes are imposing an increasing burden on \nthe GOB budget, as they do in other provinces. Reforms are required to develop an equitable, \naffordable,  and  sustainable  retirement  system  that  accommodates  the  mobility  of  the  labor \nforce, not only between the public and private sectors but also across provinces. \n \nOverall,  the  employee  benefit  system  needs  to  be  reviewed.  Benefit  payments  overlap \n28. \nwhen  a  civil  servant  dies.  At  the  same  time,  the  employees  are  dissatisfied  with  the  benefits, \nand the GOB is concerned about the growing cost of the programs. \n \n\nBox 4: Summary of Key Constraints on Pensions and Contingent Liabilities \n\n \nMain Problem: Unfunded pension and other contingent liabilities \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n\nGrowing pension liabilities \nGaps in record-keeping and administration \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)  Weak benefit structure \n\n3. \n\nNeed  to  Improve  the  Government\u2019s  Role  in  Facilitating  Minerals  Sector \nGrowth \n\n29. \nBackground.  Balochistan\u2019s  mineral  resources  have  not  been  fully  tapped.  Although \n1,237 mining licenses have been granted in the province, the scale of operations remains small, \nlimiting  production  volumes.  Independent  estimates  show  that  the  contribution  of  mining  to \nprovincial  GDP  declined  from  about  5.0%  in  1995  to  about  3.5%  in  2005.  Despite  the  lack  of \ninfrastructure, poor security conditions, and water and power shortages, interest in the minerals \nsector has increased in recent years. However, the GOB is not ready to maximize the benefits \nfrom  the  possible  influx  of  mineral  investments  as  it  suffers  from  governance  problems  and \nlacks  sufficient  capacity  to  provide  geological  data,  contract  management,  and  environmental \nsafeguards  design  and  enforcement.  As  a  consequence,  the  role  of  the  government  as  a \nfacilitator of sustainable growth in the minerals sector is hampered. \n \n30.  Weak  Environmental  Safeguards  for  Extractive  Industries.  Balochistan  does  not \nhave any provincial statutes on environmental protection for extractive industries, although there \nis  a  Balochistan  Environment  Protection  Agency  under \nthe  Environment  and  Sports \nDepartment.  The  Balochistan  Mineral  Rules,  2002,  require  that  holders  of  mineral  titles  or \nconcessions  to  take  measures  to  prevent  environmental  damage  and  compensate  for  any \ndamage  caused.9  However,  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Department  (MMD)  does  not  have  the \ncapacity to design environmental safeguards, much less enforce them. \n \n\n                                                 \n9   Government of Balochistan. 2002. Balochistan Mineral Rules. Quetta. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nSuboptimal  Mineral  Agreements.  Because  of  its  poor  capacity  to  evaluate  and \n31. \nnegotiate complex agreements, the GOB has not been able to reach its optimal development or \nrevenue  potential.  Training  and  expertise  is  required  in  the  following  areas:  legal,  technical, \nfinancial,  information  technology,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  and  exposure  to \ninternational best practice. \n \n32. \nFor mining operations to thrive, the benefits that accrue to the local community need to \nbe  emphasized.  This  requires  well-designed  contractual  arrangements  that  result  in  a \ncoordinated  community  development  plan  endorsed  by  the  local  community,  the  government, \nand  the  mine  operator.  In  Balochistan,  royalties  paid  to  the  GOB  do  not  revert  to  the  affected \ndistricts,  even  when  agreements  specify  that  they  should.  In  addition,  under  arrangements \nwhere  local  governments  are  relied  upon  to  deliver  the  services,  local  governments  lack  the \ncapacity to do so.  \n \n33. \nPoor Implementation in the Assignment of Mining Claims. Weak sector governance \nhas  led  to  the  proliferation  of  idle  mining  claims.  Nonproductive  or  idle  claims  throughout  the \nmineral survey areas in the province hinder competition and sustainable development. Although \nvirtually  all  potential  mineral  deposits  have  been  claimed  (i.e.,  licensed  out),  less  than  40%  of \nthe  areas  are  being  actively  prospected  or  explored.  These  idle  claims  are  serving  as  \u201cland \nbanks\u201d  rather  than  as  a  foundation  for  mineral  exploration  and  extraction.  The  Balochistan \nMineral Rules provide the procedures for assigning mining claims. Anecdotal evidence suggests \nthat the implementation of these rules in allocating mining claims has been subject to political \ninterference, and prone to corruption. Measures are needed to increase transparency, instill the \nrule of law, and eliminate arbitrary selection in the assignment of claims. \n \n\nBox 5: Summary of Key Constraints on the Minerals Sector \n\n \nMain Problem: Weak governance in the minerals sector \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nWeak environmental safeguards for extractive industries \nLack of government capacity in the design and negotiation of mineral agreements  \nPoor implementation in the assignment of mining claims \n\n \n\nB. \n\n \nGovernment Strategy \n\n34. \nEconomic  policies  in  Balochistan  are  guided  by  the  white  paper  of  the  annual  budget. \nThe  white  paper  for  the  FY2009  budget  outlines  the  overall  strategy  for  the  newly  elected \ngovernment  in  Balochistan.10  The  immediate  priority  is  to  improve  the  financial  health  of  the \nprovincial  government  without  compromising  development  objectives.  Recognizing  its  weak \nown-source  revenues  in  the  short  term,  the  GOB  will  strive  to  obtain  the  province\u2019s  share  of \nfederal  Government  transfers.  The  GOB  also  will  aim  to  manage  expenditures  prudently  by \nlimiting waste in current expenditures and rationalizing development expenditures. \n \n35. \nBalochistan  has  not  adopted  a  new  or  updated  medium-term  economic  framework  to \ncreate an overarching vision for the economy since the Balochistan poverty reduction strategy \npaper  (PRSP)  was  approved  in  2004.11  The  PFMA  assessment  (para.  8)  identifies  key \n\n                                                 \n10  Government of Balochistan. 2008.

More important, the assessment can be used as a \nguidepost  and  starting point  for  setting  the  governance  reform  agenda  over  the  medium  term. \nThe government\u2019s annual budget exercise recognizes the weaknesses identified by the PFMA \nassessment. However, in the absence of a medium-term strategy, the risk of having incoherent \nactions is high. This provides the opportunity for a new program, such as BRMP II, to help the \nGOB develop a new economic framework to map out actions over the medium term.  \n \nC. \n\nADB Operations and Lessons \n\n36. \nTo  support  decentralization,  public  resource  management,  and  social  service  delivery, \nADB  has  implemented  three  programs  in  Balochistan  since  2002:  (i)  the  Decentralization \nSupport  Program,  (ii)  BRMP  I,  and  (iii)  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program \n(BDSSP).  The  Decentralization  Support  Program  (2002\u20132008)  was  a  federal  Government \nprogram  with  province-based  components  to  improve  local  government  representation, \naccountability,  and  efficiency,  resulting  in  better  service  delivery  through  fiscal  support  for \nreforms in policy, legal, technical, and fiscal domains.12 BRMP I (2005\u20132007) aimed to improve \npublic  resource  management,  and  help  the  GOB  create  fiscal  space  to  finance  high-priority \nsocial  and  human  development  programs  by  local  governments.13  BDSSP  (continuing  until \n2009)  supports  policy  reforms  to  improve  education,  health,  and  access  to  water  supply  and \nsanitation.14  It  also  provides  financing  for  performance  grants  to  the  districts  to  improve  the \ndelivery of social services. \n \n37. \nA  Longer-Term  Strategic  Framework.  One  of  the  key  issues  raised  by  the  country \nassessment  program  evaluation  (CAPE)  is  that  the  concept  of  a  longer-term  road  map,  or  at \nleast  plausible  alternatives,  is  needed  for  successful  policy-based  lending.15  The  CAPE  finds \nthat  the  public  resource  management  and  devolved  social  services  programs  were  being \nreplicated  across  Pakistan  without  a  clear  longer-term  strategic  direction.  That  is  now  being \naddressed with a clear focus on improving government efficiency and service delivery.  \n \n38. \nSecuring Ownership of Reforms. All reforms, particularly policy and institutional ones, \nmust have full political and bureaucratic ownership within the government, as these frequently \ninvolve  changes  in  the  status  quo.  This  necessitates  adequate  internal  dialogue  between  the \nbureaucracy and the political leadership before the commitments are made. BRMP I appeared \nto suffer from this disconnect, as the bureaucratic-level commitments at times were inconsistent \nwith the political understanding of as well as commitment for reforms. \n \nBuilding  Flexibility  Within  Programs.  Policy  reforms  are  inherently  complex  and \n39. \nrequire  flexibility  to  respond  to  the  changing  social,  economic,  and  political  environment. \nExperiences  from  the  public  resource  management  and  devolved  social  services  programs  in \nPakistan  suggest  that  multitranche  programs  faced  significant  difficulties  in  implementing \nreforms.  Consequently,  tranche  releases  are  delayed  because  the  policy  conditions  are  no \nlonger  in  sync  with  changing  realities.  As  such,  single-tranche  cluster  programs,  with  policy \nactions  completed  before  program  approval,  combined  with  indicative  policy  actions  for \nsubsequent subprograms will provide the flexibility for ADB and the GOB to design sequential \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  2002.

The  BRMP \n\npolicy reforms that can adjust to the changing political and economic environments. As pointed \nout  in  ADB\u2019s  policy-based  lending  evaluation,  it  is  important  to  align  reform  outputs  and \noutcomes with the government reform agenda and priorities to contribute to desired results. 16 \n \nI \n40. \nexperience  demonstrates  the  need  for  and  importance  of  close  coordination  among  the \nimplementing  agencies.  It  is  vital  to  provide  incentives  to  selected  focal  persons  in  the  key \nimplementing agencies. Further, proper dissemination of the reform achievements and benefits \nhelps  build  constituencies  of  support,  an  element  that  should  receive  more  attention  in  any \nfuture reform engagements.  \n \n41.  Mode of TA Support Is Critical. The CAPE noted that Pakistan is a challenging context \nin which to implement a development program. Specifically, the disbursement of TA loans has \nbeen  problematic.  As  the  CAPE  indicates,  the  lack  of  ownership  by  executing  agencies  is  an \napparent reason for this. Under BRMP I, like in the case of other programs, the implementation \nof the TA loan was slow, with poor utilization. Constraints were faced in consultant recruitment \nas  well  as  integrating  TA  activities  towards  the  achievement  of  program  objectives. \nConsequently, TA grants may be more effective in providing TA support to Balochistan, as ADB \nis more directly involved with their implementation.  \n \nD. \n\nBRMP I: Key Achievements and Issues \n\n42. \nBRMP  I  was  envisaged  to  improve  provincial  finances  through  fiscal  and  financial \nrestructuring,  and  enhance  public  and  private  service  delivery.  These  outcome  were  to  be \nachieved  in  seven  policy  reform  areas:  (i)  rationalizing  subsidies,  (ii)  enhancing  revenues, \n(iii) improving  financial  management  systems,  (iv)  establishing  a  rules-based  system  for  local \ngovernment  funding,  (v)  improving  administrative  frameworks  for  public  service  delivery, \n(vi) creating  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  development  and  promoting  public\u2013\nprivate partnerships in service delivery, and (vii) improving water resource management.  \n \n43. \n  \n\nThe key actions undertaken included the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\ncapping the open-ended electric tube well subsidy in nominal terms and in terms \nof the number of tube wells eligible for subsidy, thereby preventing the crowding \nout of more productive expenditures;  \nopenly  auctioning  royalty  collection  rights  on  mines  and  minerals,  which  led  to \nsubstantial improvements in the province\u2019s own-source revenue;  \nincreasing the MVT;  \nreducing  the  throw  forward  of  development  schemes,  excluding  mega  projects, \nfrom 10 years to 4 years;17  \npromulgating the local government performance grant rules;  \ndeveloping a public grievance redress mechanism;  \nenhancing  the  financial  and  administrative  autonomy  of  the  Balochistan  Public \nService Commission; and  \napproving an integrated water resource management policy. \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2007.

In \naddition,  the  complexity  of  BRMP  I  was  considerably  higher  due  to  a  large  number  of  nested \nconditions. The second tranche release report for BRMP I stated that nine conditions, which had \nnot been fully complied with, should be revisited as conditions for processing of BRMP II.18 The \ngenerally  satisfactory  progress  made  under  the  pending  conditions  is  summarized  in \nAppendix 4. \n\n \nExternal Assistance \n\nE. \n\n45. \nSupport  from  other  development  partners  for  fiscal  and  financial  management  in \nBalochistan has been limited and sector specific. World Bank is implementing PIFRA II, an $84 \nmillion project to improve financial reporting and systems in all provinces, including that of the \npension system. World Bank, with support from the Department for International Development \nof  the  United  Kingdom,  is  preparing  a  fiscal  decentralization  program.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, through its National Execution Project, is (i) strengthening provincial \nand  local  government  institutions;  (ii)  ensuring  access  to  information  for  effective  decision \nmaking,  planning,  and  monitoring  in  provincial  and  local  governments;  and  (iii)  strengthening \nmechanisms  for  participatory  local  governance.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  (USAID)  is  helping  build  capacity  in  the  provincial  assembly,  while  its  Districts \nThat  Work  project  is  operating  in  Lasbela.  The  Canadian  International  Development  Agency, \nthrough the Supporting Democratic Governance Project, is creating an enabling environment for \ndemocratic governance and citizens\u2019 participation in 40 districts in Pakistan, 10 of which are in \nBalochistan. \n \n46. \nIn the minerals sector, World Bank is mobilizing its Mineral Technical Assistance Project \nto assist the Government of Pakistan and GOB in developing a minerals geological database, \nimproving regulatory framework, and building capacity. \n \n47. \nIn  terms  of  development  partner  coordination,  the  new  program  will  have  to  closely \ncoordinate with PIFRA II and Mineral Technical Assistance Project. Regular dialogue with other \nprojects will be conducted at the project and development partner level, and within the GOB and \nthe Government of Pakistan. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 5. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n48. \nThe  long-term  impact  of  BRMP  II  is  higher  and  sustained  economic  growth.  The \noutcome  of  BRMP  II  will  be  improved  public  resource  management,  characterized  by  higher \nown-source  revenues  and  more  efficient  resource  allocation  and  utilization.  Better  public \nresource management also entails improving governance in key sectors in Balochistan, such as \nminerals.  This  will  allow  sustainable  development,  which  generates  more  fiscal  resources, \ncreates jobs, raises incomes, and reduces poverty. This is to be achieved through reforms that \nwill  expand  the  resource  envelope,  raise  fiduciary  controls  and  safeguards,  improve  fiscal \nplanning  and  coordination,  and  improve  governance  and  environmental  safeguards  in  the \nminerals sector.  \n \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2007.

The Program will have three core \n49. \npolicy  areas  (CPAs):  (i)  improve  public  financial  management,  (ii) develop  an  affordable  and \nsustainable pension and employee benefit system, and (iii) enhance the government\u2019s role as a \nfacilitator of minerals sector growth. Subprogram 1 aims to provide the foundational reforms for \nbetter  public  resource  management  by  addressing  legal  and  institutional  hurdles  to  revenue \nmobilization, \nfinancial  control  and \ngovernance  mechanisms.  Subprogram  2  will  aim  to  deepen  the  fiscal,  financial  management, \npension,  and  minerals  sector  reforms.  The  development  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix  are  in \nAppendix 6.19 \n \nB. \n\nimproving  budgeting  procedures,  and  strengthening \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nCPA 1: Improve Public Financial Management \n\na. \n\nEnhance Own-Source Revenue by Improving Provincial Tax \nAdministration \n\n50. \nIncreasing  own-source  revenue  in  Balochistan  is  challenging  given  that  incomes  are \ngenerally low. Parametric tax reforms may impose an additional burden on the population and \nmay only add to political instability in the province.20 Instead, the proposed program will focus \non  tax  administration  reforms  that  reduce  the  discretion  of  the  collecting  agents  and  improve \ninformation  systems.  Tax  administration  reforms  will  cover  four  taxes:  stamp  duty  on  property \ntransfers,  urban  immovable  property  tax,  MVT,  and  capital  gains  tax  on  property  transfers. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  GOB  has  agreed  to  submit  to  the  Provincial  Assembly  a  draft \namendment to the Stamp Act to allow the use of stamp duty valuation tables. This will remove \nthe  legal  hurdles  that  have  prevented  the  use  of  such  tables.  Under  subprogram  2,  the \ngovernment will implement the use of the stamp duty valuation tables in the entire province. \n \nUnder subprogram 1, the GOB has agreed to submit to the Provincial Assembly a draft \n51. \namendment  to  the  urban  immovable  property  tax  law,  allowing  the  use  of  annual  rental  value \ntables in the assessment of this tax. In subprogram 2, the ETD will implement the annual rental \nvalue tables for Quetta, and will further develop and implement annual rental value tables in four \nmajor other urban areas outside Quetta.  \n \n52. \nBRMP  II  will  support  the  implementation  of  an  online  payment  for  MVT.  The  ETD  has \ninitiated  the  development  of  a  computerized  database  of  registered  vehicles  for  the  MVT;  and \nunder subprogram 1, it has completed data entry for the 11 offices of the ETD. This will allow \nthe  ETD  to  maintain  a  record  of  registrations  and  annual  tax  payments.  The  ETD  has  also \nagreed to finalize a time-bound action plan on the implementation of online payment of MVT. In \nsubprogram 2, the online payment will be rolled out in areas covered by the 11 offices. \n \n53. \nTo ensure that property transfers are taxed, the ETD and BOR will improve coordination \nto properly account for capital gains taxes on property transfers. Procedures will be revised to \nrequire  a  no-objection  certificate  from  the  ETD,  certifying  that  the  capital  gains  tax  has  been \npaid, before the transfer of property ownership is registered by the BOR. \n \n                                                 \n19 During the processing of subprogram 1, the mission and GOB had extensive discussions on social service delivery, \nDepending  on  the  outcomes  of  BDSSP,  the  scope  of  subprogram  2  may  be  expanded  to  cover  reforms  that  will \nfurther  strengthen  social  service  delivery.  Appendix  7  summarizes  issues  and  possible  future  reform  areas  for \nsocial service delivery. \n\n20 Parametric tax reforms refer to changes in the tax structure, including tax rates. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                        \n\n15\n\nUnder subprogram 2, a tax audit system will need to be developed, which will result in \n54. \nthe restructuring of the ETD along the lines of assessment, collection, and audit. The GOB will \nalso introduce taxpayer facilitation education programs to encourage tax payments. This ranges \nfrom  establishing  tax  assessment  kiosks  in  key  locations  to  more  transparent  assessment \nnotices.  \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthen Revenue Management Through Better Revenue \nPlanning, Reporting, and Monitoring \n\n \n55. \nInstitutional reforms  within  the  Finance  Department  are  required  to  strengthen  revenue \nmobilization.  Currently,  the  Finance  Department  lacks  the  technical  capacity  to  support  the \nformulation  of  revenue  policy,  undertake  revenue  monitoring  and  reconciliation,  and  forecast \nrevenue.  This  has  limited  its  role  to  receiving  the  collected  revenues.  Under  BRMP  II,  the \nFinance Department is envisaged to be the lead department that will formulate the directions for \nrevenue  policy,  as  well  as  coordinate,  monitor,  and  assess  the  performance  of  revenue-\ngenerating  departments.  This  necessitates  the  establishment  of  a  unit  dedicated  to  revenue \nmanagement  that  has  adequate  technical  capacity  and  revenue  information  systems.  Under \nsubprogram  1,  to  strengthen  the  province\u2019s  capacity  for  monitoring  revenues  and  revenue \nplanning, the Finance Department has established a revenue unit whose principal functions are \nformulating  revenue  policy  and  planning,  setting  revenue  targets,  projecting  revenue,  and \nmonitoring and reconciling revenue receipts. The unit will assist BOR, ETD, and other revenue-\ngenerating  agencies  on  tax  and  revenue  policy  and  management.  It  will  build  capacity  by \nhelping  determine  tax  rates,  fees,  and  user  charges;  and  updating  tax  and  revenue  policy.  In \nsubprogram  2,  the  unit  will  work  on  the  development  of  a  revenue  management  system  for \nmonitoring  revenue  receipts  from  both  own-source  revenues  and  federal  transfers.  Revenue \nreconciliation will be done monthly. \n \n\nc. \n\nAchieve Effective Budgets Through Better Budget Planning and \nCoordination, and More Fiscal Discipline \n\n \n56. \nThe Finance Department and P&DD need to work together to better coordinate budget \ndevelopment  and  utilization.  Formalized  arrangements,  such  as  joint  protocols,  would  be  one \ninstrument  that  would  allow  for  better  synchronization  with  an  agreed  upon  schedule  of \ndevelopment  expenditures.  The  GOB  has  agreed  to  adopt  joint  budget  protocols  for \ncoordinating  the  preparation  of  current  and  development  budgets  under  subprogram  1.  These \nwill result in clearer expenditure ceilings across line departments. Sustainability of development \nprojects  also  will  be  boosted  with  the  allocation  of  resources  for  recurrent  operation  and \nmaintenance  needs.  To \nthe  Finance  Department  has \ndisaggregated  the  budget  down  to  the  level  of  the  drawing  and  disbursing  officers.  To  guide \nbudget planning and policy, the Finance Department will institutionalize the preparation of rolling \nmedium-term revenue and expenditure projections in subprogram 2. The GOB will also adopt a \nfiscal  responsibility  framework  in  subprogram  2  to  instill  fiscal  discipline,  particularly  in \nexpenditure management. \n \nThe  PFC  needs  to  have  complete  information  on  the  staff  complement  in  each  district \n57. \ngovernment  when  deciding  the  magnitude  of  transfers  to  each  one.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \nFinance  Department  has  agreed  to  approve  a  detailed  schedule  of  establishment  for  district \ngovernments.  21  In  subprogram  2,  the  next  3-year  PFC,  which  is  expected  to  be  approved  by \n\nimprove  expenditure  allocation, \n\n                                                 \n21 The schedule of establishment is the staff strength (complement) sanctioned for each government unit. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nJune  2009,  will  use  the  detailed  schedule  of  establishment  to  determine  allocations.  This  is \nenvisaged to improve the precision of the allocation of the PFC awards to district governments. \n \n58.  While the removal of the tube well subsidy is the best solution, the political cost of such a \nmove  is  substantial.  With  electricity  prices  rising,  continuing  the  cap  on  the  subsidy  and  the \nfreeze on subsidized electric tube wells will  prevent the subsidy from increasing and crowding \nout  other  expenditures.  BRMP  II  will  ensure  that  the  PRs2  billion  cap  on  electric  tube  well \nsubsidies  and  the  freeze  on  the  number  of  subsidized  electric  tube  wells  at  15,660  remain  in \neffect.  \n \n59. \nUnder the program, the link between the development budget and poverty and economic \nstrategies will be strengthened. Under subprogram 2, the provincial government  will adopt the \nsecond Balochistan poverty reduction strategy paper as a medium-term economic development \nstrategy. Subsequently, the PSDP will have to be aligned with that strategy paper. \n \n\nd. \n\nImprove Budget Execution by Strengthening Financial Management \nand Disclosure \n\n \n60. \nThe  Finance  Department,  in  consultation  with  the  AGO,  will  facilitate  better  accounting \nand reconciliation of accounts in Balochistan. Under PIFRA, civil works to upgrade facilities in \n11 treasury offices and bring them up to the level required for DAO offices are expected to be \ncompleted  by  31  December  2008.  BRMP  II  complements  these  PIFRA  activities  by  ensuring \nthat  the  GOB  provides  appropriately  trained  personnel  to  staff  the  upgraded  facilities.  This \nwould help in the reconciliation and accounting of receipts and expenditures. \n \n61. \nUnder  BRMP  II,  the  Finance  Department  will  lead  the  reconciliation  of  expenditure \naccounts  for  the  provincial  government.  Expenditures  have  been  reconciled  for  FY2008  in \nsubprogram  1.  The  monthly  reconciliation  of  expenditures  will  start  in  subprogram  2,  and \nmonthly reconciliation reports with be posted on the GOB website. \n \n62. \nTo  increase  the  transparency  and  tracking  of  off-system  funds,  the  GOB  will  have  to \nenforce stringent budgetary discipline in the  management and accounting of off-system funds. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  Finance  Department  has  converted  the  personal  ledger  accounts  to \nlapsable special drawing accounts that are subject to regular budget, reporting, and audit rules. \nAll  assignment  accounts  will  also  be  subject  to  regular  budget,  reporting,  and  reconciliation \nrules. More  transparency and accountability will be supported in subprogram 2  with the public \ndisclosure  of  financial  statements  of  autonomous  government  entities  and  corporations  by \nincluding them in the budget documents, and through external audits of local governments. \n \n63. \nPublic  financial  management  can  be  strengthened  with  better  expenditure  tracking. \nUnder  BDSSP,  a  public  expenditure  tracking  survey  to  monitor  the  efficiency  of  social  sector \nexpenditures was initiated. This was to be piloted in two districts. Under subprogram 2, a review \nof the respective pilot districts will be conducted. Based on the review, the survey will be refined \nand expanded to at least five districts. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                        \n\n17\n\n2. \n\nCPA 2: Develop an Affordable and Sustainable Pension and Employee \nBenefit system \n\na. \n\nEstablish Pension and General Provident Investment Funds Based \non Sound Fiduciary Governance \n\n64. \nBRMP II will enable the GOB to better manage the growing burden of the pension and \nGPF  benefit  payments,  and  to  generate  fiscal  space  for  future  priority  development \nexpenditures. It will assist in the establishment of well-managed pension and general provident \ninvestment  funds  based  on  good  fiduciary  governance  to  meet  the  expanding  pension \nobligations.  In  2007,  the  government  passed  the  Balochistan  Pension  Fund  Management \nAuthority  Ordinance  and  the  Provincial  Employees  General  Provident  Investment  Fund \nOrdinance. \n \n65. \nThe  Finance  Department  has  prepared  a  time-bound  action  plan  under  subprogram  1 \nspecifying  the  steps  to  establish  the  pension  and  general  provident  investment  funds  with  a \nsound  governance  structure,  supported  by  a  diversified  investment  policy  and  a  plan  to \nimplement the investment management functions. At the same time, an actuarial valuation has \nbeen undertaken to estimate the pension and GPF liabilities, and provide cash flow projections \nfor  the  next  20  years.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  actuarial  assessment,  the  GOB  will  be  in  a \nposition to determine how to finance the pension and GPF liabilities. \n \n66. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  Finance  Department  will  establish  the  pension  and  general \nprovident  investment  funds  based  on  a  strategy  that  links  the  following  three  issues: \n(i) protecting  the  investment  process  through  the  structure  of  the  board,  (ii)  creating  an \ninvestment policy that meets the needs of an acceptable level of risk against investment return \ngoals, and (iii) establishing the structure of the investment unit to manage in this environment. \nKey actions in this regard include the creation of the investment unit, responsible for the day-to-\nday  operations  of  the  funds,  and  the  identification  of  functions  that  need  to  be  outsourced  to \nservice  contractors  (custodian,  actuary,  legal  advisor,  and  independent  auditor).  With  the \ncreation  of  the  pension  and  general  provident  investment  funds,  the  relevant  legislation  will \nneed to be revised. Implementing rules and regulations will need to be prepared and adopted. \nThe first substantial budget transfer to the pension and general provident investment funds will \ntake place once a sound governance structure, investment policy, and investment structure are \nin place, currently envisaged for FY2010. \n \n\nb. \n\nImprove Record-Keeping, Administration, and Pension Payment \n\n67. \nBRMP  II  calls  for  accurate  information  on  contributions  levied  and  accrued  GPF \nentitlements to the civil servants as well as timely issuance timely of correct pension and GPF \npayments to pensioners. A reliable record-keeping system in the AGO is required, as well as an \nautomated process to calculate benefits and a secure pension payment process. \n \n68. \nA  data  conversion  administration  task  force,  comprising  representatives  from  the \nFinance  Department  and  AGO,  has  been  created  under  subprogram  1  to  coordinate  the  data \ngathering and conversion tasks, the expansion of pension scheme- and GPF-related services in \ndistricts, and the verification of the accuracy of the data. Under this arrangement, the Finance \nDepartment  ensures  compliance  and  monitors  advancement  of  the  data  collection  and \nverification.  During  subprogram  2,  the  task  force  will  prepare  an  action  plan  to  expand  the \npension and GPF services in districts, and will initiate implementation.  \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nOnly the provincial AGO in Quetta and the Accountant General suboffice in Uthal District \n69. \nhave an operational database under PIFRA during implementation of subprogram 1, with a total \nof 41,797 civil servants, 12,033 pensioners, and 2,160 GPF records entered into the system.22 \nAGO  and  PIFRA  are  gradually  upgrading  and  computerizing  district  offices,  allowing  for  a \nfurther expansion of the computerization of the record-keeping. The data gathering, verification, \nand conversion for most payroll, pension, and GPF records will be completed in subprogram 2. \n \n\nc. \n\nStreamline Pension and Employee Benefit System \n\n70. \nBRMP  II  will  prepare  the  provincial  policy  makers  to  participate  in  the  debate  on \nreforming the pension and employee benefit system. The current pension and employee benefit \nsystem is outdated and needs a comprehensive revision.  \n \n71. \nBenefit  payments  overlap  considerably  when  a  civil  servant  dies.  The  GPF,  the \nbenevolent fund, and the group life insurance all pay benefits to the dependents. Streamlining \nthese programs seems advisable. At the same time, the entire employee benefit package can \nbe  revised  to  fit  the  needs  of  the  current  employment  situation.  Under  subprogram  2,  a \ndiagnostic study of the employee benefit package will be prepared, and it will propose different \nalternatives, with their costs prepared by an actuary. The alternatives will be discussed by policy \nmakers and stakeholders. \n \n72. \nPension  and  the  employee  benefits  are  a  federal  matter.  However,  the  provinces  are \namong  the  major  stakeholders,  and  they  are  interested  in  reforming  the  employee  benefit \npackage so it better fits the needs of their civil servants. The creation of the pension and general \nprovident  investment  funds  is  a  first  step,  but  additional  reforms  will  be  needed.  All  these \nchanges  come  together  with  an  immediate  and  future  cost.  The  actuarial  valuation  of  these \ncosts is a key element in the pension debate. The Office of the Chief Actuary in the Ministry of \nFinance  is  mandated  to  measure  the  accrued  pension  liability  of  the  civil  service  pension \nsystem, both for the pension and GPF benefits. The creation of an actuarial cell in the Finance \nDepartment  under  subprogram  2  will  allow  the  department  to  interact  better  with  the  federal \nActuarial  Office  and  to  understand  the  modeling  of  the  pension  and  GPF  reforms  in  the \nprovinces.  \n \n\n3. \n\nCPA 3: Enhance the Government\u2019s Role as Facilitator of Minerals Sector \nGrowth \n\na. \n\nBenefits Accruing to the Public Through Better Mineral Agreements \nand Environmental Safeguards \n\n \n73. \nBalochistan has significant potential to increase its revenues substantially by developing \nits minerals sector. In addition to potentially large royalty revenues, private sector involvement in \nmineral development can create jobs, stimulate spin-off industries, and contribute to local social \nand  physical  infrastructure  in  mining  areas.  To  develop  a  mining  sector  that  conveys  these \nbenefits,  BRMP  II  will  help  the  GOB  develop  sufficient  capacity  for  contract  evaluation, \nenvironmental safeguard design, and overall good governance of the sector to ensure sustained \neconomic  expansion.  In  addition  to  raising  the  government\u2019s  financial  returns  from  mining \nactivities,  sustainable  development  of  the  minerals  sector  needs  to  be  pursued.  As  investor \ninterest increases, BRMP II will assist the GOB in designing safeguards and contract provisions \nto prevent environmental degradation from mining activities. \n\n                                                 \n22 The PIFRA database uses the SAP/R3 software. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                        \n\n19\n\n \n74. \nTo increase fiduciary care and optimize results from evaluation and contract negotiation, \nthe GOB has agreed to establish a cell within the MMD to handle evaluation, negotiation, and \ncontract  management  under  subprogram  1.  The  cell  will  become  fully  operational  and  will  be \nstrengthened in subprogram 2. The dedicated unit will help build capacity within MMD to enable \nits  staff  to  properly  design  mineral  contracts  that  will  protect  the  interests  of  Balochistan.  In \naddition,  sufficient  capacity  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  benefit-sharing  programs, \nappropriate  environment  and  social  safeguards,  and  proper  labor  standards  are  included  in \nmineral contracts. To improve environmental safeguards for extractive industries and bring them \nin  line  with  best  practices,  BRMP  II,  through  its  TA  grant,  will  help  the  GOB  review \nenvironmental  policies  and  regulations,  and  build  capacity \nimplement \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  guidelines.  Under  subprogram  2,  information  on  all  mining \nand  mineral  investments  will  be  consolidated  in  a  manner  sufficient  to  inform  contract \nnegotiations, application evaluation, and sector strategy. \n \n\nto  design  and \n\nb. \n\nImprove Governance and Transparency in Mineral Revenues and \nMining Claims \n\n \n75. \nBRMP  II  will  help  the  GOB  address  key  governance  and  transparency  issues  in  the \nminerals sector. BRMP II will support greater transparency in mineral revenues in line with the \nExtractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative.  Greater  financial  transparency  enhances  the \nenvironment for domestic and foreign direct investment, which can be beneficial to Balochistan. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  GOB  has  agreed  to  approve  a  policy  statement  toward  greater \ndisclosure  of  government  revenues  and  company  payments  from  the  minerals  sector.  It  has \nalso  agreed  to  publish  mineral  royalties  received  from  mineral  title  and  concession  holders.  A \ntime-bound  action  plan towards  achieving  better  monitoring  and  greater  disclosure  in  line  with \nthe  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative  will  be  completed  and  implemented  in \nsubprogram 2. \n \n76. \nAs part of subprogram 1, the GOB has agreed to enhance the transparency in allocation \nof  mining  claims  by  the  publication  of  the  information  about  all  existing  claims  on  the  GOB \nwebsite. Under subprogram 2, comprehensive analytical work will be conducted to assess the \nstatus  of  each  mining  claim,  identify  which  can  be  classified  as  idle  or  unproductive,  and \nrecommend  measures  to  rationalize  such  claims.  The  study  will  recommend  measures  to \nstrengthen  the  business  process  in  the  assignment  of  mining  claims  to  reduce  political \ninterference  and  corrupt  practices.  This  is  expected  to  lead  to  the  development  and \nimplementation of a comprehensive strategy by the GOB to rationalize idle mining claims.  \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\nA Narrower and Focused Set of Actions to Improve Resource Management. In light \n77. \nof  the  capacity  and  implementation  constraints  in  Balochistan,  BRMP  II  is  simpler.  The  actions \nproposed  are  realistic  with  far  less  scope  for  delays  or  reversals.  A  two-pronged  approach  is \nadopted  on  financing  and  coordination.  First,  because  of  the  GOB\u2019s  chronic  lack  of  sufficient \nfinancial  resources,  BRMP  II  will  help  increase  resources  by  improving  efficiency  in  revenue \ngeneration, enhancing revenue monitoring and reporting, and institutionalizing revenue planning. \nFurther, additional resources are to be generated with better governance in the minerals sector. \nSecond,  as  more  resources  are  generated,  BRMP  II  aims  to  strengthen  agency  coordination, \nexpenditure  controls,  and  fiduciary  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  these  resources  are  utilized \nefficiently. In addition, more fiscal space is expected in the future as pension payments are made \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\noff-budget  and  funded  from  a  viable  investment  fund.  The  adoption  of  a  fiscal  responsibility \nframework in subprogram 2 will strengthen fiscal discipline. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n78. \nLoan  Size,  Terms,  and  Conditions.  The  proposed  program  cluster,  consisting  of  two \nsubprograms,  will  have  an  indicative  total  loan  amount  of  $200  million.  The  Government  of \nPakistan  has  requested  two  loans  equivalent  to  $100  million  to  help  finance  subprogram  1  of \nBRMP  II.  The  first  loan  of  $45 million  will  be  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, \nwith interest to be determined according to ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility;  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  other  terms  and \nconditions substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft program loan agreement \npresented to the Board. The second loan of $55 million equivalent will be financed from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, with an annual interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% \nthereafter;  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  program  loan  agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The \nGovernment of Pakistan has decided on its own to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  and  Special  Funds  resources,  and  it  has  made  an  undertaking  to  the  effect  that  this \nchoice  was  not  made  on  the  basis  of  any  advice  from  ADB.  Interest  rate  and  currency \nconversion options may be exercised according to the terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion  guidelines.  The  Government  of \nPakistan  will  relend  the  local  currency  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  the  GOB \nunder  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  extended  by  ADB  to  the  Government  of \nPakistan. The Government of Pakistan will assume the foreign exchange risk. \n \n79. \nThe following factors have been taken into account in determining the loan size: (i) the \nstrength  of  the  Program  and  its  development  impact,  (ii)  the  financial  and  political  cost \nassociated with the implementation of the Program, and (iii) the overall development financing \nneeds estimated by the Finance Department of the GOB. \n \n80. \nThe principal reason for the GOB\u2019s decision to seek ADB\u2019s policy reform and financing \nsupport is to begin partial funding of the civil service pension and general provident investment \nfunds.  It  intends  to  use  the  fiscal  space  created  by  the  $45  million  loan  funded  from  ordinary \ncapital resources, to capitalize the civil service pension and general provident investment funds. \nCounterpart funds generated from proceeds of the Special Funds resources loan in the amount \nof  $55  million  equivalent  will  be  used  (i)  to  supplement  development  spending  in  districts \nthrough  a  performance  grant  system,  (ii)  to  capitalize  the  civil  service  pension  and  general \nprovident investment funds, and (iii) for program implementation. \n \n81. \nReforms  under  BRMP  II  are  expected  to  improve  resource  mobilization  by  generating \nmore  revenues  and  improving  public  expenditure  management,  which  in  turn  will  translate  into \ngood governance, greater fiscal space, reduction in waste and inefficiencies, and improvement in \npublic  service  delivery.  Given  Balochistan\u2019s  weak  capacity,  reforms  under  BRMP  II  are  vital  to \nspur  and  sustain  development  in  the  province.  As  such,  the  opportunity  cost  of  not  undertaking \nreforms will be high. Because of their scope, the financial and economic costs associated with the \nreforms are expected to be substantial. Political costs are also considerable as the reforms, such \nas those to improve regulation of the minerals sector, plug revenue leaks, and strengthen fiduciary \ncontrols,  will  have  to  counter  vested  interests  that  benefit  from  weak  governance.  Direct \nadjustment  costs  include  (i)  capitalization  of  pension  and  general  provident  investment  funds, \n(ii) implementation  to  improve  revenue  generation  and  strengthen  public  financial  management \nsystems,  (iii)  modernization  of  the  public  sector  institutions  involved  in  regulating  the  minerals \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                        \n\n21\n\nsector, and (iv) leveraging of reforms that may face resistance through consensus building. While \nthe reforms will have costs in the short run, the eventual economic benefits will greatly outweigh \nthe costs in the long run. \n \nFor  the  current  fiscal  year,  the  GOB\u2019s  financing  needs  are  substantial  (Table  1).23  The \n82. \nbudget deficit is expected to reach PRs11.7 billion (about $143.9 million). Identified financing, from \nexternal and internal sources, is PRs5.9 billion (about $72.7 million). This means nearly half of the \ngovernment\u2019s  financing  needs\u2014PRs5.8  billion  (about  $71.2  million)\u2014are  unfunded.  The  plan  of \nthe GOB to substantially capitalize the pension and general provident investment funds increases \nthe unfunded gap to PRs11.3 billion (about $138.5 million). \n \n\nTable 1: Funding Requirement for FY2009 \n\n Item \n\nPRs Million \n\n$ Million \n\nTotal Revenues \nTotal Expenditures \nBudget Surplus or Deficit \nTotal Available Financing \nFunding Gap \nAdd: Pension and general provident Investment Funds \nCapitalizationa \nTotal Funding Gap with Pension and  \nGeneral Provident Funds \n\n51,526.75 \n63,267.05 \n(11,740.30) \n5,934.14 \n5,806.16 \n\n5,500.00 \n\n11,306.16 \n\n631.28  \n775.24  \n(143.86) \n72.71  \n71.15  \n\n67.39  \n\n138.54  \n\n( ) = negative. \na  Finance Department estimates. \nNote: Exchange rate used is PRs81.61:$1 (exchange rate as of 29 October 2008). \nSource: Government of Balochistan. 2008.

Quetta. \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n \n83. \nThe  Executing  Agency  for  BRMP  II  will  be  the  Finance  Department.  The  implementing \nagencies  for  subprogram  1  will  be  the  BOR,  ETD,  MMD,  Finance  Department  and  P&DD.  A \nhigh-level steering committee will be chaired by the chief secretary and comprise as members \nadditional  chief  secretary  (development),  finance  secretary,  senior  member  BOR,  secretary  of \nETD,  and  secretary  of  MMD.  The  finance  secretary  will  serve  as  secretary-member  of  the \ncommittee.  The  steering  committee  is  envisaged  to  (i)  increase  government  ownership  of  the \nprogram,  (ii) facilitate  better  program  implementation,  and  (iii)  provide  program  oversight  to \nachieve the reforms envisaged under BRMP II. It will convene at least once a quarter and post \nits major decisions and recommendations on the BRMP website.  \n \nA  dedicated  program  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  be  established  within  the  Finance \n84. \nDepartment; it will be headed by a senior officer with the rank of at least an additional secretary. \nThe  PCU  will  coordinate  and  monitor  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  reform  agenda  of \nBRMP II. The head of the PCU will report directly to the finance secretary. Each implementing \nagency  will  appoint  a  focal  person  to  coordinate  with  the  head  of  the  PCU  in  achieving  the \nreform agenda under BRMP II. The progress of reforms under BRMP II will be shared with ADB \nquarterly. The program management structure is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n                                                 \n23 A more detailed table is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nTranches and Counterpart Financing \n\n \n \n85. \nThe reforms supported under BRMP II subprogram1 cover November 2007 to December \n2008. The loan closing date for subprogram 1 is 30 June 2009. The indicative implementation \nperiod for subprogram 2 is from January 2009 to June 2010. Loan completion is expected by 30 \nJune 2010, and the loan closing date is 31 December 2010. \n \n86. \nTo ensure flexibility and still guide reforms, a detailed action plan for subprogram 1 has \nbeen  developed  in  consultation  with  the  GOB.  The  action  plan  is  a  living  document,  adjusted \nthrough  close  coordination  between  ADB  and  the  GOB  to  assist  with  policy  reforms.  While \nreform measures are closely linked and not discrete, the actions supported under BRMP I and II \ndo not overlap. \n \n \n \n87. \nThe  loans  must  have  become  effective,  all  prior  actions  in  the  subprogram  1  policy \nmatrix  in  Appendix  6  must  have  been  satisfied  before  the  subprogram  1  tranche  can  be \nwithdrawn. \n \n88. \nCounterpart  Funds.  The  GOB  will  ensure  that  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  by  the  loans  will  be  used  to  support  essential  reform  requirements  as  well  as  to \nfinance  general  development  expenditures.  Specifically,  funds  generated  from  the  ordinary \ncapital resources loan as well as the Asian Development Fund loan will be used to capitalize the \npension  and  general  provident  investment  funds.  A  part  of  the  resources  generated  from  the \nAsian  Development  Fund  loan  will  be  used  to  supplement  development  spending  in  districts \nthrough  the  performance  grant  system  and  program  implementation.  The  GOB  will  certify  the \nuse  of  counterpart  funds  in  line  with  the  Loan  Agreement  through  audited  statements \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n89. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items (Appendix 8) and imports24 financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loans  will  be  disbursed  to  Pakistan  as  the  Borrower,  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans.25  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired if, during each year that the loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of \nPakistan\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. The Government of Pakistan will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \ndocumentation under existing procedures will be required.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n24  Eligible imports are total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, imports specified on the list of ineligible \n\nitems, and imports financed by ADB or other international and bilateral development agencies.  \n\n25  ADB. 1998.

Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \napplicable loan regulations and the bidding documents.  \n \n91. \nThe Government of Pakistan and the GOB each acknowledge that ADB, consistent with \nits  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to \nundertake, directly or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or management \nimpropriety in the conduct of the Program. The Government of Pakistan and the GOB will each \ncooperate fully and ensure that each of provincial government\u2019s agencies cooperates with any \nsuch investigation and extends all necessary assistance, including access to relevant books and \nrecords. \n \n92. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen a deposit account at the State Bank of Pakistan to receive all loan proceeds. The account \nwill  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \nFinance  Department  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  progress  reports,  as  well  as  a  final \nreport on the progress of subprogram 1 implementation.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Pakistan  emphasizes the  strengthening of  internal control  systems \n93. \nand overall public financial management. Progress has been made with support from the World \nBank through PIFRA. The project covers the federal Government as well as the four provinces \nin Pakistan. \n \n94. \nThe policy actions under BRMP II will also complement the anticorruption efforts of the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan.  For  instance,  the  policy  actions  under  CPA  1  will  enhance \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  budget  preparation  and  strengthen  internal  controls  for \nbudget  execution.  In  CPA  2,  improvements  in  pension  record-keeping  and  administration  will \nminimize the scope for errors, as well as fraud in the accounting and disbursement of pension \nbenefits. In CPA 3, strengthening governance in the minerals sector will mitigate corruption. \n \nDuring  program  preparation,  a  governance  risk  assessment  was  undertaken  along  the \n95. \nlines prescribed by the implementation of the second governance and anticorruption action plan. \nThe  following  were  identified  as  major  governance  risks:  low  government  capacity,  poor \ndepartmental coordination, vested interests, within-year budget reallocations, weak procurement \nsystem,  large  cabinet,  and  political  issues  underlying  the  electric  tube  well  subsidy.  Risk \nmitigation measures include establishing a high-level steering committee to ensure government \ncommitment,  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  provincial  leadership  and  key  stakeholders, \nfrequent  ADB  missions,  TA  support  to  address  capacity  constraints,  and  coordination \nmechanisms. Supplementary Appendix C provides a more detailed risk analysis. \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation, Program Review, and Reporting \n\n \nThe GOB and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators to monitor \n96. \nBRMP  II  implementation  and  evaluate  its  impact  within  the  overall  framework  of  the  Program \n(Appendix 1).  \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nThe  GOB  and  ADB  will  periodically  review  progress  implementation  and  assess  the \n97. \nimpact of the BRMP II. The GOB will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions \nwith other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for BRMP II implementation, \nand  will  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  ADB \nand  the  GOB  will  review  subprogram  1  within  3  months  after  its  completion,  and  before \nsubprogram 2 starts, to examine and finalize the design of subprogram 2. The review will reflect \nthe  changes  that  might  have  occurred  in  the  external  policy  environment  during  the  program \nperiod, and identify initial lessons. The steering committee will conduct a progress review every \nquarter, and a progress report will be shared with ADB; the first progress report is due in June \n2009. A summary of the progress report will be published on the BRMP website. To assist the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  BRMP  II  implementation,  a  detailed  action  plan  has  been \ndeveloped for subprogram 1. Likewise, for subprogram 2, ADB will develop detailed action plans \nto serve as a guidance document to be revised and enhanced during review missions. BRMP II \ninformation  will  be  disseminated  to  the  public  through  a  dedicated  website.  The  PCU  will \norganize  regular  workshops  and  meetings  involving  civil  society  to  seek  ideas  from  the  public \nand to disseminate information related to the program. \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n98. \n The objective of the TA for Supporting the Second Balochistan Resource Management \nProgram is to assist the GOB in implementing the Program. Specifically, it aims to (i) improve \nfiscal  and  financial  management,  (ii)  build  capacity  in  contract  negotiations  and  environmental \nsafeguards within MMD, and (iii) strengthen governance and investment structures and record-\nkeeping in the pension system. \n \n99. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $1  million,  of  which  ADB  will  provide \n$800,000 equivalent on a grant basis from its TA funding  program. The GOB\u2019s contribution of \n$200,000  will  cover  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  training  and  workshop \nfacilities. Procurement of goods and services under the TA will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n100.  The Finance Department will be the Executing Agency for the TA. BOR, ETD, Finance \nDepartment, MMD and P&DD will be the implementing agencies. The TA will be implemented \nover  18  months,  starting  January  2009.  The  TA  will  support  20  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  5  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited through firms or individually, depending on the expertise available, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Where firms \nare to be hired, consultant selection  may use  any selection  method under  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants, but preferably the quality- and cost-based selection method. The type of \ntechnical proposal will depend on the contract budgets\u2014simplified technical proposals for contract \nbudgets  exceeding  $600,000,  and  biodata  technical  proposals  for  contract  budgets  of  $600,000 \nand  below.  Key  activities,  cost  estimates,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA  are  in \nAppendix 9. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n101.  BRMP  II  outcomes  will  help  the  GOB  address  some  of  the  binding  constraints  on \neconomic growth by allowing for more efficient use of public resources, and paving the way for \ngreater private investment, especially in the minerals sector. BRMP II will help the GOB apply \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                        \n\n25\n\nenvironmental  safeguards  in  line  with  best  practices  to  ensure  sustainability  of  growth  of  the \nminerals sector. Subprogram 1 of BRMP II will aim to address the revenue dimensions first to \nallow the GOB to obtain tangible results with its limited capacity and provide a sound basis for \nmore  far-reaching  reforms.  Improved  public  resource  management  will  create  the  necessary \nfiscal space and discipline to allow more spending on social services in the future. \n \n102.  The utilization of loan proceeds will achieve positive impacts. Part of the proceeds will be \nused to capitalize the pension and general provident investment funds. With proper governance \nstructures, as required under BRMP II, the investments will be more prudently managed and the \nfunds are more likely to be financially viable and sustainable. The accumulation under the funds \nwill allow part of the accrued pension and GPF liabilities to be prefunded, creating more fiscal \nspace  in  the  medium  and  long  term  to  finance  social  services  and  development  spending. \nPension  reform  will  also  benefit  current  and  future  pensioners  by  ensuring  that  future  pension \npayments  will  be  met  by  financially  viable  and  sustainable  pension  scheme  and  general \nprovident fund. The remaining loan proceeds will be used for development spending through the \nsystem  of  performance  grants  to  local  governments.  Under  the  devolved  structure,  this \ntranslates into better education and health services in the districts and improvements in water \nand sanitation services in subdistricts and villages. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n103.  Economic  and  Poverty.  BRMP  II  is  a  general  intervention  aimed  at  supporting \nsustainable economic growth. In that respect, it is expected to have an indirect positive effect on \npoverty  reduction.  The  impacts  on  employment  generation,  revenue  collection,  and  access  to \npublic  goods  and  services  are  expected  to  be  positive  in  the  long  term  through  the  efforts  to \nfacilitate  private  sector  development,  strengthen  public  resource  management,  and  improve \nsocial services.  \n \nInstitutional.  BRMP  II  will  contribute  significantly  to  institutional  development.  The \n104. \nrevenue  unit  established  in  the  Finance  Department  under  subprogram  1  will  enhance  the \ncapacity  of  the  provincial  administration  to  generate  revenue.  The  creation  of  pension  and \ngeneral  provident  investment  funds  will  allow  part  of  the  pension  and  GPF  liabilities  of  the \ngovernment to be prefinanced, creating fiscal space for future development expenditures. \n \n105.  Social. The improvement of public resource management practices, and the enhanced \nmonitoring  of  social  service  delivery,  through  the  public  expenditure  tracking  survey,  will \ngradually  improve  the  quality  of  those  services,  especially  in  key  social  sectors.  A  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n106.  Resettlement,  Indigenous  People,  and  Environment.  BRMP  II  will  have  positive \nimpacts  on  the  environment  by  maintaining  a  cap  on  the  tube  well  subsidy.  The  subsidy  for \nelectricity used by agricultural tube wells provides a disincentive for farmers to conserve energy \nor  save  scarce  water  resources.  Recognizing  that  the  minerals  sector  activities  can  harm  the \nenvironmental  if  improperly  implemented,  BRMP  II  will  develop  capacity  on  environmental \nsafeguard design and contract negotiations. It can also negotiate better deals, which will benefit \ncommunities  within  mining  concession  areas.  BRMP  II  will  not  have  any  involuntary \nresettlement components or any impact on indigenous people.  \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nC. \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n107.  The benefits to be realized under BRMP II depend on a number of assumptions and are \nsubject to various risks. Therefore, mitigating measures have been integrated into the design of \nthe Program. \n \n108.  Macroeconomic  Risks.  Pakistan\u2019s  economy  remains  vulnerable  to  short-term  shocks \nas well as medium-term macroeconomic imbalances. Growth will slow down in 2008-2009, and \nrecovery  will  be  contingent  on  domestic  as  well  as  global  factors.  The  Government  has \nlaunched a medium-term stabilization program with support from development partners. ADB is \na lead partner through its support under the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program.26 \nThis  4-year  program  cluster  aims  to  facilitate  the  structural  transformation  of  Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy, leading to sustained economic growth of 8% per year between 2010 and 2020. \n \n109.  Security and Political Risks. Continued reports of instability, attacks, plots, bombings, \nand even less-destructive activities such as protests and work stoppages affect investors\u2019 views \nof  the  country\u2019s  overall  stability.  These  perceptions  affect  Balochistan  even  more,  given  the \nsecurity concerns in the province. Balochistan\u2019s borders with neighboring countries are porous, \nsmuggling is rampant, and law enforcement is weak. In addition, the province faces the risk of \npolitical  and  regulatory  capture  by  the  local  elite  and  subsequent  continuation  of  privileges. \nAlthough most of these political risks are beyond the control of a program such as BRMP II, the \npolicy actions aim to set up transparent mechanisms for revenue and expenditure management, \nand to increase private sector participation. The introduction of more efficient and accountable \nprocesses and procedures under BRMP II will reduce the risk of political and regulatory capture. \n \n110.  Governance,  Corruption,  and  Bureaucratic  Risks.  Transparent  and  accountable \nprocesses  and  procedures  may  be  resisted  for  two  reasons.  First,  the  bureaucracy  might  be \nunwilling  to  alter  established  routines.  Second,  moving  away  from  a  discretionary  to  a  rule-\nbased system will likely limit corruption and discourage rent-seeking. The resistance to reforms \nmight  be  stronger  in  the  second  case.  BRMP  II  proposes  specific  measures  that  will  become \npart of the legal framework, and will track their implementation. \n \n111.  Capacity  Constraints.  Weak  capacity  in  the  province  is  likely  to  restrict  the  pace  of \nreform.  BRMP  II  focuses  on  a  limited  number  of  practical  actions.  Advisory  and  technical \nsupport through a TA grant will also be provided to the implementing agencies. \n \n112.  Fiscal  Sustainability  Risk.  Balochistan  has  limited  fiscal  resources,  generates  little \nrevenue,  and  depends  heavily  on  federal  transfers,  which  account  for  about  93%  of  its  total \nrevenue. At the same time, the GOB has a very high overdraft with the central bank. The GOB \nis  committed  to  increasing  its  own-source  revenue  to  9%  of  its  total  revenue  by  FY2010.  The \npension  reform  and  other  expenditure  management  measures  will  help  manage  contingent \nliabilities and recurrent expenditures better. \n \n\n                                                 \n26  ADB.  2008.

The Government and GOB will carry out the policies and \nactions in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained in the policy \nmatrix  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Government,  GOB,  and  ADB,  and  ensure \nsustainability of the reforms beyond the program period. \nEffective  program  management.  The  GOB  will  take  all  steps  and  actions, \nincluding provision of staff and other necessary resources to ensure satisfactory \ncompletion in a timely manner of all program outputs.  \nEnvironmental  assessment.  The  GOB  will  ensure \nthat  an  appropriate \nenvironmental assessment will be undertaken and necessary environmental and \nsocial safeguards incorporated in the mineral concession contracts.  \nCoordination  of  reforms.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat  adequate \ninformation  is  made  available  to  the  GOB  to  facilitate  consistency  of  revenue \nprojections  made  by  the  Government  and  GOB.  The  Government  will  provide \nadvice to the GOB on the design of the latter\u2019s fiscal responsibility framework and \nensure  consistency  between  the  Government  and  GOB  frameworks.  The \nGovernment  and  GOB  will  coordinate  reforms  affecting  the  pension  system  to \nensure consistency in the federal and provincial schemes. \nGovernance structure for pension and general provident investment funds. \nThe  GOB  will  ensure  that  a  sound  governance  structure,  supported  by  a \ndiversified \ninvestment \nmanagement  functions  for  the  pension  and  general  provident  investment  funds, \nis in place before the first substantial capitalization to the funds. Until these are in \nplace,  the  Government  and  GOB  will  ensure  that  the  portion  of  the  counterpart \nfunds to be allocated for the pension and general provident investment funds will \nbe invested in secured investment instruments, acceptable to ADB. \n\ninvestment  policy  and  a  plan \n\nimplement \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loans Effectiveness \n\n114.  Prior to the effectiveness of the loans, the Government will cause the GOB to \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nensure that the P&DD will rationalize the PSDP by (a) providing for all incomplete \nschemes  a  full  review  of  cost  estimates  and  phasing  of  schemes;  and \n(b) ensuring that the PSDP throw-forward, excluding mega projects, is reduced to \n3 years;  \nensure  that  the  Finance  Department  will  complete  the  study  on  estimation  of \ncontingent liabilities of the pension scheme and general provident fund;  \nsubmit to the Provincial Assembly the draft procurement law; and \nensure  that  BOR  will  construct  valuation  tables  for  determining  stamp  duty  on \ntransactions relating to property transfers and will publish the said tables on the \nGOB website. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nCondition for Disbursement \n\n115.  The loans for subprogram 1 will be disbursed in a single tranche subject to satisfaction \nof all subprogram 1 prior actions in the policy matrix.  \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n116. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  program  cluster  and  loans  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  program  cluster  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Second \nBalochistan Resource Management Program; \nthe loan of $45,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Second  Balochistan  Resource  Management  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program \nAgreements presented to the Board; and \nthe loan of $55,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Second  Balochistan  Resource  Management  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources,  with  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Program  Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n\n \n21 November 2008 \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \n   President \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                           Appendix 1 \n\n                                   \n29\n\n \nDesign Summary \nImpact \nHigher and sustained \neconomic growth in \nBalochistan \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance \nTargets and/or Indicators \n \nBalochistan provincial GDP \ngrowth increased from 2% in \n2005 to an average of 4% per \nyear during 2011-2013 through \naccelerating minerals sector \ngrowth, among others \n \nBalochistan keeps pace with \nthe national trends in reducing \npoverty \n \n \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanism \n \nEconomic and statistical \nreports by the agencies of \nthe federal Government \nand GOB, World Bank, \nand IMF \n \nMultiple indicator cluster \nsurvey \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  Sustained strong \n\neconomic performance \nof Pakistan \n\n\u2022  Complementarity \n\nbetween federal and \nprovincial government \neconomic policies \nmaintained \n\n\u2022  Political stability in \n\nBalochistan attained \nand maintained \n\u2022  Peace and order in \n\nBalochistan improves \n\u2022  Strong commitment and \ncontinued ownership of \nthe reform process by \nthe GOB \n\n\u2022  Favorable global \n\neconomic environment \nreturns \n\n \nRisks \n\u2022  Macroeconomic \n\nenvironment: Pakistan\u2019s \nwidening external \nimbalances \n\u2022  Political capture \n\u2022  Delays in \n\nimplementation of \nreforms because of \nweak capacity and \ncumbersome \nadministrative \nprocedures \n\n \nAssumptions \n\u2022  Effective policy \n\ndialogue between ADB, \nGOB, and key \nstakeholders \nmaintained \n\n\u2022  Departments remain \n\ncommitted to the reform \nprocess \n\n \nRisk \n\u2022  Limited fiscal \nsustainability \n\n \n\nOutcome \nImproved public \nresource management, \ncharacterized by higher \nown-source revenues \nand more efficient \nresource allocation and \nutilization  \n\n \nEconomic and statistical \nreports by the agencies of \nthe federal Government \nand GOB, World Bank, \nand IMF  \n \nAnnual development \nperformance reports by \nthe GOB \n \nADB review missions \n\n \nBy Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 \n(2011-2012), own-source \nrevenues increased to 12% of \ntotal revenues (from 7% now) \n \nBy FY2012, 5% of pension \npayments met by returns from \nthe pension and general \nprovident investment funds \n \nBy FY2012, mineral royalties \ndoubled to 30% of own-source \nrevenues \n \nBy FY2012, share of provincial \nspending on health increased \nto 10% (from 7% now) and \neducation increased to 25% \n(from 22% now) \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \nDesign Summary \nOutputs \n1.

 (ii) comprehensiveness  and \ntransparency;  (iii)  policy-based  budgeting;  (iv)  predictability  and  control  in  budget  execution; \n(v) accounting,  recording,  and  reporting;  (vi)  external  scrutiny;  and  (vii)  donor  practices.  The \nPFMA  assessment  uses  a  framework  that  rates  public  financial  management  attributes  on  a \nfour-grade  scale  from  \u201cA\u201d  to  \u201cD\u201d,  measuring  against  standard  operational  performance \nbenchmarks. A rating of \u201cA\u201d indicates international best practice, and a rating of \u201cB\u201d implies good \nachievement. Ratings of \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d suggest the need for improvement. \n  \n\nTable A2: Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment \n \n\nPublic access to key fiscal information \n\nExtent of unreported government operations \nTransparency of intergovernment fiscal relations \n\nAggregate revenue outturn compared to original approved budget \nStock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears \n\nIndicator \nA.

Balochistan Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment. \nPakistan. \n \n2. \nIn terms of the credibility of the budget, the PFMA assessment found that the aggregate \noutturn in revenues and expenditures exhibit good performance. However, there to appears to \nbe  a  substantial  reallocation  of  actual  expenditures  compared  to  the  original  budget. \nExpenditure payment arrears are not monitored.  \n \n3. \nBudget classification complies with international best practices. Budget documents have \nbeen  comprehensive  and  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfers  have  been  transparent.  However, \neffective mechanisms are not in place to take into account the fiscal risks in local governments \nand  government-owned  entities.  The  magnitude  of  off-budget  expenditures  is  also  uncertain. \nPublic disclosure in procurement and audit reports is weak. \n \n4. \nIn  terms  of  policy-based  budgeting,  the  province  tends  to  adhere  to  deadlines, \norderliness, and participation in the budget process. However, the province has not yet adopted \nmultiyear budgeting.  \n \n5. \nThe  PFMA  assessment  found  that  budget  execution  is  generally  weak.  It  performs \npoorly  in  all  aspects  of  taxation.  Likewise,  fiduciary  controls,  such  as  payroll  controls, \nprocurement, internal controls in non-salary expenditures, and internal audit need improvement. \n \n6. \nAccounting,  recording,  and  reporting  practices  were  assessed  as  poor.  Account \nreconciliation  is  inadequate.  Data  is  not  collected  on  resources  received  by  service  delivery \nunits. In-year budget reporting by district governments is of poor quality and not timely. Annual \nfinancial statements are delayed due to capacity problems. \n \n7. \nExternal  scrutiny  and  audit  need  significant  improvement.  External  audits  are  often \ncompleted late, audit certifications are delayed, and audit report follow-up is weak. The time for \nlegislative  scrutiny  of  the  annual  budget  is  limited.  The  Public  Accounts  Committee  in  the \nProvincial Assembly not only lacks technical capacity but it also has a large backlog of reports \nto be examined. \n \nPractices  by  donors  were  rated  favorably  with  budget  support  operations  discussed  in \n8. \ndetail  with  the  government  of  Balochistan,  and  with  a  large  portion  of  the  support  managed \nusing national procedures. However, financial information provided by donors for budgeting and \nreporting on program and project aid was rated as poor and needs improvement. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n35\n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \nA. \n\nFiscal Sector \n \n1. \n\nFiscal Performance \n\n \n1. \nBackground.  In  Balochistan,  the  principal  players  in  fiscal  and  financial  management \nare  the  Accountant  General  Office  (AGO),  Board  of  Revenue  (BOR),  Excise  and  Taxation \nDepartment (ETD), Finance Department, and Planning and Development Department (P&DD). \nOn  revenue  generation,  BOR  is  in-charge  of  all  land  taxes,  while  ETD  collects  the  non-land \ntaxes and fees. Unlike in other provinces, ETD is supervised by a member of the BOR. In recent \nyears,  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Department  (MMD)  has  played  an  increasingly  larger  role  in \nrevenue  generation  through  increased  operations  in  mining.  All  revenue  receipts,  both  federal \ntransfers  and  provincial  earnings,  accrue  to  accounts  managed  by  the  Finance  Department, \nbecause  it  has  the  mandate  to  fund  the  budget.1  During  budget  execution,  internal  controls \nwithin departments are mandated in the budget manual, and a series of reconciliations between \ndepartments, the Finance Department, and AGO are undertaken. \n \nOverall  Fiscal  Performance.  Balochistan  started  the  millennium  with  nearly  balanced \n2. \nbudgets.  However, \nfiscal  position  deteriorated  between  FY2003  and  FY2006  as \nexpenditures  accelerated  rapidly,  far  outpacing  revenue  growth.  This  resulted  in  large  budget \ndeficits, which peaked at PRs8.5 billion in FY2004. Higher development spending and increases \nin current expenditure transfers to local governments were mainly responsible for the expansion \nin  overall  expenditures.  In  FY2007,  an  across-the-board  gain  in  federal  transfers\u2014more  than \nPRs10  billion  or  34%  more  than  the  federal  transfers  in  previous  fiscal  year\u2014significantly \nboosted  provincial  revenues  and  created  additional  fiscal  space.  This  resulted  in  a  sharp \ncontraction  of  the  budget  deficit  to  PRs244  million,  even  as  local  government  current \nexpenditure transfers and development spending continued to expand. In FY2008, the growth in \nfederal  transfers  tapered  off,  largely  because  of  declines  in  straight  transfers,  but  provincial \nexpenditures continued to rise, mainly for debt servicing, transfers to local governments, general \nadministration  expenditures,  and  development  outlays.2  As  a  result,  the  budget  deficit  again \nwidened to PRs3.3 billion. \n \n\nthe \n\nTable A3.1: Fiscal Balance \n(PRs million) \n\n  \n\nItem  \n\nFY2001 \n\nFY2002 \n\nFY2003 \n\nFY2004 \n\nFY2005 \n\nFY2006 \n\nFY2007 \n\nFY2008 \n\nFederal Transfers \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7,218 \n\n8,716 \n\n5,102 \n\n7,415 \n\n9,294 \n\n5,042 \n\n8,098 \n\n9,003 \n\n5,859 \n\n9,018 \n\n7,225 \n\n6,001 \n\n11,445 \n\n12,500 \n\n14,380 \n\n17,317 \n\n9,150 \n\n6,915 \n\n9,179 \n\n13,437 \n\n10,485 \n\n8,095 \n\n12,207 \n\n15,359 \n\n  Total \n\n21,036 \n\n21,751 \n\n22,960 \n\n22,244 \n\n27,510 \n\n29,774 \n\n40,024 \n\n43,161 \n\n452 \n\n720 \n\n474 \n\n652 \n\n594 \n\n733 \n\n709 \n\n740 \n\n761 \n\n1,038 \n\n882 \n\n937 \n\n778 \n\n1,396 \n\n1,938 \n\n2,282 \n\n                                                 \n1   Budget preparation is bifurcated in Pakistan and the provinces, with the Finance Department handling the current \n\nbudget and PDD formulating the development budget. \n\n2   Straight transfers include net proceeds on federal excise duty on natural gas, royalty on natural gas, net profits on \n\nbulk generation of hydroelectric power, royalties on crude oil, and gas development surcharges. \n\nFederal Divisible  \nPool Taxes \n\n  Straight Transfers \n\n  Subventions/Grants \n\nProvincial Tax \nReceipts  \nProvincial Nontax \nReceipts  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fItem \n\n  Total \n\nFY2001 \n\nFY2002 \n\nFY2003 \n\nFY2004 \n\nFY2005 \n\nFY2006 \n\nFY2007 \n\nFY2008 \n\n1,172 \n\n1,126 \n\n1,327 \n\n1,449 \n\n1,539 \n\n2,434 \n\n2,820 \n\n3,219 \n\nTotal Revenues \n\n22,208 \n\n22,877 \n\n24,287 \n\n23,693 \n\n29,049 \n\n32,208 \n\n42,844 \n\n46,380 \n\nCurrent Expenditures \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nGeneral \nAdministration \n\n \n\n  Law and Order  \n\n  Community Services  \n\n  Social Services  \n\n  Economic Services \n\n  Transfers to LGs \n\nSubsidy (wheat and \ntube wells) \n\n \n\n  Debt Servicing \n\n  Total \nDevelopment \nExpenditures \n\n2,499 \n\n1,976 \n\n1,739 \n\n5,766 \n\n2,593 \n\n \n\n922 \n\n2,999 \n\n2,776 \n\n2,178 \n\n1,867 \n\n6,362 \n\n2,087 \n\n \n\n \n\n1,503 \n\n3,003 \n\n2,223 \n\n2,680 \n\n895 \n\n2,128 \n\n1,335 \n\n8,101 \n\n3,114 \n\n2,926 \n\n2,159 \n\n3,060 \n\n1,035 \n\n2,044 \n\n1,791 \n\n9,763 \n\n1,920 \n\n2,642 \n\n2,116 \n\n3,146 \n\n1,138 \n\n2,157 \n\n1,942 \n\n3,284 \n\n3,803 \n\n1,200 \n\n2,517 \n\n2,184 \n\n3,487 \n\n3,974 \n\n1,539 \n\n2,812 \n\n2,471 \n\n4,532 \n\n4,428 \n\n1,094 \n\n3,487 \n\n3,114 \n\n10,811 \n\n12,069 \n\n14,615 \n\n16,128 \n\n2,531 \n\n2,365 \n\n2,463 \n\n2,810 \n\n2,296 \n\n2,818 \n\n2,626 \n\n4,438 \n\n18,494 \n\n19,776 \n\n23,402 \n\n24,414 \n\n26,206 \n\n30,330 \n\n34,012 \n\n39,847 \n\n4,207 \n\n2,979 \n\n4,607 \n\n7,787 \n\n8,582 \n\n7,558 \n\n9,076 \n\n9,839 \n\nTotal Expenditures  22,701 \n\n22,755 \n\n28,009 \n\n32,201 \n\n34,788 \n\n37,888 \n\n43,088 \n\n49,686 \n\nFiscal Balance \n\n(493) \n\n122 \n\n(3,722)\n\n(8,508)\n\n(5,739)\n\n(5,680) \n\n(244)\n\n(3,306)\n\n ( ) = negative, LG = local government. \nSource: Government of Balochistan. 2008.

As  in  other  provinces  in  Pakistan,  Balochistan\u2019s \nsources  of  revenue  include  (i)  the  province\u2019s  share  of  federal  taxes,  transferred  through  the \nNational  Finance  Commission  award;3  (ii)  straight  transfers  from  the  federal  Government, \nlargely  excise  duties  and  royalties  on  petroleum  and  natural  gas  extracted  from  fields  in  the \nprovince; (iii) subventions, or special grants from the federal Government, which are awarded to \nBalochistan  in  acknowledgement  of  the  province\u2019s  low  development  status;  and  (iv)  provincial \nown-source  tax  and  nontax  revenues.  Revenue  from  the  province\u2019s  share  of  federal  taxes,  or \ntransfers  from  the  divisible  pool,  constitute  the  greatest  single  source  of  revenue  at  37.3%  of \ntotal revenues in FY2008, while straight transfers constitute 22.6%.4  \n \n4. \nShare of Provincial Own Source Revenue. Balochistan remains heavily dependent on \nthe  federal  Government  for  resource  transfers.  However,  the  share  of  own-source  revenue  in \ntotal provincial revenue increased from 5.5% in FY2003 to 6.9% in FY2008, and is expected to \nrise further in the medium term because of larger royalties from the mining sector. In absolute \nterms,  provincial  own-source  revenues  more  than  doubled  from  PRs1.3 billion  in  FY2003  to \nPRs3.2 billion in FY2008.  \n \nProvincial Tax Revenue. The motor vehicle tax, which is levied according to the engine \n5. \ncapacity  of  vehicles,  is  the  most  lucrative  tax  in  the  province,  accounting  for  27%  of  total \nprovincial  tax  revenue  in  FY2008.5  Motor  vehicle  tax  rates  were  raised  under  first Balochistan \nResource  Management  Program  (BRMP  I).  Provincial  excise,  levied  primarily  on  liquor, \ncontributes  an  additional  24%.  Advance  payment  of  provincial  excise  tax  on  liquor  has  been \nrequired  since  2005  to  prevent  the  accumulation  of  arrears.  Collections  from  this  tax  exceed \n\n                                                 \n3   Federal taxes, which form part of the divisible pool, include sales tax, income tax, customs, and excise duties. \n4   These proportions have changed from FY2002, when straight transfers were the single largest source of revenue \n\nat 40.6% of total revenue, while transfers from the divisible pool constituted 32.4% of the total. \n\n5   The share of motor vehicle tax in provincial tax revenues has remained at 25%\u201332% for the past 5 years. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n37\n\nPRs200 million in FY2008. Stamp duty yielded 22% of provincial tax revenue in FY2008.6 Thus, \nthe three taxes account for almost 75% of provincial tax revenue. Property tax and land revenue \ntogether yield barely 13% of provincial tax revenue, while capital gains tax, professional tax, and \ntax  on  the  transfer  of  property  also  remain  low-yielding  taxes.  Capital  gains  tax  has  been \nreduced  to  a  \u201cvoluntary\u201d  tax  in  that  only  other  government  entities  or  private  commercial \nenterprises that have to fulfill internal legal requirements pay the tax. The agricultural income tax \nenacted  in  2000  remains  suspended  even  though  the  drought  that  affected  the  province  has \nended.  \n \n\nTable A3.2: Provincial Own-Source Revenues \n(PRs million) \n\n Item \n\nFY2003 \n\nFY2004 \n\nFY2005 \n\nFY2006 \n\nFY2007 \n\nFY2008 \n\nProvincial Tax Receipts \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.14  \n\n0.80  \n\n0.85  \n\n165.42  \n\n215.86  \n\n225.00  \n\n224.62  \n\n216.89  \n\n70.57  \n\n100.99  \n\n141.45  \n\n162.10  \n\n176.00  \n\n173.67  \n\n227.45  \n\n190.63  \n\n222.96  \n\n253.48  \n\nOther Indirect Taxes \n\n74.52  \n\n21.63  \n\n98.76  \n\n100.08  \n\n102.85  \n\n104.80  \n\n594.21  \n\n709.31  \n\n761.01  \n\n822.11  \n\n882.08  \n\n937.35  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n50.00  \n\n13.80  \n\n43.92  \n\n1.00  \n\n1.32  \n\n0.44  \n\n10.72  \n\n21.15  \n\n1.45  \n\n2.75  \n\n25.14  \n\n9.12  \n\n0.86  \n\n14.78  \n\n15.68  \n\n18.77  \n\n28.68  \n\n0.83  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n36.49  \n\n11.28  \n\n89.60  \n\n0.02  \n\n4.96  \n\n1.03  \n\n0.08  \n\n3.44  \n\n1.18  \n\n1.55  \n\n2.14  \n\n18.12  \n\n33.60  \n\n9.95  \n\n49.47  \n\n25.57  \n\n9.92  \n\n23.53  \n\n0.22  \n\n \n\n41.40  \n\n15.46  \n\n45.47  \n\n40.00  \n\n17.54  \n\n52.51  \n\n38.00  \n\n18.20  \n\n74.80  \n\n1.70  \n\n1.50  \n\n1.00  \n\n1.00  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.08  \n\n23.27  \n\n0.19  \n\n1.29  \n\n1.55  \n\n22.33  \n\n37.63  \n\n3.81  \n\n33.02  \n\n25.00  \n\n12.16  \n\n28.42  \n\n4.62  \n\n1.81  \n\n7.21  \n\n131.25  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13.36  \n\n0.45  \n\n2.19  \n\n2.36  \n\n21.31  \n\n37.03  \n\n0.15  \n\n36.32  \n\n17.04  \n\n9.10  \n\n37.85  \n\n29.98  \n\n0.15  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n28.12  \n\n2.92  \n\n0.80  \n\n1.69  \n\n1.91  \n\n56.32  \n\n75.67  \n\n3.95  \n\n39.25  \n\n26.90  \n\n8.54  \n\n47.11  \n\n24.01  \n\n0.20  \n\n38.00  \n\n20.50  \n\n83.71  \n\n \n\n\u2014 \n\n0.85  \n\n224.87  \n\n207.50  \n\n256.12  \n\n \n\n15.53  \n\n28.01  \n\n2.65  \n\n1.25  \n\n1.97  \n\n2.35  \n\n75.01  \n\n105.57  \n\n0.33  \n\n42.05  \n\n20.00  \n\n9.46  \n\n45.04  \n\n19.88  \n\n0.15  \n\nUrban Immovable Property Tax \n\nTax on Transfer of Property \n\nLand Revenue \n\nWorkers Welfare Tax \n\nCapital Gains Tax \n\nSales Tax \n\nProfessional Tax \n\nProvincial Excise \n\nStamp Duty \n\nMotor Vehicle Tax \n\nProvincial Nontax Receipts \n\nTotal \n\nInterest \n\nDividends \n\nExamination Fee \n\nFee of the Government Audit \n\nPension Contribution \n\nWeights and Measures \n\nJustice \n\nPolice \n\nJails \n\nCivil Works \n\nPublic Health \n\nEducation \n\nHealth \n\nManpower \n\nSocial Welfare \n\nAgriculture \n\n \n\n107.41  \n\n122.05  \n\n149.33  \n\n139.15  \n\n161.14  \n\n172.23  \n\nFisheries \n                                                 \n6   The yield from stamp duty has tripled over the past 5 years, largely due to significant increases in property prices. \n\n30.45  \n\n4.01  \n\n2.40  \n\n3.85  \n\n6.17  \n\n4.03  \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n Item \n\nForest \n\nAnimal Husbandry \n\nIrrigation \nBoard of Revenue (Abiana)a \n\nIndustries \n\nPrinting and Stationery \nMines and Mineralsb \n\nExtraordinary Receipt \n\nFY2003 \n\nFY2004 \n\nFY2005 \n\nFY2006 \n\nFY2007 \n\nFY2008 \n\n26.16 \n\n6.05 \n\n37.32 \n\n5.61 \n\n6.03 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n14.12 \n\n5.17 \n\n63.72  \n\n14.74  \n\n31.16  \n\n14.02  \n\n74.92 \n\n125.32  \n\n145.73  \n\n3.01 \n\n1.03 \n3.18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n10.84  \n\n6.63  \n180.00  \n\n0.37  \n\n6.53  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n33.06  \n\n25.01  \n\n69.85  \n\n9.41  \n\n11.69  \n\n6.50  \n353.26  \n\n215.50  \n\n806.30  \n\n35.24 \n\n34.23 \n\n61.21 \n\n1.33 \n\n18.00 \n\n7.30 \n500.00 \n\n900.00 \n\nOther Miscellaneous Receipts \n\n389.99 \n\n334.37 \n\n218.66  \n\n648.30  \n\n22.63  \n\n177.54 \n\n732.77 \n\n739.01 \n\n777.82  \n\n1,448.32 \n\n1,326.98 \n\n1,538.82  \n\n 3,217.71 \n\n 2,280.36 \n\n 1,612.00  \n\n 2,434.11  \n\n 1,977.93  \n\n 2,860.01  \n\nTotal  \nTotal Provincial Own-Source \nRevenues \na   Abiana is water charges for irrigation. \nb   Includes development surcharge and royalties. \nNote: FY2003 to FY2006 are actual data.

Provincial  nontax  revenue  constituted  70.9%  of  total \n6. \nprovincial  own-source  revenue  in  FY2008,  up  from  55.2%  in  FY2003.  Land  sales  account  for \nthe largest share of nontax revenue. Notable increases in nontax revenue have accrued in the \npast  2  years  from  interest  and  dividends.7  Revenue  from  accounts  such  as  police  and  justice \nsystems  has  also  increased.8  However  the  single  largest  increase  in  nontax  revenue  is  from \nmines  and  minerals  royalties,  which  have  grown  from  PRs180  million  in  FY2006  to  PRs500 \nmillion  in  FY2008.  Further  increases  in  royalties  are  expected  in  the  medium  term  when  the \nReko Diq mine (gold and copper) and the Dudder mine (zinc and copper) start production.  \n \n7. \nExpenditures.  Between  FY2003  and  FY2008,  the  two  largest  components  of  current \nexpenditures  were  transfers  to  local  governments  (averaging  about  40%  of  the  total)  and  the \nwage  bill,  i.e.,  pay  and  allowances  (averaging  about  22%).  After  declining  from  13%  to  8% \nbetween  FY2003  and  FY2007,  debt  service\u2019s  share  of  current  expenditures  rose  to  11%  in \nFY2008, mainly because of the deferred cash development loans (CDLs) and overdraft interest \npayments.  Pension  payments  have  nearly  doubled  from  PRs0.9  billion  to  PRs1.5  billion, \nalthough  its  share  of  the  total  has  remained  flat  at  about  3.4%.  Subsidies  have  remained  at \nabout  PRs2.5  billion  since  FY2005,  with  their  share  of  the  total  has  declined  from  9.7%  in \nFY2005 to 6.6% in FY 2008, because of the cap on tube well subsidies. Non-salary spending, \nmainly  for  operations  and  maintenance,  is  being  crowded  out  by  other  expenditures,  as \nindicated  by  its  declining  share  of  expenditures  and  having  the  slowest  growth  among \nexpenditures. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n7   These increases may not represent significant changes in revenue collection efforts, but instead accrue from better \naccounting and book-keeping practices wherein departments whose receipts were previously not reported are now \nbeing recorded. \n\n8   These increases accrue from the re-designation of B areas, which are policed by the levies and other militias, to A \n\nareas, which are covered by the provincial police. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n39\n\nTable A3.3: Current Expenditures, by Economic Classification \n(PRs million) \n\nItem \nPay \nAllowances \nPension \nDebt Service \nTransfer to LGs \nSubsidies \nNon-Salary  \nTotal \nLG = local government. \nSource: Government of Balochistan. 2008.

In  FY2008,  the  development  budget  is  estimated  to \nhave  reached  almost  PRs10  billion.  Development  spending  is  highly  concentrated  on  road \ninfrastructure,  accounting  for  about  43%  of  the  FY2008  Public  Sector  Development  Program \n(PSDP). Spending on education accounts for only 4% of provincial PSDP, while health accounts \nfor only 1%. BRMP I advocated the rationalization of the PSDP. Departments were encouraged \nto include only approved schemes in their request for development funds, as well as to abide by \nbudget schedules for the approval of new schemes. These requirements reduced the size of the \nthrow  forward  of  the  PSDP,  excluding  mega  projects,  to  4  years  from  10  years.9  Funding  for \ndevelopment  spending  has  not  been  sufficient;  much  of  the  province\u2019s  receipts  allocated  for \ncurrent  expenditures.  Such  a  deficiency  in  revenues  has  resulted  in  overdrafts  with  the  State \nBank of Pakistan (SBP).  \n \n \n9. \nPublic Debt. Balochistan\u2019s total public debt was PRs53.6 billion at the end of FY2008. \nThe government of Balochistan (GOB) has engaged in debt swaps, replacing expensive CDLs \nwith  ADB  loans.  As  such,  outstanding  CDLs  totaled  PRs1.8  billion  at  the  end  of  FY2008. \nHowever,  debt  service  remains  high  because  of  deferred  interest  payments  on  CDLs  and  the \naccumulation of overdrafts with the SBP to cover development spending. At the end of FY2008, \noverdrafts  totaled  PRs16.3  billion.  As  part  of  its  debt  management  strategy,  the  GOB  has \nconverted the overdrafts into less expensive blocked loans at the start of FY2009. \n \n\n2. \n\nBudget Process \n\n10. \nProcedures  for  budget  preparation  and  execution  are  found  in  the  Balochistan  Budget \nManual (1987), which has not been updated since 1987. Balochistan is using the financial and \nadministrative rules, codes, and manuals applicable to the federal Government, as well as those \nof the defunct province of West Pakistan, which have not been revised. \n \nBudget preparation starts when the Finance Department issues the budget call circular. \n11. \nUnder the circular, departments are requested to prepare and submit a statement of permanent \n\n                                                 \n9   A throw forward is the excess of the cost of a development scheme over the current financial year\u2019s allocation, and \nis  one  of  the  measures  used  to  analyze  the  sustainability  of  the  development  budget.  It  provides  information  on \nhow  many  years  it  will  take  to  complete  a  development  scheme,  or  in  how  many  future  budgets  the  scheme  will \nhave to appear. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nexpenditures  and  proposals  for  new  expenditures  for  the  current  budget.  P&DD  prepares  the \nbudget for development expenditure of each department in consultation with that department.  \n \n12. \nRecurring  expenditures  (such  as  salaries,  allowances,  pensions,  and  other  office \nexpenditure)  are  generally  not  subject  to  review.  However,  new  current  expenditures  are \nreviewed  in  detail  by  the  Finance  Department  together  with  the  concerned  department. \nMeetings  between  the  Finance  Department  and  other  departments  to  review  the  statement  of \nnew expenditure are held from March to May. \n \n13. \nThe  projections  for  provincial  own-source  revenue  are  prepared  by  the  relevant \ndepartment  and  then  discussed  with  the  Finance  Department  before  finalization  and \nincorporation in the budget. Expected federal transfers to the province for the following year are \nintimated by the federal Government generally in May (tentative figures) and then are firmed up \nin early June of each year. \n \n14. \nFor  development  expenditures,  P&DD  and  the  concerned  department  review  project \nproposals.  Project  documents,  i.e.,  PC-I  or  PC-II,  for  major  investment  projects  are  prepared \nand scrutinized, keeping in view their future current expenditure requirements.10 The review of \ndevelopment  and  current  expenditures  continues  until  April  or  May.  Based  on  this  review, \nexpenditure projections are finalized. Departments prepare statements of revised estimates for \nthe current fiscal year, which are submitted to the Finance Department in April. This is based on \n8 months of actual expenditures and 4 months of projected expenditures.  \n \n15. \nBased on the expected share in revenues from the federal Government, the expenditure \nbudget,  especially  the  size  of  the  PSDP,  is  adjusted  and  budget  documents  prepared.11  The \nbudget is approved by the chief minister and the Cabinet before presentation in the Provincial \nAssembly. The budget is presented by the provincial finance minister before the members of the \nProvincial  Assembly  in  a  budget  session.  The  budget  proposals  are  then  discussed  at  length, \nand the budget is approved in the light of the discussion and suggestions by the members. The \napproved  budget  is  disseminated  to  the  provincial  secretaries,  who  act  as  the  principal \naccounting officers for their departments.  \n \nThe Finance Department releases the current budget quarterly to the relevant provincial \n16. \ndepartments through their administrative secretaries. The secretaries allocate the budgets to the \nrelevant officers, who release these to the drawing and disbursing officers.12 \n \n \nP&DD  authorizes  the  release  of  development  funds  by  the  Finance  Department  to \n17. \nprovincial departments. The Finance Department then places these funds at the disposal of the \nrelevant secretaries to increase development expenditure in accordance with the development \nschemes  approved  by  the  P&DD.  The  department  may  spend  part  of  the  development  funds \ndirectly or, in case of civil works, release the funds to the secretary of the Communication and \nWorks  Department.  P&DD  receives  progress  reports  of  the  development  projects,  including \n\n                                                 \n10  PC-I  and  PC-II  are  prescribed  forms  issued  by  the  Planning  Commission  of  Pakistan  for  project  documents  on \n\ndevelopment schemes. \n\n11  In  the  following  year\u2019s  budget,  comparative  figures  are  to  be  given  for  the  current  year\u2019s  budgeted  and  revised \n\nestimates, as well as the actual accounts of the previous year. \n\n12  For example, in Public Health Engineering Department, the secretary releases budget to the two chief engineers. \nThe  chief  engineers  then  release  the  budgets  to  Executive  District  Officers  of  the  relevant  district  (who  are  the \ndrawing  and  disbursing  officers)  for  operation  through  Account  No.  1,  which  is  the  account  that  funds  provincial \ngovernment expenditures. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41\n\nforeign-funded  projects,  from  the  departments,  and  matches  expenditure  against  budget \nallocation. \n \n18. \nDuring budget execution, re-appropriation powers are distributed at various levels. The \nsecretary of a provincial department, acting as the principal accounting officer, is responsible for \nthe proper implementation of the budget. The secretary is required to submit two statements of \nexcesses and surrenders, which compare the budgetary provision to the actual expenditure for \nthe elapsed period and the expected expenditure for the remaining period. The statements are \nsubmitted on specified forms to the Finance Department by 1 January and 31 March. Based on \na review of the budget in March (after the second excess and surrender statement is prepared), \nthe  strategy  for  budget  implementation  is  modified  for  the  rest  of  the  fiscal  year.  If  funds  for \nadditional  expenditures  are  not  available  through  re-appropriation  of  grants,  the  Finance \nDepartment  allows  a  supplementary  grant.  This  grant  is  subject  to  final  approval  by  the \nProvincial  Assembly  through  a  supplementary  budget,  which  is  approved  when  the  following \nyear\u2019s budget is presented. \n \n\n3. \n\nInternal Controls \n\n \n19. \nReceipts. All funds collected by the GOB accrue either to the consolidated fund or the \npublic  account.  All  receipts,  capital,  and  revenue  of  the  government  form  part  of  the \nconsolidated fund; all funds collected by the GOB on behalf of other parties, or held in a trust for \nspecial  purposes  and  therefore  not  available  for  government  expenditures,  are  public  account \nreceipts. Revenue public account receipts are kept in the name of GOB; revenue receipts of the \nGOB are included in the consolidated fund and public account receipts in the public account. \n \n20. \nThe process and procedures for revenue receipts of the GOB and the internal controls \nare defined for the revenue categories and the collection agencies in detail by each collection \nagency  (for  instance,  the  BOR  and  the  ETD).  However,  they  are  required  to  adhere  to  the \nprinciples prescribed by the Auditor General of Pakistan.  \n \n21. \nfollowing key steps are prescribed for all expenditure transactions: \n\nExpenditures.  Expenditures  are  accounted  for  on  a  cash  or  commitment  basis.  The \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nsanction of expenditure; \npreparation of claim voucher (bill) for payment, except for salaries and wages; \napproval of expenditure; \nregistration of claim voucher or purchase order; \ncertification of pre-audit claims; \nauthorization of payment; \nissue of payment; and \nrecording of expenditure in the accounts. \n\n \n22. \nThe  sanction  process  involves  a  budget  availability  review  for  all  expenditures,  and  a \npurchase order for contingent expenditures. A prescribed claim voucher is prepared for services \nrendered  or  work  done  under  a  contract  or  similar  arrangement  (above  a  certain  limit),  or  for \ntravel  expenses.  The  claim  voucher  or  purchase  order  are  approved  and  registered  by  the \nofficer  after  reviewing  the  correctness  of  the  claim  and  ensuring  that  all  supporting \ndocumentation is attached. Certification of pre-audit expenditures involves verification (i.e., the \nclaim voucher is approved and is valid in accordance with specified procedures, the head of the \naccount  to  be  charged  is  specified,  and  required  funds  are  available)  and  audit  to  identify \npossible fraud and irregularities. Authorization of payment is performed by the district accounts \nofficer  (or  treasury  officer,  in  districts  where  treasury  officers  perform  the  functions  of  district \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\naccount officers) or by the accountant general, but not by the same person who is the certifying \nofficer, unless specifically approved by the auditor general. Payment is made to the claimant for \nclaims which have been approved, certified and authorized for expenditure through checks with \ntwo  authorized  signatories.  All  payments  are  made  by  check  except  for  those  pertaining  to \nintergovernmental  transfers,  certain  salaries,  pension  and  provident  fund  payments,  and \npayments from imprest accounts. Recording of payments is covered by principles and practices \ndefined by the auditor general and procedures for each category of expenditure (e.g., salaries, \npensions,  provident  fund,  contractor  or  work  payments,  loans  and  advances,  international \npayments,  grants-in-aid,  and  contributions)  specified  in  the  accounting  and  treasury  manuals. \nPermanent  accounting  records  consist  of  the  establishment  register,  payroll  register,  pension \nregister, and general provident fund ledger. \n \nTreasury  and  Accounting  Functions.  Unlike  in  other  provinces,  only  a  district \n23. \naccounts  office  (DAO  Office)  has  been  established  in  Balochistan  (in  Lasbela,  Uthal  District). \nTreasury  offices,  which  are  under  the  Finance  Department,  carry  out  the  pre-auditing  and \naccounting  functions  in  addition  to  undertaking  Treasury  functions.  In  Khuzdar  and  Sibi,  the \nAccountant General Office (AGO) has set up suboffices to carry out the accounting functions for \na  cluster  of  selected  treasury  offices,  while  AGO  performs  those  functions  in  Quetta.  While \nadministratively the treasury offices are under the Finance Department, they are responsible to \nAGO for their accounting functions.

In Balochistan, reconciliation of expenditures by disbursing \nand drawing officers and verification of monthly expenditure statements are important functions \nof  the  treasury  offices  and  AGO.  The  following  reconciliation  procedures  are  carried  out  by \nthese offices: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAt the AGO, expenditure figures by function and object, which are produced from \nthe  accounting  record  by  two  sections  of  AGO,  are  reconciled.  Subsequently, \nAGO  reconciles  the  monthly  expenditure  statements  prepared  by  different \ndepartments with its figures. \nAt  the  provincial  department,  drawing  and  disbursing  officers  prepare  monthly \nexpenditure  statements,  which  are  reconciled  with  the  figures  of  the  treasury \nofficers and district account officers. Subsequently, the statements are certified. \nDrawing  and  disbursing  officers  send  their  certified  expenditure  statements  to \ntheir  principal  accounting  officers  for  consolidation  and  preparation  of  a \nconsolidated  expenditure  statement  for  the  department.  Departments  reconcile \nthe consolidated monthly expenditures with the figures of AGO. \nDepartments  forward  monthly  reconciled  expenditure  figures  to  the  Finance \nDepartment  using  a  prescribed  format.  AGO  likewise  provides  an  expenditure \nstatement for each department to budget sections in the Finance Department to \nconfirm  that  the  expenditure  is  in  line  with  the  budget  releases.  Differences  are \nreferred  to  AGO  and  the  relevant  department  for  reconciliation.  In  cases  where \nthe department is either unable to reconcile or faces delays in reconciliation, the \nfigure provided by the AGO is considered final. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nB. \n\nCivil Service Pension System \n\nThe GOB employs 142,629 workers and pays about 33,000 pension beneficiaries.14 The \n25. \ngovernment provides a two-layer old-age protection system to its civil servants, consisting of a \npension scheme and a general provident fund (GPF). In addition, the GOB provides for group \ninsurance and a benevolent payment. Monthly contributions are collected from the civil servants \ngross pay for the GPF, group insurance, and benevolent pay. The pensions are paid from the \nprovincial budget. All benefit payments are made on a pay-as-you-go basis.  \n \n26. \nThe pension scheme pays 2.33% of monthly final basic wage for each year of service, \nproviding up to 70% final basic wage replacement. The workers must complete at least 10 years \nof service to collect a monthly pension benefit and up to 30 years of service can be counted in \nthe calculations. Benefits can be collected after 25 years of service or upon reaching age 60. Up \nto  35%  of  the  pension  can  be  commuted  and  taken  as  a  lump  sum.  The  remainder  is  paid \nmonthly basis as an old-age, survivor, or disability benefit. \n \nThe  GPF  is  a  notional  defined-contribution  scheme.  Civil  servants  are  required  to \n27. \ncontribute  3%\u20138%  of  their  basic  salary  to  the  GPF,  depending  on  the  level  of  income.  The \ncontributions are registered as a book reserve with an administered rate of return (contributions \nare posted monthly to a record-keeping system, and an interest rate determined by the Ministry \nof  Finance  is  credited  annually  to  workers  accounts).  The  GOB,  which  uses  the  proceeds  as \nbudgetary support, pays a higher-than-market markup (on average 11% per year) on a pay-as-\nyou-go  basis.  The  full  amount  of  a  worker\u2019s  account  balance  (contributions  plus  annually \ncredited earnings minus loans outstanding) can be withdrawn in a lump sum upon retirement.  \n \n28. \nThe monthly deductions from the civil servants gross salary for the group insurance are \npaid  as  premiums  to  the  State  Life  Insurance  Company  and  provide  a  death  benefit.  The \nbenevolent  payment  covers  a  range  of  benefits,  such  as  a  monthly  payment  to  dependents \nupon death in service, marriage benefits, funeral grants, and education scholarships. \n \n\n1. \n\nGrowing Pension and Employee Benefit Liabilities \n\nEmployee  benefits  have  been  paid  on  a  pay-as-you-go  basis.  However,  the  accrued \n29. \nliabilities  are  growing  rapidly.  Initial  estimates  by  the  Finance  Department  show  a  fivefold \nincrease  in  pension  and  GPF  liabilities  between  FY1997  and  FY2007.  Likewise,  the  group \ninsurance payout has quadrupled over the same period. The liabilities for FY2007 are estimated \nat PRs942.78 million for pensions, PRs561.94 million for GPF, and PRs99.56 million for group \ninsurance. \n \n30. \nThe  GOB  recognizes  that  the  growing  liabilities  have  important  implications  for  the \nprovincial  budget.  It  also  realizes  that  urgent  reforms  are  needed  to  ascertain  the  financial \nsustainability of the employee benefit system, as well as to create the needed fiscal space for \npriority  development  expenditures.  A  Pension  Section  was  established  in  the  Finance \nDepartment to quantify the accrued liabilities of the GOB and to advise on planning of budgetary \nallocations.  In  addition,  the  GOB  is  planning  to  set  up  a  fund  management  mechanism  for  all \nfour benefits to prefinance part of the obligations.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14  Actuarial Office, Islamabad, and Balochistan Provincial Accountant General Office. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n45\n\n2. \n\nGaps in Record-Keeping and Payment System of Pension and General \nProvident Fund Benefits \n\n31. \nThe  AGO  in  Balochistan  is  responsible  for  the  administration  of  the  pension  and  GPF \nbenefits.  Its  functions  include  (i)  government  payroll  administration,  including  the  registration \nand record-keeping of the civil servants; (ii) pension scheme benefit determination, payment of \nannuity  benefits,  and  lump  sum  commutations;  and  (iii) GPF  record-keeping  and  payment  of \nlump sum distributions.  \n \n32. \nThe system of record-keeping and benefit calculation is still largely manual and paper-\nbased, which results in problems regarding the accuracy of pension entitlement calculation and \nindividual payments. However, the manual system is gradually being replaced by an automated \nsystem under the Project for Improvement in Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA),15 using \nsoftware  that  allows  registering  the  payroll,  pension,  and  GPF  data  needed  to  determine  the \neligibility and the benefit amount. The pension and GPF modules are still largely unused, as key \ninformation still needs to be collected and entered into the system.  \n \n33. \nAt retirement, the civil servant applies for the pension and GPF benefits with the AGO, \nwhich  is  a  lengthy  process.  The  claimant  has  to  complete  the  pension  payment  order,  which \nneeds to be cleared by the claimant\u2019s department. The claimant then has to travel to the AGO in \nQuetta to seek approval.  \n \n34. \nTo collect the first pension payment, the pensioner must present the payment booklet to \na  local  branch  of  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan.  Subsequent  pension  payments  can  be  done \nthrough  the  district  treasury  office.  Fraud  is  being  prevented  by  requiring  the  beneficiary  to \nappear  in  person,  although  this  is  not  required  on  a  monthly  basis.  A  local  district  official  is \nrequired to make a life certification of a pensioner, but this is not routinely enforced, resulting in \nthe  continuation  of  fraudulent  benefit  claims  after  death.  Leaks  in  the  system,  in  the  form  of \n\u201cghost\u201d  employees  and  \u201cghost\u201d  pensioners,  are  believed  to  be  significant,  but  are  based  on \nanecdotal evidence. \n \n\n3. \n\nWeak Employee Benefit Structure \n\n35. \nThe pension scheme for civil servants was inherited from the period of British rule, when \nthe composition and size of the civil service was different. It has not been altered fundamentally \nfor  more  than  a  century.  Certain  features  of  the  pension  scheme  have  led  to  inequitable  and \narbitrary  outcomes  for  some  individuals.  At  the  same  time,  the  unfunded  pension  and  GPF \nliabilities  are  imposing  an  increasing  burden  on  the  budget  of  the  provincial  government. \nPension  reform  is  required  to  develop  an  equitable,  adequate,  and  sustainable  retirement \nsystem that is tailored to the needs of a modern civil service. \n \n36. \nIn  addition,  there  is  a  high  level  of  dissatisfaction  with  the  current  employee  benefit \nstructure. When a civil servant dies, benefit payments overlap considerably. At the same time, \ncivil  servants  feel  that  the  benefit  package  at  retirement  is  small,  offering  limited  replacement \nincome  for  the  pensioner,  but  at  a  relatively  large  cost  to  the  government.  Streamlining  of  the \nemployee benefit package seems advisable. \n \n\n                                                 \n15  PIFRA  is  a  multiyear,  multi-phased  World  Bank  project  designed  to  automate,  standardize,  link,  and  improve  all \n\naspects of financial reporting and analysis related to all agencies of the national Government. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n4. \n\nRecent Achievements \n\n37. \nIn  2007,  the  GOB  passed  the  Balochistan  Pension  Fund  Management  Authority \nOrdinance,  the  Balochistan  General  Provident  Investment  Fund  Ordinance,  and  the  Provincial \nEmployees  Group  Insurance  Ordinance  in  preparation  for  the  creation  of  a  fund  management \nmechanism for pensions, GPF, and group insurance. An actuarial valuation is being prepared to \nestimate the accrued liabilities and determine the funding requirements for the pension and GPF \nfunds. A time-bound action plan is prepared to establish professional fund management.  \n \n38. \nA  major  improvement  in  the  AGO  record-keeping  system  is  to  be  expected  from  the \ntransition  from  a  paper-based  to  a  computerized  system,  using  software  for  payroll,  pension, \nand  GPF  data  registration.  As  of  May  2008,  only  the  provincial  AGO  in  Quetta  and  the \nAccountant  General  suboffice  in  Uthal  District  had  an  operational  database  developed  under \nPIFRA. The provincial AGO does the payroll for Quetta, Mastung, and Pishin districts, and has \n52,000  civil  servants  on  its  payroll.  The  Accountant  General    suboffice  in  Uthal  District  has \n5,000 civil servants on its payroll. By the end of 2008, AGO plans to have all pensioners in the \nprovince  entered  into  the  system.  With  ADB  assistance,  AGO  has  gathered  and  verified  the \nGPF records for the civil servants in 15 of 30 districts, and this information will be entered into \nthe database.16 The automation of the payroll, pension, and GPF databases will allow for more \naccurate actuarial valuations of the pension and GPF liabilities, as well as for the future transfer \nof the GPF contributions to the general provident fund. \n \n39. \nIn  contrast  to  the  other  provinces  in  Pakistan,  all  accounting  operations,  including  the \nrecord-keeping and determination of pension and GPF benefits, are centralized in the AGO in \nQuetta.  These  services  are  not  provided  in  the  districts.  With  assistance  from  PIFRA,  AGO  is \nupgrading  treasury  offices  and  gradually  introducing  the  provision  of  accounting,  pension,  and \nGPF  services  to  the  districts.  At  the  end  of  September  2008,  six  treasury  offices  had  partially \nexpanded  their  functions,  performing  the  payroll  and  GPF  functions,  as  well  as  the  limited \naccounting functions under the financial accounting and budgeting system. For the time being, \nthe pension functions remain centralized in the AGO. As an interim measure, AGO is creating \nfive  temporary  Accountant  General  suboffices  across  the  province.  This  will  allow  retiring  civil \nservants  to  submit  their  pension  claim  to  these  offices,  rather  than  in  the  provincial  AGO  in \nQuetta. \n \nC. \n\nBrief Description of the Mineral Resources in Balochistan \n\n \n \n40.  Mineral development, which generates royalties, remains inadequate and slow because \nof technical, financial, organizational, and other problems inherent in the industry. Unlike other \ndeveloping  regions  with  significant  mineral  endowments,  Balochistan  has  not  been  able  to \nadequately  exploit  its  geological  potential.  Although  Balochistan  has  more  than  half  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  prospective  minerals,  it  accounts  for  slightly  more  than  one-fifth  of  national  mining \nGDP.  Despite  indigenous  and  external  problems,  efforts  are  being  made  to  build  the  minerals \nsector into a potent force in the economy and source of government resources. \n \n\nMinerals Sector \n \n1. \n \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB.  2004.

Nine  minerals, \nincluding  coal,  copper,  zinc,  and  marble,  account  for  more  than  95%  of  the  total  volume  of \nminerals mined in the province. Balochistan has granted 1,237 mining licenses, but the scale of \noperations  in  the  sector  remains  small.  It  accounted  for  only  0.23%  of  the  total  employed \nworkers in the province in FY2006.  \n \n42. \n \n\nBalochistan\u2019s mineral wealth can be divided into four categories:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nMetallic  minerals.  The  province  has  deposits  of  metallic  minerals  such  as \ncopper, gold, chromite, titanium, and antimony, which require larger-scale mining \noperations  and  significant  investment,  sophisticated  mining  processes,  and \ninternational  technical  expertise.  These  minerals  would  be  mined  primarily  for \nexport, and can potentially be large foreign exchange earners.  \nCoal  mining.  Balochistan  is  estimated  to  have  the  largest  coal  deposits  in \nPakistan, and could play a significant role in national power generation. Coal is \nmined  on  a  large  scale  in  most  countries,  but  the  geological  seams  for  coal  in \nBalochistan  are  divided  among  a  number  of  small  operators,  with  small-scale \noperations being the norm.  \nIndustrial  minerals.  Industrial  minerals,  such  as  granite,  marble,  gypsum,  and \nlimestone, are mined in Balochistan. Markets for these minerals can be found in \nthe  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  sector,  as  well  as  in  large-scale \nmanufacturing like cement. \nArtisanal or small-scale mining. This form of mining is mostly for extraction of \nmarble and granite, and its products are used primarily in microenterprises. \n\n \n43. \nThe only major mine in Pakistan is at Saindak in Balochistan, which produces gold and \ncopper. The Saindak export-processing zone covers 520 hectares. Other key mining operations \nin the province include the Reko Diq copper and gold deposits in Chaghi district and the Duddar \nlead and zinc deposits in Lasbela. All of these are expected to significantly increase revenues \nfrom royalties, which accrue to the provincial government, in the medium to long term. Pakistan \nhas  joint  ventures  with  companies  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  as  well  as  a  Chilean \ncompany,  to  develop  mines.  Incentives  include  5%  customs  duties  on  imports  of  plant  and \nmachinery, no sales tax, and a depreciation allowance of 50% on machinery and equipment. \n \n \n \n \n \n44. \n \n\n \n \nLegal provisions related to mining and minerals in Balochistan include the following: \n\nLegal and Institutional Framework, and Governance Structures \n\nLaws and Regulations Covering the Sector \n\n2. \n\na. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973,  as  amended  and \nrestored. \nThe Regulation of Mines and Oil Fields and Mineral Development (Government \nControl) Act, 1948; Act No. XXIV of 1948. \nNational  Mineral  Policy  (NMP),  1995  (Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of \nPetroleum and Natural Resources, March 2002). \nPakistan  Environmental  Protection  Agency  Review  of  Initial  Environmental \nExamination  and  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Regulations,  2000  (as \npublished  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Local  Government  and  Rural \nDevelopment in The Gazette of Pakistan, 15 June 2000). \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n45. \n \n\n(v) \n\nBalochistan  Minerals  Rules,  2002\u2014to  implement  provisions  of  NMP,  1995 \n(government of Balochistan, Mines and Minerals Department, 8 March 2002). \n\nb. \n\nLicensing and Leasing Procedures  \n\nThe National Mineral Policy standardizes mineral licenses (concessions) into four types:  \n\nReconnaissance license. This is a nonexclusive, nonrenewable license, which \nis  valid  for  1  year  for  an  area  of  100\u201310,000  square  kilometers.  Decisions  for \nsecuring such licenses are to be delivered in 120 days. \nExploration licenses. This license is for more than 10% of an area covered by a \nreconnaissance license and not exceeding 1,000 square kilometers. Exploration \nlicenses are valid for 3 years. Two 3-year renewals are permitted, and for each \nsuccessive  renewal,  the  area  will  be  reduced  by  50%.  Applications  for  these \nlicenses are decided in 120 days. \nMineral  deposit  retention  license.  In  case  of  unfavorable  economics,  this \nlicense  will  enable  the  licensee  to  retain  the  area  for  2  years  (with  1-year \nextension). Applications for mineral deposit retention license are decided in 180 \ndays. \n\n(iv)  Mining license and/or lease. This lease is for areas up to 250 square kilometers \nand  is  valid  for  30  years  with  a  10-year  extension.  Decisions  for  such  licenses \nare awarded in 120 days. \n\nIn  practice,  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Department  (MMD)  issues  prospecting  and  mining \n\n \n46. \nlicenses to prospective mine operators. The procedures are as follows: \n \n\nProspecting licenses. The MMD issues prospecting licenses, awarding a plot of \n0.4-0.8 square kilometers to a prospector for 2 years.17 At the time of application, \nthe prospector has to obtain approval from the district coordination officer of the \ndistrict  where  the  operation  will  be  carried  out.  The  district  coordination  officer \napproves  the  prospecting  exercise  only  if  the  land  is  not  encumbered  and  is \nowned by the government, and if issuance of the lease is not likely to create any \nlaw and order issues. The Mines Committee checks that the land being given for \nprospecting or mining lease is clear; if there is a boundary dispute, the committee \nsettles  the  boundary  dispute  before  such  an  allotment.  After  completion  of  the \nrequirements, the applicant gets an allotment letter with the condition that he or \nshe  will  have  to  submit  a  prospecting  scheme.  The  prospecting  scheme  has  to \ninclude details on the mining method, number of employees, accommodation for \nlabor,  provision  of  a  mosque,  and  water  supply.  Upon  approval  of  the  scheme, \nthe director general of MMD issues a work order. The initial fee with application is \nPRs25,000;  and  after  receiving  the  offer  letter,  the  prospecting  licensee  has  to \nsubmit  PRs25,000  as  security,  PRs1,000  as  a  map  fee,  PRs20,000  for  pillars \nmarking  the  boundary,  and  dead  rent  at  PRs15  per  acre.18  These  amounts  are \ndeposited in the bank through a challan (deposit slip). \n\nMining  leases.  Once  the  prospector  has  proven  the  existence  of  reserves,  the \nprospecting  license  can  be  converted  into  a  mining  lease  after  completion  of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n17 This is equivalent to 100\u2013200  acres. \n18 A dead rent is the rent that is paid whether or not minerals are being extracted. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n49\n\nformalities. Upon starting production, the licensee has to apply to obtain rahdari \nto allow depositing royalty and transporting minerals. 19  \n\nc. \n\nProcedure for Collection of Mineral Revenues \n\n \n47. \nThe MMD used to print separate rahdari books for each mine owner. These were serially \npre-numbered, stamped, and signed by the department. Each rahdari had three copies. The first \ncopy (red) was required to be submitted to the check points. This information was entered in a \nregister separately for each mine owner. The second copy (green) was to remain with the truck \nduring transportation, while the third copy (white) was for the record. The copies were colored \nso that they could not be photocopied and misused. This system continued from 1995 to 2001. \nLater,  the  printing  of  these  rahdari  books  by  the  department  was  discontinued,  and  now  the \nmine  owners  get  these  books  printed  and  pre-numbered.  All  three  copies  are  white,  but  the \nsame system is being followed. \n \n48. \nThe province has 10 check points for checking mineral transportation, and each sends a \nmonthly return (showing minerals produced by each licensee) to the head office in Quetta. The \nlicensees deposit royalties every 6 months based on minerals produced and transported during \nthat  period.  The  quantity  for  which  royalties  have  been  deposited  could  be  counterchecked \nagainst  the  monthly  statements  provided  by  the  check  point,  or  with  the  register  kept  at  the \ncheck  points.  The  amount  deposited  by  the  licensees  in  the  bank  through  challan  is \ncounterchecked with the detail of deposits provided by the bank. In addition to the check points, \nchecking  squads  are  also  employed  to  check  whether  the  truck  transporting  minerals  has  a \nrahdari. \n \n49. \nSince  FY2007,  the  province  has  been  divided  into  eight  blocks  according  to  mineral \ndistricts,  and  collection  of  royalties  has  been  privatized  in  more  than  half  the  blocks.  The \nrevenue sources whose collection was privatized were generating about PRs30 million per year \nand  the  same  amount  was  fixed  as  the  official  minimum  acceptable  bid.  The  open  auction \nresulted in a high bid of PRs44 million. The bid is still awaiting official acceptance, which would \nallow it to be converted into a revenue-collection contract. \n \nRevenue  collection  from  sand  and  crush  rocks  at  Hub  is  privatized.  The  collection  has \n50. \nincreased from PRs4 million to more than PRs10 million in 2 years. The latest auction was for \nPRs22 million. However, after finalization of the contract, one of the bidders who was not among \nthe three highest challenged the award in court and MMD canceled the contract award. \n \n\nd. \n\nRoyalty Rates \n\n \n51. \nIn  May  2006,  the  royalty  rates  (rupees  per  ton)  were  substantially  increased,  but  were \nreduced  later  in  response  to  protests  from  the  mining  sector.  Even  so,  rates  are  much  higher \nnow  than  in  2005.  Revenues  have  increased  from  PRs353  million  in  FY2007  to  an  estimated \nPRs500  in  FY2008.  Saindak  (about  PRs300  million),  Chamalan  Coal  Mines  (PRs30  million), \nand Onyx Mines of Zehri brothers (PRs10 million) contribute the most in royalties. When Reko \nDiq starts production at the end of 2008, it will contribute almost PRs2 billion per year as royalty. \nDuddar, which is expected to start production in the next 2 months, will contribute an additional \nPRs300 million. \n \n\n                                                 \n19  Rahdari is a form of permission to transport the minerals from mines. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n52.  Major increases in royalties are expected after 2010\u20132012. Large concessions that are \ncurrently  being  explored  are  expected  to  be  in  production  after  2010.  These  include  five \ncompanies that are prospecting for copper and gold in Chaghi, and two that are prospecting for \niron ore. The companies are from the United Kingdom (two), Pakistan (two), Canada, Australia, \nand United Arab Emirates. \n \n\n3. \n\nGoverning and Related Institutions  \n\n \n\na.  \n\nMines and Minerals Department \n\n \n \n \n53. \nactivities. The main functions of MMD include the following: \n \n\nThe  GOB  created  the  MMD  in  March  2002  to  facilitate  exploration  and  production \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\napplication of the Balochistan Minerals Rules 2002, \ngrant of mineral concessions, \ncollection of royalty and the resolution of boundary disputes,  \nimplementation of development projects in the mines and minerals sector, and \ntechnical assistance to mine owners as and when needed. \n\nThe  MMD  has  three  technical  wings:  the  Directorate  General  of  Mines  and  Minerals, \n\n \n54. \nThe MMD is administratively organized into three sections, which deal respectively with \nconcessions, exploration, and administration. The concessions section is responsible for issuing \nfour types of mining licenses, as provided for in the NMP. The exploration section is responsible \nfor  delivering  marketing  support  for  priority  minerals.  The  administration  and  coordination \nsection is responsible for day-to-day administration. \n \n55. \nInspectorate of Mines, and Mines Labor Welfare Organization. \n  \nThe Directorate General of Mines and Minerals is responsible for granting concessions, \n56. \nenforcing the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, collecting royalties, and resolving disputes \nin  addition  to  providing  technical  advice,  if  required,  to  mine  owners.  The  directorate  is  also \nresponsible for  carrying  out  any  development  projects  for  which  the  Department  of  Mines  and \nMinerals  is  the  implementing  agency.  The  directorate  is  headed  by  a  director  general,  who  is \nqualified as a mining engineer. The directorate has regional offices at Hub and Loralai, but the \nentire process of granting of concessions is centralized with the director general and has to be \ncompleted in Quetta. \n \n57. \nThe Inspectorate of Mines is responsible for the enforcement of relevant safety laws in \nmining  operations.20  The  inspectorate  consists  of  an  inspection  wing,  which  is  responsible  for \nperiodic  inspection  of  mines;  and  a  mine  rescue  and  safety  wing,  which  is  responsible  for \nproviding  emergency  services  and  supervising  rescue  operations,  if  required,  and  conducting \nmine safety training programs for supervisory staff of mines.  \n \n58. \nThe  Mines  Labor  Welfare  Organization  is  responsible  for  the  administration  of  welfare \nprograms for mine  workers. It collects excise duty under the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour \nWelfare)  Act,  1967,  on  rates  fixed  by  the  federal  Government,  and  uses  the  proceeds  to  fund \nwelfare facilities for mine workers. The organization is running 3 high schools, 6 middle schools, \n\n                                                 \n20  These  laws  include  the  Mines  Act,  1923;  Coal  Mines  Regulation,  1926;  Metaliferous  Mines  Regulations,  1926; \n\nConsolidated Mines Rules 1952; and the Electricity Rules 1937. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                                                                    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n51\n\nand 11 primary schools for free education of mine workers\u2019 children; a 25-bed hospital and 15 \ndispensaries; and recreation facilities.  \n \n59. \nAccording to the NMP, a Mineral Investment Facilitation Authority was to be established \nin Balochistan, with the MMD serving as the secretariat. The authority has not been established. \nThe  NMP  provides  for  such  authorities  in  each  province,  each  of  which  would  have \nresponsibility for monitoring and regulatory review  of public sector mineral activities, reviewing \nthe  progress  in  granting  concessions,  introducing  capacity  development  programs  for  the \nsector,  and  encouraging  private  sector  investment  in  the  mining  industry.  Some  of  these \nenvisioned activities would overlap with existing responsibilities of the three wings of the MMD. \n \n\nb. \n\nGovernment Corporations Involved in the Minerals Sector \n\n \n60.  Mining  is  a  provincial  subject,  but  the  MMD  receives  support  on  policy  and  planning \nissues from the mineral wing of the Federal Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources. Other \nfederal  agencies  providing  technical  support  include  the  Geological  Survey  of  Pakistan,  which \nundertakes  geological  mapping  all  over  the  country;  and  the  Pakistan  Mineral  Development \nCorporation, which explores, plans, develops, and operates mining ventures in Pakistan, often \nin collaboration with national and international public and private sector partners.   \n \nIn  addition,  the  Balochistan  Development  Authority  is  involved  in  the  development  of \n61. \nmineral  resources  of  the  province.  Established  in  1974,  it  is  a  semiautonomous  body  working \nunder the P&DD. The organization has the authority to plan, promote, organize, and implement \nprojects  in  the  minerals  sector.  Currently,  the  organization  has  entered  into  two  joint  venture \npartnerships  for  mineral  exploration  with  foreign  companies,  including  the  exploration  and \nmining of copper and gold deposits in Reko Diq, and the exploration and mining of lead in the \nDuddar mines of Lasbela.  \n \n\n4.  \n\nCurrent Allocation of Mineral Exploration and Mining Rights: Large- and \nSmall-Scale Mining  \n\n \n62. \nAreas smaller than 4.05 square kilometers are termed small concessions in Balochistan, \nwhile  others  are  considered  large  concessions.  Currently,  the  province  has  28  large \nconcessions  at  various  stages  of  mining  and  exploration.  In  general,  mining  in  Balochistan  is \ncharacterized by the proliferation of small-scale operations.  \n \nAs  of  30  June  2006,  the  GOB  had  granted  697  prospecting  licenses  and  384  mining \n63. \nleases for a total of 1,081 concessions for the exploration of 41 minerals. By 31 May 2008, the \nnumber  of  concessions  had  increased  to  1,237.  The  largest  number  of  leases  is  for  coal \nmining\u2014147  prospecting  and  221  mining  leases  for  coal  had  been  granted  as  of  June  2006. \nThe number of leases for the exploration of onyx and marble is also significant\u201483 prospecting \nand  29  mining  leases  for  onyx,  and  174  prospecting  and  34  mining  leases  for  marble.  The \ngovernment  also  granted  54  prospecting  and  mining  leases  for  granite,  and  65  leases  for \nprospecting and mining of limestone.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nSTATUS OF PENDING CONDITIONS UNDER  \nTHE FIRST BALOCHISTAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\n \n1. \nIt is expected that by loan effectiveness, the government of Balochistan (GOB) will have \ncompleted  all  agreed  actions  for  four  outstanding  conditions  under  the  first  Balochistan \nResource Management Program (BRMP I). On the provincial finance commission (PFC) award \ntranche  condition  (item  (i)  in  Table  A4),  the  government  approved  the  3-year  PFC  award, \nalthough delayed by a year, in 2006; and some district governments used savings from the PFC \nawards  for  development  expenditures.  Hence,  the  substance  required  under  this  tranche \ncondition  has  been  satisfied.  The  GOB  has  moved  forward  in  rationalizing  the  Public  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (PSDP)  with  the  full  cost  review  of  all  incomplete  schemes  and  the \nexpected  reduction  in  throw  forward,  excluding  mega  projects,  to  2.5  years  in  FY2009  (item \n(ii) in  Table  A4).  The  overlapping  of  mandates  in  devolved  schemes  has  been  significantly \nreduced, but cannot be fully eliminated in Balochistan or in the rest of Pakistan. It is expected \nthat  the  study  on  contingent  liabilities  will  be  completed  by  December  2008  (item  (iii)  in  Table \nA4). The private sector strategy will be finalized by December 2008 (item (iv) in Table A4). \n \nProgress has been made toward complying with three conditions in which most agreed \n2. \nactions  will  be  completed  by  loan  effectiveness.  Advanced  progress  has  been  made  with \nrespect  to  enhancement  of  revenue  yields  (item  (v)  in  Table  A4).  The  action  plan  on  Abiana \nrecovery is expected to be completed by February 2009.1 However, the third party assessment \nof the property tax registers cannot be undertaken because the regular 5-year property survey \nof  the  GOB  will  be  completed  only  by  June  2009.  The  government  has  prepared  the  draft \nprocurement  law  (item  (vi)  in  Table  A4)  and  will  submit  it  to  the  Provincial  Assembly  by  loan \neffectiveness. Implementing rules will be subsequently issued. However, procurement manuals \nwill take time to prepare and approve. The mountain valley management plans will be finalized \nby December 2008, but their adoption will take more time (item (vii) in Table A4). \n \n3. \nThe two remaining conditions will not be met during implementation of subprogram 1 of \nBRMP  II  because  of  changes  in  policy  direction  and  time  constraints.  The  agreed  action  to \nstrengthen local institutional capacity for training (item (viii) in Table A4), which was to be done \nthrough  the  grant  of  autonomy  to  the  Rural  Development  Academy,  is  no  longer  possible \nbecause of a change in policy direction. With the lack of basic capacity within the academy to \nconduct training, the GOB does not believe that granting autonomy to the academy will have a \nsignificant  impact  in  developing  local  government  capacity.  In  terms  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  yardsticks  (item  (ix)  in  Table  A4),  those  developed  for  the  road  sector  were \ndeemed to be of poor quality as they did not comply with the communication and works manual, \nand yielded unrealistic budget estimates when applied. Consequently, the GOB did not accept \nthem.  Therefore,  pushing  for  the  implementation  of  such  yardsticks  is  not  possible  unless \nanother review is undertaken. New TA support can be considered to support a new diagnostic \nstudy. \n \n4. \nIn  addition  to  the  second-tranche  release  conditions  that  were  not  fully  complied  with, \nthe program progress report raised concern over the increase in the property tax exemption for \nself-occupied  properties  from  139.35  square  meters  (1,500  square  feet)  to  464.52  square \nmeters (5,000 square feet). Lowering the exemption at this time would not be possible because \nthis  requires  the  promulgation  of  an  act  but  given  the  economic  situation  in  Pakistan  and \ncalamity in Balochistan, persuading the majority of the huge coalition government to take such \naction would be difficult. Nonetheless, foregone revenue arising from the higher exemption has \nnot been significant (para. 10 in the main text of the RRP). \n \n \n                                                 \n1   Abiana refers to the user charges collected by the GOB on utilization of water from canals for irrigation purposes. \n \n\n\fTable A4: Substantially and Partially Complied With Second Tranche Conditions of BRMP I \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n53 \n\nCompliance \nStatus During \nTranche \nRelease  \n(April 2007) \n\n \n \nMission Findings on Pending Agreed Actions \n(November 2008) \n\nSubstantially \ncomplied with \n\nFully complied.

For example, almost all the attempts \nto provide relatively sophisticated services on a permanent basis at primary care health facilities \nhave  been  futile.  Similarly,  efforts  at  providing  secondary  and  higher  school  facilities  in  areas \nnot well serviced by public transport are not likely to succeed.  \n \n2. \nWeak  Capacity  in  Local  Governments.  The  Devolution  Plan  of  2000  introduces \nextensive administrative and fiscal restructuring, as well as revisions to rules, regulations, and \nlegislation.  It  also  places  considerable  demands  on  local  government  staff,  who  have \ntraditionally had little exposure to financial management or decision making, and who typically \ndo not have the required level of technical expertise. These problems are particularly acute in \nBalochistan because of its low level of human resource development, as well as its hierarchical \nsocial structure, which discourages innovation and initiative. \n \n3. \nLack  of  Coordination  in  Training  Programs.  The  lack  of  coordination  of  training \nprograms  in  the  province  hampers  human  resource  development.  For  instance,  the  Human \nResource  Development  Directorate  of  the  Health  Department  is  the  focal  point  for  training \nactivities  in  the  health  sector.  However,  the  Health  Department,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs),  and  district  governments  conduct  training  without  the  knowledge  of  the  Human \nResource Development Directorate. An integrated database has not been set up. Consequently, \ntraining programs overlap and scarce resources are wasted. \n \n4. \nFunding  Constraints  Faced  by  District  Governments.  District  governments,  which \ndepend  heavily  on  the  transfers  from  the  provincial  government,  provide  basic  education  and \nhealth services. Each district\u2019s allocation is based on current expenditure parameters. Transfers \ntend  to  be  limited  by  the  fiscal  constraints  faced  by  the  GOB.  Some  district  governments  are \nable to save on these one-line transfers, and fund development schemes. In general, however, \nthe available funding is insufficient to finance significant improvements in the delivery of social \nservices. The GOB implements health and education development schemes that cover multiple \ndistricts  or  receive  foreign  assistance.  Attempts  at  compensating  this  shortfall  through \nperformance grants have also faced challenges. Access conditions for performance grants are \nfairly  stringent,  and  district  administrations  seldom  meet  all  the  requirements.  In  cases  where \nthe  conditions  are  met  on  paper,  there  is  little  guarantee  that  they  will  be  implemented  in \npractice. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nDepending  on  the  outcomes  of  the  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program \n(BDSSP),  subprogram  2  of  BRMP  II  may  provide  continuity  in  reforms.  The  ongoing  BDSSP \naims to improve service delivery through the following key reform areas: (i) provincial efficiency, \n(ii) managerial power, (iii) citizens\u2019 voice and empowerment, and (iv) private sector engagement. \nPossible  follow  up  actions  may  aim  to  improve  service  delivery  in  the  education  and  health \nsectors  by  (i)  improving  coordination  of  human  resource  development,  (ii)  improving  and \nexpanding the quantitative service delivery survey (QSDS), (iii) developing guidelines for public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  contracts,  and  (iv)  providing  incentives  for  implementing  non-salary \nexpenditure allocation norms. \n \n\nReforms to Strengthen Social Service Delivery \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n67 \n\n1. \n\nImprove Human Resource Development Coordination in Education and \nHealth \n\n \n6. \nThe quality of social sector service delivery depends heavily on the capacity of front-end \nservice providers, who need regular in-service training opportunities to keep their skills current. \nBDSSP  has  strengthened  the  framework  for  improving  the  quality  of  social  services  and  the \nmanagerial  capacity  of  district  and  facility  managers.  Building  on  the  human  resource  action \nplans  developed  under  BDSSP,  future  reforms  may  focus  on  human  resource  development \ncoordination. The Health Department can review departmental mechanisms for coordinating all \ntraining  in  respective  sectors.  The  review  should  also  identify  training  needs,  both  in  terms  of \nexpertise and region; and groups in different districts should be invited to participate. The Health \nDepartment can designate a unit to coordinate the training programs. A functional database can \nbe developed, which classifies training by duration, skills imparted, region, number and level of \npersonnel  trained,  and  any  other  parameters  that  the  Health  Department  may  consider \nnecessary. This will reduce the duplication of training offered to government staff. \n \n\n2. \n\nRefine and Expand the Quantitative Service Delivery Survey \n\n \n7. \nThe  absence  of  comprehensive  monitoring  remains  a  weak  link  in  the  chain  of  social \nservice delivery, and precludes meaningful improvements in services for end users. BDSSP has \ndeveloped  the  QSDS  and  citizen  report  cards,  through  which  citizens\u2019  demands  for  social \nservices  can  be  heard.  Pilot  surveys  are  to  be  conducted  under  BDSSP,  and  findings  will \nprovide  feedback  to  guide  policy  direction  for  provincial  and  district  governments.  A  possible \nfuture reform action is the refinement and expansion of the QSDS to  at least 15 districts. The \nrollout  of  the  QSDS  is  expected  to  strengthen  monitoring  of  service  delivery,  as  well  as \ninstitutionalize the feedback mechanism from civil society.  \n\n \nFacilitate Private Sector Participation in Service Delivery \n\n3. \n\n \n8. \nPublic  sector  resources  are  insufficient  to  meet  service  delivery  needs  in  the  province. \nAs  such,  private  and  nonprofit  institutions  must  be  involved  in  delivering  basic  services. \nDeveloping private sector participation in service delivery is a key reform area under BDSSP. A \nfollow up program to BDSSP may help the GOB expand private sector participation. Guidelines \nfor  developing  public\u2013private  partnership  contracts  may  be  developed  to  facilitate  and \nencourage  the  GOB  in  identifying  and  engaging  with  potential  sources  of  private  sector \nparticipation,  which  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  service  delivery  and  offset  the  cost.  The \nguidelines can include details on the types of partnerships that may be pursued (management \ncontracts,  outsourcing  of  some  services,  build-own-operate-transfer  schemes),  prototypes  of \ncontracts,  and  details  on  examples  of  how  such  partnerships  operate  in  other  parts  of  the \ncountry.  \n  \n\n4. \n\nOffer Incentives to Use Expenditure Allocation Norms in Line with Minimum \nService Delivery Standards \n\n \nTo  improve  the  predictability  and  adequacy  of  social  sector  funding  in  line  with  agreed \n9. \nupon minimum service delivery standards, expenditure allocation norms were prepared for the \nfirst  tranche  release  of  BDSSP,  and  these  are  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  Finance \nDepartment for release of the second tranche. Future reform actions may be needed to help the \nGOB  introduce  performance  grants  to  district  governments  as  an  incentive  for  using  the \nexpenditure allocation norms in their budgets. \n\n \n\n\f \n68 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n\nNo withdrawals shall be made for the following: \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  included  in  the  following  groups  or  subgroups  of  the \nUnited  Nations  Standard  International  Trade  Classification,  Revision  3  (SITC, \nRev.  3),  or  any  successor  groups  or  subgroups  under  future  revisions  in  the \nSITC, as designated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the Borrower: \n\nChapter  Heading \n\nDescription of Items \n\nTable A8: Ineligible Items \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n718.7 \n\nAlcoholic beverages \nTobacco, unmanufactured; tobacco refuse \nTobacco, manufactured (whether or not containing tobacco \nsubstitute \nRadioactive and associated materials \nPearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or \nworked \nNuclear reactors, and parts thereof, fuel elements (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \n\n728.43  Tobacco processing machinery \n897.3 \n\nJewelry of gold, silver, or platinum-group metals (except \nwatches and watch cases) and goldsmiths\u2019 or silversmiths\u2019 \nwares (including set gems) \nGold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ore and concentrates) \n\n \n\n971 \nSource: United Nations. \n \n(ii) \n\nexpenditures  in  the  currency  of  the  Borrower  or  of  goods  supplied  from  the \nterritory of the Borrower;  \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  supplied  under  a  contract  that  any  national  or \ninternational  financing  institution  or  agency  will  have  financed  or  has  agreed  to \nfinance, including any contract financed under any ADB loan;  \n\nexpenditures  for  goods  intended  for  a  military  or  paramilitary  purpose  or  for \nluxury consumption;  \n\nexpenditures for narcotics;  \n\nexpenditures  for  environmentally  hazardous  goods,  the  manufacture,  use,  or \nimport  of  which  is  prohibited  under  the  laws  of  the  Borrower  or  international \nagreements to which the Borrower is a party; and \n\nexpenditures  on  account  of  any  payment  prohibited  by  the  Borrower  in \ncompliance  with  a  decision  of  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  taken  under \nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n112 \n121 \n122 \n\n525 \n667 \n\n718 \n\n728 \n897 \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n69 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SUPPORTING  \nTHE SECOND BALOCHISTAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n \n\n(v) \n\nin  mineral \n\nforecasting, \n\ntransparency \n\nimprovement  of \n\nImpact and Purpose \n\nMethodology and Key Activities \n\nthe  Mines  and  Minerals  Department \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe purpose of the technical assistance (TA) grant is to support the implementation of \nthe Second Balochistan Resource Management Program (BRMP II).

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nIn  2004,  the  government  of  Balochistan  (GOB)  released  the  Balochistan  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper  (B-PRSP), \nwhich  identifies  inclusive  growth  as  the  main  strategy  for  reducing  poverty  in  the  province.  It  is  underpinned  by  five \npillars:  engendering  growth,  managing  the  scarce  water  resources,  achieving  governance  reforms,  improving  human \ndevelopment,  and  addressing  vulnerability  to  shocks.  Based  on  data  from  the  mid-1990s  to  2001,  the  B-PRSP \nindicates  that  poverty  in  Balochistan  is  severe,  due  in  large  part  to  the  interaction  of  social  (including  political), \neconomic,  and  environmental  factors.  Social  indicators,  including  literacy,  life  expectancy,  and  health  activities, \nreportedly are among the lowest in the world. Economic challenges arise from the lack of economic activity, investment \nand  capital  accumulation,  compounded  by  poor  governance  and  weak  coordination  across  and  between  levels  of \ngovernment. Furthermore, Balochistan covers 347,000 square kilometers with limited fertile land and water resources, \nand an extremely low population density, making the province a challenging environment for service delivery.  \n \nThe  country  strategy  and  program  update  for  Pakistan  2006\u20132008a  indicates  that  assistance  will  be  provided  to \nconsolidate improvements in performance in the social sectors through province-based support for social sectors and \nprovincial resource management programs. In this respect, the Second Balochistan Resource Management Program \n(BRMP  II)  is  aligned  with  the  country  strategy  and  program  update  and  earlier  programs  related  to  resource \nmanagement and service delivery. BRMP and the Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program (BDSSP) aimed to \nassist the province with its strategy of inclusive growth to reduce poverty. The BRMP aimed to reform public finances \nand financial management by introducing poverty-related criteria in the allocation of development expenditures and the \nPublic  Sector  Development  Program.  BRMP  also  aimed  to  reform  social  services,  particularly  in  the  health  sector. \nBDSSP aimed to assist Balochistan\u2019s progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in health, education, \nand water supply and sanitation (WSS) by (i) increasing access to affordable, effective, and quality social services in \nthe  public  and  private  sectors;  (ii)  reducing  disparities  in  access;  and  (iii)  strengthening  local  governments,  private \nsector,  and  communities  in  providing  services.  BRMP  II  continues  with  reforms  initiated  under  these  programs;  its \nobjective  is  to  remove  growth  impediments  and  improve  fiscal  resource  mobilization.  The  resulting  improvements  in \nresource  flows  will  then  promote  further  improvements  in  social  service  delivery.  The  three  core  policy  objectives  of \nBRMP II are (i) improve public financial management, (ii) develop an affordable and sustainable pension and employee \nbenefit system, and (iii) enhance government\u2019s role as facilitator of minerals sector growth. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                              Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues \n \nAccording  to  primary  data  from  Pakistan\u2019s  household  surveys  of  1998\u20131999,  2001\u20132002,  and  2004\u20132005,  the \nincidence, intensity, and severity of poverty have increased considerably in Balochistan.b The incidence of poverty in \nthe province rose from 21.6% in 1998\u20131999 to 33.1% in 2004\u20132005. The worsening situation in rural areas accounted \nfor the overall increase in the province; urban poverty levels remained stagnant. Although the increase in poverty from \n1998\u20131999 to 2001\u20132002 may be attributed to the severe drought that increased poverty across all provinces, poverty \ncontinued to rise over the subsequent 3 years. While statistics on the incidence of poverty are not yet available beyond \n2004\u20132005, some social sector statistics related to the MDGs seem to indicate improvement since 2004. According to \nthe Pakistan social and living standards measurement survey (PSLM), which monitors the implementation of the MDGs \nand PRSP, education statistics have improved. Literacy increased from 37% in 2004\u20132005 to 42% in 2006\u20132007, while \nthe  gross  enrollment  rate  at  the  primary  level  rose  from  65%  in  to  70%  in  that  period.  PSLM  statistics  for  the  health \nsector  indicate  an  increase  in  immunization  rates  among  children,  and  a  larger  percentage  of  children  received \ntreatment for diarrhea. The rate of prenatal and postnatal consultations also increased.  \n \n2. Design Features \n \nBRMP  II  seeks  to  strengthen  the  link  between  the  development  budget  and  poverty  and  economic  strategies  by \nensuring that the GOB adopts the B-PRSP II as a medium-term economic development strategy, and that the Public \n\n \n\n\f \n76 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSector  Development  Program  is  aligned  with  this  strategy.  It  will  also  include  the  improvement  and  expansion  of  the \npublic expenditure tracking survey to more districts. \n\nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n \n\n1.  Better  resource  mobilization  and  allocation,  as  well  as  internal  controls  by  the  GOB,  will  result  in  more \n\ngovernment efficiency. This will result in more effective services available to the public. \n\nThe program has no adverse impact on vulnerable groups. \n\n \n2. \n \n3.  By improving public financial management (revenue generation, better expenditure management, and stronger \ninternal controls), BRMP II creates more fiscal space that can be used for pro-poor expenditures. BRMP II also \naims  to  make  pension  payments  off  budget  and  fully  funded  by  separate  financially  viable  and  sustainable \npension and general provident funds. These also will address fiscal problems posed pension liabilities, creating \nadditional  resources  for  pro-poor  spending.  By  facilitating  more  private  sector  involvement  in  the  minerals \nsector, employment is generated around mining concessions. A well-designed contract also will support benefit-\nsharing  programs  that  will  result  in  gains  by  communities  around  those  concessions,  while  ensuring  that  the \nproper environment and labor safeguards are put in place. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nBRMP  II  is  intended  to  address  government  inefficiencies  arising  from  weak  public  financial  management.  As  such, \nspecific beneficiaries are not targeted. Reform under the program is expected to benefit the public, including the poor \nand vulnerable. One area that may have a social impact is addressing the weak financial position of the GOB, which \nresults in insufficient resources to fund social expenditures. Ministry of Finance data on PRSP expenditures for FY2007 \nshow that education accounted for 6.7% of total spending, while health accounted for 21%\u2014both are the lowest among \nall  Pakistan\u2019s  provinces.  By  improving  resource  mobilization  and  allocation,  and  complementing  these  with  better \ninternal expenditure controls, financial flows can effectively benefit the public. The GOB will be able to fully utilized its \nresources,  and  allocate  them  in  a  way  that  is  more  responsive  to  citizens\u2019  needs.  In  addition  to  these  reforms,  the \nGovernment  will  be  encouraged,  through  policy  dialogue,  to  target  the  most  deprived  districts  in  the  allocation  of \ncounterpart funds generated from the  loan proceeds through the  performance grant mechanism. The GOB and ADB \ndiscussed  the  possibility  of  expanding  the  scope  of  subprogram  2  of  BRMP  II  to  cover  reforms  on  social  service \ndelivery to provide continuity to BDSSP. However, this will depend on the outcomes of BDSSP. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  During  program  preparation,  extensive  consultations  were  conducted  with  the  GOB    including,  Balochistan \nDevelopment  Authority,  Balochistan  Health  Foundation,  Board  of  Revenue,  Education  Department,  Excise  and \nTaxation  Department,  Finance  Department,  Local  Government  Department,  Health  Department,  Irrigation  and  Power \nDepartment,  Mines  and  Minerals  Department,  Planning  and  Development  Department,  and  selected  district \ngovernments. Meetings with private mining companies were also conducted to gather private sector views on minerals \nsector  development.  Meetings  also  were  held  with  other  development  partners  (World  Bank  and  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom) to ensure development partner coordination. \n \nDiscussions  on  service  delivery  issues,  such  as  human  resource  development,  financial  flows  to  the  health  and \neducation  sectors,  weaknesses  in  service  delivery  mechanisms,  were  undertaken  with  the  Balochistan  Health \nFoundation,  Education  Department,  Finance  Department,  Health  Department,  and  Planning  and  Development \nDepartment to identify problems and possible solutions. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing    \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making   \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3. Was a consultation and participation plan prepared? \n \nA formal consultation and participation plan was not prepared because the program preparation is straightforward and \nwill  only  necessitate  meetings  with  key  government  departments.  A  list  of  key  agencies  to  be  consulted  is  drawn  up \nbefore loan processing missions.  \n \n \n \n \n\n Yes  \n\n No  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10     77 \n \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. \n\n \n\nBRMP  II  has  no  specific  gender  implications.  The  GOB  intends  to  use  part  of  the  counterpart  funds  generated  from \nproceeds  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  for  development  spending  channeled  through  performance  grants.  In \nthe past, the GOB had used the performance grants to provide girls with access to primary education. \n2.
