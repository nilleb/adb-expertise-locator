The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance \n(TA)  for  Strengthening  Biodiversity  Protection  and  Management  in  the  Nam  Ngum  3 \nHydropower Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. 1  \n \n2. \nIt is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide two project loans to the \nGovernment  of  the  Lao  PDR  to  support  the  development  of  the  Nam Ngum 3  Hydropower \nProject and associated dedicated transmission facilities in the Lao PDR for exporting electricity \nto Thailand. The government  will  use  the funds for  its  equity  share  in the  440-megawatt (MW) \nbuild\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer  Nam  Ngum 3  hydropower  plant  (NN3).  The  proposed  project  will \n(i) potentially  provide  revenue  flows  to  the  government  in  the  form  of  taxes,  royalties,  and \ndividends  currently  estimated  at  $771  million  over  the  27  year  concession  period;  (ii) increase \nregional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS); (iii) promote economic growth in \nthe  Lao  PDR  through  private  sector  investment,  technology  transfer,  employment  generation, \nand  local  infrastructure  development;  and  (iv) ensure  sustainable  development  in  northeast \nThailand  by  achieving  energy  security  and  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  Nam \nNgum 3  Power  Company  (NN3PC)  will  sell  to  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand \n(EGAT) on average 2,072 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually from NN3, which, if generated by the \nThai  power  system,  would  annually  create  1 million  tons  of  carbon-dioxide  emissions.  The \nproposed NN3  would be  the  second  large-scale hydropower  plant  to  receive  ADB  financing in \nthe Lao PDR, following Nam Theun 2, which was approved in 2005. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nHydropower  is  the  major  source  of  electricity  in  the  Lao  PDR,  providing  stable  and \ninexpensive  supplies.  Today,  the  Lao  PDR  has  harnessed  2,530 MW  of  its  estimated \n18,000 MW hydropower capacity, or 14%. About 520 MW is consumed within  the country; the \nremaining is exported. Present electrification rate is 64%, and the government plans to achieve \nan  electrification  ratio  of  90%  by  2020.  The  government  has  signed  memoranda  of \nunderstanding  with  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam  to  export  to  each  of  these  countries  up  to \n7 gigawatts  and  5 gigawatts respectively.  The government  has  decided to  hold minority  equity \nstakes in export-oriented projects to enhance the revenues it receives and allow it to ensure that \nany  adverse  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  projects  are  mitigated  effectively  and \nsustainably.  However,  the  government  does  not  have  the  resources  to  raise  the  financing \nrequired  to  build  these  projects  on  its  own,  and  needs  to  mobilize  financing  from  the  private \nsector through public\u2013private partnership (PPP). The project is located upstream of two existing \nhydropower plants on the Nam Ngum,2 a tributary to the Mekong, and is considered as a PPP in \nview  of  close  cooperation between the government  and  its  private  sector  partners  in  the  NN3. \nThe PPP mechanism for power projects primarily revolve on the build-operate-transfer concept \nwith  the  off-taker  entering  into  long-term  power  purchase  agreements  which  guarantee  cost \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   As nam means river in Lao, throughout this report names starting with nam indicate the name of a river, e.g., Nam \n\nNgum River. Likewise, ban means village as the first word of a name. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nrecovery  power  purchase  price.  The  success  of  the  Nam  Theun  2  Hydroelectric  Project3 in \nattracting  private  financing  has  encouraged  the  development  of  several  other  hydropower \nprojects as PPPs. The construction of 750 MW of hydropower capacity is under way as PPPs. \nIncluding  the  proposed  NN3,  9,500 MW  of  hydropower  capacity  is  at  various  stages  of  pre-\nconstruction development.  \n \n4. \nThailand\u2019s  electricity  is  generated  mainly  by  thermal  power  plants  that  burn  the  fossil \nfuels  natural  gas  and  lignite,  as  Thailand  has  limited  hydropower  and  other  renewable  energy \n(solar,  biomass  and  wind)  sources  to  meet  the  demand  growth.  Installed  capacity  in  Thailand \nwas 29,212 MW in 2009, and peak demand for power reached 22,315 MW. The Thailand Power \nDevelopment Plan, 2010, which runs from 2010 to 2030, estimates that the country will need an \nadditional  21,564 MW  of  electricity-generating  capacity  by  2020  to  maintain  economic  growth. \nThe plan envisions sourcing more than 5 GW from neighboring countries. The proposed NN3 is \none  of  the  hydropower  sources  from  which  Thailand  intends  to  import  electricity  starting  in \nJanuary 2017.  \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP),4 2007\u20132011 for the Lao PDR aligns with the \n5. \ngovernment\u2019s Sixth Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010, which prioritizes developing \nagriculture and natural resources, education, health, and infrastructure. It incorporates the GMS \nstrategy  to  foster  connectivity,  promote  large-scale  foreign  direct  investment,  and  create \nregional public goods. The CSP midterm review, 5 2007\u20132011 for the Lao PDR recognizes the \nimportance of developing hydropower for export to generate foreign currency revenues for the \ngovernment  through  royalties,  taxes,  and  dividends  on  its  equity  investment.  The  PPP \nhydropower projects being developed will help to broaden social and economic development by \nexpanding  the  government\u2019s  revenue  base.  The  NN3  loan  is  listed  as  firm  in  the  country \noperations and business plan for 2011. The regional cooperation business plan, 2010\u201320126 for \nthe GMS has four pillars, two of which the project addresses: (i) integrating national markets to \npromote  economic  efficiency  and  private  sector  development,  and  (ii) managing \nthe \nenvironment  and  shared  natural  resources  to  help  ensure  sustainable  development  and  the \nconservation  of  natural  resources.  The  project  will  contribute  to  achieving  these  objectives  by \nproviding low-cost and renewable energy to meet rising demand in Thailand, and by contributing \nto the foreign exchange revenues of the Lao PDR, which will provide funds needed to meet its \npoverty-reduction goals. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be increased financial resources for the Government of the Lao PDR to \n6. \nallocate  for  socioeconomic  development  and  increased  access  to  environmentally  sustainable \nrenewable energy in Thailand. The outcome is increased regional cooperation between the Lao \nPDR and Thailand through the trade of clean energy. \n \n\n                                                \n3   ADB.  2005.

The Lao PDR is a group A country, fully eligible for \nAsian Development Fund financing. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof  7  years,7 an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (with \ninterest and other charges during construction capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  OCR  loan  is  deemed \nappropriate for the Lao PDR in this case in view of the commercial characteristics of the project \nand its ability to earn the government revenue in foreign currency. \n \n10. \nThe  government  has  further  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR10,619,000  million  ($16.9  million  equivalent) from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds resources  to  help \nfinance the project.

The  project  forms  a \ncascade with other projects planned, existing, and under construction in the Nam Ngum Basin.14  \nLocated  about  115  kilometer  (km)  north  of  Vientiane  on  the  Nam  Ngum,  it  consists  of  a  220 \nmeter high concrete-faced rockfill dam, a 10.6 km tunnel, an underground power station with an \ninstalled capacity of 440 MW, and nearly 1 km tailrace tunnel conveying the water back to the \nNam Ngum. The distance from the power house to the confluence with the Mekong is about 256 \nkm, of which 72 km is occupied by the Nam Ngum 1 and Nam Ngum 2 reservoirs, both totaling \n572 square kilometers of surface area at full supply level, located between the project and the \nMekong. The estimated mean annual energy generation of 2,114 GWh will be evacuated via a \n99 km,  500 kilovolts  double-circuit  transmission  line  to  the  planned  Nabong  substation,15 from \nwhere  it  will  be  delivered  to  EGAT  on  the  Lao  PDR\u2013Thailand  border.16 The  dam  will  create  a \nlong and narrow reservoir with a surface area of 27.5 square kilometers. The dam will be one of \nthe highest of its type in the world, and the highest in the Lao PDR. The technology of concrete-\nfaced rockfill dams is well understood. However, it has been decided to establish a Dam Safety \nReview Panel to ensure the safety of the project during construction and operation stages. The \ntechnology  of  the  chosen  Francis  turbines  is  also  mature  and  will  operate  within  well-known \nlimits.17 \n  \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \n\n[This  information  was  deemed  confidential  according  to  exception  #  9  of  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy.] \n\n                                                \n14  The plan calls for 14 hydropower plants in the Nam Ngum Basin; five already exist, and one is under construction. \n15  ADB.  2007.  Nabong  \u2013  Udon  Thani  Power  Transmission  Project,  (TA  7026-LAO,  $760,000,  approved  on  12 \n\nDecember 2007) \n\n16  The  Nam  Ngum  2  Hydropower  Company  has  already  built  and  owns  a  230  kV  switchyard  at  the  location  of  the \nNabong  substation  and  the,  500  kV  transmission  line  (27  km)  to  the  Lao  PDR\u2013Thai  border.  These  facilities  are \nrequired to evacuate the power generated by the Nam Ngum 2 hydropower plant. The Nabong facilities, to be used \nfor  common  power  evacuation  facilities  by  several  hydropower  plants  in  north\u2013central  Laos,  will  be  sold  to \nElectricit\u00e9  du  Laos,  to  allow  for  open  access. It  has  been proposed  that  ADB  finance,  under  a separate  loan  for \nBoard consideration in early 2012, the expansion of the Nabong substation and provide the funds to Electricit\u00e9 du \nLaos  to buy the existing facilities.  \n\n17 Summary Technical Description provides further technical details of the project.

As a holding company for \ngovernment  investments,  LHSE  does  not  directly  construct,  own,  or  operate  the  projects  it \ninvests  in.  Instead,  it  purchases  equity  in  the  special  purpose  company  established  for  each \nproject. LHSE has no direct role in project procurement or related disbursements. GMS Lao, the \nmain proponent in NN3PC, has ample experience in procurement using internationally accepted \nprocesses.  Further,  procurement  undertaken  so  far  for  the  project,  which  includes  the  three \nmain  contract  packages,  was  monitored  by  the  Lender\u2019s  Technical  Adviser  and  found  to  be \nacceptable by ADB. \n \n20. \nLHSE  has  previous  experience  with  ADB  and  other  development  partners  through  its \npurchase of equity in the Nam Theun 2 Power Company, which was funded with the proceeds \nof  grants  and  loans  from  ADB,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  International  Development  Association,  the \nEuropean Investment Bank, and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. Project implementation \nwas undertaken by the Nam Theun 2 Power Company, the project owner. LHSE\u2019s functions and \nresponsibilities were limited to disbursing loan proceeds used to fund its equity purchase in the \nproject.  ADB  assessed  LHSE\u2019s  performance  as  satisfactory.  As  a  shareholder  in  project \ncompanies,  LHSE  has  financial  management  systems  generally  sufficient  to  record,  monitor, \ncontrol, and report on project-related financial transactions. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and LHSE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n22. \nPoverty  in  the  Lao  PDR  has  strong  correlations  with  geography  and  ethnic  identity. \nWhile  poverty  has  declined  nationally,  58%  of  households  in  northern  provinces  are  poor, \ncompared  with  4.4%  in  Vientiane  Capital.  This  is  partly  because  of  mountainous  terrain  and \naccess  difficulties,  and  partly  because  a  higher  proportion  of  ethnic  minorities  in  these  areas. \nPoverty  incidence  among  ethnic  minorities  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  40%\u201355%,  greater  than  in  the \nmajority  Lao  PDR-Thailand  rate  of  29%.  Almost  all  affected  people  in  the  project  impact  area \nare  ethnic  minorities,  whose  subsistence  livelihoods  depend  heavily  on  natural  resources. \nDirectly  and  indirectly  affected  communities  will  benefit  from  improved  access  to  markets, \nsecondary  education,  health-care  facilities,  with  the  provision  of  all-weather  roads,  and \nelectricity.  Xaysomboun  District\u2019s  economy  will  be  significantly  affected,  by  net  benefits  in  the \nform of accelerated economic growth, reduced poverty, and new jobs. Currently limited health-\ncare  infrastructure  and  services  in  affected  areas  will  be  upgraded  with  improved  year-round \n\n\f9 \n\naccess  and  services.  Also, resettled  households  will  be  assured  of  permanent tenure rights  to \nhousing and agricultural land, to protect their continued access to natural resources, which will \nbe a first in rural areas of Phoukout District. Details of resettlement and restoration management \nprocesses are in the resettlement and ethnic minority development plan. \n\nThe  influx  of  labor  and  camp  followers  will  apply  pressure  on  existing  sanitation  and \n23. \npublic  health  facilities,  while  increasing  the  risk  of  sexual  exploitation  of  women  and  the \nassociated  risk  of  HIV  transmission.  Ethnic  minority  women  and  children  are  typically  more \nvulnerable  to  exploitation.  The  project  has  developed  several  plans  described  in  the  EIA  to \nmitigate these issues.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\nThe project is classified category A18 for environment, for involuntary resettlement, and \n24. \nfor indigenous people under the SPS. The potential environment and social impacts and risks of \nthe  Project  and  its  associated  facilities  were  identified  and  assessed  in  the  Environmental \nImpact  Assessment  which  has  been  posed  on  ADB's  website  since  14  January  2011.  A \ncumulative  impact  assessment  for  the  Project  was  completed  in  2007.19 A  peer  review  was \nconducted  on  11  February  2011;  review  of  its  later  versions  were  undertaken  to  enhance \nmitigation measures and conservation and offset programs to meet SPS requirements.  NN3PC \nwill undertake an updated comprehensive biodiversity study on project areas commencing in the \nlast  quarter  of  2011  to  reconfirm  the  extent  of  conservation  and  offset  programs.  An \nIndependent  Advisory  Panel,  to  be  financed  by  ADB,  will  be  constituted  to  assist  the \ngovernment  evaluate  the  impacts  on  biodiversity,  assess  the  adequacy  of  recommended \nmeasures to achieve a no net loss of biodiversity and implement an effective biodiversity offset \nprograms.  Measures  to  address  the  social  impacts  of  the  project  are  described  in  the  draft \nResettlement and Ethnic Minority Development Plan which has been posted on ADB\u2019s website \non  6  June  2011.  The  directly  affected  Khmu  ethnic  community  living  in  Ban  Xiengdet  has \nprovided  broad  community  support  to  the  Project.  Such  support  is  documented  in  meeting \nagreements  and  household  level  consent  to  relocate  forms  authenticated  by  village  leaders. \nEffective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate and compensate for the adverse impacts, and to \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social protection requirements, are incorporated in the safeguard \nreports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  NN3PC  to  manage  project\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  risks  are  deemed  adequate,20 while collaboration  with the  NNRBC  is \nconsidered  crucial  in  managing  cumulative  impacts  at  the  river  basin  level.  Information \ndisclosure  and  consultations  have  been  and  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.21 The project benefits are expected to outweigh the mitigated risks. \n \n\n                                                \n18 http://www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/LAO/40514-LAO-TAR.pdf \n19  ADB.  2007.
