The population of the\ncountry  is  estimated  at  170,000,  a  figure  projected  from  the  last  census  (1991).    The\naverage population density is 56 persons per square km (km2), although a large majority\nof the people live in the coastal areas of the two main islands of Upolu (72 percent of the\npopulation)  and  Savai\u2019i  (27  percent).    About  35,000  people  (over  20  percent  of  the\npopulation) live in Apia, the capital, in Upolu. The country is geographically compact and\nhas  a  good  road  and  shipping  network.    Transport  between  and  within  islands  is\nrelatively easy, and access to Government services is generally good.\n\nLarge  external  emigration  flows,  averaging  over  2  percent  of  the  population\n3.\n(around 3,500 persons) annually, have kept the overall population growth relatively low\nin recent years. The majority of the emigrants are men aged 20-30 seeking employment\nabroad.    It  is  estimated  that  up  to  70  percent  of  Samoans  who  have  completed  post-\nsecondary  education  will  emigrate.  While  this  massive  emigration  of  well-educated\nSamoans  is  of  concern  to  the  Government,  it  is  also  recognized  that  remittance\ncontributions  from  Samoans  residing  abroad  continue  to  have  a  significant  positive\nimpact on the national economy and the balance of payments. Remittances are the most\nimportant and stable source of income in the economy and is the single most important\nsource of monetary income at the village level. They constitute a very important factor in\noffsetting  the  vulnerability  to  climatic  conditions,  crop  diseases,  and  volatile  world\nmarkets.\n\nSamoa has a total land area of 2,820 km2, with an exclusive economic zone of\n4.\n98,000 km2, the smallest in the Pacific.  About 43 percent of the land area is classified as\narable and about 75 percent of the population still use land and coastal resources as a\nmain  or  supplementary  source  of  income.  However,  Samoa  is  ecologically  fragile  and\nvulnerable  to  environmental  degradation  and  cyclones.  An  estimated  30  percent  of\nagricultural production takes place in areas with severe soil limitation and the clearing of\nsteeper slopes increases the vulnerability to erosion.\n\n5.\nSamoa has made reasonable economic progress in the past two decades. In the\n1980s  a  modest  economic  growth  averaging  about  1.7  percent  per  annum  was\nachieved. In the early 1990s real incomes weakened, reflecting the devastation caused\nby  two  major  cyclones  in  1990  and  1991,  and  the  adverse  impact  of  taro  leaf  blight\ndisease in 1993-1994. However, the economy subsequently recovered, with high growth\nrates in 1996-1997.  In 1999, the growth rate of the economy accelerated to 5.3 percent,\nfrom 3.4 percent in 1998, reflecting strong growth in commerce, hotels, and restaurants;\ntransportation  and  communication;  construction;  and  fisheries.  A  9  percent  increase  in\ntourist arrivals stimulated the commerce and transport sectors.\n\n\f2\n\nThe  Samoan  economy  is  still  largely  agriculture  based.  The  contribution  of\n6.\nagriculture  to  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  relatively  stable  over  1994-1998,\naveraging 18.7 percent. The majority of the population still relies on subsistence farming\nand  fishing  as  well  as  cash  crops,  such  as  copra,  taro,  cocoa,  and  bananas.    The\ncontribution of the public sector to GDP also remained relatively stable during the period\nand averaged 9.8 percent. While the contribution of industry to GDP steadily decreased\nfrom 30.7 percent in 1994 to about 23.7 percent in 1998, the contribution of the services\nsector expanded further from 41.3 percent in 1994 to 47.4 percent in 1998 (Appendix 1).\n\n7.\nEmployment  growth  was  modest  at  2  percent  between  1998  and  1999.  Formal\nsector  employment  growth  resulted  largely  from  increased  employment  in  public\nadministration,  accommodation  and \nfood\nmanufacturing.  The  rate  of  female  employment  growth  was  more  than  double  that  of\nmale  employment  growth  during  the  same  period.  From  1995  to  1999,  the  average\nannual  rate  of  formal  employment  growth  in  all  industries  exclusive  of  public\nadministration was 0.7 percent, while the rate for public administration was 0.5 percent.\nDespite  some  growth  in  private  sector  employment,  the  creation  of  private  sector\nemployment opportunities for new entrants to the labor force is an ongoing challenge.\n\nrestaurants,  personal  services,  and \n\nA.\n\nQuality of Life\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe vision expressed in the Government\u2019s Partnership for a Prosperous Society:\n8.\nA Statement of Economic Strategy 2000-2001 (SES) aims at improving the quality of life\nfor  all  Samoans.  Poverty  is  not  explicitly  mentioned  in  the  SES,  and  no  actions  in  the\nstrategy  are  aimed  directly  at  reducing  poverty.  Poverty,  in  the  absolute  sense,  is  not\nseen  as  a  critical  issue  in  the  Samoan  context.  Samoa  is  in  the  category  of  countries\nwith  medium-level  human  development.  Using  the  human  development  index  (HDI),\nwhich  encompasses  the  three  dimensions  of  longevity,  knowledge,  and  income,\nSamoa\u2019s  score  of  0.59  ranks  it  seventh  among  15  Pacific  Island  countries  and  117th\namong developing countries. Samoa exhibits a low level of poverty as measured by the\nhuman poverty index (HPI), which measures access to basic services. With a HPI of 8.6,\nSamoa again ranks seventh among 15 Pacific Island countries.1  The community-based\nsociocultural system generally ensures that no one is completely destitute.\n\nTo define the poverty situation in Samoa, the concept of relative poverty may be\n9.\nmore  appropriate  than  that  of  absolute  poverty,  which  would  imply  complete  material\ndeprivation.  In  Samoa  poverty  is  rarely  as  visible  and  as  extreme  as  it  is  in  the  poorer\ncountries  of  Asia.  But  relative  poverty  exists,  as  there  are  people  who  are  truly\ndisadvantaged and deprived compared with others in the community, or nation.\n\n10.\nConsidering  the  mix  of  traditional  subsistence  activities,  modest  cash  income\nactivities,  and  private  remittances  encountered  in  the  traditional  Samoan  society,  it  is\ndifficult to make a rigorous assessment of the existing poverty situation.  The household\nincome  and  expenditure  data  for  1972  and  1997,  however,  clearly  show  an  increasing\ninequality  of  income  distribution.  This  is  a  common  outcome  in  the  early  stages  of\n\n                                                \n1  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  1999.  Pacific Human Development Report 1999: Creating\n\nOpportunities.\n\n\f3\n\ndevelopment in market economies, and can change as growth becomes broader based\nand thus more inclusive.\n\n11.\nSamoa  is  a  small  island  country  with  a  very  small  economy.  Sustainable\nimprovements  in  livelihoods  are  constantly  threatened  by  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to\nexternal economic shocks and natural disasters. The Commonwealth vulnerability index\nranks  Samoa  in  the  group  of  countries  characterized  by  high  vulnerability.2  Sound\neconomic diversification may reduce the extent of aggregate export instability, and good\neconomic  management  can  prevent  general  macroeconomic  instability.  Measures  can\nalso be taken to improve preparedness for and responses to natural disasters. However,\nit must be acknowledged that cyclones like those experienced in 1990 and 1991 can, at\nleast  temporarily,  derail  the  reform  process  and  undermine  the  growth  needed  to\nimprove living standards.\n\n12.\nThe wage-earning sector makes up less than half of those who are classified as\neconomically active.  Urban village families are more likely to include at least one waged\nworker  compared  with  peri-urban  and  rural  villages.  At  the  village  level  the  economic\ndifferences between families are generally not significant. The two main groups who are\nlikely  to  be  vulnerable  to  poverty  are  urban  villagers  with  limited  land  for  subsistence\nproduction, and rural villagers with limited cash earning opportunities. Other vulnerable\ngroups include young people, particularly those with less formal education, households\nheaded by single women, the elderly, and the disabled.\n\nTo  achieve  equitable,  sustained,  and  sustainable  economic  growth, \n\n13.\nthe\nGovernment is committed to the implementation of a coherent set of strategies,3 which\nwere developed after extensive consultation with stakeholders. The close involvement of\nall societal groups ensures community ownership of the strategies, which should lead to\ntheir  efficient  implementation.    A  first  subset  of  strategies  promotes  pro-poor  economic\ngrowth through a stable macroeconomic environment, enhanced public sector efficiency,\nfaster private sector growth, sustainable tourism development, and supporting priorities\nsuch as economic infrastructure, investment in utilities, and environmental sustainability.\n\nThe  second  subset  of  strategies  is  targeted  more  directly  at  the  economically\n14.\nweaker  segments  and  vulnerable  groups  of  society.  This  subset  aims  to  improve\neducation  and  health  standards,  invigorate  the  agriculture  and  fisheries  sectors,\nrevitalize  the  village  economy,  improve  social  and  cultural  services,  and  promote\nmeasures aimed specifically at the youth, women, and the disadvantaged.  The strategy\nto  improve  education  standards  generally  aims  to  expand  access  and  equity.  The\nGovernment  is  also  implementing  major  new  initiatives,  which  will  have  more  direct\nimpact  on  poverty  reduction.  These  initiatives  include  upgrading  of  primary  education,\npromoting  greater  emphasis  on  vocational  skills  training  in  secondary  schools,\nsupporting  early  childhood  education  activities,  and  addressing  the  requirements  for\nspecial  needs  education.  Another  initiative  is  the  strengthening  of  school  management\ncommittees in the villages.\n\n                                                \n2  Commonwealth Secretariat/World Bank. 2000.

Statement of economic strategy 2000-2001, Partnership for a prosperous\n\nsociety. Government of Samoa, January 2000.\n\n\f4\n\nB.\n\nThe Education Sector\n\n15.\nSamoa  is  a  very  religious  country  and  the  first  school  to  open  in  Samoa  was  a\nCatholic Mission school, 150 years ago.  Since then, Christian churches have continued\nto play an important role in the provision of education particularly at the secondary level.\nMost  of  the  primary  education  and  around  57  percent  of  the  secondary  education  is\nunder  the  control  of  the  public  education  system  through  village,  district,  and  seven\nGovernment-run  schools.    In  1999,  the  churches  and  private  schools  accounted  for\naround 15 percent and 43 percent of the enrollment in primary and secondary education,\nrespectively.\n\n16.\nOver  the  period  1995-1999,  total  school  enrollment  fell  slightly  from  49,093  to\n49,018 even though enrollment in Years 1, 2, and 3 continued to increase.  At primary\nlevel  the  great  majority  of  children  attend  Government  schools,4  whereas  at  secondary\nlevel,  private  and  mission  schools  play  a  much  more  substantial  role.  The  quality  of\neducation  varies  significantly  depending  on  the  type  and  location  of  the  schools  as\nshown by the wide difference in pupil/teacher ratios, percentage of untrained teachers,\nand Year 8 repetition rates (Appendix 2).\n\nIt is Government policy under the terms of the Education Ordinance (1959) that\n17.\nall children in Samoa must receive primary education.  There is evidence, however, that\nsome  pupils  drop  out  of  school  in  the  primary  school  years.    The  dropout  rate  at\nsecondary level is also high. Nevertheless, except for a small number of children living in\nthe  more  remote  villages,  almost  all  children  in  Samoa  do  begin  primary  school  and\nreceive some formal education.  The girls enrolled in the early years of primary school\nare slightly fewer than the boys, reflecting the gender ratio found in the 1991 census of\nthe 0-14 years age group.\n\nThe Government successfully introduced a number of major educational reforms\n18.\nin  recent  years  and  significant  progress  has  been  made  in  improving  the  quality,\nrelevance, and efficiency of education in primary and secondary schools. Furthermore, a\nnumber of projects in various stages of implementation are maintaining the momentum\nin  the  reform  process.  There  is  still  a  need  for  improvement  in  the  quality  of  education\nand  equity  of  access,  and  in  reducing  the  number  of  dropouts  in  the  primary  and\nsecondary cycle.\n\n1.\n\nPrimary Education\n\n19.\nThe  primary  education  subsector  comprising  Years  1-8,  with  total  enrollment  in\n1999 of 35,790 pupils, consists of (i) 138 village schools,5 attended by 27,060 pupils (76\npercent);  (ii)  three  Government-run  schools  on  the  Malifa  campus  attended  by  3,322\npupils (9 percent); (iii) 16 mission schools,6 attended by 4,948 pupils (14 percent); and\n(iv) 2 private schools attended by 460 pupils (1 percent). Only the three primary schools\nin Malifa are Government owned and come under the direct control of the Department of\nEducation  (ED).  These  schools  are  very  crowded,  with  large  classes  and  very  high\npupil/teacher ratios. Despite these adverse conditions, a large number of Year 8 pupils\n\n                                                \n4 Government  schools  are  defined  as  \u201cthose  schools  staffed  by  teachers  whose  salaries  are  wholly  paid\n\nfrom public funds\u201d (Source: Education Ordinance, 1959).\n\n5 Excluding Vaitele and Fusi Safata primary schools, which opened in mid-1999.\n6 Excluding Vaiola and Sauniatu primary schools for which data were not available.\n\n\f5\n\nfrom these three schools gain entry to one of four Government senior college. This good\nacademic performance reinforces the strong demand from parents to have their children\neducated at Malifa.\n\nVillage primary schools, although classified by ED as Government schools, are in\n20.\nfact  owned  by  the  community/village  and  managed  through  community-based  school\ncommittees  (SC).    The  SCs  retain  a  large  measure  of  autonomy  in  many  aspects  of\nschool management, including the development and maintenance of the school facilities\nand  its  financial  income  and  expenditure.  ED  provides  the  teachers,  the  teachers\u2019\nsalaries, and other inputs including stationery and library material.  ED also ensures that\nthe schools are visited periodically under its program of school inspection.\n\nOverall, public primary schools differ widely, in their physical layout and facilities\n21.\nas well as the quality of the education provided.  In some schools, classes do not have\nany furniture and the children sit on mats on the floor. In others, the community provides\nadequate furniture and equipment and the schools are well maintained.  This variability\nalso applies to the qualification and experience of teachers, availability of educational aid\nmaterial and input, and the status of maintenance of the facilities.\n\n22.\nPrivate  schools  charge  generally  higher  school  fees  than  public  schools,  and\nmany Samoan families cannot afford to send their children to private schools.  Mission\nschools  attract  not  just  members  of  their  congregations,  but  also  many  other  parents\nwho seek to send their children to such schools for better education.\n\n2.\n\nSecondary Education\n\n23.\nAdmission  to  secondary  education  is  determined  by  the  national  examination\ntaken  at  Year  8.    While  the  transition  rate  data  show  some  inconsistencies,  it  shows\nclearly that a larger proportion of girls (83.4 percent) than boys (77.6 percent) continue\nfrom Year 8 to Year 9. The breakdown of Year 8-9 transition in all schools for 1999, by\ngender and by location, is shown in Appendix 3.\n\nThe secondary education subsector, including Years 9-13, with a total enrollment\n24.\nof  13,228  pupils,  consists  of  (i)  4  Government  senior  colleges,  attended  by  3,020\nstudents  (23  percent);  (ii)  21  public  junior  secondary  schools  (JSS),  attended  by  4,562\nstudents (34 percent); (iii) 16 mission colleges, attended by 4,370 students (33 percent);\n(iv) 3 mission JSSs, attended by 1,052 students (8 percent); and (v) 1 private secondary\nschool, attended by 224 students (2 percent).  Government, private, and mission schools\nshare  more  evenly  the  responsibility  for  secondary  education,  with  the  latter  having\naround  43  percent  of  pupils.  Children  who  score  higher  in  the  Year  8  national\nexamination  may  gain  access  to  senior  secondary  education  through  one  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s four senior colleges, or in one of the mission colleges or private schools.\nA  large  number  of  students  from  the  primary  schools  at  Malifa  gain  access  to\nGovernment  senior  secondary  schools  every  year,  thereby  reducing  access  to  senior\nsecondary  colleges  to  students  studying  in  the  rural  areas  compared  with  urban\nstudents.\n\n25.\nA  large  proportion  of  children  who  achieve  lower  scores  in  the  Year  8  national\nexamination,  but  still  wish  to  continue  their  formal  education  in  the  public  education\nsystem,  have  to  attend  one  of  the  district  JSSs.  The  district  schools  are  often  ill-\nequipped, with inadequate facilities and less qualified teachers to provide high standard\n\n\f6\n\neducation. As a result, JSSs do not perform as well as either the Government colleges\nor the private and mission schools in terms of academic achievement. Students in JSSs\nare the least well served by the present education system and the division of pupils into\nseparate  junior  and  senior  secondary  school  streams  is  a  matter  of  concern  to  the\nGovernment.\n\n3.\n\nPostsecondary Education\n\nThe postsecondary education system does not fall under the responsibility of ED.\n26.\nThe local postsecondary institutions report directly to the Minister of Education, although\nED  exercises  some  policy,  planning,  and  budgetary  liaison  in  respect  of  the  tertiary\nsector  and  has  senior  representation  on  the  governing  councils  of  the  two  principal\ntertiary institutions. After completing secondary education, the higher-achieving students\nhave  the  option  to  continue  to  full-time  higher  education  in  one  of  the  universities  or\ninstitutions either in Samoa or abroad. In 1999, the total enrollment of Samoan students\nat  the  postsecondary  level  was  estimated  at  2,900  including  full-time,  part-time,  and\nshort-course students. Of this number, 1,220 attended the National University of Samoa\n(NUS),  25  attended  the  University  of  South  Pacific  in  Samoa,  and  500  (17  percent)\nattended  a  university  abroad  with  or  without  scholarships.  Nonuniversity  institutions\ninclude Samoa Polytechnic (673 students), Don Bosco Technical Centre (256 students),\nand a number of smaller specialized centers (225).\n\n27.\nAt NUS, the  Diploma in  Education is one of the most popular courses with 247\nstudents  enrolled  in  the  program.  Other  popular  courses  include  commerce  (303\nstudents),  accounting  (110),  computer  studies  (104),  and  nursing  (40).  A  four-year\nprogram  of  Bachelor  of  Education  (BEd)  will  be  introduced  in  2001.  At  the  Faculty  of\nEducation (FoE), the Diploma in Education provides the major teacher training input into\nthe  Samoan  education  system,  with  separate  primary  and  secondary  subject\nspecialization courses. Teaching jobs are presently available in Samoa for all those who\ncomplete the Diploma in Education.\n\nThe  Samoa  Polytechnic,  described  as \n\n28.\nthe  prime  and  most  prestigious\nvocational/technical  school  in  Samoa,  offers  diploma,  certificate,  and  other  courses  in\ncommerce and general studies, technology, and maritime training, in addition to various\nshort  and  part-time  courses.  Courses  in  business  (tourism),  secretarial  studies,  and\ncomputer sciences are very popular.\n\n29.\nVarious  technical  centers  have  developed  courses  with  a  strong  emphasis  on\npractical and applied subjects, partly in response to criticisms that the school curriculum\nneeds to include more practical training.  The largest of these technical centers is Don\nBosco,  a  vocational  school  for  male  students,  which  has  developed  practical  and\nfocused  courses  relevant  to  market  demand.    At  present,  80-90  percent  of  students\ncompleting  the  courses  at  Don  Bosco  are  successful  in  securing  paid  employment  in\nSamoa.  This  is  a  remarkable  record  considering  that  students  entering  Don  Bosco  are\nessentially those who have not been successful at the Year 11 or school certificate (Year\n12) examinations.  Limited vocational training programs for female students are available\nat  mission  schools  and  specialized  centers  like  the  Young  Men/Women  Christian\nAssociation.\n\n30.\nThere  are  at  least  16  other,  generally  smaller,  postsecondary  training  providers\n(including  3  theological  colleges),  almost  all  in  the  private  sector.  Their  enrollment\n\n\f7\n\nfigures  are  not  available.    Additionally,  individual  ministries  such  as  the  Ministry  of\nHealth,  the  Ministry  of  Labour,  and  the  Public  Service  Commission  have  a  separate\nbudget item for training purposes.\n\n4.\n\nNational Training Authority\n\n31.\nThe  Government  is  setting  up  a  National  Training  Authority  (NTA)  with  initial\nfunding from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). NTA will serve as a\nvehicle to promote better integration of technical and vocational education and training,\nand the development of more appropriate, demand-driven curricula in this area.  One of\nthe  major  functions  of  NTA  will  be  to  (i)  advise  the  Government  on  the  rational  and\neffective  use  of  scarce  resources  for  formulating  strategic  planning  and  policies,  (ii)\nstudy  the  ongoing  and  emerging  skills  and  knowledge  needs  of  labor  market\nemployment,  and  (iii)  develop  procedures  to  ensure  the  required  standard  of  quality  of\ntraining.\n\n5.\n\nThe Department of Education\n\n32.\nThe  stated  goal  of  ED  is  to  improve  equity  and  quality  of  education  while\nincreasing  relevance  and  efficiency  in  the  sector.  ED  also  seeks  to  achieve  a  more\neffective  system  of  education  for  all  learners.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in\nrecent  years  toward  achieving  ED\u2019s  major  policy  objectives.  There  is  still  room  for\nimprovement,  however,  and  a  number  of  projects  in  ED\u2019s  pipeline  will  address  the\nremaining policy issues.  Institutional and resource limitations, however, may hinder the\nis  currently\nrate  of  progress.  To  address \nimplementing, with assistance from the Australian Agency for International Development\n(AusAID), a major Institutional Strengthening Programme (ISP). The objective of the ISP\nis  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  ED  so  that  learning  opportunities  and\noutcomes  for  Samoan  children  will  be  substantially  improved.    The  ISP  is  expected  to\nenhance the management skills of ED staff and to significantly improve existing business\npractices, work processes, structures, and systems of the department.\n\ninstitutional  weaknesses,  ED \n\nthese \n\n6.\n\nKey Issues in Education\n\na.\n\nRole of the Department of Education\n\nDespite a generous budget allocation and a sizable amount of grant funds from\n33.\nexternal  assistance,  available  resources  within  ED  are  not  sufficient  to  carry  out  its\nresponsibilities. The number of senior management positions in the present structure is\noften not adequate to efficiently manage the national education system. Senior staff are\noverloaded  partly  because  of  the  significant  ongoing  changes  in  administrative  and\neducational  policies  and  procedures.  The  time  available  to  senior  staff  to  attend  to\npolicies  and  strategic  planning  is  severely  limited.  The  central  agencies  require\nadherence to rigorous planning, accountability and transparency guidelines beyond ED\u2019s\npresent  capabilities,  given  the  shortage  of  and  constraints  imposed  on  senior  staff\nresources.    Moreover  the  physical  administrative  facilities  of  ED  require  maintenance\nand  upgrading  to  meet  the  minimum  requirements  of  the  department.  The  provision  of\ninformation technology is also limited and many administrative processes are still carried\nout  manually.  Communication  within  ED  and  between  ED,  the  FoE,  and  the  schools\nneed improvement.  A further problem is retention of trained staff within the department.\n\n\f8\n\nAt present, in addition to policy advice to the Government on education matters,\n34.\nED is also responsible for primary and secondary education services in all public schools\nand  for  directly  managing  three  primary  schools  and  four  senior  secondary  colleges.\nOne  issue  that  the  Government  needs  to  address  is  whether  ED  shall  continue  to  be\ndirectly involved in the delivery of education services, or if its role should be more of a\npolicy and regulation nature.  Plans for restructuring and reducing the size of the Malifa\nprimary  schools  and  transferring  management  to  a  SC  are  currently  being  drawn  up.\nThis  move  toward  decentralization  will  afford  increased  opportunities  for  ED  to\nstrengthen planning and coordination of activities, and to focus on quality improvement\nand a more equitable distribution of resources within the education sector.\n\n35.\nAnother  major  issue  is  whether  ED  will  be  responsible  for  managing  both  the\nhuman  and  the  financial  resources  of  the  sector.    Currently  the  Public  Service\nCommission is responsible for appointing teachers, while ED is responsible for selecting\nand  deploying  them  in  Government  schools,  and  paying  their  salaries.    Under  the\nGovernment\u2019s  public  sector  reform,  a  program  has  been  initiated,  on  a  pilot  basis,  to\npromote  greater  efficiency  through  delegation  of  financial  controls  and  devolution  of\npersonnel management functions to line departments.  While ED has not been selected\nto undergo major restructuring during the pilot phase, it is expected to be included in a\nfuture phase of the program.\n\nb.\n\nSchool Management and Administration\n\n36.\nResource management at the school level is not always adequate. This has led\nto  (i)  overcrowding  at  the  government-owned  schools  in  Malifa  and  underutilization  of\nmany  village  and  district  schools;  (ii)  unclear  definition  of  the  composition,  roles,  and\nfunctions  of  village  and  district  SCs;  (iii)  unclear  definition  of  the  role  of  ED;  (iv)\ninconsistent or incoherent budgeting procedures; and (v) low morale and a high attrition\nrate for principals and teaching staff in public schools.\n\n37. While the Government provides most of the funding for public schools, the local\ncommunities retain ownership of the facilities and considerable independence relating to\nthe management of the school. While this promotes the building of partnership between\nED  and  the  communities  to  ensure  that  the  schools  meet  their  intended  educational\nobjectives,  the  quality  of  service  varies  from  school  to  school.    Public  schools  have\naccess  to  a  number  of  inputs,  but  some  schools  receive  much  less  from  their  local\ncommunities  and  still  lack  some  basic  facilities  such  as  adequate  furniture  or  toilets.\nSchool fees are expected to contribute to preventive maintenance of school facilities, but\nthey  are  not  always  sufficient  for  that  and  SCs  are  not  always  properly  trained  to\nevaluate real maintenance needs.\n\n38.\nAlthough  management  guidelines  for  SCs  have  been  developed,  they  have  not\nbeen widely implemented and are being revised in consultation and with the participation\nof  SCs  and  other  stakeholders  as  part  of  the  ISP.  The  main  issues  that  need  to  be\naddressed  include  (i)  the  composition  of  the  SCs  and  the  extent  of  active  parental\nrepresentation  on  them;  (ii)  the  capacity  of  SCs  members  to  manage  the  affairs  of  the\nschool  and  the  training  requirements  to  increase  that  capacity;  (iii)  the  level  of\ntransparency  and  accountability  of  the  SCs  in  the  financial  management  of  the  school;\nand  (iv)  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  contractual  agreements  between  SCs  and  ED.  A\nfurther  issue  is  whether  ED  has  the  financial  capacity  to  continue  to  assist  community\nschools in the payment of interest on their loans from the Development Bank of Samoa.\n\n\f9\n\nc.\n\nIssues Related to Internal Efficiency\n\n39.\nThere  is  an  urgent  need  to  upgrade  and  rehabilitate  a  large  number  of  school\nfacilities. There is also evidence that unsuitable or inadequate materials are sometimes\nused in schools, primarily because of lack of funds.  A major issue is the recurrent cost\nof  maintaining  the  buildings,  fixtures,  fittings,  furniture,  and  equipment.  When  schools\nneed to be expanded or renovated, one of the main sources of funding in the past has\nbeen  through  community  fund-raising  and  participation,  but  raising  funds  in  the\ntraditional  way  is  becoming  increasingly  difficult.  SCs  need  to  develop  awareness  and\nskills in planning and carrying out regular maintenance programs.\n\nInadequate equipment and teaching resources, combined with limited in-service\n40.\nteacher training, represent a notable hindrance to improving educational outcomes at the\nschool  level.  While  curriculum  materials  and  science  equipment  for  Years  5-8  recently\nsupplied  under  the  AusAID-financed  Second  Primary  Education  Materials  Project  have\nrelieved  some  immediate  pressure,  materials  for  the  younger  children  remain  badly\nneeded and their development is being addressed under the same project. There is also\na  need  for  supplementary  materials,  such  as  readers,  library  books,  charts  and\nmanufacturing  materials,  and  for  experiential  materials.  Local  suppliers  of  curriculum\nmaterials are few and the schools largely depend on supply from overseas. Both primary\nand secondary schools lack adequate libraries. A number of JSSs lack equipment and\nresources.  Many schools have a designated science room or laboratory, but equipment\nis  often  inadequate  or  simply  lacking.    Facilities  for  other  specialized  curriculum  areas\neither do not exist or are not adequately equipped.\n\n41.\nEducation  for  children  aged  5-14  years  is  compulsory  in  Samoa.  The  national\nschool  participation  rate  for  this  age  group,  however,  was  only  87.3  percent  in  1992.\nParticipation showed a moderate increase over the period 1992-1999, and the estimated\nfigure for 1999 was 93.6 percent, but this figure may not be accurate as it is based on\nprojections  from  the  1991  census.  Nongovernment  schools  generally  have  significantly\nbetter transition rates than public schools.  It is also of some concern that, apart from the\nsignificant number of children dropping out of school before Year 8, the national rate of\ntransition from Year 8 to Year 9 (80.3 percent) is still below its 1993 level. Year 8 also\nhas  a  high  rate  of  repeats  from  students  who  are  unable  to  pass  the  examination  to\nsecure entry into a secondary school.\n\n42.\nAs an overall indication of gender difference in transition rates, data from 1995 to\n1999 show that retention rates have been rising for both boys and girls but more rapidly\nfor girls. The retention rates for girls are significantly higher than for boys. In Year 1 boys\nslightly  outnumber  the  girls,  but  this  trend  is  clearly  reversed  by  Year  12.  Girls  are\ngenerally better achievers than the boys in the education system. Over the same period,\nthe  numbers  of  repeaters  in  Years  1-13  fell  significantly  from  2.8  percent  of  total\nenrollment to 1.8 percent. In both primary and secondary schools, rates of repetition are\nbelow  1  percent  of  pupils,  but  this  percentage  is  much  higher  in  Year  1  in  primary\nschools.\n\nExamination results remain generally low in some subjects such as English and\n43.\nmathematics. While results have been slowly improving from a low base in both Year 8\nand  Year  11,  they  now  appear  to  be  declining  in  both  Year  12  (Samoan  School\n\n\f10\n\nCertificate)  and  Year  13  (Pacific  Senior  School  Certificate)  examinations.  Results\nachieved  by  girls  are  clearly  better  than  those  by  boys  in  Year  8  and  Year  11\nexaminations,  but  in  Years  12  and  13  the  smaller  number  of  boys  perform  better  than\ngirls in a majority of subjects.\n\n44.\nThe proportion of teachers in public schools holding a proper certificate/diploma\nrose steadily from 81.6 percent in 1995 to 87.4 percent in 1999. However, this alone is\nnot  sufficient  to  ensure  improved  quality  of  education.  In  village  primary  schools,  for\ninstance, where virtually all teachers are certified, educational achievements are still low\nparticularly  in  mathematics  and  English.  The  impact  of  the  new  curriculum  materials,\nrecently  provided  to  primary  schools,  will  not  be  fully  achieved  in  the  primary  school\nsystem  for  some  years.  Minimum  in-service  training  is  provided  to  support  the\nintroduction of new curricular materials (generally one day per subject per grade), which\nis  clearly  insufficient.  Primary  teachers  need  more  adequate  training  in  mathematics,\nEnglish,  science  and  multigrade  teaching  as  well  as  in  classroom  management.    For\nsecondary  teachers,  in-service  education  is  needed  particularly  for  mathematics,  and\nvocational  subjects  such  as  agriculture,  home  economics,  commercial  studies,  and\nindustrial arts.  In addition, inadequate facilities, equipment and materials further impair\nthe  teaching  of  technical  subjects.  Turnover  of  teachers  is  currently  rapid,  with\napproximately  10  percent  of  all  teachers  in  public  schools  resigning  each  year.  There\nseem to be particular difficulties in recruiting and retaining secondary school teachers for\nscience and practical subjects.\n\nd.\n\nExternal Efficiency Considerations\n\n45.\nData  from  the  National  Provident  Fund  provide  accurate  information  on  the\nformal sector labor market in Samoa, but reliable data regarding employment in the large\ninformal  economy  are  lacking.  Each  year  about  1,100  new  jobs  are  created  in  formal\nemployment.  This  number  includes  150  new  positions;  500  jobs  through  retirement,\nsickness, or death; and about 450 resulting from emigration. The total number of young\npeople leaving school at various levels and seeking employment is estimated at 5,200,\nsignificantly higher than available positions, and this is creating a wide employment gap.\nOnly  about  20  percent  of  those  leaving  school  and  seeking  work  are  employed  in  the\nformal sector. It is unlikely that new jobs in formal employment will increase significantly\nin  the  near  future.  During  1996-1999,  the  total  number  of  jobs  in  formal  employment\nactually declined from 24,548 to 23,120, or a decrease of about 5.8 percent during the\nfour-year period.\n\n46.\nIn the context of the development needs of Samoa, the relevance of education at\nthe  secondary  level  is  particularly  important.  About  75  percent  of  the  total  age  group\ndoes  not  proceed  beyond  Year  11,  and  the  significant  loss  of  development  potential\nrequires  attention.  Employers  show  a  definite  preference  for  candidates  with  senior\nsecondary  education  and  are  looking  for  qualifications  of  at  least  Samoa  School\nCertificate  (Year  12)  standard.  The  secondary  system  is  widely  considered  to  lack\nrelevance  to  village  and  labor  market  needs,  with  not  enough  emphasis  on  practical\nskills.    Because  of  lack  of  resources  committed  to  applied  subjects  in  JSSs,  students\nleaving  the  system  have  limited  ability  in  practical  skills  and  are  unable  or  unwilling  to\nrespond to employment opportunities in the trade and technical areas.\n\n\f11\n\nThe  issues  of  relevant  skills  development  are  being  addressed  by  new  school\n47.\ncurriculum  development  and  through  training  in  practical  skills  in  technical  and\nspecialized centers. Curriculum development in both primary and secondary education is\nbeing  supported  by  AusAID  and  the  New  Zealand  Overseas  Development  Agency\n(NZODA). However, it will take a number of years before the effect of recently introduced\ncurriculum  materials  can  translate  into  visible  impacts  on  educational  outcomes  and\nrelevance for employment opportunities.\n\ne.\n\nIssues Addressed by the Project\n\n48.\nThe  education  sector  in  Samoa  faces  numerous  challenges.  Considerable\nGovernment  efforts,  with  assistance  from  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies,  are  under\nway  to  address  the  most  significant  issues.  The  Project  will  address  in  particular  the\nurgent  need  to  upgrade  and/or  expand  20-30  primary  and  secondary  public  schools,\nincluding the primary and senior secondary schools in Malifa. The Project will also set up\nan  effective  in-service  teacher  training  program  and  provide  instructional  materials  and\nlibrary resources to subproject schools. The Project is well integrated with ongoing key\neducational \nincluding  capacity  building,  curriculum\ndevelopment,  teacher  training,  and  upgrading  of  school  facilities  financed  by  AusAID,\nNZODA , Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and others.\n\ninterventions \n\nthe  sector, \n\nin \n\nC.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1.\n\nPolicy Framework\n\n49.\nSince  its  first  SES,  in  1995,  the  Government  has  consistently  placed  a  high\npriority  on  human  resources  development,  through  improvement  in  the  quality  of\neducation and health, as a critical element of its strategy to develop a more enterprise-\nbased  and  competitively  structured  economy.  In  its  third  SES,  which  was  released  in\nJanuary  2000,7  the  Government  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  human  resource\ndevelopment,  and  particularly  to  continue  to  strengthen  and  improve  the  learning\nenvironment  in  primary  and  secondary  education.  The  Government\u2019s  policies  on\neducation  were  published  in  July  1995,  following  comprehensive  public  consultations,\nand extensive studies and reviews of the sector.8  In May 1999, ED held a minisummit\nwith  all  major  stakeholders  to  provide  feedback  on  the  progress  of  implementation  of\nEducation  Policies  1995-2005. \nfor\nstakeholders  to  participate  in  the  revision  and  updating  of  the  strategic  plan.    The\noutcome  confirmed  a  number  of  priorities  in  the  sector:  (i)  the  development  of  early\nchildhood  education;  (ii)  improvement  in  the  overall  quality  of  primary  education;  (iii)\nimprovement  in  access  to  senior  secondary  education  by  upgrading  all  JSSs  to  senior\ncolleges; iv) the need to address special needs; (v) strengthening of teacher education;\n(vi)  improvement  in  postsecondary  education  and  training;  (vii)  support  for  nonformal\neducation;  (viii)  improved  management,  planning,  and  policy  formulation  at  the  central\nlevel of ED; and (ix) improved management at school level.\n\n  The  summit  also  afforded  an  opportunity \n\n                                                \n7  Treasury Department. 2000.

Government of Samoa, July 1995.\n\n\f12\n\n2.\n\nSector Strategy\n\n50.\nThe  policies  formulated  in  the  Education  Policies  1995-2005  were  used  to\ndevelop a comprehensive set of strategies9 representing a 10-year strategic plan for in-\ndepth  reforms  in  the  education  sector.  The  reforms  aim  at  developing  an  institutional\nstructure capable of delivering an education system that meets the principles of equity,\nquality, relevance, and efficiency.  A significant portion of the strategic plan has already\nbeen implemented. The main elements of the sector strategy for the period of 2000-2005\nfocus  on  key  developmental  objectives  and  major  new  initiatives  designed  to  upgrade\nprimary  and  secondary  education  through  infrastructure  improvements,  curriculum\ndevelopment, \nlocal  school\nimproved  education  services,  and  strengthening  of \nmanagement committees.  Vocational education is also to be given greater emphasis in\nconjunction  with  the  introduction  of  an  upgraded  single-stream  secondary  schools\ncurriculum  effectively  upgrading  all  JSSs  to  senior  secondary  colleges.    Teaching\nservice conditions related to improving teacher retention and increasing opportunities for\nprofessional development will also be addressed.  At the postsecondary level, NUS and\nSamoa  Polytechnic  will  focus  on  strengthening  education  and  training  programs,  and\nimplementing  resource  utilization  strategies  to  achieve  a  more  cost-effective  return  on\npublic spending.  Early childhood education and special needs education will also be the\nobject of increased attention, particularly with improved curriculum and teacher training.\n\n51.\nThe  Government\u2019s  policies  and  strategies,  and  the  sector  investment  plan  for\neducation  are  basically  sound  and  of  good  quality.    As  such  they  provide  a  suitable\nframework  for  ADB  sector  lending.  The  strategic  plan  is  supported  by  a  number  of\nbilateral and multilateral external aid agencies including AusAID, NZODA, JICA, UNDP,\nand the European Union (EU) (Appendix 4).\n\nD.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n52.\nThe  Government  is  firmly  committed  to  its  strategy  to  improve  health  and\neducation  standards.    To  achieve  this  goal,  the  Government  allocates  a  substantial\nportion of its recurrent expenditure to these sectors.  Education received an average of\n13.7 percent of the total Government expenditure in each of the last four years, second\nonly to general administration (17.4 percent during the same period). In addition, a high\nproportion  of  external  assistance  to  Samoa  is  dedicated  to  education.    The  total  funds\nallocated  to  education  and  training  by  each  aid  agency  are  significant:  AusAID  for\ninstance allocates 42 percent of its annual assistance program to Samoa to education-\nrelated  activities,  including  institutional  strengthening  of  ED  and  scholarship  for  long-\nterm  training. The  proportion of NZODA\u2019s assistance to education is even higher at 68\npercent,  with  a  significant  portion  being  allocated  for  long-term  training  and  for\nsecondary  education  curriculum  development.    The  EU  microprojects  include  a  58\npercent  education  component  comprising  mostly  small  infrastructure  improvements  to\nvillage  schools.  Other  sources,  including  JICA  and  UNDP,  also  allocate  a  significant\nportion  of  their  program  to  education.    The  central  issue,  however,  is  the  proportion  of\ntotal resources allocated to each subsector.  A review of external funding shows that the\nproportion  to  education  is  heavily  weighted  toward  postsecondary/tertiary  level  (71\npercent in 1998/99). During the same period, secondary and primary education received\nonly  8  percent  and  15  percent  of  total  external  assistance,  respectively,  while  early\nchildhood education received only 1 percent.\n\n                                                \n9  Education Department. 1995. Education Strategies 1995-2005.  Government of Samoa, July 1995.\n\n\f13\n\n53.\nDevelopment  assistance  to  the  sector  is  clearly  demand-led  and  ranges  from\nsmall  community-based  projects  such  as  preschool  playgrounds  and  toilet  blocks,  to\nmajor  undertakings  such  as  the  construction  of  new  primary  schools.    At  both  primary\nand secondary school levels, external assistance is now playing a more significant role\nin providing necessary inputs toward the Government\u2019s strategic development plan.\n\n54.\nIn  1999  approximately  50  projects  or  programs  were  being  implemented  in  the\nsector. These projects/programs ranged in size from the EU microprojects to large-scale\nprograms  such  as  the  AusAID-financed  ISP  and  the  NZODA  long-term  study  awards\nprogram.  Coordination  of  such  a  range  and  quantity  of  activities  requires  considerable\neffort and expertise.\n\n55.\nSamoa is very efficient in coordinating and managing a large number of external\nassistance.    Two  departments  share  a  prominent  role  in  this  area.  The  Treasury\nDepartment  (TD)  is  responsible  for  all  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  EU  assistance;  the\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is responsible for coordinating all bilateral and other\nmultilateral  assistance,  including  that  of  UNDP.    The  two  departments  routinely  work\ntogether to organize major coordination meetings with aid agencies in different sectors,\nsuch  as  the  one  held  in  1999,  following  the  minisummit  for  education  and  health.  The\nEducation  Steering  Committee  (ESC)  is  another  important  coordination  mechanism  in\nthe sector.  It was initially established in June 1999 to coordinate AusAID-assisted ISP\nactivities, but its role and responsibilities have since been expanded allowing it to serve\nas  the  focal  point  for  all  stakeholders,  and  to  oversee  and  provide  coordination  and\npolicy  guidance  for  all  reform  activities  in  the  education  sector.  The  ESC  is  chaired  by\nthe  ombudsman,  and  includes  broad  representation  at  high  level  from  a  number  of\nstakeholders in the education system including TD and DFA.10  By virtue of its high level\nrepresentation  over  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  the  ESC  is  a  powerful  coordination\nmechanism for all external assistance programs in the sector.\n\nE.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nA  key  lesson  learned  from  ADB  assistance  in  the  Pacific  is  that  political\n56.\ncommitment  to,  ownership  of,  and  community  participation  in  a  project  are  essential  to\nensure  that  it  meets  its  development  objectives.  In  its  third  SES,  the  Government\nconfirmed its political commitment to the Project. The SES emphasizes the need for an\nimproved  learning  environment  and  improved  quality  of  education  at  primary  and\nsecondary levels. This strategic direction constitutes the basic rationale for the proposed\nProject.  An  innovative  design  feature  of  the  Project  is  the  key  role  played  by  the  local\ncommunity in subproject preparation and implementation. The commitment of the SCs to\ncontribute  significantly  to  the  subproject  investment  cost  will  ensure  their  involvement\nand ownership.\n\n57.\nADB\u2019s  recently  updated  sector  synthesis  of  evaluation  findings  in  the  education\nsector  points  to  several  key  issues  and  lessons,  which  have  been  considered  and\nincorporated in the design of the proposed Project. The synthesis shows that the quality\n\n                                                \n10 Other  members  include  the  director,  ED;  the  director,  PWD;  the  financial  secretary,  TD;  the  secretary,\nDFA; the secretary, Public Service Commission; the Chief Executive Officer, Samoa Polytechnic; the vice\nchancellor, NUS; and a representative from the Post Primary Principals\u2019 Association.\n\n\f14\n\nof education at primary and secondary levels depends on a sufficient supply of qualified\nteachers. To address this issue, the skills of existing teachers in the subproject schools\nwill be upgraded through in-service teacher training.  Another lesson from the synthesis\nis  the  usual  paucity  of  data  regarding  dropouts,  repeaters,  and  other  indicators  of\ninternal efficiency. Under the Project, the information base will be strengthened through\na performance-based benefit monitoring and evaluation system that will provide data on\nobjectively verifiable indicators (OVIs). A third lesson is the need to fully utilize buildings,\nequipment,  and  other  facilities  to  enhance  cost-effectiveness  in  the  use  of  scarce\nresources. In the design of the Project, neighboring schools will be encouraged to share\nfacilities  and  resources  to  promote  efficient  use  of  resources.    Moreover,  a  formal\nagreement between the SCs of each subproject school and ED will ensure efficient use\nand  maintenance  of  educational  resources.  A  fourth  lesson  is  that  governments  are\noften unable to absorb and sustain the recurrent expenditure required to ensure proper\noperation  and  maintenance  after  project  implementation.  The  Project  incorporates  a\ncomprehensive  facilities  maintenance  program  for  each  of  the  subproject  schools.  A\nbuilding  maintenance  specialist  will  be  provided  under  the  associated  TA  to  assist  the\nschools in the design and implementation of the maintenance program. And finally, the\nsynthesis  shows  that  project  inputs  do  not  automatically  result  in  improved  quality  of\neducation.    A  school  management  development  program  (financed  under  the  AusAID-\nfinanced  ISP)  will  enhance  understanding  of  the  educational  processes  to  produce\nhigher quality education, based on an analysis of the teaching and learning processes in\nthe actual classroom situation.\n\nF.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n58.\nEducation is an essential element in the process of human, social, and economic\ndevelopment. The main purpose of investment in education is to empower people with\nknowledge,  skills,  and  attitudes  so  as  to  improve  their  quality  of  life,  enhance  their\nproductivity and their capacity to learn new skills, and enable them to participate fully in\nthe development process. There is a direct relationship between education and poverty\nreduction.  People  with  education  have  higher  income-earning  potential  and  are  better\nable to improve the quality of their lives. In this context, ADB\u2019s overarching objective of\npoverty  reduction  can  be  better  achieved  through  equity  and  access  to  quality  basic\neducation.  ADB\u2019s  sector  priorities  with  respect  to  education  are  therefore  to  support\ninitiatives  that  promote  increased  equity  and  access  and  improved  quality  of  education\nservices,  strengthen  management  efficiency,  and  mobilize  resources  for  sustainable\neducation delivery.\n\n59.\nIn  the  context  of  Samoa,  these  objectives  and  priorities  match  closely  those  of\nthe Government. In its third SES, the Government stresses its continued commitment to\nstrengthen  education  and  training,  and  to  ensure  access  to  quality  education  for  all\nSamoans.    In  particular  the  SES  recognizes  the  need  to  strengthen  and  improve  the\nlearning  environment  at  the  primary  level,  and  to  expand  and  improve  the  quality  of\nsecondary education.  ADB\u2019s sector strategy in Samoa is to support the Government\u2019s\npolicies  and  strategies  to  improve  the  quality  and  delivery  of  education  services  at\nprimary and secondary levels.\n\nG.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n60.\nPolicy  dialogue  focused  on  improving  equity  and  the  quality  of  education  while\nincreasing  relevance  and  efficiency.  More  specifically,  the  discussion  focused  on  (i)\n\n\f15\n\ndevelopment  of  satellite  primary  and  secondary  schools  to  relieve  pressure  on  Malifa\nand  improve  equity  of  access  to  quality  education;  (ii)  extension  of  facilities  in  JSSs  to\noffer  a  full  curriculum  to  all  secondary  school  students;  (iii)  development  of  common\nbuilding  and  furniture  standards  for  all  schools,  regardless  of  the  source  of  financing;\nand  (iv)  improvement  in  the  management  of  the  education  sector  as  a  whole  and  the\nprimary and secondary schools in particular.\n\n61.\nOne of the major problems facing ED is the disproportionate number of children\nattending school at the three primary and one secondary schools in Malifa. To overcome\nthis problem, other schools in the greater Apia area and ultimately in the rural areas will\nbe developed and upgraded to accept the overflow of children from Malifa. A number of\npotential  schools  have  been  identified  and  designated  as  satellite  schools  for  this\npurpose. In addition to improving the physical facilities of satellite schools, attention will\nbe  placed  on  improving  the  management  capacity  and  accountability  of  the  SC,\nupgrading  teacher  qualifications,  and  providing  better  equipment  and  material  for  an\nenhanced learning environment.  The cooperation of other aid agencies in the sector will\nbe obtained to coordinate these efforts for each school selected.\n\n62.\nThe maintenance of assets (buildings and equipment) is the responsibility of the\nSCs.    The  level  of  maintenance  varies  greatly  from  school  to  school,  depending  on\ncommunity involvement  and commitment, management capacity of the  committee, and\naffordability.  School  committees  need  awareness  and  skills  training  in  planning  and\ncarrying  out  a  regular  facilities  maintenance  program.  Through  associated  technical\nassistance,  the  SCs  will  be  trained  in  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  a\ncomprehensive program of preventive maintenance for primary and secondary schools.\nThe maintenance program will be designed in close cooperation with school authorities,\nED, and Public Works Department (PWD) and, will include safety aspects relating to fire,\ncyclones and earthquakes.\n\n63.\nThe  cost  of  the  education  system  in  Samoa  is  effectively  shared  by  the\nGovernment  and  the  local  community.    The  government  provides  the  teachers,  the\ncurriculum,  and  related  materials,  while  SCs  raise  funds  to  meet  the  cost  of  facilities,\nequipment,  maintenance,  and  consumable  resources.    This  partnership  is  unique  and\nneeds  to  form  the  basis  of  cost  recovery  strategies.  However,  there  is  need  for  capital\ninjection from the Government to meet the planned quality improvements. Under similar\nexternally  assisted  projects,  the  local  communities  are  required  to  bear  a  certain\npercentage (10-25 percent) of the costs of infrastructure development, rehabilitation, or\nexpansion.    Community  contribution  can  typically  be  provided  in  cash  and  in  kind,  and\ngenerally  includes  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  and  materials.    This  mechanism  has\nproved to work well with the EU- and JICA-assisted projects, and a similar mechanism\nwill be applied under the proposed sector loan.\n\n64.\nIt is estimated that local communities contribute about 13 percent of the recurrent\nexpenditure  of  primary  and  secondary  education  in  Government  and  mission  schools\nthrough  payment  of  regular  school  fees  alone.    If  additional  funds  raised  by  SCs,\nparents,  and  teachers  and  further  contributions  in  kind  are  taken  into  account,\ncommunities  may  already  be  contributing  some  25  percent  of  total  expenditure  on\nprimary  and  secondary  education.    The  proposed  cost-sharing  arrangement  for  the\nproject should therefore not raise an affordability issue.\n\n\f16\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  for  education  is  an  integral  part  of  its\n65.\noverall economic strategy to enhance the quality of life of all Samoans. A cornerstone in\nthe  comprehensive  reform  program  is  to  build  an  efficient  market-based  economy,  by\nensuring  the  availability  of  skilled  human  resources  to  facilitate  private  sector\ndevelopment  and  growth.    Since  the  Government\u2019s  adoption  of  comprehensive\neducation policies and strategies for 1995-2005, considerable progress has been made\ntoward achieving improvements in equity of access to and the efficiency, relevance, and\nquality of education in primary and secondary schools. The Government recognizes that\nfurther  improvements  are  needed  in  primary  and  secondary  school  facilities,  including\nprovision of appropriate quality inputs, upgrading of teachers\u2019 skills, and management of\nthe  education  sector  at  all  levels.  These  improvements  are  necessary  to  ensure  that\nsufficient  well-qualified  students  are  able \nthe  emerging\nopportunities  generated  by  the  private  sector  as  a  result  of  the  ongoing  economic  and\npublic sector reforms.\n\ntake  advantage  of \n\nto \n\n66.\nThe  Project  has  been  formulated  within  the  framework  of  the  Government\u2019s\neconomic and public sector policies and within the education policies in particular. The\nproposed  ADB  sector  loan  will  finance  a  time  slice  \u2013  2000-2005  \u2013  of  the  10-year\nstrategic  plan.    It  will  address  part  of  the  infrastructure  development  needs  of  the\neducation sector by financing a significant part of the Government\u2019s investment plan not\nsupported by other aid agencies. The Project will comprise 25-30 subprojects  in primary\nand  secondary  schools  throughout  the  islands  of  Upolu  and  Savaii,  with  a  stronger\nconcentration in the greater Apia area. The cost of rehabilitation and expansion will vary\nbetween  $50,000  and  $500,000.  The  country  has  adequate  institutional  capacity  to\nimplement  the  sector  development  plan  and  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan.  Community  or  village\ninvolvement  and  ownership  are  essential  characteristics  of  the  project  design  and\nimplementation.\n\nThe  Project,  designed  under  the  ADB  sector  lending  modality,  satisfies  all  ADB\n67.\ncriteria  for  a  sector  loan.  The  Government  has  a  comprehensive  and  sound  education\npolicy framework covering the period 1995-2005. The framework is based on the 1992\nWorld Bank study, and includes primary and secondary education, teacher training, and\nencompasses  as  well  departmental  and  school  management,  early  child  education,\nspecial  needs  education,  and  post-secondary  policies  and  strategies.    The  policy\nframework  reflects  the  national  consensus  and  the  strategic  thinking  of  education\nspecialists,  and  has  full  Government  support.    The  policy  framework  has  been\ntransformed  into  an  implementable  strategic  plan  to  allow  the  nation\u2019s  educational\nobjectives  to  be  achieved  gradually  and  in  an  educationally  appropriate  and  financially\nresponsible  manner  over  1995-2005.  Since  1995,  the  biannual  SESs  have  strongly\nemphasized  the  vital  role  of  education  in  the  economy,  and  resources  allocated  to  the\nsector  have  increased  substantially.  The  strategic  plan  is  financially  supported  by  a\nnumber  of  bilateral  and  multilateral  external  assistance  agencies,  including  AusAID,\nNZODA, JICA, UNDP, and EU.\n\n\f17\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1.\n\nObjectives\n\nConsistent with the Government\u2019s economic strategy, the objective of the Project\n68.\nis  to  increase  the  availability  of  human  resources  with  adequate  professional  and\ntechnical skills to meet the labor requirements in an increasingly more broad-based and\nmarket-oriented  economy.  The  Project  is  thus  expected  to  contribute  to  sustained,\nequitable, and sustainable high quality economic growth. In line with this objective, the\nproject  will  increase  equity  of  access  to  a  relevant,  efficient,  and  higher  quality  public\nprimary  and  secondary  education  system.  Specifically,  the  Project  will  upgrade  and/or\nexpand, as required, a number of public primary and secondary schools throughout the\ncountry;  improve  the  overall  quality  of  primary  and  secondary  education;  build\ninstitutional capacity to better prepare, design, and implement subprojects; and provide\ninputs  to  support  project  implementation.  Details  of  the  project  goal,  objectives,  and\nrelated outputs are in the project framework (Appendix 5).\n\nScope\n\n2.\n\na.\n\nEquity in Access to Schools\n\n69.\nThrough a series of subprojects, the Project will promote more equitable access\nto  schools  by  upgrading  and/or  expanding  selected  public  primary  and  secondary\nschools throughout the country. The Project will rehabilitate and, where required, expand\nand improve the facilities of a number of primary and junior secondary satellite schools.\nThese  are  schools  generally  located  in  the  greater  Apia  area  that  may  be  expected  to\nattract students who currently attend school at Malifa. The building facilities of a number\nof  district  primary  schools  and  JSSs  outside  of  Apia  will  also  be  upgraded  to  enable\nthem, through their combined resources, to offer the full secondary school curriculum to\nstudents in their catchment areas.\n\n70.\nThe  existing  three  primary  schools  in  Malifa  --  Apia  Lower,  Apia  Middle,  and\nLeififi  Intermediate  --  which  together  currently  enroll  about  3,300  students,  will  be\nrestructured  into  one  primary  school,  and  refurbished  to  provide  integrated  building\nfacilities.  The  new  primary  school  will  cater  for  a  maximum  of  750  students  living  in\nvillages in the immediate vicinity of Malifa.  The buildings of Leififi College in Malifa will\nbe refurbished and will continue to offer the full senior secondary school curriculum, but\nthe number of students will be reduced from over 1,500 at present to 750 students.\n\nb. \n\nQuality of Education\n\n71.\nIn  addition  to  enhancing  the  physical  learning  environment  at  the  primary  and\nsecondary levels, the Project will support the provision of inputs aimed at improving the\nquality  of  education.  Consistent  with  the  needs  of  new  and  evolving  curricula,  the\nschools will be provided with curriculum support materials and library resources.\n\n72.\nNew teachers being trained at NUS are receiving adequate preservice training in\nthe  new  curricula.  Continued  teacher  skills  upgrading,  however,  is  critically  needed.  A\nthorough assessment of in-service training needs for the project schools and other public\nschools in general will be carried out. To promote effective teaching of the new curricula,\nconsulting services under the associated TA will assist in the development of in-service\n\n\f18\n\nteacher  training  programs  for  primary  and  secondary  education  teachers.    ED  staff,\nassisted  by  consultants  under  the  loan,  will  actually  implement  the  in-service  teacher\ntraining program. It is expected that external funding agencies will also provide additional\nresources in the near future to supplement ED\u2019s own resources.\n\n73.\nThe  Project  has  been  designed  to  improve  planning  and  coordination  between\nED, Public Service Commission, and NUS where the large majority of new teachers are\ntrained.  An  education  planning  specialist  under  the  associated  TA  will  assist  ED  in\npreparing a medium-term plan for development of suitably trained teachers to meet the\ncontinuing  needs  of  the  public  primary  and  secondary  education  system.    The  TA\nconsultant  will  also  assess  the  existing  incentive  structure  for  teachers  and  make\nappropriate recommendations.\n\nc.\n\nEducational Efficiency and Institutional Capacity\n\n74.\nThe  Project  aims  to  promote  the  efficient  use  of  educational  resources  and\nimprove  the  capacity  of  ED  to  design  and  implement  educational  development\nprograms. Consulting services will be provided to assist in project implementation. The\nconsultants will provide key on-the-job training to strengthen the capacity of the project\nmanagement  team  and  other  officers  of  ED  in  establishing  and  maintaining  of  project\nmanagement  systems.11  These  capacity-building  activities  are  particularly  important  to\nfuture  development  in  the  sector  and  are  designed  to  improve  the  capacity  of  ED  in\nproject planning, implementation, and monitoring.\n\nDomestic  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  develop  optimal  plans  and\n75.\nspecifications  for  buildings,  fixtures,  and  furniture  for  general  and  special-purpose\nprimary  and  secondary  classrooms.  Such  plans  will  be  used  in  the  upgrading  of  the\nproject schools and, eventually, the education system at large.\n\n76.\nMore  effective  and  efficient  use  of  educational  resources  will  be  promoted\nthrough formal agreements between the SCs of each project school and ED.  Under this\nagreement, each committee will institute a school management development program12\nand a facilities maintenance program.13\n\nd. \n\nProject Implementation Support\n\nResources  will  be  allocated  toward  the  provision  of  equipment  and  services  for\n77.\neffective project implementation.  They will include office furniture and equipment, office\nsupplies and services, vehicles to be used in project monitoring and supervision, and a\npublic  awareness  program  to  promote  familiarity  with  and  community  ownership  of  the\nProject.\n\n                                                \n11 Capacity  building  for  planning,  design,  and  implementation  of  educational  development  projects  will  be\n\nprovided separately under an associated TA.\n\n12 The  AusAID-funded  ISP  will  design  the  management  development  program  for  schools  and  will  assist\n\nproject schools in implementation through training and other measures.\n\n13 A  building  maintenance  specialist  provided  through  the  associated  TA  will  design  a  comprehensive\n\nfacilities maintenance program for schools and assist in its implementation.\n\n\f19\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n78.\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $10.06  million  equivalent,  comprising  $5.08\nmillion in foreign currency cost and $4.98 million equivalent in local currency cost (Table\n1).  The  total  cost  includes  contingencies,  price  escalation  and  interest  during\nconstruction.

The loan will have a 32 years maturity, 8 years grace period,\nand  interest  charges  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent\nthereafter. The loan will finance the entire foreign currency cost of the Project including\ninterest  during  construction  and  part  of  the  local  currency  cost.    The  Government\ncounterpart contribution will be $1.65 million equivalent (16 percent) to meet part of the\nlocal currency cost of the Project including taxes and duties. Beneficiaries will contribute\n$1.41  million  equivalent  (14  percent)  in  cash  or  in  kind  to  meet  certain  local  currency\ncosts.    Each  individual  SC  will  be  required  to  contribute  an  amount  equal  to\napproximately  25  percent  of  the  cost  of  rehabilitation  of  the  buildings  for  its  school.14\nBeneficiary  financing  may  apply  to  the  costs  of  both  furniture  and  building  works.

No  beneficiary  contribution  will  be  required  for\nrehabilitation of the schools in Malifa.\n\n\f20\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nExecuting and Implementing Agencies\n\nThe  Treasury  Department  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.15    The\n80.\nEducation  Department  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  and  will  be  responsible  for\noverall  planning,  organizing,  managing,  supervising,  and  coordinating  all  project\nactivities; monitoring and reporting on physical and financial progress; and coordinating\nproject activities with related development activities funded by aid agencies.\n\n81.\nThe assistant director of Corporate Services, ED will be the project manager. A\nproject  management  team  (PMT)  will  be  established  within  ED,  headed  by  the  project\nmanager,  and  comprising  at  least  three  additional  full-time  staff  including  a  project\nadministration  officer,  a  project  development  officer/procurement  coordinator,  and  a\nproject  accountant.    The  PMT  will  be  assisted  in  its  work  by  a  team  of  international\nconsultants.  The  PMT  will  report  to  the  Education  Infrastructure  Coordination  Sub-\nCommittee (EICSC) of the ESC.  The EICSC is one of two subsidiary bodies of the ESC,\nthe other being the Implementation Task Force of the AusAID-funded ISP.  The EICSC\nwill provide advice and guidance regarding planning, coordination, and implementation,\nincluding preparation of the subprojects. The ESC will provide guidance and advice on\npolicy-related matters.  A chart of the project management is in Appendix 7.\n\n2.\n\nAppraisal and Implementation of Subprojects\n\nThe Project will be implemented as a series of subprojects, one for each school\n82.\nto be upgraded or expanded.  Under the guidance of the ESC and EICSC, the PMT will\nprepare  a  work  program  prioritizing  the  subprojects,  and  justifying  their  design  and\nappraisal.  The selection criteria are: location, physical condition of the facilities, cost and\naffordability of the proposed rehabilitation, management capacity and commitment of the\nSCs, educational performance, ownership and involvement of parents and stakeholders\nin the affairs of the school, and willingness of the SC to enter into a resource agreement\nwith  ED  (Appendix  8).    An  initial  potential  16  subprojects  have  been  identified;  other\nsubprojects  will  be  added  to  or  substituted  for  the  identified  subprojects.  The  ESC  will\nreview the selection criteria for subproject schools and the application of these criteria to\nthe prioritized list of probable subprojects. The estimated costs of the subprojects range\nfrom  about  $50,000  to  $500,000.  The  subprojects  are  distributed  on  Upolu  and  Savaii,\nwith a concentration in the greater Apia area. The PMT will be responsible for the design\nand implementation of each subproject, with the technical services provided by PWD. It\nwill  carry  out  preliminary  design  and  cost  estimates;  prepare  detailed  drawings,\nspecifications, and tender documentation; tender contracts; and supervise construction.\n\n83.\nThe  PMT  will  establish  a  subproject  preparation  team  (SPT)  comprising  the\nproject development officer and at least one representative from each of the Curriculum\nDivision of ED, and the Building Division of PWD. Working in collaboration with the SCs\nof  the  relevant  schools,  the  SPT  will  prepare  a  subproject  appraisal  report  (SAR)  for\neach  subproject.    The  SAR  will  contain  justification  for  and  details  of  the  proposed\nsubproject, the resource agreement between ED and the SC, and a recommendation to\nADB  for  approval  of  the  subproject.  The  SAR  will  be  presented  to  the  ESC  for  review\n\n                                                \n15 The  Treasury  Department  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  all  ADB-  and  World  Bank-supported  projects  in\n\nSamoa.\n\n\f21\n\nagainst agreed upon criteria and endorsement for ADB approval (Appendix 8). The SAR\nfor the first subproject, Falefitu Primary School, is attached as Appendix 9. Approval of\nthe Government\u2019s request for the first subproject will be given by ADB in conjunction with\napproval of the loan.\n\n3.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n84.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  four  years,  including\npreparatory activities to be carried out prior to loan effectiveness, under advance action\nand retroactive financing.  The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10.\n\n4.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\n85.\nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procurement  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  Each contract for goods and services and each civil\nworks  contract  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Except  for  minor  items,  contracts  for  the\nsupply of goods, equipment, furniture, and instructional materials, estimated to cost less\nthan $500,000, will be awarded on the basis of international shopping. Civil works under\nthe  Project  are  small  and  numerous  and  will  be  scattered  throughout  the  country.  As\nsuch  they  are  not  expected  to  attract  the  interest  of  international  contractors.    It  is\ntherefore  proposed  that  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  be\nawarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  among  prequalified\ncontractors,  following  Government  standard  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.    Contracts\nfor  the  supply  of  minor  items,  such  as  photocopiers,  office  equipment,  and  school\nfurniture estimated to cost, in the aggregate, the equivalent of $150,000 or less may be\nprocured on a direct purchase basis.\n\n5.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n86.\nApproximately  24  person-months  of  international  and  3  person-months  of\ndomestic  consulting  services  will  be  provided.  All  ADB-financed  consultants  will  be\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The\nGovernment will ensure that appropriate counterpart staff are assigned to work with the\nconsultants  to  optimize  transfer  of  knowledge  and  skills.    The  consultants  (person-\nmonths  in  parentheses)  will  have  expertise  in  project  management  and  administration\n(18),  in-service  teacher  training  (6),  and  education  building  standards  (3).  The\nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 11.\n\n6.\n\nAdvanced Action and Retroactive Financing\n\n87.\nADB  has  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance  action  for  the\nrecruitment of consultants and procurement of goods and services relating to the early\nestablishment of the PMT and preparation and implementation of subprojects. ADB also\napproved  in  principle  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  retroactive  financing,  to  a  value  of\nabout  $250,000  equivalent,  for  eligible  expenditures  incurred  after  15  April  2000  and\nprior to loan effectiveness.  Advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and Guidelines on Procurement.  The Government\nwas  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  with  respect  to  advance  action  and  retroactive\nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the Project or any part thereof.\n\n\f22\n\n7. \n\nReports, Accounts and Audit\n\n88.\nUnder the proposed implementation arrangements, all applications for withdrawal\nand disbursement of loan funds will be submitted to ADB by ED through TD.  Because of\nthe  expected  large  number  of  small  payments  that  will  be  required  by  the  Project,  an\nimprest  account  will  be  opened  by  TD  to  ensure  timely  release  of  funds.    The  imprest\naccount will be established immediately after the date of loan effectiveness, and will be\nmanaged,  replenished  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement\nHandbook.\n\n89.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  proceeds  of  the  loan  are  deposited  in  the\nimprest  account,  which  will  be  liquidated/replenished  on  the  basis  of  disbursements\nmade  in  the  previous  quarter  and  the  projection  of  expenditure  for  the  subsequent\nquarter,  and  upon  submission  of  supporting  documents  and  progress  reports  by  TD.\nFunds  for  small  purchases  will  be  replenished  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  statement  of\nexpenditures  (SOE)  procedures.    The  imprest  account  will  cover  all  local  currency\nexpenditures. Expenditures to be paid in foreign currencies will be paid by ADB through\nthe normal procedures of direct payment and commitment.\n\n90.\nThe  PMT  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  reports  on  the  progress  of\nproject  implementation  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB.    The  Government  will  establish\nand  maintain  separate  accounts  and  records  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  sound\naccounting  principles  and  will  specify  expenditures  on  all  aspects  of  the  Project  and\nidentify all expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan.  An annual audit\nof project accounts, including audit of the imprest account and SOE,16 will be undertaken\nby  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.    The  auditor\u2019s  report  and  copies  of  the\ncertified  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  in  English  will  be  submitted  to  ADB\nwithin 6 months of each related fiscal year.   A project completion report will be prepared\nby the PMT and submitted to ADB not later than three months after physical completion\nof the Project.\n\n8.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\na.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring\n\n91.\nAt  the  earliest  possible  stage  during  project  implementation,  the  PMT  will\nestablish  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  to  measure,  assess,  and\nmonitor  project  outputs  and  impacts  in  terms  of  internal  efficiency  improvements,\nenhanced quality of education, improved institutional capabilities, and improved equity. A\nPPMS  specialist  provided  through  the  associated  TA  will  assist  the  PMT  in  developing\nand implementing the PPMS.\n\n92.\nThe  PPMS  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  existing  education  management\ninformation  system  (EMIS)  of  ED  to  ensure  continued  monitoring  and  evaluation  of\nproject  performance  after  project  completion.  To  measure  project  performance  during\nthe  implementation  and  operational  periods  of  the  Project,  the  PPMS  will  use  a  set  of\nOVIs  largely  based  on  the  performance  indicators  specified  in  the  project  framework.\nBaseline  or  benchmark  values  of  the  OVIs  will  be  determined  at  the  beginning  of  the\n\n                                                \n16 Separate audit opinion on the use of imprest accounts and SOE should be included in the annual audit\n\nreport.\n\n\f23\n\nimplementation  period.  Qualitative  or  quantitative  information  on  the  OVIs  will  be\ncollected periodically, i.e., annually for most educational efficiency and equity indicators.\nThe  Project\u2019s  outputs  and  development  impacts  will  be  evaluated  and  monitored\ncontinuously by the PMT.\n\n93.\nIn developing and making the PPMS operational, special focus will be placed on\nthe  needs  of  underserved  and  marginalized  groups.  The  impact  on  poverty  reduction\nand  social  mobility  will  receive  particular  focus.  Although  equity  by  gender  does  not\nappear to be an issue in Samoa, it is important to pay attention to criteria that capture\ngender-related impacts generated by the Project.\n\nb.\n\nMidterm Review\n\n94.\nA  comprehensive  midterm  review  of  the  Project  will  be  undertaken  by  the\nGovernment  and  ADB  at  about  the  end  of  the  second  year  of  project  implementation.\nUsing  the  PPMS  and  other  measures,  the  review  will  assess  the  progress  and\nachievements of the Project against its objectives, identify difficulties being encountered,\nand recommend remedial actions if required.\n\nF.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n95.\nThe Treasury Department has extensive experience with ADB-financed projects\nand an established reputation for its strong capacity in project implementation.  ED has\nexperience with externally assisted projects. The Project includes adequate input of loan\nconsultants  for  project  management  support.    Additional  consulting  services  will  be\nprovided  under  an  associated  TA  to  further  enhance  ED\u2019s  long-term  capacity  for\nappraisal  and  design  of  investment  programs/projects  as  well  as  project  performance\nevaluation.  ED  is  also  implementing  a  major  AusAID-financed  institutional  capacity\nbuilding program designed to strengthen its internal management skills and processes.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n96.\nA  review  of  the  environmental  implications  of  the  Project  showed  no  significant\nadverse  environmental  impact.    Building  construction  for  the  Project  will  comprise\nprimarily  rehabilitation  of  existing  structures  involving  little  potential  for  adverse\nenvironmental  impact.    On  the  positive  side,  the  rehabilitation  will  eliminate  structurally\nunsound and unsafe buildings and, through the reconstruction of toilet facilities, lead to a\nmore  hygienic  and  healthy  environment.    New  buildings  for  the  Project  will  be  sited,\ndesigned,  and  constructed  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment\nRequirements and Environmental Review Procedures  and  other  appropriate  building\nand safety standards.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Issues\n\n97.\nThe congestion of the Malifa schools, which will be addressed by the Project, has\nsignificant social implications. There is a perception by the parents that the Government\nschools  in  Malifa  provide  better  education  than  the  local  schools.    As  a  consequence,\nparents  are  prepared  to  have  their  children  travel  long  distances  to  attend  school  at\nMalifa or, in some cases, move the family or board students with relatives in Apia, so the\n\n\f24\n\nchildren  can  be  enrolled  at  Malifa.    Apart  from  causing  severe  overcrowding  at  Malifa\nschools,  this  causes  serious  social  disruption.    The  movement  of  families  to  the  Apia\narea  also  contributes  to  urban  drift.  A  further  consequence  of  the  exodus  of  students\nfrom  community  schools  is  a  deterioration  of  the  operational  viability  and  educational\nquality  of  the  community  schools  because  of  reduced  enrollments  and  consequently\nreduced  fee  revenue.    The  students  who  remain  in  community  schools  are  therefore\nfurther disadvantaged.\n\nFacilities  and  resources  provided  through  the  Project  to  primary  and  secondary\n98.\nschools  will  make  the  quality  of  education  available  in  the  community  schools  at  least\nequal to that available in Malifa schools.  It is expected that as parents\u2019 awareness of the\nimproved  quality  of  education  increases  through  word  of  mouth  and  public  awareness\ncampaigns, there will be less pressure on the parents to enroll their children in the Malifa\nschools.  The provision of high quality education at the satellite schools and the district\nJSSs  is  therefore  expected  to  relieve  the  current  social  disruption  and  lead  to  more\nequitable access to quality education throughout the country.\n\nV.\n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\n99.\nThe Government has requested that a grant be provided for technical assistance\nfor  Education  Support  to  assist  in  capacity  building  in  the  education  sector.    The\nobjective  of  the  TA  is  to  enhance  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  ED  in  developing\nand maintaining the education system. The TA will assist the policy reforms program of\nthe Government in the education sector by supporting improvements in planning, quality,\nefficiency, and sustainability. It will complement project activities through its support for\nproject  development  and  monitoring,  educational  quality  improvements,  and  the\nmaintenance of assets developed through the Project.\n\nThe  TA  aims  at  improving  ED\u2019s  capability  in  some  of  its  key  areas  of\n100.\nresponsibility.  With  respect  to  educational  development  projects,  the  TA  will  improve\nED\u2019s capacity in (i) preparation, planning, design and implementation; (ii) monitoring and\nperformance evaluation; and (iii) promotion and community participation.  With regard to\nsystem  quality  and  performance,  the  TA  will  improve  ED\u2019s  capacity  in  (i)  resource\nplanning;  (ii)  development  of  in-service  teacher  training  programs;  (iii)  development  of\nstandard  requirements  for  educational  equipment;  (iv)  development  of  standard\nrequirements  for  library  resources;  and  (v)  preparation  of  programs  for  inspection,\nplanning,  budgeting,  and  maintenance  of  school  buildings.  About  28  person-months  of\ninternational  and  2  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  needed  to\ncarry  out  the  TA.  Consultants  will  provide  expertise  in  (i)  project  preparation  and\ndevelopment, (ii) project performance monitoring, (iii) community awareness campaigns,\n(iv) educational planning, (v) in-service teacher training, (vi) educational equipment, (vii)\nlibrary  resources,  and  (viii)  maintenance  of  education  facilities.    ADB  will  engage\nconsultants for the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $988,000 equivalent, including $797,400\n101.\nin  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $190,600  equivalent  in  local  currency.    ADB  will  provide\n$820,000 equivalent on a grant basis, from the ADB-funded TA program to finance the\nentire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  part  ($22,600  equivalent)  of  the  local  currency  cost.\nThe  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $168,000  equivalent,  mostly  in  kind.    The\ncost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA  are  in\nAppendix 12.\n\n\f25\n\nVI.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\n102.\nThe  Project  will  significantly  enhance  internal  efficiency  and  improve  the  quality\nof education in the primary and secondary subproject schools. These schools will serve\nas models for other public sector schools. Through its design and linkage with other aid-\nassisted interventions, the Project will help improve institutional efficiency in the sector. It\nwill  also  improve  equity  in  access  to  quality  primary  and  secondary  education  and\nthereby produce social or equity-related benefits. Lastly, a better qualified workforce will\nlead  to  enhanced  general  productivity,  which  is  critical  to  faster  and  more  balanced\neconomic development in the rural and urban areas of the Samoan economy.\n\nA.\n\nSocioeconomic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nGovernance Dimensions\n\nThe  Education  Strategic  Plan  is  a  cornerstone  in  the  broader  economic  reform\n103.\nprogram  as  described  in  the  latest  SES.  The  Government  has  reiterated  its  strong\ncommitment to economic reform in general and reemphasized the strategic importance\nof improving education and health standards as a critical factor for a better quality of life\nfor  all  Samoans.  Against  this  backdrop  and  given  the  overall  favorable  governance\nenvironment, the ADB sector Project provides a window of opportunity to further promote\nimproved governance in public education through devolution of education services and\nmore effective and efficient overall and financial management in the community schools.\n\n104. One key strategy to improve governance in a decentralized system is to devolve\nresponsibility  for  provision  of  public  services  to  the  lowest  appropriate  level  of\ngovernment. The Project will be instrumental in the effort to decentralize the delivery of\npublic  education  services  in  the  schools  in  Malifa  to  the  local  community.    School\nmanagement of the new Apia elementary school will become the responsibility of a SC\nfrom the local communities. This devolution will enhance equity, and promote community\nparticipation and accountability.\n\n105.\nThe  public  schools  outside  Malifa  that  will  be  upgraded  under  the  Project  are\nmanaged  by  local  communities.  The  resource  agreement  between  the  school  and  ED\nwill  provide  an  effective  mechanism  to  reduce  or  eliminate  inconsistencies  in  the\nmanagement  of  school  resources.  The  capabilities  of  the  SCs  in  educational  and\nfinancial management will be strengthened under the Project in close coordination with\nthe AusAID-financed ISP. This intervention will greatly enhance the level of transparency\nand accountability at the SC level.\n\n106.\nThe  Project  will  also  provide  an  opportunity  to  strengthen  the  partnership\nbetween  ED  and  the  subproject  SCs  in  the  management  of  public  primary  and\nsecondary  schools.  Through  the  local  SCs,  the  communities  retain  considerable\nindependence  relating  to  school  management.  The  dialogue  and  closer  cooperation\nbetween ED and the SCs will promote decision making by the community, in a manner\nfully consistent with specified ED policies. As a result of increased awareness, SCs will\nbe  better  equipped  to  address  the  issues  of  dropouts  and  exclusion  due  the  parents\u2019\ninability to pay school fees.\n\n\f26\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Justification\n\n107. A key factor in the economic justification of the Project is the social demand for\nbasic  education.  While  education  is  compulsory  for  the  aged  5-14  years  group,\nenrollment of that age group was only 94.3 percent of the school-age population in 1994.\nMore recently, Non Government Organizations reported that about 2 percent of school-\nage children, including those with special needs, never attend school. The dropout rate\nis  estimated  to  be  of  a  similar  magnitude.  The  Project  has  a  built-in  mechanism  to\npromote schooling for all school-age children, especially in the rural project schools, thus\nensuring that the social demand for basic education will be fully met.\n\n108. While  no  attempt  has  been  made  to  date  to  estimate  the  private  and  social\nreturns  to  investment  in  primary  and  secondary  education,  there  is  pervasive  evidence\nfrom  pertinent  research  that  formal  basic  education  is  socially  and  economically  more\nprofitable than any other form of education. Rates of return to investment in education at\nvarious  educational  levels  are  generally  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of\ncapital. Through its focus on primary and secondary education, the Project is expected\nto  lay  a  stronger  foundation  for  students  at  the  basic  level,  which  can  result  in  higher\ntransition  rates  to  postsecondary  education.  This  better  educated  and  more  qualified\ngroup will eventually enjoy higher private returns from employment in the formal public\nand private sector in Samoa. A large proportion of postsecondary graduates emigrate to\nwork  abroad,  resulting  in  considerable  amount  of  remittances  flowing  back  to  the\nSamoan economy. This alone is a significant macroeconomic justification for the Project.\n\n109. Given the Project\u2019s main focus on infrastructure improvement, there was limited\nscope  for  applying  cost-effectiveness  analysis.  Instead,  least-cost  choices  were\nascertained  and  measures  to  increase  cost-efficiency  were  incorporated  in  the  project\ndesign. The least-cost alternative is based on minimum acceptable standards developed\nby  ED.  The  application  of  these  standards  results  in  educationally  functional  buildings,\nand the simple construction will result in minimum maintenance costs. An important cost-\nsaving measure is the proposed design and construction supervision work by PWD staff,\nwhich  has  adequate  expertise  to  perform  this  task  at  the  least  cost.  The  25  percent\ncommunity contribution (mainly through the supply of labor) to the civil works component\nis another major cost-effective measure.\n\n110.\nThe Project aims at reducing overcrowding in the Malifa schools and enhancing\ngreater  access  to  quality  primary  and  secondary  schools  in  the  greater  Apia  area,  the\nrural areas in Upolu, and on the island of Savaii. By reducing travel distances and travel\ntime  for  a  large  number  of  project  beneficiaries,  significant  economic  benefits  (savings\non transport costs and time savings) will be realized.\n\n3.\n\nInternal Efficiency\n\n111. All educational inputs needed to ensure internal efficiency have been considered.\nAbout  70  percent  of  the  Project\u2019s  total  base  cost  will  be  spent  on  upgrading  of  school\nfacilities (rehabilitation of existing buildings, school expansion, furniture and equipment)\nwhile  15  percent  will  go  into  software  inputs,  including  curriculum  materials,  library\nresources, and in-service teacher training. Improved facilities in the JSSs, and provision\nof  adequate  instructional  materials,  will  expedite  implementation  of  the  new  full\nsecondary  curriculum.  Well-trained  teachers  will  be  able  to  deliver  the  new  curriculum\nthereby  improving  educational  attainment  and  achievement  in  the  subproject  schools.\n\n\f27\n\nMoreover,  the  provision  of  complementary  resources  for  specialized  subjects  in\nneighboring  schools  will  be  one  factor  in  improving  internal  efficiency.  Other  externally\nfunded  educational  interventions  will  also  be  providing  software  inputs  (curriculum\ndevelopment,  instructional  materials,  teacher  training,  and  strengthening  of  school\nmanagement)  to  the  subproject  schools  financed  by  the  ADB  Project.  The  AusAID-\nfinanced  ISP  aims  at  strengthening  school  management  (SC,  headmasters,  principals,\nand  school  inspectors)  and  the  administrative/managerial  and  instructional  processes,\nwhich  are  the  key  link  between  educational  inputs  and  educational  outcomes.  AusAID\nhas  agreed  to  coordinate  its  effort  in  this  area  with  the  implementation  of  subproject\nschools  development  so  that  the  SC  for  each  subproject  school  will  receive  adequate\ntraining and assistance.\n\nThere  appears  to  be  a  shortage  of  teachers  in  the  public  education  system,\n112.\nespecially in specialized subject areas. There is a need for vacancies to be filled more\nexpeditiously.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  improve  planning  and  coordination\nbetween ED, the Public Service Commission, and NUS where the large majority of new\nteachers  are  trained.  An  education  planning  specialist  for  the  associated  TA  will  assist\nED  to  prepare  a  medium-term  plan  for  the  adequate  deployment  of  suitably  trained\nteachers  to  meet  the  continuing  needs  of  the  public  primary  and  secondary  education\nsubsector.    The  TA  consultant  will  also  assess  the  existing  incentive  structure  for\nteachers and make appropriate recommendations.\n\n113. As a result of the global input mix and a well-balanced combination of hardware\nand  software  components,  the  Project  will  generate  three  major  educational  output\ncategories.    First,  higher  educational  attainment  levels  will  be  achieved  through  higher\nenrollment  rates  in  primary  schools,  reduced  dropout  of  students  in  primary  and\nsecondary  schools,  and  higher  transition  rates.  Second,  the  Project  will  lead  to  higher\ncognitive achievement as more students are expected to perform better in the Samoan\nSchool  Certificate  Examination  (Year  8),  the  Year  11  national  examination,  and  the\nPacific Senior Secondary Certificate examination. Third, with greater access to primary\nand  secondary  education  in  the  rural  areas,  noncognitive  achievement  (assessed  in\nterms  of  cultural  values,  attitudes,  and  behavior)  is  expected  to  improve.  This  is  an\nimportant factor in the cultural context of the Samoan society.\n\n4.\n\nSector Institutional Efficiency\n\nthe  Project  will  strengthen \n\n114. Several  key  criteria  were  considered  in  assessing  the  Project\u2019s  institutional\ndevelopment impacts at the sector and national levels. First, as the Project is an integral\npart  of  an  ongoing  education  reform  program,  it  provides  a  window  of  opportunity  for\nadditional  policy  dialogue  and  an  improved  environment  for  further  reform.  More\ninstitutional\nspecifically, \narrangements and processes. Second, the Project will result in enhanced capability and\nmanagerial efficiency of counterpart staff in ED. Project and TA consultants will provide\nstructured  and  nonstructured  training  for  ED  staff  in  subproject  preparation,  appraisal,\nand implementation techniques. Third, the Project will strengthen information resources\nmanagement  through  the  project-related  PPMS  and  its  integration  in  the  EMIS.  Lastly,\nthe  Project  provides  an  opportunity  for  the  Government  and  ED  to  strengthen\ncoordination  and  collaboration  with  other  government  agencies  (particularly  PWD)  and\nwith  aid  agencies  (particularly  AusAID  and  NZODA)  that  provide  educational  inputs\ncritical to the Project\u2019s performance.\n\nthe  existing  agencies  and \n\n\f28\n\n5.\n\nSustainability\n\n115. Except  for  the  schools  in  Malifa,  all  subproject  schools  will  be  public  schools\nowned and managed by the local communities through a SC.  The communities will be\nfully  involved  in  the  design  and  specification  of  facilities  needed  for  their  schools.  This\nwill enhance community ownership and commitment in the development of their schools.\nTheir  financial  and  in-kind  support  for  the  development  of  their  schools  will  promote\nsustainability.  The  financial  commitment  for  each  subproject  school  will  be  about  25\npercent of the cost of improvement works. While the community contribution could be in\ncash,  it  is  expected  to  be  mainly  in  kind,  in  particular  supply  of  nonskilled  and  skilled\nlabor  and  supply  of  building  materials.  Field  observations  have  confirmed  that  a  25\npercent  contribution  in  kind  will  be  affordable  to  the  communities.  While  the  share  of\nbeneficiary subproject schools in total project cost is about 14 percent, the government\u2019s\nshare  will  be  16  percent  or  $1.65  million  equivalent  spread  over  the  four-year  project\nimplementation period. Annually the required development expenditure will be included\nin  ED\u2019s  budget;  this  level  of  counterpart  funding  is  judged    affordable    to  the\nGovernment.\n\n116.\nThrough the resource agreement, the SC of each subproject school will commit\nto  a  maintenance  program  for  the  new  upgraded  facilities,  which  is  an  important\nsustainability  factor.  It  is  expected  that  other  recurrent  costs  (electricity,  water  supply,\nadministrative  expenses)  will  increase  and  the  communities  will  therefore  need  to\nmobilize more financial revenues through adjustments in the school fees and community\nfund  raising.  The  SC  financial  management  capabilities  will  be  strengthened  through\nimplementation  of  a  financial  management  development  program.  On  the  other  hand,\ncertain  incremental  recurrent  expenditure  (IRC)  (mainly  salaries  of  additional  teachers\nneeded  and  instructional  materials)  will  be  borne  by  ED.  The  share  of  recurrent\nexpenditure on education (all subsectors) in total recurrent government expenditures has\nsteadily increased from 9 percent in 1991/92 to about 14.4 percent in 1997/98. The IRC\nis estimated to be less than 1 percent of annual recurrent expenditure on education and\nis fiscally affordable.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1.\n\nProject Beneficiaries\n\n117. About  10,000-12,000  students  will  benefit  from  the  increased  access  to  an\nimproved  learning  environment  in  public  primary  and  secondary  schools.  The  direct\nbeneficiaries  include  about  600  teachers  who  will  receive  in-service  training  and  will\nbenefit from improved teaching resources and a more conducive learning environment.\nAbout  20  ED  staff  will  be  trained  by  project  consultants.  Other  direct  beneficiaries  are\nabout 300 members of SCs who will benefit from training in maintenance and financial\nmanagement practices provided through the TA and the Project\u2019s linkage to the ISP.\n\n2.\n\nEquity Considerations\n\n118. Gender is not an issue in enrollment. The gender balance of school enrollments\ngenerally reflects the gender situation emerging from census data (52 percent male and\n48 percent female for the 0-14 age group). There is a slight tendency for females to stay\nin school longer and perform better than males. In terms of academic achievement, girls\nas a group do better then boys at the Year 8 national examinations. The Year 8 to Year\n\n\f29\n\n9 transition rate (1999 data) for girls was 83 percent compared with 77 percent for boys.\nThe  number  of  females  with  Pacific  Senior  Secondary  Certificate  increased  from  52\npercent  in  1994  to  55  percent  of  all  certificate  holders  in  1998.  At  the  school  staffing\nlevel,  women  outnumber  men  by  about  2:1.  In  1998  female  teachers  accounted  for  72\npercent at the primary level and about 50 percent at the secondary.\n\n119.\nTwo important equity considerations are built into the Project. The first relates to\nresolving the  overcrowding  problem at the Malifa schools and the other is to make the\nfull  range  of  secondary  school  subjects  more  widely  available.  The  Project  will\nrehabilitate  and  provide  high-quality  education  in  the  satellite  schools  in  the  Apia  area,\nwill  eliminate  overcrowding  at  Malifa,  and  reduce  the  related  social  disruption.  At  the\nsame  time,  it  will  provide  students  with  equal  access  to  quality  primary  and  secondary\neducation  through  their  local  schools.  Upgrading  of  the  district  JSSs  will  improve  their\nfacilities and resources and allow them to provide quality education in a wider range of\nsubjects.  Vocational  subjects  will  be  part  of  the  newly  introduced  curriculum.  On  the\nwhole,  this  will  increase  secondary  educational  opportunities  in  the  districts  to  a  level\nequal to or higher than those in the Apia area.\n\n120.\nThe  project  framework  includes  three  specific  equity-related  outputs  with  a\ncorresponding  set  of  performance  indicators  and  monitoring  mechanisms.  The  outputs\nare  (i)  improved  access  of  children  from  less  well-off  families  to  quality  primary  and\nsecondary  education,  (ii)  improved  access  of  children  with  special  needs  to  quality\nprimary  and  secondary  education,  and  (iii)  more  balanced  distribution  of  educational\nfacilities  in  rural  areas  (Upolu)  and  on  the  island  of  Savaii.  Appendix  13  presents  a\nsummary  assessment  of  the  poverty  content  of  the  Project  based  on  a  list  of  12\nbenchmark  criteria.  The  assessment  shows  that  the  Project  scores  well  on  almost  all\ncriteria.     \n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n121.\nThere is a risk that SCs of the prioritized subproject schools may not be willing to\nparticipate and sign a resource agreement committing the community to participation in\nschool  improvement.  Safeguard  measures  to  minimize  this  risk  are  as  follows:  (i)\nparticipation  in  the  Project  is  not  compulsory,  and  only  schools  that  show  a  strong\nwillingness  and  commitment  to  participate  will  be  selected  for  more  in-depth  appraisal;\n(ii)  in  recent  years  many  schools  have  contributed  to  aid-sponsored  school  building\nprograms; (iii) the community will be allowed to contribute in kind (mainly labor) and this\ncontribution will amount to about 25 percent of the improvement cost; and (iv) the Project\nwill provide support to implement the management and maintenance program.\n\nThe  Government  is  firmly  committed  to  implement  the  restructuring  plan  for  the\n122.\nMalifa  schools  and  to  carry  out  decentralization  as  soon  as  possible.  Because  of  the\nhistoric importance of Malifa and the public perception that Malifa schools offer the best\nquality  public  education  in  Samoa,  there  is  a  risk  that  the  community  will  oppose  the\nrestructuring  plan. This risk is being minimized as follows. The local community will be\ngiven  the  responsibility  to  manage  the  schools.  A  public  awareness  campaign  is  being\ndeveloped  to  familiarize  the  people  with  the  concept  and  purpose  of  the  proposed\nsatellite schools to provide quality education to a larger number of students.\n\n123.\nThere  is  also  a  risk  that  ED  may  lack  experience  in  the  implementation  of  an\nADB-funded  sector  loan.  This  risk  will  be  minimized  by  setting  up  a  strong  PMT,\n\n\f30\n\nproviding substantial project implementation support.  Also, ADB assistance to prepare a\ncore  subproject  during  loan  processing  will  provide  a  good  example  for  PMT  to  follow.\nFurthermore,  TD  has  extensive  experience  with  ADB-funded  projects  and  can  provide\nED with the required assistance in day-to-day administration of the project.\n\n124.\nIn view of limited resources in PWD, there is a risk that PWD may not be able to\nprovide  its  intended  services  in  a  timely  manner.  The  selection  of  PWD  is  a  least-cost\nsolution  and  justified  as  the  availability  of  a  reliable  and  competent  private  sector\nproviders is limited. PWD has shown a strong commitment to TD to provide the required\narchitectural services in a timely manner. Moreover, the subproject works are relatively\nsmall and building construction works are simple and standardized. Finally, should PWD\nnot  be  able  to  deliver  services  in  a  timely  manner,  TD  has  indicated  that  it  would\noutsource  these  services  from  the  private  sector,  even  at  a  higher  cost,  so  as  to  keep\nthe Project on track.\n\n125. Availability of land is not an issue as school expansion, if required, will be on land\nbelonging  to  the  community.  Timely  provision  of  Government  counterpart  funding  and\ncommunity contribution are also not considered a risk as full community involvement is\nexpected and as the needed Government counterpart funds will be budgeted annually.\nThe  IRC  after  project  implementation  will  be  very  small  and  will  be  easily  absorbed  by\nED\u2019s  recurrent  budget.  Internal  efficiency  risks  are  also  considered  low.  The  Project  is\nlikely  to  require  only  a  small  number  of  additional  teachers.  NUS  has  the  capacity  to\nsupply  more  teachers.  Moreover,  FoE  will  start  a  4-year  Bachelor  of  Education  (BEd)\nprogram  by  2001  and  teachers  with  BEd  degree  will  be  better  qualified  and  have  a\nstronger financial incentive to start and continue work as teachers.  Since teachers with\nBEd  will  be  paid  a  much  higher  salary  than  teachers  holding  only  a  diploma,  it  is\nexpected that intake at FoE will increase and the higher expected output of teachers will\nease  the  existing  shortage  of  qualified  teachers  in  the  public  primary  and  secondary\nschools.\n\nVII.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard\n\n126.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  terms  of  reference  and  guiding  principles  of  the  Education  Steering\nCommittee  and  associated  Education  Infrastructure  Coordination  Subcommittee\nestablished for the purposes of ED\u2019s ISP will be modified to reflect the additional\nresponsibility of providing policy guidance and advice on the Project.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  objective  of  eliminating  overcrowding  in  Malifa  as  laid\ndown  in  the  Government\u2019s  Statement of Economic Strategy 2000-2001,  the\nGovernment  will  consolidate  the  three  existing  primary  schools  at  Malifa  \u2013  Apia\nLower, Apia Middle and Leififi Intermediate -- into a single primary school.  Total\nenrollment at the Malifa Primary School will be reduced gradually to a maximum\nof 750 at the beginning of the 2004 school year.  Enrollment at Leififi College will\nbe  reduced  to  a  maximum  of  750  at  the  beginning  of  the  2005  school  year.\nResponsibility for school management, at least in the case of the primary school,\nwill be devolved from ED to a formally constituted SC.\n\n\f31\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)\n\n(ix)\n\nThe  Government  will  establish  a  project  management  team  headed  by  the\nassistant director (Corporate Services) of ED, who will be designated as project\nmanager.    Full-time  staff  of  the  project  management  team  will  include  a  project\nadministration  officer,  a  project  development  officer/procurement  coordinator,\nand a project accountant.\n\nThe  Government  will  cause  PWD  to  be  contracted  by  the  project  management\nteam  to  provide  all  such  architectural/building  design  and  supervision  of\nconstruction  services  as  may  be  required  in  formulating  and  carrying  out  the\nsubprojects.  PWD will provide these services in a timely manner to ensure that\nproject implementation proceeds according to the schedule agreed upon by the\nGovernment  and  ADB.    If  for  any  reason  PWD  is  unable  to  provide  in  a  timely\nmanner  any  part  of  these  services,  the  Government  will  promptly  instruct  and\nauthorize ED to outsource such activities to the private sector.\n\nOther than the satellite schools in the vicinity of Malifa and the schools in Malifa\nthat are to be restructured, the Government will give preference to less favored\nareas when selecting the subproject schools.\n\nis \n\nThroughout  the  life  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  each\nthe\nimplemented \nsubproject \nGovernment\u2019s  ongoing  program  of  reforms  in  education,  particularly  those\nreforms  enumerated  in  the  Government\u2019s  Education Policies 1995-2005  and\nEducation Strategies 1995-2005.\n\nfull  compliance  with \n\nformulated  and \n\nin \n\nEach primary and secondary school considered for improvement as a subproject\nschool  will  be  evaluated  by  a  subproject  preparation  team.    The  team  will  have\nthe  project  development  officer/procurement  coordinator  of \nthe  project\nmanagement team as team leader, and others representing the Building Division\nof PWD and the Curriculum Development Division of ED.  For an initial period of\nsix  months,  the  subproject  preparation  team  will  be  assisted  by  the  project\ndevelopment  specialist  under  the  associated  TA.  The  team  will  prepare  a\nsubproject  appraisal  report  (SAR)  for  each  subproject,  working  in  collaboration\nwith the SC of the relevant school.\n\nEach SAR will be reviewed and approved by the Education Steering Committee\nbefore  a  recommendation  for  approval  of  the  subproject  is  submitted  to  ADB\nthrough the financial secretary of TD.\n\nNo  subproject  will  be  recommended  for  approval  until  the  Government  and  the\nrelevant  SC  have  entered  into  a  resource  agreement  stipulating  agreements\nreached with regard to\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nfinancing of the subproject,\n\nimplementation  arrangements,  particularly  the  contributions  to  be  made\nby the SC,\n\nother things that the SC will do in conjunction with the implementation of\nthe subproject including\n\n\f32\n\n\u2022  establishing  a  maintenance  program  for  school  facilities  with  a\n\n\u2022 \n\nguaranteed budget for a dedicated maintenance fund;\nimplementing  a  management  development  program  to  strengthen\nmanagement practices and procedures of the school and the SC;\n\u2022  maintaining a uniform policy with respect to the admission of students\n\n\u2022 \n\nand fees charged, regardless of students\u2019 domicile; and\nreviewing  and  adjusting  student    fees  to  maintain  revenue  at  a  level\nadequate to meet the school\u2019s expenditure requirements.\n\n(x)\n\nThe  Government  will  take  all  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  all  subproject\nschools  are  adequately  staffed  with  suitably  qualified  teachers,  and  that  in  the\nevent  of  any  staff  vacancy,  such  vacancy  will  be  promptly  filled.    The\nGovernment will also use its best efforts, making use of its own funding sources\nor actively pursuing bilateral sources of aid funding, to ensure that suitable and\ncontinuing  in-service  training  is  made  available  to  the  teaching  staff  of  all\nsubproject schools\n\nVIII.

In the course of preparatory work\nfor the Project, the resources of many potential project schools were reviewed and assessed\nagainst agreed-upon criteria in terms of the schools\u2019 potential for upgrading and the benefits\nlikely  to  be  derived  from  such  upgrading.    This  work  resulted  in  a  prioritized  list  of\nprospective  project  schools1  with  sufficient  data  to  allow  a  broad  estimate  of  the  likely\nindividual costs of their upgrading.\n\n2.\nThe actual number of schools to be upgraded will be limited by the available funds\nand  will  be  determined  only  after  detailed  specification  and  costing  of  the  upgrading\nrequirements  of  individual  schools  have  been  carried  out.  A  work  program  including  the\nsequence  of  implementation  of  subprojects,  their  priority,  and  the  tentative  schedule  of\nimplementation  for  each,  will  be  prepared.  As  a  prerequisite  to  the  development  and\nappraisal  of  subprojects,  the  Government  will  review  the  work  program,  selection  criteria,\nand application of the criteria to confirm a prioritized list of probable project schools.\n\n3.\nEach  primary  and  secondary  school  considered  as  a  project  school  will  be\nreevaluated  and  ranked  by  the  subproject  preparation  team  (SPT)  on  the  basis  of  the\neligibility criteria.

For  those\ncriteria, the SPT will have to satisfy the ESC that the agreement reached with the school is\nlikely to lead to the desired improvements in the overall quality and efficiency of education in\nthe school.\n\n5.\nThe upgrading and extension work to be carried out at individual satellite schools will\ndepend on the role of the school in the overall education development plan, and the school\u2019s\ncapability to accommodate students to be relocated from the downsized Malifa schools. The\nextent  of  the  works  will  be  determined  by  the  Education  Department  (ED)  based  on\npreliminary assessment work carried out by the SPT, and guidance provided by the ESC.\n\n6.\nExcept for the satellite schools and the Government schools in Malifa, the Borrower\nwill  give  preference  to  less  economically  favored  areas  when  selecting  the  subproject\nschools.\n\nB.\n\nAppraisal and Approval of Subprojects\n\n7.\nThe  project  management  team  (PMT)  will  establish  the  SPT  comprising  the  project\ndevelopment officer, one representative from the Curriculum Division of ED, and at least one\nperson  from  the  Building  Division  of  the  Public  Works  Department  (PWD).    Working  in\nconsultation with the relevant SCs and using other professional inputs as required, the SPT\nwill prepare a subproject appraisal report (SAR) for each subproject. The SAR will contain\nthe justification for and details of the proposed subproject, and the terms and conditions of\nthe resource agreement between ED and the SC.\n\n8.\nThe SAR with its two attachments, (i) Resource Agreement and (ii) Recommendation\nfor  Approval  of  Subproject,  will  be  submitted  through  the  Education  Infrastructure\nCoordination  Sub-Committee  (EICSC) \nfor  review  and  approval.

Have the causes of poverty been identified?\n\n2. How does the Project address the causes of\n\npoverty generally?\n\n3. Has the project in the choice of site explicitly\n\naddressed poverty reduction?\n\n4. How does the Project design explicitly\n\naddress poverty reduction?\n\n5. Is the Project linked to poverty-focused\n\npolicy reforms?\n\n6. Is the Project linked to poverty-focused\n\nlegislation?\n\n7. Is the project linked to poverty-focused\n\ninstitution building?\n\n8. Is the project design developed so as to\n\nreduce possible adverse impacts on poor\npeople?\n\n9. Does project background data allow the\nassessment of the poverty situation in\ngeneral and of the target groups in\nparticular?\n\n10. Has impact distribution assessment been\n\ndone?\n\n11. Has benefit assessment been carried out?\n\n12. Is the Project designed as an integral part\nof a package of an integrated assistance\nprogram?\n\nCauses of relative poverty, vulnerability, and\npoverty of opportunity are identified in the\nbackground section.\nThrough more equitable access to quality\nprimary education  and to quality secondary\neducation, with increasing emphasis on\nvocational subjects\nYes, through selection as subprojects of district\nJSS schools and primary schools in the less\nwell-off rural areas (Upolu) and on the island of\nSavai\u2019i.\nA Government program ensures that poor\nstudents do not pay school fees, by avoiding\ndropouts through waiver of fees, and by\nenrolling all village children in primary schools.\nYes, by ensuring that children of compulsory\nschool age are not excluded from school\nbecause of nonpayment of school fees.\nYes. Existing legislation allows poor families to\napply to the Education Department for fee\nwaiver. School principals and teachers are to\nmake parents aware of this legislation.\nYes, through strengthened school\nmanagement in the rural subproject schools,\nwhich are the weaker schools attracting mainly\nstudents from the lower income families.\nNo need, as the project has only a positive\nimpact (through higher quality of education for\nall students) on the poverty situation.\nYes. However, the extent of poverty is not well\ndocumented in Samoa. Limited data is\navailable on families in rural areas who cannot\npay school fees for their children.\nYes, in general terms.
