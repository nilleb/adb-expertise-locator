The  TA  is  also  designed  to  help  promote  income-generating  livelihood \nopportunities for local communities in the northern region of the Maldives. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  Maldives  consists  of  1,190  coral  islands formed  by  20  natural  atolls  and  scattered \nover  90,000  square  kilometers  of  territory  in  the  Indian  Ocean,  making  it  one  of  the  most \ndispersed  countries  in  the  world.  The  country\u2019s  total  population  was  around  402,000  in  2014, \nwith  96%  of  the  population  distributed  across  188  administrative  islands,  123  of  which  are \noccupied by fewer than 1,000 people.3 These geographic and demographic characteristics pose \nmajor  development  challenges  in  the  country  in terms  of  infrastructure  development,  provision \nof basic social services, and access to equitable economic opportunities. \n \n4. \nIn 2014, 38% of the Maldives\u2019 population lived in and around Mal\u00e9, the capital city and \nurban center in the central region (footnote 3). Mal\u00e9 remains the country\u2019s fastest growing and \nmost  populated  city,  with  rapid  expansion  of  both  the  public  and  private  sectors  and \nestablishment  of  major  health  and  educational  facilities.  To  help  reduce  the  fiscal  burden,  the \nGovernment  of  the  Maldives  has  decided  to  further  develop  the  greater  Mal\u00e9  area  to \naccommodate  about  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  population.  This  development  is  expected  to  take \ntime, and in the meantime, the government views developments in remote atolls, which house \nthe remainder of the population, as critical to strengthening the country's economy. \n \nLack  of  transport  connectivity  is  a  major  constraint  to  the  country\u2019s  inclusive  and \n5. \nsustainable development goals in remote atolls, particularly in the northern region,4 which have \na  high  number  of  inhabitants  living  below  the  poverty  line. 5  Imbalances  in  accessibility  to \nopportunities, enterprise, markets, and services in the northern region constrain the government \nfrom  achieving  broad-based  economic  growth,  which  is  one  of  the  major  development  goals \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Kulhudhuffushi     \n   Harbor Expansion Project. \n3 Government of the Maldives, National Bureau of Statistics. 2014.

Mal\u00e9. \n\n \n \n\n\funder the Seventh National Development Plan, 2006\u20132010,6 and Manifesto of the Progressive \nParty of Maldives for 2013 to 2017.7 \n \n6. \nTo address the widening socioeconomic disparity in the northern region, the government \nis  developing  Kulhudhuffushi  Island  as  an  urban  center  where  services  and  socioeconomic \nactivities will be concentrated. Kulhudhuffushi is a major population center in the region, with a \npopulation  of  8,200  as  of  2014  (footnote  3).  Currently,  Kulhudhuffushi  is  home  to  the  regional \nhospital  that  provides  general  medical,  specialist,  dental,  emergency,  and  intensive  care \nservices. The island also houses primary, secondary, and tertiary education facilities, including \na  vocational  training  center,  designed  to  cater  to  approximately  2,500  students  from \nKulhudhuffushi and nearby islands. \n \nResidents  of  other  islands  travel  daily  to  Kulhudhuffushi  for  work,  use  of  the  island\u2019s \n7. \nhealth  and  education  facilities,  or  recreational  purposes,  reflecting  Kulhudhuffushi\u2019s  role  as  a \nkey regional maritime connection and cargo interchange point for the northern region. With the \nongoing development of Kulhudhuffushi as the northern region\u2019s urban center, the government \nhas  decided  that  the  existing  interisland  connectivity  in  the  region  will  be  inadequate  to  allow \nefficient  access  to  Kulhudhuffushi\u2019s  services  and  opportunities,  as  mandated  in  the  Seventh \nNational Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 (footnote 6). Therefore, the government envisioned that \nadditional  harbor  capacity  and  more  efficient  operation  will  be  required  at  Kulhudhuffushi \nHarbor. This expansion is expected to benefit around 30,000 inhabitants living in the dispersed \nouter islands within a 30-kilometer radius of Kulhudhuffushi. \n \n8. \nThe  multipurpose  Kulhudhuffushi  Harbor  is  currently  used  for  passenger  traffic,  bulk \ncargo  traffic,  commercial  fishing,  and  transport  of  agricultural  commodities.  The  proposed \nadditional  capacity  to  the  harbor  will  be  required  to  prevent  congestion,  reduce  delays  in \naccessing a berth and mooring facilities in the basin, and encourage new transport links either \nat  the  regional  or  national  level.  At  present  there  are  around  150  vessels  operating  out  of  the \nharbor every day. It is estimated that increasing the capacity to cater to at least 250 vessels per \nday  would  be  required  to  support  Kulhudhuffushi\u2019s  development  as  an  urban  center.  The \ngovernment  plans  to  increase  harbor  capacity  by  constructing  a  new  passenger  and  cargo \nharbor  to  cater  to  larger  vessels,  and  through  more  efficient  and  sustained  harbor  operation. \nThe new passenger harbor will also facilitate long-distance passenger service from the central \nand southern regions as recommended in the Maldives\u2019 Maritime Transport Master Plan.8 \n \n9. \nThe proposed project will bring about inclusive socioeconomic benefits to the inhabitants \nof  the  northern  region,  and  help  reduce  socioeconomic  disparities  between  the  central  and \nnorthern  regions.  It  aims  to  connect  services,  markets,  people,  and  harbors  through  an \nintegrated  transport  system  with  greater  accessibility  and  affordability  for  all  residents.  It  is \naligned with the strategic objective established in the interim country partnership strategy, 2016 \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to enhance movement of people and goods, including at \nthe regional level.9 \n \n\n                                                \n6  Government of the Maldives, Ministry of Planning and National Development. 2007.

The PMU will be \nresponsible for day-to-day project implementation and management, and it will report directly to \nthe  director  general  of  the  Infrastructure  Department  of  the  MHI.  The  PMU  will  consist  of  a \nproject director, a project officer, and a project accountant, who will all be recruited by the MHI \nusing  the  individual  consultant  selection  method.  The  project  director  of  the  PMU  will  be \ndelegated  technical  and  administrative  authority  for  expeditious  project  implementation.  The \nMHI  will  also  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  as  the  project  management  consultant \n(PMC) for general project management support, detailed design, procurement, and construction \nsupervision. For the PMC recruitment, consulting firms will be requested to submit a simplified \ntechnical  proposal,  and  the  selection  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nmethod,  using  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10.

To achieve this objective, the TA will (i) \ntrain  the  staff  of  the  Secretariat  of  the  Kulhudhuffushi  Council  and  the  staff  of  Public  Works \nServices in Kulhudhuffushi on sustainable harbor operation, maintenance, safety, and financial \nmanagement; (ii) implement a harbor safety campaign and conduct training for vessel drivers in \npassenger  safety;  (iii)  conduct  a  feasibility  study  and  recommend  action  plan  for  introducing \nharbor  user  charging  in  Kulhudhuffushi;  and  (iv)  train  local  residents  on  income-generating \nlivelihood  opportunities. 13 The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $543,200,  of  which  $500,000  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, logistical support, and other in-\nkind  contributions.  The  executing  agency  of  the  TA  will  be  the  MOFT  and  the  implementing \nagency  will  be  the  MHI.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  calendar-months,  from  January \n2017  to  June  2018.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  as  the  capacity  building \nconsultant. The recruitment will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. The consulting firm will be asked to submit a biodata technical proposal, and the \nselection  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  using  a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n19. \nThe project is considered viable based on due diligence and assessments of the costs, \nbenefits,  and  impacts.  It  will  benefit  the  islands  of  the  Maldives  by  improving  access  to \nsocioeconomic activities and services in the northern region. \n \nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n20. \nThe preliminary engineering design was completed during the project preparatory stage. \nThe design objective was to minimize environmental impacts by minimizing the project footprint, \nand  to  promote  cost  efficiency  while  meeting  the  increasing  travel  demand  in  the  northern \nregion.  The  harbor  area  comprises  a  main  basin  for  passenger  and  cargo  vessels  and  a \nmooring  area  for  smaller  boats.  The  proposed  expansion  comprises  (i)  construction  of \nbreakwaters,  a  quay  wall,  and  revetments;  and  (ii)  dredging  of  the  main  harbor  basin  up  to  4 \n\n                                                \n12  ADB. 2015.

Manila.  \n13   Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nmeters  below  mean  sea  level.  An  administrative  building  and  trading  facilities  are  included  as \npart  of  the  harbor\u2019s  ancillary  facilities.  Given  that  the  Maldives  is  a  low-lying  country,  the \npreliminary design considered the impacts of climate change such as the increase of the mean \nsea  level  and  storm  surges.  The  harbor  infrastructure  also  has  cost-effective  shore  protection \nfeatures to enhance resilience against such impacts. \n \n21. \nActions  during  the  project  preparatory  stage  to  improve  institutional  capacity  in  harbor \noperation, maintenance, safety, and financial management in Kulhudhuffushi will be addressed \nby the TA. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  analysis,  which  was  undertaken  according  to  ADB  guidelines, 14 concluded \n22. \nthat the project is economically viable.15 The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is \n12.70% and the economic net present value is $415,800. A discount rate of 12% was adopted \nfor the analysis. The economic analysis compared the benefits and costs of with- and without-\nproject situations. The potential benefits include travel time and cost savings for existing users \nof  the  harbor,  generated  demand  due  to  the  increased  connectivity,  operational  efficiency, \nemployment  benefits,  safety  benefits,  erosion  protection,  and  utilization  of  surplus  dredging \nmaterial. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the economic viability \nof  the  project  and  determine  the  impact  of  key  input  parameters  on  the  EIRR.  Ten  scenarios \nwere analyzed, which included delays in project implementation, an increase in capital costs, a \ndecrease  in  estimated  travel  demand,  and  decreases  in  key  economic  parameters. 16  The \nresults of the sensitivity analyses show that the EIRR is most sensitive to an unlikely scenario of \nan  increase  in  capital  costs,  and  that  variations  in  key  project  parameters\u2014including  an \nincrease in capital costs, project delays, and changes in key economic inputs\u2014would still render \nthe  project  economically  viable.  The  results  therefore  show  the  robustness  of  the  EIRR  with \nregard to reasonable changes in costs and benefits. Considering the overall contribution of the \nproject,  which  will  promote  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  in  the  northern  region  and  is \nexpected  to  deliver  significant  wider  unquantified  benefits  (especially  regarding  health, \neducation,  services,  and  employment  opportunities),  the  results  of  the  economic  analysis  are \nconsidered as conservative, and the integrated benefits of the project are expected to outweigh \nthe capital costs. \n \n23. \n The  Secretariat  of  the  Kulhudhuffushi  Council  is  responsible  for  the  cost  of  routine \nmaintenance  and  day-to-day  operation  of  Kulhudhuffushi  Harbor.  The  incremental  recurrent \ncosts for harbor operation and routine maintenance are estimated to be around Rf267,000 per \nyear. The Secretariat of the Kulhudhuffushi Council has committed to fund these costs through \nannual  budget  allocation  and  any revenue  that may  be generated from commercial  use  of the \nharbor. On the other hand, large-scale harbor maintenance, primarily dredging, is performed by \nPublic Works Services under the MHI, and financed under the MHI\u2019s annual budget for recurrent \nexpenditure.  Large-scale  harbor  maintenance  is  managed  by  the  MHI  and  is  given  priority \nbased on need, as assessed by its technical staff. The dredging costs for the harbor expansion \nare  expected  to  be  around  Rf2.7  million  every  5  years,  representing  only  2.9%  of  the  MHI\u2019s \nbudget.  MHI  historical  financial  information  in  2014  and  2015  shows  that  funds  released  for \nlarge-scale maintenance  and  upkeep  have  exceeded  the  initial  budget  allocations.  In  addition, \n\n                                                \n14  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n15  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  These are gross domestic product, value of time, travel cost, standard conversion factor, and shadow wage rate. \n\n\fthe  MHI  is  committed  to  adequately  maintaining  public  harbors  throughout  the  Maldives. 17 \nBased  on  the  analysis  of  the  incremental  recurrent  cost  and  the  government\u2019s  financial  ability \nand commitment to maintain all public harbors in the Maldives, it is likely that the operation and \nmaintenance  of  the  expanded  harbor  will  be  sustained.  While  the  proposed  passenger  and \ncargo harbor under the project will be operated free of port dues or cargo handling charges, the \nTA  attached  to  this  project  will  support  the  government  in  assessing  the  feasibility  of,  and \ndeveloping an action plan related to, introducing harbor user charging in Kulhudhuffushi in the \nfuture, which would help enhance sustainability of harbor operation. \n \nC. \n\n Governance \n\n24. \nInstitutional. The MHI has sufficient capacity to implement the project. The MHI was the \ntechnical agency responsible for contract supervision and approval of progress payments for the \nADB-funded  Domestic  Maritime  Transport  Project,  under  which  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  was \nconstructed.18 The experience gained from the development of 10 harbors funded by the Islamic \nDevelopment  Bank  has  further  strengthened  the  MHI\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  the  project. 19 \nCapacity development TA to be provided to the Secretariat of the Kulhudhuffushi Council, and \nthe Public Works Services will help sustain and streamline harbor operation and maintenance. \n \n25. \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  concludes  that  the \noverall financial management risk is moderate and suggests mitigation measures for key risks. It \nalso concludes that the MOFT and MHI have sufficient experience and capacity to manage the \nproject  funds  as  well  as  adequate  fund  flow,  accounting,  and  budgeting  arrangements. \nNotwithstanding this, the MHI requires to develop an internal audit function. In addition, the MHI \nalso  committed  to  (i)  ensure  adequate  counterpart  fund  allocation;  (ii)  with  ADB  support, \nconduct  training  in  ADB\u2019s  rules  and  regulations  in  disbursement,  financial  management,  and \nprocurement;  and  (iii)  appoint  a  dedicated  accountant  at  the  PMU.  The  proposed  fund  flow \narrangement  is  straightforward,  and  the  financial  management  arrangements  have  been \ndesigned  based  on  the  financial  management  assessment  results;  both  are  expected  to  be \nadequate. \n \n26. \nProcurement. The Tender Evaluation Section (TES) of the MOFT, in coordination with \nMHI as the line ministry, will carry out the procurement and consultant recruitment activities. An \nassessment  of  the  procurement  capacity  of  the  TES  and  MHI  shows  that  both  agencies  have \nthe  skilled  and  experienced  staff,  and  well-established  procedures  and  systems,  required  to \nmanage the procurement process. In the last 4 years, the TES and MHI have procured a total of \n37 civil works contracts for harbor projects funded by the government and external resources. In \naddition,  the  TES  in  the  last  2  years  has  procured  about  90  civil  works  contracts  for  projects \nfunded  by  the government, the Islamic  Development  Bank,  or the World  Bank.  However,  both \nagencies  have  limited  experience  in  ADB  procurement.  During  the  project  preparatory  stage, \nTES  and  MHI  staff  received  training  on  ADB  procurement.  During  the  project  implementation \nstage,  the  MHI,  as  the  implementing  agency,  will  be  supported  by  the  PMC  during  the \npreparation of bidding documents and the procurement of civil works. \n \n\n                                                \n17  The actual expenditures for large-scale harbor maintenance by the MHI were around 38% higher than the budget   \n\nallocation in 2014 and 53% higher in 2015. \n\n18   ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nMaldives for the Domestic Maritime Transport Project. Manila (Loan 2327-MLD). \n\n19  Cofinanced by the Saudi Fund for Development and the OPEC Fund for International Development. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n27. \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 10). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n28. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  economy  of  the  northern  region  is  mainly  based  on  fishing, \nagriculture,  transport,  and  trading  activities.  The  expanded  harbor  will  allow  those  living  in  the \nouter  islands  to  access  services  and  amenities  provided  in  Kulhudhuffushi  such  as  housing, \nsecondary  education,  quality  health  facilities,  and  financial  services.  For  residents  of \nKulhudhuffushi,  the  project  will  generate  employment-supporting  construction  activities  and \nincrease  opportunities  in  the  commercial  sector.  The  project  will  bring  about  inclusive \nsocioeconomic benefits for the inhabitants of Kulhudhuffushi and the northern region as a whole \nthrough  improving  the  island\u2019s  connectivity  to  regional  and  national  markets,  and  promoting \nlocal and visiting populations\u2019 access to key services. \n \nGender  and  development.  Women  residing  in  Kulhudhuffushi  have  direct  access  to \n29. \nhealth  and  education  facilities  and  are  active  in  the  civil  service  and  other  sectors.  The \nexpanded harbor will give women from the outer islands better access to higher education and \nspecialized health services, especially prenatal and postnatal support. The expanded harbor will \nalso  create  more  opportunities  for  women  entrepreneurs.  During  project  preparation,  findings \nfrom  meaningful  consultations  with  women  guided  the  design  of  practical  and  implementable \ngender-inclusive  features  that  include  (i)  integrating  features  friendly  to  the  elderly,  women, \nchildren,  and  the  disabled  in  the  designs  of  the  harbor,  including  separate  toilets  and  ablution \nand  prayer  facilities  for  male  and  female  passengers,  lighted  waiting  rooms,  and  disability-\nfriendly  access;  (ii)  mandating  that  two  of  the  five  members  of  the  grievance  redressal \ncommittee  are  women;  and  (iii)  including  a  provision  in  the  civil  works  contract  to  promote \ncompliance  with  all  applicable  labor  laws,  including  not  employing  child  labor  for  construction, \nencouraging increased employment of women and the local poor, and setting equal wages for \nmen and women for work of equal value. \n \n30. \nHealth  and  labor.  Based  on  findings  from  public  consultations  during  project \npreparation,  there  is  a  high  level  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  infection  awareness \namong  all  segments  of  the  population  in  Kulhudhuffushi.  This  is  due  to  the  high  number  of \ntargeted  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaigns  that  have  been  conducted  in  Kulhudhuffushi  by  the \ngovernment.  Ongoing  awareness  campaigns  organized  by  the  government\u2019s  Women\u2019s \nDevelopment  Committee  together  with  a  national-level  nongovernment  organization  have \nincluded (i) forming an alliance, and educating and building the capacity of parent stakeholder \ngroups; (ii) training young people as peer educators for drugs and HIV prevention on the island; \nand (iii) conducting a widespread door-to-door outreach and information dissemination program. \nThe civil works contractor will conduct semiannual awareness-building sessions for all workers \nin  a  form  and  language(s)  understandable  to  them.  Awareness-raising  materials  will  also  be \ndisplayed in strategic areas of the expanded harbor. The civil  works contractor will follow core \nlabor standards. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nEnvironment.  The  project  scope  includes  the  construction  of  a  harbor  for  passenger \nand cargo vessels on Kulhudhuffushi Island. There are no endangered species, unique habitats, \nor  protected  areas  in  the  project  site  or  surrounding  area.  The  construction  works  will  be \nconfined  within  the  12-hectare  project  harbor  area  and  its  immediate  surroundings. Therefore, \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fthe  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B  according  to  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  report  including  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  has  been  prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  Anticipated \nirreversible impacts entail removal of about 0.6 hectares of corals and 2.0 hectares of sea grass \nfor  construction  of  the  harbor,  neither  of  which  is  a  critical  habitat;  neither  area  includes \nendangered  or  critically  endangered  species.  Anticipated  impacts  during  construction  are  (i) \nincreased noise levels, air pollution, waste, water pollution, and sedimentation of seawater; and \n(ii)  occupational  health  and  safety  issues  caused  by  dredging  works  and  construction  of  the \nbreakwater and quay wall. These impacts are not significant, though, as they will be restricted to \nthe harbor construction site, with the nearest residential area approximately 240 meters away. \nThe only long-term impact expected during the harbor operations is water contamination due to \nthe solid and liquid waste generated from passenger and cargo boats. The EMP, which will form \npart of the civil works contract, includes measures to address all impacts during the construction \nstage.  The  EMP  will  be  updated  during  the  detailed  design  stage  of  the  project  if  necessary. \nMeasures  on  waste  management  during  harbor  operations  have  been  recommended  in  the \ninitial environmental examination. Meaningful consultations have been held with Kulhudhuffushi \nCouncil officials, residents of the island, and other key stakeholders such as the Environmental \nProtection Agency of the Maldives. Concerns of the local residents have been addressed in the \npreliminary design and will be further reviewed and updated during the detailed design stage. A \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  proposed  to  facilitate  receiving  and  resolving \ncomplaints during project construction. \n \n32. \n The  project  director  of  the  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  and  monitoring \nimplementation of environment safeguards under the project. The environmental officers under \nthe  Environment  Unit  of  the  MHI  will  support  the  project  director  to  address  environmental \nconcerns  of  the  project  as  needed.  The  PMU  will  also  be  supported  by  the  PMC,  which  will \ninclude  an  environment  specialist  who  will  conduct  monthly  site  inspections  and  prepare \nmonthly  and  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports.  The  civil  works  contractor  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the EMP and will include a qualified environmental expert in their \nteam who will prepare monthly self-evaluation environmental reports. The PMC will conduct an \ninitial  training-cum-coordination  workshop  on  implementing  environment  safeguards  for  the \ncontractor  during  the  pre-construction  stage,  followed  by  on-the-job  training  as  needed  during \nproject construction. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  Due  diligence  confirmed  that  the  project  will  be  implemented  on \nreclaimed land that has been zoned for the harbor. The government owns the project site and \nthere  are  no  titleholders  or  non-titleholders  occupying  the  area.  There  are  no  structures  being \naffected.  Meaningful  consultations  were  undertaken  with  relevant  stakeholders  during  project \npreparation.  The  population  of  the  Maldives  is  ethnically  homogenous  with  no  recognized \nsubcategories.  The  social  development  specialist  of  the  PMC  will  perform  semiannual \nmonitoring  to  verify  that  there  are  no  impacts  during  implementation  and  that  information \ndisclosure and meaningful consultation are continued throughout the construction period. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.20  \n \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDelay in the procurement of the civil works contract  The PMC will provide procurement support to the \nMHI, particularly in the preparation of the bidding \ndocument.
