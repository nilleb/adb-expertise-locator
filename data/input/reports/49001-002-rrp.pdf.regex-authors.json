Investment Program Summary\nThe impact of the proposed investment program will ensure future growth in the greater Suva area (GSA) is sustainable and will \nimprove public health. The outcome will be improved access to sustainable water supply and sewerage services in the GSA.  \nThe investment program has three outputs:\nOutput 1: Supply and access to safe water in the GSA improved. The investment will expand water supply by 40,000 m3 per \nday by constructing a new supply intake on the Rewa river with associated water treatment plant, pumping station, reservoir, \nand transmission main to connect to the existing system. Reliable and sustainable long term operations and maintenance \npractices will be enhanced through a Design-Build-Operate (DBO) contracting arrangement. A catchment management plan will \nbe developed to safeguard the water source and ensure long term sustainability. Non-revenue water (NRW) reduction will be \nachieved by improving leak detection and repairs; replacing meters; and establishing district metering areas and pressure \nmanagement systems. Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) will supply 200 liters per capital per day to 315,947 persons by 2023, \nensuring continuous supply to 98% of the GSA population. The climate change component of Output 1 will include adaptation \nmeasures for building the new Rewa river scheme specifically moving the facility from 29 km to 49 km from the river mouth to \navoid future climate change impacts embodied in projected rising sea levels and potential migration of the salt water wedge up \nthe river.\nOutput 2: Wastewater treatment (WWT) and management capacity in the GSA increased. The wastewater network will be \nrehabilitated and expanded by: (i) upgrading 31 existing wastewater pumping stations; (ii) upgrading about 18 km of wastewater \ntrunk mains to increase carrying capacity; (iii) relining 13 km of wastewater trunk mains; and (iv) extending the wastewater \nnetwork to service an additional 15% of households (approximately 4,500 existing lots in backlog areas) currently using septic \ntanks. Additionally, the WWT capacity at Kinoya will be expanded by 164% to cover approximately 277,000 person equivalent to\ntreat wastewater from current and future households. By improving the network and expanding the WWT capacity, WAF will \nensure that 60% of households in the GSA will have access to a reticulated sewage collection system by 2023. The remaining \nhouseholds with individual septic units will be catered by a fecal sludge management system.\nOutput 3: WAF management and sustainable service delivery capacity improved. Program management and capacity \ndevelopment support will be provided to: (i) support WAF in the implementation of water demand management, NRW reduction \nand the national liquid trade waste management programs;  (ii) support the Department of Environment (DOE) developing the \nenvironmental regulatory framework for treated municipal wastewater discharge, sludge treatment and disposal practices and \nstandards, and associated monitoring and enforcement; (iii) complete the corporatization of WAF; (iv) formulate water safety \nplans to protect the quantity and quality of water at all source intakes;  (v) improve financial management; (vi) promote gender \nequity; and (vii) study alternatives to reduce the long term energy consumption of the existing urban WWT system.\nImpact: The impact will be sustainable urban growth and improved public health in the greater Suva area. \nOutcome: Access to sustainable water supply and sewerage services in GSA improved \nOutputs: (i)Supply and access to safe water in the GSA improved, (ii)Wastewater treatment and management capacity in the \nGSA increased,  and (iii)WAF management and sustainable service delivery capacity improved\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Economy will be the executing agency.\n \nProject Readiness: Project Design Advance for Consultancy Packages have been contracted.\n12.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of Fiji for the Urban Water Supply and \nWastewater Management Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The investment program will augment vital urban infrastructure and services to support \nsustainable growth and development in the greater Suva area (GSA) in and around Fiji\u2019s capital \ncity.  It  will  (i)  increase the  capacity  of  the GSA\u2019s  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment \nsystems, and (ii) help the state-owned Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) improve its operational \nefficiency and the quality of its services by reducing losses due to nonrevenue water (NRW) and \nimproving the management of water demand and liquid trade waste.2 The investment program \nwill also support the government\u2019s development and implementation of water and sewerage \npolicy  and  regulatory  reforms.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical \nassistance  and  a  project  design  advance  loan  ($2.65  million)  to  prepare  the  investment \nprogram.3 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Background and sector issues. Fiji\u2019s population was estimated to be 893,000 in 2015, \nup from 837,200 in the last census in 2007.4 About 54% of its people live in urban areas, and \nthis is projected to increase to 61% by 2030. About 57% of these urban dwellers, or about \n275,000 people, are concentrated in the GSA. Many live in the area\u2019s informal settlements \nwithout access to essential services. The GSA accounts for 40% of Fiji\u2019s gross domestic product, \nwhich makes solving its urban development issues critical to the country\u2019s economic future. The \ngovernment  has  increased  public  spending  to  improve  basic  services  and  address  the \nchallenges and unlock the economic potential of the area\u2019s largely unplanned rapid growth. \nGovernment resources are limited, however, investment in almost all public services has fallen \nshort of needs, including those for improved urban water supply and wastewater.  \n \n4.  Constraints on water supply. The WAF\u2019s water supply network covered an estimated \n95% of the GSA\u2019s urban population in 2014, but services are intermittent in some communities \nand face several constraints. The Waila and Tamavua water treatment plants serve the GSA, \nwith a combined average production capacity of about 150,000 cubic meters (m3) per day. Both \nplants are operating at full capacity but cannot meet the current peak demand. This also means \nthat the WAF cannot expand its supply network to peri-urban or new growth areas. \n \n5.  The Waimanu River is currently the only source of raw water for treatment and supply, \nand it cannot fully meet the system\u2019s needs during extended droughts when its water level drops. \nService interruptions occur not only during dry periods, but also during heavy rains when \nincreased turbidity requires more frequent backwashing of the water treatment plant filters. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Liquid trade waste is wastewater from trade or industrial processes that is discharged into sewers. It does not \ninclude domestic wastewater. \n3  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to Fiji for Urban Development Planning and Institutional Capacity Building. \nManila; and ADB. 2015. Project Design Advance to the Republic of Fiji for the Urban Water Supply and \nWastewater Management Project. Manila.  \n4  ADB. 2015. Fiji Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Management Project. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 8526-\nFIJ).   \n \n ", "2   \n \nThese interruptions and the overall reliability of the water supply in the GSA will be further \ncompromised by such forecast climate change impacts and more extreme weather events.  \n \n6.  The supply shortages are exacerbated by the WAF\u2019s high rate of NRW losses, although \nthese have declined, through the utility\u2019s significant efforts, from 51.0% in 2014 to 39.2% in \n2016.5 The WAF aims to reduce the NRW rate to 27% by 2033, which will require an increased \nfocus on detecting leaks, replacement of aging pipelines, and routine maintenance.  \n  \n7.  Wastewater management. Public health risks in the GSA and pollution in local creeks \nand waterways have increased due to overflows from the WAF sewerage system, the discharge \nof trade and industry waste into storm water drains, and seepage from domestic sanitation \nsystems.  In  2013,  only  36%  of  the  GSA\u2019s  urban  population  was  covered  by  its  existing \nsewerage  infrastructure.6 The  Kinoya  wastewater  treatment\u2014the  GSA\u2019s  main  wastewater \ntreatment facility\u2014is working beyond its current rated capacity. Because of this, its final effluent \ndoes not meet regulatory standards. The plant needs hydraulic and treatment process upgrades \nif it is to properly treat current and projected wastewater flows. Insufficient investment in proper \nmaintenance  of  wastewater  treatment  and  sewerage  infrastructure  has  led  to  widespread \ndeterioration of these assets. The pump stations and pipelines need rehabilitation and capacity \nupgrades before any more connections can be made to the system.  \n \n8.  Institutional  framework.  The  government  assigned  the  functions  and  operational \nresponsibilities of its water and sewerage department to the WAF in 2007 and made it a \ncommercial  statutory  authority  in  2010.7 The WAF  has  invested  in  capital  and  operational \nimprovements  aimed  at  providing  an  effective  water  supply  and  wastewater  system  and \nservices in the GSA even though the government has not enabled it to become financially \nautonomous, or allowed tariff adjustments to improve cost recovery. WAF revenue from tariffs in \nFY2014 totaled $14.7 million. With earnings of $8.4 million from other sources, its overall \nincome was $23.1 million. Its operational and maintenance costs, excluding depreciation, were \n$36  million.  The  WAF\u2019s  costs  rose  by  14%  during  2010\u20132014.8 Although  the  WAF  has \nrequested increases, domestic water tariffs have not changed in Fiji since a value-added tax \nwas  removed  in  1999.  Tariff  revenues  go  into  the  government\u2019s  consolidated  fund.  The \ngovernment  provides  annual  grant  subsidies  meant  to  cover  the  WAF\u2019s  operational, \nmaintenance, and capital expenses.  \n \n9.  The  main  obstacles  to  the  WAF\u2019s  financial  sustainability  are  low  tariffs  and  the \nrequirement that it remit all tariff revenue to the Ministry of Economy (MOE) (footnote 8). The \nproposed investment program will support WAF to be more financially sustainable and more \naccountable to regulatory bodies by (i) helping it to improve its financial management systems, \n(ii) requiring the government to review and reform water and sewerage tariffs, and (iii) providing \nfor a review of regulations that affect how water resources and wastewater are managed. \n \n10.  Policy  framework,  sector  road  map,  and  investment  plan.  The  draft  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  new  national  development  plan  (NDP) for  2016\u201320369 focuses  on  achieving \ninclusive and sustainable development and meeting basic needs. The NDP makes the provision \n                                                \n5  Government of Fiji, Water Authority of Fiji. 2016. Nonrevenue Water Quarterly 2016 Report.

Policy reforms include \ncompleting the WAF corporatization process to improve WAF\u2019s financial autonomy, operations \nand service delivery which is required under both the WAF Promulgation 2007, and under the \nPublic Enterprise Act 1996. There has been ongoing technical assistance and dialogue to help \nWAF in this regard and is a feature of the proposed MFF. Other sector improvements planned \ninclude the formulation of national water and sanitation policy, water catchment management \nplans, and reviews of the environmental regulatory framework. A key regulatory action will \ninclude the municipal wastewater discharge standards to be reviewed and strengthened under \nthe Environment Management Act 2005. \n  \n11.  The NDP provides a road map, strategic context, policy framework, and a medium-term \nsector development plan (SDP) 2016\u20132021, for water supply and sanitation (WSS). The SDP\u2019s \nobjectives  cover  technical  sustainability;  environmental  and  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement; and improvements in sector policy, legislative, and regulatory frameworks.10 The \nNDP\u2019s long-term target for 2035 is for 100% of the population to have access to piped and safe \ndrinking water, and 70% to have access to a central sewerage system. The SDP target for 2021 \nis access to piped and safe drinking water for 100% of the country\u2019s urban population and \naccess to a central sewerage system for 40% of urban residents. The SDP adopts an inclusive \ndevelopment approach that targets the urban poor, particularly those living in (i) peri-urban \nsquatter settlements that have limited access to water and sewerage services, (ii) existing \nsuburban  residential  areas  not  currently  serviced,  and  (iii)  new  growth  areas.  The  annual \nfinancing requirements for the SDP exceed all previous annual budget provisions. The SDP \nobjectives are consistent with ADB\u2019s water operational plan for 2011\u20132020 and ADB\u2019s water \npolicy.11 The overall sector strategy is supported by a WAF water and wastewater master plan \nfor the GSA covering 2013\u20132033 (footnote 6). \n \n12.  Strategic context. The proposed investment program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Fiji for 2014\u20132018, which aims to improve municipal services in the \ncountry by continuing to upgrade urban WSS systems, introducing utility tariffs that cover the \ncosts of service delivery, and improving environmental infrastructure. ADB has been a long-\nstanding partner in government and WAF efforts to implement WSS reforms and improve urban \nWSS infrastructure.12 The proposed MFF is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \nfor 2017\u20132019 and is consistent with ADB\u2019s objective to enter into a long-term partnership with \nFiji to support the country\u2019s growth potential, particularly by strengthening WSS services.13  \n \n13.  Use  of  the  multitranche  financing  facility.  Use  of  ADB\u2019s  MFF  modality  for  the \ninvestment program provides three advantages for ADB and the government. It will help achieve \nADB\u2019s objective under its country operations business plan to establish a long-term partnership \nwith  Fiji  to  enhance  WSS  services.  It  will  help  the  government  manage  its  development \nfinancing efficiently. It will improve the government\u2019s capacity to meet the required development \n                                                \n10  Sector Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "4   \n \nfinancing envelope for the proposed water and sanitation program outlined in the SDP.14 The \ninvestment program will involve a priority water supply project under tranche 1 and a priority \nwastewater project under tranche 2. They are to be sequenced based on (i) project readiness, \n(ii) the introduction of reforms, and (iii) the WAF\u2019s demonstrated absorptive capacity to operate \nand maintain the new systems. WAF has increased its project staff to support the investment \nprogram implementation; this coupled with the support from the PDA consultants, will mitigate \ngovernance and capacity risks. The required MFF requirements\u2014i.e., a sector road map, an \ninvestment program, strategic context, and a policy framework\u2014are in place. The MFF modality \nwill give the government ongoing support for medium- and long-term investment planning. It \nallows  ADB  to  align financing  with  project  readiness  and sector  reforms. The government \nrequested an MFF because of its flexibility and the ability it affords to finance investments \nsequentially as each project becomes ready for implementation and will contribute 37% of the \noverall investment program financing. \n \n14.  Development partner coordination. ADB has been engaged in Fiji\u2019s WSS sector since \n1998 and takes a lead role in coordinating development partner planning and activities. Past \nsector  lessons  demonstrate  that  the  sector\u2019s  physical  investment requirements  exceed  the \nfinancing available from any single development institution. They also show a need for capacity \nbuilding and the importance of strong leadership by the government and WAF. While preparing \nthe proposed investment program, ADB helped the government successfully apply for grant \nfinancing of $31 million to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and collaborates with the European \nInvestment Bank, which is committed to cofinancing the investment program.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact will be sustainable urban growth and improved public health in the GSA. The \noutcome will be improved access to sustainable water supply and sewerage services in the \nGSA.    \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1: Supply of and access to safe water in the greater Suva area improved. \nProject 1 of the investment program will increase water supply to the GSA by 40,000 m3 per day \nby constructing a new supply intake on the Rewa River, an associated water treatment plant, a \npumping station, a reservoir, and a transmission main to connect the new water supply to the \nWAF\u2019s existing distribution system. To enhance climate resilience, the planned location of the \nnew Rewa River scheme is located 49 kilometers (km) from the river\u2019s mouth to avoid the \npotential future impacts of rising sea levels that are likely to push saltwater further up the river. \nReliable, long-term operation and maintenance will be provided through a design\u2013build\u2013operate \ncontracting arrangement. A water safety plan and water catchment management plan will be \ndeveloped to safeguard the water source and ensure long-term sustainability. Leak detection \nwill be improved, repairs undertaken, water meters replaced, and district metering areas and \npressure management systems established in WAF\u2019s existing distribution network to reduce the \ncurrent high level of NRW down to 36% by 2022. During implementation of the investment \nprogram, WAF will be able to expand network coverage and provide 98% of GSA\u2019s population \nwith a continuous supply of safe water by 2023. \n \n                                                \n14  Comparison of Multitranche Financing Facility vs. Sovereign Loan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "5 \n \n17.  Output 2: Wastewater treatment and management capacity in the greater Suva \narea increased. Project 2 of the investment program will be to rehabilitate and expand the \nsewerage network by (i) upgrading 31 existing wastewater pumping stations, (ii) upgrading \nabout 18 km of sewer trunk mains to increase carrying capacity, (iii) rehabilitating 13 km of \nsewer trunk mains, and (iv) extending the sewerage network to service an additional 4,500 \nhouseholds currently using on-site septic tanks. The wastewater treatment capacity at Kinoya \nwill be increased twofold, providing effective treatment of wastewater for up to 277,000 people \nin the GSA. By increasing wastewater treatment capacity and expanding the sewerage network, \nthe WAF will ensure that 60% of households in the GSA have access to a reticulated sewerage \nsystem by 2023.   \n \n18.  Output 3: Water Authority of Fiji management and sustainable service delivery \ncapacity  improved.  Through  the  Projects  1  and  2,  the  investment  program  will  provide \ninstitutional capacity building and implementation support. This support will help the WAF carry \nout programs to manage water demand, reduce NRW, and manage liquid trade waste.15 It will \nhelp the Department of Environment develop an environmental framework for regulating treated \nmunicipal  wastewater  discharge  and  residual  sludge  treatment  and  disposal  practices  and \nstandards,  along  with  associated  monitoring  and  enforcement  systems.  The  investment \nprogram will help the government carry out the corporatization of the WAF, improve WAF\u2019s \nfinancial management, and promote gender equity.  \n \nD.

The government has requested an MFF in an amount of up to $184.2 million to help \nfinance a part of the investment program. The MFF will consist of two tranches, subject to the \ngovernment's submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related legal \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth \nin the framework financing agreement. The MFF amount will be converted into loans from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  grant  cofinancing  from  the  GCF.  Tranche  1 \nincludes a total investment of $73,149,000, comprising (i) a loan of $42,109,000 from OCR, with \na 21-year term, including a grace period of 6 years, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nand project agreements;17 and (ii) grant cofinancing from the GCF equivalent to $31,040,000, to \nbe administered by ADB (subject to negotiation).18 Tranche proceeds will be included in the \ngovernment\u2019s budgetary transfers to the WAF. The remainder of the financing for project 1 will \ncomprise (i) a loan from the European Investment Bank of $26.6 million,19 which will not be \nadministered by ADB; and (ii) a government contribution of $80.7 million for project costs, \nincluding taxes, duties, land acquisition, and operation and maintenance costs included in the \n                                                \n17 The annuity repayment method is based on a 10% discount factor, resulting in an average loan maturity of 15.52 \nyears and a maturity premium of 0.10% per annum. \n18 The GCF grant agreement will be negotiated with the government once ADB has negotiated a framework \ncontribution agreement with GCF. \n19 European Investment Bank cofinancing will be on a joint collaborative basis and not administered by ADB. \nHowever, it will finance the same components and contracts.

Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The MOE will be the executing agency and the WAF the implementing agency. An \ninvestment  program  steering  committee  will  (i)  oversee  implementation  of  the  investment \nprogram and ensure its consistency with government policies; (ii) monitor investment program \nprogress and resolve issues that hinder it; and (iii) guide and support the MOE and the WAF, \nparticularly  in  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms.  The  investment  program  will  be \nimplemented over 10 years. The MOE and WAF will follow ADB guidelines in their use of the \nMFF financing, including ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time); \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time);  and  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 21  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the FAM.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements for the Investment Program \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  Investment program: December 2016\u2013July 2026  \n  Project 1: 1 August 2017\u201331 July 2025 \n  Project 2: 1 November 2018\u201331 July 2025 \nEstimated completion date  31 July 2026  \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  IPSC with MOE as chair and comprising WAF, MOIT, and MLGHE \n(ii)   Executing agency  MOE \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  WAF \n(iv)  Implementation unit  WAF\u2013IPMU  \nProcurement  ICB  9 contracts  $235,400,000 \nNCB  1 contracts  $4,400,000 \nConsulting services  QCBS 80:20  person-months  $28,960,000 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting will apply. \nadvance contracting  Retroactive financing will apply for expenditures on goods, works, and consulting \nservices incurred not earlier than 12 months prior to signing of the related legal \nagreement, subject to a maximum amount of 20% of the ADB loan and GCF \ngrant amounts. \nDisbursement   The ADB loan and GCF grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; GCF = Green Climate Fund; ICB = international competitive bidding; IPMU = \ninvestment program management unit; IPSC = investment program steering committee; MLGHE = Ministry of \nLocal Government, Housing, and Environment; MOE = Ministry of Economy; MOIT = Ministry of Infrastructure and \nTransport; NCB = national competitive bidding; QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection; WAF = Water Authority \nof Fiji. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIII.

Under \nthe project design advance loan, consultants have been recruited to (i) finalize the detailed \nengineering designs for outputs 1 and 2, (ii) initiate the procurement process, and (iii) initiate the \nreform and capacity building initiatives under outputs 1 and 3. The detailed designs for the \nphysical  works  for  output  2  are  advanced  and  expected  to  be  completed  by  June  2017. \nProcurement will be initiated in July 2017. Project 1 will include a design\u2013build\u2013operate contract \nfor the development of the new Rewa River water intake and water treatment plant. The location \nof the new Rewa River scheme provides additional security against salt water intrusion impacts \nthat are likely due to climate change and rising sea levels. Project 1 will support the detailed \nengineering, due diligence, and advance contracting for the physical wastewater treatment and \nsewerage system upgrades required for output 2 and scheduled under project 2.22 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Preliminary economic analysis indicated that the overall investment program has an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 8.3%. The analysis noted that the investment program \nhas significant health and environmental benefits that should be considered as overall economic \nbenefits but were not quantified for calculating the EIRR. With this in mind, the program is \nconsidered to have sufficient economic merit despite the EIRR being below the 12% threshold.  \nThe EIRR for project 1 is 8.5%. Project 1 will increase water supply in the GSA, thereby \nimproving the WAF\u2019s service to existing customers and helping to accommodate population \ngrowth in the area. Project 1 will reduce the WAF\u2019s high levels of NRW, making more water \navailable at a relatively low cost. The project will prevent a gradual erosion of the current \nsystem\u2019s capacity due to lack of redundancy for maintenance. Preliminary calculations for the \nwastewater investments indicate an EIRR for project 2 of 7.7%. An expanded sewerage system \nwill eliminate costs now incurred by those still to be connected by displacing such wastewater \ndisposal systems as septic tanks. The project will allow higher density development in new \nareas to be served. A financial analysis prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines calculated \na negative financial internal rate of return for project 1 based on the assumption that the WAF\u2019s \ncurrent water tariffs will not increase.23 The current weighted water tariff of F$0.46 per m3 covers \nonly about half of the average incremental financial cost of the WAF water supply of F$0.94 per \nm3. To achieve an operating ratio of less than 1, project 1 will ensure (i) that tariff adjustments \nare made on the principle of cost recovery, and (ii) that the government makes funding available \nto fill the cost-recovery gap.  \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  An  assessment  conducted  by  ADB  of  the  WAF\u2019s  and  the  government\u2019s  financial \nmanagement found no major country-level issues. Fiji has an effective, well-functioning public \nsector. The overall inherent risk was assessed as low, but the overall control risk was assessed \nas substantial. This is due to (i) the WAF\u2019s lack of financial autonomy, (ii) problematic findings \nfrom  the WAF\u2019s  external  audits,  (iii)  weak  information  systems,  and  (iv)  inadequate WAF \nreporting. The investment program will address the control risk through long-term WAF financial \nmanagement capacity building. It will support the corporatization of the WAF and help it develop \na strategy to become financially sustainable within the investment program period to improve its \nfinancial autonomy and service delivery.  \n \n                                                \n22 Detailed designs for physical works and due diligence are expected to be completed by January 2018. \n23 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "9 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  Inadequate  water  and  sanitation  services  currently  compromise  public  health  and \nconstrain economic development in Fiji. Poverty incidence in informal urban settlements has \nbeen estimated at 53%, and the lack of access to urban services has a particularly large \nnegative impact on women and children.24 The investment program will help reduce poverty by \nimproving the  water  supply  available  for the  connection  of  services  and  sewerage  will  be \nextended, providing increased access to settlements and new growth areas in the GSA. Project \n1 is classified effective gender mainstreaming.25 Execution of the gender action plan will help \ngive women better access to services and strengthen the WAF\u2019s institutional capacity to ensure \nlong-term sustainable gender mainstreaming.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  Environment. Project 1 is classified category B for the environment. The environmental \nassessment review framework for the investment program and a draft initial environmental \nexamination for project 1 have been prepared. The initial environmental examination including \nthe environment management plan is considered to be sufficient to meet environmental the \nrequirements. Project 2 is expected to be classified categorization of B or C for the environment. \n \n28.  Involuntary resettlement. Project 1 is classified category B for involuntary resettlement. \nThe resettlement framework for the investment program and a draft resettlement plan have \nbeen prepared for project 1. Land must be acquired by the government and the WAF. The \naffected persons have been identified in the resettlement plan, which will be updated after \ndetailed  design.  Project  2  is  expected  to  be  classified  category  B  or  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement. \n \n29.  Indigenous peoples. Project 1 is classified category C for the indigenous peoples. No \nimpacts are expected under project 1 on distinct and vulnerable groups of indigenous peoples \nas defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). A planning framework for possible \nimpacts  on  indigenous  peoples  was  prepared  to  meet  mandatory  MFF  requirements  and \naddress any unanticipated issues that could arise under project 2. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  The investment programs integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the \ncosts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.26 The overall risk is assessed as low. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe  government  is  unable  to  meet  the  The investment program includes a program management monitoring \ndevelopment  objectives  in  the  national  system, and partners will coordinate closely on actions.   \ndevelopment plan and road map in the water   \nsupply and sanitation sector. \nThe WAF is unable to raise its tariffs, and its  The WAF and MOE will agree on a cost recovery plan based on \nservice delivery is severely constrained by  continued government subsidies and/or tariff increases.
