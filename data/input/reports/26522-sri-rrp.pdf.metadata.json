The \nsupplementary loan finances (i) cost overruns for the construction \nof  a  two-lane  highway  from  Kurundugahahetekma  to  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange  and  the  Galle  access  road;  (ii)  expansion  of  the \nhighway  between  Kurundugahahetekma  and  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange  from  two  lanes  to  four  lanes;  (iii)  provision  of \nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision  and  project \nmanagement; and (iv) provision of road safety equipment. \n \nThe  Project  is  one  of  the  Government\u2019s  priority  projects.  Traffic \nvolume  between  the  southern  areas  of  the country  and  Colombo \nhas  increased  significantly;  travel  time  between  Matara  and \nColombo  is  about  4\u20135  hours.  The  completion  of  Southern \nHighway  will  significantly  reduce  travel  time  and  lead  to  effective \nmovement  to  and  from  the  southern  areas  to  Colombo.  This \nimproved  connectivity  will  contribute  to  increased  economic \nactivities.  \n \nThe  Project  has  experienced  cost  overruns,  especially  due  to \nincreases in civil work costs. Contributing factors include (i) price \nescalation  due  to  delay  in  completing  land  acquisition  and \nassociated  litigations,  (ii)  undetermined  geotechnical  and  soil \nconditions,  and  (iii)  increase  in  value-added  tax.  Implementation \ndelays  due  to  safeguard  compliance  issues  resulted  in  delayed \nhandover  of  the  site  to  the  contractor  and  increased  the  cost  of \nconsulting  services,  mainly  because  of \ntime \nrequired to supervise construction works. \n \n\nthe  additional \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n            \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe original Project covers construction of the first two-lanes of an \nultimate  four-lane  highway.  However,  a  six-lane  right-of-way  was \nprepared  and  acquired.  The  design  study  indicates  that  to \nmaintain the service of an intercity highway, the Project will need \nto  be  upgraded  to  four  lanes  after  2010.  This  means  that \nupgrading needs to start now.  \n \nThe  expansion  to  a  four-lane  highway  is  justifiable  based  on  the \nfollowing  grounds:  (i)  traffic  demand;  (ii)  resource  savings  when \nthe  four-lane  construction  is  undertaken  simultaneously  with \nfinalizing the two-lane construction; (iii) continuity of the four-lane \nhighway from Kottawa to Matara; and (iv) improved road safety.   \n  \nThe proposed activities and components under the supplementary \nloan are consistent with Government and ADB priorities. Physical \nchanges  have  been  assessed  along  with  their  impacts  in  the \ncontext  of  current  ADB  policies.  A  review  of  safeguards \ncompliance and all steps in the matrix of due diligence have been \nobserved. The Project is technically feasible, economically viable, \nand financially sustainable.  \n \nThe  impact  and  outcomes  of  the  supplementary  loan  are  in  line \nwith those of the Project approved in 1999. It aims to integrate the \nsouthern  region  into  the  country\u2019s  economic  mainstream  by \nimproving  access.  The  Project  will  promote  economic  growth  of \nthe  southern  region  by  improving  access  to  the  more  developed \nWestern  Province,  especially  with  Colombo  and  other  important \nfacilities such as the international port and airport. By 2010, travel \ntime  between  Kottawa  and  Matara  will  be  reduced  from  4  to  2 \nhours. By expanding the Southern Highway to four-lane standard, \nsignificant accidents will be avoided.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  supplementary  loan  is  estimated  at \n$179.10 million, including taxes and duties.   \n \n \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n90.00 \n89.10 \n179.10 \n\n \nPercent \n 50.30 \n  49.70 \n100.00 \n\n \n \nA  loan  of  $90  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility.

The balance of works \nfor  the  Pinnaduwa  interchange\u2013Matara  section,  including  four-\nlane  construction,  will  be  procured  by  following  the  Government \nprocurement laws and procedures.  \n \nServices of the construction supervision consultant funded by the \noriginal  1999  loan  will  continue  until  February  2008.  Thereafter, \nadditional  inputs  of  about  140  person-months  of  international \nconsulting and 1,040 of national consulting will be required under \nin \nto \nthe \nKurundugahahetekma\u2013Pinnaduwa  interchange  section  and  Galle \naccess road.  \n \nThe  current  management  consultant,  financed  by  the  Nordic \nDevelopment  Fund,  will  provide  services  until  the  end  of  2008. \nThereafter,  an  additional  34  person-months  of \ninternational \nconsulting  and  218  person-months  of  national  consulting  will  be \nrequired under the supplementary loan.  \n \nThe  consultants  will  be  selected  using  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection,  and  single-source  selection,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time) and the Project\u2019s procurement plan. \n \nThe Project will trigger economic development and job creation in \nthe hinterlands and on the south coast. \n \n\ncivil  works \n\nsupervise \n\nloan \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n\nrisk \n\ntwo \n\ninvolves \n\nimproper \n\nis  at  risk \n\nconstruction \n\nimplementation  of \n\nif  contractor \nTimely  completion  of  civil  works \nperformance is not satisfactory; therefore work programs need to \nbe  monitored  systematically.

The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) \nfor  Land  Use  Planning  of  the  Southern  Highway  Corridor,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nThe  revised  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1,  and  the  status  of  project \nreadiness is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nOn 25  November 1999,  the Asian Development  Bank (ADB) approved the loan for the \n2. \nSouthern  Transport  Development  Project  (STDP) 1  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  for \nSDR64,856,000  (or  $90  million  at  the  time  of  loan  signing,  and  currently  $96.4  million).  The \nLoan  and  Project  agreements  were  signed  on  16  December  1999  and  became  effective  on \n30 October 2002.  \n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\nIn  1995,  the  Government,  with  assistance  from  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \n3. \nAgency, carried out a master plan study in the southern region to strengthen linkages with the \nnational  economy.2 The  study  found  that  unemployment  rate  of  the  southern  region  was  well \nabove the national average, and its per capita gross regional domestic product was only 69% of \nthe national average. It also found that the region\u2019s development was severely constrained by \npoor  transport  links  with  other  parts  of  the  country,  in  particular  with  Colombo  and  the \neconomically  dominant  Western  Province.  In  1996,  the  Government  established  the  Southern \nDevelopment  Authority  to  oversee  implementation  of  the  master  plan.  At  the  same  time,  the \nGovernment  discussed  its  options  for  overcoming  the  region\u2019s  transport  constraints  with  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \nADB  provided  TA 3  to  study  options  for  improving  road  transport  linkages  between \n4. \nColombo and the southern region. The TA concluded that construction of a new highway on an \ninland  alignment  is  preferable  to  improving  the  existing  coastal  National  Highway  A2.  The  A2 \nimprovement was rejected for a number of reasons: (i) insufficient space for widening, as both \nsides were occupied by extensive commercial and residential development; (ii) improvement of \nthe coastal highway would not provide access to the less-developed and far more poverty-prone \nhinterland; and (iii) the existing A2 was vulnerable to sea erosion, already requiring substantial \nand costly correction works. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1999.

Technical  Assistance  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Southern  Transport \n\nCorridor Project. Manila (TA 2892-SRI, for $1 million, approved on 9 October).  \n\n\f 2 \n\nADB\u2019s  country  operation  strategy  for  Sri  Lanka 4  notes  the  importance  of  the  road \n5. \nnetwork  in  linking  the  domestic  economy  and  promoting  the  decentralization  of  economic \nopportunities.  It  recommends  that  the  road  subsector  continue  to  be  a  priority  for  ADB \ninvolvement,  with  particular  emphasis  on  improving  (i)  key  transport  corridors  emanating  from \nColombo,  of  which  the  project  highway  is  of  primary  importance;  and  (ii)  links  between \nsecondary urban centers and rural areas surrounding them. In November 1999, ADB approved \na loan for the Project (footnote 1).     \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n6. \nThe  primary  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  facilitate  and  act  as  a  catalyst  for \ndevelopment  in  the  economically  deprived  southern  region  by  constructing  a  new  southern \nhighway  linking  Colombo  with  Galle,  the  capital  of  Southern  Province,  and  Matara;  and  \n(ii)  produce  a  sustainable  and  quantifiable  reduction  in  the  country's  very  high  road  accident \nrate.  The  secondary  objective  is  poverty  reduction  within  the  immediate  project  area,  where \nmore  than  30%  of  the  population  is  classified  as  poor,  and  within  the  south  of  the  country \ngenerally. The Project has two components.  \n \n\n1. \n\nSouthern Highway Component \n\nCivil  Works.  The  Project  includes  the  construction  of  the  main  alignment  for  the \n7. \nhighway,  comprising  the  first  two-lane  carriageway  of  an  ultimately  four-lane,  high-capacity, \nlimited-access  highway  from  Kottawa  to  Matara;  and  construction  of  access  highways  to \nconnect the main express highway to the existing A2 highway and Galle. ADB is financing the \nsouthern  section  (Kurundugahahetekma\u2013Matara)  of  the  main  alignment  and  the  access \nhighway to Galle (ADB-financed section). The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) \nis funding the remaining northern part of the highway (Kottawa\u2013Kurundugahahetekma).  \n \nConsulting  Services.  ADB  is  financing  the  construction  supervision  consultant  (CSC) \n8. \nfor  the  civil  works  in  the  ADB-financed  section,  including  design  review  and  monitoring  of \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts.  JBIC  is  financing  similar  consulting  services  for  the  JBIC-\nfinanced section. The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) is financing a management consultant \nfor overall project implementation.

The  cost  of  the  ADB-financed \ncomponent was estimated at $132.4 million equivalent.5 ADB provided, from its Special Funds \nresources, a loan of SDR64,856,000 ($90.0 million at the time of loan signing) to finance about \n30.4% of the total cost. The loan maturity is 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and \nan  annual  interest  rate  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter.  The  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency  provided  a  grant  of  $1.0  million  equivalent  for \nthe  road  safety  component;  NDF  provided  a  loan  of  $6.7  million  equivalent  for  financing \nmanagement consultant services, the road safety component, and road safety equipment. The \nGovernment financed the remaining 26.2% of the project cost or about $37.4 million equivalent. \nThe original cost estimates and financing plan of the ADB-financed component is in Table 1.  \n\n                                                 \n5   The  estimated  cost  of  the  JBIC-financed  component  was  $163.6  million,  for  which  JBIC  has  provided  a  loan  of \n\n$120 million equivalent. \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Original Cost Estimates and Financing Plana \n($ million) \n\nTotal \n\nADB \n\nNDF \n\nSida \n\nGovt \n\nItem \n\n \n\nA. \n\nBase Cost \n 1.

The  loan  closing  date  was \nextended from 31 December 2006 to 30 June 2008. \n \n\n1. \n\nSouthern Highway Component  \n\n14. \nThe  contract  for  the  ADB-financed  section  of  the  highway  was  awarded  as  a  single \npackage on 3 January 2003. The original contract price of $87 million was adjusted as of July \n2007  to  $156.5  million.  The  original  completion  period  of  40  months  until  25  April  2006,  was \nextended to 22 February 2008. The civil works cover (i) the main alignment 59.6 kilometers (km) \nof the highway and 5.6 km of the Galle access road, (ii) 642 pipe culverts and 63 box culverts, \nand  (iii)  22  bridges  including  four  major  bridges.  The  civil  works  contract  was  restructured  to \ninclude  expansion  of  the  carriageway  to  four  lanes  and  reduction  of  the  length  to  include  only \nconstruction of the highway from Kurundugahahetekma to Pinnaduwa interchange including the \n\n\fGalle  access  road  (around  34.8  km).  The  contract  value  is  now  $241  million.  The  southern \nsection from Pinnaduwa interchange to Godagama in Matara will be expanded to four lanes and \nbe funded by the Government. The contract value of the southern section is around $99 million.  \n \nThe significant delay in project implementation was due to (i) delays in handing over of \n15. \nsites to the contractor because of issues in land acquisition and resettlement of people affected; \n(ii) complaints and court cases by those affected on environmental and social safeguard issues, \nwhich  stopped  physical  works  on  several  occasions;  (iii)  investigations  by  ADB's  Compliance \nReview  Panel  (CRP);  (iv)  delays  in  obtaining  some  government  clearances  such  as \nenvironmental clearances for rock blasting; (v) inadequate resources provided by the contractor; \nand (vi) occurrence of underestimated deposits of soft and unsuitable soil material in the original \ncontract (due to incomplete survey and design at the time of bidding), requiring removal and/or \nground  treatment.  As  of  the  end  of  October  2007,  the  overall  progress  of  the  ADB-financed \nsection was 71%, equivalent to value of work around $95.5 million. \n \n16. \nThe  JBIC-financed  section  comprises  two  packages.  Package  1,  from  Colombo \n(Kottawa)  to  Dodangoda  (34.9  km)  was  awarded  in  August  2005  at  a  contract  price  of  \n$96  million;  in  July  2007,  the  contract  price  was  increased  due  to  price  escalation  to  \n$120  million  for  four  lanes,  with  a  completion  period  of  48  months  until  18  September  2009. \nPackage  2,  Dodangoda\u2013Kurundugahahetekma  (31.7  km),  awarded  on  24  March  2006,  was \nvalued  at  $.83  million  for  two  lanes,  and  in  July  2007,  the  contract  was  restructured  to  cover \nexpansion  to  four  lanes.  The  contract  value  after  restructuring  the  civil  work  contract  is  now \n$151.5 million, and the completion period of 48 months ends 23 March 2010.6 As of  December \n2007, package 1 was 21% complete and package 2 was 9% complete.     \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Safety Component  \n\n17. \nThe  road  safety  consultants  commenced  work  in  February  2002,  and  completed  their \nassignment at the end of December 2005. They provided assistance to RDA for activities, such \nas strengthening road safety institutions, conducting road safety audits on existing roads and on \nthe  final  project  design,  revising  traffic  laws  and  regulations,  establishing  emergency  rescue \nservices, and identifying and designing rectification measures for accident black spots.  \n \n18. \nThe  Road  Safety  Unit  within  RDA  and  National  Road  Safety  Secretariat  were \nestablished. The latter coordinates the works of the National Council for Road Safety, which has \n17 stakeholders appointed to coordinate implementation of the National Road Safety Strategic \nPlan. The regulations for a road safety fund are being finalized. It has been gazetted that 1% of \nthe insurance premium for third party motoring risks will be transmitted to the fund. \n \n19. \nwere completed by April 2007.  \n \n20. \ntraffic police and equipment were installed by June 2007.  \n \n\nComputer equipment and software for the accident data system as well as equipment for \n\nBlack spot improvements in 20 areas under six packages in several ADB-financed roads \n\n                                                 \n6   The Government has requested JBIC to provide another loan to finance four lanes for this section. \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\n3. \n\nLoan Covenants \n\n21. \nThe compliance status of project loan covenants is given in Supplementary Appendix B. \nThe Project is in substantial compliance with covenants in the Loan Agreement. Almost all of the \nloan covenants have been either complied with or are being complied with. Two loan covenants \nhave not been complied with: the National Highways Act and the Motor Traffic Act were to be \nenacted  by  31  December  2001.  The  delay  was  mostly  due  to  executive  and  legislative \ninstitutional  changes.  Elections  in  2002,  2004,  and  2005  further  delayed  processing  of  the \nlegislation.   \n \n22. \nFollowing Cabinet approval, the first draft of the National Highways Act was submitted to \nParliament  in  July  2001.  Due  to  the  change  of  government,  the  matter  was  not  processed \nfurther.  Subsequently,  the  National  Highways  Act  was  renamed  the  Thoroughfares  Act.  The \nrevised  version,  cleared  by  the  legal  draftsman,  has  been  concurred  by  the  attorney  general. \nThe final version will be submitted to Cabinet for approval, and the Government will ensure that \nthe proposed statute is submitted to Parliament by September  2008.  \n \n23. \nThe  final  draft  of  the  Motor  Traffic  Act  was  submitted  to  the  Law  Commission  for  final \nreview.  The  Law  Commission  has  given  its  concurrence,  and  the  Ministry  of  Railway  and \nTransport  had  asked  the  commissioner  of  motor  traffic  to  review  the  draft  to  ensure  that  all \nsalient  features  are  included.  The  draft  statute has  been  submitted  to  the  attorney  general  for \nconcurrence prior to submission to Cabinet for approval. The Government will ensure that this \nproposed statute is submitted to Parliament by September 2008.  \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards \n\n24. \nImplementation of the southern highway component has experienced difficulties related \nto ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguards policies. In December 2004, the CRP registered \na  request  for  a  compliance  review  of  the  Project.  The  CRP  determined  that  the  request  was \neligible,  and  the  Board  authorized  the  CRP  to  conduct  a  compliance  review  on  the  Project.  A \nsummary  of  significant  features  of  the  progress  on  the  implementation  of  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards of the original loan and CRP\u2019s recommendations follow.  \n \n \n\na. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n \nFollowing completion of the detailed project design, a resettlement implementation plan \n25. \n(RIP)  was  formulated  to  address  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  of  the  entire  highway  from \nKottawa  to  Godagama  in  Matara,  including  the  Galle  access  road.  In  October  2002,  ADB \napproved the RIP prior to loan effectiveness. The acquisition of land and other property for the \nright-of-way (ROW) for six lanes resulted in the physical displacement of 1,370 households with \n6,223  people.  About  38%  were  relocated  at  32  resettlement  sites,  and  other  physically \ndisplaced  households  (62%)  opted  for  self-relocation.  In  addition,  the Project  affected  (but  not \nphysically displaced) about 5,900 households who live by the ROW of the highway. Some lost \npart  of  their  cultivated  land  or  homesteads,  or  both.  Others  lost  employment  sources  such  as \nsharecropping  in  rice  fields,  wage  work  in  small  tea  and  rubber  plantations,  and  small \nbusinesses. \n \n\n\fAll  those  affected,  except  some  who  disputed  the  amounts  payable  or  where  the \n26. \nproperties  are  under  joint  ownership,  received  statutory  compensation  under  the  Land \nAcquisition  Act  and  resettlement  assistance  under  the  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement \nCommittee (LARC) review of the replacement value of acquired property. \n \n27. \nAlthough  squatters  were  not  compensated  under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  they  were \ngiven LARC assistance. Each squatter household received a piece of land at a resettlement site \n(the  size  of  which  ranges  from  10  to  20  perches) 7,  and  compensation  for  their  structures \nacquired  at  replacement  value  in  addition  to  other  general  entitlements  listed  in  RIP;  294 \nsquatter households received land plots and financial assistance to build houses at resettlement \nsites.  \n \nTo  minimize  the  displacement  trauma  and  ensure  that  they  integrate  smoothly  and \n28. \nrapidly  into  their  host  communities,  most  resettlement  sites  were  established  close  to  the \nProject\u2019s  affected  villages.  The  housing  committee  at  each  resettlement  site  organizes \ncommunity  work  among  resettlers,  enabling  them  to  evolve  as  communities  that  are  well \nintegrated  into  host  communities.  The  housing  committee  reviews  the  adequacy  of  basic  site \nfacilities,  suggests  improvements,  and  assists  vulnerable  households  in  constructing  houses \nand  in  finding  employment  in  the  vicinity.  The  resettlement  sites  established  a  few  years  ago \nshow  a  remarkable  improvement  in  common  infrastructure,  homestead  development,  water \nsupply,  and  housing  conditions.  With  the  assistance  of  housing  committees  and  support  from \nRDA and regional development agencies, 31 resettlement sites have been handed over to the \nlocal  authority  and  the  last  resettlement  site  is  expected  to  reach  similar  standards  and  be \nhanded over to the local authority in the second quarter of 2008.  \n \n29. \nThe RIP was developed with a broader objective to address socioeconomic impacts of \nthe  Project,  and  to  ensure  at  least  the  restoration  of  pre-project  household  incomes, \nimprovement  of  living  standards  and  income  earning  capacity,  and  production  of  affected \nhouseholds.  In  this  context,  an  income  restoration  program  (IRP)  is  being  implemented  for \naffected households. This program began in 2005. Some households that received large sums \nof  money  as  compensation  and  LARC  assistance  and  used  the  money  in  an  unsustainable \nmanner to build spacious houses beyond their means; they now have half-built houses. Others \nused  compensation  in  various  businesses  without  proper  planning  and  lost  their  capital.  The \nprogram  initially  assists  1,050  affected  households,  including  266  vulnerable  households, \nheaded by women, who moved into RDA\u2019s resettlement sites. However, this program needs to \nbe strengthened to achieve its objectives.   \n \n30. \nThe  management  consultant  monitors  land  acquisition,  compensation  payments,  and \nrelocation. In 2006, comprehensive land acquisition and resettlement audits were carried out to \nassess  the  progress  of  the  resettlement  program.  An  independent  external  monitoring  agency \nwas  appointed  in  April  2006  to  verify  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  compensation  payment, \ndelivery of LARC assistance, and the resettlement process; and to assess whether the Project \nachieved  its  goals  and  the  objectives  of  the  RIP.  The  external  monitoring  agency  used  a \ncomprehensive  monitoring  framework  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  400  sample \nhouseholds and in June 2007, reports the following: \n \n\n                                                 \n7 One perch is equal to  approximately 36 square meters. \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nRDA has made a good effort to implement the RIP, and has modified some of the \nrecommended practices listed in the RIP to take into account realities that were \nnot known at the time of RIP preparation. \nThe RIP is too schematic. This has generated some implementation difficulties. It \nhas several biases, namely, cash compensation, housing for the displaced, and \nrehabilitation  of  the  landless.  As  a  result,  although  the  Project  provides \ncompensation-in-kind,  as  specified  in  the  RIP,  to  displaced  people,  in  case  of \nacquired  agricultural  land,  the  Project  has  paid  cash  compensation  to  those \naffected.  \nSuccess in building new housing to preacquisition or most often better quality in \nresettlement sites and self-relocated sites is significant.  \nThe detailed processes followed by the LARC to arrive at the replacement value \nof  all  acquired  property  and  thereby  to  ensure  that  those  affected  are  at  least \nrestored to their preacquisition livelihood and income are found to be satisfactory.  \nNontitled holders and the landless (including squatters) have been recognized for \ncompensation  and  other  resettlement  assistance.  They  have  benefited from  the \nresettlement process.  \nThe  documentation  of  the  resettlement  process  needs  to  be  developed  in  a \nsystematic manner8.  \n\nb. \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards  \n\nthe  environmental \n\nThe  Central  Environment  Authority  (CEA)  approved \n\n \n31. \nimpact \nassessment (EIA) on 23 July 1999. CEA\u2019s approval was subject to the highway alignment being \npartly changed to avoid the Koggala and Madu Gangga wetlands. During preparation of detailed \ndesign, this key condition was duly addressed and the new alignment came to be known as the \n\u201cfinal  trace\u201d  of  the  highway.  The  engineering  consultant  prepared  the  Environmental  Findings \nReport,  which  basically  reported  the  environmental  conditions  of  the  final  alignment  and \npotential  environmental  impacts  related  to  the  final  alignment.  This  report,  submitted  to  RDA \nand ADB in 2000, was not presented as an EIA report for the final trace, mainly because CEA \ndid not require the submission of a supplementary EIA report for the final alignment. This is a \nmajor factor that led the CRP to evaluate the Project as noncompliant. The other noncompliance \n(assessed  by  the  CRP)  was  based on  the  absence  of  the  assessment of  impact  for  the  Galle \naccess road.9   \n  \n32. \nNonetheless,  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  a \nsupplementary  environmental  assessment  for  the  final  alignment  including  the  Galle  access \nroad was prepared to cover sections of the final trace not studied in detail in the 1999 EIA. The \nsummary  of  the  supplementary  environmental  assessment  report,  together  with  the  summary \nEIA for four lanes, was disclosed on 19 April 2007. \n \n33. \nThe first environment management plan (EMP) was submitted to CEA in January 2005 \nand  approved  in  August  2005.  Subsequently,  RDA  instructed  the  contractor  and  construction \nsupervision  consultant  (CSC)  to  implement  the  EMP.  The  contractor  is  responsible  for \n\n                                                 \n8  The management information system on the implementation of the RIP has been completed and the system has \n\nbeen functional.   \n\n9  The  Government\u2019s  EIA  requirement  excludes  any  construction  of  new  roads  less  than  10  km,  and  therefore,  no \n\nenvironmental assessment was completed for the proposed Galle access road as it is less than 6 km.   \n\n\fimplementing  mitigation  measures  of  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction \nworks.  In  2006,  the  EMP  was  updated  by  incorporating  the  recommendation  from  the \nsupplementary  environmental  assessment  for  the  final  alignment  and  the  environmental \nassessment study for expansion of the road to four lanes. The CEA endorsed the revised EMP \non 3 September 2007. \n \n34. \nAlthough  the  procedural  requirement  in  terms  of  preparation  of  the  environmental \nassessment  studies,  and  monitoring  EMP  implementation  are  in  place,  the  outputs  of  EMP \nimplementation  need  to  be  strengthened.  The  environmental  impacts  related  to  public  health \ndue to dust, noise and vibration, stagnant water, disruption of access, and uncontrolled disposal \nof  unwanted  materials  need  to  be  systematically  mitigated.  In  this  context,  the  CSC  is  now \nequipped  with  environmental  experts  to  supervise  and  control  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  that \ngenerate environmental impacts.  \n \n\nc. \n\nCompliance Review Panel\u2019s Recommendations \n\nIn June 2005, the CRP approved a course of actions to bring the Project back to policy \n35. \ncompliance.  The  first  annual  monitoring  of  implementation  of  the  CRP  recommendations  was \ncarried out in June 2006, and its report was disclosed on 11 July 2006. The second monitoring \nwas  carried  out  in  November  2007,  and  its  report  was  disclosed  on  27  December  2007.  The \nCRP\u2019s  first  three  recommendations  deal  with  ADB-wide  safeguard  policy  requirements.  The \nremaining  recommendations  are  specific  to  the  Project.  ADB\u2019s  Board  Compliance  Review \nCommittee noted considerable progress in the implementation of the CRP\u2019s recommendations. \nThe current implementation status of the course of actions is given in Appendix 2. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \n\nA. \n\nCost Overrun and Proposed Change of Scope \n\n1. \n\nCost Overrun  \n\n36. \nIn project appraisal for the original loan, civil works were estimated to cost $70.4 million \nbased on the feasibility study (footnote 4). The civil works contract was awarded at $87 million. \nThe  original  loan  provides  contingencies  of  $35.4  million,  considered  sufficient  to  cover  the \nadditional cost  of  the contract.  During  implementation,  however,  additional  costs  amounting  to \n$69.5 million were observed mainly due to (i) price escalation, (ii) increase in value-added tax, \n(iii) increase in costs caused by undetermined geotechnical and soil conditions at the site, and \n(iv)  delays  in  handover  of  the  site  to  the  contractor  due  to  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \n(LAR)  problems.  The  implementation  delay  also  increased  the  cost  of  consulting  services. \nAppendix 3 provides a detailed calculation of the cost overrun.   \n \n37. \nLAR costs increased from $7.6 million to $44 million. The original cost was based on a \nsurvey  of  20%  of  the  project  area  completed  for  the  feasibility  study.  Subsequently,  detailed \ndesign was prepared taking into account CEA\u2019s recommendation to avoid ecologically sensitive \nareas. Based on the detailed design, a 100% survey of the affected area resulted in the much \nhigher LAR cost of $44 million. The Government financed the cost, and therefore no financing of \nLAR is proposed under the supplementary loan. This supplementary loan (SL) will finance cost \noverruns  for  construction  of  the  two-lane  highway  from  Kurundugahatekma  to  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange and the Galle access road. \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nProposed Expansion from a Two-Lane to a Four-Lane Highway \n\n38. \nUnder  the  approved  loan,  the  Project  involves  construction  of  the  first  two-lane \ncarriageway  of  an  ultimate  four-lane,  high-capacity,  limited  access  highway.  In  this  context,  a \nsix-lane ROW for the highway was prepared and the associated land was completely acquired. \nThe  civil  works  were  awarded  for  construction  of  two  lanes  and,  at  present,  all  bridges  have \nbeen  constructed  to  cater  to  a  four-lane  highway,  except  for  one  bridge  (bridge  no.  20).  The \nexpansion  to  four  lanes  was  anticipated  from  the  initial  stage  of  the  preparation  of  highway \nconstruction. The incremental cost for construction of four lanes is estimated at $200.30 million.  \n \n39. \nThe civil works for the original ADB section (from Kurundugahahetekma to Godagama in \nMatara)  to  complete  the  two  lanes  and  expand  to  four  lanes  will  be  divided  into  two  contract \npackages.  Package  1  covers  the  civil  works  from  Kurundugahahetekma  to  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange  and  Galle  access  road,  and  package  2  covers  the  civil  works  from  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange to Godagama in Matara. SL will finance 50% of package 1 or approximately $69.25 \nmillion; the Government or another cofinancier will finance the rest of package 1, and package \n2.  \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services and Project Management \n\n40. \nThe  construction  work  will  require  continuity  of  the  construction  supervision  and \nmanagement  consultants  in  helping  RDA\u2019s  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  supervise \nconstruction  and  ensure  coordination  of  consultants  and  contractors.  The  estimated  cost  for \nconsultancy  services  financed  under  SL  is  $9.3  million,  comprising  part  of  the  costs  for  the \nmanagement consultant for the whole Southern Highway, and the cost for CSC for package 1. \nIn addition, SL will continue financing the PMU\u2019s incremental expenditures.  \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety Equipment \n\n41. \nAs the Southern Highway will be the first highway in Sri Lanka, provision of road safety \nequipment  is  critical  to  minimize  road  accidents.  Therefore,  SL  will  cover  50%  of  the \nprocurement of the highway's equipment comprising (i) an advanced traffic management system \nto centrally monitor roads; (ii) weigh-in-motion/static weighing platforms to control overloading; \n(iii)  speed-monitoring  equipment;  and  (iv)  ambulances,  police  vehicles  and  other  rescue \nequipment,  and  other  supporting  services  to  operate  the  highway.  The  total  estimated  cost  of \nthe road safety equipment is $4.9 million.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact and outcomes of the supplementary loan are in line with those of the Project \n42. \nas  approved  in  1999.  It  aims  to  integrate  the  southern  region  into  the  country\u2019s  economic \nmainstream  by  improving  access  to  economic  and  social  opportunities  for  residents  of  the \nregion. The expected impact is improved socioeconomic conditions in the southern region. The \nexpected  outcomes  are  increased  economic  opportunities  and  social  services  for  southern \nregion residents through efficient road linkages with the capital city and other regions.  \n \n43.  With  the  completion  of  construction  of  a  four-lane  highway,  the  supplementary  loan  is \nexpected  to  significantly  contribute  to  improving  access  from  the  southern  region  to  Western \n\n\fProvince,  especially  with  Colombo  and  other  important  facilities  such  as  the  international  port \nand  airport.  It  will  strengthen  efforts  to  reduce  road  accidents  and  significantly  reduce  travel \ntime.    \n \nC. \n\nRationale \n\n44. \nThe  Project  remains  an  important  backbone  of  connectivity  from  the  south  of  the \ncountry.  Currently,  only  the  A2  highway  serves  the  southern  coastal  area.  It  has  reached  its \ntraffic  capacity  in  many  sections  and  has  limited  potential  for  capacity  expansion  due  to \ndevelopment  along  the road.  The  Southern  Highway  is  expected  to  serve  the  transport  needs \nespecially  with  expansion  of  Galle  Port  and  also  the  plan  to  develop  Hambantota  port.  The \nSouthern  Highway  will  contribute  significantly  to  development  of  the  southern  region.  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  strategy  and  program  also  focuses  on  helping  the  Government  improve  the  transport \nsector; completing the Project is critical from ADB\u2019s point of view. \n \n45. \nThe  Government  requested  a  supplementary  loan  to  complete  the  Project  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  However,  due  to  unavailability,  the  Government  agreed  to  borrow \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR). Sri Lanka\u2019s economy has recovered quickly from \nthe tsunami. Growth was 6.7% in 2007. The preliminary debt sustainability assessments show \nthat  Sri  Lanka  has  the  ability  to  borrow  on  fully  commercial  terms.  On  this  basis,  a \nsupplementary loan from OCR is appropriate to assist the Government in meeting its required \ncapital for financing a large infrastructure investment.  \n \n46. \nThe  supplementary  loan  will  cover  the  cost  overrun  for  continuing  construction  of  the \ntwo-lane  highway  in  the  Kurundugahahetekma-Pinnaduwa  interchange  section  and  Galle \naccess  road,  its  additional  expansion  to  a  four-lane  highway,  provision  of  construction \nsupervision and management consultancy, and provision of road safety equipment. The loan is \njustifiable on the following grounds.  \n \n\n1. \n\nTraffic Demand  \n\n47. \nThe current traffic counts show that overall annual growth rates vary from 5% to 10.7% \nwith an average of 6.8%. The results are higher than the 1998 study used as the basis for the \n2000 design study. The 2000 design study indicated that the northern part of the ADB-financed \nsection would need to be upgraded to four lanes between 2010 and 2015 to maintain services in \nline with an intercity highway. \n \n\n2. \n\nResource Savings from Construction-Related Works  \n\n48. \nThe existing two-lane construction is to be completed by the end of February 2008. If the \nGovernment follows the original plan, it would need to embark on large-scale construction work \nfor four lanes and significant time for initiating civil construction works, especially for obtaining \nall licenses and permits for construction-related works. Therefore, additional time and financing \nwill  be  needed.  The  proposed  expansion  of \nlanes  undertaken \nsimultaneously  with  the  two-lane  construction  will  amount  to  substantial  savings  in  time  and \ncost, and reduce disruption associated with construction activities. \n \n\nthe  highway \n\nfour \n\nto \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\n3. \n\nContinuity of Highway \n\n49. \nThe  first  35  km  of  the  Southern  Highway  from  Kottawa  to  Dodangoda  is  being \nconstructed  with  four  lanes.  The  remaining  JBIC-financed  section  from  Dodangoda  to \nKurundugahahetekma  (31  km)  is  also  currently  being  constructed  as  four-lane  highway.  The \nfirst package will be completed by September 2009, and the second by April 2010. Expansion of \nthe  ADB-financed  section  to  a  four-lane  highway  will  provide  a  continuous  four-lane  highway \nfrom Kottawa to Godagama in Matara. \n \n\n4. \n\nImprovement in Road Safety \n\n50.  Without  increasing  the  ADB-financed  section  to  four  lanes  and  the  associated  road \nsafety equipment, road accidents are expected to increase as traffic volume increases. A road \nsafety study carried out under the NDF-funded road safety component indicates that increasing \nthis  section  to  four  lanes  with  a  divided  carriageway  will  avoid  head-on  collisions  caused  by \novertaking traffic. About 27 fatal accidents and 55 serious injury accidents are estimated to be \navoided each year.  \n \n\nCompliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Supplementary Financing10 \n\n \n5. \n\nThe proposed activities and components under the supplementary loan (i) are consistent \n51. \nwith  the  priorities  of  the  Government  and  ADB;  (ii)  complied  with  the  requirements  for \nassessment  of  impact  due  to  physical  changes  in  the  context  of  current  ADB  policies;  (iii) \ntechnically feasible, economically viable, and financially sustainable; and (iv) complied with the \nrequirements  for  ADB  safeguards  policies.  All  steps  in  the  matrix  of  due  diligence  have  been \nobserved  (including  technical,  capacity,  and  institutional  assessments,  and  economic  and \nfinancial analyses of the revised Project). \n \n \nD. \n\nPolicy Safeguard Due Diligence \n\n52. \nSince  the  supplementary  loan  involves  a  physical  change,  policy  safeguard  due \ndiligence,  especially  for  resettlement  and  environment,  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s safeguards policies.  \n \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n53. \nResettlement  due  diligence  conducted  from  May  to  July  2006  included  a  detailed \nconsultation  program  with  people  who  live  by  the  ROW  of  the  ADB-financed  highway  section. \nThe proposed widening of the highway from two lanes to four lanes may not require any land \nacquisition or relocation of residents because the proposed additional two lanes fall within the \nalready  acquired  ROW  for  the  six-lane  highway.  In  the  event  that  any  unanticipated  land \nacquisition is required, it will be done as per the approved RIP principles and procedures, and \nprocedure  stated  in  the  circular  (8  September  2006)  issued  by  the  secretary,  Ministry  of \nHighways.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005. Operations Manual. OM H5 BP and OP: Supplementary Financing. Manila. \n\n\finterest \n\nfor  delayed  statutory  compensation.  The  due  diligence \n\nThe Project will continue with several resettlement activities such as (i) implementation \n54. \nof  the  income  restoration  program  (IRP),  (ii)  provision  of  special  assistance  to  vulnerable \naffected  people,  (iii)  issuance  of  entitlement  certificates  and  resettlement  title  deeds,  and  (iv) \npayment  of \nreport \n(Supplementary Appendix C) outlines the resettlement implementation issues common to both \nongoing  two-lane  construction  and  proposed  additional  two  lanes.  The  establishment  of  the \nEnvironment  and  Social  Division  (ESD)  at  RDA  with  resettlement  officers  and  resettlement \nassistants will improve monitoring of the resettlement program.  \n \n55. \nThe management consultant will continue implementation and monitoring of the RIP and \nIRP for the Project. The independent external monitoring agency developed (i) a monitoring and \nevaluation  framework,  (ii)  a  reporting  framework,  and  (iii)  data  collection  methodologies.  RDA \nthrough  ESD  will  ensure  the  continuation  of  the  internal  monitoring  of  implementation  and \nimpact of the RIP and IRP. ESD, therefore, will need to improve its monitoring and evaluation \ncapacity. \n    \n56. \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).   \n \n57. \nIn  July  2006,  a  detailed  consultation  program  (as  part  of  the  due  diligence)  was \nconducted with 250 affected people living along the ROW in eight divisional secretariats through \nwhich the highway is being constructed. The interviewees indicate that they are more concerned \nwith  temporary  environmental  problems  arising  from  construction  works  such  as  dust,  noise, \nsteep  embankments  that  cause  damage  to  houses,  blocked  access  roads,  water  logging,  and \nfloods than with social issues such as compensation payment, amount of compensation, LARC \nassistance, and livelihood restoration programs.  \n \n\nThe  proposed  widening  of  the  highway  from  two  to  four  lanes  will  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment-Related Aspects \n\n58. \nThe  Government,  based  on  its  National  Environment  Act,  ensured  that  the  1999  EIA \ncovered the construction of a six-lane highway, and therefore no EIA is required for expansion \nto four lanes. However, road expansion from two to four lanes is classified as an \u201cA\u201d project in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy.  Accordingly,  an  EIA  study  was  undertaken.  The \nsummary  EIA  was  disclosed  through  ADB\u2019s  website  and  circulated  to  the  Board  on  19  April \n2007. The resulting EMP was submitted to CEA for endorsement and necessary incorporation \ninto the current EMP. CEA endorsed the EMP on 3 September 2007.  \n \nThe  environmental  due  diligence  was  a  two-pronged  approach11.  Stage  1  is  related  to \n59. \nthe EIA for constructing a two-lane highway on the final alignment and Galle access road. Stage \n2 focused on assessing impacts associated with expansion from two lanes to four lanes within \nthe  six-lane  ROW.  The  stage  2  study  concluded  that  the  construction  impacts  will  be  broadly \nsimilar to those of stage 1. Construction of four lanes will require another 2 years, and therefore, \nthe  environmental  impacts  associated  with  construction  such  as  dust,  noise,  water  logging, \ndisruption of access, etc. will continue until the end of 2009. The amount of unsuitable soil that \nneeds to be disposed of will increase by around 400,000 cubic meters.   \n \n\n                                                 \n11  The  approach  takes  into  account  the  1999  EIA  report,  environmental  findings  report,  and  supplementary \n\nenvironmental assessment for the final trace. \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nTwo consultations on environment-related matters were conducted with people affected. \n60. \nThe first consultation during 21\u201325 May 2006 gathered public concerns on the plan to expand to \na four-lane highway. Concerns are mainly related to construction activities such as dust, noise, \nstagnant water, etc. The second consultation during 13\u201316 July 2006 discussed the proposed \nEMP. The public supports the proposed EMP, with the expectation that environmental impacts \nassociated with construction works will be properly mitigated.  \n  \n61. \nThe EMP will be strictly implemented by all parties: contractor, CSC and PMU. RDA will \nstrengthen its efforts to improve EMP implementation. ESD will be involved in monitoring EMP \nimplementation,  taking  a  role  as  a  monitoring  party  outside  the  Project  but  within  RDA.  The \nEnvironmental  Monitoring  Committee,  chaired  by  CEA  with  members  from  other  relevant \ngovernment  agencies  and  local  government,  will  continue  with  its  role  as  an  independent \nmonitoring party within the Government.     \n \nE. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\nRevised  costs  for  the  Project,  including  those  financed  by  the  supplementary  loan,  are \n\n62. \nestimated at $448.60 million including taxes and duties (Table 2). \n \n\nTable 2: Revised Cost Estimatesa  \n($ million) \n\n \n \nOriginal \nCost \n\nOriginal \nCost after \nReallocation \nof Cost \n\n \nAdditional \nCost \nOverrun \n\n \nCost for \nFour \nLanes \n\n \n \nRevised \nTotal Cost \n\n \n \n \nItem \nA.

The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \nG. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n64. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $90,000,000.00  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to finance the Project\u2019s cost overrun and widening of the Southern Highway. The loan \nwill  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n\nTable 3: Investment Plan for the Supplementary Loan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n1.

The agreed action plan between ADB and the \nGovernment is being monitored on a monthly basis, especially to increase the productivity of the \ncontractor and the efficiency of the supervision works of the CSC, management consultant, and \nPMU.  Land  acquisition, the  major  cause  of  delay,  is  now  complete.  The  geotechnical  and  soil \nconditions  are  better  known  now.  The  revised  cost  estimates  are  based  on  detailed  design \ntaking into account the terrain conditions and current market price, so no further cost overrun is \nexpected. \n \nTo  improve  the  Project\u2019s  performance,  the  civil  works  have  been  divided  into  two \n68. \ncontract  packages.  Package  1 \nfrom \ninvolves  construction  of  a \nKurundugahatekma  to  Pinnaduwa  interchange  and  Galle  access  road.  Package  2  involves \nconstruction of highway from Pinnaduwa interchange to Godagama. There will be two separate \nCSCs  to  supervise  implementation  of  each  civil  works  contract  package.  The  contractors  are \nexpected to concentrate resources to achieve the target completion date.    \n \nI. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nfour-lane  highway \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n69. \nA  project  coordinating  committee  was  to  be  established  and  chaired  by  the  RDA \nchairperson.  Due  to  the  complexity  of  the  Project,  the  committee  has  been  chaired  by  the \nsecretary,  Ministry  of  Highways,  which  recently  was  renamed  the  Ministry  of  Highways  and \nRoad  Development  (MOHRD).  Accordingly,  for  the  supplementary  loan,  while  MOHRD  will  be \nthe  Executing  Agency,  RDA  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  project  implementation.  The \ncurrent PMU will continue its responsibility for day-to-day project management. PMU is headed \nby  the  additional  general  manager  of  RDA  as  the  project  director,  assisted  by  an  additional \nproject  director,  two  deputy  project  directors,  five  senior  and  chief  engineers,  an  accountant, \nand  supporting  staff.  The  project  coordinating  committee,  comprising  representatives  from  the \nExternal Resources Department, RDA, National Planning Department, JBIC, ADB, management \nconsultant,  and  CSC  will  continue  to  coordinate  implementation  of  both  the  ADB-  and  JBIC-\nfinanced sections. \n\n\f \n70. \nADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission (SLRM) will continue administering the Project. The \nSLRM will closely monitor the Project's management; participate in monthly project coordinating \ncommittee  meetings;  and  ensure  quality  control,  speedy  implementation,  and  rapid  assistance \nto  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies on  procurement,  disbursement,  and  other  project \nimplementation matters. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe civil works will be substantially completed by 31 December 2009, and the loan will \n\n71. \nbe closed on 30 December 2010. The revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n72. \nFor the ADB-funded section, procurement of works required under the Project has been  \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. The procurement plan \nis  in  Appendix  6.  The  expansion  of  works  to  add  two  lanes  adjacent  to  the  ongoing  works  to \nmake four lanes has resulted in technical and operating difficulties for two different contractors \nto work side-by-side. Therefore, the following arrangements have been adopted: \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nThe existing contract was restructured to include construction of four lanes over a \nreduced  length,  covering  the  first  section  of  the  highway,  which  is  from \nKurundugahahetekma to the Pinnaduwa interchange, and the Galle access road \n(package  1);  and  releasing  the  construction  works  for  the  section  from \nPinnaduwa interchange to Godagama in Matara (package 2). The negotiation for \nrestructuring  the  civil  works  contract  was  conducted  by  the  Sub-committee  on \nInvestment Facilitation chaired by the President of Sri Lanka on 16 July 2007 and \napproved  by  Cabinet  on  27  December  2007.  The  existing  contract  is  being \namended to reflect the result of the negotiations. \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  balance  of  works  in  the  second  section  (package  2),  from  the  Pinnaduwa \ninterchange to Godagama in Matara, including construction of four lanes, will be \nprocured  by \nlaw  and \nprocedures, or cofinancier\u2019s procurement procedure, if any.  \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthe  Government \n\nthe  national \n\n \nFor the ADB-financed portion, supply contracts for road safety equipment over $500,000 \n73. \nwill  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding.  Contracts  below  this  threshold  will  be \nprocured using limited international bidding and/or national competitive bidding for contracts of \n$100,000\u2013$500,000,  and  under  the  shopping  method  for  contracts  up  to  $100,000.  Direct \npurchase/contracting  will  be  used  for  procurement  of  road  management  system  software \napplication and training.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n74.  Management  Consultant. The existing management consultant, financed by NDF, will \ncontinue  its  service  until  the  end  of  2008.  Thereafter,  an  additional  34  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants\u2019  and  218  of  national  consultants\u2019  inputs  will  be  required  under  the \nsupplementary  loan.  The  consulting  team  will  be  engaged  following  QCBS  procedures  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nfor \n\n(i)  preparing \n\ntime).  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  management  consultant  are  outlined  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D.  \n  \n75. \nConstruction  Supervision  Consultant.  The  existing  CSC,  financed  under  the \napproved Project, will continue its service until February 2008. Under the supplementary loan, \nadditional inputs of about 140 person-months of international consultants and 1,040 of national \nconsultants  will  be  required.  The  consultant  will  be  recruited  using  single-source  selection \nprocedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The current CSC is \nfour-lane  highway,  \nresponsible \n(ii) assisting RDA in negotiating contract restructuring, (iii) assessing the remaining works of the \nsecond section, and (iv) preparing bidding and contract documents for both the first and second \nsections. The terms of reference for the work to be financed by the supplementary loan are a \nnatural  continuation  of  previous  and  ongoing  work  by  the  existing  CSC.  Therefore,  extending \nthe services of the existing CSC consultant, for supervising the completion of the construction \nworks under the supplementary loan is in the Project\u2019s best interest. This approach will ensure \ntechnical  consistency  and  oversight  continuity,  minimize  required  consulting  inputs,  and \nminimize  liability  risks.  Also,  given  the  historical  issues  of  soil  conditions,  rock  cuts,  and \ncomplexity  of the construction contract\u2019s terms and  conditions, continuity of the CSC is critical \nand  presents  a  clear  advantage  over  a  new  competitive  selection.  The  modified  terms  of \nreference are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n\nthe  detailed  design  of \n\nthe \n\n5. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n76. \nTo ensure continuity of the works and minimize disturbance, the Government may need \nto  fund  expenditures  before  the  supplementary  loan  is  approved.  It  has  requested  retroactive \nfinancing to finance the civil works prior to provision of the proposed supplementary loan. The \nGovernment  has  agreed  that  (i)  the  procurement  procedures  are  to  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants; (ii) the expenditures \nto  be  retroactively  financed  will  not  exceed  20%  of  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  and  will \nnot be incurred more than 12 months prior to the execution of the loan agreement; and (iii) any \nconcurrence  by  ADB  with  the  procedures,  documentation,  or  proposal  for  award  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the project until the Board approves the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n77. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, MOHRD, and RDA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n78. \nADB\u2019s  midterm  review  of  the  original  loan  found  no  indication  of  any  potential  fraud  or \ncorruption. The Government will continue to ensure that the project funds are utilized effectively \nand  efficiently  to  implement  the  Project  and  to  achieve  its  objectives.  The  Government  will \nensure  that  RDA  (i)  discloses  contract  awards  on  its  website,  (ii)  undertakes  necessary \n\n\fmeasures  to  create  and  sustain  a  corruption-free  environment,  (iii)  ensures  that  the \nGovernment\u2019s Anticorruption Law and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are strictly enforced and are \ncomplied  with  during  project  implementation,  and  (iv)  conducts  periodic  inspections  on  the \nproject contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. The Government will \ncooperate  with  any  audit  and  investigation,  as  discussed  and  agreed  upon,  and  extend \nnecessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records  as  well  as \nengagement  of  independent  auditors  and  experts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory \ncompletion of such audits and investigations. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n79. \nThe supplementary loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The civil work contracts, consulting services, \nand road safety equipment will be disbursed using ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures.  \n \n80. \nThe original loan was funded from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, and therefore, both \nSpecial  Funds  and  OCR  resources  will  be  available  for  the  Project.  The  original  loan  will  be \ndisbursed first until fully committed; the PMU will facilitate this. The original loan will at all times \nand  in  all  respects  be  held,  used,  committed,  invested,  or  otherwise  disposed  of  entirely \nseparate from the OCR loan from ADB.  \n \n81. \nThe  current  imprest  account  for  the  1999  loan,  which  was  originally  used  for \ndisbursements  for  black  spot  improvement  and  incremental  expenditure  of  the  PMU,  will  be \ncontinued  to  cover  only  disbursement  of  incremental  expenditure  of  the  PMU  since  the  road \nsafety  component  of  the  original  loan  has  been  completed.  Once  the  1999  loan  is  fully \ncommitted,  a  new  imprest  account  for  the  OCR  loan  will  be  established  for  disbursement  of \nincremental  expenditure  of  the  PMU.  The  initial  advance  to  the  new  imprest  account  will  be  6 \nmonths of the estimated expenditure to be paid through the new imprest account or 10% of the \nOCR loan amount, whichever is lower. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure may be used to either \nreimburse or liquidate the imprest advance up to a ceiling of $50,000.  \n  \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n82. \nRDA and its PMU will continue to maintain separate project accounts. These statements \nwill be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an independent auditor \nacceptable to ADB. The audited reports and financial statements are to be submitted to ADB not \nlater than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. To reach the target, RDA will submit the \nunaudited reports and financial statements to the auditor general within 3 months after the end \nof each fiscal year. The imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will be audited as part \nof the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of the examination of the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditures will be separate in the auditor\u2019s report. RDA has been made aware of \nADB's  policy  on  delayed  submission  and  of  the  importance  of  satisfactory  and  acceptable \nquality of audited reports.  \n \nThe current reporting arrangements will be continued. The management consultant will \n83. \nprovide  MOHRD,  RDA,  JBIC,  and  ADB  with  brief  monthly  progress  reports  based  on  detailed \nreports prepared by the CSCs of both the ADB- and JBIC-financed sections. When the Project \nis complete, the PMU, assisted by the management consultant and CSCs, will prepare a project \ncompletion report in a format acceptable to MOHRD, JBIC, and ADB.     \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\n  \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n84.  Within  3  months  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  supplementary  loan,  the  current  benefit \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  be  improved  to  a  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation system based on the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) in consultation \nwith  ADB.  Within  6  months  of  effectiveness  of  the  supplementary  loan,  the  first  survey  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with the new system. RDA will propose key indicators, and data will \nbe compiled in a format developed in consultation with ADB.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nProject  reviews  will  be  conducted \n\nto  ensure  effective  project \n85. \nimplementation.  RDA  will  monitor  project  implementation  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  any \nsignificant  problems  that  may  result  in  the  schedule  not  being  met.  ADB  will  field  a  project \ncompletion review mission 1 year after project completion.  \n \n\ntwice  a  year \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n86. \nA  TA  for  $300,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  for \nLand Use Planning of the Southern Highway Corridor. The TA will plan land use and a spatial \npattern  of  development  along  1.5  km  on  each  side  of  the  project  highway.  The  Urban \nDevelopment  Authority  will  implement  the  TA  in  close  consultation  with  MOHRD.  The  overall \nobjectives of TA are to (i) prepare a long-term corridor development plan to guide and regulate \nfuture growth of the Southern Highway Corridor, (ii) set out appropriate strategies to implement \nthe  long-term  objectives  of  the  Corridor  Development  Plan  and  facilitate  implementation  of \npriority  projects,  (iii)  identify  priority  projects  and  prepare  prototype  project  proposals  for \nintersection area development, and (iv) facilitate implementation of priority projects. Details on \nthe TA and its costs are in Appendix 7.  \n \n87. \nA team of consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. The TA will be implemented in 12 months starting in June 2008, with input from \nan international urban/regional planner consultant for 6 person-months, and 20 person-months  \nof  national  consultants  comprising  an  urban/regional  planner,  to  act  as  deputy  team  leader; \ninfrastructure engineer; sociologist or socio development specialist; environmental planner; and \neconomist.   \n \n88. \nclosely with the consultant team.    \n \n\nThe Government will provide office space, and counterpart staff will be assigned to work \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  construction  of  the  four-lane  highway.  The \n89. \napproach follows standard practice of comparing life-cycle road agency and user costs with and \nwithout  the  Project.  The  Highway  Development  and  Management  Model  HDM-4  was  used  as \nthe  basis  for  the  analysis,  which  focuses  on  transport  cost  savings.  Value  added  from  better \ntransport links resulting in new industries and employment is not quantified in this analysis but is \n\n\fcaptured  through  benefits  to  generated  traffic.  The  summary  of  the  economic  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 8. \n \n90. \nThe  analysis  follows  the  same  approach  as  was  followed  when  appraising  the  original \nProject,  with  updating  of  the  following  aspects:  (i)  traffic  growth  rate  revised  upward  based  on \nthe economic growth outlook, eastward development of Colombo, and past traffic growth trends; \n(ii) vehicle operating costs updated considering the substantial increase in fuel costs compared \nwith other components of vehicle operating costs; and (iii) vehicle operating cost savings to local \ntraffic on A2 considered similar to those for long distance traffic on A2. In addition, incremental \nbenefits  of  four  lanes  were  taken  into  account,  comparing  it  with  two  lanes  based  on  better \nservice,  which  includes  (i)  higher  traffic  diversion,  (ii)  greater  time  saving,  and  (iii)  more \ngenerated  traffic  for  four  lanes.  The  cost  estimate  is  based  on  the  most  recent  restructuring \nnegotiations for the current contract, including the cost overrun element of the contract. \n \n91. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  as  15.3%.  The  sensitivity  of \neconomic internal rate of return for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i)  cost \nincreases  by  15%,  (ii)  no  benefits  to  local  traffic,  (iii)  traffic  growth  rates  reduced  by  25%,  \n(iv)  generated  traffic  reduced  by  50%,  (v)  accident  reduction  benefits  reduced  by  50%,  and  \n(vi) overall benefits reduced by 15%. The results show that the quantified economic benefits are \nrobust to various sensitivity tests.  \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\nRDA will incur maintenance costs comprising operating cost, routine maintenance, and \n92. \nperiodic maintenance. The annual maintenance cost without periodic maintenance will amount \nto  $2  million,  or  about  5%  of  the  MOHRD  budget  for  road  maintenance  for  2007.  The \nmaintenance  costs  will  be  required  after  project  completion  in  2010,  and  the  first  periodic \nmaintenance will be required in 2017. Considering the trend in recent years, maintenance funds \nare expected to be available to meet these new costs. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Aspects \n\n93. \nThe review of environmental impacts related to the expansion of the two-lane highway to \nfour lanes indicates that the environmental impacts of the construction will be broadly similar to \nconstruction of a two-lane road. However, an additional construction time of around 2 years will \nbe required, and therefore, the environmental impacts associated with construction such as dust, \nnoise,  water  logging,  disruption  of  access,  etc.  will  continue  until  2009.  The  amount  of \nunsuitable soil that needs to be disposed of will increase by around 400,000 cubic meters. The \nenvironmental impacts related with the operation will include increasing noise and air pollution.    \n \n94. \nThe  mitigation  measures  recommended  by  the  EIA  that  have  been  incorporated  in  the \nrevised  EMP  need  to  be  properly  enforced  and  monitored.  Requirements  to  implement \nmitigation  measures  during  construction  have  been  incorporated  in  the  civil  works  contract \naddendum. RDA will continue to be responsible in implementing the overall EMP and monitoring \nthe  implementation of mitigation measures during construction and operation of the highway.  \n \n95. \nAlthough  the  EIA  did  not  cover  the  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with \ninduced  development  along  the  highway,  some  environmental  impacts  could  be  result  from \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n\f 22 \n\nchanging  land  use.  The  attached  TA  will  develop  a  land  use  plan  for  the  Southern  Highway \nCorridor  to  provide  rule  and  order  to,  among  other  things,  avoid  or  minimize  environmental \nimpacts associated with changing land use.  \n \nThe  recommendations  from  the  social  due  diligence  and  EIA  will  facilitate  project \n96. \nimplementation, especially to address environmental and social impacts related to construction \nworks.    \n   \nSince  the  supplementary  loan  does  not  change  the  original  project  objectives,  the \n97. \nProject  is  still  expected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  Southern  Province,  especially  in \nGalle, Hambantota, Kalutara, and Ratnapura districts. The Project will continue to provide equal \nopportunities for women and men. In addition, it will provide measures for preventing the spread \nof  sexually  transmitted  disease  and  HIV/AIDs.  Since  this  highway  will  be  the  first  high-speed \nhighway in Sri Lanka, a comprehensive public information campaign on highway use needs to \nbe  systematically  conducted.  In  addition,  the  recommendations  from  the  changes  in  land  use \nstudy need to be adequately disclosed to the public, enabling them to practice appropriate land \nuse control mechanisms along the highway, particularly at interchanges. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n   \nD. \n\nRisks  \n\n98. \nCivil society has been extremely interested in the development and construction of the \nSouthern  Highway.  RIP  implementation  needs  to  be  systematically  implemented  and  any \nunexpected  impacts  mitigated  as  quickly  as  possible.  In  addition,  strict  enforcement  of  EMP \nimplementation  is  necessary  to  avoid  complaints  from  affected  people,  which  could  delay \ncompletion of construction. The contractors will need to strengthen and show their seriousness \nin implementing the EMP and addressing environmental problems associated with its activities. \nPaying  compensation  for  disturbances  due  to  their  activities  will  not  be  adequate;  the \ncontractors need to mitigate environmental impacts from their activities.    \n \n99. \nTimely  completion  of  civil  works  is  also  at  risk  if  the  contractors\u2019  performance  is  not \nimproved.  The  work  programs  need  to  be  monitored  systematically  and  contract  obligations \nstrictly enforced.  \n \n100.  All  sections  of  the  highway  should  be  completed  as  it  was  scheduled,  allowing  the \nbenefits  to  be  directly  recognized.  The  benefits  and  positive  impacts  of  the  Project  will \nthe  Government\u2019s \nmaterialize,  assuming \ncommitment to developing the national road network and economic infrastructure will continue. \n \n\nthat  complementary  external  assistance  and \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n101. \nIn  addition  to  the  specific  covenants  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement  (Special \nOperations)  and  the  Project  Agreement,  both  dated  16  December  1999,  the  Government, \nMOHRD,  and  RDA,  have  given  the  following  assurances,  which  are  incorporated  in  the  legal \ndocuments.  \n \n102.  Environment. The Government will cause MOHRD and RDA to ensure that  \n\n \n(i) \n\nthe  Project \n\nis  designed,  constructed, \n\nimplemented,  and  maintained \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n23\n\naccordance with the Government\u2019s National Environmental Act. No. 47 of 1980, \nas amended, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); \nthe revised EMP is implemented in accordance with its terms so that all adverse \nenvironmental impacts during construction and operation of the project highway \nare  mitigated;  and  in  the  event  of  any  unanticipated  adverse  environmental \nimpacts, such impacts are reported to CEA and ADB, and remedial actions taken \nto mitigate the impacts in consultation with the affected persons, CEA, and ADB; \nnecessary  staff  and  resources  are  provided  to  the  environmental  monitoring \ncommittee and ESD to enable it to review, audit, and monitor implementation of \nthe EMP;  \ncontractors  and  supervision  contractors  are  provided  with  the  approved  EMP, \nEIA,  and  summary  EIA;  and  the  contractors  implement  the  required  mitigation \nmeasures  as  described  in  the  EMP  in  a  satisfactory  manner,  and  report  on  the \nimplementation of the EMP on a regular basis, along with any deviation from the \nEIA; and  \nthe management consultant submits a monitoring report every 6 months to ADB \nand to the environmental monitoring committee through CEA.   \n\n \n103.  Resettlement and Social Development. The Government will cause MOHRD and RDA \nto \n \n\nimplement  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  ADB's  due  diligence  report \ndated August 2006 on the involuntary resettlement process; \nfully implement the IRP and strengthen the management information system by \ntaking into account recommendations from the gender study and the independent \nexternal monitoring agency, expeditiously complete the infrastructure facilities at \nthe last one resettlement site, and hand this over to the local authorities by June \n2008;  \npromptly provide new title deeds for the allotments at the resettlement sites and \nentitlement  certificates  to  all  affected  persons  whose  properties  were  acquired \nunder the Project; \nin the event of any additional land acquisition during construction works, submit \nan  addendum  to  the  RIP  for  ADB  approval,  disclose  it  to  the  affected  persons, \nand  fully  compensate  the  affected  persons  according  to  the  RIP,  prior  to \ncontinuing with follow-up construction works in the relevant section;  \nin an exceptional or unforeseen situation, such as a landslide during construction \nthat  may  endanger  life,  residences  and  other  structures,  relocate  the  affected \npersons \nfully \ncompensated and resettled, if required, soon thereafter according to the RIP; \ndeposit  promptly  with \nlocal  court,  any  statutory  compensation  and \nresettlement  assistance,  which  is  yet  to  be  paid  to  affected  persons  due  to \nreasons such as joint ownerships or disputed claims;  \nin  the  event  of  any  mishap  or  accident  at  the project  site,  ensure  that  the  party \nresponsible  for  the  accident  will  compensate  the  affected  person  in  a  prompt, \nequitable, and transparent manner; and  \nprovide  necessary  staff  to  ESD  to  enable  it  to  review,  audit,  and  monitor  the \nimplementation of the RIP and IRP. \n\ninform  ADB,  and  ensure \n\nimmediately  and \n\nthey  are \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 24 \n\n104.  Thoroughfares  Act  and  the  Motor  Traffic  Act.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nThoroughfares Act  (earlier known as the National Highway Act), and the Motor Traffic Act, are \napproved  by  Cabinet,  and  submitted  to  Parliament  by  September  2008,  and  will  thereafter \nsecure early enactment of the two laws. \n \n105.  Midterm Review. The Government will ensure that the recommendations of the midterm \nreview  of  the  original  loan  undertaken  by  ADB  are  implemented,  and  that  the  action  plan  is \nreviewed and monitored by the Project Coordination Committee. \n \n106.  Project  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  System.  Within  3  months  of  the \neffectiveness  of  the  supplementary  loan,  the  Government  will  adopt  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  based  on  the  revised  design  and  monitoring  framework  in \nconsultation with ADB. \n \n107.  Cofinancing.  In  the  event  the  Government  receives  cofinancing  for  civil  works  in  the \nGovernment-financed  section  of  the  highway,  the  Government  will  cause  the  cofinancier\u2019s \nacceptance of the EMP, RIP, and IRP, and unified approach to implementing and monitoring the \nall  sections  of  the  Project,  and  cause  such  cofinancier  to  reach  a  suitable  understanding  with \nADB. \n \n108.  Counterpart Funds. The Government will make available the funds, facilities, services, \nand other resources as shall be necessary or required, for timely completion of the Project, and \nshall  furnish  to  ADB,  promptly  at  its  request,  evidence  satisfactory  to  ADB  that  such  funds, \nfacilities, services, other resources are available for purposes related to the Project.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n109. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe major change in scope, as described in paragraphs 36-41; and \nthe  supplementary  loan  of  $90,000,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of \nSri Lanka for the Southern Transport Development Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements presented to the Board.  \n\n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n     President \n\n \n13 February 2008 \n\n\fREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n25 \n\n \n \nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \nAssumption:  \nEconomy remains stable \nand environment is \nconducive to economic \ngrowth. \n\nData Sources/ \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n1.

Additional  costs  for \nmanaging  the  Project  contribute  only  3%  of  the  cost  overrun.  The  increase  in  supervision \nconsultant costs were covered by reallocating the contingencies from the original project costs. \n \n2. \nThe  approved  civil  works  contract  was  $87  million.  The  forecasted  project  cost  for  the \noriginal contract is estimated to be $156.6 million, including provisional allowance of $15 million \nfor claims. The summary of the calculation on cost overrun is in Table A3. \n \n\nTable A3: Summary Calculation of Cost Overrun \n($ million) \n\n \n\n130.40  45.00  \n\nCost \nOverrun \n\nIncreased Cost of Works \n\n \n15.00 \n6.60 \n2.90 \n\n85.40  Cost of works (without \n\n \nRevised Costs \n\n \n0.00 \n \n1.60 \n87.00 \n\n \n15.00 \n14.00 \n4.50 \n156.50  69.50 \n\ncontingencies but \nincluding price escalation \nof $2.5 million) \n \nClaims                    \nValue-added tax \nContingencies \n \n\n \nOriginal Contract Price \nCost of works (without contingencies \nbut including price escalation of \n$2.50 million, including value-added \ntax of about $7.40 million) \n \nClaims \n \nContingencies 3% \n \nSource: Roughton International, Monthly Progress Report No. 54, July 2007. \n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  increased  cost  of  works  is  mainly  due  to  undetermined  geological  and  soil \nconditions;  and  price  escalation  due  to  increased  prices  of  bitumen,  cement,  steel,  fuel,  and \nhuman resources. \n \n4. \nThe  geological  and  soil  conditions  significantly  increased  the  required  earth  works  and \nresulted in unexpected costs for replacing soft soil. The total cost of earth works increased from \n$35.85  million  to  $49.50  million.  This  mainly  reflects  the  increased  amount  of  soil  to  be \nexcavated and preparation of the embankment, including pile embankment; and increased cost \nfor  construction  of  major  bridges  and  concrete  underpasses,  and  for  general  items  such  as \noperating vehicles. \n \nThe  price  factors  contributing  to  cost  escalation  are  increased  cost  of  construction \n5. \nmaterials  in  the  international  market  resulting  in  increased  prices  in  the  local  market,  and  the \npost-tsunami  construction  boom.  The  data  from  the  Institute  of  Construction  Training \nDevelopment  shows  that  the  price  of  steel  increased  by  120%  during  2001\u20132006,  while  fuel \nincreased by approximately 100%. Increases in the price of cement have been more moderate, \nat approximately 45%. Labor costs significantly increased over the past 5 years ranging varying \nbetween 50% (skilled labor) and 63% (unskilled labor). \n  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nClaims \n\nB. \n \n6. \nThe contractor has submitted 618 claims to date for both time and additional costs; 96 \nhave  been  converted  to  variation  orders.  The  total  value  of  claims  including  additional  sums \nclaimed  under  variations  now  stands  at  $11.4  million.  Aside  from  the  variation  orders,  the \nengineer has certified an eligible claim for $1.8 million. The outstanding claims are now being \nprocessed by the Dispute Advisory Board.  \n \nC. \n \n7. \nThe  original  contract  was  awarded  when  the  value-added  tax  was  10%.  To  obtain  the \ncontract price, the tax was applied to all pay items in the bills of quantity, except the provisional \nsums. On 1 January 2004, the value-added tax was increased to 15%. The contract permits any \nretrospective  increase  in  taxes  to  be  refunded  to  the  contractor  on  proof  of  payment.  The \nincrease  in the  value  of  the  contract  is  therefore  zero,  but the  payment  and  reimbursement  of \nthe taxes will increase to $6.60 million.  \n\nValue-Added Tax  \n\n \n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nFOR SUPPLEMENTARY LOANa   \n\n($ million)\n\nCost overrun \nfor 2-lane\n\nFour-laning \nIncremental\n\nTotal\n\nADB\n\n$ million\n\n%\n\nGovernment\n%\n\n$ million\n\n40.10\n\n0.50\n1.60\n\n2.00\n1.50\n\n98.40\n8.00\n2.80\n0.50\n0.40\n4.90\n\n4.75\n7.25\n\n6.00\n0.40\n\n138.50\n8.00\n2.80\n1.00\n2.00\n4.90\n\n6.75\n8.75\n\n6.00\n0.40\n\n69.25\n8.00\n1.30\n1.00\n\n50.0%\n100.0%\n46.4%\n100.0%\n\n2.45\n\n50.0%\n\n69.25\n\n50.0%\n\n1.50\n\n53.6%\n\n2.00\n2.45\n\n100.0%\n50.0%\n\n3.50\n4.50\n\n51.9%\n51.4%\n\n3.25\n4.25\n\n48.1%\n48.6%\n\n6.00\n0.40\n\n100.0%\n100.0%\n\n45.70\n\n133.40\n\n179.10\n\n90.00\n\n50.3%\n\n89.10\n\n49.7%\n\nA.

The \nGovernment  has  decided  to  prepare  a  detailed  planning  study  for  the  interchange  of  the \nSouthern  Highway,  to  ensure  that  area  development  can  be  properly  and  transparently \nmanaged. The goal of the technical assistance (TA) is to assist UDA in developing guidelines \nunder a development plan for this area, as well as for the 11 interchanges within this corridor to \nsupport  the  development  objectives  of  the  Southern  Highway  and  national  development \nprograms.  \n \n2. \nThe  overall  objectives  of  the  proposed  study  are  to  (i)  prepare  a  long-term  corridor \ndevelopment plan to guide and regulate future growth of the Southern Highway Corridor, (ii) set \nout  appropriate  strategies  to  implement  the  long-term  objectives  of  the  corridor  development \nplan and to facilitate implementation of priority projects, (iii) identify priority projects and prepare \nprototype  project  proposals \nthe \nfor \nimplementation of priority projects.  \n \nB. \n \n \n \n3. \nHighway Corridor over the next 20 years. The study will include the following tasks:   \n\nThe  study  is  to  help  UDA  determine  the  scale  and  direction  of  growth  of  the  Southern \n\nintersection  area  development,  and  (iv) \n\nScope of the Study \n\nfacilitate \n\nScope  \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nAssess the existing situation along the highway and the surrounding towns within \nthe  corridor, \nland  use, \ntopographical features, resources, and environmental conditions. \n\ntrends,  socioeconomics, \n\nincluding  demographic \n\nIdentify  the  present  transport  network  within  the  planning  area  and  its  potential \nfor future area development. Identify and locate potential areas for development \nof townships and industrial areas along access roads to the highway. \n\nDevelop  scenarios  of  medium-  and  long-term  growth  of  the  corridor  taking  into \nconsideration the findings of items (i) and (ii).  \n\nAssess  a  range  of  realistic  standards  and  standard  physical  features  for  future \ncorridor  development,  including  density  standards  and  estimates  of  the  area  of \nland required to accommodate future development.  \n\nIdentify  the  suitability  of  the  area  along  the  corridor  for  various  land  uses, \nincluding  commercial,  industrial,  residential,  agricultural,  tourism,  small-scale \nindustrial  villages,  and  ecological  zones  with  the  objective  of  developing  the \ncorridor for efficient land use and functioning of the transport corridor.  \n\nIdentify  locations  for  the  highway  information  center,  emergency  areas,  public \ntransport  terminals,  filling  stations,  rest  areas,  and  tourist  information  center \nalong the corridor.  \n\n(vii) \n\nIdentify the impact area of the highway corridor for efficient management of land-\nuse to facilitate operation and management of the highway. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n4. \nfollowing tasks: \n\n(i) \n\n(viii)  Review the adequacy of the corridor at the interchange. \n\n(ix) \n\nConduct an initial assessment of the environment and social aspects to provide \nrecommendations  for  effective  land  use  planning  by  including  the  possibility  of \nlocal communities to benefit from development of the interchanges. \n\n(x) \n\nDevelop criteria and guidelines for private sector participation. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Strategy \n\nThe  consultants  have  to  prepare  the  implementation  strategy  by  at  least  covering  the \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIdentify  development  plan  areas  that  are  likely  to  be  a  high  priority  for \ndevelopment  purposes,  and  enumerate  key  opportunities  for  land  development \nor more profitable land uses, including interchange development plans along the \nhighway. Give special consideration to the proposed Greater Galle Development \nPlan  and  Greater  Matara  Development  Plan  in  preparing  the  future  settlement \nplan. \n\nDevelop  prioritization  and  sequencing  for  land  development  opportunities \nidentified in (i), and provide a brief profile of each identified area. \n\nAssess  resources  likely  to  be  available  to  meet  the  objectives  of  the  Southern \nHighway  Corridor  development  plan,  including  public  and  private  investment  or \nfinancing resources. \n\nDevelop  investment  promotion  plans  for  industrial  estates,  tourist  destinations, \ncommercial areas, small-scale industrial villages, etc. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPriority Projects \n\nThe  consultants  have  to  recommend  the  development  plan  for  priority  interchanges  in \n\n5. \nclose consultation with the UDA and RDA, and follow the following steps:   \n\nSelect  at  least  the  three  most  promising  interchanges,  and  prepare  detailed \ndevelopment  plans  for  investment  decision  purposes.  The  plans  should  include \nall  necessary  design  aspects  including  building  standards,  and  ensure  smooth \ntraffic movement to and from the highway.  \n\nPrepare  a  feasibility  study  for  each  of  the  interchange  development  areas, \nincluding  (a)  selection  of  suitable  sites  to  permit  phased  development;  (b)  a \nprofile of the interchange development area, including proposed activities; (c) an \nassessment  of  infrastructure  needs  for  the  proposed  development;  (d)  concept \nplans  for  the  proposed  development  taking  into  account  a  feasible  range  of \noptions  for  business  and  community  purposes;  (e)  preliminary  design,  cost \nestimates,  and  benefit-cost  analysis;  and  (f)  recommendations  for  institutional \nand financial arrangements for implementation of the proposals. \n\n(iii) \n\nDevelop an implementation process and schedule. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Cost Estimates \n\n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe study will be led by an international urban planner (team leader, 6 person-months), \nassisted  by  a  team  of  national  consultants  comprising  (i)  an  urban  planner  and  deputy  team \nleader,  6  person-months;  (ii)  an  infrastructure  planner/engineer,  6  person-months;  (iii)  a \nsociologist,  3  person-months;  (iv)  an  environmental  planner,  3  person-months;  and  (v)  an \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n\neconomist, 2 person-months.

The \nanalysis  follows  the  same  approach  used  for  appraisal  of  the  original  loan 1 for  the  Southern \nTransport Development Project, and updated the following aspects: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ntraffic  growth  rate  revised  upward  based  on  the  economic  growth  outlook, \neastward development of Colombo, and traffic growth trends; \nvehicle operating cost (VOC) updated considering the substantial increase in fuel \ncost compared with other components of VOC; and \nVOC  savings  to  local  traffic  on  the  existing  coastal  National  Highway  A2 \nconsidered similar to those for long distance traffic on A2. \n\nTraffic Volume \n\n \n2. \nIn  addition  to  these,  incremental  benefits  of  four  lanes  compared  with  two  lanes  were \nconsidered based  on  improved  service,  such as  (i)  greater  traffic  diversion,  (ii)  increased  time \nsaving, and (iii) higher generated traffic for four lanes. \n \nA. \n \n \n \n3. \nThe Data Collection Unit of the Planning Division of Road Development Authority (RDA) \ncarried out comprehensive traffic surveys and data verifications during 20 June\u201310 July 2006. \nThe  actual  growth  rates  for  1998\u20132006  averaged  6.8%  (Table  A8.1),  while  the  actual  gross \ndomestic product growth per annum was 4.7%.

The  growth \n4. \noutlook  for  the  country\u2019s  economy  in  the  coming  years  is  expected  to  be  over  7%  with  major \nGovernment  initiatives  resulting  in  an  economic  growth  rate  in  the  range  of  7%\u20138%.  The \ndevelopment  policy  now  followed  by  the  Government  as  outlined  in  the  document  Mahinda \nChintana  focuses  on  reducing  poverty,  steering  investment  to  disadvantaged  areas,  and \npromoting agriculture. The Hamnkotta port development has already commenced and a number \nof major associated developments are anticipated in the region. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  1999.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern Transport Development Project. Manila. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Diversion \n\nThe  traffic  growth  rate  of  6.8%  observed  during  1998\u20132006  includes  local  and  long \n5. \ndistance traffic. The average annual traffic growth rates reported for 1991\u20132006 for all national \nhighways  is  8.3%  (Road  Sector  Master  Plan  Report  2007).  With  significantly  higher  economic \ngrowth anticipated for the next 10 years (6%\u20138 %) compared with the last 8 years (4.7%), traffic \nin the southern transport corridor is assumed to grow at least 10%. Therefore, for the present \nanalysis,  overall  growth  of  long  distance  traffic  is  assumed  at  8%  for  the  next  5  years  (2008\u2013\n2013),  then  6.5%  for  the  next  5  years  (2013\u20132018),  and  5.5%  for  the  remaining  period  of \nanalysis.  Considering  the  capacity  constraint  on  A2  as  well  as  likely  shifting  of  development \naway  from  A2  with  the  completion  of  the  Project  and  the  observed  traffic  growth  in  the  last  8 \nyears, the local traffic is assumed to grow at 4% during 2008\u20132013, 3% during 2013\u20132018, and \n2% for the remaining period. These are conservative estimates considering traffic growth trends, \nimproved  economic  growth  outlook,  and  traffic  growth  rates  considered  in  the  Road  Sector \nMaster Plan Report.  \n \n \n \nThe  average  travel  speeds  on  A2  and  the  project  highway  estimated  from  the  HDM-4 \n6. \nmodel for different traffic volumes indicate higher speed for four lanes in terms of daily average \nspeed.  This  means  that  the  average  speed  during  peak  hours  is  even  lower  (by  about  20%). \nThe analysis using highway capacity software indicates that A2 is operating at a level of service \nranging from E to F, and the Project with a two-lane standard will fall below service level C when \nthe  traffic  volume  exceeds  15,000  vehicles  per  day.  The  average  speed  on  the  two-lane-\nstandard project road starts declining beyond 10,000 average daily traffic (ADT) and therefore \nincreased diversion with increased congestion on A2 may not be significant without expanding \nto a four-lane standard.  Additional traffic diversion is considered only with a four-lane standard \nproject highway. \n \n7. \nThe increased diversion over the analysis period assumes significance when the Project \nis expanded to the four-lane standard, which will maintain a higher speed over the entire range \nof anticipated traffic volumes and the overall perception of the higher speed and safer travel on \na four-lane highway is likely to significantly increase traffic diversion on to the four-lane highway. \nAssuming  at  least  20%  higher  diversion  with  a  four-lane-standard  road  is  reasonable;  the \ntransport cost savings to the additional diverted traffic was then calculated.  \n \n \n \nThe Project is expected to decrease travel times by 24%\u201343% as per the estimates of \n8. \nthe 1999 study for long distance traffic. Due to the eastward development of Colombo and the \ndevelopment  of  outer  circular  highway  (OCH)  in  continuing  the  Project,  more  traffic  will  have \ngreater  travel  time  savings  and  no  significant  change  in  travel  distance.  Also  the  traffic \ngenerated away from A2 (i.e., interior areas away from the coastal belt) will have little additional \ndistance to travel for using the project highway. The overall VOC saving for long distance traffic \nusing  the  project  highway  will  be  slightly  more  than  21%\u201330%  for  the  analysis  period  as \ncalculated  based  on  the  weighted  average  VOC  without  considering  the  additional  distance. \nConsidering all these factors, assuming about 25% overall transport cost saving (VOC plus time \nsaving)  for  long  distance  traffic  is  reasonable  to  assess  generated  traffic.  For  the  present \nanalysis, a price elasticity of 1.0 is assumed for the four-lane-standard project highway and the \ngenerated  traffic  resulting  from  the  reduced  transport  cost  thus  will  be  25%  for  the  project \nhighway. \n \n\nGenerated Traffic \n\n3. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nVehicle Operating Cost \n\nThe  Hambantota  port  being  developed  is  likely  to  induce  development  in  the  southern \n9. \nregion. Construction has recently started. The traffic estimates in the Hambantota port study in \n2006  indicate  significant  cargo  handling  of  cement,  wheat/flour,  fertilizer,  vehicles,  liquid  bulk, \nand containers; and potential for coal transshipment, vehicle handling, petroleum refineries, and \nother port-related activities. The estimates indicate cargo handling at 7 million\u201311 million tons by \n2015 increasing to 23 million\u201326 million tons by 2030. This is likely to generate significant traffic \non  all  links  including  the  project  highway.  Since  this  traffic  is  related  to  production  and \nconsumption  in  the  project  influence  area  as  well  as  reassignment  (from  Colombo  port  to \nHambantota)  in  addition  to  development-related  traffic,  it  is  considered  to  be  part  of  the  traffic \ngrowth, and therefore was not considered for conservative estimates. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  increase  in  fuel  cost,  which  is a  major  component  of  VOC,  has  been  substantially \nhigher  than  the  cost  increase  of  other  items  and  therefore  updating  the  VOC  based  on  the \nconsumer price index alone will result in lower VOC estimates. The economic cost of fuel used \nin the 1999 study is SLRs8.82 for petrol and SLRs8.0 for diesel. The economic cost of fuel as \nper  recent  estimates  used  in  the  2007  master  plan  study  is  SLRs50.56  for  diesel  and \nSLRs54.98 for petrol, an increase of over 5 times; whereas the consumer price index adjusted \nprice increase is only about 1.6 times over the same period. The VOC was updated taking into \naccount the weighting of the fuel component in the VOC and the higher increase in fuel prices. \nA  factor  of  1.35  for  cars  and  1.59  for  bus  and  trucks  to  account  for  the  price  increase  and \nadditional  fuel  cost  increase  were  used  to  update  the  VOC  values  from  2007  prices.

They were compared with the values used in the 1999 \nstudy  for  the  A2  and  adjusted  accordingly.  The  assumption  used  by  the  1999  study  for  the \nimprovement  in  accident  rates  for  the  Project  of  40%  for  two  lanes  and  50%  for  four  lanes  is \nreasonable and is used in this analysis. The improvement is based on the fact that pedestrians \nand cyclists will not be allowed on the project highway (Table A8.5). \n \n13. \nDuring  the  initial  period  when  the  two-lane  section  funded  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) will be complete that, the assumption was that if it were open, no accident savings \nwould  be  realized.  Although  the  mix  of  traffic  should  make  the  road  safer,  other  factors  might \nincrease the risk, particularly as the road would be being widened. \n\n \n\nTable A8.5: Accident Rates for A2 and Project \n(per million vehicle-km) \n\n  \n\nAccident Rates \n\n1999 Study Rates \non A2 \n0.360 \n2.320 \n  \n  \n\nAccident \nType \nFatal  \nSerious \nMinor \nDamage only \nADB = Asian Development Bank, km = kilometer, RDA = Road Development Authority. \nSources: Road Development Authority, 1999 study, and consultant. \n \n\nRDA \nNational Rates \n1.000 \n2.320 \n6.715 \n10.129 \n\nRDA \nEstimated A2 \n0.360 \n0.835 \n2.417 \n3.646 \n\n \n\nADB \nEstimated Project \n0.180 \n0.418 \n1.209 \n1.823 \n\n                                                 \n2   Beca  International  Consultants  Ltd.  in  association  with  Fraser  Thomas  Partners  and  Resources  Development \n\nConsultants Ltd.

The  2005 \n14. \ndata  were  inflated  to  2006  prices.  A  comparison  was  made  with  the  results  of  the  RDA  2002 \nRoad Safety Report and with the values used in 1999 study, bringing all economic costs to 2006 \nprices  (Table  A8.6).  The  cost  of  accidents  has  increased  considerably  from  the  1999  study, \nparticularly  for  serious, minor,  and  damage  only.  However,  a  fair  degree  of  consistency  exists \nbetween  the  RDA  2002  Road  Safety  Report  and  the  latest  data  provided  for  2005.

Poverty reduction has also been uneven, urban \npoverty halved between 1990 and 2002, while rural poverty declined by less than 5 percentage points. A \nnumber  of  interrelated  factors  have  constrained  the  poor  from  assessing  opportunities  in  more  dynamic \nsectors  of  the  economy.  Lack  of  infrastructure,  especially  transport  facilities,  has  caused  constraints  for \npeople  living  in  rural  areas  to  reach  market  and  growth  centers.  International  experience  suggests  that \nincreasing transport infrastructure is effective to develop regional growth. Therefore, highway development \nis  expected  to  facilitate  improvement,  capacity,  and  efficiency  of  the  road  network,  especially  through \nsegregation of traffic. This will avoid the possibility of the road network becoming a serious impediment to \nnational development. The Southern Highway connecting Matara to Colombo is expected to improve the \ncapacity and efficiency of road utilization and lead to improved movement of good and services to support \nthe country\u2019s regional development through industry, commerce, and tourism. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention\nThe Southern Highway is mainly located in the Southern Province (Galle, Matara districts) and connecting \nto  Western  Province  through  Kalutara and  touching  Colombo  District  in  Kottawa.  Two  other  districts  are \ndirectly  affected  by  the  Project:  (i)  Ratnapura  District  of  Sabaragamuwa  Province,  and  (ii)  Hambantota \nDistrict of Southern Province.  \n \nThe recent poverty study\u00b9 shows that Southern Province has the highest percentage of the poor compared \nwith other provinces. Except for Kalutara and Colombo, the other districts affected directly and indirectly by \nthe Project rank in the top group of districts with the highest poverty head count. However, the study also \nshows that for Colombo, a large population of the poor live around the border of the city where the Project \nis located. The study also indicates that poor areas are characterized by low connectivity and lack of urban \ncenters  other  than  Colombo.  Several  factors  are  associated  with  a  higher  probability  of  being  poor;  the \nmost important are unemployment including among youth, and underemployment in the informal sector. \n \nThe impacts of the Project will be spread differently over the southern region. The area directly affected by \nthe  Project  may  experience  the  greatest  impacts  in  terms  of  creation  of  direct  and  indirect  employment \nopportunities.  The  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  The  community-based \nassessment  carried  out  during  preparation  of  the  original  loan  shows  that  the  Project  will  be  able  to \ncontribute  to  improvements  in  economic  conditions  through  (i)  improvement  of  transportation  to  allow \nfarmers to diversify into higher value crops, such as fruits and green vegetable; (ii) reduction of travel time \nto increase tourist visits, and therefore, seasonal reductions in tourism will be moderate; (iii) improvement \nof access to markets and sources of inputs will lead to expansion of manufacturing; and (iv) development \nof  facilities  in  the  interchange  will  lead  to  establishment  of  economic  growth  centers  and  formal  sector \nemployment. Such improvements are expected to lead to improvements in living standards and quality of \nlife. The following impacts were identified: (i) More remunerative employment and livelihoods will lead to a \nreduction  in  poverty  and  unemployment.  (ii)  The  Project  will  bring  long-term  solutions  to  unemployment \namong the youth and females by providing access to education and increasing access to employment in \nnearby centers. (iii) Faster travel will improve quality of life for many families with adult members especially \nhousehold heads working in Colombo. (iv) Buses and transport services will be more frequent and better \nquality.  (v)  The  Project  will  establish  a  political  momentum  leading  to  improvement  in  transport  and \ncommunication.  (vi)  Educational  institutions  will  be  able  to  attract  better  quality  staff.  (vii)  People  will  be \nable to reach hospitals more quickly.   In addition, the private sector expects  the highway  will significantly \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n53 \n\nimprove attractiveness of the southern region for business and private investment, and contribute to more \nrapid economic growth. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n  Yes \n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n   No \n\n \n \n\n \n\nThe consultations to disseminate information on the plan for expansion of the Southern Highway from two \nto four lanes and to gather the concerns of people living along the highway were carried out at 20 locations \nin  8  divisional  secretariats  and  attended  by  around  250  people.  Concerns  focus  more  on  environmental \nproblems  arising  from  construction  works  than  on  social  concerns.  Among  the  environmental  problems \narising  from  construction  activities  are  dust,  noise,  improper  cutting  of  earth  that  caused  damage  to \nhouses,  blocked  access,  and  water  logging.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  the  findings  of  the \nenvironmental impact assessment study. If these environmental impacts are not mitigated, they could lead \nto  serious  health  problems  and  high  social  costs.  Therefore,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nenvironmental management plan prepared to address these concerns will be implemented and monitored.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  Country  Gender  Assessment  Study,  20042  shows  that  women  in  Sri  Lanka  have  relatively  better \nstatus than women in many other developing countries, but have yet to achieve gender equality. A major \narea  of  inequality,  disadvantage,  and  gender  discrimination  is  employment.  The  unemployment  rate  of \nwomen  has  been  double  than  that  of  men  for  more  than  three  decades,  and  the  quality  of  employment \navailable to women has been deteriorating as demand for female labor is mainly for casual and low-paid, \nlow-skill  jobs  in  the  formal  and  informal  sectors.  This  problem  needs  to  be  addressed  from  a  gender \nperspective  and  incorporated  into  national  development  strategies.  However,  for  direct  employment \nopportunities related to the construction and operation of the highway, the Project will provide employment \nopportunities for both women and men. The Project will ensure that employment opportunities and rates of \nremuneration  are  determined  without  gender-biased  discrimination  and  equal  remuneration  for  work  of \nequal value.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n  \nItem \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n Significant \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResettlement \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \nPlan Required \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n \n(2002  RIP  and \napproved \naddendum \n2006  will  be \napplied.) \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nUnder the original loan for the Project, significant \nland acquisition was required and affected a \nsignificant number of people for preparing the right-\nof-way to accommodate a six-lane highway. The \nresettlement and compensation for land acquisition \nis complete. No more land will need to be acquired \nHowever, a number of small land lots outside the \nright-of-way may be acquired for various reasons \nassociated with construction works, as well as that \nthe remaining land is no longer economically \nbenefiting the owner. The process of acquiring land \nhas been carried out by adopting the approach \nrequired in the resettlement plan and its entitlement \nmatrix, 2002. No new resettlement plan is required.  \n \nConsidering the number of affected people, the \nRoad Development Authority (RDA) has developed \n32 resettlement sites; 31 were handed over to the \nlocal authorities. In addition, an income restoration \nprogram (IRP) has been implemented since October \n2006. Some people used the compensation funds to \nmove to better locations, build better houses, \neducate their children, and invest in economic \nactivities. Many women among those affected by \nthe highway project work as casual laborers in the \nplantations and on construction sites, in home-\nbased economic activities, and small trade to \nsupplement the family income.2 Land acquisition \nand resettlement has created and exacerbated \nexisting economic and social deprivation and \nvulnerability of both men and women. To address \nthis matter, women and vulnerable groups are given \npriority in the IRP.  \n \nProgress with the IRP has yet to be monitored and \nthe independent external monitoring team is \ntargeting IRP recipients with its monitoring program. \nThe findings of the external monitoring team will be \nused as inputs to improve this year\u2019s IRP. The \nProject will ensure that this IRP will be implemented \nin a manner that assists those who are most in need \nfor income generating activities. \n   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n55 \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan Required \n\n \n  \nItem \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \n\n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\nThe highway was designed for limited access, and \ntherefore is prepared to serve long distance and \nfast-moving vehicles. An in-depth study to \nimplement the express highway as a toll road will be \ncarried out to identify which segment of the highway \nshould be tolled on a commercial basis and which \ncould be tolled to help improve traffic distribution. \nThe update study on tolling will be carried out as \npart of the Project.  \nDuring project implementation, civil works \ncontractors will increase the employment of local \npeople who meet the job requirements. RDA will \nensure that civil works contractors comply with all \napplicable labor regulations, including prohibiting \nchild labor for construction and maintenance, and \nensuring equal pay for men and women for work of \nequal value. \nThe proposed widening of the highway will not \ntrigger ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy \nsafeguards.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nThe Project may directly and indirectly cause spread \nof diseases and human trafficking due to opening \nareas for construction and operating a new highway. \nThe most serious are HIV/AIDS and other sexually \ntransmitted diseases. To avoid their spread, the \nProject will ensure that adequate information is \ndisseminated to construction workers as part of the \nhealth and safety program.   \n \nRoad safety is the most significant risk related to \noperation of the first express highway. With an \nadequate awareness campaign on how to use the \nhighway, some vehicle accidents are expected to be \navoided. The awareness campaign will include \nactivities to develop safer intersections, and safer \nuse of express highway services, such as plaza and \nrest stops, bus stops, and other provisions of road \nsafety, such as widening of carriageway that will \nimprove road safety. The Project will include the \ndevelopment and implementation of awareness \ncampaign programs. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus, IRP = income restoration \nprogram, RDA = Road Development Authority. \n \n\u00b9 World Bank. 2006.
