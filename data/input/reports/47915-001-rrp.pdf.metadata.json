After the war, it managed a modest economic turnaround with a gross domestic product \n(GDP)  compound  annual  growth  rate  (CAGR)  of  8.0%  (2000\u20132013).  In  2013,  real  GDP  per \ncapita  reached  its  1990  pre-independence  level  at  gross  national  income  per  capita  of  $990, \nalthough  real  household  expenditure  barely  exceeded  half  the  1990  level. 3 The  2008\u20132009 \nglobal  financial  crisis  and  its  aftermath  affected  demand  for  aluminum  and  cotton,  Tajikistan\u2019s \nlargest  export  commodities,  although  these  declines  were  partly  offset  by  the  inflow  of \nremittances,  which  now  represent  52%  of  GDP.  The  GDP  CAGR  from  2009  to  2013  mildly \ndeclined  to  7.2%  (footnote  3).  The  decelerating  growth  of  the  Russian  Federation\u2019s  economy \nand  the  crisis  in  Ukraine  are  expected  to  lead  to  zero  GDP  growth  in  2014,  and  are  likely  to \nlower  remittance  inflows  to  Tajikistan  through  a  direct  reduction  of  transfers  and  indirectly \nthrough the devaluation of the ruble. \n \n3. \nBanks dominate the country\u2019s finance sector. The largest four represent 60% of banking \nsystem assets totaling TJS9 billion ($1.8 billion) as of mid-2014. Tajikistan\u2019s finance sector has \nbeen  exposed  to  several  banking  crises  since  its  independence,  which  has  severely \nundermined public confidence. The largest banks are known to house the bulk of nonperforming \nloans (NPLs) as a result of lending to state-owned enterprises and government-directed credit \nprograms,  including  to  the  cotton  sector.  As  these  banks  are  constrained  by  solvency  and \nliquidity problems, they lack the focus to serve the private sector. Serving entrepreneurs is left to \nsmaller  banks  and  the  top  five  microfinance  institutions,  which  appear  to  have  the  strength, \ninvestor support, and know-how to grow to a sustainable scale. \n \nOnly  16%  of  households  have  access  to  formal  financial  services. 4  Although \n4. \nmicrofinance  institutions  are  serving  half  a  million  households  and  businesses,  their  lending \nrepresents  just  4.6%  of  GDP  (2013).  Limited  central  bank  capacity  in  bank  oversight; \ngovernance  issues;  a  dearth  of  qualified  staff;  and  a  small,  volatile  market  underscore  the \nchallenge  of  improving  financial  intermediation.  Against  the  backdrop  of  limited  access  to \nfinance,  however,  is  rising  demand  for  business  loans.  This  is  partly  due  to  the  flow  of \nremittances  from  abroad,  which  stimulate  private  demand,  especially  in  the  service  and  trade \nsectors.  Private  credit  to  GDP  has  improved  from  13%  (2012)  to  18%  in  mid-2014,  but  is  not \nsufficient to meet the needs of the economy. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB developing member countries in transition are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \n\nMongolia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. \n\n3  World Bank. Data: Tajikistan. http://data.worldbank.org/country/tajikistan (accessed 26 August 2014). \n4  IMF  Access \n\nto  Finance  database.  http://data.imf.org/?sk=E5DCAB7E-A5CA-4892-A6EA-598B5463A34C \n\n(accessed 26 August 2014). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nProviding  47%  of  total  employment,  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n5. \n(MSMEs)  are  a  significant  contributor  to  income  in  Tajikistan.  Lack  of  access  to  finance  by \nMSMEs  has  been  identified  as  the  major  obstacle  to  doing  business. 5 Moreover,  the  vast \nmajority  (73%)  of  people  live  in  rural  districts.  The  poverty  headcount  index6 fell  dramatically \nfrom a high of 84% (1999) to 28% (2009), which can be largely attributed to a fivefold increase \nin worker remittances (footnote 3). However, the rural poor represent 77% of total poor, or 50% \nof  the  rural  population,  indicating  a  high  poverty  incidence  among  the  unemployed  and  those \nseasonally employed in agriculture. \n \nAgriculture  employs  64%  of  the  labor  force  in  Tajikistan.7 Although  agricultural  value \n6. \naddition  grew  at  a  CAGR  of  8.1%%  (2005\u20132013)  or  1.2%  above  gross  value  added,  the  low \nlabor  productivity  is  improving  only  modestly,  at  a  CAGR  of  6.2%  (2005\u20132013). 8  Low  quality \nstandards,  inadequate  infrastructure,  lack  of  access  to  finance,  strong  market  power  of \npurchasers,  and  government  interference  are  major  factors  impeding  agricultural  productivity.9 \nHigh levels of food imports and the urban demand for food and beverages point to opportunities \nfor  MSMEs.  Future  progress  in  poverty  reduction  cannot  be  sustained  unless  additional \nchannels for income generation are encouraged through inclusive growth strategies focused on \nprivate enterpreneurship and rural areas. \n \n7. \nIntervention  in the  finance  sector  requires  a  careful  choice  of  partners  with  the  highest \npossible  governance  and  integrity  standards.  In  light  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  challenging  operating \nenvironment,  ADB  sought  to  identify  a  partner  financial  institution  with  strong  corporate \ngovernance standards and able to effectively and commercially reach the unbanked segments. \nThrough  its  association  with  AccessBank  Azerbaijan  (ABA),  ADB  was  introduced  to  ABT.  10  \nABT  was  established  in  2010  as  a  greenfield  bank  to  serve  low-income  customers.  ABT\u2019s \nmajority  shareholder,  Access Microfinance  Holding  Aktiengesellschaft  (AMH),  has successfully \ntested this  business model  in  eight  low  and  lower middle-income  economies  in  the  Caucasus, \nCentral Asia, and Africa. ABT\u2019s and AMH\u2019s international financial institution (IFI) investors share \na  long-term  vision  of  building  strong  profitable  banks,  and  exercise  significant  influence  in \npromoting internal and external governance best practices. High-quality selection and training of \nstaff  and  management,  strong  integrity  and  customer  responsibility  rules,  zero  tolerance  for \nabuse,  and  extensive  experience  and  resources  to  handle  crises  that  may  affect  a  bank  in  its \nstart-up phase are essential elements of their successful greenfield banking model. \n \n8. \nIn its short history, ABT has been able to set high governance and integrity standards in \nTajikistan\u2019s  banking  industry,  driven  by  the  quality  and  principles  of  its  shareholders,  strong \nboard oversight, and robust asset quality and client responsiveness. An independent evaluation \ncarried  out  by  the  Association  of  Microfinance  Organizations  of  Tajikistan  in  2013  rated  ABT \noutstanding  for  fairness  and  responsibility  toward  its  customers.  These  attributes  and  ABT\u2019s \nstrong orientation to MSMEs across the country make ABT an excellent partner for ADB\u2019s first \nprivate sector equity investment in Tajikistan and accompanying loan. The proposed investment \nwill improve financial inclusion in Tajikistan and further develop ADB\u2019s relationship with AMH in \n\n                                                \n5  World Economic Forum. 2014.

Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\npromoting financial inclusion in challenging markets. \n \nB. \n \nAfter 4 years of operation, ABT had assets of $56 million, and a market share of 2.8% of \n9. \nloans  and  1.9%  of  assets  as  of  30  June  2014.  It  has  been  building  a  strong  franchise  in  the \nMSME segment, which represents 98% of total loans.11 Its unique strength lies in its capability \nto analyze undocumented business cash flows and provide loans to MSME customers through \nits  branch  and  loan  officer  network,  hence  filling  the  market  gap  where  traditional  lenders  are \nnot active. Initially focused on Dushanbe, ABT is now diversifying its portfolio by expanding its \nloan book in the regions (currently 25% of total loans), thereby gradually reducing its geographic \nconcentration. Moreover, ABT plans to strengthen services to MSMEs and farmers through an \nadditional  15 regional  branches  and  outlets  by the  end  of  2018,  up from  its  current  six-branch \nnetwork.  ABT  has  overcome  the  period  of  its  start-up  losses  with  19  consistent  months  of \nprofitability  and  a  robustly  growing  loan  book that  increased  by  a  CAGR of  71% (2011\u20132013). \nThe  first  8  months  of  2014  indicate  45%  growth  by  the  end  of  FY2014.  Growth  is  being \nsupported by the opportunities offered by a substantially underserved MSME segment.  \n \nC. \n \nOwnership.  Established  in  2010  as  a  greenfield  MSME  bank,  ABT  is  predominantly \n10. \nowned  by  IFIs\u2014AMH  (74.5%  owned  by  IFIs)  holds  63.4%,  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and Development  and the International  Finance  Corporation  each  hold  13.7%, \nand  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  holds  9.1%  of  ABT\u2019s  share  capital.  The \ndirect and indirect shareholding of IFIs in ABT is 78.7%.  \n \n11.  Management.  ABT\u2019s  board  of  management  (BOM)  is  chaired  by  the  chief  executive \nofficer (CEO) and has four additional members: the directors of finance, business banking, the \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  business,  and  retail  banking  and  operations.  The \nCEO, an experienced German commercial banker with in-depth banking experience in Europe \nand  Central  Asia,  joined  ABT  in  2011.  All  but  one  BOM  member  have  extensive  international \nexperience. They all have strong academic backgrounds and are familiar with greenfield MSME \nbanking  through  exposure  to  ABA,  ProCredit  banks,  or  small  business  credit  programs  in \nEurope and  Central  Asia.  Two of  the five BOM  members are  women,  including the  CEO. The \nBOM sets strategic business targets for approval by the board of directors (BOD). \n \nGovernance. ABT\u2019s governance structure includes a two-tier board comprising the BOD \n12. \nand the BOM. The BOD is responsible for issuing and supervising ABT\u2019s policies and strategic \nobjectives, and supervising the BOM. AMH nominates three BOD members, and the European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  and  KfW  each  nominate  one  member.12 All  BOD \nmembers  have  extensive  international  banking  experience  and  are  familiar  with  greenfield \nMSME banking through exposure to ABA and ProCredit banks in Eastern Europe. The BOD is \nextensively  involved  in  the  oversight  of  ABT\u2019s  operations  through  BOD  committees,  including \nthe audit committee, and by approving all of ABT\u2019s operating policies and procedures. \n \n13. \nABT\u2019s  audit  department  reports  directly  to  the  audit  committee.  The  external  auditor, \nDeloitte  and  Touche,  has  conducted  audits  since  2010.  Historically,  audit  observations  have \nprimarily related to addressing fraud identified at branches. ABT has an advanced core banking \n\n                                                \n11 The remaining loans are staff loans. \n12 The International Finance Corporation has not exercised its right to nominate a board member. \n\n\f4 \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nsystem  (Temenos  24)  in  place.  Audit  observations  have  not  identified  any  major  accounting, \noperating, or compliance risks. ABT dismisses staff if fraud is substantiated. In the view of the \naudit  department,  ABT  management  handles  audit  issues  in  a  timely  manner.  ABT\u2019s  audit \nfunction works based on risk assessments and is considered to be well established. The finance \nand legal departments manage the reporting of suspicious transactions, which are uncovered by \nscanning  information  by  source  of  wealth,  politically  exposed  persons,  and  watch  lists.  It  has \nwell-established  \u201cknow  your  customer\u201d  policies  to  combat  money  laundering,  and  reports \nfindings to the Financial Inspection Unit of the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT). \n \nD. \n \n14. \nCapital  adequacy.  ABT\u2019s  capital  adequacy,  under  both  Basel  I  guidelines  and  NBT \nprudential  regulations,  well  exceed  minimum  requirements.  However,  capital  adequacy  was \naffected  by  start-up  losses  that  ended  in  January  2013.  To  support  ABT\u2019s  business  growth, \nAMH  injected  $3.5  million  equivalent  in  new  capital  in  June  2013.  As  a  result,  ABT\u2019s  Basel  I \ntier 1  capital  adequacy  ratio  was  maintained  at  or  above  22%  (2010\u20132013).  To  support  future \ngrowth and maintain capital adequacy at above 20%, a further capital increase of $4.7 million is \nneeded  with  AMH  and  ADB  participation  in  early  2015.  The  conservative  base-case  business \nplan takes into account the anticipated short-term impact of a significant drop in remittances due \nto the currently deteriorating regional market environment, especially the anticipated zero GDP \ngrowth and potential recession in the Russian Federation. \n \n15. \nAsset  quality.  ABT\u2019s  gross  loan  portfolio  (GLP)  reached  $51.5  million  by  31  August \n2014. ABT recently revised its business plan for 2014\u20132018, and set a GLP growth target at a \nCAGR  of  30%.  In  September  2012,  a  large  fire  in  a  central  (Korvon)  market  affected  11%  or \n$2.3  million  of  ABT\u2019s  loan  portfolio  (representing  611  accounts).  ABT  established  a  dedicated \nasset recovery unit, which managed to collect 93% of the affected loans by 31 August 2014. As \na result of the effective recovery effort and the rigorous client selection and monitoring process, \nABT\u2019s  NPL  ratio  very  substantially  improved  from  11.3%  at  the  end  of  FY2012  to  3.1%  by \n31 August  2014,  which  is  low  in  the  Tajikistan  business  environment.  The  Tajikistan  banking \nsystem has historically recorded very high NPL ratios ranging from 10% to 25%.13 \n \nABT  has  a  conservative  provisioning  policy,  with  specific  loan  loss  reserves  equal  or \n16. \nexceeding portfolio at risk greater than 30 days since 2013. The granularity of the loan portfolio \nand  the gradual regional  and  sector  diversification  is  expected to support  strong  asset quality. \nSingle and  related-party  exposures  are  minimal and far  below  the  NBT prudential minimum of \n20% and 2% of total capital, respectively. \n \n17. \nEarnings. Since February 2013, ABT has been generating positive monthly net income, \nwhich  led  to  the  first  full-year  profit  in  2013.  Unaudited  figures  for  the  first  8  months  of  2014 \nindicate  a  robust  improvement  in  profitability  with  an  estimated  annualized  return  on  equity  of \n7.2%  and  a  return  on  assets  of  1.3%.  ABT\u2019s  net  interest  margin  has  improved  by  5.2%  since \n2011, exceeding 23.0% in 2012 and 2013. ABT\u2019s net interest margin is strong by international \nstandards, and appropriate given its high cost\u2013income ratio, which reached 85.3% in 2013 due \nto ABT\u2019s personnel-intensive low-transaction volume business model.  \n \n\n                                                \n13 In this report, ABT\u2019s NPLs are defined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as the sum \nof  (i)  not impaired loans  overdue  more  than  90  days,  (ii)  loans  classified  as impaired, and  (iii)  restructured  loans \nwithin 12 months of the reporting date and not included in (i) or (ii). Tajikistan\u2019s banks classify NPLs on delinquency \nin line with NBT. NPLs are reported by NBT semiannually in its statistical bulletin. \n\n\f5 \n\nLiquidity and asset\u2013liability management. During 2014, ABT managed to improve its \n18. \nterm deposit base from 18% at the end of FY2013 to 60% of total deposits by 31 August 2014. \nWhile notably improved from 2.2% (2011) to 4.4% (2013), the share of deposits to total funding \nis  still  low,  reflecting  ABT\u2019s  nascent  stage  and  the  Tajiks\u2019  limited  use  of  banks  for  depositing \nfunds.  Improving  deposits  by  cross-selling  to  MSMEs  and  by  attracting  institutional  customers \nwill  be  important to  provide  more  stable domestic funding.  For the  coming  5\u20137 years  ABT  will \nrely significantly on IFIs for financing its asset growth. ABT has established strong capabilities in \nmobilizing  direct  and  indirect  (through  microfinance  investment  funds)  IFI  funding,  and \ncommercially  oriented  bilateral  and  philanthropic  investor  funding  (including  funding  from  its \nshareholders),  given  its  attractive  commercial  and  development-oriented  business  model. \nAccess  to  other  commercial  funding  remains  limited  given  the  challenging  country  context. \nABT\u2019s domestic wholesale funding is insignificant. \n \n19. \nSensitivity  to  market  risk.  All Tajik banks are exposed to market risk arising from the \ndirect foreign currency exposure of their funding. ABT matches its foreign currency deposits and \nborrowings with foreign currency lending, and manages foreign-currency-induced credit risk by \nrequiring borrowers\u2019 debt service ratio to exceed 130%, to ensure debt service capacity under \nadverse scenarios. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nA. \n \n20. \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  comprises  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  $3  million \nequivalent in somoni (not to exceed a shareholding of 15%),  to be invested partly as an initial \ninvestment and partly through subsequent exercise of preemptive rights.14 The ADB assistance \nalso includes a senior unsecured loan of up to $5 million to be disbursed in two tranches with a \ntenor  of  up  to  5  years  each.  The  assistance  will  be  further  enhanced through  an  expected  B-\nloan  of  up  to  $3  million  to  be  provided  by  participating  bank(s).  The  proceeds  will  be  used  to \nsupport  growth  in  ABT  loans  to  MSMEs  across  Tajikistan.  Finally,  the  package  includes  $0.5 \nmillion  in  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  an  existing  TA  to  support  ABT\u2019s  outreach  to \nunderserved rural areas and improve its staff qualification and risk management abilities.15 \n \nB. \n \n21. \nThe equity investment and the disbursement of loans will be made in tranches to match \nthe  capital  and  borrowing  requirements  of  ABT.  ABT  will  provide  annual  audited  financial \nstatements  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards,  and  quarterly \nfinancial  statements  and  compliance  certificates  for  agreed  covenants.  Reporting  will  include \nupdates  on  (i)  governance,  safeguards,  and  social  protection  compliance;  and  (ii)  ABT\u2019s \nbusiness performance and utilization of the loans. In addition to the right to appoint a member to \nthe  BOD,  ADB  will  field  on-site  reviews  at  least  annually  and  discuss  progress  with  ABT \nmanagement. \n \nC. \n \n22. \n                                                \n14 An upward limit of $3 million is being proposed to permit participation in future rights issues to support the bank\u2019s \n\nADB\u2019s value addition is expected to be the following: \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\ngrowth. \n\n15 ADB. 2013.

Long-term debt, as discussed, is not available in the local \nmarket.  ABT  is  expected  to  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  good  service  delivery \nand high standards of governance and integrity in the Tajikistan banking sector. \nMore broadly, the investment may help increase public confidence in the banking \nsystem,  through  the  support  of  ABT\u2019s  reaching  out  to  underserved  business \nsegments and rural areas. \nThe  equity  and  loan  investments  will  improve  financial  inclusion  specifically  by \ntargeting  MSMEs,  including  farmers.  MSMEs  are  not  well  served  by  the \ntraditional banking system, and ABT has developed specialized lending practices \nto reach these customers. \nADB  is  also  expected  to  mobilize  private  financing  through  a  B  loan  (para.  20) \nThis  cofinancing  arrangement  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  challenging  operating  environment \nis particularly notable. \nThe  ADB  TA  will  add  value  by  augmenting  the  ability  of  the  nascent  ABT  to \nincrease its branch presence and better serve farmers and MSMEs, improve risk \ndiversification, and enhance staff qualifications and risk management. \nFinally,  ADB  will  nominate  a  BOD  member  who  will  contribute  to  corporate \ngovernance and strategic and risk management issues, and other areas. \n\nthe \n\nRisks \n\nlarge,  systemically \n\n \n \nD. \n \n23. \nOperating  environment.  The  global  economic  downturn  hurt  the  Tajikistan  economy, \nas  evidenced  by  the  decline  in  aluminum  and  cotton  exports,  and  remittances,  and  the \nassociated  sharp  decline  in  GDP  growth.  In  banking,  depositor  confidence  has  further \nweakened  as  shown  by  the  sector-wide  loan\u2013deposit  ratio  of  144%  as  of  30  June  2014,  and \nasset  quality  deterioration,  especially  at \nimportant  banks. \nNotwithstanding  the  current  economic  growth,  the  very  small  domestic  economy  has  become \nhighly  dependent  on  worker  remittances,  mainly  from  the  Russian  Federation; 16  is  highly \nconcentrated  in  Dushanbe;  and  remains  susceptible  to  deteriorations  in  the  operating \nenvironment, which could undermine asset quality and capital adequacy. In response, ABT will \ndiversify its portfolio by targeting regional businesses, and to continue benefiting from its highly \ngranular portfolio, which is diversified across multiple sectors.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE. \n \n24. \nImpacts. Financial inclusion is improved for MSMEs. This will be reflected by increased \naccess  to finance for firms.  Also,  ABT is  expected to  have  a  positive demonstration  effect  by \nsupporting banking industry growth, as shown in increasing ratios of private credit to GDP and \ndeposits to GDP. \n \nOutcome.  ABT  is  a  sustainable  bank  with  significant  outreach  to  MSME  clients, \n25. \nincluding farmers. ABT is expected to set an example for other banks in deepening its outreach \nto  business  clients  across  rural  areas,  while  retaining  good  asset  quality  and  funding  private \nactivity with employment and income benefits for the business owners and their staff. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\n                                                \n16 Tajikistan\u2019s exposure to the Russian Federation is amplified by its anticipated deceleration in economic growth and \n\npotential adverse impacts of the current geopolitical tensions involving the Russian Federation. \n\n\f7 \n\n \n26. \nOutput.  ABT\u2019s banking services to business clients are expanded. ABT will ensure that \nadequate investment is made in human resources and branch infrastructure. Providing capital to \nbusinesses, including farmers, will strengthen their role as an important source of employment. \nEmphasizing lending based on business cash flows, expanding into regions, and providing term \nfinance will serve the regions and diversify ABT\u2019s risk and income profile. \n \nF. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \n27. \nUnder the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the \nfinance sector by assisting the development of financial infrastructure, institutions, and products \nand  services;  and  by  promoting  inclusive  growth. 17 Through  its  initiatives,  ADB  will  support \nchanneling  of  savings  into  productive  investments.  Building  inclusive  financial  systems  will  be \nsupported  through  ABT\u2019s  focus  on  funding  entrepreneurs  and  regions  where  the  potential  for \nemployment  and  income  generation  is  high.  This  is  consistent  with  government  efforts  to \npromote growth and employment. Poverty reduction through private sector development will be \nsupported  via  ABT\u2019s  business  across  Tajikistan,  which  is  among  ADB\u2019s  poorest  developing \nmember countries. \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2010\u20132014  highlights  the  importance  of  private \nsector development as a pillar for intervention.18 An ADB country assistance program evaluation \nwas completed in 2014 and emphasized the need for inclusive development interventions. Both \nreports  highlight  the  importance  of  developing  private  and  financial  institutions,  and  state  that \nagriculture and MSMEs have inadequate access to financial services, and that lending support \nvia financial institutions presents the greatest opportunity for ADB\u2019s private sector operations. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n \n29. \nFinance  sector  development  is  a  key  focus  of  ADB  assistance  as  set  out  in  ADB\u2019s \nPrivate  Sector  Development  Strategy,  which  notes  economic  growth,  stimulated  by  private \nsector  investment,  as  a  key  contributing  factor  in  reducing  poverty,  and  emphasizes  the \nimportance  of  generating  jobs,  with  private  sector  employment  being  the  major  source  of \nincome for workers and their families.19 The strategy also stresses ADB\u2019s role in strengthening \nfinance sectors in its developing member countries. It states that SME beneficiaries of financial \nintermediation  are  important  employers  and  providers  of  income  and  thereby  contribute  to \npoverty  reduction.  Supporting  financial  intermediaries  is  important  to  instill  confidence  and \nrestore the finance sector in countries affected by macroeconomic shocks and financial crises. \nADB plays an important role in supporting Tajikistan\u2019s business climate and microfinance sector \nthrough sovereign interventions.20 Bank  Eskhata  benefits from  ADB\u2019s  Trade  Finance  Program. \nThe proposed intervention would be ADB\u2019s first private sector investment in Tajikistan. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2014.

ABT\u2019s  business \nactivities are unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.
