The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nCapacity Development of the Health Sector, and if the Board approves the proposed grants, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \nThe  sector  development  program (SDP)  will  support  government  efforts to improve the \n2. \nequity, efficiency, and sustainability of Bhutan\u2019s health system, and to promote good health and \nwell-being  of  its  citizens  towards  achieving  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  The  SDP \ncomprises  (i)  a  project  financed  by  a  project  grant,  under  which  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) will invest in primary health care (PHC) improvements; and (ii) a program financed by a \npolicy-based grant, under which ADB will support governance and institutional improvements in \nhealth financing and health information management. The SDP will also advance Bhutan\u2019s health \nsecurity agenda through strategic support for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in \nline with Bhutan\u2019s commitment to the International Health Regulations (2005).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nBhutan has made great strides in economic development. Its per capita gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) increased nearly fourfold from $774 in 2000 to $2,900 in 2017.2 The government \nrecognizes health as a critical domain of Bhutan\u2019s core development philosophy: gross national \nhappiness.  Health  services  are  constitutionally  guaranteed,  and  the  government  provides  a \ncomprehensive range of free health services to all citizens. Since the early 1990s, the country \nhas  made  significant  investments  to  develop  its  health  system  from  a  low  base  and  achieved \nremarkable progress in health outcomes. Average health indicators vastly improved from being \namong  the  poorest  in  the  world  to  mostly  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals. 3 Life \nexpectancy at birth improved from 43.0 years in 1985 to 70.2 years in 2017.4 Child immunization \ncoverage  has  been  sustained  at  more  than  95%  since  2010. 5  Household  out-of-pocket \nexpenditure is relatively low, implying a fair level of equity and financial protection (footnote 5). \nHealth facility coverage is also extensive\u201495% of the population live within a 3-hour walk from a \nhealth facility, which is a considerable feat given Bhutan\u2019s difficult terrain.6 \n \n4. \nDevelopment problem. Despite these impressive gains, Bhutan still faces considerable \nchallenges to further improve the equity, efficiency, and financial sustainability of the health care \nsystem. Sustaining the delivery of free health services is a key challenge as health care costs \ncontinue to rise from a heavier burden of noncommunicable diseases, growing expectations of \nthe population, and medical-technological advancements. At the same time, in view of Bhutan\u2019s \neconomic progress, donors have increasingly withdrawn from the country, reducing the amount \n\n                                                \n1  World Health Organization (WHO). 2005.

Thimphu. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fof  external  grants  that  traditionally  played  a  significant  role  in  the  health  system.7 These  cost \npressures make it imperative to review the efficiency of current health service delivery. The health \nsystem  also  needs  to  overcome  the  persistent  regional  disparities  in  health  outcomes.8 Rapid \nurbanization  has  led  to  new  gaps  in  service  coverage,  leaving  a  growing  urban  migrant  base \nunderserved.  Moreover,  the  risks  of  infectious  diseases  and  to  health  security  have  increased \nbecause of growing cross-border travel and economic activities. \n \n5. \nBinding  constraints.  To  address  the  challenges,  the  government  aims  to  strengthen \nPHC as the core of its health system. Inadequate PHC services, insufficient health financing, and \nfragmented  health  information  management  are  among  the  key  constraints.  The  government \nneeds to improve its PHC facilities, especially in peripheral areas, to bridge regional disparities in \naccess to health care. It needs to explore alternative funding mechanisms to finance critical PHC \nservices,  and  it  needs  to  strengthen  the  health  information  system  (HIS)  to  facilitate  patient \nreferrals and coordinate the continuum of care between PHC and higher-level hospitals. There is \nalso potential for improving the overall efficiency of health sector management and the disease \nsurveillance system by streamlining fragmented health information management. \n \n6. \nInadequate  primary  health  care.  The  disproportionate  focus  on  hospital  care  and \nunderinvestment  in  PHC  are  a key  source  of  cost  inefficiency  in Bhutan. In 2016,  only  10%  of \ncurrent health expenditure (CHE) was at PHC facilities, compared with 63% of CHE at secondary \nand tertiary hospitals. Spending on preventive services is also low at 7% of CHE, compared with \n74% of CHE for curative care.9 Limited PHC services and the lack of a formal referral mechanism \nare  prompting  the  population,  especially  in  urban  centers,  to  bypass  PHC  and  overuse  costly \nhospital  care,  which  reduces  the  overall  cost-effectiveness  of  the  health  delivery  system. \nFurthermore, underfunded PHC facilities disproportionately affect the health access of those in \nrural  areas  and  lower  income  groups,  given  the  stark  disparities  observed  in  physical  health \naccess.  For  example,  the  average  time  to  reach  the  nearest  health  facility  ranges  from  120 \nminutes for the poorest groups to 15 minutes for the richest groups, and from 75 minutes in rural \nareas to 18 minutes in urban areas (footnote 5). Proximity is the most common reason for visiting \na health facility,  and the  utilization of  PHC facilities  is  concentrated  among rural  residents  and \nlower-income  groups.  However,  many  PHC  facilities  lack  adequate  facilities  such  as  toilets, \nrunning water, and basic health equipment. Women of childbearing age and young children may \nbe the most affected by the disparities in  health access; in fact, sharp inequities are observed \nespecially in the indicators of institutional delivery and child mortality.10 \n \n7. \nInsufficient  health  financing.  The  government  is  the  predominant  source  of  health \nfinancing in Bhutan, but the health sector has received a proportionally lower share of general \ngovernment  expenditure  over  recent  years.  During  2010\u20132014,  general  government  health \nexpenditure  dropped  from  5%  to  3%  of  GDP,  and  from  11%  to  8%  of  general  government \nexpenditure.11 This decline has been driven by a shift in the government\u2019s investment priority to \nrevenue-generating infrastructure projects. The outlook for Bhutan\u2019s economy is generally sound, \nbut there are downside risks to macroeconomic stability from the high public-sector debt (109% \n\n                                                \n7  Footnote 5. The share of external resources as a percentage of total health expenditure dropped from 28% in 1996 \n\nto 6% in 2015. \n\n8  For example, the child mortality rate is 81 per 1,000 live births in rural areas and 41  per 1,000 live births in urban \nareas, and deliveries by skilled birth attendants are at 90% in urban areas and 54% in rural areas.

Global Health Expenditure Database. http://apps.who.int/nha/database (accessed 25 June 2018). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nof GDP).12 Given the macroeconomic risk, sector budgetary allocations and financing for essential \nPHC services may fluctuate. In this context, the need to strengthen the Bhutan Health Trust Fund \n(BHTF)\u2014the sole financing facility with the mandate to sustain PHC services primarily through \npredictable financing of vaccines and essential drugs\u2014is increasingly critical. In 2014, the BHTF \ncontributed 5.14% to total health expenditure, and this share is expected to increase further as \ndonors  reduce  support  for  vaccine  procurement  in  the  country. 13  However,  the  BHTF\u2019s \nsustainability is at risk because of insufficient capital to meet rising demand, a weak investment \nstrategy, and limited operational capacity (footnote 13). Moreover, the equity of health financing \nin Bhutan needs to be given more policy emphasis, because the distribution of benefits from public \nhealth financing is only marginally pro-poor and skewed to the wealthier groups.14 \n \n8. \nFragmented  health  information  management.  The  management  and  governance  of \nhealth information in Bhutan is highly fragmented.15 A range of information systems, managed by \ndifferent departments of the Ministry of Health (MOH), were independently developed over the \nyears with wide variations in technology and data standards. The lack of a common interface and \ninteroperability  among the different  systems  prevent  data  sharing  and  optimal  data  analysis  to \nguide  key  sector  decisions,  including  analysis  of  gender  differentials  in  health  trends.  Myriad \nisolated  systems  also  create a  large  and  often  redundant  reporting  burden  on  health facilities, \nthereby reducing the quality and regularity of reporting to the critical national disease surveillance \nsystem. The lack of a good patient information system further makes it difficult to track and refer \npatients  and  coordinate  the  continuum  of  care  between  PHC  and  higher-level  hospitals.  To \nimprove overall  sector  efficiency  and  reduce  duplications  in service delivery, the government\u2019s \nvision is to have digital, longitudinal patient information that can be accessed across all health \nfacilities and to shift to a streamlined, interoperable national HIS. \n \n9. \nGovernment\u2019s sector strategy and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy. The National \nHealth  Policy  (NHP)  promotes  achieving  self-reliance  and  sustainability  through  efficiency  in \nhealth service delivery and the realization of universal health coverage on the principles of PHC.16 \nThe draft 12th 5-year plan for 2018\u20132023 supports the medium-term implementation of the NHP \nthrough appropriate program and budgetary commitments.17  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2014\u20132018  for  Bhutan  aligns  with  government  priorities  to  achieve  self-reliance  and  inclusive \nsocial development, including improved health outcomes.18 \n \n10. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance  and  lessons  learned.  During  2000\u20132002,  ADB \nprovided a policy-based loan for the Bhutan Health Care Reform Program to support health sector \nreforms in key priority areas, including sustainable health financing and strengthened PHC.19 The \nreform program helped establish the BHTF through the Royal Charter in 2000. The proposed SDP \nbuilds  on  the  added  value  and  experience  of  previous  ADB  support  to  the  sector.  It  will \nreinvigorate and deepen health reforms in support of PHC to meet the sector\u2019s evolving needs \namid Bhutan\u2019s changing economic, demographic, and epidemiological contexts. The SDP design \nincorporates key lessons from the reform program, as well as findings from detailed technical due \ndiligence.20 Strong government ownership, deepening of ongoing government reform initiatives, \n                                                \n12 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 BHTF.

Manila. \n\nThimphu. \n\n \n\n\fand implementation of practical and achievable reforms were among the key factors behind the \nreform program\u2019s successful rating.21 \n \n11. \nDevelopment  coordination.  As  Bhutan  makes  good  socioeconomic  progress,  overall \nexternal assistance to the country has declined drastically (footnote 7). Apart from United Nations \nagencies,  major  health  sector  donors  are  the  Government  of  India;  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency; the Japan Children\u2019s Vaccine Initiative; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.22 The sector is facing new challenges that \nwill  require  incremental  reforms.  Future  sector  development  will  thus  require  Bhutan  to \nstrategically harness more external resources to help make the necessary adjustments. ADB\u2019s \nrenewed health assistance is therefore timely, and ADB\u2019s partnership with the government in this \nsector  is  expected  to  continue  well  beyond  the  program  period.  ADB  has  coordinated  the \nassessment  and  design  of  this  SDP  with  relevant  development  partners,  including  the \nInternational Monetary Fund. \n \n12. \nThe  SDP  is  the  most  appropriate  modality  since  the  sector  requires  both  project \ninvestment and policy reforms to form an integrated response to the need for greater sustainability \nof  health  service  delivery  in Bhutan. The  project  grant  will  support removing  PHC  supply-  and \ndemand-side  barriers,  especially  in  underserved  areas.  The  policy  reforms  will  reinforce  the \nproject investment and strengthen the PHC system by supporting (i) sustainable financing of key \nPHC commodities through the BHTF and (ii) a more efficient HIS to underpin the management of \nPHC delivery and its coordination with higher-level hospital care. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe SDP is aligned with the following impacts: national health goals achieved, and self-\nreliance and sustainability in Bhutan\u2019s health service delivery achieved (footnote 16). The SDP \nwill have the following outcome:  equitable access, efficiency, and financial sustainability of the \nhealth system improved.23 \n \nC. \n \nThe SDP will have three outputs. The project grant will support output 1 for PHC service \n14. \ndelivery improvements in selected areas. The policy-based grant will support outputs 2 and 3 for \nenhanced health financing and health information management. 24 In line with ADB\u2019s backing for \nthe regional health security agenda, the SDP also integrates assistance for strengthening disease \nsurveillance,  financing  vaccines  through  the  BHTF,  and  improving  provisions  for  infection \nprevention and control at primary health facilities.25 \n \n15. \nOutput 1: Primary health services, especially in underserved areas, improved. This \nproject-based  output  will  support  improvements  in  PHC  service  delivery,  especially  in \nunderserved  areas. 26 The  emphasis  on  PHC  will  help  bridge  regional  health  disparities  and \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n21 ADB. 2006.

Joint  External  Evaluation  of  International  Health \nRegulations (2005) for the Kingdom of Bhutan, December 2017.

Investments  involve \n(i) constructing five PHC satellite clinics in urban peripheries; (ii) upgrading existing PHC facilities \nwith  better  infrastructure  for  infection  control  and  waste  management;  (iii)  providing  medical \nequipment  for  enhanced  PHC  service  delivery,  including  immunization  and  transportation  of \nlaboratory samples; (iv) providing capacity development to roll out the Bhutan Health Standards \nand  Quality  Assurance  mechanism  at  PHC  facilities;  and  (v)  supporting  PHC  advocacy  and \nbehavioral change communication through civil society organizations. \n \nOutput 2: Support for health sector financing enhanced. This policy-based output will \n16. \nhelp  achieve  equitable  health  financing  and  a  sustainable  BHTF,  whose  core  mandate  is  to \nsupport PHC primarily by financing vaccines and essential medicines. The policy actions include \nmeasures  to  (i)  bolster  BHTF\u2019s  operations  by  strengthening  its  capital  base,  capacity,  and \ngovernance; (ii) make the distribution of public health financing benefits more equitable through \na benefit-incidence analysis; and (iii) institute the legal basis through a  health bill for governing \nhealth financing equity, efficiency, and sustainability.27 ADB\u2019s budget support under this output \nwill help the BHTF in mobilizing capital and diversifying its investments offshore.28 \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  Disease  surveillance  and  HIS  enhanced.  This  policy-based  output  will \nimprove  the  management  and  governance  of  Bhutan\u2019s  HIS  to  support  PHC  and  patient \nmanagement, disease surveillance for increased health security, and overall sector management \nefficiency.  The  output  will  facilitate  Bhutan\u2019s  incremental  move  from  the  currently  fragmented \nindividual systems to an interoperable national HIS. Policy actions include (i) development and \nadoption of a national e-health strategy, (ii) creation of an HIS governing body, (iii) development \nand  adoption  of  an  HIS  enterprise  architecture  for  interoperability,  and  (iv)  development  and \nadoption  of  technical  standards  for  health  data  exchange.  The  implementation  of  the  e-health \nstrategy  and  interoperable  HIS  is  reflected  in  the  draft  12th  5-year  plan  (footnote  17).  ADB\u2019s \nbudget support under this output is expected to contribute to government spending on strategy \nand governance; information technology infrastructure, services, and applications; data standards \nfor interoperability; and workforce capacity development. \n \nD. \n \nThe SDP is estimated to cost $41.22 million (summary of cost estimates in Table 1 and \n18. \nsummary of financing plan in Table 2).

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $6 million from \n19. \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. ADB will \nfinance the expenditures for civil works, goods, consulting services, and capacity development. \n \nProgram  financing.  The government  has  requested  a grant not  exceeding  $14  million \n20. \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help finance  the  program. \nProgram support will be in two tranches of $7 million each to be released in 2018 and 2020. The \nsize  of  the  policy-based  grant  was  estimated  based  on  a  combination  of  (i)  the  BHTF\u2019s \nassessment of its financing sustainability and (ii) government-projected financing requirements \nfor developing the electronic patient information system and interoperable HIS during the 12th 5-\nyear plan. As regards the BHTF\u2019s sustainability (output 2), the financing need for augmenting the \ncapital base was estimated to be $20 million to avert an expected BHTF revenue deficit from 2021 \ndue to the (i) projected rise in expenditures for vaccines and essential drugs, (ii) increased cost \nto the BHTF to cover its own operations under its autonomous status,30 and (iii) expected decline \nin revenue from a fall in the inflation-adjusted return of the BHTF\u2019s domestic investment portfolio \n(footnote 13). To cover the estimated financing gap, the government requested a grant of $10 \nmillion from ADB, and the government will provide Nu500 million to the BHTF. The BHTF is also \nexpected  to  mobilize  additional  funds  to  bridge  the  remaining  funding  gap  and  to  optimize  its \nrevenue  through  diversified  investing.31 For  the  HIS  program  under  output  3,  the  government \n\n                                                \n30 With its new autonomous status, the BHTF will have to cover its own operational costs from earned revenue. In the \n\npast, the general government budget covered the BHTF\u2019s overhead costs. \n\n31 The  BHTF  will  mobilize  funds  in  annual  fundraising  events  such  as  lotteries  and  health  walks;  and  from  private \n\nindividuals, companies, and foundations. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nestimated an overall requirement of $17 million over the medium term.32 Of this, ADB will provide \na grant of $4 million to help finance the program, and the government is expected to fund the rest \nunder the 12th 5-year plan budget for flagship programs.33 \n \nE. \n \n21. \n(footnote 29). \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in the PAM \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated closing date  \nProject management \n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementing units \n(iv)  Management and \ncoordination \n\nProcurementa \n \n\n \nConsulting servicesa \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nSeptember 2018\u2013August 2023 \n31 August 2023 \n28 February 2024 \n\n1 contract through WHO (vehicles) \n2 contracts through UNICEF (goods) \n\nThe project steering committee chaired by MOH\u2019s secretary will be the oversight body. \nDistrict management committees will monitor activities in the eight focus districts. \nMOH \nBHTF; DMSHI, DPH, PPD, ICT Division, and QASD of MOH \nThe project management and policy support unit will be established in MOH to \ncoordinate and manage the overall sector development program. \nProcurement from \nspecialized agencies \n(international advertising) \nOpen competitive bidding \n(national advertising) \nRequest for quotations  \nConsultants\u2019 qualification \nselection \nIndividual consultant \nselection \nRetroactive financing will cover up to 20% of the ADB project grant for eligible \nexpenditures incurred prior to grant effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months prior \nto the signing of the project grant agreement. \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nbetween the Government of Bhutan and ADB. \n\n8 contracts (works) \n12 contracts (goods) \n3 contracts (equipment and furniture) \n2 contracts \n\n14 person-months (international) \n232 person-months (national) \n\n$1,822,260 \n$1,907,090 \n$84,830 \n$225,720 \n\n$204,260 \n$158,270 \n\n$322,030 \n$293,540 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BHTF  =  Bhutan  Health Trust  Fund,  DMSHI  =  Department  of  Medical  Supplies  and \nHealth Infrastructure, DPH = Department of Public Health, ICT = information communication technology, MOH = Ministry \nof  Health,  PPD  =  Policy  and  Planning  Division,  QASD  =  Quality  Assurance  and  Standardization  Division,  UNICEF  = \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, WHO = World Health Organization. \na  Procurement (including consulting services) will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \n\ntime) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n22. \nThe  proposed TA  for  Capacity  Development  of  the  Health  Sector  will  support  program \nimplementation. It will have two outputs to support the government in (i) bolstering health sector \nfinancing  and  the  BHTF\u2019s  institutional  development,  and  (ii)  strengthening  the  HIS  and  digital \nhealth governance. The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide \n\n                                                \n32 A  breakdown  of  the  estimated  program  cost  by  component  is  in  the  Assessment  of  Health  Information  Systems \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The WHO will also provide technical support to the MOH \nfor implementing the e-health strategy and digital HIS. \n\n33 The government introduced flagship programs as an innovation with a tentative allocation of Nu15 billion under the \n\n12th 5-year plan. Funding under flagship programs is in addition to the line agency\u2019s allocated plan budget. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fcounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, workshop venues, and other in-\nkind contributions. The MOH will be the executing agency for the TA, which will be implemented \nover 2 years during the SDP implementation.34 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nOverall, the project (output 1) is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal \n23. \nrate of return of 16%. The major economic benefits of the project accrue to project beneficiaries \nin the form of (i) their improved productivity (estimated using disability-adjusted life years saved) \nand (ii) out-of-pocket health cost savings from better PHC services. The economic costs are (i) the \ncost  of  the  project  investment  during  the  5-year  implementation  period  and  (ii)  operation  and \nmaintenance costs. Budget adequacy and financial sustainability of the project investments were \nconfirmed based on (i) the country\u2019s medium-term budgetary framework and budget allocation; \nand  (ii)  government  financial  capacity  and  commitment  to  sustain  project  infrastructure, \nequipment, and maintenance of capital investments.35 \n \nB. \n \nThe financial management risk is moderate mainly because the MOH has well-established \n24. \nsystems  for  financial  management, \nincluding  computerized  budgeting  and  expenditure \nmanagement  systems,  but  its  (i)  accounting  staff  has  limited  experience  and  capacity  to \nimplement ADB projects and (ii) internal auditing is inadequate. To mitigate these risks, the MOH \nagreed to an action plan to strengthen its financial management capacity, including (i) assigning \ndedicated accountants in the project management and policy support unit who will be trained on \nADB procedures and (ii) increasing the scope and quality of the MOH\u2019s internal audits. The MOH \nwill also engage a financial management expert to provide capacity building support to the project \naccounting staff. With the proposed risk mitigating measures, the MOH\u2019s financial management \ncapacity  for  the  project  is  expected  to  be  satisfactory.  ADB\u2019s  procurement  capacity  and  risk \nassessments  further  showed  that  the  MOH  can  handle  the  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and \nservices  for  the  project  by  establishing  the  project  management  and  policy  support  unit  and \nthrough  additional  support  from  a  procurement  expert.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nPoverty continues to be a largely rural phenomenon in Bhutan\u2014the poverty rate is 11.9% \nin rural and 0.8% in urban areas.36 While Bhutan has achieved remarkable progress in key health \noutcomes, rural\u2013urban disparities in the health status remain. Differences also show in the use of \nhealth  services  by  wealth  profile,  in  that  richer  people  use  hospitals  more  than  the  poor.37 As \nBhutan experiences rapid urbanization, attention needs to be paid to meeting the health needs of \nthe growing urban migrant population. The SDP will contribute to government efforts to reduce \npoverty and disparities through (i) investments to strengthen PHC services in both rural and urban \nperipheries  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  underserved,  and  (ii) support  for  immunization, \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n34 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau. 2017.

The MOH developed a gender \naction  plan  (GAP)  with  clear  targets,  responsibilities,  and  resource  allocation. 38  It  will  be \nimplemented by the MOH and closely monitored by the MOH\u2019s gender focal person. Data on the \nprogress of the GAP indicators will also be collected and monitored through the Gender Equality \nMonitoring  System  of  the  National  Commission  for  Women  and  Children.  The  ADB  gender \nconsultant  based  at  the  Bhutan  Resident  Mission  will  also  support  GAP  monitoring  and \nimplementation. \n \nD. \n \n27. \ncategories are as follows.39 \n \nEnvironment (category B). An initial environmental examination with an environmental \n28. \nmanagement plan and an environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared.40 \nThe construction or upgrade of facilities is not expected to have significant or irreversible negative \nenvironmental impacts during construction or operation. Construction impacts will be site-specific \nand  typical  of  small-scale  construction  projects  and  mitigated  through  the  environmental \nmanagement plan\u2019s implementation. Medical waste management during the operation of facilities \nwill follow applicable national laws, and relevant provisions are incorporated in the project design. \nIn the absence of appropriate national laws and regulations, international good practices in the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines will be followed.41 Each municipality \nor district will prepare a medical waste management plan, and the MOH will train health staff on \nhealth  care  waste  management  and  infection  prevention  and control  measures.  The  MOH  will \nfurther recruit  an environment  expert  to  assist with  safeguard implementation, monitoring,  and \nreporting  requirements.  For  the  policy-based  grant,  no  significant  environmental  impact  is \nanticipated. \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and indigenous  peoples  (category  C). The project  will  not \ninvolve any land acquisition. New construction will be limited to five small urban clinics on vacant \ngovernment land with no productive use. No physical or economic displacement will occur. No \nindigenous peoples live in the project areas. The policy-based grant is also not anticipated to have \nsocial safeguard impacts. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.42 In  addition,  following  the  national \nelections  during  September\u2013October  2018,  there  may  be  some  risk  of  change  in  government \ncommitment to fully implement the reforms supported by the SDP. However, this risk is low due \nto wide support for the program by a broad range of stakeholders and its close alignment with the \ndraft 12th 5-year plan. The MOH will also proactively advocate with the new government for full \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n                                                \n38 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 ADB.
