THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Hunan  Dongjiang  Lake  Integrated \nEnvironmental Protection and Management Project.1 \n2.  The proposed project will be implemented in the Dongjiang Lake basin in Zixing City, \nChenzhou Municipality, Hunan Province. The project will introduce an integrated approach to \naddress constraints in lake environmental protection and livelihood development.2  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  One  of  the  greatest  challenges  facing  water  management  in  the  PRC  relates  to \nfreshwater lakes, as many of them are severely polluted. Since the mid-1990s, the Government \nof the PRC has made substantial efforts to address the problem, with emphasis on three \nlakes\u2014Chao, Dianchi, and Tai lakes\u2014but the water quality of these lakes has not improved \nsignificantly. The government realized the importance of pollution prevention in lakes by drawing \nlessons from the rehabilitation of polluted lakes, including the Chao, Dianchi, and Tai lakes, \nwhich were rehabilitated at very high cost. Experience has shown that it is very difficult and \nineffective to restore water quality in large lakes once they are polluted. \n4.  Located  in  south  Hunan  Province,  Dongjiang  Lake  is  a  reservoir  formed  after  the \nconstruction of Dongjiang Dam in 1986 on the Leishui River, a tributary of the Xiang River. \nDongjiang Lake is a multipurpose reservoir for hydropower, flood control, water supply, and \nirrigation. It has a surface area of 160 square kilometers (km2) and a total storage capacity of \nabout 8.12 billion cubic meters (m3). The catchment area of the Dongjiang Lake is 4,719 km2. \n5.  The government\u2019s priority is to protect the water resources of Dongjiang Lake from \npollution. Dongjiang Lake has been selected as one of five river basins for nationwide pilot \ntesting  of  the  government\u2019s  eco-compensation  policy  framework,  to  which  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has provided continuous support since 2009. Dongjiang Lake was \nprioritized for support in the National Plan for Relatively Good-Quality Lake Ecological and \nEnvironmental  Protection,  2013\u20132020,  jointly  released  by  the  Ministry  of  Environmental \nProtection, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Development and Reform Commission. \n6.  Dongjiang  Lake  is  a  strategic  water  source  for  supporting  resource-saving  and \nenvironment-friendly social development in Hunan Province. Maintaining healthy environmental \nservices in Dongjiang Lake is vital to achieving sustainable development of the Xiang River \nbasin, one of the major regions of the government\u2019s Yangtze River Economic Belt Initiative. The \nXiang River basin is home to about 40 million people and accounts for over 70% of Hunan \nProvince\u2019s  total  gross  domestic  production.  In  addition  to  supplying  water  to  Chenzhou \nMunicipality and Zixing City, Dongjiang Lake serves as a backup water source for  Hunan \nProvince\u2019s  major  cities  of  Changsha,  Xiangtan,  and  Zhuzhou  in  the  Xiang  River  basin  to \nimprove the water security of 13 million people in these cities. The lake\u2019s large storage capacity \ngreatly improves flood and drought management for the downstream cities and navigation of the \ndownstream Xiang River. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Hunan Dongjiang \nLake Environmental Protection and Integrated Utilization Project (TA 8638-PRC). ", "2 \n7.  Hunan  Provincial  Government  (HPG)  and  local  governments  have  prioritized \nenvironmental protection of Dongjiang Lake. Protection zones have been established in the \nDongjiang Lake basin in accordance with the provincial-approved Dongjiang Lake Basin Water \nEnvironmental  Protection  Regulation  (2002).  The  regulation  imposes  controls  on  the \ndevelopment of the basin and restricts various activities in different protection zones that may \ncause adverse impact on the water environment. Since 2002, HPG and local governments have \ninvested nearly CNY1 billion in protection of the lake, including closure of mines, removal of \ncage fishing, ship renovation and improvement, and job training for nonfarming opportunities. \n \nContinued efforts by HPG, local governments, and local people help maintain the good water \nquality of the lake to meet national standards for drinking water sources. \n8.  However, heavy agricultural activities and growing urbanization in the lake basin have \nposed greater risks of water pollution in the lake. The water quality of Dongjiang Lake has been \ndeteriorating since the 1990s as a result of agricultural nonpoint source pollution, inadequate \nwastewater treatment facilities, lack of solid waste management, and significant soil erosion \naround the lake. The trophic state index for Dongjiang Lake was 25.8 in 1991 and 29.5 in 2010.3 \nAlthough the 2010 trophic state index is acceptable for drinking purposes, the value in 2010 was \nsignificantly higher than in 1991. A review of 15 monitoring stations from 1991 to 2010 has \nshown that Dongjiang Lake is generally in the oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions. However, \namong the 15 locations, water quality in 12 locations was poorer in 2010 than in 1991. Water \nquality fluctuations are random and without a significant seasonal pattern or synchronization, so \nthe pollution challenges are not likely from a single source.  \n9.  Point and nonpoint source pollution. Agriculture is the major source of pollution in the \nlake  catchment,  accounting  for  about  48%  of  the  total  pollutants.  Other  sources  include \ndomestic wastewater (25%), industry (14%), water transportation (9%), and tourism (4%). Every \nyear, the pollutants discharged into the Dongjiang Lake area contain 9,038 tons of chemical \noxygen  demand,  1,741  tons  of  ammonia,  and  363  tons  of  total  phosphorus.  Only  a  few \ntownships have wastewater treatment facilities, and the wastewater from most townships and \nvillages scattered around the lake is directly discharged to the streams that drain to the lake. \n10.  Solid waste collection and treatment facilities for townships and villages have yet to be \nestablished in the basin. As the population increases, garbage production also rises. Only a few \nvillages have household trash collectors or collection bins in designated locations. Furthermore, \npublic collection tanks are often not emptied on time and overflow of rubbish is common. \nConsequently, garbage is discarded on roadsides and open spaces around houses. This not \nonly has an adverse visual impact on the surrounding environment, but also seriously threatens \nthe health of local villagers. Because of the lack of transfer and disposal, rubbish has been \nstacked on unused land. Some villages burn their rubbish, causing significant adverse impacts \nto the surrounding environment and the living conditions of local residents. \n11.  Inadequate  water  supply  facilities.  A large number of residents, particularly rural \ncommunities in Zixing City, do not have access to piped water supply, although they are close to \nthe lake. They use water drawn from various sources without proper treatment. This is not only \na burden for the residents, but also exposes them to health risks and, in turn, affects the lake \nwater quality. The existing water treatment plants in the towns of Zixing City use surrounding \nsmall-scale water reservoirs and mountain springs or rivers as water sources, but these are \nsubject to seasonal changes and weak self-purification capacity during drought. The villages \nbeyond the service area of existing water supply plants are served by small-scale temporary \n                                                \n3  The trophic state index is a measure of how much nutrient, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, is in a lake or other \nbody of water. A lake can be put into one of three possible classes: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, or eutrophic. \n ", "3 \nwater supplies, which have lower safety standards. Most rural residents drink well water or \nstream water of poor sanitary quality, especially during rainy seasons when wells are often \nflooded,  seriously  polluted,  and  of  extremely  turbid  water quality.  Furthermore,  some rural \nvillages are located within high-fluorine and high-arsenic areas. \n12.  Low flood protection level. With the large flood storage capacity of Dongjiang Lake, \nthe downstream of the lake has been protected from major floods. However, the flood protection \nof the upstream and surrounding areas of the lake is low, with capacity only against flood \nrecurrence of about 2 years. The rivers have been frequently impacted by floods over the years, \nresulting in river blockage and bank erosion that reduce flood discharge capacity. Most of the \nrivers do not have bank protection, which results in erosion of neighboring farmland during \nfloods and causes sedimentation in the rivers. Frequent floods have brought extreme impacts \non the lives and production of the riparian villagers. Farmers particularly suffer from loss of \nproperties,  farmlands,  or  even  life.  For  example,  a  severe  flood  in  July  2006  caused \n142 casualties, 2,563 collapsed houses, and 200 hectares (ha) of damaged farmland. \n13.  Soil erosion and ecosystem. Limited livelihood and employment opportunities and lack \nof arable land result in the conversion of slopes for farming by local communities. In the areas \naround  Dongjiang  Lake,  soil  erosion  is  intensifying  and  occurrence  of  natural  disasters  is \nincreasing. Soil erosion in the project area covers 1,087 km2 and average annual soil erosion \nreaches 4 million tons, causing river siltation in some sections of the rivers and even forming \nsand deltas at some river estuaries to Dongjiang Lake. The 55,000 ha of national and provincial \npublic forest around the lake area greatly contribute to water and soil conservation. However, \nfires and pest disasters often occur because of the low quality of the forest, and the eco-\nefficiency of the forest is relatively low. The lake areas are abundant with bamboo resources, \nand can be a major source of income for local residents while protecting the environment. \n14.  Inadequate institutional coordination and capacity.  Dongjiang Lake basin covers \nZixing City and the counties of Guidong, Rucheng, and Yizhang in Chenzhou Municipality. The \nDongjiang  Lake  environmental  protection  bureau  was  established  under  the  Chenzhou \nMunicipal Government in 2003 to coordinate environmental protection in the basin. However, \nthe bureau does not have (i) adequate tools and capacity for coordinating and monitoring \nenvironmental protection activities in the entire basin, or (ii) an ecological and environmental \nmonitoring and management information system. It needs to be empowered with adequate \nhuman and financial resources to assume responsibility for environmental management of the \nentire lake basin. \n15.  Strategic  fit.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  building  a \nharmonious  and  prosperous  society  through  regionally  balanced  and  environmentally \nsustainable  growth.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  Yangtze  River  Economic  Belt \nInitiative to construct an ecological ecosystem corridor along the river by improving watershed \nmanagement, water pollution control and prevention, and ecological rehabilitation.4 It conforms \nto the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,5 and the Water Operational \nPlan, 2011\u20132020 to increase coverage and improve services for water supply and sanitation, \nand promote integrated water resources management (IWRM).6 \n \n                                                \n4  State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2014.

Output  5  will  support  the  (i)  establishment  of  environmental,  fishery,  and  forest \nfirefighting  monitoring  centers;  (ii)  establishment  of  the  Dongjiang  Lake  ecological  and \nenvironmental  protection  research  center;  (iii)  development  of  the  Dongjiang  Lake \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  management  information  system;  (iv)  provision  of  project \nimplementation consulting services, training, workshops, and study tours; and (v) establishment \nof a project monitoring and evaluation system. \n24.  Innovation  and  special  features.  The  project  is  expected  to  scale  up  and/or \ndemonstrate the following good practices in the PRC: (i) IWRM and comprehensive monitoring, \n(ii) environmental protection linked with livelihood improvement, and (iii) eco-compensation. In \naddition,  during  project  preparation,  policy  dialogue  was  conducted  and  recommendations \nprovided for revising the Dongjiang Lake Basin Water Environmental Protection Regulation.7 \n(i)  Integrated water resources management. Under the IWRM framework, the \nproject  attempts  to  coordinate  and  integrate  the  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures in a manner that ensures their consistency and results in synergies \nwhere the total impact is greater than the sum of the individual actions. To meet \nthe water quality targets as requested in the national good water quality lake \nprogram, pollutants discharged into the lake have to be reduced. The project will \ntake a holistic approach to tackling these challenges by preventing different types \nof  pollution  sources,  and  land  degradation  and  soil  erosion,  with  a \ncomprehensive  environmental  monitoring  system  to  support  integrated  lake \nmanagement. \n(ii)  Linking environmental protection with livelihood opportunities. The project \nwill not only maintain environmental and ecological services to the local residents \nand the downstream Changsha\u2013Zhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan city cluster, but also improve \nlocal farmers\u2019 income by directly supporting livelihood opportunities, such as \nbamboo  forest  development,  fish  stocking,  and  technical  and  vocational \neducation and training in alternative livelihood activities for 30,000 rural residents \naround the lake. Without such benefits, the willingness of local farmers to comply \nwith environmental regulations around the lake would not be fully effective. \n(iii)  Eco-compensation. Dongjiang Lake performs crucial watershed functions for \nHunan Province. An eco-compensation pilot scheme will be tested under the \nproject to compensate those responsible for the collection and treatment of solid \nwaste  and  sewage,  and  engagement  of  greener  agricultural  production,  by \nsetting up an eco-compensation fund to be raised from tourist entry fees. HPG \nand  Zixing  City  Government  (ZCG)  also  agreed  to  explore  more  eco-\ncompensation schemes for better protection of Dongjiang Lake during project \nimplementation. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n25.  The project is estimated to cost $262.03 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).8 \n                                                \n7  The regulation is being revised by the local governments and will be submitted to Hunan People\u2019s Congress for \napproval in about 2 years.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n29.  The project was prepared by licensed domestic design institutes taking into account \nconsultant  recommendations  during  project  preparation,  in  accordance  with  relevant  PRC \nguidelines and regulations. The technical feasibility was confirmed to be adequate after detailed \nexamination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions, including current and projected \nclimate variables, availability of water sources, proximity to the residents, and available land for \nproject facilities. Alternative technical options identified the most suitable sites for the facilities, \nand the different forms of river embankments and wetlands to suit the local environment. The \nprocesses selected for the urban and rural water supply, and wastewater and sludge treatment, \nare appropriate for the technical capacity of the local implementing agency. Capacity building to \nensure adequate skills for project implementation and O&M will be financed under the project. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n30.  The economic internal rate of return was estimated by comparing with- and without-\nproject scenarios. The project\u2019s economic costs reflect (i) the capital cost for construction, \n ", "8 \nincluding physical contingencies, land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental monitoring \ncosts; and (ii) annual O&M costs. The economic benefits for the project were derived from the \nwillingness to pay of beneficiaries for water supply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste \ncollection; avoided flood and forest fire damage; water treatment and resource cost savings \nfrom wetland protection; reduced soil erosion; and increased quantity and quality of fruit, forest, \nand fishery products. The overall economic internal rate of return was estimated at 14.5%; and \nthe net present value is CNY156.75 million, indicating the economic viability of the project. \n31.  The financial sustainability assessment for the project indicates that ZCG has sufficient \nfunds to finance the counterpart contributions, debt service, and O&M costs. Average annual \ncounterpart  funding  accounts  for  0.5%\u20132.4%  of  ZCG\u2019s  total  projected  revenue  during \nimplementation. The sum of counterpart funds, debt service, and O&M costs is 1.2%\u20133.2% of \nthe total projected revenues during 2016\u20132040. The financial evaluation indicated that the \nfinancial internal rate of return for Yangdongxia water supply  was 3.14%, higher than the \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.45%; while the financial internal rate of return for Chukou \nwater supply was 5.24%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 1.70%. Sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the Yangdongxia water supply is sensitive to revenue decrease. Financial \nevaluation of the township wastewater treatment plants determined that full O&M cost recovery \nis  not  possible  at reasonable  tariff  assumptions, given  their  small  scale. ZCG  will  provide \nsubsidies needed to partly cover O&M expenses for township wastewater treatment facilities. \nC.  Governance \n32.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  indicated  that  (i)  ZCG  and  ZIFC  have  the \nnecessary technical and human resources to undertake procurement of consulting services, \ngoods, and works; and (ii) monitoring and internal controls regarding procurement are generally \nin place. The financial management assessment indicated that (i) both ZCG and ZIFC have \nadequate and qualified staff for operating and administering the project account, and (ii) its \ninternal control and audit will be strengthened through capacity building and close monitoring \nduring project implementation. The financial management risk has been assessed as moderate \non a pre-mitigation basis mainly because of unfamiliarity with ADB\u2019s financial management \npolicies and procedures. To address these risks, the key mitigating measures include provision \nof training and consulting services. With mitigating measures, these financial management \narrangements are deemed adequate. \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith HPG, ZCG, and the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 8). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n34.  The project will directly benefit 78,325 households, of which 10.8% are low-income \n(CNY10,000/year  and  below).11 The  project  has  good  opportunities  for  socially  inclusive \nbenefits, which will provide farmers around the lake with adequate awareness and incentives to \nprotect the lake environment. The project design focuses on ways to balance environmental and \nsocial objectives, and thereby maintain the ecological quality of the lake, while maintaining good \nincomes for people with livelihoods around the lake. A social development action plan has been \nprepared to ensure actions are taken to consult with and mobilize local communities to shift \n                                                \n11 These include 58,425 households with new or improved sanitation, 42,188 households with new or improved water \nsupply, 10,273 households with reduced flood risks, and 26,650 households with rehabilitated bamboo forest. The \nsum is larger than the total beneficiary households because some households benefit from several activities.      \n ", "9 \naway from detrimental activities and behaviors. This will be supported by livelihood training \nprograms  and  public  awareness  campaigns  for  sanitation  and  environmental  protection.  A \ncommunity consultation and participation plan has been prepared for project implementation to \nengage local communities\u2019 active participation in the implementation of several project outputs. \n35.  Gender.  ADB  has  classified  the  project  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Good \nopportunities  exist for women  to  participate  in  project  design,  implementation,  construction \nemployment, and project activities, particularly in livelihood training, wetland construction and \nmanagement, bamboo upgrading, and public awareness programs. Women will also benefit \nfrom the wastewater treatment, solid waste management, and water supply components, which \nwill greatly improve their living conditions. A gender action plan has been prepared. ZCG and \nZIFC will require social and gender awareness training and support during implementation, and \nthe project implementation consultants for social and gender issues will be provided. \nE.  Safeguards \n36.  Environment  (category  A).  The  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report, \nincluding  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  follows  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). The EIA is consistent with the domestic EIAs. The draft EIA report was \npublicly disclosed on the ADB website on 27 April 2015. The project is expected to achieve \nenvironmental  benefits,  including  improved  long-term  security  of  the  high  water  quality  in \nDongjiang Lake; improved wetland habitats; soil erosion control; and improved institutional and \ncommunity management of water, wetland, and forestry resources. Anticipated construction \nimpacts are from dredging and embankment of the rivers; construction-related air, dust, noise, \nvibration, and erosion impacts; and occupational and community health and safety. Potential \noperational risks include cumulative nutrient loading in Dongjiang Lake and the rivers resulting \nfrom  the  discharge  of  treated  effluent;  inadequate  maintenance  of  the  treatment  plants, \npipelines, and constructed wetlands; and air and noise emissions from the treatment plants. The \nrisk  of  cumulative  and/or  induced  impacts  has  been  assessed.  Mitigation  measures  are \ndescribed in the EMP. These include the timing of dredging, on-site sediment sampling, control \nof sediment dispersion, and maintenance of project facilities. The EIA concludes that effective \nimplementation of the EMP, together with the training, will result in residual impacts within the \nlimits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. The initial climate risk rating during the project \nconcept stage was medium, but the climate risk vulnerability assessment found the risk to be \nlow. Adaptation measures were included in the project design. \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). A total of 189.06 ha of land will be occupied \npermanently, including 12.28 ha of collective land and 176.77 ha of state-owned land. Some \n65.29 ha of land will be occupied temporarily. The project will demolish 1,539.1 square meters \nof housing. Land acquisition and resettlement will affect 573 people, of whom 284 will lose more \nthan 10% of their productive assets and/or be physically displaced. Seven households need to \nbe relocated. Livelihood measures and training, such as bamboo forest and training on tea \nprocessing, tourist services, computer operation, and cooking, will be provided to households \nwith significant land losses. ZCG, with the assistance of consultants, prepared a resettlement \nplan in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the government\u2019s related laws and \nregulations.  ZCG  and  ZIFC  have  good  experience  and  capacity  to  manage  resettlement \nimpacts. The draft resettlement plan was disclosed on the ADB website on 2 July 2015. \n38.  Ethnic minorities (category B). Yao people in four villages will benefit from several \nproject activities, including bamboo forest, wastewater treatment, solid waste management, river \nrehabilitation, wetland development, and livelihood training. A draft ethnic minority development \n ", "10 \nplan has been prepared in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and related laws and \nregulations  of  the  PRC  and  Hunan  Province.  Actions  to  be  taken  include  community \nconsultation  and  mobilization  to  ensure  Yao  people  can  participate  in  project  design, \nconstruction, and benefits in a manner that supports culturally appropriate village development. \nThe draft ethnic minority development plan was disclosed on the ADB website on 2 July 2015. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n39.  The project has potential environmental, institutional, and financial risks. The overall risk \nis assessed as medium. The project provides adequate measures to mitigate these risks, and \nthe  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.12  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe local government fails to  The project will help strengthen and empower the local government and relevant \nadopt an integrated approach to  agencies to carry out environmental monitoring and protection in a coordinated \nthe Dongjiang Lake\u2019s  and holistic manner. \nenvironmental protection. \nInfrastructure assets are poorly  Zixing City Government will ensure adequate staff resources and annual operation \noperated and maintained  and maintenance budget in accordance with loan covenants.
