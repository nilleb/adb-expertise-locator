Its intended impact is to increase trade, including intraregional trade, \nof SASEC countries by reducing or removing non-tariff barriers (NTBs), specifically institutional, \nadministrative, and technical barriers to trade in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. While India is \nnot participating in the program because it is self-financing its trade facilitation reforms, it is part \nof  the  implementation  through  the  SASEC  Trade  Facilitation  and  Transport  Working  Group \n(TFTWG).4 The program\u2019s intended outcome is to support a more efficient, transparent, secure, \nand  service-oriented  processing  of  trade  in  the  subregion.  To  achieve  this,  it  will  support \nactivities  under  three  thematic  areas:  (i)  modern  and  effective  customs  administration  and/or \ntrade  processes  and  procedures;  and \nmanagement;  (ii)  streamlined  and \n(iii) improved services and information for private sector traders and investors, including women \nentrepreneurs. \n \n\ntransparent \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nStrong  commitment  to  fostering  subregional  trade.  A  high-level  forum  in  Manila  in \n3. \n2010 set three SASEC priorities: trade facilitation, transport, and energy. Subsequently, SASEC \nTFTWG meetings were held in Bangkok in October 2011 and Kolkata in March 2012 to discuss \npriority initiatives, as follows: (i) subregional trade facilitation, (ii) cross-border road corridor and \nborder  infrastructure  development,  and  (iii)  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  capacity \nbuilding and institutional strengthening for transport and trade facilitation. The inclusion of trade \nfacilitation  reflects  both  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  SASEC\u2019s \nrecognition of both the problems and opportunities in this area, as discussed below. \n \n4. \nSouth  Asia  one  of  the  world's  least  integrated  regions.  Despite  South  Asia\u2019s \nimpressive  growth  since  the  early  2000s,  it  remains  one  of  the  least  integrated  regions  in  the \nworld.  South  Asia  accounts  for  only  2%  of  world  trade,  and  1.7%  of  world  foreign  direct \ninvestment. 5 Intraregional  trade  is  less  than  6%  of  the  region\u2019s  total  trade.  In  comparison, \nintraregional  trade  as  a  share  of  total  trade  for  Latin  America  is  17%;  Middle  East  and  North \nAfrica,  8%;  and  East  Asia,  55%.  South  Asia\u2019s  intraregional  trade  is  lower  than  that  of  other \nregions  even  after  factors  such  as  geographic  proximity,  income  levels,  and  population  are \ntaken into account.6 At the same time, estimates of informal trade are high, perhaps as much as \n\n                                                 \n1   SASEC stands for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation, covering Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. \n2  The program\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2011. South Asia: Regional Cooperation Strategy, 2011\u20132015. Manila.  \n4   Trade  facilitation  refers  to  the  reduction  of  costs  related  to  \u201ctransportation  logistics  and  customs  administration \nassociated  with  cross-border  trade\u201d  as  well  as  \u201cthe  environment  in  which  trade  transactions  take  place,  which \nincludes  the  transparency  of  trade  policy  and  regulation,  as  well  as  product  standards,  infrastructure  to  support \ntrade,  and  technology  as  it  applies  to  lowering  trade  costs\u201d.  See  P.  Sourdin  and  R.  Pomfret,  Trade  Facilitation: \nDefining, Measuring, Explaining, and Reducing the Cost of International Trade, Edward Elgar: 2012, p.5. \n\n5  International Monetary Fund. 2010. Direction of Trade Statistics. Washington, DC. \n6  World Bank. 2007. South Asia: Growth and Regional Integration. Washington, DC. The World Bank\u2019s classification \nof  East  Asia  includes  the  countries  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  while  ADB\u2019s \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n72% of formal trade.7 Thus, there is enormous potential for greater subregional trade impacts in \nterms of economies of scale, increased competition, and technology spillovers, which in turn will \nlead to a bigger market and foster faster regional and global integration.8  \n \nHigher costs of trade in South Asia. South Asia fares poorly relative to other regions \n5. \non transaction costs and processing time. It takes on average 32 days for exports to reach their \ndestinations,  which  is  the  same  average  export  time  of  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  Compared  with \nEast Asia and the Pacific, South Asia\u2019s export time is 31% longer, and administrative fees and \nstorage and handling costs are 43% more expensive (Table 1).   \n \n\n \n \n \nRegion \nEast Asia and Pacific \nEastern Europe and \nCentral Asia \nLatin America and \nCaribbean \nMiddle East and North \nAfrica \nOECD (high-income) \nSouth Asia \nSub-Saharan Africa \n\nTable 1: Trade Indicators by Region \n\n \nDocuments to \nExport \n(number) \n6.5 \n6.9 \n\n \nTime to \nExport \n(days) \n21.9 \n27.0 \n\nCost to \nExport \n($ per \ncontainer) \n906 \n1,774 \n\n \nDocuments \nto Import \n(number) \n7.0 \n7.8 \n\nTime \nto \nImport \n(days) \n23.0 \n28.8 \n\nCost to \nImport \n($ per \ncontainer) \n954 \n1,990 \n\n6.4 \n\n6.3 \n\n4.4 \n7.8 \n7.7 \n\n17.8 \n\n19.7 \n\n10.5 \n32.1 \n31.5 \n\n1,257 \n\n1,057 \n\n1,032 \n1,590 \n1,960 \n\n6.9 \n\n7.6 \n\n4.8 \n8.9 \n8.5 \n\n19.6 \n\n23.6 \n\n10.7 \n32.5 \n37.1 \n\n1,546 \n\n1,238 \n\n1,085 \n1,768 \n2,502 \n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \nSource: World Bank. 2012.

Within  SASEC,  the  two  landlocked \ncountries of Bhutan and Nepal have especially high trading costs because of their distance from \nports and low volume of containers. Moreover, the two countries also require a high number of \ndocuments  for  trading,  i.e.,  close  to  twice  the  average  of  Organization  of  Economic  Co-\noperation and Development countries (Table 2). \n \n\nTable 2: Trading Costs within Subregion \n\nRanking \n(trading \nacross \nborders) \n115 \n169 \n109 \n162 \n\nDocuments \nto Exports \n(number) \n6 \n8 \n8 \n9 \n\nCountry \nBangladesh \nBhutan \nIndia \nNepal \nSource: World Bank. 2012.

The high costs of trade and the poor logistics performance \nin  South  Asia  are  due  in  part  to  infrastructure  deficits.  Poor  infrastructure  limits  regional \nconnectivity,  especially  for  landlocked  Bhutan  and  Nepal,  and  the  northeast  region  of  India. \nThese  obstacles  are  worsened  by  the  lack  of  cross-border  transit  agreements,  resulting  in \nmultiple border transshipments. In addition, land border crossings have inadequate facilities for \nwarehousing,  handling,  scanning,  and  testing. 10  These  are  serious  trade  impediments,  as \nalmost  all  intraregional  trade  is  by  land.11 ADB  is  seeking  to  bridge  the  infrastructure  gaps \nthrough  ongoing  and  upcoming  transport  projects.12 Compounding  the  gaps  are  three  sets  of \nNTBs: \n\nTimeliness\n  \n3.46 \n70 \n  \n2.90 \n111 \n  \n3.58 \n44 \n  \n2.21 \n153 \n\n (i) \n\nTime-intensive  processing  and  high  degree  of  inspection.  Recent  studies \nsuggest that while infrastructure constraints are important, the \u201csoft bottlenecks\u201d \nof  administrative  and  technical  barriers  are  \u201cthe  primary  problem\u201d. 13  The \ndominant approach in the subregion combines heavy and intensive physical and \ndocumentary controls. This increases operating costs and is highly inefficient.  \n\n                                                 \n9  LPI measures how efficiently trade is being moved. It is based on a worldwide survey of operators (global freight \nforwarders  and  express  carriers)  providing  feedback  on  the  logistics  \u201cfriendliness\u201d  of  the  countries  in  which  they \noperate.  The  LPI  has  a  maximum  score  of  5.0.  Country  scores  are  obtained  by  computing  and  averaging \nresponses  from  a  questionnaire  filled  by  1,000  logistics  professionals.  The  World  Bank  suggests  the  following \nclassification  for  logistics  performance  in  the  country:  (i)  if  score  <  2.35:  logistics  unfriendly;  (ii)  if  2.35  <  score  < \n2.85:  partial  performance  of  logistics  service  providers;  (iii)  if  2.85  <  score  <  3.35:  consistent  performance  of \nlogistics service providers; and (iv) if score > 3.35: logistics friendly. \nSee LPI website at http://info.worldbank.org/etools/tradesurvey/mode1b.asp.  \n\n10  The  lack,  or  poor  state,  of  testing  facilities  constitutes  technical  barriers  to  trade.  This  includes  the  lack  of \n\ninternational accreditation of product certifications originating from Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal.  \n\n11  There are also constraints arising from security concerns. The porous nature of borders between Bangladesh and \nIndia and between Nepal and India are perceived to be conducive to insurgency, smuggling, and illegal migration, \nwhich foster the creation of NTBs, such as 100% physical examinations and compulsory transshipment. \n\n12 ADB. 2010.

(p. 29). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCumbersome  paperwork  and  limited  automation.  There  is  a  high  level  of \npaperwork and time-consuming procedures at SASEC borders. Multiple copies of \ndocuments  are  required,  and  many  approvals  from  several  national  and  local \ngovernment  agencies,  which  necessitates  the  use  of  clearing  and  forwarding \nagents  acting  as  \u201ccouriers\u201d.  Moreover,  the  customs  management  systems  of \nSASEC  countries  (with  partial  exception  of  India)  are  generally  not  used  as  a \nprocessing  tool  but  as  a  transaction  database.  Manual  and  automated  systems \noperate in parallel, thus increasing rather than decreasing traders\u2019 costs. \nLack  of  information  and  transparency  in  trade.  The  high  level  of  informal \ntrade  in  the  subregion  suggests  that  there  are  strong  incentives  for  traders  to \nbypass rules and regulations. Such action is fostered by  a lack of transparency \nand accountability, partly due to the private sector\u2019s lack of access to information \nand channels for communication. This situation leads to governance risks, deters \nlegitimate trade, and increases transaction costs.  \n\n \n9. \nIndia\u2019s  leading  role.  As  the  dominant  actor  in  subregional  trade,  India  has  taken  a \nleading role in SASEC through its chairing of the last two SASEC TFTWG meetings in Bangkok \nin October 2011 and in Kolkata in March 2012. In Nepal, India accounts for 58% of exports and \n59%  of  imports.  In  Bhutan,  India  accounts  for  93%  of  exports  and  77%  of  imports.  For \nBangladesh,  the  challenge  is  increasing  the  volume  of  trade.  India  accounts  for  only  1.7%  of \nBangladesh\u2019s  exports  and  11.3%  of  its  imports. 14  In  support  of  subregional  trade,  the \nGovernment  of  India,  through  its  integrated  check  posts  project,  is  upgrading  13  land  ports \nalong  the  border  with  Bangladesh,  Myanmar,  Nepal,  and  Pakistan,  which  is  expected  to \nincrease cross-border movements of passengers and goods.  \n \n10. \nStrategic and coordinated approach of the program. Due to its limited resources, the \nprogram  will  be  highly  selective  and  strategic.  A  program  modality  is  proposed  in  view  of  the \npolicy  reforms  required  to  dismantle  NTBs.  Working  closely  with  the  World  Customs \nOrganization  (WCO),  the  program  is  supporting  the  aspirations  of  SASEC  to  meet  global \nstandards and performance benchmarks.15 Moreover, given the complexity of issues and, in the \ncase of Nepal, multiplicity of donor initiatives, the program will be processed in coordination with \nother ADB divisions and other development partners. Notably, the program is being coordinated \nwith  the  Transport  and  Communications  Division  (SATC),  which  is  processing  transport \nprojects,  and  with  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Coordination  Division  (SARC),  which  is \nimplementing  TA  projects \nfacilitation.  The  Public \nManagement,  Financial  Sector  and  Trade  Division,  SARC,  and  SATC  conducted  a  joint  trade \nfacilitation  and  transport  mission  in  March  2012.

The outcome will be more efficient, transparent, secure and service-oriented \nprocessing  of  cross-border  trade  of  SASEC  countries.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  modern  and \neffective  customs  administration  and/or  management;  (ii)  streamlined  and  transparent  trade \nprocesses and procedures; and (iii) improved services and information for private sector traders \nand investors, including women entrepreneurs. \n \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2007.

To \nreduce time-intensive procedures and high levels of inspection, the program will assist the three \nSASEC  countries  in  transforming  their  customs  agencies  to  become  more  modern  agencies. \nSpecifically,  it  will  assist  Bhutan  and  Nepal  to  accede  and  comply  with  the  Revised  Kyoto \nConvention (RKC).16 RKC standards are associated with faster release of goods, reduced trade \ncosts, increased revenues, higher foreign direct investments, and economic competitiveness.17 \nIn  Bhutan,  the  program  will  support  the  conduct  of  a  gap  analysis  with  respect  to  RKC \naccession and the implementation of reforms to close the gaps. In Nepal, the program will help \nsupport accession, which is part of the government\u2019s Customs Reform and Modernization Plan. \n \nThe program will also assist Bangladesh implement the WCO's Framework of Standards \n13. \nto  Secure  and  Facilitate  Global  Trade  (SAFE),  which  to  date  is  unevenly  applied  in  the \nsubregion. 18  As  appropriate,  the  program  will  also  support  Bhutan  and  Nepal  with  SAFE \nFramework implementation. SAFE measures help boost the security of the international supply \nchain and foster and protect legitimate trade. By supporting RKC accession and SAFE adoption, \nthe program seeks to create a convergence of capacities for stronger SASEC trade. \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Streamlined and transparent trade processes and procedures. To reduce \nthe excessive paperwork and increase automation, the program will assist SASEC countries in \nupdating  their  customs  management  systems  and  establishing  a  national  singe  window \n(NSW). 19  The  leading  automated  system  for  managing  customs  data  is  ASYCUDA  World \ndeveloped  by  the  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development.20 The  adoption  of \nASYCUDA World or ASYCUDA-compatible systems\u2014combined with NSW\u2014will result in lower \ncosts  and  fewer  delays  due  to  efficient  transactions,  greater  harmonization  of  forms,  and \nelectronic exchange of information between customs administrations.  \n \nAll  three  participating  countries  have  invested  in  automated  customs  management \n15. \nsystems.  Bangladesh  is  in  the  process  of  upgrading  to  ASYCUDA  World.  Bhutan\u2019s  system  is \nexpected to be replaced by the customs component of a revenue administration management \ninformation  system.21 Nepal  has  secured  financing  from  ADB  to  upgrade  to  ASYCUDA  World \nbut  has  since  requested  program  assistance  to  review  the  suitability  of  upgrading  versus \ndeveloping a bespoke system.22 In addition, through the program, ADB will support Nepal in the \nimplementation  of  its  e-customs  master  plan.  All  SASEC  countries  have  expressed  interest  in \nNSW implementation.23 As a group, SASEC could consider the path taken by the Association of \n                                                 \n16 In September 2012, Bangladesh acceded to the RKC, thus complying with a key policy action for the disbursement \nof  its  1st  tranche  under  the  program.  The  RKC,  or  the  International  Convention  on  the  Simplification  and \nHarmonization of Customs Procedures, came into force in 1999 and represents the most widely accepted blueprint \nfor modern customs operations. Upon accession, it mandates that countries meet RKC standards within 3\u20135 years. \n\n17  WCO. 2010. Benefits of the Revised Kyoto Convention. WCO Research Paper No. 6.

The mission based its \nanalysis and program recommendations on key studies. In Bangladesh, the mission drew on the \ngovernment\u2019s assessment of the requirements for upgrading to ASYCUDA World. In Bhutan, an \nADB TA conducted an as-is analysis of the existing system, followed by a to-be analysis for a \nnew  system  (footnote  21).  In  Nepal,  the  mission  drew  on  a  previous  assessment  of \nAYSCUDA++ under a separate project (footnote 12).  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  program's  economic  and  financial  benefits  to  governments,  businesses,  and \n25. \nconsumers  are  (i)  less  time  spent  by  traders  on  submitting  documents  as  a  result  of  online \nlodgment of declarations; (ii) less processing time spent by custom officers on each declaration, \nas  greater  automation  increases  productivity  and  savings  in  hiring  additional  personnel;  (iii) \nshorter transit time of vehicles due to faster clearing by border authorities, which translates into \nsavings  in  transport  costs  that  can  be  passed  on  to  consumers;  (iv)  more  revenue  could  be \ncollected  through  more  effective  targeting  of  undervalued  and  undeclared  shipments  through \nthe use of risk assessment systems; and (v) cheaper and better-quality goods, as standards are \nmet  and  distribution  costs  are  reduced  thanks  to  more  efficient  processing.  Nonquantifiable \nbenefits relate to the increase in trade generated by the reduction or removal of NTBs. As the \n\n                                                 \n30  ADB.  2006.  Establishing  the  Australia-ADB  South  Asia  Development  Partnership  Facility.  Manila.  The  first  TA  is \nthe  SASEC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Capacity  Building  and  Institutional  Strengthening.  With  a  budget  of \n$1,175,000, the TA will support program implementation in key areas, e.g., gap analyses for accession to the RKC \nand  adoption  of  SAFE  Framework;  regulatory  impact  analyses;  and  assessments  for  NSWs.  The  second  TA  is \nAssessing Gender Dimensions in Regional Cooperation and Integration in South Asia. With a budget of $500,000, \nit  will  conduct  policy-oriented  research  on  increasing  women\u2019s  participation  in  intraregional  trade,  promote  safe \nlabor migration, and mitigate risks of cross-border movements of goods and people. Other TA will be developed in \n2013 to further assist program implementation, e.g., study visits to the Greater Mekong Subregion and Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation programs. For Nepal, additional TA support could include drafting a business plan \nfor the Customs Reform and Modernization Action Plan (2013\u20132017) and devising an e-desk of client services. \n\n\fGovernance \n\ntrading  environment  becomes  more  efficient  and  transparent,  the  incentives  for  illicit  trade  will \nweaken, while the use of legitimate channels will increase and thus generate further revenue.31 \n \nC.  \n \n26.  \nThe  mission  drew  on  risk  assessments  of  the  three  countries  conducted  in  line  with \nADB's  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan.32 Risks  related  to  public  financial \nmanagement  (PFM),  corruption,  and  procurement  are  described  in  each  country\u2019s  risk \nassessment.33 Among the common risks are high opportunities for corruption due to numerous \nface-to-face transactions of border agencies with traders. This is compounded by the agencies\u2019 \nhighly  manual  procedures  in  their  internal  operations  and  frontline  transactions,  which  are \ncharacterized  by  limited  internal  controls.  To  highlight  the  need  to  address  the  issues,  the \nmission discussed with counterparts ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n The  impact  of  the  program  on  poverty  and  social  factors  will  be  indirect  and  gradual. \n27. \nThe  following  groups  will  be  affected:  (i)  government  agencies  involved  in  trade;  (ii)  importers \nand  exporters,  including  women  entrepreneurs;  (iii)  local  businesses;  (iv)  workers,  including \nwomen  workers,  in  export-oriented  enterprises;  (v)  informal  traders;  and  (vi)  clearing  and \nforwarding agents. Some officials may resist automation and process reengineering for fear of \nbecoming  redundant  or  because  more  transparency  will  reduce  their  discretionary  power. \nImporters  and  exporters,  including  women  entrepreneurs,  are  winners  since  the  reforms  will \nreduce their cost of doing business. Local businesses selling domestic goods may fear greater \ncompetition as a result of more imports. Workers in export-oriented enterprises will experience a \nboon  as  exports  are  expected  to  increase  due  to  reforms.  Effects  on  informal  traders  will  be \nmixed\u2014smaller ones will not be affected, larger ones will be forced to formalize trade to reduce \ncosts.  Clearing  and  forwarding  agents  are  likely  to  face  less  demand  as  their  business  model \nrelies on cumbersome procedures. In sum, over the medium term, the removal of NTBs will spur \neconomic growth, reduce poverty, and create jobs with better labor safeguards. \n \nE.  \n \n28. \nThe program\u2019s reforms do not involve physical construction, and an adverse impact on \nthe  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples  is  unlikely.  The  program  is \nthus classified as category C in all three of ADB\u2019s safeguard areas.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards  \n\n29. \nThe program\u2019s support for key trade facilitation reforms have risk mitigating dimensions. \nThe enhancement of customs management systems will help strengthen internal controls. The \nestablishment of NSW will compel reduction of paperwork and simplify procedures, and hence \nwill  reduce  corruption  opportunities.  The  activation  of  trade  facilitation  committees  will \nstrengthen  private  sector  participation  and  introduce  more  transparency  in  trade  processes. \nFurthermore,  in  Bangladesh,  ADB  is  providing  a  TA  to  improve  procurement,  accounting  and \nauditing34 as  well  as  supporting  the  Strengthening  Good  Governance  Program,  which  recently \n\n                                                 \n31 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 ADB. 2006.
