THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nPacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility. The facility will finance a series of individual small-\nvalue renewable energy projects in the 11 smaller Pacific island countries (PIC-11), which have \na combined population of fewer than 1.5 million people.1 The strategic approach of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to addressing the unique development challenges in the PIC-11 is \noutlined  in  the  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u20132020.2 The  facility  will  streamline  ADB\u2019s  internal \nprocedures, enhancing its ability to process small-value projects in the PIC-11 faster and with \nlower transaction costs. The facility will support the PIC-11 in transforming their power sectors \nfrom diesel to sustainable renewable energy generation sources. The facility will support regional \napproaches for energy sector reform, private sector development, and capacity building. \n \n2.  Development of the facility is in response to (i) a growing portfolio of small-value renewable \nenergy projects across the Pacific; and (ii) the need to develop innovative financing models to \nimprove  project  delivery  efficiencies  in  this  particular  set  of  countries,  which  has  specific \nchallenges.  The  facility  will  (i)  delegate  approval  of  individual  project  financing  to  ADB \nManagement of up to $200 million in cumulative ADB financing, in accordance with established \neligibility criteria; and (ii) streamline ADB\u2019s internal procedures. \n \nII.  THE FACILITY \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector issues. The PIC-11 are ADB\u2019s smallest member countries by population size, and \n10 of the PIC-11 are included in the world\u2019s 25 smallest countries. The PIC-11 are members of \nSmall Island Developing States (SIDS), which tend to share similar development challenges, \nincluding small populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to natural disasters, \nvulnerability to external shocks and excessive dependence on international trade. The SIDS are \nrepresented by the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed \nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. \n \n4.  Due to the small size of the economies and isolated nature of the islands, the electricity \ngrids of the PIC-11 are relatively small and not suitable for interconnection. The PIC-11 grids have \npeak loads ranging from 0.8 megawatts (MW) to 22.8 MW across 16 separate power utilities in \nthe 11 countries, with a combined peak load of only 106 MW.3 The grids are operated by wholly \ngovernment-owned corporatized power utilities, with the exception of Vanuatu, which has two \nprivate sector concessions. \n \n5.  The PIC-11 remain heavily dependent on diesel for power generation, which results in \nhigh electricity tariffs by international standards (an average of $0.53 per kilowatt-hour [kWh] \nthroughout  the  PIC-11)  with  associated  negative  impacts  on  economic  growth.4 Uptake  of \n                                                \n1  The PIC-11 consist of the Cook Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, \nPalau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. The PIC-11 do not include the Pacific developing \nmember countries of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste. \n2  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020, Manila. The Pacific Approach is the equivalent of a country partnership \nstrategy for the PIC-11. \n3  For comparison, the peak load is 210 MW in Papua New Guinea and 161 MW in Fiji. \n4  Based on 500 kWh consumption per month. Pacific Power Association. 2016. Performance Benchmarking Report \nfor Pacific Power Utilities, 2014 Fiscal Year. Sydney. High retail tariffs derive largely from the high cost of power \n ", "2 \nrenewable energy is slow; currently only about 9% of electricity generation in the PIC-11 comes \nfrom renewable energy sources. However, this is variable, and 10 out of the 16 utilities have less \nthan 1% penetration.5 The highest penetration is in Samoa, with 26% integration of renewable \nenergy. An overreliance on imported diesel for power generation depletes limited foreign reserves \nand exposes the PIC-11 economies to diesel price shocks. High electricity tariffs increase the \ncost of business for the private sector and place a strain on household incomes. Although the \nPIC-11 have cost-competitive renewable energy resources, uptake is restricted by capacity \nbarriers,  a  need  for  sector  reform,  a  lack  of  financing  options,  and  limited  private  sector \ninvestment. \n \n6.  Capacity constraints. Due to the small size of the economies and the power utilities, the \nPIC-11 face unique capacity constraints. The small size of the public service limits their ability to \ndesign and implement renewable energy policies. The small size of the power utilities limits the \ninternal skills available to manage grids, which are moving rapidly from relatively simple single-\nsource generation systems (diesel) to grids that integrate multiple intermittent renewable energy \nsources. \n \n7.  Need for sector reform. Sector reform requirements are country dependent and vary \nacross the PIC-11. However, there are common challenges, including the requirement for (i) \nrobust sector planning (road maps and grid integration studies) to ensure prioritization of least-\ncost investments, (ii) tariff reform to ensure full cost recovery and social protection, (iii) power \nutility management reform, and (iv) revision of policy and regulatory frameworks to encourage \nprivate sector participation. \n \n8.  Lack of financing options. The investment requirements to undertake the structural shift \nfrom diesel generation to renewable energy for the PIC-11 are significant. The small size of the \neconomies and national constraints on sovereign borrowing means that public sector financing is \nlimited. The provision of grant financing has played an important role for pilot projects, but is \ninsufficient to fully fund the structural conversion to renewable energy in the short to medium term. \nMost PIC-11 governments recognize the important role of private sector investment in providing \nadditional financing and capacity for scaling up renewable energy. Innovative financing modalities \nwill become important to supplement sovereign financing, including the following: \n(i)  introduction of public private partnerships; \n(ii)  scaling up of investment by independent power producers (IPPs), including \ninnovative models such as pay-as-you-go modalities; \n(iii)  crowding in commercial financing through guarantee products; and \n(iv)  alternative delivery models, such as output-based aid. \n \n9.  Barriers to private sector investment. Private sector investment in the PIC-11 energy \nsector  is  currently  limited.  There  are  currently  11  small  IPPs  in  5  of  the  PIC-11,  largely \nconcentrated in Polynesia (the Cook Islands, Samoa, and Tonga). Barriers to private sector \ninvestment include the following: \n(i)  small project size, unfamiliarity with the country and cost of doing business, and \nlack of follow-on business opportunities; \n(ii)  risks associated with land access, particularly for customary ownership; \n(iii)  uncertain regulatory environment; \n                                                \ngeneration, which itself is a consequence of a high reliance on diesel for generation: the remoteness of the PIC-11 \nincreases the cost of diesel delivery, while relatively small engine sizes increase per kWh fuel consumption. \n5  Pacific Power Association. 2016. Performance Benchmarking Report for Pacific Power Utilities, 2014 Fiscal Year \nSydney. \n ", "3 \n(iv)  high financing costs and difficulty in obtaining financing, particularly local currency \nfinancing; \n(v)  payment risk due to financial weakness of many power utilities; and \n(vi)  low  capacity  of  governments  and  utilities  to  negotiate  and  implement  power \npurchase agreements. \n \n10.  Approach to sector issues. The PIC-11 recognize the need to structurally shift power \ngeneration from diesel to renewable energy and have achieved the following: \n(i)  established aggressive national renewable energy targets of 20%\u2013100%; \n(ii)  developed energy policies, which prioritize sector reform activities and renewable \nenergy investments; \n(iii)  gained  experience  in  integration  of  renewable  energy  into  the  grid  through \nconstruction of initial small intermittent renewable energy projects (mainly solar \nand wind); \n(iv)  demonstrated  their  commitment  through  submission  of  nationally  determined \ncontributions for greenhouse gas emission reductions under the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change; and \n(v)  supported the regional Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific \n(FAESP), which was endorsed by Pacific leaders in 2010.6 The FAESP outlines a \nregional energy plan to achieve secured supply, efficient production, and use of \nenergy  for  sustainable  development  through  (a)  leadership,  governance, \ncoordination, and partnerships; (b) capacity development, planning, and policy and \nregulatory frameworks; (c) energy production and supply; (d) energy conversion; \n(e) end-use energy consumption; (f) energy data and information; and (g) financing, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. \n \n11.  Growing  demand for small-value  projects. ADB  has responded  to  the  increased \ndemand for renewable energy investments and is currently the largest investor in renewable \nenergy in the Pacific. ADB is currently supporting nine energy sector projects (mainly renewable \nenergy) in the PIC-11 (total cost $244 million), with an average size of $27 million, including an \naverage ADB investment of $12 million. In the pipeline, 13 projects are planned for the PIC-11 \nduring 2017\u20132019 (total estimated cost $377 million), with an average size of $29 million, \nincluding an average ADB investment of $5 million. This represents a 260% increase in projected \ninvestment flow to the sector. While this demonstrates a significant increase in the renewable \nenergy portfolio, the average project size remains small. ADB financing per project is anticipated \nto be less than $20 million per project.7 Additionally, the scope of each renewable energy project \nis generally similar, mainly consisting of small-scale solar power, wind power, hydropower, and \nrehabilitation of supporting infrastructure. \n \n12.  Although  small-value  projects  in  the  PIC-11  are  similar  in  scope,  ADB  is  currently \npreparing each project under separate technical assistance (TA) projects and processing each \nloan separately. This has resulted in operational inefficiencies such as (i) similar documentation \nat the project concept paper stage, (ii) recruitment of different consulting firms for each project to \nperform similar activities, and (iii) identical transaction costs and timelines as larger projects \ndespite the smaller financing amounts. \n                                                \n6  Secretariat of the Pacific Community. 2011. Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific, 2010\u20132020, \nSuva. The FAESP was endorsed by Pacific island leaders at the 41st Pacific Islands Forum, Vanuatu, 4\u20135 August \n2010. The FAESP will be updated in 2019 to cover the period 2020\u20132030. \n7  The largest ADB financing for a pipelined energy project is $14 million. \n \n ", "4 \n \n13.  Programmatic approach for project preparation and capacity development. As the \nfirst step to address inefficiencies in consultant recruitment, and to support the facility, ADB \napproved a regional TA of $5 million in November 2016 to prepare small-value renewable energy \nprojects taking a programmatic approach.8 The regional TA will initially recruit a single team of \nconsultants to develop projects in the first three PIC-11 countries under the facility (the Cook \nIslands, Tonga, and the Federated States of Micronesia) and conduct sector reform and capacity \nbuilding activities. The regional TA will: \n(i)  conduct project due diligence and prepare feasibility studies, detailed engineering \ndesign, and bidding documents; \n(ii)  implement energy sector reform, including sector planning (road maps and grid \nintegration studies), power utility management reform and capacity building, and \ntariff review and reform; \n(iii)  review and revise regulatory and policy frameworks; \n(iv)  promote private sector participation by screening opportunities for IPPs, providing \ntransaction advice, and designing guarantee products; and \n(v)  disseminate best practices to and share lessons learned with officials from PIC-11 \ngovernments and power utilities. \n \n14.  The programmatic approach to project preparation has already streamlined consultant \nrecruitment for projects in the Cook Islands, Tonga, and the Federated States of Micronesia. ADB \nalso secured an additional $5 million grant from the Green Climate Fund in December 2016 to \nsupport energy sector reform and capacity building under the programmatic approach for the PIC-\n11. \n \n15.  Assessment of existing financing modalities. ADB has assessed available existing \nfinancing modalities, including regional multitranche financing facility (MFF), sector loans, and \nproject loans, to finance a series of renewable energy projects in multiple countries in the Pacific. \nThey have been found to be unsuitable. In particular, the MFF was found to involve substantial \nchallenges in processing and implementation due to the application of MFF requirements in a \nregional  context,  including  the  need  for  a  regional  sector  road  map,  country-level  policy \nframeworks,  and  a  regional  framework  financing  agreement  to  be  signed  with  all  PIC-11 \ncountries. Consequently, it is more difficult to realize the efficiency gains associated with MFFs in \na multi-country MFF. \n \n16.  The policy paper on Enhancing Operational Efficiency of ADB envisaged a financing \nfacility which may include a pipeline of small loans\u2014particularly for a group of member countries \nin a small region and/or in fragile and conflict-affected situations\u2014which is submitted as a \nstrategic package for ADB\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 approval, with each financing proposal under the \nfacility to be approved by the President. 9  Such an approach fits the PIC-11 context; the Pacific \nApproach calls for flexibility in processes, project duration, and approach as well as prioritizing \ncost reductions by harnessing renewable energy to drive down the cost of electricity and fossil \nfuel imports. \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2016.

A novel financing approach. To finance the large number of small-value renewable \nenergy projects in the PIC-11, ADB proposes the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility.10 \nThe facility provides an aggregated approval limit under which the President is authorized to \napprove loans and grants to a range of qualifying small-value renewable energy projects in the \nPIC-11 from 2017 to 2022. The facility will support investment in a range of renewable energy \nprojects, which will benefit the PIC-11 economies through (i) improved balance of trade by \nreducing fossil fuel imports, (ii) improved energy security, (iii) downward pressure on tariffs, and \n(iv) reduced greenhouse emissions.11 \n \n18.  Streamlined processes. The facility will allow ADB to significantly increase its support \nfor the development of renewable energy in the PIC-11 by (i) scaling up financing through \nimproved  leveraging  of  cofinancing,  promotion  of  the  private  sector,  and  development  of \ninnovative financing modalities; (ii) providing systematic medium-term support for sector reform; \nand (iii) improving efficiencies of project processing by streamlining internal processes. Working \non a programmatic basis across the entire sector allows for a range of regional benefits not \navailable on a project-by-project basis (para 21-28). The facility will provide a range of benefits to \nthe PIC-11, including the following: \n(i)  faster achievement of renewable energy targets; \n(ii)  increased resources (financial and TA) to implement national renewable energy \ntargets; \n(iii)  increased access to TA for implementation of reform agendas; \n(iv)  benefits from faster and more efficient processing of financing; and \n(v)  improved access to lessons learned, and increased awareness of successful \nprojects in other PIC-11 countries. \n \n19.  The proposed implementation arrangements are detailed in section E. It is estimated that \nthe facility will result in (i) an increase in the number of energy projects processed annually in the \nPIC-11 by one-third, (ii) a reduction in the staff time spent on consultant recruitment by half, and \n(iii) a reduction of project processing time by one-third. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The impact will be improved regional energy security in the Pacific, as stated under the \nFAESP. The outcome will be increased generation of lower-cost and cleaner energy.12 An \nindicative outline of projects, including anticipated year of approval and scope, is in the indicative \nproject pipeline.13 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n21.  Output 1: Renewable energy generation facilities and supporting infrastructure \nconstructed and/or rehabilitated.

ADB. 2015. Faster Approach to Small Nonsovereign Transactions. Manila. \n11 Renewable energy investments supported by the facility will have the lowest levelized cost of energy amongst \ngeneration options, incorporating life cycle costs and Value for Money. Recent experience in the Pacific in financing \nrenewable energy infrastructure indicates that renewable energy is often lower cost than diesel generation.  \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 Indicative Project Pipeline (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "6 \nenergy and supporting infrastructure projects in the PIC-11 over a 5-year period.14 It is estimated \nto include the following: \n(i)  80 MW of solar, wind, and hydropower generation capacity installed;15 \n(ii)  30 MW-hours of battery storage installed; \n(iii)  300  kilometers  of  transmission  and  distribution  network  constructed  or \nrehabilitated; \n(iv)  five diesel plants refurbished to improve efficiency; and \n(v)  four rural electrification projects installed (hybrid solar systems and distribution \nexpansion). \n \n22.  Details of the first three projects proposed for approval under the facility in 2017 are \nsummarized in paras. 23\u201325 and outlined in the indicative project pipeline, which also provides \nthe indicative projects to be financed under the facility. \n \n23.  Project 1: Cook Islands, Renewable Energy Sector Project (Additional Financing). \nThe project will support the installation of battery storage on the Rarotonga grid to scale up \nrenewable energy, including (i) battery storage for grid stability, (ii) battery storage for load shifting \ncapability, and (iii) capacity building. This will result in 6 MW of solar power through private sector \ninvestment, which will increase renewable energy to approximately 50%. The project is included \nin the Cook Islands Renewable Energy Chart and Implementation Plan, which targets 100% \nrenewable energy by 2020. Total project costs are $16 million, including $12 million from GCF \n(approved in December 2016) and $4 million government counterpart. While due diligence is still \nongoing, the project is expected to be economically viable.  ADB Management approval is \nscheduled for August 2017. Safeguard categorizations are B for environment, B for involuntary \nresettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. \n \n24.  Project 2: Tonga, Outer Island Renewable Energy Project (Additional Financing). \nThe project will support the construction of a solar mini-grid system on Niuatoputapu of the Niua \ngroup. The project is included in the Tonga Energy Road Map, 2010\u20132020, which establishes the \nnational target of generating 50% renewable energy by 2020. Total project costs are $6.89 million, \nto be financed by a Global Environment Fund grant ($2.89 million, approved in April 2016), ADB\u2019s \nConcessional Ordinary Capital Resources Loans ($1.5 million), an Asian Development Fund grant \n($1.5 million), and cofinancing ($1 million). Due diligence is ongoing and ADB Management \napproval is scheduled for September 2017. Safeguard categorizations are B for environment, C \nfor involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. \n \n25.  Project 3: Vanuatu, Energy Access Project. The project will increase energy access \nand renewable energy generation on the two islands of Espiritu Santo and Malekula. The outputs \ninclude (i) Brenwe Hydropower Plant (400 kilowatts), (ii) distribution extension, and (iii) capacity \nbuilding. The project is a priority under the Vanuatu National Energy Road Map 2014. Total project \ncosts  are  $15.1  million,  to  be  funded  by  the  Strategic  Climate  Fund  ($7  million),  ADB\u2019s \nConcessional Ordinary Capital Resources Loans ($2.5 million), an Asian Development Fund grant \n($2.5 million), and government ($3.1 million). Due diligence is substantially completed. The project \nis economically viable. ADB Management approval is scheduled for August 2017. Safeguard \ncategorizations are B for environment, B for involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous \npeoples. \n \n                                                \n14 Supporting infrastructure will include investments to increase energy access.  \n15 Demand-side energy efficiency management will be mainstreamed in parallel with design of new generation. \n ", "7 \n26.  Output 2: Energy sector reform and capacity building undertaken. This output, which \nincludes promotion of private sector, will be financed by a regional project preparatory TA. \n \n27.  The facility will support sector reform and capacity building through the following: \n(i)  Systematic medium-term reform dialogue and support. The facility will support \nsystematic assessments of sector reform priorities, and undertake medium-term \nsector reform dialogue, as opposed to short-term dialogue on a project-by-project \nbasis. TA will be provided over the medium term (3\u20135 years) for PIC-11 reform \npriorities.  Reform  dialogue  will  include  sector  planning  (road  maps  and  grid \nintegration studies), power utility management reform, tariff review and reform, and \nregulatory and policy framework reform. \n(ii)  Coordinated reform agendas. The facility will document reform priorities in each \nparticipating PIC-11 and hold workshops with development partners to promote a \nuniform understanding on proposed reform pathways. \n(iii)  Support  for  regional  initiatives.  The  facility  will  support  targeted  regional \ninitiatives,  which  support  sector  reforms  outlined  in  the  FAESP,  and  the \nestablishment of an energy regulators association. \n(iv)  Sharing of lessons learned. The facility offers enhanced opportunities for sharing \nof lessons learned among the PIC-11. This will be facilitated by the regional facility \nsupport unit (FSU) and enhanced through regional workshops and knowledge \nproducts. \n \n28.  The facility will support private sector investments through the following: \n(i)  Systematic screening. Opportunities for IPPs will be systematically screened \nacross all participating PIC-11. This will include targeting sovereign financing on \ninfrastructure to accommodate private sector investment. \n(ii)  Bundling  of  procurement.  Opportunities  will  be  explored  for  bundling  of \nprocurement across the PIC-11 to increase contract size and attract new investors \nand contractors to the PIC-11. Bundling across the PIC-11 may be particularly \nuseful for IPPs and engineering, procurement, and construction contractors. \n(iii)  Outreach. Outreach will be conducted across the PIC-11 to encourage private \nsector investment to the region by supporting regional events such as the Pacific \nEnergy  Investors  Forum  (held  during  the  Pacific  Power  Association  Annual \nConference)  and  developing  outreach  tools  to  reach  potential  investors. \nConducting regional outreach encourages investors to view the Pacific as a single \nregion, rather than a series of small individual countries. \n(iv)  Regional  guarantee  fund.  Options  for  a  regional  guarantee  facility  will  be \nexplored to reduce payment risk for IPPs, lower their cost of capital, and ultimately \nlower the negotiated off-take tariffs, which will benefit the PIC-11. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n29.  The facility will finance renewable energy projects with an overall estimated cost of $750 \nmillion, including an estimated $500 million from cofinancing sources and an estimated $50 million \nfrom government counterpart financing. ADB financing is up to $200 million and is estimated to \nconsist of an approximately $10 million loan from ADB\u2019s regular ordinary capital resources, \napproximately $110 million in loans from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital resources, and \napproximately $80 million in grants from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund). In addition, the facility will leverage private sector investment through sector reform, \ncapacity building and targeted sovereign investments. Specific project allocations will be subject \nto country performance-based allocations and country-specific programming discussions, subject \n ", "8 \nto the $200 million maximum for the facility across all PIC-11 countries. The summary financing \nplan is in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier will be \nincluded in the project administration manual for each individual project. Climate mitigation and \nadaptation costs will be estimated during project preparation and also detailed in the project \nadministration manual for each project. Cofinancing allocations are indicative only and will be \nconfirmed prior to project approval. \n \nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Banka.      \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loans)  10.0  1.3 \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loans)  110.0  14.7 \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund \ngrants)  80.0  10.7 \nCofinancing b.   500.0  66.7 \nGovernment  50.0  6.6 \nTotal  750.0  100.0 \na.

The implementation period for the facility will be over an 8-year period from July 2017 to \nJuly 2025. ADB will receive funding proposals over a 5-year period from July 2017 to July 2022. \nThe deadline for the final approval of the funding proposals under the facility will be 29 July 2022.16 \nThe facility will delegate approval of individual project financing to ADB Management of up to \n$200 million in cumulative ADB financing, in accordance with established eligibility criteria. \nMultiple projects in a single country may be approved. There is no financing cap on an individual \ncountry within the cumulative approval threshold. Additional financing may be included under the \nfacility. Regional projects may also be considered across multiple PIC-11 countries. There will be \nno limit for cofinancing or government contributions. \n \n31.  It is proposed that the Board delegate approval to the President for loans and/or grants to \neach PIC for qualifying projects under the facility. Project qualifying criteria consist of the following: \n(i)  project scope includes renewable energy generation and supporting energy sector \ninfrastructure,17 \n(ii)  project is in one of the PIC-11, \n(iii)  project is included in national energy sector planning documents as a priority \ninvestment, and \n                                                \n16 The period between final approval of funding proposals (29 July 2022) and the end of the implementation period of \nthe facility (July 2015) is considered sufficient for final project implementation. However, should implementation of \nthe final project require additional time, the implementation period for the facility may be extended to cover the final \nproject\u2019s implementation. \n17 Supporting infrastructure includes the required power sector infrastructure to maintain grid operation. This includes, \nbut is not limited to, transmission and distribution assets, diesel generation rehabilitation and upgrades, and \nrehabilitation of tank farm assets. \n \n ", "9 \n(iv)  environment category A projects are excluded in general.18 \n \n32.  The President will consider and, if appropriate, approve the financing of each qualifying \nproject based on a facility financing proposal.19 The format of the facility financing proposal will \nbe the same as that of the report and recommendation of the President for a sovereign project. \nProject processing and due diligence will be carried out following existing operations manuals and \nstaff instructions, primarily for stand-alone projects.20 \n  \n33.  The facility financing proposal for each project will be disclosed to the public in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  2011.  ADB  will  report  progress  on  facility \nimplementation annually to the Board. Prior to 31 July 2020 or when 50% of the $200 million \napproval limit has been utilized, whichever occurs first, ADB will conduct an interim review of the \nfacility and report to the Board, including recommendations for design modifications (if any). \n \n34.  An FSU will be established in ADB headquarters to support the design and implementation \nof the facility, including preparation of projects. The FSU will include consultants financed by the \nregional project preparatory TA. Project implementation units (PIUs) will be established within the \nimplementing agencies in each participating country. In support of project preparation, the FSU \nwill (i) oversee the consulting firm(s); (ii) support the national PIUs, including in the sharing of \nlessons learned between PIUs; (iii) provide independent technical review of feasibility and detailed \ndesign; (iv) monitor and report on processing and implementation progress; and (v) support \nenergy sector reform, including (a) sector planning (road maps and grid integration studies), (b) \npower utility management reform and capacity building, (c) tariff review and reform, (d) review \nand revision of regulatory and policy frameworks, and (e) promotion of the private sector, as \nappropriate. A project steering committee will oversee implementation, monitor progress, and \nprovide guidance to the executing agency in each participating country. \n \n35.  For  projects  where  ADB  will  be  administering  cofinancing  resources,  universal \nprocurement will apply.21 Retroactive financing and/or advance contracting will be considered on \na project-by-project basis. The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \n \n36.  Preparation of the initial projects under the facility will be supported through a regional TA \n(footnote 8). This TA will be expanded to cover preparation of the subsequent projects.22 The \nregional TA will support (i) project preparation, including due diligence and feasibility studies; and \n(ii)  implementation,  consisting  of  detailed  design  and  project  procurement.  Construction \nsupervision will be supported under the individual projects. All consultants will be recruited in \n                                                \n18 In the event that there is an environment category A project, a paper will be submitted to the Board for its decision \nwhether to authorize the President to approve the financing for the project. This is similar to the approach for MFF \nsecond or subsequent tranches that are environment category A. \n19 The format for the facility financing proposal will follow the format for the sovereign project loan report and \nrecommendation of the President. \n20 Specific processing procedures are described in the Project Processing Flowchart (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n21 ADB. 2013.

DUE DILIGENCE AND BUSINESS PROCESS \n37.  With the exception of project concept clearance, the procedures for financing projects \nunder the facility will follow those for the processing of stand-alone or sector projects. Due \ndiligence will be carried out on each project in accordance with ADB policies and procedures, and \nthe results of the due diligence summarized in the facility financing proposals. Due diligence will \ninclude  technical,  economic,  financial,  governance  (including  financial  management  risk \ncategorization), integrity, gender, and climate change impacts. Innovative technical solutions will \nbe incorporated, where appropriate.23 A risk management assessment and risk management plan \nwill be prepared for each project. For safeguards due diligence, each project will be screened and \ncategorized  separately  at  the  outset  of  project  preparation  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The safeguard categorization will subsequently guide the preparation of appropriate \nsafeguard assessment documentation. The facility is expected to support mainly category B and \nC projects.24  \n \nIV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the  Pacific  Renewable  Energy  Investment  Facility  in  an  aggregate  principal \namount not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000,000; and \n(ii)  the delegation of authority to the President for approval of the loans and/or grants \nunder the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility as described in paragraph \n30 of this report. \n \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n30 May 2017 \n                                                \n23 Innovative solutions may include micro-grids and energy management systems. \n24 See footnote 18 on the approach to projects that are classified as category A for environmental impact. \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Facility is Aligned with \nRegional energy security in the Pacific is improved (Framework for Action on Energy Security in the \nPacific, 2010\u20132020)a  \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By June 2025    Utilities do not maintain \nGeneration of lower- a.
