The facility will finance a series of individual small-\nvalue renewable energy projects in the 11 smaller Pacific island countries (PIC-11), which have \na  combined  population  of  fewer  than  1.5  million  people.1 The  strategic  approach  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  addressing  the  unique  development  challenges  in  the  PIC-11  is \noutlined  in  the  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u20132020. 2  The  facility  will  streamline  ADB\u2019s  internal \nprocedures,  enhancing  its  ability  to  process  small-value  projects  in the  PIC-11  faster  and  with \nlower transaction costs. The facility will support the PIC-11 in transforming their power sectors \nfrom diesel to sustainable renewable energy generation sources. The facility will support regional \napproaches for energy sector reform, private sector development, and capacity building. \n \n2. \nDevelopment of the facility is in response to (i) a growing portfolio of small-value renewable \nenergy projects across the Pacific; and (ii) the need to develop innovative financing models to \nimprove  project  delivery  efficiencies  in  this  particular  set  of  countries,  which  has  specific \nchallenges.  The  facility  will  (i)  delegate  approval  of  individual  project  financing  to  ADB \nManagement of up to $200 million in cumulative ADB financing, in accordance with established \neligibility criteria; and (ii) streamline ADB\u2019s internal procedures. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FACILITY \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nSector issues. The PIC-11 are ADB\u2019s smallest member countries by population size, and \n3. \n10 of the PIC-11 are included in the world\u2019s 25 smallest countries. The PIC-11 are members of \nSmall  Island  Developing  States (SIDS),  which  tend  to  share  similar development challenges, \nincluding  small  populations,  limited  resources,  remoteness,  susceptibility  to natural  disasters, \nvulnerability to external shocks and excessive dependence on international trade. The SIDS are \nrepresented  by  the  United  Nations  Office  of  the  High  Representative for  the  Least  Developed \nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. \n \nDue to the small size of the economies and isolated nature of the islands, the electricity \n4. \ngrids of the PIC-11 are relatively small and not suitable for interconnection. The PIC-11 grids have \npeak loads ranging from 0.8 megawatts (MW) to 22.8 MW across 16 separate power utilities in \nthe 11 countries, with a combined peak load of only 106 MW.3 The grids are operated by wholly \ngovernment-owned  corporatized  power  utilities,  with  the  exception  of  Vanuatu,  which  has  two \nprivate sector concessions. \n \n5. \nThe  PIC-11  remain  heavily  dependent  on  diesel  for  power  generation,  which  results  in \nhigh  electricity  tariffs  by  international  standards  (an  average  of  $0.53  per  kilowatt-hour  [kWh] \nthroughout  the  PIC-11)  with  associated  negative  impacts  on  economic  growth. 4  Uptake  of \n\n                                                \n1  The PIC-11 consist of the Cook Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, \nPalau, Samoa,  Solomon Islands,  Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. The PIC-11 do not include the Pacific developing \nmember countries of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste. \n\n2  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020, Manila. The Pacific Approach is the equivalent of a country partnership \n\nstrategy for the PIC-11. \n\n3  For comparison, the peak load is 210 MW in Papua New Guinea and 161 MW in Fiji. \n4  Based on 500 kWh consumption per month. Pacific Power Association. 2016. Performance Benchmarking Report \nfor Pacific Power Utilities, 2014 Fiscal Year. Sydney. High retail tariffs derive largely from the high cost of power \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nrenewable energy is slow; currently only about 9% of electricity generation in the PIC-11 comes \nfrom renewable energy sources. However, this is variable, and 10 out of the 16 utilities have less \nthan 1% penetration.5 The highest penetration is in Samoa, with 26% integration of renewable \nenergy. An overreliance on imported diesel for power generation depletes limited foreign reserves \nand  exposes the  PIC-11  economies  to  diesel  price  shocks.  High  electricity  tariffs  increase  the \ncost of business for the private sector and place a strain on household incomes. Although the \nPIC-11  have  cost-competitive  renewable  energy  resources,  uptake  is  restricted  by  capacity \nbarriers,  a  need  for  sector  reform,  a  lack  of  financing  options,  and  limited  private  sector \ninvestment. \n \n6. \nCapacity constraints. Due to the small size of the economies and the power utilities, the \nPIC-11 face unique capacity constraints. The small size of the public service limits their ability to \ndesign and implement renewable energy policies. The small size of the power utilities limits the \ninternal skills available to manage grids, which are moving rapidly from relatively simple single-\nsource generation systems (diesel) to grids that integrate multiple intermittent renewable energy \nsources. \n \n7. \nNeed  for  sector  reform.  Sector  reform  requirements  are  country  dependent  and  vary \nacross  the  PIC-11.  However,  there  are  common  challenges,  including  the  requirement  for  (i) \nrobust sector planning (road maps and grid integration studies) to ensure prioritization of least-\ncost  investments,  (ii)  tariff  reform  to  ensure  full  cost  recovery  and  social  protection,  (iii)  power \nutility  management  reform,  and (iv)  revision  of  policy  and  regulatory frameworks  to  encourage \nprivate sector participation. \n \nLack of financing options. The investment requirements to undertake the structural shift \n8. \nfrom diesel generation to renewable energy for the PIC-11 are significant. The small size of the \neconomies and national constraints on sovereign borrowing means that public sector financing is \nlimited.  The  provision  of  grant  financing  has  played  an  important  role  for  pilot  projects,  but  is \ninsufficient to fully fund the structural conversion to renewable energy in the short to medium term. \nMost PIC-11 governments recognize the important role of private sector investment in providing \nadditional financing and capacity for scaling up renewable energy. Innovative financing modalities \nwill become important to supplement sovereign financing, including the following: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nintroduction of public private partnerships; \nscaling up of investment by independent power producers (IPPs), including \ninnovative models such as pay-as-you-go modalities; \ncrowding in commercial financing through guarantee products; and \nalternative delivery models, such as output-based aid. \n\n \n9. \nBarriers to private sector investment. Private sector investment in the PIC-11 energy \nsector  is  currently  limited.  There  are  currently  11  small  IPPs  in  5  of  the  PIC-11,  largely \nconcentrated  in  Polynesia  (the  Cook  Islands,  Samoa,  and  Tonga).  Barriers  to  private  sector \ninvestment include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nsmall project size, unfamiliarity with the country and cost of doing business, and \nlack of follow-on business opportunities; \nrisks associated with land access, particularly for customary ownership; \nuncertain regulatory environment; \n\n                                                \n\ngeneration, which itself is a consequence of a high reliance on diesel for generation: the remoteness of the PIC-11 \nincreases the cost of diesel delivery, while relatively small engine sizes increase per kWh fuel consumption. \n\n5  Pacific Power Association. 2016.

The PIC-11 recognize the need to structurally shift power \n\nestablished aggressive national renewable energy targets of 20%\u2013100%; \ndeveloped energy policies, which prioritize sector reform activities and renewable \nenergy investments; \ngained  experience  in  integration  of  renewable  energy  into  the  grid  through \nconstruction  of  initial  small  intermittent  renewable  energy  projects  (mainly  solar \nand wind); \ndemonstrated  their  commitment  through  submission  of  nationally  determined \ncontributions  for  greenhouse gas  emission  reductions  under  the  United  Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change; and \nsupported  the  regional  Framework  for  Action  on  Energy  Security  in  the  Pacific \n(FAESP), which was endorsed by Pacific leaders in 2010.6 The FAESP outlines a \nregional energy plan to achieve secured supply, efficient production, and use of \nleadership,  governance, \nenergy \ncoordination, and partnerships; (b) capacity development, planning, and policy and \nregulatory frameworks; (c) energy production and supply; (d) energy conversion; \n(e) end-use energy consumption; (f) energy data and information; and (g) financing, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. \n\nfor  sustainable  development \n\nthrough  (a) \n\n \n11. \nGrowing  demand  for  small-value  projects.  ADB  has  responded  to  the  increased \ndemand  for  renewable  energy  investments  and  is  currently  the  largest  investor  in  renewable \nenergy in the Pacific. ADB is currently supporting nine energy sector projects (mainly renewable \nenergy) in the PIC-11 (total cost $244 million), with an average size of $27 million, including an \naverage ADB investment of $12 million. In the pipeline, 13 projects are planned for the PIC-11 \nduring  2017\u20132019  (total  estimated  cost  $377  million),  with  an  average  size  of  $29  million, \nincluding an average ADB investment of $5 million. This represents a 260% increase in projected \ninvestment  flow  to  the  sector. While  this  demonstrates  a  significant  increase  in the  renewable \nenergy portfolio, the average project size remains small. ADB financing per project is anticipated \nto be less than $20 million per project.7 Additionally, the scope of each renewable energy project \nis generally similar, mainly consisting of small-scale solar power, wind power, hydropower, and \nrehabilitation of supporting infrastructure. \n \n12. \nAlthough  small-value  projects  in  the  PIC-11  are  similar  in  scope,  ADB  is  currently \npreparing each project under separate technical assistance (TA) projects and processing each \nloan separately. This has resulted in operational inefficiencies such as (i) similar documentation \nat the project concept paper stage, (ii) recruitment of different consulting firms for each project to \nperform  similar  activities,  and  (iii)  identical  transaction  costs  and  timelines  as  larger  projects \ndespite the smaller financing amounts. \n\n                                                \n6  Secretariat of  the Pacific Community. 2011. Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific, 2010\u20132020, \nSuva. The FAESP was endorsed by Pacific island leaders at the 41st Pacific Islands Forum, Vanuatu, 4\u20135 August \n2010. The FAESP will be updated in 2019 to cover the period 2020\u20132030. \n\n7  The largest ADB financing for a pipelined energy project is $14 million. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f \n13. \nProgrammatic approach for project preparation and capacity development. As the \nfirst  step  to  address  inefficiencies  in  consultant  recruitment,  and  to  support  the  facility,  ADB \napproved a regional TA of $5 million in November 2016 to prepare small-value renewable energy \nprojects taking a programmatic approach.8 The regional TA will initially recruit a single team of \nconsultants  to  develop  projects  in  the  first  three  PIC-11  countries  under  the  facility  (the  Cook \nIslands, Tonga, and the Federated States of Micronesia) and conduct sector reform and capacity \nbuilding activities. The regional TA will: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nconduct project due diligence and prepare feasibility studies, detailed engineering \ndesign, and bidding documents; \nimplement  energy  sector  reform,  including  sector  planning  (road  maps  and  grid \nintegration studies), power utility management reform and capacity building, and \ntariff review and reform; \nreview and revise regulatory and policy frameworks; \npromote private sector participation by screening opportunities for IPPs, providing \ntransaction advice, and designing guarantee products; and \ndisseminate best practices to and share lessons learned with officials from PIC-11 \ngovernments and power utilities. \n\n \nThe  programmatic  approach  to  project  preparation  has  already  streamlined  consultant \n14. \nrecruitment for projects in the Cook Islands, Tonga, and the Federated States of Micronesia. ADB \nalso secured an additional $5 million grant from the Green Climate Fund in December 2016 to \nsupport energy sector reform and capacity building under the programmatic approach for the PIC-\n11. \n \n15. \nAssessment  of  existing  financing  modalities.  ADB  has  assessed  available  existing \nfinancing  modalities,  including  regional  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF),  sector  loans,  and \nproject loans, to finance a series of renewable energy projects in multiple countries in the Pacific. \nThey have been found to be unsuitable. In particular, the MFF was found to involve substantial \nchallenges in processing and implementation due to  the  application of  MFF  requirements  in a \nregional  context,  including  the  need  for  a  regional  sector  road  map,  country-level  policy \nframeworks,  and  a  regional  framework  financing  agreement  to  be  signed  with  all  PIC-11 \ncountries. Consequently, it is more difficult to realize the efficiency gains associated with MFFs in \na multi-country MFF. \n \n16. \nThe  policy  paper  on  Enhancing  Operational  Efficiency  of  ADB  envisaged  a  financing \nfacility which may include a pipeline of small loans\u2014particularly for a group of member countries \nin  a  small  region  and/or  in  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations\u2014which  is  submitted  as  a \nstrategic package for ADB\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 approval, with each financing proposal under the \nfacility to be approved by the President. 9  Such an approach fits the PIC-11 context; the Pacific \nApproach calls for flexibility in processes, project duration, and approach as well as prioritizing \ncost reductions by harnessing renewable energy to drive down the cost of electricity and fossil \nfuel imports. \n \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fA  novel  financing  approach.  To  finance  the  large  number  of  small-value  renewable \n17. \nenergy projects in the PIC-11, ADB proposes the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility.10 \nThe  facility  provides  an  aggregated  approval  limit  under  which  the  President  is  authorized  to \napprove loans and grants to a range of qualifying small-value renewable energy projects in the \nPIC-11 from 2017 to 2022. The facility will support investment in a range of renewable energy \nprojects,  which  will  benefit  the  PIC-11  economies  through  (i)  improved  balance  of  trade  by \nreducing fossil fuel imports, (ii) improved energy security, (iii) downward pressure on tariffs, and \n(iv) reduced greenhouse emissions.11 \n \n18. \nStreamlined processes. The facility will allow ADB to significantly increase its support \nfor  the  development  of  renewable  energy  in  the  PIC-11  by  (i)  scaling  up  financing  through \nimproved  leveraging  of  cofinancing,  promotion  of  the  private  sector,  and  development  of \ninnovative financing modalities; (ii) providing systematic medium-term support for sector reform; \nand (iii) improving efficiencies of project processing by streamlining internal processes. Working \non  a  programmatic  basis  across  the  entire  sector  allows  for  a  range  of  regional  benefits  not \navailable on a project-by-project basis (para 21-28). The facility will provide a range of benefits to \nthe PIC-11, including the following: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nfaster achievement of renewable energy targets; \nincreased resources (financial and TA) to implement national renewable energy \ntargets; \nincreased access to TA for implementation of reform agendas; \nbenefits from faster and more efficient processing of financing; and \nimproved access to lessons learned, and increased awareness of successful \nprojects in other PIC-11 countries. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n19. \nThe proposed implementation arrangements are detailed in section E. It is estimated that \nthe facility will result in (i) an increase in the number of energy projects processed annually in the \nPIC-11 by one-third, (ii) a reduction in the staff time spent on consultant recruitment by half, and \n(iii) a reduction of project processing time by one-third. \n \nB. \n \n20. \nThe impact will be improved regional energy security in the Pacific, as stated under the \nFAESP.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  generation  of  lower-cost  and  cleaner  energy. 12  An \nindicative outline of projects, including anticipated year of approval and scope, is in the indicative \nproject pipeline.13 \n \nC. \n \n21. \nOutput  1:  Renewable  energy  generation  facilities  and  supporting  infrastructure \nconstructed  and/or  rehabilitated.

Manila. \n\n11 Renewable  energy  investments  supported  by  the  facility  will  have  the  lowest  levelized  cost  of  energy  amongst \ngeneration options, incorporating life cycle costs and Value for Money. Recent experience in the Pacific in financing \nrenewable energy infrastructure indicates that renewable energy is often lower cost than diesel generation.  \n\n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 Indicative Project Pipeline (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fenergy and supporting infrastructure projects in the PIC-11 over a 5-year period.14 It is estimated \nto include the following: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n80 MW of solar, wind, and hydropower generation capacity installed;15 \n30 MW-hours of battery storage installed; \n300  kilometers  of \nrehabilitated; \nfive diesel plants refurbished to improve efficiency; and \nfour  rural  electrification  projects  installed  (hybrid  solar  systems  and  distribution \nexpansion). \n\ntransmission  and  distribution  network  constructed  or \n\n \n22. \nDetails  of  the  first  three  projects  proposed  for  approval  under  the  facility  in  2017  are \nsummarized in paras. 23\u201325 and outlined in the indicative project pipeline, which also provides \nthe indicative projects to be financed under the facility. \n \n23. \nProject 1: Cook Islands, Renewable Energy Sector Project (Additional Financing). \nThe  project  will  support  the  installation  of  battery  storage  on  the  Rarotonga  grid  to  scale  up \nrenewable energy, including (i) battery storage for grid stability, (ii) battery storage for load shifting \ncapability, and (iii) capacity building. This will result in 6 MW of solar power through private sector \ninvestment, which will increase renewable energy to approximately 50%. The project is included \nin  the  Cook  Islands  Renewable  Energy  Chart  and  Implementation  Plan,  which  targets  100% \nrenewable energy by 2020. Total project costs are $16 million, including $12 million from  GCF \n(approved in December 2016) and $4 million government counterpart. While due diligence is still \nongoing,  the  project  is  expected  to  be  economically  viable.  ADB  Management  approval  is \nscheduled for August 2017. Safeguard categorizations are B for environment, B for involuntary \nresettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. \n \n24. \nProject  2:  Tonga,  Outer  Island  Renewable  Energy  Project  (Additional  Financing). \nThe project will support the construction of a solar mini-grid system on Niuatoputapu of the Niua \ngroup. The project is included in the Tonga Energy Road Map, 2010\u20132020, which establishes the \nnational target of generating 50% renewable energy by 2020. Total project costs are $6.89 million, \nto be financed by a Global Environment Fund grant ($2.89 million, approved in April 2016), ADB\u2019s \nConcessional Ordinary Capital Resources Loans ($1.5 million), an Asian Development Fund grant \n($1.5  million),  and  cofinancing  ($1  million).  Due  diligence  is  ongoing  and  ADB  Management \napproval is scheduled for September 2017. Safeguard categorizations are B for environment, C \nfor involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. \n \nProject  3:  Vanuatu,  Energy  Access  Project.  The  project  will  increase energy  access \n25. \nand renewable energy generation on the two islands of Espiritu Santo and Malekula. The outputs \ninclude (i) Brenwe Hydropower Plant (400 kilowatts), (ii) distribution extension, and (iii) capacity \nbuilding. The project is a priority under the Vanuatu National Energy Road Map 2014. Total project \ncosts  are  $15.1  million,  to  be  funded  by  the  Strategic  Climate  Fund  ($7  million),  ADB\u2019s \nConcessional Ordinary Capital Resources Loans ($2.5 million), an Asian Development Fund grant \n($2.5 million), and government ($3.1 million). Due diligence is substantially completed. The project \nis  economically  viable.  ADB  Management  approval  is  scheduled  for  August  2017.  Safeguard \ncategorizations  are  B  for  environment,  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  C  for  indigenous \npeoples. \n \n\n                                                \n14 Supporting infrastructure will include investments to increase energy access.  \n15 Demand-side energy efficiency management will be mainstreamed in parallel with design of new generation. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nOutput 2: Energy sector reform and capacity building undertaken. This output, which \n\n26. \nincludes promotion of private sector, will be financed by a regional project preparatory TA. \n \n27. \n\nThe facility will support sector reform and capacity building through the following: \n(i) \n\nSystematic medium-term reform dialogue and support. The facility will support \nsystematic assessments of sector reform priorities, and undertake medium-term \nsector reform dialogue, as opposed to short-term dialogue on a project-by-project \nbasis. TA  will  be  provided  over  the medium term  (3\u20135  years) for  PIC-11 reform \npriorities.  Reform  dialogue  will  include  sector  planning  (road  maps  and  grid \nintegration studies), power utility management reform, tariff review and reform, and \nregulatory and policy framework reform. \nCoordinated reform agendas. The facility will document reform priorities in each \nparticipating PIC-11 and hold workshops with development partners to promote a \nuniform understanding on proposed reform pathways. \nSupport  for  regional  initiatives.  The  facility  will  support  targeted  regional \ninitiatives,  which  support  sector  reforms  outlined  in  the  FAESP,  and  the \nestablishment of an energy regulators association. \nSharing of lessons learned. The facility offers enhanced opportunities for sharing \nof lessons learned among the PIC-11. This will be facilitated by the regional facility \nsupport  unit  (FSU)  and  enhanced  through  regional  workshops  and  knowledge \nproducts. \n\n \n28. \n\nThe facility will support private sector investments through the following: \n(i) \n\nSystematic  screening.  Opportunities  for  IPPs  will  be  systematically  screened \nacross all participating PIC-11. This will include targeting sovereign financing on \ninfrastructure to accommodate private sector investment. \nBundling  of  procurement.  Opportunities  will  be  explored  for  bundling  of \nprocurement across the PIC-11 to increase contract size and attract new investors \nand  contractors  to  the  PIC-11.  Bundling  across  the  PIC-11  may  be  particularly \nuseful for IPPs and engineering, procurement, and construction contractors. \nOutreach.  Outreach  will  be  conducted  across  the  PIC-11  to  encourage  private \nsector investment to the region by supporting regional events such as the Pacific \nEnergy  Investors  Forum  (held  during  the  Pacific  Power  Association  Annual \nConference)  and  developing  outreach  tools  to  reach  potential  investors. \nConducting regional outreach encourages investors to view the Pacific as a single \nregion, rather than a series of small individual countries. \nRegional  guarantee  fund.  Options  for  a  regional  guarantee  facility  will  be \nexplored to reduce payment risk for IPPs, lower their cost of capital, and ultimately \nlower the negotiated off-take tariffs, which will benefit the PIC-11. \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nD. \n \n29. \nThe facility will finance renewable energy projects with an overall estimated cost of $750 \nmillion, including an estimated $500 million from cofinancing sources and an estimated $50 million \nfrom government counterpart financing. ADB financing is up to $200 million and is estimated to \nconsist  of  an  approximately  $10  million  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  regular  ordinary  capital  resources, \napproximately  $110  million  in  loans  from  ADB\u2019s  concessional  ordinary  capital  resources,  and \napproximately  $80  million  in  grants  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development \nFund).  In  addition,  the  facility  will  leverage  private  sector  investment  through  sector  reform, \ncapacity building and targeted sovereign investments. Specific project allocations will be subject \nto country performance-based allocations and country-specific programming discussions, subject \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fto the $200 million maximum for the facility across all PIC-11 countries. The summary financing \nplan  is  in  Table  1.  Detailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  will  be \nincluded in the project administration manual for each individual project. Climate mitigation and \nadaptation  costs  will  be  estimated  during  project  preparation  and  also  detailed  in  the  project \nadministration  manual  for  each  project.  Cofinancing  allocations  are  indicative  only  and  will  be \nconfirmed prior to project approval. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Banka.  \n\nOrdinary capital resources (regular loans) \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loans) \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund \ngrants) \nCofinancing b.  \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n\n \n10.0 \n110.0 \n\n80.0 \n500.0 \n50.0 \n750.0 \n\n \n1.3 \n14.7 \n\n10.7 \n66.7 \n6.6 \n100.0 \n\na. The breakdown between financing sources is an estimate.  \nb. Estimate based on current cofinancing projections. Cofinancing will be developed and reported on a per project \n\nbasis. Cofinancing and government contributions may exceed estimates in Table 1.   \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nE. \n \n30. \nThe implementation period for the facility will be over an 8-year period from July 2017 to \nJuly 2025. ADB will receive funding proposals over a 5-year period from July 2017 to July 2022. \nThe deadline for the final approval of the funding proposals under the facility will be 29 July 2022.16 \nThe  facility  will  delegate  approval  of  individual  project  financing  to  ADB  Management  of  up  to \n$200  million  in  cumulative  ADB  financing,  in  accordance  with  established  eligibility  criteria. \nMultiple projects in a single country may be approved. There is no financing cap on an individual \ncountry within the cumulative approval threshold. Additional financing may be included under the \nfacility. Regional projects may also be considered across multiple PIC-11 countries. There will be \nno limit for cofinancing or government contributions. \n \n31. \nIt is proposed that the Board delegate approval to the President for loans and/or grants to \neach PIC for qualifying projects under the facility. Project qualifying criteria consist of the following: \nproject scope includes renewable energy generation and supporting energy sector \ninfrastructure,17 \nproject is in one of the PIC-11, \nproject  is  included  in  national  energy  sector  planning  documents  as  a  priority \ninvestment, and \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n                                                \n16 The period between final approval of funding proposals (29 July 2022) and the end of the implementation period of \nthe facility (July 2015) is considered sufficient for final project implementation. However, should implementation of \nthe final project require additional time, the implementation period for the facility may be extended to cover the final \nproject\u2019s implementation. \n\n17 Supporting infrastructure includes the required power sector infrastructure to maintain grid operation. This includes, \nbut  is  not  limited  to,  transmission  and  distribution  assets,  diesel  generation  rehabilitation  and  upgrades,  and \nrehabilitation of tank farm assets. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\nenvironment category A projects are excluded in general.18 \n\n \n32. \nThe President will consider and, if appropriate, approve the financing of each qualifying \nproject based on a facility financing proposal.19 The format of the facility financing proposal will \nbe the same as that of the report and recommendation of the President for a sovereign project. \nProject processing and due diligence will be carried out following existing operations manuals and \nstaff instructions, primarily for stand-alone projects.20 \n  \nThe facility financing proposal for each project will be disclosed to the public in accordance \n33. \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  2011.  ADB  will  report  progress  on  facility \nimplementation  annually  to the  Board.  Prior  to  31  July  2020  or  when  50%  of  the  $200  million \napproval limit has been utilized, whichever occurs first, ADB will conduct an interim review of the \nfacility and report to the Board, including recommendations for design modifications (if any). \n \n34. \nAn FSU will be established in ADB headquarters to support the design and implementation \nof the facility, including preparation of projects. The FSU will include consultants financed by the \nregional project preparatory TA. Project implementation units (PIUs) will be established within the \nimplementing agencies in each participating country. In support of project preparation, the FSU \nwill  (i)  oversee  the  consulting firm(s); (ii)  support  the  national  PIUs,  including  in the sharing  of \nlessons learned between PIUs; (iii) provide independent technical review of feasibility and detailed \ndesign;  (iv)  monitor  and  report  on  processing  and  implementation  progress;  and  (v)  support \nenergy sector reform, including (a) sector planning (road maps and grid integration studies), (b) \npower utility management reform and capacity building, (c)  tariff review  and reform, (d) review \nand  revision  of  regulatory  and  policy  frameworks,  and  (e)  promotion  of  the  private  sector,  as \nappropriate.  A  project  steering  committee  will  oversee  implementation,  monitor  progress,  and \nprovide guidance to the executing agency in each participating country. \n \n35. \nFor  projects  where  ADB  will  be  administering  cofinancing  resources,  universal \nprocurement will apply.21 Retroactive financing and/or advance contracting will be considered on \na project-by-project basis. The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \n \n36. \nPreparation of the initial projects under the facility will be supported through a regional TA \n(footnote  8).  This  TA  will  be  expanded  to  cover  preparation  of  the  subsequent  projects.22 The \nregional TA will support (i) project preparation, including due diligence and feasibility studies; and \n(ii)  implementation,  consisting  of  detailed  design  and  project  procurement.  Construction \nsupervision  will  be  supported  under  the  individual  projects.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \n\n                                                \n18 In the event that there is an environment category A project, a paper will be submitted to the Board for its decision \nwhether to authorize the President to approve the financing for the project. This is similar to the approach for MFF \nsecond or subsequent tranches that are environment category A. \n\n19 The  format  for  the  facility  financing  proposal  will  follow  the  format  for  the  sovereign  project  loan  report  and \n\nrecommendation of the President. \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n20 Specific processing procedures are described in the Project Processing Flowchart (accessible from the list of linked \n\n21 ADB.  2013.

With  the  exception  of  project  concept  clearance,  the  procedures  for  financing  projects \nunder  the  facility  will  follow  those  for  the  processing  of  stand-alone  or  sector  projects.  Due \ndiligence will be carried out on each project in accordance with ADB policies and procedures, and \nthe results of the due diligence summarized in the facility financing proposals. Due diligence will \ninclude  technical,  economic,  financial,  governance  (including  financial  management  risk \ncategorization), integrity, gender, and climate change impacts. Innovative technical solutions will \nbe incorporated, where appropriate.23 A risk management assessment and risk management plan \nwill be prepared for each project. For safeguards due diligence, each project will be screened and \ncategorized  separately  at  the  outset  of  project  preparation  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples,  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009).  The  safeguard  categorization  will  subsequently  guide  the  preparation  of  appropriate \nsafeguard assessment documentation. The facility is expected to support mainly category B and \nC projects.24  \n \n\nIV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n38. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  Pacific  Renewable  Energy  Investment  Facility  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and  recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  Pacific  Renewable  Energy  Investment  Facility  in  an  aggregate  principal \namount not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000,000; and \nthe delegation of authority to the President for approval of the loans and/or grants \nunder the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility as described in paragraph \n30 of this report. \n\n30 May 2017 \n\n \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n23 Innovative solutions may include micro-grids and energy management systems. \n24 See footnote 18 on the approach to projects that are classified as category A for environmental impact. \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \nUtilities do not maintain \nsufficient technical staff \nto operate and maintain \nrenewable facilities. \n\nExtended droughts \naffect hydropower \nutilization. \n\nPIC-11 do not maintain \ncommitment to reform. \n\nChanges in the political \nlandscape negatively \naffect commitments of \nthe project cofinancier. \n\n \nImpact the Facility is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nRegional energy security in the Pacific is improved (Framework for Action on Energy Security in the \nPacific, 2010\u20132020)a  \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nGeneration of lower-\ncost and cleaner \nenergy increased \n\nOutputs \n \n1.
