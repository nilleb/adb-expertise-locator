The \nGovernment\u2019s new initiative, a sector-wide approach (SWAp) to trade, \naims to sustain economic growth by diversifying the country\u2019s currently \nnarrow economic base of garments, tourism, and construction. Private \nsector expansion is considered key to achieving these objectives.  \nCambodia\u2019s poverty rate has declined in the past two decades from \n69.0% of the population living below $2 a day in 1996 to a projected \n50.5% in 2007. And, using the national poverty line based on daily \ncalorie intake, the incidence of poverty has declined from 47% in 1994 \nto 35% in 2004\u2014a remarkable reduction considering this period\u2019s rapid \npopulation growth. The decline was driven by economic expansion, \nopening  the  economy  to  trade  and  investment,  increased  rice \nproduction, and greater urbanization. In fact, it is common to see a \nsharp reduction in poverty once a country passes a per capita income \nthreshold of $400, as Cambodia did in 2005. Achieving further poverty \nreduction will depend on sustaining economic growth rate of 7.5% per \nyear over the medium term by diversifying the country\u2019s economy and \nmobilizing additional fiscal resources to support long-term development \nand social spending objectives.  \n ", " ii       \n \nThe country strategy and program (CSP) for 2005\u20132009 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) identifies private sector development as a \nkey  priority  for  Cambodia.  It  emphasizes  that  ADB  will  help  the \nGovernment  to  improve  Cambodia\u2019s  climate  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  through  technical  and  program  support  for  policy, \ninstitutional, and regulatory reform in key sectors. The CSP seeks to \ntransform the agriculture sector from subsistence farming to a more \ncommercial  orientation,  improve  basic  transport  and  power \ninfrastructure,  strengthen  the  regulatory  regime  governing  financial \ninstitutions, develop small and medium-sized enterprises, and promote \ngreater regional integration through ADB\u2019s Greater Mekong Subregion \nProgram. Linked to private sector development is good governance \nthrough promoting competition policy, which suggests that the reform \nagenda should be broad-based and focused on reducing transaction \ncosts of doing business and improving predictability in the investment \nclimate. Reforms supporting and strengthening the investment climate, \ncompetition policy, and better access to technology; completing the \nunfinished  trade  policy  regime;  and  enhancing  trade  facilitation \nmeasures  and  macroeconomic  stability  in  support  of  private  sector \ngrowth are also important for reducing transaction costs and expanding \nand diversifying the private sector.  \nThe Government has implemented a series of reform measures for the \ninvestment  climate  and  trade  aimed  at  reducing  the  cost  of  doing \nbusiness  in  Cambodia,  including  customs  reforms  and  other  trade \nfacilitation measures. Business climate reforms undertaken in the last 2 \nyears\u2014many  accomplished  through  ADB\u2019s  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprise Development Program\u2014have also helped Cambodia to move \nup  15  places  in  the  International  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  2008  Doing \nBusiness rankings. The Government is also committed to completing its \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) commitments, which influence how \nCambodia thinks about its business climate and trade policy over the \nmedium term. At the same time, the Government has introduced more \nprudent fiscal policies to address the surge in domestic inflation caused \nby supply-side developments in global oil and food markets.  \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the PED Program will be an expanded and diversified \nOutcome  private sector. The outcome of the PED Program will be an improved \nbusiness environment where the private sector operates efficiently and \neffectively. \n \nThe PED Program includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the \npriorities of the National Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010  and \nits trade development agenda (SWAp) and are designed to (i) maintain \nmacroeconomic stability necessary for private sector development and \ngrowth by continuing to make progress toward price stability through \nprudent  fiscal  policy;  (ii)  improve  the  investment  climate  by \nstrengthening  investor  protection,  enhancing  the  environment  for \ncompetition and innovation, and institutionalizing a regulatory impact \nassessment within the Government and other policy reforms aimed at \nreducing transaction costs and risks in Cambodia; and (iii) improve \n ", "    iii\ntrade policy and facilitation by continuing reforms to meet WTO legal \nrequirements,  renewing  trade  policy  reforms,  and  enhancing  trade \nfacilitation by strengthening SPS management systems and customs \nreforms. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $20 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) will be provided for subprogram 1 of the PED Program with terms \nof 24 years, an 8-year grace period, 1.0% interest rate during the grace \nperiod, and 1.5% during amortization and other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement. A capacity development project \nfinanced  by  a  $2  million  grant,  financed  under  ADB\u2019s  ADF,  will  be \nprovided to strengthen SPS management systems under the program \ncluster.  \n   \nPeriod and  The  PED  Program  implementation  period  is  from  June  2007  to \nTranching  December  2012.  The  subprogram  1  period  is  from  June  2007  to \nDecember  2008,  with  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $20  million  to  be \ndisbursed  under  subprogram  1  when  the  Government  has  met  the \nconditions  for  effectiveness.  Policy  measures  for  subprogram  2  are \nsubject to revision and refinement following ADB\u2019s assessment of the \nmacroeconomic environment, changes in the external environment, and \nlessons  learned  from  implementing  subprogram  1.  Subprogram  2, \ncurrently estimated at $15 million, will be presented for ADB Board of \nDirectors\u2019  consideration  approximately  24  months  after  the \neffectiveness of subprogram 1, subject to the Government\u2019s readiness \nto  continue  with  its  reform  agenda.  Subprogram  3,  also  currently \nestimated at $15 million, will be submitted for the Board\u2019s consideration \napproximately  24  months  after  the  effectiveness  of  subprogram  2 \n(about  October  2012),  subject  to  the  Government\u2019s  readiness  to \ncontinue  with  its  reform  agenda.  The  starting  period  of  2007  was \nselected as it reflects the period of ADB\u2019s engagement and dialogue \nwith the Government on business climate reforms embedded in the \nPED Program.  \n \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use local currency counterpart funds generated by \nthe loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and associated costs \nof reform and to help maintain current levels of social expenditure. \n   \nExecuting Agency   The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) will be responsible for coordinating \nthe implementation of and sustaining the PED Program reform actions. \n   \nImplementation  The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) and Ministry of \nArrangements  Economy and Finance (MEF) are the implementing agencies. MOC will \nuse its Private Sector Development Sub-Steering Committee on Trade \nDevelopment and Trade-Related Investments (PSC), chaired by the \nminister of commerce and comprising senior officials from MIME and \nMEF to steer the program. The PSC will meet quarterly to monitor \nprogress and oversee the implementation of the PED Program, and \nprovide  guidance  and  direction  to  the  Executing  Agency  and \nimplementing agencies.  \n   \n ", " iv       \n \nProcurement   The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \nProgram Benefits  The PED Program will provide the following benefits: \nand Beneficiaries   \n(i)  Lowered transaction costs for businesses by reducing red tape, \nand  customs  reforms,  which  will  open  new  opportunities, \nincrease trade, investment and productivity, boost the economy, \nincrease incomes, and create jobs. The institutionalization of a \nregulatory  impact  assessment  will  improve  transparency  and \naccountability.  \n(ii)  Strengthened  institutional  development  by  improving  the \ncapabilities of the executing and implementing agencies to carry \nout  trade  and  competition  policy  analysis  with  the  aim  of \nupgrading the quality of policy and institutional processes for \npolicy making. \n(iii)  Upgraded  agro-based  products  and  improved  market  access \nthrough effective SPS management systems. These systems \nwill also increase food safety for the booming tourism sector and \nthe population. \n(iv)  Improved  private  sector  capacity  in  SPS  and  other  related \ntechnologies through grant projects, which will also improve firm \ncompetitiveness. \n(v)  Maintained  stable  macroeconomy  through  continued  prudent \nfiscal policy. \n \nADB staff estimates, based on simulations from the PED Program\u2019s \nCambodian  economy  model,  suggest  that  gains  from  PED  reforms \ncould add 2.4% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product, equivalent to \nabout $200 million in 2007 prices. Employment is expected to rise by \n4.3% for males and 6.3% for females. Poverty is expected to fall by \n2.7%.  \n   \nRisks and  The assumptions underlying the PED Program include the following.  \nAssumptions   \n(i)  The economy will be able to maintain macroeconomic stability \nand withstand current external and domestic shocks.  \n(ii)  The Government will stay on course with key business climate \npolicy reform measures and fiscal consolidation.  \n \nThe risks include the following. \n \n(i)  In  transitional  economies,  maintaining  macroeconomic \nstability\u2014as reflected, for example, in low inflation\u2014is crucial for \ninvestor confidence and private sector growth. Cambodia will be \nparticularly vulnerable to macroeconomic instability in 2008 and \n2009 due to the recent surge in inflation ignited by supply side \ndevelopments in the global commodity and food markets, the \nglobal financial crisis that may slow foreign direct investment \n ", "    v\ninflows  to  Cambodia  and  the  expected  United  States  and \nEuropean  economic  recessions  that  will  hurt  Cambodian \nmerchandise  exports  to  these  markets.  In  addition,  over  the \nlonger  term  Cambodia  will  face  emerging  fiscal  and \nmacroeconomic  challenges  in  the  context  of  its  anticipated \nresource  boom  and  associated  volatile  commodity  prices. \nRecognizing these risks, the Government is undertaking fiscal \nand  monetary  policy  measures  to  maintain  macroeconomic \nstability,  implementing  programs  to  assist  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  from  these  shocks,  and  undertaking  measures  to \nstrengthen  public  expenditure  management  using  assistance \nfrom its development partners, including ADB. \n(ii)  There may be weak coordination among Government agencies \nleading  to  delayed  compliance  with  policy  measures  and \ncapacity development, but the adoption of the cluster mode for \npolicy  lending  has  reduced  this  risk.  By  basing  financial \nassistance  and  TA  on  completed  actions  derived  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform program, the PED Program strengthens \nthe  Government\u2019s  ownership  of  the  reform  program.  By \nincluding policy triggers for subsequent subprograms, the PED \nProgram  offers  the  flexibility  needed  to  take  into  account \nchanges in the external environment faced by Cambodia and \nemerging priority policy reforms. Moreover, the Government has \ntaken  a  clear  stance  on  the  need  for  policy  adjustment  to \ndiversify the economy, as articulated in its trade development \nagenda. \n(iii)  Agencies\u2019 capacity to implement reforms may be constrained by \nresources  and  other  emerging  priorities.  The  PED  Program \nreduces this risk by limiting the policy triggers to a few high-\npriority, high-impact policy reforms under the jurisdiction of MOC \nand MIME and by attaching TA to each policy trigger.  \n(iv)  Vested  interests  will  resist some of  the  reforms.  Reforms  to \ncustoms  and  institutionalization  of  economic  governance \nreforms (e.g., regulatory impact assessment) are likely to be \nlengthy. However, several factors mitigate these risks. First, the \nPED  Program\u2019s  strategic  approach  is  to  focus  efforts  on \nsupporting the Government\u2019s initiatives and building on existing \ninstitutions. Second, reforms will focus on areas with political will \nand some measure of capacity. This has been demonstrated by \nMOC, which has championed trade reforms and lead the WTO \naccession process. \n   \nCapacity  The  proposed  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary  Standards  Management \nDevelopment Grant  Systems Project, to be financed under an ADF grant of $2 million, will \nsupport  strengthening  the  institutional  framework  for  effective \nmanagement systems, regulatory reform, capacity development, and \npublic awareness. \n \nCore tasks under the proposed project include capacity development at \nthe  Institute  of  Standards  of  Cambodia  to  produce  WTO-compliant \nstandards,  obtain  international  accreditation  as  a  conformity \n ", " vi       \n \nassessment  body  with  the  International  Organization  for \nStandardization, obtain International Organization for Standardization \naccreditation for SPS-related laboratories, support commercialization of \nthe Institute of Standards of Cambodia and selected laboratories, train \nstaff and assessors, and procure equipment. \n \nThe project is scheduled to commence in April 2009 and be completed \nby March 2012, with an expected closing date of September 2012.  A \nteam of international and national consultants will implement the project \ncomponents. On behalf of the Government, a consulting firm will be \nselected  and  administered  by  ADB  to  implement  the  project,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). An estimated total of 58 person-months \n(48  international  and  10  national)  will  be  required  to  include  six \ninternational consultants and one national consultant. Equipment will be \nprocured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  objectives, \nscope, cost and financing, and project components and implementation \narrangements are in section V. \n \nExecuting Agency  MIME will be responsible for coordinating project implementation. The \nExecuting Agency will (i) coordinate project implementation with the \nImplementing Agency, (ii) carry out administrative and fiduciary support, \nand (iii) support both Government and ADB reporting requirements on \nthe progress and use of the project funds. \n \nImplementing  MOC  is  the  Implementing  Agency  for  SPS-related  activities  of  its \narrangements  standards agency Camcontrol.  \n \nTechnical  An $800,000 proposed policy and advisory TA project, funded by the \nAssistance   Technical Assistance Special Fund, will support the PED Program.  \n \nThe TA grant, Enhancing Private Sector Competitiveness, will support \nthe implementation of the triggers for subprogram 2 and provide the \nGovernment with timely policy advice on a demand basis. The TA\u2019s \nobjective is to assist the Government in finding practical solutions to \naddress these issues, as well as to deepen the Government\u2019s agenda \nin  the  investment  and  trade  area  under  the  TA,  which  has  five \ncomponents. Component 1 will support trade policy and competition \npolicy capacity development at MOC, including assisting in capacity \ndevelopment  of  its  new  WTO  Notification  and  Legal  Compliance \nDepartment  that  will  develop  internal  procedures  for  notification, \nprepare WTO\u2019s trade policy review, and provide trade policy analysis; \ndevelop trade remedies guidelines and procedures; and facilitate the \nestablishment  and  adoption  of  a  competition  policy  framework.  The \ncomponent  will  also  assist  MOC  roll  out  its  enterprise  registry  to \nselected  provinces.  Component  2  will  support  MOC  and  MIME  in \nimplementing  action  plans  for  regulatory  impact  assessment  and \nstrengthening capacity at the legislative review unit at the Council of \nMinisters. Component 3 will assist MIME in developing a technology \npolicy  framework.  Component  4  will  support  MEF  in  developing  a \n ", "    vii\nframework for double taxation agreements and advocating its adoption \nas part of the Government\u2019s investment promotion regime. Component \n5  will  work  with  the  Customs  &  Excise  Department  to  complete \nimplementation of transaction values, strengthen capacity at the risk \nmanagement unit, and undertake a study on Cambodia\u2019s readiness to \njoin the Kyoto Convention. \n \nMOC will be the Executing Agency for the project. The TA is scheduled \nto commence in April 2009 and be completed by October 2010. A team \nof  international  and  national  consultants  will  implement  the  project \ncomponents.  A  total  of  63  person-months  (26  international  and  37 \nnational) will be required, featuring six international consultants and four \nnational consultants.  \n \n \n ", "", "   \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nProgram to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Promoting Economic Diversification Program (PED \nProgram)  for  $52.0  million  comprising  three  subprograms,  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  of  Special \nDrawing Rights 13,419,000 (equivalent to $20.0 million) for subprogram 1 of the Program, and \n(iii)  a  proposed  grant  of  $2  million  for  capacity  development  to  strengthen  sanitary  and \nphytosanitary  standards  (SPS)  management  systems.  This  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for improving competitiveness of the private sector. If the Board \napproves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Cambodia\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Plan \n2.  In 2004, the Government announced its long-term development strategy\u2014known as the \nRectangular Strategy\u2014that focuses on better governance and institutional building, including \nanticorruption measures and public administrative reforms. One component concentrates on \npromoting  economic  growth  through  agriculture,  infrastructure,  and  private  sector  growth; \nemployment;  and  human  resource  development.  In  2006,  the  Government  announced  its \nsecond  5-year  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  (NSDP),1 which  aims  to \noperationalize  the  Rectangular  Strategy  and  achieve  interim  targets  in  2010.  While  the \nRectangular  Strategy  focuses  more  on  the  identification  of  crosscutting  policy  issues  and \nstrategies  to  ensure  a  more  integrated  development  policy  framework,  the  NSDP \noperationalizes it with programs, projects, and development targets (Figure 1).  \n \n3.  To help implement the priorities and programs of the Rectangular Strategy and the \nNSDP,  the  Government  has  adopted  several  sector  strategies,  most  with  time  bound \nimplementation  plans  and  clearly  defined  ministerial  responsibilities,  of  which  some  are \nsupported  by  ADB  sector  programs  and  TA.  The  anchor  for  the  Promoting  Economic \nDiversification Program is the Government\u2019s trade development agenda known as its sector-\nwide approach (SWAp) to trade, underpinned by a diagnostic trade integration study (DTIS) that \nwas launched by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) on 5 December 2007. The SWAp supports \nexpanding  the  private sector  by  improving  both  foreign and  domestic  trade  by  developing \nefficient backward links in the economy.2 It identifies 19 products as pilot projects for catalyzing \na broad-based reform agenda, while at the same time recognizing the necessity for specific \nreforms and capacity-building initiatives in some sectors. The SWAp is a new initiative built on \nthree pillars: (i) crosscutting issues (SPS and trade policy formulation), (ii) capacity development \nin trade, and (iii) product development (i.e., the 19 products). The SWAp is coordinated by MOC \nthrough the Private Sector Development Sub-Steering Committee on Trade Development and \nTrade-related Investments (PSC) with the aim of mainstreaming trade in economic policy.

The Private Sector Development Steering Committee has sub-steering committees on \nmanufacturing and small and medium-sized enterprise development, investment climate and \nprivate participation in infrastructure, and trade development and trade-related investments \n(PSC). It provides the opportunity for an ongoing dialogue\u2014involving the Government, private \nsector, international development partners, civil society, and the academic community\u2014 on the \neconomic reform agenda and ways donors can assist with implementation. The PSC also allows \ndevelopment partners to enhance their policy engagement with the Government and to drive \nforward  the  NSDP  and  SWAp.3 The  PED  Program  will  be  anchored  in  the  SWAp  and \ncoordinated by MOC through the PSC, which avoids the establishment of an additional forum. \nThe PED Program will focus on the following core policy areas identified in the SWAp and the \nDTIS: (i) SPS, trade policy capacity, and trade facilitation measures related to customs; and (ii) \ninvestment  climate (regulatory reform, competition policy, and innovation policy). The PED \nProgram will also support the Government\u2019s efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability given \nthe  need  for  economic  diversification,  the  external  environment\u2019s  recent  shocks,  and  their \nimpact on Cambodia (para. 15). \n \nB.  Government\u2019s Partnership with ADB \n \n5.  The PED Program will support the Government\u2019s private sector development agenda, \nincluding institutional capacity development, as highlighted in the development policy letter \naddressed to the President of ADB (Appendix 2). This agenda includes (i) macroeconomic \nstability for private sector development and growth; (ii) investment climate, competition policy, \nand innovation policy; and (iii) trade policy and trade facilitation (Figure 2). The close alignment \nbetween  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  and  the  PED  Program  will  strengthen  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to the reforms under the program.  \n \n6.  Key features of the PED Program include (i) a series of single-tranche operations with a \nwell-defined, medium-term framework cluster specified at the outset, including completed high-\nimpact reforms before Board consideration; (ii) triggers for subsequent subprograms to ensure \ncontinual dialogue among the Government, ADB, and stakeholders; and (iii) a small number of \nwell-targeted policy actions designed to achieve high-impact outcomes in priority areas and to \nstrengthen institutional capacity with attention to positive outcomes for trade facilitation and \nefficient  private  sector  development  and  growth.  A  new  innovative  feature  of  the  cluster \napproach is linking of a set of TA projects to prior policy triggers or milestones to ensure \ngovernment  ownership  and  a  policy  environment  necessary  for  successful  project \nimplementation. For example, the matching grants project for SME access to SPS technology \nunder  subprogram  3  will  be  triggered  by  the  successful  endorsement  of  a  market-friendly \ntechnology and innovation policy under subprogram 2.  \n \n7.  The PED Program has the following three phases. \n \n8.  Subprogram 1 lays out the regulatory and strategic frameworks for priority private \nsector areas. One example, MOC\u2019s new Department of Notification and Legal Compliance, \nalso known as the World Trade Organization (WTO) Department, will review new regulations for \nconsistency with Cambodia\u2019s WTO commitments. Subprogram 1 will also focus on maintaining \nmacroeconomic stability through prudent fiscal policy and will establish the basis for continual \npolicy dialogue and engagement during 2009\u20132012 (subprograms 2 and 3).  \n                                                 \n3  In addition, the Government and private sector have established the Government-Private Sector Forum facilitated \nby the International Finance Corporation, which meets twice a year and provides the private sector with a voice on \npolicy and regulatory issues. This forum has eight working groups. \n ", "4   \n9.  Subprogram  2  will  focus  on  institutional  capacity  development  for  delivering \npublic services to the private sector. Under this subprogram, government laboratories will be \nprepared for commercialization, and a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) mechanism will be \nimplemented  on  an  experimental  basis  in  MIME  and  MOC  for  better  regulation-making. \nTechnical assistance will also be provided to strengthen capacity of the legislative review unit \nhoused the Council of Ministers. Further, subprogram 2 will address key risks identified in \nsubprogram 1, as well as make progress in other areas that emerge from policy dialogue. The \nexpected time frame for processing subprogram 2 is 2 years after subprogram 1 becomes \neffective. Subprogram 2 contains 9 policy triggers to provide the flexibility needed to respond to \nunanticipated changes in the external environment by framing an appropriate policy response, \nwhich will ensure the PED Program is synchronized with the Government\u2019s policy agenda in an \nenvironment of rapidly changing policy priorities. \n \n10.  Subprogram 3 will increase focus on capacity development of the private sector to \nimprove competitiveness. One example is the proposed matching grants project for SME \naccess to SPS technology. The expected time frame for processing subprogram 3 is 2 years \nafter subprogram 2 becomes effective. Subprogram 3 contains 10 policy triggers that may also \nbe  reformulated  during  subprogram  2  to  reflect  progress,  new  priorities,  and  external \ndevelopments.  \n \n11.  Country Strategy and Program. Private sector development is a theme of the country \nstrategy and program for 2005\u201320094 and the country operations business plan for 2007\u20132009.5 \nThe country strategy and program emphasizes that ADB will help the Government to improve \nthe climate for private sector development through policy, institutional, and regulatory reform in \nkey sectors. It seeks to transform the agriculture sector from subsistence farming to a more \ncommercial  orientation,  improve  basic  transport  and  power  infrastructure,  strengthen  the \nregulatory regime governing financial institutions, develop SMEs, and promote greater regional \nintegration through ADB\u2019s Greater Mekong Subregion Program. The PED Program is designed \nso that it complements ADB\u2019s other private sector development-related sector loans and grant \nprograms and projects, such as the Financial Sector Development Program 2 (FSDP 2) and the \nproposed Public Financial Management for Rural Development (PFMRD) Project, to increase \nsynergies for private sector benefits. The FSDP 2 aims to make the financial sector an efficient \nvehicle for mobilizing resources and broadening access to financing for the private sector and \naddresses the supply side of access to finance from the private sector. The PED Program \naddresses the demand side for finance through improving the environment for private sector \ngrowth and economic diversification. It also focuses on reforms and capacity development to \npromote economic diversification, including rural development through investment and trade \nfacilitation reforms. The PFMRD will roll out public expenditure reforms in rural development \nministries  to  support  anticipated  increases  in  public  capital  spending  in  these sectors  and \neconomic diversification. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2007.

The PED Program is second-generation ADB support for development of Cambodia\u2019s \nprivate sector. ADB\u2019s engagement with the Government on private sector development issues \nbegan with the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Program (SMEDP) in 2004, \nand subsequent advisory TA projects and ADB missions. Under the SMEDP, the Government \ncreated an SME development strategy that coordinated partners on SME issues, reformed \nregistration procedures, and modernized the SME registry, resulting in a six-fold increase in \nannual registrations in Phnom Penh in 2006 (Appendix 4). It also improved SMEs\u2019 access to \nfinance,  such  as  by  establishing  the  credit  information  bureau.  These  reforms  directly \ncontributed to Cambodia\u2019s improved performance in the International Finance Corporation\u2019s \n2008  Doing  Business  report,  increasing  its  global  ranking  by  15  places.  Moreover,  ADB \nprovides input on private sector development policy discussions through the PSD-SC and is the \nled donor for coordinating SPS, a major activity of the trade facilitation subcommittee. ADB has \nbeen actively engaged with Greater Mekong Subregion member states on promoting trade \nfacilitation covering SPS, customs, logistics, and business mobility at the regional level. In \naddition, ADB has been actively engaged in dialogue with the Government on macroeconomic \npolicy issues, e.g., under the FSDP 2, an ongoing dialogue with the National Bank of Cambodia \nis focusing on monetary and banking policy. Under the PED Program, a fiscal policy dialogue \nwith the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) intensified in the third quarter of 2006 when \npreparations for the program began.  \n \n14.  Other Development Partners and Stakeholders. The PED Program will coordinate \nclosely  with  other  development  partners  such  as  the  European  Commission,  International \nFinance  Corporation,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  Nations  Industrial \nDevelopment Organization, United States Agency for International Development, World Bank, \nWorld  Trade  Organization,  and  other  stakeholders  providing  support  for  private  sector \ndevelopment in Cambodia (Appendix 3). \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Review of the Economy, Investment Climate, and Poverty \n \n15.  Sustained Economic Growth in 2007. After a decade of respectable growth averaging \n7.5%, Cambodia\u2019s economy accelerated more than 10% in 2004 and sustained double-digit \nexpansion through 2007 (Table 1). This robust growth was driven by industry with particularly \nstrong performances by construction and garment making. Services were also strong, especially \ntourism, banking, and real estate.  Agriculture, which tends to be volatile, averaged 6% growth \nduring this period. However, exports soon slowed to an 11% growth rate in 2007, down from \n27% in 2006, primarily due to a sharp slowdown in garment exports. This slowdown continued \ninto 2008, with garment exports rising by 5%, the lowest rate of increase in several years. Two \nmillion people visited Cambodia in 2007\u2014a record\u2014generating an estimated $1.1 billion in \nrevenue and helping to fuel a construction boom in Siem Reap and other destinations. Visitor \narrivals are estimated to exceed two million in 2008. Foreign investment almost doubled in 2007 \nover 2006 levels ($900 million versus $475 million) with a substantial proportion reportedly \ninvested in real estate, contributing to the property price boom. Several major international \ncorporations in agroprocessing and chemicals have set up representative offices in Cambodia, \nindicative of some investment diversification beginning to occur. \n \n16.  Inflation Surged at the End of 2007. Cambodia has achieved rapid economic growth \nwith modest rates of inflation. Inflation averaged just below 4% per year between 2001 and early \n ", "    7\n2007, anchored by the United States (US) dollar and low US inflation.6 However, by the third \nquarter of 2007, domestic inflation began to surge, rising from 6.4% in September to 10.8% in \nDecember 2007 and to 25.7% by May 2008. Inflation pressure has begun to ease since June \nwith inflation in July at 22.3% on a year-on-year basis. Domestic inflation was ignited on the \nsupply  side  by  sharply  higher  global  prices  for  petroleum  and  food  earlier  this  year,  and \nexacerbated by the depreciation of the US dollar against Cambodia\u2019s major trading partners in \n2007. At the same time, there had been signs that the economy was overheating\u2014economic \ngrowth in 2007 was beginning to diverge above its potential growth path; private sector credit \nand broad money supply have expanded at unprecedented rates; and at the end of 2007, the \nbroad monetary aggregates were about 60% higher than levels 1 year before. Furthermore, \nexcess liquidity in the banking system is estimated at over 30% of deposits. Unprecedented \nmonetary  aggregate  growth  rates  in  a  hugely  inflationary  environment  increased  risks  of \nsecond-round  inflationary  effects  and  macroeconomic  instability.  The  National  Bank  of \nCambodia has responded by doubling the reserve requirement from 8% to 16% and relaxing \ncapital outflows by allowing, upon verification, commercial banks to invest their surplus reserves \nabroad where they can earn a higher rate of return. Growth in monetary aggregates slowed to \nabout 43% in the first semester of 2008 over the same period in 2007, indicating a lessening of \ninflationary pressures. \n \n17.  Prudent Fiscal Policy. The effectiveness of monetary policy is limited in a dollarized \neconomy like Cambodia, and must be supplemented with an appropriate fiscal policy stance\u2014\nfor example, accumulating domestic budget surpluses when strong inflation pressures emerge \nor when the economy shows signs of overheating. Accordingly, Cambodia\u2019s fiscal policy has \ntightened in recent years. The overall deficit narrowed significantly from over 7.0% of the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2002 to 2.8% in 2007, with improvement reflected in the current \nbalance  surplus,  i.e.,  current  expenditures  less  current  revenues.  Total  revenues  have \nexpanded steadily in relation to the GDP, with gains from all major tax components. On the side \nof expenditures, a period of consolidation ended in 2005; the following 2 years witnessed an \nincrease in spending of almost 1.5% of the GDP with both current and capital expenditures \nrising. The approved 2008 budget is relatively expansionary on paper as it projects a fall in the \ncurrent budget surplus from 3% in 2007 to 1% in 2008 and a small drop in government deposits \nat the National Bank of Cambodia. However, during the first half of 2008, government deposits \nrose over 30% and the annualized budget deficit fell to 0.4% of the GDP, suggesting that the \nactual outturn may be less expansionary (para. 20).  \n \n18.  Challenges to Sustaining Economic Growth in 2008 and 2009. Cambodia\u2019s economy \nin 2008 and 2009 will be vulnerable to three adverse developments in the external environment: \n(i) the financial global crisis may slow foreign direct investment inflows to Cambodia as investors \nwind back global investments due to the credit crunch in developed markets; (ii) the expected \ncontraction in the US and European economies in 2009 will affect the demand for Cambodian \nexports and visitors to Cambodia; and (iii) the unexpected surge in international food and oil \nprices earlier this year, contributed to higher domestic inflation in 2008, which is expected to \nslow household consumption and economic growth. ADB staff forecasts on economic growth \nsuggest that the increases in oil prices may cut the economic growth rate by as much as 3% in \n2008 due to Cambodia\u2019s higher fuel content in production costs. Economic growth could be \nlower in 2009. A recent International Monetary Fund report assessed the impact of global \ncommodity  prices  on  balance  of  payments  stability  by  simulating  the  effects  of  prices  on \n                                                 \n6  Cambodia is a highly dollarized economy with over 90% of deposits in the domestic banking system denominated \nin dollars. As a result, money and inflation conditions in Cambodia are influenced by money and inflation conditions \nin the US, as well as movements in the US dollar vis-\u00e0-vis Cambodia\u2019s trading partners. \n ", "8   \nchanges in foreign reserve coverage in months of imports (the lower the reserve coverage, the \ngreater risks of balance of payments problems).7 For Cambodia, it simulates that increases in \nfood  prices  actually  add  to  reserves,  as  the  country  is  a  net  exporter  of  rice  and  other \ncommodities, while fuel price increases lower reserve coverage by between 0.5 and 1.0 month \nof imports. Overall, reserve coverage falls just over 0.5 month of imports, leaving reserve \ncoverage  of  just  over  2.0  months  of  imports.  Conventionally,  at  least  3  months  of  import \ncoverage is considered a sufficient buffer against shocks. With the sharp decline in oil prices \nsince September 2008, inflationary pressures should ease over the next few months.  \n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators in Cambodia \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \n  Year \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nA.

Using the national poverty line based on a 2000 calorie intake per person, the incidence \nof poverty in Cambodia has declined from 47% in 1994 to 35% in 2004. Using the $2-a-day \npoverty line, the incidence of poverty is estimated to have fallen from 69.0% in 1996 to a \nprojected 50.5% in 2007.8 This compares with 62.3% of the population living below $2 a day in \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 32.9% in Viet Nam, 45.2% in Indonesia, and 44.9% in \nthe Philippines. Factors contributing to this remarkable reduction in poverty include sustained \nper capita income expansion, with poverty sharply falling after per capita income surpassed \n$400 in 2005; greater labor mobility between rural and urban areas (and urbanization); higher \nrice production; private sector expansion; and improvements in market access internally and to \nneighboring countries. Poverty in Cambodia is primarily a rural phenomenon, with the official \nrural  poverty  rate  at  39%  of  the  rural  population.  Moreover,  there  are  significant  regional \ndisparities in the incidence of poverty in Cambodia, with very low rates of poverty recorded in \nregions with higher per capita incomes (e.g., Phnom Penh, Kandal province, and Sihanoukville) \nand high rates in those with low per capita incomes (e.g., Kampong Speu, Kampong Thum, and \nSiem Reap). At the same time, income inequality has increased, as measured by the Gini \ncoefficient, from 0.35% in 1994 to 0.40% in 2004. The widening income gap between rural and \nurban  populations  and  within  rural  populations  contributed  to  this  increase.  Rising  income \ninequality is typical in the earlier stages of development in a low-income but fast-growing \neconomy  driven  by  urban  economic  growth.  ADB  staff  poverty  simulations  indicate  that \nCambodia could reach its Millennium Development Goal national poverty target of 24% of the \npopulation by 2015, depending on achieving an economic growth rate of 7.5% (or 5% per capita \nincome growth) per year from 2008 to 2015, low inflation in the range of 3% per year, and stable \nincome distribution. However, these variables have deteriorated in 2008, thus increasing the \nprobability that Cambodia may fall short of its target.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n20.  The challenge for Cambodia is to sustain a high economic growth rate, accelerate the \ncreation of productive jobs, and continue poverty reduction\u2014difficult tasks with half of the \npopulation under age 20 years and more than 85% employed in the informal sector. The \nGovernment recognizes that the key to sustaining high economic growth and poverty reduction \nis to diversify the sources of growth from its currently narrow base in construction, garment \nmaking, and tourism (Figure 3), which requires further reforms to improve competitiveness at all \nlevels of the supply chain (Appendix 4). Sustaining high economic growth over the longer term \nwill require export diversification as well as building links between agriculture and the modern \nsector. The Government believes that the private sector will be central to its diversification \nstrategy. Reforms to enhance competitiveness will require macroeconomic stability, institutional \nreforms to investment climate, competition policy, and enhanced trade facilitation measures. \n                                                 \n8  The $2-a-day poverty line is estimated using a basket of goods adjusted for differences in cost of living across \ncountries using 1993 prices. This allows for an international comparison of poverty rates.  \n ", "10   \n \n \nFigure 3: Distribution of Non-Agriculture GDP in 2002 and 2007 \n(%) \n100%\n80%\nConstruction\n60%\nTourism\nGarments\n40%\nOther no n-agricultural\n sectors\n20%\n0%\n2002 2007\n \n                     GDP = gross domestic product. \n Source: National Income Accounts, National Statistics Office. \n \n \n1.  Macroeconomic Stability for Private Sector Growth \n21.  A critical short-term issue affecting private sector growth is inflation. Over the \nlonger term, a potential challenge for the Government will be to improve conditions for growth of \nthe nonresource private sector in the event that Cambodia\u2019s oil reserves are proven to be large \nand lead to a substantial resource boom. Integral to maintaining this growth is macroeconomic \nstability. \n \n22.  Macroeconomic stability is being tested by the surge in domestic inflation that was \ninitially ignited by global food and oil price surges, and most recently, the possibility of emerging \nsecond-round effects. Authorities will need to supplement the recent tightening of monetary \npolicy with tighter fiscal policy to slow aggregate demand and inflation pressures. This will \nrequire continuing to operate sizeable current budget surpluses and accumulating government \ndeposits at the National Bank of Cambodia above its current level of 6% of GDP for 2008 \n(Figure 4). \n \n23.  A Future Oil Boom Could Impact Private Sector Development. The nonresource \nprivate sector will be influenced by future developments in the resource sector. While there are \nno definitive figures on Cambodia\u2019s proven oil reserves and timing of future production contracts \nand commercial operations, the Government anticipates significant future revenues from oil \nextraction  and  other  investments  in  the  mining  sector  in  the  form  of  taxes,  royalties,  and \ndividends.  Revenue  flows  would  provide  fiscal  space  and  a  tremendous  opportunity  for \nCambodia to finance its priority development goals, raise the per capita income, and reduce \npoverty, as earlier resource booms have done in Indonesia and Botswana. At the same, a \nresource boom of long duration can affect competitiveness of the nonresource tradable goods \nsectors (agriculture and garments) if it leads to an excessive appreciation of the real exchange \nrate\u2013\u2013i.e., where the appreciation cannot be justified on the basis of economy-wide productivity \ngrowth  and  investment.  There  are  important  lessons  to  be  learned  from  Indonesia  and \nBotswana in maintaining private sector growth when there is an oil boom, including maintaining \nfiscal discipline, smoothing out expenditures to avoid excessively inflationary effects of resource \nrevenues flows in the economy, and reforming the business climate and investments to raise \n ", "   11\nproductive capacity in the tradable goods sectors.9  \n \n \nFigure 4: Fiscal Performance \n(% of GDP)  \n \n20\n15\n10 Revenue\nExpenditure\n5 Current balance\nOverall balance\n0 Government deposits \n2003 2004 2005 206 2007\n-5\n-10\n \n  Sources: Budget documents, Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n \n24.  The Government is acutely aware of the necessity for a stable macroeconomy for private \nsector development. In this context, the Government is operating a prudent fiscal policy, and it \nhas tightened monetary policy and relaxed restrictions on banks holding deposits offshore to \nreduce excess liquidity in the domestic banking system. However, there are challenges to \nimproving fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Cambodia has one of the lowest tax \nrevenue to GDP ratios (about 10\u201311%) among low-income countries, partly because of the \ndominance of the subsistence agriculture sector in the economy. Revenue management is \nchallenged by (i) the dual tax system, with the estimated tax system undermining revenue \nmobilization;  (ii)  nontransparent  fiscal  incentives  regime;  and  (iii)  weak  tax  administration. \nRecent improvements in tax collection have helped address part of the problem of revenue \nmobilization, with revenues rising by 42% in 2007.  \n \n2.  Investment Climate \n25.  Investment Growth is concentrated in a few sectors. While investment in Cambodia \nhas shown robust growth in the last 4 years\u2014averaging 13% per year since 2003\u2014and the \ninvestment  to  GDP  rate  has  increased  from  19%  in  2003  to  21%  in  2007,  it  has  been \nconcentrated in a few sectors such as real estate, tourism, and until recently, garments. This \nreflects the concentrated economic base of the modern economy where these three sectors \nalone  account  for  42%  of  nonagriculture  GDP  (Figure  3).  While  there  has  been  some \ndiversification in the economy, much needs to be done to facilitate greater diversification and to \nachieve a higher investment rate.  \n \n26.  Investment Constraints. Several surveys and numerous value-chain studies10 highlight \na common set of policy and structural constraints facing investors in Cambodia. The major \nconstraints to investment in 2007 and 2008 involve the high cost of electricity, macroeconomic \ninstability, anticompetitive practices in the nontradable goods sector, red tape and regulatory \nuncertainty, inadequate skills of the labor force, limited access to technology and low innovative \nactivity, and costly trade facilitation. Results from the World Bank\u2019s 2007 Investment Climate \n                                                 \n9  International Monetary Fund. 2007. Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific. Washington, DC (Chapter 4). \n10  Value-chain studies attempt to identify policy, structural, and other bottlenecks at each stage of the production \nprocess of a commodity, e.g., from farmer to the port. Studies of this type are a useful diagnostic tool for identifying \nboth crosscutting issues as well as sector-specific development issues. \n ", "12   \nAssessment show that corruption, macroeconomic instability, anticompetitive practices, and \nregulatory uncertainty were the four major obstacles to business growth in 2007 (Figure 5). The \nsurvey  reported  that  about  30%  of  firms  said  regulatory  policy  uncertainty\u2014the  uneven \ninterpretation of laws and regulations\u2014and anticompetitive practices were severe constraints to \ntheir business. Investors also feel there has been improvement in other constraints, such as \nlower crime as well as progress in the legal system, customs, and tax administration. A 2006 \nUnited States Agency for International Development survey found that as a consequence of too \nmuch  regulation,  inspections  by  government  officials  also  appear  to  be  excessive.  Most \ninspections came from the tax, fire and building safety, and labor departments, followed by the \npolice and local authorities. Surveys have estimated that informal charges may amount to \nanywhere between 3% and 7% of business turnover, equivalent to a profit tax of between 10% \nand 20%. In this context, the Government will need to implement measures in several areas to \nincrease  private  investment,  such  as  improving  the  investment  climate  (e.g.,  by  lowering \nregulatory costs and improving investor protection), promoting competition in the nontradable \ngoods sectors, improving access to innovation and technology, and improving trade facilitation. \n \n \nFigure 5: Establishments Identifying Problem as \u201cMajor\u201d Obstacle to Growth \n(% of firms) \n60 \n50 \n40 \n30 \n20 \n10 \n0\n Corruption  Macroeconomic stability  Anti-competitive practices  Regulatory uncertainty  Electricity costs  Inadequate skills  Crime  Cost of finance  Red tape\n2007 2003\n \n                Source: World Bank Investment Climate Survey, 2003 and 2007. \n \n27.  Investor  Certainty  and  Protection.  In  2003,  the  Government  enacted  a  new \ninvestment law that provides broad investor protection and guarantees, a useful promotional \ntool.  However,  in  emerging  economies,  risks  are  greater,  so  investment  laws  are  often \nsupplemented  with  bilateral  investment  agreements  that  elaborate  investor  guarantees, \nprotection, and dispute resolution. Cambodia joined the World Bank\u2019s Multilateral Investment \nGuarantee  Agency  in  2000.  It  has  some  20  bilateral  investment  agreements  with  trading \npartners and is negotiating additional agreements with Algeria, Austria, Egypt, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Libya, Myanmar, Russian Federation, Ukraine, and United Kingdom.11 \n                                                 \n11 Cambodia has bilateral agreements on the promotion and protection of investments with People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, \nthe Netherlands, Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, \nPakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, US (Overseas Private Investment Corporation), and Viet \nNam. They provide reciprocal national treatment to investors, excluding benefits deriving from membership in \nfuture customs unions or free trade areas and agreements relating to taxation, and preclude expropriations except \nthose  undertaken  for  a  lawful  or  public  purpose,  when  nondiscriminatory,  prompt,  adequate,  and  effective \n ", "   13\nCambodia established the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with the US in 2006 \nthat provides a forum for bilateral dialogue on investment and trade issues, of which Cambodia \nis hopeful of negotiating a bilateral investment treaty in 2009. In July 2008, Cambodia also \nentered a bilateral investment agreement with Japan. Foreign investors are likely to avoid \ndestinations where they may be subject to double taxation in the home and host countries, \nunless generous tax breaks are provided in the host country. Countries overcome this problem \nthrough  negotiating  double  taxation  agreements,  but  Cambodia  has  none.  Expanding  the \nnetwork of bilateral investment agreements and negotiating double taxation agreements will \nhelp improve investor confidence and contribute to investment and economic diversification. It \nwould be an opportune time to review the effectiveness and budgetary cost in terms of foregone \nrevenues of fiscal investment incentives, indeed, double taxation agreements seem a necessary \nprecursor to reforming such incentives. \n \n28.  Competition  Policy.  In  general,  Cambodia  is  a  competitive  economy  where  many \nanticompetitive  issues  that  characterize  most  other  Southeast  Asian  economies  are  less \nrelevant. For example, Cambodia is relatively open at the border. Most major nontariff barriers \nhave been eliminated and tariffs reformed, albeit they are still relatively high in some areas. \nCambodia also does not have a large state enterprise sector, normally a major source of \nanticompetitive behavior in developing economies. However, as the economy expands and \nbecomes more sophisticated, it will be necessary to ensure competition in industries typically \nvulnerable to anticompetitive behavior, mainly traditional nontradable services, such as utilities. \nA  pragmatic  approach  to  competition  policy  would  be  to  establish  a  policy  framework  for \ncompetition focusing on open tariff and other trade policies, as well as deregulatory rules and \nguidelines overseen by independent regulatory bodies to ensure contestable utility markets, and \nestablishing a RIA within the Government to ensure regulations are not anticompetitive and \nlicensing  does  not  disadvantage  existing  or  potential  competitors  (i.e.,  competitive  neutral \nregulations). Regional neighbors have implemented competition policies; Indonesia\u2019s approach \nhas been to start with trade reforms, deregulation, and then privatization. At the later stages of \nimplementation, the Government of Indonesia introduced a competition law and commission in \n1999. The commission\u2019s approach has been pragmatic, and its efforts have helped trigger \nderegulation  in  a  few  sectors  (e.g.,  domestic  airlines).  However,  its  capacity  to  carry \nsophisticated economic analysis required for demonstrating anticompetitive behavior has been \nlimited.  \n \n29.  Excessive Red Tape and Licensing. In Cambodia, investors are concerned about red \ntape and associated informal payments. Line ministries are not required to assess the cost of \ncompliance with regulations for the business community or individuals or to assess whether the \nregulations  may  hurt  competition.  Therefore,  regulatory  compliance  costs  imposed  on  the \nprivate sector are not appreciated. However, unlike many other developing countries, Cambodia \ndoes have a legislative review process carried out by the Economic, Social Affairs and Culture \nObservation Unit (OBSESS) housed at the Council of Ministers. OBSESS does not advocate a  \ngovernment-wide RIA; however, strengthening its capacity to advocate and oversee RIA would \nimprove the quality of regulation. In addition, under the SMEDP, TA was provided to MIME staff \nto carry out a review of licenses, and toolkits were developed. Lessons from this activity indicate \nthat the review must be institutionalized within line ministries, and an oversight agency is \nneeded to advocate and monitor RIA. To do so requires a sequencing of institutional reforms \nover several years, starting with experimenting with an institutionalized RIA in line ministries to \ndevelop  demonstration  models  for  other  agencies  to  follow,  capacity  development  of  an \n                                                                                                                                                          \ncompensation at fair market values is ensured before expropriation. The agreements also guarantee repatriation of \ninvestments and provide for settlement of investment disputes via arbitration. \n ", "14   \noversight agency (such as OBSESS) to provide information advisory on RIA to line ministries, \npublic outreach activities, and formalization of RIA across the Government. \n \nFigure 6: Steps in the Government\u2019s Legislative Review Process  \n \n1.

Line ministries are not required to conduct a cost of compliance and competition assessment of the draft \nlegislation. \n2.   No agency or unit is mandated to provide oversight or information advocacy to support line ministries\u2019 efforts to \nimprove the quality of regulation through RIA.  \n3.

Trade Policy and Facilitation \n30.  Cambodia has made considerable progress in establishing a modern trade regime. \nUnder the trading system adopted in the early 1980s, the level and composition of trade was \neffectively  controlled  through  quantitative  restrictions  and  state-owned  trading  companies. \nTariffs and trade taxes played little or no role other than as a means to collect revenue. In the \nlate 1980s, however, a process of market-oriented reforms began. The state monopoly on \nforeign  trade  was  abolished  in  1987,  and  a  1989  foreign  investment  law  allowed  private \ncompanies to engage in foreign trade. In 1993, trade policies were greatly liberalized resulting in \nfew binding quantitative restrictions and nonprohibitive tax rates on imports and exports. In 2001, \nthe  tariff  structure  was  substantially  rationalized  and  liberalized  when  the  maximum  \nmost-favored  nation  rate  was  reduced  to  35%.  In  2004,  Cambodia  acceded  to  WTO  and \ncommitted to implementing legal reforms, including enacting over 25 different laws. However, no \nsignificant most-favored nation tariff reforms have occurred since 2001, although Cambodia has \ncontinued  to  implement  preferential  tariff  reductions  for its  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations  (ASEAN)  trading  partners  under  the  common  external  preferential  tariff.  Its  trade \nreforms have focused on trade facilitation measures, and preferential tariff reductions have \nwidened the tax wedge with most-favored nation rates. Going forward, it is opportune time to \nreassess the tariff structure with a view to toward reducing the maximum rate of 35% to lower \nthe tax wedge. The timing of tariff reductions will be subject to tax revenue  sustainability \nassessments, as customs revenue collection accounts for about 25% of the Government\u2019s \nbudget revenues.  \n ", "   15\n \nFigure 7: Import Tariff Rates \u2013 Regional Comparison \n(% rate) \n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCa mbodia Indonesia Lao P D R Malaysia Philippines Viet Na m Thailand\n       \n      Sources: Customs departments of Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, and Viet Nam. WTO \n      trade policy reviews for Thailand and Malaysia. \n \n31.  WTO Commitments. The Government continues to implement economic, trade, and \nlegal commitments as agreed under its WTO accession. However, it has not yet completed \nimplementation of its customs transaction valuation commitments, which are due by 2009. Legal \nand compliance notifications to WTO are also backlogged, including technical barriers to trade, \nSPS, and other potential nontariff barriers. Therefore, MOC established the Department of \nNotification and Legal Compliance (WTO Department) as the Government\u2019s focal point for \ncomplying with WTO notification requirements.12 While the Government considers completing \nWTO  commitments  important  for  its  integration  efforts,  it  must  strengthen  the  capacity  to \nimplement required policy reforms and to establish compliance notification procedures across \nrelevant agencies. This requires significant capacity development within the WTO Department \nas well as staff training. An immediate task will be to prioritize future work priorities of the \nvarious offices, including assigning each office clear responsibilities, especially in light of current \ninadequate staff numbers, which are unlikely to be substantially raised. The WTO Department \ncurrently  is  \u201ctop  heavy\u201d  with  nine  staff  members,  including  the  director  and  three  deputy \ndirectors; the position of deputy director of the Legal Compliance Office is currently vacant. The \nWTO Office has two staff members and the Notification and Administration Office one staff \nmember; the other two offices, including the increasingly important Services Negotiation Office, \neffectively  have  no  staff  members.  This  may  also  be  an  opportune  time  for  Cambodia  to \nundertake its first WTO trade policy review, an obligation that would provide a desirable stock \ntake on its trade-related policy regime; increase transparency; and inform WTO partners of its \ntrade-related developments, any major policy obstacles, and TA needs. \n \n32.  Strengthening Trade Policy Capacity. The institutional arrangements and processes \nfor establishing trade policy are just as important as reforms to the trade policy regime. In \nCambodia, MEF sets tariff rates since they are a major source of the Government\u2019s budget \nrevenue. MOC establishes the broad trade policy framework and agenda, is the Government\u2019s \nlead agency in WTO negotiations, and inspects imports through Camcontrol. While MOC has a \nforeign trade directorate, of which the new WTO Department is part, it lacks the resources \nneeded to conduct adequate trade policy analysis essential for supporting further trade reforms \nand to participate in WTO.13 At the same time, several government agencies are involved in \n                                                 \n12 The  department  consists  of  four  offices,  each  headed  by  a  deputy  director.  These  are  the  World  Trade \nOrganization Office, the Notification and Administrative Office, the Legal Compliance Office, and the Services \nNegotiation Office. \n13 The collapse of the Doha multilateral negotiations and other difficulties confronting WTO have heightened the need \nto build Cambodia\u2019s capacity to evaluate unilateral nondiscriminatory trade-related reforms. These offer the largest \n ", "16   \nsetting trade policy, such as MEF, MAFF, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Environment, so \nensuring consistency of trade policy across the Government is a challenge. With increasing \nprivate sector demand (e.g., cement industry) for trade remedies, MOC intends to establish \nantidumping  and  safeguard  mechanisms.  It  will  be  important  that  these  arrangements  are \nadministered using an economy-wide approach and measures adopted to ensure it does not \nbecome anticompetitive and a conduit for nontransparent forms of protection. \n \n33.  Customs  Reforms.  Several  surveys  suggest  that  Cambodia\u2019s  customs  operations, \nincluding document preparation, port and terminal handling, and inland transport and handling, \nare  still  an  obstacle  to  efficient  trade.  Cambodia  ranks  104  of  150  countries  on  customs \nefficiency according to a World Bank 2007 survey on trade logistics, well behind Malaysia (23), \nThailand (32), Indonesia (44), and Philippines (53). The time taken to export was 37 days in \n2007, down from 43 days in 2005. In recent years, Cambodia has implemented important \nreforms, including a new customs law in 2007 that requires 40 supporting or implementing \nregulations.  In  2008,  the  Government  operationalized  a  single  administrative  document  to \nstreamline customs documentation and piloted ASYCUDA14 at the seaport of Sihanoukville\u2014a \ncustoms  information  management  system  that  promotes  arms-length  transactions  between \nimporters and customs officials as well as timely trade and customs data collection. A risk \nmanagement unit has been established at the Customs & Excise Department, which once \nproperly operationalized, will help lower inspection rates at the ports. Going forward, ASYCUDA \nwill also need to be rolled out to other major (dry) ports and an action plan must be created to \ncomplete  implementation  of  Cambodia\u2019s  customs  transaction  valuation  commitments  under \nWTO. Cambodia is not yet a member of the Kyoto Convention, which promotes transparency \nand efficiency in customs procedures and operations. \n \n \nFigure 8: Time to Trade Across Borders and its Components \n \n80\n  Ports and\n70\nterminal\n60  Handling\n50  Customs\n  clearance and\ndays\n40  technical\ncontrol\n \n30 In land\ntransportation\n \n20 and Handling\n \n10 Document\nPreparation \n0\n \nCambodia Lao PDR Viet Nam Thailand PRC\n \n                     Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n                     Source: World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2006.

SPS \nare  key  to  microeconomic  infrastructure  to  improve  the  private  sector\u2019s  access  to  the \ninternational market for agro-based and fish products. Cambodia\u2019s exports of such products are \n                                                                                                                                                          \neconomic gains while any such benefits from discriminatory trade liberalization are much smaller and far less \ncertain. \n14 ASYCUDA is an acronym for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\u2019s Automated System for \nCustoms Data. \n ", "   17\nin its infancy, and inadequate SPS management systems are an obstacle to its development. \nCambodia\u2019s fishery industry has an estimated production of 300,000\u2013500,000 tons per year with \nfarm gate value of $250\u2013300 million; however, only 56,000 tons were exported, mainly through \nthird countries. \n \n35.  SPS Important for the Tourist Industry and Domestic Consumption. Improving SPS \nmanagement systems and administration is crucial to lowering the high incidence of food- and \nwater-related  diseases  and  creating  confidence  in  the  tourist-related  food  sector.  In  2006, \ntourists spent more than $90 million on food and beverages in hotels. Most importantly, however, \nit is critical to public health. In 2006, 672,000 individuals were admitted to the hospital for food- \nand water-related diseases (as compared to 17,883 in the US), with salmonella most common \nfollowed by campylobacter. \n \n36.  With  Cambodia\u2019s  accession  to  WTO,  it  agreed  to  full  SPS  compliance  within  a \ntransitional 5-year period. However, Cambodia is unlikely to achieve this commitment on time; \nalthough substantial SPS-related legislation and regulations have been produced in the last few \nyears, it has occurred ad hoc with little appreciation of the costs to the private sector as well as \nenforcement. Agencies also have duplicative functions and inspections along the supply chain \nfor agro-based processed products (Figure A4.4). The laboratories have limited capacity to \nprovide  a wide  range  of  SPS-related  testing  services. The  Industrial  Laboratory  Center  of \nCambodia  under  MIME  (MIME  lab)  recently  renovated  its  premises  and  procured  modern \ntesting equipment funded by UNIDO. However, much more needs to be done to upgrade its \nequipment, testing procedures and staff training. It has a limited budget to procure materials for \nundertaking tests. It also needs to operate on commercial principles to ensure its financial \nviability. Its tests results are not internationally recognized and therefore it needs to prepare \nitself for International Standards Organization (ISO) accreditation. The Institute of Standards of \nCambodia (ISC) needs to prepare for international accreditation as a conformity assessment \nbody  so  it  can  certify  management  and  process  standards  that  would  be  internationally \nrecognized. This will require assistance to the institute to prepare for accreditation, training of \nstaff  in  standards  and  its  assessors.  The  Government  recognizes that  further  reforms  are \nrequired in several key areas, including: (i) strengthening the framework for SPS management \nsystems,  including  clarifying  roles  and  functions  among  the  different  agencies  involved, \nassisting agencies\u2019 readiness for operating on a commercial basis, and assisting the ISC with \ndevelopment of its conformity assessment body and its ISO accreditation; (ii) improving SPS \nrelated to food and water; and (iii) developing effective management systems such as further \nupgrading of laboratories (at MAFF, MIME, and Camcontrol), assisting with these laboratories\u2019 \nISO accreditation, and procuring equipment. \n \nC.  Lessons \n37.  ADB has supported reforms in several areas related to private sector development, \nincluding SME development, banking and financial sector reforms, and agriculture. Key lessons \nfrom ADB private sector development programs and the associated TA projects include: \n \n(i)  Long-term perspective and government ownership. Promoting private sector \ndevelopment  and  economic  diversification  is  a  long-term  effort  requiring  a  \nlonger-term policy perspective. The adoption of the SWAp to trade and DTIS \nmeant that the Government has a set of long-term objectives that guide and \nshape medium-term policy design and implementation. The close consultative \nprocess  involving  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners \nstrengthened  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  and  increased  the  potential  for \n ", "18   \nagency buy-in. \n(ii)  Flexibility in design. Private sector reforms involving the investment climate and \ntrade policy and facilitation are complex. Consequently, sufficient time must be \nallocated for program implementation. Lessons from the SMEDP suggest that \nregulatory reform is likely to be successful if an institutional arrangement is in \nplace that provides for RIA. Design flexibility is also a key consideration. The use \nof the program cluster approach provides the opportunity to refine succeeding \nsubprograms to reflect the Government\u2019s achievements, changes in the policy \nenvironment, and lessons from the previous subprograms.  \n(iii)  TA  resources.  Under  the  PED  Program,  institutional  development  will  be \nemphasized to improve private sector competitiveness. These measures and \nprojects  are  relatively  new  concepts  and  therefore  will  require  extensive \ncoordination  and  consultation  to  ascertain  stakeholders\u2019  understanding, \nacceptance, and likely adoption of new measures. Substantial TA support will be \nnecessary to ensure that best practices are incorporated and then consolidated \nthroughout implementation to achieve the intended results.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n38.  The impact of the PED Program will be an expanded and diversified private sector. The \noutcome of the PED Program will be an improved business environment where the private \nsector operates efficiently and effectively. \n \n39.  The PED Program includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the priorities of the \nNSDP and the SWAp and are designed to accomplish the following:  \n \n(i)  maintain macroeconomic stability necessary for private sector development and \ngrowth by continuing to make progress toward price stability through prudent \nfiscal policy, as price instability in a transitional economic can inhibit private \nsector growth; \n(ii)  improve the investment climate by strengthening investor protection, enhancing \nthe environment for competition and innovation, and institutionalizing a RIA within \nthe Government and other policy reforms aimed at reducing transaction costs \nand risks in Cambodia; and \n(iii)  improve trade policy and facilitation by continuing reforms to meet WTO legal \nrequirements, renewing trade policy reforms, and enhancing trade facilitation by \nstrengthening SPS management systems and customs reforms. \n \n40.  Subprogram  1  is  designed  to  be  a  single-tranche  operation  with  a  well-defined \nframework to align with the Government\u2019s SWAp to trade. A TA project and a policy advisory TA \nalso are proposed to support the deepening and implementation of reforms over the PED \nProgram  period.  Consideration  of  subprograms  2  and  3  and  will  depend  on  satisfactory \naccomplishment of policy triggers. TA for subprograms 2 and 3 will also depend on satisfactory \naccomplishment of TA triggers. The design and monitoring framework for the PED Program is in \nAppendix 1. The PED medium-term program, including the policy matrix for subprogram 1, \ntriggers, and milestones for subprograms 2 and 3, is in Appendix 2. Appendix 3 presents the \ndonor coordination matrix. Appendix 8 presents the TA project, and Appendix 9 outlines the \npolicy advisory TA. \n \n ", "   19\nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n41.  All 21 policy measures required for subprogram 1 were carried out by the end of October \n2008. \n \n1.  Subprogram 1, Core Area 1: Macroeconomic Stability in Support of Private \nSector Development \n42.  Subprogram  1  acknowledges  that  Cambodia  has  made  progress  in  maintaining \nmacroeconomic stability through tightening its fiscal policy and implementing measures to lower \naggregate demand to contain inflation in 2008. \n \n43.  The increase in the public budget surplus from 1.2% of the GDP in 2006 to 3.2% in 2007 \nand maintaining a sizeable surplus in 2008 were major achievements and contributed to an \nappropriate macroeconomic policy response to the surge in domestic inflation and signs of \noverheating of the economy in 2007. The appropriate fiscal stance is reflected in the continued \naccumulation of government deposits at the National Bank of Cambodia by over 30% in the 9 \nmonths of 2008 over 2007 levels. The increase in the budget surplus was aided by an increase \nin revenue collection, amounting to 42% in 2007 over 2006 levels, which was achieved through \ngreater income tax as well as improved tax collections. The continual reduction in the year-end \ndebt  level  from  27%  in  2005  to  25%  in  2006  and  24%  in  2007  further  improves  debt \nsustainability.  \n \n2.  Subprogram 1, Core Area 2: Investment Climate \n44.  Subprogram  1  supports  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  to  improve  the  regulatory \nenvironment  for  investments  and  private  sector  growth.  The  main  objective  is  to  diversify \ninvestment in the economy. Reform areas of critical significance include implementing action \nplans  for  regulatory  impact  assessments,  reducing  the  cost  of  enterprise  registration,  and \nimproving investor protection. The following measures toward achieving these objectives were \ncompleted before Board consideration of subprogram 1. \n \n45.  Regulatory Review Program. The PED Program supports the Government\u2019s efforts to \nstreamline red tape by assisting with the establishment of an institutionalized RIA in the medium \nterm. As a first step in this process, MIME has developed and endorsed an action plan for \nestablishing an RIA. The RIA requires all proponents of new regulations within the ministries to \ncomplete a checklist on compliance cost and impact on competition. TA will be provided under \nthe PED Program to support the implementation of the action plan, including developing the \nchecklists and training on cost compliance analysis. TA will be provided to MOC to develop an \naction plan and to assist OBSESS in strengthening its capacity in subsequent subprograms. \n \n46.  Reduce Registration Costs. In 2007, MOC reduced the cost of enterprise registration \nto $105 from $177, which will save the private sector several millions of dollars in registration \ncosts over the next several years.  \n \n47.  Bilateral Investment Frameworks and Agreement. Cambodia is a party to several \nbilateral  investment  agreements.  The  Government  signed  a  bilateral  trade  and  investment \nframework  agreement  with  the  US  in  2006  to  establish  a  forum  for  bilateral  dialogue  on \ninvestment and trade issues, of which the first forum was undertaken in 2007. An investment \nagreement with Japan, effective from July 2008, provides for investor guarantees covering \ndispute resolution, nationalization of assets, and repatriation of profits.  \n ", "20   \n3.  Subprogram 1, Core Area 3: Trade Policy and Facilitation \n48.  Subprogram 1 supports the Government\u2019s goals of continuing trade policy reforms to \nlower the cost of doing business for the private sector and measures to improve trade facilitation \n(customs and SPS) for enhanced competitiveness. Institutional reforms to accelerate WTO \ncommitments, customs reforms, and measures to improve SPS management systems were the \nmain  actions  toward  achieving  these  objectives  completed  before  Board  consideration  of \nsubprogram 1. \n \n49.  Accelerating  WTO  Commitments.  Since  accession,  the  Government  continues  to \nimplement WTO commitments and to start notification of legal compliance with WTO obligations \nrelated to tariff barriers to trade and SPS. In this context, MOC in 2007 established the WTO \nDepartment,  which  has  been  provided  a  recurrent  budget  for  2008,  and  is  mandated  to \nimplement  notification  procedures  within  the  Government  and  assess  whether  proposed \nregulations comply with WTO rules. The department will also be the focal point for WTO \nnegotiations, including on services and future trade policy reviews. It will require longer-term \nassistance  to  build  capacity  to  execute  its  functions  and  produce  trade  policy  analyses \nnecessary for effective WTO participation. The WTO Department has produced a medium-term \ncapacity development and work plan for 2008\u20132010, which has formed the basis of the TA. An \nimmediate task of this TA will be to assist the department in prioritizing the remaining WTO and \ntrade policy reform agenda, including addressing implementation issues and the backlog in \nnotifications of legal compliance and priority trade laws.  \n \n50.  Customs Reforms. The Government has made substantial progress in implementing \ncustoms reforms in 2008, critical to improving trade facilitation at the border. Under subprogram \n1,  four  measures  were  taken  to  improve  customs  facilitation.  First,  in  2007,  the  National \nAssembly enacted a new customs law that reflects good international practices, including WTO \ncustoms transaction valuations and the Kyoto Convention. It will require some 40 implementing \nregulations (e.g., rules of origin, transaction value, and related customs valuation matters) of \nwhich 23 implementing regulations were issued by September 2008. Notable implementing \nregulations include a decree on transit of goods issued in July 2008 and associated guidelines \nin August 2008, procedures for customs declarations, and refunds of customs duty and taxes. \nSecond, to streamline customs procedures and improve transparency, a prakas15 on the use of \nthe  single  administrative  document  was  issued  under  the  new  customs  legislation.  Third, \nASYCUDA was piloted at the Sihanoukville seaport in May 2008, promoting transparency and a \nmodern  customs  information  system  that  provides  timely  tracking  of  export  and  import \nshipments and customs data. It will be fully rolled out to other custom posts under subprogram 2 \nby mid-2009, including the airport, petroleum port, and the Phnom Penh dry port. Currently, \nSihanoukville covers about one third of trade, and coverage will be extended to an estimated \n80%  by  the  end  of  2008.  Fourth,  the  Customs  &  Excise  Department  established  a  risk \nmanagement unit responsible for establishing a risk-based inspection system and developed \nprocedures  and  manuals  for  this  purpose.  Staff  training  and  operationalization  will  be \nundertaken in subsequent subprograms.  \n \n51.  Improvement of SPS Management Systems. The Government is at an early stage of \ndeveloping SPS management systems in Cambodia. Under the PED Program, the Government \nwill implement measures to strengthen the institutional set up for SPS, enhance capacity of \npublic and private agencies to implement SPS, and enhance public awareness. The following \n                                                 \n15 A regulation issued by a minister or by the governor of the National Bank of Cambodia concerning banking or \nfinancial issues. \n ", "   21\nmeasures toward achieving these objectives were completed before Board consideration of \nsubprogram 1. \n \n52.  Three relevant decrees were issued to strengthen the institutional set up by clarifying \nfunctions of agencies. The first decree establishes ISC and outlines its organizational structure \nand functions. ISC will be responsible for producing industrial standards, including those related \nto agroprocessing. The decree also mandates ISC to establish an accreditation board. MIME \nhas agreed to undertake a feasibility of the readiness for an accreditation board and to ensure \nits  independence  from  ISC  in  subsequent  subprograms.  The  second  decree  outlines  the \noperation and functioning of Camcontrol, including its upgrade from an agency to a directorate \ngeneral status for food safety surveillance at the wet markets and at the retail level and for \nproduct safety at the border. The third decree establishes a special operating agency allowing \nline  agencies  to  commercialize  public  service  obligations  by  providing  the  agency  with  a \nperformance contract and some degree of fiscal autonomy as a way to improve incentives for \nbetter public service delivery. The special operating agency provides an alternative option to the \nexisting  modality  of  creating  a  public  enterprise  with  economic  characteristics.  Where \nappropriate,  the  special  operating  agency  and  public  enterprises  models  will  be  used  to \ncommercialize public service obligations in the SPS sector in subsequent subprograms.  \n \n53.  The Government issued decrees to improve SPS in high-risk food sectors. The first is a \ndecree on slaughterhouse management and sanitary inspection of animal products. ISC also \nissued seven SPS for food products.  \n \nC.  Medium-Term Program: Triggers for Subprograms 2 and 3 \n \n54.  The development policy letter (Appendix 2) sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda for \nthe next 4 years, building on the reform momentum of subprogram 1. There are 9 triggers for \nsubprogram 2 and 10 triggers for subprogram 3. The milestones that will be monitored for \nsubprograms 2 and 3 are also described in Appendix 2. \n \n55.  Macroeconomic Stability. Subprogram 2 has one fiscal policy trigger\u2014to maintain an \nappropriate current budget surplus to control inflation and avoid overheating of the economy. \nThis will mean continuing to accumulate government deposits at the National Bank of Cambodia. \nSubprogram 3 has one fiscal trigger to continue an appropriate fiscal policy stance, which will \nprovide a basis for continual dialogue between the Government and ADB on macroeconomic \npolicy. \n \n56.  Investment Climate. There are a series of triggers on RIA and technology policy (Table \n2). Under subprogram 2, MIME will begin institutionalizing a RIA by implementing the action \nplan developed under subprogram 1. Important supporting milestones will be (i) MOC  will \ndevelop, adopt, and start implementing its action plan under subprogram 2; (ii) strengthening \nthe capacity of OBSESS through developing RIA tools and guidelines, (iii) staff training on RIA, \n(iv) developing an information management system that would archive new regulations and \nlegislation, (v) produce an annual report on regulation performance, and (vi) start outreach \nprograms to selected line ministries to adopt RIA. Additional milestones under subprograms 2 \ninclude MOC produce an action plan for promoting competition policy.  Under subprogram 3, \nthere will be a trigger for implementing a technology and innovation capacity plan, which will be \nsupported by a proposed ADB matching grants project for improving SME access to SPS \ntechnology. \n \n \n ", "22   \nTable 2: Investment Policy Triggers for Subprograms 2 and 3 \nSubprogram 2  Subprogram 3 \n1.

Trade Policy. Under subprogram 2, there are two trade policy triggers (Table 3). First, \nMOC will finalize the legal framework for trade remedy procedures consistent with an economy-\nwide approach that will consider public rather than sectoral interests. Second, the Government \nwill request and substantially complete preparations for its first WTO trade policy review with \nMOC\u2019s WTO Department acting as the Government\u2019s focal point. Under subprogram 3, the \nGovernment will review its most-favored nation tariff structure and develop appropriate across-\nthe-board tariff reforms focusing on the highest tariff rates (35% band). \n \nTable 3: Trade Policy Triggers for Subprogram 2 and 3 \nSubprogram 2  Subprogram 3 \n1.

Trade  Facilitation.  There  are  five  policy  triggers  for  subprogram  2  and  five  policy \ntriggers for subprogram 3 focusing on strengthening the institutional framework for effective \nSPS management and enhancing capacity to implement SPS (Table 4). Under subprogram 2, \ntriggers relate to signing a memorandum of understanding between SPS-related agencies to \nclarify delineation of functions, commercializing the MIME laboratory, and developing an ISC \nconformity assessment body for SPS management. Under subprogram 3, MIME will undertake \na  feasibility  assessment  of  establishing  a  national  accreditation  board  to  accredit  SPS \nassessors, the MIME laboratory to function on commercial principles, and MIME to develop an \naction plan to commercialize ISC. An important milestone under subprogram 2 will be MOC \nprepare an action plan to commercialize Camcontrol\u2019s laboratory. Under subprogram 3, the \npolicy trigger will be MOC endorse and start implementing its action plan to commercialize its \nlaboratory. There are two triggers for customs: (i) rollout of the ASYCUDA to the other ports, \nand (ii) an action plan for completion of customs transaction valuation commitments under WTO \nby 2012. \n \n ", "   23\nTable 4: Trade Facilitation Triggers for Subprograms 2 and 3 \nSubprogram 2  Subprogram 3 \n1.

Impact and Outcomes of the Program. By the end of 2012, the PED Program is \nexpected to have improved Cambodia\u2019s macroeconomic stability through prudent fiscal policy; \nincreased investment and economic diversification through lowered regulatory compliance costs \nand  better  investor  protection;  increased  exports  and  diversification  of  products  through \nimproved SPS management systems and private sector access to SPSs; reduced customs \ntrade facilitation costs; and promoting competition. The Program also will have strengthened the \nSPS management system, increased the Government\u2019s capacity to assess trade policy for \nCambodia, addressed the backlog in WTO compliance and legal notifications, and improved \nSME access to SPS technology.  \n \n60.  Reforms to investment and trade could add at least 2.4% to Cambodia\u2019s GDP. The \nPED Program developed a macroeconomic model on the economy that allows simulations of \nproposed reforms on the GDP, exports, and employment. The model includes a household \nmicrosimulation model that allows an assessment of the reforms on household incomes and \npoverty. The results of the simulations are presented in Table 5. Transaction costs (both formal \nand  informal)  are  assumed  to  be  involved  in  regulatory  compliance,  and  trade  facilitation \n(customs facilitation and SPS outreach) is halved from 5% of businesses\u2019 turnover to 2.5%, \nraising the GDP by 1.8%. Further rationalization of the customs tariff regime by cutting the \neffective rate in half could add 0.6% to the GDP. Both reforms combined would add 2.4% to the \nGDP over the medium-term, an equivalent gain of $200 million (in 2007 prices) to the economy. \nThe reforms would add to greater diversification of the economy with large gains made for \npaddy,  chemical,  plastic,  and  rubber  products,  and  transport.  The  reforms  would  increase \nemployment and wages, with positively impacting female employment, simulated to rise by \n6.3% from these reforms. In addition, the reforms could lower poverty by 2.7%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "24   \nTable 5: Simulated Macroeconomic and Poverty Results from Proposed PED Reforms \n(% change) \n  Transaction Costs Cut in   \nItem  Half  Rationalization of Tariff Structure \nReal GDP  1.8  0.6 \n--Import volumes  1.1  1.0 \n  Export volumes  3.7  2.0 \nEmployment wage bill  3.7  1.2 \nEmployment     \n-- Male  3.3  1.0 \n-- Female  4.7  1.6 \nHousehold real incomes  6.0  1.8 \nPoverty rate  (2.0)  (0.7) \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: Transaction costs refer to reforms resulting in reduction in trade facilitation costs at Customs and costs \nassociated with sanitary and phytosanitary standard, and reduction by half in transaction costs of doing business \ninside Cambodia. \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates (ADB. 2008.

The PED Program has some distinct and innovative features. First, the Government has \ndemonstrated ownership by formulating a consistent and well-sequenced policy framework for \nprivate sector reforms over the medium term, as articulated in its SWAp to trade and DTIS. \nSecond, designed as a program cluster with subsequent subprograms linked by triggers within a \nmedium-term  framework,  the  PED  Program  encourages  continuous  engagement  by \ndevelopment partners over the medium-term. Third, the central feature of the PED Program is \ncapacity development, which is addressed through TA, projects and anchoring the program to \nthe Government\u2019s SWAp to trade. Fourth, the PED Program uses TA projects and grants to \nstrengthen capacity to enhance private sector competitiveness, which are linked to satisfactory \naccomplishment  of  policy  triggers  or  milestones  (Appendix  8).  This  ensures  government \nownership and an appropriate policy environment for implementation of the TA. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n62.  The Government has requested a loan of $20 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to finance subprogram 1 of the PED Program, with terms and conditions in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. In addition, \nthe Government has requested a grant of $2 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to \nfinance institutional capacity development in SPS management systems project.  \n \n63.  The loan and grant are to support the reforms outlined in the development policy letter \nand policy matrix (Appendix 2). The loan size was determined by the strength of the policy \npackage, its development impact, the importance of the sectors covered, and the development \nfinancing needs of the Government as estimated by MEF. While the eventual economic benefits \nwill greatly outweigh the costs (benefits to the economy are estimated to be at least $200 \nmillion), the costs will dominate in the short term. Despite a commitment to completing the \nunfinished  trade  policy  agenda  and  trade  facilitation  measures,  some  segments  of  the \nbureaucracy  and  private  sector  may  resist  further  reforms.  Delays  in  implementing  these \nreforms could result in substantially higher costs for the economy than the adjustment costs, as \nsuch delays would slow the realization of benefits of a lower-cost regulatory and trade regime \nand therefore economic diversification. Direct adjustment costs include (i) foregone revenues \nand rents resulting from customs reforms, (ii) further reductions in the revenues of the relevant \n ", "   25\nagencies and informal payments as a result of future reductions in red tape, (iii) the costs of \nimplementing trade facilitation measures such as customs reforms and strengthening SPS \nmanagement systems, and (iv) the costs of rolling out the business registration system to the \nprovinces and implementing RIA within the Government. \n \n64.  The loan reflects the development financing needs of the Government (Table 6). The \nPED Program supports the Government\u2019s efforts to increase current budget surpluses although \nits overall budget will remain in deficit as the Government finances development infrastructure. \nThe Government\u2019s net external financing needs will be significant if it is to sustain economic \ngrowth of 7.5% per year over the medium term and reduce poverty to 24% by 2015. According \nto  MEF  budget  reports,  the  estimated  net  financing  (external)  requirements  for  2008  are \nestimated at $451.3 million, of which $408.5 million is earmarked for development projects and \n$42.8  million  for  financing  the  budget.  Over  the  longer  term,  the  Government  envisages \nreducing external debt as a percentage of GDP as the economy continues to expand. Recent \ndebt assessments by ADB, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank indicate that the \nGovernment\u2019s debt stock and servicing levels are sustainable over the medium term provided (i) \nfiscal consolidation remains on track, (ii) the economy continues to expand 7.5% per year, and \n(iii) further investment and trade reforms stimulate more private sector growth (Appendix 5). The \n$20 million loan and $2 million grant will help to close the financing gap for 2008, as well as \nsupport the Government\u2019s reforms to investment and trade.  \n \nTable 6: Government of Cambodia Projected Development Financing  \nRequirements for 2008 \n  Proposed Amounts  \nFinancing Mix   ($ million) \n1.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n \n65.  As the Executing Agency (EA), MOC will be responsible for the overall implementation of \nsubprogram  1,  including  carrying  out  all  policy  actions,  program  administration,  and \nmaintenance of program records. MOC will use the private sector development sub-steering \ncommittee on Trade Development and Trade-related Investments (PSC), to be responsible for \ncoordinating the implementation and sustaining the PED policy actions, with MOC, MEF, MIME, \nand relevant line agencies involved in supporting the program. The PSC will meet quarterly to \nmonitor progress and oversee the implementation of the PED program. ADB may be invited to \n ", "26   \nparticipate in the meetings as an observer, and English translations of all meeting minutes must \nbe forwarded to ADB within 2 weeks of each meeting. MOC will be responsible for day-to-day \nprogram implementation activities and will report on implementation progress. MOC also will \nestablish  a  program  management  unit  and  assign  counterpart  staff  with  qualifications  and \nexperience acceptable to ADB. MEF will be responsible for subprogram 1 disbursements.  \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n66.  Subprogram 1 implementation period is from June 2007 to December 2008. All actions \nincluded in the policy matrix for subprogram 1 were implemented before submission to the \nBoard for consideration.    \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n67.  The loan will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness (i.e., all conditions in the \nsubprogram 1 policy matrix must be complied with before release of the tranche). The loan \nproceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs of items produced and procured \nin ADB member countries no more than 180 days before the loan\u2019s effectiveness date. Items \nspecified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources are excluded. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,16 Cambodia will be \nthe borrower of the proceeds of the program loan. Supporting import documentation will not be \nrequired if, during each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of \nCambodia imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of \nthe loan expected to be disbursed during that year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith this formula with the withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under existing \nprocedures will be required. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and \nrelated requirements for program loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB \n \n68.  The reform needs supported under the subprogram 1 will be met through local currency \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the loan. \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Assessment \n69.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the SPS project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agencies and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service provides as they relate to the SPS project. All relevant ADB \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.

An assessment of the country\u2019s financial management systems has been carried out to \nimprove the understanding of fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements \nfor the purpose of the PED Program. This assessment was based on the sector work of ADB\u2019s \nproposed PFMRD, as well as the Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure \nReview (IFAPER) for 2003 and the Country Procurement Assessment for 2004, both led by \nWorld Bank. These assessments identified core areas to address with development partners\u2019 \nsupport. The IFAPER determined that the fiduciary risk in the use and management of public \nfunds was high. As a consequence, the Government developed and began implementing a \nmedium-term  public  financial  management  reform  program  (PFMRP)  from  2004  to  2012, \nsupported by development partners. This program increases the amount of public resources \nallocated to planning and management to overcome the significant weaknesses in the basic \nsystems and processes for budget preparation, execution and control, reporting, and oversight. \nIt comprises a series of four sequenced platforms, of which platform one was completed in 2007 \nand platform two beginning in 2008 with the rollout of public financial management reforms to \nthe line ministries. ADB, World Bank, and other development partners are working closely with \nthe Government to implement improved public sector financial management systems. ADB has \nsupported the Government\u2019s program through debt management TA at MEF and is preparing \nPFMRD to support the rollout of the second platform.  \n   \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n71.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen or nominate a deposit account at the National Bank of Cambodia to receive all loan \nproceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms \nsatisfactory to ADB. MOC will be required to submit quarterly progress reports, as well as a final \nreport, on the progress of subprogram 1\u2019s implementation, which will form part of the PED \nProgram final report if subprogram 2 is approved.  \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n \n72.  In cooperation with the committee (para. 82), ADB will review implementation progress \nand assess the impact of the Program. The Government will keep ADB informed of the outcome \nof policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for \nprogram implementation and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting \npolicy proposals. ADB will review program performance 6 months after loan effectiveness to \nassess the outcome of subprogram 1 and to begin preparation of subprogram 2. The review will \n(i) evaluate implementation of the policy reform measures under subprogram 1, and assess the \nimpact on each sector; (ii) describe lessons identified during the program period; and (iii) outline \nreforms  and  assistance  needed  for  development  of  the  sector  to  enable  processing  of \nsubprogram 2. In addition, participants in a Cambodia private sector forum (partner agencies, \nbusiness  groups,  and  other  stakeholders)  will  be  encouraged  to  support  private  sector \nmonitoring of the reforms under the PED Program. The project management unit will submit to \nthe  committee  and  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  policy  and  institutional  measures \nimplemented. The reports will be submitted in such form and detail as ADB requests and should \ninclude (i) progress made and problems encountered during the period under review, (ii) steps \n ", "28   \ntaken or proposed to remedy problems encountered, (iii) the proposed detailed activity for \nprogram implementation, and (iv) expected progress during the next quarter. \n \n73.  The Government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators to \nmonitor  the  PED  Program  implementation  and  evaluate  its  impact  within  the  overall  PED \nframework (Appendix 1). Data for assessing indicators will come from a variety of public sector \nand  stakeholder  sources  including  the  National  Institute  of  Statistics,  the  Council  for  the \nDevelopment of Cambodia, MEF, and various stakeholder surveys such as the International \nFinance Corporation\u2019s Doing Business surveys.  \n \nV.  PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT GRANT \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n74.  To support implementation, the Government has requested ADB to provide a grant for \ncapacity development in SPS management systems. This SPS project will be funded under a \ngrant of $2 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.  \n \n75.  The objectives of this SPS project are: (i) to support the Government in strengthening \nthe SPS framework for effective SPS management, including clarifying roles and functions \namong the different involved agencies, assisting agencies in operating on a commercial basis, \nand assisting the new ISC with development of its conformity assessment body and its ISO \naccreditation; (ii) to improve SPS related to food and water; and (iii) to enhance capacity \ndevelopment for effective management systems, such as further upgrading of laboratories (e.g., \nat MIME), assisting with the laboratory\u2019s ISO accreditations, procuring equipment and rapid \ndiagnostic tools, and training staff, and strengthening the risk management unit at Camcontrol. \nThis requires substantial investments in institutional capacity development over the longer term \n(3 years) to equip agencies to administer SPS. The focus of the SPS project is to improve \ndelivery of services to exporters and suppliers to the domestic market. Improved SPS, and \nparticularly ISO accreditation, will improve exporters\u2019 international market access. Improved \nSPS management systems will benefit producers and suppliers to the domestic market through \nbetter quality and consumer confidence in products. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "   29\nB.

The Government will finance $360,000 equivalent \nthrough in-kind contributions of counterpart staff, other facilities, and part of the taxes and duties. \nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 8 and details are in Appendix 8. \n \nTable 8: Project Financing Plan \n($ million) \nTotal  Financing \nSource \nCost  Percentage \nAsian Development Bank  2.00    85 \nGovernment a  0.36    15 \n    Total  2.36  100 \na Government financing is in kind in terms of office accommodation, counterpart staff allowances  \nand salaries, meeting facilities etc. In addition, Government will finance part of the taxes and duties. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n ", "30   \nD.  Project Components \n78.  Component  1:  Institutional  Framework  for  SPS  Management  Systems.  This \ncomponent will support key ministries concerned with the drafting of SPS-related laws and \nregulations by coordinating their activities, harmonizing drafts with ASEAN member countries, \nand ensuing that the policy and legal framework has a national perspective, with particular \nemphasis on clearly-defined responsibilities. At the same time, the component will seek to gain \nequivalence  with  bilateral  and  multilateral  agreements,  including  standards  that  are  WTO-\ncompliant. \n \n79.  Component 2: Capacity Development in SPS Service Providers. This component will \nsupport the MIME laboratory concerned with food safety under MIME (agro-processing) to \nstrengthen its analytical capacity and capability to gain internationally recognized ISO 17025 \ncertification and mutual recognition for microbiology (food and water) and chemical (heavy \nmetals,  pesticides,  preservatives  and  colorants)  test  results,  and  to  improve  test  accuracy \nthrough interproficiency laboratory testing. This component will further support Camcontrol in \nstrengthening risk management procedures and systems for imported food products and in its \nmarket surveillance operations. This intervention will also assist the MIME laboratory where \npossible to become commercially-oriented.  \n \n80.  Component 3: Capacity Development at the Institute of Standards of Cambodia. \nThis  component  will  assist  ISC  in  national  product,  management  and  process  standards \ndevelopment and to gain international recognition of those standards, recommending the further \ndevelopment  of  standards  for  (i)  high-risk  foods;  (ii)  standards  operating  procedures  for \nslaughterhouses, wet markets, food processors, preparation outlets, and fishing boats; and (iii) \nanalytical laboratory procedures. This component will help ISC to become an internationally \naccredited conformity assessment body for process systems under ISO 17021 and to finance a \nfeasibility assessment of establishing a national accreditation body under ISO 17011 guidelines. \nThis intervention will also assist ISC, where possible, to become commercially-oriented.  \n \nE.  Project Implementation Arrangements \n81.  Project  Management. MIME will be the EA for this SPS project. MOC will be the \nImplementing  Agency  (IA).  MIME  will  use  the  private  sector  development  sub-steering \ncommittee on Manufacturing and Small and Medium Enterprises (project steering committee or \nPSC), which will be responsible for coordinating the implementation and sustaining the SPS \nproject with MOC (Camcontrol) and relevant line agencies involved in supporting the Project. \nThis arrangement will minimize transaction costs and provide government-wide synergy as \nMIME  houses  ISC  and  the  industrial  laboratory.  The  EA  will  (i)  coordinate  project \nimplementation with the IA, (ii) carry out administrative and fiduciary support, and (iii) support \nboth Government and ADB reporting requirements on the progress and use of the project funds. \nA project implementation unit will be established within the EA. \n \n82.  Period of Implementation. The SPS project will be implemented over a period of 3 \nyears. Project activities are scheduled to commence in April 2009 and be completed by March \n2012. The project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n83.  Consulting Services and Procurement. The SPS project will finance a team of 6 \ninternational and 1 national consultant for implementation. A firm will be engaged using the \nquality and cost-based selection method (80:20) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. A total of 58 (48 international and 10 national) person-months will be \n ", "   31\nrequired. Project equipment will be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. At the request of the Government, consultants will be selected and \nadministered by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. As the SPS project deals with MIME and MOC in areas \nwhere there is agency duplication and unclear delineation of agency functions along the agro-\nbased product supply chain, the Government believes that ADB administration of the SPS \nproject would ensure SPS priorities and reforms are synchronized across agencies. In this way, \nthe SPS project will improve capacity among the agencies to coordinate SPS-related functions \nnecessary for an effective SPS management system. Small or off-the-shelf goods and materials \nvalued at less than $100,000 may be procured under direct purchase arrangements. Items with \nsimilar specifications will be combined into one package, when possible. Laboratory equipment \nwill  be  procured  by  the  MIME  laboratory  based  on  specifications  of  the  consultants.  All \nequipment procured under the SPS project will be transferred to the EA and IA. The terms of \nreference for the consulting services and their duration are in Supplementary Appendix 1. The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 8.  \n \n84.  Disbursement Arrangements. The ADB grant proceeds will be disbursed according to \nthe procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nTo speed up project implementation through the timely release of grant proceeds for eligible \nexpenditures,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  for  the  EA  by  the  Government  at  a \ncommercial bank chosen by the National Bank of Cambodia and acceptable to ADB. The ceiling \nof the accounts and the initial amounts deposited will be 6 months of estimated expenditures to \nbe financed through an imprest account, or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The \nimprest account will be managed and administered by the EA. The statement of expenditure \nprocedure may be used when seeking reimbursement of eligible expenditures and liquidating \nadvances made into the imprest accounts.  Each payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under \nthe statement of expenditure will not exceed the equivalent of $10,000. \n \n85.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  EA,  assisted  by  the  team  leader,  will \nmaintain separate project accounts and financial statements in accordance with the provisions \nof the Grant Agreement and Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of \nInvestment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  (2002)  and  will  have  them  audited  annually  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB. During project implementation, within 6 months of the \nend of each fiscal year, the EA will submit to ADB certified copies of the annual audited project \naccounts and financial statements, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, which will include a separate \nopinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures, and \nmanagement  letter,  in  English.  The  EA  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to  ADB, \nindicating progress made, problems encountered, and steps taken to remedy the problems, a \nprogram of activities, and expected progress during the implementation period. The reports will \nincorporate the project performance monitoring data and all relevant financial data. The EA will \nalso provide reports and information relating to the SPS project as ADB reasonably requests. \nWithin 3 months after project completion, the EA will submit to ADB a project completion report \ndetailing information on project implementation and accomplishment of the project activities. \n \n86.  Project Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting. The Government and \nADB will undertake joint reviews of the SPS project every 6 months to assess progress in \ncomponent activities, the quality of activities and the outputs produced, the performance of the \nproject, and identify issues and challenges. The EA and ADB will conduct a midterm review \ncovering a comprehensive assessment of achievements against the SPS project\u2019s expected \nimpact and outcomes, and the modification of implementation arrangements where necessary \nfor the successful completion of the SPS project.  \n ", "32   \nVI.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n87.  In connection with the PED Program, a policy and advisory TA grant for enhancing \nprivate  sector  competitiveness  is  proposed  to  support  capacity  development  and \nimplementation of the policy triggers under subprogram 2. The TA is estimated at a cost of \n$960,000, of which $800,000 is proposed to be financed by the Technical Assistance Special \nFund (Appendix 9). \n \n88.  The TA will support the implementation of the triggers for subprogram 2 and provide the \nGovernment with timely policy advice on a demand basis. The objective of the TA is to assist \nthe Government in finding practical solutions to address these issues, as well as to deepen the \nGovernment\u2019s agenda in the investment and trade area under the PED Program. It has five \ncomponents.  Component  1  will  support  trade  policy  and  competition  policy  capacity \ndevelopment at MOC, including assisting in capacity development at the new WTO Department, \ndeveloping  trade  remedies,  developing  a  competition  policy  framework,  and  facilitating  its \nadoption. This will include undertaking a series of case studies on anticompetitive practices. \nThis component will also assist MOC with rolling out its enterprise registry to selected provinces. \nComponent 2 will support MOC and MIME to implement action plans for regulatory review and \nstrengthen capacity at OBSESS. Component 3 will assist MIME to develop a technology policy \nframework.  Component  4  will  support  MEF  to  develop  frameworks  for  double  taxation \nagreements and advocating their adoption as part of the Government\u2019s investment promotion \nregime. Component 5 will work with the Customs & Excise Department to strengthen capacity at \nthe risk management unit and to undertake a study on Cambodia\u2019s readiness to join the Kyoto \nConvention. MOC will be the EA for the TA. The TA budget and implementation arrangements \nare in Appendix 9. The terms of references are in Supplementary Appendix 2.  \n \nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n89.  The key benefits expected from the PED Program are: \n \n(i)  Lowered transaction costs for businesses because of reduction in red tape and \ncustoms reforms which will open new opportunities, increase trade, investment \nand productivity, boost the economy, increase incomes, and create jobs.  \n(ii)  Strengthened institutional development by improving the capabilities of the EA \nand  IAs  to  carry  out  trade  and  competition  policy  analysis  with  the  aim  of \nupgrading the quality of policy and institutional processes for policy making. \n(iii)  Upgraded agro-based products and improved market access through effective \nSPS management systems. It will also improve food safety for the booming \ntourism sector and contribute to improved food safety for the population. \n(iv)  Improved private sector capacity in SPS and related technologies through grant \nprojects, which will also improve firm competitiveness. \n(v)  Maintained a stable macroeconomy through prudent fiscal policy. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n90.  The PED Program is subject to the following risks.  \n \n(i)  In transition economies, maintaining macroeconomic stability\u2013\u2013as reflected, for \nexample, in low inflation\u2013\u2013is crucial for investor confidence and private sector \n ", "   33\ngrowth. Cambodia will be particularly vulnerable to macroeconomic instability in \n2008 and 2009 due to the recent surge in inflation that may slow household \nspending,  the  global  financial  crisis  that  may  slow  foreign  direct  investment \ninflows to Cambodia, and the expected United States and European economic \nrecessions that will hurt Cambodian merchandise exports to these markets.  \n(ii)  There  may  be  weak  coordination  among  government  agencies,  leading  to \ndelayed compliance with policy measures and capacity development. By basing \nfinancial assistance and TA on completed actions derived from the Government\u2019s \nreform program, the PED Program strengthens the Government\u2019s ownership. By \nincluding policy triggers for subsequent subprograms, the PED Program offers \nthe flexibility needed to take into account changes in the external environment \nfaced  by  Cambodia  and  emerging  priority  policy  reforms.  Moreover,  the \nGovernment  has  taken  a  clear  stance  on  the  need  for  policy  adjustment  to \ndiversify the economy, as articulated in its SWAp to trade and DTIS.  \n(iii)  The capacity of agencies to implement reforms may be constrained by resources \nand other emerging priorities. The PED Program reduces this risk by limiting the \npolicy  triggers  to  a  few  high-priority,  high-impact  policy  reforms  under  the \njurisdiction of MOC and MIME and by attaching TA to each trigger and the \ncapacity development grant to strengthened SPS management systems.  \n(iv)  Vested  interests  will  resist  some  of  the  reforms.  Reforms  to  customs  and \ninstitutionalization  of  economic  governance  reforms\u2013\u2013i.e.,  regulatory  impact \nassessments\u2013\u2013are  likely  to  be  drawn-out.  However,  several  factors  mitigate \nthese risks. First, the PED strategic approach is to focus efforts on supporting the \nGovernment\u2019s initiatives and building on existing institutions. Second, reforms will \nfocus on areas with political will and some measure of capacity. This has been \ndemonstrated by MOC, which has championed trade reforms, lead the WTO \naccession  process,  and  now  leads  the  trade development  agenda  (e.g.,  the \nSWAp to trade). \n \nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n91.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Promptly  adopt  and  implement  in  a  timely  manner  the  polices  and  program \nactions indicated under subprogram 1 of the PED Program as specified in the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2) including the policy matrix, and ensure \nthat such policies and actions are sustained. \n(ii)  Actively  assist  and  support  the  PSC  to  undertake  ongoing  PED  Program \nmonitoring and evaluation by facilitating consultation with agencies and other key \nstakeholders as appropriate. \n(iii)   Keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other stakeholders on measures to \nensure effective implementation of the PED Program. \n(iv)  Give  ADB  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  relevant  studies,  proposed  policy \nchanges, and draft laws or decrees that are likely to impact on PED Program\u2019s \nobjectives and implementation.  \n(v)  Ensure sufficient project counterpart funds, including all government allocations \nfor implementation, staffing, and operation and maintenance of project facilities, \nare readily available and the submission of budgetary allocation requests are \nmade in a timely manner. These counterpart funds will be transferred to project \naccounts at the commencement of each quarter and will be supplemented each \n ", "34   \nmonth  thereafter  in  an  amount  adequate  to  cover  the  ensuing  3-month \nrequirement. \n \nIX.

The sector analysis assesses the recent performance of the private sector, and provides \nbackground for identification of issues, constraints, and threats to, as well as the Government\u2019s \npriority reforms in support of, private sector development and growth.  \n \nA.  Background \n \n2.  Cambodia\u2019s economic performance has been impressive over the last 5 years. From \n2003 to 2007, economic growth averaged around 10.5%, and the gross domestic product (GDP) \nper capita increased by over 70% to $598. Based on the $2-per-day poverty line, poverty \nincidence declined by 1.6 million persons (18%) during the same period (Figure A4.1), and \npoverty  reduction  accelerated  after  2004  when  per  capita  income  surpassed  $400.  The \neconomic  growth  has  been  supported  mainly  by  the  manufacturing,  construction,  and  the \nservice sectors. The manufacturing sector was driven by garment making, mainly for export, \nwhich  made  the  industry  vulnerable  to  external  shocks.  The  service  sector  depends  on  \ntourism-related activities; international visitors to Cambodia continue to increase, with over 2 \nmillion people traveling in 2007, generating over $1 billion in revenues. More recently, the \nconstruction sector has become fast-growing, owing to large-scale public infrastructure projects \nand an increasing demand for residential properties. Several foreign investors have also moved \nforward with major property development projects. \n \n3.  Cambodia\u2019s economy has undergone significant structural transformation since 1990, \nbut remains narrowly based, with three sectors\u2014garments, construction, and tourist-related \nservices\u2014accounting for 42% of GDP in 2007. The share of industry increased from 11% of \nGDP in 1990 to 25% in 2007, while the agriculture sector share declined from 5% to 30% during \nthe same period and the service sector expanded from 33% to 39% (Figure A4.1). Cambodia\u2019s \nstructural transformation has been dependent on a few products. Unrestricted access to the \nUnited  States  (US)  and  European  Commission  markets  from  the  early  to  late  1990s  \njump-started  the  garment  sector,  and  preferential  access  (or  less  restrictive  arrangement \nrelative to other countries) to the US market after 1999 also drove this growth. The garment \nsector accounts for 70% of the manufacturing sector (12% of GDP) and 70% of Cambodia\u2019s \nexport revenue. The ancient temples at Angkor have attracted a continuous flow of international \ntourists and became the catalyst of growth for the service sector (Figure A4.1). While the \ngarment and service sectors have attracted significant foreign direct investment in the past, \nsizeable foreign direct investment has recently moved to the construction sector (Figure A4.1). \nThis pattern of structural change is expected as an economy grows and develops; resources \nmove  from  low-productivity  activities  in  subsistence  agriculture  and  traditional  services  to \nhigher-productivity  activities  in  industry  and  other  modern  services.  This  process,  and  the \nassociated  rural-to-urban  migration  that  occurs  with  this  transformation,  contributes  to  a \nreduction in poverty. \n \n4.  The small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector dominates economic activity in \nCambodia and accounts for substantial employment. According to latest available data from \nMinistry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME), there are 31,149 small industrial SMEs with \nfewer than 50 employees. However, with so many unlicensed establishments, it is difficult to \nestimate the actual number of SMEs, especially the very small ones. Based on available data, \nfood,  beverage,  and  tobacco  manufacturers  represent  the  largest  number  (82%)  of  small \nindustrial establishments. In the past, many Cambodian SMEs were unregistered, primarily \nbecause  of  the  high  cost,  cumbersome  procedures,  and  a  lack  of  transparency  in  the \n ", "48  Appendix 4 \nregistration process. The cost of registration until mid-2004 was about $1,000 (four times per \ncapita GDP). Businesses that did register often paid facilitators to help them negotiate the \ncomplex and confusing procedures involved. In 2004, the cost of registration was cut to $177, \nand in 2007, it was cut again to $105. \n \n5.  In the short term, Cambodia\u2019s economy is vulnerable to two external developments. First, \nthe surge in domestic inflation fueled by global oil and food price inflation is impacting on the \neconomy  and  may  be  slowing  household  consumption.  Cambodia\u2019s  agriculture  sector  will \nbenefit from high international commodity prices, but at the same time, higher overall food \nprices will adversely affect the most vulnerable, in particular the urban poor and the landless. \nSecond, the expected contraction in the US and European economies is affecting garment \nexports, with exports virtually stagnant in the first quarter of 2008. Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) staff estimates suggest that fuel price increases could reduce Cambodia\u2019s economic \ngrowth rate by up to 3% in 2008 (down to 7%). Over the medium term, the garment sector will \nbe challenged by increasing regional competition in the US market, and its contribution to \neconomic growth will continue to diminish. In fact, its contribution to growth fell to 1.2% in 2007 \nfrom an average of 2.3% between 2004 and 2006. Third, the global financial crisis may slow \nforeign direct investment into Cambodia. The recent external developments also highlight that \nsustainable high growth will require diversification of the sources of growth beyond garments, \ntourism, and construction, which will also reduce Cambodia\u2019s vulnerability to external economic \nshocks. \n \n6.  Recent investment surveys and several value-chain studies have identified impediments \nto Cambodia realizing its medium-term growth potential and economic diversification. Surveys \non business climate perceptions suggest that, among other factors, regulatory uncertainty and \nexcessive red tape, remaining distortions in the trade regime, electricity costs, inadequate skills \nof the labor force, and corruption are major obstacles to private sector growth and development. \nValue-chain studies identify poor product quality, an inadequate standards and phytostandards \n(SPS) policy framework, underdeveloped links between the rural and modern sectors of the \neconomy,  and  relatively  costly  logistics  as  constraints  to  export  diversification.  A  common \nthread in many value-chain studies is Cambodia\u2019s weak competition policy framework broadly \ndefined to include remaining distortions at the border and behind the border. There are lessons \nfrom the successful sectors of garments and tourism for the development of other sectors, in \nparticular  regarding  maintaining  investor  confidence.  Cambodia  must  provide  a  predictable \npolicy  environment  for  the  sector  and  maintain  access  to  international  inputs  at  close  to \ninternational  prices.  Going  forward,  improvements  in  investor  confidence  and  policy \npredictability\u2014such as implementation of double taxation agreements\u2014would help to diversify \ninvestments. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  49\nFigure A4.1: Recent Economic Performance in Cambodia \n \n  (i) Poverty Incidence and Per Capita Income    (ii) Structural Transformation, 1990 \u2013 2007 \n              (% of population and $)                            (% of GDP) \n80 600\n70\n500 60\n60\n400 50\n50\n40\n40 300\n30\n30\n200\n20\n20\n100 10\n10\n0 0 0\n1990 1994 1996 1998 2004 2002 2004 2007\n199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007\nPovRate PCY Agriculture Industry Services\n                                                  \n                                                                                  \n    (iii) Foreign Direct Investment 2000\u20132007                        (iv) International Visitors 2000 \u2013 2007       \n                             ($ million)                                                                       (\u2018000) \n700  2500\n \n600 2000\n \n500\n1500\n \n400\n300  1000\n \n200 500\n \n100\n0\n \n0             2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n                         \n \n     (v) Garment Exports ($ billion)                                         (vi) Newly Registered Enterprises 2000\u20132007 \n          (units)        \n3.5\n3\n3500\n2.5\n3000\n2\n2500\n1.5 2000\n1500\n1\n1000\n0.5\n500\n0 0\n1995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n                  \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: National Institute of Statistics Cambodia, World Bank, Council for Development of Cambodia, and Ministry \nof Tourism. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 4 \nB.  Medium-Term Growth Issues \n \n7.  This section summarizes the key business climate impediments to private sector growth \nand economic diversification. While much progress has been done to create an enabling \nenvironment for the private sector to grow in Cambodia, much more needs to be done to lower \ntransaction costs through addressing excessive red tape, improving the investment climate, \ncompleting the unfinished trade policy agenda, and strengthening trade facilitation.  \n \n8.  Transaction costs for doing business in Cambodia are high, but much lower than they \nonce were. Cambodia continues to rank low in several international surveys of competitiveness \ndue  to  high  transaction  costs  in  the  regulatory  environment,  trade  facilitation,  and  an \nundeveloped logistics sector. Figure A4.3 shows that trade facilitation costs in Cambodia are \nhigh on a regional and international comparison. The 2007 World Bank Investment Climate \nSurvey  of  enterprises  reported  several  major  constraints  in  Cambodia,  including \nmacroeconomic instability, energy costs, regulation, labor skills, anticompetitive and informal \npractices.  \n \n9.  Business surveys in Cambodia, as well as a regional comparison, consistently indicate \nelectricity cost is a barrier to improved business competitiveness. The average tariff is about \n$0.146 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in Phnom Penh, and $0.25\u20130.80/kWh in remote areas. The \nElectricity Development Corporation continues to struggle with the high power generation costs, \nwhich  are  primarily  due  to  (i)  the  expensive  power  purchased  from  independent  power \nproducers, (ii) small-scale generation capacity, which makes electricity more expensive as \neconomies of scale are not achieved, and (iii) limited access to the capital markets. Power \nprices are relatively high given that the power supply system is dispersed and fragmented. \nExcept for Phnom Penh and some towns near the Thailand and Viet Nam borders, the supply \ntypically comes from a mini-distribution network fed by small number of diesel generators. The \nsouth electricity grid covering the capital city, Phnom Penh, is the main grid with a maximum \ndemand of about 276 megawatts. The limited power grid coverage and unreliable power supply \nhave compelled many large consumers to invest in self-generation at a very high cost and poor \nefficiency. Several development partners are assisting the government with expansion of the \nsector. The Government of Japan (JICA and JBIC), German Development Bank (KfW), the \nNordic Development Fund, People\u2019s Republic of China, and the World Bank are financing \nvarious  projects  in  hydropower  (People\u2019s  Republic  of  China),  electricity  generation, \ntransmission lines, and rural electrification.  ADB has a proposed standby loan in the 2010 \npipeline for rural electrification with the intention of adding 100km of line transmission. ADB \nstaff estimates indicate that investments in electricity, which bring domestic prices toward the \nregional average, would add up to 5% to the GDP and facilitate economic diversification.1 \nSeveral  development  partners  are  also  assisting  the  government  in  improving  road \ninfrastructure. ADB, the World Bank and several bilateral development partners are financing \nroad projects. ADB, Government of Japan and the World Bank are cofinancing the Road Asset \nManagement program of the Cambodian government.   \n \n10.  In addition, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Trade Restrictiveness Index shows that \nwhile nontariff barriers are relatively low, tariff rates are relatively restrictive compared to other \ncountries in the region. Moreover, as Cambodia begins implementing SPS, care will need to be \ntaken to ensure that there is not a proliferation of SPS-related technical barriers to trade.  \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008.

The performance of trade logistic services is critical to determine whether Cambodia can \ntrade goods and services on time and at low costs. A cross-countries study conducted by the \nWorld Bank2 suggests that high logistics costs and, more importantly, low level of services are \nbarriers to trade and hence, growth. Available indicators suggest that Cambodian businesses \nbear higher cost of logistics than other countries in the region. The logistics performance index \nranks Cambodia above most countries in the region, meaning it is less efficient. This index is \ndeveloped based on a comprehensive survey of supply chain performance, including customs \nprocedures, logistic costs, infrastructure quality, timeliness of reaching destination, and the \ncompetence of the domestic logistics industry. \n \n12.  The Government has taken several steps to streamline import\u2013export procedures. As a \nresult, days required to process document for imports and exports, as well as costs to export \nper container, have declined. However, Cambodia is still significantly behind other countries in \nthe  region  in  terms  of  import\u2013export  times  and  costs  (Figure  A4.3).  More  recently,  the \nGovernment implemented important reforms to further improve trade facilitation, including (i) \nintroduction of a single administrative document, (ii) the pilot ASYCUDA3 in Sihanoukville, which \nis expected to be rolled out to four other major ports accounting for 80% of trade by the end of \n2008, (iii) passage of the new customs law, and (iv) a risk management unit at the Customs & \nExcise  Department\u2019s  central  office.  While  these  reforms  are  still  in  early  phases  of \nimplementation, full implementation of the single administrative document and ASYCUDA will \nfacilitate trade, improve transparency of trade-related procedures, and reduce costs for the \nprivate sector. \n                                                 \n2 World Bank. 2007.

SPS are key to microeconomic infrastructure, improving the private sector\u2019s access to \nthe international market for agro-based and fish products. Improving SPS management systems \nand capacity to administer SPS is crucial to lowering the high incidence of food- and water-\nrelated diseases and to create confidence in the tourist-related food sector. Much has been \ndone in the last 2 years to improve SPS management related to food products. The Government \nhas  passed  a  standards  law,  issued  a  decree  to  establish  the  Institute  of  Standards  of \nCambodia (ISC), and upgraded laboratory testing at MIME and Camcontrol. An interministerial \ncommittee has been established to oversee policy developments in the sector. However, the \nGovernment recognizes that further reforms are required, including: (i) strengthening the SPS \nframework for effective SPS management; (ii) improved SPS regulation related to food and \nwater;  and  (iii)  capacity  development  for  effective  management  systems  such  as  further \nupgrading  of  laboratories  (at  MIME  and  Camcontrol),  assisting  with  the  laboratories\u2019 \nInternational  Organization  for  Standardization  accreditation  so  that  tests  are  internationally \nrecognized, procuring equipment and rapid diagnostic tools, and training staff. \n \n14.  There  are  three  major  weaknesses  linked  to  SPS  in  Cambodia.  First,  several \ngovernment agencies are involved in SPS-related matters at different points in the supply chain. \nWhile this is common in many countries, Cambodia duplicates functions, which add costs and \nuncertainty  for  the  private  sector.  For  example,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and \nFisheries; Camcontrol; and the Ministry of Health carry out similar inspections of food related \nproducts at the border. Thus, it is important that the different agencies clarify functions to \nminimize duplication. Second, the Government has established ISC, which is mandated to \nproduce SPS and to establish a body to accredit assessors that certify product and process \nSPS in the private sector. This accreditation body has not yet been established, and best \ninternational practices indicate that it should be separate from ISC to avoid a conflict of interest. \nThird, there is limited participation of private sector in providing SPS-related services to the \nmarket. To a certain extent, this is due to the underdeveloped market for SPS-related services \nin  Cambodia,  which  in  turn  is  influenced  by  the  inadequate  legislative  framework.  Larger \nCambodian firms have overcome these obstacles by hiring assessors from Thailand, US, and \nViet Nam to certify SPS; however, this approach is expensive for SMEs. It is important that SPS \n ", "Appendix 4  53\nreforms and capacity development efforts promote private sector participation through eventual \naccreditation of private sector assessors and privately-owned laboratories. It is also important \nthat regional competition in this sector remains in Cambodia. \n \n15.  Existing public sector providers of SPS-related services, such as the laboratories and \ninspection agencies, have limited capacity to provide effective services to the private sector. \nThis arises due to constrained budgets and inadequate equipment. The new MIME testing \nlaboratory was built by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, but its budget \nfunded under MIME is considered inadequate to provide services to the private sector. Best \ninternational  practices  suggest  that  laboratories  should  be  commercialized  and  fiscally \nautonomous or even privatized. Similarly, the newly established ISC, also funded under the \nMIME budget, produces SPS, which can be commercialized as has occurred in many other \ncountries. \n \n16.  The majority of investors surveyed in the 2007 World Bank Investment Climate Survey \nconsidered access to finance and the cost of finance not to be major obstacles to their growth\u2014\nonly 15% of businesses thought the cost of finance was a major constraint and only 10% of \nbusiness considered access to finance a problem. Data on loan growth and interest rates \nappear to corroborate the findings of the survey and demonstrate that progress has been made \nin improving financial intermediation and efficiency. The number of Cambodians that have \naccessed  bank  or  microfinance  loans  has  increased  80%  since  2004,  from  0.5  million \ncustomers to 0.9 million by 2007. Credit to the private sector expanded 80% in 2007 and by \n107% in April 2008. Consequently, loans to the GDP increased from 8.5% of GDP in 2004 to \n18.5% of GDP by 2007 (Figure A4.4). Although a large proportion of recent credit growth are \nallocated  to  construction,  real  estate,  and  personal  consumption,  the  share  of  lending  to \nagriculture also increased significantly to 5.0% from 2.8% in 2005. Lending from microfinance \ninstitutes has also increased by 500% since 2004, with minimum nonperforming loans. Most of \nthis lending is allocated to agriculture sector in rural areas. On the cost of lending, nominal \ninterest rates have been declining toward the regional average. Currently, dollar lending rates \nare in the range of 15% per year, down 1% from a year earlier. Interest rates on riel loans \n(which account for about 10% of total loans) are in the range of 20% to 25% per year, which are \nnot out of line with regional rates. In Indonesia and Thailand, interest rates on small business \nloans range between 11% and 15% (in local currency), and in the Philippines, the average rate \nis about 12%. The average interest margin in the Cambodian banking sector has also declined \n1% in the last 12 months to 11%, although it remains relatively high in the region. Increased \ncompetition  in  the  commercial  banking  sector  and  improvements  in  intermediation  have \ncontributed to the gradual decline in lending rates. Much of the new competition has come from \nlocally-incorporated branches of foreign banks, which have been aggressive in pricing their way \ninto the local market.  \n \n17.  Still, Cambodia has one of the lowest rates of banking intermediation in the world. \nVarious obstacles constrained credit expansion, but key among them was weak legal framework \nfor commercial and banking activities, which caused a generally high credit risk in the economy. \nMoreover, the payments system is underdeveloped, primarily because Cambodia remains in \ntransition from a devastated economy in the 1980s (brought about by the civil war in the 1970s) \nto a modern market economy. Its institutions and the capacity to support them are still evolving \nand developing. Nevertheless, the Government has made significant progress in addressing \nthese constraints. On the supply side, the Government, with assistance of ADB\u2019s Financial \nSector Development Program, has established financial sector development framework to (i) \nstrengthen banking supervision; (ii) support money and interbank market development; (iii) \nestablish a legal framework in support of corporate borrowing, including a body of civil and \n ", "54  Appendix 4 \ncommercial laws and a system for secured transactions and accounting standards; (iv) support \nfor insurance sector reforms; and (v) enhance investment in long-term development of human \ncapacity through training institutes and professional associations. On the supply side, under an \nADB SME development loan, the Government has enacted the Secured Transaction Law, \nestablished a credit information system, and introduced a simplified financial reporting template \nfor SMEs. To improve the availability of collateral, the Government, with the assistance of the \nWorld Bank and the Governments of Finland and Germany, has also introduced systematic land \nregistration. The geographical coverage of systematic land registration has expanded from 11 to \n15 provinces and municipalities. \n \n18.  The Government has outlined the following strategy, supported by the PED Program, to \nimprove business environment and enhance trade facilitation:  \n \n(i)  The  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  and  MIME  will  formulate  action  plans  to \ninstitutionalize a RIA in their ministries. OBSESS will provide oversight to the \nregulatory process ensuring its sustainability. \n(ii)  World Trade Organization economic, trade, and legal reforms will be prioritized, \nand  implementation  issues  will  be  addressed,  laying  the  foundation  for  \nlonger-term capacity development assistance under the PED Program. \n(iii)  On SPS, the Government has established an interministerial committee to set the \nbroad policy framework and to improve coordination among agencies, issued \nseveral decrees establishing new institutions to administer SPS, and upgraded \nthe regulatory framework. The Government will prepare several SPSs-related \nagencies for commercialization to ensure financial sustainability, among other \nmeasures.  The  PED  Program  will  provide  technical  assistance  to  the \nGovernment to support its SPS reform agenda.  \n(iv)  The PED Program will provide technical assistance to prepare an action plan for \nimplementing customs transaction valuation commitments under the World Trade \nOrganization.  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 4  55\nFigure A4.4: Banking Sector Indicators \n \n      (i)   Bank Loans and Deposits to GDP Ratio                   (ii) Domestic Credit to Private Sector \u2013 Regional \n     2004 to 2007                Comparison in 2007 \n        (%)            (%) \nPhilippines\n30  Indonesia\n25 \nThailand\n20 \n15  Viet Nam\n10  Lao PDR\n5\nCambodia\n0\n2004  2005  2006 2007 0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n% of GDP\nLoans to GDP Deposits to GDP\n        \n   \n    (iii) Interest Rates and Spreads on Loans and             (iv) Interest Rate Spreads - Regional Comparison    \n         Deposits in Cambodia 2008                                     in 2006  \n                                          (%)                           (%)                           \n18  14\n16  12\n14  10\n12  8\nLoans\n10  6\nDeposits\n8 4\nSpread\n6 2\n4 0\n02 2006 2007 Cambodia Indonesia Lao PDR Malaysia Philippines Thailand Viet Nam\n            \nGDP = gross domestic product, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSources: National Bank of Cambodia and central banks of various countries. \n     \n ", "56  Appendix 5 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS 2 \nMACROECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT \n \n1.  This assessment provides a summary of developments in macroeconomic policy. It also \npresents a summary assessment of debt sustainability. \n \n2.  The immediate pressing issue is the acceleration in domestic price inflation and its \npotential impact on growth conditions in Cambodia and its poor. While much has been done to \nput fiscal policy on a sound path, critical issues that face the Government over the medium term \ninclude further efforts to raise revenues, improving efficiency in public expenditure management, \nstrengthening debt management systems, and managing potential oil revenues. Important risks \ninclude weaker external demand and heightened regional competition for Cambodia\u2019s main \nexport commodities. The Government has outlined measures to address inflation and has a \nfiscal sustainability strategy supported by Asian Development Bank (ADB) programs.   \n \nA.  Inflation \n \n3.  After remaining in single digits in the previous years, inflation rose significantly starting in \nSeptember  2007.  From  an  average  of  3.9%  from  December  2002  to  2006,  year-on-year \nconsumer price inflation1 surged to 10.8% in December 2007 and 25.7% in May 2008. The data \nsuggest that inflation pressures have eased since June, but inflation remained high at 22.3% in \nJuly. \n \n4.  The sharp increase in inflation reflects both external shocks and domestic pressures. \nAvailable data suggests that three factors contributed to Cambodia\u2019s surge in domestic inflation \nsince the fourth quarter of 2007. First, the surge in global oil and food prices quickly transmitted \nto domestic food inflation [Figure A5.1(i) and (ii)]. Second, the depreciation of the riel and the \nUnited States (US) dollar against the currencies of Cambodia's other major trading partners \nadded to imported inflation. Third, there were signs that the domestic economy was beginning to \noverheat in 2007. Tentative evidence indicates that aggregate domestic demand was beginning \nto significantly diverge from its potential growth path in part fueled by very high growth in \ncommercial bank lending [Figure A5.1 (iii) and (iv)]. Broad money grew at 61% year-on-year in \nDecember 2007 due to large capital inflows, and credit to the private sector expanded at a \nrecord level of 76%. Credit growth to the private sector has moderated, expanding by 35% from \nJanuary to July 2008.  \n \n5.  Responding to increasing inflationary pressure, the Government announced a policy \npackage in April 2008. On the monetary side, the National Bank of Cambodia would double \nbanks\u2019 reserve requirements from 8% to 16%, facilitate banks with strong finances to invest \nabroad, strengthen supervision, and provide guidelines to reduce bank lending to high-risk \nsectors, especially real estate. On the fiscal side, the Government will maintain the balance of \nthe national budget as stated in the Public Financial Management Law and Reform Program. At \nthe same time, the Government will try its best to increase its deposits in the banking system \nand mobilize revenue more than budgeted. Consideration is also given to reducing import tariffs \non basic goods while balancing the loss revenue against increased taxes on luxury goods. The \npackage also includes other measures, such as: (i) fixing indirect taxes to hold down the \ndomestic price of petrol, (ii) providing a financing provision for the rice industry to increase \nproduction, (iii) reducing government consumption of fuel and electricity, (iv) lifting an import ban \non pork, (v) suspending the 1% minimum tax on the garment industry to finance increases in \n                                                 \n1  Price inflation is measured by the Phnom Penh Retail Price Index. \n ", "Appendix 5  57\nworkers\u2019 wages for 3 years, (vi) increasing salaries and allowances to government officials, the \narmed forces, and retirees by 20%, and (viii) providing fuel subsidies to the electricity company \nto maintain electricity prices. \n \n6.  While  the  package  contains  several  key  elements,  its  implementation  could  be \nstrengthened in many areas. ADB staff study suggests that a large part of inflationary pressures \ncan be explained by trading partners\u2019 inflation, which will not be eased by domestic policy action. \nHowever,  second-round  effects  and  domestically  sourced  inflation  will  require  swift  action. \nUnder  the  current  dollarized  economy,  maintaining  a  prudent  fiscal  stance  is  essential  to \nmoderating inflation pressures. A clear target to limit the overall budget deficit to around 1% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 and to continue to accumulate government deposits in \nthe National Bank of Cambodia above its current level of 6% of the GDP to about 8% is key to \ncontain inflation pressures. This will require ongoing strong revenue efforts and restraining \nnonpriority recurrent spending to finance additional spending from announced measures. The \nGovernment should also safeguard priority spending and make room for targeted measures to \nprotect the poor within a prudent fiscal envelope. The decision to tighten monetary policy to \ncomplement  fiscal  prudence  is  appropriate  to  rein  in  very  high  credit  growth,  but  its \nimplementation could be accelerated. Measures such as cutting taxes or increasing subsidies \nare unlikely to address the inflation problem and are not recommended as they reduce budget \nrevenues at a time when creating fiscal space is important for priority spending. Moreover, these \nare poorly targeted measures if intended to alleviate costs to the vulnerable poor.  \n \nB.  Fiscal Policy \n \n7.  Fiscal policy has remained prudent and has tightened in recent years. The overall deficit \nnarrowed significantly from over 7.0% in 2002 to 2.7% 2007 (Table A9), with the improvement \nreflected  in  the  current  balance  (i.e.,  current  expenditures  less  current  revenues).  The \nGovernment made a substantial progress in mobilizing revenue in 2007. Tax collection was up \n2.2% of GDP from 8.0% in 2006, owing to improved tax administration, increased trade volume, \nand continued strong economic growth. Indirect tax and international tax collection were up by \n0.9 and 0.7%, respectively. With routine expenditures contained, the current budget surplus was \nalso higher than budgeted (3.2% versus 1.2% budgeted), indicating prudent fiscal policy. As in \nthe past years, overall deficit in Cambodia remains negative at 2.8% of GDP due to the large \ncapital expenditure needs (around 6.0% of GDP). The deficit is more than financed by foreign \naid, which tends to be stable around 4.5\u20135% of GDP. Net domestic financing is generally \nnegative and has tended to widen, reflecting the Government\u2019s efforts to tighten policies by \nincreasing government deposits in the National Bank of Cambodia. Relative to the actual fiscal \nposition in 2007, the planned 2008 budget is slightly expansionary in that it projects an increase \nin the overall budget deficit and a reduction in the current surplus. This arises from lower \nprojected revenues at 10.2% of the GDP, which is lower than the actual revenue of 12.1% in \n2007, and not from an expansion in spending, which is projected to remain constant at 14.2%. \nThis reflects both a conservative stance of the Government in budget preparation and weakness \nin revenue projections. \n ", "58  Appendix 5 \n \nFigure A5.1: Inflation in Cambodia \n \n  (i) Contribution to Inflation 2005\u20132008 (%)                    (ii) International Food Inflation (%) \nContribution to Inflation: 2002-2008 International Food Inflation 2005-2008\n(in percent) \n30\n80\nFood Housing&Utilities Transport Other\n25 70\n60\n20 50\n40\n15\n30\n10 20\n10\n5\n0\n0 J-1un0-05Sep-05Dec-05 Mar-06Jun-06Sep-06Dec-06 Mar-07Jun-07Sep-07Dec-07Mar-08\nDec-Jun-Dec-Jun-Dec-Jun-Dec- Jun-Dec-Jun-Dec-Jun-\n-5\n02 03 03 04 04 05 05 06 06 07 07 08\n               \n \n  (iii) Cambodia\u2019s GDP and Potential GDP (GDPP)     (iv) Monetary Developments 2004\u20132007 (%) \n                               (Riel billions)                     \n80\n30000 \n60\n25000 \n40\n20000 \n20\n15000 \n0\n10000  Dec-04 Jun-05 Dec-05 Jun-06 Dec-06 Jun-07Dec-07\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\nExcess Reserves % Deposit\nM2 Growth (in percent) \nGDP  GDPP  Credit Growth (in percent) \n            \n \n  Sources: National Institute of Statistics Cambodia.

Considerable fiscal gains have been achieved since 2003, and fiscal space has been \nprovided from increase tax revenues since then, but it will be important to build on these gains \nover the medium term. Three major medium-term issues are (i) increasing tax revenues, (ii) \nimproving public expenditure management, and (iii) strengthening debt management systems. \n \n ", "Appendix 5  59\n9.  Issue 1: Increased Tax Revenues for Sustainable Priority Spending. Cambodia\u2019s tax \nrevenue ratio is still low compared with other countries at similar stages of development (Figure \nA5.2). Increasing fiscal revenue over the medium term will be necessary to meet the country\u2019s \nexpenditure needs. The Government\u2019s expenditure policy aims to improve public services and \nto  increase  investment.  Currently,  as  capital  expenditure  has  been  largely  financed  by \ndevelopment partners, domestic revenue will need to take a larger role going forward. To \nimprove service delivery and to discourage corruption, the Government has also recognized the \nneed to steadily raise public sector wages, as allowed by increase revenue. \n \n10.  Issue  2:  Improving  Governance  in  Public  Expenditure  Management.  The 2003 \nIntegrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review (IFAPER) determined that the \nfiduciary risk in the use and management of public funds was high. As a consequence, the \nGovernment developed and began implementing a medium-term public financial management \nreform program (PFMRP) from 2004\u20132015, supported by development partners. The PFMRP \naims to complete the full modernation of Cambodia\u2019s public financial management system by \n2015  in  four  successive  stages:  (i)  ensuring  that  the  budget  is  a  credible  instrument  for \nimplementing  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy,  (ii)  introducing  effective  financial \naccountability, (iii) improving the links of priorities and service targets to budget planning and \nimplementation, and (iv) holding budget managers accountable. The PFMRP includes both \ninstitutional  and  policy  reforms  to  modernize  the  public  finance  management  system  in \nCambodia. At the same time, it will also address the medium-term challenges to improve \nrevenue collections. Significant progress has been made in the last 2 years, including through \nthe introduction of the new chart of accounts and program budgets in priority sectors. Authorities \nhave  also  begun  to  advance  cash  management  reforms  that  should  significantly  improve \nexpenditure  efficiency.  Much  remains  to  be  done,  however,  particularly  in  rationalizing \ngovernment bank accounts and increasing use of the banking system. The second phase is \ncommencing in 2008 with support from ADB through its proposed Public Financial Management \nfor Rural Development (PFMRD) program cluster. \nFigure A5.2: Tax Revenues to GDP - Regional Comparison \n(%)\n20 \n18 \n16 \n14 \n12 \n10 \n8 \n6 \n4 \n2 \n0 \nCambodia  Lao PDR  Viet Nam Thailand Indonesia  Philippines\nGDP = gross domestic product, Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: International Monetary Fund. \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 5 \n11.  Issue  3:  Debt  Sustainability.  With continued fiscal prudence and strong economic \ngrowth, public debt is projected to be sustainable over the medium term. Public debt declined \nfrom 34% of GDP in 2006 to 27% in 2007. The continued strong economic growth anticipated in \nthe medium and long term places debt on a sustainable path. Cambodia\u2019s debt structure is not \ncomplicated. It is almost entirely external and concessional with relatively long maturities. There \nis virtually no domestic debt and no external commercial borrowing. However, moderate risks do \nremain, particularly given the current low level of government revenues, the continued existence \nof external arrears and the potential for contingent liabilities. Part of these risks will be mitigated \nif the recent progress in revenue collection continues over the medium term. On contingent \nliabilities, currently only the minister of economy and finance can issue loan guarantees, which \nare  currently  very  small.  The  Government  will  avoid  providing  any substantial guarantees. \nDespite the recently acquired sovereign credit ratings as confirmation of their sound polices, the \nGovernment does not intend to borrow on commercial terms from capital markets in the near \nfuture. However, the Government does anticipate a more complicated debt structure as the \neconomy develops and it begins to source financing from other sources beyond overseas \ndevelopment assistance. ADB has provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Economy \nand Finance to develop a debt management office and systems. The proposed PFMRD will \nadvance this work, including producing a debt management strategy and capacity development \nof staff in the office. \n \n12.  The Government has outlined a medium-term strategy to support sustainable adjustment \nin fiscal policy supported by ADB programs, including the PED Program, and development \npartners: \n \n(i)  Completed the first phase of the PFMRP and will rollout the second phase in \n2008 with support from the proposed PFMRD. The PFMRP also includes efforts \nto increase revenues through increase tax efficiency and effort. \n(ii)  Further strengthen its debt management office under the proposed PFMRD. \n(iii)  MEF will continue with current surpluses and to accumulate government deposits \nin the National Bank of Cambodia above its current level of 6% of the GDP. \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 6  61\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Cambodia/Promoting Economic Diversification Program \n \nProject/Sector/Multitrache Financing  Southeast Asia Department/ \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nFacility/Policy-Based, Other (please  Governance, Finance, and Trade \nModality: ADF Loan  Division: \nspecify) Sector Development Program  Division \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government adopted the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2006\u20132010, which contains its strategies \nto reduce poverty and to achieve other Millennium Development Goals. The NSDP places private sector development \nand employment creation at the center of the Government\u2019s reform agenda, aiming to (i) strengthen the private sector \nand attract investment, (ii) promote small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), (iii) create jobs, and (iv) enhance \nsocial safety nets. Fully aligned with the NSDP, ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for 2006\u20132009 [footnote 4] \nemphasizes poverty reduction by accentuating broader-based, private sector-led, inclusive social development, and \nstronger governance for sustainable development. The proposed Promoting Economic Diversification Program (PED) \nwill support the broad priorities of the Government\u2019s private sector and SME development agenda, covering three \nareas: (i) macroeconomic stability for private sector development and growth, (ii) investment climate and competition \npolicy,  and  (iii)  trade  policy,  capacity,  and  facilitation.  Over  the  medium  term,  the  PED  Program  will  facilitate \nmacroeconomic stability and diversification of the sources of growth beyond the garment, tourism, and construction \nsectors. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe impressive economic growth over the last decade has raised living standards and reduced the poverty headcount \nin Cambodia. Per capita income has almost doubled from around $300 in 2002 to $600 in 2007. With an increased \nliving standard, poverty incidence\u2014measured using the $2-a-day benchmark\u2014has also declined significantly from 68% \nto 51% in 2007. However, Cambodia\u2019s poverty incidence remains one of the highest in the region, owing to the \ncountry\u2019s early stage of development. Available data from survey results show that poverty incidence is more severe in \nrural areas, because economic growth has been based on garment exports, tourism, and construction, which are \nprimarily in urban sectors. This highlights the need to diversify the economy beyond these sectors and to develop \ndomestic trade and backward links to rural agriculture. \n \nTable A6.1: Per Capita Income and Poverty Incidence 2002\u20132007 \nItem  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nPer Capita Income ($)  308.4  347.9  390.8  450.6  512.2  598.4 \nPoverty Incidence (headcount index %)             \n     $1-a day  23.7  18.9  19.0  12.4  10.6  9.3 \n     $2-a day  68.1  64.6  63.9  56.2  53.1  50.5 \nSources: Asian Development Outlook and World Bank East Asia Outlook April 2008  \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nPrivate sector development and growth is crucial for sustained poverty reduction, as it will be the major generator of \njobs and incomes in the future. This is particularly true in Cambodia, where almost 50% of the population is under the \n20 years old and more than 85% of employment is in informal activities (mainly subsistence agriculture). Removing \nregulatory constraints and uncertainties hindering private sector investment and creating new businesses is crucial. \nRegulatory compliance and transaction costs, which are more burdensome on SMEs, have constrained dynamic \ngrowth of SMEs by keeping most of them unregistered. The Government has made progress in the areas of business \nregistration, trade facilitation, and private sector access to finance, but further reforms in key areas are needed to \nstrengthen the business environment. \n \nThe staff study to evaluate the benefits of the proposed reforms using a general equilibrium model for Cambodia\u2019s \neconomy suggests a significant gain in the medium term. The combined welfare effects of an average 50% cut in \ntransaction costs (informal) and a 50% across-the-board deduction in the effective rates of tariff are about 2.4% of the \ngross domestic product (GDP) over the medium term. The proposed reforms would also generate about 5% additional \n ", "62  Appendix 6 \nemployment opportunities over the medium term. Since the gender mix of employment in Cambodia\u2019s private sector is \nrelatively balanced, the gender impacts of the reforms are expected to be balanced, with female employment rising by \n6.3%. The reforms are also found to be pro-poor. Using the headcount index, these combined poverty impacts are \nabout a 2.7% reduction (para. 63 in main text).  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThere are no foreseen social risks associated with the PED Program. Indirect social impacts include improvements in \nthe quality and quantity of public services and governance through more transparent, predictable, and accountable \npublic resource management. The Program has been assigned as a category C in terms of impact on indigenous \npeople. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nAs part of the Program process, a wide range of stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society groups, and \ndevelopment partners, was consulted. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision-making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues \n  \nThe PED Program has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on macroeconomic stability and trade facilitation \nto reducing transaction costs. The improved investment climate will steadily increase the number of SMEs and \nemployment in the private sector. Available data from the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs suggest that the composition of \nemployment in the private sector is relatively gender balanced at 50.8% for women and 49.2% for men (Table A6.2). \nTherefore, the gender impacts of the PED Program are expected to be balanced (see para. 63 in main text). \n \nTable A6.2: Women\u2019s and Men\u2019s Share in Types of Primary Employment \n(%) \n    Non-                \n  Local  farm  Farm  Private  Dom    FG and  State  Govern  \nItem  NGO  SE  Worker  Com  Servant  JV  NGO  Ent.  ment  Other \nWomen  57.1  54.0  51.6  50.8  42.8  41.7  28.6  24.2  21.5  50 \nMan  42.9  46.0  48.4  49.2  57.2  58.3  71.4  75.8  78.5  50 \nNote: SE = self employed, Com = company, FG = foreign government, JV = joint venture, NGO = nongovernment \norganization, Ent = enterprise.  \nSource: Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs \n \n2.

Introduction \n \n1.  To  support  the  implementation  of  the  Promoting  Economic  Diversification  (PED) \nProgram,  an  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  is  proposed  to  support  capacity \ndevelopment and implementation of policy triggers under subprogram 2, Enhancing Private \nSector Competitiveness.  \n \n2.  The objectives of the TA are threefold: (i) to support the Ministry of Commerce (MOC); \nMinistry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME); and Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) in \nimplementing and monitoring the impact of key policy reforms; (ii) to broaden and deepen the \ninvestment and trade policy and facilitation reform agenda; and (iii) to assist with strengthening \ncapacity of the Executing Agency (EA) and implementing agencies (IAs) to produce sector \npolicies. The scope of the TA parallels the PED Program, covering principally the non-sanitary \nand -phytosanitary standard (SPS)-related triggers and milestones for subprogram 2.  \n \n3.  The challenge for the Government is to accelerate the creation of productive jobs to \nsustain Cambodia\u2019s already remarkable reduction in poverty\u2014a difficult task with as much as \n50% of the population under the age of 20 years and over 85% of employment in the informal \nsector.  Key  to  sustaining  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  is  the  expansion  and \ndiversification of the private sector. With such expansion, Cambodia can benefit from greater \nintegration with neighboring economies, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \nand the rest of the world. Recent surveys and several value-chain studies identify weaknesses \nin Cambodia\u2019s investment climate and trade regime that are impeding the country from realizing \nits potential. These include regulatory uncertainty and excessive red tape, remaining distortions \nin  the  trade  regime,  costly  trade  facilitation,  inadequate  SPS  management  systems, \nanticompetitive and informal practices, and limited access to technology and innovations. Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff estimates suggest that lowering the transaction costs of doing \nbusiness and trading by half could add $200 million to the economy over the medium term.  \n \n4.  The TA supports a core element of the Government\u2019s private sector reform agenda. \nUnder  the PED  Program,  the  Government  is  committed  to  lowering  transaction  costs  and \nimproving certainty for investors. It established a sector-wide approach to mainstream trade in \neconomic policy and sketched out a medium-term strategy as articulated in its diagnostic trade \nintegration  study.  These  include  regulatory  reform,  trade  policy  reforms,  enhancing  trade \nfacilitation  through  customs  reforms,  and  strengthening  SPS  management  systems.  The \nGovernment  is  also  increasing  its  efforts  to  complete  implementation  of  its  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  accession  commitments,  which  will  influence  the  way  in  which  the \nGovernment conducts trade policy over the medium term. In this regard, MOC has established \nthe  WTO  Department  responsible  for  ensuring  consistency  between  domestic  policy  and \nobligations made under WTO accession, and notifying WTO of tariff barriers to trade and SPSs \nthat may affect trade. This TA also complements other activities of other development partners, \nincluding the Australian Agency for International Development, European Commission, German \nAgency for Technical Cooperation, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations \nIndustrial  Development  Organization,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development, \nWorld  Bank,  and  World  Health  Organization.  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  development \npartners in preparing the TA and will continue to do so during implementation to ensure efficient \nuse of resources.  \n \n \n ", "72  Appendix 9 \nB.  The Technical Assistance \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n5.   The TA will support the PED Program by (i) providing the Government with assistance to \nimplement key policy measures under the cluster; (ii) providing timely economic policy analysis \nand advice on trade policy formulation, trade facilitation, competition policy, and technology \npolicy; and (iii) strengthening the Government\u2019s institutional capacity to deepen the private \nsector reform agenda.  \n \n6.  The impacts of the TA are an improved business climate that will reduce business \ntransaction costs and help to expand and diversify the private sector and exports, contribute to \nhigher  economic  growth,  create  jobs,  and  reduce  poverty  targeted  under  Cambodia\u2019s \nMillennium Development Goals.   \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The key TA activities are divided into five components: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Trade and competition policy capacity development. The IA \nwill be MOC. This component will support trade policy capacity development at \nMOC, including assisting in capacity development at the new WTO Department \n(e.g., developing internal procedures for notification, preparation for WTO\u2019s TPR, \ntrade policy analysis, procurement of equipment), developing trade remedies at \nMOC,  and  supporting  development  and  adoption  of  a  competition  policy \nframework.  The  component  will  include  a  series  of  case  studies  on \nanticompetitive practices in sectors believed to have them and proposing reform \nmeasures. The component will also include training staff at MOC and relevant \nline ministries on competition policy issues and will oversee the rollout of the \nenterprise registry to selected provinces. \n(ii)  Component 2: Develop and implement RIA action plans. The IAs will be \nMOC; MIME; and the Economic, Social Affairs and Culture Observation Unit \n(OBSESS). This component will support MOC and MIME to implement action \nplans for regulatory review and to strengthen OBSESS\u2019s capacity in this area. \nActivities include utilizing a management change expert to develop a suitable RIA \nimplementation  strategy,  providing  training  on  toolkits,  and  assisting  with \ndeveloping  RIA  internal  guidelines.  This  component\u2019s  activities  at  OBSESS \ninclude. staff training on RIA and toolkits and developing IT system for archiving \nlaws and regulations, ,.  \n(iii)  Component 3: Access to technology. The IA will be MIME. This component \nwill  assist  MIME  to  develop  a  technology  policy  framework  that  will  trigger \nimplementation of the technology matching grants project in subprogram 2. \n (iv)  Component 4: Investment incentives. The IA will be MEF. This component will \nsupport  MEF  in  enhancing  the  investment  incentives  regime  and  protection \nthrough designing frameworks for double taxation agreements and advocating \ntheir adoption as part of the Government\u2019s investment regime.  \n(v)  Component  5:  Customs  reforms.  The  IA  will  be  the  Customs  &  Excise \nDepartment at MEF. This component will work with the department to strengthen \ncapacity of the risk management unit (e.g., provide training on risk analysis) and \nundertake a study on Cambodia\u2019s readiness to join the Kyoto Convention.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  73 \n3.  Cost and Financing \n8.  The proposed TA grant is estimated to cost a total of $960,000, of which ADB will \nprovide $800,000. It is proposed that the TA will be financed under ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund. The Government will provide the remaining $160,000 through counterpart staff \nand other facilities. The TA will establish a project implementation unit at MOC to assist with \nimplementation and monitoring of reform measures and activities under the PED Program \n(Table A9).  \n \nTable A9: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \u2013 Enhancing Private Sector Competitiveness \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Total Cost \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n9.  MOC will be the EA for the TA. The TA will commence on or about 1 March 2009, and \nbe  completed  about  24  months  thereafter,  coinciding  with  preparation  of  the  second \nsubprogram  in  2010.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  individually  by  ADB.  Equipment  under \ncomponents (i) and (iii) will be procured by consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). A total of 63 person-months (26 international \nand 37 national) will be required (6 international consultants and 4 national consultants). One \nother national consultant (a total of 18 person-months) will be hired to provide administrative \nsupport to the project implementation unit for the duration of the TA. Equipment procured under \nthe TA will be handed over to the EA upon completion of the TA. \n \n ", "74  Appendix 9 \n10.   The consultants will be responsible for providing reports and deliverables as required \nunder their terms of references. Each component will produce a final report on activities.
