THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Financial Sector and Fiscal Management Improvement Program, \nand (ii) a proposed policy-based grant to the Republic of Tajikistan for subprogram 1 of the \nFinancial Sector and Fiscal Management Improvement Program. \n2.  The proposed program aims to support the government\u2019s efforts to accelerate sustainable \nprivate sector growth by creating a more stable financial system, increasing access to financial \nservices, and improving fiscal management. The program will accomplish this by building on long-\nstanding support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for government-led reforms to expand \neconomic opportunities and develop the private sector.1 The programmatic approach, with one \nsubprogram in 2020 and one in 2022, recognizes that reforms of this nature are complex and \nrequire strong ownership from the government and a medium-term horizon. The approach (i) \nallows a degree of flexibility in aligning policy actions with macroeconomic conditions; and (ii) \nsupports institutional capacity development, allowing for the implementation of policies, laws, and \nregulations methodically and chronologically. The key reforms will be delivered through a set of \npolicy actions sequenced in two subprograms, with subprogram 2 building on the progress made \nunder subprogram 1. Subprogram 1 consists of  12 policy actions, all of which have been \naccomplished. Subprogram 1 focuses on formulation of the sector policy and guidelines, and \nchanging institutional structure to build the foundation for substantive reforms to improve banking \nsector stability, financial sector oversight and development, as well as fiscal management. \nSubprogram 2 will align these policy and institutional reforms to the country\u2019s legal and regulatory \nframework, and support implementation of financial sector development strategy and fiscal \nmanagement improvement policies. The targets and indicators for each reform will be tracked \nthrough the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The programmatic approach has a \nresults orientation, where upstream reforms are followed by effective downstream implementation \nand monitoring. \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n3.  Development  context.  Tajikistan\u2019s  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  at  an \naverage  of  7.2%  in  2016\u20132019,  driven  mainly  by  substantial  foreign  and  domestic  public \ninvestment,  remittance-funded  consumption,  and  services.  However,  the  economy  remains \nvulnerable to external shocks because of its narrow export base and high dependence on \nremittance inflows, mainly from the Russian Federation, which amounted to 33.4% of the $8.2 \nbillion GDP in 2019.2 Economic vulnerabilities are exacerbated by (i) a fragile banking sector \nineffective in performing financial intermediation, (ii) the country\u2019s close correlation with the \nRussian Federation\u2019s business cycle, (iii) a less-developed private sector, and (iv) weak fiscal \nmanagement. Challenges in the financial sector, including a high level of nonperforming loans \n(NPLs), weak macroprudential oversight, prevalence of state-owned commercial banks, lack of a \nsector development strategy, and an underdeveloped domestic bond market, dominate the \nchallenges in economic management. These factors impair not only economic development and \npoverty reduction but also the efficiency of public investment. \n4.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is causing significant socioeconomic \nshock to Tajikistan. Key transmission mechanisms include the abrupt reduction in remittances, \n \n1  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n   \n ", "2 \ninternational trade, and foreign direct investment; and slowdowns in transport, tourism, retail, and \nfinance industries. ADB forecasts that GDP will contract by 0.5% in 2020.3 International Monetary \nFund (IMF) also forecasts in September 2020, economic growth will decelerate sharply from 7.5% \nof GDP in 2019 to 1.0% in 2020. The fiscal deficit declined to 2.1% of GDP in 2019 but is expected \nto increase to 6.0% in 2020 because of substantial losses in revenues, which dropped by 2.2% \n \nof GDPduring the first half of 2020, and the need to accommodate additional expenditure to fund \nthe government\u2019s countercyclical response to the pandemic. Unemployment and poverty are \nexpected to rise further because of containment measures undertaken in May\u2013June 2020 and \nthe continuing lockdown. During the first half of 2020, the volume of remittances from the Russian \nFederation dropped by 38.7% because of the 57.0% decline in migration caused by the lockdown, \nand the 12.9% depreciation of the ruble against the United States dollar.4 The loss of remittance \nearnings had a significant negative social impact since more than 50% of households, mostly in \nthe poorest regions, rely primarily on remittances for their source of income.5 Unemployment is \nexpected to rise from 2.0% in February 2020 to 6.1% by the end of 2020. \n5.  Binding constraints. The economy is dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the \n23 largest of which collectively account for about 10% of total public sector employment.6 SOEs \naccount for more than 40.0% of total value added and are present in 21 out of 28 sectors, a share \nthat  is  considerably  above  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development \naverage of 13.7%. A large part of the economy is informal and cash-based, especially in \nagriculture, retail trade, and consumer services. This structure has major negative implications \nthat limit financial sector development and its capacity to support economic growth. Strong public \nfinancial management (PFM) will improve the allocative efficiency of scarce public resources by \nintroducing fiscal discipline in expenditure allocation. This measure, in conjunction with strong \nrevenue mobilization efforts, will augment the fiscal space for public investment in high-quality \nkey economic infrastructure and public services needed to crowd in private investment. The main \nobjective of the National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for the Period up to \n2030 (NDS 2030) is to improve the standard of living by transitioning to an economy dominated \nby industry.7 Accelerated industrialization is expected to increase labor productivity, which will \nboost disposable income. The transition will be accomplished by implementing structural reforms. \nThe program will help the government achieve this objective through (i) enhanced banking sector \nstability, (ii) improved enabling environment for the financial sector, and (iii) strengthened fiscal \nmanagement. \n6.  Banking sector instability. Banking sector is fragile because of several factors. It has \nyet to recover from the 2015 financial crisis that left two large banks insolvent because of \nexcessive related-party lending, despite being recapitalized by the government, with their clients\u2019 \naccess to their deposit accounts restricted. Banking sector continues to suffer from a high level \nof NPLs, with a ratio of 31% for the entire banking system, and 19.4%, excluding the two insolvent \nbanks at the end of June 2020. Banks dominate the financial sector with commercial banks \nholding 85% of all financial assets and about 43% of banking assets controlled by state-owned \ncommercial banks. The insurance industry is exceedingly small, with insurance penetration at \n \n3  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update.

Dushanbe. \n ", "3 \nonly 0.34% of GDP in 2018.8 The limited range of financial products and expectation for credit \nlosses contribute to high-risk premiums. Borrowing costs are high (with average interest rates of \nmore than 22.5% in national currency and 13.0% in foreign currency) driven by the lack of \ncompetition, high transaction and administration costs, and asymmetric information between \nborrowers and lenders. While overall bank liquidity appears sufficient, with the liquidity ratio (liquid \nassets over short-term liabilities up to 30 days) standing at 65% as of 30 June 2020, compared \nwith a 30% requirement, most liabilities have a short tenor, causing banks to be hesitant to lend \nlong term.9 The high cost of borrowing has dampened loan demand and contributed to reduced \ncredit to the private sector, which fell from 23% of GDP in 2015 to 12% in 2018. Given the \nimpediments to credit access, firms resort to other options for raising capital, including selling of \nassets and informal borrowing. Directed lending to SOEs has crowded out private borrowing and \ninvestment and increased NPLs and overall financial system risk and instability.10 The share of \noutstanding loans to SOEs increased from 15.0% of total loans (TJS773 million or $162.4 million) \nin 2012 to 26.6% of total loans (TJS2.6 billion or $252.0 million) by the end of June 2020.11 Weak \nbanking system performance lowered public confidence in the sector, encouraging households to \nkeep  savings outside  the  financial  system.  The  Individuals  Deposit  Insurance  Fund  (IDIF) \nprovides coverage up to about $2,900 per person; however, its resources are insufficient to pay \ncurrently insured depositors in case of a systemic banking crisis or liquidation of an insolvent \nbank.12 A back-up funding mechanism for IDIF to cover potential shortfalls in reserves is not in \nplace, posing negative consequences for financial stability and public confidence. The financial \nposition of IDIF is jeopardized as it is authorized to invest only in government securities, which \nare issued at a low annual interest rate of 0.99%. Low domestic savings, a high share of cash in \nthe money supply, and a 20% drop in the total value of deposits held by individuals in banks in \n2015\u20132019 all reflect the public\u2019s lack of confidence in the banking system.13 \n7.  Weaknesses  in  financial  sector  oversight  and  development.  No  medium-term \nfinancial sector strategy exists to help guide financial market development. The National Bank of \nTajikistan (NBT) is responsible for supervising financial sector, overseeing financial stability, and \nconducting macroprudential policy.14 While financial system oversight has evolved, deficiencies \nremain within the NBT\u2019s institutional framework, macroprudential surveillance, analysis, and \npolicy tools. Insurance regulation is not in full compliance with international standards, and capital \nrequirements for private insurers are extremely low. The regulatory mechanism for Islamic and \ntraditional banks is designed to generally provide equitable conditions. However, the law on \nIslamic banking has shortcomings, hindering the development of Islamic finance. The law does \nnot contain provisions defining the features of banking or insurance transactions consistent with \nthe principles of murabaha (markup), mudaraba (labor), ijara (leasing), and takaful (insurance). \nThe  lack  of  a  well-functioning  government  bond  market  negatively  impacts  capital  market \ndevelopment and the creation of a domestic benchmark yield curve. The securities market is \ncentered on issuance of short-term government securities at a fixed 0.99% interest rate, which \n \n8  V. Gorchakov, H. Alvarez, and D. Anokhov. 2019.

Dushanbe (accessed 30 June 2020). \n10 Average NPLs increased from 9.0% in 2012 to 47.6% in 2016 and declined to 31.0% by the end of June 2020. \n11 National Bank of Tajikistan. 2020. Banking Statistics Bulletin. August. Dushanbe. \n12 As of the end of 2019, IDIF reserves were about TJS285 million. Should the two state-owned and insolvent banks \nbe resolved, IDIF would have about TJS35 million in reserves remaining after paying insured depositors, against the \nrequired TJS90 million in minimum capital. \n13 At the end of 2018, the share of cash (M0), checking deposits, and near money (M2) averaged 78% of the money \nsupply, which was significantly greater than that of peer countries with similar per capita income (25% average). \n14 Macroprudential regulation refers to the use of policy tools to mitigate systemic risk in the financial system. \n ", "4 \nresults in small volumes and little investor demand.15 IDIF is the only purchaser of these securities \nand no secondary market exists. \n8.  Weaknesses in fiscal management. The recently approved Tajikistan Public Financial \nManagement  Reform  Strategy  2019\u20132030  (PFMRS  2030)  identified  several  constraints  on \nachieving effective PFM,16 including (i) the lack of an effective medium-term budget plan; (ii) \nlimited  budget  transparency;  and  (iii)  an  inadequate  financial  reporting  system  for  SOEs, \nparticularly on the treatment of their debts and associated fiscal risks. There is no unified \nframework for managing a public investment program. Public investment management (PIM) is \nfragmented among various agencies and in some cases guided by the rules and regulations of \nfunding partners. Robust PIM practices are lacking that would better link the public investment \nprogram portfolio with needed development strategies through a vigorous appraisal process and \nindependent assessment of investment proposals. While the 2017 Public Expenditure and \nFinancial Accountability assessment reflected some progress since 2017 in PFM, including \ngradual improvement in the comprehensiveness of annual budget information and predictability \nand control in budget execution, weaknesses remain in financial data integrity and external audit. \nA medium-term perspective needs to be embedded in expenditure budgeting, to comply with \ninternationally recognized accounting standards and to strengthen fiscal risk management of \nSOEs. To reduce Tajikistan\u2019s vulnerability to economic shocks, maintain growth, and improve \nsocial development, PFM must be further strengthened by removing constraints on it. Strong PFM \nwill improve allocative efficiency of scarce public resources, which will augment the fiscal space \nfor public investment to crowd in private investment and contribute to economic development. \nUnclear taxation of certain financial services (insurance and Islamic finance) significantly affects \ntheir viability. Gaps in the tax code and distortive tax collection practices pose a significant barrier \nto private sector investment. \n9.  ADB engagement. Overall, ADB engagement has helped the government achieve critical \nstructural reforms that supported the expansion of economic opportunities and improvements to \nthe private investment climate. The proposed program builds upon successful reforms under the \nADB  Investment  Climate  Reforms  Program,  subprograms  1  and  2  for  improving  private \ninvestment (footnote 1). The choice of a policy-based grant modality for the program allows \ncombining policy dialogue with technical assistance (TA) and diagnostic studies that support \nmeaningful policy reforms. In designing the program, ADB closely coordinated with development \npartners, including the IMF and the World Bank, to identify key reform areas that will accelerate \nand sustain medium-term growth. \n10.  Lessons. Key lessons identified from interventions and experience with policy-based \nlending in Central Asia have been incorporated into the program\u2019s design, including the following: \n(i) utilization of  long-term programmatic assistance  is best placed  to support medium-term \ninvestment and business climate reforms, (ii) strong government ownership of reforms is critical \nto achieving results, (iii) the sustainability of reforms can be better ensured through the concurrent \nuse of focused TA support to guide implementation, (iv) the design of the program would have \nbenefited from leveraging critical reform progress from earlier policy-based operations, and (v) \nfocused and highly impactful policy actions should be pursued to help ensure that the reform \nprogram can be carried out effectively and that implementing agencies are fully connected to the \nprocess.17 \n \n15 The State Treasury Bills\u2019 rate has been capped by the Ministry of Finance at 0.99% per annum since 2016. \n16 Government of Tajikistan.

Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n11.  Alignment with national development strategies and ADB strategic engagement. \nNDS 2030 aims to ensure a steadily growing, competitive country that provides decent living \nstandards, and equal opportunities for everyone to realize their potential on the basis of equality, \njustice, and respect for human dignity. NDS 2030 identifies a number of problems hindering the \n \nfinancial sector, including (i) inefficient domestic resource mobilization for domestic lending and \ninvestment, (ii) low level of capitalization of financial institutions, (iii) limited diversification of \nfinancial products and channels, and (iv) high price of financial services. The PFMRS 2030 directs \nPFM reforms, underpinned by a four-pronged objective to ensure (i) fiscal discipline, (ii) allocative \nefficiency, (iii) operational efficiency, and (iv) transparency and accountability of public resources. \nThe program is closely aligned with the objectives of the strategies and ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Tajikistan, 2016\u20132020 included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan  for \nTajikistan, 2020\u20132022. The program builds on ADB\u2019s long-standing support to Tajikistan for \nbusiness and investment climate reforms and financial sector development.18 The program is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its focus on strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity by supporting public management reforms and financial sustainability, improving service \ndelivery, and accelerating progress in gender equality.19 \n12.  Reform area 1: Banking sector stability enhanced. The program will enhance banking \nsector stability and improve public confidence in the financial system by (i) helping IDIF fund \npayouts to depositors in the event of insolvency of an insured financial institution; (ii) improving \nthe ability of the NBT to monitor and manage financial stability and banking sector soundness; \nand (iii) increasing the capacity of the NBT to measure and manage credit risks in financial \ninstitutions and preventing excessive concentration of loans to SOEs, which can pose default \nrisks. The government adopted a resolution to provide a loan to IDIF covering any capital shortfall \nif its resources are insufficient, so it can pay insured depositors during the liquidation of an \ninsolvent bank. This measure will help the government solve lingering banking problems as it \nexpedites the adoption of a resolution mechanism for insolvent banks, as has been emphasized \nby development partners since 2017.20 IDIF adopted a resolution that indicates steps to resolve \nthe fund\u2019s current capital deficit by making participation in the fund mandatory for all banks and \ngradually raising the coverage amount for insured deposits to increase confidence in the banking \nsystem. The NBT\u2019s ability to monitor and manage financial stability and banking sector soundness \nwas improved through several actions. The NBT issued a regulation requiring banks to improve \ntheir operational risk management. The Law on Banking was amended expanding fit-and-proper \nrequirements that vet the professional competence and reliability of banks\u2019 management, board, \nand audit committee, to better control conflicts of interest. The NBT expanded the stress-testing \nframework for financial stability, improving macroprudential surveillance and analysis. To increase \nbanks\u2019 soundness and ability to manage risks while retaining sufficient capital buffers, the NBT \n \n18 ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Tajikistan, 2016\u20132020.

However, their financial standing \ndid not improve. Resolution of insolvent banks has been part of the reform discussions between the IMF and the \ngovernment, and stymied by negative overall public perception of banks, concern over potential fiscal impact, \nmonetary policy implications, and moral hazard. Bank resolution and sector reform require solid government \ncommitment to deal with insolvencies, reduce NPLs, and mitigate residual implications of directed or related-party \nlending. These issues highlight the need for development partners to coordinate closely and build consensus in \nproviding quality assistance and coherent advice to the government. \n ", "6 \nadopted a plan to better align regulatory capital requirements with Basel II.21 To better mitigate \ncredit exposures, the NBT developed a comprehensive template for banks to accurately report \nlending exposure, and expanded financial reporting requirements by incorporating data needed \nunder the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9. These reforms will continue with \nfollow-up policy actions proposed for subprogram 2, including (i) improving the institutional setup \nand corporate governance of IDIF; (ii) adopting a formal backup funding arrangement and a new \nframework to increase the scope and level of deposit insurance coverage; (iii) including all \ndeposit-taking institutions in the  insurance scheme and adopting risk-based premiums; (iv) \nimproving financial stability reporting; (v) expanding the NBT\u2019s macroprudential policy tools and \ninstruments;  (vi)  implementing  steps  to  adopt  Basel  II;  (vii)  expanding  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated financial data; and (viii) adopting policies to mitigate and limit the credit exposure \nin banks, including lending to SOEs. \n13.  Reform area 2: Enabling environment for financial sector development improved. \nThe program will improve the development of financial sector, including Islamic banking and \ninsurance; increase competition; and expand gender inclusiveness. The last financial sector \nstrategy for Tajikistan covered 2010\u20132015. The lack of a successor strategy has hindered the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to identify, prioritize, and sequence critical reforms. The government will \nprepare a comprehensive financial sector development strategy. The government has formed a \nworking group (30% women), including delegates from MOF, the NBT, and IDIF, to prepare a \nmedium-term financial sector development strategy and road map. It includes trackable target \nindicators for improving access of women to finance, promotes fintech development and mobile \nfinancial services, and plans to  strengthen  financial consumer protection.22 To expand the \nsecurities market, MOF improved the process of issuing and circulating state securities and \napproved an action plan for modernizing the state securities auction process. It includes the \nauction of securities at tenors longer than 91 days at market rates under a pilot test. To remove \nbarriers to financial sector development and to improve supervision and clarification of the legal \nand regulatory framework, the government (i) adopted a resolution defining minimum statutory \ncapital for insurance and reinsurance companies; and (ii) issued regulations governing the \nactivities  of  Islamic  credit  institutions,  including  minimum  capital  and  other  prudential \nrequirements. These reforms will continue with follow-up policy actions proposed for subprogram \n2, including (i) adoption of a medium-term financial sector strategy and road map incorporating \ngender  aspects,  (ii)  auctioning  of  government  securities under  a  pilot  program  at  market-\ndetermined interest rates, (iii) development of an insurance industry medium-term strategy and \nroad map, (iv) amendment of the law on insurance to improve insurance supervision, and (v) \namendment of the law on Islamic banking to remove impediments to Islamic finance development. \n14.  Reform  area  3:  Fiscal  management  strengthened.  The  program  will  improve \ntransparency and accountability of the PFM system to help ensure that public resources are \nappropriately allocated to strategic priorities. To improve budget transparency and ensure that \nbudgets reflect the government's social and economic priorities, MOF (i) updated guidelines to \nensure transparency and public access to budget information and the semiannual state budget \nreview; and (ii) approved an analysis for the effective rollout of the medium-term expenditure \nframework  (MTEF),  incorporating  gender-responsive  budgeting  and  analysis  and  ensuring \nconsistency with sector plans and an improved analysis of capital investment expenditure. MOF \nupgraded public sector accounting by adopting a road map for implementing public sector \n \n21 Basel II is a set of international banking regulations put forth by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which \nleveled the international regulation field with uniform rules and guidelines.

To strengthen oversight and accountability of SOEs, the \ngovernment adopted (i) updated financial reporting requirements for large SOEs in accordance \nwith  IFRS,  (ii)  a  new  regulation  creating  a  supervisory  board  to  oversee  overall  financial \nperformance of SOEs, and (iii) guidelines for assessing fiscal risks. A new tax code was submitted \nto the High-Level Working Group, which provides for proper tax treatment of insurance activities \n \nand Islamic finance.The government adopted a decree to improve the procedure and monitoring \nmechanism of tax and customs benefits. These reforms will continue with follow-up policy actions \nproposed for subprogram 2, including (i) adopting a 3-year rolling MTEF, (ii) reconciling the MTEF \nwith  the  strategic  plans  of  pilot  sectors  that  incorporate  gender-responsive  budgeting  and \nimproved analysis of investment expenditure for robust PIM practices, (iii) approving a manual on \ncompliance of public financial statements with IPSAS, (iv) implementing consolidated financial \nstatements for large SOEs in accordance with IFRS, and (v) submitting a new tax code to \nParliament. \n15.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  policy  engagement  and  capacity \ndevelopment in financial sector and fiscal management, and long-standing relationship with the \ngovernment have been important to identify and implement critical reforms. Strong value addition \nis demonstrated by (i) identifying broad binding constraints and possible legal and institutional \nsolutions in accord with international best practices; (ii) conducting detailed policy dialogue and \ngenerating  diagnostic  studies;  (iii)  having  long-standing  experience  in  designing  and \nimplementing TA and policy-based lending supporting reforms that increase private investment, \neconomic  diversification,  and  inclusive  growth;  and  (iv)  closely  coordinating  with  other \ndevelopment partners to avoid duplication and ensure consistency of key policy messages.23 \n16.  Macroeconomic management and debt sustainability. Tajikistan managed to maintain \ngeneral  macroeconomic  stability  and  growth  through  the  second  quarter  of  2020  despite \nsignificant shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. GDP growth, however, slowed from 7.5% \nin the first half of 2019 to 3.5% in the same period of 2020, reflecting the pandemic\u2019s impact: \ndeclining  remittances,  external  trade,  and  foreign direct  investment.  On  5  June  2020,  the \nPresident of Tajikistan signed a decree to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.24 The \ngovernment\u2019s countercyclical assistance equaled 4.5% of GDP, nearly half of it earmarked to \nsupport  firms.  Further  impact  on  the  economy  is  expected,  with  constraints  on  private \nconsumption, continuing decline in remittances, and slow progress of large infrastructure projects; \neconomic growth is forecast to decline to 1.0% for all of 2020. The fiscal deficit is expected to \nincrease to 6.0% in 2020 because of loss in revenues and the cost of the pandemic response \nprograms. The IMF\u2019s Debt Sustainability Analysis indicates that overall risk of debt distress \nremains high.25 Total public debt is expected to rise above 50% of GDP in 2020. However, the \nIMF assessed that, based on the government\u2019s commitment to fiscal consolidation, debt levels \nwill stabilize over the medium term, becoming sustainable. As the country has been facing \nrevenue shortfalls since March 2020, and with the current external debt\u2013GDP ratio close to the \nlegal ceiling of 40%, the proposed ADB grant will create fiscal space and help improve debt \nsustainability. To achieve fiscal and external debt consolidation and ensure macroeconomic \nstability, the government approved PFMRS 2030 in January 2020 and committed to undertake \nmedium-term  fiscal  consolidation,  including  reprioritizing  public  spending,  avoiding \n \n23 ADB. 2019.

ADB has closely coordinated with development \npartners, and they have indicated broad support for the scope and coverage of the program.26 \nUnder the program, the government supported a standby lending facility between IDIF and MOF, \nwhich is consistent with the IMF\u2019s program conditionality. The IMF has not had a program in \nTajikistan since 2012. Authorities have been negotiating with the IMF on a new program since \n2015, but when it will be in place is not yet known. Facilitation of capital market development is in \nline with  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\u2019s TA project with MOF. \nStrengthening the macroprudential framework and overall banking supervision, that includes \nintroducing remote authentication of clients for low-risk digital banking transactions, matches \nWorld Bank and International Finance Corporation support for financial sector. ADB discussed \nthe reform proposals with the World Bank and the IMF and received positive support. ADB holds \nregular follow-up discussions on financial sector with the IMF. ADB closely coordinated with the \nIMF to assess the fiscal outlook and risks and the monitoring of public debt. Program policy \nactions  are  consistent  with  the  IMF\u2019s  2019  Article  IV  Consultation  assessment  and \nrecommendations for Tajikistan.27 The IMF has been providing guidance to Tajikistan, under \nwhich the government and the NBT are expected to raise public confidence in the banking system, \nimprove banking sector regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and boost governance of SOEs. \nC.  Impacts of the Reforms \n18.  The country\u2019s overarching development objective is increased private sector confidence \nin and strengthening of the financial sector, which will help increase private investment (footnote \n7).28 Raising banking sector stability will increase public confidence in financial sector, developing \nfinancial  sector  will  boost  access  to  it,  and  improving  fiscal  management  will  accelerate \nsustainable private sector growth. The effect of raising overall public confidence in financial sector \nand  strengthening  its  development  framework,  combined  with  improvements  in  fiscal \nmanagement, will help increase private investment. \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n19.  Development financing needs. To support government-led reforms to stabilize financial \nsector, ADB proposes to provide a $90.0 million policy-based grant through a programmatic \napproach, to be disbursed in two subprograms. For subprogram 1, the government has requested \na grant not exceeding $50.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund) to help finance the program and to cover the government\u2019s urgent financing needs in 2020, \nwhich equals to $735 million. The indicative amount for subprogram 2 is not exceeding $40 million \nin 2022 to help finance policy and institutional reforms under subprogram 2. More financing is \nprovided in subprogram 1 to leverage upfront political support for the implementation of critical \nreforms  and  improved  coordination  and  collaboration  across  implementing  agencies.  The \ngovernment has limited domestic borrowing capacity because of the undeveloped government \n \n26 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 IMF. 2019.

The report \nemphasized that restoring financial stability and boosting confidence in the banking sector is needed, as is further \nmitigating the fiscal risk from the largest SOEs. Key recommendations include (i) resolution of the two insolvent banks \nand payout to insured depositors, (ii) strong sector oversight with implementation of an improved supervisory \nframework, and (iii) greater oversight and transparency of SOEs. The program tackles reforms highlighted in the \nIMF\u2019s recommendations, including (i) supporting IDIF to fund payouts to depositors in the event of insolvency of an \ninsured financial institution, (ii) improving the ability of the NBT to monitor and manage financial stability and banking \nsoundness, and (iii) updating financial reporting requirements for SOEs in accordance with IFRS. \n28 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nsecurities market and low demand for government treasury bills. External funding needs are \nexpected to be sourced largely from concessional loans and grants provided by international \nfinance institutions. Authorities are considering access to nontraditional donors to supplement its \nfinancing needs. The IMF approved a rapid credit facility of $189.5 million on 6 May 2020.29 ADB\u2019s \nCOVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program grant, approved on 18 June 2020, \nfinanced $50 million.30 The Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development approved a $50 \nmillion concessional budget support loan on 4 August 2020.31 An ADB grant of $20 million is \nprogrammed for 2020 from the Power Sector Development Program.32 The government expects \nother sources of concessional external financing to meet remaining development financing needs.  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  MOF is the executing agency for the program. The NBT, MOF, IDIF, and Tax Committee \nare the implementing agencies. The program implementation period is August 2019\u2013September \n2022,  with  subprogram  1  already  implemented  from  August  2019  to  September  2020. \nSubprogram 2 is expected to be implemented from October 2020 to September 2022. The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  grant  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).33 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance\n21.  ADB completed a governance risk assessment in 2020 according to the implementation \nguidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.34 The assessment found \nthat basic legislative, regulatory, and institutional frameworks are in place for all three governance \nareas. While PFM has seen several important recent changes and improvements, anticorruption \nactivities are largely ineffective at a high level due to weak enforcement, primarily because of the \nsignificant  governance  problems  facing  the  government.  The  2018  worldwide  governance \nindicators for Tajikistan are below regional averages. The key concerns include (i) voice and \naccountability, (ii) political stability, (iii) government effectiveness, (iv) regulatory quality, (v) rule \nof law, and (vi) control of corruption. The  Public Expenditure and  Financial  Accountability \nassessment for 2017 showed that some improvements had been made since 2012, mainly in (i) \ncomprehensiveness and transparency of budget information, (ii) predictability and control in \nbudget execution, (iii) accounting and reporting, and (iv) external scrutiny and audit. However, \nseveral PFM concerns remain: (i) gaps between the budgeted and actual expenditures for \nindividual budget entities, (ii) a lack of public access to fiscal information, (iii) weak investment \nproject selection, and (iv) deficient medium-term expenditure estimates. The government has \nbeen implementing  reforms to improve governance, including measures to  increase public \nspending  efficiency,  ensure  better  governance  of  SOEs,  and  raise  corporate  governance \nstandards for financial sector. \n \n29 The terms of the IMF loan are a 10-year tenor, 5-year grace period, and 0% interest. \n30 ADB. 2020.

The poor and vulnerable are the most at risk from the impact of economic crises, having \nthe least means to  mitigate  the effects or access finance that can help them temporarily \ncompensate for any reduction in income. The national poverty rate is high at 27.4% (12.0% of this \nfigure reflects the population that is defined as extremely poor). A further 46% of the population, \nalthough living above the national poverty line, are classified as vulnerable and at risk of falling \ninto poverty.35 According to the 2016 Tajikistan Labor Force Survey, about 29.4% of the labor \nforce was informally employed; a high youth unemployment rate of 21.0% was particularly \nproblematic.36 About 73% of the population are based in rural areas, where agriculture absorbs \n58% of the workforce, many of whom have low incomes and comprise vulnerable groups close to \nthe poverty line. Through a standby lending facility for IDIF, about 37,000 depositors in two \ninsolvent banks, who cannot access their insured deposit accounts will be paid off. With a more \nstable banking sector, poor and vulnerable households in remote areas will have better access to \naffordable  finance.  Tax  code  amendments  that  reduce  the  tax  burden  and  streamline \nadministration will give poor and vulnerable households greater business opportunities, which will \nexpand the tax base, improving fiscal space. Amendments will improve targeting of public social \nservices and investment in infrastructure. Better-targeted public investment will crowd in private \ninvestment,  which  will  accelerate  industrialization,  increase  labor  productivity,  and  boost \ndisposable income. \nC.  Gender \n23.  The program is categorized as having some gender elements and integrates actions to \nensure that women can equitably benefit from the program\u2019s outputs. The labor force participation \nrate of females (48%) was much lower than that of males (78%) in 2018. According to the Labor \nForce Survey, the most common occupations filled by females are unskilled work such as \ncleaners and servants in institutions, hotels, and other places. In 2014, women represented 21.3% \nof individual entrepreneurs operating on the basis of a patent and 38.0% operating on the basis \nof a certificate.37 Women have impaired access to the financial system, especially in rural areas. \nThe main obstacles are the lack of products and services that meet women\u2019s unique needs and \nrequirements, low financial literacy, and social and cultural barriers. The program ensures that \ngender aspects, including ease of access to finance by women, will be incorporated into a \nmedium-term finance strategy. MOF will adopt gender-responsive budgeting and analysis in the \nMTEF to better consider the needs of women through public services and investments. \nD.  Safeguards \n24.  Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is in category C for \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Program  activities  will  be \nconfined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to involuntary \nresettlement or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment (Appendix 2). \n \n \n \n35 Poverty figures are sourced from Tajikistan Statistics Agency. 2018.

ASSURANCES \n26.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that the government has \ncompleted the policy actions specified in the policy matrix relating to the program. The grant \nproceeds  will  be  disbursed  upon  effectiveness  of  the  grant  agreement.  As  a  condition  to \neffectiveness, all policy actions completed by the government as specified in the policy matrix \nrelating to the program will have to continue to be in effect. \nV.
