The  project  will  also \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  the  road  sector  and  customs  authorities.  By  expanding \nconnectivity in remote areas, increasing road capacity of major international trade corridors, \nand enhancing customs clearance capacity, the project will boost the economy of the project \nareas,  and  integrate  them  more  effectively  with  their  primary  markets  in  India,  and  with \nmarkets beyond. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nNepal\u2019s  economy  relies  heavily  on  foreign  trade.  The  ratio  of  total  trade  to  gross \ndomestic  product  is  about  50%.  While  average  gross  domestic  product  growth  between \nFY2001/02 and FY2008/09 is about 4% per year, average growth in exports and imports is \nabout 5% per year. Trade taxes are a major source of government revenue, e.g., about 22% \nof  total  government  revenue  in  2005.  An  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  study2 highlights \nthree  aspects  of  subregional  trade  enhancement  in  Nepal:  (i)  focus  on  products  that  have \ncomparative  advantage,  (ii)  provide  facilities,  and  (iii)  improve  connectivity.  The  eastern \nregion has the potential to step up production of highly exportable herbs and spices, as well \nas  of  garments  and  vegetables.  Nepal  needs  to  improve  its  transport  network  and  transit \nlogistics  not  only  to  integrate  the  remote  areas  of  the  country,  but  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for its integration into regional and global markets. \n \n4. \nPoor  connectivity  is  a  major  development  constraint  for  Nepal.  Inadequate  feeder \nroads  worsen  the  isolation  of  remote  rural  areas,  especially  in  northern  hill  regions.  These \nareas have a high incidence of poverty and need to be linked to markets in the country, and \neventually  to  neighboring  countries.  The  north\u2013south  link  could  also  be  a  potential  transit \nroute  connecting  India  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  In  addition  to  the  connectivity \nissue  of  remote  hill  areas,  there  is  growing  congestion  along  major  international  trade \ncorridors,  especially  on  the  EWH  and  road  sections  around  the  borders,  because  of  fast-\nincreasing vehicle numbers in Terai areas. The poor condition and low capacity of the roads, \nand  limited  capability  of  customs  systems  exacerbate  the  congestion.  To  address  these \nconstraints,  the government  developed  and  has been  implementing  the Priority  Investment \nPlan  (2007\u20132016)  and  the  customs  modernization  plan.  Nepal  has  major  international  and \nsubregional  trade  corridors  as  identified  in  SAARC3 Regional  Multimodal  Transport  Study4 \nand the Asian Highways network. \n \n5. \nThe  road  sector  development  strategy  under  Nepal's  Three-Year  Interim  Plan \n(FY2007/08\u2013FY2009/10)  includes  (i)  improving  roads  for  the  development  of  high-density \nand  border  area  settlements, and for  better  access  to hitherto  unserved  remote  areas  with \neconomic  potential,  and  (ii)  developing  the  EWH  as  the  Asian  Highway  and  the  regional \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010.

Manila (TA 6187-REG). \n\n\ftrade route in accordance with the concept of developing road networks for promoting South \nAsian  regional  development.  The  strategy  includes  adopting  a  road  asset  management \nsystem  for  sustainable,  reliable,  and  safe  road  transport  operations,  and  prioritizing  repair, \nmaintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of roads and bridges. \n \nProject  roads  include:  (i)  the  Salleri\u2013Okhaldhunga  and  (ii)  Okhaldhunga\u2013Harkapur \n6. \nroads  (100  km),  which  provide  the  remote  northeastern  hill  areas  with  a  north\u2013south \nconnection to the EWH, and further south to the Siraha border; (iii) the Khandbari\u2013Chainpur \nroad (44 km), which provides one of the unconnected district centers with a motorable road, \nand will form the planned north\u2013south transit route connecting India at the Bitranagar border \npoint  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  at  the  Kimathanka  border;  (iv)  the  Bhairahawa \nbypass  (about  3.5  km),  part  of  SAARC  Road  Corridor  10,  connecting  Kathmandu  with \nLucknow  in  India,  which  also  complements  India's  ongoing  Integrated  Customs  Posts \nProgram; and (v) the Belbari\u2013Chauharwa road (47 km), which is part of the EWH in border \nareas  and  forms  part  of  the  SAARC  Road  Corridor  4,  facilitating  subregional  traffic  via  its \nKakarvitta border post to India and Bangladesh. These roads have been selected based on \nenvironment, resettlement, social, and economic impacts; and project readiness. Enhancing \ncross-border  transport  capacity  by  introducing  information  technology  and  simplifying \ncustoms procedures and documentation will further reduce congestion in border areas. \n \n7. \nThe  project  will  support  the  government  in  addressing  two  development  issues: \nexpand  connectivity  of  remote  areas  and  boost  the  capacity  of  major  international  trade \ncorridors.  The  project  is  relevant  to  achieving  the  goals  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy (2010\u20132014)5 of enhancing global\u2013local  connectivity  to  enable  regionally  balanced \neconomic  growth;  it  is  also  relevant  to  the  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  programs \n(2006\u20132008)6 aimed at improving subregional connectivity and promoting intraregional trade \nin South Asia. The project is included in the country partnership strategy 2010\u20132014 and the \nregional  cooperation  operations  business  plan  (2009\u20132010) 7  as  a  national  project  with \nregional implications. This is an approach to accelerating regional cooperation, supported in \nthe  Second  High  Level  Forum  on  Emerging  Vision  for  Shared  Prosperity:  South  Asia  and \nBeyond, held in Manila in August 2010. \n \n8. \nThe  project  has  been  designed  in  coordination  with  development partners to ensure \nwide  geographic  coverage  and  avoid  overlaps,  and  continues  ADB's  consistent  efforts  to \nimprove  road  connectivity  and  capacity,  and  facilitate  cross-border  traffic,  in  parallel  with \ncapacity development relating to road safety, social aspects, overload control, and road asset \nmanagement.  Project readiness  is  substantially  advanced,  e.g.,  ADB  project  appraisal  for  all \nselected  roads  is  based  on  a  detailed  design  prepared  by  consultants  engaged  by  the \ngovernment. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nImpact  and  outcome.  The  project  will  promote  economic  development  of  Nepal\u2019s \nborder  areas  and  the  remote  northeastern  hills by  increasing  domestic and  regional trades \nthrough  expansion  of  the  national  and  subregional  transport  systems.  The  project  will \n(i) improve  connectivity  of  remote  areas  with  national  and  subregional  markets;  and  (ii) \nexpand  the  capacity  of  major  international  trade  corridors  in  conjunction  with  the \nmodernization  of  customs  systems,  thereby  enabling  efficient  and  safe  transport  within  the \ncountry and with India and, through India, with Bangladesh and Bhutan. \n \n \n \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2009.

The project will rehabilitate and reconstruct about \n195 km of roads for (i) three road sections to expand connectivity, and (ii) two road sections \nto  enhance  the  capacity  of  major  international  trade  corridors.  Consulting  services  for \nconsulting  supervision  will  also  be  provided,  which  includes  support  to  address  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \n11. \nTrade  facilitation  component.  The  project  will  provide  equipment  and  capacity \ndevelopment  support  to  modernize  customs  clearance  systems  and  facilitate  subregional \ntrade. Major equipment includes the upgrade of the automated system for customs data, and \ncomputers  and  network  systems.  The  component  aims \nthe  current \ncomputerized system from a transaction-recording system to a processing tool by providing \n(i) consulting services for reengineering the business process in customs; and (ii) equipment \nand implementation support, including training. \n \n12. \nCapacity  development  component.  The  project  will  provide  (i)  equipment  for  the \ngovernment to strengthen sector capacity, such as control of overloading, and (ii) consulting \nservices to strengthen institutions such as the Department of Roads (DOR) and the Roads \nBoard Nepal in line with Nepal\u2019s road sector development strategy. Areas requiring capacity \ndevelopment  include  project  management,  road  asset  management,  and  road  technology \nexpertise. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $75.9  million,  including  taxes  and  duties,  physical \nand  price  contingencies,  and  interest  during  implementation  (Table  1).

DOR \nhas  previously  carried  out  e-procurement,  up  to  the  stage  of  e-submission  of  bids,  for \nprojects funded domestically and by other development partners. The associated procedure \nand mechanism in place have been reviewed as satisfactory. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nThe  project  considered  climatic  hazards  and  disaster  proneness,  and,  to  the  extent \npossible,  applied  built-in  measures  to minimize  their  adverse  impacts.  For  the roads  in  the \nhill  areas,  bioengineering  technique 10  was  considered  where  appropriate  to  protect  and \nstabilize  roadside  slopes.  For  the  roads  in  the  Terai  areas,  conventional  civil  engineering \nmeasures were assessed, including embankment height, design values of storm frequency \nand  runoff,  and  drainage.  A  road  safety  audit  was  undertaken  and  incorporated  during  the \ndesign, and will also be undertaken during construction. Overall, the project will (i) develop \nquality roads that sustainably expand connectivity and boost transport efficiency, (ii) improve \ntravel conditions, and (iii) reduce travel time and vehicle operating costs. \n \nUpgrading the customs clearance systems will build on the existing software, taking \n19. \ninto  account  current and future  needs.  First,  a  business  process reengineering  plan will  be \ndesigned,  then  the  automated  system  for  customs  data  will  be  upgraded  and  the  plan \nimplemented,  keeping  in  mind  the  eventual  establishment  of  a  single-window  system  for \ntrade facilitation in Nepal. \n \nB. \n \n20. \nEconomic  viability.  The  economic  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.11 Each  road  has  been  assessed \nusing  standard  approaches for  road  projects. The World  Bank\u2019s  highway  development  and \nmanagement model was used for the Bhairahawa bypass and the Belbari\u2013Chauharwa road, \nboth  in  the  Terai region and suited to the model,  while  a  spreadsheet-based  analysis,  with \nconsumer surplus approach, was used for the hill roads. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                 \n10 Bioengineering  combines  vegetation\u2014grass,  shrubs,  and  trees\u2014with  minor  structures  such  as  dams,  walls, \nand drains to manage water and debris, and to protect and stabilize slopes. It is a combination of indigenous \nmethods  and  modern  engineering  structures  that  minimizes  cost  and  maximizes  benefits.  DOR's  division \noffices throughout Nepal now use bioengineering in the construction, maintenance, and upgrading of all roads, \nespecially in hilly and mountainous areas. \n\n11 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f21. \nThe economic internal  rate of return (EIRR) evaluated for the roads varied between \n13% and 35%. The results indicate that the proposed improvements of the project roads are \neconomically  viable  on  all  subprojects  and  in  most  cases  significantly  higher  than  12%, \nindicating the high economic rate of return. The sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads \nwas  analyzed  with  respect  to  changes  in  the  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following \nsensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i)  construction  cost  increase  by  15%,  (ii)  benefit \ndecrease  by  15%,  (iii)  excluding  producer  surplus  benefits  for  hill  roads,  (iv)  construction \ndelay  by  1  year,  and  (v)  a  combination  of  (i)  and  (ii).  Two  of  the  roads  (Harkapur\u2013\nOkhaldhunga and Okhaldhunga\u2013Salleri) have an EIRR below 12% in some of the sensitivity \nanalysis cases. The EIRRs in these cases range from 9.7% to 11.5%, which are marginally \nbelow 12%. These two roads are also connected to function as one road, which has a higher \nEIRR  in  a  combined  economic  analysis.  Both  roads  serve  underdeveloped  remote  areas \nand  their  improvement  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  development  of  these  areas. \nConsidering the positive development impact of these two roads and an EIRR of more than \n9% even in the worst-case sensitivity scenario, they are recommended for implementation, \nalong with all other roads included in the analysis.12 \n \n22. \nFinancial sustainability. Incremental recurrent costs associated with the project are \nestimated  at  5%  of  the  current  DOR  maintenance  budget  and  less  than  1%  of  the  overall \nDOR  budget  on  an  annual  basis.  Maintenance  will  be  required  after  project  completion  in \n2013 and an adequate budget increase is expected in view of recent trends. It is reasonable \nto expect that funds will be available to meet these costs. The government has earmarked a \nbudget amount for periodic maintenance, and assures that it will fund 100% of routine and \nperiodic maintenance. \n \nC. \n \n23. \nInstitutional.  DOR,  the  implementing  agency,  was  established  in  1961  under  the \nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW). DOR is responsible for the development \nand maintenance of the strategic road network, which comprises the national arterial roads, \nand  major  feeder  roads  connecting  to  local  and  rural  roads.  DOR  is  headed  by  a  director \ngeneral who reports to the secretary of MPPW.  \n \n24. \nDOR  has  a  good  record  of  implementing  ADB-funded  projects,  and  has  sufficient \ncapacity, past experience, and institutional strength to implement this project. DOR capacity \nis further augmented by the World Bank\u2019s support13 and ongoing ADB capacity development \ntechnical  assistance,  including  training  in  carrying  out  feasibility  studies  for  road  transport \nprojects and adopting best practices in contract management and quality assurance.14 DOR \nwill also get support from the provision of consulting services to assist with the supervision of \nworks. \n \n25. \nFinancial management. Financial management assessment was carried out for the \nimplementing  agency.  DOR  has  ample  experience  in  implementing  ADB-funded  projects, \nenough  capacity  to  carry  out  project  financial  accounting,  and  knowledge  of  ADB \ndisbursement  procedures.  Within \nthe  project \nimplementation  unit  for  the  road  transport  component,  there  will  be  a  dedicated  project \naccounting  and  finance  team  with  a  suitably  qualified  chief  project  accountant  and  two \nassistant accountants. \n\nthe  DOR  Project  Directorate  (ADB), \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                 \n12 Details of the economic assessment are in Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n13 The World Bank has been providing support to the overall institutional strengthening, especially in the areas of \nmanagement information systems, road safety action plan, safeguard implementation capacity, quality control, \nand human resources management. \n\n14 ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Road Connectivity \nSector 1 Project. Manila (Grant 0051-NEP for $55.2 million and TA 4825-NEP for $0.3 million, approved on 20 \nJuly). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f \nDOR will establish and maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the \n26. \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made for the project, ensuring an adequate \naudit  trail.  The  government's  Office  of  Auditor  General  will  annually  audit  the  project \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  international  auditing \nstandards.  To  further  minimize  risks,  ADB's  direct  payment  procedure  will  be  used  for \nsubstantial disbursements for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n27. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  The  government  has  promulgated  the  Public \nProcurement  Act  (2007)  and  Public  Procurement  Regulations  (2007),  both  generally \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  encompassing  best  international  procurement  practices.  To  be  in \nline with the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), the NCB \nannex  in  the  procurement  plan  will  be  applied  for  the  national  competitive  bidding.  The \nPublic  Procurement  Monitoring  Office 15 has  been  assigned  as  the  national  procurement \noversight body under the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. E-submission \nof  bids  will  be  adopted  for  the  NCB  to  substantially  increase  transparency  and  fair \ncompetition in bidding, as shown in projects funded domestically and by other development \npartners. The government will publish information on the project on DOR\u2019s website, including \nbusiness  opportunities  associated  with  the  project,  and  information  on  procurement  of \ngoods, works, and consulting services. \n \n28. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  the  executing  agency  (MPPW),  and  the  implementing \nagency (DOR). Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM (footnote 8). \n \nD. \n \n29. \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  The  poverty  situation  in  Nepal  is  serious. \nMore  than  26%  of  the  people  earn  less  than  the  government  poverty  line  of  NRs10,000 \n($140)  per  year.  Rural  poverty  is  almost  twice  as  high  as  urban  poverty.  According  to  the \nNepal  Living  Standard  Survey  2004,  the  poverty  incidence  in  the  rural  districts  that  will  be \naffected by the project ranges from 29% to 46%, as against 30.8% nationally. Most of these \ndistricts are also deemed food-insecure, where food is supplied from outside markets and in \nmost cases from  abroad. The  majority  of  households  have  a  food  deficit for  3\u20139 months  a \nyear.  As  transportation  proves  difficult  because  roads  are  in  poor  condition  or  lacking \naltogether, it has been a challenge to supply food in time and at low cost. The lack of roads \nalso  limits  people\u2019s  chances  to  grow  and  sell  agricultural  products  to  the  neighboring \nmarkets. \n \n30. \nFor the  poverty  and  social  assessment,  871  households  were  selected  randomly  at \ncorridors of impacts. For census for resettlement assessment, 579 affected households were \ntaken.  Most  primary  stakeholders  acknowledged  the  positive  impacts  of  the  project.  With \nimproved  roads  and  better  connectivity,  farmers  will  be  able  to  sell  agricultural  products  to \nthe  neighboring  markets,  and  thus  grow  larger  marketable  surpluses.  A  larger  marketable \nsurplus will generate more paid agricultural employment, particularly benefiting the poor, and \nthus  improve  the  food  situation  in  the  project  districts.  The  project  will  also  create \nemployment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor during project implementation. It will \nenable  reliable  access  to  social  services,  particularly  health-care  services,  education \nfacilities,  and  supply  of  drinking  water.  The  direct  (access  to  services  and  markets)  and \nindirect benefits (employment) of the project will help reduce poverty and improve the quality \nof life.16 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB  is  providing  technical  assistance  to  strengthen  the  Public  Procurement  Monitoring  Office  in  order  to \n\nimplement requirements of the newly enacted act and regulations. \n\n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fthe  project \n\n \nGender. The  project will  have  no  negative gender  impacts.  It  will  provide  both men \n31. \nand  women  with  direct  employment  opportunities  during  implementation,  better  delivery  of \nservices,  and  easier  access to markets, quality  health-care facilities, and  higher  education. \nDiscussions  were  held  with  39  focus  groups,  of  which  28  had  mixed  male  and  female \nparticipation,  and  11  were  women-only  groups.  The  number  of  participants  during  each \ndiscussion ranged from 13 to 52 in mixed groups and from 9 to 14 in female groups. Focus \ngroup  discussions  with  women  and  communities  revealed  that  women  primarily  look  after \ndomestic and agricultural activities. About 11% of the women work outside their homes, as \nconstruction  or  agriculture  laborers.  Only  2%  are  employed  in  services,  in  schools  or  in \ngovernment  offices.  Women  engaged  in  the  non-agriculture  sector,  such  as  services  and \nconstruction,  are  also  responsible  for  domestic  affairs,  such  as  taking  care  of  children  and \nhousehold chores, or looking after cattle. Most respondents welcomed the project.  \n \nThe  project  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor \n32. \nlaws, including elimination of gender-differentiated wages. Men and women directly affected \nby  the  project  will  be  given  priority  of  employment  under  the  project.  Contractors must  pay \nequal wages to men and women employed for work of equal value; a specific clause will be \nin  bidding  documents  and  compliance  will  be  monitored  during  project \nincluded \nimplementation  by  a  gender  specialist  engaged  under \nimplementation \nconsultants, and by external monitoring. \n \nHIV/AIDS. Nepal had 4,861 (3,545 males and 1,316 females) reported HIV (including \n33. \nAIDS)  cases  as  of  March  2005.  At  present,  there  are  more  than  50  nongovernment \norganizations  working  in  the  area  of  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  and  57  nongovernment \norganizations  in  anti-trafficking  activities,  in  addition  to  United  Nations  agencies  and \ngovernment  efforts.  The  National  Center  for  AIDS  and  STD  Control  under  the  Ministry  of \nHealth  and  Population  coordinates  the  activities  of  all  stakeholders  in  fulfilling  the \ncommitments  made  in  the  National  AIDS  Strategy  (2002\u20132006),  which  emphasizes \nprevention  as  the  mainstay  for  an  effective  response.  Anti-trafficking  activities  are \ncoordinated by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare. There already exists a \nlarge  number  of  information  and  education  print  material  on  anti-trafficking  developed \nthrough  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  support,  which  may  be \nreproduced  for  use  in  project  areas.  Although  the  social  assessment  undertaken  has  not \nbrought forth significant risks of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in the project districts, these \nrisks may  be  aggravated once  connectivity has  increased.  To  prevent  this,  a  gender \nspecialist  engaged  as  part  of  the  project  implementation  consultants  will  develop  and \nimplement  an  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  program  that  includes  raising  awareness  of \ngender issues and child labor. \n \nE. \n \n34. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  \"B\"  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  and  therefore,  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were \nprepared  for  the  subprojects.  DOR  has  submitted  all  IEEs  for  ADB  approval,  and  they  are \nnow  available  to  interested  stakeholders  upon  request. 17 Findings  of the IEEs  indicate that \nthe  project  is  not  likely  to  cause  significant  adverse  environmental  impact  since  no  forest \nareas,  wildlife  sanctuaries,  national  parks,  biodiversity-critical  habitats,  or  similar  eco-\nsensitive  areas  will  be  traversed  or  lie  within  the  corridors  of  impact  as  defined  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment.  Four  subprojects  will  upgrade  existing  roads  with  no  additional \nright-of-way requirements, and minor alignment changes will be made in conformance with \nroad  safety  standards.  Only  the  Bhairahawa  bypass  will  require  a  new  alignment  and \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n17 Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Bhairahawa  Bypass  Road,  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Chainpur\u2014\nKhandbari  Road,  Initial  Environmental  Examination:  Harkapur\u2014Okhaldunga  Road,  Initial  Environmental \nExamination: Okhaldunga\u2014Salleri Road (Appendix 2). The Belbari\u2014Chauharwa Road was classified as \u201cC.\u201d \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fconversion  of  predominantly  agricultural  lands,  but  given  its  limited  length  of  less  than  3.5 \nkm, this subproject is not foreseen to generate significant adverse impacts. \n \n35.  Most  impacts  are  likely  to  occur  during  construction  stage,  associated  with  earth \nmovement,  embankment  shaping,  paving,  heavy  equipment  operation,  and  unpaved-road \ntravel. These impacts are temporary in nature, and mitigating measures are readily designed \nand easily implemented. Adequate attention was given to improving drainage and preventing \nerosion  along  rugged  terrain.  Coordinated  efforts  by  the  Department  of  Forest  and Wildlife \nand  DOR  will  be  implemented  for  the  Harkapur\u2013Okhaldhunga  Road  subproject,  including \nsetting  up  a  monitoring  office  in  the  area  to  prevent  illegal  logging  activities  that  may \nincrease once access to the nearby unclassified secondary forest is made easier.  \n \n36. \nNo  irreversible,  diverse,  or  unprecedented  environmental  impacts  are  expected  to \noccur and a further environmental impact assessment is not needed. The Geo-Environment \nand  Social  Unit  of  the  DOR  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  environmental \nmanagement plan, with most activities during construction phase to be implemented by the \ncontractors.  This  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  subproject-specific  monitoring  plans.  The \nGeo-Environment  and  Social  Unit  will  prepare  annual  environmental  audit  reports  for  the \nMPPW during project operation.  \n \n37. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  \"B\"  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. It has been developed with a view to minimize land acquisition \nand  involuntary  resettlement.  Where  possible,  construction  activities  will  take  place  within \nthe existing right-of-way. A census was conducted based on the detailed design. Out of five \nsubprojects, three will have minor land acquisition impacts and no resettlement is envisaged. \nResettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  (i)  Harkapur\u2013Okhaldhunga  road  (42  km),  (ii) \nOkhaldhunga\u2013Salleri road (58 km), and (iii) Bhairahawa bypass (about 3.5 km), to address \nland acquisition and livelihood impacts.  \n \n38. \nIn all, 902 households will be affected by the project, out of which 10 will suffer partial \nimpact  on  their  structures.  Of  those  10,  none  will  be  physically  displaced  since  these \nhouseholds have enough remaining land to construct new structures adjacent to the affected \nstructures.    Only  economically  displaced  households  will  lose  a  strip  of  agricultural  land, \nwhich is identified to be less than 10% of their total land holdings. The displaced households \nwill  be  entitled  to  compensation  for  the  loss  of  land  and/or  structure  (at  replacement  cost) \nand  for  shifting  costs,  and  to  other  income-restoring  assistance.  The  total  cost  for \nimplementing the resettlement plan has been estimated to be NRs487,791,989 ($6.6 million).  \n \n39. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  \"B\"  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  Indigenous  people  constitute  about  37.2%  of  Nepal\u2019s  total \npopulation.  The  government  has  declared  59  groups  as  indigenous  peoples.  The \nparameters  of  defining  them  include  language,  physical  structure,  and  the  religious  and \nsocioeconomic  differences.  The  most  populous  indigenous  group  is  Magar,  followed  by \nTharu, Tamang, Newar, Limbu, Rai, and Sherpa.  \n \n40. \nKey indigenous groups in the project areas are Newar, Magar, Sherpa, and Tamang. \nMeaningful consultations, held in an atmosphere free of coercion, were conducted to ensure \na  comprehensive  perspective  on  the  project  and  its  impacts,  and  to  ascertain  community \nresponse  to  the  project,  their  needs  and  demands  from  the  project,  an  estimate  of  losses \nthat  they  would  suffer,  and  steps  to  mitigate  those  losses.  Social  impact  assessments \nconfirmed  that  indigenous  people  will  not  be  affected  more  than  the  rest  of  the  population \nand  will  benefit  equally  from  the  socioeconomic  opportunities  created  by  the  project.  A \ncombined  indigenous  peoples  plan  and  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  three \nsubprojects.  Adequate  compensation  provisions  have  been  made  in  the  combined  plan  to \nmitigate the impacts on indigenous peoples. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \nF. \n \n41. \nAn  assessment  of  peace  building,  governance  risk,  and  climate  change  was \nundertaken.  The  peace-building  tool  developed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Nepal \nResident Mission helped the overall design, with a stronger focus on people\u2019s participation in \ndecision making, creating opportunities for local employment, avoiding the use of child labor, \nraising  HIV/AIDS  awareness,  carrying  out  skills  training  and  an  anti-trafficking  campaign, \nand  educating  the  people  in  the  zone  of  influence.  The  governance  risk  assessment \nidentified  potential  risks  in  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and  corruption,  as \nalso  mentioned  in  the  due  diligence.  Because  the  country  falls  within  the  mountain \necosystem, climate change would result in accelerated glacial melting, rockfalls, landslides, \nand glacial lake outburst floods. Given that the tracks of the roads already exist and that the \nglaciers and glacial lakes are distant, there is no increased risk from the project. The project \nconsidered  climatic  hazards  and  disaster  proneness,  and,  to  the  extent  possible,  applied \nbuilt-in measures to minimize their adverse impacts as mentioned in the due diligence. \n \n42. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks \nand  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.18  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n43. \nThe  government  and  MPPW  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement,  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and financing documents. \n \n44. \nproject, which are set forth in the financing agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  and  MPPW  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n \n45. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR16,169,000 to Nepal for the \nSubregional  Transport  Enhancement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including \na  grace  period  of  8 years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $24,500,000  to  Nepal,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, for the Subregional Transport Enhancement Project, on terms and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nfinancing agreement presented to the Board. \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n4 October 2010 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n11 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nPost-implementation \nmeasurement \n \nGovernment \nsocioeconomic statistics \n \nBorder post statistics \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks  \n\nAssumptions \nVarious government \ndevelopment activities \neffectively coordinated \nwith road sector \ninvestment \n \nCross-border transport \nis streamlined, e.g., \ncross-border transport \nagreement \n\n \n\n  \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nPromoted economic \ndevelopment of \nNepal\u2019s border areas \nand the remote \nnortheastern hills by \nincreasing domestic \nand regional trades \nthrough expansion of \nthe national and \nsubregional transport \nsystems \n  \n\nOutcome \nImproved connectivity \nof remote areas and \nexpanded the \ncapacity of major \ninternational trade \ncorridors in \nconjunction with the \nmodernization of \ncustoms systems, \nthereby enabling \nefficient and safe \ntransport within the \ncountry and with India \nand, through India, \nwith Bangladesh and \nBhutan. \n \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n \nTraffic volume along the \nproject corridor increased \n20% more than the \ncountry's average traffic \ngrowth rate (13% average \nin the past 5 years) \n \nVolume of cross-border \ntraffic increased by 30% \nmore than the country's \naverage traffic growth rate \n(i.e., 13% in average past \n5 years) \n \nEconomic activities in \nproject-influenced areas \nincreased by 10% more \nthan the country's average \neconomic growth rate (i.e., \n4% in FY2009/10) \n  \n\n \nAverage travel time along \nmajor trade roads covered \nby the project cut by 40% \n(from more than 2 hours) \n \nOpened access to remote \nareas for the whole year \n(from 290 days) \n \nWaiting time for customs \nclearance reduced by 1\u20132 \nhours (from 4 hours for \ndocumentation clearance) \n \nFatality rate along the \nproject corridors not \nexceeding the country's \naverage fatality rate (i.e., \n25 per 10,000 motorized \nvehicles) \n \nImproved women\u2019s access \nto social services, health-\ncare services, education \nfacilities, supply of drinking \nwater, and employment \nopportunity \n \n\nAssumptions \nTimely and quality \nproject delivery \n \nTransport modes and \nservices available for \nthe project roads \n \nThe government \nprovides routine and \nperiodic maintenance \nthroughout the project \nlife. \n\n \nPost-implementation \nmeasurement \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccident data \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGender impact \nassessment \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \nImproved awareness of \ngender issues, child labor, \nHIV/AIDS, and human \ntrafficking \n \n\nOutputs \n1.
