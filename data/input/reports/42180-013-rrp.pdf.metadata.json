Underinvestment  results \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nImpressive  economic growth. Bangladesh has achieved substantial economic growth \nover  the  last  15  years.  From  1996  to  2009,  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  increased  at  a \ncompounded annual growth rate of 5.6%. In FY2012, the Bangladesh economy grew at 6.2%, \nmainly  as  a  result  of  manufacturing  and  agricultural  sector  growth;  this  was  a  slight  decrease \nfrom 2011, when the economy grew at 6.7%.2 \n \nin  the \n3. \navailability and reliability of Bangladesh\u2019s infrastructure\u2014including electrical power, natural gas \nexploration, ports, railways, and roads\u2014and prevents the country from achieving its full growth \npotential.  Continued  underinvestment  has  resulted  in  poor  access  to  basic  infrastructure  for \nmuch  of  Bangladesh's  population,  particularly  the  rural  population,  and  those  who  are \neconomically disadvantaged. Deficient infrastructure and the lack of regional integration restricts \ninvestment, including foreign direct investment.3 \n \nBangladesh suffers from a chronic shortage of electrical power which, adversely impacts \n4. \nthe economy. Gas is the main energy source used for generating electricity, but is insufficient to \nmeet  the  current  demand.  The  supply  of  electrical  power  is  28%  short  of  demand.4 Energy \nshortages  are  undermining  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  causing  an  annual  estimated  loss  of \n2% of GDP; the situation is not expected to improve in the short term, because gas production \nis  projected  to  decline  beginning  in  2019.5 Securing  new  sources  of  energy  locally  or  abroad \n(e.g.,  coal  or  liquid  natural  gas)  will  take  time  because  of the  need for  policy  decisions  largely \nrelated  to  setting  energy  tariffs  at  market  levels.  Energy  efficiency  measures  can,  to  some \nextent, provide a cost-effective response to energy shortages. Poor road conditions and lack of \ntransportation and means of communication (only 1.5% reported to have access to a fixed-line \ntelephone  service)  add  to  the  costs  for  Bangladesh\u2019s  economy  and  leave  the  potential  for \ngrowth  in  rural  areas  unfulfilled.  Access  to  hygienic  sanitation  and  safe  water  is  alarmingly \ninadequate.  In  addition,  Bangladesh  cannot  reach  its  full  potential  to  be  a  transport 6  and \ntransshipment  hub,  and  this  limits  the  country\u2019s  opportunities  for  economic  integration  with  its \nneighbors. \n \nThe  public  sector  is  the  main  provider  of  basic  infrastructure  in  Bangladesh,  as  is  the \n5. \ncase  in  most  of  South  Asia.  However,  public  financing  alone  cannot  generate  the  investment \nneeded  to  provide  the  required  level  of  infrastructure  facilities.  The  financial  performance  of \nmost  public  service  providers  is  weak,  with  inadequate  investment.  The  government  has \nrecognized the need to create an enabling environment to attract sustained private investment, \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n6  As a result of inadequate transport infrastructure, the average cost of exports is estimated to be 80% higher and \n\n35% for imports higher than for most countries in South Asia. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nand  introduced  (i)  a  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  budget  for  FY2010,  and  the  Policy  and \nStrategy for  Public\u2013Private  Partnership (PPP),  2010;7 and  (ii)  enabling  arrangements to  bridge \nthe  deficit  in  infrastructure  financing,  especially  for  long-term  funds.  These  arrangements \ninclude  establishment  of  the  Bangladesh  Infrastructure  Finance  Fund  Limited,  a  long-term \ncapital  funding  vehicle  that  seeks  to  raise  debt  capital  markets  funding  from  retail  and \ninstitutional investors to support construction and take-out financing for PPP subprojects.8 \n \n6. \nUnderdeveloped  capital  markets.  Private  investors  in  Bangladesh  face  challenges  in \nsourcing  domestic,  long-term  financing  for  infrastructure.  Bangladesh\u2019s  capital  markets, \nincluding the long-term corporate debt market, remain underdeveloped.9 The volume of funding \nsourced from the local debt and equity market for private investment expenditure is small, and \nprivate  sector  sponsors  rely  primarily  on  banks  and  internal  resources  rather  than  market \nborrowings,  indicating  weakness  in  debt  markets.  Banks  in  Bangladesh  are  facing  maturity \nmismatches  in  their  asset  and  liability  management;  they  rely  on  short-term  deposits  as  their \nfinancial  source,  and  this  prevents  them  from  providing  long-term  financing  for  infrastructure \nsubprojects.  Currently,  the  Infrastructure  Development  Company  Limited  (IDCOL)  is  the  only \nfinancial institution in Bangladesh that has the ability to provide long-tenor dollar financing. \n \n7. \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for Bangladesh emphasizes the need for \nsupport of private sector-led infrastructure development. This is in line with Bangladesh\u2019s Sixth \nFive-Year Plan for 2011\u20132015, which focuses on increasing the growth rate of the economy and \nreducing  poverty  by  substantially  boosting  private  sector \ninvestment  and  developing \ninfrastructure.  In  particular,  it  emphasizes  the  need  to  triple  investment  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment, from 2% to 6% of GDP, with substantial private sector participation through PPPs. \nThe  project  objectives  are  also  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Operational  Plan,10 which \nprioritizes capital market development for infrastructure finance and financial inclusion. \n \n8. \nThe proposed Second Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF II)  will \nbuild  on  the  efforts  of  the  Public\u2013Private  Infrastructure  Development  Facility  (PPIDF  I)  by \nhelping  to  provide  long-term  debt  financing  and  catalyze  private  sector  participation  through \nIDCOL. This will support poverty reduction through enhanced investment, economic growth, and \nincreased employment opportunities. The design of the project will attract commercial financing \nfor  infrastructure  subprojects,  thereby  reducing  the  pressure  on  the  government  budget.  An \nadditional objective of the project is to help provide the rural population and small- to medium-\nsized  enterprises  in  off-grid  areas  with  access  to  electricity  generated  using  solar  and  other \nrenewable technologies. \n \n9. \nOverview  of  the  Public\u2013Private  Infrastructure  Development  Facility.  PPIDF  I  was \napproved  on  2  October  2008  and  was  designed  to  (i)  provide  $82  million  financing  to  the \ngovernment  for  relending  to  IDCOL  to  finance  private  sector-sponsored  large  infrastructure \nsubprojects (component A); (ii) provide $50 million equivalent in support to the government for \nrelending  in  local  currency  to  IDCOL  to  finance  small-  and  medium-sized  infrastructure \n\n                                                 \n7   A  draft  PPP  law,  developed  with  ADB  assistance,  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  Parliament  prior  to  the  2013 \nand/or 2014 elections; it includes rules relating to approval and assessment of all PPP subprojects in Bangladesh. \n8   ADB.  2010.

Manila (http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/ \n    financial-sector-operational-plan.pdf) \n\n\fsubprojects  (component  B);  and  (iii)  provide  $33  million  in  funding  to  the  government  for \nrelending in local currency to IDCOL for the purpose of promoting renewable energy systems in \nBangladesh (component C). In addition, supplementary grant financing totaling $3.3 million from \nthe Asian Clean Energy Fund and the Climate Change Fund for component C was approved on \n17 May 2011. \n \n10. \nCurrent  status  of  Public\u2013Private  Infrastructure  Development  Facility. As of August \n2013, $22.2 million has been disbursed under component A of PPIDF for the partial funding of a \nsubloan  ($30  million  total)  for  a  108  megawatt  heavy  furnace  oil-based  power  project  in  the \nChittagong area sponsored by a local company. It is expected that the total subloan amount will \nbe fully disbursed by IDCOL by September 2013. IDCOL\u2019s board has further approved another \nsub-loan  of  $30  million  for  a  gas-fired  power  plant  outside  of  Dhaka.  IDCOL  is  in  final \nnegotiations with the sponsor to provide a senior loan of up to $30 million for the financing of a \n335 megawatt gas-fired power plant. \n \n11. \nFull utilization of Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility. It is expected \nthat component A of PPIDF I will be fully utilized by the first quarter of 2014. Under component \nB,  ADB  has  made  only  one  disbursement  of  $4.9  million  in  April  2010  to  provide  IDCOL  with \nfunds to finance two companies involved in the information technology sector. Given the rapid \nand  successful  utilization  of  the  funds  for  IDCOL\u2019s  renewable  energy  program,  ADB \nManagement  reallocated  the  remaining  undisbursed  amount  ($45  million)  to  component  C, \nbringing the total loan amount under component C to $78 million. This was used by IDCOL to \nfinance 330,362 solar home systems (SHSs). As of June 2013, components B and C had been \nfully utilized, except for a liquidation of imprest advance of $3.3 million. IDCOL is implementing \ntwo supplementary grants totaling $3.3 million from the Asian Clean Energy Fund (administered \nby  ADB)  and  the  Climate  Change  Fund  to  provide  grant  subsidies  to  the  SHS  program  and \nfinance two or three solar mini-grid pilot systems, as well as 100 fiberglass bio-digesters. \n \nLessons  learned. While PPIDF II represents a continuation of the first facility, it builds \n12. \non  lessons from  PPIDF I  and  includes  new features:  (i) the  total  cost  of  eligible  subprojects  is \nreduced from $30 million to $10 million to facilitate the financing of a larger number of medium- \nto  large-size  infrastructure  subprojects;  (ii)  the  component  for  financing  small-  and  medium-\nsized  infrastructure  subprojects  (up  to  $5  million)  is  eliminated,  because  such  funding  is \navailable  locally;  (iii)  IDCOL  intends  to  increase  the  participation  of  women  in  the  training  and \nawareness campaign on renewable energy applications to 20%; (iv) although the introduction of \na  comprehensive  environmental  and  social  management  system  has  worked  well  and  has \nhelped to enhance the capacity of IDCOL to assess environmental and social issues associated \nwith subprojects, training of project sponsors and cofinanciers on such issues will be continued; \n(v)  IDCOL  has  adopted  a  policy  to  ensure  women\u2019s  concerns  are  considered  during  the  SHS \ninstallation  process;11 and  (vi)  an  enhanced  battery  recycling  policy  is  included  in  the  IDCOL \nSHS program. \n \n13. \nProposed  financing  modalities.  PPIDF  II  comprises  two  outputs:  (i)  output  1  will  use \nthe proceeds from the ordinary capital resources sovereign loan of up to $100 million to provide \nIDCOL  with  long-term  additional  resources  for  the  financing  of  medium-  to  large-sized  private \nsector-led infrastructure subprojects (total subproject cost $10 million or more); and (ii) output 2 \nwill  route  the  proceeds  from  the  sovereign  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  of  up  to  $10  million \nthrough  IDCOL  for  the  further  expansion  of  the  successful  SHS  program,  which  has  provided \nfinancing  of  more  than  2  million  SHSs  through  a  microfinance-based,  direct  sales  program  in \n                                                 \n11 IDCOL has adopted a new policy that requires staff of participating organizations to focus more on consultations \nwith female household members during SHS installations to ensure that the installation of items such as light bulbs \nand power outlets meet the needs of women. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nrural  off-grid  areas  to  provide  households  and  small  businesses  with  a  renewable  source  of \nenergy.  Output  1  will  provide  funding  directly  to  subborrowers  by  providing  long-term  loans  to \ninfrastructure subprojects, while output 2 will channel funding from IDCOL through participating \norganizations to the end-users, which are typically households in off-grid areas. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  development  of  infrastructure,  including \nrenewable  energy  facilities.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  increased  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development, including in renewable energy facilities. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nThe  two  outputs  aim  to  address  Bangladesh\u2019s  infrastructure  deficiencies  by  providing \ninfrastructure  financing,  including  for  renewable  energy,  in  light  of  the  country\u2019s  substantial \nexposure to climate change-induced risks. \n \n16. \nOutput  1:  Financing  of  medium-  to  large-sized  private  sector-led  infrastructure \nsubprojects.  The  output  will  be  achieved  by  providing  a  foreign  currency  denominated  credit \nline of $100 million. The eligible subsectors, which meet the government\u2019s current priority plan, \ninclude:  (i)  power  generation\u2014given  the  country\u2019s  acute  power  shortage  this  is  expected  to \nreceive  priority  in  terms  of  financing;  (ii)  roads  and  bridges;  (iii)  railways;  (iv)  ports  (including \nseaports  and  airports);  (v)  gas  and  gas-related  infrastructure;  (vi)  water  supply,  sewage,  and \nsolid  waste  management;  (vii)  information  technology;  (viii)  renewable  energy;  and  (ix)  other \ninfrastructure  development  subprojects  as  may  be  approved  by  the  government,  ADB,  and \nIDCOL\u2019s board. This output will enable IDCOL to provide dollar or taka funding for up to 40% of \nthe costs of an individual private sector-sponsored subproject that is financially viable and has \nan economic rate of return of at least 12%; the subproject sponsor will be required to invest a \nminimum of 20% of the total subproject cost as equity, thereby better balancing the risk factors \nbetween the subproject sponsor and the government via IDCOL. The current pipeline includes \neight subprojects with a total investment amount of approximately $235 million, all in the energy \nsector.  IDCOL  is  presently  conducting  due  diligence,  including  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards,  on  these  subprojects.  The  company  is  also  intensifying  its  collaboration  with  the \nPPP office, which has a list of more than 20 transactions in other (non-power) sectors.12 \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Financing  of  IDCOL\u2019s  SHS  program.  The  output  will  be  achieved  by \nproviding  IDCOL  a  credit  line  of $10  million for  its  ongoing  SHS  program,  which  is  a  demand-\ndriven  model for  increasing  access  to  electricity in  remote  rural  areas,  where grid  connections \nare economically unfeasible or will not be made in the next 10 years. IDCOL first financed SHSs \nin  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank  in  2002.  The  initial  target  of  financing  50,000  SHSs  was \nachieved  in  August  2005,  3  years  ahead  of  the  target  date,  and  $2  million  below  estimated \ncosts.  The  company  achieved  its  target  of  2  million  installations  in  April  2013,  and  has  now \nincreased its goal, seeking to finance 4 million SHSs by 2015. \n\n \n18. \nThe  IDCOL  SHS  program  provides  refinancing,  sets  technical  specifications  for \nequipment,  develops  publicity  materials,  extends  loans,  oversees  system  installation  and \nmonitors system performance, and provides maintenance support. In particular, IDCOL provides \n \n \n\n                                                 \n12  IDCOL will coordinate with the PPP office as required under the Policy and Strategy for Public\u2013Private Partnership \n\n(PPP), 2010. \n\n \n\n\f(i) loans at 6%\u20138% (per annum) to participating organizations,13 which then provide customers \nin rural areas with financing of up to 80%  of  the  cost  of  an  SHS  with  a  capacity  of  10\u2013130 \nwatts; 14 (ii)  loans  to  companies  for  biomass  installations  in  rural  or  semi-urban  areas,  and \nfinancing for commercial and semi-commercial biogas plants or biogas-based electricity plants; \n(iii) loans and grants for solar irrigation pumps; and (iv) loans and grants to companies for the \nfinancing of solar mini-grid systems. \n \n19. \nHouseholds  can  pay  for  SHSs  with  cash  or  credit.  Participating  organizations  extend \nloans on various terms and conditions to the households for purchase of SHSs. The loan tenor \nvaries  from  1\u20135  years,  and  the  interest  rate  varies  from  8%\u201315%  per  annum  on  a  declining \nbalance  method,  and  10%\u201315%  per  annum  on  equal  principal  payment  method.  In  all  cases, \npayments are made monthly. \n \n20. \nUse  of  donor  funds.  Funds  used  by  IDCOL for  refinancing  stem  primarily  from  donor \nloans  channeled  through  the  government.  IDCOL\u2019s  main  responsibility  is  to  raise  and  channel \nfunding in the form of loans to participating organizations and to monitor the overall performance \nof SHS program.  \n \nD. \n \nThe project is estimated to cost $385.5 million (Table 1). The government has requested \n21. \na  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  output  1  of  the \nproject.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  annual \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,15 a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreement. The loan proceeds will be relent to \nIDCOL  in  (i)  dollars  at  LIBOR  plus  100  basis  points  per  annum  and  for  a  20-year  term  with  a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  or  (ii)  in  taka  at the  Bangladesh  bank rate  with  a  20-year  term  and  a \ngrace period of 5 years pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement, with the government bearing \nthe foreign exchange risks. Onlending by IDCOL to eligible private sector subprojects will be at \ninterest  rates  that reflect  IDCOL\u2019s  cost  of funds plus  a  spread to  cover  transactions  costs  and \nrisks following full commercial and competitive terms at IDCOL\u2019s discretion. \n \n22. \nThe  government  has  also  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR6,599,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance output 2 of the project. The \nAsian Development Fund loan will have a 25-year term, a 5-year grace period, and an interest \ncharge of 2.0% per annum throughout the loan tenor, and such other terms and conditions set \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n                                                 \n13 IDCOL\u2019s  renewable  energy  program  is  innovative  because  it  is  implemented  through  participating  organizations, \nwhich are nongovernment organizations, microfinance institutions, and private entities. These organizations select \nsubproject  areas  and  potential  customers,  extend  loans,  install  the  systems,  monitor  their  performance,  and \nprovide maintenance and technical support; this allows IDCOL to benefit from their grassroots networks, which are \nvital for introducing efficient technology to underdeveloped rural areas and encouraging community participation. \n14 SHSs are small photovoltaic systems with a peak capacity of 10\u2013130 watts; they comprise a solar panel, battery, \ncharge controller, wires, and loads. The estimated lifespan of the SHS outputs is: solar panel, 20 years; battery, 5\u2013\n7  years;  charge  controller,  3  years.  Maintenance  and  service  are  provided  at  no  cost  for  3  years  (systems  are \nchecked by staff of a participating organization while collecting the monthly installment payments). After the 3-year \npayback  period,  maintenance  is  provided  by  the  participating  organizations  for  a  minimal  monthly  fee.  Because \nSHS  users  own  their systems,  they  will  be  motivated  to keep  the  system  running.  Monthly  installment  payments \nend  after  the  payback  period,  and  thus  payment  of  a  small  monthly  service  fee  and  replacement  of  the  battery \nevery 5 years will not be a major financial obstacle. SHSs are used mainly by low- and middle-class households, \nand micro- and small enterprises in off-grid rural locations to operate light bulbs, small electrical appliances such as \nmobile chargers, and black and white television sets. The price of a typical 50 watt SHS is about $400. \n\n15  The  interest  includes  a  maturity  premium  of  10  basis  points.  This  is  based  on  the  above  loan  terms  and  the \n\ngovernment\u2019s choice of repayment options and dates. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nforth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreement.  The  government  will  make  the  loan  available  to \nIDCOL at a fixed rate of 3% under a subsidiary loan agreement with a term of 20 years and a \ngrace period of 5 years. The proposed onlending terms reflect current market rates for this type \nof  intervention  (the  financing  of  renewable  energy  installations  in  rural  areas  in  Bangladesh). \nThe government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \n23. \nBank and Japan International Cooperation Agency.16 \n \n\nADB has agreed on collaborative cofinancing arrangements for output 2 with the World \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\n \nSource \nADB \n\nOutput 1 (OCR) \nOutput 2 (ADF) \n\nCofinanciers \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n110.0 \n100.0 \n10.0 \n195.5 \n99.5 \n96.0 \n30.0 \n50.0 \n385.5 \n\nShare Total \n(%) \n28 \n26 \n2 \n51 \n26 \n25 \n8 \n13 \n100 \n\nWorld Banka \nJICAb \nGovernment \nPrivate sector investorsc \nTotal \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  JICA  =  Japan  International  Cooperation \n\nAgency, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \na The Second Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project of the World Bank consists of a loan \nof $99.45 million from the International Development Association to support Infrastructure Development Company \nLimited\u2019s  solar  home  system    (SHS)  program  and  a  loan  of  $16.55  million  for  the  financing  of  solar  mini-grid \ninstallations. \nb  JICA  approved  in  March  2013  a  concessional  loan  of  $122.48  million  for  IDCOL\u2019s  SHS  program  under  the \nRenewable Energy Development Project of which $96 million is earmarked for IDCOL\u2019s SHS program. \nc This assumes that the sponsor will provide equity financing of 20% of total project cost\u2014private sector banks and \nfinanciers will provide debt funding of 40% of total project cost while IDCOL will finance 40% of each project, which \nis the maximum threshold permitted under its investment guidelines. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank and Government of Bangladesh estimates. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nE. \n \n24. \nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  acting  through  its  Economic  Relations \nDivision,  will  be  the  executing  agency  while  the  Finance  Division  will  be  the  financial \nmanagement  agency,  and  IDCOL  will  be  the  implementing  agency  of  the  project.  Policy \ndirection and strategic oversight will be provided by IDCOL\u2019s board of directors. IDCOL\u2019s project \nmanagement unit, established under PPIDF I, will (i) monitor the day-to-day implementation of \nthe  loans;  (ii)  build  capacity  within  IDCOL  in  areas  of  monitoring  exposure  limits,  process \nimprovements,  risk  assessment,  and  analysis;  and  (iii)  ensure  compliance  with  state  and \nnational  policies  and  IDCOL's  environmental  and  social  safeguard  framework,  which  ensures \ncompliance with ADB safeguard policies and national norms. \n \n25. \nthe project administration manual.17 \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \n\nArrangements \nFebruary 2014\u2013January 2019 \n\nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n16 See  detailed  memorandum  of  understanding.

For  PPIDF  II,  it  is  proposed  to \nfollow the same implementation arrangements that were used in PPIDF I, which require IDCOL \nto obtain ADB approval of each subproject in terms of technical efficiency and ADB and national \nsafeguards policies. With regard to the renewable energy technology provided, the technology \nis  well  tested  and  the  end  beneficiaries  expressed  satisfaction.  ADB  encourages  IDCOL  to \ncontinually review and update technology as soon as it becomes available in Bangladesh. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nInfrastructure is a major hurdle in Bangladesh\u2019s effort to promote sustainable economic \ngrowth and achieve its poverty reduction objectives. Energy shortages alone cause substantial \nlosses  in  economic  output  and  cost  approximately  2%  of  GDP  annually.  More  generally,  the \noverall  deficient  infrastructure  prevents  Bangladesh  benefitting  from  its  strategic  location  as  a \npotential transport  and  transshipment  hub,  including the  opportunity  of  substantially  increasing \nforeign direct investment inflows. Financing infrastructure through this project will result in higher \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nindustrial output, attract foreign investment, and create employment. \n \n28. \nIDCOL  is  fully  owned  by  the  government  and  is  one  of  the  highest-rated  domestic \nfinancial  institutions.  IDCOL  was  first  rated  AA  by  the  Credit  Rating  Information  and  Services \nLimited  and  AA1  by  the  Credit  Rating  Agency  of  Bangladesh  in  2007.  IDCOL  has  an  eight-\nmember  board  of  directors\u2014four  directors  are  drawn  from  the  public  sector,  three  from  the \nprivate  sector,  and  one  ex-officio  member\u2014and  the  board  is  largely  independent  from  IDCOL \nmanagement. Since 2008, when it received support through PPIDF I, IDCOL has increased its \ncapital  base,  demonstrated  positive  cash  flows,  multiplied  profits,  and  gained  experience  in \nproject finance,  including  safeguard  policies.  IDCOL\u2019s  credit  rating  of AA1  was  reconfirmed  by \nthe Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh in June 2012. \n\n \nThe  financial  management  of  the  project  will  be  handled  by  IDCOL,  which  has  the \n29. \ncapacity and knowledge to appraise infrastructure and renewable energy subprojects, and has \nsatisfactory  financial  management  abilities.  However,  based  on  the  financial  management \nassessment,  IDCOL  needs  to  further  strengthen  its  risk  management  and  public  disclosure \nrequirements, including pricing and monitoring on interest rate risks. As a condition for the first \ndrawdown of any funds under output 1 of PPIDF II, ADB will therefore require that IDCOL hire at \nleast  one  experienced  risk  manager  who  will  provide  independent  assessments  of  the \nsubprojects  that  the  company  intends  to  finance  (e.g.,  regarding  pricing,  counterparty  risk, \nexposure limits, and credit analysis). \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n \nThere will be no procurement directly financed under the project. As it was the case in \n30. \nPPIDF  I,  ADB  will  encourage  IDCOL  to  require  its  subborrowers  to  adopt  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  in \naccordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \ncountry\u2019s  procurement  laws  and  procedures  have  improved  in  the  recent  years  due  to  major \nprocurement reforms implemented by the government and capacity development support from \nthe  development  partners.  The  government  recently \nlaunched  electronic  government \nprocurement system in four large public sector agencies. \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  IDCOL.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 16). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \nThe  project  will  benefit  all  citizens,  including  the  poor,  through  the  financing  of  high-\n32. \nquality infrastructure that will create jobs, spur economic growth, and attract foreign investment. \nIn addition, the financing of renewable sources of energy in off-grid areas will improve the well-\nbeing of citizens in these areas, including the poor. \n \n33. \nThe  SHSs  have  greatly  improved  the  quality  of  life  of  rural  households,  and  the \nproductivity  and  profitability  of  local  businesses.  The  current  rate  of  750,000  SHS  installations \nper  year  far  exceeds  the  rate  of  grid  connections.18 The  rapid  growth  of  this  demand-driven \n                                                 \n18 The number of participating organizations involved in the SHS program has grown from 5 to 42, and they compete \nvigorously to provide attractive credit packages to consumers. These organizations conduct their own due diligence \nto  extend  loans  to  households.  The  implementation  mechanism  of  the  IDCOL  approach has  proved  sustainable. \nThese  organizations  have  an  average  loan  collection  efficiency  of  about  96%,  while  fully  servicing  their  debts  to \nIDCOL on time. \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nprogram  demonstrates  the  high  value  that  the  households  place  on  getting  off-grid  electricity \nservices.  Meanwhile,  this  off-grid  option  reduces  pressure  on  the  government  budget  for  grid \nexpansion. \n \nPoverty  impact.  Under PPIDF  I,  a total  of  330,362  SHS  have  been  funded  by  IDCOL \n34. \nusing the proceeds from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund loan. Assuming that each SHS saves \nat  least  $61.8  worth  of  kerosene  each  year  and  reduces  carbon  dioxide  emissions  by  375 \nkilograms  annually,  it  is  expected  that  the  ADB  program  will  save  $408  million  and  reduce \ncarbon  dioxide  emissions  by  2,476  tons  over  the  20-year  lifecycle  of  the  SHSs.  PPIDF  II  is \nexpected to fund 42,355 SHS leading to $52.3 million in savings and a reduction of 317 tons of \ncarbon dioxide emissions over the 20-year lifecycle of the SHSs. \n \nGender  and  social  dimensions.  The  project  will  support\u2014through  the  environmental \n35. \nand social safeguards management unit of IDCOL\u2014gender and social dimensions. IDCOL will \ndisseminate  information  to  its  subborrowers  on  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  National  Policy  for \nWomen\u2019s  Advancement,  which  has  been  reflected  in  the  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan;  and  (ii) \nBangladesh  Bank\u2019s  Department  of  Financial  Institutions  and  Markets  Circular  no.  2  on \nMainstreaming Corporate Social Responsibility in Financial Institutions, which requires financial \ninstitutions to report on gender equality-related performance indicators biannually. \n \nE. \n \n36. \nAccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified  as \nfinancial intermediary for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. As \nthe  proceeds  from  the  proposed  ordinary  capital  resources  loan  will  be  used  by  one  or  more \nprivate  sector  sponsors  to  finance  subprojects,  there  is  a  potential  risk  that  some  of  those \ndevelopers may not fully adhere to ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements during implementation. The \nproject team will assess project-specific environmental impact assessment and/or resettlement \nplans as well as each sponsors' environmental management, involuntary resettlement, impacts \non  indigenous  peoples  arising  from  land  acquisition,  changes  in  land  use,  adherence  to  core \nlabor  standards,  or  restrictions  of  access  to  resources  and  social  protection  framework  and \npolicies, and assess where enhancements may need to be made by the company. IDCOL has \nadopted the environmental and social safeguard framework and improved its in-house capacity \nwith ADB support.19 IDCOL will continue to ensure all subproject proposals to be financed under \nthe  PPIDF  II  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  safeguard  framework.  IDCOL  has  hired  a \nqualified environmental and social safeguards specialist to build in-house capacity. \n \n37. \naccording \nenvironmental and social management framework.20 \n \nF. \n \n38. \nImplementing infrastructure subprojects in Bangladesh is challenging, but sufficient risk \nmitigations measures have been introduced to the project design to justify ADB financing. Major \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n                                                 \n19 Infrastructure  Development  Company  Limited.  2011.
