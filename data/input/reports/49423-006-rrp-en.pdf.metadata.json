The ongoing project includes four main outputs: (i) national transmission\nnetwork in southern Bangladesh strengthened (output 1); (ii) distribution network in Dhaka Electric\nSupply  Company  Limited  areas  improved  (output  2);  (iii)  distribution  network  in  rural  areas  of\nBangladesh, including the capacity of end users, improved (output 3); and (iv) capacity in power\nsector agencies enhanced (output 4). The proposed additional financing will further improve the\nelectricity distribution network in rural areas (output 3) in the Khulna division, one of the poorest\ndivisions in Bangladesh.1\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nII.\n\nTHE PROJECT\n\n3.\nPerformance  of  the  project.  The  proposed  project  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  for\nadditional  financing  as  the  overall  project  is  (i)  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and\nfinancially sound; (ii) accorded high priority by the government; (iii) consistent with the project\u2019s \ndevelopment objective; and (iv) consistent with the country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, \n2021\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 The ongoing project is performing well  as\n(i) the project is rated on track under the project performance rating system; (ii) each safeguard\ncovenant item is complied with; (iii) delivery of expected outputs, including implementation of the\ngender action plan, is rated successful; and (iv) the management of risks is rated successful as\nall  the  risks  included  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan  have  been  managed\nsuccessfully. As of 18 September 2020, cumulative contract awards on the loans and grant were\n$602.47 million (97.53%) while disbursements were $456.99 million (75.9%).3\n\n4.\nRelevance  of  the  project  during  COVID-19  pandemic.  Reliable  electricity  supply  is\nlifeline  infrastructure  in  rural  areas  both  under  normal  circumstances  and  during  and  after  the\ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic.  During  the  COVID-19  restrictions,  the  electricity\nsupply has been one of the most critical inputs to support essential services, such as health care,\nagricultural  activities  and  food  supply  services,  and  online  businesses  for  basic  social  needs.\nFurther, reliable electricity supply is essential for household activities during times of lockdown,\nsuch as working from home and online education for school-age children.\n\nCOVID-19 has also significantly reduced the growth prospects of Bangladesh,4 and the\n5.\npandemic will ultimately impact the rural poor more since they are the most vulnerable and the\nleast resilient. Increased government spending is necessary to revive the economy. Infrastructure\nspending on rural power distribution system improvements will generate local employment, help\nmaintain access by rural communities to health services and medical supplies, and enhance the\nlong-term growth prospects of the economy.\n\n1  Approved Report and Recommendation of the President for the Original Project (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n2   ADB. 2020. Bangladesh: Country Operations Business Plan, 2021\u20132023. Manila.\n3   Cumulative contract awards on Output 3 amount to $417.25 million while disbursements amount to $385.76 million   \n\n(81.08% of awarded contracts). \n\n4   ADB. Economic Indicators for Bangladesh. https://www.adb.org/countries/bangladesh/economy. \n\n\f2 \n\nSuitability  of  using  the  additional  financing  modality.  The  additional  financing  is\n6.\nstrongly  linked  to  the  ongoing  project\u2019s  outputs  and  outcome  and  provides  efficiency  gains  by\nexpanding  the  scope  of  an  existing  output,  using  the  same  designs  and  implementation\narrangements and building upon the due diligence of the ongoing project.\n\n7.\nSector  performance.  About  50%  of  installed  power  generation  capacity  has  private\nsector investment. The transmission company and distribution company serving the capital city\nhave transformed into companies listed in the market to raise capital for investment needs. The\nrural  electrification  subsector,  which  serves  low-income  customers,  adopts  the  consumers\u2019\ncooperative  model.  The  sector  has  been  progressing  to  decarbonize,  as  committed  to  in  the\nnationally  determined  contributions  for  Bangladesh,  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and\ndeveloping  domestic  renewable  energy  resources,  among  others.5  Also,  Bangladesh,  which  is\nalready importing power from India, has plans to expand imports in the form of clean energy from\nneighboring  countries  such  as  Bhutan  and  Nepal.  This  is  supported  under  the  South  Asia\nSubregional Economic Cooperation. 6\n\nStrategic  context.  The  overall  project\u2019s  impact  continues  to  be  aligned  with  (i)  the\n8.\ngovernment\u2019s Perspective Plan of Bangladesh, 2010\u20132021: Making Vision 2021 a Reality,7 and\nthe  7th  Five-Year  Plan,8  which  is  accorded  high  priority  by  the  government;  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  country\npartnership strategy and country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023 for Bangladesh (footnote\n2); and (iii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 20309 by further improving access to efficient and reliable electricity\nsupply in the rural areas of Bangladesh.\n\nB.\n\nProject Description\n\n9.\nThe impacts and outcome of the overall project will remain unchanged. The overall project\nis  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  100%  access  to  power  by  2021  and  power  sector\nsustainability  improved  in  Bangladesh  by  2030.10  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:\naccess to efficient and reliable electricity supply in Bangladesh improved.11\n\n10.\nThe project will install an additional 990 kilometers (km) of 33 kilovolt (kV) and 3,000 km\nof  11  kV  below  distribution  lines  and  associated  facilities,  including  51  units  of  33  kV/11  kV\nsubstations in rural areas in Khulna division, which will expand output 3 (distribution network in\nrural areas of Bangladesh improved) of the ongoing project. This will result in increasing electricity\naccess to 150,000 rural households.\n\n5  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests.  2015.

The proposed project will expand these efforts in the form of creating an inclusive working\nenvironment  by  renovating  the  existing  BREB\u2019s  offices  with  designs  that  cater  to  the  elderly,\nwomen,  children,  and  disabled  people.  This  includes  separate  toilets,  women\u2019s  restrooms,\nseparate  prayer  rooms,  and  ramps  for  the  disabled.  The  proposed  project  will  also  conduct  a \ngender  analysis  of  the  BREB\u2019s  corporate  structure  and  develop  a  corporate  gender  equality\nstrategy for the BREB. \n\nD.\n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plans\n\n13.\n\nThe additional financing is estimated to cost $313.5 million (Table 1).\n\nDetailed cost estimates by expenditure category and detailed cost estimates by financier\n14.\nare included in the project administration manual (PAM).13 The major expenditure items for the\nproject are works and goods.\n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nCurrent \nAmounta \n\nAdditional \nFinancingb \n\n145.5 \n\n18.2 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\nTotal \n\n145.5 \n\n18.2 \n\nItem \nA.

The executing agency of the additional financing\nproject is the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, and implementing agency is the\nBREB,  which  distributes  the  electricity  in  rural  areas  in  Bangladesh.  The  same  project\nimplementation unit established within the BREB will be responsible for the implementation of the\nadditional  financing  project.  The  implementation  period  of  the  additional  financing  will  be  from\nJanuary 2021 to December 2025. The implementation arrangements are described in detail in\nthe PAM (footnote 13).\n\n14 Details are in the Project Administration Manual and Updated Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fA.\n\nSummary Due Diligence Results\n\nIII.\n\nDUE DILIGENCE\n\nA  summary  of  the  due  diligence  assessments  for  the  proposed  additional  financing  is\n19.\npresented in Table 3. The full due diligence assessments are accessible from the list of linked\ndocuments in Appendix 2.\n\n5 \n\nArea of \nAssessment \nTechnical \n\nEconomic and \nfinancial viability \n\nSustainability \n\nGovernance \n\nTable 3: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \n\nSummary of Assessment \nTechnology to be utilized for the project is quite standard and is the same for the \nongoing project. The BREB has broad experience in procurement, construction, \nand commissioning for this type of project. Therefore, the technology risk is low. \nThe project\u2019s economic internal rate of return was estimated at  14.7% with the\nenvironmental  benefits,  well  above  the  9.0%  economic  cost  of  capital,  making \nthe  project  economically  viable.  Sensitivity  testing  indicated  that  the  project  is \nlikely to remain sustainable in the face of adverse economic impact of various \ntypes. \n\nFinancial analysis of the project indicated that the project is financially viable, with \na financial internal rate of return of 2.6%, exceeding the weighted average cost \nof  capital  of  2.2%.  Sensitivity  analysis  with  5%  increase  in  capital  cost,  5% \nincrease  in  operation  and  maintenance  cost,  3%  increase  in  power  purchase \ncost, 3% decrease in  benefit, and 1-year delay in implementation showed that \nthe project is sensitive in the case of changes in power purchase cost and benefit. \nThe BREB has a well-established maintenance planning and budget allocation \nsystem. It has assigned 71 qualified staff members to operate and maintain the \ninvested assets over the economic life. It has also gained extensive experience \nin operating and maintaining power distribution assets since its establishment in \n1977, and has received training from various donors. The electricity tariff is based \non the tariff set by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission in February \n2020.a  The  utilities  are  required  to  file  periodically  for  tariff  increases  to  cover \ncosts. This will help improve financial sustainability of the overall project and  of \nthe BREB. \nFinancial  management.  The  BREB  has  been  performing  satisfactorily  on  the \nongoing  project  and  will  continue  to  handle  all  project  financial  matters  for  the \nadditional  financing.  The  updated  financial  management  capacity  assessment \nconcluded that the overall project financial management risk is  moderate. This \nrating  is  based  on  the  observation  that  the  project  implementation  unit  is \nwell-established and functioning well. To further improve corporate governance, \nthe BREB will continue to strengthen its internal audit function and enhance its \ninformation  systems  under  the  financial  management  action  plan,  which  is \ncurrently ongoing and supported by consultants hired under the ongoing loan. \n\nProcurement. Strategic procurement planning was conducted in January 2020 \nand approved in September 2020 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guide on Assessing \nProcurement  Risks  and  Determining  Project  Procurement  Classification.b  The \nproject  procurement  classification  is  category  B  and  procurement  risk  is \nmoderate. \n\nAnticorruption.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was\nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  BREB.  The  specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary  measures are described  in the  project \nadministration manual.c\n\n\f6 \n\nArea of \nAssessment \n\nPoverty, social, and \ngender \n\nSafeguards \n\nSummary of Assessment \n\nIntegrity  due  diligence.  Risk  assessment  was  conducted  in  January  2020. \nBased  on  the  information  provided,  and  in  the  absence  of  any  other  ongoing \nmatter that could become  an issue, the potential integrity and reputational risk \narising from ADB\u2019s association with the BREB is low to medium.\nThe project area (Khulna division) is one of the poorest divisions in Bangladesh \n(poverty rate of 27.7%). Improved access, quality, and reliability of the electricity \nsupply in rural areas will help to (i) reduce household consumption of kerosene \nfor cooking and lighting, thereby reducing household fuel expenditure; (ii) reduce \nthe burden of household chores; (iii) catalyze energy-based economic activities, \nthereby  improving  household  incomes;  and  (iv)  improve  the  educational  and \nmedical  environment.  Farmers  can  reduce  fuel  expenditure  for  irrigation  by \nswitching  diesel-powered  pumps  to  electric  pumps,  which  will  help  to  reduce \nproduction costs. \n\nThe  gender  mainstreaming  category  of  the  ongoing  project  and  the  proposed \nadditional  financing  is classified  effective gender mainstreaming as  the project \narea under the additional financing is part of the ongoing project. Gender actions \nunder the ongoing project are on track and will be continued under the additional \nfinancing.d In addition to the ongoing actions, a gender equality strategy for the \nBREB  will  be  developed,  and  the  existing  BREB  offices  will  be  renovated  to \naccommodate the elderly, women, children, and disabled people. \nThe additional financing is classified B for environment, B for resettlement, and \nC for  indigenous peoples.  A total of 51 new substations will  need  21.86  acres \n(8.85 hectares) of land. The land will be purchased through a willing buyer, willing \nseller process. The additional financing will not have impacts on legally protected \nareas  or  internationally  or  nationally  important  biodiversity  areas  or  physical \ncultural  resources.  The  updated  resettlement  plan  and  initial  environmental \nexamination have been disclosed on the ADB website on 22 October 2020 and \n16  November  2020  respectively.  Distribution  lines  do  not  have  any  significant \nenvironmental and social impacts as these usually follow the right-of-way of the \nexisting roads. The project is not anticipated to impact  on indigenous  peoples, \nwhich has been confirmed during the project due diligence. Consultations have \nbeen  undertaken  during  project  preparation,  and  a  two-tier  grievance  redress \nmechanism has been established under the ongoing loan and is functioning well. \nThe project implementation unit will be supported by an environmental consultant \nand  a  social  consultant  for  the  additional  financing.  Environmental  monitoring \nreports will be submitted semiannually during construction and annually during \noperation. Social monitoring reports will be submitted semiannually.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BREB = Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board. \na  Government of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission. 2020.
