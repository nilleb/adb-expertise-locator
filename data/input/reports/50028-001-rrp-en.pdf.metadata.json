The attached TA will support DRM in participating DMCs, and assess the \noptions  for,  and  potential  costs  and  benefits  from,  a  collaborative  multi-country  mechanism  to \nprovide contingent financing in the event of disasters triggered by natural hazards. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\n3. \nDisaster risk in the Pacific. Pacific DMCs are highly exposed to many different types of \nnatural  hazards,  including  tropical  cyclones,  earthquakes,  storm  surges,  tsunamis,  volcanic \neruptions, floods, and droughts. The region also experiences a disproportionately high share of \nglobal  disaster  impacts  relative  to  its  economic  and  demographic  size.  Disaster  risk  is  growing \nbecause of climate change, poor development planning, unplanned urbanization, and ecosystem \ndecline. Climate change may increase the intensity of extreme weather events, including cyclones. \nRising sea levels are speeding erosion rates, and increasing the risk of storm surges for cyclone-\naffected countries, and rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification are destroying the coral \nreefs that form natural coastal barriers. \n\n4. \nWhen disasters strike, Pacific DMCs face further challenges due to their remote location \nand  geographical  makeup.  Many  countries  have  relatively  small  populations  that  are  widely \ndispersed  over  several  islands,  many  of  which  are  isolated  and  difficult  to  reach  in  times  of  a \ndisaster. These factors contribute to the relatively high cost of disaster response. Due to the small \nsize of their economies and limited access to international financial markets, most Pacific DMCs \nhave  limited  resources  and  capacity  to  invest  in  disaster  risk  reduction  (DRR),  and  to facilitate \ntimely recovery and reconstruction after a disaster. Delays in response and recovery exacerbate \nthe  indirect  economic  and  social  costs  of  disasters,  increasing  their  ultimate  impact,  and \ncompromising long-term fiscal balances. \n\n5. \nDisasters  can  erode  many  years  of  economic  development  gains  by  damaging  critical \ninfrastructure,  disrupting  social  services,  and  diverting  resources  from  development  spending \ntoward  disaster  response  and  reconstruction.  Disasters  in  the  Pacific  reduced  average  trend \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP) from 3.3% in 1980 to 2.6% in 2014.3 Considering only the \nexpected participating countries, examples of damage and loss caused by disasters in the region \n\n                                                \n1  ADB discussed this program with a further two countries beyond the three covered here. Other countries may consider \n\nparticipating in a contingent financing program in the future. \n\n2  The program is included in ADB. 2017. Regional Operations Business Plan: Pacific, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n3  E. Cabezon et al. 2015. Enhancing Macroeconomic Resilience to Natural Disasters and Climate Change in the Small \n\nStates of the Pacific. International Monetary Fund Working Paper Series. WP/15/125. Washington, DC. \n\n\f2 \n\n2). \n\n \n\ninclude Tropical Cyclone Pam in 2015, which caused damage equivalent to 33% of GDP in Tuvalu; \nTropical Cyclone Ian in 2014, which caused damage equivalent to around 11% of GDP in Tonga; \nand Tropical Cyclone Evan in 2012, which caused damage equivalent to around 29% of GDP in \nSamoa. \n\n6. \nBuilding  disaster  risk  resilience  requires  actions  on  many  fronts,  such  as  strengthening \npolicy and institutional arrangements for DRM, including the capacity for post-disaster response \nand  recovery;  improving  the  disaster  resilience  of  physical  assets;  and  expanding  disaster  risk \nfinancing. Although Pacific governments have made significant gains in these areas, more effort \nis required, and they remain constrained by capacity and competing priorities. To establish their \neligibility to access the contingent financing under the program, the governments have undertaken \nprior policy actions to support DRM. \n\n7. \nGovernments\u2019  strategies.  To  mitigate  the  economic  risk  posed  by  disasters,  all \nparticipating DMCs have taken important steps to improve disaster resilience, and climate change \nand DRM objectives are generally well-defined within government policies and plans. All countries \ndefine legal responsibilities for DRM, including procedures for declaring a state of emergency; and \nhave some financial arrangements in place for disaster response,  including annual contingency \nbudgets and, in some cases, sovereign disaster insurance.4 Pacific DMCs receive strong support \nfrom  bilateral  partners  for  immediate  humanitarian  aid  after  major  events,  and  development \npartners, including ADB, provide financing to support reconstruction, which typically starts several \nmonths after a disaster. However, in the event of a significant disaster, governments typically have \ninsufficient resources to meet immediate post-disaster financing needs, instead relying heavily on \nbudget  reallocations,  which  can  take  some  time  to  secure  and  often  redirect  funds  away  from \ndevelopment priorities.5 \n\n8. \nLayered approach to disaster risk financing. The most cost-effective way of financing \ndisaster response is through a range of tools in a common framework to address different layers \nof risk, as no single instrument is optimal for responding to all disaster events, which range from \nfrequent, small-scale events to rare catastrophic events.6 The figure shows the range of potential \nfinancing  tools,  and  the  availability  of  these  tools  in  the  Pacific,  from  budget  allocations  that \naddress  low-impact,  high-frequency  events (such as  stormwater  overflow),  to global  bonds that \naddress rare yet highly damaging events (such as high-magnitude earthquakes). \n\n9. \nThere  is  strong  demand  from  Pacific  DMCs  for  additional  instruments  to  strengthen \nfinancial preparedness for disasters, and a clear need for this, given the rising incidence of disaster \nevents.  Ideally,  a  comprehensive  disaster  risk  financing  strategy  would  combine  both  ex  ante \n(arranged  ahead  of  a  disaster  occurring,  such  as  disaster  reserves,  contingency  budgets, \ncontingent  credit,  and  insurance)  and  ex  post  mechanisms  (post-disaster  budget  reallocations, \nborrowing,  and  international  assistance).  The  precise  mix  would  depend  on  the  relative  cost-\neffectiveness of alternative instruments for specific layers of risk in individual country contexts. \n\n10. \nContingent financing is particularly cost-effective in addressing risks pertaining to events \nthat would exhaust annual contingency budgets and any dedicated national reserves, but are too \nfrequent to be covered cost effectively through insurance. Governments typically have contingency \n\n                                                \n4  Disaster  Risk Financing  Arrangements  (accessible from  the  list  of linked documents  in  Appendix  2)  describes  the \n\nfinancial arrangements in place in each participating country to respond to disasters. \n\n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n6  D.

The  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Assessment  and  Financing  Initiative \n(PCRAFI) 7  offers  insurance  cover  starting  from  10-year  return  period  attachments  per  peril, \ncovering the high-layer risks, together with any potential international assistance that the countries \nmight receive. As such, there is a gap for medium-layer risks in most Pacific countries, with the \nexception  of  the  Cook  Islands,  which  has  a  contingent  credit  facility  with  ADB.8 The  program \nintends to cover the medium-layer risks gap, as represented in the figure. \n\nDisaster Risk Financing Layers and Existing Tools in the Pacific \n \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, INGO = international nongovernment organization. \nSource:  ADB \n \n11. \nADB engagement and lessons learned. ADB attaches significant importance to DRM in \nthe  Pacific,  and  has  provided  considerable  loans,  grants,  and  TA  for  post-disaster  disaster \nresponse, early recovery, and reconstruction. This support has progressively broadened from post-\ndisaster  assistance  to  proactive  DRR  through  a range  of  financing  mechanisms.  ADB  provides \ndedicated funding to its concessional assistance-only countries through the Asian Development \nFund (ADF) 12 DRR financing mechanism to spur investment in DRR. ADB often plays a key role \nin post-disaster needs assessments. For the post-disaster humanitarian response phase, ADB\u2019s \nAsia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Fund  (APDRF),  a  dedicated  quick-disbursing  instrument,  can \nprovide grants up to $3.0 million per event within a week of a disaster.9 Additional concessional \nfunds can  be  accessed through  the  ADF  Disaster  Response  Facility for  the  early  recovery  and \nreconstruction phase, although processing associated projects takes time. \n\n12. \n\nSince  1987,  ADB  has  offered  an  emergency  assistance  loan  instrument  with  extended \n\n                                                \n7  World Bank. 2017. PCRAFI: Furthering Disaster Risk Financing in the Pacific Project. Washington, DC. \n8  ADB. 2016. Cook Islands: Disaster Resilience Program. Manila. \n9  Between the establishment of the APDRF in 2009 and September 2017, the Pacific has received 11 APDRF grants \n\ntotaling $7.4 million. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ngrace  and  repayment  periods,  increased  retroactive  financing,  lower  interest  rates,  and \nabbreviated processing requirements, facilitating the approval of fast-tracked assistance for early \nrecovery  purposes.  However,  emergency  assistance  loans  can  still  take  3  months  or  more  to \nprocess,  and  reconstruction  loans  processed  under  normal  lending  modalities  can  take \nsignificantly longer. \n\n13. \nADB has piloted contingent financing in the Cook Islands (footnote 8) as a mechanism to \nprovide  more  timely  disaster-response  support,  financed  through  a  stand-alone,  single-tranche \npolicy-based loan from regular ordinary capital resources. To access the contingent financing, the \nGovernment of the Cook Islands has undertaken prior actions to strengthen policy and institutional \narrangements for DRM, and the disbursement will be triggered when a state of disaster is declared. \nThe program reflects the unique features of this support. \n\n14. \nThe proposed approach. The program provides Pacific DMCs with a source of financing \nfor response, early recovery, and reconstruction activities for disaster events caused by all types \nof natural hazards. To support the development of effective and comprehensive DRM strategies \nand programs at the country level, the policy-based loan and policy-based grant modality will be \nused to agree on disaster resilience-related policy actions for each participating DMC. These policy \nactions will strengthen the resilience of institutions and communities in the participating DMCs. The \nproposed provision of financing contingent on a disaster is similar to the contingent credit facility \nprovided  to  the  Cook  Islands  (footnote  8).  The  attached  TA  will  support  and  monitor  progress \ntoward  achieving  the  governments\u2019  long-term  DRM  goals  included  in  a  program  monitoring \nframework,  and  explore  options  for  regional  collaboration  around  contingent  financing  and  a \npotential permanent regional contingent savings mechanism. \n\n15. \nThe  proposed  participating  DMCs\u2014Samoa,  Tonga,  and  Tuvalu\u2014face  similar  DRM \nchallenges,  and  will  benefit  greatly  from  a  regional  approach  under  which  good  practices  are \nshared. The program will support coordination and cooperation both between Pacific DMCs and \nwith development partners on financing arrangements, policy reform discussions, and regional TA \nprograms.  The  TA  activities  will  include  regional  sharing  of  experiences  and  lessons  on  DRM, \nparticularly on post-disaster financial management. \n\nThe  program  will  complement  existing  disaster  risk  financing  instruments  available  to \n16. \nPacific DMCs (figure), including annual contingency budgets, national disaster funds, parametric \ndisaster insurance, and traditional indemnity insurance. Its unique features are as follows: (i) it can \nmake  a  payment  quickly  and  use  the  funds  flexibly  with  no  additional  requirements,  beyond \nnational public financial management requirements, to track and report on expenditures; (ii) the \namount that can be released is significant in terms of immediate response needs; (iii) the amount \nis not dependent on any assessment of loss or measure of the intensity of the natural hazard; and \n(iv) funds are available for disaster events triggered by any type of natural hazard. The program is \naligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u2013203010 and the Framework \nfor Resilient Development in the Pacific.11 \n\n17. \nEconomic impact of the disaster resilience program. The most fundamental benefit of \nthe  program  to  Pacific  DMCs  is  strengthened  financial  preparedness  for  disaster  events.  The \nprogram will provide a timely and predictable source of post-disaster financing, facilitating rapid \ndecision making and the implementation of priority actions. This will reduce the indirect economic \nand social consequences of direct physical losses. \n                                                \n10 United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. 2015.

However, the \nfollowing are indicative of the expected economic benefits: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nfewer  lives lost  and  injuries incurred  during  a  disaster, reflecting  improved  DRM, \nresponse preparation, and public training; \nreduced damage and losses to public and personal property due to (a) improved \nDRM, response preparation, and public training; (b) strengthened building codes; \nand (c) more resilient critical public infrastructure and assets; \nreduced  costs  due  to  shorter  business  and  public  facility  closures,  and  faster \nrestoration of livelihoods and essential infrastructure and services; \nimproved public safety and reduced risk of post-disaster health impacts due to a \nmore effectively coordinated and better targeted response; and \nreduced  opportunity  cost  associated  with  government  budget  or  aid  program \nreallocations, and/or any financial costs associated with additional commercial or \nconcessional borrowing that may be urgently needed to meet post-disaster costs. \n\n \n19. \nPartner support. In the aftermath of disasters in the Pacific, major development partners, \nincluding  the  governments  of  Australia,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  France,  Japan,  New \nZealand, and the United States usually move quickly to mobilize immediate relief, including in-kind \nsupport  and financing through humanitarian  nongovernment  organizations. The  United  Nations\u2019 \nPacific Humanitarian Team mobilizes relief items and technical support from several offices in the \nregion.  Major  development  partners  and regional  organizations  are  also  actively  supporting the \nimplementation of the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific (footnote 11). \n\n20. \nThe PCRAFI was originally established in 2007 as a joint initiative of the Pacific Community, \nthe World  Bank,  and  ADB.  The  World  Bank  launched  a  disaster  insurance  pilot  as  part  of  this \ninitiative in 2012. Phase II of the PCRAFI program began in 2016, supported by the PCRAFI Multi-\nDonor Trust Fund with the World Bank as trustee. Phase II includes two core components: (i) the \nestablishment of a PCRAFI Facility12 as an insurance captive to provide Pacific island countries \nwith catastrophe risk insurance coverage on competitive terms, and (ii) a TA program to support \ncapacity  building  on  disaster  risk  financing  and  the  public  financial  management  of  disasters. \nGermany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States have provided grant funding toward \nthe establishment of the PCRAFI Facility, which issued its first insurance policies for the 2016\u2013\n2017  season  (the  PCRAFI\u2019s  fifth  season)  for  the  Cook  Islands,  the  Marshall  Islands,  Samoa, \nTonga, and Vanuatu. The World Bank\u2019s Pacific Resilience Program is carrying out complementary \nDRM  work,  and  has  secured  some  premium  financing  for  PCRAFI  insurance.13 The  parametric \nnature of the insurance product and the small size of the payouts relative to total potential disaster \nlosses  highlight  the  need  for  Pacific  DMCs  to  use  a  mix  of  several  financial  instruments  to  be \nadequately prepared for disaster events of varying severity.14 \n\n21. \nADB priorities and contributions. ADB priorities in Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu are guided \nby  the  Pacific  Approach,  which  serves  as  the  country  strategy  for  the  11  smaller  DMCs  in  the \nPacific.15\n The Pacific Approach focuses on three strategic areas, one of which is managing risks. \n\n                                                \n12 The PCRAFI Facility was established in the Cook Islands in 2016 as a foundation with a board of directors that owns \n\na group captive insurer. \n\n13 World Bank. 2015. Pacific Resilience Program. Washington, DC. \n14 The proposed contingent financing will complement the PCRAFI insurance cover as it addresses more frequent, lower \nintensity  events,  as  well  as  providing  finance  in  response  to  disasters  triggered  by  any  type  of  natural  hazards, \nincluding flooding, drought, and volcanic eruptions, which are not currently covered under the PCRAFI insurance. \n\n15 ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nThe Pacific Approach also highlights the need to (i) expand ADB\u2019s  work in climate change and \nDRM; (ii) introduce innovative solutions to strengthen disaster preparedness, address vulnerability, \nand  build  resilience;  and  (iii)  pursue  a  more  programmatic  and  regional  approach  to  financing \nclimate change and DRM initiatives in the Pacific region. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n22. \nThe program is aligned with the following impact: strengthened resilience to climate change \nand disasters, as well as disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.16 The program will have \nthe following outcome: strengthened DRM in participating countries.17 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n23. \nOutput  1:  Strengthened  regional  collaboration  on  disaster  risk  financing.  The \nprogram will support collaboration among the Pacific DMCs to strengthen disaster risk financing. \nSeveral countries have undertaken policy actions to strengthen disaster risk financing, including \nTuvalu setting up the Climate Change and Disaster Survival Fund and Tonga making a financial \ncommitment to their Emergency Fund in the current national budget. The participating DMCs have \nentered into a memorandum of understanding that will be the basis for collaboration among the \nparticipating countries  in exploring,  developing,  and  establishing  the most  suitable  collaborative \nregional  mechanism  for  contingent  financing. 18 The  attached  TA  will  support  the  participating \nDMCs  to  reach  an  agreement  on  the  most  suitable  option.  The  participating  DMCs  are  then \nexpected to enter into an agreement to establish the agreed mechanism. The program will provide \nparticipating  DMCs  with  quick-releasing  finance  to  support  response,  early  recovery,  and \nreconstruction activities after disaster events triggered by natural hazards. \n \n24.  While the funds disbursed through the program can partially meet immediate post-disaster \nfinancing needs, pooling such resources through a regional contingent savings mechanism can \nbring certain advantages. Doing so would (i) allow for an increased return on funds, because part \ncan  be  set  aside  in  a  nonliquid  form  as  all  participating  countries  are  unlikely  to  experience \ndisasters and require drawdown of all funds simultaneously; (ii) provide seed financing to attract \nother development partners to provide further financing for post-disaster response, (iii) provide a \nmechanism  into  which  participating  countries  can  transfer  further  savings  without  incurring  the \nadditional administrative burden of managing these funds themselves; and (iv) demonstrate the \neffectiveness of the contingent financing mechanism, so attracting the participation of a greater \nnumber of Pacific countries. \n\n25. \nThe  attached  TA  will  provide  options  for  a  sustainable  regional  mechanism  to  channel \ndisaster contingent financing, allowing funds to be replenished, additional countries to join, and \nother donors to contribute to the contingent funds. The mechanism would need to provide fast and \nefficient  payments  to  DMCs  following  an  eligible  disaster,  and  follow  best  practices  of  good \ngovernance and financial management. Within the Pacific region, there are various existing models \nof trust funds, in addition to the PCRAFI Facility,19 while ADB brings experience in the creation of \n                                                \n16 Goal  1:  Strengthened  Integrated  Adaptation  and  Risk  Reduction  to  Enhance  Resilience  to  Climate  Change  and \nDisasters, and Goal 3: Strengthened Disaster Preparedness, Response and Recovery) of the Framework for Resilient \nDevelopment in the Pacific. Under Goal 1, priority actions by regional organizations and other development partners \ninclude  the  following:  \u201c(i)  Establish  a  regional  facility  to  assist  governments  in  disaster  and  climate  change  risk \nfinancing, including insurance.\u201d \n\n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 Memorandum of Understanding: Pacific Regional Collaboration for Disaster Risk Contingent Financing (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n19 An independent legal entity domiciled in the Cook Islands. \n\n\fmultidonor trust funds. These and other models will be assessed with support from the attached \nTA to identify a preferred approach for regional consideration. \n\n26. \nOutput  2:  Strengthened  enabling  framework  for  disaster  risk  management.  Each \nparticipating country must satisfy its country-specific policy actions to access contingent financing \nthrough the proposed policy-based loans and grants. These policy actions (included in the policy \nmatrix) have strengthened policy, governance, and institutional arrangements for DRM. In Samoa, \nthe  Disaster  Advisory  Committee  has  endorsed the  National  Disaster  Management  Plan  2017\u2013\n2020, while Tonga has completed a comprehensive consultation process under its second Joint \nNational Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management, and enacted \nthe National Spatial Planning and Management Act. Policy actions have also supported improved \nDRM investment planning processes and tools. For example, (i) in Samoa, the Cabinet approved \nrecommendations  from  the  roads  vulnerability  assessment  and  climate-resilient  roads  strategy, \nthe  first  10  community-integrated  management  plans  were  submitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources and Environment, and climate-resilient building codes were updated and adopted; (ii) \nTonga completed two district emergency management plans and trained government officers in \npost-disaster needs assessment; and (iii) in Tuvalu, the cabinet approved Tuvalu Climate Change \nand Disaster Survival Fund Regulations, and the National Disaster Committee approved national \nstandard operating procedures for cyclone response. \n\nAll 5 policy actions for Samoa, 6 policy actions for Tonga, and 4 policy actions for Tuvalu, \n27. \npresented in the countries\u2019 respective policy matrixes, have been completed.20 Each government \nhas also agreed upon an ongoing monitoring framework to strengthen DRM performance further. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nD. \n \n28. \nThe single-tranche program is estimated to cost $15 million (Table 1), and will be supported \nby  the  attached  TA.21 Post-disaster  financing  needs  have  been  determined  based  on  the  likely \nfiscal impact of medium- to low-risk disasters, taking into account the resources likely available \nfrom  domestic  and  international  sources,  the  need  to  ensure  that  the  countries  maintain \nsustainable levels of debt, and the availability of concessional resources.  As the proposed loan \nand grant funds are for contingent financing to support additional public spending associated with \nshort-term post-disaster financing needs, the loan and grant amounts are not directly correlated to \nthe cost of policy reforms. The financing per country ranges from 0.7%\u20138.0% of annual GDP, less \nthan the cost of a typical medium-risk disaster in the Pacific.  \n\nThe governments have requested loans of $3.1 million (Samoa) and $3.1 million (Tonga) \n29. \nfrom ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loans will \nhave a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \nloan  agreements.  The  governments  have  also  requested  grants  not  exceeding  $2.9  million \n(Samoa),  $2.9  million  (Tonga),  and  $3.0  million  (Tuvalu)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \n(ADF)  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  indicative  financing  comprises  resources  from  the \nconcessional  resources  regional  pool,  as  well  as  countries\u2019  concessional  lending  and  grant \nallocations. The financing plan is in Table 1. \n\n \n \n                                                \n20 The policy actions and areas of program monitoring are described in Appendixes 4, 6, and 8. \n21 A  conservative  estimate  of  $1.7  million  (10%  of  total  program  amount,  including  the  attached  TA)  was  used  for \n\nreporting climate change adaptation finance.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nTonga \n\nTuvalu \n\nTotal \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nCOL PBA (loan) \nCOL regional pool (loan) \nADF PBA (grant) \nADF regional pool (grant) \n\nTotal \n\nSamoa \n \n\n \n\n1.1 \n2.0 \n0.9 \n2.0 \n6.0 \n\n \n\n1.1 \n2.0 \n0.9 \n2.0 \n6.0 \n\nShare of Totala \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n1.0 \n2.0 \n3.0 \n\n2.2 \n4.0 \n2.8 \n6.0 \n15.0 \n\n14.7 \n26.7 \n18.7 \n40.0 \n100.0 \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, COL = concessional ordinary capital resources loan, PBA = performance-based \nallocation. \na Numbers may not sum precisely due to rounding.  \nSource: ADB. \n\nE. \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe executing agencies will be the ministry of finance equivalents in each country,22 and \n30. \nthe  implementing  agencies  will  include  ministries  and  offices  responsible  for  finance,  planning, \ninfrastructure, and disaster response. The policy actions were implemented from 1 January to 6 \nNovember 2017,23 while the activities of the attached TA and the program will be completed on 31 \nDecember 2022.  Each participating  DMC  has  country-specific  policy  actions  and separate  loan \nand/or  grant  agreements.  The  implementing  agencies  will  implement  an  agreed  program \nmonitoring framework with the support of country-level DRM or climate change committees24 and \nattached TA resources. \n\n31. \nDisbursement of the policy-based loans and grants. A country\u2019s eligibility to withdraw \nloan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  based  on  its  achievement  of  prior  actions  in  the  policy  matrix. \nHowever, actual withdrawals will be deferred and only triggered after the government declares a \nstate of disaster or emergency after a natural hazard event. In the event of a declared disaster, the \ngovernment  can  withdraw  the  loan  and  grant  proceeds  partially  or  entirely,  depending  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s assessment of the disaster\u2019s severity and resultant need, and the government and \nADB have agreed on the withdrawal amount. Any remaining funds at the end of the program period \n(para.  30)  will  be  disbursed  to  the  respective  participating  countries  for  strengthening  disaster \nresilience. Funds are spent through national budget processes. Loan and grant proceeds will be \nwithdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \nDuring TA implementation, ADB through the attached TA, will periodically monitor the continuing \nimplementation of the agreed policy actions according to the program monitoring framework. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n32. \nADB, in consultation with the governments and other stakeholders, will support actions to \nstrengthen DRM, including activities to improve disaster preparedness and reduce disaster risk, \nthrough the attached TA.25 ADB will be the executing agency and will exercise overall responsibility \nfor all TA activities. The TA will support (i) the exploration of options for a regional, collaborative, \ncontingent  financing  mechanism  for  disasters;  and  (ii)  priority  DRM  activities  in  participating \n\n                                                \n22 The Ministry of Finance of Samoa, Ministry of Finance and National Planning of Tonga, and Ministry of Finance and \n\nEconomic Development of Tuvalu. \n\n23 Policy actions were identified and their implementation encouraged through policy dialogue, which has been ongoing \n\nsince 2016 with some support from various ongoing TA. \n\n24 National  DRM  committees  and  councils  typically  only  meet  in  the  event  of  major  impending  disasters  and  their \naftermath, but DRR is being increasingly covered by national climate change working groups or committees, which \ntypically meet more frequently. \n\n25 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fcountries and at a regional level, including expanding engagement in the program output areas, \nbuilding  on  the  policy  actions  achieved  to  access  policy-based  financing,  and  supporting  the \nimplementation of a program monitoring framework to further strengthen DRM systems. This will \ninclude  advisory  and  capacity  development  support  for  DRM  planning  and  governance,  the \nmainstreaming of DRM into sector policies, support for post-disaster public financial management, \nsupport  for  the  enhancement  of  disaster  risk  financing  strategies,  and  disaster  preparedness \nmeasures. \n \n33. \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6 and TASF-other sources). \n\nThe TA is estimated to cost $2.0 million, and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n34. \nThe envisaged impacts of the policy actions include (i) strengthened policy, governance, \nand institutional arrangements for DRM; (ii) improved DRM investment planning processes and \ntools that will strengthen the resilience of public and private physical assets; and (iii) expanded \ndisaster  risk  financing  to  meet  countries\u2019  needs  during  the  immediate  aftermath  of  and  early \nrecovery  period  following  a  disaster.  The  policy  actions  will  improve  the  participating  countries\u2019 \nability  to  withstand  and  cope  with  the  short-  and  longer  term  impacts  of  disasters  and  climate \nchange. \n\nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n35. \nAll  participating  countries  have  some  financial  management  arrangements  in  place  for \ndisaster  events.  However,  coordinating  disaster  responses,  including  the  support  offered  by \ndonors  and  civil  society  organizations  with  competing  requirements  and  procedures,  can  pose \nsignificant administrative challenges, and government absorption capacities are often stretched in \nthe  aftermath  of  disaster  events.  The  policy  actions  and  technical  support  have  been  identified \nbased on a DRM gap and needs analysis in each country. The attached TA will prioritize capacity \ndevelopment focusing on financing and budgetary issues, including post-disaster budget allocation \nand execution, to ensure that all countries participating in the program have adequate systems in \nplace to use program resources in an effective, accountable, and transparent manner. \n\n36. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  governments  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  of  Samoa,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National \nPlanning of Tonga, and Ministry of Finance and Economic Development of Tuvalu. \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n37. \nThe policy actions will allow the participating governments to maintain greater fiscal stability \nin the event of a disaster and to initiate relief and recovery efforts with minimum delay, mitigating \nthe immediate economic and social impacts of a disaster. Implementation of the policy actions is \nexpected  to  continue  to  strengthen  existing  social  protection  arrangements,  ensuring  that \ncommunities  and  vulnerable  households  (including  households  headed  by  women)  are  able  to \nreach safety in the event of a disaster, access sufficient relief supplies to meet immediate needs, \nand receive support to rebuild their lives and assets. \n\n38. \nThe  program  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  includes  key  policy \nactions that will equally benefit both women and men. This further ensures positive poverty and \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nsocial impacts through stronger and gender-inclusive DRM. The TA will also ensure that any tools \nand plans are gender-sensitive, and that women are included in building knowledge in key areas \nof  DRM  accountabilities,  including  post-disaster  public  financial  management,  and  disaster \npreparedness  measures.  Sex-disaggregated  data  is  included  in  planning  tools  and  knowledge \nproducts, and women are involved in consultations and meetings related to the DRM activities. \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified category \n39. \nC for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will \nbe confined to policy and institutional reforms and TA, and none of the activities will result in or \nlead to any physical works that could create environmental or social impacts, physical or economic \ndisplacement,  of  involuntary  resettlement.  The  activities  will  not  negatively  affect  indigenous \npeoples. Stakeholder dialogue was carried out during the program design and will continue during \nprogram implementation. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40. \nRisks to program implementation are related to possible external shocks on the economies \nand  capacity  constraints  of  the  government  agencies,  including  constraints  in  public  financial \nmanagement  systems.  These  risks  will  be  managed  partially  through  TA  support  for  capacity \ndevelopment of government counterparts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 2 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInsufficient action on the recommendations \nto improve financial management \nprocedures for disaster response \nExternal shocks (e.g., disasters and \neconomic downturns) damage the \neconomies. \nGovernment agencies lack the capacity to \nimplement the DRM actions. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe governments have already actively strengthened PFM \nmore broadly, and the TA will provide support to address \nweaknesses identified in PFM during disasters. \nDevelopment partners help the governments build buffers to \nimprove resilience to economic shocks. \n\nThe attached TA will develop the capacity of government \ncounterparts. Regional monitoring and support from other \npartners also builds capacity and motivation. \nPeriodic monitoring to assess and report on the progress of \nDRM actions is conducted, and TA will support the actions. \n\nStaff constraints or shifting priorities delay \nthe implementation of DRM actions. \nDRM = disaster risk management, PFM = public financial management, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n41. \nThe governments and the executing agencies have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described \nin  detail  in  the  loan  and  grant  documents.  The  governments  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants for the program, which are set forth in the loan and grant agreements. No disbursement \nshall be made unless an occurrence of a qualifying disaster or end of the program as confirmed \nby ADB. \n\n \n                                                \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n42. \nI am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loans and policy-based grants would comply \nwith the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the \nBoard approve \n(i) \n\nthe loan of $3,100,000 to the Independent State of Samoa for the Pacific Disaster \nResilience Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% \nper year thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; \nthe loan of $3,100,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Pacific Disaster Resilience \nProgram,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  concessional  terms,  with  an \ninterest  charge at  the  rate of  1%  per  year  during  the grace period  and  1.5%  per \nyear thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; \nthe grant not exceeding $2,900,000 to the Independent State of Samoa, from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund),  for  the  Pacific  Disaster \nResilience Program, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board; \nthe grant not exceeding $2,900,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga, from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund),  for  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience \nProgram, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe grant not exceeding $3,000,000 to Tuvalu, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian Development Fund), for the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program, on terms \nand conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \ngrant agreement presented to the Board. \n\n23 November 2017 \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Program is Aligned with \n\nResilience to climate change and disasters, as well as disaster preparedness, response, and recovery \nstrengthened (Goals 1 and 3, Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific)a \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\nRisks \n\nMinistries of finance, \nprogram reports \n\nExternal shocks (e.g., \ndisasters or economic \ndownturns) damage \nthe economy. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1a.
