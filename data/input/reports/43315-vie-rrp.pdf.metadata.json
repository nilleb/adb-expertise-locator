The VIE-CS is to be provided as a single tranche under the \nCountercyclical Support Facility (CSF) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). \n \nTargeting Classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management) \nTheme (subtheme): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability) \nLocation impact: National (high) \n \nCategory C \n\n \nThe  global  economic  downturn,  triggered  by  the  collapse  of  the  US \nsubprime mortgage market, has turned into one of the sharpest global \neconomic recessions in modern history. Most developed economies are \nin  deep  recession  in  2009,  and  the  pace  of  economic  growth  in \ndeveloping countries has declined significantly, and has in some cases \nbecome  negative.  The  latest  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nprojections  suggest  that  economic  growth  in  developed  countries  this \nyear will contract by 3.8%. The volume of world trade is expected to fall \nby  12.2%  and  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  is  estimated  to  fall  by \nabout  30%  from  2008  levels.  Viet  Nam  has  been  severely  affected  by \nthe  global  economic  downturn  because  of  the  country\u2019s  increasing \ndependence  on  FDI  inflows  and  exports  to  support  its  high  economic \ngrowth  rate,  since  its  successful  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  in  January  2007.  FDI  disbursement  declined  by \nabout 18.4% and exports dropped by 10.2% in the first half of 2009. FDI \napproval  fell  by  75%  during  the  same  period.  Remittance  inflows  and \ntourist arrivals also dropped significantly. The global financial crisis has \naffected  the  Government\u2019s  market  access  for  budget  financing.  As  a \nresult,  the  Government  has  issued  only  a  limited  amount  of  domestic \nbonds  since  early  2009,  as  bond  yields  in  the  market  remain \nsignificantly higher than the ceilings set by the Government.  \n \nThe  Government  is  concerned  about  the  potential  adverse  poverty \nimpacts  of  significantly  slower  economic  growth.  Because  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  young  demographic  profile,  about  1.7  million  young  workers \nenter the country\u2019s labor force annually. During 2006\u20132007, with annual \naverage  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  7.6%,  only  about \n800,000 jobs were created annually. With growth projected to decline to \n5%  or  less,  unemployment  and  underemployment  could  increase \nsignificantly.  At  the  same  time,  the  social  security  system  is  still  in  a \nvery  early  stage  of  its  development.  The  Government\u2019s  cash  transfer \nprogram  has  limited  coverage,  and  is  fraught  with  implementation \n\n \nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nThe Program \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \nii \n \n\n \n\nObjective, Scope, \nand Coverage of \nLoan \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n \n\nproblems.  Therefore,  preventing  a  collapse  of  economic  activities  and \nsustaining employment are high priorities. \n \nThe  Government  has  announced  a  significant  fiscal  stimulus  package \nto  counter  the  potential  adverse  impacts  of  the  global  economic \ndownturn. The fiscal stimulus package is intended to bolster the primary \nstrengths of the economy, maintain GDP growth above 5%, and ensure \nsocial  stability.  It  broadly  consists  of  four  pillars:  (i) enhancing  state \ninvestment  funded  from  the  budget  and  additional  bond  issues; \n(ii) exemptions,  reductions,  and  deferments  in  taxes,  intended  to \nsupport  business  and  bolster  domestic  consumption;  (iii) interest \nsubsidies  and  credit  guarantees  intended  to  keep  credit  flowing;  and \n(iv) additional budget expenditure for social welfare. \n \nIt is in the context of the second-round effects on the real economy and \nthe emerging fiscal constraint that the Government has requested ADB \nto  provide  a  CSF  of  $500 million  to  support  its  public  expenditure \nprogram  for  2009.  The  request  for  financing  stemmed  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s  concerns  about  ensuring  predictability  in  its  budget \nfinancing  since  (i)  market  financing  access  on  reasonable  terms  is \nexpected to be limited, and (ii) a larger fiscal stimulus is now needed.  \n\nThe  objective  of  the  VIE-CS  loan  is  to  provide  support  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s countercyclical spending program for 2009 and therefore \nensure predictability in its budget financing given limited market access \nand  the  need  for  a  temporary  fiscal  expansion.  This  will  allow  the \nGovernment to promote economic recovery, protect its social spending \nand  poverty  alleviation  programs  and  objectives,  and  continue  with  its \nlonger term development objectives in 2009.   \n\nThe Government has requested a loan of $500,000,000 under the CSF \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility  plus  200  basis  points;  a  5-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement. \n \nThe period specified for the VIE-CS will be from 1 September 2009 to \n31 December  2010,  with  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $500  million  to  be \ndisbursed  when  the  Government  has  met  the  conditions  for  loan \neffectiveness. \n \nThe  Government  will  use \nfunds \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  help  maintain  current  social \nexpenditure and infrastructure spending. \n \nState Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) \n \n\nlocal  currency  counterpart \n\nthe \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\niii \n\nimplementation  of \n\nSBV will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall execution and \ncoordination  of  the  Government's  countercyclical  program  and  for \nreporting to ADB.  The Government will establish a committee, chaired \nby MPI, comprising officials from SBV, MOF, and other line ministries. \nThe  committee  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  overseeing  the \nimplementation  of \nthe  Government's  countercyclical  programs \nsupported  under  the  CSF  loan.  The  committee  will  meet  quarterly  to \nreport  on  progress  of \nthe  Government's \ncountercyclical programs supported under the loan. The committee will \nalso  report  on  overall  progress  of  the  Government's  countercyclical \npublic spending program. ADB may be invited to participate in some of \nthe  meetings  as  an  observer.    At  the  implementation  level,  SBV  and \nMOF  will  be  responsible  for  administering  the  disbursement  of  loan \nproceeds  from  ADB  and  maintaining  accounts.  MPI  will  select  and \nsubmit the proposals for activities to be supported under the CSF loan. \nThe line ministries will assist SBV in monitoring activities carried out by \ntheir ministries. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n \nThe  VIE-CS  will  provide  significant  benefits  and  have  a  positive  impact \non the economy and poor because of the following:  \n \n\n(i)  Higher  infrastructure  spending  will  generate  long-term  growth, \n\n(ii) \n\nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \nImproved  social  sector  outcomes  will  result  from  increased \ntargeted  social  assistance  programs; \nspending;  better \nimplementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  social  welfare  efforts,  in \nparticular  on  61  districts  identified  as  being  the  poorest  in \nViet Nam  and  assistance  provided \nto  affected  eligible \nenterprises to reduce the unemployment impact of the crisis. \n(iii)  The  VIE-CS  will  help  close  the  budget  financing  gap  within  a \nthereby  supporting  economic \n\nmedium-term \ngrowth and macroeconomic stability. \n\nfiscal  program, \n\nthe \n\n \nThe  VIE-CS  supplements  financing  from  other  ADB  programs  such  as \nthe  proposed  second  subprogram  of \nthe \nImplementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP V), scheduled \nfor  consideration  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  in  October  2009.  The \nSIPRP  supports  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reform  efforts,  which  are \nneeded  for  the  successful  implementation  of  its  Five-Year  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP), 2006\u20132010, including in the areas \ntax \nof  public \nadministration  reform,  investment  competitiveness,  natural  resource \nmanagement, and social protection. \n\nfinancial  management  and  pubic  administration, \n\nfifth  Support \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\f \n\nHowever, the VIE-CS has risks:  \n \n\n(i)  The  global  financial  crisis  has  adversely  affected  Viet  Nam\u2019s \neconomy.  A  prolonged  global  recession  will  reduce  economic \ngrowth  further  and  will  feed  into  higher  poverty  in  2009  and \n2010.  However,  these  effects  on  poverty  will  be  partially  offset \nthrough  the  Government\u2019s  large  fiscal  stimulus  to  support \ninfrastructure  development  and  other  social  assistance \nprograms. \n\n(ii)  The  absorptive  capacity  of  concerned  implementing  ministries \nand agencies will be stretched and may affect the timeliness and \neffectiveness  of  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  spending \nprogram.  The  Government  has \nintroduced  several  policy \nmeasures to expedite disbursements and this will mitigate some \nof these potential constraints. \n\n(iii)  Program  leakages  and  corruption.  Some  social  assistance \nprograms,  interest  subsidy,  and  infrastructure  are  vulnerable  to \nleakages,  mis-targeting,  and  corruption.  The  Government  is \ncommitted  to  addressing  these  problems  though  a  number  of \nsupervision,  enhanced \nimproved \ninstruments, \nmonitoring,  and  continued \nfinancial \nmanagement  and  procurement\u2014supported  by  the  World  Bank \nand other development partners. \n\nin  public \n\nincluding \n\nreforms \n\n \niv \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Countercyclical  Support  (VIE-CS).  The  development \npolicy  letter  confirming  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  program  and  its  medium-term \ndevelopment  program  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  status  of  the  Government\u2019s  compliance  with  the \naccess criteria is in Appendix 2.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nREQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM                                                                \n\nTHE COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  loan  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) comes at a critical time for Viet Nam. It is designed to maintain the \nmomentum  of  the  country\u2019s  key  development  efforts  at  a  challenging  time  of  global  financial \nmarket  failure  and  the  first  global  recession  since  World  War II.  The  global  crisis,  which \nintensified  after  September  2008,  has  affected  the  Viet  Nam  economy  and  social  sectors  in \nseveral respects: (i) the surge in commodity prices early in 2008 and the subsequent first-round \neffects  of  the  global  financial  crisis  impacted  on  its  domestic  financial  sector  and  increased \ndownside  risks  to  its  external  balance  in  2008;  (ii) the  second-round  effects  of  reduced  global \ndemand  have  hurt  the  real  economy  by  stalling  its  two  engines  of  growth\u2014external  trade  and \nforeign  direct  investment  (FDI)\u2014with  economic  growth  in  2009  slowing  to  rates  last  seen  in \n1999;  (iii) the  impact  on  fiscal  policy  has  resulted  in  a  decline  in  tax  revenue  and  a  larger \ngovernment  budget  deficit  than  initially  projected,  at  a  time  of  limited  access  to  international \ncredit markets; and (iv) the economic and fiscal policy impacts threaten to undo recent gains in \npoverty reduction. \n\n3. \nGiven the second-round effects on the real economy and the emerging fiscal constraint, \nthe Government of Viet Nam asked ADB to provide a countercyclical support loan (VIE-CS) of \n$500  million  to  support  its  2009  and  2010  public  expenditure  programs.  The  Government  is \nconcerned about maintaining economic growth above 5% and protecting jobs and stability. It is \nalso  concerned  about  ensuring  predictability  in  its  budget  financing,  given  the  necessity  for \ntemporary  fiscal  stimulus.  The  Government  projects  gross  financing  requirements  for  2009  at \nD203.5 trillion, including domestic and external debt that matures in 2009. Therefore, the loan \nwill provide additional financing to the Government for the larger fiscal stimulus now needed.  \n\n4. \nAdverse  effects  of  the  global  financial  crisis.  The  economy  has  been  adversely \nimpacted  by  the  global  economic  crisis.  This  impact  is  manifested  in  several  ways.  Economic \ngrowth is projected at 3%\u20135% in 2009, down from an average of 7.6% for the last 4 years. The \nslump  in  FDI,  exports,  and  remittances  are  the  key  factors  behind  this  sharper  than  expected \neconomic slowdown. Viet Nam is also experiencing temporary fiscal constraint because of the \nslowdown.  The  2009  budget  plan  projects  government  revenue  to  decline  by  about  3.0%  of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  below  2008  levels,  primarily  because  of  the  slump  in  resource \ntax revenues. Actual revenue collection in the first half of 2009 was about 5.1% below the target \nspecified  in  the  2009  budget  plan.  The  2009  overall  government  budget  deficit  could  rise  to \n10.3% of GDP, including the stimulus spending package, up from 4.1% of GDP in 2008, which \nis  relatively  high  by  international  standards.  However,  ADB  staff  estimate  that  the  cyclically \nadjusted (or underlying) budget deficit is about 4.5% of GDP. \n  \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Enhancing ADB\u2019s Response to the Global Economic Crisis\u2014Establishing the Countercyclical Support \n\nFacility. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nImproved macroeconomic management. The Government has made strong efforts to \n5. \nmaintain macroeconomic management of the increased downside risks to the economy arising \nfrom (i) its own economic overheating in 2007 and the surge in global commodity prices in early \n2008, and (ii) the global financial crisis that intensified in September 2008. The maintenance of \nmacroeconomic stability is reflected in inflation declining from its peak of 28% in August 2008 to \n2.0%  in  August  2009  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  Overall,  the  banking  sector  is  sufficiently \ncapitalized. While banks\u2019 nonperforming loans (NPLs)2 have risen slightly, they remained low at \n2.2% for the whole banking system in June 2009. The Government has operated overall budget \ndeficits  (combined  on-  and  off-budget  balances)  averaging  4%  of  GDP  in  the  last  4  years, \nprimarily driven by large capital spending accounting for about 30% of on-budget spending. Viet \nNam remains at low risk of external debt distress despite the recent deterioration in its economic \nconditions  and  the  global  downturn,  reflecting  Viet  Nam\u2019s  mostly  concessional  and  long-term \nstructure  of  external  debt.  The  outlook  for  public  debt  is  less  favorable.  While  it  has  been \nrelatively  stable,  at  44.4%  of  GDP,  it  is  moderately  high  for  a  developing  economy  and \nunderscores the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation (Appendix 5). However, its external \nposition remains vulnerable to modest shocks. Gross international reserves declined from $23.0 \nbillion at the end of December 2008 to $17.6 billion at the end of June 2009, equivalent to about \n3.7 months  of  import  cover.  Conventionally,  at  least  3.0  months  of  import  coverage  is \nconsidered a sufficient buffer against modest shocks to the balance of payments. At the same \ntime, Viet Nam has a relatively high level of reserves in relation to short term debt. \n \n6. \nLarge  fiscal  response.  The Government has announced a countercyclical program to \nmitigate  the  potential  severe  impacts  of  the  global  slowdown  on  Viet  Nam.  The  program \nincludes  both  on-  and  off-budget  measures  and  focuses  on  increased  infrastructure  spending, \ntemporary tax exemptions, and deferred tax payments intended to support business and bolster \ndomestic  consumption;  interest  rate  subsidies  and  credit  guarantees  intended  to  keep  credit \nflowing;  and  additional  budget  expenditure  for  social  welfare.  The  entire  stimulus  package  is \nestimated to amount to D145.6 trillion. The Government intends to use the loan proceeds from \nthe  VIE-CS  loan  to  support  its  countercyclical  spending  program  for  2009  and  2010,  and  in \nparticular  its  longer  term  infrastructure  development  in  irrigation,  transportation,  and  other \nareas.3 \n\nFiscal space. In the context of its debt burden, the fiscal stimulus package is expected \n7. \nnot  to  adversely  affect  debt  sustainability  provided  that  measures  undertaken  are  time  bound \nand do not have a permanent impact on deficits. A cross-country comparison drawing on IMF \npublications  indicates  that  the  debt  stabilizing  primary  deficit  is  within  manageable  bounds  in \nViet Nam.4 Appendix 10 provides details of fiscal stimulus packages in a number of countries. \n \n8. \nDonor  coordination.  The  VIE-CS  loan  supplements  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment under existing loan programs to Viet Nam and especially under the Support for the \nImplementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) cluster approved by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors in December 2008 (Appendix 9). The SIPRP is a series of three annual, single-tranche \nloans  (subprograms)  supporting  the  policy  reform  agenda  of  the  Government  needed  for \nsuccessful  implementation  of  its  medium-term  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP), \n2006\u20132010.  The  SIPRP  provides  parallel  financing  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction \n\n                                                 \n2  Based on Viet Nam's definition of NPLs. \n3  Prime Minister Circular 4585/VPCP-QHQt dated 6 July 2009 assigns SBV to take the lead in the effort to obtain the \ncountercyclical support loan from ADB.

The  impact  on  developing  countries  has  varied,  but  generally  the  crisis \nadversely impacted access to global financial markets; and resulted in a sharp downturn in the \nreal  economy  with  ensuing  fiscal  stress,  and  higher  unemployment  and  poverty.  The \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  projects  that  the  global  economy  will  contract  this  year  by  about \n3.8%  and  only  moderately  recover  next  year,  as  financial  market  stabilization  will  take  longer \nthan previously envisaged. The volume of world trade is expected to fall by 12.2% and FDI is \nestimated  to  fall  by  about  30%  from  2008  levels.  Developing  country  access  to  international \ncredit will remain curtailed as a consequence. \n \n11. \nFour  key  features  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  economic  developments  are  important  in \nunderstanding  the  potential  effects  of  the  global  economic  downturn  and  the  Government\u2019s \ndetermined  policy  response  to  cope  with  the  impacts.  First,  the  country  is  increasingly \ndependent  on  FDI  inflows  and  exports  to  support  its  high  economic  growth  rate,  particularly \nsince its successful accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2007. Before \nWTO  accession,  investment  in  Viet  Nam  was  dominated  by  state  investment.  In  2007,  FDI \ndisbursement surged by over 90%  and continued to expand strongly in 2008 to reach D192.4 \ntrillion. As a result, the share of FDI in the country\u2019s total investment increased to 31.5% in 2008, \nfrom  16.2%  in  2006.  At  the  same  time,  Viet  Nam  traditionally  has  a  very  high  degree  of \nopenness to trade, with a trade\u2013GDP ratio of 159% in 2008. Given its high trade intensity, it is \ntherefore  highly  vulnerable  to  shocks  to  global  demand.  Second,  Viet  Nam  entered  the  global \neconomic  downturn  from  a  position  of  domestic  economic  overheating  in  late  2007  and  early \n2008,  necessitating  a  sharp  reorientation  in  economic  policy  measures.  Third,  unlike  more \ndeveloped  economies  in  the  region,  Viet  Nam  does  not  have  all  the  same  policy  levers  and \nappropriate institutions to address the series of shocks to the economy effectively, and at times \nhad to adopt blunt and unconventional measures such as credit subsidies to mitigate the worst \neffects of the crisis on the macroeconomy and labor market. The Government is well aware of \nthe  need  for  more  market-based  instruments,  and  is  addressing  these  policy  and  institutional \nconstraints  through  ongoing  reforms  including  those  supported  by  the  SIPRP  and  the  World \nBank\u2019s PRSC series. Finally, Viet Nam has a young demographic profile, and its social security \n\n \n\n\fsystem  is  still  in  a  very  early  stage  of  development.  Therefore,  the  global  financial  crisis  has \nmajor adverse short-term implications for Viet Nam\u2019s labor market and poverty reduction efforts. \n \n12. \nThe global commodity price surge. Viet Nam has experienced three major shocks to \nits  economy  in  the  past  18  months.  The  first  was  the  surge  in  global  commodity  prices  that \nspilled over into very high domestic inflation, peaking at 28% in August 2008 on a year-on-year \nbasis. This occurred at a time when Viet Nam\u2019s economy exhibited significant signs of economic \noverheating  caused  by  rapid  credit  and  monetary  growth,  fueled  by  large  inflows  of  foreign \ninvestments.  Consequently,  the  domestic  financial  and  asset  markets  underwent  significant \ncorrection in the first half of 2008. The equity market was impacted, with equity prices collapsing \nby more than two-thirds in 2008. Property prices also fell in the major urban centers. There was \nsome capital flight (of which some was disguised through imports of gold) that put pressure on \nthe dong exchange rate to depreciate in the first semester of 2008. \n \n13. \nFirst-round effects of the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis intensified \nin  September  2008.  However,  the  spillovers  from  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the  Viet  Nam \ndomestic  financial  sector\u2014especially  banking\u2014have  been  less  significant  than  in  other \ncountries in the region because of limited exposure to troubled US assets, virtually no exposure \nto  securitization  and  off-balance-sheet  activities,  and  of  course  domestic  financial  and  asset \nmarkets  had  already  experienced  significant  correction.  The  financial  health  of  the  domestic \nbanking  system  has  improved  in  recent  years.  Overall,  the  banking  system  is  adequately \ncapitalized  but  it  remains  vulnerable  to  the  economic  slowdown,  given  the  rapid  credit  growth \nseen in the last 2 years. The Government\u2019s international reserves position declined from $23.0 \nbillion  at  the  end  of  2008  to  $17.6  billion  at  the  end  of  June  2009\u2014highlighting  continued \npressure on its external position.  \n \n14. \nThe  global  credit  crunch  that  emerged  in  September  2008  hurt  Viet  Nam  as  investors \nbecame risk averse and reduced demand for Viet Nam debt. Yields on the Government\u2019s global \nbond surged significantly, in line with many countries in the region (Figure 1.c). While the yields \nhave gradually declined, they remain elevated. As a result, so far this year the Government has \nonly  issued a  small  amount  of  dong-denominated  bonds  and  dollar-denominated  bonds  in  the \ndomestic market. The Government has not issued any sovereign bond overseas since 2005. \n \n15. \nSecond-round  effects  of  the  global  demand  destruction. The second-round effects \nof the global recession on the Viet Nam economy are greater than the impacts of the 1997/1998 \nAsian  financial  crisis.  Total  exports  fell  10.2%  in  the  first  semester  of  2009.  Traditional  labor-\nintensive sectors experienced larger contractions, with exports of light industrial and handicrafts \nfalling by 25%. The tourism sector also suffered significantly, with tourist arrivals falling 20% in \nthe first half of 2009. Disbursements of FDI declined by 18.4% in the first semester of 2009. As \na  result,  the  Viet  Nam  economy  slowed  to  3.9%  in  the  first  6  months  of  2009  over  the  same \nperiod  in  2008,  its  lowest  economic  growth  rate  since  1999,  and  well  below  its  average \neconomic growth rate of 7.6% in the last 4 years. Of significant concern for poverty reduction, \nthe inflows of remittances have dropped sharply by 26% in the first half of 2009, down to $2.7 \nbillion from $3.7 billion for the same period in 2008. \n \n16.  With this background, it is expected that economic growth for 2009 will be about 3.0%\u2013\n5.0%  because  of  faltering  exports,  slowing  foreign  investments,  and  the  drop  in  remittances. \nThese  projections  translate  to  lower  per  capita  income  growth  of  1.5%\u20133.5%  in  2009,  thereby \nlikely increasing poverty (para. 17).  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n  \n\nTable 1: Viet Nam Country Economic Indicators \n \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n554.0\n7.8\n4.4\n10.2\n7.3\n\n637.0\n8.4\n4.0\n10.7\n8.5\n\n35.5\n33.4\n\n7.8\n29.5\n\n27.8\n26.2\n1.6\n2.9\n(1.3)\n\n(2.1)\n(5.0)\n31.4\n26.6\n\n35.6\n34.5\n\n8.3\n29.7\n\n28.4\n27.3\n1.1\n4.8\n(3.6)\n\n(1.1)\n(4.6)\n22.5\n21.3\n\n \n\n \n\n834.0 \n8.5 \n3.8 \n10.2 \n8.9 \n \n \n43.1 \n33.3 \n \n \n8.3 \n46.1 \n \n \n27.6 \n29.9 \n(2.2) \n3.2 \n(5.5) \n \n \n(9.8) \n(14.6) \n21.9 \n38.3 \n \n \n\n21.0 \n18.5 \n33.3 \n\n \n\n\u2014 \n\n1,052.0\n6.2\n4.1 \n6.1\n7.2 \n\n3.9a\n1.3a \n3.5a\n5.5a \n\n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n10.3a\n25.0a\n\n25.1b\n27.9 b\n(2.8)b\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n41.1\n29.3\n\n23.0 \n20.3 \n\n28.2\n29.4\n(1.2)\n2.9\n(4.1) \n\n(11.8)\n(14.1)\n29.1\n28.1\n\n0.4b\n(0.5)b\n(10.2)b\n(34.1)b\n\n23.0\n15.9\n29.8\n\n17.6b\n16.4b\n\u2014 \n\n724.0 \n8.2 \n3.7 \n10.4 \n8.3 \n \n \n36.8 \n36.5 \n \n \n7.5 \n33.6 \n \n \n29.7 \n27.5 \n2.1 \n3.4 \n(1.2) \n \n \n(0.3) \n(4.6) \n22.7 \n22.1 \n \n \n\n11.5 \n14.0 \n31.4 \n\nB.

As  a  result,  it  is  expected  that  new  job  entrants  will  outnumber  new  jobs \ncreated by more than 2 to 1\u2014putting significant pressure on the labor market, earnings, and poverty. \nThe Government is concerned that the current global financial crisis will have adverse effects on \nits efforts to reduce poverty if there is a significant reduction in economic growth, retrenchments, \nand shrinking employment opportunities. While timely employment data are not available, data \nfrom the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) suggest that 1,260 enterprises \nreported job cuts of about 65,000 workers in the first few months of 2009. As expected, job cuts \nare mainly from export-oriented industries such as textiles and garments, leather and footwear, \nhandicrafts,  seafood  processing,  and  agriculture  processing.  Critical  economic  zones  such  as \nHo Chi Minh City, Ha Noi, Binh Duong, and Dong Nai are among the worse affected.

Actual  revenue  collected  in  the  first  half  of  2009  was  about  5.1% \nbelow the target specified in the 2009 budget plan, partly because of temporary tax exemptions \nprovided as part of the fiscal stimulus (Figure 2).

On the monetary side, the State Bank of \nVietnam  (the  central  bank)  has  broadly  operated  an  appropriate  monetary  policy  stance \nthroughout  the  crisis.  In  early  2008,  it  tightened  monetary  policy  (including  introducing \ncompulsory sale of bills) to counter the threat of second-round inflationary pressures and to cool \nthe  economy.  It  then  shifted  to  a  more  accommodative  stance  at  the  end  of  2008  to  promote \ngrowth against the backdrop of falling commodity prices and inflation. Inflation fell from a peak \nof  28%  in  August  2008 to  2.0% in August  2009.  Although inflation  has  declined  rapidly,  some \npressure on the dong to depreciate remains.

The \ncurrent  account  has  undertaken  a  substantial  cyclical  correction.  Trade  deficit  declined  to \n$2.1 billion  in  the  first  semester  of  2009  from  $11.4  billion  during  the  same  period  in  2008. \nHowever,  the  external  balance  remains  vulnerable  to  modest  shocks.  The  Government\u2019s \ninternational  reserves  position  declined  by  about  $5.5  billion  since  December  2008  to  $17.6 \nbillion in June 2009, in part due to increasing capital outflows in the first quarter of 2009. The \npace  of  capital  outflows  declined  significantly  in  the  second  quarter.  The  external  vulnerability \nrisks are partly mitigated by declining inflationary expectation as shown by slight appreciation in \nthe dong in August 2009. The Government\u2019s international reserves is sufficient to cover about \n3.7 months of imports and short-term debt is relatively low at about 10% of gross international \nreserves.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s response to mitigating the risk of the global financial crisis involves a \n21. \nthe  banking  system, \nnumber  of  proactive  measures  aimed  at \nstrengthening  the  capital  base  of  the  banking  system,  and  strengthening  SBV\u2019s  supervisory \n                                                 \n7  Based on Viet Nam's definition of nonperforming loan. \n\nincreasing \n\nliquidity \n\nBlack m arket exchange rate\n\nUpper trading band lim it\n\nM a y-0 9\n\nJ a n-0 9\n\nS e p-0 8\n\nN o v-0 8\n\nM ar-0 9\n\nin \n\nJ ul-0 8\n\n31-Aug-08\n\n31-Mar-08\n\n30-Jun-09\n\n31-Jan-09\n\n31-Oct-07\n\n15,000\n\n15,500\n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n  \n\nefforts. First, SBV increased liquidity in the banking system by easing monetary policy including \nreducing its base interest rate, lowering its reserve requirements, and allowing for an advanced \npayment  of  SBV  bills  that  the  commercial  banks  were  required  to  purchase  in  March  2008  as \npart  of  its  earlier  bid  to  address  economic  overheating.  Second,  SBV  moved  toward  a  more \nflexible exchange rate by widening the exchange rate trading band to +/\u20135% by March 2009 to \nallow  exchange  rate  adjustment  to  help  absorb  some  of  the  external  shock  felt  by  exporters. \nThird,  SBV  upgraded  its  supervision  efforts  considerably,  and  raised  the  minimum  capital \nrequirement for commercial banks. With these measures, indicators show signs of improvement.   \n \n22. \nPublic finances. With the destruction in global demand since September 2008, and the \nrecognition by the Government and development partners that a fiscal expansion is necessary, \nthe Government announced a fiscal stimulus package in early 2009. ADB staff estimate that an \noverall  budget  deficit  could  reach  10.3%  of  GDP  (Table  2).This  budget  deficit  represents  an \nincrease of up to 6.2% of GDP from 2008 levels, which is high relative to regional standards.8 \nHowever,  a  large  part  of  the  increase  in  the  deficit  in  the  budget  plan  is  due  to  conservative \nrevenue projections, which reduces revenues by 3.0% of GDP from 2008 levels, attributable to \nan  expected  lower  price  for  fuel  and  its  knock-on  effect  for  crude  oil  royalty  payments. \nNevertheless, whether the overall deficit reaches 10.3% of GDP will depend on implementation \nand  timing  of  the  different  fiscal  stimulus  measures  and  actual  budget  revenue  outcomes  for \n2009.  Some  of  the  planned  capital  spending  measures  are  dependent  on  financing  through \nGovernment Treasury bonds and thus may be delayed.9 Therefore, the actual stimulus impact \nof  the  expansion  will  be  less  than  3.2%  of  GDP  (netting  out  projected  revenue  declines).  A \nrecent  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  study  suggests  that  the  magnitude  of  the  fiscal \nexpansion,  discretionary  and  nondiscretionary  components,  should  depend  on  the  size  of  the \noutput gap.10 Overall, the actual fiscal stimulus in Viet Nam covers the projected negative output \ngap this year (i.e., the gap between potential and actual economic growth), suggesting that the \nsize of the fiscal expansion is sufficient (Appendix 3).  \n \nADB staff estimates indicate that the cyclically adjusted budget overall deficit for 2009 is \n23. \nabout  4.5%  of  GDP  after  making  adjustments  for  the  temporary  stimulus  measures,  such  as \ntemporary  tax  exemptions  and  deferral,  infrastructure  spending  to  be  carried  over  from  2008, \ninfrastructure  spending  to  be  brought  forward  from  2010,  and  interest  rate  subsidy  (Table  3). \nAlthough the cyclically adjusted deficit is close to the historical average, its large size suggests \nthat  room  for  further  fiscal  expansion  is  limited  over  the  medium  term.  The  Government \nrecognizes  the  necessity  for  fiscal  consolidation  over  the  medium  term  and  to  reduce  its \ndependency  on  oil-related  revenues  going  forward,  primarily  by  expanding  the  tax  base.  The \nimplementation  of  Tax  System  Reform  and  Modernization  for  2005\u20132010  has  produced  good \nresults, which have set a base for more progress and modernization in the coming years. The \nGovernment  has  made  significant  progress  in  improving  tax  administration,  following  the \npassage of a Tax Administration Law in 2007. The National Assembly passed a new corporate \nIncome tax law and personal income tax law in 2008. The two laws have been effective since \nJanuary 2009. Together with implementing the new tax laws, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) also \naims  to  improve  tax  administration  further,  and  thereby  increase  the  number  of  registered \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB staff estimates of fiscal expansion in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, 1.8% of GDP; Indonesia, 2.4%; Philippines, \n\n2.3%; and Thailand, 5.1%. \n\n9  Given the Government\u2019s conservative approach in obtaining budget financing, it is likely that implementation of part \nof the infrastructure spending in the fiscal stimulus could be delayed. Only a small amount of domestic bonds has \nbeen issued since early January, as market yields remain higher than the thresholds set by the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF). \n\n10 Horton,  M.  and  A.

Despite  a  significant  increase  in  budget  deficit,  the \n24. \nGovernment\u2019s debt position is projected to be sustainable. The Government\u2019s public debt at the \nend  of  2008  was  at  44.4%  of  GDP,  56%  of  which  is  external  debt.  The  recent  International \nMonetary Fund Article IV Consultation11 concludes that Viet Nam\u2019s debt position is at low risk of \ndistress. Most debt is concessional, with a low fixed interest rate and well spread out maturities. \nUnder the baseline scenario, the present value of public debt in relation to GDP is projected to \nincrease  from  37%  of  GDP  in  2008  to  46%  in  2013,  and  decline  thereafter  to  43%  in  2028. \nStress  tests  of  a  one-time  30%  depreciation  in  the  dong  would  increase  the  present  value  of \npublic  debt  by  7%,  and  an  increase  in  debt-creating  flows  by  10  percentage  points  of  GDP \nwould  increase  the  present  value  of  public  debt  by  8%  in  2013.  However,  these  two  risks  are \nless likely to materialize now. The trade balance position has improved significantly relative to \nlast year. Although fiscal stimulus will increase the budget deficit in 2009, a large part of it will be \nfinanced  by  government  deposits  (non-debt  creating  flows).  In  addition,  the  fiscal  stimulus \ninvolves advancing project implementation from 2010, which is expected to reduce the budget \ndeficit  and  debt  financing  in  2010.  Based  on  IMF  projections,  Viet  Nam  requires  a  primary \nbudget deficit of about 3.3% of GDP to stabilize its debt over the medium term. Therefore, Viet \nNam has sufficient fiscal space as its debt is mostly concessional. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE GOVERNMENT\u2019S COUNTERCYCLICAL PROGRAM \n\nfocusing  on  advancing \n\ninfrastructure  projects  already \n\n  \nThe  Government  announced  its  countercyclical  expenditure  program  earlier  this  year \n25. \nand the National Assembly endorsed it in June 2009. Like many other developing economies, \nthe  national  government  budget  does  not  have  automatic  stabilizers  embedded  on  the \nexpenditure  side  of  the  budget  and  its  social  security  system  is  still  in  too  early  a  stage  of \ndevelopment  to  be  an  adequate  stabilizer  (Appendix  10).12 Therefore,  it  had  to  announce  the \ncountercyclical  program, \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  investment  pipeline,  tax  cuts  and  deferred  payments  intended  to  support \nbusiness  and  bolster  domestic  consumption,  interest  rate  subsidies  and  credit  guarantees \nintended  to  keep  credit  flowing,  and  additional  budget  expenditure  for  social  welfare.  The \ncountercyclical  program  is  designed  to  stimulate  the  economy,  with  particular  focus  on \nprotecting employment and social stability. Given that Viet Nam\u2019s social security system is in its \ninfancy, the Government feels it needs to use blunt and some unconventional instruments, such \nas  credit  subsidies,  to  protect  employment  and  assist  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  in  the \ncommunity.  Much  of  this  additional  stimulus  is  discretionary  and  temporary  in  nature,  and \ntherefore  does  not  undermine  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  for  medium-term  fiscal  consolidation. \nOverall, the stimulus package amounts to D145.6 trillion of on- and off-budget programs (Table \n3). \n \n26. \nInfrastructure. Additional spending on infrastructure in 2009 is projected at D90.8 trillion \n(62%  of  the  stimulus  package),  achieved  mainly  through  carrying  over  savings  from  the \ninfrastructure program in the 2008 budget and advancing to 2009 priority projects from the 2010 \ninvestment pipeline (Table 3).13 Under current public financial regulations, line agencies are only \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n11 International  Monetary  Fund.  2009.  Vietnam;  2008  Article  IV  Consultation\u2500Staff  Report;  Staff  Supplement \nStatement; Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion; and Statement by the Executive Director \nfor Vietnam.  IMF Country Report No. 09/110. Washington, DC. (April). \n\n12 International  experience  suggests  that  the  mix  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  package  depends  on  the  country\u2019s  fiscal \ncharacteristics.  Countries  in  which  the  automatic  stabilizers  are  larger  will  need  a  smaller  discretionary  stimulus. \nFiscal expansion should be larger in a particular country if multipliers are lower. However, fiscal space will limit the \nsize of fiscal stimulus in some countries. \n\n13 Infrastructure components of the fiscal stimulus package are mostly off-budget items. However, all of them require \n\napproval of the National Assembly just like other on-budget items of the budget. \n\n \n\n\fable to disburse funds on projects up to 1 month after the fiscal year ends. In response to the \ncrisis,  the  Government  extended  this  deadline  to  June  2009.  The  2010  advanced  priority \nprojects cover transportation, rural irrigation, canal upgrading, poverty reduction projects in the \n61  poor  districts  across  the  country,  and  social  housing  construction.  Many  of  these  priority \nprojects are quick disbursing, labor-intensive projects to ensure maximum job creation from the \ninfrastructure  projects.  About  D20  trillion  of  these  projects  will  depend  on  issuance  of \ngovernment bonds and these could be delayed given the current high cost of domestic financing.    \n \nTax  measures. Temporary tax exemptions and deferred tax payments for eligible firms \n27. \nto  the  end  of  2009  are  designed  to  have  had  an  immediate  impact  on  stimulating  household \nconsumption and to provide tax relief to labor-intensive firms to protect employment, while much \nof  the  infrastructure  spending  is  only  expected  to  have  an  impact  in  the  second  semester  of \n2009  because  of  the  longer  time  involved  in  the  procurement  and  disbursement  process.  The \ntax  relief  measures  apply  to  corporate  income  tax  or  CIT  (for  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises and firms operating in the textile and footwear sectors), personal income tax (PIT), \nand  value-added  tax  (VAT);  and  amount  to  D28  trillion.  MOF  adopted  a  mix  of  temporary  tax \nexemptions and deferred tax payments to protect its medium-term revenue sustainability efforts \nwhile providing relief to distressed firms and boosting household income. It projects that these \nmeasures will cover up to D13 trillion in tax collection in 2009, of which some proportion will be \ndeferred payments to the end of 2009 and 2010.  \n \n28. \nInterest rate subsidies and credit guarantees. The Government introduced a number \nof unconventional measures to provide relief to labor-intensive enterprises, with the objective of \nprotecting  employment.  These  included  an  interest  rate  subsidy  of  4%  on  short-term  working \ncapital  signed  and  disbursed  from  February  2009  to  December  2009.  The  same  subsidy  is \napplied  to  medium-  and  long-term  investment  loans  signed  and  disbursed  from  April  2009  to \nDecember 2011. The interest rate subsidy is designed to partially offset the increase in the cost \nof  domestic  financing  arising  from  the  global  financial  crisis  and  SBV\u2019s  earlier  policy  efforts  to \ncool  the  economy.  The  subsidized  loans  are  extended  by  the  commercial  banks  and  finance \ncompanies  (and  reimbursed  by  SBV)  to  eligible  borrowers  on  the  basis  of  normal  commercial \nprinciples.  A  new  credit  guarantee  scheme  for  SMEs\u2019  capital  spending,  implemented  through \nVietnam  Development  Bank  (VDB)  was  also  introduced.  The  guarantee  scheme  is  aimed  at \nenterprises  with  less  than  1,000  employees  and  capital  of  less  than  D20  billion.  Under  the \nscheme,  VDB  will  assess  eligible  enterprises  and  issue  a  guarantee  letter  for  them  to  borrow \nfrom commercial banks. SBV has budgeted this subsidy cost at D17 trillion. While interest rate \nsubsidies  and  guarantees  could  create  problems  of  their  own,  the  Government  considers  that \nthis  is  one  of  a  few  instruments  it  has  available  to  help  keep  the  flow  of  credit  to  enterprises \nunder the current situation, and only intends most of it to be a temporary measure. At the same \ntime, SBV has upgraded its monitoring and supervision of the credit subsidy scheme. \n \nSocial  assistance  spending.  In  the  absence  of  national  social  assistance  programs \n29. \nthat could be quickly scaled up and effectively targeted, the Government announced a package \nof assistance to poor families and community groups vulnerable to falling into poverty as a result \nof the economic slowdown. This underscores the necessity for developing better targeted social \nassistance  programs  over  the  medium  term.  The  package  of  assistance  includes  wage \nsubsidies to distressed firms, disaster mitigation programs, and one-off financial assistance and \nhousing support to low-income families as a way to mitigate the worst effects of the crisis on the \nmost  vulnerable  in  the  community.  The  Government  will  also  extend  loans  from  the  National \nEmployment  Fund  to  workers  laid  off  for  training  and  self-employment.  The  Government  has \nalso focused its social welfare efforts on 61 districts identified as being the poorest in Viet Nam \nwith  poverty  incidence  close  to  50%,  more  than  3.5  times  of  the  national  average.  These \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n  \n\ndistricts  span  20  provinces,  primarily  in  the  northwest,  northeast,  north  central,  and  central \nhighland regions of the country.  \n \n30.  MOF  is  monitoring  implementation  and  disbursement  of  key  countercyclical  spending \nprograms. About 80% of unspent infrastructure spending from the 2008 budget was disbursed \nby  May  2009.  The  tax  exemptions  and  deferred  payments  impacted  immediately.  As  of  June \n2009,  D370  trillion  in  credits  were  disbursed  under  the  subsidy  credit  scheme,  over  90%  of \nwhich was for working capital. The Government recognizes that additional fiscal stimulus could \nalso be generated by expediting the disbursement of project loans that have been approved by \nthe  Government.  In  this  context,  the  Government  has  taken  steps  to  simplify  and  streamline \nregulations governing public investment, and to initiate monthly review meetings to monitor and \nimprove  official  development  assistance  disbursement.  Policy  dialogue  is  also  progressing  on \nimproving  public  investment  between  the  Government  and  the  Six  Banks  Group,  comprising \nADB, France Agency for Development (AFD), Japan International Cooperation Agency, Export-\nImport  Bank  of  Korea,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  Entwicklungsbank  (KfW),  and  the  World \nBank.  \n \n31. \nThe  effectiveness  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  stimulus  package  will  depend  on  better \nbudget execution and targeting. The Government\u2019s public financial management (PFM) reforms \nare  at  an  early  stage  but  steady  progress  is  being  made  in  establishing  and  improving  the \nlegislative  and  institutional  framework.  The  Law  on  Public  Debt  Management  has  been \npromulgated  by  the  National  Assembly  and  will  be  effective  from  January  2010.  The  new  law \nwill  provide  a  legal  framework  for  a  modern  debt  management  system  to  monitor  public  debt, \nanalyzing its profile, and resolving and managing related fiscal risks. Implementation of the 2002 \nState Budget Law is progressing. At the same time, the Government is working on several items \nof  key  legislation  that  will  significantly  enhance  public  financial  management  over  the  medium \nterm. The proposed revision to the Law on State Budget is aimed at (i) introducing a medium-\nterm expenditure framework and performance-based budgeting; (ii) improving budget execution; \n(iii)  enhancing  budget  supervision,  monitoring,  and  implementation;  and  (iv)  increasing \ndecentralization of budget management. A new integrated computerized financial management \nsystem (TABMIS) has been rolled out since 2008 to strengthen expenditure management and \ncontrol.  An  updated  and  improved  chart  of  accounts  is  being  developed  for  implementation  in \n2009.  A  road  map  for  adoption  of  international  public  sector  accounting  standards  has  been \napproved to provide the basis for preparing the Government\u2019s financial statements to be more in \nline with international practices. The Government is also laying the building blocks for improved \ngovernance  and  anticorruption  measures.  Since  2005,  implementation  of  the  State  Audit  Law \nand  reporting  of  the  summaries  of  annual  audit  reports  by  the  State  Audit  of  Vietnam  have \nstrengthened  the  process  of  external  oversight.  Under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PRSC  series  and \nADB\u2019s  SIPRP,  the  Government  is  working  on  improving  governance  in  recruitment  and \npromotion  of  civil  servants,  and  development  of  an  anticorruption  strategy.  The  Government \nrecognizes  the  need  to  measure  progress  and impacts  of  the  PFM  reforms  and  has  indicated \nthat it will adopt PEFA measurement framework going forward. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Viet Nam: 2009 Discretionary Fiscal Stimulusa \n(D trillion unless otherwise indicated) \n \n\n \n\n \n \nItem \nRevenue \n30% reduction of CIT payments by SMEs for Q4 2008\u2013Q4 \n2009; 30% reduction of CIT payments by large textile and \nshoe-manufacturing companies for Q4 2008; and 9-month \ndeferral of CIT payments by SMEs and large companies \noperating in certain sectors of the economy  \nExemption of all personal income from the PIT in the first half \nof 2009 and exemption of certain types of personal income \nfrom the PIT in the second half of 2009 \n50% reduction of the VAT on certain goods and services; \nadvance reimbursement of 90% of VAT payments on inputs \nused in export production; and 180-day deferral of VAT \npayments on certain imports \n \nExpenditure and net lending \nInterest rate subsidies \none-off additional financial assistance to the poor on the \noccasion of the 2009 Tet (lunar new year) holiday  \nHousing support for the poor   \nCarried over 2008 capital expenditure  \na     To be financed with revenue carried over from 2008 \nb     To be financed through issuance of treasury bonds \nExpenditure brought forward from 2010 and 2011.

The venturing of \nlarge  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  into  assets  markets  on  a  large  scale  partly  fueled  the \nasset  bubbles  of  2007/2008.  To  address  these  risks,  the  Government  revised  the  relevant \nregulations  on  the  financial  management  of  SOEs  to  limit  the  scope  and  nature  of  their \ninvestment  activities  outside  their  main  business  lines.  The  Government  has  embarked  on \npublic  sector  reforms.  The  structure  of  government  was  streamlined  and  reorganized  in  2008. \nThe mandate and role of each government agency were redefined and overlapping of functions \neliminated to strengthen their accountability. The new law on civil servants will be effective from \nJanuary  2010,  aiming  at  strengthening  the  integrity  and  accountability  of  public  services.  The \nGovernment has made strong efforts to simplify administrative procedures through adoption of \nthe one-stop-shop model and recently through the implementation of Project 30. A bold and far-\nreaching master plan issued by the Prime Minister in July 2008 is aimed at cutting red tape and \nensuring  consistency,  simplicity,  and  transparency  of  administrative  procedures.  In  addition, \npredictability  and  transparency  in  the  law-making  process  will  be  significantly  improved  with \nimplementation  of  the  Law  on  Promulgation  of  Legal  Normative  Documents,  effective  from  1 \nJanuary  2009.  The  law  requires  that  all  drafts  laws,  ordinances,  and  decrees  undergo  a \ncompulsory regulatory impact assessment before submission to the National Assembly.   \n \n\nV. \n\nOBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND COVERAGE OF THE LOAN \n\n33. \nThe objective of the CSF loan is to provide support for the Government\u2019s countercyclical \nspending program for 2009 and, therefore, ensure predictability in its budget financing given the \nnecessity  for  temporary  fiscal  expansion.  This  will  allow  the  Government  to  support  economic \ngrowth  during  a  challenging  period  of  weak  global  growth,  protect  its  social  spending  and \npoverty  alleviation  programs  and  objectives,  and  continue  with  its  longer  term  development \nobjectives in 2009. \n\n34. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $500,000,000  under  the  CSF  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank-offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  plus  200  basis  points;  a  5-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; a commitment charge of 75 basis points on the undisbursed \nloan balance; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The  Government  has  provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \n\n \n\n\fthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n\n35. \nThe  loan  size  reflects  the  budget  financing  needs  of  the  Government  arising  from  the \nneed to finance the fiscal stimulus package (Table 4). According to ADB staff projections based \non  discussion  with  MOF,  the  gross  budget  financing  requirements  for  2009  are  estimated  at \nD203.5  trillion.  About  D51.3  trillion  of  increasing  infrastructure  spending  will  be  financed  by \ngovernment  deposit  and  D49.4  trillion  will  be  financed  from  external  concessional  borrowing. \nBased  on  the  existing  regulation,  the  Government  cannot  finance  an  increasing  budget  deficit \nfrom  external  commercial  sources.  The  proposed  VIE-CS  loan  amount  of  $500 million,  other \nADB  program  loans  amounting  to  a  combined  $100  million,  and  other  development  partners\u2019 \nprograms  and  commercial  borrowings  will  help  close  the  financing  gap  for  2009.  The \nGovernment plans to close the remainder by issuing domestic bonds.  \n \n\nTable 4: Projected Financing Requirements of the Government of Viet Nam for 2009 \n(D trillion) \n\nFinancing Mix \nGross Financing Requirements \nLess Amortization \n \nNet Financing Requirement \nProgrammed Gross Net External Borrowings \n\nof which: \nADB\u2019s Proposed Loan Pipeline \nCountercyclical Support Facility \nSupport for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program \n\n \n\nOther Multilateral and Bilateral Agencies \n \n\nNet Domestic Financing  \n Of which government deposits \nFinancing Gap \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = D17,600 \nSources: Ministry of Finance and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nProposed \nAmount \n203.5 \n34.7 \n \n168.8 \n49.4 \n \n \n8.8 \n1.8 \n \n37.8 \n \n70.8 \n51.3 \n48.5 \n\nVI. \n\nIMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n\nA. \n\nCountercyclical Support Facility Management \n\n36. \nSBV will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall execution and coordination of \nthe  Government's  countercyclical  program  and  for  reporting  to  ADB.    The  Government  will \nestablish  a  committee,  chaired  by  MPI,  comprising  officials  from  SBV,  MOF,  and  other  line \nministries. The committee will be responsible for monitoring and overseeing the implementation \nof  the  Government's  countercyclical  programs  supported  under  the  CSF  loan.  The  committee \nwill meet quarterly to report on progress of implementation of the Government's countercyclical \nprograms  supported  under  the  loan.  The  committee  will  also  report  on  overall  progress  of  the \nGovernment's countercyclical public expenditure program. ADB may be invited to participate in \nsome  of  the  meetings  as  an  observer.    At  the  implementation  level,  SBV  and  MOF  will  be \nresponsible  for  administering  the  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds  from  ADB  and  maintaining \naccounts. MPI will select and submit the proposals for activities to be supported under the CSF \nloan. The line ministries will assist SBV in monitoring activities carried out by their ministries. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n  \n\nB. \n\nPeriod and Tranching \n\n37. \nThe period specified for VIE-CS will be from 1 September 2009 to 31 December 2010, \nwith  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $500  million  to  be  disbursed  when  the  Government  has  met  the \nconditions for loan effectiveness. \n \nC. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\nThe loan of $500 million will be released in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness. The \n38. \nloan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and \ntaxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  no  more  than  180  days \nbefore  the  effectiveness  date  of  the  loan.  Items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items \n(Appendix 8)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources  are  excluded.  In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Disbursement  Procedures,  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed to Viet Nam as the Borrower.14 No supporting import documentation will be required if \nduring each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Viet Nam\u2019s total \nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures  will  be  required.  Disbursements  will  be  made  under  the  simplified  procedures  for \nprogram  loans.  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements  for  program  loans,  all  goods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \nD. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\n39. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  VIE-CS.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  VIE-CS.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  VIE-CS  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n40. \nThe  Government  agreed  to  publish  the  Country  Fiduciary  Assessment  completed  in \npartnership  with  the  World  Bank,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners  in  October  2008. 15 \nWhile noting progress made in PFM reforms, the assessment points out some areas for further \nimprovement. Implementation of the 2002 State Budget Law and the 2005 Accounting Law is \nprogressing.  However,  the  State  Budget  Law  and  the  Accounting  Law  need  to  be  updated \ncomprehensively.  Budget  coverage  in  Viet  Nam  is  reasonably  comprehensive,  but  still \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998.

The \n\nassessment was jointly prepared by the Government, the World Bank, ADB, and interested donors.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\nincomplete  compared  to  international  practices.  The  Government  has  piloted  a  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  in  several  sectors,  but  it  needs  to  be  scaled  up  and  mainstreamed  in \nthe  annual  budget  cycle.  PFM  systems  are  being  upgraded  by  rolling  out  TABMIS,  and  the \nroad map for adoption of international public sector accounting standards has been issued. The \nState  Audit  Law  has  provided  independence  for  the  state  auditing  body  and  enhanced \ntransparency by making audit report publicly available. Oversight by the National Assembly and \nprovincial  people\u2019s  committee  councils  has  continued  to  strengthen.  The  World  Bank\u2019s \nassessment  suggests  that  the  fiduciary  risks  of  the  current  PFM  systems  (budgeting, \naccounting, reporting, and auditing) are moderate.16  \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \n41. \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen  a  deposit  account  at  the  central  bank  (State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam)  to  receive  all  loan \nproceeds.  The  account  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \nF. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and VIE-CS Review \n\nIn cooperation with the Executing Agency (para. 36), during the period specified for the \n42. \ncountercyclical  programs,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  reviews  of  macroeconomic \nperformance and implementation of the Government\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program and \nreport  to  the  Board.  The  mechanism  for  the  proposed  VIE-CS  loan  comprises  of  three  parts: \n(i) an  established  interagency  coordination  committee  (and  process)  for  monitoring  and \nreporting,  (ii)  use  of  country  PFM  systems  for  monitoring  budget  execution  of  projects  and \nprograms  supported  under  the  VIE-CS  loan  and  listed  in  Table  3,  and  (iii)  ADB  surveys  and \ndevelopment partners\u2019 mechanisms for monitoring selected projects supported under the loan. \n \n43. \nThe coordinating committee (process). MPI will be the focal point for the coordinating \ncommittee, comprising relevant agencies including SBV, MOF, and line ministries. SBV will be \nthe coordinator for macroeconomic performance monitoring, and MPI in coordination with MOF \nand  relevant  line  ministries  will  report  on  implementation  of  the  countercyclical  program.  ADB \nstaff will meet with the coordinating committee on a quarterly basis and a report for the loan will \nbe  done  on  a  semiannual  basis.  MOF  will  provide  budget  disbursement  data  of  the  relevant \nspending  line  ministries  for  the  countercyclical  program.  MPI  and  relevant  line  ministries  will \nprovide field data on selected program implementation. \n \n44.  Monitoring macroeconomic performance. ADB will review and assess developments \nin  the  key  macroeconomic  indicators  presented  and  described  in  the  access  criteria  matrix  in \nAppendix  2,  including  quarterly  fiscal  data  and  budget  outturns,  public  debt  ratios,  external \nbalance, and a monetary survey. In assessing the macroeconomic performance, it will draw on \nMOF\u2019s  monthly  reviews  of  implementation  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  package,  IMF  reports  on \nViet Nam  (including  its annual  Article  IV  Consultations  with  the  Government)  and  the  selected \nissues and, and any other relevant materials. ADB staff will also draw on the reports and results \nof  the  broader  dialogue  over,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of,  reforms  under  the  PRSC  and \nSIPRP series which are presented to the Consultative Group Meeting on a semiannual basis. \n \n\n                                                 \n16 World  Bank.  2009.

Second,  it  will  monitor  the  programs  and  projects  identified  in  Table  3. \nCollection of budget execution data and accomplishments will be coordinated through MOF. For \npromoting  independent  quality  control  of  selected  infrastructure  projects,  ADB  will  undertake \nwith MPI field surveys of selected infrastructure projects supported by the VIE-CS at the end of \nthe facility period (December 2010) as a tool for independent quality control.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n46. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  of  $500,000,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Countercyclical \nSupport  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 basis points; a \nterm of 5 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard.  \n \n\n \n \n \nC.

Adverse Impact of \nthe Global Economic \nCrisis \n\n \n\nIndicators \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSTATE OF ACCESS CRITERIA COMPLIANCE MATRIX \n \n\nADB Assessment \nSummary:  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy  has  been  adversely  impacted  by  the  global  economic  crisis  in \nseveral  ways.  Since  its  accession  to  the  WTO,  economic  growth  has  been  increasingly  more \nreliant  on  FDI  and  exports.  In  2008,  FDI  contributed  about  32%  of  total  investments.  Total \nexports in the same year were equivalent to 78% of GDP. FDI approvals in the first 6 months of \n2009  have  declined  by  about  75%.  Exports  also  declined  by  10.2%  during  the  same  period. \nTourist  arrivals  also  dropped  by  19%.  Although  economic  growth  for  the  fist  half  of  the  year \nremained resilient at 3.9%, without strong domestic efforts and fiscal stimulus, poverty incidence \nis projected to increase significantly. \nEconomic  growth  for  the  first  half  of  the  year  contracted  to  3.9%,  about  3\u20134  percentage  points \nbelow  recent  annual  average  growth.  This  is  significantly  below  the  rate  needed  to  sustain \npoverty reduction and create jobs to meet the needs of the expanding labor force. \nExports,  excluding  re-export  of  gold,  also  declined  by  10.2%  during  the  same  period.  Tourist \narrivals also dropped by 19%. FDI disbursements dropped by 18.4 and FDI approvals declined \nby about 75%.in the first 6 months of 2009. \nThe inflow of remittances have also been affected by the global economic downturn, estimated to \nhave declined by 26% from $3.7 billion in the first half of 2008 to $2.7 billion in the first half of \n2009. \nTo accommodate the fiscal stimulus, the Government plans to increase the budget deficit  from \n4.7% to 7.0% of GDP, a, as approved by the National Assembly in June 2009. However, as most \nof the fiscal stimulus package is off-budget, budget deficit including off-budget operation is much \nhigher\u2014projected at about 10.3% of GDP. \nTax  revenue  has  softened  because  of  weakening  growth,  declining  trade  flows,  and  the  tax-\nrelated stimulus package. Actual domestic revenue collected for the first 6 months is about 5.1% \nbelow  target  specified  in  the  2009  budget  plan.  However,  the  revenue  target  for  2009  is  very \nconservative\u2014about 3% of GDP below actual collection in 2008. \nFive-year  bond  yields  increased  to  20.3%  in  June  2008  from  about  8.7%  before  the  crisis  in \nJanuary 2008. Yields have gradually declined to around 9.5% since April 2009.  \nThe  Government  is  implementing  a  countercyclical  program  containing  (i)  a  combination  of \ntemporary  tax  reductions  and  deferral  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  selected \nsectors,  (ii)  an  interest  subsidy  scheme  for  eligible  enterprises,  (iii)  infrastructure  spending \nfocusing on roads and irrigation, and (iv) social safety net related spending for the poor. \nThe  stimulus  package  includes  a  plan  to  advance  the  implementation  of  critically  important \nprojects  from  2010  and  investments  to  be  financed  by  revenue  brought  forward  from  the  2008 \nbudget.

The latter is important since preventing a collapse in economic activity is \ncritical to mitigate social impacts of the crisis, given that the social insurance system is still in an \nearly stage of development. \nSummary.  The  Government  has  improved  its  macroeconomic  management  and  learned  from \nexperience.  Viet  Nam  entered  the  current  global  financial  crisis  with  economic  overheating \nresulting  from  massive  capital  inflows.  Strong  and  coordinated  policy  measures  by  the \nGovernment and  SBV  succeeded  in  arresting accelerating  inflation  pressures and reducing  the \ntrade  deficit  to  manageable  levels.  The  Government  introduced  fiscal  stimulus  measures  while \neasing monetary policy appropriately to respond to weakening growth prospects. \nMonetary policy was loosened cautiously through a combination of measures. SBV lowered its \npolicy rate from 14% in October 2008 to 7% in May 2009, and reduced the reserve requirement \nratio from 11% in early November 2008 to 3% since March 2009. To ease liquidity in the banking \nsystem  further,  SBV  purchased  back  compulsory  bonds  placed  in  commercial  banks.  It  also \nwidened  the  exchange  rate  trading  band  to  +/\u20135%  from  +/\u20133%  to  increase  exchange  rate \nflexibility to allow for a larger role of exchange rate adjustment to absorb the impacts of external \nshocks.  Inflation  declined  rapidly  to  2.0%  in  August  2009  from  the  peak  of  28.3%  in  August \n2008. \nSBV upgraded its supervision efforts considerably and raised minimum capital requirements for \nsmaller banks. This measure has strengthened  the resilience of the banking system during the \ncrisis.  The  interest  rate  subsidy  program  for  working  capital  loans  for  eligible  enterprises  has \nplayed an important role in keeping credit flowing in the first half of 2009. \nPublic debt is sustainable. Although the fiscal deficit has been historically large (average of 4% in \n2005\u20132008),  the  latest  International  Monetary  Fund\u2013World  Bank  debt  sustainability  analysis 1 \nsuggests  that  both  external  and  domestic  debt  positions  are  sustainable;  the  external  debt \nservices ratios is 3.4% to exports and 3.5% to government revenue. This is because most debt is \nconcessional,  with  a  low  fixed  interest  rate  and  well  spread  out  maturities.  Public  debt \nsustainability analysis suggests that a significant increase in debt-creating fiscal stimulus and a \n30% nominal depreciation of the dong would increase the debt ratio significantly. However, even \nlarge  negative  shocks  would  not  destabilize  the  present  value  of  the  debt  ratio  over  the  longer \nterm. \nThe  larger  fiscal  deficit,  despite  its  temporary  nature,  will  increase  government  debt  and \ncomplicate fiscal management going forward.

The  sharp  slowdown  in  growth  was  broad-based,  with  most \nmajor  economic  sectors  declining,  driven  by  the  export-oriented  manufacturing  sector. \nDepressed external demand for goods and sluggish foreign direct investment inflows were the \nprimary drivers behind the economic deceleration in the first quarter of 2009.   \n\n \n2. \nAnother way of looking at economic performance is the output gap, which measures the \ndifference  between  potential  output  and  actual  output  measured  in  terms  of  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  growth.  A  small  output  gap  would  suggest  that  the  economy  is  at  its  long-run \ntrend or full employment. If growth exceeds the potential growth rate (i.e., a positive output gap), \nit  would  suggest  that  the  economy  risks  overheating  associated  with  above-trend  inflation.  If \nactual  growth  is  below  potential  (i.e.,  a  negative  output  gap),  this  suggests  an  economic \ndownturn  usually  associated  with  below  trend  inflation.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  staff \nestimates indicate Viet Nam\u2019s potential economic growth in 2009 the range of 6%\u20137%. Figure \nA3  shows  the  emergence  of  a  significant  output  gap  in  2009,  projected  at  about  4%  (in  the \nabsence of the fiscal stimulus), similar in magnitude to the one that emerged in the late 1980s. \nInflation is subdued, indicative of suppressed aggregate demand.  \n\n \n \nFigure A3: Output Gap and Fiscal Response \n\n (a) Potential and Actual Economic Growth, 1980\u20132009   \n\n(b) GDP Growth With and Without Fiscal Stimulus                                    \n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n1\n\n0\n\nh\n\nt\n\nw\n\no\nr\n\ng\n\nP\n\nD\n\nG\n\n3\n%\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nPotential Growth\n\nActual Growth\n\nWith Fiscal Expansion\n\nWithout Fiscal Expansion\n\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nNotes:  Viet  Nam's  potential  economic  growth  rate  is  estimated  using  the  Hodrick-Prescott  filter,  which  estimates  a \nnonlinear  trend  in  the  economic  growth  data.

In  times  of  a  negative  output  gap,  governments  may \nstimulate  the  economy  through  a  combination  of  policy  instruments  such  as  (i)  expansionary \nmonetary policy, therefore lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and consumption; and \n(ii)  fiscal  expansion  through  tax  cuts  and  increasing  discretionary  public  spending.  An \nappropriate fiscal expansion will depend on its size relative to the output gap and the multiplier \n(or second-round) effects of the different components of the fiscal stimulus. Empirical evidence \nfor  other  countries  indicates  that  infrastructure  spending  has  the  largest  multiplier  effects, \nfollowed  by  cash  transfers  to  poor  families;  tax  breaks  have  the  lowest  multiplier  effects,  as \nsome proportion will be saved. \n \nThe Government is using both instruments to stimulate the economy. In aggregate, the \n4. \nnational government budget deficit is projected at 10.3% of GDP or an expansion of 6.2% over \n2008  (budget  deficit  of  4.1%  in  2008).  Adjusting  for  budget  revenue  reductions  in  2009  over \n2008 levels, the estimated fiscal stimulus is lower at 3.2%. This expansion is equivalent to about \nthird-quarters of the negative output gap, indicating a sufficient expansion.  \n \n5. \nADB  staff  estimates  that  without  the  fiscal  stimulus,  economic  growth  could  bottom  at \nabout  2%  in  2009  and  recover  to  about  5.5%  in  2010  in  line  with  a  modest  global  economic \nrecovery. With the fiscal stimulus, economic growth is projected to pick up to 4.7% in 2009. The \nfiscal response is expected to carry over into early 2010 at a much smaller magnitude.  \n \n6. \nPoverty impacts. The economic slowdown of about 3%\u20134% of GDP in 2009 will reduce \nper  capita  income  growth  to  1.5%\u20133.5%  in  2009.  This  could  increase  poverty  in  the  short  run \nthrough a weak labor market and reduced household earnings. Over the medium term, a slow \neconomic recovery will create persistently high unemployment and suppressed earnings in the \ninformal sector, as new labor market entrants outstrip new jobs created. This in turn will lead to \nthe \npersistently  higher  poverty.  The  Government\u2019s \nunemployment  and  poverty  impacts  of  the  crisis,  but  an  economic  growth  of  about  6%\u20137%  in \n2011  is  necessary  to  ensure  a  sustained  reversal  of  the  adverse  effects  of  the  economic \nslowdown on poverty. The extension of the poverty reduction efforts in the country\u2019s 61 poorest \ndistricts  and  an  improved  social  security  system  will  also  be  important  contributors  to  a \nreduction in longer term poverty. The increased spending in social assistance programs and the \ntax relief program will have an immediate positive impact on the poor. The subsidy scheme to \nkeep business afloat during this difficult period will also have an immediate positive impact on \nthe  labor  market  and  the  incomes  of  the  poor.  The  larger  infrastructure  projects  will  affect  the \neconomy  and  create  jobs  once  the  necessary  financing  and  the  procurement  process  have \nbeen  completed  and  investments  made\u2014most  likely  in  the  second  semester  of  2009  and  in \nearly 2010. \n\nfiscal  stimulus  will  partially  offset \n\n \n\n\fPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT MATRIX \n\n \nSupport  for  the  Government\u2019s  Countercyclical  Public  Spending  Program  (CPSP).  The global economic crisis is likely to hurt the poor in the short and medium \nterm through three potential channels: (i) the weak labor market, as hiring activity across most sectors has slowed and job destruction in the traditional export sector\nhas  increased  unemployment  in  2009;  (ii)  reduction  of  employment  opportunities  caused  by  a  sharp  reduction  in  foreign  direct  investment, which  has  contributed \nsignificantly in  the recent past; and (iii) reduced household incomes caused by the  weaker economy. The Government\u2019s countercyclical public spending program is \ndesigned to mitigate the effects of the crisis on the poor through increased spending in the social sectors, scaling up key social assistance programs, and accelerating \nspending on urgent and labor-intensive infrastructure programs. \nChannel of Effect \n\nEffects on the Poor and Low-Income Groups \n\nMitigation or Enhancement \nMeasures \n\nGeneral \n\nSpecific \n\nDirect Short Term \n\nIndirect Short Term \n\nMedium Term \n\n \n\n3\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nAccess to \nEmployment  \n\nFormal and \ninformal sector \n\nA reduction in economic \ngrowth may create \npersistent unemployment as \nnew labor market entrants \noutstrip job creation \nbecause of Viet Nam\u2019s \nyoung demographic profile. \n \nThe CPSP measures for \nemployment creation are \nexpected to include \nopportunities for new labor \nmarket entrants. \n\nJob losses in the export \nsector and the \nslowdown in inflows of \nFDI and remittances  \nhave led to second-\nround effects of \nreduced consumer \nspending and therefore \nlower earnings of \nworkers in the informal \nsector. \n \nThe CPSP measures \nfor credit subsidies and \ncorporate tax deferral \nare designed to help \nemployees, including \nlower wage employees.\n\nThe collapse in exports has led to \njob losses in the export-oriented \nsector. Recent data suggest that \nabout 33% of laid-off workers in \nthe garment sector are women. \nJob losses have occurred in the \ntourism sector as well.

The Government\u2019s \nsocial welfare programs for 61 districts \nidentified as the poorest in Viet Nam, \nwith a poverty incidence close to 50% \n(more than 3.5 times the national \naverage) will provides various \nassistance to the poor. The housing \nsupport for poor families, with roughly \nhalf a million families receiving \nD7.2 million each, will also mitigate part \nof the impacts.  \n\nNet Impact  \nChannels of effect. An economic slowdown or contraction of about 3%\u20134% of GDP in 2009 will reduce per capita income growth to 1.5%\u20133.5% in 2009. This could \nincrease  poverty  in  the  short  run  through  a  weak  labor  market  and  reduced  household  earnings.  Over  the  medium  term,  a  slow  economic  recovery  will  create \npersistently high unemployment and suppressed earnings in the informal sector, as new labor market entrants outstrip new jobs created. This will lead to persistently \nhigher poverty. The Government\u2019s fiscal stimulus will partially offset the unemployment and poverty impacts of the crisis, but an economic Growth of about 6%\u20137% in \n2011 is necessary to ensure a sustained reversal of the adverse effects of the economic slowdown on poverty. The extension of the poverty reduction efforts in the \ncountry\u2019s 61 poorest districts and an improved social security system will also be important contributors to a reduction in longer term poverty.  \n \nTime  dimensions.  The  increased  spending  in  social  assistance  programs  and  tax  relief  program  will  have  an  immediate  positive  impact  on  the  poor.  The  subsidy \nscheme to keep businesses afloat during this difficult period will also have an immediate positive impact on the labor market and the incomes of the poor. The larger \ninfrastructure projects will affect the economy and create jobs once the necessary financing and procurement process have been completed and investments made\u2014\nmost likely in the second semester of 2009 and in early 2010.  \nCrucial Assumptions \nThe multiplier effects of public spending is 0.8 of the initial disbursement.

Viet  Nam\u2019s  debt  position  at  the  end  of  2008  was  estimated  at  44.4%  of \ngross domestic product (GDP), 56% of which (24.9% of GDP) is external debt. The Government \nhas been prudent in external lending. Most of the country\u2019s debt is at concessional, low interest \nrates  with  a  well  spread  out  maturity  structure.  With  support  from  multilateral  and  bilateral \ndevelopment  partners,  the  country\u2019s  debt  is  fairly  diversified  in  terms  of  currency  composition. \nDomestic  public  debt  is  also  manageable.  Its average  implied  interest  rate  at  the  end  of  2008 \nwas  about 6%.  However,  the  bulk of  amortization  will  fall  due  within  1\u20133  years.  Viet  Nam  has \nstrong  access  to  significant  non-debt-creating  financing  from  strong  private  remittances  and \nlarge foreign direct investment (FDI). \n \n2. \n \n\nMain assumptions. The baseline scenario assumes the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nReal GDP growth will average 6.5% per year during 2009\u22122013 (below the last \n10-year  historical  average  of  7.2%)  and  will  decline  gradually  thereafter  as \nViet Nam\u2019s  level  of  development  begins  to  converge  with  its  more  advanced \nneighbors.  \nInflation  will  decline  from  an  average  of  23%  in  2008  to  6%  in  2009  and  will \nremain  at  that  level  through  2013.  Inflation  will  further  decline  thereafter, \nreflecting productivity gains. \nThe average interest rate of foreign borrowing will rise gradually from around 3% \nin 2008 to above 4% by 2028, reflecting a declining share of concessional loans. \nThe  primary  fiscal  deficit  (including  off-budget  expenditure  and  net  lending)  will \nrise to 6.5% in 2009 and gradually fall to 3% of GDP in 2013, and decline further \nto 2% on average during 2014\u20132028.  \nNet  capital  inflows  will  fall  from  about  10%  of  GDP  in  2008  to  8%  in  2013  and \nstabilize thereafter. \nGovernment  financing  from  the  fiscal  stimulus  and  contingent  liabilities  are  not \nincluded in the base line scenario. \n\n \n3. \nExternal debt sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, the present value of external \ndebt  is  projected  to  increase  slightly  in  the  short  term,  but  will  decline  over  the  longer  term. \nReflecting a very open and dynamic characteristic of the economy, the present value of external \ndebt as a share of exports is low and projected to decline from 27% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2028. In \n2008, the debt service ratios in relation to exports (3.4%) and to revenue (3.5%) were low. The \ntwo  ratios  are  projected  to  decline  after  an  initial  increase.  Stress  tests  indicate  that  external \ndebt is most sensitive to exchange rate depreciation and a loss of access to non-debt-creating \nflows.  A  30%  one-time  depreciation  of  the  dong  would  increase  the  present  value  of  external \ndebt in relation to GDP by 8 percentage points relative to the baseline. A loss of access to non-\ndebt-creating  flows  will  increase  the  present  value  of  external  debt  by  3  percentage  points  by \n2013.  A  loss  of  access  to  concessional  loans  would  have  a  similar  negative  effect  but  with  a \nlonger time horizon.  \n \nPublic  debt  sustainability.  Public  debt  management  is  likely  to  be  more  challenging \n4. \nbecause of a significant deterioration in the overall fiscal balance. The present value of public \ndebt  in  relation  to  GDP  is  projected  to  rise  from  37%  in  2008  to  46%  in  2013,  and  thereafter \ngradually decline to 43% by 2028. The ratio could be higher, depending on the size of the fiscal \n\n                                                 \n1  Summarized from International Monetary Fund. 2009.

Stress tests indicate \nthat  the  present  value  of  the  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  is  most  sensitive  to  an  increase  in  debt-\ncreating flows and nominal exchange rate depreciation. A one-time 30% nominal depreciation of \nthe dong will increase the present value of public debt by 7 percentage points of GDP by 2013 \nrelative  to  the  baseline  (Figure  A5).  Similarly,  an  increase  in  debt-creating  flows  by \n10 percentage points of GDP would increase the present value of public debt by 8 percentage \npoints of GDP relative to the baseline. The stress tests underscore the need for prudent fiscal \npolicy. The debt service\u2013revenue ratio would triple or more (relative to its initial level) under the \nhigher debt-creating flows scenario and under the depreciation scenario. \n \n5. \nImplications  of  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  Loan. The loan of $500 million \nhas  a  term  of  5  years  with  a  3-year  grace  period.  Two  principal  repayments,  each  of  \n$250  million,  will  be  made  in  the  fourth  and  fifth  year,  i.e.,  2013  and  2014.  Each  repayment \nrepresents about 0.25% of GDP. As noted above, Viet Nam has a well spread out debt maturity \nstructure,  suggesting  that  in  general  the  underlying  sustainability  scenarios  will  not  be \nsignificantly impacted by the loan.  \n \n6. \nConclusion.  Viet  Nam  remains  at  low  risk  of  external  debt  distress.  The  projected \nexternal  debt  ratios  remain  well  below  normal  indicative  thresholds  even  under  the  most \nextreme of the standard shocks normally considered. Total public debt, however, is expected to \nbe adversely affected by the ongoing global economic downturn. The above results, however, \ndepend on the assumptions underlying the projections. A risk that deserves special attention is \nthe possible impact of potential Government contingent liabilities that could arise from the need \nto recapitalize some banks or to deal with problems in state-owned enterprises. The latest data \nsuggest  that  the  banking  sector  is  coping  well  with  economic  downturn,  due  to  stronger \neconomic  recovery,  rebound  in  the  construction  sector,  and  the  conservative  collateral  policy. \nProvided that the stimulus package is prudently financed and that the Government expands its \nrevenue base to more than offset the expected loss of oil revenue in the long run, the burden of \npublic debt would be manageable. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure A5: Viet Nam Debt Sensitivity Analysis for Public Debt,

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  embedded  in  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010,  which \nprovides for a broad range of policy reforms and a large number of investment projects aimed at reducing poverty. One of its \ntargets  is  to  reduce  the  poverty  rate  (based  on  the  methodology  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs)  from \n20.2%  in  2005  to  10%\u201311%  in  2010. The  SEDP  2006\u20132010  also  aspires  to  strengthen  the  foundations  for  environmentally \nsustainable and socially inclusive economic growth and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. The joint International \nDevelopment  Association\u2013International  Monetary  Fund  staff  advisory  note  of  5 December 2006  on  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poverty \nreduction strategy concluded that the SEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to \nlead to economic growth and poverty reduction.a \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  (2007\u20132010)b  for  Viet  Nam  is  aligned  with  the  SEDP  20\n2010. It provides for assistance to the Government in both carrying out the policy reforms and implementing the investment proj\nthat are needed for successful implementation of the SEDP 2006\u20132010. Its primary focus is on promoting business-led, pro-p\neconomic  growth  by  developing  infrastructure,  improving  the  business  environment,  strengthening  financial  and  related  ma\ninstitutions,  and  building  up  human  capital.  The  country  strategy  and  program  also  aims  to  foster  social  inclusiveness,  enha\nmanagement  of  the  environment,  and  improve  governance.c     The  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF)  supplements  finan\nfrom  other  ADB  programs  such  as  the  proposed  second  subprogram  of  the  Support  for  the  Implementation  of  the  Pov\nReduction Program (SIPRP), scheduled for consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in October 2009. The SIPRP supports\nGovernment\u2019s  medium-term  policy  reform  efforts  that  are  needed  for  the  successful  implementation  of  its  SEDP  2006\u201320\nincluding  in  the  areas  of  public  financial  management  and  pubic  administration,  tax  administration  reform,  investm\ncompetitiveness, natural resource management, and social protection. \n \nThe proposed VIE-CS comes at a critical time for Viet Nam and is designed to support the Government in its efforts in coping \nwith the impacts of the worst global recession since World War II.    \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nViet Nam has been severely affected by the global economic downturn because of the country\u2019s increasing dependence on \nforeign direct investment (FDI) inflows and exports to support its high economic growth rate since its successful accession to \nthe  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  January  2007.  FDI  disbursement  dropped  by  18.4  and  exports  declined  by  about \n10.2% in the first half of 2009. Remittance inflows and tourist arrivals also dropped significantly. The global financial crisis also \naffected  the  Government\u2019s  market  access  for  budget  financing.  As  a  result,  the  Government  has  not  issued  any  bond \ndomestically  since  early  2009  as  bond  yields  in  the  market  remain  significantly  higher  than  the  ceilings  set  by  the \nGovernment.  The  Government  is  concerned  about  the  potential  adverse  poverty  impacts  of  significantly  slower  economic \ngrowth. Because of the country\u2019s young demographic profile, about 1.7 million young workers enter the labor force annually. \nDuring  2006\u20132007,  with  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  averaging  7.6%,  only  about  800,000  jobs  were  created \nannually.  Since  growth  is  projected  to  decline  to  5%  or  less,  unemployment  and  underemployment  could  increase \nsignificantly. At the same time, the social security system is still in a very early stage of its development. The Government\u2019s \ncash transfer program has limited coverage, and is fraught with implementation problems. Therefore, preventing a collapse of \neconomic activities and sustaining employment are the most effective social security response. \n \n2.  Design Features  \n \nThe VIE-CS provides budget support for the Government\u2019s countercyclical public spending program in infrastructure and the \nsocial sectors. It is aimed to ensure predictability in budget financing for 2009, as a larger national government budget deficit \nis required than initially planned.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n37\n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n\nThe  VIE-CS  supports  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  public  expenditure  program  for  2009.  The  countercyclical  programs \ninclude  components  that  directly  support  the  poor  to  cope  with  the  impacts  of  the  global  crisis,  including  (i)  support  for  the \npoorest  districts,  (ii)  housing  support  for  0.5  million  rural  households,  and  (iii)  a  new  year  (Tet)  bonus  for  the  poor.  The \nGovernment  also  provides  an  interest  rate  subsidy  for  working  capital  and  medium-term  investment  loans  for  enterprises \ngiven that preventing a collapse in economic activity is critical to mitigate the social impacts of the crisis. The Government\u2019s \ncountercyclical  spending  program  also  includes  a  significant  increase  in  capital  spending  that  will  support  job  creation  to \nprevent an increase in poverty incidence. \n \n\nA. \n\nFindings of Social Analysis \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\nWhile the Government\u2019s countercyclical programs are likely to affect all population groups in Viet Nam, they are likely to have \na relatively large impact on the poor, ethnic minorities, the rural population, and people who can be adversely affected by the \nglobal  financial  crisis.  The  poverty  rate  based  on  the  methodology  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs \nsuggests  that  11.3  million  people  lived  below  the  official  poverty  line  in  2008.  According  to  the  household  survey  data, \n13.5 million people lived in poverty and 5.7 million people suffered from hunger in 2006. Rural areas accounted for 73.3% of \nthe  total  population  but  93.6%  of  the  poor.  Ethnic  minorities  made  up  only  13.5%  of  the  total  population  but  44.4%  of  the \npoor.d  Without the countercyclical programs to support economic growth at this challenging time caused by the global crisis, \npoverty incidence could increase by 1 million\u20132 million. \n \nB. \n \n1.  Provide a summary of consultations and participation during the project preparation. \n \nThe  VIE-CS  is  being  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  SIPRP  Program.  The  Viet  Nam  Development  Report  2007  provides \nanalytical  underpinnings  for  the  SIPRP  V  and,  in  particular,  its  subprogram  2.  The  report  was  jointly  prepared  by  16 \ndevelopment  agencies  (including  ADB)  in  2006.  It  analyzes  medium-term  development  challenges  facing  Viet  Nam  and \nreviews the Government\u2019s strategy for overcoming these challenges (as set out in the SEDP 2006\u20132010). It also proposes a \nset  of  policy  actions  aimed  at  successful  implementation  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Some  of  these  actions  were  covered  by \nsubprogram 1 of the SIPRP V. \n \nSubprogram  2  of  the  SIPRP  V  is  to  support  actions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  for  the  Eighth  Poverty  Reduction  Support \nCredit Program (PRSC 8), focusing on actions that complement those supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to Viet Nam \nor that are otherwise important to ADB operations in the country. In late 2008, the development agencies participating in the \nPRSC  process  (including  ADB)  agreed  among  themselves\u2014as  well  as  with  the  Government,  civil  society,  and  the  private \nsector\u2014on  the  initial  policy  matrix  for  the  PRSC  8.  From  December  2008  to  May  2009,  the  development  agencies  and  the \nGovernment held several rounds of consultations on the initial policy matrix for the PRSC 8. In May 2009, they agreed on the \nfinal  policy  matrix.  The  actions  to  be  covered  by  subprogram  2  of  the  SIPRP  were  selected\u2014in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment and various units within ADB\u2014from the actions included in the final policy matrix of the PRSC 8. \n \n2.

The  country  strategy  and  program \nalso aims to foster social inclusiveness, enhance management of the environment, and improve \ngovernance. The fifth Support for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP \nV)  operationalizes  the  country  strategy  through  a  program  cluster  consisting  of  three \nsubprograms.  The  first  of  its  subprograms,  with  a  single-tranche  loan  in  the  amount  of  about \n$25  million,  was  approved  on  1  December  2008.  The  second  subprogram  is  expected  to  be \npresented for approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in October 2009. The intended impact of the \nSIPRP  V  is  a  continued  reduction  in  poverty  in  Viet  Nam  in  2008\u20132010  and  beyond.  Its \nexpected  outcome  is  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010,2 which  will  not  only  reduce  poverty  in  2006\u20132010,  but \nalso  enhance  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  competitiveness  and  strengthen  the  foundations  for \ninclusive and sustainable growth and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. To achieve \nthis outcome, the SIPRP V is to help the Government carry out policy reforms that are needed \nfor  successful  implementation  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Specifically,  the  SIPRP  V  is  to \nsupport\u2014through  the  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credits  (PRSC)  process\u2014policy  actions  that \nare critical steps in carrying out the reforms and are important to ADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam.  \n \n2. \n \n\nThe SIPRP V supports policy actions in the following four broad reform areas: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nregulatory \n\nBusiness  development.  Improving  the  financial  management  and  corporate \ngovernance  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  developing  the  financial  and \nprivate  sectors,  and  improving  the  quality  of  infrastructure  services.  Key  policy \nactions in this area include (a) strengthening the financial management of SOEs \nand their investments in other entities, and defining the level of such investments; \n(b)  developing  a \nto  enhance  monetary  policy \nframework \nimplementation and improve financial sector stability; (c) adopting a contingency \nplan to address potential adverse effects stemming from the global financial crisis \non  the  banking  sector;  (d)  promoting  development  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  through  revising  regulations,  formulating  an  action  plan  for \nsupporting industries, and improving coordination among responsible ministries; \n(e) adopting a pricing system for electricity from renewable energy and providing \nincentives  for  government  procurement  of  energy-efficient  equipment;  and \n(f) revising  the  road  law  to  improve  traffic  safety  through  measures  including \nbetter standards and strengthened supervision of commercial vehicle operators, \nand setting up a monitoring and evaluation framework for the implementation of \ngovernment policies post-World Trade Organization accession. \n\nSocial inclusion. Improving the quality of health care and education and access \nto these services by (a) formulating an education development strategy to 2020, \n(b)  preparing  a  strategic  plan  to  ensure  prudential  and  effective  investment  of \ninstitutional \nsocial  security \n\nissuing  regulations \n\nfunds,  and  (c) \n\nto  assign \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Enhancing  governance  by:  (a)  Improving  planning  processes, \nstrengthening  public  financial  management  and  pubic  administration,  and \nreducing corruption by conducting a midterm review of the SEDP 2006\u20132010 and \nstrengthening  a  results-based  approach  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework for planning; (b) revising the investment laws to improve efficiency in \nstate  capital  expenditures  and  to  strengthen  the  management  of  public \nlaw, \ninvestment  projects; \nconsolidating  the  management  of  domestic  and  external  debt;  (d)  conducting \npublic financial management reforms, including commitment accounting, vendor \nmanagement,  and  a  new  chart  of  accounts;  (e) adopting  procedures  for  annual \naudit  plan,  ensuring  sufficient  frequency  and  adequate  provincial  coverage;  (f) \nsimplifying  the  procedures,  strengthening  the  management,  and  improving  the \nmonitoring  and  complaints  system  of  civil  judgments  execution;  (g)  adopting \nmerit-based  recruitment \nthe  recruitment,  appointment,  promotion,  and \ndismissal of civil servants; (h) developing indicators for monitoring and evaluating \nthe  implementation  of  public  administration  reform  and  provision  of  public \nadministrative services; and (i) issuing a comprehensive anticorruption strategy, \nsetting  out  preventive,  demand-side,  and  sector-specific  solutions,  and \nmonitoring mechanisms. \n\nin \n\n \n3. \nKey  features  of  the  SIPRP  V  include  the  following.  First,  it  follows  the  program-based \napproach and is, in some respects, a continuation of SIPRPs I\u2013IV. It provides parallel financing \nwith the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs within the framework of the PRSC process. Like the SIPRP IV, it \nis  intended  to  help  the  Government  carry  out  policy  reforms  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Second,  it  takes  the  program  cluster  approach \nconsisting  of  three  chronologically  ordered  subprograms  with  a  well-defined,  medium-term \nframework  specified  at  the  outset  and  including  completed  high-impact  reforms  prior  to \nconsideration  by  the  Board.  It  includes  triggers  for  subsequent  subprograms  to  ensure  a \ncontinuous dialogue between the Government, development partners, and stakeholders. Broad-\nbased,  well-targeted  policy  actions  designed  to  achieve  a  continued  reduction  in  poverty \nenhance Viet Nam\u2019s economic competitiveness and strengthen the foundations for inclusive and \nsustainable growth and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. In this way, the SIPRP V \nprovides  a  coherent  medium-term  reform  strategy  with  three  discrete  but  linked  subprograms \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nand  a  strong  emphasis  on  performance,  as  the  decision  on  whether  to  proceed  with  the  next \nsubprogram is contingent on overall satisfactory performance of the triggers. It recognizes the \nnecessity  for  flexibility  in  the  reform  measures,  with  provisions  for  incorporating  lessons  and \nresponding  to  changes  in  the  external  environment  in  the  design  of  the  subsequent \nsubprograms. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n43\n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\nFISCAL STIMULUS PACKAGES: INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE \n\n \n1. \nThis  appendix  summarizes  the  determinants  of  the  size  and  composition  of  fiscal \nstimulus packages and draws on the findings a number of recent International Monetary Fund \n(IMF)  cross-country  studies. 1 Two  sets  of  factors  help  explain  the  relative  size  of  stimulus \npackages: (i) differences across countries in the need for stimulus, and (ii) differences in fiscal \nspace. \n \nNeed  for  stimulus.  The  magnitude  of  the  overall  fiscal  expansion  (including  both \n2. \ndiscretionary  and  nondiscretionary  components)  should  depend  on  the  size  of  the  output  gap \nthat  each  country  faces  in  the  absence  of  fiscal  support.  The  fiscal  expansion  in  a  particular \ncountry should also be larger if multipliers are lower.   \n \n3. \nComposition  of  stimulus.  Fiscal  stimulus  packages  are  typically  comprised  of  (i)  tax-\nrelated measures, (ii) social sector spending, and (iii) infrastructure expenditures. However, the \nweight  given  to  any  one  of  these  components  depends  on  preexisting  fiscal  characteristics. \nCountries  in  which  the  automatic  stabilizers  are  smaller  (e.g.,  those  that  have  less  extensive \nsocial benefits programs) will require greater discretionary stimulus\u2014this is true of most of the \ncountries  in  Asia  in  relation  to  developed  economies.  Tax  stimulus  measures  can  be \nimplemented  relatively  quickly  and  their  impact  is  already  being  felt  in  the  fiscal  accounts. \nExpenditure  measures,  however,  tend  to  proceed  more  slowly,  reflecting  normal  budgetary \ncontrols and typical start-up delays in new programs. Multipliers, however, tend to be higher for \nexpenditure-related  stimulus  measures  than  for  tax-related  ones.  Figure  A10  provides  a \nbreakdown  of  the  composition  of  stimulus  packages  in  selected  Southeast  Asian  countries. \nFinally,  coordination  of  stimulus  packages  across  countries  is  crucial  to  maximizing  their \neffectivity in the context of a global crisis. \n \n4. \nDifferences  in  fiscal  space.  Key  factors  that  determine  a  country\u2019s  fiscal  space  to \nexpand include levels of deficits, public debt, contingent liabilities, and interest rates.  Countries \nfacing  relatively  higher  real  interest  rates  or  elevated  debt  levels  have  less  room  to  expand; \ncompeting crisis-related needs, such as for financial sector support (mainly in the United States \nand Europe), are also factors in determining available fiscal space. \n \n5. \nIncreasing  fiscal  space.  The  available  fiscal  space  can  be  increased  through \nappropriate policy  design.  Ideally,  a  larger  fiscal  expansion in  times  of economic  crisis  can  be \naccommodated  if  policy  design  increases  the  likelihood  of  a  fiscal  tightening  once  conditions \nimprove, to ensure long-term fiscal solvency. In this respect, the IMF has offered a number of \nrecommendations: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nStimulus  packages  should  not  have  permanent  effects  on  deficits.  Table  A10.1 \nprovides  a  cross-country  comparison  of  stimulus  packages  in  terms  of  the \npermanent or temporary nature of their fiscal impact. \nMedium-term fiscal frameworks should clarify governments\u2019 commitment to fiscal \ncorrection once economic conditions improve. \nStructural reforms should be implemented to enhance growth, and thus medium-\nterm revenue prospects. \n\n                                                 \n1  IMF. 2009.
