THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy based loan, and (ii) a proposed project loan, both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for \nthe Second Secondary Education Sector Development Program (SESDP II). \n \n2.  The SESDP II builds upon the education reforms supported by the Secondary Education \nSector Development Program (SESDP).1 It introduces new features to improve the quality and \nrelevance of secondary education, increase equitable access for disadvantaged adolescents, \nand  strengthen  education governance.2 These features  include  (i)  pedagogically  innovative \nschool  models;  (ii)  upgrading  teacher  standards;  (iii)  strengthening  science,  technology, \nengineering  and  mathematics  (STEM)  education;  (iv)  providing  locally  tailored  vocational \nguidance; (v) targeted support to emerging disadvantaged groups; and (vi) strengthening local \ndecision-making. The program\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development  problems.  Viet  Nam  has  evolved  from  one  of  the  world\u2019s  poorest \ncountries 25 years ago to a lower middle-income country with a per capita income of $2,109 in \n2015. Between 1990 and 2007, Viet Nam\u2019s average annual gross domestic product growth was \nover 7%, while from 2010 to 2015 it averaged 5.9%.3 The initial heavy reliance on export-led \ngrowth,  anchored  by  investment  in  basic  education,  yielded  the  necessary  skills  to  take \nadvantage of cheap labor to begin its transition to prosperity.  \n \n4.  Viet  Nam  now  faces  a  new  development  challenge\u2014low  competitiveness  and \nproductivity. Viet Nam\u2019s global competitiveness index has remained low: ranging from 64 in \n2006\u20132007 to 56 in 2015\u20132016.4 Levels of labor productivity in Viet Nam are low in comparison \nto other countries in the region. Productivity in Singapore in 2013 was nearly 15 times that of \nViet Nam. Viet Nam\u2019s productivity was only one-fifth that of Malaysia and two-fifths that of \nThailand.5 The World Bank\u2019s Knowledge Economy Index ranked Viet Nam 104th out of 144 \ncountries on preparedness to compete in the knowledge economy.6 To sustain growth and \nincrease competitiveness and productivity, the country needs to transition from low-skilled, \nlabor-intensive activities to those generating higher value. It requires highly skilled workers to \nrealize the full benefits associated with rapidly growing investment.7 The government forecasts a \nneed for a large increase in the number of trained persons entering the workforce. However, the \npublic school system in its present form is unable to meet the country\u2019s projected needs for \nskilled labor, and thus requires a major reform. The government particularly emphasizes the \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Secondary Education Sector Development Program. \nManila (Loans 2582 and 2583-VIE, approved on 25 November). The project was completed on 20 April 2016. \n2 The  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Second  Secondary  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Program.  \n3  General  Statistics  Office  (GSO)  of  Vietnam.  http://www.gso.gov.vn/default.aspx?tabid=622&ItemID=14774 \n(accessed 7 October 2016). \n4  The World Economic Forum. 2015.

Knowledge  Economy  Index.  http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/KEI  (accessed  24  November  \n2014). \n7  GSO data showed that between 1988 and 2010, the number of foreign investment projects in Viet Nam rose from \n37 to 1,237, and foreign registered capital reached nearly $20 billion in 2010, up from only $735 million in 1990. \n ", "2 \nneed for reforming secondary education (comprising lower secondary education grades 6 to 9 \nand  upper  secondary  education for grades  10  to  12),  which faces  the  twin  challenges  of \nproducing graduates who can immediately enter the labor market and preparing those who \ncontinue on a higher level of education.  \n \n5.  Binding  constraints.  Three  major  constraints  impede  the  secondary  education \nsystem\u2019s ability to produce a sufficient number of highly skilled graduates: (i) high academic \nachievement but low labor market relevance, (ii) inequitable access of disadvantaged groups to \nsecondary schooling, and (iii) weak secondary education management and governance.  \n \n6.  High academic achievement but low labor market relevance. While Vietnamese \nstudents demonstrated high academic performance in the 2012 Programme of International \nStudent  Assessment  (PISA),  the  current  system  of  secondary  education  does  not  equip \nstudents with the competencies needed by the labor market.8 The instructional method in Viet \nNam is still didactic and discourages creativity. The country recognizes the value of student-\ncentered teaching methods, but only selected schools have introduced it. The government \npromotes  science  and  technology  as  a  key  strategy  for  industrialization,  but  only  22%  of \nuniversity students majored in natural sciences in the SY2014/15, far fewer than students \nstudying humanities and social sciences (about 37%).9 A World Bank study on Vietnamese \nyouths\u2019 preparation for the market economy found that general education in Viet Nam has \ncontributed little to the development of cognitive skills that are critical for the workplace.10  \n \n7.  Inequitable  access  to  secondary  education.  In  2015,  about  10%  of  the  lower \nsecondary aged youth did not attend lower secondary school or equivalency programs provided \nthrough continuing education centers. Out-of-school youths are mainly girls, ethnic minorities, \nmigrants  from  rural  agricultural  areas  to  urban  or  peri-urban  poor  areas,  and  those  with \ndisabilities. While the enrollment rate for girls and ethnic minorities has improved, the youth from \ndomestic  migrant  families  and  disabled  youth  who  have  completed  primary  education  are \nmarginalized.11 A United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) survey shows that 65% of migrant \nyouth do not attend school.12 Migrant youth have limited access to the financial and academic \nsupport required to return to school. Youth with disabilities have good access to primary school, \nbut very few continue to secondary education due to a lack of instructional materials and \nprofessionally trained special education teachers. Parents lack the understanding that many \ndisabled youth can improve their employability if they complete secondary education.  \n \n8.  Weak educational governance and management. Local autonomy for management \ndecisions  has  been  a  long-standing  feature  in  Viet  Nam.  This  has  resulted  in  significant \ndifferences in performance across local governments, where there are critical gaps in access to \nand quality of education services.

For LSE, the NER for boys was 82.7% and for girls it was 85.2%, while at upper secondary education \nthe NER for boys was 58.8% and for girls it was 66.5%.  \n12S.  Cameron.  2012.

", "3 \nand  schools  are  weak.  The  government  and  development  partners  conduct  joint  public \nexpenditure reviews only for the central government\u2014no information is available on education \nbudget allocation and spending at the district and school levels. The national achievement \nmonitoring (NAM) system for secondary education collects student learning outcomes data only \nfor three core subjects and one science subject every 3 years.13 NAM results are analyzed only \nby province. Vietnamese teachers\u2019 working conditions have never been assessed relative to \ninternational  standards.  Macro  data  on  learning  outcomes  and  the  limited  information  on \nteachers does not help school principals to address the individual needs of their schools. Less \nthan 20% of schools have been accredited due to lack of trained external evaluators. The \nMinistry of Education and Training (MOET) provides management training to school principals, \nbut the training has not helped strengthen the schools\u2019 accountability mechanism.  \n \n9.  Government  sector  strategy  and  reform  agenda.  The  government\u2019s  Education \nDevelopment Strategy, 2011\u20132020 lays out the direction for education development.14 In line \nwith the long-term education strategy, Resolution No. 29 and Resolution No. 44 consolidate key \neducation policy reforms for the medium term.15 These reforms are: (i) upgraded curriculum to \nmeet learner and labor market needs, (ii) improved competencies in science and technology, \n(iii) new teaching methods to encourage learners\u2019 creativity, (iv) decentralized development of \ntextbooks  and  learning  materials,  (v)  professional  teacher  development,  (vi)  better \nunderstanding  about  career  options  and  cognitive  skills  required  in  the  workplace,  (vii) \nenhanced autonomy of schools, (viii) enhanced support for disadvantaged groups, and (ix) \nupgraded school infrastructure. The Socio-economic Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020, sees \neducation as a key driver for poverty reduction and expansion of access to social services, \nincluding vocational training and health care. Reflecting the importance given to education and \nits reform agenda, the government has increased annual spending on education and training by \nabout 130% from 2009 to 2013. In 2013, 15.9% of the government\u2019s total annual expenditure \nwas allocated to education and training.  \n \n10.  ADB experience and lessons. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is one of Viet \nNam\u2019s leading development partners in secondary education, with eight loans to the country \nsince 1996. Of five completed projects, four were evaluated as successful and one as highly \nsuccessful.16 These loans have helped Viet Nam enhance both the quality of and access to \nsecondary education. The net enrollment rate (NER) for lower secondary education (LSE) rose \nfrom about 70% in 2000 to 90% in SY2014/15. Teacher training has been upgraded and more \nthan 80% of schools have met the school standards. Three key lessons from past projects are \nreflected in the design of the SESDP II: (i) secondary education should promote students\u2019 \nemployability, (ii) numerous international pedagogical practices piloted under past projects have \nbeen  consolidated  in  the  national  reform  strategies  and  future  development  assistance  is \nexpected to align with the strategy and help fill resource gaps, and (iii) education reforms are \nmore sustained when schools are held accountable. ADB\u2019s engagement in secondary education \n                                                \n13  NAM tests mathematics, literature (reading), and English, and one of the sciences (biology, chemistry, or physics).   \n14 Government of Viet Nam. 2012.

Achievements of the previous Secondary Education Sector Development Program, \n2009-2015. The previous program helped the government achieve 10 secondary education \nreforms in 2009\u20132015. Major achievements included (i) the development of teacher standards \nand teacher assessment, (ii) improved access of ethnic minority youth to secondary education \nthrough improvement of the LSE equivalency program, and (iii) strengthened learning outcome \nassessment  by  introducing  international  measurement  through  Vietnamese  students\u2019  first \nparticipation in PISA in 2012 and the national assessment through NAM.  \n \nFigure 1.

ADB\u2019s value-added to program design and implementation. ADB has given direct \nsupport to selected reforms that underpin SESDP II through a structured policy dialogue based \non ADB\u2019s long engagement in secondary education (Figure 1). Among eight policy reforms \nunder SESDP II, four reforms build on and scale up reforms accomplished under the SESDP, \n2009-2015, and another 4 reforms are identified through implementation of other ADB-funded \nsecondary  education  projects.  Targeted  support  will  be  provided  under  SESDP  II  to  help \nunderserved groups access secondary education. The LSE equivalency program supported by \nSESDP, 2009-2015, certifies disadvantaged youth as lower secondary school graduates, which \nwill help improve their employability. SESDP II supports Viet Nam\u2019s continued participation in \nthe  PISA  2018  and  2021  and  first-time  participation  in  the  2018  Teaching  and  Learning \nInternational Survey (TALIS) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD).  SESDP  II  will  also  seek  synergy  with  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  Improving  Public \nExpenditure  Quality  Program,  which  will  help  improve  the  productivity  of  public  financial \nresource allocation. \n \n13.  Development coordination. Most of the education sector development partners focus \non primary education. ADB and the World Bank are the major contributors to the ongoing \nsecondary education reforms. Among the education reforms of Resolution No. 29 and No. 44, \nthe World Bank supports curriculum and textbook revision, and teacher training, while ADB \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020. Manila.  ", "5 \nsupports the remaining reforms. SESDPII will complement the World Bank-supported projects \nand strengthen development coordination.  \n \n14.  Sector  development  program.  Lessons  from  SESDP,  2009-2015,  show  that  a \ncombination of a policy-based loan (PBL) and a project loan is an effective instrument for \nachieving long term development impact in the Viet Nam education sector. Therefore, a sector \ndevelopment  program  (SDP)  is  proposed  for  SESDP  II.  The  PBL  component  serves  two \npurposes. First, the PBL leverages reforms in the sector and lays the foundation for effective \nimplementation of the project loan. Second, the PBL reforms have created budget obligations \nand therefore the government intends to use the loan proceeds to supplement MOET\u2019s budget. \nThe PBL comprises one single-tranche loan covered by a medium-term results framework that \nreflects a long-term engagement between ADB and the government on secondary education \nreforms. This will assist the government in creating strategic changes to develop the country\u2019s \nsecondary education to sustain the achievements of SESDP. The project loan supplements the \nsector reforms to achieve development impact. For example under the PBL, the government \nhas approved a new vocational orientation program. The project loan will help develop a tailor-\nmade vocational guidance model that is relevant to local labor market needs.  \n \n15.  Economic  impact  of  the  program.  The  three  combined  outputs  of  the  program \ncombined are expected to lead to (i) an increase in the number of young people completing \nsecondary school resulting from improved access to upper secondary education, (ii) a reduction \nin the marginal unit cost of education due to efficiencies made through governance reforms, and \n(iii)  increased  lifetime  earnings  of  those  initially  disadvantaged  as  a  result  of  completing \nsecondary school (para. 24). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The  program\u2019s  impact will  be  workforce  competitiveness,  social  equity,  and  lifelong \nlearning  opportunities  for  all  secondary  school  graduates  improved.  The  outcome  will  be \nlearning outcomes and competitiveness of secondary school graduates enhanced. The SDP \ncomprises a single tranche PBL with 20 policy actions completed between July 2014 and June \n2016 and a project investment loan.   \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n17.  Output 1: Quality and relevance of secondary education improved. The PBL has \nsupported  the  government\u2019s  reform  of  the  secondary  schools  to  be  pedagogically  more \ninnovative  and  labor  market-responsive.  The  government  has  launched  model  resource \nsecondary  schools,  which  introduce  student-centered  teaching  methods  and  upgraded \ninstructional  materials.  Teacher  standards  developed  under  SESDP  have  been  revised  to \ncapture teacher competencies to implement the new curriculum. STEM education in specialized \nschools has been upgraded through improved teacher training and materials. The vocational \norientation program at secondary schools has been strengthened. It will provide students with \nup-to-date knowledge about available jobs and qualifications. Cognitive skills that are required \nto successfully enter the labor market will be enhanced through upgraded vocational guidance. \nThe project loan will support (i) materials and in-country staff training, (ii) a revised teacher \nassessment  system,  (iii)  an  upgraded  STEM  program  using  active  learning  methods,  (iv) \nequipment  for  the  model  resource  schools,  and  (v)  development  of  vocational  orientation \nprograms, which target local labor market needs and include private sector outreach programs. \n ", "6 \n18.  Output  2:  Equity  of  access  to  secondary  education  enhanced.  The  PBL  has \nsupported school financing reforms to meet the government\u2019s long-term policy targets of 95% \nLSE (NER). The government has issued new direction on school fee reduction, exemption, and \nsupport. Youth from poor migrant families are one of the major beneficiaries of the revised \nschool fee system. Several policy measures to increase access to secondary schools for youth \nwith disabilities have been taken. MOET has upgraded continuing education centers to better \nmeet the special needs of disabled youth. This has incentivized parents of disabled children to \nsend them to secondary schools. The project loan will support (i) a survey on the education \nsituation of domestic migrant youth to develop an action plan to address critical impediments for \nthese  youths,  (ii)  instructional  materials  targeting  migrant  youth,  (iii)  training  for  education \nmanagers and school principals to develop strategies to expand education for disadvantaged \nyouth, (iv) information sharing among local governments in regions where the domestic migrant \nissue is most acute, (v) professional development for teachers focused on youth with special \nneeds, and (vi) provision of adaptive learning materials for disabled students. \n \n19.  Output 3: Educational governance and management strengthened. The PBL has \nsupported government policy to enhance the efficiency of decentralized education management \nthrough an improved financial allocation model and strengthened local decision-making. MOET \nhas adopted a three-phase approach: (i) evaluate progress in decentralization and redefine the \nrole and function of local education authorities; (ii) review annual financial plans to improve the \neffectiveness of resource utilization; and (iii) develop a mechanism to promote autonomy of \npublic institutions, including schools, and delegate more decision-making authority. The OECD \npolicy recommendations based on the PISA 2015 have been adopted in the new curriculum, \ntextbooks,  and  teaching  methods.  The  project  loan  will  finance  both  PISA  and  TALIS \nparticipation.18 It will support the implementation and scaling up of the NAM in schools involved \nin the new mechanism for school-based decision-making. Other support will include (i) public \nexpenditure review at district and school levels, (ii) the accreditation of secondary schools, (iii) \nfees for  PISA  and TALIS  registration,  (iv)  equipment for  the TALIS  office,  and (v)  school \naccreditor training.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n20.  Overall program financing. The program is estimated to cost $107 million. ADB will \nprovide a PBL of SDR35,709,000.00 and a project loan of SDR35,709,000.00. Both are from \nthe Asian Development Fund. The government will provide counterpart funding of $7 million \nfrom its central budget.

The  PBL  will  be  disbursed  upon  loan \neffectiveness in a single tranche. In 2016, the government will borrow $20.2 billion to cover a \nbudget deficit of 5.0% of gross domestic product with a $4.9 billion to be mobilized from official \ndevelopment assistance to fill the financing gap. The proceeds of the PBL will help implement \nthe reform actions facilitated by the project loan nationwide and reflect the strength of the \ngovernment reform program as highlighted by the implementation costs. The PBL proceed will \nsupplement the MOET\u2019s budget to cover their reform programs.  \n \n22.  Project  investment  plan. The government has requested a project loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR35,709,000.00  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nfinance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft project loan agreement. The project loan will cover the base \ncosts  of  the  project  activities  including  staff  training,  equipment  provision,  research,  and \nconsulting services, physical and price contingencies, and interest and other charges during \nimplementation.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic. The program (policy based and investment project components) will have \npositive  economy-wide  impacts.  The  program  impact  assessment  estimates  the  potential \nquantifiable net benefits of the program at $33.0 million, net present value (NPV) at 12%, under \nconservative discounting assumptions, which well exceed the program\u2019s costs.20 The benefits \ncomprise  additional  lifetime  earnings  of  disadvantaged  groups  arising  from  completing \nsecondary education. The program assumes net enrolment rate (NER) of lower secondary \neducation students will increase from 90% to 95% and upper secondary education will increase \nby 20 percentage points. The reforms will result in investment economic benefits, NPV at 12%, \nof $2.245 billion and will entail economic costs, NPV at 12%, of $1.978 billion arising from new \ncapital and recurrent expenditures arising from the reforms. The program\u2019s economic internal \nrate of return is estimated at 14.7%.  The sensitivity analysis indicated the economic internal rate \nof return is sensitive to changes in costs and enrollment.  \n \n25.  Financial.  The  fiscal  impact  analysis  confirmed  that  the  government  has  adequate \nfinancial resources and will be able to fulfill all its financial obligations under the program as total \nprogram costs are observed to be significantly less than 0.1% of total annual government \nexpenditure. The financial sustainability analysis showed that the government, as the borrower, \nhas a strong capacity to cover both annual operation and maintenance costs and debt service \nrequirements beyond the program implementation period as these are likewise significantly below \n0.1% as a portion of total government annual expenditure. \n \n                                                \n20 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  Financial management assessment and procurement capacity assessment. The \nfinancial  management  assessment  rates  the  financial  management  capacity  of  MOET  as \nsatisfactory and concludes that the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is low. \nMOET\u2019s departments of secondary education and planning and finance have been involved in \nnumerous successfully implemented ADB-funded projects.21 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOET. The \nspecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project \nadministration  manual.  The  procurement  capacity  of  the  MOET  and  the  central  program \nmanagement unit (CPMU) was assessed.22 The pre-mitigation procurement management risk is \ndeemed moderate. The risk assessment and risk management plan will mitigate risks through (i) \nadvance action for early recruitment of consulting services to build capacity in procurement and \ngood  governance,  (ii)  recruitment  of  qualified  CPMU  staff,  (iii)  development  of  a  financial \nmanagement manual, and (iv) CPMU staff training. Procurements were streamlined to promote \ncompetition and reduce governance risks associated with large numbers of small packages. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The program\u2019s second output particularly addresses domestic migrants and youth with \ndisabilities. The program is expected to increase enrollment by about 278,500 lower secondary \nstudents  and  about  949,000  upper  secondary  students,  plus  another  2,000  youths  with  a \ndisability. The program has a gender equity theme and includes a gender analysis and gender \naction plan (GAP).23 The GAP will ensure that (i) equal numbers of women and men attend \nmajor workshops that are gender-responsive, (ii) program materials are gender- ethnicity- and \ndisability-sensitive, (iii) major surveys disaggregate data by sex and by ethnicity, (iv) training to \npromote STEM encourages more female students to study these subjects, (v) the action plan to \nimprove education access of domestic migrant youth includes gender- and ethnicity-responsive \nindicators, (vi) NAM development will include strategies to avoid gender and ethnicity bias, and \n(vii) GAP progress updates will be reported to ADB semiannually.   \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n28.  The  program  does  not  include  any  civil  works.  The  program  is  categorized  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and the environment as both project loan and \nPBL will not have any potential impact on involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and \nenvironment. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  The overall benefits and impact are expected to outweigh the risks involved. Major risks \nand  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and management plan.24 \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2008.
