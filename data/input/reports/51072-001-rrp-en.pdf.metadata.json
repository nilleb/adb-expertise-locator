The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is an existing investor in \nOrbiMed Asia Partners II, LP Fund (OAP II), having committed $60 million to the $325 million fund \nin  2014.1 OAP  II  is  managed  by  the  Asian  affiliate  of  New  York-based  OrbiMed  Advisors  LLC \n(OrbiMed), the world\u2019s largest investment firm dedicated to health care, managing over $14 billion \nin net assets and investing over $3 billion in private and public health care companies globally as \nof  31  March  2017.  OAP  II\u2019s  concept  was  driven  by  a  2011  cross-division  regional  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) project spearheaded by the Private Sector Infrastructure \nFinance  Division  1  and  the  Private  Sector  Investment  Funds  and  Special  Initiatives  Division \n(PSIS) of ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD). The TA\u2019s goal was to examine \nthe feasibility of establishing a private equity fund that would target investment opportunities that \ncould commercialize affordable and accessible health care for  Asia\u2019s  underserved  populations \nand thereby raise the level of PSOD\u2019s health care interventions. The TA, led by global consulting \nfirm McKinsey & Company, ultimately concluded that a successful health-focused private equity \nfund with a diversified investment portfolio of both therapeutic and nontherapeutic assets would \nbe best positioned to achieve this mandate. Subsequently, PSOD selected OrbiMed from a pool \nof 11 fund managers as being the most capable of establishing and managing an Asia-focused \nhealth care private equity fund based on its global platform, investment and operating experience \nin health care, and team depth and expertise. \n \nADB\u2019s proposed investment in OAP III is a continuation of its strategy to increase the pace \n3. \nof PSOD investments in health care, as well as an endorsement of OrbiMed as the preferred fund \nmanager  given  its  track  record  and  competitive  positioning  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC)  and India,  two of  Asia\u2019s  fastest growing  health care markets. OrbiMed\u2019s  Asia  team  has \nsuccessfully  deployed  capital  across  36  portfolio  companies  through  two  funds,  OrbiMed  Asia \nPartners I, LP Fund (OAP I) and OAP II with respectable exits from OAP I.2 As a demonstration \nof its origination skills and recognition of ADB as a value-adding partner, OrbiMed has also offered \nco-investment  opportunities  to  PSOD,  including  two  hospitals  in  India  and  a  third  hospital \nopportunity currently being explored in the PRC. \n \n4. \nAs part of OAP III\u2019s vetting process, PSIS\u2019s market-mapping exercise of health care funds \nin the region indicated that only a few Asia-focused health care private equity funds are directly \ncomparable to OrbiMed\u2019s Asia funds in terms of investment mandate and localized investment \nteams. Most health care funds are single-country, venture capital funds targeting early-stage (pre-\nprofit  and  sometimes  pre-revenue)  companies,  or  regional  platforms  with  multisector \nconcentration  (and  therefore  lacking  health  care  specialization).  OrbiMed\u2019s  benchmark  Asian \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Equity Investment in \n\nOrbiMed Asia Partners II, LP Fund. Manila. \n\n2 \u201cExits\u201d refer to the sale of investments by private equity funds. In general, a private equity fund spend the first three \nto six years of the fund\u2019s life investing into portfolio companies and the subsequent six to seven years selling off \nthose investments. Therefore private equity funds of less than seven years old may have little to no exits. As of 30 \nApril 2017, OAP I, which was started in 2008, have sold investments and received about 90% of the fund\u2019s aggregate \ncommitments.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\npeers were selected under these constraints, and initially included 10 private equity firms, of which \nfour were PRC-focused, one was India-focused, and five were regional platforms. From these 10 \nfirms, two were shortlisted based on the quality of their management teams, investment strategy \nand experience, alignment with ADB\u2019s mandate, performance track record, and platform  depth \nand  reputation,  of  which  OrbiMed  ranked  at  the  top.  Hence  the  PSIS  team  felt  comfortable \nreinvesting in the platform through the proposed investment in OAP III. \n \n5. \nDescription. OAP III is a closed-end private equity fund with a target capitalization of $500 \nmillion. OAP III will be  managed by its general partner OrbiMed Asia GP III, LP, an exempted \nlimited  partnership  registered  in  the  Cayman  Islands  and  affiliated  with  the  global  health  care \nasset manager OrbiMed Advisors LLC.3 \n \nB. \n \n6. \nOrbiMed\u2019s investment strategy for OAP III is similar to that for OAP II. Therefore, OAP III \nwill continue to focus its investment activity on companies that benefit from three primary drivers \nwhich, according to OrbiMed\u2019s in-depth market research, are creating compelling opportunities \nfor private equity investors in Asia: (i) improving affordability and quality in the delivery of health \ncare  products  and  services,  particularly  for  the  largely  underserved  Asian  consumers; \n(ii) increasing efficiency in the accessibility and use of health care services outside of major urban \ncities  in Asia;  and (iii)  leveraging  Asia\u2019s  cost  advantage and  local  strengths for the region  and \nglobally.4 \n \n7. \nSpecifically, OAP III aims to make equity and equity-linked investments (with a deal size \nof $20 million\u2013$30 million) in 15\u201320 health care companies operating (or with proposed significant \nbusiness activities) in the PRC (55%\u201365% of the portfolio) and India (30%\u201340%), with a small \nopportunistic allocation to Southeast Asia (0%\u201310%). These companies will be selected based \non the following criteria: (i) experienced management teams with execution skills and a proven \nrecord  of  building  successful  businesses;  (ii)  differentiated  market  leaders  with  well-defined \nbusiness plans, sound financials, and ability to deploy capital in a cost-effective manner; (iii) focus \non improving health care affordability, access, or quality to address unmet medical needs in large \nconsumer  populations;  (iv)  valuations  that  can  be  justified  as  attractive  relative  to  OrbiMed\u2019s \nassessment  of  the  company\u2019s  intrinsic  value  and  valuations  of  comparable  private  or  public \ncompanies;  and  (v)  willingness  to  negotiate  risk-mitigating  deal  terms  such  as  minimum \nguaranteed  internal  rates  of  return  (IRRs),  anti-dilution  provisions,  liquidated  preferences, \nredemption provisions, milestone-based investments, dividends, and warrants. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nOwnership. OAP III is an exempted limited partnership registered in the Cayman Islands, \nwhich, like OAP II, is expected to comprise strategic investors, institutional investors, foundations, \nendowments, and family offices. [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions \nto disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \nManagement. The general partner is affiliated with and receives advisory services from \n9. \nOrbiMed, a limited liability company registered in Delaware. [This information has been removed \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n                                                \n3  Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  While the general partner has discretion to invest in listed and/or secondary capital, this is not envisaged to be the \n\nfocus of OAP III\u2019s investment strategy. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nas  it  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure  specified  in  paragraph  97(viii)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications  Policy  (2011)]. 5  OrbiMed\u2019s  team  includes  more  than  80  multidisciplinary \nprofessionals  with  expertise  in  health  care,  biomedical  science,  finance,  and  law,  of  whom  25 \nhave  doctor  of  philosophy  or  doctor  of  medicine  degrees,  and  16  formerly  served  as  chief \nexecutive officers or founders of health care companies. OrbiMed is a financial advisor registered \nwith the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. \n \n10.  Within  Asia,  OrbiMed  has  committed  over  $500  million  through  two  funds  into \n36 investments since 2008, primarily in the PRC and India. OrbiMed\u2019s Asia team is supported by \n13 investment professionals led by senior managing directors Jonathan Wang and David Wang \nin  Shanghai  and  Sunny  Sharma  in  Mumbai.  The  three  senior  managing  directors  will  jointly \nmanage OAP III and will sit on the fund\u2019s investment committee. The investment committee will \nalso include the two co-heads of OrbiMed\u2019s global private equity team, Carl Gordon and Jonathan \nSilverstein,  who  are  based  in  New  York.  OAP  III  will  generally  act  as  the  lead  investor  in  its \ntransactions  with  representation  on  the  board  of  directors  of  investee  companies  to  provide \nstrategic and operational guidance. OrbiMed has held at least one board seat for the significant \nmajority of investments in the OAP I and OAP II portfolios. In some cases, OrbiMed professionals \nhave become active management team members of portfolio companies. For example, Guo Liang \nYu, a venture partner within OrbiMed\u2019s Asia team, served as executive chairman of OAP I portfolio \ncompany Crown Bioscience. In addition to the Asia team members\u2019 own extensive local networks \nin  biomedical  science,  health  care,  and  private  equity,  as  well  as  with  regulatory  bodies,  the \nOrbiMed Asia team is able to leverage the resources and expertise of OrbiMed\u2019s global platform, \nwhich includes the public equity, global private equity, and royalty investment teams; and other \nprofessionals across finance, legal, compliance, trading, and information technology. \n \n11. \nADB has reviewed OAP III and its management structure from an integrity perspective, \nincluding  its  policies and procedures  on  combating money  laundering  and conducting  integrity \ndue diligence at both investor and portfolio company levels. ADB\u2019s integrity review does not give \nADB  cause to  believe that  OAP  III  has  been  established  or  is  being used for  cross-border  tax \nevasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the investment.6 \n \n12. \nGovernance structure. The general partner will follow a three-stage investment process \nbased on an approach developed and refined by OrbiMed over a 24-year period of investing in \nhealth care: (i) investment screening of each potential portfolio company\u2019s operations, products, \nmarket opportunities, and evaluation against OAP III\u2019s mandate and strategy; (ii) deal structuring \nand  due  diligence;  and  (iii)  preparation  of  investment  proposals  for  presentation  to  OAP  III\u2019s \ninvestment committee. \n \n13. \nOnce  an  investment  is  made,  the  OrbiMed  team  will  assist  portfolio  companies  with \nstrategic and operational objectives. As mentioned in para. 10, a key competitive advantage of \nOrbiMed\u2019s  Asia  funds  over  other  Asia-only  generalist  firms  is  the  ability  to  tap  into  OrbiMed\u2019s \nglobal  network  of  private  and  publicly  traded  health  care  companies.  The  general  partner \nleverages these relationships to drive many facets of growth for portfolio companies, including \nbusiness development, product licensing opportunities, and mergers and acquisitions. The team \n\n                                                \n5  [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s \n\nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. \n\n6  Ownership,  Management,  and  Governance  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The \n\ndocument has a section on integrity due diligence, including tax integrity due diligence. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nmembers  draw  upon  their  decades  of  collective  operation  and  management  experience  as \nentrepreneurs or board members to help portfolio companies achieve strong growth. \n \n14. \nIn addition to the investment committee, OAP III has an advisory committee of up to seven \nmembers  representing  the  fund\u2019s  limited  partners.  ADB  will  be  represented  on  the  advisory \ncommittee.7 \n \nD. \n \n15. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nFinancial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n\n \nA. \n \nADB will provide an equity investment of up to $60,000,000 in OAP III, but not exceeding \n16. \n25%  of  OAP  III\u2019s  total  capital  commitment  and  not  resulting  in  ADB  being  the  single  largest \ninvestor in OAP III. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nThe general partner has indicated that it aims to achieve a target gross IRR for OAP III of \n20% in United States dollar terms. [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions \nto disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \nC. \n \nExit strategy. OAP III has a 10-year term from final closing, with two options to extend for \n18. \na maximum of 1 year each at the discretion of the general partner. Thereafter, the fund life may \nbe extended by up to two additional 1-year periods with the consent of the advisory committee \n(which will include ADB) to allow for orderly liquidation of the fund. The anticipated exit strategies \nfor OAP III\u2019s investments include public offerings on Asian exchanges or global stock markets, \ntrade sales of portfolio companies to local and foreign strategic buyers, and secondary sales to \nother private equity funds. \n \nReporting  arrangements.  The  general  partner  must  provide  ADB  with  unaudited \n19. \nquarterly  reports,  audited  annual  reports  with  financial  statements,  a  fund  overview,  annual \ndevelopment  effectiveness  monitoring  reports,  and  an  overview  of  the  portfolio  with  summary \ninformation on each portfolio company\u2019s performance. ADB will review this information and follow \nup with the general partner if more information or clarification is needed. If the information received \nfrom the general partner raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in OAP III, \nADB could decide to put OAP III on a watch list for more frequent and detailed review. \n \nAs with OAP II, the general partner must adopt an environmental and social management \n20. \nsystem  (ESMS)  acceptable  to  ADB  before  the  first  disbursement,  and  report  annually  on \nenvironmental and social safeguard issues. ADB will monitor the timing and quality of the ESMS \n\n                                                \n7  [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s \n\nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. \n\n\f5 \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nreports  and  offer  guidance  if  the  general  partner  requires  clarification  on  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nAnchor  investor.  OrbiMed  continues  to  see  robust  health  care  deal  flows  in  Asia, \nparticularly in the PRC and India. As a result, the general partner is targeting a larger fund size of \nup to $500 million for OAP III relative to OAP II to enable the fund to deploy capital at scale and \nexecute  its  strategy  of  taking  significant  minority  stakes  in  portfolio  companies  as  the  lead \ninvestor. In reaching the $500 million target, the general partner intends to maintain a diversified, \nwell-balanced institutional investor base. As such, OrbiMed is seeking ADB\u2019s continued support \nas its Asia-based anchor investor, since it values ADB\u2019s platform and network across the region. \nADB\u2019s commitment of up to $60 million will help OAP III reach its target size, while validating the \nsocial and development impact as well as strong financial return prospects. \n \n22. \nRaising standards. ADB\u2019s presence as a major investor in OAP III obligates the general \npartner to continue to adopt an ESMS acceptable to ADB and report on development indicators. \nADB\u2019s role, along with other OAP III advisory committee members, will be to assist in providing \noversight  on  governance  matters  that  are  essential  for  investee  companies  to  demonstrate  as \nthey seek additional sources of growth capital from institutional and/or individual investors. \n \n23. \nCofinancing opportunities. OrbiMed values ADB\u2019s ability to provide both debt and equity \nfinancing directly to its portfolio companies to help them grow. In addition to providing capital from \nits own balance sheet, ADB can potentially mobilize additional financing from third-party sources, \nas well as make available TA funding as required. \n \nE. \n \n24. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n25. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n26. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\nRisks \n\n \n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n27. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n28. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n29. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)].) \n \n30. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \nA. \n \nImpacts. The proposed investment is expected to increase private equity funding in Asia\u2019s \n31. \nhealth care subsector, particularly in the PRC and India. The success of OAP III is expected to \ncatalyze  additional  health-focused  investments  in  these  countries  through  private  equity.  The \nproposed investment is also expected to improve access to and the affordability of health care \ngoods and services in the PRC and India. \n \n32. \nOutcome.  The  proposed  investment  will  demonstrate  the  sustainability  of  innovative \nhealth  care  companies  in  target  markets.  At  the  conclusion  of  this  transaction,  OAP  III  is \nenvisaged to fully exit its investment portfolio at a minimum net IRR of 5%, with at least 70% of \nthe investee companies demonstrating some measurable improvement in the quality and delivery \nof health care goods and services, including improved access channels for the poor. \n \nOutputs.  The  outputs  will  be  that  (i)  OAP  III  is  established  and  (ii)  OAP  III\u2019s  capital  is \n33. \ninvested.  OAP  III  is  expected  to  have  its  final  closing  by  the  first  quarter  of  2018  and  to \nsuccessfully deploy its committed capital to 15\u201320 companies by the end of the 6-year investment \nperiod. \n \nB. \n \n34. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  proposed  investment \nsupports  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  in  two  areas:  finance  sector  development  and  the \nhealth sector. ADB\u2019s assistance is an equity commitment into one of the largest pan-Asia, non-\ncaptive, private equity funds focused on health care investments. It therefore aligns with Strategy \n2020\u2019s efforts to develop financial infrastructure and products. The assistance supports a sector \nthat ADB recognizes as \u201cvital to development, productivity, social inclusion, and gender equity.\u201d8 \n \n35. \nOAP III aligns with the country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC in that it will \nenhance finance sector infrastructure and support commercially viable business models in social \ndevelopment, including health.9 OAP III will also contribute to the comprehensive health approach \nin the country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India, which undertakes to invest in physical \nand social infrastructure sectors such as health.10 \n \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The Operational Plan \n36. \nfor Health, 2015\u20132020 strongly supports private sector approaches to address quality, efficiency, \nand  financing  issues  in  the  health  sector.11 By  investing  in  OAP  III,  ADB  is  partnering  with  a \nleading  health  care  investment  manager  in  Asia  to  improve  the  quality,  efficiency,  and  cost-\neffectiveness  of  health  products,  services,  and  delivery  modalities,  particularly  for  the \nunderserved populations in tier 2, 3, and 4 cities in the PRC and India.

OAP III\u2019s business \nactivities are not expected to entail impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \nThey are expected to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts and will be classified \ncategory B for the environment. OAP III will establish an ESMS prior to ADB\u2019s first disbursement \nin  compliance  with  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  requirements  for  category  FI \ninvestments,  which  sets  out  screening,  assessment,  reporting,  and  other  requirements,  as \napplicable, for investments using ADB funds. OAP III\u2019s nature, type, and operations of business \nare the same as OAP II's.  \n \n38. \nOAP II\u2019s ESMS will be updated and adopted for implementation in OAP III. The updates \nare positive changes, which are now being implemented, such as the inclusion of environment \ncategory C subprojects in the due diligence activity and in the annual monitoring report. OAP III \nwill have the same environmental and social safeguard team as OAP II, which will continue to \noversee and monitor ESMS implementation at the regional (Shanghai and Mumbai) level down \nto investee company level. The ESMS requires OAP III\u2019s environmental and social safeguards \nteam  to  screen  potential  new  investments  against  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list, \ndetermine  the  environmental  and  social  safeguard  categorization,  conduct  due  diligence,  and \nmonitor and report on investee companies\u2019 compliance with the applicable requirements of the \nESMS for the duration of the investment.  \n\n \n\n39.

OrbiMed has also assigned environmental and social focal persons\u2014one in India and one \nin  the  PRC  regional  office.  The  environmental  and  social  safeguard  team  processed  and \napproved 19 transactions during its investment period from  2014 to 2017. Out of 19 approved \ntransactions, 13 are in the PRC and 6 are in India. \n \n40. \nThe ESMS sets out requirements for compliance, as applicable, with national labor laws \nand  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001).
