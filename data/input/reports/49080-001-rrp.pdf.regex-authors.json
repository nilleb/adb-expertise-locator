THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (A loan); and  \n(ii)  a  proposed  loan  funded  through  the  ASEAN  Infrastructure  Fund  (B  loan),  both  to \nPerusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the State Electricity Corporation, to be guaranteed by the \nRepublic of Indonesia, for the Electricity Grid Strengthening\u2014Sumatra Program.1 \n \n2.  As the first of a series of investment programs, the program adopts a programmatic \napproach, which may be replicated across other regions in the country. In total, the programs \naim to improve the reliability and stability of the country\u2019s electricity transmission and distribution \nsystems,  and  enable  the  expansion  of  power  generation  capacity  as  envisioned  in  PLN\u2019s \nElectricity Power Supply Business Plan (RUPTL), 2015\u20132024. The program also addresses a \nkey priority of the government\u2019s National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN), 2015\u2013\n2019 to expand nationwide access to affordable and reliable supplies of electricity. It builds on \nADB\u2019s extensive experience in Indonesia\u2019s power subsector.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Indonesia\u2019s gross domestic product growth averaged 5.8% during 2010\u20132014; per capita \nincome  was  $3,492  in  2014.  During  2015\u20132019,  the  government  seeks  to  significantly \naccelerate economic growth to reduce income inequality and reduce poverty.2 It has prioritized \ninfrastructure development, especially for the power subsector, as a key measure that will help \nfoster improved connectivity and promote inclusive growth to increase incomes and reduce \npoverty. \n \n4.  Expansion in the power subsector has not kept up with increased power demand and \nsince 2010, demand has averaged about 8%. Generation capacity additions have been delayed, \nand  underinvestment  and  infrastructure  deficits  extend  to  the transmission  and  distribution \nsystems.  Power  system  stability  and  reliability  indexes  indicate  deteriorating  trends,  and \nSumatra and Java recently experienced blackouts. All of this severely constrains the country\u2019s \nability to provide for growth in industrial and commercial power demand. Indonesia continues to \nlag its regional peers in terms of access to electricity for its citizens. Increasing the electrification \nrate from the current 84% to nearly universal coverage will require substantial investment in \ntransmission and distribution systems, along with associated generation capacity. \n \n5.  The government recognizes that business-as-usual will not lead to increased access to \nreliable and cost-effective supplies of electricity. PLN, a vertically integrated utility, dominates \nthe country\u2019s power subsector. It owns and manages almost 75% of the total power generation; \nthe remainder is owned and managed by independent power producers and captive generation. \nPLN  owns  and  operates  about  39,900  circuit-kilometers  (ckm)  of  transmission  lines,  and \n925,300 ckm of distribution lines. PLN, under the guidance of the government, has outlined an \naggressive expansion program for power. Its latest power development plan (RUPTL, 2015\u2013\n2024) estimates that an additional 70 gigawatts (GW) of new generation capacity is required. \nPLN  and  the government  are  to finance  at  least  21 GW of the  new  generation,  and the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  In 2014, about 11.3% of the population was considered to be living below the poverty line. ", "2 \n \nassociated transmission and distribution infrastructure; the private sector is expected to develop \nabout 36 GW.3 The expansion includes 60,000 ckm of new transmission lines and 304,000 ckm \nof distribution lines, along with grid rehabilitation and strengthening. The overall 2015\u20122024 \nexpansion program is expected to cost $132 billion. \n \n6.  In the medium-term, during the first 5 years of the RUPTL, 2015\u20132024 and during the \nterm of the RPJMN, 2015\u20122019, PLN plans to install 42 GW of the 70 GW to achieve an \nelectrification  ratio  of  97.4%.4 This  medium-term  program  requires  $83.1  billion,  of  which  \n$43.0 billion is to be financed by independent power producers. PLN is to finance the balance of \n$40.1  billion,  including  $15.6  billion  for  generation  and  $24.5  billion  for  electricity  grid \nrehabilitation and strengthening, and the development of new transmission and distribution \ninfrastructure.  PLN\u2019s  current  estimates  put  the  financing  gap  at  $30  billion  for  the  5-year \nprogram. \n \n7.  The government has taken several measures to strengthen PLN\u2019s ability to undertake \nthis planned expansion, and to improve the investment climate for the private sector. In 2014, \nthe government increased electricity tariffs, and in 2015 instituted tariffs based on cost recovery \nand  automatic  price  adjustment  for  all  but  the  poorest  households.  Further,  in  2015  it  is \nproviding nearly $500 million in equity injections to PLN, and budgeted $1 billion for 2016. It is \nalso seeking to move away from regulating PLN on a cost-plus-margin-based approach to one \nbased on performance. This is intended to improve PLN\u2019s financial status and its ability to raise \ndebt. The government recently passed regulations that will allow PLN to borrow directly from \nbilateral and multilateral agencies against a sovereign-backed guarantee. \n  \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n8.  During 2015\u20122024, the nationwide electricity transmission and distribution systems will \nrequire an estimated $35 billion in public funding channeled through PLN. A significant portion \nof this investment will focus on reconductoring existing transmission lines to improve capacity \nand efficiency, expansion and reinforcement of medium-voltage and low-voltage networks, and \nexpansion of customer connections. This expansion is best implemented using a programmatic \napproach  involving  standardized  equipment  and  bulk  procurement,  wherein  implementation \nplans  and  approaches  used  in  one  context  can  be  replicated  across  regions.  Along  with \ninvestments in new high-voltage transmission lines, these investments will help transmit and \ndistribute power from existing and new power plants. It thus complements the generation and \nlong-distance transmission system investments carried out by PLN and other development \npartners. \n \n9.  PLN has selected the Sumatra region for the proposed investment program. This is well \naligned with the government\u2019s vision for the region to make an increasingly larger contribution to \nthe country\u2019s gross domestic product and become the next industrial center after Java. Sumatra \nhas an electrification ratio of 84.5% and a population of 54 million, of which 9 million do not have \naccess to electricity. PLN estimates that Sumatra requires at least $21 billion in investments \nduring 2015\u20122019 for generation, transmission, and distribution. By 2019, PLN is targeting an \nadditional 9 GW of generation, total installed generation capacity of 15 GW, and 2.85 million \nnew customers connected. A focus on Sumatra sets the stage for achieving the objectives of \nthe RUPTL, 2015\u20122024 and the RPJMN, 2015\u20132019. \n                                                \n3  About 13.5 GW of the new generation is classified as \u201cunallocated.\u201d \n4  This includes about 7 GW of capacity that is currently under construction. \n ", "3 \n10.  ADB\u2019s results-based lending (RBL) is the most appropriate modality for supporting PLN\u2019s \nelectricity grid strengthening program, starting with Sumatra. Strengthening the electricity grid \ninvolves many relatively small-scale, discrete activities and expenditures. This is best supported \nusing the RBL approach, where the focus is not on inputs but on delivery of specific and \nmeasurable  results  through  effective  strategic  planning,  systems  strengthening,  optimal \nresource allocation, systematic implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). It also \nhelps lower transaction costs for PLN, and helps ADB to rely on and strengthen PLN practices, \nsystems,  and  institutional  capacity.  Moreover,  the  RBL  approach  encourages  other \ndevelopment partners to join the program. The World Bank will provide financing of $500 million \nfor Sumatra using its program-for-results modality, which is similar to the RBL. ADB and the \nWorld  Bank  have  coordinated  their  due  diligence  assessments  and  have  harmonized  key \ndisbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) to support a common results framework for the program. \n \n11.  The program is part of a larger medium-term package of ADB support for strengthening \nIndonesia\u2019s electricity grid. RBLs are planned for Java\u2013Bali and the Eastern Indonesia regions \nin 2016\u20132019. Further, the program complements the broader policy reform support being \nprovided  by  the  policy-based  loan  series\u2014Sustainable  and  Inclusive  Energy  Program\u2014\ncomprising three subprograms during 2015\u20122019, and strategic project investments in gas-fired \npower generation and renewable energy power plants being planned during the same period. \nThe program is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for Indonesia \nand aligned with the priorities outlined in the interim country partnership strategy, 2015.5 Overall, \nADB is seeking to provide nearly $4 billion in financing to Indonesia\u2019s energy sector during \n2015\u20132019. \n \n12.  The  program  design  incorporates  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  4  decades  of  experience  in \nIndonesia\u2019s energy sector. It allows for larger, flexible, and programmatic financing for the sector \nwith an emphasis on results. This approach provides ADB with the opportunity to collaborate \nwith a large utility in a middle-income country, and use its financing leverage to improve the \neffectiveness and efficiency of PLN\u2019s entire electricity grid strengthening program, which will be \nrolled out during 2015\u20132024. The RBL approach will enhance the predictability and amount of \nsector financing, helping to attract additional financing from other development partners. \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n13.  The program will support PLN\u2019s broader program for Sumatra and cover activities during \n2015\u20132019. The scope of both programs is in Table 1.6 \n   \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2015\u20132017.

Program Results \n \n14.  The RBL program\u2019s impact will be enhanced quality of life in Indonesian society, with the \nsustainable use of electricity acting as a key driver of increased economic activity. The outcome \nwill be the achievement of an adequate and reliable power supply for Sumatra. The outputs are \nselected from PLN\u2019s key performance indicators. A total of three outcome and three output \ntargets have been developed into annual DLIs; their achievement will set the progressive steps \nto meeting the overall program outcome target. Two financing of prior results process indicators \nfocusing on PLN\u2019s procurement system and contract implementation strengthening are also \nincluded and linked to disbursement in the preparatory phases of the program. The results chain \nincludes some targets articulating the RBL program\u2019s outcome, which are difficult to link to \ndisbursements and therefore are included in the program action plan (PAP).7 The program has \nthree results areas. \n \n(i)  Results area 1: Existing transmission system strengthened and expanded. \nOutput 1 will contribute to PLN\u2019s efforts to strengthen and expand the existing \ntransmission system (DLI 4 and PAPs 1, 2, 5, and 7) including reconductoring of \nexisting  150  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  lines,  extension  of  150  kV  and  275  kV \nsubstations,  installation  of  150  kV  and  275  kV  reactors  and  capacitors,  and \nexpansion of outgoing 20 kV switchgears at existing 150 kV substations. This \nresults area addresses PLN\u2019s efforts to improve system resiliency and regional \nreliability across Sumatra with a stronger transmission system. \n \n(ii)  Results  area  2:  Existing  distribution  system  strengthened  and  expanded. \nOutput 2 will contribute to PLN programs to expand and reinforce the medium-\nvoltage  (20  kV)  and  low-voltage  distribution  networks,  install  distribution \ntransformers, install service connections and feeders, and install customer meter \nboxes and circuit breakers (DLIs 5 and 6, and PAPs 4, 6, and 7).

It includes key actions \nin  specific  technical  areas,  fiduciary  management,  M&E,  and  safeguards,  to  ensure  that \nachievement of key program results strengthens PLN systems, thus making the program results \nmore sustainable. Since PLN systems have been assessed as robust, the PAP will focus on \nimplementation capacity, which will complement physical investments under the program and \ncontribute to its overall efforts to increase staff productivity, improve human capital readiness, \nand strengthen institutional capacity. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The program will be implemented from December 2015 to December 2019. PLN will \nimplement this program through its operating units responsible for the Sumatra electricity grid. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n23.  Several technical assessments have concluded that the power system in Indonesia \nneeds  to (i)  improve  overall  system  performance;  (ii)  increase  private  sector  engagement;  \n(iii) strengthen PLN\u2019s operating and financial performance; (iv) build institutional capacity; and \n(v) access funding directly from international financial institutions, commercial banks, and capital \nmarkets. \n \n24.  PLN\u2019s  program  to  strengthen  the  Sumatra  power  system  is  well  justified  and \noperationally  viable.  The  program  will  contribute  to  (i)  improving  quality  and  reliability  by \nreducing  average  customer  downtime;  (ii)  addressing  annual  peak  load  increase  of  9%;  \n(iii) rehabilitating and building at least 19,300 ckm of transmission and 37,500 ckm of new \ndistribution lines; (iv) increasing energy sales to 47,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh); and (v) reducing \n                                                \n10 Ceilings are 25% for advance financing and 20% for financing for prior results. The combined outstanding balance \nof advance financing and amount of financing for prior results should not exceed 30%. \n ", "8 \n \ndistribution losses from 11.94% in 2014 to less than 10.00% by 2019. These targets underpin \nthe program results areas, key actions to be taken, and performance indicators for the sector \noverall and the proposed program in particular.  \n \n25.  The  program  will  also  generate  incremental  benefits  accrued  from  the  additional \nelectricity supply due to the strengthened and expanded transmission and distribution capacity. \nDuring 2015\u20132019, a 9 GW increase in grid capacity will deliver incremental energy sales of at \nleast 4,300 GWh within 4 years of start-up of operations. The economic analysis yields an \neconomic internal rate of return of 15.7%, confirming the program\u2019s economic viability.11 \n \nB.  Program System Assessments \n \n26.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system. PLN\u2019s corporate M&E system is handled and \nmanaged  by  its  Corporate  Performance  Control  Unit  using  its  Management  Reporting \nInformation System, which will also verify the DLIs.12 The Management Reporting Information \nSystem contains data on critical dimensions such as performance, electricity generation, energy \nsales, transmission and distribution, and projects and construction. It provides accurate real-\ntime online data. To implement the M&E requirements, each department operates information \ntechnology applications that are developed together with PLN\u2019s Information Technology Division. \nThese applications generate data and provide information on current activities and for the M&E \nprocess for PLN management and board of directors.13 A monthly summary report provides \ncomprehensive data in real time on customer service quality, project performance, corporate \nperformance,  and  electricity  conditions.  If  needed,  independent  monitoring  by  ADB  can \nsupplement this information. \n \n27.  Fiduciary  systems.  The  program  will  use  PLN\u2019s  fiduciary  systems  for  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and anticorruption. These systems were assessed to determine \ntheir ability to manage fiduciary risks and provide assurance that RBL program funds will be \nused for the intended purposes, with due consideration for economy and efficiency.14 The \nassessments found that improvements are needed in planning and budgeting, and that further \ncomputerization is required for accounting and financial reporting. This will be covered by \nactivities under the PAP. \n \n28.  The procurement assessment covered the procurement profile, procurement regulations, \nrules, procedures and arrangements, agency organizational capacity and arrangements, and \nprocurement system performance.15 The program will rely on PLN procurement systems in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  RBL  policy.16 The  assessment  notes  that  the  overall  procurement \nframework, as expressed in PLN guidelines for procurement, is robust as it follows many best \npractices used by utility companies around the world. PLN will use a variety of procurement \nmethods, which include open competitive bidding, framework contracts, and direct contracting \nthrough open book.17 The procurement of large transformers is excluded from the RBL as \ncontracts average more than $30 million, the limit for goods contracts in ADB\u2019s RBL policy.

Both are integral parts of PLN\u2019s efforts to deliver value-for-money in the procurement \nprocess. A procurement monitoring framework to strengthen PLN\u2019s procurement system has \nbeen developed for this program. \n \n29.  The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with PLN (footnote 16). \n \n30.  Safeguard  systems.  A  program  safeguard  system  assessment  confirms  safeguard \ncategorizations of B for environment, B for involuntary resettlement, and C for  indigenous \npeoples.18 Potential construction-related impacts include disturbance of vegetation, soil erosion, \nsedimentation,  noise,  dust,  vibration,  and  generation  of  waste.  Potential  impacts  during \noperation include trimming of trees within the right-of-way of transmission and distribution lines. \nThe program impacts are site-specific, and can be mitigated and/or managed by PLN's current \npractices. The program\u2019s activities that relate to extension of substations, installation of reactors \nand  capacitors,  and  expansion  of  switchgears  will  take  place  in  the  existing  substations\u2019 \npremises owned and managed by PLN. They will not require any involuntary resettlement. \nExpansion of the distribution network (including installation of distribution transformers) will \nrequire (i) use of no more than 0.2 square meters of land for installation of concrete poles, and \n(ii) possible removal of nonland assets (primarily trees) for stringing of conductors. Although \nSumatra is inhabited by a variety of ethnic groups, the program will not be in areas where \nindigenous peoples are present. Gaps identified by the assessment include weak management \nof industrial waste and the procedure for negotiated settlements or voluntary donation, which \nare addressed in the PAP. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.19 The overall benefits \nand impacts are expected to outweigh the risks and costs. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Ratings  Key Mitigating Measures \nResults.
