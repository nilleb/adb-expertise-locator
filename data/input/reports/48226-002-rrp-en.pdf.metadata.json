For the investment in physical infrastructure to be effective and \nsustainable, the investment program will strengthen the institutional capacity of the implementing \nagencies on road safety and road maintenance.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\n Rationale \n\n3. \nIn India, rural roads comprise 80% of the overall road network, connecting rural habitations \nwith  major  district  roads,  state roads,  and  national  highways.  The  magnitude  of  the  rural  road \nnetwork  and  its  contribution  in delivering  inclusive economic growth in the country\u2019s  rural  area \nrequire  continued  engagement  in  the  sector.  The  requirement  of  all-weather  rural  roads  is \nessential for the last mile connectivity to enhance access to markets, health centers, education \nfacilities, and other socioeconomic opportunities. \n \nRoad  map.  The  Government  of  India  seeks  to  improve  rural  connectivity  through  the \n4. \nPrime Minister\u2019s Rural Road Program or Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). It is a \nnational  flagship  program,  and  is  included  in  India\u2019s  Three  Year  Action  Agenda  for  FY2018\u2013\nFY2020.3 The first phase of the PMGSY (PMGSY-I) started in 2000 to provide basic connectivity \nfor  about  133,900  rural  habitations  in  all  states  by  constructing  rural  roads  to  all-weather \nstandards (531,500 km). So far in 2017, 513,000 km of rural roads (96.5%) have been built.4 The \nstates that have substantially completed PMGSY-I will be eligible to proceed to the second phase \nof the PMGSY (PMGSY-II), which plans to upgrade an additional 50,000 km to improve access \nto district centers and rural hubs.5 \n\n \n5. \nStrategic context. Collectively, the PMGSY\u2019s main goals are to (i) reduce poverty faster \nfor more inclusive growth; (ii) expand rural infrastructure to accelerate agricultural growth and the \nrural economy; (iii) create more jobs; and (iv) enable social development to improve education, \nhealth, and social indicators. PMGSY-I started with a basic and inclusive goal: to provide essential \nconnectivity  for  all  rural  habitations.  PMGSY-II  is  the  next  step:  to  enable  mobility  for  self-\nemployment and livelihood opportunities. It does this by upgrading existing rural roads that meet \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA for the Second Rural Connectivity Investment \n\n3   Government  of  India,  National  Institution  for  Transforming  India  Aayog.  2017.  India:  Three  Year  Action  Agenda, \n\nProgram (TA 8828-IND).  \n\n2017\u201318 to 2019\u201320. New Delhi.  \n\n4  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. http://omms.nic.in/Home/CitizenPage/ (accessed on 24 June 2017). \n5  So far, 7,700 km of rural roads have been upgraded under PMGSY-II.  \n\n\fcertain criteria based on their economic potential and their role in facilitating such impacts. This \nprovides  additional  capacity  for  traffic,  including  larger  vehicles,  and  enables  safer  and  more \nefficient mobility of people and goods.6 To ensure sustainability of its strategic outcomes, PMGSY \nincludes a 5-year post construction maintenance provision included in the civil works contracts.  \n\n \n6. \nPolicy  framework.  The  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MORD)  has  established  the \nNational  Rural  Roads  Development  Agency  (NRRDA)  to  manage  the  implementation  of  the \nPMGSY by the state governments. The NRRDA\u2019s tasks are to (i) oversee the technical aspects, \n(ii) conduct  quality  control  and  monitoring,  and  (iii)  ease  coordination  between  implementing \nagencies in the states. A program guideline is available to regulate (i) the selection and approval \nof subprojects to ensure effective use of funding, (ii) rural road maintenance, (iii) rural road safety, \nand (iv) funding flow  between the  central  and  state governments.  Collectively,  this  institutional \nand  regulatory  set-up  have  been  recognized  as  a  sound  country  system  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners.  However,  ensuring the  capacity  of \nthe state governments to fully sustain the benefits is critical. This includes assuming responsibility \nfor  conducting  maintenance  beyond  the  5-year  post-construction  maintenance  provision,  and \nensuring road safety with suitable technical measures and community awareness campaigns. \n \n7. \nPrevious ADB assistance. Since 2003, ADB has provided assistance to PMGSY-I in the \ninvestment program states through loans totaling $1.15 billion, and constructed over 22,600 km \nof  all-weather  rural  roads.  These  were  completed  satisfactorily  and  rated  successful  or  highly \nsuccessful.7 In  2012,  the  first  Rural  Connectivity  Investment  Program  (RCIP)  using  the  MFF \nmodality was approved for $800 million to provide additional coverage under PMGSY-I for about \n9,000 km of all-weather rural roads in the investment program states.8 The first and the second \ntranches were substantially completed, and the third tranche is ongoing.9 By the end of the first \nRCIP,  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Chhattisgarh  will  have  completed  their  scope  for  PMGSY-I,  and \nready to proceed with PMGSY-II. The first RCIP also aims to strengthen institutional capacity to \nmanage rural roads in the investment program states. This entails establishing rural road network \nmanagement units (RRNMUs) for asset management and operation of the rural road networks, \nand  rural  connectivity  training  and  research  centers  (RCTRCs)  for  staff  training,  knowledge \nmanagement, and research. Under the first RCIP, the implementing agencies have successfully \nestablished one pilot RRNMU and one RCTRC in each investment program state, equipped with \noperation  manuals  and  procedures  prepared  under  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance. 10 Using  the \ninstitutional  set-up  of  the  pilot  RRNMU  as  a  model,  the  implementing  agencies  are  currently \nestablishing another 25 RRNMUs to manage rural roads in the entire investment program states.  \n\n \nThe investment program. The proposed Second Rural Connectivity Investment Program \n8. \nwill encompass both PMGSY-I and PMGSY-II to improve about 12,000 km of rural roads in the \ninvestment program states. It will continue capacity development and build on the achievement \n\n                                                \n6  PMGSY-II roads will have a standard width of 5.50 meters, wider than that of PMGSY-I (3.75 meters). \n7   ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fof the first RCIP by strengthening the operations of the 25 RRNMUs and RCTRCs to sustain rural \nroad maintenance and safety as required by the PMGSY guidelines. The investment program will \nallow continued assistance to the PMGSY and support the government\u2019s long-term goal for rural \ndevelopment. It will further strengthen the government\u2019s initiative toward achieving more inclusive \neconomic growth and is also closely aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 \nfor India.11 Lessons from the previous MMFs have been incorporated in the design: provision of \ndedicated road safety support for the RRNMUs in each state, and financing of consulting services \nby the governments to allow continuous technical supports for the entire investment program. \n \n9. \nAn  MFF  is  proposed  as  the  financing  modality  because  it  is  suitable  for  a  large-scale \ninvestment requiring long-term implementation period and involving a large number of subprojects. \nAn  MFF  allows  a  long-term  partnership  with  the  government  for  policy  dialogue  and  capacity \ndevelopment. The NRRDA and the implementing agencies in the investment program states are \nfamiliar  with  the  requirements  and  procedures  of  the  MFF,  and  have  a  good  track  record  of \nimplementing the PMGSY under the MFF modality from over 10 years of ADB assistance in the \nrural road sector. All subprojects under tranche 1 and the subsequent tranches will be of a similar \nnature. Subproject with safeguard category A will not be included. \n \n10. \nClimate  change  adaptation.  Climate  risks  in  the  investment  program  states  are \nincreased intensity and frequency of rainfall, and storm surges in the states with coastal areas.  \nThe  inundation  and  flooding  of  roads,  slope  failure,  and  inadequate  capacity  of  drainage \nstructures are the program roads\u2019 key climate risks. The engineering design will include suitable \nadaptation measures such as greater elevation of road embankments in flood-prone and coastal \nareas, increased capacity of side and cross drains, and slope protection. The incremental cost for \nthe climate change adaptation measures in the investment program is about $28.33 million. \n\n \n11. \nInnovative approach in rural road development. The investment program will support \nthe  government\u2019s  initiative  for  innovative  approaches  to  reducing  costs,  conserving  non-\nrenewable natural resources, and promoting the use of waste materials. This includes the use of \nalternative materials such as jute fiber for soil stabilization, and alternative construction methods \nsuch as asphalt cold-mixing for about 15% of the total length of rural roads in each investment \nprogram  state.  The  implementing  agencies  will  also  explore  other  innovative  approaches  to \nensure the technical feasibility for future implementation. \n\n \n12. \nFinance plus. The investment program will help bring about a transformational impact by \ninstitutionalizing  road  safety  and  road  maintenance  through  the  RRNMUs\u2019  and  RCTRCs\u2019 \noperations  in  the  investment  program  states.  The  investment  program  will  continue  to  help \ndevelop their institutional capacity to deliver the road maintenance and safety objectives, and to \noperate as an integral part of the respective state rural road development agencies (SRRDAs). \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  mobility  and  accessibility  in  India  are \n\n13. \nimproved. The outcome will be rural connectivity in the investment program states improved. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe outputs of the investment program will be: (i) rural roads in the investment program \nstates improved, (ii) institutional capacity of PMGSY implementing agencies strengthened, and \n\n                                                \n11  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2018\u20132022. Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f(iii) operation and maintenance of PMGSY roads sustained. The physical component includes the \nconstruction  of  12,000  km  of  roads  in the  investment  program  states,  i.e.,  building  all-weather \nrural roads for unconnected habitations, and upgrading rural roads linking to the state\u2019s district \ncenters. 12  The  capacity-strengthening  component  includes  providing  training  to  PMGSY \nengineers and giving support to RRNMUs and RCTRCs on road safety and road maintenance in \nthe investment program states. \n \n15. \nRoad safety. The implementing agencies, through the RRNMU operations, will carry out \nthe  road  safety  audits  (RSAs)  on the  program roads at  the  design,  construction  and  operation \nstages, following the procedures set out in the Rural Road Safety Manual, which was developed \nunder ADB\u2019s TA (footnote 10). MORD approved the manual for application in the entire PMGSY. \nThe  investment  program  will  strengthen  the  RRNMUs  to  manage  and  conduct  the  RSAs.  The \nRCTRCs  will  provide  regular  training  on  rural  road  safety  to  retain  the  skill  sets  within  the \ninstitutions. \n \n16. \nSustainable  road  maintenance.  The  program  team  will  support  the  RRNMUs  in \nmanaging  road  maintenance  beyond  the  5-year  post-construction  maintenance  period  by \npreparing  and  implementing  a  systematic  road  maintenance  plan.  This  will  prioritize  the \nidentification  of  scope  for  road  maintenance  and  the  associated  costs  for  financing  by  the \nrespective state government. \n\n17. \n\n \nThe first tranche of the investment program will deliver the following outputs:  \n(i) \n\nRural  roads  in  the  investment  program  states  improved.  This  includes  (a) \n3,145.67 km of rural roads constructed to all-weather standards under PMGSY-I \n(976.99 km  in Assam;  1,571.28 km  in  Odisha;  and  597.40 km  in West  Bengal); \nand  (b)  3,108.59  km  of  rural  roads  upgraded  under  PMGSY-II  (1,001.08  km  in \nChhattisgarh and 2,107.51 km in Madhya Pradesh).  \nInstitutional  capacity  of  the  PMGSY  implementing  agencies  strengthened. \nThe RCTRCs will conduct and manage the training programs for 2,000 PMGSY \nengineers,  including  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  and  RRNMU  staff, \npanchayat  raj  institution  staff,  as  well  as  consultants  and  contractors  in  the \ninvestment program states.13  \nOperation  and  maintenance  of  the  PMGSY  roads  sustained.  This  includes \ntechnical support for the RRNMUs to roll out RSAs and road maintenance. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe investment program is estimated to cost $1,225.26 million, including taxes and duties, \n\n \nD. \n \n18. \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 1). \n \nThe government has requested an MFF in an amount of up to $500 million from ADB's \n19. \nordinary capital resources to help finance a part of the investment program.

To achieve this objective, the project team, \nthrough  the  TA,  will  (i)  support  the  RRNMUs  to  prepare  and  implement  a  systematic  road \nmaintenance program, (ii) prepare disaster risk and vulnerability assessments in natural-disaster-\nprone  areas,  and  (iii)  engage  with  RCTRCs  to  identify  and  assess  the  feasibility  of  innovative \napproaches in rural road development.  \n \n23. \nThe TA is estimated to cost $720,000, of which $500,000 equivalent will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government \nwill provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation, office supplies, fees \nfor research organizations and academic institutions, testing materials, travel and logistics during \nsite visits, and other in-kind contributions. The executing agency of the TA will be MORD through \nthe NRRDA, and the implementing agencies will be the state governments through the respective \nSRRDAs. The TA will be implemented over 48 months, from January 2018 to December 2021. \nADB  will  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  and  an  individual  expert  as  capacity-building \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fconsultants. The recruitment will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will submit a biodata \ntechnical  proposal,  and  the  selection  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method, using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10.16 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n24. \nThe rural roads to be constructed or upgraded are selected on a priority basis following \nthe PMGSY-I and PGMSY-II guidelines.17 The rural road design follows the design criteria in line \nwith applicable Indian Road Congress regulations, particularly regarding road safety aspects.18 It \nalso  considers  site-specific  information  gathered  during  transect  walks.19 ADB  will  recruit  road \nsafety experts to support the RRNMUs in rolling out RSAs. The project implementation consultant \n(PIC) includes safeguard experts to ensure the proper incorporation of safeguard requirements in \nthe bidding documents. The technical support consultant (TSC) will monitor the implementation \nof the safeguard requirements and road safety requirements.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nUnder PMGSY-I, the rural roads will be reconstructed or upgraded to bituminous surfaced \n25. \nroads with sufficient side and cross drains to provide safe all-year access to the habitations. Under \nPMGSY-II, the rural road upgrades include widening single-lane roads to intermediate-lane roads \nwhere  traffic  projections  indicate  the  need  for  capacity  augmentation.  The  program  team \nconducted  economic  analysis  for  tranche  1  on  the  sample  roads  in  each  state.  The  benefits \nconsidered in the analysis are: (i) vehicle operating costs savings for motorized vehicles, (ii) travel \ntime  savings  for  passengers  of  motorized  vehicles,  (iii)  value  of  equivalent  energy  savings  for \nslow-moving vehicles, (iv) savings from avoided higher travel costs during rainy seasons in the \ncase  of  existing  gravel  or  earthen  roads,  and  (v)  savings  from  reduced  emissions  valued  in \nmonetary  terms.  The  analysis  indicated  that,  overall,  the  investment  program  is  economically \nviable\u2014the economic internal rates of return range from 13.0% to 15.9% depending on the state, \nwhich  is  well  above  the  acceptable  rate  of  9%.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicated  that,  with  a  10% \nincrease in capital costs or a 10% decrease in benefits, the overall investment program remains \neconomically viable. All-year access will bring several additional benefits to the villages, such as \ngreater  crop  diversification  and  less  spoilage,  an  increase  in  land  values,  more  educational \nopportunities, and better access to health facilities. These additional benefits are not included in \nthe  economic  analysis.  The  investment  program  includes  an  impact  evaluation  study  that  will \ncompare socioeconomic conditions of affected communities before and after the implementation \nof PMGSY-II in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. The results and recommendations from this \nstudy will be shared with the MORD to inform the planning for future investment. \n \n\n                                                \n16  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 A rural road to be built under PMGSY-I will connect a habitation with at least 500 residents in plain areas, or at least \n250 residents in hilly areas. A rural road to be upgraded under PMGSY-II is proposed by the state as part of a district \nrural road plan to be approved by MORD. Government of India, Ministry of Rural Development. 2015.

A transect walk is performed jointly by \nthe design consultant, the PIC, and PIU staff for each subproject road. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fThe program will not generate revenue. The sustainability of rural roads constructed or \n26. \nupgraded  under  the  investment  program  is  ensured  through  the  5-year  post-construction \nmaintenance  included  in  each  civil  works  contract.  After  this  period,  road  maintenance  will  be \nmanaged by the SRRDAs through the RRNMUs\u2019 operations. The state government will finance \nroad maintenance in accordance with the PMGSY guidelines (footnote 17). In 2016, the SRRDAs \nspent  an  aggregate  amount  of  $306.16  million  on  the  maintenance  of  PMGSY  roads.  The \nincremental recurring cost for the state governments of the rural roads built under tranche 1 are \nestimated to range from 2.6% to 6.0%. Observations during project preparation confirmed that \nthe rural roads that had benefited from the 5-year post-construction maintenance agenda were in \nreasonably good conditions. The investment program will support the RRNMUs in devising and \nimplementing a systematic road maintenance program to ensure the most effective maintenance. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nInstitutional. Each investment program state has established equivalents of the SRRDAs \nand field PIUs to manage PMGSY implementation. Since the start of the PMGSY in 2000, the \nSRRDAs have gained adequate implementation experience and strengthened staff qualifications. \nThe PIC will support the SRRDAs in implementing safeguard frameworks and RSAs. The NRRDA \nhas shown a good track record in providing technical supports to the SRRDAs and working with \nADB to monitor the overall project implementation. The TSC will support MORD and the NRRDA \nin overall due diligence and compliance monitoring. ADB and the NRRDA will recruit consulting \nservices to provide hands-on operational support to the newly established RRNMUs and RCTRCs \nin the investment program states. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  fund  flow  from  the  central  to  the  state  governments  will \n28. \nfollow the pattern of grants-in-aid under the centrally sponsored schemes of the government, and \nits relevant financial rules will apply. All states use the PMGSY\u2019s online management, monitoring, \nand  accounting  system  for  project  accounting  and  reporting.  The  program  team  conducted  a \nfund-flow  arrangements, \nfinancial  management  assessment  of \ngovernance,  staffing,  budgeting,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  internal  control \nprocedures, financial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The \nassessment concluded that (i) the minimum required policies and procedures are in place, and \nthat  (ii) the  statutory  audit  function  of  the  SRRDAs  is  currently  carried  out  by  an  independent \nauditor  appointed  as  per  the  PMGSY  guidelines.  The  assessment  also  found  that  the  overall \nfinancial  management  risk  is  moderate,  and  suggested  mitigation  measures  for  the  key  risks: \n(i) improve the records of financial transactions, (ii) ensure regular submission of reliable financial \nstatements, (iii) ensure reliable monitoring reports, and (iv) maintain the financial assets.20  \n \n29. \nThe SRRDAs will continue to maintain separate program records and accounts to identify \nthe  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  under  the  program,  ensuring  an  adequate \naudit  trail.  This  will  also  lead  to  the  review  of  the  annual  financial  statements  by  an  auditor \nacceptable to ADB, following auditing standards acceptable to ADB. \n \nProcurement of civil works. The procurement of civil works will be in accordance with \n30. \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  It  will  follow  national \ncompetitive bidding procedures and use the standard bidding document used for the first RCIP \nas well as an electronic procurement system (e-procurement) that has been improved as needed, \n\nthe  SRRDAs,  covering \n\n                                                \n20 The financial management assessment was carried out in 2016. Further details are in the FAM. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fin agreement with ADB.21 The procurement procedures adopted under the investment program \nare detailed in the FAM (footnote 15). \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  central  government  and  the  governments  of  the  investment  program  states.  Specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM (footnote 15). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n32. \nPoverty and social. The investment program states still lag behind various development \nindicators. The provision of all-weather roads in rural areas will be a key factor in reducing poverty. \nSpecifically, (i) farmers will benefit from better access to rural markets and stronger agricultural \nproductivity will increase their incomes, (ii) rural communities will be able to shift from subsistence \nfarming  to  more  commercially  oriented  agricultural  production,  (iii) production  of  high-value \nperishable  products  will  be  possible,  (iv)  poor  households  will  be  able to  access  better-paying \njobs outside their villages, (v) investments in nonagricultural enterprises will grow at a faster pace, \nand (vi) the investment program itself will create labor opportunities for the rural poor. \n \n33. \nGender and development. During preparation, the program team consulted more than \n14,130 women who participated in transect walks, representing about 27% of the total number of \nparticipants.  Gender  analysis  highlighted  several  key  benefits,  which  the  all-weather  roads \nconstructed under the investment program will bring, including an increase in the rate of safe child \ndeliveries,  reduction  in  maternal  and  prenatal  deaths  and  mortality  of  children,  and  increased \nenrollment  of  girls  in  schools  and  universities.  The  gender  action  plan  prepared  for  tranche  1 \nincorporates  several  gender  mainstreaming  targets\u2014(i)  participation  of  women  in  the  transect \nwalks to be at least 20%; (ii) 100% of vulnerable households led by women and affected by the \ninvestment program to be identified and to directly benefit from appropriate mitigation measures, \nand/or to be linked to poverty alleviation and/or livelihood restoration programs; (iii) at least 33% \nof workers hired in road construction and road maintenance works to be women; and (iv) at least \n30% of members in the grievance redress committees are women. \n \n34. \nHIV/AIDS and labor. The investment program\u2019s social assessments do not anticipate any \nrise in the incidence of HIV/AIDS. Each investment program state will ensure that works contracts \nfollow  all  applicable  labor  laws  and  regulations  and  include  provisions  requiring  contractors  to \nconduct HIV/AIDS awareness programs for those employed during road construction. The PIUs \nwill conduct close monitoring and, along with the contractors, will coordinate with the State AIDS \nControl  Society  on  carrying  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs.  Core  labor  standards  will  be \nfollowed. Men and women will be paid equal wages for equal work. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n35. \nEnvironment.  Tranche  1  is  categorized  as  B  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). None of the project roads will be located inside or near a protected or \nenvironmentally sensitive area. The program team prepared an environmental assessment and \nreview framework (EARF) for the MFF and initial environmental examination reports for each state \nfor tranche 1, which were disclosed on the ADB website. The predicted environmental impacts \nare minimal, temporary, and reversible since they relate mainly to occupational health and safety \nor to minor issues of dust, noise, and water pollution, which occur mostly during construction. The \nprogram team developed mitigation measures for all environmental impacts and integrated them \n\n                                                \n21 ADB approved the e-procurement for national competitive bidding in all investment program states in 2009\u20132011. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fby incorporating a standard environmental management plan (EMP) in the bidding documents, \nand providing road-specific EMPs in the detailed project reports. The program team conducted \npublic consultations on all roads during transect walks, as required under the PMGSY guidelines. \nEnvironmental checklists prepared from the data collected on the transect walks were integrated \ninto the EMP to give proper guidance on site-specific issues. The environmental assessment of \nthe subsequent tranches will follow the same approach as used for tranche 1 and is given in the \nEARF. A grievance redress mechanism will manage the concerns of local stakeholders. The PIC \nwill  assist  the  safeguard  focal  person  at  each  SRRDA  in  supervising  the  contractor\u2019s \nimplementation of the EMP and preparing the required monitoring reports. The TSC will carry out \nexternal monitoring of environmental safeguards. The institutional capacities and arrangements \nshould therefore suffice to effectively implement the EARF, initial environment examinations, and \nEMPs. \n \n36. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  Tranche  1  is  categorized  as  C  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Road construction or upgrades will be mostly within existing rights-\nof-way, with some cases of widening and minor realignments that will require narrow strips of land \nto be made available. In such cases, the voluntary land donation principle will apply, as it did in \nthe  preceding  ADB  interventions.  Activities  under  the  investment  program  are  not  expected  to \ninvolve involuntary resettlement, and the state government will ensure that no involuntary land \nacquisition takes place. In case of refusal to donate land, eminent domain will not take place, and \nthat  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  will  not  be  triggered.  Specific  procedural  requirements \ninvolving  comprehensive  consultations  with  the  communities  are  provided  in  the  state-specific \ncommunity participation frameworks (CPFs), which are disclosed on the ADB website. The social \ndue  diligence  for  tranche  1  confirmed  that  the  communities  and  affected  individuals  were \nconsulted  about  the  project  roads.  In  accordance  with  the  CPF,  the  program  team  conducted \ntransect walks for all project roads. Affected persons were made aware that they had the option \nto  refuse  land  donation  and,  as  a  result,  some  of  the  road  designs  were  slightly  altered.  The \nimplementing  agencies  conducted  census  surveys  and  identified  9,938  persons  who  donated \nland; 1,938 of them are considered vulnerable. Vulnerable affected individuals who do not benefit \nfrom government-sponsored poverty alleviation schemes will be linked to these programs through \nthe investment program. The surveys revealed that no physical relocation would result from the \nprogram, as impacts identified were minor\u2014affecting 5% or less of an individual\u2019s plot of land and, \nin  rare  instances,  external  sections  of  privately  owned  structures,  which  the  panchayats  will \nsupport  in  rebuilding.  No  affected  person  has  fallen  under  the  poverty  line  as  a  result  of  the \ndonations.  The  PIUs  secured  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  each  affected  individual, \nverified  by  a third party. A grievance redress  committee  was  set  up for each project  road.  For \nmore information, state-specific social compliance reports for the tranche 1 roads were disclosed \non the ADB website. \n \n37. \nIndigenous peoples. Tranche 1 is categorized as C in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  social  assessment  identified  the  presence  of  scheduled  tribes  in  all \ninvestment  program  states.  However,  these  groups  are  largely  assimilated  into  the  local \npopulation. The investment program will not have any differential impact on scheduled tribes\u2014 \nthey will receive similar benefits from the investment program as nonscheduled tribe households, \nand the impact on tribal and cultural identity will not be significant. All outputs will be delivered in \na culturally appropriate and participatory manner. To further mitigate the risks, the CPFs identify \nspecial provisions for all scheduled tribe households, ensuring that their living standards are not \nadversely affected because of land donation or in the event of any loss of nonland assets and \nimpacts on their livelihoods.  \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts of the investment program are expected to outweigh \nthe costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.22  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nLow response by contractors during \nthe initial stage of procurement \n\nStart-up of operations of RRNMUs \nand RCTRCs delayed \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nAdvance contracting will be used.
