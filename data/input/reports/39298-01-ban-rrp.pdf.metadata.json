The  report \nalso  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  for  (i)  Strengthening  Regional \nPlanning  and  Governance,  and  (ii) Energy  Efficiency  Improvement,  and  if  the  Board  approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTAs. \n \nThe  project1  aims  to  increase  growth  potential  and  environmental  sustainability  of  two \n2. \ncity regions based on coherent regional urban planning. A city region is defined as an organic \nagglomeration of a large city, surrounding secondary towns, and adjacent peri-urban areas. The \nproject will target the city regions of Dhaka and Khulna.2 It will support the development of key \nurban  infrastructure,  focusing  on  urban  environment  and  local  economic  development.  The \nproject  also  supports  government  efforts  to  improve  regional  and  urban  planning,  and  to \nstrengthen  municipal  management  and  capacity \nfor  effective  and  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nUrbanization \n\nin  Bangladesh.  Bangladesh  has  urbanized  very  rapidly  and \n\n3. \nits \nframeworks of urban planning and development are not capable to meet the evolving demands. \nGrowing  at  current  rates,  the  country\u2019s  urban  population  is  estimated  to  double  by  2035  and \nreach  74  million.3  In  the  course  of  this  rapid  urbanization,  a  large  city  (city  corporation), \nsurrounding  secondary  towns  (pourashavas),  and  adjacent  peri-urban  areas  (urban  centers) \nhave been agglomerating into a city region with close economic and social links.4 However, while \neffectively one sprawling city, it is still administered by multiple municipal governments. Because a \ncomprehensive  framework  for  integrated  planning  and  coordination  among  municipalities  is \nlacking,  the  city  regions  have  been  unable  to  realize  their  full  development  potential. \nImplementation  of  the  Dhaka  Metropolitan  Development  Plan  (DMDP)  (1995\u20132015)  has  been \nvery slow, and the plan is fast becoming outdated. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK)5 led \nthe preparation of the DMDP, and there are criticisms that it did not sufficiently consult with the \npublic and the municipalities. Private and public development projects are not always coordinated \nenough to focus limited resources on priority areas.  \n \nThe project will support improvement of urban planning through a review and update of \n4. \nthe  urban  development  plans,  notably  the  DMDP,  and  strengthen  coordination  between \nmunicipalities  and  planning  agencies.  The  DMDP  and  municipal  development  plans  will  be \nupdated in a consistent manner to  establish a  coherent regional development framework. The \nproject will support the implementation of the DMDP through feasibility studies and investment \nin key infrastructure. An associated TA, Strengthening Regional Planning and Governance, will \n                                                 \n1  The  project  was  prepared  through  ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for \n\nPreparing the City Region Development Project. Manila. \n\n2  Dhaka is the largest city in Bangladesh and Khulna is the third largest, and both have good growth potential. The \nsecond  largest  city,  Chittagong,  is  excluded  since  other  development  partners  have  major  programs  supporting \nChittagong. ADB has ongoing and planned projects in Dhaka and Khulna that will underpin this project.    \n\n3  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2005. Dhaka. \n4  The project will build on the foundation and frameworks developed under the flagship publication Asian Development \n\nBank (ADB). 2008. City Cluster Development \u2013 Toward an Urban-Led Development Strategy for Asia. Manila. \n\n5  Rajdhani  Unnayan  Kartripakkha  means  capital  development  authority.  RAJUK  is  the  government  agency \n\nresponsible for urban planning in the Dhaka city region. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nreview  the  institutional  framework  for  regional  planning  and  governance  to  rationalize  urban \nplanning and development control.  \n \n5. \nMunicipal  infrastructure  and  services.  The  development  of  urban  infrastructure  has \nnot  kept  pace  with  the  rapid  urbanization.  Combined  with  ineffective  planning  and  control, \ninadequate infrastructure causes environmental degradation, and restricts economic and social \nactivities.  In  Dhaka,  pollution  of  water  bodies  caused  by  limited  sewerage  and  poor \nmaintenance  of  sanitation  facilities  such  as  septic  tanks  has  become  a  serious  concern.  In \nKhulna, floods and water logging severely restrict local economic activities in monsoon season. \nClimate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of flooding. Piped water is \navailable only in the city center, and water service is poor in most pourashavas. Lack of access \nto  water  and  sanitation  facilities  imposes  a  particular  burden  on  women,  who  are  primary \ncaretakers  of  household  health.  Available  transport  infrastructure  cannot  cope  with  growing \ntraffic  volumes,  and  traffic  flows  are  further  limited  by  poor  traffic  management,  such  as \nuncontrolled  roadside  parking.  Poor  roadside  conditions  adversely  affect  pedestrians,  most  of \nwhich are women and the poor.   \n \n6. \nMunicipalities  have  not  been  able  to  address  these  issues  for  lack  of  human  and \nfinancial resources. The few interventions are reactive, responding only to the immediate needs, \nwithout a coordinated strategy for effective investments. The project will enhance the capacity of \nthe  infrastructure  that  is  best  suited  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and  stimulate  the  local \neconomy.  The  project  takes  a  sector  approach,  and  subprojects  will  be  prioritized  to  ensure \ncoherent  regional  development.  Although  municipalities  tend  to  be  constrained  by  limited \ncapacity,  some  have  achieved  remarkable  improvements  through  recent  projects  such  as  the \nUrban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (UGIIP).6  The  key  lesson \nlearned from the UGIIP is that performance-based allocation of investment funds creates strong \nincentives,  and  substantial  improvement  can  be  achieved  if  it  is  combined  with  appropriate \ncapacity building programs.7 Based on these achievements and lessons learned, the project will \nadopt  performance-based  allocation  of  investment  funds.  The  flexibility  of  a  sector  loan  will \nallow municipalities to compete with each other to secure the investment funds, creating strong \nincentive to meet the performance targets. The capacity-building programs will follow the UGIIP \nprograms  and  particularly  help  new  municipalities  achieve  performance  targets.  Project \nimplementation  will  be  more  expeditious  than  previously  possible  since  many  implementing \nagencies have strengthened their capacity under the UGIIP.8 \n \n7. \nClimate change. Municipalities are not well prepared to adapt to the expected impacts \nof climate change, and unaware of the potential benefits of energy efficiency. Since Bangladesh \nis  one  of  the  countries most  vulnerable  to climate  change impacts,  policy  and  advisory  TA  for \nStrengthening  Resilience  of  the  Water  Sector  in  Khulna  to  Climate  Change9  has  been \nconducted  to  assess  the  potential  impacts  and  explore  adaptation  measures.  Urban  planning \nand  key  infrastructure  in  Khulna,  notably  drainage,  will  reflect  these  findings.  The  project  will \nsupport  the  municipalities  in  improving  the  energy  efficiency  of  streetlights  and  water  pumps, \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Urban  Governance  and  infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Project. \nManila. For example, property tax collection improved from 34% to 83% in pourashavas that carried out programs \nunder  the  UGIIP.  Public  participation  in  municipal  management  has  been  strengthened  through  various  citizens\u2019 \ncommittees. The Pourashava Act (2009) has made it mandatory to form citizens\u2019 committees. \n\n7  ADB. 2009. Evaluation Study: Urban Sector and Water Supply and Sanitation in Bangladesh.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nwhich account for most of their energy consumption. Municipalities operate water pumps of very \nlow  efficiency,  and  streetlights  are  fitted  with  inefficient  fluorescent  tubes,  implying  large \npotential to save energy and cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. Since energy costs account for \na large share of municipalities' recurrent expenditures, higher energy efficiency can substantially \nimprove municipal finances.  \n \nContext  in  country  programming.  The  project  is  designed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country \n8. \nstrategy and program (2006\u20132010).10 Urban development is a focus area of the country strategy \nand program, and the project will directly contribute to the key outcomes of social development \nand sustainable economic growth. Since the long-term investment requirements of the project\u2019s \ncity  regions  are  very  large,  the  project  will  (i)  directly  fund  crucial  infrastructure  and  (ii) \ncomplement ongoing and planned future projects.11 Its design also reflects lessons learned from \nprevious  interventions  and  takes  into  account  recommendations  of  the  sector  program \nassistance  evaluation.12  The  project  will  invest  in  multiple  municipalities  within  the  two  city \nregions, engaging them constructively in the establishment of a coherent regional development \nplan. The DMDP update and the preparation of feasibility studies will result in a clear road map \nto support a long-term engagement and pinpoint the need for future projects.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  growth  potential  and  environmental \nsustainability  of  the  two  city  regions.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  urban  environment  and \ninfrastructure services based on effective regional and urban planning.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Enhanced Capacity of Urban Infrastructure \n\n \n10. \nThe project will enhance the capacity of crucial urban infrastructure. This output will be \nachieved through implementation of subprojects selected according to pre-established criteria.13 \nThe subprojects will be developed and prioritized within the framework of the updated regional \nurban plans (output 2) to ensure coherent regional development. Municipalities are required to \nmeet certain performance criteria for funding of subprojects, which will create strong incentive to \nimprove municipal management and governance (output 3). \n \n11.  Water  supply  and  sanitation.  Subprojects  relating  to  water  supply  and  sanitation  will \nexpand  access  to  such  services.  Water-supply  subprojects  will  initially  focus  on  rehabilitating \nexisting facilities to reduce leaks, before expanding the system. They will adopt energy-efficient \npumps which will be piloted under TA for energy efficiency improvement. Sanitation subprojects \nwill  emphasize  better  design  and  maintenance  of  septic  tanks,  as  introduction  of  a  sewer \nnetwork  is  premature.  Design  and  management  of  the  subprojects  will  take  into  account \nwomen\u2019s  requirements  since  they  tend  to  fetch  water  and  manage  sanitation  facilities  for  the \nwhole family.  \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005.

Manila.  \n12 Sector Assessment Summary: Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Specified in the Subproject Selection Criteria, Annex A of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the \n\nlist of documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \nSolidwaste  management.  Subprojects  for  solid-waste  management  will  improve \n12. \ncollection and disposal of solid waste. They will be accompanied by awareness campaigns for \nthe  3Rs  (reduce-reuse-recycle).  Primary  collection  will  be  mostly  outsourced  to  community-\nbased organizations (CBOs) or nongovernment organizations.14 Women will be encouraged to \nparticipate in awareness campaign and CBOs. Opportunities for private sector participation and \nregistration  with  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  will  be  explored,  particularly  if  disposal \ninvolves composting. To exploit economies of scale and nurture inter-municipality cooperation, \nthe project will promote the sharing of treatment and disposal facilities among municipalities. \n \n13. \nEnergy  efficiency  program.  Subprojects  in  the  energy  efficiency  program  will  reduce \nenergy  consumption  to  mitigate  CO2  emission,  and  cut  energy  costs  to  improve  municipal \nfinances.  The  program  will  focus  on  introducing  energy-efficient  water  pumps  and  solar-\npowered  streetlights.  It  will  start  with  detailed  energy  audits  and  a  pilot  program,  followed  by \ncapacity  and  awareness  building  among  municipalities  for  an  expansion  of  the  pilot  program. \nOpportunities  to  register  the  subprojects  with  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  will  be \nexplored. \n \n14. \nUrban transport. Subprojects relating to urban transport will focus on infrastructure that \ncan directly stimulate local economic activities. In addition to improving key roads, bus and truck \nterminals,  and  other  facilities,  a  pilot  program  will  be  carried  out  to  introduce  modern  traffic \nmanagement,  such  as  control  of  roadside  parking,  improvement  of  sidewalks,  and  use  of \nsignals to boost traffic flow and provide a safer environment for pedestrians. \n \n15. \nDrainage.  Subprojects  relating  to  drainage  will  rehabilitate  or  extend  drainage  and \nassociated facilities to reduce floods and water logging. This will be accompanied by an initiative \nto  improve  collection  and  disposal  of  solid  waste,  and/or  an  awareness  campaign  on  the \nhazards of dumping solid waste into drains. \n \nUrban revitalization. The project will support a small-scale pilot program to revitalize an \n16. \ninner-city area of historic importance and to stimulate local economic activities. This will include \nupgrading  and  relocating  public  infrastructure,  and  restoring  public  buildings  of  historic \nimportance.  The  pilot  program  will  assess  detailed  implementation  and  financial  requirements \nfor an eventual expansion via private sector participation. \n \n\nOutput 2: Improved Urban Planning \n\n2. \n \n17. \nThe  project  will  support  the  review  and  update  of  urban  development  plans  and \nformulate a framework for coherent regional development. The current DMDP (1995\u20132015) will \nbe  updated  for  the  period  of  2016\u20132035  in  order  to  reflect  the  continued  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  of  the  Dhaka  city  region.  Development  plans  for  pourashavas  will  be  prepared \nand/or updated to ensure consistency with the DMDP. The review will put particular emphasis \non  protecting  the  urban  environment,  taking  into  account  the  impacts  of  urbanization  and \nindustrial activities on water bodies. The subprojects to be supported under the project will be \nprioritized  and  designed  along  the  framework  of  the  DMDP  to  ensure  coherent  regional \ndevelopment.  To  help  realize  the  DMDP,  the  project  will  support  feasibility  studies  for  future \nprojects,  including  one  for  a  satellite  town.  Extensive  public  consultations  will  ensure  public \nparticipation  in  developing  the  DMDP  and  feasibility  studies.  RAJUK  will  be  responsible  for \nupdating  the  DMDP  in  collaboration  with  urban  planners  from  the  Dhaka  city  region\u2019s \nmunicipalities.  The  joint  exercise  will  nurture  a  culture  of  collaboration  between  planning \nagencies and municipalities. \n                                                 \n14 Typically,  nongovernment  organizations  and  CBOs  recover  the  costs  through  collection  fees  and  do  not  need \nmunicipal subsidies. The project will support introduction of better contractual agreements and selection processes. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Strengthened Municipal Management and Capacity \n\n \n18. \nThe  project  will  support  municipal  capacity  building  in  the  areas  of  property  tax \ncollection, public participation, and urban planning. Public participation will be ensured through \ncitizens\u2019 committees with broad representation, including women and the poor. The program will \nbuild on lessons learned from the UGIIP\u2014that effective improvement of municipal management \nis best achieved when capacity development programs are combined with rigorous performance \nmonitoring and performance-based fund allocation. The capacity development programs will be \naligned with activities to meet the performance criteria.  \n \n19. \nPourashavas that were covered by the UGIIP have developed sufficient capacity in core \nareas,  and  the  capacity  development  program  will  focus  on  sustaining  these  achievements.  It \nwill  boost  capacity  in  other  areas  such  as  tax  assessment,  human  resource  management, \npublic\u2013private  partnerships,  and  energy  efficiency.  Pourashavas  that  were  not  covered  by  the \nUGIIP will start with core training programs established under the UGIIP, such as tax collection, \ncitizen  participation,  and  urban  planning.  City  corporations  and  urban  centers  will  start  with  a \npilot program in selected areas. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nTable 1 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM). \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $170.00 million.

The \ngovernment has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR76,894,000 from the \nSpecial Funds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help finance the project. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an  interest charge of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The ADB loan of SDR 76,894,000 or 71% of \nthe  project  cost  will  be  used  to  finance  part  of  the  civil  works  and  recurrent  costs;  and  all \nequipment,  vehicles,  and  consulting  services.  The  government  will  provide  $50.0  million  to \ncover the cost of land acquisition, taxes and duties, and part of civil works and recurrent costs. \nThe  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nand the German development cooperation through KfW are considering providing collaborative \ncofinancing,  which  will  be  added  during  the  project  implementation  upon  their  formal \ncommitment.  \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount \n($ million) \n120.00 \n50.00 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n170.00 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n70.59 \n\n29.41 \n\n100.00 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n22. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM.

It  will  (i)  review  the  current  legal  and  institutional  frameworks  of \nregional  planning  and  governance,  particularly  the  Town  Improvement  Act  (1953);  and \n(ii) propose  measures  to  streamline  and  strengthen  the  framework  by  revisiting  mandate  and \nthe  system  by  allocating  planning  and  control \nfunctions  of  RAJUK,  and  rationalize \nresponsibilities  to  the  proper  levels.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is \nestimated  at  $750,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  a  $675,000  grant  from  its  Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) and the government will make in-kind contribution to cover \nthe balance. RAJUK will be the executing agency for the TA and provide counterpart staff and \noffice  space.  A  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  implement  the  TA,  through  the  quality-  and \ncost-based  selection  method  with  a  standard  80:20  scoring  weight.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference is described in the PAM. \n \nB. \n\nEnergy Efficiency Improvement \n\n25. \nThe  TA  will  (i)  promote  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  programs  among \nmunicipalities, and (ii) carry out detailed energy audits and implement demonstration programs \nto  introduce  energy-efficient  water  pumps  and  solar-powered  streetlights.  The  results  will  be \nsummarized  in  a  best  practice  manual,  including  technical  specifications,  saved  energy  and \nCO2,  better  street  safety,  impact  of  lower  energy  costs  on  municipal  finances,  and  increased \nproperty  tax  as  a  result  of  additional  streetlights.  The  best  practice  manual  will  be  used  in \nawareness campaigns and capacity development, so that the program can be expanded under \nthe project or through other fund sources. ADB will administer the TA. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated  at  $1,700,000  equivalent,  of  which  $1,500,000  will  be  financed  by  the  Asian  Clean \nEnergy  Fund15  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility,  and  administered  by \nADB.  The  government  will  make  in-kind  contributions  to  cover  the  balance.  LGED  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency  and  provide  counterpart  staff  and  office  space  to  the  consultant  team.  The \nDepartment  of  Public  Health  Engineering  will  provide  technical  support  for  the  introduction  of \nenergy-efficient  water  pumps.  A  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  for  the  implementation  of  the \nTA, through the quality- and cost-based selection method with a standard 80:20 scoring weight. \nThe outline terms of reference is described in the PAM. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n15 Established by the Government of Japan. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  analysis is  conducted  for  sample  subprojects.  The \n26. \nestimates  of  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  range  from  20.0%  to  52.9%,  indicating \nsufficiently  high  economic  return.  The  result  is  robust  against  downside  risks,  including  higher \ncapital cost, increased operation and maintenance (O&M) cost, decreased benefits, and delays \nin project completion. The result most likely underestimates the benefits, since the projects have \nother benefits that are not easily quantifiable and are not accounted for in the analysis.   \n \n27. \nFinancial analysis. For revenue-generating subprojects, financial analysis is conducted \nby  estimating  the  incremental  costs  and  the  revenues  over  the  project\u2019s  life.  The  estimated \nfinancial  internal  rates  of  return  range  from  2.5%  to  7.9%  and  compare  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital estimated at 0.9%. Sensitivity analysis with respect to changes \nin  cost  and  revenue  assumptions  confirms  the  financial  viability  and  the  robustness  against \nthese  downside  risks.  The  assessment  of  water-supply  subprojects  shows  that  an  affordable \ntariff  can  recover  O&M  costs  and  debt  service.16  For  nonrevenue-generating  subprojects,  the \nanalysis focuses on the municipalities' financial capacity to meet the recurrent costs of operating \nand  maintaining  the  developed  physical  assets  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  overall  financial \nposition of each pourashava is projected, reflecting the incremental capital, O&M expenditures, \nrevenue through user charges, and debt service. The projected financial position confirms their \nfinancial  capacity  to  meet  O&M  costs  and  other  requirements  to  sustain  facilities  developed \nunder the project.   \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\n28. \nThe  LGED  and  most  implementing  agencies  have  experience  in  managing  ADB \nprojects, and staff were trained under those projects. The project will provide further training to \nstrengthen  their  capacity,  including  financial  management,  procurement,  and  safeguard \nmeasures.  Financial  management  assessments  concluded  that  the  LGED\u2019s  and  implementing \nagencies\u2019  financial  management  systems  are  satisfactory,  with  adequate  procedures  and \nstandard  of  fund  flow,  accounting,  reporting,  and  audit.  The  capacity  of  the  LGED  and \nimplementing agencies to carry out proper procurement has been assessed as satisfactory. The \nLGED  and  most  implementing  agencies  have  procurement  experience  in  accordance  with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), and their performance so \nfar  has  been  satisfactory.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nCitizen  participation.  Major  social  issues  in  pourashavas  include  weak  participation \nand representation of citizens\u2014particularly the poor and women\u2014in pourashava management. \nThe UGIIP strengthened citizen participation through the formation of citizens\u2019 committees with \nbroad  representation.  The  project  will  build  on  the  UGIIP,  and  holding  regular  meetings  of \ncitizens\u2019 committees will be one of the performance criteria for funding. Municipal management, \nincluding selection and design of subprojects as well as urban planning, will be discussed at the \ncitizens\u2019 committees to ensure broad public participation. \n                                                 \n16 Revenue-generating subprojects, including water-supply subprojects,  will be funded by 50% grant and 50% loan. \n\nThe loan will have a 4% interest rate with a 20-year repayment period and a 5-year grace period. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n \n30. \nGender. A gender action plan has been developed for the project. The project will help \nreduce  gender  inequality  by  ensuring  that  women\u2019s  participation  in  pourashava  management \nthrough  citizens\u2019  committees  and  consultations  on  urban  planning  reaches  at  least  30%. \nWomen will have equal opportunity to participate in project-supported training programs. Efforts \nto reduce wage inequality between men and women, and ensure core labor standards will be in \nplace. Awareness-raising campaigns will include women, and they will also be involved in water \nuser groups and CBOs for solid-waste management. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironmental safeguards. The project is classified as category B in accordance with \n31. \nADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  LGED  prepared \ninitial  environmental \nexaminations  of sample  subprojects,  including  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs).  The \ninitial environmental examinations, which will be updated during detailed design, conclude that \nno  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  and  that  the  subprojects  would \nhave only small, localized impacts to be mitigated through measures outlined in the EMPs. The \nEMPs  will  be  implemented  by  the  PIUs  and  monitored  by  the  PMCU.  Implementation \narrangements  ensure  that  the  PMCU  and  PIUs  have  adequate  capacity  to  manage \nenvironmental  impacts  through  consultants\u2019  support  and  capacity  building.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  was  also  prepared  to  guide  environmental  assessment  in \nsubsequent  subprojects.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  outlines \nrequirements  for  project  screening,  classification,  environmental  criteria  for  selection  of \nsubprojects, information disclosure, consultation, environmental assessment, development and \nimplementation  of  an  EMP,  and  monitoring  and  reporting.  Improvements  to  sanitation,  solid-\nwaste management, drainage, and roads will have significant positive environmental impacts in \nthese municipalities.  \n \n32. \nSocial safeguards. The project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement \nand category C for indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement. \nInvoluntary resettlement impacts are not considered significant. Most land parcels are owned by \nlocal  governments;  however,  some  subprojects  require  minor  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement  involving  either  physical  or  economic  displacement,  or  temporary  restrictions  to \nland  use.  Draft  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  sample  subprojects  to  ensure \ncompliance with the government's and ADB's policy requirements, and to provide entitlements \nfor  affected  persons,  including  special  assistance  measures  for  vulnerable  groups.  A \nresettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  for  future  subprojects  that  details  screening  and \ncategorization, assessment, planning, institutional arrangements and processes to be followed. \nThe  PMCU  will  ensure  that  the  PIUs  will  update  the  resettlement  plans  during  the  detailed \ndesign  stage,  if  required,  and  implement  the  final  resettlement  plans.  Considering  the  urban \nlocations of these subprojects, no impacts on indigenous peoples are expected. Implementation \narrangements  ensure  that  the  PMCU  and  PIUs  have  adequate  capacity  to  manage  social \nimpacts through consultants\u2019 support and capacity building. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. Risks are relatively low \nand  mitigated  to  a  manageable  level.  The benefits  and  impacts  of  the  project  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs and risks. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRapid urban growth \nbeyond expectation \n\nRisks \nIneffective coordination \nbetween the LGED \n(executing agency) and \nimplementing agencies \nInadequate capacity of \nimplementing agencies \n\nMitigating Measures \nA  steering  committee  will  be  established  with  stakeholders  in  central \ngovernment  and  municipalities.

Review  and  update  of \ncoordination in selecting subprojects for coherent regional development.  \nNeed  for  additional  staff  is  identified  and  the  government  assured  early \nassignment.  Adequate  staffing  of  the  implementing  agency  is  one  of  the \nperformance criteria before subprojects can start. Some staff were trained \nunder the previous project, and those who do not have adequate capacity \nwill be trained under the project. \nThe subprojects in the initial phase will address immediate needs, and the \nupdated  DMDP  will  facilitate  identification  and  prioritization  of  subsequent \nsubprojects. \nMany  municipalities  have  improved  local  tax  collection  through  the \nprevious project, and the proposed project will expand the program to new \nmunicipalities.  The  proposed  user  charges  were  found  affordable,  and \nfurther consultations will be held before introducing new charges.  \nSmall-scale demonstration programs will be implemented and documented \nto  clarify  benefits \nfollowed  by  public  awareness \nprograms. \n\nSustainability of \nsubprojects undermined \nby constrained financial \nresources \nLack of interest in \nwidening innovative \nsubprojects \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DMDP  =  Dhaka  Metropolitan  Development  Plan,  LGED  =  Local  Government \nEngineering Department. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nfor  municipalities, \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n34. \nThe  government  and  the  LGED  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  the \nPAM  and  loan  documents.  The  government  and  the  LGED  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement.  As  conditions  to  the \ndisbursement,  the  government  will  (i)  establish  the  interministerial  steering  committee  and  the \nPMCU, and (ii) appoint the project director and the deputy project directors for the PMCU. \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR76,894,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  City \nRegion Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n20 October 2010\n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nAppendix 1         11 \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nInvestment climate \nsurvey \nDirectorate General of \nHealth Services  \nProject completion \nreport by LGED \n\nQuarterly progress \nreports by PMCU \nQuarterly progress \nreports by PIUs \nResults of citizen \nperception survey \nreports \n \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\nAssumption \nRealization of other \ndevelopment projects \nin line with DMDP   \nRisk \nStability of local \nenvironment  \n\nAssumptions \nSubprojects are \ndesigned and \nimplemented. \n \nMunicipalities \ngenerate sufficient \nand sustained \nrevenue for O&M. \n \nSpeed and direction \nof urban growth is \nnot too different from \nthe projection in the \ndesign stage. \n\n \n\nRisks \nSkilled staff is not \nrecruited or retained \nin municipalities. \nTariff and charges \nrequired for O&M are \nnot affordable or \nsocially acceptable. \n \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \n \nImpact   \n \nEnhanced growth \npotential and \nenvironmental \nsustainability \n\nOutcome \n \nImproved urban \nenvironment and \ninfrastructure \nservices based \non effective \nregional and \nurban planning \n\n \nPerformance Targets with Baseline \nIndicators \n\n \n(Targets are average of the target areas by \n2015, unless otherwise noted.) \nImproved investment climate and expansion \nof local business (10% of annual growth of \nemployment) \nReduction  of  water-related  diseases  (20% \nreduction  of  malaria  incidence  from  0.63 \nincidence /1000 population by 2020) \n(Targets are total or average of the target \nareas by 2015, unless otherwise noted.) \nWater supply  \nShare of population with access to improved \nwater supply (from 35% to 60%) \nSanitation \nShare of wastewater treated properly (from \n5% to 40%)  \nShare of population with access to improved \nsanitation facilities (from 5% to 40%)  \nSolid waste management \nShare of solid waste disposed properly \n(from 20% to 70%)  \nShare of population with access to improved \nsolid-waste management (from 20% to \n70%)  \nUrban transport \nIncidence of traffic accidents (30% \nreduction, including those involving women \nand children) \nDrainage \nIncidence of serious water logging and \nfloods (30% reduction) \nEnergy efficiency \nSaved energy (2,000 MW per year) \nSaved energy costs (30% reduction)  \nAdditional property tax revenues due to \nadditional streetlights (25% increase) \nUrban planning \nUpdated Dhaka Metropolitan Development \nPlan implemented from 2013 \nMunicipal management \nNumber of pourashavas in compliance with \nkey UGIAP activities (all pourashavas) \n(Targets are total or average of the target \nareas by 2015, unless otherwise noted.) \nWater supply \nAdditional production capacity (108 MLD)  \nNumber of additional households (202,000), \n \n \n\n \n\nOutputs  \n \n1.
