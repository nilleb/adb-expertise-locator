An initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nundertaken and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n \nThe  Project  will  promote  sustainable  urban  development  in  the \nselected nine urban growth nodes surrounding Kathmandu Valley \nby \nenvironmental \ninfrastructure/service  improvement  needs.  To  achieve  that  goal, \ntraining  activities  for  institutional  capacity  building  and  revenue \nimprovement will first be provided for the relevant municipal staffs. \nThen,  a  number  of  capital  investments  in  essential  urban  and \nenvironmental infrastructure and facilities will be implemented. At \nthe same time, public health awareness campaigns and sanitation \neducation  programs  will  be  carried  out  at  the  community  level  in \nthe  participating  towns.  The  Project  will  also  provide  overall \nproject implementation assistance. \n \nRapid  urbanization  is  taking  place  in  Nepal  through  significant \nrural-to-urban  migration.  Population  growth  rates  in  the  58 \ndesignated urban areas, especially those in the central region, are \nas  high  as  7%  per  annum,  which  is  roughly  three  times  the \naverage  national  population  growth  rate  of  2.3%  per  annum. \nNepal\u2019s  population  density  of  around  600  persons  per  square \nkilometer of arable land, which is one of the highest in the world, \nexceeds the carrying capacity of the rural areas. As a result of the \nrapid  population  growth  in  the  urban  areas,  serious  urban \nenvironmental issues are emerging, including inadequate drinking \nwater  supply;  haphazard  disposal  of  solid  waste  and  human \nwaste,  which \nis  causing  various  pollution  problems;  and \nuncontrolled  urban/physical  development.  To  date,  the  existing \ncentralized  public  administration  system has failed to respond to \nthese urban management challenges. To address this institutional \nfailure,  the  Government  is  now  starting  a  serious  effort  to \ndecentralize urban management. This Project is the Government's \nfirst  step  in  realizing  this  decentralization  policy.  The  Project  will \nalso address the issues of disparities between Kathmandu Valley \nand  areas  outside  the  valley,  and  help  mitigate  the  increasing \ntrend  of  reverse  to  the  capital  region,  with  all  its  negative \nenvironmental and social consequences. \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironmental \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fObjectives and Scope  \n\n iv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Project intends to bring about sustainable urban development \nin  the  nine  urban  areas  outside  Kathmandu  Valley  by  improving \nessential  urban  and  environmental  infrastructure  and  services, \nand  strengthening  the  relevant  institutions.  As  a  result  of  the \nProject,  personal  hygiene,  environmental  sanitation  and  overall \nquality of life are expected to improve in these areas. \n \nThe Project will have five main components: \n\nA.  municipal \n\ninstitutional \n\nstrengthening  and \n\nrevenue \n\nmobilization, \n\nB.  provision of urban and environmental infrastructure, \nC.  provision of supplementary urban facilities, \nD.  community development, and \nE.  project implementation assistance. \n\nRelevant  municipal  staffs  will \nfor \ninstitutional  capacity  building  and  revenue  improvement  under \ncomponent A.  Under component B, the Project will finance major \ninfrastructure improvements in five subsectors: \n\nfirst  go \n\nthrough \n\ntraining \n\nsanitation and wastewater management, \n\nroad,  drainage,  and  water  supply \n\nB (i) \nB (ii)  water supply, \nB (iii)  neighborhood \ndevelopment, \n\nB (iv)  river training, and \nB (v) \n\nroad upgrading. \n\nThese  major  infrastructure  improvements  are  complemented  by \nimprovements  to  supplementary  urban  facilities  in  component  c, \nwhich has two subcomponents: \n\nC (i) \nC (ii) \n\nsmall urban community facilities, and \nrevenue-generating urban facilities. \n\nfor \n\nis  encouraged \n\nFinancing  for  these  supplementary  urban  facilities,  which  are \nsmall  compared  with  those  in  component  B,  will  be  carried  out \nthrough  the  Town  Development  Fund  (TDF).  Public-private \npartnership \nthis  component.  Under \ncomponent D,  various  health  awareness  campaigns  and \nsanitation education programs will be carried out at the community \nlevel  in  the  participating  towns.  Under  component  E,  overall \nproject implementation assistance will be provided. \n \nAdditionally,  the  Project  will  be  linked  to  two  parallel  schemes. \nOne  scheme  will  promote  rural-urban  partnership,  which  will \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  not  only  in  the  main  urban  areas \nbut  also  in  the  surrounding  rural  areas  within  the  municipalities. \nThe other scheme will address the solid waste management issue \nby  promoting  composting.  Funding  for  the  parallel  schemes  is \nbeing arranged separately. \n \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nis  $37.50  million  equivalent, \nThe  estimated  project  cost \ncomprising foreign exchange costs of $12.62 million (33.7%) and \nlocal currency costs of $24.88 million equivalent (66.3%). \n \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \nPercent \n\n12.62 \n\n17.38 \n\n30.00 \n\n80.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.40 \n\n4.40 \n\n3.10 \n\n3.10 \n\n11.7 \n\n8.3 \n\n \n\nSource \n\nAsian \nDevelopment \nBank \n\nGovernment \n\nProject Town/ \nCommunity/ \nPrivate Sector \nParticipation \n\nTotal \n \n\n12.62 \n\n24.88 \n\n37.50 \n\n100.0 \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  SDR22,699,000  ($30  million  equivalent)  from  ADB's \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided. The loan will have a 32-\nyear term including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate \ncharge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter. \n \nMunicipalities  are  required  to  provide  up-front counterpart funds. \nBy  relending  a  portion  of  the  ADB  loan  (SDR7,285,000),  the \nGovernment  will  provide  the  municipalities  with  some  matching \ngrant  funds  whose  amount/percentages  are  primarily  determined \nby  the  subsector  concerned.  The  Government  will  provide  the \nbalance  for  the  municipalities  in  the  form  of  loans. The loans will \nhave an interest rate of 8% per annum with a 20-year repayment \nperiod  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  In  parallel,  the \nGovernment will relend a portion of the ADB loan (SDR2,562,000) \nto the TDF with an interest rate of 5% per annum with a 20-year \nrepayment  period  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  The  TDF \nwill  onlend  the  funds  to  the  municipalities  with  an  interest  rate  of \n8%  per  annum  and  a  12-15  year  repayment  period  including  a \ngrace  period  of  3  years.

It will discharge its duties \nthrough  its  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Building \nConstruction (DUDBC), which will establish a project coordination \noffice  (PCO)  for  the  Project.  The  nine  participating  municipalities \n(including one prospective municipality of Dhadingbesi) will be the \nImplementing Agencies (IAs) for the majority of the subprojects. \nImplementation at the municipal level will be managed using one \nof  two  possible  models:  the  project  advisor  (PA)  model  and  the \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  model.  The  PA  model  is \npreferred  by \nrelatively  advanced \ninstitutional  capabilities  (Bharatpur  and  Hetauda),  while  the  PIU \nmodel  is  preferred  by  the  remaining  six  municipalities  whose \ninstitutional  capabilities  are  still  weak.  The  PA  model  envisages \nthat  the  municipal  administration  will  essentially  be  in  charge  of \nimplementation management, assisted by a PA without executive \nfunction. The PIU model envisages that a PIU will be formed and \nstaffed  by  the  EA,  and  will  assume  the  executive  function  for \nmanaging  implementation,  subject  to  general  guidance  from  the \nmunicipality  concerned.  Considering \nlimited  personnel \nresources at DUDBC, from which secondment staff will be drawn \nfor PAs/PIUs, a staggered implementation schedule will be used. \n \nMPPW \n \nAll  procurement  under \nin \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Contracts for \ncivil works estimated to cost $1.0 million equivalent or more will be \n(ICB) \ncarried  out  using \nprocedures,  while  those  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1.0  million \nequivalent  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding \n(LCB)  procedures.  Goods  to  be  procured  will  preferably  be \ngrouped  into  packages  of  $500,000  equivalent  or  more  to  be \nsuitable  for  ICB  procedures.  Contracts  for  miscellaneous  minor \ngoods  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be \nprocured  through  international  shopping  (IS)  procedures.  Minor \nitems estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per contract \nmay be purchased directly, following proper procedures. \n \nConsulting  services  of  29  person-months  (international)  and  747 \nperson-months (domestic) are planned. All consulting services will \nbe selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and/or other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n\ninternational  competitive  bidding \n\nthe  Project  will  be  carried  out \n\n\fProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nvii\n\nlocal \n\ninstitutions, \n\nthe  participating \n\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  the  urban  population  of  about \n320,000 in the selected nine urban areas with  improved personal \nhygiene,  environmental  sanitation,  and  overall  quality  of  life.  In \nparticular,  the  EIRRs  for  the  water  supply  subprojects  are \nestimated  to  be  around  22-28%.  The  management  and  financial \ncapacities  of \nincluding \nmunicipalities  and  prospective  water  supply  utilities  under \nmunicipal  control,  will  be  strengthened  for  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment.  Furthermore,  the  regional  integration  of  water \nsupply  services  for  improved  efficiency  will  be  pioneered  for  a \ncluster  of  a  few  neighboring  urban  areas.  Thus,  the  Project  is \nexpected to contribute to the Government's decentralization policy \nfor  better  governance  and  improvements  to  the  framework  for \npublic-private partnership. \n \nThe  main  risks  include  the  (i)  limited  capacities  of  the  municipal \ngovernment  staff;  (ii)  uncertainty  regarding  continued  political \nsupport  for  decentralization  with  sufficient  administrative  budget \nallocation/transfer;  (iii)  uncertainty  regarding  continued  municipal \nrevenue \nthe \ntime, \nlocal  communities \nwillingness  of \ncounterpart funds, and other resources for project implementation. \nTo  mitigate  most  of  these  risks,  sufficient  measures  have  been \nincorporated in the Project in the form of various training activities \nand community education/awareness campaigns. \n\nimprovement;  and \n\n(iv)  uncertainty \n\nto  contribute \n\nregarding \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nKERUNG (TIBET) \nLINKAGE POINT TO CHINA \n\nKHASA (TIBET) \nLINKAGE POINT TO CHINA \n\n \n\nv\n\ni\ni\ni\n \n\nDHADINGBESI \n\nBIDUR \nMARKET CENTRE/TRADE/  \nCOMMERCE/TOURISM \n \n \n\nTRADE-INFOTECH \nEDUCATION  \nTRANSPORT  \n \n\n20km  \n\n24km\n\n70km  \n\nNOUBISE  \n\n \n\nBANEPA \n26km  \n\n6km \n\nMARKET \nCENTRE/ \nAGRO-TRADE \n\nMUGLING \n\nMALEKHU \n\nGALCHI \n\nRATNANAGAR  \nMARKET CENTER \nAGRO-INDUSTRY  \nTOURISM \n77 km  \n\nPANAUTI \n\nMARKET CENTRE  \nTOURISM-CULTURE  \n \n\nKATHMANDU \nVALLEY \n\nHETAUDA \nINDUSTRY  \nMARKET CENTRE  \nVOCATIONAL EDUCATION \n \n\n29km  \n\nSIMARA \n\nEAST-WEST HIGHWAY \n \n \n109km \n\n26km  \n \n \n \n \nBIRGANJ  \n \n\n2km \n\nRAKSAUL (INDIA) \nLINKAGE POINT TO INDIA \n\nBHIMESHWOR \n\n KODARI \n\n122km  \n\nDHULIKHEL \nTOURISM \nEDUCATION \nHEALTH \n \n\n122km  \n\nKAMALAMAI \nMARKET CENTRE \nTRADE/COMMERCE \n\n \n\n38km  \n\nDHALKEBAR\n\nBARDIBAS \n\n19km  \n\nJANAKPUR \n\nSITAMAD (INDIA) \nLINKAGE POINT TO INDIA \n\n \n\nS\nt\nr\na\nt\ne\ng\ni\nc\n \nE\nc\no\nn\no\nm\ni\nc\n \nL\nn\nk\na\ng\ne\ns\n \no\nf\n \n\ni\n\nI\n\n \n\nU\nE\nP\nT\no\nw\nn\ns\n \n\nPOKHARA \n\n \n\n157km  \n\nBUTWAL \n\nEAST-WEST HWY \n \n113km \n\nBHARATPUR \nINDUSTRY  \nTRADE \nCOMMERCE \nHEALTH \nTOURISM \n(RELIGIOUS) \nTRANSPORT  \n\n22km \n\nBHAIRAWA \n\n4km \n\nSUNAULI (INDIA) \nLINKAGE POINT TO INDIA \n\n \n\nHighway \n \nRoad in Poor Condition \n \nSecondary Route \n \nPlanned Route \n \nUEIP Town \n \nNode Town \n \nFuture Agglomeration \n\n\f  \n\n \n\nI\n\nX\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Urban and Environmental Improvement Project. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES 1 \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nTo  date,  Nepal  is  still  one  of  the  least  urbanized  countries  in  Asia,  with  approximately \n14%  of  its  total  population  of  about  23  million  people  (Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  Preliminary \nResult  of  Population  Census  2001)  living  in  58  designated  urban  areas.  Even  so,  the  pace  of \nurbanization has increased markedly in the last two decades, with the urban population growing \nat up to 7% per annum, which is roughly three times the average national population growth rate \n(2.3% per annum). The reason for rapid urbanization is mainly the population pressure in rural \nareas: Nepal\u2019s population density of around 600 persons per square kilometer of arable land is \none of the highest in the world and exceeds the carrying capacity of the rural areas. This results \nin deforestation, environmental degradation, poverty, and, eventually, migration to urban areas. \nWhile Nepal\u2019s total population is expected to reach about 30 million by the year 2011, its urban \npopulation  by  then  will  have  risen  to  about  6.8  million,  or  approximately  23%  of  the  total \npopulation.  Over  the  last  two  decades,  the  industry  and  services  sector  with  predominantly \nurban  activities  has  grown  by  an  average  of  6.4%  per  annum,  which  is  slightly  less  than  the \ngrowth  of  the  urban  population.  In  other  words,  urban  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  has \nbeen more or less stagnant. About 25% of urban-based employment is estimated to be in the \ninformal sector. \n\n3. \nThe  rapid  growth  of  the  urban  sector,  coupled  with  the  inability  of  the  Government  to \nkeep pace with the demand for infrastructure and services for urban population, has caused the \nemergence of a number of urban environmental issues, especially in the central region of Nepal. \nUrban  land  is  polluted  due  to  the  absence  of  urban  services,  haphazard  disposal  of  human \nwaste,  uncontrolled  growth,  haphazard  physical  development,  and  institutional  failure  to \nrespond to these challenges. The lack of adequate sanitation facilities often leads to pollution of \nsurface  water  and  groundwater.  Major  polluting  industries,  such  as  tanneries,  sugar,  paper, \ncanning,  cement,  brewery,  and  pharmaceutical  industries,  are  invariably  located  in  or  near \nurban areas and often dispose of their industrial waste, including toxic waste, to roadside drains \nand open spaces. Also, disposal of hospital waste, which can be hazardous, does not appear to \nbe properly controlled. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nPiped  water  supply  covers  only  a  small  portion  of  urban  residents,  and  the  supply  is \n4. \nusually  not  continuous  but  intermittent.  About  one  in  three  households  faces  a  serious  water \nshortage at least once a year, and about one in six all year round. Water quantity delivered is \nmostly below 50 litres per capita per day (lcd). In addition, water quality often falls below World \nHealth  Organization  standards  for  drinking  water,  mainly  due  to  bacteriological contamination \ncaused  by  poor  sanitation  facilities.  Only  about  three  quarters  of  the  urban  population  have \naccess to proper sanitation facilities. On-site sanitation systems, such as septic tanks, are not a \nviable  option  especially  for  densely  populated  core  town  areas.  Sewerage  systems,  often \ncombined with storm water drainage systems, exist in a number of urban areas; however, their \n\n                                                 \n1   See  also  Nepal  Urban  Development  Sector  Study;  Water  Supply,  Urban  Development  and  Housing  Division. \n\nDecember 2001. \n\n\f 2\n\ncoverage  is  limited,  and  final  treatment  of  the  sewage  is  often  inadequate,  if  not  totally \nnonexistent.  As  a  result,  rivers  in  urban  areas  have  often  practically  become open sewers, \nespecially in upland towns during the dry season. In contrast, urban areas located in lowlands \noften experience health hazards during the rainy season when flooding and rising groundwater \ntables render the existing wastewater disposal systems ineffective. Overall, these deficiencies of \nurban  and  environmental  infrastructure  and  services  pose  a  serious  threat  to  health  and \nsanitation of the residents.  \n\nTo  address  these  critical  urban  environmental issues,  the Government  and  the  Asian \n5. \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  on  5  November  1999  to \nlaunch technical assistance (TA) with the objective of preparing a project to improve the urban \nenvironment in 6-10 towns in the central region of Nepal.2 Project preparation was then carried \nout  for  the  nine  selected  towns,  which  are  now  included  in  the  proposed  Project,  through \nintensive  participatory  processes  involving  municipal  officials  and  other  stakeholders.  The \nproject  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  Minutes  of  two  key  workshops  can  be  found  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. Further, intensive workshops were conducted in each project town, \ninvolving numerous participants from outside the bureaucracy. \n\n6. \nNepal\u2019s  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  (1987-1992)  included  some  urban  policy  components \nfor the first time (Appendix 2). During that period, the urban institutional framework was created \nfor  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Physical  Planning  (now  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and \nWorks  [MPPW]),  Nepal  Water  Supply  Corporation  (NWSC),  Urban  Development  Training \nCentre  (UDTC),  and  town  development  committees  (TDC)  in  each  municipality.  During  the \nEighth  Five-Year  Plan  (1992-1997), the Town Development Fund (TDF) was established. The \nrole,  past  performance,  and  assessment  of  the  TDF  is  elaborated  in  Appendix  3.  Also, \namendments  to  the  Town  Development  Act  were  passed.  This  Act,  which  is  summarized  in \nAppendix  4,  enables  a  local  body  to  conduct  guided  land  development  (GLD)  and/or  land \npooling projects. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002), the Local Self-Governance Act \nand the Nepal Water Supply Regulation were passed. The proposed Project, which reflects the \nGovernment's  urban  policies  elaborated  in  Appendix  2,  will  be  the  first  decentralized  urban \ndevelopment  project,  except  for  the  earlier  Kathmandu  Urban  Development  Project,  which \ncovered only the capital city. \n\n7. \nIn the water supply and sanitation sector, the Government's policy emphasizes municipal \nresponsibility  in  line  with  its  decentralization  policy.  Various  principles  including  (i)  demand-\ndriven  approach;  (ii) \ninvolvement; \n(iv) integration of water supply and sewerage in urban areas; (v) cost recovery of 50% of capital \ninvestments, which is a transitional arrangement toward full cost recovery, and 100% of O&M in \nurban  areas;  and  (vi)  importance  of  establishing  an  independent  regulatory  body  are  also \nrecommended. The policy is summarized in Appendix 5. \n\ninstitutional  development;  (iii)  user \n\nimportance  of \n\n8. \nUntil 1999, the  octroi  tax  was  the  main  source  of  urban  revenue,  comprising  typically \nabout  65%  of  a  municipality\u2019s  own-source  revenue.  That  tax  has  since  been  replaced  by  the \nlocal  development  tax,  which  is  a  1.5%  levy  charged  on  all  imports  and  distributed  to  the \nmunicipalities. This tax is meant to be a transitional solution only, and to be replaced by other \nlocal  revenue  sources  including  the  property  tax  as  the  single  most  important  component. \nProjections  for  the  future  financial  capacity  of  a  given  municipality  are  therefore  affected  by a \nconsiderable degree of uncertainty. \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1999.

More information can be found in Appendix 6. \n\n10.  Major  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  previous,  similar  projects3  in  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment in Nepal are summarized as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nComplex and multicomponent projects should be avoided where the executing \nagencies (EAs) have limited experience. Institutional capacities with respect to \nland  acquisition,  procurement  of  consultants,  etc.  should  be  thoroughly \nexplored, \nAll  stakeholders  should  be  fully  involved  in  project  identification  and  design \nfrom  an  early  stage.  In  particular,  water  user  committees  (WUCs),  if  they  are \nexpected to operate and maintain the systems, need to be established and fully \ninvolved  before \ninformation  on \nthe  start  of  physical  works.  Sufficient \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs)  active  in  the  project  area  should  be  gathered  to  facilitate  their \ninvolvement in the project, \nInstitutional strengthening should be given the greatest possible emphasis. Key \nstaff should be in place before board consideration,4 \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  Physical works should be tendered in relatively large packages to attract bigger \nand more experienced contractors. No contractor should  be allowed to bid for \nfurther packages before he has substantially completed his current project, \nLikewise, consulting services should be tendered in relatively large packages to \nattract  bigger  and  more  experienced  consultant  companies.  This  is  also  to \nreduce the workload of coordination for the EA/implementing agency (IA), \n(vi)  Advance  procurement  action,  especially  for  consulting  services,  should  be \n\nseriously considered to reduce delays at project start-up, \n\n(vii)  Project implementation scheduling should be realistic and take into account the \ntime needed for IAs to constitute themselves; for inexperienced IAs to conduct \nthe  tendering  process  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines;  for  municipalities \nand communities to provide their contributions; and foreseeable delays caused \nby a project\u2019s location, seasonal adverse weather conditions, and festivals and \nholidays. \n\n(viii)  Consulting services should be guided following interactive processes, working \nclosely  with \ntarget  groups,  producing  user-friendly  outputs,  and \nemphasizing  hands-on  advice  and  on-the-job  training  instead  of  mere \nproduction of reports, \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n3  These  lessons  learned  were  derived  from  these  previous  projects:  Kathmandu  Urban  Development  Project; \nInstitutional  Strengthening  of  Kathmandu  Metropolitan  City;  Second  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  ;  and \nThird Water Supply and Sanitation Project . \n\n4   The Asian Development Bank and the Ministry of Finance agreed in 1998 that a precondition to loan negotiations is \nthe appointment of a project manager and the establishment of a project office, including the appointment of core \nstaff. \n\n\f 4\n\n(ix)  An  appropriate  management  information  system  (MIS)  should  be  developed \nand  installed  with  the  EA,  and  realistic  and  relevant  performance  indicators \nshould be identified, \nTo  maximize  project  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  project  designs  should \nincorporate specific components that will benefit the poor, \n\n(x) \n\n(xi)  Project designs should incorporate better environmental monitoring mechanisms, \n\nincluding the collection of baseline data, \n\n(xii)  ADB  review  missions  need  to  supervise  more  closely  the  quality  of  project \nimplementation, even though some project locations may be remote. They also \nneed to focus more on institutional and social concerns, and encourage frequent \nand intensive interaction between EA, IA, and the beneficiaries. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n11. \nThe Project aims to bring about sustainable urban development in the nine urban areas \noutside  Kathmandu  Valley  by  improving  essential  urban  and  environmental  infrastructure  and \nservices,  and  strengthening  the  relevant  institutions.  As  a  result  of  the  Project,  personal \nhygiene, environmental sanitation, and overall quality of life are expected to improve in the nine \nareas. \n\n12. \nThe Project will help the Government carry out its policy of decentralization. The Project \nwill also address the issues of disparities between Kathmandu Valley and areas outside it, and \nthe  increasing  trend  of  migration  to  the  capital  region,  with  all  its  negative  environmental and \nsocial consequences. The Project will cover nine urban areas all located in the central region of \nNepal. Three are close to Kathmandu Valley (Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Panauti), two are located \nin the uplands (Bidur and Dhadingbesi), and four are in the lowlands (inner terai; i.e., Bharatpur, \nRatnanagar,  Hetauda,  and  Kamalamai).  The  populations  of  the  nine  areas  range  from  about \n12,000  to  about  89,000.  All  the  municipalities  involved  require  substantial  institutional \nstrengthening, substantial improvements to their physical infrastructure, and emphatic efforts to \nreduce  urban  poverty.  Since  this  is  the  first  decentralized  urban  project  for  Nepal,  this  rather \nconservative  choice  of  target  urban  areas,  which  are  relatively  close  to  Kathmandu,  can  be \njustified. The Project is, thus, expected to establish an important precedent for a series of similar \nprojects that could follow. \n\n13. \nCurrently,  Dhadingbesi  is  administratively  only  a  part  of  four  village  development \ncommittees  (VDCs)  but  is  being  considered  for  municipality  status  by  the  consolidating  few \nvillages.  Because  the  current  borrowing  capacity  will  not  allow  it  to  undertake  the  envisaged \ninvestments and no effective municipal administration is in place yet, it does not appear sensible \nto  start  project  activities  in  Dhadingbesi  before  the  conversion  to  municipality  status  is \ncompleted.  Therefore,  only  limited  project  activities  are  planned  in  Dhadingbesi,  and \nimplementation  will  not  start  before  a  municipality  is  formally  established.  The  TDF,  which  is \nexpected  to  provide  financing  for  all  the  subprojects  in  Dhadingbesi,  will  start  onlending  only \nwhen the municipality is established. \n\n14.  With respect to decentralization, in addition to the strengthening of the municipalities, the \nProject  is  also  expected  to  help  establish  financially  and  institutionally  self-sustainable water \nsupply  utilities  under  municipal  control  for  the  municipalities  of  Bharatpur,  Hetauda,  Banepa, \nPanauti,  and  Dhulikhel.  Furthermore,  regional  integration  of  the  water  supply  services  is \nenvisaged  for  Banepa,  Panauti,  and  Dhulikhel,  which  are  neighboring  municipalities.  Through \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nvarious  interventions  in  the  urban  infrastructure/services,  in  particular  in  the  water  supply \nsubsector,  the  Project  is  also  expected  to  contribute  to  the  improvement of the framework for \npublic-private partnership (para. 34). \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n15. \nThe  Project  will  comprise  the  following  main  components,  A - municipal  institutional \nstrengthening and revenue mobilization, B - provision of urban and environmental infrastructure, \nC - provision  of  supplementary  urban  facilities,  D - community  development,  and  E - project \nimplementation assistance. \n\n1. \n\nMunicipal \n(Component A)  \n\nInstitutional  Strengthening \n\nand  Revenue  Mobilization \n\n16. \nComponent A will cover the nine towns with a more or less uniform set of interventions, \nwhich  will  be  implemented  1-3  years  for  each  town.  Most  of  the  interventions  are  technical \ntraining,  for  municipal  staff  and  will  mostly  be  delivered  by  training  institutions  or  consultants \nselected and contracted by the project coordination office (PCO). Some interventions are meant \nto  raise  public  awareness  about  various  urban  issues  and  enlist  political  support  for  elected \nrepresentatives and local political leaders. Training will be delivered, as appropriate, to mayors, \ndeputy  mayors,  elected  representatives,  municipal  secretaries,  municipal  technical  staff \nincluding  section  and  sub-section  heads  and  senior  staff,  key  local  institutions,  elected  ward \nrepresentatives  and  staff,  the  private  sector,  and  community  representatives.  Where  possible, \ntraining  will  be  hands-on  and  performance  based,  and  linked  to  measurable  outputs  to  judge \nthat required skill levels have been achieved, and to verify that the training received is actually \nbeing  used  on  the  job.  With  the  early  establishment  of  the  project  performance  monitoring \nsystem  (PPMS),  the  municipal  institutional  strengthening,  revenue  mobilization,  and  human \nresource  department/capacity  building  programs  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  at  regular \nintervals \nthree \nsubcomponents. \n\nthe  project.  Component  A \n\nfurther  broken  down \n\nthroughout \n\ninto \n\nis \n\n17. \nSubcomponent  A (i) - general  municipal  institutional  strengthening  and  support  for \nrevenue  mobilization  is  designed  to  introduce  new  and  improved  urban  management  and \nrevenue  generation  procedures  and  practices.  Depending  on  existing  (preproject)  institutional \ncapability,  some  project  municipalities  will  receive  all  interventions  included  in  the  package, \nwhereas others will require only certain activities.  Nevertheless, some activities are mandatory \nand  will  be  given  to  all  municipalities,  irrespective  of  their  existing  institutional  capacities.  The \naim  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  raise  urban  management  and  revenue  generation  capability \nsuch that the municipalities will be able to prepare and implement action plans that respond to \ncritical needs. Specific training will be targeted at improving the revenue mobilization capacity of \nthe municipalities, through preparation of detailed urban mapping, house numbering programs, \nhouse  tax  and  customer  databases  of  various  urban  services,  and  implementing  improved \ncomputerized tax and service fee collection systems. Subcomponent A (i) will include training in \nurban  management  orientation,  organization  management,  investment  planning,  improved \nbudget  preparation,  local  area  planning,  improved  accounting,  revenue  mobilization,  contract \nmanagement and supervision, urban planning, O&M, customer client relations, public relations, \npublic-private partnerships, monitoring and evaluation, community mobilization, and community \nawareness. To support and encourage the implementation of action plans, the municipalities will \nidentify/select  various  small  urban  facilities  or  urban  service  activities  to  be  executed  as \nsubprojects.  These  can  be  funded  under  component  C  provision  of  supplementary  urban \nfacilities. \n\n\f 6\n\nSubcomponent  A (ii) - support \n\nimplementation  of  urban  and  environmental \n18. \ninfrastructure includes specific training and support for the successful implementation/operation \nof  urban  and  environmental  infrastructure  components.  It  will  cover  the  following  subsectors: \nwater supply, sewerage, sanitation, roads, drainage, land development, and river training. The \ntraining  modules  will  address,  among  other  things,  the  following  issues: O&M, cost recovery, \nuser groups, and public-private partnership. \n\nfor \n\nSubcomponent A (iii) - support for supplementary urban facilities includes training for the \n\n19. \nexecution and operation of supplementary urban facilities. \n\n2. \n\nProvision of Urban and Environmental Infrastructure (Component B) \n\nThe  component  will  cover \n\nthe  subsectors  of  B (i)  sanitation  and  wastewater \n20. \nmanagement;  B (ii)  water  supply;  B (iii)  neighborhood  road,  drainage,  and  water  supply \ndevelopment;  B (iv)  river  training;  and  B (v)  road  upgrading.  The  component  will  constitute \napproximately 60% of the project cost, and will provide a multitude of physical facilities whose \nexact  composition  will  vary  widely  from  town  to  town.  The  proposed  subprojects  have  been \nsubject to initial environmental evaluations (IEEs) and estimations of economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), where required. \n\nTo ensure that the  detailed  engineering  designs  reflect  the  views  of  the  municipalities \n21. \nand  communities,  all  design  work  will  be  carried  out  by  domestic  consultants  in  close \nconsultation  with  the  municipalities.  The  domestic  consultants  will  establish  design  (and \nsubsequently construction supervision) offices in the respective municipalities. PCO, assisted by \ntheir consultant for project implementation support, will review critical design elements and may \nhold approval of the tendering of the respective physical works contract until necessary design \nimprovements have been made. \n\nThe  sanitation  and  wastewater  management  subcomponent  will  provide  expanded \n22. \nsewerage  pipe  networks  and  a  number  of  simple  wastewater  treatment  plants  in  nine  urban \nareas.  Where  required,  the  expanded  pipe  networks  will  be  designed  for  the  combined \ncollection  of  rainwater  and  domestic  wastewater  (this  may  include  wastewater  from  small \nnondomestic sources such as cottage industries). Otherwise, the pipe network will be designed \nto  collect  only  domestic  wastewater.  The  treatment  plants  will  be  innovative,  appropriate-\ntechnology  reed  bed  treatment  plants,  in  line  with  the  least-cost  and  appropriate-technology \nphilosophy adopted here. The systems will be designed to give the urban poor adequate access \nto  improved  sanitation,  and  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  the  respective  municipalities. \nThe  expected  benefits  are  public  hygiene  and  public  health  improvements  in  the  urban  areas \nconcerned, and reduced pollution of groundwater and surface water in the vicinity. \n\nThe water supply subcomponent will basically cover five urban areas only, namely, the \n23. \nmunicipalities  of  Bharatpur,  Hetauda,  Banepa,  Panauti,  and  Dhulikhel,  the  latter  three  as \nbeneficiaries of a potential regionally integrated water supply system. It will involve development \nof new water sources, and construction of transmission lines, water treatment plants, reservoirs, \nand  distribution  networks.  In  particular,  investments  will  be  made  so  that  maximum  use  of \nexisting facilities can be achieved. The expected benefits are public hygiene and public health \nimprovements in each urban area so served. Each scheme will be designed so that the costs for \ncapital investment and O&M can be fully recovered in a sustainable manner. As an indication of \nthe existing demand for improved piped water supply services, in Kathmandu the willingness to \npay  ranges  from  $0.43/cubic  meter  (m3)  (poor  household;  upgraded  from  unconnected  to \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nshared  connection)  to  $0.86/m3  (non-poor  household;  already  connected).5  The  existing \nwillingness to pay in  Banepa, Panauti, and Dhulikhel is expected to be roughly the same, while \nthe equivalent figure in the two inner terai towns (Bharatpur and Hetauda) must be somewhat \nlower because alternative sources of well water are available. Each scheme will be designed to \nensure that the urban poor have adequate access to improved water supply physically as well \nas financially. \n\n24. \nThe  neighborhood  road,  drainage,  and  water  supply  development  subcomponent will \npromote orderly urban expansion with plot readjustment. Areas that can accommodate the high \ndemand  for  urban  growth  will  be  identified.  They  will  be  developed  in  a  proactive  and  orderly \nmanner  using  the  land  pooling  scheme  (para.  36)  to  avoid  scattered  and  haphazard  urban \nsprawl, driven entirely by uncoordinated individual efforts, which have become one of the main \nissues  of  environmental  degradation  in  Nepal.  This  subcomponent  will  not  only  reduce  the \nnegative environmental impact of urban expansion, but also increase the efficiency of providing \nurban infrastructure in the context of such proactive and orderly urban expansion. \n\n25. \nThe  river  training  subcomponent  will  be  required  in  three  urban  areas  only  (Bharatpur, \nHetauda,  and  Kamalamai).  It  will  comprise  embankment  protection  works  where  urban \nsettlements or valuable agricultural land are threatened by erosion or abrasion. \n\n26. \nActivities in the road upgrading subcomponent will be limited to surface improvements of \nexisting  roads  (excluding  realignment,  straightening,  and  widening)  so  that  no  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement  issues  will  arise  and  the  associated  negative  environmental  impact  will  be \nvirtually nil. \n\n3. \n\nProvision of Supplementary Urban Facilities (Component C) \n\n27. \nComponent  C  will  provide  C (i)  small  urban  community  facilities,  and  C (ii)  revenue-\ngenerating urban facilities, whose composition and cost will vary widely from town to town. As \nthese  urban  facilities  are  still  small  compared  with  those  in  component  B,  funding  will  be \nchanneled  through  the  TDF,  which  was  established  in  1989  to  facilitate  financing  of  urban \ninfrastructure projects in municipalities or urbanizing villages. The TDF is authorized to receive \ngrant and loan funds from the Government and other organizations, foreign Governments, and \ninternational agencies for its programs. It provides grants and loans to any institution engaged in \ntown  development  including government and nongovernment institutions, user groups, VDCs, \nand municipalities according to its investment policies and procedures. The urban facilities to be \nprovided  under  this  component  will  be  identified  with  intensive  community  participation  during \nimplementation  (Appendix  3).  Detailed  engineering  design  and  construction  supervision  for \nsubprojects under this component will be carried out by the same domestic consultants from the \ndesign and construction supervision office to be established in each municipality. \n\n28. \nSmall urban community facilities will include public toilets, public waste collection points, \nimprovements to public places and to places of worship, improvements to  neighborhood lanes, \nsports grounds, and small public recreation parks. \n\nRevenue-generating  urban  facilities  will  be  established  mostly  with  private  sector \nterminals,  bus/truck  parks,  marketplaces,  small \n\n29. \nparticipation  and  will \nslaughterhouses, cold storage facilities, recreational facilities, and vocational training centers. \n\ninclude  bus \n\n30. \nDhadingbesi  is  currently  only  a  part  of  four  VDCs  administratively  but  it  is  being \nconsidered  for  municipality  status  through  the  consolidation  of  a  few  villages.  For  this  reason, \nfund channeling to Dhadingbesi under the Project will be all through the TDF instead of directly \nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  under  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement.  The  TDF  is  not \n\n                                                 \n5  RTI study: Willingness to Pay for Improved Water Supply in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, August 2001. \n\n\f 8\n\nexpected  to  start  its  onlending  for  any  of  the  subprojects  in  Dhadingbesi,  under  both \ncomponents B and C, until a municipality has formally been established. \n\n4. \n\nCommunity Development (Component D) \n\nCcomponent D will consist mainly of public health awareness campaigns and education \n31. \nprograms, in particular targeting women. These campaigns and programs will be implemented \nmore or less uniformly in all urban areas so as to mobilize the local communities. Local NGOs \nwill be contracted to implement them. The component consists of D (i) mass communication and \ndemonstration of public health awareness campaigns involving the production of materials such \nas posters, folders, leaflets, storybooks, and spots on the local radio and TV; D (ii) public health \neducation  programs  confined  to  the  community  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Community \nDevelopment Subsection of the Environment and Community Development Section; and D (iii) \nschool  public  health  education  programs  confined  to  the  urban  school  system  where \nrehabilitation and construction of school sanitation facilities will be undertaken under the Project. \n\n32. \nIn Component D, the project town staff, representatives of CBOs, and women's groups \n(WGs) to be formed will be trained to undertake educational functions for the community in the \nareas  of  public  health.  Each  project  town  will  have  an  Environment  and  Community \nDevelopment  Section,  with  overall  responsibility  for  public  health  awareness  campaigns  and \neducation programs. This section, in turn, will direct the Community Development Subsection to \norganize the community and conduct these campaigns and programs in close collaboration with \nthe  ward  committees  (WCs),6  NGOs, WGs, and representative leaders of the community. The \nrepresentative  leaders  will  function  as  an  important  link  between  the  community,  Environment \nand  Community  Development  Section,  and  WCs.  More  details  on  social  strategy  are  in \nAppendix 7. \n\n5. \n\nProject Implementation Assistance (Component E) \n\nComponent  E  comprises  various  consulting  service  assignments  and  incremental \n33. \nadministration  costs.  The  required  consulting  services  include  E (i)  support  for  the  project \nimplementation  management  at  PCO,  including  the  development  and  implementation  of  the \nproject  performance  management  system  (PPMS),  international  and  local;  E (ii)  advice  and \nsupport  for  institutional  reforms,  technical  arrangements,  and  tendering  for  the  water  supply \nsystem   improvements at  the  five  municipalities  that  will  have  a  water  supply  subcomponent,7 \ninternational  and  local;  E (iii)  assistance  to  project  advisors/project  implementation  units \n(PAs/PIUs) in supporting the municipalities, local; and E (iv) a pool of short-term experts at the \ndisposal of the PCO, local. \n\n34. \nUnder  subcomponent  B (ii),  each of the  five  municipalities,  MPPW,  and  NWSC  as the \nowner of the existing  urban  water  supply  system  must  agree  on  the  arrangements  for  capital \ninvestment  project  management  as  well  as  subsequent  operational  arrangements  for  the \nresulting  water  supply  system  before  awarding  the  relevant  civil  works  contracts .  The \nGovernment policy of gradually transferring the authority to manage water supply from NWSC to \nlocal  governments  must  be  followed.  At  the  latest,  each  municipality  must  assume  full \nresponsibility8 for the water supply service by the time the  resulting water supply system starts \n\n                                                 \n6   As defined in the Local Self Governance Act (1999), the ward committee is a group of elected representatives at \n\nward level (a ward is a geographic and administrative subunit of a municipality). \n\n7   Banepa, Panauti, Dhulikhel, Bharatpur, and Hetauda. \n8   Each municipality  must  choose  an  appropriate  form  of  management.  Potential  forms  include  establishment  of \n(financially independent) municipal water supply department, contracting out to private operator, contracting out to \ngovernment operator (such as NWSC), delegating responsibility to water user groups, and a combination thereof. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nits operations. To guide the five municipalities in carrying out the necessary institutional reform \nprocesses,  action  steps  have  been  elaborated  for  Bharatpur  and  Hetauda  (individual  scheme) \nand  for  Banepa,  Panauti,  and  Dhulikhel  (regional  scheme  (para.  35 has more information), in \nSupplementary  Appendix  B  Revisions  to  Water  Supply  Schemes.  Furthermore,  to  address \nthese  rather  demanding  institutional  reform  exercises,  a  significant  amount  of  consulting \nservices is expected under subcomponent E (ii). The Government requested ADB's assistance \nin  identifying  potential  grant  funding  for  this  pioneering  sector  reform  initiative.  If  such  grant \nfunding has been successfully identified, this item will be dropped from the loan funding. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n35. \nSpecifically  for  Banepa,  Panauti,  and  Dhulikhel,  which  are  adjacent  to  one  another,  a \nregional  and  least-cost  approach  is  recommended  to  permit  the  construction  of  an  integrated \nwater supply system for all three municipalities. This approach will be more efficient than letting \neach  of  the  three  expand  its  existing  water  supply  system  individually.  A  neutral  party  (a \ngovernment  agency,  a  government-controlled  corporation,  a  joint  venture  among  the  three \nmunicipalities  concerned,  or  a  private  firm)  will  be  identified  and  tasked  with  physical \nimplementation  of  this  subproject.  The  eventual  operating  entity  will  then  either  operate  the \ncomplete  water  supply  system  for  the  three  municipalities,  or  act  as  a  bulk  water  supplier  to \nthem or to water user groups/committees within these municipalities, which would then handle \nlocal distribution. If a private operator is charged with operating this proposed integrated water \nsupply system, it will be advisable to establish a controlling public body, which will procure such \na private operator through a competitive, transparent bidding process. These processes will be \nsupported  by  consultants  recruited  under  the  Project  so  that  such  a  system  is  physically \nconstructed within the time frame of the Project. The regulating body, the National Water Supply \nRegulatory  Board  (NWSRB),  which  the  Government  intends  to  establish  specifically  for  the \nwater  supply  sector  in  conjunction  with  the  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project  (Loan  1820-NEP) \nwill  oversee  the  development  of  a  sustainable  water  tariff  structure  in  all  locations,  and \ncontinuously monitor and regulate the subsequent tariff revisions. \n\n36. \nThe  expected  population  growth  rates  in  the  project  towns  are  high  (e.g.,  5%  in \nBharatpur).  To  address  the  corresponding  urban  spatial  growth  demands,  land  acquisition  for \nthe  neighborhood  road,  drainage,  and  water  supply  development  subcomponent  will  be \nconducted through the mechanism of land pooling, instead of the usual straight purchase. Land \npooling,  which  was  already  implemented  under  the  Kathmandu  Urban  Development  Project \n(Loan  1240-NEP),  envisages  that  all  land  within  a  voluntarily  agreed-upon  development \nperimeter  is  temporarily  pooled  and,  later  on,  redistributed  to  the  original  owners,  after  a \nnecessary percentage of the land to be used for public purposes has been deducted. This is to \nreduce  haphazard  development  and  urban  sprawl  and  land  speculation.  The  selection  of \nperimeters to be developed under this approach is such that involuntary resettlement ultimately \nwill not occur. Procedures and requirements to be followed, including eligibility criteria based on \nexpected  public  benefits,  public  notification  and  consultation  processes,  and  financial \nrequirements are summarized in Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n37. \nIn  parallel  with  the  Project,  a  cluster  of  activities  designed  specifically  to  support  the \npoorer  groups  living  in  the  rural  farming  communities  within  the  municipalities  covered  by  the \nmain Project, is proposed. This scheme will be designed based on the UNDP-supported RUPP, \nwhich has been successfully implemented in Nepal for several years. It is expected to contribute \nto  poverty  reduction,  not  only  in  the  main  urban  areas  but  also  in  the  surrounding  rural  areas \nwithin the municipalities. Its approximate total cost of $2.2 million is expected  to be funded from \nother resources. \n\n\f 10\n\nAlso in parallel with the Project, selected activities in  the solid waste management sub-\n38. \nsector focusing on composting of biodegradable waste is proposed. Its approximate total cost of \n$1.0 million is expected to be funded from other resources. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n39. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $37.50  million  equivalent  (including  taxes \nand  duties  of  $4.38  million),  of  which  $12.62  million  (33.7%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost \nincluding  $0.78  million  in  interest  charges  during  construction,  and  $24.88  million  equivalent \n(66.3%) is the local currency cost.

The \nloan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  It  will  cover  the  entire  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  the  Project  in  the  amount  of  $12.62  million  (including  interest  and  other \ncharges amounting to $0.78 million), and will finance $17.38 million equivalent, or 69.9%, of the \nlocal currency cost. The local currency cost to be financed by ADB will cover portions of the civil \nworks,  equipment  and  vehicles,  consulting  services  and  project  management  support,  but \nexcluding  duties  and  taxes  estimated  at  $4.38  million.  ADB\u2019s  financing  of  local  currency \nexpenditure is justified by the nature of the Project, which will address local poverty and health \nissues  within  the  project  areas.  Local  currency  financing  of  $4.40  million  equivalent,  or \napproximately 11.7% of the total project cost, will be provided by the Government, and will cover \npart of the cost of civil works and consulting services, and the cost of counterpart staff required \nfor  the  proposed  central  PCO,  the  PAs,  and  the  PIUs.  The  project  towns  and  user  groups, \nincluding the private sector, will contribute $3.10 million equivalent, or around 8.3% of the total \n\n\f \n\n \nSource \nAsian \nDevelopment Bank \nGovernment \nProject Town/ \nCommunity/PSP \n\nproject  cost.

The  municipalities  and  community  will  also  provide \ncounterpart funds \u2013 for example, 8% of project capital costs in a combination of cash (at least \n5%) and in kind (no more than 3%) for water supply subprojects. The Government will bear the \nforeign  exchange  risk.  Funds  will  be  repaid  to  the  Government  according  to  terms  and \nconditions defined in the SLAs, which will need to be acceptable to ADB. \n\n\f 12\n\nFor  supplementary  urban  facilities  and  all  subprojects  in  Dhadingbesi,  the  Government \n43. \nwill relend the ADB loan to the TDF through a rupee-denominated SLA at an interest rate of 5% \nper annum with maturity of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years. The TDF will, in turn, \nonlend  the  funds  to  relevant  entities  as  subloans  at  an  interest  rate  of  8%  per  annum  with  a \nmaturity  of  12-15  years  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years.  The  Government  will  bear  the \nforeign exchange risk. The TDF may use the repayments for financing similar town projects until \nthe maturity of its borrowing from the Government. \n\n44. \nThe Government, the municipalities, TDF, and ADB will jointly review the relending and \nonlending rates every 2 years from the date of loan effectiveness to ensure that the rates are in \nline with the general economic conditions of the country. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n45.  MPPW  will  be  the  EA  for  the  Project  and  will  carry  out  its  responsibilities  for  overall \nsupervision  and  execution  of  the  project  through  its  Department  of  Urban  Development  and \nBuilding  Construction  (DUDBC).  The  EA  will  discharge  its  duties  in  overall  implementation \nmanagement  mainly  through  the  PCO  to  be  headed  by  the  PCO  director.  The  participating \nmunicipalities will be the Implementing Agencies (IA) for all subprojects. This approach is in line \nwith  the  decentralization  objectives  of  the  Local  Self  Governance  Act  of  1999  and  the  related \nbylaws, and it will encourage the municipalities to display a greater sense of ownership of their \nsubprojects. Moreover, according to a review of previous urban projects, it is important that the \nmunicipalities take a lead role to ensure the sustainable O&M of subprojects, and to strengthen \nurban management capacity. However, the overall supervision of the water supply subprojects \nto  be  built  for  the  municipalities  of  Banepa,  Dhulikhel,  and  Panauti  under  subcomponent  B (ii) \nwill be carried out in accordance with arrangements mutually acceptable to the Government and \nADB. Also, the  participating municipalities  may  discharge  their  duties  through  duly  appointed \nthird parties where required, particularly for subprojects under subcomponent C (ii). \n\nthat \n\nthe  municipal  administration9  will  essentially  be \n\n46. \nImplementation at the municipal level will be managed using one of two possible models: \nthe PA model, or the PIU model. The PA model is preferred by two municipalities with relatively \nadvanced  institutional  capabilities  (i.e.,  Bharatpur  and  Hetauda),  while  the  PIU  model  is \npreferred by the remaining municipalities whose institutional capabilities are still weak. The PA \nmodel  envisages \nin  charge  of \nimplementation  management,  headed  by  a  project  manager  and  assisted  by  a  PA  without \nexecutive  function.  The  PIU  model,  on  the  other  hand,  envisages  that  a  PIU,  headed  by  a \nproject  manager  who  is  DUDBC  staff  seconded  to  the  municipality,  will  be  established  by  the \nrespective municipality and staffed with the assistance of the EA, and that this PIU will assume \nthe  executive  function  for  implementing  the  Project,  subject  to  general  guidance  from  the \nmunicipality in question. Each PIU is expected to manage not only the main project but also the \ntwo  parallel  schemes  on  rural-urban  partnership  and  solid  waste  management.  For \nmunicipalities  that  adopt  the  PA  model,  some  additional  support  will  be  provided  either  for \nrelevant  municipal  units  or  for  the  PAs  in  order  to  help  them  manage  these  two  parallel \nschemes.  DUDBC  will  use  its  own  personnel  resources  and  enlist  the  support  of  other \ngovernment agencies, as necessary, for establishing an effective PCO as well as effective PIUs \nfor municipalities that require one. The organizational structure for implementing the Project is in \nAppendix 9. \n\n                                                 \n9   including its council, board, committees, sections, subsections, and units. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n47. \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years from 2003 to 2009. Considering the limited \npersonnel  resources  at  DUDBC  and  other  relevant  central  Government  agencies  from  which \nstaff will be seconded for PAs/PIUs, a staggered implementation arrangement will be used. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll  procurement  services  for  the  Project  will  follow  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \n48. \nContract for civil works estimated to cost $1.0 million equivalent or more will be carried out using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  while  contracts  that  are  estimated  to  cost \nless  than  $1.0  million  equivalent  will  be  carried  out  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB) \nprocedures.  Good  to  be  procured  will  preferably  be  grouped  into  packages  equivalent  to  or \nlarger than $500,000 to be suitable for ICB procedures. Miscellaneous minor goods that cannot \nbe grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less than $500,000 per contract will \nbe procured through international shopping (IS) procedures. Minor items estimated to cost less \nthan  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  directly,  following  proper \nprocedures  to  ensure  economy,  efficiency,  and  quality.  The  proposed  contract  packages  are \nshown in Appendix 11. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n49. \nAll  consulting  services  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  selected  and  engaed \nfollowing  the  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  QCBS  method,  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. A total input of 29 person-\nmonths of international and 747 person-months of domestic consulting services is planned. The \nconsulting inputs will cover a wide range of expertise and will result in substantial strengthening \nof administrative and management capacity and skills of the EA and IAs. \n\n50. \nThe consulting services are designed to support the project as well as build the longer \nterm  capacity  of  the  agencies  and  institutions  responsible  for  planning  and  delivering  urban \nservices.  They  will  cover  broad  areas  of  expertise  including  (i)  project  implementation  support \ntopographic  surveys,  mapping,  geotechnical \nand  project  performance  monitoring;  (ii) \ninvestigations,  and  water  testing;  (iii)  engineering  design  and  construction  supervision;  (iv) \ninstitutional  reforms  in  the  water  supply  sector;  (v)  training;  and  (vi)  community  development. \nIndicative terms of reference for the major packages are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n51. \nDUDBC  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  requesting \nbudget  allocations  for  counterpart  funds.  It  will  establish  an  imprest  account  for  the  program. \nThe initial amount will be no more than a 6 month projected disbursement, or 10% of the loan \namount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Statement-of-expenditure  (SOE) \nprocedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000,  and  to \nliquidate  advances made into the imprest account in accordance with the guidelines. DUDBC \nwill coordinate the timely release of funds. This is essential because project activities will take \nplace at different locations and simple mechanisms are required to disburse small funds quickly \nthrough decentralized decision making while maintaining acceptable levels of financial control. \nAuditors  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedures.  A \nseparate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures will be included \nin the annual audit report. \n\n\f 14\n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n52. \nThe Government, acting through DUDBC, will maintain records and accounts adequate \nto identify works, goods, and services financed out of the loan proceeds. Specifically, DUDBC \nwill (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that project accounts and financial \nstatements are audited annually in accordance with sound accounting principles by independent \nauditors satisfactory to ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than  9 months after the close of \neach fiscal year, certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements and the auditor's \nreport on them. \n\n53. \nDUDBC  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports,  in  a  format  satisfactory  to  ADB,  with \ninformation on (i) progress made against established targets, including  pre-identified monitoring \nindicators;  (ii)  delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  them; \n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during \nthe next quarter; and (v) expected progress during the next quarter. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the project, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion \nreport  on  the  execution  of  the  project,  including  the  costs  and  compliance  with  the  loan \ncovenants. \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nIn  accordance  with  ADB's  PPMS  Handbook,  a  shortlist  of  verifiable  performance \n54. \nindicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  was  prepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  PPMS \nactivities will be conducted periodically to gather information through multiple sources so as to \ndetermine  whether  the  input  deliveries  for  implementing  the  subprojects  have  rendered  the \nexpected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. PPMS also seeks to detect any deficiency and \ndiscrepancy  between  the  plan  and  the  execution  of  a  subproject  in  using  the  resources \nefficiently so that timely corrections can be made to adjust the project design and thus improve \nthe benefits, outcomes, and impact. PCO, with the assistance of a project-financed consultant \nteam,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  and  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nHandbook  within  9  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  PPMS  procedures,  performance \nindicators,  and  their  targets  have  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  ADB,  and  most  are \nincorporated in the Project framework (Appendix 1). PCO, with the help of their consultant, will \nthen  undertake  a  quantitative  and  qualitative  project  performance  monitoring  for  each  project \ncomponent  to  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities  and  the  project  benefits  accrued. \nThe nine municipalities and their respective PAs/PIUs will assist PCO and the PPMS consultant \nteam to carry out PPMS activities. These activities will be conducted annually: one immediately \nbefore the ADB midterm review and the one upon project completion to be more comprehensive \nthan the others. \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n55. \nThe Project will be reviewed jointly by the Government and ADB semiannually to assess \nprogress  and  at  midterm  more  comprehensively.  Taking  into  account  the  PPMS  performance \nmonitoring  results,  the  midterm  review  will  (i)  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation  arrangements;  (ii)  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  institutional  strengthening \nprocesses, including reforms for the water supply subsector; (iii) identify changes needed in any \nof \nimplementation  performance  against  agreed-upon \nperformance indicator targets in the logical framework; (v) identify critical issues and constraints, \nif  any;  and  (vi)  recommend  adjustments  to  the  Project  design  and/or  implementation \narrangements, if necessary. \n\nthe  areas  reviewed;  (iv)  assess \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n9. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n56. \nThe Project will require the permanent acquisition of a total of 26.7 hectares (ha) of land, \nof  which  11.0  ha  is  owned  by  the  Government,  6.9  ha  by  municipalities,  0.6  ha  by  other \nGovernment agencies, and 8.2 ha by private landowners. Acquisition of the identified land is not \nexpected  to  result  in  significant  loss  of  livelihood  or  loss  of  community  resources.  The  short \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan (Supplementary Appendix F) includes details on \nland acquisition requirements identified by the Project. A summary of the plan is in Appendix 12. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  the  urban  population  of  about  320,000  in  the  selected \n57. \nnine  urban  areas  through  improved  personal  hygiene,  environmental  sanitation,  and  overall \nquality  of  life.  In  particular,  the  EIRRs  for  the  water  supply  subprojects  are  estimated  to  be \naround  22-28%.  The  participating  local  institutions,  including  municipalities  and  prospective \nwater supply utilities under municipal control, will be strengthened in terms of management and \nfinancial capacities for sustainable urban development. \n\n58. \nAs the first decentralized urban project for Nepal, this Project is expected to establish an \nimportant  precedent  for  a  series  of  similar  projects  that  could  follow.  With  respect  to \ndecentralization,  in  addition  to strengthening the municipalities themselves, the Project is also \nexpected  to  help  establish  financially  and  institutionally  self-sustainable  water  supply  utilities \nunder  municipal  control  in  Bharatpur,  Hetauda,  Banepa,  Dhulikhel,  and  Panauti.  Furthermore, \nregional  integration  of  the  water  supply  service  is  anticipated  for  Banepa,  Panauti,  and, \nadditionally, Dhulikhel. These will help the Government's effort to arrest the increasing trend of \nmigration  to  Kathmandu.  Through  various  interventions,  the  Project  will  help  improve  the \nframework for public-private partnership, too. \n\n59. \nAs a part of the project preparatory technical assistance, an IEE was carried out for the \nentire  Project.  The  IEE  concluded  that  the  subprojects  and  components  for  all  the  9  project \ntowns  will  have  negligible  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment,  which  could  be  overcome \nthrough  adequate  mitigation  measures  and  regular  monitoring  during  the  design,  construction, \nand  operation  phases.  The  Project  is  expected  to  bring  about  significant  improvements  in \npersonal, household, and community hygiene, and environmental sanitation, thereby enhancing \nthe  quality  of  life  and  community  health.  The  individual  IEE  conducted  for  each  town  also \nshowed  no  apparent  adverse  or  harmful  environmental  impacts  of  any  significance  and, \ntherefore,  a  full-scale  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not  required  for  any  of  the \nsubprojects. An example of summary IEE (SIEE) is attached as Appendix 13. \n\nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed  subprojects  were  prepared  in \n60. \naccordance  with  ADB's  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Projects. Base case EIRRs for water supply, which constitute about 23% of \nthe  total  project  cost,  varies  from  22.3%  to  28.9%,  confirming  the  economic  robustness of the \nproposed  subproject.  The  least-cost  analysis  was  applied  to  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement,  river  training  works,  and  road  upgrading  subprojects.  The  sanitation  and \nwastewater  management  subproject  was  subjected  to  least-cost  analysis  with  reed  bed \ntreatment  system  as  the  least-cost  option  for  all  the  towns  except  Dhadingbesi,  where  the \nconventional  wastewater  treatment  has  marginally  lower  cost.  The  river  training  works  were \nsubjected to least-cost analysis with gabion box-based embankment protection for three towns \n(Bharatpur, Hetauda, and Kamalamai) as the least-cost option. Road upgrading was subjected \nto  least-cost  analysis  with  black  topping  the  earthen  road  for  three  towns  (Banepa,  Dhulikhel, \n\n\f 16\n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\nand  Ratnanagar)  as  the  least-cost  option.  The  FIRRs  were  calculated  for  the  revenue-\ngenerating subcomponent and water supply. The water supply subprojects in all the five towns \nwere found to be financially viable, with base case FIRRs ranging from 6.5% to 9.0%, exceeding \nthe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  4.6%.  The  results  of  economic  and  financial  analyses \nand the financial projections for the nine project towns are in Appendix 14. \n\n61. \nThe main risks include (i) limited capacities of the municipal government staff to carry out \nthe  investment  project  (considering  the  history  of  difficulties  in  conducting  procurement  in \nNepal), and operate and maintain the resulting facilities on a sustainable basis; (ii) uncertainty \nregarding  the  continued  political  support  for  decentralization,  including  sufficient  budget \nallocation; (iii) uncertainty regarding the planned municipal revenue improvements whose failure \nwould endanger the municipalities' repayment of their loans to the Government; (iv) uncertainty \nregarding the willingness of local communities to contribute time, counterpart funds, and other \nresources  for  project  implementation;  and  (v)  the  general  political  stability  and  security  in  the \ncountry,  given  the  recent  insurgency.  During  implementation,  procedures  will  be  developed  to \nmitigate the effects of the conflict on the Project. The staggered schedule for beginning activities \nin  the  project  towns  provides  some  flexibility  to  defer  activities  when  security  conditions  are \nunfavorable. \n\n62. \nRegarding component C supplementary urban facilities, TDF management's capacity to \nprofessionally  appraise/screen  the  proposals  during  project  implementation  is  another  risk. \nWhether or not a proposal involves private sector participation, it should yield sufficient financial \nreturn. \n\n63. \nRegarding the water supply subcomponent, the uncertainty regarding continued political \nsupport for water supply sector reforms is a risk. In particular, NWSC must smoothly transform \nitself  in  accordance  with  the  Government's  decentralization  policy  for  the  urban  water  supply \nsector. \n\n64. \nThe  expected  benefits  and  positive  impacts  outweigh  the  costs  of  associated  risks \npresented  in  paras.  61-63. Decentralization is one of the Government's commitments towards \nreform  and,  thus,  this  Project  is  a  timely  contribution  to  the  reform  process.  Furthermore, the \nProject is expected to complement the Melamchi Water Supply Project in addressing the water \nsupply sector reform. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n65. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n1. \n\nExecution of Project \n\na. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProject Coordination Office. \n\n66. \nThe  PCO  will  be  based  within  DUDBC  and \nmaintained  throughout  the  project  implementation  period  with  adequate  staffing  and  other \nresources  as  may  be  agreed-upon  by  the  Borrower  and  ADB.  The  PCO  will  be  headed  by  a \nproject director, who will be responsible for day-to-day management of the Project at the central \nlevel. The PCO will provide the required professional, subprofessional, and support staff to carry \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nout its duties of planning, coordination, monitoring, and supervision.

The  Project  Manager  will  serve  as \nthe  secretary  to  each  MSC.  The  MSC  will  advise  the  municipality  concerned  in  subproject \nimplementation matters. \n\nb. \n\nRelending and Onlending Arrangements \n\nTDF's Onlending. \n\n71. \nThe Borrower will ensure that, subject to PCO's approval, the TDF \nonlends  the  TDF  subsidiary  loan  -  under  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB  -  to  the \nmunicipalities  for  the  selected  subprojects  under  component  C,  and  to  Dhadingbesi  for  the \nselected  subprojects  under  components  B  and  C,  as  may  be  agreed-upon  between  the  TDF \nand  the  municipality  concerned  or  Dhadingbesi,  as  the  case  may  be.  The  municipalities  and \nDhadingbesi will carry out feasibility studies for the selected subprojects under component C, in \nsuch  details  and  format  satisfactory  to  the  Borrower  and  the  Bank,  prior  to  seeking  financing \nfrom the TDF. The TDF will subsequently review and endorse the feasibility studies with respect \nto  the  financial  viability  of  the  underlying  subproject  before  submitting  them  to  the  PCO  for \napproval. \n\n\f 18\n\nSecurity for Subsidiary Loans. \n\nThe  Borrower  will  ensure,  and  cause  the  TDF  to \n72. \nensure, that the municipalities provide appropriate and adequate collateral, satisfactory to ADB, \nto  secure  their  respective  obligations  under  the  subsidiary  loan  agreements  and  the  subloan \nagreements. \n\n2. \n\nOther Matters \n\na. \n\nCost Recovery/Affordability and Sustainability of Water Supply \n\nThe  Borrower  will  ensure,  and  will  cause  municipalities  that  implement  water  supply \n73. \nsubprojects  to  ensure  that  (i)  a  cost  recovery  plan,  which  includes,  among  others,  volumetric \ntariffs  and  connections  charges;  and  (ii)  arrangements  for  the  management  and  operation  of \nsuch  subprojects,  all  of  which  will  be  satisfactory  to  ADB,  are  prepared  and  approved  by  the \nrelevant authority of the Borrower before relevant civil works contracts are signed.

Hence,  the  outputs  of \nimplementing these policies will obviously be quite limited. \n2. \nThus, on the whole, although the policies are rightly conceived, their implementation is \nlargely  weak,  with  adverse  implications  on  urban  development  and  environment  improvement \nactivities. \nFurther details of these policies are summarized below. \nA. \n\nUrban Development and Land Use  \n\n\u2022  Making  LGIs  especially  municipalities  fully  responsible  for  urban  development  and \n\n\u2022 \n\nmanagement (UDM) \nInvolving  communities,  private  sector,  NGOs  in  the  process  of  UDM  and  strengthening \nthe role of government as facilitator and initiator \n\n\u2022  Enhancing urban-rural linkages \n\u2022  Clarifying the economic role of cities \n\u2022  Undertaking organizational improvement and human resource development activities \n\u2022  Streamlining interinstitutional coordination in infrastructure development \n\u2022  Highlighting the need for preparing comprehensive land use plans and mapping \n\u2022  Appropriating land for developing and extending municipalities, newly urbanizing areas, \n\nand new settlements \n\n\u2022  Undertaking the tasks of legal improvement \n\u2022  Constituting a Land Use Council \nEnvironment Improvement \n\nB. \n\n\u2022  Raising  public  awareness  on  the  need  for  environment  conservation  and  promotion  at \n\nthe initiative of local communities, LGIs, NGOs, and the private sector \n\n\u2022  Motivating people for environment conservation \n\u2022  Forging mutual cooperation of government and NGOs for environmental protection \n\u2022  Promoting private sector and joint-venture investment with active participation of LGIs in \n\n\u2022  Motivating  people  engaged  in  the  recycling  business  for  the  purpose  of  recycling  solid \n\nsolid waste management \n\nwastes \n\n\f28\n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n    \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n\nC. \n\nImproving  institutional  arrangements  -  reviewing  the  management  style  of  the \nEnvironment Protection Fund, setting up small environment information centres at local \nlevel, capacity building for environment sections of sectoral ministries;

It is governed under Town Development Act 2053 (1997), \nwith  investment  policies  and  procedures  stipulated  in  the  related  Town  Development  Fund \nRules, 1997. The legislation establishes the TDF as a Government-owned autonomous body to \nprovide  financial,  technical,  and  institutional  support  and  research  to  institutions  engaged  in \ntown development. The TDF board comprises the secretary or the representative from MPPW \n(chair), Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of Local Development (MLD); five Government-\nnominated  mayors  representing  the  five  regions;  two  board-nominated financial and technical \nexperts;  and  an  executive  director  appointed  by  the  board  through  open  competition.  Others \nmay participate as observers, as necessary. \n\n2. \nWith  Government  approval,  the  TDF  may  act  with  any  foreign  government  or \norganization  in  areas  of  its  activities.  It  is  authorized  to  receive  grant  and  loan  funds  from  the \nGovernment  and  other  organizations,  foreign  governments,  and  international  agencies  for  its \nprograms.  It  may  invest  funds,  issue  debentures  within  prescribed  regulations,  and  retain \nservice  charges.  The  TDF  may  give  grants  and  loans  to  any  institution  engaged  in  town \ndevelopment:  government  and  nongovernment  institutions,  user  groups,  village  development \ncommittees (VDCs), and municipalities. The TDF stipulates the terms and conditions of its loan \nor grant and specifies conditions of recourse in the event of default, including seizure of pledged \nsecurity. The board has an Investment Promotion Committee for preparing investment policies \nand procedures. \n\n3. \nThe TDF is organized under four divisions: (i) Loans and Grants Division; (ii) Technical \nand Monitoring Division; (iii) Finance Division; and (iv) Administration Division. Additional staff or \nconsultants  are  employed  on  an  as-required  basis.  As  a  result,  the  TDF  maintains  a  lean \norganization. \n\nB.  \n\nPerformance \n\nFinancial \n\n1.  \n4.  \nTDF's  funding  for  loan  and  grant  projects  to  date  has  originated  from  the  World  Bank, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) , and Deutsche \nGesellschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation \n[GTZ]) and Government contributions. As of the end of FY1999, the TDF had accumulated grant \nfunds of $2.90 million, Government contributions of $0.19 million, and World Bank loan of $1.35 \nmillion, with retained earnings and capital fund totaling $0.42 million. Assets were $4.47 million, \nincluding project loans of $3.56 million to municipalities. \n\nAs of the end of FY1999, the TDF had disbursed $1.8 million in World Bank loans, $0.2 \n5.  \nmillion in KfW loans, $1.4 million in grants from GTZ, and $0.5 million in loans plus $1.6 million \nin grants from KfW. Almost all interest and principal repayments have been paid on the agreed-\nupon terms, with overdue interest representing 4% of total interest charged. Two municipalities \nhave  not  met  the  agreed-upon  term,  requiring  the  payments  to  be  collected  directly  from  the \nGovernment.  To  date,  no  provision  for  loan  losses  has  been  made  since  repayment \nperformance has been strong, with loans' performance exceeding 95% of interest and principal \ndue.  Although  loan  agreements  generally  have  recourse  to  payment  through  the  Government, \nthe TDF bears the primary risk for loan losses. Recently agreed-upon terms for a second phase \n                                                 \n1  Town Development Fund Board (formation) Order 2045 (1989). \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nof KfW funding will require the TDF to provide a minimum of 4% of interest due for more than 6 \nmonths, and 2% on outstanding principal amounts. The terms also include the recommendation \nof  a  recent  external  policy  review2  that  the  TDF  should  retain  and  transfer  2%  of  its  interest \nincome to a special contingency reserve for potential loan losses. \n\nLoan  approvals  have  averaged  $560,000  annually  over  the  past  3  years  The  average \n6.  \nloan size has increased in recent years to about $110,000, the largest being $440,000. The TDF \ncurrently  finances  projects  in  all  but  2  of  the  original  36  municipalities,  with  65  projects \ncompleted and 70 in progress. Social infrastructure development projects include public toilets \nand drainage, water systems, feasibility studies, solid waste collection equipment and sanitary \nlandfills, school buildings, and bus parks. Commercial loans include those to commercial retail \nbuildings. In total (including grant projects), the TDF has handled over 553 projects worth almost \n$8.5 million. \n\nThe  net  income  for  TDF  has  averaged  NRs6.5  million3  over  the  past  3  years,  with  a \n7.  \n3.3%  average  return  on  assets  and  10.0%  return  on  equity.  Operating  costs  have  averaged \nNRs5.8 million,  about 45% of the financial margin. The financial statements are audited by an \nindependent  auditor  and  are  submitted  to  the  Government.  The  board  has  an  audit \nsubcommittee that reviews and acts on the auditor's report. The audited financial statements of \n1997, 1998, and 1999 were reviewed. The audits included a rigorous compliance review of loan \nprocedures  and  terms  for  each  project,  and  the  board  was  responsive  to  the  auditor's \ncomments. \n\n2.  \n\nOperational \n\nOver  its  10  years  of  operation,  TDF  has  developed  policies,  procedures4  and \n8.  \nstandardized  documents  for  grant  and  loan  applications,  evaluations,  grant  approvals,  loan \nagreements,  tendering,  fund  disbursement,  and  repayment  monitoring.  Projects  under  KfW \nfunding are financed by grants or loans, depending on the nature of the project and the income \nof  the  municipality.  It  has  been  recommended  that  future  grants  apply  only  to  low-income \nmunicipalities  and  be  restricted  to  the  areas  of  sanitation,  environment,  and  school  projects. \nGrants  are  provided  with  counterparts  funds  from  the  municipalities.  The  tendering  and \ncontracting  of  projects  financed  under  KfW  funding  are  monitored  by  TDF's  own  staff  at  no \ncharge  to  the  municipalities.  The  TDF  supplies  technical  support  to  municipalities  with \ninadequate engineering capacity to plan, evaluate, and oversee implementation of their projects. \nIt also provides financial and accounting training, support, and post-implementation monitoring \nof operations to assess financial and operational performance. \n\nTo procure consulting services, the TDF maintains a roster of 24 prequalified consultants \n9.  \nfor  each  architecture  and  planning  project  as  well  as  engineering  project.  A  roster  of  12 \nprequalified consultants is maintained for each category of projects. Depending on performance, \nconsultants  are  removed  from  the  list  and  others  added.  For  competitive  bidding,  a  shortlist \ngroup of six consultants is drawn from the appropriate pool, based on a regular rotation. If less \nthan  three  proposals  are  received,  additional  consultants  are  invited  from  the  next  group.  The \nTDF  prepares  the  terms  of  reference  in  all  projects  requiring  consulting  services.  After  an \ninvitation for proposals, consultants are briefed in a prebid meeting. A two-envelope system is \nused, with 80% weight placed on the technical proposal and 20% on the financial proposal, with \nminimum requirements for each. Proposals that pass technical evaluation are forwarded to the \n                                                 \n2  Analysis of the Economic Situation of the Town Development Fund and Evaluation of the Loan and Grant Policy, \n\nprepared by German consultants for KfW, Frankfurt, Germany, October 1999. \n\n3  Conversion rate: NRs1=$0.0138 as of 16 August 2000. \n4  TDF. 1999. Guidelines for Procurement of Works and Services. The guidelines define the procedures and rules for  \n\nall funding under the KfW  cooperation fund. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nTDF  for  review  and  approval  before  the  financial  bids  are  opened  with  the  tenderers  present. \nContracts  are  awarded  on  a  combined  weighted  technical  and  financial  score.  In  the  case  of \nsupervision  assignments  to  a  design  consultant  (if  prequalified  by  TDF),  negotiations  are \nconducted  directly  with  the  consultant  who  prepared  the  master  plan  or  design.  Services, \nstudies,  and  designs  are  awarded  by  competitive  bidding  if  the  contract  value  is  greater  than \nNRs0.2  million.  With  contracts  not  exceeding  NRs0.5  million,  direct  negotiation  may  be  used. \nThe guidelines specify recourse in the event of cost overruns from construction delays caused \nby  either  the  contractor  or  the  municipality.  All  projects  exceeding  NRs1.5  million,  or  where \ncompetent  domestic  consultants  are  not  available,  must  be  supervised  by  a  consultant \nappointed by the TDF. \n\n10.  \nFor procurement of construction works, projects costing less than NRs1.0 million may be \nexecuted through a user committee or by municipalities utilizing force account, or by suppliers \noffering  the  lowest  price,  based  on  quotations  in  three  sealed  envelopes  (records  to  be \nmaintained by the committee). Local shopping may be used for small purchases that cannot be \nincluded  in  other  works,  or  where  items  are  readily  available  through  local  suppliers.  Three \nsealed  quotes  must  be  obtained,  evaluated,  and  submitted  to  the  TDF  for  approval. \nConstruction projects valued over NRs1.0 million are procured by tender, using standard tender \ndocuments  as  specified  in  a  project  appraisal  report.  The  tendering  process  is  similar  to  the \nbidding process for procuring consulting services, except that tenders are nationally advertised. \nTechnical  evaluation  is  based  on  financial  and  technical  past  performance  and  capacity  to \nundertake the work. Contractors are required to provide performance security. Contracts include \nboth penalties for nonperformance and incentives for early completion.  \n\nC.  \n\nCapacity for Management of Project Loan Financing \n\n1.  \n\nFinancial \n\n11.   Projections  were  prepared  to  determine  the  financial  capacity  of  the  TDF  to  undertake \nthe  proposed  Project.  As  a  relatively  small  financial  institution,  the  TDF  must  have  sufficient \nspread  between  the  relending  rate  from  MOF  and  the  onlending  rate  to  the  subprojects  and \nadequate financial capacity to cover project-related costs in the intervening period until subloan \nrepayments begin to provide cash flow and revenue. The incremental operation costs for staff, \nlogistical  support,  financial  training  program,  and  administration  are  based  on  TDF  estimates. \nConstruction  costs  were  developed  based  on  four  phases  of  44  construction  projects,  with  8 \nstarting in the first quarter of 2001, and 12 each in the fourth quarters of 2002, 2003, and 2004, \nrespectively.  Each  project  is  assumed  to  average  NRs62.5  million  in  1999  prices.  Loan \ndisbursements are based on 25% of construction costs being disbursed semiannually over a 2-\nyear  construction  period.  Based  on  the  ratio  of  foreign  costs  to  local  costs,  construction  costs \nare assumed to increase 5% per year, and the price contingency will be adequately covered by \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  being  in  dollars.  Local  inflation  is  estimated  to \ncontinue  at  7.0%,  foreign  inflation  is  assumed  as  2.4%.  As  the  water  users  and  sanitation \ncommittees  (WUSCs)  will  have  no  funds  to  pay  interest  until  operations  begin,  interest  during \nconstruction  is  assumed  to  be  capitalized  for  both  WUSC  and  TDF.  Interest  on  borrowing  to \ncover  cash-flow  deficits  is  assumed  at  12%,  current  commercial  bank  rates  on  overdrafts  and \nloans ranging from 11.5% to 15%. Interest income on surplus funds available for investment is \nassumed at 4%, current commercial rates on deposits ranging from 3% to 8%. \n\n12.  \nFinancial  projections  incorporate  the  incremental  cash-flow impacts of the Project, with \nprojections  for  existing  TDF  operation.  The  TDF  cash-flow  projections  are  premised  on \noperational plans before the recently agreed-upon new KfW funding. The projections show that \nthe  Project  will  initially  have  a  negative  impact  on  TDF  incomes  during  the  period  2001-2003 \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nuntil  interest  revenues  from  the  subloans  flow  in  starting  2004.  However,  cash  flow  should be \nmore than sufficient to cover interim expenses relating to the Project. While the overall financial \npositions are healthy over the projection period, the current ratios will deteriorate until 2005 and \nimprove  marginally  thereafter,  indicating  inadequacy  of  long-term  capital  and  the  need  to \nfinance  operations  with  short-term  borrowings.  This  aspect  will  need  to  be  monitored  closely. \nKfW  recently  approved  DM14.0  million5  funding  for  the  TDF  for  a  second  phase  of  the  town \ndevelopment program for grants and establishment of a long-term sustainable revolving fund for \nfinancing municipal infrastructure. Plans for managing these funds have not yet been finalized. \nThe  new  funding  will  strengthen,  rather  than  weaken,  TDF's  financial  capacity;  therefore,  the \nfinancial projections conservatively present TDF's financial outlook. \n \n\n2.  \n\nOperational \n\n13.  \nThe  Project  is  much  larger  than  anything  the  TDF  has  handled  to  date,  but  the  TDF's \nperformance  record  indicates  that  it  has  developed  significant  experience  in  working  with \nmunicipalities, and has developed an efficient and effective mode of operation. Over 10 years of \noperation,  the  TDF  has  developed  clear  policies,  procedures,  and  standardized  documents.  It \nhas gained much practical experience in project identification and design, to ensure the projects \nare appropriate and responsive to the needs of the community. It has also gained considerable \nexperience  in  working  with  local  contractors,  improving  procedures  over  time.  As  an \nautonomous  body,  it  has  been  flexible  and  responsive  in  project  implementation,  and  gained \ntrust through transparent operations. \n\n14.  \nIt  currently  has  a  trained  staff  of  38,  of  whom  15  have  graduate  or  postgraduate \nqualifications in finance and business administration, engineering, architecture, and law. Further \ncapacity building is ongoing through professional training. The TDF estimates that the additional \nwork  for  the  Project  could  be  handled  with  an  additional  staff  of  two  or  three  engineers,  a \nfinancial  specialist,  sociologist,  accountant,  and  additional  support  staff  of  drivers  and  a \nsecretary.  Under  the  recently  approved  second-phase  KfW  funding,  the  technical  assistance \nand international consultant support will be continued. This is additional assurance to ADB that \nthere  will  be  continuity  in  monitoring  and  the  standards  of  TDF  operations  during  project \nimplementation.\n\n                                                 \n5   Conversion rate: DM1=$0.4467 as of 16 August 2000. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nNEPAL'S TOWN DEVELOPMENT ACT \n\n  \n1. \nfinally in 1997. It facilitates town planning by \u201cLocal Bodies,\u201d which are defined as \n\nThe Act was passed in 1988, subsequently amended in 1991 (twice), again in 1992, and \n\n(i) \n\nvillage development committees (VDCs); \n\n(ii)  municipal corporations, submunicipal corporations, and municipalities; and \n\n(iii) \n\ntown development boards (committees). \n\n \n2. \nPlans of VDCs and municipalities must be approved by a board, or a higher authority if \nno board exists. The membership of a board is determined by the government. (Only 4 of the 18 \nmembers are democratically elected.) The government can alter the membership as it sees fit. \n \n3. \n\nLocal bodies have duties and functions under the Act, namely, to \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ndefine land use zones; \n\nset standards and norms; \n\nconduct programs for proper development; \n\nrestrict development; \n\nconduct land development programs; \n\nstop development or subdivision of land for a maximum period of 2 years; \n\n(vii) \n\nregulate, control, or prohibit development; \n\n(viii) \n\nimpose conditions when granting approval for development; \n\nrequire unauthorized development to be removed at no cost; and \n\nacquire land in its name for the purpose of town planning. \n\n4. \nThe  Town  Development  Act  provides  an  elaborate legal framework for executing town \nplanning. More specifically, for land development programs, the Act empowers a local body to \nconduct guided land development (GLD) and/or land pooling projects, and provides the means \nto overcome legal objections that  may arise if such projects are implemented under the Local \nSelf-Governance Act. \n \n5. \n\nFor land pooling, it gives local bodies authority to \n\nrecover management and capital costs through the sale of reserve plots; \n\nconduct land pooling in any area required; \n\nconduct  land  pooling  in  any  area  where  75%  of  the  owners/tenants  demand, \nproviding that more than 50 families reside in the area; \n\n(iv) \n\nconduct land pooling through a user committee; \n\n(v) \n\nprevent  subdivision,  sale,  and  development  of  land  for  2  years  while  land \npooling is conducted; \n\n(vi) \n\nuse prevailing land values to determine contribution ratios; and \n\n(vii)  enable owners with plots that are too small to buy additional land. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n6. \n\nFor guided land development, it gives local bodies authority to \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nacquire land for roads (50% of the cost will be paid by the board and 50% by \nthe landowners who benefit); \n\nform a user committee to plan and implement GLD; and \n\nallow GLD if 75% of owners apply, providing that 50 families reside in the area \n(but the cost of any land acquired for the scheme will be borne entirely by the \nbeneficiaries). \n\n7. \nThe Act also facilitates local bodies' town planning projects by providing exemption from \nland  transfer  fees  and  other  regulations,  such  as  the  land  ceiling.  Moreover,  the  penalties  for \ninfringement  of  rules  and  regulations  are  much  higher  than  specified  in  the  LSGA,  namely,  a \nmaximum of \n\n(i)  NRs100,000 and/or 1 year in prison for unauthorized development, \n\n(ii)  NRs25,000 and/or 6 months in prison for obstruction or hindrance of the Act, and \n\n(iii) NRs5,000 for failure to comply with the order or directive of the board. \n\n \n8. \n\nFinally, the Act enables local bodies to prepare bylaws for executing town planning.\n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nWATER AND SANITATION SECTOR STRATEGY \n\n(Excerpts from \"Nepal Water Supply and Sanitation Medium-Term Expenditure Framework \nfor the Draft Tenth Five-Year Plan\") \n \n\nA  demand-driven  approach  with  maximum  local  resources  will  be  used  in  rural  water \nsupply  schemes.  Nongovernment  agencies,  community-based  organizations,  and  the \nprivate sector will be mobilized as partners in developing the sector. \n\nPriority  will  be  given  to  the  use  of  appropriate  simple  technologies  that  the  community \ncan support. Technologies like rainwater harvesting, solar pumps, hydrams, etc. will be \nused wherever a perennial water source is not available. \n\nEffective  and  sustainable  development  will  be  achieved  by  strengthening \nimplementation,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  leakage  control  arrangements \nby involving local users committees/agencies from the planning stage. \n\nPriority  will  be  given  to  rehabilitating  yet-to-be-handed-over  old  rural  water  supply \nschemes and incomplete schemes. \n\nA  policy  for  developing  and  conserving  water  resources  within  a  watershed  area  by \nintegrated use management of ground water and surface water sources will be adopted. \nInstitutional development for integrated use management of watersheds will be made to \nimprove and augment the water supply in Kathmandu Valley. \n\nNational  quality  guidelines  will  be  prepared  and  the  quality  monitoring  and  control \nsystem will be strengthened to provide safe water. \n\nEmphasis will be put on the skills and capability of users committees or nongovernment \norganizations for implementing water supply schemes by mobilizing them. \n\nSanitation  programs  will  be  implemented  parallel  to  the  development  of  water  supply \nschemes. Sewerage systems in densely populated areas and on-site sanitation in other \nareas shall be promoted. \n\n9.   Water supply schemes will be operated on cost recovery basis. In rural areas, a policy of \ncost recovery of O&M and users community operation will be adopted. Cost recovery of \ncapital cost along with O&M cost will be adopted in urban areas. \n\n10.   Besides encouraging private sector involvement in managing of water supply systems in \nurban  areas,  water  supply  services  will  be  developed  and  expanded  by  involving \nmunicipalities in the responsibility as provided for in Nepal\u2019s decentralization policy. \n\n11.   A  regulatory  body  for  monitoring  water  supply  services  operated  by  government \nagencies, semigovernment agencies, user committees, or private sector entities in urban \nand semiurban areas will be established. \n\n1.  \n\n2.  \n\n3.  \n\n4.  \n\n5.  \n\n6.  \n\n7.  \n\n8.  \n\n \n\n\f36\n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO NEPAL'S URBAN DEVELOPMENT \n1997 - 2002 \n\nDevelopment Program/Project \n\nLoan/Grant \n\nSource \n\nStart  Finish \n\nAmount \n\n($\u2019000) \n\n1  National Sanitation Action Plan \n\nFTC/Grant \n\nUNICEF \n\n1997 \n\n2001 \n\n454\n\n2  Rural-Urban Partnership Programme \n\nFTC/Grant \n\nUNDP/UNCHS \n\n1997 \n\n2002 \n\n4,995\n\n3  Second Tourism Development Project \n\nIPA /Loan \n\nADB \n\n1997 \n\n2001  17,200\n\n4  Solidarit\u00e9 Tiers Monde (Cooperation with \n\nFTC/Grant \n\nFrance  \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n52\n\nTansen Municipality) \n\n5  Yala Urban Health \n\n6  Healthy City Programme \n\n7  Kathmandu Valley Mapping Project \n\nFTC/Grant \n\nUnited Mission to Nepal \n\n1997 \n\n2004 \n\n685\n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nWHO \n\nEU \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n1998 \n\n2003 \n\n 5,961a\n\n8  Mapping for 2001 Census  \n\nFTC/Grant \n\nFINNIDA  \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n9  Melamchi Water Supply Project \n\nFTC/Grant \n\nWB/ADB/JBIC \n\n1998 \n\n2010 \n\n10  NGO/CBO Participatory Learning and Advisory \n\nGrant \n\nDFID  \n\n1998 \n\n2003 \n\n4,074\n\nProject \n\n11  Sindhuli Road Project \n\n13  Institutional Strengthening of KMC (TA) \n\n14  Master Plan for Agricultural Marketing in \n\nKathmandu Valley \n\n12  Corporate Accounting System for KMC (TA) \n\nUSAID \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n7,274\n\nJICA/OECF \n\n1998 \n\n2007 \n\nADB \n\nFAO \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n119\n\n15  Privatisation of Nepal Water Supply \n\nLoan/Grant \n\nWB/NORAD \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\nCorporation (Melamchi) \n\n16  City Development Strategy for KMC \n\nWB \n\n2000 \n\n2000 \n\n17  Environment Sector Programme Support \n\nDanida \n\n2000 \n\n2004 \n\n18  Strengthening Institutional Capacity of MuAN \n\nUNV/UNDP \n\n2000 \n\n2003 \n\n19  Urban and Environmental Improvement Project \n\nGrant \n\nADB \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n(PPTA) \n\n \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CBO  =  community-based  organization,  Danida  =  Danish  International  Development \nAssistance,  DFID  =  Department  of  International  Development,  EU  =  European  Union,  FAO  =  Food  and  Agriculture \nOrganization,  FINNIDA  =  Finnish  International  Development  Agency,  JBIC  =  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation, \nJICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency, KMC = Kathmandu Metropolitan City, NORAD = Norwegian Agency for \nDevelopment Cooperation, OECF = Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, UNCHS = United Nations Centre for Human \nSettlements,  UNDP  =  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  UNICEF  =  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  UNV  = \nUnited  Nations  volunteer,  USAID  =  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  WB  =  World  Bank,  WHO  = \nWorld Health Organization. \n\n \n\n \n\na  Converted from \u20ac5,870,000 at an exchange rate of $1.00 = \u20ac0.9847. \n\n205\n\n533\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n205\n\n750\n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\nGrant \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n \n\n37\n\nSUMMARY OF POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?  \n\n \nYes \n\n \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Partnership Agreement?  \n\n \nYes \n\n \n\nOver the last decade the number of absolutely poor has increased to 9 million in Nepal. That is approximately 45% of the \ntotal population (UNDP 1998). If $1 per day per capita is taken as the yardstick for measuring of poverty, the percent of \nthe  poor  in  Nepal  is  53%.  The  Nepal  Living  Standard  Survey  1996  revealed  that  42%  of  the  population  remained  as \nabsolute  poor.  The  9th  Plan  (1997-2002)  emphasizes  poverty  reduction  as  the  sole  development  objective  and  it \nbecame a major agenda.  \n\nUntil recently, Nepal\u2019s economy has been based largely on rural agriculture. But as the country develops toward a more \nurban  economy,  it  faces  a  number  of  special  circumstances  associated  with  environmental  degradation,  high-income \ninequalities,  entrenched  poverty,  and  formation  of  slums  and  squatter  settlements.  The  main  factors  that  have \ncontributed to the rapid rise in overall urban populations are high level of rural to urban migration, extension of municipal \nboundaries,  and  designation  of  new  municipalities.  Municipalities  are  growing  at  an  average  rate  of  5.2%,  while  the \nnational population as a whole is growing at about 2.4%, indicating that Nepal could have half of its population living in \nmunicipal areas 3 decades from now (UNDP 2001). \n\nHowever,  poverty  in  urbanizing  Nepal  is  somewhat  different  since  substantial  portions  of  municipal  areas  and  the \npopulation are, in fact, rural in both occupational structure and village settlement pattern. These villages and settlements \nin  the  municipalities  lack  basic  infrastructure  such  as  water  supply,  usable  roads,  drainage,  solid  waste  collection \nservice, electricity, and accessible schools. When poor villages are incorporated into municipalities, they lose all district-\nlevel village support from government. Municipalities, which are supposed to assume this support, are largely unable to \ndo  so  due  to  low  levels  of  revenue  sources  and  lack  of  external  support  for  programs  focusing  on  the  urban  poor  in \nNepal. \n\nGiven that substantial portions of the population in municipal areas are in fact rural in occupational structure, rural urban \nlinkages remain poor in most regions in terms of markets, transportation, information and service access. Poor farmers \nface high costs, inadequate information, and other barriers to agriculture and nonagriculture activities.  \n\nIn the project towns, about 51% of the sample households have access to piped water, 24% are using public standpipes, \nand the rest do not have access to safe drinking water. The water supply often is only intermittent. About one in three \nhouseholds  faces  a  serious  water  shortage  at  least  once  a  year,  and  about  one  in  six  all  year  around.  Water  quantity \ndelivered  is  mostly  below  50  liters  per  capita  per  day.  In  addition  water  quality  often  falls  below  World  Health \nOrganization  standards  for  drinking  water,  mainly  due  to  bacteriological  contamination  as  a  result  of  poor  sanitation \nfacilities.  Only  about  three  quarters  of  the  urban  population  have  access  to  toilets  while  about a quarter are forced to \ndefecate in open spaces such as riverbanks, drainage, and fields. Sewerage systems, often combined with storm water \ndrainage  systems,  are  limited  in  urban  areas.  The  final  treatment  of  sewage  is  often  inadequate.  As  a  result,  rivers in \nurban areas have often practically become open sewers, especially in towns during the dry season. Most municipalities \ncollect only 50-60 % of the domestic solid waste generated, and the balance is often burned or disposed of haphazardly \non the roadside.  \n\nThe  shortage  of  good  quality  water  and  inadequate  sewage  system  have  an  adverse  effect  on  public  health  and  the \nurban environment. Given that women are mainly responsible for family health maintenance and collection of water, the \nlack of basic piped water supply facilities is a greater burden on women.  \n \nADB\u2019s country strategy for Nepal emphasizes water supply, sanitation and urban development, and the need to target \nexcluded  groups,  to  reduce  both  poverty  and  inequality.  The  Project  will  foster  institutional development in nine urban \nareas  and  will  finance  infrastructure  improvements  with  a  focus  on  water  supply,  sewerage/wastewater  management, \nand  solid  waste  management  as  well  as  small  urban  infrastructure,  such  as  bus  terminal/bus  park,  market, \nslaughterhouse, and environmental awareness program. In addition, the Project will be linked with a parallel scheme on \nRural Urban Partnership Program (RUPP). The Project aims to improve living condition and health status of the people \nin  project  towns.  Access  to  safe  drinking  water,  improved  sanitation  and  environment  will  reduce  vulnerability  to \nenvironmental  hazards  for  the  communities  in  the  project  towns.  Improved  quantities  and  quality  of  domestic  water \nsupply  and  sanitation  facilities  will  reduce  morbidity  and  mortality  factor  for  young  children.  Availability  of  safe  drinking \nwater supply will reduce water-carrying time for women. Better environment in the urban area will improve the quality of \nhealth and productive capacity of the people. \n\n\f38\n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nProposed Classification \n\nSocioeconomic survey in the project towns indicates that a total of 22% of sample households belong to below poverty \nline.  The  distribution  of  poverty  among  the  project  towns  is  found  to  be  unequal.  The  highest  percentage of poor \nhouseholds  (59%)  is  in  Dhadingbesi,  followed  by  Bidur  (31%)  and  Ratnanagar  (21%).  Most  of  the  poor  households \nbelong  to  lower  castes.  Urban  poverty  in  the  project  towns  is  multifaceted,  ranging  from  lack  of  employment,  basic \nservices, such as water supply and sanitation, to substandard housing. The proposed Project will provide water supplies \nto the poor and low-caste communities through public water stand posts. The sanitation and wastewater management \nsubcomponent will provide public toilets, expanded sewerage pipe networks and simple wastewater treatment plants in \nnine  urban  areas.  The  system  will  be  designed  to  give  the  urban  poor  adequate  access  to  improved  sanitation.  The \nexpected benefits are public hygiene and public health improvement in low-income areas of the project towns, and less \npollution of groundwater and surface water in these urban areas. The improved public health would contribute to a more \nproductive  labor  force.  The  community-based  solid  waste  management  and  recycling  component  would  create \nemployment  for  the  urban  poor.  Socioeconomic  survey  data  indicates  that  over  70%  of  the  poor  in  all  municipalities \nsuffered  from  lack  of  employment  opportunities.  The  direct  impact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  reduction  will  be  through \nemployment generation in construction works.  \n\n  In  the  project  towns,  54%  of  the  poor  are  employed  in  agriculture,  while  26%  are  casual  laborers.  RUPP  will  develop \nlinkages  between  rural  and  urban  producer  groups  to  strengthen  the  local  economy  and  enhance  employment and \nincome-earning  opportunities  for  the  urban  poor,  low-caste  people,  and  Daliths  (lowest  caste  people).  The  producer \ngroups as well as urban petty vendors often face problems related to the market center, license for vending, space for \nvending  cart,  etc.  RUPP  would  provide  an  improved  market-place, collection centers, and market information to poor \nproducer groups and the vendors.

This  appendix  covers  the  project \ntown of Hetauda as a representative sample for the nine project towns. For the initial screening, \nADB's  checklist  of  environmental  parameters  for  selected  infrastructure  development  projects \nwas  used.  The  potential  major  impacts  or  benefits  of  the  Project  were  identified  next  and  an \nanalysis  of  whether  or  not  a  further  study  was  warranted  followed.  The  summary  IEE  (SIEE) \nsummarizes the screening of potential environmental impacts of the Project, suggests mitigation \nmeasures, and describes the  institutional requirements and environmental monitoring program. \nThe  SIEE  is  based  on  information  gathered  during  the  feasibility  study,  a  review  of  reports \navailable in the core subproject areas, and data collected during fact-finding by staff of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  Project  aims  to  address  critical  environmental  improvement \nneeds by preparing subprojects to facilitate sustainable urban development in the municipality of \nHetauda. \n\nThe  subcomponents  concerned  with  urban  and  environmental \n\n2. \nimprovements are (i) sewage treatment, (ii) water supply, and (iii) urban land development. \n\ninfrastructure \n\n3. \nThe 1997 Environmental Protection Regulations stipulates that an IEE is necessary for \nthe  subprojects.  The  land  to  be  acquired  for  project  activities  is  mostly  agricultural  land.  The \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure  will  bring  positive  impacts.  Temporary,  limited  negative  impacts \nthat will occur during construction can easily be mitigated. \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Subprojects \n\n1. \n\nSewage Treatment Plant \n\n4. \nThe  system  proposed  is  the  constructed  wetland  (CW)  system.  CW  is  a  biological \nwastewater  treatment  technology  designed  to  mimic  processes  found  in  natural  wetland \necosystems.  These  systems  utilize  wetland  plants,  soils,  and  their  associated  microorganisms \nto  remove  contaminants  from  wastewater.  The  basic  features  of  CW  are  a  bed  of  uniformly \ngraded sand or gravel with plants such as reeds growing on it. \n\n5. \nThe bed is lined with plastic or clay to prevent wastewater from leaching into the ground \nand  polluting  groundwater.  Wastewater  is  evenly  distributed  on  the  bed  and  flows  through  it \neither horizontally or vertically. As the wastewater flows through the bed, it gets treated through \nnatural  processes  \u2013  potential  pollutants  in  the  wastewater  stream  are  mechanically  filtered, \nchemically transformed, and biologically consumed. \n\n2. \n\nWater Supply \n\n6. \n\nDetails of the water supply subproject are summarized in the table. \n\nSewerage and Sewage Treatment \n\nWater Supply \n\nCombined  sewerage  system  will  be  used  and  the \ntreated  wastewater  discharged  into  the  river.  Two \nCW  treatment  plants  proposed  with  capacities  of \n341 and 808 cubic meters/day. Some land has to be \npurchased.  Other  components  include  laying  of \nabout 12.7 km sewers and cleaning of about 4.5 km \nexisting drains and sewers \n\n3 \n\nRehabilitation \nexisting \nof \nsystems,  including  rehabilitation  of \nan  existing \ninfiltration  gallery; \nconstruction of a tube well, a water \ntreatment plant, and 4 reservoirs of \n300-500  m3;  laying  transmission \nmains and distribution pipes \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n7. \nHetauda is an inner terai municipality situated 76 kilometers (km) east of Bharatpur. The \nChure,  Mahabharat,  and  Chandragiri  mountain  ranges  run  from  south  to  north  of  the \nMakwanpur  District  and  Hetauda  lies  south  of  the  district.  The  elevation  of  the  valley  ranges \nfrom 300 to 600 meters (m) above mean sea level between the Mahabharat and Chure ranges. \nThe  soil  of  the  valley  is  made  up  of  alluvium,  gravel,  boulder,  sand,  and  clay.  The  climate  of \nHetauda is tropical. The winter is dry and mild, and the summer hot and moist. Average annual \nrainfall  (from  the  southwest  monsoon)  is  2,313  millimeters.  There  is  plenty  of  surface  water  in \nHetauda.  The  main  river  is  the  Rapti,  which  enters  Hetauda  in  a  southwest  direction  and is \njoined  by  the  Karra  and  the  Kukhreni  Kholas.  Rivers  border  the  municipality  on  all  sides.  The \ngroundwater  table  fluctuates  from  2  to  4  m.  Groundwater  is  also  used  as  a  source  of  drinking \nwater. \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n8. \nThere are endangered fauna species in the vicinity, but there is no threat to them during \nor after construction, since environmental improvements are proposed in the core urban areas. \nThe  flora  is  dominated  by  tropical  deciduous  forests  consisting  of  Shorea  robusta, terminalia \ntomentosa, Dalbergia sisoo, Acacia catechu, and Adina cordifolia. Globally threatened birds in \nHetauda  are  the  white-rumped  vulture  (Gyps  bengalensis),  long-billed  vulture  (Gyps  indicus), \nand lesser adjutant (Leptoptilus javanicus). An endangered reptile species is the Indian python \n(Python morulus). \n\n3. \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\nThe population of Hetauda is 68,482 (2001). The town is the rural areas service center, \n9. \nfor  education,  health,  and  commerce.  It  had  been  undergoing  rapid  industrialization,  which \nslightly declined recently. Agriculture is still the main occupation. \n\n10. \nThe  population  served  by  piped  water  is  27%.  The  water  is  not  of  good  quality  due  to \nlack  of  proper  treatment.  Household  latrine  coverage  is  58%.  There  are  no  sewage  treatment \nfacilities in the town and sewage is ultimately discharged into nearby rivers. Surface drainage is \npoor.  The  town  is  accessible  by  road,  has  power  supply  from  the  national  grid,  and  has \ntelecommunication facilities and hospitals. \n\n4. \n\nQuality of Life \n\nAverage household occupancy in Hetauda is 9.1 persons. Water supply, sanitation, and \n\n11. \ndrainage facilities are inadequate and pose an environmental health hazard. \n\nD. \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n12. \nScreening  of  environmental  impacts  from  the individual subprojects (sewage treatment \nand  water  supply)  indicates  that  most  interventions  result  in  either  positive  or  insignificantly \nadverse socioeconomic or environmental impacts. \n\n1. \n\nSewage Treatment \n\na. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Location \n\n13. \n\nNo adverse environmental impacts are foreseen due to project location. \n\nb. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Design \n\nThere  should  be  no  major  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  with  the  biological \n14. \nwastewater treatment plants, since it would improve the health of the people. Furthermore, the \ntreatment system will be the CW system that uses reed beds that are aesthetically pleasant with \nno standing water for breeding mosquitoes, requires no electricity and mechanical equipment, \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nDuring  design,  the  following  aspects  must  be  carefully  looked  into,  planned,  designed, \n\nand  has  removal  efficiencies  of  more  than  97%  for  BOD  5  and  total  suspended  solids,  and \nremoval rates of more than 99% for total coliforms, E-coli and streptococcus. \n15. \nand monitored: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \nLand  acquisition  will  be  necessary  in  the  town.  Government  and  ADB  guidelines  in \n\nadequate capacity of the system, \nadequate protection of groundwater with the use of an impermeable lining, and \nproper sludge disposal. \n\n16. \ncompensating for land acquired will be followed. \n\nc. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Construction \n\n17. \nDuring construction of the sewerage/drainage system, care should be taken to minimize \nsoil erosion and disruption of traffic. The works of the contractors should be carefully monitored \nto  see  whether  they  are  following  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  specified  in  the \ncontract documents (workers' safety, sanitation at camps, use of local people as far as possible, \nand avoidance of child labor). There will be no significant negative impact during construction of \nthe CW system since the technology is very simple (using gravity flow, gravel, sand, and reeds). \n\nd. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Operations \n\n18. \nInadequate  monitoring  of  the  effluent  and  management  could  lead  to  river  pollution. \nMitigation  measures  to  minimize  adverse  impacts  will  be  to  design  an  efficient  impermeable \nlining  system  on  the  bottom  of  the  reed  beds  to  avoid  groundwater  pollution  and  to  ensure \nproper operation and management training. \n19. \n\nPositive impacts from sewage collection and treatment follow: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nThe town will become neater and cleaner. \nThe rivers will be less polluted. \nTourists will be attracted, thereby generating revenue. \nHealth hazards are minimized. \n\n2. \n\nWater Supply \n\nSurface  water  and,  to  a  very  limited  extent,  groundwater  are  the  water sources for the \n\n20. \nwater supply subcomponent in Hetauda. \n\na. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Location \n\n21. \n\nThere are no adverse environmental impacts due to project location in Hetauda. \n(i)  Resettlement is not required as the land for the deep tubewell and for the reservoirs \n\nbelongs to the municipality. \n\n(ii)  No historical/cultural monuments exist around the sites for the deep tubewell and for \n\nthe reservoirs and along the routes of the transmission mains. \n\nb. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Design \n\n22.  \n\nIf  the  following  points  are  considered  during  the  design  phase,  adverse  environmental \n\nimpacts can be mitigated: \n\n(i)  The new tubewell should be well protected with good drainage (for surface sources). \nDistribution  pipes  should  be  kept  away  from  drains  so  that  drain  water  cannot \ninfiltrate  the  distribution  system  and  contaminate  drinking  water.  The  town  should \nalso have a good drainage system to avoid ponding. Sedimentation and filtration (for \nsurface water sources) and chlorination should be done so that appropriate residual \nchlorine  is  available.  A  monitoring  plan  should  be  prepared  to  regularly  monitor  the \ndistribution system for leaks and the availability of residual chlorine. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\n(ii)  Sludge from sewage treatment plants should be disposed of properly on low lands. \n\nThe sludge disposal areas should be identified during design. \n\n(iii) Provision  should  be  made  for  security  fencing  and  good  drainage  and  security \n\npersonnel at the intake, treatment, and reservoir sites. \n\n(iv) Trees should be planted around the compound to keep down any noise generated. \n(v)  The  storage,  in-plant  handling  (occupational  health  hazards),  and  dosages  of \nchemicals must be addressed during the design phase, and procedures set up and \nguidelines  developed  for  handling  chlorine  (both  bleaching  powder  and  gaseous \nchlorine) and first-aid measures in case of emergencies. \n\n(vi) The laying of transmission lines in trenches during construction will not lead to loss of \nprecious ecology, loss of environmental aesthetics and soil erosion, and damage to \nwater  quality  and  land  values,  as  the  transmission  line  will  be  underground.  Grass \nthat will be destroyed during construction in laying the mains will rapidly grow back. \n\nc. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Construction \n\n23.  Minor,  temporary  adverse  impacts  to  the  environment  can  occur,  but  the  following \nmitigation measures can minimize the impacts: \n\n(i)  Precautionary  measures  should  be  taken  during  construction  to  avoid  collapses \nwhen excavating for reservoirs and boring deep wells. All excavated material should \nbe  safely  disposed  of.  Excavated  trenches  should  be  backfilled  properly  and \nconstruction activities during the rainy season should, if possible, be minimized. \n(ii)  Safety measures for workers, especially during construction of the reservoir, should \nbe  considered.  The  contractor  should  be  responsible  for  all  safety  measures, \nespecially  eye  protection,  safe  handling  of  chemicals,  provision  of  hard  hats  and \nsafety boots, and sanitation in the camps. As far as possible, local labor should be \nhired.  The  site  manager  should  properly  monitor  the  construction  activities  of  the \ncontractor  to  ensure  that  the  mitigation  measures  specified  in  the  contract \ndocuments are followed. \n\nd. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts due to Operations \n\n24.  Minor adverse impacts could occur during the regular operation of the system, but they \ncan be avoided by adequate staff training and operational supervision. \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n25. \nAs  Executing  Agency,  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW)  will  be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  and  implementing  the  Project.  The  Department  of  Urban \nDevelopment and Building Construction (DUDBC) under MPPW will be the primary Government \nagency responsible for project implementation. \n\n26. \nThe  Project  has  been  prepared  using  community  participation  at  all  stages  of \ndevelopment,  and it promotes implementation through nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and  the  private  sector,  wherever  feasible  and \nappropriate. The municipality will be the Implementing Agency for all the components, except for \nthe  capacity  building  component.  A  full-time  project  advisor  (PA)  will  advise  on  all  technical \naspects, and assist with recruiting consulting services and other implementation activities. \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Procedures and Institutions \n\n27. \nThe  Government  has  in  recent  years  felt  the  importance  of  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  and  made  it  mandatory  for  development  programs.  Separate  environmental \nguidelines for some sectors have been formulated and implemented. The Ministry of Population \nand Environment (MOPE) was established in 1996, and the Environment Protection Act (1997) \nand the Environmental Protection Regulations (1997) have been promulgated. Furthermore, the \nfirst amendment to the regulations took effect on 5 April 1999. \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n28. \nBesides  MOPE,  which  is  in  charge  of  environmental  management  for  all  sectoral \nagencies,  MPPW  has  overall  responsibility  for  environmental  monitoring  of  all  subprojects. \nMOPE gives final approval to an EIA. MPPW gives it to an IEE. \n29. \nThe  town  will  need  to  establish  two  units  for water supply, and sewerage and sewage \ntreatment  plant  with  adequately  qualified  staff  to  operate,  maintain,  and  regularly  monitor  the \nsystems. The human resources required to effectively run the systems have been identified and \nsecured. \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Management Plan \n\nThe  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plan  (EMMP)  will  be  so  designed  that \n30. \nthe contractor is monitored during the construction phase to see that the work is done according \nto  the  contract  documents  in  which  mitigation  measures  are  specified.  The  EMMP  will  also \nrequire  regular  monitoring  of  the  actual  environmental  impacts  during  project  operations  over \nthe  years  following  project  completion.  The  Social  and  Environmental  Division  of  the \nmunicipality  will  be  in  charge  of  this  monitoring.  Impacts  that  are  monitored  will  be  compared \nwith the anticipated impacts. The town will be equipped with a portable water quality testing kit \nto regularly monitor water and wastewater qualities. The details, extent, and frequency of testing \nwill be determined at the detailed design stage. \n\n3. \n\nImplementation of the EMMP \n\na. \n\nDuring Design \n\nEMMP monitoring activities will become a regular part of the town's activities. During the \n31. \ndesign phase, the project coordination office, PA, supported by his consultant, will ensure that \nmitigation measures are included in the design and the contract documents in compliance with \nthe Environmental Protection Act and Regulations. \n\nb. \n\nDuring Construction \n\n32. \nThe supervising officers concerned and contractors will ensure that works carried out are \naccording to the contract documents and that mitigation measures are carried out accordingly, \nwith the overall guidance of PA and PCO. \n\nc. \n\nAfter Construction \n\n33. \nThe  parties  that  will  be  responsible  during  the  postconstruction  phase  are  the \nestablished  units  (water  supply  and  sewerage)  that  would  regularly  monitor  the  systems, \nprepare monthly reports, and carry out necessary remedial actions. The staff of each unit will be \nadequately trained to look after the systems, environmental issues, and monitoring aspects so \nas to comply with environmental regulations. \n\nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n34. \nThe  subprojects  for  Hetauda  are  expected  to  have  only  negligible  negative  impacts  on \nthe  environment.  Such  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through  adequate  measures  and  regular \nmonitoring  during  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  phases.  The  Project  is  expected  to \nbring  about  significant  improvements  in  personal,  household,  and  community  hygiene  and  in \nenvironmental sanitation, thereby enhancing the quality of life. \n\nG. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe individual IEE conducted shows no adverse or harmful impacts of any significance \n\n35. \nare expected and, therefore, full-scale EIA is not required for any of the subprojects. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n53 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL AN ALYSES AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY \n\nA. \n\nGeneral \n\n1. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  were  reviewed  and  revised  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank's \n(ADB\u2019s)  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector \nProjects. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were calculated for major subcomponents in \nthe  nine  project  towns,  using  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. For \nrevenue-generating  components,  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  were  calculated \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Analysis of Projects . Financial sustainability of the \ntowns was assessed based on the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of \nInvestment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \nThe  estimated  costs  and  benefits  of  major  subprojects1 were valued at their economic \n2. \nprices using the domestic price numeraire, which adjusts border price equivalent values to their \nequivalent  domestic  prices  and  entails  the  application  of  shadow  price  adjustments  to  convert \nthe estimated financial costs to their equivalents. Taxes and duties were excluded, a standard \nexchange  rate  factor  of  1.11  was  applied  to  the  price  of  tradable goods, and a shadow wage \nrate factor of 0.70 was used to adjust for underemployment in the country.2 \n \n3. \nThe  economic  analysis  is  divided  into  water  supply  subprojects  for  five  project  towns, \nand  other  infrastructure  and  service  improvement  subprojects  including  sanitation  and \nwastewater  management,  neighborhood  road,  drainage,  and  water  supply  development,  river \ntraining, road upgrading, and supplementary urban facilities. \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply  \n\nThe  assumptions  in  the  economic  analysis  of  water  supply  follow.  The  capital  and \n4. \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs are based on the design capacity requirements in the \nplanning  period  of  20  years.  A  capital  allowance  equivalent  to  10%  of  the  total  capital  cost  is \nmade every 10 years to cover the cost of replacing the pump and other equipment, in addition to \nthe ordinary O&M expenditures for pressurized schemes. For gravity schemes, an allowance of \n2% every 10 years is provided for capital replacement. Water meters for pressurized schemes \nare assumed to be replaced every 7 years. A residual value equivalent to 50% of project costs \nis  assumed  in  year  20  to  take  account  of  the  remaining  economic  life  of  the  civil  works  and \npipelines,  which  have  an  assumed  economic  life  of  40  years.  The  major  O&M  costs  for  each \nsubproject are (i) operation, (ii) personnel, (iii) power, and (iv) maintenance. \n\n5. \nTable  A13.1  presents  a  summary  of  the  base  case  EIRRs,  the  economic  net  present \nvalues  at  a  12%  discount  rate,  and  the  average  incremental  economic  cost  (AIEC)  per  unit  of \nwater sold in the five project towns that have a water supply subproject. The AIEC provides a \nmeasure of the cost per cubic meter of the proposed subprojects and indicates tariffs needed to \nmeet full cost recovery for water supply. The AIEC is the discounted value of incremental capital \ncosts and operating costs (in economic prices) over a 20-year period divided by the discounted \nvalue  of  incremental  quantity  of  water  sales  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  investment.  Capital \n                                                 \n1  In accordance with the Asian Development Bank's Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban \nDevelopment  Sector  Projects,  smaller  subprojects  such  as  bus  terminal  and  market  improvements  were  not \nsubjected to a detailed economic internal rate of return analysis, but were examined using the cost-effectiveness \ncriteria. \n\n2  These adjustment factors are consistent with those used in other ADB-funded projects in Nepal such as the Small \n\nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project approved in September 2000. \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\ncosts  include  economic  cost  of  the  water  supply  subprojects.  The  discount  rate  used  is  the \nsocial opportunity cost of capital (SOCC) estimated at 12%. \n\nTable A14.1: Summary of Economic Evaluation for Water Supply \n\nTown \n\nEIRR (%) \n\nENPV \n(NRs million) \n\nAIEC \n(NRs/m3) \n\nBanepa \nPanauti \nDhulikel \nBharatpur \nHetauda \n\n28.9 \n25.1 \n22.3 \n22.6 \n23.0 \n\n163.13 \n101.13 \n118.74 \n141.42 \n92.76 \n\n31.80 \n28.52 \n51.38 \n17.07 \n20.67 \n\nAIEC = average incremental economic cost, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, \nENPV = economic net present values. \n \n\n6. \nTable  A13.2  summarizes  the  sensitivity  of  the  results  tested  in  different  scenarios.  It  is \nnoted  that  even  in  the  worst-case  scenario,  which  combines  a  10%  decrease  in  benefits  and \n10% increase in costs, all subprojects are still viable with EIRRs above 12.0%. The economic \nbenefits  are  generally  less  sensitive  to  capital  costs  and  O&M  than  to  benefit  streams.  These \nresults  indicate  that  the  success  of  the  Project  will  depend  heavily  on  the  realization  of  the \nbenefit streams. \n \n\nTable A14.2: Summary of the Sensitivity Analyses for Water Supply  \n\nTown \n\nEIRR and \nSI \n\nBase \nCase \n\nCapital Cost \n+10% \n\nO&M Cost + \n10% \n\nCapital and \nO&M Cost \n+10% (1) \n26.8 \n\nBenefits \n\u201310% \n(2) \n26.6 \n\n \n \n(1) + (2) \n24.6 \n\n28.8 \n\n26.9 \n\n0.67 \n150.00 \n20.6 \n\n0.73 \n137.00 \n23.3 \n\n0.69 \n146.00 \n23.4 \n\n0.80 \n124.00 \n23.1 \n\n0.05 \n2165.00 \n25.0 \n\nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV (%) \nEIRR (%) \nSI \nSV \n\nBanepa \n \n \nPanauti \n \n \nDhulikel \n \n \nBharatpur \n \n \nHetauda \n \n1.87 \n54.00 \n \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, SI = sensitivity indicator (percentage \nchange in EIRR/ percentage change in variable tested), SV = switching value (percentage of present value of net \nbenefits to the present value of a variable using a discount rate of 12%). \n\n28.9 \n \n \n25.1 \n \n \n22.3 \n \n \n22.6 \n \n \n23.0 \n \n \n\n0.05 \n2172.00 \n22.2 \n\n0.73 \n138.00 \n21.2 \n\n0.91 \n110.00 \n20.9 \n\n1.00 \n100.00 \n20.7 \n\n0.19 \n516.00 \n22.7 \n\n0.71 \n141.00 \n20.6 \n\n0.78 \n128.00 \n20.4 \n\n1.88 \n53.00 \n18.7 \n\n1.49 \n67.00 \n21.5 \n\n2.53 \n40.00 \n20.3 \n\n1.86 \n54.00 \n22.1 \n\n2.46 \n41.00 \n20.5 \n\n2.44 \n41.00 \n20.9 \n\n1.45 \n69.00 \n18.8 \n\n3.12 \n32.00 \n18.3 \n\n0.77 \n129.00 \n\n0.14 \n720.00 \n\n1.00 \n100.00 \n\n0.91 \n110.00 \n\n2. \n\nOther Project Components \n\na. \n\nSanitation and Wastewater Management Subprojects \n\nThe  sanitation  and  wastewater  management  subprojects  were  subjected  to  least-cost \n7. \nanalysis.  Sanitation  improvements  that  include  sewage  collection  and  reed  bed treatment are \nconsidered. Collection and off-site treatment are necessary because the density of population in \nthe  municipalities  makes  it  impractical  to  install  septic  tanks.  For  the  least-cost analysis, the \nsewage  collection/reed  bed  wastewater  treatment  and  the  sewerage  collection/conventional \nwastewater treatment are compared. \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\nFor the municipalities of Banepa, Panauti, Hetauda, and Bharatpur, information and cost \n8. \nestimates  of  sanitation  projects  together  with  water  use  and  significant  amount  of  cos t \ninformation  for  water  systems  were  available.  For  the  five  other  municipalities,  information  on \nsanitation  projects  was  available,  but  there  was  no  data  on  water  use.  The  cost  of  the \nconventional  treatment  plant  was  based  on  earlier  studies  of  a  wastewater treatment plant for \nKathmandu  in  2000.  The  unit  cost  was  adjusted  for  inflation  to  arrive  at  the  present  rate  of \nNRs13,400 for construction of a wastewater treatment plant with capacity of 1 m3/day. \n\nTable A14.3: Summary of Sanitation Least Cost Analysis \n\n(NRs million) \n\nTown \n\nSewerage System with Reed \nBed Treatment \n\nSewerage System with \nConventional Treatment \n\nLeast-Cost \nOption \n\nCapital \nCost \n\n113.77 \n106.83 \n 49.42 \n137.42 \n 92.29 \n117.51 \n  5.52 \n  4.96 \n  6.82 \n\nO&M \nCost \n(2009) \n0.73 \n0.60 \n0.46 \n0.70 \n0.55 \n0.61 \n0.21 \n0.17 \n0.31 \n\nBanepa \nDhulikhel \nPanauti \nBharatpur \nRatnanagar \nHetauda \nBidur \nKamalamai \nDhadingbesi \n\nNPV \n\nCapital \nCost \n\nO&M Cost \n(2009) \n\nNPV \n\n 93.85 \n 87.65 \n 41.55 \n112.37 \n 75.90 \n 96.17 \n  5.45 \n  4.80 \n  7.04 \n\n108.27 \n102.33 \n 46.32 \n133.09 \n 89.14 \n111.89 \n   4.30 \n   4.33 \n   5.64 \n\n1.73 \n1.37 \n1.09 \n1.54 \n1.18 \n1.48 \n0.40 \n0.39 \n0.47 \n\n 94.95 \n 88.10 \n 42.36 \n113.20 \n 76.67 \n 96.34 \n  5.51 \n  5.51 \n  6.96 \n\nReed Bed \nReed Bed \nReed Bed \nReed Bed \nReed Bed \nReed Bed \nReed Bed \nReed Bed \nConventional \nTreatment \n\nTable A13.3 shows the result of sanitation least-cost analysis with reed bed treatment \n\nNPV = net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance. \n \n9. \nsystem as the least-cost option for all towns except Dhadingbesi where the conventional \nwastewater treatment system is the least-cost. \n \n10. \nFurthermore, past experience in operating a wastewater treatment plant in Nepal shows \nthat  O&M  costs  and  ease  of  operation  with  minimum  use  of  electromechanical  equipment  are \ncrucial  for  sustainable  operation.  Because  the  reed  bed  wastewater  treatment  system  meets \nthese requirements, in addition to being less expensive than the conventional system in most of \nthe  project  towns,  it  was  adopted  for  the  Project.  The  analysis  shows  that  revenue  from \nsewerage is sufficient to meet its O&M cost. \n\nb. \n\nRiver Training Subprojects \n\n11. \nRiver  training  involves  construction  of  embankments  to  protect  against  erosion  in \nBharatpur, Hetauda, and Kamalamai.  River training in the three project towns will benefit these \nareas:  low-lying  land  on  the  Rapti  river  at  wards  1  and  11  and  on  Karra  River  at  ward  4  in \nHetauda; low-lying land on the Narayani River in Bharatpur; and an old settlement area in Dhura \nbazaar and sports ground in Kamalamai. Recent damages as a result of heavy flooding include \nloss of land along Karra River in Hetauda, limited use of low-lying land in Bharatpur, and loss of \nland and crop at sports ground in Kamalamai. \n\n12. \nRiver  training  is  the  least-cost  approach  and  is  primarily  based  on  the  rates  of  gabion \nworks  available  from  the  UN  Park  Development  Project  in  Kathmandu.  The  length  of  the \nprotective embankment is 1.50 kilometers (km) for Bharatpur, 0.75 km for Hetauda, and 0.29 km \nfor Kamalamai. Two gabion boxes 3.5 meters (m) wide x 1.0 m long x 0.30 m high will be placed \nadjacent to each other to cover the riverbed 7.0-meter-wide. The embankment is 2.27 m high. \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nThe inclined side of the embankment is 3.79 m and consists of earth filling at the base, 0.30 m \ndry stone pitching in the middle layer, and reinforced concrete rib as the top layer. \n\nc. \n\nRoad Upgrading Subprojects \n\nRoad  upgrading  involves  blacktopping  the  earthen  road  in  Banepa,  Dhulikhel,  and \n13. \nRatnanagar, based on the priority lists provided by the towns. The coverage varies. In Banepa, \nthe six roads to be covered are 1.6 km along Sahidmarg road, 1.4 km along Bhakteshwormarg \nroad,  1.0  km  along  Rajdasmarg  road,  1.0  km  along  Bhimsenmarg  road,  0.25  km  along \nLaxchcheshwarmarg  road,  and  0.25  km  along  Shreekhandamarga  road.  In  Dhulikhel,  the  two \nroads  to  be  covered  are  3.0  km  along  Shreekhandapur  and  1.0  km  along  Charandada.  In \nRatnanagar,  the  road  to  be  covered  is  4.0  km  along  Bagmara  Souharar.  The  existing  gravel \nroads cause slow flow of traffic. \n\nThe  cost  of  road  upgrading  is  based  on  the  least-cost approach and the unit costs of \n14. \nroads are based on cost per km of recent Department of Roads projects. In Banepa, the width \nof  the  six  roads  is  uniform  at  4.5  m.  In  Dhulikhel,  one  road  is  8.0  m  wide  and  another  road  is \n4.5 m  wide.  In  Ratnanagar,  the  road  is  8.0  m  wide.  The  scarified,  leveled,  and  compacted \nexisting surface will be covered with a 0.15 m subbase course of gravel packing, 0.20 m base \ncourse of gravel packing, and 0.05 m dense graded asphalt concrete topping. \n\nC. \n\nDistribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n\n15. \nbeneficiaries, analysis of the distribution of benefits, and poverty impact analysis. \n\nPoverty impact analysis was carried out at these three stages: analysis of subproject \n\n1. \n\nAnalysis of Subproject Beneficiaries \n\nBenefits  from  the  water  supply  subproject  will  be  the  lower  cost  of  water  and  the \n16. \nexpected  increase  in  consumption  valued  in  financial  prices/tariffs.  The  consumers  will  also \nbenefit  from  the  economic  value  of  nonphysical  losses  avoided.  Where  the  financial  cost  of \nlabor  exceeds  its  opportunity  cost,  the  difference  accrues  as  a  gain  to  the  laborers  (unskilled \nlabor), in both construction and operation phases of the subproject. \n\n17. \nThe economy loses where economic costs exceed financial costs and economic costs \ninclude cost of the sewerage subproject. There is a loss to the utility because not all of the full \nfinancial  costs,  including  capital  costs,  are  recovered  where  financial  tariffs/revenues  are  less \nthan economic benefits. \n\n2. \n\nDistribution Analysis of Benefits \n\nDistribution  analysis  is  used  to  identify  more  closely  those  who  gain  from  the  project \n18. \nbenefits and to serve as a basis for the poverty impact analysis. For the purpose of distribution \nanalysis, both financial and economic costs are discounted at the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 12%. The main participants are the government, the utility, the consumers, and labor. \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis \n\n19. \nHaving  allocated  economic  benefits  to  different  groups  in  the  economy,  it  is  time  to \nestimate the proportion of benefits accruing to the poor. It is necessary to assess the proportion \nof Government expenditure reaching the poor, defined as those living below the poverty line. An \nassessment  of  government  expenditure  assumes  that,  on  average,  around  14.75%  of  all \nGovernment's expenditure reaches the poor. (Refer to ADB's draft poverty handbook calculation \nfor Nepal.) \n\nLosses  to  the  Government/economy  reduce  available  Government  funds,  thereby \n\n20. \ndecreasing Government expenditures directly targeted to the needs of the poor. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nIt is necessary to estimate the proportion of unskilled labor for a subproject that could be \n21. \nsupplied by the poor in each respective town. It is estimated that the poor will provide 70% of \nunskilled labor in the construction and operational phases. \n\n22. \nIt is necessary to estimate that proportion of the poor that would become  customers of \nthe utility. Because the project covers urban areas where there is presently no water supply and \nis  targeted  to  these  poorer  urban  sections  of  the  towns,  it  is  assumed  that  there  will  be  more \npoor  customers  among  those  representing  the  number  of new connections. Therefore, for the \npurposes  of  the  analysis,  it  is  estimated  that  the  proportion  of  poor  people  receiving  supply  is \n20% greater than the average level of poor people in the municipality. \n\n4. \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\n23. \nTable A13.4 shows the results of poverty impact analysis for the five project towns with a \nwater  supply  subproject.  The  poor  benefit  as  consumers  and  as  labor  providers,  but  will  face \npart of the costs of the Project through the costs borne by government. A poverty impact ratio \n(PIR), expressing the proportion of net economic benefits accruing to the poor, is calculated by \ncomparing the net economic benefits to the poor with the net economic benefits to the economy \nas a whole. The poverty impact ratio for all but two towns is greater than the share of the poor in \nthe overall gross domestic product (GDP) of 14.75%. \n \n\nTable A14.4: Net Benefit Accruing to the Poor through Consumption, \nGovernment, and Labor and the Poverty Impact Ratio for the Towns \n\nTown \nBanepa \nDhulikhel \nPanauti \nBhatatpur \nHetauda \n\nConsumers \n192 \n163 \n123 \n139 \n141 \n\nGovernment \n\n-1.0 \n-4.0 \n-2.0 \n-39.0 \n-11.0 \n\nLabor \n(in NRs million) \n6.0 \n8.0 \n0.5 \n0.0 \n1.0 \n\nPIR \n0.29 \n0.28 \n0.28 \n0.14 \n0.10 \n\nD. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n24. \nBasic  assumptions  used  in  computing  the  FIRRs  include  the  following:  (i) all revenues \nand costs are expressed in constant September 2002 prices on an incremental basis; (ii) project \ninvestment  costs  were  derived  from  estimated  costs,  less  price  contingencies  and  interest \nduring  construction;  and  (iii)  capital  expenditures  are  recorded  at  the  time  they  are  incurred, \nwhile interest and depreciation are excluded. \n\n1. \n\nWater Supply \n\n25. \nThe purpose of the financial cost-benefit analysis is to assess the financial viability of the \nproposed subproject. It focuses on the additional financial benefits (usually in terms of additional \nrevenues, and capital and operating cost savings or reductions) attributable to the subproject for \nthe  prospective  operating  entities,  rather  than  the  economy  as  a  whole.  The  resulting  FIRR \nindicates  the  profitability  of  the  subproject  (Table  A13.5),  and  should  exceed  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  to  be  financially  viable.  The  WACC  of  the  water  supply \ncomponents is estimated to be 4.6%. \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.5: Average Incremental Financial Costs \n\nTown \nEIRR (%) \nFIRR (%) \nAIEC (NRs/m 3) \nAIFC (NRs/m 3) \nAverage Tariff (NRs/m 3) \nEconomic Subsidy (NRs/m 3) \nFinancial Subsidy (NRs/m 3) \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, AIEC = average  \nincremental economic cost, AIFC = average incremental financial cost. \n\nDhulikhel  Bharatpur  Hetauda \n22.6 \n9.0 \n17.1 \n14.0 \n11.0 \n6.1 \n3.0 \n\nPanauti \n25.1 \n7.2 \n28.5 \n30.2 \n19.3 \n9.2 \n10.9 \n\nBanepa \n28.9 \n7.3 \n31.8 \n33.5 \n22.0 \n9.8 \n11.5 \n\n23.0 \n7.0 \n20.7 \n19.3 \n12.8 \n7.9 \n6.5 \n\n22.3 \n6.5 \n51.4 \n54.1 \n33.1 \n18.3 \n11.0 \n\nThe capital and operating cost streams are those used in the economic analysis with the \n26. \ninclusion of duties and taxes that would be incurred on capital and operating costs. The benefit \nstreams  are  the  revenues  derived  from  water  sales  to  domestic  and  nondomestic customers \nbased on the tariffs for five project towns as discussed at the stakeholders meeting on 27 July \n2001 and 4 September 2002 and revised to recover costs. Average tariffs per cubic meter are \nset  to  cover  O&M  costs,  repayment  of  30%  of  initial  capital  costs,  plus  capital  replacement \ncosts. \n\nRevenues are derived from water sales from private taps, assuming full plumbing (100 \n27. \nlitres per capita per day [lcd]) and yard taps (60-65 lcd), and public taps and commercial sales. \nIn  the  case  of  public  taps,  households  are  assumed  to  pay  the  basic  rate.  Nondomestic \ncustomers are assumed to pay the upper rate. Institutional customers are treated as domestic \ncustomers. An allowance of 2.5% for bad debts is assumed on the small systems for Banepa, \nPanauti, and Dhulikhel, and 10% for the larger systems of Hetauda, and Bharatpur. \n\n28. \nThe capital costs include the cost of connections and meters. Customers are expected \nto bear these costs through their 20% contribution to system development costs. As a minimum, \ncustomers are assumed to meet the cost of connection of NRs2,400 per household. \n\n29. \nTable  A13.6  shows  FIRRs  ranging  from  6.5%  for  Dhulikhel  to  9.0%  for  Bharatpur. The \nwater  supply  subprojects  for  the  five  towns  were  found  to  be  financially  viable  with  base  case \nFIRRs  exceeding  the  calculated  WACC  of  4.6%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  even  in \nthe worst case scenario, the FIRRs for all five Project towns met the minimum WACC of 4.6%. \n\nTable A14.6: Summary of the FIRRs (%) for Water Supply \n\nTown \n\nBase Case \n\nCapital \nCost +10% \n\nO&M Cost \n+ 10% \n\nBanepa \nPanauti \nDhulikhel \nBharatpur \nHetauda \n\n7.3 \n7.2 \n6.5 \n9.0 \n7.0 \n\n6.5 \n6.5 \n5.8 \n8.1 \n6.1 \n\n7.1 \n7.0 \n6.4 \n8.7 \n6.7 \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance. \n\nCapital and \nO&M Cost \n+10% (1) \n6.3 \n6.2 \n5.7 \n7.8 \n5.9 \n\nBenefits \n- 10% \n(2) \n6.2 \n6.1 \n5.6 \n7.6 \n5.8 \n\n \n \n(1) + (2) \n5.3 \n5.2 \n4.7 \n6.4 \n4.7 \n\n2. \n\nTariff Structures, Average Monthly Water Bills, and Affordability \n\na. \n\nTariff Structures \n\n30. \nTable  A13.7  summarizes  the  tariff  structure,  average  monthly  water  bills,  and \naffordability.  Tariffs  have  been  set  with  affordability  in  mind  and  on  the  assumption  that  the \nwater utility must maintain a positive cash flow from operations throughout the forecast period. \nThis  essentially  means  that  average  tariffs  set  for  the  forecast  period  must  generate  sufficient \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nfunds  to  cover  operating  costs  and  debt  service  as  well  as  to  meet  the  costs  of  meter \nreplacement  or  rehabilitation  (commencing  in  year  7  and  estimated  at  NRs1,350  per \nconnection) and replacement of mechanical and electric equipment (estimated at 10% of initial \ncapital  costs  in  year  10).  Table  A13.7  sets  out  the  average  tariff  to  be  paid  by  a  consumer \nconsuming  100  lcd  for  the  average  income  household  and  60-65 lcd  for  the  low  income \nhousehold. \n\nTable A14.7: Tariff Structure, Monthly Water Bills, and Affordability \n\n \n\nBanepa \n\nPanauti  Dhulikhel  Bharatpur  Hetauda \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProposed Water Tariff \nIncrease (NRs/m 3) \n0 - 10 m 3  \n> 10 m 3  \nAverage  \nWater Consumption \n(m 3/mo) \nAverage HH  \nLow Income HH \nWater Bill (NRs/HH/mo) \nAverage HH  \nLow-Income HH \nAffordability (%HH Income) \nAverage HH  \nLow-Income HH \nHH = household, m 3 = cubic meter. \n\n \n\n27.0 \n9.0 \n\n \n\n665.0 \n139.5 \n\n \n9.6 \n5.0 \n\nb.

In  Bharatpur,  NRs280  per  month  represents  2.6% of \nhousehold income. In low-income households, the income spent on water bills of NRs146 and \nNRs140  represents  4.2%  in  Hetauda  and  5.0%  in  Banepa.  The  large  household  size  in \nBharatpur  means  that  a  low-income  household\u2019s  water  bill  for  13  m3  would  represent 5% of \nhousehold income. The results are within the accepted guidelines of affordability where monthly \ncharges are regarded as affordable up to 5% - 6% of monthly household income for low-income \nhouseholds. \n \nE. \n\nFinancial Capability of Implementing Agencies \n\n32. \nA financial capability analysis was carried out for the proposed implementing agencies of \nthe Project. Financial projections for the towns were prepared for the period FY2003  - FY2022. \nThe financial projections include proposals for improved revenue generation from, in particular, \nthe  land  and  property  tax  as  part  of  municipal  institutional  strengthening.  For  the  five  project \ntowns  that  have  water  supply  subprojects,  the  financial  projections  for  the  water  supply \nsubprojects were carried out separately. \n\nThe  projections  assume  increases  in  tax  rates,  increases  in  collection  efficiency,  and \n33. \nsome  modest  increase  in  levels  of  housing  stock  into  higher  value  brackets  over  the  forecast \nperiod. The integrated property tax increases from NRs200 per year in 2003 to NRs400 per year \nin 2004 and NRs500 per year in 2005 for properties valued at less than NRs 1 million. Rates for \nrural  households  are  assumed  at  20%  of  urban  rates  and  reflect  a  lower  level  of  municipal \nservices provided, but the rate will increase from NRs40 per year in 2003 to Rs80 per year in \n2004  and  NRs100  per  year  in  2007.  Collection  efficiency  is  expected  to  improve  over  the \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nprojection  period.  By  2010,  it  is  assumed  that  all  project  towns  collect  90%  of  potential/gross \nrevenues.  With  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  leading  to  increased  revenue \ngeneration  through  introduction  of  property-based  taxes  and  more  efficient  collection,  the \nfinancial projections show that financing for the Project, especially debt servicing, is within the \ncapacity of each project town. \n\n34. \nThe local development tax is assumed to continue at present levels and to remain as the \nmajor  source  of  revenues  over  the  projection  period.  Professional  or  business  taxes  are \nassumed to represent a major future source of revenue with improved collection and higher tax \nrates.  Through  the  increased  effort  to  formulate,  bill,  and  collect  business  taxes  to  support \nmunicipal activities, the professional or business taxes are expected to increase by six-fold over \nand above the expected GDP growth, assumed at 5% per annum over the next 5 years. \n\n35. \nwith GDP growth at 5% per annum. \n\nOther  existing  municipal  taxes  and  fees  are  assumed  to  increase  in  real  terms,  in  line \n\n36. \nIt is assumed that households connected to the wastewater system would pay a monthly \ncharge of NRs20 in eight municipalities and NRs10 in Dhadingbesi in line with the willingness to \npay. Commercial customers would also be connected and hotels would be charged on people \nequivalents  on  the  basis  of  average  occupancy.  For  the  neighborhood  road,  drainage,  and \nwater supply development subprojects, the funds for loan repayment would be provided through \nsales of reserve plots. \n\n37. \nOn  the  basis  of  the  preceding  assumptions,  revenues  rise  faster  than  operating  costs, \nproviding surplus funds to contribute to capital expenditures and debt repayment. By 2010, it is \nassumed  that  all  participating  project  towns  are  levying  property  taxes  at  the  proposed  levels \nand  achieving  a  collection  efficiency  of  90%.  With  current  population  growth  rates  and  higher \nproperty values, all project towns are expected to have surplus cash on hand by FY2020. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \nNRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Nepalese rupee (NRe/NRs) \n$0.013 \nNRs76.73 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCBO \nDUDBC \n", "EA \nEIA \nEIRR \nFIRR \nGTZ \n", "IA \nICB \nIEE \nKfW \nLCB \nLcd \nMOF \nMOPE \nMPPW \nNWSC \nO&M \nPA \nPCO \nPIU \nPPMS \nRUPP \nTDF \nUEIP \nUNDP \nVDC \nWACC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \ncommunity-based organization \nDepartment of Urban Development and Building Construction, \nMPPW \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nfinancial internal rate of return \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency \n", "for Technical Cooperation) \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (German Development Bank) \nlocal competitive bidding \nlitres per capita per day \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Population and Environment \n\u2013  Ministry of Physical Planning and Works \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Nepal Water Supply Corporation \noperation and maintenance \nproject advisor \nproject coordination office \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance monitoring system \nRural-Urban Partnership Program \nTown Development Fund \nUrban and Environmental Improvement Project \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nvillage development committee \nweighted average of capital cost \n", "NOTES \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 15 July.
