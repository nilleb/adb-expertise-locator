The  project  will:  (i)  strengthen  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  Philippine  Competition  Commission  (PCC)  to  foster  competition, \n(ii) establish  a  cross-government  staff  development  program  for  competition  policy;  and \n(iii) ensure the sustainability of the reforms by establishing an academic center of excellence in \ncompetition law and policy. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  challenges.  The  Philippines  has  been  an  economic  leader  among  the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  member  countries  since  the  global  financial \ncrisis  in  2008.  Economic  growth  averaged  6.3%  per  year  during  2010\u20132018.  To  maintain  this \nmomentum,  the  Philippine  Development  Plan  (PDP),  2017\u20132022  continues  the  government\u2019s \nstrong emphasis on inclusive growth. Under the PDP, the government has set a strategic target \nto reach upper middle-income status by 2022. To meet this goal, effective market competition is \nessential as it fosters an efficient allocation of scarce resources and encourages the adoption of \nmodern  technology.  An  uncompetitive  market  is  prone  to  collusion  and  abuse  of  market \ndominance.  The  result  is  often  substandard  service  delivery  with  exorbitant  prices,  which \nadversely  affects  consumer  welfare.  Moreover,  research  indicates  that  the  adoption  of \nappropriately  structured  and  timed  competition  policy  can  help  an  economy  avoid  the  middle-\nincome trap.2 In recognition of this challenge, the PDP highlights enhancing market competition \nas  a  crosscutting  strategy. 3  Accordingly,  the  government  has  committed  to  creating  an \nenvironment  that  penalizes  anticompetitive  practices,  facilitates  the  entry  of  new  players,  and \nsupports regulatory reforms. \n \nHowever,  the  Philippine  competition  environment  remains  weak  and  is  a  major  factor \n4. \nconstraining  economic  growth  and \ninclusiveness.  The  World  Economic  Forum  Global \nCompetitiveness Report, 2017\u20132018 ranking shows the Philippines as the 4th largest market in \nSoutheast  Asia,  but  the  country  needs  to  improve  business  dynamism  and  product  market \nefficiency (Table 1). According to product market regulation indicators, Philippine markets display \nhigher levels of restrictiveness than comparator countries4 in three main areas: (i) barriers to trade \nand  investment;  (ii)  barriers  to  entrepreneurship;  and  (iii) state  involvement  in  business \noperations.5 Notably, the Philippines has important sectors , with high market concentration that \n\n                                                \n1  Republic Act 10667 was signed into law on 21 July 2015. \n2  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development.  2016.

In addition, the price-cost margin is high in many goods \nand  services  markets,  including  beverages,  agricultural  products,  disease  and  pest  control \nservices, and many types of transport services.6 This leads to higher prices and lower welfare of \nthe population. \n \n\nTable 1: Global Competitiveness Index Rankings of Nine ASEAN Member States* \n\nBusiness \nDynamism \n\n \n\nProduct Market \nEfficiency \n\n \n\nMarket  \nSize \n\n \n\nSingapore \nMalaysia \nBrunei Darussalam \nViet Nam \nPhilippines \nThailand \nIndonesia \nLao PDR \nCambodia \n\n12 \n21 \n56 \n76 \n86 \n93 \n98 \n129 \n131 \n\nSingapore \nMalaysia \nThailand \nIndonesia \nBrunei Darussalam \nLao PDR \nCambodia \nViet Nam \nPhilippines \n\n1 \n12 \n37 \n58 \n68 \n72 \n76 \n81 \n99 \n\nIndonesia \nThailand \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nViet Nam \nSingapore \nCambodia \nLao PDR \nBrunei Darussalam \n\n10 \n18 \n24 \n31 \n32 \n37 \n86 \n108 \n116 \n\nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n* The ranking is out of a total of 137 countries. \nSource: World Economic Forum. 2017. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2017\u20132018. Geneva. \n\n \n5. \nHistorically,  the  Philippines  lacked  a  unified  competition  law  and  instead  relied  on \ndispersed outdated regulations to deal with competition-related issues.7 To address this gap, the \ngovernment enacted a comprehensive competition law, the PCA, in July 2015. The law aims to: \n(i) protect consumers by giving them access to a wider choice of goods and services at lower \nprices; and (ii) promote competitive business and encourage market players to be more efficient \nand innovative. \n \nThe  PCA  formally  created  the  PCC,  an  independent  quasi-judicial  body  that  promotes \n6. \ncompetition across all economic sectors. The organizational structure of the PCC consists of six \ncore offices: (i) administrative and legal; (ii) financial, planning, and management; (iii) competition \nenforcement;  (iv)  mergers  and  acquisitions;  (v)  economics;  and  (vi)  communications  and \nknowledge  management.  Staff  grew  from  the  initial  10  staff  in  2016  to  167  staff  in  2019.  The \nPCC\u2019s mandate includes primary jurisdiction over enforcing and implementing the PCA and its \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations.  This  includes:  (i)  conducting  investigations  and  deciding \ncases involving any violation under the PCA; (ii) reviewing proposed mergers and acquisitions to \nprohibit transactions with an anti-competitive effect, (iii) applying remedies such as injunctions, \ndivestiture,  and  disgorgement  of  excess  profits;   (iv)  conducting  administrative  proceedings \nincluding the issuance of sanctions, fines or penalties; and (v) issuing subpoenas to require the \nproduction  of  documents,  books  and  records.  To  meet  this  mandate,  the  PCC  executes \nmemoranda of agreement to ensure the support of sector regulators and government agencies \non competition enforcement.8 \n \n\n                                                \n6  The  price-cost  margin  for  a  product/service  is  the  difference  between  the  price  and  the  marginal  cost  of  the \nproduct/service  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  price.  This  measures  the  distance  between  the  price  and  the \ncompetitive price. \n\n7  The  1987  Philippine  Constitution  and  various  legislation  (e.g.,  Corporation  Code,  Price  Act,  and  Electric  Power \nIndustry Reform Act) governed the prohibition and regulation of monopolies, combinations in restraint of trade, and \nother unfair competitive practices.  \n\n8  The parties to the agreements are required to provide each other with investigation and enforcement support, and \n\naccess to information and documents.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fThese reforms are also consistent with the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025, \n7. \nwhich includes a consistent regulatory and policy environment for competition as a key priority. \nCountries adopting the ASEAN Competition Action Plan, 2016\u20132025, including the Philippines, \npursue  five  strategic  goals:  (i)  enacting  national  competition  legislation;  (ii)  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  competition  authorities;  (iii)  establishing  regional  cooperation  arrangements;  \n(iv) fostering competition awareness; and (v) harmonizing competition policy and law. \n \n8. \nBinding  constraints.  The  PCC  faces  three  primary  constraints  in  enforcing  the \ncompetition law. First, it is newly formed and has not established its capacity and credibility as a \ncompetition  authority.  The  PCC  must  install  institutional  functions  and  build  technical  skills  to \nenforce the competition law and use its powers to investigate, stop, and prevent anticompetitive \npractices. Effective enforcement also requires intensive advocacy programs to build consensus, \nawareness, and an understanding of prohibitions under the PCA and the role of the PCC.  \n \n9. \nSecond, the promotion of pro-competitive policies requires close coordination with, and \nthe support of, other agencies with competition-related mandates. However, the enforcement of \ncompetition  law  is  also  new  to  these  agencies.  For  example,  the  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment Authority (NEDA) is responsible for high-level national policies on competition. The \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for litigating on behalf of government agencies. Upon \nreferral from the PCC, the DOJ will conduct investigations and prosecute any ensuing criminal \ncases. For litigation or court proceedings involving competition cases, the Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral (OSG) represents the PCC as statutory counsel. Further, these agencies do not have \nready opportunities to continuously learn new trends, best theories, state-of-the-art practices, and \nthe latest research on competition law and policy. Therefore, comprehensive support outside of \nthe  PCC  will  be  necessary  to  strengthen  the  technical  capacity  of  all  agencies  mandated  to \nenforce the PCA and promote market competition. \n \n10. \nFinally,  efforts  to  develop  system-wide  capacity  must  include  a  ready  supply  of \ndomestically  sourced  expert  practitioners,  research  papers,  civil  discourse,  and  awareness \ncampaigns. Typically, the academic community plays a crucial role in completing the ecosystem \nneeded  to  maintain  pro-competition  policies.  However,  academia  currently  lacks  programs, \ncourses,  and  seminars  on  competition  law  and  economics.  This  prevents  the  creation  of  a \nsustained and reliable source of knowledge and highly qualified specialists who can maintain and \nimprove the competition regime over time. \n \n11. \nGovernment strategy. The PDP calls for enhancing market competition by fostering an \nenvironment  that  penalizes  anticompetitive  practices,  facilitates  market  entry,  and  supports \nregulatory  reforms  to  stimulate  investments  and  innovation.  The  government  recognizes  the \nimportance of strengthening institutional and individual capacities to create a knowledge base for \neffective  implementation  of  the  PCA.  The  PCC  has  developed  a  strategic  and  operational \nbusiness  plan  that  incorporates  an  institutional  capacity  development  assistance  framework.9  \nAdditionally, the PCC completed a capacity and training needs assessment for the judiciary and \nlawyers in government agencies with competition-related mandates.10 \n \n\n                                                \n9  The Institutional Capacity Development Assistance Framework, 2017\u20132019 was developed with support from the \n\nAustralian competition authority as a diagnostic assessment of capacity gaps and support needed.  \n\n10 The training needs assessment was conducted as part of the \u201cSharing UK competition policy and best practice to \nsupport the formulation of the Philippines\u2019 first National Competition Policy by strengthening regulatory skills to enable \nincreased growth and reduced barriers to investment\u201d project.  \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nStrategic alignment. The project supports the operational priorities of Strategy 2030 of \n12. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), as shown in Table 2.11 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the Philippines, 2018\u20132023 on capacity development.12 \n \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \nAddressing remaining \npoverty and reducing \ninequalities \n\nStrengthening governance \nand institutional capacity \n\nTable 2: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nCapacity Building to Foster Competition Project \n\n\u2022  Promoting effective competition in trade, industry, and other \ncommercial economic activities will improve the business \nenvironment and market efficiency, leading to lower prices and \nimproved service delivery quality, and ultimately to higher \nconsumer welfare especially for those in the lower-income groups. \n\n\u2022  The center of excellence on competition will improve education \n\nand training opportunities for current and prospective government \nofficials and stakeholders, leading to a steady stream of \ncompetition law and policy experts. \n\n\u2022  Government employees in agencies with competition-related \n\nmandates will be provided with lifelong learning opportunities on \ncompetition policy to create a critical mass of reform-minded \ngovernment officials that can improve the competition environment \nover time. \n\n Source: Asian Development Bank \n \n13. \nDevelopment coordination.  The United States Agency for International Development \nsupported the legal drafting and approval process  of the PCA. The Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation  and  Development  and  other  bilateral  development  agencies  such  as  Australia, \nGermany,  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  the  United  Kingdom  have  contributed  to  the \nestablishment of a competition policy framework in the Philippines. Initiatives include the research \nand development of knowledge products, policy advisory and advocacy, and training for various \nlevels of government officials on competition policy. As a newly established institution, the PCC \nhas  actively  sought  assistance from  various  donors.  The  PCC  established  a  dedicated  unit  to \nmonitor the progress of development partner assistance, ensure the optimal use of resources, \nand minimize the risk of duplication. ADB has assisted the PCC with this task by taking on the \ncoordinating  role  as  lead  development  partner.  Further,  the  PCC  regularly  organizes  the \nPartnerships for Competition Development Forum, which serves as the coordination platform.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  market  competition  enhanced,  as \n14. \nenvisaged  in  the  PDP.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  competition  environment \nimproved.13  \n \nOutput  1:  Institutional  capacity  of  the  Philippine  Competition  Commission \n15. \nstrengthened.  This  output  will  increase  the  PCC\u2019s  capacity  in  core  functions  such  as \nenforcement, economics investigation, and advocacy. First, assistance will be provided to build \nan operational foundation, including: (i) an operations manual for enforcement, and mergers and \nacquisitions;  (ii)  policies  to  facilitate  the  prioritization  of  case-work;  (iii)  a  document/evidence \nmanagement  system;  (iv)  communication  strategies  and  outreach  programs;14  and  (v)  signing \n\nProject Description \n\n                                                \n11  ADB. 2018.

Second,  international  experts  will  provide  on-the-job  training  and  advisory \nservices in the following areas: (i) investigation; (ii) economic analysis in support of the detection \nand  investigation  of  anticompetitive  behavior;  (iii)  market  studies  in  priority  sectors  where \nis  expected;  and \nsubstantial \n(iv) communications  and  media  campaigns. This  combination  of  institution building  with on-the \njob training will accelerate the development of the PCC and quickly increase its relevance and \neffectiveness. \n \n16. \nOutput 2: Government staff development program for competition developed. This \noutput  will  provide  key  staff  of  other  relevant  government  agencies  with  competition-related \nmandates  (primarily  NEDA,  DOJ  and OSG),  as  well  as  staff  of  the  PCC,  with  opportunities to \nenhance  their  skills  and  knowledge.  First,  to  reinforce  the  on-the-job  training  provided  under \noutput 1, staff of the PCC will undertake secondments to gain a structured insight into the workings \nof well-established competition authorities. Second, staff of the PCC and other relevant agencies \nwill be able to pursue nondegree programs, short-term courses (domestic and international), and \ndistance  learning  courses  in  key  areas  of  competition  law  to  learn  current  international  best \npractices.  Third, \nfor  degree  programs  \ninclude \n(i.e., master\u2019s and Doctor of Philosophy) with the aim of providing educational opportunities  to \nbuild  the  technical  skills of  competition  practitioners  and develop  a critical  mass of  skilled  and \nreform-minded staff. Participation in the program will be limited primarily to the PCC, NEDA, DOJ \nand  OSG  to  prevent  dilution  and  to  more  effectively  utilize  the  limited  resources.15  Domestic \nacademic  programs  will  also  be  offered  to  provide  a  balance  in  exposure  and  minimize  the \ndisruption  of  long  staff  absences.  The  program  will  also  utilize  a  reentry  capstone  project  to \nminimize staff retention risk. \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  An  academic  center  of  excellence  in  competition  law  and  policy \nestablished. The academic community is an important channel for building up and maintaining a \nspecialized  competition knowledge base.  Such expertise helps build  a constituency  of  experts \nwho can support the system of competition law and make it work more effectively at all levels.16 \nThis  output  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  center  of  excellence  at  the  University  of  the \nPhilippines (UP) to nurture local expertise in competition law, policy, and economics. The center \nwill conduct outreach activities to promote better understanding of competition policy and build up \nknowledge  through  research  and  publications.  The  center  will  provide  incentives  (including \nfellowships  and  research  grants)  to  perform  world-class  research  and  attract  talented \nresearchers,  experts,  and  students.  The  center  will  enter  into  collaborative  arrangements  with \nother centers of excellence and universities as well as with the PCC.17 Specifically, the center will: \n(i)  provide  full  degree  programs  for  competition  law  and  economics  at  the  graduate  and/or \nundergraduate  level;  (ii)  award  research  grants  for  graduate  students  and  junior  faculty; \n(iii) organize  seminars,  talks,  and  forums  on  competition  law  and  policy  in  tertiary  institutions; \n(iv) develop  teaching  materials,  textbooks,  case  studies,  and  discussion  papers;  (v)  develop \ndistance  learning  short  and  long  duration  courses;  (vi)  organize  seminar  series  and  small \nconferences  for  academic  and  policy  research  community  to  share  research  findings;  and  \n(vii) publish discussion papers and policy briefs.  \n \n\n                                                \n15  Beneficiaries will include staff from the NEDA, the DOJ, and the OSG. \n16  ASEAN. 2017.

The  project  will  develop  the \nPCC\u2019s institutional foundations while supporting live interventions, which would mutually reinforce \neach other. Furthermore, the project will strengthen the capacity of partner government agencies. \nThis will create synergies by building teamwork and shared knowledge, creating a virtuous cycle \nthat further builds institutional capacity. Finally, an academic center of excellence on competition \nlaw and policy in the Philippines will be launched to meet the increased demand for competition \npolicy practitioners, research, and advocacy. \n \n19. \nLessons learned from previous capacity-building programs were reflected in the  project \ndesign, including that: (i) newly acquired skills should be fully aligned to the agency\u2019s corporate \ngoals;  (ii)  support  should  not  spread  across  a  large  number  of  agencies,  as  otherwise \norganizational impact is difficult to achieve; and (iii) advanced competition enforcement requires \nvery focused training.21 \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $29.3  million  (Table  3).

The executing \nagency  for  the  project  is  the  PCC,  which  will  oversee  overall  project  implementation  and \nmanagement  activities.  The  PCC,  through  the  project  management  unit  (PMU),  will  be \nresponsible for implementing outputs 1 and 2, whereas UP will be the implementing agency for \noutput 3. \n \n24. \nA project steering committee will be established and chaired by the PCC, with the NEDA \nas vice chair. Other members of the steering committee will include the Department of Finance, \nthe  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry,  and  the  UP.  The  project  steering  committee  will  meet \nregularly  (at  least  twice  a  year)  to:  (i)  review  project  implementation  progress;  (ii)  guide  and \nsupport  project  implementation;  and  (iii)  coordinate  between  agencies  involved  in  project \nimplementation.  The  PMU  will  be  established  within,  and  overseen  by,  the  PCC  and  will  be \nresponsible for the day-to-day coordination and oversight of the project. The PMU will comprise \nthe following personnel: a project manager, scholarship management specialist, monitoring and \nevaluation  specialist,  procurement  specialist,  financial  management  specialist,  administration \nassistant, and secretary. Tasks of the PMU will include managing procurement activities, carrying \nout  the  competitive  selection  process  for  candidates  proposed  for  scholarships,  scholar \nplacement,  scholarship  program  management,  and  project  monitoring  and  evaluation.

The PCC\u2019s legal and economic experts need to have the capacity to effectively and \nefficiently  conduct  investigations,  review  merger  transactions,  carry  out  economic  analysis, \ninstitute administrative proceedings before the PCC, and pursue cases against illegal practices \nsuch as cartelistic behavior and abuse of dominant market positions. Diverse skills are needed, \nincluding  detecting  cartels,  receiving  and  handling  complaints,  reviewing  mergers,  drafting \ncharging documents, presenting evidence in a hearing, and conducting research studies relevant \nto  promoting  competitive  markets.  Two  broad groups  require  capacity  building:  PCC\u2019s  internal \npersonnel,  and  staff  of  partner  agencies \nlaw  enforcement  and  policy \nimplementation. The objectives of the capacity building are to: (i) equip staff with the knowledge, \nskills, and ability to carry out their mandate effectively; (ii) enhance agencies\u2019 capacity to advance \ntheir positions on pro-competition policies in local and international contexts; (iii) build a strong, \nwell-informed, and educated PCC staff to carry out the functions of the PCC; and (iv) establish a \nsystem of continued skills upgrading of PCC  staff. \n \nB. \n \nThe anticipated economic benefits of the project include: (i) an increase in gross domestic \n26. \nproduct because of more efficient allocation and use of resources and a resulting one-off rise in \ntotal  factor  productivity;  and  (ii)  faster  economic  growth  because  of  greater  efficiency  of  the \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\nin  competition \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\neconomy, more innovation, and more rapid growth of total factor productivity. The investments \nare considered economically viable. The economic analysis resulted in an economic internal rate \nof return of 22.4% and a net present value of $13 million. The additional revenue the project will \ngenerate for the government will be more than sufficient to cover all recurrent costs of the project \nafter  implementation,  interest  payments  under  the  ADB  loan,  and  repayment  of the  ADB  loan. \nHence, the project is financially sustainable.23 \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe  project  will  build  the  capacity  of  the  participating  agencies  by  strengthening  their \nhuman resources in competition-related functional areas and enhancing their ability to initiate and \nmanage reforms. Sustaining the high level of expertise developed in the PCC will require creating \na  broader  educational  environment  that  ensures  an  increased  pool  of  technical  expertise.  To \ncomplete  the  ecosystem, the  center  of excellence  to  be  established at  the UP  will  deepen the \nbench  of  prospective  PCC  staff  and  its  advisory  network.  The  PCC  will  benefit  from  strategic \npartnerships with local and international academic institutions to cultivate research and instruction \nin competition law. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nA financial management assessment has been carried out to review the capacity of the \nPCC regarding its financial management system and procedures. The financial management risk \nis moderate (pre-mitigation) mainly because of: (i) weaknesses in budget execution; (ii) limited \nstaff  in  the  finance,  planning,  and  management  office;  (iii)  lack  of  internal  audit  service;  and  \n(iv) lack of computerized budgeting and bookkeeping systems. The government and ADB have \nagreed to a number of measures to control these risks.24 A PMU will be established to, among \nothers, address financial management issues. The PMU will be staffed by qualified professionals, \nincluding a project manager, finance specialist, and performance monitoring specialist to ensure \nthat  the  project  is  implemented  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  and  procedural \nrequirements.    ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the PCC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \nE. \n \n29. \nThe objective of introducing competition into the market is to prevent control of the market \nby  a  select  few  companies,  which  can  lead  to  collusion  and  price  distortion  against  consumer \nwelfare. The proposed project will promote free and fair competition to temper prices and increase \nservice quality  in non-competitive industries,  leading  to  improved  consumer  welfare  and  better \nsocio-economic opportunities especially for those in low-income groups. \n \n30. \nThe project is categorized as having some gender elements. The government will ensure \nthat women participation in all trainings programs under the project will be at least proportional to \nthe share of women employed at the relevant agencies. The government will further ensure that \nall monitoring and evaluation data will be disaggregated by sex. \n \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n23 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents from Appendix 2). \n24 Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents from Appendix 2). \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nF. \n \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),25  the project\u2019s safeguard \n31. \ncategories  are  as  follows:  Category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples. \n \nG. \n \n32. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26  \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  6  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nInternal audit: The PCC does \nnot have an internal audit \nsystem. \n\n18% of the FPMO\u2019s positions \nare vacant. \nLow retention of scholars after \ntraining \n\nInsufficient number of staff \nparticipating in the training \n\nThe PCC will create an internal audit system.
