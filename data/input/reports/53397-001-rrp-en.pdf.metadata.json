Ltd.  (CCH)  for  the  Asian \nSustainable  Infrastructure  Mobilization  Project. 1  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of an equity investment of up to $45,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s \nPrivate Infrastructure Fund (LEAP), and if the Board approves the proposed equity investment, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the equity \ninvestment. 2 \n \n2. \nCCH is raising equity capital from new and existing shareholders to be drawn from 2020 \nto  2024  to  scale  up  its  investments  in  sustainable  infrastructure  through  the  expansion  of  two \nexisting  group  companies\u2014Clifford  Capital  Pte.  Ltd.  (CCPL)  and  Pierfront  Capital  Fund \nManagement Pte. Ltd. (Pierfront)\u2014and the establishment of two new group companies\u2014Bayfront \nInfrastructure Management Pte. Ltd. (BIM) and a supply chain financing (SCF) entity.3 The equity \ninvestment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of up to $95 million will secure a board seat for \nADB at CCH. 4 CCH\u2019s other existing shareholders include Temasek, Standard Chartered Bank, \nDBS  Bank,  Sumitomo  Mitsui  Banking  Corporation  (SMBC),  Prudential  Assurance  Company \nSingapore (Pte) Limited, and John Hancock.5 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \nDeveloping Asia will require annual infrastructure investments of $1.7 trillion  to 2030 to \n3. \nsustain economic growth and effectively combat climate change.6 Presently, 70% of infrastructure \ninvestment in Asia is financed by the public sector, which is unsustainable if developing Asia's \ninfrastructure  financing  needs  are  to  be  met.7 Moreover,  as  governments  are  allocating  public \nfunds for emergency response and relief efforts related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, there will be a greater reliance on private sector funding to close the infrastructure gap \nin  developing  Asia.  In  the  private  sector  in  Asia,  infrastructure  financing  is  dominated  by \ncommercial banks, export credit agencies, infrastructure funds, pension funds, and development \nfinance  institutions  (DFIs).  However,  the  implementation  of  Basel  III,  with  its  stricter  capital \nadequacy requirements, will limit the lending capacity of commercial banks, thus increasing the \nchallenge of obtaining long-term financing for infrastructure projects. The rise of funds focused on \nproviding  debt  and  equity  for  infrastructure  assets,  as  well  as  increasing  financial  innovation \nthrough securitization, can help to address some of these financing needs. CCH, through its four \ncomplementary  group  companies  and  their  origination  and  distribution  platforms,  provides \ncommercial financing for infrastructure and real assets, which is expected to catalyze and attract \nlong-term institutional capital to this underserved market segment in Asia. \n \n\n \n\n1  \u201cSustainable infrastructure\u201d is defined as infrastructure that is designed, built, and operated to be durable, in ways \n\nthat are socially inclusive and economically viable, while protecting the environment. \n\n2  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n3  The  organizational  chart  is  in  Ownership,  Management,  and  Governance  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). Note that BIM is operational as of 2 April 2020. \n\n4  Out  of  the  proposed  equity  investment  of  up  to  $95  million,  $50  million  will  be  funded  by  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n\nresources and $45 million will be funded by LEAP. \n\n5   Existing  CCPL  shareholders  swapped  their  shareholdings  into  CCH  and  together  with  Temasek\u2019s  indirect  wholly \n\nowned subsidiary, Aranda Investments Pte. Ltd., executed a first close on 26 March 2020. \n\n6  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2017.

In 2015, \nADB entered into its first cofinancing with CCPL through the Myingyan Natural Gas Power Project \nin Myanmar.8 ADB provided a political risk guarantee and a B loan participation for commercial \nlenders (including CCPL) to mobilize long-term, private capital into Myanmar\u2019s first private sector \nindependent power producer (IPP). \n \n5. \nCCPL  was  established  with  support  from  the  Government  of  Singapore  to  provide \ncommercially-driven  project  finance  and  structured  finance  solutions  to  Singapore-based \ncompanies  that  invest  equity  in,  or  provide  services  or  equipment  to,  infrastructure,  offshore \nmarine,  and  shipping  assets  globally.9 Since  its  inception  in  2012,  CCPL  has  grown  its  loan \nportfolio  to  $1.9  billion  as  of  September  2019.  In  2016,  CCPL  supported  the  establishment  of \nPierfront  Capital,  a  private  credit  fund  manager,  which  provides  mezzanine  financing  for \ninfrastructure  and  real  assets.  In  2018,  CCPL,  through  Bayfront  Infrastructure  Capital, \nsuccessfully closed  a  $458  million  inaugural  securitization  of  project  and  infrastructure finance \nloans from Asia, drawing institutional capital from 16 investors globally. In March 2020, existing \nCCPL shareholders have swapped their shareholding in CCPL for new shares in CCH. CCH is \nraising  additional  capital  from  new,  strategic  investors  to  fund  its  future  growth  plans.  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment will support CCH\u2019s growth in sustainable infrastructure financing in developing Asia. \n \nB. \n \n6. \ngroup companies registered in Singapore: \n\nCCH  is  a  private  holding  company  established  in  Singapore.

The Government \nof Singapore, rated AAA by Standard and Poor\u2019s and Fitch, guarantees all CCPL\u2019s \ndebt of up to $3.5 billion, providing CCPL access to competitive long-term funding. \nBayfront  Infrastructure  Management  Pte.  Ltd.  BIM  will  invest  in  brownfield \ninfrastructure  assets,  acquiring  and  warehousing  primarily  dollar-denominated \ninfrastructure  loans  from  commercial  banks. 11  It  will  securitize  the  loans, \ntransferring its exposure to institutional investors (such as insurance companies \nand  pension  funds)  through  exchange-listed  securitized  note  issuances.12 BIM\u2019s \nwarehousing facility benefits from a Government of Singapore funding guarantee \nof up to $1.8 billion, which allows BIM to hold loans longer prior to securitization, \nand  through  periods  of  market  dislocation.

As one of the region\u2019s leading infrastructure financing platforms with \nholistic  origination  and  distribution  capabilities,  CCH  provides  innovative  financing  solutions \nacross  the  entire  capital  structure  (senior  debt,  mezzanine  financing,  loan  securitization,  and \nworking  capital  financing)  of  infrastructure  and  real  assets.  With  strong  backing  from  the \nGovernment  of  Singapore  and  strategic  investors  including  ADB,  CCH  is  well-positioned  to \nleverage  the  capital,  innovation,  knowledge,  and  partnerships  from  Singapore\u2019s  infrastructure \necosystem to address Asia\u2019s infrastructure gap, which has been further widened by the COVID-\n19 crisis, and  contribute to the post-COVID-19 rebuilding efforts. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nOwnership.

[CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n \n18. \nADB will monitor the project throughout its duration. CCH will provide ADB with financial \nreports at predetermined regular intervals, including (i) annual audited financial statements, (ii) \nquarterly  reports  to  its  board  and  shareholders,  (iii)  annual  reports  on  selected  development \neffectiveness (including gender) indicators, and (iv) annual reporting on environmental and social \nperformance. For significant environmental and social events relating to underlying assets, CCH \nundertakes to report to ADB promptly. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nSupport  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  as  a  strategic  shareholder.  ADB  will  be \nCCH\u2019s  first  multilateral  investor  and  will  provide  patient  capital  for  CCH\u2019s  growth.  As  a  Board \nmember, ADB will provide strategic inputs into CCH\u2019s business plan(s) to drive CCH\u2019s operations \ntowards more inclusive and sustainable infrastructure development in ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries  (DMCs).  ADB\u2019s  strong  network  of  clients,  government  relationships,  technical \nassistance  and  project  preparation  capabilities,  as  well  as  cofinancing  partners  will  help  CCH \nsubstantially  increase  its  share  of  sustainable  infrastructure  assets  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  through \nidentifying, structuring, financing, and implementing bankable projects. In addition, while ADB\u2019s \nequity  capital  will  directly  contribute towards  increasing  CCH\u2019s  ability  to leverage and  mobilize \nprivate  investments  in  frontier  markets  and  emerging  sectors,  it  will  also  indirectly  contribute, \nthrough the multiplier effect, towards job creation and ADB\u2019s climate targets in its DMCs. \n \n20. \nEnhance  mobilization  through  cofinancing  opportunities.  As  long-term  private \nfunding for infrastructure is becoming even more constrained during the COVID-19 crisis in Asia, \nADB\u2019s anchor investment is needed not only to build CCH\u2019s long-term capital base but also to \nboost investor confidence and mobilizations amid market dislocations. CCH will gain unparalleled \naccess  to  potential  cofinancing  and  co-investment  opportunities  with  ADB.  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] By cofinancing alongside ADB in emerging countries (Group A or B \ncountries) and sectors (such as renewable energy and environmental infrastructure), CCH can \ndevelop  newfound  market  or  sector  expertise  and  invest  on  its  own  or  mobilize  other  private \ninvestors  in  the  future. 14  Further,  through  ADB\u2019s  resident  missions,  including  the  newly \n\n14 ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nestablished Singapore office, ADB can offer a platform to CCH to propel sustainable infrastructure \ndevelopment in Asia through enhanced knowledge, cofinancing, and partnerships. \n \n21. \nStrengthen environmental and social safeguards and capacity building. Through its \ninvestment  in  CCH,  there  will  be  an  opportunity  for  ADB  to  (i)  introduce  improvements  to  the \nexisting environmental and social management systems (ESMS) adopted or to be implemented \nby  its  group  companies  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  and  expertise  of  CCH  and  its  group \ncompanies in managing its environmental and social risks in accordance with international best \npractices.15 \n \n22. \nImprove  gender  inclusivity  at  Clifford  Capital  Holdings  Pte.

According  to  the \nMcKinsey  Global  Institute,  women  are  often  over-represented  in  junior  positions  and  under-\nrepresented in leadership and management positions in the finance and insurance subsectors in \nSingapore.16 Through  ADB\u2019s  investment,  CCH  will  enhance  gender  inclusivity  through  greater \nrepresentation of women in management and decision-making roles at CCH. \n \nD. \n \n23. \n \n24. \n \n25. \n \n26. \n \n27. \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \nThe project is aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 8.10 as it will strengthen the \n28. \ncapacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance, \nand  financial  services  for  all. 17  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  private  sector \nfinancing for sustainable infrastructure projects in ADB\u2019s DMCs increased.18 \n \n29. \nThe project has the following outputs: (i) CCH\u2019s capital base is expanded; (ii) up to $95 \nmillion of ADB equity capital raised and sustainably invested in low-carbon infrastructure projects \nin ADB\u2019s DMCs, and partly in Group A or B countries; and (iii) gender inclusivity at CCH improved. \n \nB. \n \nIn  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  this  project  supports  ADB\u2019s  focus  on  mobilizing  and \n30. \ncatalyzing financial resources for development and expanding ADB\u2019s private sector operations to \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n\n15 Since ADB\u2019s engagement, CCH has retained an environmental and social advisor which has been endorsed by ADB. \n16 McKinsey Global Institute. 2018.

Through  a  collaborative  One  ADB  approach  involving \nADB\u2019s regional departments, Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, and Sustainable Development \nand  Climate  Change  Department,  ADB  aims  to  accelerate  and  increase  private  sector \ninvestments in many of its frontier markets and sectors. \n \n31. \nThis  regional  project  strongly  supports  operational  priority  7  (fostering  regional \ncooperation  and  integration),  as  it  expands  global  and  regional  investment  opportunities  in \ninfrastructure in Asia. The establishment of CCH is part of the Government of Singapore\u2019s regional \ninitiative to support Asia\u2019s social and economic growth through infrastructure development, with \nSingapore  as  the  regional  infrastructure  development  hub.  CCPL\u2019s  current  portfolio  comprises \nseveral cross-border infrastructure projects, exemplifying regional cooperation among financiers, \nborrowers, and sponsors located across multiple countries in Asia. This project aligns with other \nregional ADB initiatives such as the partnership between Infrastructure Asia and ADB to promote \ninnovative and green financing for sustainable infrastructure in Southeast Asia.21 Through CCH\u2019s \ncurrent  investments  in  ports,  shipping,  transport,  and  information  and  communications \ntechnology, this project also promotes higher-quality connectivity and integration within Asia. \n \n32. \nThe  project  supports  operational  priority  1  (addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequalities) as it aims to increase private investments in some of the poorest and most vulnerable \nADB DMCs. The lack of capital flows, especially private sector financing, into such countries slows \npoverty alleviation and economic growth. Through ADB\u2019s investment, CCH will commit to making \nat  least  two  additional  investments  in  Group  A  or  B  countries,  thereby  bringing  private  sector \nfinancing and opportunities to the most vulnerable countries and communities. \n \n33. \nThe project supports operational priority 3 (tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability)  as  CCH  aims  to  expand \ninvestments in renewables. In line with the Government of Singapore\u2019s strategy of becoming a \npioneer  in  green  financing,  Singapore's  central  bank  has  announced  a  $2  billion  green \ninvestments program to drive growth in sustainable finance, which CCH will be able to support.22 \nThe project will contribute to ADB\u2019s climate financing target of $80 billion cumulatively from 2019 \nto 2030; $30 million of ADB\u2019s own resources will finance climate mitigation investments. 23 \n \n34. \nThis project also promotes ADB\u2019s operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender \nequality) by enhancing women\u2019s participation and access to decision-making and leadership roles \nwithin CCH. CCH will commit to offering professional skills and leadership training to its female \nstaff and increasing the representation of women in management and decision-making roles. \n \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n19 ADB.  2018.

As the \nassociated emission reductions of these low carbon assets are not yet known, the conservative assumption is that \nthe project will not contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  investment  is  classified  category  A  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \n35. \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. 24  ADB  has  assessed  the  environmental  and  social  \nimpacts and risks associated with CCH and its group companies\u2019 existing and future portfolio, and \ntheir  commitment  and  capacity  for  environmental  and  social  management.
