THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $50,000,000 in Clifford Capital Holdings Pte. Ltd. (CCH) for the Asian \nSustainable  Infrastructure  Mobilization  Project. 1  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of an equity investment of up to $45,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s \nPrivate Infrastructure Fund (LEAP), and if the Board approves the proposed equity investment, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the equity \ninvestment. 2 \n \n2.  CCH is raising equity capital from new and existing shareholders to be drawn from 2020 \nto 2024 to scale up its investments in sustainable infrastructure through the expansion of two \nexisting  group  companies\u2014Clifford  Capital  Pte.  Ltd.  (CCPL)  and  Pierfront  Capital  Fund \nManagement Pte. Ltd. (Pierfront)\u2014and the establishment of two new group companies\u2014Bayfront \nInfrastructure Management Pte. Ltd. (BIM) and a supply chain financing (SCF) entity.3 The equity \ninvestment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of up to $95 million will secure a board seat for \nADB at CCH. 4 CCH\u2019s other existing shareholders include Temasek, Standard Chartered Bank, \nDBS Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), Prudential Assurance Company \nSingapore (Pte) Limited, and John Hancock.5 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Developing Asia will require annual infrastructure investments of $1.7 trillion to 2030 to \nsustain economic growth and effectively combat climate change.6 Presently, 70% of infrastructure \ninvestment in Asia is financed by the public sector, which is unsustainable if developing Asia's \ninfrastructure financing needs are to be met.7 Moreover, as governments are allocating public \nfunds for emergency response and relief efforts related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, there will be a greater reliance on private sector funding to close the infrastructure gap \nin  developing  Asia.  In  the  private  sector  in  Asia,  infrastructure  financing  is  dominated  by \ncommercial banks, export credit agencies, infrastructure funds, pension funds, and development \nfinance institutions (DFIs). However, the implementation of Basel III, with its stricter capital \nadequacy requirements, will limit the lending capacity of commercial banks, thus increasing the \nchallenge of obtaining long-term financing for infrastructure projects. The rise of funds focused on \nproviding debt and equity for infrastructure assets, as well as increasing financial innovation \nthrough securitization, can help to address some of these financing needs. CCH, through its four \ncomplementary  group  companies  and  their  origination  and  distribution  platforms,  provides \ncommercial financing for infrastructure and real assets, which is expected to catalyze and attract \nlong-term institutional capital to this underserved market segment in Asia. \n \n \n1  \u201cSustainable infrastructure\u201d is defined as infrastructure that is designed, built, and operated to be durable, in ways \nthat are socially inclusive and economically viable, while protecting the environment. \n2  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n3  The organizational chart is in Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). Note that BIM is operational as of 2 April 2020. \n4  Out of the proposed equity investment of up to $95 million, $50 million will be funded by ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources and $45 million will be funded by LEAP. \n5  Existing CCPL shareholders swapped their shareholdings into CCH and together with Temasek\u2019s indirect wholly \nowned subsidiary, Aranda Investments Pte. Ltd., executed a first close on 26 March 2020. \n6  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2017. Public Financing of Infrastructure in Asia: In Search of New Solutions. Manila. \n ", "2 \n4.  ADB has existing relationships with the senior management and board of directors of \nCCH\u2019s key subsidiary, CCPL, from prior engagements in Asia\u2019s infrastructure market. In 2015, \nADB entered into its first cofinancing with CCPL through the Myingyan Natural Gas Power Project \nin Myanmar.8 ADB provided a political risk guarantee and a B loan participation for commercial \nlenders (including CCPL) to mobilize long-term, private capital into Myanmar\u2019s first private sector \nindependent power producer (IPP). \n \n5.  CCPL  was  established  with  support  from  the  Government  of  Singapore  to  provide \ncommercially-driven  project  finance  and  structured  finance  solutions  to  Singapore-based \ncompanies that invest equity in, or provide services or equipment to, infrastructure, offshore \nmarine, and shipping assets globally.9 Since its inception in 2012, CCPL has grown its loan \nportfolio to $1.9 billion as of September 2019. In 2016, CCPL supported the establishment of \nPierfront  Capital,  a  private  credit  fund  manager,  which  provides  mezzanine  financing  for \ninfrastructure  and  real  assets.  In  2018,  CCPL,  through  Bayfront  Infrastructure  Capital, \nsuccessfully closed a $458 million inaugural securitization of project and infrastructure finance \nloans from Asia, drawing institutional capital from 16 investors globally. In March 2020, existing \nCCPL shareholders have swapped their shareholding in CCPL for new shares in CCH. CCH is \nraising additional capital from new, strategic investors to fund its future growth plans. ADB\u2019s \ninvestment will support CCH\u2019s growth in sustainable infrastructure financing in developing Asia. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n6.  CCH is a private holding company established in Singapore. CCH owns the following \ngroup companies registered in Singapore: \n(i)  Clifford Capital Pte. Ltd. CCPL is a lead arranger and provider of project and \nstructured finance to qualifying greenfield and brownfield infrastructure assets \nglobally.10 [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] Some of the portfolio \nhighlights include the Greenko bond issuance (India) in 2016 and 2017, Myingyan \nIPP (Myanmar) in 2017, and Sirajganj IPP (Bangladesh) in 2016. The Government \nof Singapore, rated AAA by Standard and Poor\u2019s and Fitch, guarantees all CCPL\u2019s \ndebt of up to $3.5 billion, providing CCPL access to competitive long-term funding. \n(ii)  Bayfront Infrastructure Management Pte. Ltd. BIM will invest in brownfield \ninfrastructure assets, acquiring and warehousing primarily dollar-denominated \ninfrastructure  loans  from  commercial  banks. 11  It  will  securitize  the  loans, \ntransferring its exposure to institutional investors (such as insurance companies \nand pension funds) through exchange-listed securitized note issuances.12 BIM\u2019s \nwarehousing facility benefits from a Government of Singapore funding guarantee \nof up to $1.8 billion, which allows BIM to hold loans longer prior to securitization, \nand  through  periods  of  market  dislocation.  [CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED]  \n(iii)  Pierfront Capital Fund Management Pte. Ltd. Pierfront\u2019s Fund I was launched \nin 2016 with $220 million from two existing CCPL shareholders, Temasek and \nSMBC.  Pierfront  leveraged  CCPL\u2019s  existing  sector  knowledge,  network,  and \n \n8  ADB. 2015.

Qualifying projects are those where qualifying companies \nhave a greater than 30% equity stake, are service contractors, or export equipment to be used in a project. \n11 The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has 30% ownership in BIM. \n12 Notes will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. \n ", "3 \nservice-level agreements to raise a dedicated private credit fund for junior debt, \nmezzanine, and structured equity financing of real assets in Asia. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] CCH was in the process of acquiring 50% of Pierfront \n(Fund I manager) from Temasek and SMBC, alongside Keppel Capital which has \nacquired the other 50%. Pierfront has successfully raised $200 million from CCH \nand Keppel Capital in a first close for Fund II in March 2020. \n(iv)  Supply chain financing. CCH is considering to establish a financial technology \nenabled SCF platform to address financing needs of small and medium-sized \nenterprises in Asia. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n7.  Innovative features. As one of the region\u2019s leading infrastructure financing platforms with \nholistic origination and distribution capabilities, CCH provides innovative financing solutions \nacross the entire capital structure (senior debt, mezzanine financing, loan securitization, and \nworking  capital  financing)  of  infrastructure  and  real  assets.  With  strong  backing  from  the \nGovernment of Singapore and strategic investors including ADB, CCH is well-positioned to \nleverage the capital, innovation, knowledge, and partnerships from Singapore\u2019s infrastructure \necosystem to address Asia\u2019s infrastructure gap, which has been further widened by the COVID-\n19 crisis, and  contribute to the post-COVID-19 rebuilding efforts. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n8.  Ownership. Temasek will be CCH\u2019s anchor investor. Temasek has a net portfolio value \nof S$306 billion (as at 31 March 2020) and overall corporate credit ratings of Aaa/AAA by Moody\u2019s \nInvestors Service and S&P Global Ratings respectively. The existing CCPL shareholders, DBS \nBank,  John  Hancock,  Prudential  Assurance  Company  Singapore  (Pte)  Limited,  Standard \nChartered Bank, and SMBC, together with Temasek, have consolidated their shareholding into \nCCH as of March 2020. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n9.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence.13 CCH\u2019s founder shareholders, managers, and \nsignificant contracting entities do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant \nintegrity  risk,  as  there  is  no  unresolved  or  substantiated  adverse  media  or  other  relevant \ninformation related to them. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \n10.  Management. CCH will have management oversight over all group companies, with \ncentralized support functions. In addition to their core origination and front office functions, each \noperating company will have its own risk management team, which will report on a matrix basis \nto the respective operating company head(s) and the group chief risk officer (who will also be \nsupported by a group risk team). Each operating company will have its own board of directors \nand credit committee. All other committees (group risk committee; governance, nomination, and \ncompensation committee; and audit and finance committee) will be centralized at the CCH level. \n \n11.

[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n16.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s assistance will have two components: (i) an equity investment in CCH of up to $50 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and (ii) a parallel equity investment in CCH of up \nto  $45  million  from  LEAP,  to  be  administered  by  ADB  (footnote  2).    [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will monitor the project throughout its duration. CCH will provide ADB with financial \nreports at predetermined regular intervals, including (i) annual audited financial statements, (ii) \nquarterly reports to its board and shareholders, (iii) annual reports on selected development \neffectiveness (including gender) indicators, and (iv) annual reporting on environmental and social \nperformance. For significant environmental and social events relating to underlying assets, CCH \nundertakes to report to ADB promptly. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n19.  Support sustainable and inclusive growth as a strategic shareholder. ADB will be \nCCH\u2019s first multilateral investor and will provide patient capital for CCH\u2019s growth. As a Board \nmember, ADB will provide strategic inputs into CCH\u2019s business plan(s) to drive CCH\u2019s operations \ntowards more inclusive and sustainable infrastructure development in ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries  (DMCs).  ADB\u2019s  strong  network  of  clients,  government  relationships,  technical \nassistance and project preparation capabilities, as well as cofinancing partners will help CCH \nsubstantially increase its share of sustainable infrastructure assets in ADB\u2019s DMCs through \nidentifying, structuring, financing, and implementing bankable projects. In addition, while ADB\u2019s \nequity capital will directly contribute towards increasing CCH\u2019s ability to leverage and mobilize \nprivate investments in frontier markets and emerging sectors, it will also indirectly contribute, \nthrough the multiplier effect, towards job creation and ADB\u2019s climate targets in its DMCs. \n \n20.  Enhance  mobilization  through  cofinancing  opportunities.  As  long-term  private \nfunding for infrastructure is becoming even more constrained during the COVID-19 crisis in Asia, \nADB\u2019s anchor investment is needed not only to build CCH\u2019s long-term capital base but also to \nboost investor confidence and mobilizations amid market dislocations. CCH will gain unparalleled \naccess to potential cofinancing and co-investment opportunities with ADB. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] By cofinancing alongside ADB in emerging countries (Group A or B \ncountries) and sectors (such as renewable energy and environmental infrastructure), CCH can \ndevelop newfound market or sector expertise and invest on its own or mobilize other private \ninvestors  in  the  future.14 Further,  through  ADB\u2019s  resident  missions,  including  the  newly \n \n14 ADB. 2019. Operations Manual: Classification and Graduation of Developing Member Countries. OM A1. Manila. \n ", "5 \nestablished Singapore office, ADB can offer a platform to CCH to propel sustainable infrastructure \ndevelopment in Asia through enhanced knowledge, cofinancing, and partnerships. \n \n21.  Strengthen environmental and social safeguards and capacity building. Through its \ninvestment in CCH, there will be an opportunity for ADB to (i) introduce improvements to the \nexisting environmental and social management systems (ESMS) adopted or to be implemented \nby its group companies and (ii) strengthen the capacity and expertise of CCH and its group \ncompanies in managing its environmental and social risks in accordance with international best \npractices.15 \n \n22.  Improve gender inclusivity at Clifford Capital Holdings Pte. Ltd. According to the \nMcKinsey Global Institute, women are often over-represented in junior positions and under-\nrepresented in leadership and management positions in the finance and insurance subsectors in \nSingapore.16 Through ADB\u2019s investment, CCH will enhance gender inclusivity through greater \nrepresentation of women in management and decision-making roles at CCH. \n \nD.

[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n28.  The project is aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 8.10 as it will strengthen the \ncapacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance, \nand financial services for all.17 The project will have the following  outcome: private sector \nfinancing for sustainable infrastructure projects in ADB\u2019s DMCs increased.18 \n \n29.  The project has the following outputs: (i) CCH\u2019s capital base is expanded; (ii) up to $95 \nmillion of ADB equity capital raised and sustainably invested in low-carbon infrastructure projects \nin ADB\u2019s DMCs, and partly in Group A or B countries; and (iii) gender inclusivity at CCH improved. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n30.  In line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, this project supports ADB\u2019s focus on mobilizing and \ncatalyzing financial resources for development and expanding ADB\u2019s private sector operations to \n \n15 Since ADB\u2019s engagement, CCH has retained an environmental and social advisor which has been endorsed by ADB. \n16 McKinsey Global Institute. 2018.

Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \nNew York. \n18 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "6 \nsupport  ADB\u2019s  seven  operational  priorities. 19 In  line  with  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment\u2019s 2019 operational plan, the project also supports increased parallel cofinancing and \nco-investment  opportunities  in  ADB\u2019s  priority  sectors  including  environmental  infrastructure, \ntransport,  and  information  and  communication  technology.20 This  is  also  aligned  with  the \nrespective country partnership strategies, as many of ADB\u2019s DMCs emphasize the need for \nprivate sector investment and growth. Through a collaborative One ADB approach involving \nADB\u2019s regional departments, Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, and Sustainable Development \nand  Climate  Change  Department,  ADB  aims  to  accelerate  and  increase  private  sector \ninvestments in many of its frontier markets and sectors. \n \n31.  This  regional  project  strongly  supports  operational  priority  7  (fostering  regional \ncooperation and integration), as it expands global and regional investment opportunities in \ninfrastructure in Asia. The establishment of CCH is part of the Government of Singapore\u2019s regional \ninitiative to support Asia\u2019s social and economic growth through infrastructure development, with \nSingapore as the regional infrastructure development hub. CCPL\u2019s current portfolio comprises \nseveral cross-border infrastructure projects, exemplifying regional cooperation among financiers, \nborrowers, and sponsors located across multiple countries in Asia. This project aligns with other \nregional ADB initiatives such as the partnership between Infrastructure Asia and ADB to promote \ninnovative and green financing for sustainable infrastructure in Southeast Asia.21 Through CCH\u2019s \ncurrent  investments  in  ports,  shipping,  transport,  and  information  and  communications \ntechnology, this project also promotes higher-quality connectivity and integration within Asia. \n \n32.  The project supports operational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities) as it aims to increase private investments in some of the poorest and most vulnerable \nADB DMCs. The lack of capital flows, especially private sector financing, into such countries slows \npoverty alleviation and economic growth. Through ADB\u2019s investment, CCH will commit to making \nat least two additional investments in Group A or B countries, thereby bringing private sector \nfinancing and opportunities to the most vulnerable countries and communities. \n \n33.  The project supports operational priority 3 (tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability)  as  CCH  aims  to  expand \ninvestments in renewables. In line with the Government of Singapore\u2019s strategy of becoming a \npioneer  in  green  financing,  Singapore's  central  bank  has  announced  a  $2  billion  green \ninvestments program to drive growth in sustainable finance, which CCH will be able to support.22 \nThe project will contribute to ADB\u2019s climate financing target of $80 billion cumulatively from 2019 \nto 2030; $30 million of ADB\u2019s own resources will finance climate mitigation investments. 23 \n \n34.  This project also promotes ADB\u2019s operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender \nequality) by enhancing women\u2019s participation and access to decision-making and leadership roles \nwithin CCH. CCH will commit to offering professional skills and leadership training to its female \nstaff and increasing the representation of women in management and decision-making roles. \n \n \n19 ADB. 2018.

As the \nassociated emission reductions of these low carbon assets are not yet known, the conservative assumption is that \nthe project will not contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. \n ", "7 \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n35.  The investment is classified category A for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.24 ADB  has  assessed  the  environmental  and  social  \nimpacts and risks associated with CCH and its group companies\u2019 existing and future portfolio, and \ntheir commitment and capacity for environmental and social management. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] The enhanced ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for \ncompliance with national labor laws and measures to comply with the internationally recognized \ncore labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001). The enhanced ESMS \nwill also contain requirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and consultation with \naffected people in accordance with ADB requirements. ADB will require annual reports from CCH \nthat include (i) the nature of operating company investment activities and categorization, (ii) \ncompliance with safeguard and social requirements, (iii) compliance with applicable national and \ninternational laws and standards, and (iv) evidence that ADB\u2019s proceeds were used to fund ADB \neligible investments. \n \n36.  Some gender elements. The project is categorized as having some gender elements. \nCCH commits to implement measures to promote gender equality in its business activities \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). CCH will ensure adequate female \nrepresentation  in  management  and  decision-making  roles  at  CCH.  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n37.  CCH was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
