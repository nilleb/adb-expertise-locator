I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  for  Papua  New  Guinea  for  the  Town  Electrification \nInvestment Program. \n \n2.  The proposed investment program will improve power supply in provincial urban centers \nthrough replacement of high-cost diesel power generation with sustainable renewable energy \npower generation. The investment program will include (i) construction of about six run-of-river \nhydropower plants1 to supply provincial centers, (ii) construction of transmission systems to \nconnect provincial centers, and (iii) capacity building within the power utility and communities. \nProject preparatory technical assistance (TA) was used in project preparation.2 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  In Papua New Guinea (PNG), grid-connected power is largely restricted to the main \nurban areas. Less than 10% of the population has access to electricity.3 In provincial urban \ncenters not connected to the main power grids, a relatively low percentage of urban residents \nare connected,4 and distributed power is rarely available outside the provincial urban centers. \nThe supply of power to business and industry in the provincial urban centers is unreliable, with \nregular power outages5 and demand that at times exceeds generation capacity. As a result, \nmany large businesses in the provinces self-generate using diesel generators, at high cost. \nLack of access to affordable, reliable power is limiting economic growth in provincial centers.  \n \n4.   PNG has a total of 580 megawatts (MW) installed generation capacity. PNG Power \nLimited (PPL), the national state-owned corporatized power utility, manages generation of about \n300 MW, including the two main grids (Port Moresby and Ramu grids) and 19 geographically \nisolated independent power grids servicing provincial centers. The remaining 280 MW consists \nof  power  that  is  self-generated  by  industrial  facilities,  including  mines,  and  private  sector \ngenerators. The majority of provincial centers are supplied entirely through diesel generation, \nresulting in high generation costs.6 The poor development of provincial power is due to (i) \ndifficult geographical conditions; (ii) maintenance issues; (iii) high initial investment costs for \nhydropower resulting in reliance on diesel generation, which has low upfront costs but higher life \ncycle costs; and (v) the single national tariff structure, which serves an investment disincentive. \nThe current regulatory framework provides power tariffs that allow full cost recovery by PPL; \nhowever, in the absence of adequately funded community service obligations (CSOs),  the \nnational uniform power tariff creates a disincentive for investment in high-cost regional centers. \nThe ongoing policy reform proposes to address this through (i) a CSO policy,7 (ii) an electricity \ntrust fund under the draft electricity industry policy (EIP), and (iii) split tariffs to reflect higher \n                                                \n1  While hydropower is generally the least-cost renewable energy alternative, other sources may be considered. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2008. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Power \nSector Development Project. Manila (TA 7113-PNG, approved on 8 August). \n3  Provinces not connected to the main power grids have an average access rate of 2.9%. \n4  In the provincial centers assessed under the TA for Preparing the Power Sector Development Project, the urban \nelectrification rate was 24% to 57%.  \n5  For example, PPL estimates that load shedding in West New Britain is currently around 50%.  \n6  Power generation costs in some provincial centers exceed $0.8 per kilowatt-hour. \n7 ADB is assisting the establishment of the CSO policy through ADB. 2009.

The projects selected for the investment program are financially viable under \nthe  current  national  tariff  system.  PNG  has  significant  underutilized  indigenous  renewable \nenergy sources, particularly hydropower. The investment program will support development of \nrenewable energy sources, including hydropower plants, in about six target provincial centers to \n(i) improve reliability and quality of power supply in order to stimulate economic growth; and (ii) \nreplace diesel generation, thereby reducing power generation costs and creating incentives to \nimprove access rates.  \n \n5.  The investment program supports the Government of PNG\u2019s strategic priorities in the \nenergy sector. Activities in the PNG power sector are currently governed by the Electricity \nIndustry Act 2002. The government has recently prepared the draft EIP,8 which is expected to \nbe approved in 2010. It proposes various policy measures, including (i) facilitating competition \nand contestability in the electricity industry, including the private sector; (ii) up-scaling rural \nelectrification  through  CSOs;  and  (iii)  enhanced  technical  regulation.  The  proposed \ndevelopment  of  the  power  sector  in  each  province  is  detailed  in  the  PPL  10-year  power \ndevelopment plan (PDP).9 The PDP lists the status of current infrastructure and proposed \ninvestments over a 10-year time frame. The PDP provides a road map of priority hydropower \ndevelopments in the provinces to reduce reliance on diesel generation and improve service \ndelivery. The investment program will support implementation of the PDP.   \n \n6.   The government has recognized a number of key policy constraints in the power sector \nand is currently undertaking a number of reforms that will be supported by the investment \nprogram.10 The investment program also supports (i) the PNG country strategy and program \n2011\u20132015 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),11 which prioritizes energy as a key area of \nsupport; (ii) the national program of priority hydropower developments listed in the PDP; and (iii) \nthe Papua New Guinea Development Strategic Plan 2010\u2013203012 priority of replacing diesel \ngeneration with hydropower. \n \n7.   PNG\u2019s development partners have been consulted extensively during development of \nthe investment program. The development partners have recently focused on policy support in \nthe energy sector and development of small off-grid power supply projects with direct poverty \nalleviation benefits. The Pacific Islands Applied Geosciences Commission provided support for \na number of energy sector issues in PNG, including consultation regarding the draft national \nenergy policy and draft rural electrification policy through the Pacific Islands Energy Policy and \nStrategic Action Planning. The World Bank, with support from the Global Environment Fund, \nhas been supplying rural teachers in the Western Province with solar lighting kits. It has also \nlaunched  a  regional  Sustainable  Energy  Financing  Project,  designed  to  provide  financing \nsupport to the energy sector in a number of Pacific countries, including PNG.  \n \n8.   The  implementation  capacity  of  key  institutions  has  been  assessed  and  capacity \nstrengthening  activities  developed,  focusing  on  (i)  financial  management  of  PPL,  (ii) \nprocurement capacity for PPL, (iii) development of public\u2013private partnership (PPP) options for \nconsideration under tranche 2, and (iv) capacity of communities to manage improved power \n                                                \n8  A draft rural electrification policy has also been prepared, but has yet to receive broad endorsement.   \n9  Government of PNG. 2009.

The MFF was selected as the preferred financing modality as the MFF (i) provides long \nterm support to the implementation of the PNG Power 10 Year Development Plan, (ii) reduces \ncommitment charges, (iii) reduces transaction costs compared to individual project financing, \n(iv)  enables  staged  construction  to  match  human  resource  availability  within  implementing \nagency, and (v) establishes a platform for ongoing dialogue and support regarding sector reform.  \nThe government and ADB have entered into a framework financing agreement (FFA), which \nsets  out  the  roadmap,  strategic  context,  policy  framework,  investment  program,  and  the \nfinancing plan. The FFA also records the assurances and conditions in crosscutting themes \ncovering  safeguards,  governance,  anticorruption,  financial  management,  procurement,  and \nproject selection.  Financing will be extended under the MFF subject to the (i) submission of \nperiodic financing requests (PFRs) by the government; (ii) compliance with the project selection \ncriteria; (iii) execution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche; and (iv) \nfulfillment  of  terms,  conditions,  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  FFA.  Each  PFR  will  be \naccompanied by a list of projects identified for financing under the MFF.13 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the investment program will be improved economic conditions in target \nprovincial centers not connected to the main grids. The outcome of the investment program will \nbe improved utilization of reliable, clean power by PPL to about six provincial urban centers.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  The outputs of the investment program will be (i) about six renewable energy projects, \nincluding hydropower plants, put into operation by PPL; (ii) transmission systems constructed \nand operated by PPL; (iii) capacity building undertaken for the implementing agency and project \nbeneficiaries;  and  (iv)  efficient  project  management  services  rendered  by  the  project \nmanagement unit. Tranche 1 projects will support isolated provincial center grids, including:   \n \n(i)  Divune Hydropower Plant, consisting of a 3 MW run-of-river hydropower plant, \nlocated in Northern Province. The project will include (i) 3-meter-high concrete \ngravity diversion weir; (ii) 2.6 kilometers (km) of buried low-pressure pipeline; (iii) \na powerhouse; (iv) an 85 km, 22 kilovolt (kV) transmission line; and (v) upgrading \nand construction of the 6.1 km access road.    \n(ii)  Lake  Hargy  Interconnection,  consisting  of  an  approximately  150  km,  66  kV \ntransmission  line  connecting  Bialla  to  Kimbe,  West  New  Britain,  accessing \napproximately  1  MW  of  spare  generation  capacity  from  the  Lake  Hargy \nHydropower Plant, and connecting about 3 MW of biomass power (methane \nrecovery) from palm oil plantations along the alignment.  \n(iii)  Ramazon Hydropower Plant, consisting of a 3 MW run-of-river hydropower plant, \nlocated  in  Autonomous  Region  of  Bougainville.  The  project  will  include \nconstruction of (i) a concrete weir; (ii) a 5 km buried pipeline; (iii) penstock; (iv) \npowerhouse; (v) a 50 km, 33 kV transmission line; and (vi) a 5.3 km access road.  \n \n11.  The  investment  program  will  improve  access  to  energy  in  urban  areas  through  (i) \nimproved  quality  and  reliability  of  power  to  urban  residential,  commercial  and  industrial \ncustomers; and (ii) increased generation of power to allow PPL to increase connections to urban \nresidential, commercial and industrial customers. The low rate of residential access to electricity \n                                                \n13 Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "4     \noutside provincial centers is a significant social issue (non-urban households rarely have access \nto  electricity).  The  investment  program  will  establish  key  transmission  links  along  main \npopulation corridors, which will facilitate increased connectivity of the population outside the \nmain provincial centers.14 This will address a key investment hurdle for provincial governments, \nwho are responsible for rural electrification. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.  The total cost of the investments under the PDP between FY2011  and FY2016 is \nestimated at $550 million equivalent. The investment program, which will support the section of \nthe PDP targeting supply of power to provincial centers not connected to the main grids, is \nestimated to cost $150 million equivalent and will be implemented over 6 years. Tranche 1 will \ncost about $71.6 million equivalent, including taxes, duties, physical and price contingencies, \ninterest, and other charges.

Interest during construction for ADB loan(s) has been \ncomputed for the ordinary capital resources loan component at the 5-year forward London interbank \noffered rate plus a spread of 0.3% and for the Asian Development Fund loan component at 1% per \nannum. Table 1 is based on current estimates and financing terms may vary for subsequent \ntranches. Commitment charges for an Asian Development Bank loan are 0.15% per year to be \ncharged on the undisbursed ordinary capital resources loan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                \n14 Extension of the distribution grid will be financed separately through government-financed CSOs, partially funded \nthrough the electricity trust fund. A grant-financed project is proposed to assist energy access (see section III).    ", "    5  \n13.  The government has requested an MFF for an amount up to $120 million equivalent \nfrom ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR) and Special Funds resources to help finance a \npart of the investment program. The government will be contributing $30 million to the MFF, \nincluding  all  local  taxes  and  duties.  The  MFF  will  consist  of  two  tranches,  subject  to  the \ngovernment's submission of related PFRs, execution of the related loan and project agreements \nfor each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the FFA.  \n \n14.  The first tranche of the MFF will comprise a blend of (i) a loan from OCR of $40.9 million \n(OCR loan), and (ii) a loan from Special Funds resources of SDR10,565,000 equivalent ($16.4 \nmillion) (Asian Development Fund [ADF] loan), which will finance 80% of the total cost of \ntranche 1. ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the government to PPL under a \nsubsidiary loan agreement15. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility based on \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The government \nwill provide counterpart funding of $14.3 million equivalent, including all local taxes and duties \n($5.9 million). The financing plan for the investment program is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nInvestment Program     \nAsian Development Bank (ADF and OCR)  120.00  80.00 \nGovernment of Papua New Guinea  30.00  20.00 \nTotal  150.00  100.00 \nTranche 1     \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)  16.40  23.00 \nAsian Development Bank (OCR)  40.90  57.00 \nGovernment of Papua New Guinea  14.30  20.00 \nTotal  71.60  100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  The financing terms for each tranche will be specified in the PFR for each tranche.16 \nInterest and other charges during construction for all tranches are to be capitalized for the ADF \nand  OCR  loans  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project \nagreements.  Tranche  2  is  intended  to  be  implemented  by  1  January  2013,  with  physical \ncompletion by 31 December 2016.17 \n \n16.  The government has requested that ADB consider providing additional resources from \nits ADF resources for subsequent tranches. It is understood that the provision of any such \nadditional ADF financing will be accompanied by a corresponding reduction of the available \nOCR financing, so that the total financing provided by ADB will not exceed the MFF amount of \n$120  million  equivalent.  Any  additional  ADF  allocation  will  be  subject  to  (i)  the  general \navailability  of  ADF  resources  from  time  to  time,  (ii)  Papua  New  Guinea's  access  to  such \n                                                \n15 ADB loan proceeds (ADF and OCR) will be relent by the government to PPL on the same terms and conditions as \nthe loan agreements between ADB and the government, primarily due to the significant social benefit of the \ninvestments.   \n16 Transportation and insurance are eligible for financing under the loans.  \n17 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6     \nresources pursuant to ADB\u2019s then-applicable Graduation Policy18 and the requirements of the \nADF donors, and (iii) the availability of such resources to Papua New Guinea pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nthen-applicable policy on performance-based allocation of ADF resources.19 \n \n17.  ADB  will  explore  and  pursue  viable  cofinancing  opportunities  (e.g., from the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency and European Investment Bank) during the implementation of \nthe investment program and the preparation of subsequent tranches. ADB\u2019s analysis of the \nsustainability of PNG\u2019s external debt shows that PNG will remain at moderate risk of external \ndebt  distress  over  the  medium  term  after  the  investment  program.  External  debt  burden \nindicators will be well below their indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario, but some \nvulnerability to further terms-of-trade shocks and slower economic growth will continue.  \n \n18.  Two of the projects under tranche 1 are considered to be eligible for carbon financing \nunder  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM).20 PPL  is  proposing  to  pursue  a  CDM \nprogram of activities to develop small hydropower plants in PNG. The ADB technical support \nfacility is providing assistance to PPL and the Future Carbon Fund has initiated discussions to \npurchase carbon emission reduction credits.   \n \nE.

GRANT ASSISTANCE \n \n20.  A  proposed  grant  project\u2014Improved  Energy  Access  for  Poor  Communities\u2014for  $2 \nmillion is being prepared22 to assist with improving access to energy for low income rural \ncommunities. Discussions are ongoing for cofinancing of the proposed grant assistance. The \ngrant project will be submitted separately for Board approval, and may include the following: \n \n(i)  Component  A:  Trialing  of  power  grid  extension  to  low-income  rural \ncommunities. Component A will (a) consist of bundling of power distribution \nprojects to demonstrate the impact of targeted CSOs financing on access rates; \nand (b) target approximately 1,500 poor households in the Northern Province. \n(ii)  Component B: Trialing of community-based civil works contracts. A major \nbarrier is the high cost of civil works to construct distribution systems, which is \nrelated to difficulties in attracting civil works contractors. The proposed grant will \ntrial community-based civil works contracts for distribution systems.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The proposed projects have been assessed to be technically viable. For the hydropower \ndesign, all available stream flow data was collated to assess water resource availability. Where \nflow  data  was  limited,  correlated  projections  were  made.  Alternative  designs  have  been \nassessed, e.g., glass-reinforced plastic penstocks have been recommended to (i) reduce initial \ncosts, (ii) reduce maintenance, and (iii) reduce transport costs. Standard equipment of known \ndesign has been selected to (i) increase availability of parts, and (ii) standardize equipment.    \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic aspects. A least-cost analysis of alternative generation options has indicated \nthat tranche 1 projects represent the least-cost means of meeting forecasted growth in demand. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for each project exceeds the EIRR threshold of 12% \n(Divune  Hydropower  Plant  18.6%,  Lake  Hargy  Interconnection  18.1%,  and  Ramazon \nHydropower Plant 16.4%), and the projects are therefore economically viable. Analysis was \nundertaken to test the sensitivity of the EIRR to adverse changes in five major risk areas, (i) an \nincrease of 10% in capital cost; (ii) an increase of 10% in operation and maintenance costs; (iii) \na 10% decrease in benefits; (iv) a combination of (i), (ii), and (iii); and (v) a 2-year delay in \nproject  implementation.  The  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  remains  robust  under  all \n                                                \n22 The grant design mission (5\u201316 April 2010) agreed on the proposed scope of works with the government.  \n ", "8     \nscenarios, with the exception that EIRR for the Lake Hargy interconnection and Ramazon \nHydropower projects drops just below 12% under the \u201call of the above\u201d scenario.   \n \n23.  Financial aspects. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and financial net present \nvalue were computed at the May 2010 price level. The overall FIRR of tranche 1 projects is \n9.6%, which exceeded the weighted average cost of capital of 2.4%. Tranche 1 is considered \nfinancially feasible. The financial viability of tranche 1 projects was subjected to sensitivity \nanalysis. Sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR is robust under various adverse conditions, \nincluding a (i) 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) 10% reduction in benefits, (iii) 2-year delay in \nproject implementation, and (iv) case 1 and case 2 combined. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was completed for PPL,23 \nincluding a review of the accounting and reporting system, internal and external auditing, fund \ndisbursement, and information system. Control risk for PPL was rated as moderate, and was \ndeemed to be lower than inherent risk due to the corporatized nature of PPL and its significant \nfinancial management capacity. PPL\u2019s current financial management system was considered \nadequate, however, PPL does not have recent experience with international donor-funded loan \nprojects. Specific training needs have been identified and incorporated into tranche 1 design.   \n \n25.  Procurement capacity. A procurement capacity assessment (PCA) was completed for \nPPL. The PCA is included in the FAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). The PCA indicated that PPL has significant procurement experience, including preparation of \nbidding documents and evaluation of technical proposals and monitoring contract performance. \nPPL has recent experience with procurement for large projects; however, it does not have \nrecent  experience  with  multilateral  development  bank  procurement  procedures.  Targeted \nprocurement training of PPL will be undertaken. \n \n26.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the Department of Petroleum and Energy and PPL. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. 24  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  Potential  poverty  and  social  benefits  and  impacts  on  local  communities  have  been \nanalyzed. The investment program incorporates several strategies to enable communities to \nrealize benefits and reduce poverty, including (i) improved access to power, both in towns and \nvillages  near  hydropower  sites; (ii)  water  supply  connections  to  adjacent  communities; (iii) \nemployment during construction; (iv) skills training; and (v) inclusion in civil work contracts of \nminimum  labor  standards.  The  investment  program  is  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. A gender action plan has been prepared, and includes (i) provision of HIV/AIDS \nawareness for men and women, (ii) equal pay for equal work by male and female workers, (iii) \nfemale  participation  in  the  labor  force,  (iv)  female  participation  (30%)  in  community \nconsultations, (v) skills training for village committees and households (minimum 50% female \nparticipation), (vi) the establishment of village power and water committees with at least 50% \nfemale participation, and  (vii) capacity building of PPL.   \n                                                \n23 In accordance with ADB. 2005.

An environmental assessment review framework presents the general \nanticipated  environmental  impacts  of  the  investment,  selection  criteria,  and  environmental \nprocedures for subsequent projects. Initial environmental examinations have been prepared for \neach of the three tranche 1 projects. The main potential impacts identified include (i) waterway \nsedimentation, (ii) impacts on fauna during construction, and (iii) reduced streamflow. Adequate \nmitigation measures have been incorporated. A climate change adaptation risk evaluation was \nconducted and considered in infrastructure design.  \n \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement.  A  resettlement  framework  for  the  program  provides \nguidelines for preparation of resettlement plans for subsequent projects. Tranche 1 does not \ninvolve physical displacement of people and structures, although it will acquire land for two \nhydropower sites. All land acquisition will be financed by the government. Displaced persons will \nlose part of their land, crops, and trees. A resettlement plan has been prepared for Divune \nHydropower  Plant,  which  involves  acquisition  of  customary  land.25 The  resettlement  plan \nincludes measures to compensate for affected land and assets and to assist displaced persons \nto restore and improve their livelihoods.  \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples. An indigenous peoples planning framework provides guidelines to \nprepare  indigenous  peoples  plans for subsequent tranches.  Customary  landowners  at  one \ntranche 1 site will lose part of their customary land, but are not expected to experience other \nadverse  impacts.  The  landowners  are  expected  to  benefit  from  power  connection  and \nemployment opportunities. An indigenous peoples plan has been prepared for tranche 1 project.  \n \n31.  Tranche 1 has been classified as category B for environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand  indigenous  peoples.  Social  safeguard  documents  for  tranche  1  projects  have  been \ndisclosed on PPL's website. All safeguard documents will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The \ninvestment program will support capacity within PPL to manage safeguards.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4.  The  risks  of  the \ninvestment program have been assessed and the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs.   \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of trust by the private sector in the grid power  Offtake agreements will be signed with major \nsupply results in continuing self-generation.  customers prior to connection to the grid. \nOther external factors will act to prevent private  Demand growth will be monitored in target \nsector expansion.  provincial centers.  \nLandowner disputes delay implementation.

Early extensive consultation has indicated land ownership disputes are manageable and the site-specific \nplans have been designed to monitor the negotiation process. (ADB. 1989.

The government and PPL have assured ADB that implementation of the investment \nprogram will conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the FAM and loan documents. The government has given ADB certain \nundertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by the \ngovernment  with  respect  to  individual  tranches  under  the  MFF  are  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. In addition, the government and \nPPL have agreed to the following specific assurances with respect to tranche 1: \n \n(i)  Divune hydropower. PPL will ensure that off-take agreements are signed with \nadditional commercial or industrial consumers for a minimum purchase of 6,000 \nmegawatt-hours (MWh) per annum, or will confirm project financial viability, prior \nto release of tenders for construction of Divune Hydropower Project.  \n(ii)  Ramazon  hydropower.  PPL  will  collect  additional  streamflow  data  prior  to \ndetailed design to confirm estimated flows.   \n(iii)  Transmission civil works. PPL will allocate adequate counterpart financing and \nstaffing to ensure construction of transmission lines in accordance with proposed \nproject implementation schedules.  \n(iv)  Maintenance. PPL will ensure that a maintenance program is established for \neach project and provide adequate financing for program implementation.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $120,000,000  to  Papua  New  Guinea  for  the  Town  Electrification \nInvestment Program comprising: \n \n(i)  loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  applicable  policies  relating  to  Special \nFunds resources, subject to conditions set forth in paragraph 16 of this report;  \n(ii)  loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; and \n(iii)  such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n1 November 2010 ", "    Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nFOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact       \nThe economic condition  Increase in PPL  PPL management system  Assumption \nof the population in the  customers (business    Improved power supply will \ntargeted provincial  and industrial) by 20%    encourage private sector \ncenters has improved.   in target provinces by    and improve economic \nthe end of 2016    conditions. \n     \nReduced self-power  Chamber of Commerce  Risks \ngeneration by  member reports  Private sector will not trust \ncustomers (business  the grid power supply and \nand industrial) by 20%  continue to self-generate. \nin target provincial   \ncenters by the end of  Other external factors will \n2016 (measured in  act to prevent the private \nMWh)  sector from expanding and \n  benefiting from the improved \npower supply. \n \nOutcome  All indicators are     \nImproved utilization of  relative to baseline of    Assumptions \nreliable, clean power to  January 2010.
