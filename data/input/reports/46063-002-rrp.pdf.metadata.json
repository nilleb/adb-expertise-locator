It  covers  almost  one-sixth  of  the  country\u2019s  total \narea.  In  2013,  its  population  was  about  22.65  million, 2 60.5%  of  which  comprises  36 ethnic \nminority  groups.3 XUAR  has  lagged  behind  in  economic  development  and  remains  one  of  the \npoorest and least-developed regions in the PRC. In 2013, XUAR\u2019s per capita disposable income \nof  urban  households  was  CNY19,874,  which  was  the  second  lowest  among  all  the  PRC \nprovinces  and  autonomous  regions. 4 Such  wide  disparities  prompted  the  Government  of  the \nPRC to launch the National Strategy for Development of the Western Region in 2000, with the \naim to promote balanced economic growth and to raise the living standards in the region. 5 \n\nTacheng Prefecture is in the northwest of XUAR  and shares a 480 kilometer (km)-long \n4. \nborder with Kazakhstan. Due to its strategic geographical location along the economic corridors \nof  the  New  Silk  Road  Economic  Belt,  border  trade  is  playing  an  increasing  role  in  local \neconomic development, which is based mainly on the rich agricultural and mineral resources of \nthe  prefecture. 6 To  promote  border  trade  development,  the  central  government  is  cooperating \nwith  the  regional  and  local  authorities  to  build  rail  and  road  networks,  upgrade  key  urban \ninfrastructure and land port facilities,  and support the development of small and medium-sized \nenterprises and the introduction of trade facilitation initiatives.7 These investments will provide a \nbig  opportunity  for  Tacheng  City  and  neighboring  counties such  as  Emin,  Tuoli,  and  Yumin to \nbecome strategic economic hubs and derive the benefits from the growing regional border trade. \n\n5. \nHowever,  Tacheng  Prefecture  is  still  lagging  the  central  areas  of  XUAR  significantly  in \nterms  of  income  levels  and  living  conditions.  The  disposable  income  at  CNY16,464  (2013)  is \nconsiderably  below  the  national  average  of  CNY24,565.  A  lack  of  investment  and  planning, \nexacerbated  by  a  harsh  natural  environment  and  high  demographic  pressure,  has  led  to \noutdated  and  precarious  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services  in  the  cities  of  Tacheng, \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  About 1.65% of the population of the PRC. \n3  The major groups are Hui, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, and Uygur. \n4  Disposable  income  is  total  personal  income  minus  personal  current  taxes.  In  the  PRC,  disposable  income  is \n\ncalculated separately for urban and rural citizens. \n\n5  State  Council  of  the  PRC.  2000.  The  National  Strategy  for  Development  of  the  Western  Region.  Beijing.  The \nstrategy focuses on developing infrastructure, protecting the environment, and strengthening economic cooperation \nand trade with neighboring provinces and countries. \n\n6  The New Silk Road Economic Belt is a key element of the One Belt and One Road national strategy  and aims to \npromote greater connectivity between the PRC and the central and western parts of Eurasia. Regional Cooperation \nand Integration (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7  A recent example of this is the selection of Baktu Land Port as a  green corridor for agricultural products between \nthe  PRC  and  Kazakhstan.  This  pilot  scheme  aims  to  achieve  faster  and  more  efficient  customs  clearance  and \ninspection of agricultural trade, and it is later to be replicated to other carefully selected land ports along the border. \n\n\f2 \n\nEmin, Tuoli, and Yumin. 8 This situation is constraining not only socioeconomic development but \nalso wider regional economic integration across the prefecture and border trade. \n\n6. \nThe  urban  road  network  in  the  project  cities  is  inadequate  for  the  planned  population \ngrowth and the resulting increase in commercial activities. The lack of roads increasingly makes \nthe  urban  areas  difficult  to access,  causing  serious  economic  and  safety  concerns  for  drivers, \nnonmotorized transport users, and pedestrians. Related to the poor quality of roads, access to \nbasic utilities is also low\u2014on average, 16% of households in the project cities are not connected \nto  clean  piped  water,  and  19%  are  not  connected  to  the  sewerage  system.  The  current \ncoverage  rate  of  district  heating  in  Tacheng  City  is  only  65%,  and  a  significant  share  of  the \npopulation  still  relies  on  small  coal-fired  boilers  and  family  heating  stoves,  resulting  in \nsubstantial  energy  inefficiency  and  air  pollution.  Municipal  solid  waste  (MSW)  management \ncapacity  is  limited,  sorting  facilities  are  lacking,  and  collection  systems  are  extremely  basic, \nwhich  also  causes  considerable  environmental  pollution.  Tacheng  City  is  crossed  by  the \nKalangguer  River,  which  carries  snowmelt  and  storm  flows  from  the  mountains  in  the  north. \nThroughout the city limits, the river remains unrestrained and some areas experience seasonal \nflooding  that  causes  significant  economic  losses  to  its  inhabitants.  A  considerable  share  of \nthese urban  populations  resides  in neighborhoods connected  by  unpaved  alleys.  These areas \nlack  access  to  basic  urban  services  and  safety  features  such  as  street  lighting,  making  living \nconditions difficult, especially in the harsh winters. In addition, all project cities and counties are \nalso  home  to  large  numbers  of  ethnic  minorities,  whose  members  experience  considerable \ndifficulties in adapting to the changing urban, economic, and social conditions. \n \n7. \nIn  2012,  Tacheng  City  and  the  counties  of  Emin,  Tuoli,  and  Yumin  approved  their \nrespective  master  plans  (2012\u20132030),  which  target  the  cities  to  become  livable  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable,  prioritizing  the  development  of  municipal  infrastructure  and \nservices  that  would  raise  the  living  standards  of  its  residents  and  support  their  effective \nintegration into the regional economy. The proposed project takes a multisector and integrated \napproach  to  urban  development,  meeting  the  urgent  and  prioritized  needs  identified  in  the \nmaster plans\u2014river rehabilitation; expansion of public and green spaces; improvements  to the \nurban  road  network  and  traffic  management,  water  supply  and  sewerage  services,  district \nheating service, solid waste collection system; and upgrading of equipment and services at the \nborder  land  port. 9  The  proposed  project  will  contribute  indirectly  to  poverty  reduction  by \nenhancing the access of urban and peri-urban residents to upgraded municipal services and an \nimproved  urban  environment.  The  project  will  also  help  promote  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration  (RCI).  This  will  be  achieved  by  enhancing  the  level  of  preparedness  of  the  target \ncities and counties to participate and benefit from the growing regional border trade and for their \neffective  integration  as  key  hubs  on  the  economic  corridors  of  the  New  Silk  Road  Economic \nBelt.10 \n\nStrategic  fit.  The  project  supports  a  key  goal  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian \n8. \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)\u2014making  cities  livable  and  sustainable  through  the  creation  of  a \ncleaner  and  healthier  environment.11 It  also  contributes  to  greater  physical  connectivity  as  set \n                                                \n8  Given greater rural\u2013urban migration, the urban population in Tacheng Prefecture has  grown to 75% (2012) of the \ntotal population. Population growth prospects are considerable: Tacheng: 2014 (170,000), 2030 (320,000); Emin: \n2014 (95,000), 2030 (150,000); Tuoli: 2014 (42,000), 2030 (90,000); and Yumin: 2014 (50,000), 2030 (90,000). \n9  In a demand\u2013supply analysis undertaken during project preparatory technical assistance, it was concluded that the \nexisting  and  planned  water  and  wastewater  treatment  plants  have  adequate  capacity  to  accommodate  the \nincreased demands arising from the proposed project components. \n\n10 Given  their  geographical  proximity  to  corridors  1  and  2  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n\nProgram, the project cities stand to benefit also from increasing investments and trade along these corridors. \n\n11 The project also supports ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming \n\nAsia and Pacific. Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nunder  ADB\u2019s  RCI  strategy.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  strategic  pillars  of  the  country \npartnership  strategy,  i.e.,  to  support  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth  by \npromoting growth-oriented and resource-efficient urbanization. 12 It also supports the main thrust \nof  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Operational  Plan  by  promoting  green,  competitive,  and  inclusive  cities. \nSimilarly, the project will be in line with the Government of the PRC\u2019s upcoming Thirteenth Five-\nYear  Plan  because  it  supports  balanced  urbanization  in  developing  cities  that  are  livable, \nresource  conserving,  and  inclusive. 13 By  supporting  greater  connectivity  with  Kazakhstan,  the \nproject  is  fully  in  line  with  the  PRC\u2019s  New  Silk  Road  Economic  Belt  initiative,  the  creation  of \neconomic  corridors,  and  enhancement  of  RCI.  It  also  supports  XUAR\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year \nPlan  (2016\u20132020),  which  gives  increasing  priority  to  the  development  of  border  areas  of  the \nregion  that  are  crucial  in  boosting  regional  trade.  In  addition,  the  project  is  aligned  with  the \nPRC\u2019s  National  Plan  on  New  Urbanization  (2014\u20132020)  by  accelerating  the  development  of \nsmall  and  medium-sized  cities  and  by  promoting  harmonious  and  coordinated  development \nbetween cities and surrounding small towns. 14 \n\n9. \nContinuity  of  development  initiatives  and  incorporation  of  lessons.  The  project \ndesign  incorporates  lessons  from  previous  ADB-financed  urban  development  projects  in  the \nPRC, particularly the four ongoing Xinjiang projects.15 For road construction, it avails of valuable \nexperience  from  the  Xinjiang  Urban  Transport  and  Environmental  Improvement  Project. 16 \nPractical  lessons  from  the  Xinjiang  Altay  Urban  Infrastructure  and  Environment  Improvement \nProject will apply to the establishment and maintenance of solid waste management systems.17 \nFollowing  reduce,  reuse,  recycle  (3R)  principles,  the  project  will  play  a  demonstration  role  for \nsimilar cities with basic systems of collection and sorting of MSW. \n \nSpecial  features.  The  project  includes  many  special  features  that  are  based  on  good \n10. \npractices  implemented  under  ADB projects  in  more  developed  provinces  of the  PRC.  Many  of \nthese  features  have  potential  for  replication  in  other  areas  of  XUAR  or  even  other  less \ndeveloped  regions  of  the  PRC  with  similar  conditions.  In  addition,  these  special  features \nreinforce the integrated nature of the project and along with capacity building, aim to strengthen \nthe  sustainability  of  the  project.  One  such  feature  is  integrated  flood  risk  management\u2014the \nproject  will  produce  structural  measures  (riverbank  stabilization  with  enhancement  of  green \nspaces,  roadside  stormwater  retention,  and  infiltration)  and  nonstructural  measures  (flood \nforecasting and early flood warning, emergency response, and raising public awareness of flood \nrisk) that will allow Tacheng City to develop an integrated management approach to urban flood \nrisks. Adoption of best practices for MSW management is another feature\u2014the project will pilot \nMSW  management  based  on  3R  principles  in  selected  communities  by  introducing  integrated \nsorted-at-source  collection  systems,  community  participation,  and  optimization  of  organic  and \nnonorganic waste disposal. Finally, border trade capacity will be stepped up as this is a critical \nsupplementary  feature\u2014in  addition  to  resourcing  Baktu  Land  Port  with  goods  and  equipment, \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012.

Price  contingencies  computed  at  4.16%  on  foreign  exchange  costs  and  9.37%  on  local \ncurrency costs. \n\nd  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the ADB loan has been computed at the \n5-year US dollar fixed swap rate plus a spread of 0.5%. Commitment charges for an ADB loan are 0.15% per year \nto be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19. \nThe loan will finance 49.53% of the project cost, including works, goods, and consulting \nservices  and  training.  The  loan  will  also  finance  taxes  and  duties  for  eligible  ADB-financed \nexpenditures,  and  transport  and  insurance costs.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of \nthese terms  and conditions. The  local governments  and/or  implementing agencies  will  provide \ncounterpart funding equivalent to $152.87 million, which will finance 50.47% of the project cost. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nThe PRC is the borrower of the loan and will make it available through the Government \n20. \nof  XUAR  and  the  Tacheng  Prefecture  Government  (TPG)  to  the  local  governments\u2014i.e.,  of \nTacheng  City,  and  Emin,  Tuoli,  and  Yumin  counties\u2014on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as \nthose  of  the  ADB  loan.  As  the  end-borrowers,  the  local  governments  will  assume  foreign \nexchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  for  the  ADB  loan.  The  PRC,  XUAR,  Tacheng \nPrefecture, and local governments have assured ADB that counterpart funding will be provided \nin  a  timely  manner,  including  any  additional  counterpart  funding  required  for  any  shortfall  of \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nfunds or cost overruns.

The \ntransport  component  incorporates  holistic  road  design  and  safety  design  considerations.  The \nKalangguer River flood-control works, including riverbank revitalization, will greatly improve the \nresilience  of  the  city  to  floods  and  at  the  same  time  embellish  the  urban  environment.  River \nembankment  heights  are  based  on  the  design  flood  height  and  include  a  0.6-meter  safety \nmargin  to  account  for  uncertainties  in  design  assumptions  and  potential  increases  in  storm \nintensity  as  a  result  of  climate  change.20 Where  possible,  the  component  designs  incorporate \n3R approaches to MSW management and energy-efficient district heating supply. The detailed \nengineering  design  will  comply  with  up-to-date  urban  design  standards  and  specifications  and \nadopt  international  best  practices.  A  capacity-building  program  for  related  urban  services  is \nincluded in the project to ensure sustainable O&M of project facilities. A detailed description is in \nthe PAM. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nEconomic. The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects.21 The base-case economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRRs) for individual subprojects as well as the project as a whole have been calculated. \nAt  a 12%  discount rate, the  whole project  is found  to  be  economically  viable. The  net  present \nvalue for the whole project is CNY362.0 million and the base-case EIRR for the whole project is \n15.3%, which exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital. The EIRR for the Tacheng City \nsubproject  is  15.5%;  Emin,  13.8%;  Tuoli,  16.2%;  and  Yumin,  14.6%.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nshows  that  the  project\u2019s  economic  return  is  robust  against  negative  impacts  from  benefit \nreduction, cost overrun, and project implementation delay. \n \n25. \nFinancial. The subprojects with a focus on cost recovery were analyzed  based on key \nfinancial  ratios  describing  risk  and  profitability.  The  analysis  evaluated  their  viability  by \ncomparing their financial internal rates of return with the weighted average cost of capital. The \nreturns  were  computed  at  4.5%\u20138.4%,  all  exceeding  the  respective  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital  of  2.9%,  which  makes \nfunding \nrequirements, debt service costs, and recurrent project O&M costs were compared with forecast \nrevenues  and  expenditures.  The  proposed  fund-flow  arrangement  for  the  project  is  consistent \nwith ongoing ADB projects in XUAR and uses proven domestic disbursement procedures. \n \nC. \n\ninvestments  viable.  Counterpart \n\nthe  proposed \n\nGovernance \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n26. \nwith  the  management  and  staff  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM,  including  providing \nsupport and training on ADB policies and procedures, engaging a tendering agent and project \nimplementation  consultant  to  strengthen  procurement.  The  financial  management  assessment \nconcludes  that,  although  the  PMO  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  sufficient  financial \nmanagement capacity, they lack sufficient experience in managing ADB projects and require a \ncomponent  to  build  their  capacity  to  implement  the  project  in  line  with  ADB  policies  and \nprocedures.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  concludes  that  Tacheng  Prefecture  PMO, \n\n                                                \n20 The  climate  risk  to  the  project  was  assessed  through  desk  review,  and  is  considered  medium.  Annual  mean \n\ntemperature and annual precipitation are projected to increase significantly in the project area. \n\n21 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nimplementing  agencies,  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  lack  experience  in  ADB-  or \nforeign-funded  project.  Strong  support  from  implementation  consultants  and  a  well-designed \ntraining program shall be provided to ensure effective and efficient project implementation. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nThe direct beneficiaries of the project are mostly urban residents in the project areas of \nTacheng  City  and  Emin,  Tuoli,  and  Yumin  counties  of  Tacheng  Prefecture,  accounting  for \n256,751 people, including about 34,533 poor (13.4% of total beneficiaries); 127,268 women and \ngirls  (49.6%);  and  120,183  ethnic  minority  people  (46.8%).  The  project  will  provide  residents \nwith better roads and transport services, access to safe and reliable water supply and heating \nservices, and an improved living environment. Public awareness programs and implementation \nof  transport  safety  and  sanitation  management  will  ensure  the  positive  and  long-term  social \nbenefits  of  the  project.  Construction  activities  will  directly  create  1,286  temporary  jobs  during \nproject implementation; O&M of project outputs will directly create an estimated 237 permanent \njobs. Many temporary jobs will be available for unskilled labor, and contractors are encouraged \nto employ local workers whenever possible. The Tacheng Prefecture PMO has set employment \ntargets for  women (30%),  the  poor (15%),  and  ethnic minorities (30%). The project  city  and/or \ncounty community offices and the Labor Bureau will assist contractors in realizing these targets. \nThe PIUs will ensure that all PRC labor laws and labor standards are complied with. This will be \nclosely  monitored  under  the  project  performance  monitoring  system.  Details  on  specific \nmeasures to ensure the poverty and social benefits are in the gender action plan (GAP), social \ndevelopment action plan in the PAM, and ethnic minority development plan (EMDP). \n \nGender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  More \n28. \neffective infrastructure will reduce time burdens, increase mobility and access, and boost public \nhealth. The poverty and social analysis revealed that women strongly support the project across \nall  city  and/or  county,  as  it  will  improve  their  quality  of  life,  mobility,  access,  and  health,  and \ncreate jobs  and income opportunities.  Gender  has been  mainstreamed  into  the  project  design \n(features  such  as  road  lighting,  nonmotorized  transport,  and  pedestrian  access  are  included). \nThe GAP includes specific targets for women in terms of employment and participation, which \nhave  been  assured  by  the  government.  The  GAP  will  ensure  (i)  women\u2019s  consultation  and \nparticipation  in  traffic  safety  and  sanitation  management  awareness,  transport  services,  and \nother  project  activities  (50%);  (ii)  jobs  and  income  opportunities  during  and  after  project \nimplementation  (30%);  (iii)  gender  sensitivity  training;  and  (iv)  appropriate  gender  targets, \nindicators, and sex-disaggregated data. The TPG will be responsible for implementing the GAP \nand reporting semiannually on progress and achievements of gender benefits under the project. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nEnvironment.  The  project  environment  categorization  is  B.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination and an environmental management plan (EMP) were prepared in accordance with \nthe requirements set out in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on February 2015. Anticipated environmental impacts and risks are mostly modest and \nlocalized,  and  can  be  mitigated  to  an  acceptable  level  through  EMP  implementation.  Project \nconstruction  will  require  significant  earthwork,  which  will  temporarily  increase  soil  erosion. 22 \nOther  negative  impacts  during  construction  include  noise,  dust,  temporary  traffic  disturbance, \nand  localized  deterioration  of  the  Kalangguer  River  water  quality  caused  by  riverbank  works. \nDuring  operation,  road  improvements  will  minimize  dust  and  inefficient  driving  practices  but \noverall, traffic noise and greenhouse gas emissions will increase as traffic increases. The TPG \n\n                                                \n22 The  project  will  require  2.71  million  cubic  meters  of  borrow  and  generate  0.97  million  cubic  meters  of  spoil,  and \n\ncould induce 24,300 tons of soil erosion without soil protection measures. \n\n\f9 \n\nwill delegate the overall EMP coordination to the Tacheng Prefecture PMO and implementation \nresponsibility  to  the  PIUs.  Capacity  building  will  be  provided  to  the  Tacheng  Prefecture  PMO \nand  PIUs  in  coordinating  EMP  implementation,  and  to  relevant  local  authorities  to  properly \nmaintain project facilities, including periodic review of maintenance plans to account for potential \nincreases in maintenance requirements resulting from climate change. \n \n30. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlements. The project will acquire about 1,474 mu of collective land and 1,481 mu of state-\nowned land.23 A total of 91,001 square meters including residential houses and 11,761 square \nmeters of shops and enterprises will be demolished. The permanent land acquisition and house \ndemolition will affect 684 households with 2,389 persons, of which 831 persons belong to ethnic \nminority groups. Nearly 237 households with 1,148 persons will suffer house demolition impacts \nand  will  be  physically  displaced.  Four  resettlement  plans  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  have  been  developed  for  each  project  city  and/or  county.  Compensation  for \nlost  assets  and  allowances  will  be  at  replacement  costs  and  paid  to  affected  persons  prior  to \ndisplacement.  The  resettlement  information  booklets  have  been  disclosed  to  the  community, \nvillage  offices,  and  affected  persons  in  both  the  Chinese  and  Kazakh  languages  in  February \n2015. Resettlement plans have also been posted on the ADB website. Each city and/or county \nPMO  and  PIU  will  have  at  least  two  full-time  resettlement  staff,  and  each  PIU  will  carry  out \ninternal  supervision  and  monitoring  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  resettlement  plan.  During \nproject implementation, training on ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy and procedures will be \nprovided  to  the  PMO  and/or  PIU  and  resettlement  management  staff  to  make  sure  that  land \nacquisition and resettlement activities is implemented properly. A grievance mechanism will be \nset up and an independent agency will be engaged for the semiannual external monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \n31. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is classified as category B for the indigenous peoples. \nEthnic minorities in Tacheng Prefecture represent about 46.8% of the total population. The top \nseven  minorities  in  the  project  area  and Tacheng  Prefecture,  based  on  the  latest  census,  are \nDaur, Hui, Kazakh, Mongolian, Russian, Uygur, and Xibe. The majority of ethnic people in these \ncounties  are  Kazakh,  who,  in 2012,  represented  over  76%  of  the ethnic minority  population in \nthe  project  city  and/or  counties.  The  poverty  and  social  analysis  found  that  the  urban \ncommunities are ethnically mixed and some aspects, such as cultural and language differences, \nare maintained. Not all ethnic minority people speak Mandarin, especially those middle-aged or \nolder.  Accordingly,  an  EMDP  has  been  developed  to  facilitate  the  inclusion  of  ethnic  minority \npeople in all project activities and to protect them from any disadvantages that language barriers \nmay  create  with  respect  to  employment  by  project  contractors.  The  EMDP,  endorsed  by  the \ngovernment,  was  disclosed  in  February  2015  in  both  the  Mandarin  and  Kazakh  languages  to \nethnic  minority  people  targeted  by  the  project.
