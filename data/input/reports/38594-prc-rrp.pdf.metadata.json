An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nAssessment  undertaken for this sector lending project. The summary EIA for \nthree core subprojects was circulated to the Board of Directors of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  on  19  August  2006  and \nuploaded  to  the  ADB  website  on  21  August  2006.  The \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  H.  The  summary  EIA  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix N. The summary initial environmental \nexamination for three other core subprojects is in Supplementary \nAppendix O.  \n   \nProject Description  The  proposed  Project  supports  the  policies  and  plans  of  the \nGovernment  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and \nGuiyang municipal government (GMG) for introducing integrated \nwater resources management (IWRM) in Guiyang Municipality. \nThe Project will finance a slice of the Guiyang Integrated Water \nResources Master Plan (2006\u20132020, the Master Plan), a medium-\nterm investment plan for Guiyang Municipality. While the Master \nPlan is mainly focused on structural interventions and covers the \nwhole range of water sector investments, including wastewater \ntreatment  and  flood  management,  the  Project  will  focus  its \nactivities on five segments of the Master Plan: (i) urban water \nsupply, (ii) rural water supply and irrigation, (iii) irrigation system \nrehabilitation, (iv) soil and water conservation, and (v) small water \nstorage  structures.  The  Project  will  also  address  nonstructural \ninterventions  including  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \ndevelopment, stakeholder participation, water tariff adjustments, \nintegrated  information  management  system,  hydrological \nmonitoring  center,  and  other  demand-management  measures. \nThe Project will be implemented over a 6-year period, 2010\u20132016. \nThe Project will follow the sector investment approach and finance \nsix core subprojects that have already been prepared, as well as \nan  undetermined  number  of  noncore  subprojects  that  will  be \nprepared and approved during project implementation. \n   \nRationale  Guiyang  Municipality  lies  in  the  mountainous  watershed  that \n  separates the Yangtze River Basin to the north from the Pearl \nRiver Basin to the south. While there are adequate natural water ", "ii   \nresources in Guiyang Municipality, significant problems relate to \nthe following:  \n \n(i)  The difficulties in capturing sufficient quantities of water \nand its distribution to users. Much of the water drains into \nrivers  as  quick  surface  flows  through  numerous  short \ncreeks and streams that run deep in valleys, or through \nfast-flowing deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) through the \nlimestone layers (karst areas).   \n(ii)  The poor condition of urban water supply infrastructure \nand  Guiyang  Municipality\u2019s  rapidly  increasing  urban \npopulation. This combination has seriously stretched the \nexisting water supply capacity, resulting in reduced water \npressure and water rationing in dry periods. \n(iii)  The shortage of water for potable use and irrigation in the \nsurrounding rural area, constraining the improvement of \nrural resident incomes and living standards. Only about \nhalf  of  the  households  in  rural  areas  of  Guiyang \nMunicipality have piped water supply and about 420,000 \nrural residents face potable water shortages. \n(iv)  The fragmented management in the Guiyang Municipality \nwater sector. There is vertical fragmentation with different \nresponsibilities  between  provincial,  municipal,  and \ndistrict/county levels; and there is horizontal fragmentation \nwith  responsibilities  for  water  sector  management  split \nbetween different functional departments of each level of \ngovernment. \n \nGMG has given a commitment to develop solutions based on \nIWRM. GMG has also formulated the Master Plan, which covers \nall aspects of infrastructure needs while recognizing some of the \ndeficiencies  of  current  water  sector  management,  including \nfragmented institutional arrangements and inadequate attention to \nwater demand management. Investments under the Master Plan \nwill focus predominantly on supply side interventions, but there is \na  need  for  parallel  efforts  in  institutional  reform  and  demand \nmanagement, which will be addressed by the Project. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will support an area and time slice of the Master Plan, \n  the  achievement  of  which  will  contribute  to  sustainable  and \ninclusive  socioeconomic  growth  in  Guiyang  Municipality  with \ncorresponding  reductions  in  poverty,  especially  in  rural  areas \nwhere the problem is endemic. The outcome of the Project will be \nthat  water  supply  and  demand  in  Guiyang  Municipality  are \nbalanced in a sustainable manner.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $439.2 million, \n  including taxes and duties of $14.1 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $150 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \n  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 26-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in ", "  iii\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nTotal \nSource \n($ million)    % \nAsian Development Bank  150.0    34.2 \nGuiyang Municipal Government  258.0    58.7 \nGuiyang Municipal Commercial Bank  20.0    4.5 \nBeneficiaries  11.2    2.6 \n  Total         439.2        100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the \nTerms  Guizhou provincial government, which will onlend to GMG on the \nsame terms and conditions as the ADB loan. Loan proceeds for \nsubprojects will be disbursed by the Guiyang finance bureau to \nlocal-level finance bureaus. GMG will bear the interest and foreign \nexchange rate variation risks, and be responsible for repayment of \nthe loan.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 October 2016 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 April 2016 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency   Guiyang Municipal Government \n   \nImplementation  The project management office (PMO), under the overall direction \nArrangements  and  guidance  of  the  project  leading  group  headed  by  the \nvice mayor  of  Guiyang  Municipality,  will  coordinate  project \nimplementation  work  through  the  various  design  institutes  and \nimplementing agencies responsible for day-to-day implementation \narrangements. The PMO will be responsible for directing project \npreparation  activities,  monitoring  resettlement,  managing \nenvironmental impacts, monitoring project progress and project \nimpacts,  and  assisting  participating  districts  and  counties  in \nimplementing their subprojects. The PMO is comprised of staff \nprimarily from Guiyang Municipal Water Resources Bureau, as \nwell  as  representatives  of  the  Guiyang  Finance  Bureau,  the \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, the Resettlement Office, \nand other line agencies of GMG.  \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Major contracts for equipment and materials valued at \n$1 million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  awarded  through  ADB\u2019s \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Smaller \npackages  for  equipment  and  materials  valued  at  less  than \n$1 million  equivalent  will  be  procured  following  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  in  accordance  with  the \n ", "iv   \n1999 PRC\u2019s Tendering and Bidding Law, subject to modifications \nagreed  with  ADB.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$10 million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  carried  out  using  ICB \nprocedures, while those costing less than $10 million equivalent \nwill  be  carried  out  using  NCB  procedures.  Shopping  will  be \nallowed for goods and contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or \nless  and  for  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  $200,000  or  less. \nSmall  civil  works  contracts  of  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  on \nsubprojects  involving  small-scale  reservoirs,  irrigation  system \nrehabilitation,  soil  and  water  conservation,  and  small  water \nstorage tanks may be carried out on a force account basis or \nthrough community participation, whenever practicable, to ensure \nsustainability  and  to  achieve  the  Project\u2019s  social  objectives. \nInternational contractors may participate in bidding for contracts \nusing NCB procedures. \n \nConsulting Services  Twenty-four  person-months  of  international  and  171  person-\nmonths of national consulting services will be required during the \nfirst 4 years of project implementation, with expertise in project \nmanagement,  training,  procurement,  economic  and  financial \nanalysis,  water  demand  management,  community  participation, \nand social and environmental safeguards. The consultants will \nprovide guidance and training for capacity development to ensure \nthat (i) subproject implementing agencies are able to function as \neffective  project  management  units;  (ii)  noncore  ADB-funded \nsubprojects can be appraised and approved in a timely manner \nbased on the agreed eligibility criteria; (iii) implementation of water \ndemand management activities will promote more efficient use of \nwater among all categories of users; and (iv) social, resettlement, \nand  environmental  impacts  are  monitored  and  mitigated. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  through  an  international  firm  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Detailed  design  and \nengineering and construction supervision will be carried out using \ngovernment counterpart funds by qualified local design institutes \nrecruited by the local implementing agencies. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will provide extensive water resources benefits that \nBeneficiaries  will affect about 1.6 million residents or 45% of the total population \n  of Guiyang Municipality. At project completion, expected benefits \nwill include (i) increases in urban water supply of 40 million cubic \nmeters  (m3)  per  year;  (ii)  increases  in  rural  water  supply  of \n94.8 million m3 per year; (iii) improvement in the existing irrigation \narea of 10,773 hectares (ha) and an increase in the irrigation area \nof 18,815 ha; (iv) increased irrigation coverage from 0.3 mu to \n0.5 mu per capita; (v) soil conservation treatment to an area of \n800  square  kilometers  (km2)  of  land  at  risk  of  erosion; and \n(vi) provision of 105,100 small water storage tanks in rural areas \nto  collect  spring  and  rainwater  for  drinking,  irrigation,  and \nlivestock. It is estimated that about 240,000 rural beneficiaries will \nbe given access to safe drinking water as a result of the Project \nand  about  59,200  farmers  will  benefit  from  improved  irrigation ", "  v\nservices. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  has  several  potential  environmental,  institutional, \nfinancial, and policy risks related to (i) drought and excessive \nclimate  variation,  (ii)  increased  rural  to  urban  migration, \n(iii) unforeseen physical conditions that could affect construction \ncosts and schedules, and (iv) resistance to water tariff reforms. \nImportant assumptions include the following: (i) the Government\u2019s \ncontinued  policy  program  for  sustainable  development, \n(ii) effective  agriculture  extension  support  to  farmers,  (iii)  the \nGovernment  actively  encourages  a  participatory  approach  to \nwater  resources  management,  (iv)  incentives  for  effective \ninteragency  coordination  are  introduced,  (v)  timely  financing  is \nidentified for other activities in the Master Plan, (vi) community \nsupport will be enlisted to help construct and maintain rural water \ninfrastructure,  and  (vii) mitigation  measures  to  protect  water \nquality will be taken by neighboring administrative jurisdictions.   \n \n  The Project includes measures to mitigate these risks and verify \nassumptions  that  include  (i)  extensive  stakeholder  consultation \nduring the design of subprojects; (ii) regular tariff reviews and \nadjustments by the Government following national guidelines as \nwell as public awareness programs; (iii) regular examination of the \nGMG  budget  to  assess  availability  of  counterpart  funding; \n(iv) formal  commitment  from  GMG  to  introduce  IWRM-based \nreforms; and (v) implementation of training, capacity development, \nand community support programs.   \n \nTechnical Assistance   The technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Water Resources \nManagement in Guiyang for IWRM institutional reforms is being \nundertaken to enable the institutional environment and to assist \neffective implementation of the Project. The three main initiatives \nbeing  addressed  by  the  TA  are  (i)  improved  coordination  and \neffectiveness  of  government  agencies  responsible  for  water \nmanagement;  (ii)  promotion  of  community  participatory \napproaches to water resources management; and (iii) a strong \nshift  toward  demand  management,  consistent  with  the  current \nnational  campaign  for  a  \u201cwater  saving  society.\u201d  The  policy, \ninstitutional,  and  IWRM-based  reforms  to  be  implemented  in \nconjunction  with  the  TA  and  in  parallel  with  the  structural \ninterventions under the Project will bring about improvements in \n(i) subproject design through increased stakeholder involvement, \n(ii) sustainability of operations and maintenance, (iii) resolution of \nwater conflicts, (iv) interagency and cross-sector cooperation, and \n(v) increased emphasis on water conservation activities. \n ", "106 o 15'E 107 o 00'E\nGUIYANG INTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES\nMANAGEMENT (SECTOR) PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA R.\nWujiang \nZhaiji\nMachang\n       Wujiangdu\nReservoir\nLiuchang Longshui\nMiping\nXiaozhaiba\n27 o 10'N Fengsan 27 o 10'N\nDownstream of\nWujiang River\nXifeng\nLiutong\nShuangliu Kaiyang\nQingshan\nNanlong\nQingshui River\nLiuguang District Maoyun\nXiaojing JiuchangLiutun Fenghe Qingsh\nu\ni R\n.\nXindian Maotiao R.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Guiyang  Integrated  Water  Resources \nManagement (Sector) Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC has been experiencing water shortages for several decades. Total naturally \navailable water flows from all surface and underground sources in this country are about 2,812 \nbillion cubic meters (m\u00b3) per annum, placing the PRC sixth behind Brazil, Russian Federation, \nCanada, Indonesia, and the United States.1 On a per capita basis, the naturally available water \nflow (2,206 m\u00b3/person), accounting for about 28% of the world's average, is one of the lowest \nlevels  in  the  world.2 Therefore,  as  population  and  wealth  increase,  it  is  inevitable  that \nincreasingly serious water management problems will be encountered in the PRC. The PRC\u2019s \nannual per capita water availability has dropped by about 23% in the last 20 years, and the \ncountry is expected to become the most water-stressed in east and northeast Asia by 2010. \n \n3.  Adding to the complications, the availability of water resources varies significantly across \nregions and seasons. This represents a major development challenge, as the demand for water \nis ever increasing with rapid economic development and urbanization. In rural areas, well-\ndeveloped  and  maintained  infrastructure,  including  irrigation  facilities,  is  a  precondition  for \nreasonable living standards, and is critical for poverty alleviation. Thus, effective water resource \nallocation and management is necessary to maximize the benefits of water usage. \n \n4.  The Guizhou Province is one of the poorest provinces in the PRC, with the second \nlowest rural income, and has the lowest level of urban income of any province. The capital of \nthe province, Guiyang Municipality, is its political, economic, and cultural center; and a major \ntransportation hub of the southwest PRC. In 2008, Guiyang Municipality has an estimated \npopulation of 3.6 million, of which about 2.4 million reside in the main urban area, with the \nremaining 1.2 million in suburban or rural areas. About 574,000 people (16% of the total \npopulation) are ethnic minorities who mainly reside in the rural areas. The income disparity \nbetween the rural and urban population is high, and about 25% of the rural population lives on \nan income of less than CNY1,200 ($176) per capita per year. Like many other areas in the PRC, \nGuiyang Municipality is undergoing rapid urbanization with the urban population increasing at \nover 3% per annum, a trend that is likely to continue. \n \n5.  Guiyang Municipality is one of the PRC\u2019s major producers of nonferrous metals and \ntobacco, and major industries include machinery, steel making, food processing, and chemicals. \nThe total gross domestic product of Guiyang Municipality in 2008 was equivalent to about \nCNY81.1 billion, of which the tertiary (service) sector accounted for about 47%, the secondary \n(manufacturing) sector about 47%, and the primary (mining and agriculture) sector about 6%. \nHowever, the primary sector is much more important in terms of employment, accounting for \n34% of recorded employment in Guiyang Municipality.  \n                                                 \n1 Shalizi,  Z.  2006.  Addressing  China\u2019s  Growing  Water  Shortages  and  Associated  Social  and  Environmental \nConsequences. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3895. Washington, DC. \n2  Jiao, Y. 2005. China Water Policy and Practice, Conference on Water and Sustainable Development: Towards \nInnovative Solutions. New Delhi.  ", "2   \n6.  As the economic hub of the province, Guiyang Municipality has a rapidly increasing \npopulation and industrial development, and hence increasing demand for water. Servicing this \npopulation and related municipal and industrial water demands is causing a severe strain on the \nexisting water supply facilities. Urbanization in Guiyang Municipality means increased water \ndemand for household, commercial, and industrial use. The water quality in local rivers and \nwater sources is also a growing concern because of the rapid urbanization and industrialization.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  Both urban and rural areas of Guiyang Municipality are on the mountainous ridge of the \nwatershed boundary between the Yangtze River basin to the north and the Pearl River basin to \nthe south. Annual average precipitation is quite high but large evaporative losses and uneven \ndistribution present particular challenges for capturing and storing water, much of which drains \ninto rivers as quick surface flows through numerous short creeks and streams that run deep in \nvalleys, or through fast-flowing deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) through the limestone layers \n(karst areas).  \n \n8.  The Guiyang Municipality urban water supply infrastructure is in poor condition and its \nrapidly increasing urban population has seriously stretched the existing water supply capacity, \nresulting in reduced water pressure, and water rationing in dry periods. It is projected that the \nannual water shortage will reach about 420 million m3 in 2010 and about 642 million m3 in 2020. \nRapid urbanization is generating increased volumes of wastewater, much of which is being left \nuntreated. \n \n9.  In  the  surrounding  rural  area,  shortage  of  water  for  potable  use  and  irrigation  is \nperceived as a critical constraint to improving rural incomes and living standards. Only about \nhalf of the households in the rural areas of Guiyang Municipality have piped water supply and \nabout 420,000 rural households face potable water shortages. In the absence of public water \nsupply  systems,  the  majority  of  the  rural  population  relies  on  local  springs  and  streams, \nalthough some have small storage structures near their homes for domestic and livestock use. \nMost of the rural water is needed for agricultural purposes. However, the steep mountainous \nterrain  makes  it  very  difficult  for  farmers  to  obtain  surface  or  groundwater  for  irrigation, \nparticularly at higher elevations. Seasonal variation in water availability is high. Farmers have \ndifficulties growing crops during the dry months from February to April, and the short growing \nseason  prevents  them  from  further  diversifying  their  cropping  systems.  This  situation  is \nexpected  to be further complicated by climate change impacts.3 The irrigation coverage in \nGuiyang Municipality is much lower than the national average, and many existing structures \nhave been damaged and abandoned. Water use efficiencies in larger irrigation schemes are \nestimated to be no more than 40%. Meanwhile, sustainable watershed management is urgently \nneeded to prevent soil erosion and pollution, and to protect water sources. \n \n10.  Currently, the Guiyang Municipality water sector management is not well integrated. \nThere is vertical fragmentation with different responsibilities between provincial, municipal, and \ndistrict/county levels; and there is also horizontal fragmentation, with responsibilities for water \nsector  management  split  between  different  government  departments.  Specific  water \nmanagement issues include (i) absence of a formal process of stakeholder consultation and \ninvolvement; (ii) despite being closely integrated in physical terms, suburban districts continue \n                                                 \n3  Climate change has three big implications for water use: (i) it changes the way plants grow; (ii) it increases \nproblems of water management, and larger floods overwhelm existing controls; and (iii) some regions are swinging \nmore violently between flood and drought. This is one big reason why dams have been making a comeback. ", "  3 \nto  have  their  own  water  supply  companies;  (iii)  local  townships,  villages,  and  individual \nhouseholds  are  charged  with  managing  their  own  water  supplies,  thereby  losing  potential \nbenefits from physical and management integration; and (iv) lack of coordination between water \ndepartments, agriculture departments, and local water users, resulting in poor irrigation water \ndelivery systems and optimization of cropping patterns. \n \n11.  In  recent  years,  the  Government  has  recognized  the  urgency  to  improve  the \ncomprehensive management of water resources, apply approaches consistent with integrated \nwater resources management (IWRM) methodologies, and shift emphasis toward managing \ndemand, including the use of economic mechanisms. A crucial milestone along this path was \nreached on 1 October 2002 when the revised Water Law was made effective, and its added \nemphasis to water resources planning, protection of water resources, economical use of water, \nresolution of disputes concerning water, and enforcement of water use regulations, all of which \nare common water resources management concerns. \n \n12.  Adopting the principles of IWRM will become more important as water demand and \ncompetition  increase.  Under  the  2002  Water  Law,  the  responsibilities  of  the  river  basin \ncommissions4 and local water bureaus with respect to integrated water resources planning have \nbeen strengthened. The 2002 Water Law also stipulates full cost recovery for urban water \nservices. In 2004, the China Council for International Cooperation on the Environment and \nDevelopment  completed  an  important  policy  recommendation  entitled  Promoting  Integrated \nRiver Basin Management and Restoring China\u2019s Living Rivers.5 Since then, the challenges \nassociated with its adoption have been discussed in various forums, including the Second \nYangtze Forum in April 2007 and the Third International Yellow River Forum on Sustainable \nWater Resources Management and Delta Ecosystem Maintenance in October 2007.  \n \n13.  A recent comprehensive review of progress in adopting the IWRM approach in the PRC \nconcluded that there has been considerable progress, but there is still a long way to go.6 The \nreport set out detailed recommendations for medium- and long-term actions in five main areas\u2014\nlegal and institutional reform, policy integration, IWRM master planning, public participation, and \nscience and technology support\u2014making it clear that sustainable IWRM is a long-term process \nthat takes many years to achieve. \n \n14.  The Guiyang municipal government (GMG) recognizes this shift toward IWRM, and has \ngiven a commitment to develop solutions based on IWRM, including the establishment of an \ninteragency project leading group (PLG). GMG has also formulated the Guiyang Integrated \nWater  Resources  Master  Plan  (2006\u20132020,  the  Master  Plan),  which  covers  all  aspects  of \ninfrastructure  needs  while  recognizing  some  of  the  deficiencies  of  current  water  sector \nmanagement arrangements, including fragmented institutional arrangements and inadequate \nattention  to  water  demand  management.  Investments  under  the  Master  Plan  will  focus \npredominantly on supply-side interventions, but there is a need for parallel efforts in institutional \n                                                 \n4  Seven river basin-based water resources commissions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Water Resources \nwere set up in the 1950s for improving water resource planning and coordinating flood control. Most of Guiyang \nMunicipality (95%) lies in the Yangtze river basin under the jurisdiction of the Yangtze River Water Resources \nCommission, with its headquarters in Wuhan. A small part of Guiyang Municipality (5%) is within the Pearl River \ncatchment under the jurisdiction of the Pearl River Water Resources Commission, with its headquarters in \nGuangzhou. \n5  China Council for International Cooperation on the Environment and Development. 2004.

Further information about the \nMaster Plan is in Appendix 2.   \n \n15.  The following challenges to the implementation of IWRM in Guiyang Municipality remain \nto  be  addressed:  (i)  lack  of  experience  in  involving  local  stakeholders  in  the  design, \nimplementation, and operation of water projects; (ii) duplication of water quality monitoring and \nlack  of  coordination  between  the  Water  Resources  Bureau  (WRB)  and  the  Environmental \nProtection Bureau, and conflicting responsibilities for urban water management among WRB, \nUrban  Construction  Bureau,  and  Urban  Management  Bureau;  (iii)  constraints  to  the \ndissemination of information between water management agencies; (iv) lack of awareness and \nincentives for increased demand management and water conservation activities; (v) poorly \nintegrated institutionalized planning of water resources; (vi) inconsistency in applying economic \ninstruments, including the issuance of water permits, which is not applied at all to rural water \nuse; (vii) insufficient implementation of demand management programs; and (viii) a variety of \ntechnical issues, such as conflicting systems of water and environment function zoning. A \nproblem tree analysis is in Supplementary Appendix V. \n \n16.  These challenges will be partly addressed with the implementation of the Master Plan \nand the Project will contribute solutions to achieve greater coordination and optimization of \nwater supply and demand management activities in line with IWRM principles.  \n \n17.  External assistance. To help the Government develop and implement its strategies in \nmanaging  the  water  sector,  external  assistance  has  been  provided  mainly  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. \nADB has provided 19 loans totaling more than $2 billion for water sector projects. ADB has also \nfinanced 61 technical assistance (TA) projects for more than $35 million to address issues \nrelating to water resources management, flood management, soil conservation, water supply, \nand wastewater management. ADB assistance has resulted in the  construction of needed \ninfrastructure and institutional capacity development, more rational pricing of water, introduction \nof wastewater tariffs, implementation of commercial principles, and private sector participation. \nThese improvements are fundamental to making the water sector financially and operationally \nsustainable, and in managing water as an economic resource.  \n \n18.  Two projects currently under implementation in Guiyang Municipality are funded by the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation and involve environmental management in the water \nsector: (i) the Guiyang Environment Model City Project, and (ii) the Guizhou Guiyang Water \nEnvironmental Improvement Project targeting wastewater management in Guiyang City. The \nlatter is particularly relevant as it complements the proposed Project with activities designed for \nwastewater management. External assistance is further described in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s experience in the PRC water sector indicates that projects are \ngenerally well planned and implemented, although there is considerable scope to increase the \nuse of participatory approaches in project design and implementation, especially in rural areas. \nThe TA completion report for Strategic Options for the Water Sector7 highlighted the need for \n(i) shifting to a more unified and integrated approach, and (ii) shifting from traditional structural \nmeasures to preventive and anticipatory nonstructural measures. While urban water tariffs have \nbeen increased for full cost recovery, water supplies in rural areas remain heavily subsidized \nand the financial sustainability of investments is an issue. Willingness-to-pay analysis indicates \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance Completion Report on a Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor Strategic Options for the Water Sector. Manila.  ", "  5 \nthat rural consumers are willing to pay substantially higher water tariffs if service improves. \nLessons incorporated in the project design include greater focus on (i) institutional reforms to \npromote sustainable IWRM, including the establishment of water users associations (WUAs); \n(ii) the  adoption  of  participatory  approaches  to  improve  subproject  design  and  confirm \nstakeholder support; and (iii) financial and institutional arrangements for sustainable operation \nand maintenance (O&M).  \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s sector lending approach together with IWRM was introduced in the PRC in 2001, \nstarting with the Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project,8 and followed by the Songhua \nRiver Flood Management Sector Project9 in 2002, and the Hunan Flood Management Sector \nProject10 in 2006. The earlier projects demonstrate the long-term nature of the IWRM process, \nwhich requires full government and stakeholder commitment. Whenever there is an IWRM \nproject,  the  challenging  task  will  be  to  build  integrated  institutional  capacity  for  achieving \nsustainable IWRM objectives.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Sector Investment Approach \n \n21.  The Project will adopt a sector investment approach and GMG has complied with the \nprocedural requirements of ADB\u2019s policy for sector lending.11 The Project was prepared in line \nwith the Master Plan to respond to current and impending problems in the management of the \nwater sector including shortages. The Project will finance and help implement a subset of the \nmeasures identified in the Master Plan. These include structural measures focusing on urban \nand rural water supply capacity (supply management), irrigation water use efficiency (demand \nmanagement), and protection of water resources through the control of soil erosion. Rural \ninterventions, particularly the construction of small water storage tanks for individual households, \nwill target the reduction of poverty among vulnerable groups, including women and ethnic \nminorities.  \n \n22.  The policy framework is conducive for implementation of the Master Plan. Relevant \ndevelopment goals and objectives are stated in the 11th Five-Year Economic Development Plan \nof the PRC, the Guizhou Province, and Guiyang Municipality, as well as in the Ministry of Water \nResources' 11th Five-Year Plan for Water Resource Utilization and Management. These plans \nfeature sustainable economic growth targets, projected increases in rural incomes, continued \nurbanization, initiatives to reduce rural poverty, agriculture and farm reforms, rural development, \nand poverty alleviation. Improved water resource management and increased efficiency in water \nusage are seen as key drivers to the achievement of these plans.  \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

Detailed analysis is in appendices 2 and 6. \n ", "6   \n23.  Under the 2002 Water Law, the responsibilities of the river basin commissions and local \nwater bureaus in respect to integrated water resources planning have been strengthened. The \nMaster Plan is an attempt to put the new responsibilities into effect, and GMG has given a clear \ncommitment  to  IWRM  and  the  reforms  needed  to  make  this  a  practical  reality.  Measures \ndemonstrating GMG\u2019s commitment to IWRM include (i) the establishment of a PLG in 2005, with \nrepresentation from all relevant water management authorities, to address cross-sectoral water \nissues; (ii) demand management initiatives being developed under the PRC\u2019s \u201cwater saving \nsociety program\u201d; (iii) the establishment of WUAs for the subprojects involving irrigation, on \nwhich the first pilot WUA was formed in Shuitian village for the water users of the irrigation \nnetwork at Qiankanjing reservoir since November 2008; (iv) participatory approaches that are \nbeing  undertaken  for  design  and  implementation  of  subprojects;  and  (v) dialogue  with  the \nGuizhou  provincial  government  to  introduce  integrated  management  of  reservoirs  on  the \nNanming River. Sustainable IWRM is a long-term process and the Project will support the first \ncritical steps to introduce the principles and get it embedded into the Government\u2019s planning \nand implementation procedures. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n24.  The Project will support an area and time slice of the Master Plan, whose achievement \nwill contribute to sustainable and inclusive socioeconomic growth in Guiyang Municipality with \ncorresponding reductions in poverty, especially in rural areas where the problem is endemic. \nThe outcome of the Project will be that water supply and demand in Guiyang Municipality are \nbalanced  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  this  outcome  through \nnonstructural and structural measures needed to address high-priority investments identified in \nthe Master Plan. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n25.  The  outputs  include  (i)  improved  water  quality;  (ii)  increased  supply  of  water  for \ndomestic,  industrial,  and  irrigation  purposes;  (iii)  improved  water  use  efficiency;  and \n(iv) improved institutional and technical capacity to manage water resources. The inputs and \nactivities designed to achieve these outputs include a range of nonstructural and structural \nmeasures for improving the management of water resources, and reducing shortages of water \nfor domestic use and irrigation. Nonstructural measures include institutional strengthening and \ncapacity  development;  stakeholder  participation  and  water  tariff  adjustments;  integrated \ninformation management system; hydroglogic monitoring center; construction of reservoirs and \nwater supply schemes; and the upgrading of agricultural irrigation systems, soil and water \nconservation, and rainwater collection and storage structures. These measures will significantly \nimprove water services in Guiyang Municipality. \n \n26.  The implementation of a TA for IWRM reform12 commenced in April 2007. The TA \nsupports  the  introduction  of  the  IWRM  approach  and  the  enhancement  of  the  enabling \ninstitutional environment. To date, the TA achieved the following: (i) Qingzhen City, one of the \ncities in the project area, has successfully institutionalized IWRM in water sector management \nby establishing a city water authority. All of the water-related management functions became the \nmandates of this newly-established city water authority, which should significantly improve the \ncity's fragmented water management; (ii) Guiyang Municipality was selected by the Ministry of \n                                                 \n12 ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Strengthening  Water  Resources \nManagement in Guiyang. Manila (TA 4912-PRC). The TA is designed to support the IWRM capacity building and \nassist in implementation of the lending project. It is expected to be completed by February 2010.  ", "  7 \nWater Resources as a potential candidate municipality to pilot test the \u201cwater-saving society \nprogram,\u201d which aims to promote water demand management nationwide; and (iii) the IWRM \nstrategy and action plan (Supplementary Appendix S), based on the findings of the TA interim \nreport, was discussed and agreed with GMG. \n \n27.  Five key infrastructure development activities are to be financed with the ADB loan: \n \n(i)  Urban water supply. The establishment of one medium-sized reservoir and two \nsmall reservoirs,13 including the construction of dams, water conveyance tunnels, \ntransmission  pipelines,  one  water  treatment  plant,  and  the  extension  of  the \nmunicipal water distribution networks. \n(ii)  Rural water supply and irrigation. The construction of up to 43 small reservoirs, \nincluding about three for county water supply, 20 for water supply and irrigation \nat the township level, and 20 for human and livestock water supply and small \nirrigation  systems.  Many  of  these  include  investments  in  water  conveyance \nsystems, small township water treatment facilities, and irrigation systems.  \n(iii)  Irrigation  system  rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  up  to  nine \nirrigation systems covering a total area of 195,447 mu (13,030 hectares [ha]), \nincluding installation or repair of intake structures, canals, and aqueducts. \n(iv)  Soil  and  water  conservation.  Farmland  restructuring,  conversion  of  sloping \nfarmland to terrace and tree or grass planting, and fruit tree planting, to protect \nthe upper catchments of the water sources (about 800 square kilometers [km2]) \nfrom soil and water losses.   \n(v)  Small  water  storage  structures.  The  provision  of  up  to  105,100  small  water \nstorage tanks in rural areas to catch spring water for human consumption, and \nrainwater for irrigation and livestock consumption. \n \n28.  Following the sector lending modality, six core subprojects representing the five main \ntypes  of  infrastructure  development  activities  were  appraised  and  confirmed  as  potentially \nsuitable for ADB financing. Except for the Yudongxia reservoir, which is the only medium-sized \nreservoir to be supported under the Project, these are meant to serve as representative models \nfor the design and implementation of similar noncore subprojects to be financed under the \nProject. The six core subprojects are the Yudongxia reservoir and water treatment subproject \nfor urban water supply, the Jinlong and Liaojiuzhai reservoir subprojects for rural water supply \nand  irrigation,  the  Wudang  irrigation  rehabilitation  subproject,  the  Huaxi  soil  and  water \nconservation subproject, and the Xifeng County small water storage tanks subproject. The main \nfeatures of these six core subprojects are presented in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Core Subprojects \n        Estimated \nCost   \nSegment/Subproject Name  Location  Features \n(CNY million) \nA.

The Project and the TA for Strengthening Water Resources Management in Guiyang \n(footnote 12) will strengthen water resources management in Guiyang Municipality by creating \nan enabling environment for IWRM, addressing institutional and capacity weaknesses, and \nimproving skills in administering and implementing the Project through provision of consulting \nservices  and  various  training  programs.  The  Project  will  (i)  support  institutional  reform  for \nimplementing IWRM; (ii) improve coordination and awareness among relevant agencies; (iii) \nestablish up to 46 WUAs14 for subprojects that include irrigation development or rehabilitation \nactivities; (iv) improve mechanisms for stakeholder participation in water management, project \npreparation, and implementation; (v) facilitate water tariff adjustments; and (vi) enhance staff \nskills in water management and project administration.  \n \n30.  The Project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.15 ADB is now moving from Water \nfor All and IWRM to the concept of water security, for which ADB will help DMCs address five \nkey dimensions: (i) satisfy household water security in all communities; (ii) support productive \neconomies in agriculture and industry; (iii) develop vibrant, livable cities and towns; (iv) restore \nhealthy rivers and ecosystems; and (v) build resilient communities that can adapt to climate \nchange. Generally, these dimensions have been incorporated in the project design.     \n \nD.  Special Features \n \n31.  Integrated water resources management. The Project is the first large IWRM project \nbeing considered for investment at the city/municipality level in the PRC. GMG recognizes the \nneed for shifting toward IWRM, and has given a commitment to develop solutions based on \nIWRM  principles.  The  IWRM  strategy  and  action  plan,  based  on  the  findings  of  TA  for \nStrengthening Water Resources Management in Guiyang, was discussed and agreed with GMG. \nThe key TA activities under implementation include the following: (i) establishing an effective \n                                                 \n14 One pilot WUA has been formed and operated in Shuitian village for the water users of the irrigation network at the \nQiankanjing  reservoir  since  November  2008.  The  implementation  follows  the  action  plan  for  the  WUAs \ndevelopment  prepared  during  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  The  WUA  consists  of  elected \nrepresentatives from each village. \n15 ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy for ADB. Manila. ", "  9 \nwater sector management structure, (ii) shifting the current supply management to demand \nmanagement,  (iii) promoting  participation  in  water  resources  management,  (iv)  improving \ninformation management and sharing, and (v) building the capacity to manage the water in \nGuiyang Municipality. The plan will be implemented in conjunction with the Project from 2010 to \n2016. \n \n32.  Practical  environmental  categorization  approach  for  reservoir  subprojects. \nReservoir  projects  are  usually  categorized  for  environmental  sensitivity  based  on  physical \ncriteria such as dam height, reservoir storage volume, or generation capacity.16 These criteria \ncan  be  indiscriminate  and  therefore  assign  resources  to  environmental  assessment  efforts \ninefficiently. Unless an alternative approach to categorization is introduced, this would be the \ncase for the Project, which will construct more than 40 small reservoirs with heights over \n15 meters (m) on the mountainous watershed, even though they will possess relatively low-\ncapacity  reservoirs.  While  ADB  does  not  hold  fixed  rules  regarding  physical  criteria  and \nenvironmental  categorization,  the  Government  using  its  own  physical  criteria  by  reservoir \ncapacity  will  categorize  only  one  of  them  a  category  A  subproject  that  requires  full \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  preparation.  The  Project  introduces  a  practical \ncategorization  approach  for  reservoir  subprojects  based  on  their  environmental  effects \n(i.e., impacts of downstream flows, groundwater, protected areas, etc.) rather than their physical \ncharacteristics, particularly dam height and reservoir volume. The benefits of following this \napproach to environmental categorization of reservoir subprojects are (i) terms of reference for \nenvironmental assessments that are better tailored to the needs of each subproject, (ii) closer \nalignment  of  procedures  for  environmental  categorization  of  reservoir  subprojects, \n(iii) strengthened cooperation between responsible authorities and transparency of procedures, \nand (iv) more efficient application of scarce resources through optimization of efforts required to \nconduct  environmental  categorization  of  reservoir  subprojects.  The  detailed  categorization \ncriteria and screening process are in Appendix 8. \n \n33.  Payment  for  environmental  service  mechanism  in  water  supply  reservoir \nsubprojects. The Project also includes the introduction of payment for environmental service \n(PES) scheme to encourage pollution reduction in the environmental protection zone of water \nsupply reservoir subprojects, particularly the Yudongxia subproject. The concept of PES will pay \nclose attention to (i) balancing the demand side\u2014their affordability and willingness to pay\u2014and \nthe supply side\u2014costs of maintaining a certain level of water quality and opportunity costs (such \nas  forgone  development  benefits),  (ii)  ensuring  financial  sustainability  by  minimizing  the \nGovernment\u2019s subsidies, and (iii) introducing result-based compensation. First, a scheme will be \nestablished to provide direct payments from water tariff collection in GMG or the operating entity \nfor compensating the upstream Government for (i) restricted development and land use (i.e., \nopportunity  costs);  or  (ii) actual  water  quality  improvements  of  the  inflow  to  the  reservoir. \nSecond, it would be necessary to establish more direct payments or financial support to those \nstakeholders that engage more actively in environmental improvement activities. The most likely \noptions for introducing such PES mechanisms would be the extension of the pollution reduction \nactivities in the communities in the near vicinity of the reservoir area, e.g., the introduction of \norganic farming, promotion of biogas digesters, and interception of sanitation wastewater. \n \n \n                                                 \n16 There  is  a  difference  between  international  financing  institution  practices  and  the  PRC  country  system. \nInternational financing institution pay more attention to dam safety by emphasizing dam height, while the PRC \ncountry system focuses more on dam capacity because dam safety is addressed separately in this system. \n ", "10  \nE.

Financing Plan \n \n35.  The Government has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n17 The taxes and duties, specifically for categories to be financed 100% from counterpart resources. ", "  11 \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions; and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision,  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n36.  The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  3.  The  balance  of  costs  will  be  financed  by  GMG, \ndomestic borrowing, and beneficiary labor contributions.18 GMG will finance land acquisition and \nresettlement  costs,  and  the  financial  charges  on  the  ADB  loan.  The  Guiyang  Municipal \nCommercial Bank will provide loan financing of $20 million equivalent with a 15-year term \nincluding a 3-year grace period and interest rate set in accordance with the PRC\u2019s current \nlending rate. A facility will be arranged by GMG to capitalize the financial charges on the \ncommercial  bank  loan.  The  Government  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  to  the \nGuizhou provincial government which will onlend the proceeds of the loan to GMG under the \nsame terms and conditions as the original loan. As the end borrower, GMG will bear any interest \nand foreign exchange variation risks, and be responsible for repayment of the loan. Appendix 5 \nillustrates the flow of funds and onlending and repayment arrangements. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n \nTotal   \nSource \n($ million)    % \nAsian Development Bank  150.0    34.2 \nGuiyang Municipal Government  258.0    58.7 \nGuiyang Municipal Commercial Bank  20.0    4.5 \nBeneficiaries  11.2    2.6 \n  Total    439.2    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n37.  GMG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  responsible  for  overall  project  planning, \nmanagement, and implementation. The PLG, headed by a vice mayor, has been established to \noversee preparation and implementation of the Project. The PLG comprises representatives \nfrom  the  Municipal  Financial  Bureau,  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Construction \nBureau, WRB, Environmental Protection Bureau, Land Resources Bureau, Poverty Reduction \nOffice, Resettlement Office, and Bureau of Ethnic Minority and Religious Affairs of GMG. \n \n38.  Under  the  PLG,  the  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  been  established  to \ncoordinate project implementation work through the various design institutes and implementing \nagencies  (IAs) 19 responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  arrangements.  The  PMO  is \nresponsible for supervising project preparation activities, monitoring resettlement, managing \nenvironmental  impacts,  monitoring  project  progress  and  project  impacts,  and  assisting \nparticipating  districts  and  counties  in  implementing  their  subprojects.  The  PMO  is  staffed \nprimarily from Guiyang Municipal WRB, but also with representatives of the Guiyang Finance \nBureau, Development and Reform Commission, Resettlement Office, Environmental Protection \n                                                 \n18 Beneficiary labor contributions will cover those activities that the farmers will undertake under the soil and water \nconservation and small water storage structures.  \n19 These IAs include the governments of Huaxi district, Wudang district, Baiyun district, Nanming district, Xiaohe \ndistrict, Jinyang new district, Xiuwen county, Xifeng county, Kaiyang county, and Qingzhen city. The Guiyang \nZhushui Water Resources Development Company under municipal government will serve as the PIO for the \nYudongxia reservoir subproject. \n ", "12  \nBureau, and Land Resources Bureau of GMG. The PMO will also recruit project implementation \nconsultants, a dam construction advisory panel, and other institutions and experts to assist the \nPMO  in  project  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  PMO  has  considerable \ncapacity for project implementation, but this will be the first time it will assume responsibility for \nan ADB-funded project.  \n \n39.  Each local county and district-level government involved in the Project has set up a PLG \nand  a  project  implementing  office  (PIO)  to  coordinate  subproject  preparation  and \nimplementation within its jurisdiction. There will be 10 PLGs and PIOs (6 district, 3 county, and 1 \ncity), and corresponding IAs (usually local level WRBs) for each county. These county and \ndistrict  governments  also  have  experience  in  managing  domestic  projects  but  with  less \nexperience in the administration of projects funded by international financial institutions. The \ncounty/district WRBs will serve as IAs for their respective subprojects. The project management \narrangements are in Supplementary Appendix W.  \n \n40.  As the capacity of the institutions at lower management levels is considered weak, \ncapacity strengthening measures were identified (Appendix 6), and strengthening activities will \nbe  undertaken  early  during  project  implementation.  The  Project\u2019s  capacity  strengthening \nactivities are designed to take into account weaknesses identified by both the institutional \ncapacity analysis and the financial management assessments. Currently, capacity strengthening \nis being undertaken under the TA for strengthening water resources management in Guiyang. \n \n41.  During  project  preparation,  financial  management  assessments  were  conducted, \ncovering  implementation  arrangements,  sustainability,  and  fiduciary  risks  and  mitigation \nstrategy. Based on these financial management assessments, each IA, PIO, and local finance \nbureau will be assisted in establishing a sound and solid financial management system at the \nbeginning of project implementation, which will be in line with the Guidelines on the Financial \nGovernance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB.20 A  customized \nfinancial  management  manual  has  been  prepared,  which  incorporates  both  domestic \nregulations and ADB policies and requirements to guide the financial management operations of \nall IAs. On this basis, along with the provision that the capacity strengthening is implemented \nearly during implementation, the Project\u2019s financial management arrangements are considered \nsatisfactory.  \n \n2.  Subproject Preparation and Appraisal \n \n42.  During project preparation, in addition to the appraisal of six core subprojects, a list of \ncandidate noncore subprojects was selected as potentially suitable for ADB financing and for \nsubsequent appraisal by the EA (Appendix 7). The participating local governments and IAs will, \nwith the assistance of local design institutes and consultants, prepare a feasibility study for each \nof the noncore subprojects and submit the completed study to the PMO. The feasibility study \nreport will include an environmental assessment (in a form stipulated by the environmental \nassessment and review framework [EARF]); resettlement plan (if required); ethnic minorities \ndevelopment plan (EMDP) if required; rationale, scope and activities, technical description and \nanalysis,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  financial, \neconomic, and institutional analysis, including financial management assessment and social \ndimensions.  \n \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2002. Guidelines on the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \nManila. ", "  13 \n43.  Based on the completed feasibility study report and in consultation with the Guiyang \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, the PMO will appraise the subprojects in accordance \nwith  the  eligibility  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB  (Appendix  8).  All \nsubprojects must satisfy these criteria. The result of the appraisal will be summarized in a \nfeasibility assessment report (FAR), following the format of the FARs prepared for the core \nsubprojects. Prior ADB approval of FARs is required for (i) the first subproject in each type of \nintervention  except  for  small  water  storage  structures;  and  (ii)  the  following  specified \nsubprojects: (a) Gejiazhai reservoir, (b) Liangchahe reservoir, (c) Xiguan reservoir, (d) Xiuwen \nirrigation system rehabilitation, and (e) Wudang soil and water conservation subproject. These \nare the largest noncore subprojects with the greatest potential impact, which require closer \nscrutiny. The remaining FARs will be sent to ADB for information.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n44.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from 2010 to 2016. The preparation of \nsafeguard documents and public disclosure for core subprojects has already started. Actual \nconstruction  of  these  subprojects  is  expected  to  commence  in  the  first  year  of  project \nimplementation  and  all  core  subprojects  except  the  Yudongxia  reservoir  subproject  are \nexpected  to  be  completed  within  the  first  2  years.  Given  the  size  and  complexity  of  the \nYudongxia subproject, it is expected that 3 years will be required for its completion. Noncore \nsubprojects  will  be  implemented  in  about  four  batches  after  commencement  of  the  core \nsubprojects,21 but it is anticipated that construction for many of these will also commence during \nthe  first  3  years  of  project  implementation.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 9. ADB\u2019s successful experience with similar projects in the PRC and the basic level of \ntechnology and modest scale of the individual subprojects indicate that this schedule is realistic \nand achievable. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n45.  ADB-financed civil works, equipment, materials, and goods and services will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Major \ncontracts for equipment and materials valued at $1 million equivalent or more will be awarded \nthrough ADB\u2019s international competitive bidding procedure. Smaller packages for equipment \nand materials valued at less than $1 million equivalent will be procured following the national \ncompetitive bidding procedure in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), \nsubject  to  modifications  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$10 million equivalent or more will be carried out using international competitive bidding, while \nthose costing less than $10 million equivalent will be carried out using national competitive \nbidding. Shopping will be allowed for goods contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or less, \nand for civil works contracts valued at $200,000 or less. Small civil works contracts valued at \n$100,000 equivalent or less\u2014for subprojects involving small-scale reservoirs, irrigation system \nrehabilitation, soil and water conservation, and small water storage tanks\u2014may be carried out \non a force account basis or through community participation, whenever practicable, to ensure \nsustainability and to achieve the Project\u2019s social objectives.22 The procedures, specifications, \nand contract packaging should facilitate such participation, provided it is efficient to (i) involve \n                                                 \n21 Each noncore subproject is expected to be completed in 1\u20132 years. \n22 In the case of the small subprojects, it is only when community participation would not be practical that force \naccount would be considered as a last resort, particularly when the works are scattered in remote locations for \nwhich no local contractors express interest, and when no nongovernment organizations or community-based \norganizations can participate. If force account is to be used for the small subprojects, prior ADB approval is \nrequired.  \n ", "14  \nlocal communities and/or nongovernment organizations (NGOs), (ii) use more local knowledge \nand materials, and (iii) employ labor-intensive and other appropriate technologies. The relevant \nsections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all \nprocurement documents and contracts. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n46.  GMG  has  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  to  enable  early \ncommencement  of  civil  works  and  recruitment  of  project  implementation  consultants.  The \nGovernment has been advised that retroactive financing could only apply up to 20% of the ADB \nloan amount with respect to expenditures incurred not earlier than 12 months before the signing \nof the loan agreement. During the appraisal mission, it was identified that about $3.53 million \nequivalent would be required for retroactive financing in connection with the following items: \n(i) civil works for the Yudongxia reservoir/dam construction ($0.98 million), (ii) civil works for \nJinlong small reservoir/dam construction ($0.62 million), (iii) civil works for small water storage \ntanks ($1.18 million), (iv) civil works for irrigation system rehabilitation subprojects and rural \nwater  supply  subprojects  ($0.07  million),  (v)  civil  works  for  soil  and  water  conservation \nsubprojects  ($0.28  million),  and  (vi)  capacity  development  and  training  ($0.40  million). \nSupplementary Appendix U provides details of retroactive financing requirements. All contracts \nfor advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government \nhas also been advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n \n47.  The Project will support a total of 24 person-months of international consulting services \nand  171  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  during  the  first  4  years  of  project \nimplementation to support the PMO, local PIOs, and IAs in project implementation and capacity \ndevelopment.23 The  consultants  will  strengthen  their  project  implementation  capabilities  to \nensure that (i) the subproject IAs are able to function as effective project management units; \n(ii) noncore subprojects utilizing ADB loan finance can be appraised and approved in a timely \nmanner,  based  on  agreed  evaluation  criteria;  (iii)  the  implementation  of  water  demand \nmanagement activities will promote more efficient use of water among all categories of users; \nand (iv) social, resettlement, and environmental impacts are monitored and mitigated. Capacity \ndevelopment for IAs will be achieved through consultant inputs under the Project and TA for \nStrengthening Water Resources Management in Guiyang, hands-on training on project facilities, \ntraining in the PRC, and international training financed by the loan. This type of capacity \ndevelopment is not new to the PRC, so national experts have the knowledge to provide cost-\neffective support. However, the overall capacity development program is large and diverse, and \ninternational consultants will provide general direction to the program\u2019s content. An international \nconsulting firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nusing the quality and cost-based selection method (80:20) with full technical proposals to carry \nout the international and national consulting services. Detailed design, and engineering and \nconstruction supervision, financed with the Government\u2019s counterpart funds, will be carried out \nby qualified local design institutes recruited by the local IAs.  \n                                                 \n23 Twenty person-months of national consulting services are being used to support the following activities during the \nsecond phase of the TA for strengthening water resources management in Guiyang: (i) development of an \ninformation management system, (ii) demand management initiatives, and (iii) training for capacity building of IAs \ninvolved in the Project. ", "  15 \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n48.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained and discussed with the Government and \nGMG. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also  include  strengthening  of  the  financial \nmanagement systems of IAs such as the Guiyang Zhushui Water Resources Development \nCompany for the Yudongxia reservoir subproject. Each IA will keep accounts in accordance with \ncommercial accounting principles, and be subject to an independent external audit by suitably \nqualified auditors. Accounting will be in accordance with relevant PRC accounting standards, \nwhich are largely in accordance with internationally accepted accounting standards. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n49.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment, reimbursement, \nand commitment procedures may be used to withdraw funds from the loan account. To expedite \nthe flow of funds and simplify document processing, the statement of expenditures (SOE) \nprocedure may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual payment  not \nexceeding $200,000. Payments exceeding this ceiling will be reimbursed based on the full \ndocumentation process. \n \n50.  A project imprest account24 will be set up by the Guizhou Provincial Finance Department \n(GPFD) in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB after loan effectiveness. The initial amount to \nbe deposited into the imprest account shall not exceed the equivalent of 10% of the total loan \namount,  or  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  from  imprest  account  for  the  first \n6 months of implementation, whichever is lower. GPFD will be responsible for management, \nmonitoring, maintenance, and reconciliation of the imprest account. SOE will be used only at \nGPFD level to request withdrawals from ADB or otherwise clarify the use of SOE by IAs. \nDisbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal \napplications and related documentations. Such documentations will demonstrate, among other \nthings, that the goods/services (i) were produced in and procured from ADB members, and \n(ii) are eligible for ADB financing.  \n \n51.  To ensure that adequate loan proceeds are available on a timely basis, Guiyang Finance \nBureau (GFB) will maintain close coordination with GPFD. Measures to be taken to accelerate \ninternal review and verification for withdrawal applications include the following: (i) GPFD will \nhave  at  least  two  authorized  representatives  to  sign  withdrawal  applications;  (ii)  GFB,  the \ncounty/district  financial  bureaus,  the  PMO,  and  county/district  PIOs  will  establish  written \nprocedures with specified time frames for review and verification of withdrawal applications \nsubmitted by subprojects; and (iii) GPFD, GFB, and the local financial bureaus will release \nproject funds immediately after receiving them to avoid delay in implementation. \n \n                                                 \n24 Bank charges will be financed from the loan resources. \n ", "16  \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n52.  The  PMO,  on  behalf  of  GMG,  will  prepare  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports \nindicating  progress  made,  problems  encountered  during  the  review  period,  steps  taken  or \nproposed to remedy the problems, the proposed program of activities, and progress expected \nfor the following quarter. The PMO will ensure that these reports are submitted to ADB in a \ntimely manner. Within 3 months of the Project\u2019s physical completion, the PMO will submit to \nADB a completion report that describes (i) institutional strengthening and water sector policy \nreform;  (ii)  implementation  of  the  structural  investment  program;  (iii)  other  project \nimplementation matters; (iv) actual costs incurred in relation to cost estimates, benefits, and \nbeneficiary consultations; and (v) other information requested by ADB.  \n  \n53.  The PMO and each IA will maintain records and accounts that identify the goods and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred \nfor the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be established and maintained in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  internationally  accepted  accounting \nstandards.  The  annual  project  accounts  of  GMG  and  the  IAs  will  be  audited  by  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. Audit coverage will include a special audit of project accounts, including \nseparate opinions on (i) utilization of funds deposited in the Project\u2019s imprest account; (ii) the \nuse of the SOE procedure, including whether the amount claimed is duly supported and verified; \n(iii) whether the EA is operating the imprest account in accordance with ADB procedures; \n(iv) procurements  undertaken  through  community  participation  and  force  account;  and \n(v) compliance with financial covenants specified in the loan and project agreements. The audit \nreports, management letter, and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate, or the project closing date if \nearlier. ADB has informed the Government of its policy on the submission of audit reports, which \ncovers failure to submit audited project accounts and financial statements by the due date. A \nformal  warning  will  be  issued  for  audited  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and \ndisbursements will be suspended for audited accounts that are 12 months overdue.   \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n54.  The major project performance monitoring indicators include project progress, results of \ncapacity development, water resources management performance and related service levels, \nthe social impact of the Project, user satisfaction with water availability, quality and price, and \nrelevant  economic  and  health  data  to  monitor  project  impacts.  An  outline  of  the  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS) is in Supplementary Appendix X. \n \n55.  At the beginning of project implementation, the PMO, in consultation with the IAs and \nwith the assistance of consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to generate \ndata systematically on inputs and outputs of project activities; and the socioeconomic, health, \nand  environmental  indicators  to  measure  project  impacts.  The  PMO  will  refine  the  PPMS \nframework, confirm achievable targets, firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and \nestablish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after project inception. \n \n56.  Under the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by the IAs to the PMO, including semiannual reporting on the environmental \nmanagement  plan.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data \nthrough its management information system. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate \nflexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and \ndevelopment impacts. The PMO, with assistance from the consultants, will monitor and assess ", "  17 \nactivities, and report to ADB on a quarterly basis on the physical implementation and financial \naspects of the Project to ensure that impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB \nrequirements. Key issues and progress on social and environmental safeguard aspects will be \nbriefly  included  in  the  project  quarterly  progress  report,  and  the  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation on the resettlement and environmental ambient quality changes will be reported on a \nsemiannual basis.  \n \n57.  Project  management  arrangements  will  need  to  be  further  refined  to  take  into \nconsideration lessons on involving NGOs in project activities, in particular in assessing their \ninstitutional capacity and experience of interacting with government agencies and communities. \nTheir work will be closely monitored by the monitoring and evaluation specialist within the PMO. \nWhere NGOs will be working with resettled communities, the impact of their involvement will \nalso be captured in the monitoring of the resettlement process. In the contracts to be negotiated \nwith the NGO, their reporting requirements to ADB on the community mobilization work will be \nspecified. Project implementation consultant inputs will also be closely monitored and tied to \nspecific outputs. \n \n11.  Project Review \n \n58.  It is envisaged that ADB review missions will be undertaken twice per year, for the first \n2 years and once a year thereafter. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review \n3 years after the start of project implementation. This review will reassess in detail the likelihood \nof achieving the Project\u2019s impact, outcome, and outputs; and include a detailed evaluation of the \nscope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and \nprogress with capacity development measures. Feedback from the PPMS activities will be \nanalyzed.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Water Resources Benefits \n \n59.  The  Project  will  provide  extensive  water  resources  benefits  that  will  affect  about \n1.6 million residents of Guiyang Municipality, or about 45% of the total population. At project \ncompletion,  the  expected  benefits  include  (i)  an  increase  in  urban  water  supply  of  about \n40 million m3 per year; (ii) an increase in rural water supply of about 94.8 million m3 per year; \n(iii) improvement  in  the  existing  irrigated  area  of  about  10,773  ha  and  an  increase  in  the \nirrigated area by about 18,815 ha; (iv) increased irrigation coverage from 0.3 mu to 0.5 mu per \ncapita; (v) soil conservation treatment to an area of about 800 km2 of land at risk of erosion; and \n(vi) provision of 105,100 small water storage tanks in rural areas to catch and store spring and \nrainwater  for  drinking,  irrigation,  and  livestock.  It  is  estimated  that  about  240,000  rural \nbeneficiaries will have access to safe drinking water, and about 59,200 farmers will benefit from \nimproved irrigation services. \n \n60.  Surface  water  quality  will  be  improved  with  sewerage  interception  and  wastewater \ntreatment, industrial wastewater discharge control, nonpoint source pollution control, reservoir \ncatchment pollution protection, and soil conservation.  Most of these pollution control measures \nwill be paid by the wastewater dischargers. For activities involving reservoir catchment and \nwater protection, control and improvement costs will be included in each subproject design. \n \n61.  The policy, institutional, and IWRM-based reforms to be implemented in parallel with the \nstructural interventions will bring about improvements in (i) subproject design through increased \n ", "18  \nstakeholder  involvement,  (ii)  sustainability  of  O&M,  (iii)  resolution  of  water  conflicts, \n(iv) interagency  and  cross-sector  cooperation,  and  (v)  increased  emphasis  on  water \nconservation activities. \n \nB.  Environmental Impacts and Benefits \n \n62.  The Project\u2019s environmental impact and benefits are evaluated in general terms and \ncumulatively for the Master Plan as a whole. The environmental assessments of individual core \nsubprojects provide a more detailed assessment of environmental benefits and impacts at the \nsubproject  level.  A  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  covering  the  core \nsubprojects was categorized as environmental category A and a summary initial environmental \nexamination (SIEE) covering the remaining three core subprojects were prepared in accordance \nwith  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  assessment  technical  guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy.25 The soil and water conservation activities of the Project provide the most obvious and \ndirect environmental benefits. For the other activities, especially the construction of reservoirs, \nthere is a trade-off between development and livelihood benefits, and adverse environmental \nimpacts,  which  will  occur  while  under  construction  and  during  operation  of  the  subproject \nfacilities.  However,  each  subproject  environmental  assessment  concludes  that  the  overall \nbalance  is  favorable,  and  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  manageable  with \nappropriate mitigation measures that have been identified and incorporated in the subprojects\u2019 \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). The environmental assessment of noncore subprojects \nto be prepared and implemented under the Project will be undertaken in accordance with the \nprovisions of the EARF that have been agreed with the EA. The summary environmental \nassessment framework is in Appendix 11. \n \nC.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Poverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n \n63.  Guizhou Province is one of the poorest provinces in the PRC, with the second lowest \nrural income and the lowest level of urban income of any province. In 2008, about 4.6% of the \nmunicipality\u2019s urban population lived under the municipality\u2019s absolute poverty line for urban \nareas and about 3.9% of the rural population lived under the absolute poverty line for rural \nareas, and received conditional support from the Government. The rural population living at less \nthan CNY1,200 per person per year was estimated at 25%.26 The Project covers 71 towns and \ntownships  out  of  the  total 77  towns  and  townships  in  Guiyang  Municipality,  including \n18 \u201cpoverty\u201d towns and townships designated by Guizhou Province, five of which are designated \nclass A \u201cpoverty\u201d towns and townships with an average annual income of less than CNY785 per \nperson. The Project has specific provisions to target women and ethnic minorities, considered \nparticularly vulnerable. In Guiyang Municipality, about 430,000 people, primarily in rural areas, \nlack satisfactory domestic water supplies, with the burden of water collection falling mainly on \nwomen. The Project will provide rural households with opportunities to improve their agricultural \n                                                 \n25 The environmental impact assessment and initial environmental examination reports for individual subprojects used \nmethodologies and standards consistent with relevant guidelines established by the Ministry of Environmental \nProtection, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The individual environmental impact assessment \nand  initial  environmental  examination  reports  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  domestic \nprocedures. ADB reviewed the SEIA and posted it on the ADB website on 21 August 2006. \n26 The national line for absolute poverty in the PRC has been set at CNY1,196 for 2009, which means that 25% of the \nrural population is now considered absolutely poor and entitled to special support by the Government. This poverty \nline corresponds to the former international poverty line of $1 per day, while the new international poverty line of \n$1.25 per day\u2014adopted by ADB\u2014corresponds roughly to CNY1,600. ", "  19 \nincome by increasing the surface of irrigated land, allowing them to change from low-yield crops \nand subsistence farming to higher-value crops. The Project will also reduce non-income poverty \nby providing reliable domestic water supply to households. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12.  \n \n64.  Labor opportunities will be provided to local communities. The PMO and IAs will ensure \nthat contractors hire local labor, in particular ethnic minorities and women, for skilled and \nunskilled work as much as possible.   \n \n2.  Gender and Development \n \n65.  The  Project  will  promote  the  inclusion  of  women  during  subproject  design in WUA \nmembership  and  leadership,  and  in  other  project  activities  that  are  important  for  their \nparticipation. To achieve this, targets are set for the participation of women and the benefits \nthey will derive from the Project. Quotas of at least 30% are set aside for women in (i) project-\nfinanced training activities, (ii) job opportunities created by the Project, and (iii) participation in \npublic consultation processes for the planning of noncore subprojects. To enhance women\u2019s \nparticipation in project leadership, the All-China Women\u2019s Federation is included in the PLG at \nthe PMO (municipal) and IA (district and county) levels, and at the village level a quota is set for \nat least 30% for women\u2019s participation in WUAs. In the small-scale water tank subcomponent, a \nquota of at least 30% will target poor women and households headed by women. In addition, \nthe Project\u2019s emphasis on active participation in community-managed infrastructure will present \nwomen with new opportunities and challenges that will further change the traditional division of \ngender roles in local communities and require targeted training and skills transfer interventions. \nThe Project will also provide gender-awareness training to project management staff to promote \nwomen\u2019s participation in key areas. The monitoring of gender-disaggregated data and gender-\nspecific indicators is part of monitoring and evaluation of project impacts. The gender action \nplan (GAP) is in Appendix 13.   \n \n3.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n66.  Resettlement impacts were assessed in detail for the six core subprojects, and the \nselected noncore subprojects were screened for potential impacts, of which 48 subprojects may \ninvolve land acquisition and resettlement. For the entire Project, it is estimated that about \n6,300 persons will be affected by land loss; and about 12,800 mu of land will be acquired for the \nProject, of which about 5,900 mu (46%) is cultivated land. The houses of about 1,200 persons \nwill have to be relocated. For the core subprojects, the resettlement impacts are relatively small \nexcept for the Yudongxia reservoir subproject. The Guiyang PMO has prepared and ADB has \napproved the resettlement plan for the Yudongxia subproject and three resettlement plans for \nthe Jinlong, Liaojiuzhai, and Wudang subprojects. No resettlement plans are required for the \nother two core subprojects, as these do not involve land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. \nBased  on  satisfactory  resettlement  experience  in  Guizhou  Province,  the  EA  and  local \ngovernments were assessed to have the capacity to manage resettlement impacts properly. \nThe IAs will fund the resettlement costs according to the standards set out in the resettlement \nplans, based on national policies and local regulations. Entitlements will be provided to affected \npersons before demolition and ground leveling commence, and before any loss of land. A \nresettlement information booklet was distributed to those affected through village offices, and \nthe resettlement plans for the four core subprojects were made available at the village offices. \nThe summary resettlement plan and framework is in Appendix 14.  \n \n ", "20  \n67.  Compensation for land acquisition, residential housing, and nonresidential housing will \nbe paid to all users regardless of whether titled or not. For land acquisition, compensation \nincludes land compensation, resettlement subsidy, and compensation for young crops. The land \ncompensation will be paid to the affected village and/or affected persons and the resettlement \nsubsidy and other compensation for individual asset loss will be paid to the affected persons. \nFor small businesses and housing demolition, compensation will be paid directly to owners in \ncash according to the appraised value of the land and fixed property assets. Income losses \nresulting from reduced production/sales and wages caused by the Project will be assessed and \ncompensated to affected persons in cash. \n \n68.  For subsequent noncore subprojects, resettlement plans will be prepared based on the \ndetailed  engineering  designs  and  resettlement  impact  surveys.  A  resettlement  framework \nproviding procedural guidelines for the EA and IAs to follow has been agreed upon between \nGMG and ADB. The PMO, assisted by the IAs, will be responsible for monitoring resettlement \nplan implementation and submitting progress reports to ADB. A regular reporting system will be \nestablished to ensure that key resettlement activities are implemented on schedule. The PMO \nwill also engage a domestic institute to conduct independent monitoring and evaluation of \nresettlement implementation and report progress semi-annually, to evaluate results through \nannual survey updates and reports for 2 years after completion of resettlement. Monitoring and \nevaluation reports will be submitted to Guiyang PMO and ADB for review and follow up action, if \nrequired. \n \n4.  Ethnic Minorities \n \n69.  EMDPs have been prepared for four of the core subprojects. About 200 ethnic minority \npersons in each of these four subprojects will have their livelihoods affected by the Project, \nalthough the overall impact of the Project will be beneficial to the ethnic minority communities as \na  result  of  improved  water  supplies  and  consequential  livelihood  benefits.  Ethnic  minority \nvillages will be specifically targeted for the provision of small water storage tanks, and special \nprovisions will be made in resettlement plans, where construction activity has a serious impact \non ethnic minority communities. An ethnic minorities development framework (EMDF) for the \nsubsequent noncore subprojects has also been prepared. The PMO, assisted by the IAs, will be \nresponsible for preparing the EMDPs for the noncore subprojects, as required, and monitoring \nthe implementation of all EMDPs. The summary EMDF is in Supplementary Appendix Y. \n \nD.  Policy and Institutional Benefits \n \n70.  The capacity development activities under the Project and the continued policy dialogue \nwith the municipal government during its implementation, as well as under the TA 4912-PRC, \nwill support institutional and IWRM reforms that will facilitate the achievement of the overall \ndevelopment goal for the Project. The Project will not only improve water services but also \nfacilitate the introduction of IWRM. It will help implement a subset of the measures identified in \nthe Master Plan that are mainly structural but clearly linked to identified water management \nproblems and overall economic development goals of GMG. Nonstructural measures will be \nsupported under both the Project and TA, and mainly comprise capacity development activities \nto promote the use of IWRM; support the introduction of related institutional reforms; and \nestablish participatory approaches for the design and management of water projects, water \nallocations, and water sector planning. \n \n ", "  21 \nE.  Economic Analysis \n \n71.  The economic analysis covers both the Project as a whole and the core subprojects. For \nthe Project, the analysis covers the economic rationale for government involvement, goals of the \nsector development plan, and the design of the sector development plan. The rationale is \nsound, based on the sector analysis that has been performed in a manner consistent with ADB \nrequirements.27 A summary of the sector economic analysis is in Appendix 15. \n \n72.  Least-cost  analysis  based  largely  on  technical  evaluations  and  investment  cost \ncomparisons has been performed and is considered acceptable since the alternatives that are \nconsidered  involve  familiar  technologies  and  provide  similar  levels  of  benefit.  Economic \nanalyses were undertaken to determine subprojects\u2019 economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) \nin accordance with ADB guidelines.28 Alternative cropping patterns were modeled for both rain-\nfed and irrigated systems based on crop production data obtained from a survey of 300 rural \nhouseholds distributed across the irrigation subproject areas. All of the core subprojects, except \nthe Liaojiuzhai reservoir subproject, have EIRR values equal to or greater than 12%. For the \nLiaojiuzhai  reservoir  subproject,  the  EIRR  equals  10%  and  it  is  believed  that  there  are \nadequate, non-quantifiable benefits of at least 2% that allow the subproject\u2019s EIRR to surpass \nthe 12% threshold. For economic viability, subproject selection criteria (Appendix 8) for noncore \nsubprojects were devised to ensure that those with lower prospects of economic viability are \nexcluded from consideration for financing under the Project. \n \nF.  Financial Analysis \n \n73.  The financial evaluation of the core subprojects was undertaken in real terms using \nconstant 2009 prices. Financial projections were made at the subproject level involving urban \nwater  supply,  rural  domestic  water  supply,  and  irrigation.  The  project  cost  estimates  and \nfinancial projections in nominal terms after tax were converted to real terms by adjusting for \nforeign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. The estimated financial internal rates of \nreturn  exceed  the  after-tax  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  for  the  revenue-generating \nsubprojects, and sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the financial internal rates of return \nare robust under adverse conditions.  \n \n74.  Financial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  Guiyang  Zhushui  Water  Resources \nDevelopment Company, Guiyang water supply company (WSC), Wudang WSC, Xiuwen County \nWSC, Jinlong reservoir subproject, Liaojiuzhai reservoir subproject, and the Wudang irrigation \nrehabilitation subproject in accordance with the Guidelines on the Financial Governance and \nManagement of Investment Projects Financed by ADB (footnote 20). The projected financial \nstatements indicate that revenues will be sufficient to finance O&M costs and debt service \ncoverage, and provide reasonable rates of return in all cases except the Jinlong reservoir and \nthe Liaojiuzhai reservoir subprojects. Based on the financial projections, these entities generally \nmeet the accepted target values with respect to the minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1:4, \na maximum debt\u2013equity ratio of 70:30, and a minimum current ratio of 1:0. All subprojects \nexcept Liaojiuzhai and Jinlong are therefore considered financially acceptable and sustainable. \nThe  Liaojiuzhai  reservoir  subproject  will  require  a  small  ongoing  subsidy  to  be  financially \nsustainable. The Jinlong reservoir subproject, while financially viable, will experience some \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2005.

Discussion on the tariff issue is \nsummarized in Appendix 15.    \n \n75.  The assessment of willingness to pay based on households for urban and rural domestic \nwater supplies and of net income from improved crop production indicates that beneficiaries \nwould accept proposed tariff increases. Willingness to pay is estimated at about CNY4 per m3 \nfor domestic use. Expenditure shares are calculated before accounting for the water bill waiver \nfor registered poor households, and in all cases, with-project water supply costs constitute less \nthan 5% of household expenditure. \n \nG.  Risks \n \n76.  The Project has several potential environmental, institutional, financial, and policy risks \nrelated to (i) drought and excessive climate variation, (ii) rural to urban migration exceeding \nforecasts, (iii) unforeseen physical conditions that could affect construction costs and schedules, \nand (iv) resistance to water tariff reforms. Important assumptions include the following: (i) the \nGovernment\u2019s  program  for  sustainable  development  is  continued;  (ii)  effective  agriculture \nextension  support  is  provided  to  farmers;  (iii)  a  participatory  approach  to  water  resources \nmanagement is continued to be adopted; (iv) incentives for effective interagency coordination \nare introduced; (v) financing is identified for other activities in the Master Plan; (vi) community \nsupport, including through the establishment of WUAs, can be enlisted to help construct and \nmaintain rural water infrastructure; and (vii) mitigation measures to protect water quality are  \nundertaken by neighboring administrative jurisdictions.   \n \n77.  The  Project  includes  measures  to  mitigate  these  risks  and  verify  assumptions  that \ninclude (i) extensive stakeholder consultation during the design of subprojects; (ii) regular tariff \nreviews and adjustments by the Government following national guidelines as well as public \nawareness  programs;  (iii)  an  examination  of  the  GMG  budget  to  assess  availability  of \ncounterpart funding; (iv) formal commitment from GMG to introduce IWRM-based reforms; and \n(v) implementation of training, capacity development, and community support programs.  ADB \nreview missions will monitor compliance with the financial and operational covenants to ensure \nfinancial sustainability of the water utility companies. Experienced national and international \nconsultants  will  provide  advice  and  support  to  mitigate  specific  construction  and  other \nimplementation risks.  \n \nH.  Overall Assessment \n \n78.  The Project is critical to keeping Guiyang Municipality\u2019s water supply and demand in \nbalance  to  facilitate  continued  and  sustainable  economic  growth,  which  is  the  overall \ndevelopment goal of GMG. Analysis during project preparation suggests that the economic \nviability of the subprojects that augment urban and rural household water supplies are easy to \ndemonstrate, but the economic justification of the subprojects providing mainly irrigation water \nhas a more marginal economic justification. In overall terms, collective project benefits outweigh \ncosts in both financial and social terms. The implementation of resettlement plans in accordance \nwith PRC and ADB policies will protect persons adversely affected by the Project, and the \napplication of PRC and ADB environmental safeguards will minimize adverse environmental \nimpacts.  \n ", "  23 \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n   \n79.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and GMG have given the \nfollowing specific assurances, which have been incorporated in the draft legal documents: \n \n1.  Integrated Water Resources Management \n(i)  GMG  will  ensure  that  the  principles  of  IWRM  under  the  Master  Plan  and \ndeveloped under the TA for Strengthening Water Resources Management in \nGuiyang are carried out under the Project. In particular, GMG will ensure that the \nIWRM strategic action plan agreed between GMG and ADB (Supplementary \nAppendix S) is implemented in a timely manner. Key activities to be implemented \nwill include (a) establishment of an effective water sector management structure, \n(b)  shift  from  the  current  supply  management  to  demand  management,  (c) \ngreater public participation in water resources management, (d) improvement in \ninformation management and sharing among relevant agencies, and (e) capacity \nbuilding in water management in Guiyang Municipality.  \n(ii)  GMG  will  ensure  that  the  subproject  selection  criteria  and  implementation \nprocedures (including prior ADB approval requirements) agreed upon with ADB \nare followed, including environmental and social safeguard requirements under \nthe EARF, EMP, resettlement framework, and EMDF.  \n(iii)  Within 3 months of the loan effectiveness date, GMG will appoint a dam safety \npanel of eminent national engineers, which will review the detailed design of \nproposed  subprojects  involving  the  construction  of  dams,  oversee  dam \nconstruction, and confirm to ADB that the design and construction of the dams \nmeet international safety standards. \n(iv)  GMG  will  itself  cause  the  finance  and  price  bureaus  of  each  local  county \nparticipating in the Project, to undertake annual reviews of water tariffs, and to \nestablish  tariffs  based  on  financial  and  economic  objectives  (including  the \nfinancial sustainability of water services, and the use of price as a water demand \nmanagement  tool  where  appropriate),  subject  to  compliance  with  laws  and \nregulations in the PRC. In the event the tariff is not set at a level allowing for \nfinancial viability and sustainability of a subproject, GMG will ensure that the \ncounty governments will provide the necessary subsidy. For urban water supply, \ntariffs will be established, and if necessary, adjusted to ensure full repayment of \nO&M, interest charges, the greater of depreciation or debt repayment, and a \nreasonable profit margin. \n(v)  GMG will ensure that each local county government (through its poverty bureau): \n(a) reviews the impact of increased water and wastewater tariffs on the poor, and \nin urban areas; and (b) maintains the provision of the water tariff waiver under \nminimum living standard scheme to protect the basic living standard of the poor.  \n(vi)  GMG will ensure that WUAs are established in a timely manner for all reservoir \nand irrigation core and noncore subprojects.  \n \n2.  Social Safeguards \n \n(i)  GMG, through the relevant local governments and IAs, will ensure that (a) all \nland and rights-of-way required by the Project are made available in a timely \nmanner; (b) the resettlement framework and resettlement plans are implemented \n ", "24  \npromptly in accordance with their terms, all applicable PRC laws and regulations, \nand ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995); (c) all affected persons are \ngiven  adequate  opportunity  to  participate  in  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation; (d) counterpart funds are provided on a timely basis for land \nacquisition and resettlement activities; (e) any financial obligations in excess of \nthe  resettlement  plan  budget  estimates  are  met;  and  (f)  compensation  and \nresettlement assistance are given to the affected persons prior to dispossession \nand displacement to ensure that those affected will be at least as well off as they \nwould have been in the absence of the Project.  \n(ii)  GMG, through the local level PIOs, will ensure that (a) the resettlement plans \nprepared  for  the  core  subprojects  are  updated  based  on  detailed  designs, \ndisclosed to the affected persons and resubmitted to ADB for concurrence prior \nto commencement of civil works; (b) resettlement plans for noncore subprojects \nare prepared in accordance with the resettlement framework based on detailed \ndesign, disclosed to affected persons, and submitted to ADB for approval prior to \ncommencement of civil works; and (c) ADB is advised of any significant material \nchanges in project scope or other causes and this is reflected in an updated \nresettlement plan to be submitted to ADB for its approval. With respect to any \nupdated resettlement plans, GMG will disclose such updated resettlement plans \nto affected persons prior to ADB approval. \n(iii)  GMG,  through  the  Guiyang  PMO,  will  ensure  that  (a)  adequate  staff  and \nresources are committed to resettlement monitoring and supervision, and ADB is \nprovided with quarterly reports on implementation, and a resettlement completion \nreport for all the reservoir subprojects; (b) an independent agency acceptable to \nADB is engaged to monitor and report progress semiannually, and to evaluate \nresults through annual survey updates and reports for 2 years after completion of \nresettlement;  (c)  external  monitoring  reports  are  submitted  to  ADB  and  the \nGuiyang  PMO  for  review  and  comments;  and  (d)  a  summary  of  the  final \nresettlement audit for the Yudongxia reservoir subproject is provided to ADB.  \n(iv)  GMG will ensure that the GAP is implemented in a timely manner over the entire \nproject  period,  and  that  adequate  resources  are  allocated  for  this  purpose. \nImplementation  of  the  GAP  will  be  closely  monitored,  and  progress  will  be \nreported in the quarterly progress reports submitted to ADB. \n \n3.  Environment Management \n(i)  For those water supply dam subprojects, particularly the Yudongxia dam, GMG \nwill ensure an appropriate classification of environmental protection zone and \ndetermine and stipulate related regulations for preserving water quality of the \nrespective reservoir. Such regulations may include land use zoning and control of \nchemical  fertilizers/pesticides  use,  wastewater  discharge,  and  aquaculture \ndevelopment  in  the  environmental  protection  zone  area.  To  ensure  the \npreservation  of  the income  and  livelihood  of  local  communities  that  may  be \naffected  by  such  regulations,  GMG  will  ensure  that  a  PES  mechanism  to \nmaintain the agreed level of water quality by providing sufficient compensation to \nupstream government and affected communities is established and implemented. \n(ii)  GMG  will  cause  each  local  government  and  the  IAs  to  construct,  operate, \nmaintain,  and  monitor  the  project  facilities  in  strict  conformity  with  (a)  all \napplicable laws and regulations, including national and local regulations and \nstandards for environmental protection, health, labor, and occupational safety; \nand  (b)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  the  environmental  mitigation  and ", "  25 \nmonitoring  measures  detailed  in  the  approved  EIAs,  initial  environment \nexaminations, SEIA, SIEE, and EMP for the Project. \n \n4.  Others \n \n(i)  The PMO, in consultation with the IAs, will prepare and submit to ADB for review \nand concurrence, a training plan for informing (e.g., on IWRM principles such as \nwater sharing) and empowering local communities to be implemented under the \nProject.  \n(ii)  GMG will ensure that proper financial management systems are established and \nimplemented  by  the  IAs  in  accordance  with  domestic  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects,  and  the \ncustomized  financial  management  manual  prepared  for  the  Project,  and \nincorporating domestic regulations and ADB policies and requirements. \n \nVI.

Macroeconomic Context \n \n1.  Guizhou Province is one of the poorest provinces in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), with the second lowest rural income, and the lowest level of urban income of any \nprovince. The capital of the province, Guiyang Municipality, is its political, economic, cultural, \ntechnical, and service center, and a major transportation hub of southwest PRC. In 2008, \nGuiyang Municipality has an estimated population of about 3.6 million, of which about 2.4 million \nreside in the main urban area, with the remaining 1.2 million in suburban or rural areas. About \n574,000 people (16% of the total population) are ethnic minorities who mainly reside in the rural \nareas. The income disparity between the rural and urban population is high and about 25% of \nthe rural population lives on an income of less than CNY1,200 ($176) per capita per year. Like \nmany other areas in the PRC, Guiyang Municipality is undergoing rapid urbanization with the \nurban population increasing at over 3% per annum, while the rural population is decreasing at \nan annual rate of 1.6%\u2014a trend that is likely to continue. \n \n2.  Guiyang Municipality is one of the PRC\u2019s major producers of nonferrous metals and \ntobacco; and major industries include machinery, steel making, food processing, and chemicals. \nThe total gross domestic product of Guiyang Municipality in 2008 was equivalent to about \nCNY81.1 billion, of which the tertiary (service) sector accounted for 46.69%, the secondary \n(manufacturing) sector for about 47%, and the primary (mining and agriculture) sector for about \n6%. However, the primary sector is much more important in terms of employment, accounting \nfor 34% of recorded employment in Guiyang Municipality.  \n \nB.  Water Resources System in Guiyang Municipality \n3.  In the context of integrated water resources management (IWRM), the water resources \nsystem (WRS) comprises (i) the natural resources system\u2014the natural resources and related \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  the  socioeconomic  system\u2014the  water-using  and  water-related  human \nactivities; and (iii) the administrative and institutional system\u2014the system of administration, \nlegislation, and regulation, including the authorities responsible for the management of the WRS \nand the implementation of laws and regulations.1 Major problems and constraints in the context \nof IWRM in Guiyang Municipality, and the cause\u2013effect relationship are provided in a problem \ntree in Supplementary Appendix V. \n \n4.  Natural resources system of WRS in Guiyang Municipality. Both urban and rural \nareas  of  Guiyang  Municipality  are  on  the  mountainous  ridge  of  the  watershed  boundary \nbetween the Yangtze River basin to the north, which drains about 95% of the area, and the \nPearl River basin to the south. Annual average precipitation is quite high at 1,096 millimeters, \nbut large evaporative losses and uneven distribution present particular challenges for capturing \nand storing water. The total annual renewable freshwater supply is estimated at 8.8 billion cubic \nmeters (m3), almost half of which evaporates because of the poor vegetative cover and rocky \nterrain of the catchment areas. The remaining water drains into rivers (4.5 billion m3 or 51% of \n                                                 \n1  This definition of WRS covers the aspects that are essential for natural resources management: demand, supply, \nand control of the resources. The natural resources system refers to the supply side of the system (resource base) \nand the socioeconomic system to the demand side. The control of both sides is provided by the administrative and \ninstitutional system (AIS). The external natural boundaries of the natural resources system usually consist of the \nwater that divides the catchment area, boundaries of the groundwater aquifer(s) belonging to this catchment area \nand the point where the river or canal discharges into the sea. The geographical boundaries of the socioeconomic \nsystem and the AIS vary depending on what part of the socioeconomic system is considered essential for \nmanaging and assessing the impacts of the WRS. \n ", "Appendix 2  29\ntotal precipitation) as quick surface flows through numerous short creeks and streams that run \ndeep in valleys, or through fast-flowing deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) through the limestone \nlayers (karst areas). Local surface and underground water resources average 1,300 m3 per \ncapita. This compares poorly with the PRC average of 1,700 m3 per capita. To illustrate these \nchallenges: (i) 85% falls from May to September; (ii) only 4.5% falls from December to February; \n(iii) annual fluctuations with a 100% difference (i.e., a 1:2 ratio) between a low rainfall year and a \nhigh rainfall year; and (iv) northern Guiyang Municipality only receives 60% of the amount of \nrain that falls in the south. \n \n5.  Socioeconomic system of WRS in Guiyang Municipality. As the economic hub of the \nprovince, Guiyang Municipality has a rapidly increasing population and industrial development, \nand hence increasing demand for water. Servicing this population and related municipal and \nindustrial  water  demands  is  putting  a  severe  strain  on  the  existing  water  supply  facilities. \nUrbanization  in  Guiyang  Municipality  means  increased  water  demand  for  household, \ncommercial, and industrial use. Water quality in local rivers and water sources is also a growing \nconcern.  \n \n6.  The Guiyang Municipality urban water supply infrastructure is old and in poor condition, \nwater pressures are declining, and the supply is rationed in dry periods. Industrial recycling fails \nto meet the PRC targets of 75% and nonrevenue water is believed to be high, probably over \n30% on average. Increased urbanization is generating increased volumes of wastewater and \ncurrently only about 10% is treated. \n \n7.  In rural areas of Guiyang Municipality, only 50% of homes have piped water supply. In \nthe absence of public water supply systems, the majority of the rural population relies on local \nsprings  and  streams,  although  some  have  small  storage  structures  near  their  homes  for \ndomestic and livestock use. About 420,000 rural residents face potable water shortages. Most \nrural water is needed for agricultural purposes (domestic requirements only account for about \n10%). However, the steep mountainous terrain makes it is very difficult for farmers to obtain \nriver water or groundwater for irrigation, particularly at higher elevations.  \n \n8.  About 10% of Guiyang Municipality land area is arable, only 24% of this land has \npotential  access  to  irrigation,  and  only  50%  of  cultivated  land  is  irrigated.  Consequently, \nirrigation coverage is currently only 0.3 mu per capita, lower than the national average of 0.8 mu \nper capita. It is estimated that production from the 50% of the cultivated area that is irrigated \nsupplies 70% of production. Surface irrigation systems account for 99% of the irrigation area. \nUp  to  40%  of  these  structures  have  been  abandoned,  and  28.8  kilometers  of  canals  are \ndamaged. Water conveyance efficiency in larger irrigation schemes is estimated to average \n40% and on-farm application efficiency about 90%, implying scheme level efficiencies of no \nmore than 40%. With rehabilitation, conveyance efficiencies of 74% and on-farm application \nefficiencies of 95% are expected (scheme level 70%). Nonpoint source pollution from agriculture \nand rural point source pollution from livestock rearing are significant threats to water quality. Soil \nerosion  is estimated  to  affect  about  2,600 square  kilometers  of  Guiyang  Municipality,  and \nwatershed management is urgently needed to conserve soil and protect water sources. \n \n9.  Administrative and institutional system of WRS in Guiyang Municipality. In recent \nyears, the PRC has recognized the need to improve the comprehensive management of water \nresources, applying approaches consistent with IWRM methodologies, and to shift the emphasis \nmore  toward  managing  demand,  including  the  use  of  economic  mechanisms.  A  crucial \nmilestone along this path was reached on 1 October 2002, when the revised Water Law was \nmade effective, and in which added emphasis is given to such issues as water resources \nplanning, protection of water resources, the economical use of water, the resolution of disputes \n ", "30         Appendix 2 \nconcerning water, and the enforcement of water use regulations\u2014all of which are common \nwater resources management concerns. \n \n10.  The case for solutions based on the principles of IWRM becomes stronger as water \ndemands increase and potentially compete with one another. Under the 2002 Water Law, the \nresponsibilities of the river basin commissions2 and local water bureaus in respect to integrated \nwater resources planning have been strengthened. The 2002 Water Law also stipulates full cost \nrecovery for urban water services. In 2004, the China Council for International Cooperation on \nthe Environment and Development completed an important policy recommendation entitled \nPromoting Integrated River Basin Management and Restoring China\u2019s Living Rivers.3 Since \nthen, the challenges associated with its adoption have been discussed in a wide variety of \nforums, including the Second Yangtze Forum in April 2007 and the Third International Yellow \nRiver Forum on Sustainable Water Resources Management and Delta Ecosystem Maintenance \nin October 2007.  \n \n11.  A recent comprehensive review of progress in adopting the IWRM approach in the PRC4 \nconcluded that there has been considerable progress but there is still a long way to go. The \nreport set out detailed recommendations for medium- and long-term action in five main areas\u2014\nlegal and organizational reform, policy integration, IWRM master planning, public participation, \nand science and technology support\u2014making it clear that sustainable IWRM is a long-term \nprocess that takes many years to achieve. \n \n12.  As  in  other  provinces  and  municipalities,  Guiyang  Municipality  level  bureaus  are \nsubordinate to their relevant central line ministries and agencies. For example, the Guiyang \nWater Resources Bureau is subordinate to the Ministry of Water Resources, but exercises a \ncoordinating role over water resources management with particular responsibilities for water \nresource planning, water allocations, water conservation, flood control, and rural water supplies \nat the local level. At the municipal level, the Urban Construction and Urban Management \nBureaus (under the Ministry of Housing and Urban/Rural Construction) are responsible for the \nmanagement of urban water supply, drainage, and wastewater treatment. The provincial and \nmunicipal environmental protection bureaus play important regulatory and enforcement roles in \nenvironmental protection and pollution control. The provincial and municipal Development  and \nReform Commission, operating as the local subordinates of the National Development and \nReform Commission, are involved in the approval process of investment projects and in most \ncases are delegated authority for administering the PRC\u2019s Pricing Law (1997). Other ministries \nand  government  offices  at  the  provincial,  municipal,  and  lower  levels  (notably  agriculture, \nfinance, health, civil affairs, land, trade and industry, and forestry) are also involved in water \nsector issues.  \n \n13.  As indicated above, the current management of the Guiyang water sector is not well \nintegrated.  There  is  vertical  fragmentation  with  different  responsibilities  between  provincial, \nmunicipal, and district and county levels, and horizontal fragmentation with responsibilities for \nwater  sector  management  split  between  different  functional  departments  of  each  level  of \n                                                 \n2  Seven river basin-based water resources commissions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Water Resources \nwere set up in the 1950s for improving water resource planning and coordinating flood control. Most of Guiyang \nMunicipality  lies  in  the  Yangtze  river  basin  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Yangtze  River  Water  Resources \nCommission, with its headquarters in Wuhan. A small part of Guiyang is within the Pearl River catchment under the \njurisdiction of the Pearl River Water Resources Commission, with its headquarters in Guangzhou. \n3  China Council for International Cooperation on the Environment and Development. 2004.

Both  types  of \nfragmentation  lead  to  problems  in  water  resources  management,  but  generally,  horizontal \nfragmentation presents more difficult problems to deal with. This is because the system of \nfunctional supervision within the Government of the PRC allows issues caused by vertical \nfragmentation to be resolved more easily\u2014although this does not always happen in practice.  \nProblems  of  horizontal  fragmentation  have  the  following  major  institutional  and  technical \nimplications:  (i)  overlap  of  monitoring  functions  and  lack  of  data  sharing,  (ii)  inadequate \ncomprehensive  water  resources  planning  that  includes  other  sectors,  (iii)  pollution  control \nplanning that is largely unrelated to water resources, and (iv) lack of integration of function \nzoning with harmonization of quantity and discharge permitting. \n \nC.  Integrated Water Resource Management in Guiyang Municipality \n14.  Guiyang municipal government (GMG) recognizes this movement toward IWRM, and \nhas given a commitment to develop solutions based on IWRM. As a first step, it has prepared \nthe Guiyang Integrated Water Resources Master Plan (the Master Plan).   \n \n15.  Master  Plan.  There  is  a  good  potential  for  further  water  resource  development  to \novercome shortages in both rural and urban areas. The primary objective of the Master Plan is \nto  ensure  an  increase  in  available  water  resources  in  line  with  Guiyang  Municipality\u2019s \ndevelopment needs. The Master Plan provides a comprehensive review of water needs in \ndifferent  sectors,  including  urban  and  rural  domestic  water,  industrial  water,  hydropower, \nirrigation, environmental and ecological water needs, wastewater treatment and reuse, water \nsavings, and flood control. Analysis of soil and water conservation needs is also included. The \nMaster Plan presents an economically-sound strategy to pursue Guiyang Municipality\u2019s water \nresources development, and covers all forms of water use, both urban and rural, including \ninitiatives to (i) develop new resources, (ii) improve irrigation facilities, (iii) manage demand and \nconserve water, (iv) exercise pollution control and protect existing water resources, (v) reform \ninstitutions, and (vi) introduce market-based measures to save water. \n \n16.  As well as enhancing total available water resources, the Master Plan has specific \ntargets to (i) extend rural water supplies to un-serviced areas, (ii) increase irrigation coverage, \nand (iii) treat areas subject to soil erosion. However, while the Master Plan contains a large \nlisting of structural interventions, the level of attention given to resolving institutional constraints, \nand developing nonstructural interventions and practices in keeping with IWRM principles is less \nwell developed. This situation is understandable given the traditional emphasis to supply side \nwater resources planning in the PRC, and the relatively recent attention given to demand side \nsolutions. However, the Master Plan correctly identifies the priorities, which are to provide water \nto  un-serviced  or  under-provided  areas,  and  recognizes  that  these  priorities  require \npredominantly structural solutions, albeit with greater stakeholder involvement in their design \nand implementation.    \n \n17.  GMG has established a project leading group to address cross-sectoral water issues. It \nseeks to develop initiatives under the PRC \u201cwater saving society program\u201d and is in dialogue \nwith the Guizhou provincial government to introduce integrated management of reservoirs on \nNanming River. These initiatives will further the development of institutional capacity needed for \nIWRM, as well as fulfillment of the sector lending criteria of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).5  \n                                                 \n5  According to ADB guidelines for sector lending, criteria for applying the sector loan modality are as follows: (i) the \nborrowing entity has a sector development plan to meet the priority development needs of the sector; (ii) the \nborrowing entity has the institutional capacity to implement the sector development plan; and (iii) if so required, the \npolicies applicable to the sector can be improved. \n ", "32         Appendix 2 \n \n18.  Besides the policies mentioned above, a favorable set of government policies to support \nimplementation of the Master Plan already exists in Guiyang Municipality, but increased efforts \nmust be made to ensure they are fully implemented. These policies include: \n \n(i)  establishment of water user groups and increased responsibilities conferred on \nindividual households and local communities (including asset ownership), rather \nthan the Government; \n(ii)  greater  attention  in  national  planning  to  rural  development  and  livelihood \nimprovement; \n(iii)  public services to be corporative and not provided directly by the Government; \n(iv)  the Government role should become that of an enabler and regulator of services; \n(v)  separation of government and the management of enterprises; \n(vi)  utility services to be financed from user charges, with tariffs set in accordance \nwith full cost recovery principles; and \n(vii)  competition and private sector participation to be encouraged for both investment \nin infrastructure construction, and for operation and maintenance. \n \nD.   Policy Dialogue and Integrated Water Resources Management Strategic Action \nPlan in Guiyang Municipality \n19.  The ADB-supported Project will help GMG to implement the Master Plan and to promote \nthe implementation of improved water sector management based on IWRM principles. ADB will \nfinance a slice of the Master Plan, specifically in respect of five priority structural areas related \nto  (i)  alleviating  shortfalls  in  urban  water  supplies  resulting  from  increased  urbanization; \n(ii) improving rural water supplies for irrigation and domestic use, via small reservoirs; (iii) tanks \nto serve individual households; (iv) rehabilitation and construction of new irrigation infrastructure; \nand (v) soil conservation and water source protection measures.    \n \n20.  Technical assistance (TA) for IWRM6 reform commenced in April 2007 to introduce the \nIWRM approach and enhance the enabling institutional environment. Since TA implementation, \nthe following progress has been made: (i) Qingzhen City, as one of the cities in the project area, \nhas successfully institutionalized IWRM in water sector management by establishing the city \nwater authority\u2014all of the water-related management functions become the mandates of this \nnewly established city water authority, and the fragmented water management in this city will be \nsignificantly  improved;  (ii)  Guiyang  Municipality  was  selected  by  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources as a potential candidate municipality to pilot the water-saving society program, which \naims to promote water demand management nationwide; and (iii) the IWRM strategic action \nplan  (Supplementary  Appendix  S),  based  on  the  findings  of  the  TA  interim  report,  was \ndiscussed and agreed with GMG.  \n \n21.  GMG will ensure that the IWRM strategic action plan is implemented in a timely manner. \nKey activities to be implemented in the strategic action plan include the following: (i) establish \nan effective water sector management structure, (ii) shift the current supply management to \ndemand management, (iii) promote participation in water resources management, (iv) improve \ninformation management and sharing, and (v) build the capacity to manage water in Guiyang \nMunicipality.

The objective of this analysis is to provide an assessment of the technical, financial, and \nmanagerial capabilities of Guiyang municipal government (GMG) and the relevant implementing \nagencies (IAs) to develop, process, and implement the proposed Project. In particular, adequate \ninstitutional capacity is needed to (i) ensure that subprojects are successfully prepared and \nimplemented, and (ii) facilitate effective and sustainable operation and maintenance of the \nproject facilities. This section provides a summary of existing capacity, current weaknesses, and \nhow these will be overcome during project implementation.   \n \nA.  Analysis of Technical, Financial, and Managerial Capacity  \n \n2.  Capacity  of  the  Executing  Agency.  GMG  has  experience  in  implementing  major \ninternational financial institutions funded projects, but has not previously been involved with \nAsian Development Bank projects. The project management office, with a core staff from the \nWater Resources Bureau, is well experienced in the execution of water sector projects of the \ntypes included in the Project, and has performed well during the project preparatory phase. \nGMG has already identified a series of subprojects to be implemented under the proposed \nProject and preparations of these are well advanced.  \n \n3.  Implementing Agency Capacity. IAs have been assigned the responsibility for project \npreparation and implementation of individual subprojects by the relevant local governments. \nMost IAs are located at the district/county level of the Government, with actual infrastructure \nprovision  often  at  the  township  or  village  level.  This  characteristic  of  the  Project  has  two \nsignificant implications. First, the Project includes a very large number of subprojects, and \nsecond, the majority of participating agencies have limited or no previous involvement with \nforeign-funded  infrastructure  projects,  and  certainly  no  substantive  experience  of  Asian \nDevelopment Bank requirements.   \n \n4.  It is recognized that county level project management and professional skills capacity \nare significantly less than the level of capacity found in municipal and provincial level cities. A \npartial counterbalance to this lack of capacity is the fact that most of the subprojects are small-\nscale, and use well-proven approaches and technology, with which the IAs are already familiar. \nHowever, the need for significant capacity building during loan implementation is acknowledged. \n \nB.  Capacity Building Measures and Support to the Implementing Agencies \n \n5.  Although technical capacity at the county level is weak, there is a strong presence of \nengineering institutes and construction supervision companies in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(including  Guiyang)  with  good  technical  capacity  able  to  undertake  project  design,  and \nsafeguard owner interests in construction. These institutes and companies are licensed under \naccreditation systems designed and supervised by the Ministry of Water Resources for water \nconservancy projects and by the Ministry of Housing and Urban and Rural Construction for \nurban water supply projects. Environmental institutes and laboratories were able to prepare \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  and  monitor  compliance,  operating  under  a  similar \naccreditation system under the auspices of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Except for \nthe small-scale water supply subprojects, IAs will make extensive use of bought-in expertise to \ndesign and construct the project facilities, and pass on significant responsibilities to these expert \nagencies. \n \n6.  Table A6 provides more detailed analysis of the capacity needed for the main project \npreparations and implementation activities, and of the support that will be provided to overcome \nexisting gaps and weaknesses in capacity.   \n ", "  3\n8\n \nTable A6: Capacity Analysis of Executing Agency and Implementing Agencies         A\np\n  p\ne\nProject Stage  Required Tasks  Responsible Agency   Required Capacity  Existing Capacity of  Required Support for  nd\n(Phase)  Responsible Agency  Responsible Agency  ix 6\nA.

The FA is proposed as these works are small \nand scattered in remote locations for which qualified construction firms are unlikely \nto bid at reasonable prices. The CP is a desirable method in these small subprojects \nto ensure sustainability and ownership of farmers and to achieve the Project\u2019s social \nbenefits  since  CP  can  (i)  call  for  the  participation  of  local  communities,  and \n(ii) employ labor-intensive and other appropriate technologies.  \n \nThe CP should be applied first so that it is only when CP would not be practical that \nFA would be considered as a last resort, particularly when the works are scattered in \nremote locations for which no local contractors express interest, and when no NGOs \nor community-based organizations can participate. ADB must be satisfied that the \nconstruction facilities are efficient and the executing agency and implementing \nagencies are capable of undertaking the works quickly and to the required quality, at \nreasonable cost. \nCP = community participation, FA = force account, ICB = international competitive bidding, NCB = national \ncompetitive bidding. \n  \n2.

Introduction \n1.  The summary environmental assessment framework summarizes the environmental \nassessment and review procedures that will be applied under the Guiyang Integrated Water \nResources  Management  Project  to  ensure  that  noncore  subprojects  comply  with  the \nrequirements of the Environment Policy (2002) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), as \nwell as corresponding requirements of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Guizhou \nprovincial government, and Guiyang municipal government during implementation. The full \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nB.     Environment Categorization \n1.   Country Environmental System Categorization1 \n2.  Following  the  PRC  regulations,  the  Project  was  approved  by  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental Protection2 on 20 January 2009. As part of the submitted documents, a \ngeneral  and  five  subprojects  environmental  assessment  reports  were  submitted.  The \nYudongxia reservoir core subproject, a medium-sized reservoir3 with future water storage \ncapacity of 18.6 million cubic meters (m3) is classified category A and a full environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  report  has  been  prepared.  Following  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental categorization criteria, all other subprojects involving construction of smaller \nreservoirs, irrigation system rehabilitation, and soil conservation subprojects, regardless of \ntheir contents and locations, have been classified category B. Environmental impact reports \n(EIRs)  for  each  category  B  subproject  were  prepared.  The  Guizhou  Environmental \nProtection Bureau (EPB) and/or Guiyang municipality EPB were granted authority by the \nMinistry of Environmental Protection to review and approve the category B subprojects. For \nthe small water storage structure component of the Project, because of the small scale and \ninsignificant environmental impacts, environment category C is applied.  \n \n2.   ADB Environment Categorization \n \n3.  For ADB\u2019s environmental assessment purposes, the Project has been classified \ncategory A. The Project will be implemented under a sector loan modality, and six core \nsubprojects  have  been  prepared  to  ADB  standards.  Three  EIAs  for  core  reservoir \nsubprojects  and  three  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  the  other  core \nsubprojects were completed. These have been summarized in one summary environmental \nimpact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  one  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE), \nreviewed by ADB environmental specialists, and posted on the ADB website. \n \n4.  ADB does not have a formal policy on environmental categorization of dams and \nreservoir  projects,  but  its  historical  practice  is  to  assign  environmental  category  A  to \nreservoir projects that involve the construction of a dam higher than 15 meters or a reservoir \ncapacity greater than 3 million m3. This follows the International Congress on Large Dams \nand the World Commission on Dams, and their worldwide categorization of large reservoirs \nbased on technical design and dam safety considerations.  \n \n                                                 \n1  In accordance with the Environmental Protection Categorization Directory of Construction Projects (State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, 1 March 2003), three categories are classified based on degrees of \nproject impacts on the environment: (i) category A: projects with potential for significant adverse environmental \nimpacts, (ii) category B: projects with some lesser adverse environmental impacts, and (iii) category C: projects \nunlikely to have adverse environmental impacts.  \n2  Formerly State Environmental Protection Administration. \n3  The  PRC  classifies  reservoirs  into  four  categories:  (i)  large-sized  reservoir:  water  storage  capacity \n> 100 million  m3,  (ii)  medium-sized  reservoir:  water  storage  capacity  ranging  from  10  million  m3  to \n100 million m3, (iii) small type I reservoir: water storage capacity from 1 million m3 to 10 million m3, and (iv) \nsmall type II reservoir: water storage capacity from 100,000 m3 to 1 million m3 . The PRC EIA system classifies \nlarge- and medium-sized reservoirs category A projects.   \n ", "                                                                                                                                     Appendix 11           5   5                               \n3.   Alignment of ADB and Country System Environment Categorizations \n5.  There  are  differences  in  environmental  categorization  of  reservoir  subprojects \nbetween ADB and the PRC country system. ADB pays more attention to the dam safety by \nemphasizing the dam height while the PRC country system focuses more on reservoir \ncapacity. The dam safety is addressed separately in the PRC system. In conjunction with an \nindependent dam panel\u2019s review of technical and dam safety, the Project introduces a \npractical categorization approach for reservoir subprojects based on their environmental \neffects (i.e., impacts of downstream flows, groundwater, protected areas, etc.) rather than \ntheir physical characteristics, particularly dam height and reservoir volume. These principles \nwere jointly developed by ADB, the Executing Agency, and EPB, and based on the results of \nfocus group meetings with local stakeholders (e.g., farmers\u2019 union, women\u2019s union, and local \ngovernment). \n \n6.  These principles will be upheld through a transparent and inclusive environmental \nscreening process for each subproject. Every reservoir subproject will, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  be  subject  to  an  environmental  screening  process  by  an \nindependent stakeholder panel, in conjunction with an independent dam panel\u2019s review of \ntechnical and dam safety considerations. The independent stakeholder panel will comprise \nenvironmental  experts  of  at  least  the  Water  Resources  Bureau,  EPB,  and  the  Land \nResources Bureau. The expert screening will determine whether significant environmental \nimpacts warrant a full EIA. English translations of screening results will be sent to ADB for \nreview  and  comments  prior  to  finalizing  subproject  categorization.  The  environmental \nscreening results will also be used to prepare the terms of reference for the environmental \nassessment. The detailed description is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nC.  Environmental Assessment of Subprojects \n \n4.   Responsibilities and Procedure for Environmental Assessment \n \n7.  With the exception of the small water storage structures component, an EIR or EIA \nwill be prepared for each noncore subproject during project implementation. The EIR or EIA \nwill  include  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  with  mitigation  measures  and \nfinancial sources as prerequisites for approval. A monitoring and enforcement program will \nbe  developed  to  ensure  that  none  of  the  project  components  has  any  major  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Public consultation will be conducted through interviews, meetings, \nor surveys as part of subproject environmental assessment, based on the PRC public \ninvolvement procedures and guidelines. The results will be documented and reflected in the \nEIR or EIA. A qualified environmental consultant with experience in ADB environmental \npolicy will be recruited to assist the project management office (PMO) to review the EIRs and \nEIAs prepared for all noncore subprojects by the local certified agency. \n \n8.  For the small water storage structures component of the Project, all subprojects \nunder this component will be classified category C. Neither EIAs nor IEEs (or EIRs) will be \nrequired  but  the  subprojects\u2019  contents,  locations,  surrounding  environments,  and  other \nsubproject  features  will  be  reviewed  by  the  PMO  with  the  assistance  of  a  qualified \nenvironmental specialist to ensure that impacts, if any, will be within the acceptable levels. \nMitigation measures, where needed, will be incorporated into the subproject engineering \ndesign. The PMO will submit a simple environmental review recommendation (in English) for \neach subproject4 to ADB for record, 2 weeks before contract award or implementation \nagreement approval, as appropriate.  \n \n9.  The PMO will submit a summary of the EIR in English for nine subprojects on \nrehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation schemes, and eight subprojects on soil conservation \n                                                 \n4  Defined as a package of small water structures needed to address the requirements of a village or group of \nvillages. \n ", "56       Appendix 11 \nand protection of water resources to ADB for endorsement on a no-objection basis 4 weeks \nbefore contract award. \n \n10.  For the 43 noncore subprojects involving construction of small reservoirs for rural \nwater  supply  and  irrigation,  either  EIRs  or  EIAs  will  be  conducted,  depending  on \nenvironmental categorization as noted above (para 6).   \n \n(i)  EIRs will be prepared following ADB\u2019s guidelines on the preparation of IEEs. \nThe PMO (assisted by the environmental consultant) will review the findings, \ndepth of assessment, and mitigation and management plans, as well as \nreport quality. If it is satisfied that these meet the relevant ADB requirements, \nand is also supported by the subproject report of the independent dam safety \nreview panel, an SIEE for each subproject will be prepared (in English), and \nsubmitted to ADB for review 6 weeks before subproject implementation and \ncontract  award.  In  cases  of  identified  significant  impacts  or  where  a \nsubproject category might be changed to category A, ADB will notify the PMO \nof its concerns and requirements within 3 weeks of the SIEE submission. If \nthere are particular issues raised or identified in the process of preparing the \nEIR and technical assessment of dam safety, (e.g., subprojects, while small in \nscale, are located in or near environmentally or socially sensitive areas, or \nconcerns of dam safety are raised), the subprojects would be upgraded to \ncategory A, and all the procedures and requirements needed for category A \nsubprojects will be triggered.  \n(ii)  EIAs will be prepared in accordance with ADB policies and guidelines. The \nSEIA in English will be submitted to ADB for review and approval 5 months \nbefore subproject implementation. Each SEIA needs to be posted on the ADB \nwebsite for 120 days, as well as in the local language, and there needs to be \na second public consultation after the SEIA has been posted. ADB will review \nand comment on the SEIA within 2 weeks of its submission, and approve it \nafter all comments from ADB and the public are appropriately taken into \nconsideration.  \n \n11.  Submission of English translations of EIRs and EIAs for noncore subprojects will not \nbe  a  standard  requirement.  However,  (i) ADB  will  reserve  the  right  to  require  English \ntranslation of EIAs or EIRs, if any noncore subproject is deemed highly sensitive by ADB; \nand (ii) a copy of the Chinese language of EIAs and EIRs will be submitted to ADB for \nrecord, together with the English language version of the SEIA, summary environmental \nimpact report, or SIEE.  \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will review and approve the SEIA and/or SIEE in \nconsultation with the Regional and Sustainable Development Department. To mitigate any \npotential adverse impacts, identified environmental measures will be incorporated into the \nsubproject design. The Guizhou EPB and its subordinate offices at the municipal, county, \nand township levels will monitor environmental mitigation measures as detailed in the EMPs \nfor various components. The PMO will also be provided additional expertise for regular \nenvironmental supervision, monitoring, and reporting during project implementation, and a \ncomposite SIEE for all category B subprojects. IEEs prepared at the end of each 6-month \nperiod  will  be  prepared  (in  English)  and  submitted  as  part  of  the  required  6-month \nenvironmental reports. \n \n5.   Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n13.  To  implement  environmental  considerations  across  all  subprojects,  the  following \nenvironmental  criteria  have  been  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  Guiyang  municipal \ngovernment:  (i)  all  subprojects  shall  avoid  areas  with  defined  or  known  environmental \nsensitivities; (ii) subprojects requiring environmental assessment must follow the procedures \noutlined in this report; (iii) reservoir, small water storage, and irrigation subprojects shall \navoid apparent pollution sources to minimize the risk of water contamination, and ensure \n ", "                                                                                                                                     Appendix 11           5   7                               \nsafety of water supply; and (iv) subprojects shall be selected to maximize environmental \nbenefits and minimize adverse environmental impacts.  \n \n14.  The underlying limestone geology of the entire Guiyang region is fractured and tilted, \nand reservoir leakage is typically found in the karst formation. Consequently, environmental \nassessments  for  reservoir  subprojects  must  include  a  review  of  the  engineering  and \nconstruction techniques such as grout curtains, etc., to avoid or minimize reservoir leakage, \nraising  water  tables,  and  water  logging.  In  addition,  reservoir  subprojects  will  consider \necological water demand with appropriate project design in the allocation of water resources, \nand allow a minimum 10% ecological or in-stream water. Necessary mitigation measures will \nbe considered to minimize downstream impacts due to the imbalance of ecological water \ncaused by the subprojects. \n \n15.  Besides site screening and initial site investigation, one of the effective measures to \nmeet the criteria described above is to identify and conduct an analysis of alternatives. \nWhere possible and appropriate, noncore subprojects, multiple/alternative sites, designs, \nand/or  scales  shall  be  identified  and  evaluated  during  subproject  identification  and \nevaluation, to allow the selection of optimal or least-impact alternatives. PMO staff, assisted \nby qualified consultant environmental specialists and institutions working closely with the \nproject planners and engineers throughout the project identification and preparation stages, \nwill provide the needed input to ensure that environmental considerations will be included in \nthe decision-making process. \n \nB.   Staffing Requirements and Budget \n16.  Within the PMO, a Social, Environmental, and Resettlement Management Division \nhas been established under the Project, and an engineer with environmental management \nbackground will be assigned to coordinate and manage the environmental performance of \nthe project implementation. His or her responsibilities will be to ensure compliance with \nproject regulations, review reports, supervise, and coordinate EMP implementation; and \nrecruit and guide external independent monitoring.  \n \n17.  The PMO and ADB have agreed that an environmental management regulation for \nproject construction will provide the legal basis for the overall environmental management of \nthe  Project.  The  environmental  management  regulation  for  project  construction  will  be \ndeveloped by the Social, Environmental, and Resettlement Management Division of the \nPMO. It will address the common environmental management and mitigation requirements \nand issues of all subprojects, which will include, but not be limited to, a summary of (i) the \nmitigation measures presented in the EIA/EIR, (ii) the project EMP, (iii) the applicable PRC \nenvironmental regulation and standards presented in the EMP, and (iv) the requirements for \nincorporation  of  environmental  considerations  into  subproject  construction  tendering \ndocuments and contracts.  \n \n18.  To ensure EMP implementation, the PMO will adopt the environmental supervision \nengineer mechanism to supervise the contractors\u2019 environmental performance and with \ngovernment counterpart financing, employ a third-party or external environmental monitor to \nmonitor the key environmental parameters in the affected areas regularly. \n \n19.  A competent environmental specialist (national consultant, 18 person-months) with \nrich experience in environmental policy and related ADB requirements, will be recruited \nduring project implementation to assist the PMO to (i) conduct environmental screening of \nreservoir subprojects, (ii) review EIRs prepared by the local certified agency for all noncore \nsubprojects involving the construction of reservoirs, (iii) prepare SEIA and/or SIEE and/or \nsummary environmental impact report in English for each noncore subproject, (iv) provide \nguidance  to  the  PMO  and  subproject  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of EMPs for all components or subprojects funded under the Project, and \n(v) provide training. \n \n ", "58      Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China/Guiyang Integrated Water Resources Management (Sector) Project \n \nLending/Financing  Sector  Department/  East Asia Department/ \nModality:  Division:  Agriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources \nDivision \n       \nI. POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project is a key part of the Guiyang municipal government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty during the 11th Five-Year Plan, \nincluding completing the provision of domestic water to all urban and rural households (including all ethnic minority \nhouseholds), and increasing irrigated agriculture area per household. Integrated improvements in water resources \ninfrastructure and management will reduce non-income poverty caused by lack of reliable water and increase incomes \nfrom agriculture and industry, raising the productivity of labor, water, and land resources, while strengthening capacity to \nassure environmental water flows. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.     Key Issues  \nGuizhou Province is one of the poorest provinces in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), with the second lowest rural \nincome, and the lowest level of urban income of any province. The Project will provide water supply to enhance industrial \nand agricultural production activities in some of the poorest and most underserved rural and urban areas of Guiyang \nMunicipality. About 25% of the rural population lives below the poverty line (CNY1,200 per capita per year). The \nproposed Project would cover 71 towns/townships out of the total 77 towns/townships in the Guiyang Municipality, \nincluding 18 \u201cpoverty\u201d towns/townships designated by Guizhou Province, five of which are designated class A \u201cpoverty\u201d \ntowns/townships with average annual income of less than CNY785 per person. \n \nGuiyang\u2019s steep limestone terrain means that rainfall rapidly runs off into deeply entrenched rivers or infiltrates the \nground. For many months of the year, there is little rain. Most springs and streams only flow intermittently. Urban \ngroundwater is already overexploited and polluted, and rural groundwater resources are mostly limited, unreliable, or \ninaccessible. Water is not easily available for use unless intercepted, stored, and delivered to where it is needed. \n \nIn Guiyang Municipality, about 430,000 people, primarily in rural areas, lack satisfactory domestic water supplies, with \nthe burden of water collection falling mainly on women. Irrigated land is very limited, and lack of reliable irrigation limits \npotential for changing to more profitable cropping patterns. Future industrial investment and employment opportunities in \ncities and towns depend on the availability of improved water supplies. \n \n2.     Design Features  \nData on poverty and ethnic minorities will be considered in the prioritization of subprojects. Analysis of proposed changes \nin water tariffs includes recommendations about appropriate adjustments in the minimum livelihood program payments to \nsupport affordability of water for poor households. Community management of tertiary irrigation development and small \nwater tank construction will encourage special consideration for households constrained by poverty and limited labor \nresources. Improvements in water supply and irrigation management will help to secure reliable, accountable delivery of \nservices, including arrangements for communication and participation in decision making. \n \nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nGuizhou Province is one of the poorest provinces in the PRC, with the second lowest rural income and the lowest level of \nurban income of any province. In 2008, about 4.6% of the municipality\u2019s urban population and about 3.9% of the \nmunicipality\u2019s rural population lived under the municipality\u2019s absolute poverty line for urban and rural areas, respectively, \nand received conditional support from the Government. The rural population considered being income-vulnerable and \nliving at less than CNY1,200 per person per year was estimated at 25%. The Project covers 71 towns and townships out \nof the total 77 towns and townships in the Guiyang Municipality, including 18 \u201cpoverty\u201d towns/townships designated by \nGuizhou Province, five of which are designated class A \u201cpoverty\u201d towns/townships with an average annual income of less \nthan CNY785 per person. The Project has specific provisions to target women and ethnic minorities, considered \nparticularly vulnerable. In Guiyang Municipality, about 430,000 people, primarily in rural areas, lack satisfactory domestic \nwater supplies, with the burden of water collection falling mainly on women. The Project will provide rural households \nwith opportunities to improve their agricultural income by increasing the surface of irrigated land, allowing them to change \nfrom low-yield crops and subsistence farming to higher-value crops. The Project will also reduce non-income poverty by \nproviding reliable domestic water supply to households \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                     Appendix 12           5   9                               \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nPrimary stakeholders include rural and urban households using domestic water, irrigators, and water-using enterprises, \nas well as those affected by land acquisition and resettlement. Secondary stakeholders include village councils, and \ngovernment units at township level and above, particularly water resources bureaus. The Project supports integrated \nwater resources management (IWRM), which emphasizes involvement of stakeholders in improving governance and \nmanagement of water resources. \n \nTwo rounds of public consultation roundtables were held during the preparation of feasibility studies reports (FSRs) for \neach subproject. For each subproject with irrigation, a further consultation will be held with irrigator representatives to \nparticipate in the preliminary and detailed design, form a water users association (WUA), and prepare for implementation \nof operation and maintenance where the WUA will have primary responsibility for irrigation management. Public \nconsultation meetings and stakeholder panels will provide forums for participation in multipurpose reservoir management \nand river sub-basin planning. Where appropriate, community-managed modalities will be used for implementation of \nirrigation canal system (particularly tertiary canals) and small tank construction. The project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA)a conducted urban and rural household surveys and interviews, including key informant interviews and \nfemale and male focus group discussions.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe Project will support capacity development for public consultation and participatory planning targeting the project \nmanagement office (PMO) and local communities in the subproject area. A participatory strategy for noncore subprojects \nhas been developed (Supplementary Appendix K). \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Project focuses on improving water supply for domestic use and for irrigated agriculture (where women are playing \nan increasingly larger role because of higher male-out migration to the urban area). During the TA, interviews held with \nfemale and male focus groups confirmed priority needs for water, and showed interest and support from women and men \nin greater participation in water management. Public consultation roundtables included women, and showed the \nimportance of a proactive approach to disseminating information, inviting local leaders, and selecting convenient \nlocations. The Women\u2019s Federation will take part in project implementation through its involvement in the project leading \ngroup at the municipal and district/county levels, and ensure women\u2019s effective participation in the participatory \nconsultation at the village levels. It will contribute to define implementation modalities for small water tanks using lessons \nfrom its Mother Water Tanks Project.b  \n \n2.  Key Actions.

Background \n \n1.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  as  a  sector  loan  with  a  structural  component \nconsisting of five subproject types: (i) urban water supply, (ii) township and rural water \nsupply, (iii) irrigation system rehabilitation, (iv) soil and water conservation, and (v) small \nwater  storage  tanks.  Six  core  subprojects  have  been  selected  for  appraisal  and  early \nimplementation during the project preparations. Of the core subprojects, the Yudongxia \nreservoir  subproject  will  involve  a  relatively  large  amount  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  A  full  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  and  approved  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); a detailed resettlement plan was prepared and will be the basis \nfor implementation. Jinlong reservoir subproject, Liaojiuzhai reservoir subproject, and the \nWudang  irrigation  rehabilitation  subproject  will  involve  relatively  small  amounts  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement, so three short resettlement plans have been prepared and \napproved by ADB. These three core subproject resettlement plans may need to be updated \nbased on detailed design, disclosed to affected persons, and resubmitted to ADB prior to \ncommencement of land acquisition and civil works. For the other two core subprojects, \nresettlement plans are not required since no involuntary resettlement is involved.  \n \n2.  Regarding noncore subprojects, about six to eight full resettlement plans and 40 to \n42 short resettlement plans will be prepared in accordance with the resettlement framework \nfor ADB approval prior to the commencement of civil works for each subproject. These \nresettlement plans should be prepared based on subproject design and resettlement impact \nsurveys.    \n \nB.   Resettlement Impacts \n \n3.  To avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, there was close consultation \nwith the local officials, village committees, and affected persons during project planning and \nresettlement  plan  preparation.  The  core  subprojects  will  affect  23  villages  of  eight \ntownships/streets in Wudang District, Xiuwen County, Xifeng County of Guiyang Prefecture, \nand Longli County of Qiannan Prefecture. A total of 1,751 persons (including 2 enterprises \nwith 26 employees) will be affected directly by land acquisition, of which 200 persons need \ntheir houses to be relocated. The core subprojects will permanently acquire 2,412.5 mu of \nland, of which 1,118 mu (46%) is classified cultivated land. In addition, 432.7 mu of land will \nbe occupied temporarily during the construction phase, which affects another 292 persons. \nThere will be demolition of 29,403 square meters (m2) of residential housing and 5,897 m2 of \nnonresidential housing, including the two tourism enterprises. The impact details for the core \nsubprojects  are  summarized  in  Table  A14.1.  For  the  noncore  subprojects,  preliminary \nstudies estimate that 10,450 mu of land will be acquired, of which 4,800 mu is cultivated land \nthat affects the livelihoods of 4,524 people, including about 1,000 persons that need their \nhouses to be relocated.   \n \n ", "64          Appendix 14 \nTable A14.1:  Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts  \nof Core Subprojects \nPermanent   Temporary \nAffected  Households/  Permanently \nSubproject  Affected  Land  Land \nTownships Enterprises  Affected \nName  Areas  /Villages  Acquisition  Acquisition  (m2)  Persons \n(mu)  (mu)  \nYudongxia  Wudang \nSubproject  District \n5/11  1,986.8  119.1  29,402.9/5,897.1  1,458 \nLongli \nCounty \nJinlong  Xiuwan \nSubproject   County  1/5  384.9  275.3  0  61 \nLiaojiuzhai  Xifeng  1/1 \nSubproject  County    39.6  16.3  0  185 \nWudang  Shuitian \nIrrigation  town, \nRehabilitation  Wudang  1/6  1.2  22.0  0  47 \nSubproject  District \n \n        Total   8/23  2,412.5  432.7  29,402.9/5,897.1  1,751 \nm2 = square meter. \nSources: Resettlement plans and Yudongxia resettlement outlines.  \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n4.  For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or \nbetter income and living standards in accordance with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nlaws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.1 Key  PRC  laws  and \nregulations  include  the  Land  Administrative  Law  of  the  PRC,  2004;  the  Decision  on \nReinforcing  Reform  in  Land  Administration  by  the  State  Council  (State  Council  [2004] \nNo. 28); Ministry of Land Resources (MLR) Guidelines on Improving Land Acquisition and \nRelocation Regulations (MLR Document No. 238) and Land Acquisition and Resettlement \nRegulation for Construction of Large and Medium-sized Water Conservancy Projects (State \nCouncil  [2006]  No.  471);2Regulations  on  the  Compensation  for  Land  Acquisition  and \nResettlement  with  regard  to  the  Construction  of  Large  and  Medium-sized  Water \nConservancy and Hydroelectric Projects (National Government [2006] No. 17); Current Land \nUse  Classification(GB/T21010\u20132007);  and  Specifications  on  Land  Requisition  and \nResettlement Design for Construction of Water Resources and Hydropower Project (SL290-\n2003).  Meanwhile,  Guizhou  Province  and  Guiyang  Municipality  also  issued  related \ndocuments. All these documents have provided essential guidelines for resettlement plan \npreparation.  All  persons  affected  by  the  Project  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  and \nassistance. The cut-off date for eligibility for compensation and assistance is the date of \neach subproject approval by local government, which will be announced immediately to all \naffected persons. \n \n5.  Based on consultations with local governments and affected persons, and general \npractices in the project counties/cities, a set of resettlement principles was adopted by the \nproject implementing agencies (IAs). These include the following: (i) avoid or minimize \nresettlement, wherever feasible; (ii) the compensation and titles gained by the affected \npersons shall at least enable them to maintain the same living standards as \u201cwithout project\u201d \nor even better; (iii) affected persons should derive some direct benefits from the Project; \n(iv) all affected people regardless of the legal titles shall be entitled to receive compensation \nand  demolition  assistance;  (v)  the  resettlement  compensation  shall  ensure  all  affected \npersons to at least maintain the living standards as before; (vi) if the remaining land after \nland acquisition fails to safeguard the livelihood of the affected persons, compensation in \nforms of cash or land replacement, plus other necessary profit-earning activities, shall be \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995.

Compensation for land acquisition, residential housing, and nonresidential housing \n(enterprise demolition) will be paid to all users regardless of whether titled or not. For land \nacquisition,  compensation  includes  land  compensation,  resettlement  subsidy,  and \ncompensation for ground attachment and young crops. The land compensation will be paid \nto the affected village and/or affected persons and the resettlement subsidy and other \ncompensation  for  individual  asset  loss  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  persons.  For  small \nbusinesses and housing demolition, compensation will be paid directly to owners in cash \naccording to the appraised value of the land and fixed property assets. Income losses \nresulting from reduced production/sales and wages caused by the Project will be assessed \nand compensated in cash. \n \nD.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation  \n \n7.  The plans for livelihood rehabilitation and physical relocation have been included in \neach resettlement plan to ensure their livelihoods and living standards are fully restored. \nAccording to the economic characteristics of affected villages, different schemes for income \nrestoration  will  be  carried  out.  People  can  choose  the  options  according  to  their \nrequirements. Since the resettlement impacts of Jinlong and Liaojiuzhai subprojects are \nsmall, the affected villages and affected persons will be directly compensated in cash. \nRegarding the villages seriously affected by the Yudongxia subproject, additional strategies \nand measures (including adjustments to agriculture crops structure to more cash crops, land \nconsolidation, and developing tourism) will be considered and incorporated into the detailed \nresettlement plan. This will include assistance measures such as provision of employment \nfor project construction, provision of skills training, and employment information will be \nprovided to all affected persons, including 50% women. In addition, the persons who are \naffected by the Yudongxia subproject, a medium-size water conservancy project, are entitled \nto post-stage development support with CNY600 per capita per year during the 20 years \nfollowing project completion. Through these measures, all affected persons can maintain or \nacquire more stable incomes to restore and enhance their living standards.  \n \n8.  Regarding housing demolition, the affected owners will receive compensation at \nreplacement  cost  for  the  lost  structures  and  attachments  without  consideration  of \ndepreciation. The affected households can rebuild their houses by themselves with a free \nhouse plot provided by the village. Local government will approve the new housing sites and \nprovide local infrastructure prior to house construction. The affected persons can salvage the \nstructural materials and a moving subsidy will also be provided.  \n \n9.  In addition, special attention will be paid to vulnerable groups for their resettlement \nand rehabilitation. The vulnerable groups will receive additional assistance from the Project: \n(i) setting up special supporting funds in each subproject; (ii) providing potential employment \nopportunities to seriously affected vulnerable groups, especially women; and (iii) providing \nlabor support to the vulnerable group in house reconstruction and farming activities.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "66          Appendix 14 \nE.  Resettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n \n10.  The  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  core  subprojects  is \nCNY116.3 million in 2008 prices, including contingencies and land taxes. For the noncore \nsubprojects, the initial estimate for land acquisition and resettlement cost is CNY302 million. \nDetailed measurement surveys will be conducted in each village and enterprise; and the \ncompensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, households, \nand enterprises. On this basis, the final costs will be adjusted. The land acquisition and \nresettlement costs are included as part of the total project cost and will be funded by \nGuiyang  municipal  government  or  county/district  governments.  According  to  the \ncompensation policies and standards defined in the resettlement plans, the payment and \nusage  of  compensation funds  will  be carried  out  under  the supervision of  the  internal \nmonitoring agencies, with regular audit and external monitoring agency reviews.  \n \nF.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance \n \n11.  For the core subprojects, the people affected have been informed about the key \nelements of land acquisition and resettlement through consultation during the planning stage \nand  distribution  of  resettlement  information.  On  various  occasions  during  meetings, \ninterviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community \nconsultation meetings, local representatives have participated in the planning and concerns \nhave been integrated into the resettlement plans. Once the project feasibility was approved, \nthe  resettlement  plans  were  finalized  and  disclosed  to  local  officials;  the  resettlement \ninformation booklets had earlier been provided to the 17 affected villages and affected \nhouseholds. The core subproject resettlement plans have been posted on the ADB website \nand the noncore subproject resettlement plan will also be uploaded upon ADB approval. The \nrelevant  IAs  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  for  supervising  implementation, \ncontinuing public  consultation,  monitoring  progress,  and responding to grievances.  The \ngrievance redress procedures are well established and explained in the resettlement plans. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements and Schedule \n \n12.  The Guiyang project management office (PMO) will assume the overall responsibility \nfor implementing resettlement. The Social, Environment, and Resettlement Management \nDivision of the PMO will coordinate the planning, implementation, and reporting of land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  progress.  For  the  core  subprojects,  the  IAs  are  Guiyang \nZhushui Water Resources Development Company for Yudongxia subproject, Xifeng Water \nResources Bureau for Liaojiuzhai subproject, Xiuwen Water Resources Bureau for Jinlong \nsubproject, and Wudang Water Resources Bureau for Wudang Irrigation subproject. The \nsubproject resettlement offices that are set up under each subproject IA will take primary \nresponsibility  for  the  resettlement  consultation,  implementation,  and  timely  delivery  of \nentitlements.  \n \n13.  The  resettlement  implementation  schedule  for  the  four  core  subprojects  was \nprepared  based  on  the  feasibility  study  and  construction  timetable.  The  actual \nimplementation schedule needs to be revised based on the subsequent approval process. \nFor  core  subprojects,  preliminary  civil  works  will  commence  by  early  2010,  but  most \nlivelihood rehabilitation and house relocation does not have to be completed until reservoir \ninundation in 2011 or 2012. So even for the seriously affected villages, there is still adequate \ntime for social preparation and detailed implementation planning. The PMO and IAs have \nagreed  to  a  set  of  supervision  milestones  with  ADB  to  ensure  timely  and  effective \nimplementation of resettlement activities.  \n \n14.  The  noncore  subprojects  will  be  assessed  to  determine  the  resettlement \ncategorization. For the subprojects that affect less than 200 people (category B), a short \nresettlement  plan  should  be  prepared;  subprojects  affecting  more  than  200  people \n ", " \n                                                                                                                               Appendix 14        67\n             \n    \n(category A)  will  require  a  full  resettlement  plan.  Subproject  resettlement  plans  will  be \nprepared  based  on  preliminary  designs  and  impact  surveys,  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix I). Resettlement plans will be reviewed by \nthe local government and then by the PMO, with the assistance of a national resettlement \nexpert. If the resettlement plan passes the review, the resettlement plan will be translated \nand submitted to ADB for approval. If quality improvements are needed, the resettlement \nexpert will specify requirements to be addressed by the IAs. Once revisions are made, the \nresettlement plan will be rechecked and then sent to ADB for approval. Only then can civil \nworks commence for each subproject. \n \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n15.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement implementation will be conducted. \nInternal supervision and monitoring will be done by each IA to ensure compliance with the \nprovisions of the resettlement plan. The IAs will report to the PMO and the PMO will prepare \na summary of progress to be included in the quarterly progress report sent to ADB. The \nPMO will also engage an independent agency for resettlement monitoring and evaluation. \nThere will be semiannual monitoring for category A subprojects and annual monitoring for \nothers.  Once  resettlement  activities  are  completed,  annual  evaluations  will  then  be \nconducted twice (i.e., for 2 years) or longer if rehabilitation is not deemed to be completed \nsatisfactorily. External monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to both the PMO and \nADB for review, comments, and follow-up actions. \n \n \n ", "68   Appendix 15 \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n \nA.   Analysis of the Project \n \n1.   Rationale for Public Intervention \n1.  Sector analysis shows that Guiyang Municipality is short of water supply for its \nresidential  uses  and  industrial  development,  despite  the  fact  that  the  average  rainfall \nexceeds  1,096  millimeters  per  annum.  Guiyang  Municipality  lies  on  the  mountainous \nwatershed that separates the Yangtze River Basin to the north from the Pearl River Basin to \nthe south, which makes it difficult for the rainwater to be captured and utilized. While there \nare adequate natural water resources in Guiyang Municipality, significant problems relate to \n(i) the capture of sufficient quantities of water and its distribution to users, (ii) the efficiency of \nwater distribution and use, and (iii) increasing concerns over water quality. On the other \nhand, Guiyang, like any other major cities in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), is \nexperiencing  rapid  urbanization  and  industrialization.  The  demand  for  water  use  is \nincreasing rapidly.  \n \n2.  The rationale for public intervention rests on evidence of market and nonmarket \nfailure. Principal market failures involve natural monopolies, an incomplete assignment of \nproperty rights in rural land, externalities, and the public-goods nature of information. Natural \nmonopoly service provision and pollution externalities exist in Guiyang Municipality, and are \nendemic  in  the  water  resources  sector  in  most  countries.  There  appear  to  be  no \neconomically-viable alternative sources of supply of the envisioned scale for the proposed \nreservoirs. These facilities are, therefore, natural monopolies. Moreover, rapid economic \ndevelopment is placing additional stress on the water environment and water resources, with \ncontinuing government intervention necessary to ensure development of adequate water \nresources, equitable allocation of water, and its proper management. \n \n3.  The failure to control overland flows and soil erosion in Guiyang Municipality has a \nnegative impact on downslope landowners because of sedimentation and the increased \nerosive force of flows as they descend. Sediment delivered to surface waters degrades the \nquality of those waters, diminishes the storage capacity of reservoirs, and reduces the \necological values and downstream use values of the resources. \n \n4.  The limited property rights granted to farmers weaken their incentive to invest in on-\nfarm water resources management. Farmers are allocated farmland by their village for a   \n30-year period. They cannot sell the land and they lose it if they fail to work on it. This \nrestricted  property  right  creates  a  disincentive  to  invest  adequately  in  erosion  control \nmeasures and to maintain irrigation works since the full benefits from the investments cannot \nbe realized in the form of appreciated land values. Even if farmers are motivated to improve \ncrop and water management, limited access to information poses a major barrier to action. \nBoth  irrigation  improvements  and  soil  erosion  control  measures  include  an  element  of \ncapacity development and training in soil and water management. Farmers do not have the \ncapacity to acquire this information independently but, once it is acquired in an area, the \ndemonstration  effect  can  lead  to  rapid  dissemination.  Implementation  of  the  proposed \nProject is based on the principles of integrated water resources management (IWRM), which \nwill help overcome property rights and information availability constraints.   \n \n5.  Private sector participation could conceivably address certain cases of market failure. \nFor example, reservoir operation could be contracted to the private sector, arrangements \ncould be made with a local bank to encourage microcredit, and some project activities could \nbe delivered using service contracts. However, these measures would not address the \nmarket failures identified, and government involvement in the development and management \nof the Guiyang Municipality water sector is concluded to be both justified and necessary.  \n ", "                                                                                                                    Appendix 15           6   9                              \n2.   Goals of the Master Plan  \n6.  The Guiyang Municipal Government (GMG) has formulated the Guiyang Integrated \nWater Resources (IWRM) Master Plan (2006\u20132020, the Master Plan), which covers all \naspects of infrastructure needs while recognizing some of the deficiencies of current water \nsector  management  arrangements,  including  fragmented  institutional  arrangements  and \ninadequate attention to water demand management. The overall goal of the Master Plan is \nto facilitate economic growth in Guiyang Municipality by ensuring that (i) there is sufficient \nwater supply to meet the demand, and (ii) the water is of satisfactory quality. The Master \nPlan describes the failure of existing water resources to support sustainable development of \nGuiyang Municipality, and establishes goals to improve the security and safety of supply, \nand achieve optimal allocation and efficient utilization of water resources through integrated \nresources planning. These goals support the achievement of the Government\u2019s broader \ngoals of sustainable economic development, rural development, and poverty alleviation, as \nstated in the 11th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development (2006\u2013\n2010). The water management goals are supported by an analysis of imbalances between \nwater demand and water supply capacity. Identified capacity problems include insufficient \nquantities  of  water,  uneven  geographic  and  seasonal  distribution  of  water  resources, \nimpairment  caused  by  poor  water  quality,  and  losses  caused  by  poor  infrastructure \nmaintenance and mismanagement. Proposed demand and supply management measures \ninclude a mix of structural and nonstructural approaches.  \n \n7.  The overall goal and objectives of the Master Plan are fully compatible with ADB\u2019s \nWater  Policy1 and  its  poverty  reduction  aims.  Poverty  reduction  will  be  achieved  by \nfacilitating economic growth generally, and more specifically, through rural development \nactivities which will address the widening gap in wealth between urban and rural areas. \nIndicators to measure achievement of the goals are described in the project design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1), and have been verified as being readily measurable \nusing existing government information resources. \n \n3.   Design of the Master Plan and ADB\u2019s Role \n8.  While the Master Plan has some shortcomings from the perspective of IWRM, they \ndo not invalidate the Master Plan but present an opportunity for its strengthening. Key \nshortcomings include the following:  \n \n(i)  The  Master  Plan  is  largely  based  on  municipal  jurisdictions  rather  than \nwatersheds,  reflecting  institutional  constraints  related  to  the  jurisdictional \nauthority of GMG. \n(ii)  The  analysis  of  water  management  options  in  the  Master  Plan  presents \nstructural measures without an assessment of alternatives. The assessment \nof alternatives only occurs at the stage of the preliminary engineering design \nwhere it is documented in the feasibility study reports.   \n(iii)  Some  time-bound  goals  are  established  in  the  Master  Plan  but  specific \nmanagement measures are not identified. \n \n9.  The Project will help implement a subset of the measures identified in the Master \nPlan. These are mainly structural measures focusing on urban and rural water supply \ncapacity (supply management), irrigation water use efficiency (demand management), and \nprotection of source water quality through erosion control. In addition, capacity development \nactivities to be conducted under the Project will promote the use of IWRM; support the \nintroduction of related institutional reforms; and establish participatory approaches for the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001.

Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n \n1.  Introduction \n \n10.  To  appraise  the  financial  and  economic  impact  and  feasibility  of  the  Project\u2019s \nactivities and outputs, financial and economic analyses were carried out on the six core \nsubprojects. An overview of the general approach for the economic analysis is presented \nbelow and results are presented for each of the core subprojects. The six core subprojects \nrepresent  the  range  of  physical,  social,  and  economic  conditions  that  characterize  the \n65 candidate subprojects. The detailed economic analysis based on key areas of economic \nanalysis of sector loans2 is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. Economic and financial \nanalyses  of  the  six  core  subprojects  are  based  on  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nguidelines  for  the  economic  analysis  and  financial  governance  and  management  of \nprojects.3 \n \n2.  Assumptions  \n11.  Financial prices used in the analysis were identified through review of the updated \ncost  estimates  of  the  provincial  design  institute,  including  estimates  of  unit  costs  and \nquantities. To assess each subproject\u2019s contribution to the PRC economy, it is necessary to \nconvert  financial  values  to  their  economic  equivalents.  Economic  valuations  exclude \ntransfers from one part of the economy to another (i.e., taxes, duties, and subsidies) and \nattempt to facilitate the comparison of project benefits and real opportunity costs to the \neconomy by translating all prices to a common, undistorted base. Assumptions used in the \neconomic analysis include:  \n(i)  evaluation in real terms using 2009 prices and a domestic price numeraire;  \n(ii)  an exchange rate of CNY6.85 per dollar;4 \n(iii)  physical contingencies computed at 5%;  \n(iv)  identification and valuation of major economic benefits using willingness-to-\npay and net farm income approaches; \n(v)  estimation of costs and benefits on a with- and without-project basis; \n(vi)  economic costs exclude price contingencies, duties, and taxes but include \nphysical contingencies; and \n(vii)  shadow pricing based on domestic market price conversion factors and a \nshadow exchange rate factor for tradable items. \n \n3.  Least Cost Analysis \n12.  A  least-cost  analysis  of  the  core  subprojects  was  completed,  based  largely  on \ntechnical evaluations and investment cost comparisons (Supplementary Appendix C). The \nproposed Project compares favorable to the alternatives that involved similar technologies, \nand provided similar levels of benefit. Noncore subprojects will also be subjected to least-\ncost analysis. Selection criteria for candidate noncore subprojects are designed to ensure \ncompatibility with economic and social objectives of the Master Plan, the financial and \neconomic viability of the subproject, optimization of project benefits, and the minimization or \nmitigation of adverse social and environmental impacts (Appendix 8).  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005.

Benefits Analysis \n13.  Water supply benefits. The quantification of urban and rural domestic water supply \nimprovements is based on the user\u2019s willingness to pay (WTP). In the case of urban water \nsupplies, the estimate of WTP is a measure of consumers\u2019 surplus based on an estimated \nurban demand for tap water. The estimated WTP is CNY4.1 per cubic meter (m3) for \ndomestic demand and CNY6.5/m3 for total demand.5 Rural domestic water demand includes \nboth household uses and livestock watering. An opportunity cost method based on the value \nof household time spent obtaining water is used to estimate WTP for this type of water. Rural \nlabor is based on local wage rates, and the time spent fetching water was estimated using \nrural household survey data.6 The estimated value for water is about CNY12/m3. Once \nsubprojects are fully developed, the total value of annual water supply benefits are expected \nto reach about CNY144 million.  \n \n14.  Irrigation benefits. The direct impacts of subprojects involving irrigation works and \nadoption of improvements in crop production methods include improved reliability of water \nsupply and increased area that can be irrigated. The benefits of these subprojects include \nhigher farm incomes, reduced economic risks, increased food security, improved long-term \nsustainability of crop production, improved health status, and increased household capacity \nto accumulate capital. This evaluation was based on modeling of crop production with and \nwithout  the  Project.  Crop  production  data  were  obtained  from  a  survey  of  300  rural \nhouseholds in the irrigation subproject areas. A conversion of crop systems and patterns \nwas assumed to occur with completion of the Project. Investment costs include a budget \nallocation of 0.5% of the base investment cost to finance extension services to support this \nconversion. Estimates of average net increases in crop income are in Table A15.1. \n \nTable A15.1: Estimates of Average Net Increases in Crop Income \n  Increase in Net Crop  Increase in Revenue from  \nSubproject  Income (CNY per mu)  Crop Production (%) \nJinlong Reservoir  561   82 \nLiaojiuzhai Reservoir  438    82 \nWudang Irrigation  258   19 \nSystem \nXifeng Small Water  488   86 \nStorage \nCNY = Chinese yuan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  Soil  and  water  conservation  benefits.  Soil  and  water  conservation  measures \nproposed in the Master Plan cover a total area of 800 square kilometers (km2). Measures \ninclude farmland restructuring, terracing, water control structures, and permanent vegetative \ncover (afforestation, grasses, and fruit trees). The Huaxi water and soil conservation core \nsubproject covers about 15 km2 of land in the Nanming River watershed upstream of the \nHuaxi and Songbai reservoirs. These are multipurpose reservoirs used for urban water \nsupply (Guiyang municipality and satellite towns), hydropower, and irrigation. Benefits from \nthese  measures  include  increased  farm  incomes,  improved  food  security,  increased \nhousehold capacity to accumulate capital, reduced risk of illness from water-borne disease, \nimproved aesthetic quality of surface waters, reduced loss of reservoir storage capacity, and \nimproved water quality at downstream sources of supply for urban tap water. However, \nmany of the off-site benefits will have a cumulative effect, e.g., changes in downstream \nwater quality will not occur until a large part of the watershed is treated so that pollutant \nloadings fall below critical thresholds.   \n                                                 \n5  The analysis of urban water demand is provided in Supplementary Appendix C. \n6  The rural household survey is described in Supplementary Appendix C. \n ", "72   Appendix 15 \n \n16.  While off-site benefits and indirect on-site benefits were identified, only changes in \nfarm incomes were estimated. This was based on the modeling of crop production with and \nwithout the Project. Crop production data for the analysis were obtained from a survey of \n60 rural  households  in  the  subproject  area.  After  accounting  for  lands  treated  with \npermanent vegetative cover, 10,400 mu of land are available for sustainable crop production \nwith the core subproject. Without the Project, a relatively small portion of these lands are \ncropped on a subsistence basis, with cropping on a plot lasting only until the topsoil is lost to \nerosion. The average net crop income on these lands with the Project is CNY281 per mu.  \n \n5.  Financial Analysis \n \n17.  Financial analysis of core subprojects. Financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) \nwere not calculated for the Liaojiuzhai small-scale reservoir subproject, the Xifeng small \nwater storage subproject, or the Huaxi soil and water conservation subproject since these \nare not revenue generating. For all of the other core subprojects, base case FIRRs exceed \nthe weighted average cost of capital and are shown to be robust in the sensitivity analysis \n(Table A15.2). \n \nTable A15.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n  FIRR    FIRR \nCore Subproject  WACC\n    30-Year      20-Year \nYudongxia Urban Water Supply, Reservoir  3.9  1.9  2.4 \nYudongxia Urban Water Supply, Water Treatment Plant  11.9  7.1  2.2 \nJinlong Small-Scale Reservoir  2.4  1.8  2.1 \nWudang Irrigation System Rehabilitation   4.3  3.7  2.2 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18.  With the exception of Wudang irrigation system rehabilitation subproject, all of the \nrevenue generating subprojects can achieve average rates of return to equity of 4% or more. \nThe urban retail water supply company (WSC)  receiving wholesale water from Jinlong \nreservoir also achieves comparable or higher rates of return. The Wudang irrigation system \nrehabilitation subproject achieves an average rate of return of 2%, which is compatible with \nthe state government policy for irrigation projects that are not expected to earn any profit.  \n \n19.  Standard targets for financial performance include a minimum debt-service coverage \nratio of 1:0, a maximum debt\u2013equity ratio of 70:30, and a minimum current ratio of 1:0. \nFinancial  performance  ratios  for  subproject  operating  authorities  generally  meet  these \ntargets with the exception of Jinlong reservoir subproject, which has a debt-service coverage \nratio below 1:0 for most of the period of ADB debt servicing, and will require assistance to \novercome cash flow difficulties. This is strictly a cash flow problem since other ratios, \nincluding profitability, are acceptable and can be overcome by water tariff increase in Xiuwen \ncounty as discussed in paras. 20-22.  \n \n20.  Water tariff analysis. A tariff increase for Xiuwen County is required to finance a \nnew water treatment plant as well as purchase wholesale water from the Jinlong reservoir. \nWater supply tariffs in Xiuwen County are relatively low by PRC standards, and are below \nthe long run incremental cost of expanding water supply capacity. The water tariff has been \nincreased by 20% from 2005 to 2006. Once the WSC begins receiving water from the project \nfacilities, a tariff increase of 108% will be required. Xiuwen county government has given a \nwritten assurance to GMG to raise tariffs to required level, and failing this, to provide \nsubsidies  to  sustain  the  subproject  facilities.  The  water  tariff  increase  is  expected  to \n ", "                                                                                                                    Appendix 15           7   3                              \naccelerate in 2010 as economy-wide inflation pressure is reduced as a result of the global \nfinancial crisis.   \n \n21.  In rural areas, the current method of charging for irrigation water by area of land \nirrigated is accepted as being inefficient in water use and provides little incentive on water \nusers to economize. GMG will seek to promote the measurement of water consumption by \nindividuals and groups of users, and apply tariffs that encourage water conservation and \nprovide for basic cost recovery of at least the operation, maintenance, and management \ncosts of irrigation systems in accordance with national policies. The proposed tariffs for \nirrigation water for the operating authorities of the Jinlong reservoir and Wudang irrigation \nsystem rehabilitation subprojects are consistent with the Government\u2019s policy. The proposed \nirrigation charges are CNY0.45 per m3 for Wudang subproject, CNY0.60 per m3 for Jinlong \nsubproject,  and  CNY0.70  per  m3  for  Liaojiuzhai  subproject.  The  current  charge  is \nCNY0.10 per m3. The GMG and county governments, while reluctant to raise irrigation water \ntariffs because of the potential negative impacts on farmers\u2019 income, recognize the problem \nthat low irrigation costs discourage water savings. The GMG and  county governments \nrespond to the problem by more stringent local water management and sufficient subsidies \nfor local water management operations.  \n \n22.  Assessment of WTP for urban and rural domestic water supplies and of net income \nfrom improved crop production indicates that beneficiaries would accept the proposed tariff \nincreases. The WTP is estimated at CNY4 per m3 for domestic use. Expenditure shares are \ncalculated before accounting for the water bill waiver for registered poor households and in \nall cases, with-Project water supply costs constitute less than 5% of household expenditure.  \n \n6.  Economic Analysis  \n23.  A base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was determined for each core \nsubproject. All core subprojects, except the Liaojiuzhai reservoir, have EIRR values of 12% \nor more, and are considered economically viable. The EIRR for the Liaojiuzhai subproject \nequals 10%, and is considered economically viable considering nonquantifiable benefits that \nare not enumerated, including water allocated to ecological uses and as yet undeveloped \nrural domestic water supply. EIRRs for the core subprojects are shown in Table A15.3. \n \nTable A15.3: EIRR for the Core Subprojects \nSubproject  % \nUrban Water Supply, Yudongxia  20.8 \nSmall-Scale Reservoir, Jinglong  18.6 \nSmall-Scale Reservoir,  Liaojiuzhai  10.0 \nIrrigation System Rehabilitation, Wudang  22.7 \nSmall Water Storage, Xifeng  12.1 \nWater and Soil Conservation Huaxi  18.9 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n \n24.  Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic performance is very robust of four \nsubprojects (Table A15.4), including Yudongxia reservoir and water treatment plant, Jinlong \nsmall-scale reservoir, Wudang irrigation system rehabilitation, and Huaxi soil and water \nconservation. The economic performance of other subprojects is sensitive to relatively small \nincreases in costs or reductions in the value of benefits. Overall, the core subprojects are \nshown to be beneficial. These results support the sector loan, but indicate that individual \nnoncore  subprojects  must  be  carefully  scrutinized  to  assure  that  they  are  sufficiently \nbeneficial.  \n \n ", "74   Appendix 15 \nTable A15.4: Estimated EIRRs and Switching Point Values \n(%) \nSmall- Irrigation  Small  Water and \nMidsize  Small-Scale \nScale  System  Water  Soil \nItem  Reservoir   Reservoir  \nReservoir  Rehab.

Distributional and Poverty Impact \n25.  Poor rural households will be the primary recipients of project benefits from irrigation \nand rural domestic water supply. Poverty is comparatively widespread across the rural \npopulation, and the subprojects are located in areas where water supplies are inadequate or \nunreliable so that benefiting populations are more likely to be impoverished because of lack \nof water. Under existing conditions, there is too much uncertainty about the availability of \nwater for cash crop production. This means that farmers prefer to plant subsistence crops \nsince  this  lowers  the  risk  of  food  shortage  when  drought  occurs.  With  the  irrigation \nsubprojects in place, the risk of drought is greatly diminished, and cash crop production will \nbe more viable.  \n \n26.  In rural subprojects, beneficiary farmers contribute to the Project through labor input \nor payment of user charges. The benefits they receive will outweigh the costs as indicated \nby subproject EIRR values. Project preparatory technical assistance estimates indicate that \nthe proportion of the rural population experiencing absolute poverty in the core subproject \nservice areas will reduce from 35% to 21%, and the proportion experiencing relative poverty \nwill fall from 59% to 45%.7 \n \n27.  The urban water supply costs are recovered from water supply customers through \nthe water tariff. Domestic customers receive a modest cross-subsidy from non-domestic \ncustomers because of the tariff structure, so that there will be a reallocation of project \ninvestment  costs  from  the  domestic  water  supply  customer  to  other  customers.  Poor \ndomestic customers of Xiuwen WSC receive an additional subsidy because urban WSCs \nwaive the water bill for registered poverty households. \n \n                                                 \n7  The annual per capita income threshold is assumed to be CNY720 for absolute poverty and CNY1,200 for \nrelative poverty. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091008091601+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 9.0.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091009093628+08'00'", "Title": ""}}
