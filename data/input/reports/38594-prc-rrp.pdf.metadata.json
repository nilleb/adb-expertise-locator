An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nundertaken  for  this  sector  lending  project.  The  summary  EIA  for \nthree core subprojects was circulated to the Board of Directors of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  on  19  August  2006  and \nthe  ADB  website  on  21  August  2006.

The  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination for three other core subprojects is in Supplementary \nAppendix O.  \n \nThe  proposed  Project  supports  the  policies  and  plans  of  the \nGovernment  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and \nGuiyang  municipal  government  (GMG)  for  introducing  integrated \nwater  resources  management  (IWRM)  in  Guiyang  Municipality. \nThe  Project  will  finance  a  slice  of  the  Guiyang  Integrated  Water \nResources Master Plan (2006\u20132020, the Master Plan), a medium-\nterm  investment  plan  for  Guiyang  Municipality.  While  the  Master \nPlan is mainly focused on structural interventions and covers the \nwhole  range  of  water  sector  investments,  including  wastewater \ntreatment  and  flood  management,  the  Project  will  focus  its \nactivities  on  five  segments  of  the  Master  Plan:  (i)  urban  water \nsupply,  (ii)  rural  water  supply  and  irrigation,  (iii)  irrigation  system \nrehabilitation, (iv) soil and water conservation, and (v) small water \nstorage  structures.  The  Project  will  also  address  nonstructural \ninterventions  including  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \ndevelopment,  stakeholder  participation,  water  tariff  adjustments, \nintegrated \nsystem,  hydrological \nmonitoring  center,  and  other  demand-management  measures. \nThe Project will be implemented over a 6-year period, 2010\u20132016. \nThe Project will follow the sector investment approach and finance \nsix core subprojects that have already been prepared, as well as \nan  undetermined  number  of  noncore  subprojects  that  will  be \nprepared and approved during project implementation. \n \nGuiyang  Municipality  lies  in  the  mountainous  watershed  that \nseparates  the  Yangtze  River  Basin  to  the  north  from  the  Pearl \nRiver Basin to the south. While there are adequate natural water \n\ninformation  management \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n \n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\nresources  in  Guiyang  Municipality,  significant  problems  relate  to \nthe following:  \n \n(i) \n\nThe  difficulties  in  capturing  sufficient  quantities  of  water \nand its distribution to users. Much of the water drains into \nrivers  as  quick  surface  flows  through  numerous  short \ncreeks  and  streams  that  run  deep  in  valleys,  or  through \nfast-flowing deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) through the \nlimestone layers (karst areas).   \nThe  poor  condition  of  urban  water  supply  infrastructure \nand  Guiyang  Municipality\u2019s  rapidly \nincreasing  urban \npopulation.  This  combination  has  seriously  stretched  the \nexisting  water  supply  capacity,  resulting  in  reduced  water \npressure and water rationing in dry periods. \nThe shortage of water for potable use and irrigation in the \nsurrounding  rural  area,  constraining  the  improvement  of \nrural  resident  incomes  and  living  standards.  Only  about \nhalf  of \nin  rural  areas  of  Guiyang \nMunicipality  have  piped  water  supply  and  about  420,000 \nrural residents face potable water shortages. \nThe  fragmented  management  in  the  Guiyang  Municipality \nwater sector. There is vertical fragmentation with different \nresponsibilities  between  provincial,  municipal,  and \ndistrict/county levels; and there is horizontal fragmentation \nwith  responsibilities  for  water  sector  management  split \nbetween  different  functional  departments  of  each  level  of \ngovernment. \n\nthe  households \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \nGMG  has  given  a  commitment  to  develop  solutions  based  on \nIWRM.  GMG  has  also  formulated  the  Master  Plan,  which  covers \nall  aspects  of  infrastructure  needs  while  recognizing  some  of  the \ndeficiencies  of  current  water  sector  management,  including \nfragmented institutional arrangements and inadequate attention to \nwater  demand  management.  Investments  under  the  Master  Plan \nwill focus predominantly on supply side interventions, but there is \na  need  for  parallel  efforts  in  institutional  reform  and  demand \nmanagement, which will be addressed by the Project. \n \nThe Project will support an area and time slice of the Master Plan, \nthe  achievement  of  which  will  contribute  to  sustainable  and \ninclusive  socioeconomic  growth  in  Guiyang  Municipality  with \ncorresponding  reductions  in  poverty,  especially  in  rural  areas \nwhere the problem is endemic. The outcome of the Project will be \nthat  water  supply  and  demand  in  Guiyang  Municipality  are \nbalanced in a sustainable manner.  \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $439.2 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $14.1 million.  \n \nA loan of $150 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 26-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nfacility,  a \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n\nlending \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGuiyang Municipal Government \nGuiyang Municipal Commercial Bank \nBeneficiaries \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n150.0 \n258.0 \n20.0 \n11.2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n34.2 \n58.7 \n4.5 \n2.6 \n    100.0 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n     439.2 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nThe Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the \nGuizhou provincial government, which will onlend to GMG on the \nsame  terms  and  conditions  as  the  ADB  loan.  Loan  proceeds  for \nsubprojects  will  be  disbursed  by  the  Guiyang  finance  bureau  to \nlocal-level finance bureaus. GMG will bear the interest and foreign \nexchange rate variation risks, and be responsible for repayment of \nthe loan.  \n \nUntil 31 October 2016 \n \n30 April 2016 \n\n \nGuiyang Municipal Government \n \nThe project management office (PMO), under the overall direction \nand  guidance  of  the  project  leading  group  headed  by  the \nvice mayor  of  Guiyang  Municipality,  will  coordinate  project \nimplementation  work  through  the  various  design  institutes  and \nimplementing agencies responsible for day-to-day implementation \narrangements.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  directing  project \npreparation  activities,  monitoring \nresettlement,  managing \nenvironmental  impacts,  monitoring  project  progress  and  project \nimpacts,  and  assisting  participating  districts  and  counties  in \nimplementing  their  subprojects.  The  PMO  is  comprised  of  staff \nprimarily  from  Guiyang  Municipal  Water  Resources  Bureau,  as \nwell  as  representatives  of  the  Guiyang  Finance  Bureau,  the \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  the  Resettlement  Office, \nand other line agencies of GMG.  \n \nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto  time).  Major  contracts  for  equipment  and  materials  valued  at \n$1 million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  awarded  through  ADB\u2019s \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Smaller \npackages  for  equipment  and  materials  valued  at  less  than \n$1 million  equivalent  will  be  procured \nfollowing  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  in  accordance  with  the \n\n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n\ntraining,  procurement,  economic  and \n\n1999 PRC\u2019s Tendering and Bidding Law, subject to modifications \nagreed  with  ADB.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$10 million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  carried  out  using  ICB \nprocedures,  while  those  costing  less  than  $10  million  equivalent \nwill  be  carried  out  using  NCB  procedures.  Shopping  will  be \nallowed for goods and contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or \nless  and  for  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  $200,000  or  less. \nSmall  civil  works  contracts  of  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  on \nsubprojects  involving  small-scale  reservoirs,  irrigation  system \nrehabilitation,  soil  and  water  conservation,  and  small  water \nstorage  tanks  may  be  carried  out  on  a  force  account  basis  or \nthrough community participation, whenever practicable, to ensure \nsustainability  and  to  achieve  the  Project\u2019s  social  objectives. \nInternational  contractors  may  participate  in  bidding  for  contracts \nusing NCB procedures. \n \nTwenty-four  person-months  of  international  and  171  person-\nmonths of national consulting services will be required during the \nfirst  4  years  of  project  implementation,  with  expertise  in  project \nmanagement, \nfinancial \nanalysis,  water  demand  management,  community  participation, \nand  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  The  consultants  will \nprovide guidance and training for capacity development to ensure \nthat  (i)  subproject  implementing  agencies  are  able  to  function  as \neffective  project  management  units;  (ii)  noncore  ADB-funded \nsubprojects  can  be  appraised  and  approved  in  a  timely  manner \nbased on the agreed eligibility criteria; (iii) implementation of water \ndemand management activities will promote more efficient use of \nwater among all categories of users; and (iv) social, resettlement, \nand  environmental \nimpacts  are  monitored  and  mitigated. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  through  an  international  firm  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Detailed  design  and \nengineering and construction supervision will be carried out using \ngovernment  counterpart  funds  by  qualified  local  design  institutes \nrecruited by the local implementing agencies. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  extensive  water  resources  benefits  that \nwill affect about 1.6 million residents or 45% of the total population \nof  Guiyang  Municipality.  At  project  completion,  expected  benefits \nwill include (i) increases in urban water supply of 40 million cubic \nmeters  (m3)  per  year;  (ii)  increases  in  rural  water  supply  of \n94.8 million m3 per year; (iii) improvement in the existing irrigation \narea of 10,773 hectares (ha) and an increase in the irrigation area \nof  18,815  ha;  (iv)  increased  irrigation  coverage  from  0.3  mu  to \n0.5 mu  per  capita;  (v)  soil  conservation  treatment  to  an  area  of \n800  square  kilometers  (km2)  of  land  at  risk  of  erosion;  and \n(vi) provision  of  105,100  small  water  storage  tanks  in  rural  areas \nto  collect  spring  and  rainwater  for  drinking,  irrigation,  and \nlivestock.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  PRC  has  been  experiencing  water  shortages  for  several  decades.  Total  naturally \navailable water flows from all surface and underground sources in this country are about 2,812 \nbillion cubic meters (m\u00b3) per annum, placing the PRC sixth behind Brazil, Russian Federation, \nCanada, Indonesia, and the United States.1 On a per capita basis, the naturally available water \nflow (2,206 m\u00b3/person), accounting for about 28% of the world's average, is one of the lowest \nlevels  in  the  world. 2  Therefore,  as  population  and  wealth  increase,  it  is  inevitable  that \nincreasingly serious water management problems will be encountered in the PRC. The PRC\u2019s \nannual  per  capita  water  availability  has  dropped  by  about  23%  in  the  last  20  years,  and  the \ncountry is expected to become the most water-stressed in east and northeast Asia by 2010. \n \nAdding to the complications, the availability of water resources varies significantly across \n3. \nregions and seasons. This represents a major development challenge, as the demand for water \nis  ever  increasing  with  rapid  economic  development  and  urbanization.  In  rural  areas,  well-\ndeveloped  and  maintained  infrastructure,  including  irrigation  facilities,  is  a  precondition  for \nreasonable living standards, and is critical for poverty alleviation. Thus, effective water resource \nallocation and management is necessary to maximize the benefits of water usage. \n \n4. \nThe  Guizhou  Province  is  one  of  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  PRC,  with  the  second \nlowest  rural  income,  and  has  the  lowest  level  of  urban  income  of  any  province.  The  capital  of \nthe  province,  Guiyang  Municipality,  is  its  political,  economic,  and  cultural  center;  and  a  major \ntransportation  hub  of  the  southwest  PRC.  In  2008,  Guiyang  Municipality  has  an  estimated \npopulation  of  3.6  million,  of  which  about  2.4  million  reside  in  the  main  urban  area,  with  the \nremaining  1.2  million  in  suburban  or  rural  areas.  About  574,000  people  (16%  of  the  total \npopulation)  are  ethnic  minorities  who  mainly  reside  in  the  rural  areas.  The  income  disparity \nbetween the rural and urban population is high, and about 25% of the rural population lives on \nan income of less than CNY1,200 ($176) per capita per year. Like many other areas in the PRC, \nGuiyang  Municipality  is  undergoing  rapid  urbanization  with  the  urban  population  increasing  at \nover 3% per annum, a trend that is likely to continue. \n \n5. \nGuiyang  Municipality  is  one  of  the  PRC\u2019s  major  producers  of  nonferrous  metals  and \ntobacco, and major industries include machinery, steel making, food processing, and chemicals. \nThe  total  gross  domestic  product  of  Guiyang  Municipality  in  2008  was  equivalent  to  about \nCNY81.1 billion, of which the tertiary (service) sector accounted for about 47%, the secondary \n(manufacturing)  sector  about  47%,  and  the  primary  (mining  and  agriculture)  sector  about  6%. \nHowever,  the  primary  sector  is  much  more  important  in  terms  of  employment,  accounting  for \n34% of recorded employment in Guiyang Municipality.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Shalizi,  Z.  2006.

New Delhi.  \n\n\f 2 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nAs  the  economic  hub  of  the  province,  Guiyang  Municipality  has  a  rapidly  increasing \n6. \npopulation and industrial development, and hence increasing demand for water. Servicing this \npopulation and related municipal and industrial water demands is causing a severe strain on the \nexisting  water  supply  facilities.  Urbanization  in  Guiyang  Municipality  means  increased  water \ndemand  for  household,  commercial,  and  industrial  use.  The  water  quality  in  local  rivers  and \nwater sources is also a growing concern because of the rapid urbanization and industrialization.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nBoth urban and rural areas of Guiyang Municipality are on the mountainous ridge of the \nwatershed boundary between the Yangtze River basin to the north and the Pearl River basin to \nthe  south.  Annual  average  precipitation  is  quite high  but  large  evaporative  losses  and  uneven \ndistribution present particular challenges for capturing and storing water, much of which drains \ninto rivers as quick surface flows through numerous short creeks and streams that run deep in \nvalleys, or through fast-flowing deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) through the limestone layers \n(karst areas).  \n \n8. \nThe  Guiyang  Municipality  urban  water  supply  infrastructure  is  in  poor  condition  and  its \nrapidly increasing urban population has seriously stretched the existing water supply capacity, \nresulting in reduced water pressure, and water rationing in dry periods. It is projected that the \nannual water shortage will reach about 420 million m3 in 2010 and about 642 million m3 in 2020. \nRapid urbanization is generating increased volumes of wastewater, much of which is being left \nuntreated. \n \nIn  the  surrounding  rural  area,  shortage  of  water  for  potable  use  and  irrigation  is \n9. \nperceived  as  a  critical  constraint  to  improving  rural  incomes  and  living  standards.  Only  about \nhalf of the households in the rural areas of Guiyang Municipality have piped water supply and \nabout  420,000  rural  households  face  potable  water  shortages.  In  the  absence  of  public  water \nsupply  systems,  the  majority  of  the  rural  population  relies  on  local  springs  and  streams, \nalthough some have small storage structures near their homes for domestic and livestock use. \nMost  of  the  rural  water  is  needed  for  agricultural  purposes.  However,  the  steep  mountainous \nterrain  makes  it  very  difficult  for  farmers  to  obtain  surface  or  groundwater  for  irrigation, \nparticularly  at  higher  elevations.  Seasonal  variation  in  water  availability  is  high.  Farmers  have \ndifficulties  growing  crops  during  the  dry  months  from  February  to  April,  and  the  short  growing \nseason  prevents  them  from  further  diversifying  their  cropping  systems.  This  situation  is \nexpected    to  be  further  complicated  by  climate  change  impacts.3 The  irrigation  coverage  in \nGuiyang  Municipality  is  much  lower  than  the  national  average,  and  many  existing  structures \nhave  been  damaged  and  abandoned.  Water  use  efficiencies  in  larger  irrigation  schemes  are \nestimated to be no more than 40%. Meanwhile, sustainable watershed management is urgently \nneeded to prevent soil erosion and pollution, and to protect water sources. \n \n10. \nCurrently,  the  Guiyang  Municipality  water  sector  management  is  not  well  integrated. \nThere is vertical fragmentation with different responsibilities between provincial, municipal, and \ndistrict/county  levels;  and  there  is  also  horizontal  fragmentation,  with  responsibilities  for  water \nsector  management  split  between  different  government  departments.  Specific  water \nmanagement  issues  include  (i)  absence  of  a  formal  process  of  stakeholder  consultation  and \ninvolvement; (ii) despite being closely integrated in physical terms, suburban districts continue \n\n                                                 \n3  Climate  change  has  three  big  implications  for  water  use:  (i)  it  changes  the  way  plants  grow;  (ii)  it  increases \nproblems of water management, and larger floods overwhelm existing controls; and (iii) some regions are swinging \nmore violently between flood and drought. This is one big reason why dams have been making a comeback. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\nto  have  their  own  water  supply  companies;  (iii)  local  townships,  villages,  and  individual \nhouseholds  are  charged  with  managing  their  own  water  supplies,  thereby  losing  potential \nbenefits from physical and management integration; and (iv) lack of coordination between water \ndepartments,  agriculture  departments,  and  local  water  users,  resulting  in  poor  irrigation  water \ndelivery systems and optimization of cropping patterns. \n \n11. \nIn  recent  years,  the  Government  has  recognized  the  urgency  to  improve  the \ncomprehensive  management  of  water  resources,  apply  approaches  consistent  with  integrated \nwater  resources  management  (IWRM)  methodologies,  and  shift  emphasis  toward  managing \ndemand,  including  the  use  of  economic  mechanisms.  A  crucial  milestone  along  this  path  was \nreached  on  1 October  2002  when  the  revised  Water  Law  was  made  effective,  and  its  added \nemphasis to water resources planning, protection of water resources, economical use of water, \nresolution of disputes concerning water, and enforcement of water use regulations, all of which \nare common water resources management concerns. \n \n12. \nAdopting  the  principles  of  IWRM  will  become  more  important  as  water  demand  and \ncompetition  increase.  Under  the  2002  Water  Law,  the  responsibilities  of  the  river  basin \ncommissions4 and local water bureaus with respect to integrated water resources planning have \nbeen  strengthened.  The  2002  Water  Law  also  stipulates  full  cost  recovery  for  urban  water \nservices.  In  2004,  the  China  Council  for  International  Cooperation  on  the  Environment  and \nDevelopment  completed  an  important  policy  recommendation  entitled  Promoting  Integrated \nRiver  Basin  Management  and  Restoring  China\u2019s  Living  Rivers. 5 Since  then,  the  challenges \nassociated  with  its  adoption  have  been  discussed  in  various  forums,  including  the  Second \nYangtze  Forum  in  April  2007  and  the  Third  International  Yellow  River  Forum  on  Sustainable \nWater Resources Management and Delta Ecosystem Maintenance in October 2007.  \n \n13. \nA recent comprehensive review of progress in adopting the IWRM approach in the PRC \nconcluded  that  there  has  been  considerable  progress,  but there  is  still  a  long  way  to  go.6 The \nreport set out detailed recommendations for medium- and long-term actions in five main areas\u2014\nlegal and institutional reform, policy integration, IWRM master planning, public participation, and \nscience and technology support\u2014making it clear that sustainable IWRM is a long-term process \nthat takes many years to achieve. \n \n14. \nThe Guiyang municipal government (GMG) recognizes this shift toward IWRM, and has \ngiven  a  commitment  to  develop  solutions  based  on  IWRM,  including  the  establishment  of  an \ninteragency  project  leading  group  (PLG).  GMG  has  also  formulated  the  Guiyang  Integrated \nWater  Resources  Master  Plan  (2006\u20132020,  the  Master  Plan),  which  covers  all  aspects  of \ninfrastructure  needs  while  recognizing  some  of  the  deficiencies  of  current  water  sector \nmanagement  arrangements,  including  fragmented  institutional  arrangements  and  inadequate \nattention  to  water  demand  management.  Investments  under  the  Master  Plan  will  focus \npredominantly on supply-side interventions, but there is a need for parallel efforts in institutional \n\n                                                 \n4  Seven  river  basin-based  water  resources  commissions  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources \nwere  set  up  in  the  1950s  for  improving  water  resource  planning  and  coordinating  flood  control.  Most  of  Guiyang \nMunicipality  (95%)  lies  in  the  Yangtze  river  basin  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Yangtze  River  Water  Resources \nCommission,  with its headquarters in Wuhan. A small  part  of Guiyang  Municipality (5%) is  within the Pearl  River \ncatchment  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Pearl  River  Water  Resources  Commission,  with  its  headquarters  in \nGuangzhou. \n\n5   China  Council  for  International  Cooperation  on  the  Environment  and  Development.  2004.

Further information about the \nMaster Plan is in Appendix 2.   \n \n15. \nThe following challenges to the implementation of IWRM in Guiyang Municipality remain \nto  be  addressed:  (i)  lack  of  experience  in  involving  local  stakeholders  in  the  design, \nimplementation, and operation of water projects; (ii) duplication of water quality monitoring and \nlack  of  coordination  between  the  Water  Resources  Bureau  (WRB)  and  the  Environmental \nProtection  Bureau,  and  conflicting  responsibilities  for  urban  water  management  among  WRB, \nthe \nUrban  Construction  Bureau,  and  Urban  Management  Bureau;  (iii)  constraints \ndissemination of information between water management agencies; (iv) lack of awareness and \nincentives  for  increased  demand  management  and  water  conservation  activities;  (v)  poorly \nintegrated institutionalized planning of water resources; (vi) inconsistency in applying economic \ninstruments,  including  the  issuance  of  water  permits,  which  is  not  applied  at  all  to  rural  water \nuse;  (vii)  insufficient  implementation  of  demand  management  programs;  and  (viii)  a  variety  of \ntechnical  issues,  such  as  conflicting  systems  of  water  and  environment  function  zoning.  A \nproblem tree analysis is in Supplementary Appendix V. \n \n16. \nThese  challenges  will  be  partly  addressed  with  the  implementation  of  the  Master  Plan \nand  the  Project  will  contribute  solutions  to  achieve  greater  coordination  and  optimization  of \nwater supply and demand management activities in line with IWRM principles.  \n \n17. \nExternal  assistance. To help the Government develop and implement its strategies in \nmanaging  the  water  sector,  external  assistance  has  been  provided  mainly  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. \nADB has provided 19 loans totaling more than $2 billion for water sector projects. ADB has also \nfinanced  61  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  for  more  than  $35  million  to  address  issues \nrelating  to  water  resources  management,  flood  management,  soil  conservation,  water  supply, \nand  wastewater  management.  ADB  assistance  has  resulted  in  the  construction  of  needed \ninfrastructure and institutional capacity development, more rational pricing of water, introduction \nof wastewater tariffs, implementation of commercial principles, and private sector participation. \nThese  improvements  are  fundamental  to  making  the  water  sector  financially  and operationally \nsustainable, and in managing water as an economic resource.  \n \n18. \nTwo projects currently under implementation in Guiyang Municipality are funded by the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation and involve environmental management in the water \nsector:  (i)  the  Guiyang  Environment  Model  City  Project,  and  (ii)  the  Guizhou  Guiyang  Water \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Project  targeting  wastewater  management  in  Guiyang  City.  The \nlatter is particularly relevant as it complements the proposed Project with activities designed for \nwastewater management. External assistance is further described in Appendix 3. \n \nLessons learned. ADB\u2019s experience in the PRC water sector indicates that projects are \n19. \ngenerally well planned and implemented, although there is considerable scope to increase the \nuse of participatory approaches in project design and implementation, especially in rural areas. \nThe  TA  completion  report  for  Strategic  Options  for  the  Water  Sector7 highlighted  the  need  for \n(i) shifting to a more unified and integrated approach, and (ii) shifting from traditional structural \nmeasures to preventive and anticipatory nonstructural measures. While urban water tariffs have \nbeen  increased  for  full  cost  recovery,  water  supplies  in  rural  areas  remain  heavily  subsidized \nand the financial sustainability of investments is an issue. Willingness-to-pay analysis indicates \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2000.

Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\nthat  rural  consumers  are  willing  to  pay  substantially  higher  water  tariffs  if  service  improves. \nLessons  incorporated  in  the  project  design  include  greater  focus  on  (i) institutional  reforms  to \npromote  sustainable  IWRM,  including  the  establishment  of  water  users  associations  (WUAs); \n(ii) the  adoption  of  participatory  approaches  to  improve  subproject  design  and  confirm \nstakeholder  support;  and  (iii)  financial  and  institutional  arrangements  for  sustainable  operation \nand maintenance (O&M).  \n \n20. \nADB\u2019s sector lending approach together with IWRM was introduced in the PRC in 2001, \nstarting with the Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project,8 and followed by the Songhua \nRiver  Flood  Management  Sector  Project9 in  2002,  and  the  Hunan  Flood  Management  Sector \nProject10 in 2006. The earlier projects demonstrate the long-term nature of the IWRM process, \nwhich  requires  full  government  and  stakeholder  commitment.  Whenever  there  is  an  IWRM \nproject,  the  challenging  task  will  be  to  build  integrated  institutional  capacity  for  achieving \nsustainable IWRM objectives.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nSector Investment Approach \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nThe  Project  will  adopt  a  sector  investment  approach  and  GMG  has  complied  with  the \nprocedural requirements of ADB\u2019s policy for sector lending.11 The Project was prepared in line \nwith the Master Plan to respond to current and impending problems in the management of the \nwater  sector  including  shortages.  The  Project  will  finance  and  help  implement  a  subset  of  the \nmeasures  identified  in  the  Master  Plan.  These  include  structural  measures  focusing  on  urban \nand  rural  water  supply  capacity  (supply  management),  irrigation  water  use  efficiency  (demand \nmanagement),  and  protection  of  water  resources  through  the  control  of  soil  erosion.  Rural \ninterventions, particularly the construction of small water storage tanks for individual households, \nwill  target  the  reduction  of  poverty  among  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  ethnic \nminorities.  \n \n22. \nThe  policy  framework  is  conducive  for  implementation  of  the  Master  Plan.  Relevant \ndevelopment goals and objectives are stated in the 11th Five-Year Economic Development Plan \nof the PRC, the Guizhou Province, and Guiyang Municipality, as well as in the Ministry of Water \nResources' 11th Five-Year Plan for Water Resource Utilization and Management. These plans \nfeature  sustainable  economic  growth  targets,  projected  increases  in  rural  incomes,  continued \nurbanization, initiatives to reduce rural poverty, agriculture and farm reforms, rural development, \nand poverty alleviation. Improved water resource management and increased efficiency in water \nusage are seen as key drivers to the achievement of these plans.  \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2001.

Detailed analysis is in appendices 2 and 6. \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nUnder the 2002 Water Law, the responsibilities of the river basin commissions and local \n23. \nwater bureaus in respect to integrated water resources planning have been strengthened. The \nMaster Plan is an attempt to put the new responsibilities into effect, and GMG has given a clear \ncommitment  to  IWRM  and  the  reforms  needed  to  make  this  a  practical  reality.  Measures \ndemonstrating GMG\u2019s commitment to IWRM include (i) the establishment of a PLG in 2005, with \nrepresentation from all relevant water management authorities, to address cross-sectoral water \nissues;  (ii)  demand  management  initiatives  being  developed  under  the  PRC\u2019s  \u201cwater  saving \nsociety  program\u201d;  (iii)  the  establishment  of  WUAs  for  the  subprojects  involving  irrigation,  on \nwhich  the  first  pilot  WUA  was  formed  in  Shuitian  village  for  the  water  users  of  the  irrigation \nnetwork  at  Qiankanjing  reservoir  since  November  2008;  (iv) participatory  approaches  that  are \nbeing  undertaken  for  design  and  implementation  of  subprojects;  and  (v) dialogue  with  the \nGuizhou  provincial  government  to  introduce  integrated  management  of  reservoirs  on  the \nNanming River. Sustainable IWRM is a long-term process and the Project will support the first \ncritical  steps  to  introduce  the  principles  and  get  it  embedded  into  the  Government\u2019s  planning \nand implementation procedures. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nThe Project will support an area and time slice of the Master Plan, whose achievement \nwill  contribute  to  sustainable  and  inclusive  socioeconomic  growth  in  Guiyang  Municipality  with \ncorresponding  reductions  in  poverty,  especially  in  rural  areas  where  the  problem  is  endemic. \nThe  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  that  water  supply  and  demand  in  Guiyang  Municipality  are \nbalanced  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  this  outcome  through \nnonstructural and structural measures needed to address high-priority investments identified in \nthe Master Plan. \n \nC. \n \nThe  outputs  include  (i)  improved  water  quality;  (ii)  increased  supply  of  water  for \n25. \ndomestic, \nimproved  water  use  efficiency;  and \n(iv) improved  institutional  and  technical  capacity  to  manage  water  resources.  The  inputs  and \nactivities  designed  to  achieve  these  outputs  include  a  range  of  nonstructural  and  structural \nmeasures for improving the management of water resources, and reducing shortages of water \nfor domestic use and irrigation. Nonstructural measures include institutional strengthening and \ncapacity  development;  stakeholder  participation  and  water  tariff  adjustments;  integrated \ninformation management system; hydroglogic monitoring center; construction of reservoirs and \nwater  supply  schemes;  and  the  upgrading  of  agricultural  irrigation  systems,  soil  and  water \nconservation, and rainwater collection and storage structures. These measures will significantly \nimprove water services in Guiyang Municipality. \n \nThe  implementation  of  a  TA  for  IWRM  reform 12 commenced  in  April  2007.  The  TA \n26. \nsupports  the  introduction  of  the  IWRM  approach  and  the  enhancement  of  the  enabling \ninstitutional environment. To date, the TA achieved the following: (i) Qingzhen City, one of the \ncities in the project area, has successfully institutionalized IWRM in water sector management \nby establishing a city water authority. All of the water-related management functions became the \nmandates of this newly-established city water authority, which should significantly improve the \ncity's fragmented water management; (ii) Guiyang Municipality was selected by the Ministry of \n\nirrigation  purposes;  (iii) \n\nindustrial,  and \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB.  2006.

The  establishment  of  one  medium-sized  reservoir  and  two \nsmall reservoirs,13 including the construction of dams, water conveyance tunnels, \ntransmission  pipelines,  one  water  treatment  plant,  and  the  extension  of  the \nmunicipal water distribution networks. \nRural water supply and irrigation. The construction of up to 43 small reservoirs, \nincluding about three for county water supply, 20 for water supply and irrigation \nat  the  township  level,  and  20  for  human  and  livestock  water  supply  and  small \nirrigation  systems.  Many  of  these  include  investments  in  water  conveyance \nsystems, small township water treatment facilities, and irrigation systems.  \nIrrigation  system  rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  up  to  nine \nirrigation  systems  covering  a  total  area  of  195,447  mu  (13,030  hectares  [ha]), \nincluding installation or repair of intake structures, canals, and aqueducts. \nSoil  and  water  conservation.  Farmland  restructuring,  conversion  of  sloping \nfarmland  to terrace  and tree  or  grass  planting, and  fruit  tree  planting,  to  protect \nthe upper catchments of the water sources (about 800 square kilometers [km2]) \nfrom soil and water losses.   \nSmall  water  storage  structures.  The  provision  of  up  to  105,100  small  water \nstorage  tanks  in  rural  areas  to  catch  spring  water  for  human  consumption,  and \nrainwater for irrigation and livestock consumption. \n\n \n28. \nFollowing  the  sector  lending  modality,  six  core  subprojects  representing  the  five  main \ntypes  of  infrastructure  development  activities  were  appraised  and  confirmed  as  potentially \nsuitable for ADB financing. Except for the Yudongxia reservoir, which is the only medium-sized \nreservoir to be supported under the Project, these are meant to serve as representative models \nfor  the  design  and  implementation  of  similar  noncore  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the \nProject.  The  six  core  subprojects  are  the  Yudongxia  reservoir  and  water  treatment  subproject \nfor urban water supply, the Jinlong and Liaojiuzhai reservoir subprojects for rural water supply \nand  irrigation,  the  Wudang  irrigation  rehabilitation  subproject,  the  Huaxi  soil  and  water \nconservation subproject, and the Xifeng County small water storage tanks subproject.

The  Project  will  (i)  support  institutional  reform  for \nimplementing  IWRM;  (ii)  improve  coordination  and  awareness  among  relevant  agencies;  (iii) \nestablish  up  to  46 WUAs14 for  subprojects  that  include  irrigation  development  or  rehabilitation \nactivities;  (iv) improve  mechanisms  for  stakeholder  participation  in  water  management,  project \npreparation,  and  implementation;  (v)  facilitate  water  tariff  adjustments;  and  (vi)  enhance  staff \nskills in water management and project administration.  \n \nThe Project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.15 ADB is now moving from Water \n30. \nfor All and IWRM to the concept of water security, for which ADB will help DMCs address five \nkey  dimensions:  (i)  satisfy  household  water  security  in  all  communities;  (ii)  support  productive \neconomies in agriculture and industry; (iii) develop vibrant, livable cities and towns; (iv) restore \nhealthy  rivers  and  ecosystems;  and  (v)  build  resilient  communities  that  can  adapt  to  climate \nchange. Generally, these dimensions have been incorporated in the project design.     \n \nD. \n \nIntegrated  water  resources  management. The Project is the first large IWRM project \n31. \nbeing considered for investment at the city/municipality level in the PRC. GMG recognizes the \nneed  for  shifting  toward  IWRM,  and  has  given  a  commitment  to  develop  solutions  based  on \nIWRM  principles.  The  IWRM  strategy  and  action  plan,  based  on  the  findings  of  TA  for \nStrengthening Water Resources Management in Guiyang, was discussed and agreed with GMG. \nThe  key  TA  activities  under  implementation  include  the  following:  (i)  establishing  an  effective \n\nSpecial Features \n\n                                                 \n14 One pilot WUA has been formed and operated in Shuitian village for the water users of the irrigation network at the \nQiankanjing  reservoir  since  November  2008.

The plan will be implemented in conjunction with the Project from 2010 to \n2016. \n \n32. \nPractical  environmental  categorization  approach  for  reservoir  subprojects. \nReservoir  projects  are  usually  categorized  for  environmental  sensitivity  based  on  physical \ncriteria  such  as  dam  height,  reservoir  storage  volume,  or  generation  capacity.16 These  criteria \ncan  be  indiscriminate  and  therefore  assign  resources  to  environmental  assessment  efforts \ninefficiently.  Unless  an  alternative  approach  to  categorization  is  introduced,  this  would  be  the \ncase  for  the  Project,  which  will  construct  more  than  40  small  reservoirs  with  heights  over \n15 meters  (m)  on  the  mountainous  watershed,  even  though  they  will  possess  relatively  low-\ncapacity  reservoirs.  While  ADB  does  not  hold  fixed  rules  regarding  physical  criteria  and \nenvironmental  categorization,  the  Government  using  its  own  physical  criteria  by  reservoir \ncapacity  will  categorize  only  one  of  them  a  category  A  subproject  that  requires  full \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  preparation.  The  Project  introduces  a  practical \ncategorization  approach  for  reservoir  subprojects  based  on  their  environmental  effects \n(i.e., impacts of downstream flows, groundwater, protected areas, etc.) rather than their physical \ncharacteristics,  particularly  dam  height  and  reservoir  volume.  The  benefits  of  following  this \napproach to environmental categorization of reservoir subprojects are (i) terms of reference for \nenvironmental  assessments  that  are  better  tailored  to  the  needs  of  each  subproject,  (ii) closer \nalignment  of  procedures \nreservoir  subprojects, \n(iii) strengthened cooperation between responsible authorities and transparency of procedures, \nand (iv) more efficient application of scarce resources through optimization of efforts required to \nconduct  environmental  categorization  of  reservoir  subprojects.  The  detailed  categorization \ncriteria and screening process are in Appendix 8. \n \nin  water  supply  reservoir \n33. \nsubprojects.  The  Project  also  includes  the  introduction  of  payment  for  environmental  service \n(PES)  scheme  to  encourage  pollution  reduction  in  the  environmental  protection  zone  of  water \nsupply reservoir subprojects, particularly the Yudongxia subproject. The concept of PES will pay \nclose attention to (i) balancing the demand side\u2014their affordability and willingness to pay\u2014and \nthe supply side\u2014costs of maintaining a certain level of water quality and opportunity costs (such \nas  forgone  development  benefits),  (ii)  ensuring  financial  sustainability  by  minimizing  the \nGovernment\u2019s subsidies, and (iii) introducing result-based compensation. First, a scheme will be \nestablished to provide direct payments from water tariff collection in GMG or the operating entity \nfor  compensating  the  upstream  Government  for  (i)  restricted  development  and  land  use  (i.e., \nopportunity  costs);  or  (ii) actual  water  quality  improvements  of  the  inflow  to  the  reservoir. \nSecond, it would be necessary to establish more direct payments or financial support to those \nstakeholders that engage more actively in environmental improvement activities. The most likely \noptions for introducing such PES mechanisms would be the extension of the pollution reduction \nactivities  in  the  communities  in  the  near  vicinity  of  the  reservoir  area,  e.g.,  the  introduction  of \norganic farming, promotion of biogas digesters, and interception of sanitation wastewater. \n \n \n\nPayment  for  environmental  service  mechanism \n\nfor  environmental  categorization  of \n\n                                                 \n16 There  is  a  difference  between  international  financing  institution  practices  and  the  PRC  country  system. \nInternational  financing  institution  pay  more  attention  to  dam  safety  by  emphasizing  dam  height,  while  the  PRC \ncountry system focuses more on dam capacity because dam safety is addressed separately in this system. \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nE. \n \n34. \nThe  Project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $439.2  million  equivalent,  including  taxes \nand  duties  of  $14.1  million  equivalent. 17  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  assumptions  are  in \nAppendix 4.

These  county  and \ndistrict  governments  also  have  experience  in  managing  domestic  projects  but  with  less \nexperience  in  the  administration  of  projects  funded  by  international  financial  institutions.  The \ncounty/district WRBs will serve as IAs for their respective subprojects. The project management \narrangements are in Supplementary Appendix W.  \n \n40. \nAs  the  capacity  of  the  institutions  at  lower  management  levels  is  considered  weak, \ncapacity strengthening measures were identified (Appendix 6), and strengthening activities will \nbe  undertaken  early  during  project  implementation.  The  Project\u2019s  capacity  strengthening \nactivities  are  designed  to  take  into  account  weaknesses  identified  by  both  the  institutional \ncapacity analysis and the financial management assessments. Currently, capacity strengthening \nis being undertaken under the TA for strengthening water resources management in Guiyang. \n \n41. \nDuring  project  preparation,  financial  management  assessments  were  conducted, \ncovering  implementation  arrangements,  sustainability,  and  fiduciary  risks  and  mitigation \nstrategy. Based on these financial management assessments, each IA, PIO, and local finance \nbureau will be assisted in establishing a sound  and  solid financial management system at the \nbeginning  of  project  implementation,  which  will  be  in  line  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Financial \nGovernance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB. 20  A  customized \nincorporates  both  domestic \nfinancial  management  manual  has  been  prepared,  which \nregulations and ADB policies and requirements to guide the financial management operations of \nall  IAs.  On  this  basis,  along  with  the  provision  that  the  capacity  strengthening  is  implemented \nearly during implementation, the Project\u2019s financial management arrangements are considered \nsatisfactory.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation and Appraisal \n\n \nDuring  project  preparation,  in  addition  to  the  appraisal  of  six  core  subprojects,  a  list  of \n42. \ncandidate  noncore  subprojects  was  selected  as  potentially  suitable  for  ADB  financing  and  for \nsubsequent appraisal by the EA (Appendix 7). The participating local governments and IAs will, \nwith the assistance of local design institutes and consultants, prepare a feasibility study for each \nof  the  noncore  subprojects  and  submit  the  completed  study  to  the  PMO.  The  feasibility  study \nreport  will  include  an  environmental  assessment  (in  a  form  stipulated  by  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  [EARF]);  resettlement  plan  (if  required);  ethnic  minorities \ndevelopment plan (EMDP) if required; rationale, scope and activities, technical description and \nanalysis,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  financial, \neconomic,  and  institutional  analysis,  including  financial  management  assessment  and  social \ndimensions.  \n \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2002. Guidelines on the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \n\nManila. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\nBased  on  the  completed  feasibility  study  report  and  in  consultation  with  the  Guiyang \n43. \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  the  PMO  will  appraise  the  subprojects  in  accordance \nwith  the  eligibility  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB  (Appendix  8).  All \nsubprojects  must  satisfy  these  criteria.  The  result  of  the  appraisal  will  be  summarized  in  a \nfeasibility  assessment  report  (FAR),  following  the  format  of  the  FARs  prepared  for  the  core \nsubprojects.  Prior  ADB  approval  of  FARs  is  required  for  (i) the  first subproject  in  each  type  of \nintervention  except  for  small  water  storage  structures;  and  (ii)  the  following  specified \nsubprojects:  (a)  Gejiazhai  reservoir,  (b)  Liangchahe  reservoir,  (c) Xiguan  reservoir,  (d)  Xiuwen \nirrigation system rehabilitation, and (e) Wudang soil and water conservation subproject. These \nare  the  largest  noncore  subprojects  with  the  greatest  potential  impact,  which  require  closer \nscrutiny. The remaining FARs will be sent to ADB for information.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n44. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  from  2010  to  2016.  The  preparation  of \nsafeguard  documents  and  public  disclosure  for  core  subprojects  has  already  started.  Actual \nconstruction  of  these  subprojects  is  expected  to  commence  in  the  first  year  of  project \nimplementation  and  all  core  subprojects  except  the  Yudongxia  reservoir  subproject  are \nexpected  to  be  completed  within  the  first  2  years.  Given  the  size  and  complexity  of  the \nYudongxia  subproject,  it  is  expected  that  3  years  will  be  required  for  its  completion.  Noncore \nsubprojects  will  be  implemented  in  about  four  batches  after  commencement  of  the  core \nsubprojects,21 but it is anticipated that construction for many of these will also commence during \nthe  first  3  years  of  project  implementation.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 9. ADB\u2019s successful experience with similar projects in the PRC and the basic level of \ntechnology and modest scale of the individual subprojects indicate that this schedule is realistic \nand achievable. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n45. \nADB-financed civil works, equipment, materials, and goods and services will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Major \ncontracts for equipment and materials valued at $1 million equivalent or more will be awarded \nthrough  ADB\u2019s  international  competitive  bidding  procedure.  Smaller  packages  for  equipment \nand  materials  valued  at  less  than  $1  million  equivalent  will  be  procured  following  the  national \ncompetitive bidding procedure in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), \nsubject  to  modifications  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$10 million equivalent or more will be carried out using international competitive bidding, while \nthose  costing  less  than  $10  million  equivalent  will  be  carried  out  using  national  competitive \nbidding.  Shopping  will  be  allowed  for  goods  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  less, \nand  for  civil  works  contracts  valued  at  $200,000  or  less.  Small  civil  works  contracts  valued  at \n$100,000 equivalent or less\u2014for subprojects involving small-scale reservoirs, irrigation system \nrehabilitation, soil and water conservation, and small water storage tanks\u2014may be carried out \non  a  force  account  basis  or  through  community  participation,  whenever  practicable,  to  ensure \nsustainability  and  to  achieve  the  Project\u2019s  social  objectives.22 The  procedures,  specifications, \nand  contract  packaging  should  facilitate  such  participation,  provided  it  is  efficient  to  (i)  involve \n\n                                                 \n21 Each noncore subproject is expected to be completed in 1\u20132 years. \n22 In  the  case  of  the  small  subprojects,  it  is  only  when  community  participation  would  not  be  practical  that  force \naccount  would  be  considered  as  a  last  resort,  particularly  when  the  works  are  scattered  in  remote  locations  for \nwhich  no  local  contractors  express  interest,  and  when  no  nongovernment  organizations  or  community-based \norganizations  can  participate.  If  force  account  is  to  be  used  for  the  small  subprojects,  prior  ADB  approval  is \nrequired.  \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\nlocal communities and/or nongovernment organizations (NGOs), (ii) use more local knowledge \nand materials, and (iii) employ labor-intensive and other appropriate technologies. The relevant \nsections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all \nprocurement documents and contracts. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n46. \nGMG  has  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  to  enable  early \ncommencement  of  civil  works  and  recruitment  of  project  implementation  consultants.  The \nGovernment has been advised that retroactive financing could only apply up to 20% of the ADB \nloan amount with respect to expenditures incurred not earlier than 12 months before the signing \nof  the  loan  agreement.  During  the  appraisal  mission,  it  was  identified  that  about  $3.53  million \nequivalent  would  be  required  for  retroactive  financing  in  connection  with  the  following  items: \n(i) civil  works  for  the  Yudongxia  reservoir/dam  construction  ($0.98  million),  (ii)  civil  works  for \nJinlong small reservoir/dam construction ($0.62 million), (iii) civil works for small water storage \ntanks  ($1.18  million),  (iv)  civil  works  for  irrigation  system  rehabilitation  subprojects  and  rural \nwater  supply  subprojects  ($0.07  million),  (v)  civil  works  for  soil  and  water  conservation \nsubprojects  ($0.28  million),  and  (vi)  capacity  development  and  training  ($0.40  million). \nSupplementary Appendix U provides details of retroactive financing requirements. All contracts \nfor  advance  action  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government \nhas also been advised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n47. \nThe Project will support a total of 24 person-months of international consulting services \nand  171  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  during  the  first  4  years  of  project \nimplementation to support the PMO, local PIOs, and IAs in project implementation and capacity \ndevelopment. 23  The  consultants  will  strengthen  their  project  implementation  capabilities  to \nensure  that  (i)  the  subproject  IAs  are  able  to  function  as  effective  project  management  units; \n(ii) noncore  subprojects  utilizing  ADB  loan  finance  can  be  appraised  and  approved  in  a  timely \nmanner,  based  on  agreed  evaluation  criteria;  (iii)  the  implementation  of  water  demand \nmanagement  activities will  promote  more  efficient  use  of  water  among  all  categories  of  users; \nand (iv) social, resettlement, and environmental impacts are monitored and mitigated. Capacity \ndevelopment  for  IAs  will  be  achieved  through  consultant  inputs  under  the  Project  and  TA  for \nStrengthening Water Resources Management in Guiyang, hands-on training on project facilities, \ntraining  in  the  PRC,  and  international  training  financed  by  the  loan.  This  type  of  capacity \ndevelopment  is  not  new  to  the  PRC,  so  national  experts  have  the  knowledge  to  provide  cost-\neffective support. However, the overall capacity development program is large and diverse, and \ninternational consultants will provide general direction to the program\u2019s content. An international \nconsulting firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nusing the quality and cost-based selection method (80:20) with full technical proposals to carry \nout  the  international  and  national  consulting  services.  Detailed  design,  and  engineering  and \nconstruction supervision, financed with the Government\u2019s counterpart funds, will be carried out \nby qualified local design institutes recruited by the local IAs.  \n\n                                                 \n23 Twenty person-months of national consulting services are being used to support the following activities during the \nsecond  phase  of  the  TA  for  strengthening  water  resources  management  in  Guiyang:  (i)  development  of  an \ninformation management system, (ii) demand management initiatives, and (iii) training for capacity building of IAs \ninvolved in the Project. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n48. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and \nGMG.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also  include  strengthening  of  the  financial \nmanagement  systems  of  IAs  such  as  the  Guiyang  Zhushui  Water  Resources  Development \nCompany for the Yudongxia reservoir subproject. Each IA will keep accounts in accordance with \ncommercial accounting principles, and be subject to an independent external audit by suitably \nqualified  auditors.  Accounting  will  be  in  accordance  with  relevant  PRC  accounting  standards, \nwhich are largely in accordance with internationally accepted accounting standards. \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n49. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment, reimbursement, \nand commitment procedures may be used to withdraw funds from the loan account. To expedite \nthe  flow  of  funds  and  simplify  document  processing,  the  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE) \nprocedure  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not \nexceeding  $200,000.  Payments  exceeding  this  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed  based  on  the  full \ndocumentation process. \n \nA project imprest account24 will be set up by the Guizhou Provincial Finance Department \n50. \n(GPFD) in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB after loan effectiveness. The initial amount to \nbe deposited into the imprest account shall not exceed the equivalent of 10% of the total loan \namount,  or  the  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  from  imprest  account  for  the  first \n6 months  of  implementation,  whichever  is  lower.  GPFD  will  be  responsible  for  management, \nmonitoring,  maintenance,  and  reconciliation  of  the  imprest  account.  SOE  will  be  used  only  at \nGPFD  level  to  request  withdrawals  from  ADB  or  otherwise  clarify  the  use  of  SOE  by  IAs. \nDisbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal \napplications and related documentations. Such documentations will demonstrate, among other \nthings,  that  the  goods/services  (i)  were  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  members,  and \n(ii) are eligible for ADB financing.  \n \n51. \nTo ensure that adequate loan proceeds are available on a timely basis, Guiyang Finance \nBureau (GFB) will maintain close coordination with GPFD. Measures to be taken to accelerate \ninternal  review  and  verification  for  withdrawal  applications  include  the  following:  (i)  GPFD  will \nhave  at  least  two  authorized  representatives  to  sign  withdrawal  applications;  (ii)  GFB,  the \ncounty/district  financial  bureaus,  the  PMO,  and  county/district  PIOs  will  establish  written \nprocedures  with  specified  time  frames  for  review  and  verification  of  withdrawal  applications \nsubmitted  by  subprojects;  and  (iii)  GPFD,  GFB,  and  the  local  financial  bureaus  will  release \nproject funds immediately after receiving them to avoid delay in implementation. \n \n\n                                                 \n24 Bank charges will be financed from the loan resources. \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  structural \n\nimplementation  of \n\ninvestment  program; \n\n \n52. \nThe  PMO,  on  behalf  of  GMG,  will  prepare  consolidated  quarterly  progress  reports \nindicating  progress  made,  problems  encountered  during  the  review  period,  steps  taken  or \nproposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  the  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress  expected \nfor  the  following  quarter.  The  PMO  will  ensure  that  these  reports  are  submitted  to  ADB  in  a \ntimely  manner.  Within  3  months  of  the  Project\u2019s  physical  completion,  the  PMO  will  submit  to \nADB  a  completion  report  that  describes  (i)  institutional  strengthening  and  water  sector  policy \n(iii)  other  project \nreform; \nimplementation  matters;  (iv)  actual  costs  incurred  in  relation  to  cost  estimates,  benefits,  and \nbeneficiary consultations; and (v) other information requested by ADB.  \n  \nThe  PMO  and  each  IA  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  that  identify  the  goods  and \n53. \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred \nfor  the  Project,  and  use  of  local  funds.  The  accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and \ninternationally  accepted  accounting \nstandards.  The  annual  project  accounts  of  GMG  and  the  IAs  will  be  audited  by  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Audit  coverage  will  include  a  special  audit  of  project  accounts,  including \nseparate  opinions  on  (i)  utilization  of  funds  deposited  in  the  Project\u2019s  imprest  account;  (ii)  the \nuse of the SOE procedure, including whether the amount claimed is duly supported and verified; \n(iii)  whether  the  EA  is  operating  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures; \n(iv) procurements  undertaken \nforce  account;  and \n(v) compliance with financial covenants specified in the loan and project agreements. The audit \nreports, management letter, and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate, or the project closing date if \nearlier. ADB has informed the Government of its policy on the submission of audit reports, which \ncovers  failure  to  submit  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  the  due  date.  A \nformal  warning  will  be  issued  for  audited  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and \ndisbursements will be suspended for audited accounts that are 12 months overdue.   \n \n\nthrough  community  participation  and \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nThe major project performance monitoring indicators include project progress, results of \n54. \ncapacity  development,  water  resources  management  performance  and  related  service  levels, \nthe  social  impact  of  the  Project,  user  satisfaction  with  water  availability,  quality  and  price,  and \nrelevant  economic  and  health  data  to  monitor  project  impacts.  An  outline  of  the  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS) is in Supplementary Appendix X. \n \n55. \nAt  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  the  PMO,  in  consultation  with  the  IAs  and \nwith  the  assistance  of  consultants, will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures to  generate \ndata  systematically  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  project  activities;  and  the  socioeconomic,  health, \nand  environmental  indicators  to  measure  project  impacts.  The  PMO  will  refine  the  PPMS \nframework,  confirm  achievable  targets,  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and \nestablish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after project inception. \n \n56. \nUnder the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime  intervals  by  the  IAs  to  the  PMO,  including  semiannual  reporting  on  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data \nthrough  its  management  information  system.  The  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate \nflexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and \ndevelopment impacts. The PMO, with assistance from the consultants, will monitor and assess \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\nactivities, and report to ADB on a quarterly basis on the physical implementation and financial \naspects  of  the  Project  to  ensure  that  impacts  are  monitored  and  reported  in  line  with  ADB \nrequirements. Key issues and progress on social and environmental safeguard aspects will be \nbriefly  included  in  the  project  quarterly  progress  report,  and  the  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation on the resettlement and environmental ambient quality changes will be reported on a \nsemiannual basis.  \n \n57. \nProject  management  arrangements  will  need  to  be  further  refined  to  take  into \nconsideration  lessons  on  involving  NGOs  in  project  activities,  in  particular  in  assessing  their \ninstitutional capacity and experience of interacting with government agencies and communities. \nTheir work will be closely monitored by the monitoring and evaluation specialist within the PMO. \nWhere  NGOs  will  be  working  with  resettled  communities,  the  impact  of  their  involvement  will \nalso be captured in the monitoring of the resettlement process. In the contracts to be negotiated \nwith the NGO, their reporting requirements to ADB on the community mobilization work will be \nspecified.  Project  implementation  consultant  inputs  will  also  be  closely  monitored  and  tied  to \nspecific outputs. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n58. \nIt is envisaged that ADB review missions will be undertaken twice per year, for the first \n2 years and once a year thereafter. ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review \n3 years after the start of project implementation. This review will reassess in detail the likelihood \nof achieving the Project\u2019s impact, outcome, and outputs; and include a detailed evaluation of the \nscope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  and \nprogress  with  capacity  development  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be \nanalyzed.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nWater Resources Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n59. \nThe  Project  will  provide  extensive  water  resources  benefits  that  will  affect  about \n1.6 million  residents  of  Guiyang  Municipality,  or  about  45%  of  the  total  population.  At  project \ncompletion,  the  expected  benefits  include  (i)  an  increase  in  urban  water  supply  of  about \n40 million m3  per  year;  (ii)  an  increase  in  rural water  supply  of  about  94.8  million m3  per  year; \n(iii) improvement  in  the  existing  irrigated  area  of  about  10,773  ha  and  an  increase  in  the \nirrigated area by about 18,815 ha; (iv) increased irrigation coverage from 0.3 mu to 0.5 mu per \ncapita; (v) soil conservation treatment to an area of about 800 km2 of land at risk of erosion; and \n(vi) provision of 105,100 small water storage tanks in rural areas to catch and store spring and \nrainwater  for  drinking,  irrigation,  and  livestock.  It  is  estimated  that  about  240,000  rural \nbeneficiaries will have access to safe drinking water, and about 59,200 farmers will benefit from \nimproved irrigation services. \n \n60. \nSurface  water  quality  will  be  improved  with  sewerage  interception  and  wastewater \ntreatment,  industrial  wastewater  discharge  control,  nonpoint  source  pollution  control,  reservoir \ncatchment pollution protection, and soil conservation.  Most of these pollution control measures \nwill  be  paid  by  the  wastewater  dischargers.  For  activities  involving  reservoir  catchment  and \nwater protection, control and improvement costs will be included in each subproject design. \n \n61. \nThe policy, institutional, and IWRM-based reforms to be implemented in parallel with the \nstructural interventions will bring about improvements in (i) subproject design through increased \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Benefits \n\ninvolvement,  (ii)  sustainability  of  O&M,  (iii)  resolution  of  water  conflicts, \nincreased  emphasis  on  water \n\nstakeholder \n(iv) interagency  and  cross-sector  cooperation,  and  (v) \nconservation activities. \n \nB. \n \n62. \nThe  Project\u2019s  environmental  impact  and  benefits  are  evaluated  in  general  terms  and \ncumulatively for the Master Plan as a whole. The environmental assessments of individual core \nsubprojects provide a more detailed assessment of environmental benefits and impacts at the \nsubproject  level.  A  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  covering  the  core \nsubprojects was categorized as environmental category A and a summary initial environmental \nexamination (SIEE) covering the remaining three core subprojects were prepared in accordance \nwith  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  assessment  technical  guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy.25 The soil and water conservation activities of the Project provide the most obvious and \ndirect environmental benefits. For the other activities, especially the construction of reservoirs, \nthere  is  a  trade-off  between  development  and  livelihood  benefits,  and  adverse  environmental \nimpacts,  which  will  occur  while  under  construction  and  during  operation  of  the  subproject \nfacilities.  However,  each  subproject  environmental  assessment  concludes  that  the  overall \nbalance  is  favorable,  and  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  manageable  with \nappropriate mitigation measures that have been identified and incorporated in the subprojects\u2019 \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). The environmental assessment of noncore subprojects \nto  be  prepared  and  implemented  under  the  Project  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the \nprovisions  of  the  EARF  that  have  been  agreed  with  the  EA.  The  summary  environmental \nassessment framework is in Appendix 11. \n \nC. \n \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n\n \n63. \nGuizhou  Province  is  one  of  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  PRC,  with  the  second  lowest \nrural income and the lowest level of urban income of any province. In 2008, about 4.6% of the \nmunicipality\u2019s  urban  population  lived  under  the  municipality\u2019s  absolute  poverty  line  for  urban \nareas  and  about  3.9%  of  the  rural  population  lived  under  the  absolute  poverty  line  for  rural \nareas, and received conditional support from the Government. The rural population living at less \nthan CNY1,200 per person per year was estimated at 25%.26 The Project covers 71 towns and \ntownships  out  of  the  total 77  towns  and  townships  in  Guiyang  Municipality,  including \n18 \u201cpoverty\u201d towns and townships designated by Guizhou Province, five of which are designated \nclass A \u201cpoverty\u201d towns and townships with an average annual income of less than CNY785 per \nperson. The Project has specific provisions to target women and ethnic minorities, considered \nparticularly vulnerable. In Guiyang Municipality, about 430,000 people, primarily in rural areas, \nlack  satisfactory  domestic  water  supplies,  with  the  burden  of  water  collection  falling mainly  on \nwomen. The Project will provide rural households with opportunities to improve their agricultural \n\n                                                 \n25 The environmental impact assessment and initial environmental examination reports for individual subprojects used \nmethodologies  and  standards  consistent  with  relevant  guidelines  established  by  the  Ministry  of  Environmental \nProtection,  in  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations.  The  individual  environmental  impact  assessment \nand  initial  environmental  examination  reports  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  domestic \nprocedures. ADB reviewed the SEIA and posted it on the ADB website on 21 August 2006. \n\n26 The national line for absolute poverty in the PRC has been set at CNY1,196 for 2009, which means that 25% of the \nrural population is now considered absolutely poor and entitled to special support by the Government. This poverty \nline corresponds to the former international poverty line of $1 per day,  while the new international poverty line of \n$1.25 per day\u2014adopted by ADB\u2014corresponds roughly to CNY1,600. \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\nincome by increasing the surface of irrigated land, allowing them to change from low-yield crops \nand subsistence farming to higher-value crops. The Project will also reduce non-income poverty \nby providing reliable domestic water supply to households. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12.  \n \n64. \nLabor opportunities will be provided to local communities. The PMO and IAs will ensure \nthat  contractors  hire  local  labor,  in  particular  ethnic  minorities  and  women,  for  skilled  and \nunskilled work as much as possible.   \n \n\n2. \n\nGender and Development \n\n \n65. \nThe  Project  will  promote  the  inclusion  of  women  during  subproject  design  in  WUA \nmembership  and  leadership,  and  in  other  project  activities  that  are  important  for  their \nparticipation.  To  achieve  this,  targets  are  set  for  the  participation  of  women  and  the  benefits \nthey will derive from the Project. Quotas of at least 30% are set aside for women in (i) project-\nfinanced training activities, (ii) job opportunities created by the Project, and (iii) participation in \npublic  consultation  processes  for  the  planning  of  noncore  subprojects.  To  enhance  women\u2019s \nparticipation in project leadership, the All-China Women\u2019s Federation is included in the PLG at \nthe PMO (municipal) and IA (district and county) levels, and at the village level a quota is set for \nat least 30% for women\u2019s participation in WUAs. In the small-scale water tank subcomponent, a \nquota  of  at  least  30%  will  target  poor  women  and  households  headed  by  women.  In  addition, \nthe Project\u2019s emphasis on active participation in community-managed infrastructure will present \nwomen with new opportunities and challenges that will further change the traditional division of \ngender roles in local communities and require targeted training and skills transfer interventions. \nThe Project will also provide gender-awareness training to project management staff to promote \nwomen\u2019s participation in key areas. The monitoring of gender-disaggregated data and gender-\nspecific  indicators  is  part  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  impacts.  The  gender  action \nplan (GAP) is in Appendix 13.   \n \n\n3. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n \n66. \nResettlement  impacts  were  assessed  in  detail  for  the  six  core  subprojects,  and  the \nselected noncore subprojects were screened for potential impacts, of which 48 subprojects may \ninvolve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  For  the  entire  Project,  it  is  estimated  that  about \n6,300 persons will be affected by land loss; and about 12,800 mu of land will be acquired for the \nProject, of which about 5,900 mu (46%) is cultivated land. The houses of about 1,200 persons \nwill have to be relocated. For the core subprojects, the resettlement impacts are relatively small \nexcept for the Yudongxia reservoir subproject. The Guiyang PMO has prepared and ADB has \napproved  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  Yudongxia  subproject  and  three  resettlement  plans  for \nthe  Jinlong,  Liaojiuzhai,  and  Wudang  subprojects.  No  resettlement  plans  are  required  for  the \nother two core subprojects, as these do not involve land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. \nBased  on  satisfactory  resettlement  experience  in  Guizhou  Province,  the  EA  and  local \ngovernments  were  assessed  to  have  the  capacity  to  manage  resettlement  impacts  properly. \nThe IAs will fund the resettlement costs according to the standards set out in the resettlement \nplans, based on national policies and local regulations. Entitlements will be provided to affected \npersons  before  demolition  and  ground  leveling  commence,  and  before  any  loss  of  land.  A \nresettlement  information  booklet  was  distributed  to  those  affected  through  village  offices,  and \nthe resettlement plans for the four core subprojects were made available at the village offices. \nThe summary resettlement plan and framework is in Appendix 14.  \n \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\nCompensation  for  land  acquisition,  residential  housing,  and  nonresidential  housing  will \n67. \nbe  paid  to  all  users  regardless  of  whether  titled  or  not.  For  land  acquisition,  compensation \nincludes land compensation, resettlement subsidy, and compensation for young crops. The land \ncompensation will be paid to the affected village and/or affected persons and the resettlement \nsubsidy  and  other  compensation  for  individual  asset  loss  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  persons. \nFor  small  businesses  and  housing  demolition,  compensation  will  be  paid  directly  to  owners  in \ncash  according  to  the  appraised  value  of  the  land  and  fixed  property  assets.  Income  losses \nresulting from reduced production/sales and wages caused by the Project will be assessed and \ncompensated to affected persons in cash. \n \n68. \nFor subsequent noncore subprojects, resettlement plans will be prepared based on the \ndetailed  engineering  designs  and  resettlement  impact  surveys.  A  resettlement  framework \nproviding  procedural  guidelines  for  the  EA  and  IAs  to  follow  has  been  agreed  upon  between \nGMG and ADB. The PMO, assisted by the IAs, will be responsible for monitoring resettlement \nplan implementation and submitting progress reports to ADB. A regular reporting system will be \nestablished to ensure that key resettlement activities are implemented on schedule. The PMO \nwill  also  engage  a  domestic  institute  to  conduct  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nresettlement  implementation  and  report  progress  semi-annually,  to  evaluate  results  through \nannual survey updates and reports for 2 years after completion of resettlement. Monitoring and \nevaluation reports will be submitted to Guiyang PMO and ADB for review and follow up action, if \nrequired. \n \n\n4. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\nPolicy and Institutional Benefits \n\n \nEMDPs have been prepared for four of the core subprojects. About 200 ethnic minority \n69. \npersons  in  each  of  these  four  subprojects  will  have  their  livelihoods  affected  by  the  Project, \nalthough the overall impact of the Project will be beneficial to the ethnic minority communities as \na  result  of  improved  water  supplies  and  consequential  livelihood  benefits.  Ethnic  minority \nvillages will be specifically targeted for the provision of small water storage tanks, and special \nprovisions will be made in resettlement plans, where construction activity has a serious impact \non  ethnic  minority  communities.  An  ethnic  minorities  development  framework  (EMDF)  for  the \nsubsequent noncore subprojects has also been prepared. The PMO, assisted by the IAs, will be \nresponsible for preparing the EMDPs for the noncore subprojects, as required, and monitoring \nthe implementation of all EMDPs. The summary EMDF is in Supplementary Appendix Y. \n \nD. \n \n70. \nThe capacity development activities under the Project and the continued policy dialogue \nwith  the  municipal  government  during  its  implementation,  as  well  as  under  the  TA  4912-PRC, \nwill  support  institutional  and  IWRM  reforms  that  will  facilitate  the  achievement  of  the  overall \ndevelopment  goal  for  the  Project.  The  Project  will  not  only  improve  water  services  but  also \nfacilitate the introduction of IWRM. It will help implement a subset of the measures identified in \nthe  Master  Plan  that  are  mainly  structural  but  clearly  linked  to  identified  water  management \nproblems  and  overall  economic  development  goals  of  GMG.  Nonstructural  measures  will  be \nsupported under both the Project and TA, and mainly comprise capacity development activities \nto  promote  the  use  of  IWRM;  support  the  introduction  of  related  institutional  reforms;  and \nestablish  participatory  approaches  for  the  design  and  management  of  water  projects,  water \nallocations, and water sector planning. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nE. \n \n71. \nThe economic analysis covers both the Project as a whole and the core subprojects. For \nthe Project, the analysis covers the economic rationale for government involvement, goals of the \nsector  development  plan,  and  the  design  of  the  sector  development  plan.  The  rationale  is \nsound, based on the sector analysis that has been performed in a manner consistent with ADB \nrequirements.27 A summary of the sector economic analysis is in Appendix 15. \n \nLeast-cost  analysis  based  largely  on  technical  evaluations  and  investment  cost \n72. \ncomparisons has been performed and is considered acceptable since the alternatives that are \nconsidered  involve  familiar  technologies  and  provide  similar  levels  of  benefit.  Economic \nanalyses were undertaken to determine subprojects\u2019 economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) \nin accordance with ADB guidelines.28 Alternative cropping patterns were modeled for both rain-\nfed  and  irrigated  systems  based  on  crop  production  data  obtained  from  a  survey  of  300  rural \nhouseholds distributed across the irrigation subproject areas. All of the core subprojects, except \nthe  Liaojiuzhai  reservoir  subproject,  have  EIRR  values  equal  to  or  greater  than  12%.  For  the \nLiaojiuzhai  reservoir  subproject,  the  EIRR  equals  10%  and  it  is  believed  that  there  are \nadequate, non-quantifiable benefits of at least 2% that allow the subproject\u2019s EIRR to surpass \nthe 12% threshold. For economic viability, subproject selection criteria (Appendix 8) for noncore \nsubprojects  were  devised  to  ensure  that  those  with  lower  prospects  of  economic  viability  are \nexcluded from consideration for financing under the Project. \n \nF. \n \nThe  financial  evaluation  of  the  core  subprojects  was  undertaken  in  real  terms  using \n73. \nconstant  2009  prices.  Financial  projections  were  made  at  the  subproject  level  involving  urban \nwater  supply,  rural  domestic  water  supply,  and  irrigation.  The  project  cost  estimates  and \nfinancial  projections  in  nominal  terms  after  tax  were  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for \nforeign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. The estimated financial internal rates of \nreturn  exceed  the  after-tax  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  for  the  revenue-generating \nsubprojects, and sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the financial internal rates of return \nare robust under adverse conditions.  \n \n74. \nFinancial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  Guiyang  Zhushui  Water  Resources \nDevelopment Company, Guiyang water supply company (WSC), Wudang WSC, Xiuwen County \nWSC,  Jinlong  reservoir  subproject,  Liaojiuzhai  reservoir  subproject,  and  the  Wudang  irrigation \nrehabilitation  subproject  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Financial  Governance  and \nManagement  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  (footnote  20).  The  projected  financial \nstatements  indicate  that  revenues  will  be  sufficient  to  finance  O&M  costs  and  debt  service \ncoverage, and provide reasonable rates of return in all cases except the Jinlong reservoir and \nthe Liaojiuzhai reservoir subprojects. Based on the financial projections, these entities generally \nmeet the accepted target values with respect to the minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1:4, \na  maximum  debt\u2013equity  ratio  of  70:30,  and  a  minimum  current  ratio  of  1:0.  All  subprojects \nexcept Liaojiuzhai and Jinlong are therefore considered financially acceptable and sustainable. \nThe  Liaojiuzhai  reservoir  subproject  will  require  a  small  ongoing  subsidy  to  be  financially \nsustainable.  The  Jinlong  reservoir  subproject,  while  financially  viable,  will  experience  some \n\n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2005.

Discussion  on  the  tariff  issue  is \nsummarized in Appendix 15.    \n \n75. \nThe assessment of willingness to pay based on households for urban and rural domestic \nwater  supplies  and  of  net  income  from  improved  crop  production  indicates  that  beneficiaries \nwould  accept  proposed  tariff  increases.  Willingness  to  pay  is  estimated  at  about CNY4 per m3 \nfor domestic use. Expenditure shares are calculated before accounting for the water bill waiver \nfor registered poor households, and in all cases, with-project water supply costs constitute less \nthan 5% of household expenditure. \n \nG. \n \n76. \nThe Project has several potential environmental, institutional, financial, and policy risks \nrelated  to  (i)  drought  and  excessive  climate  variation,  (ii)  rural  to  urban  migration  exceeding \nforecasts, (iii) unforeseen physical conditions that could affect construction costs and schedules, \nand  (iv)  resistance  to  water  tariff  reforms.  Important  assumptions  include  the  following:  (i)  the \nGovernment\u2019s  program  for  sustainable  development  is  continued;  (ii)  effective  agriculture \nextension  support  is  provided  to  farmers;  (iii)  a  participatory  approach  to  water  resources \nmanagement  is  continued  to  be  adopted;  (iv)  incentives  for  effective  interagency  coordination \nare introduced; (v) financing is identified for other  activities in the Master Plan; (vi) community \nsupport,  including  through  the  establishment  of  WUAs,  can  be  enlisted  to  help  construct  and \nmaintain  rural  water  infrastructure;  and  (vii)  mitigation  measures  to  protect  water  quality  are  \nundertaken by neighboring administrative jurisdictions.   \n \n77. \nThe  Project  includes  measures  to  mitigate  these  risks  and  verify  assumptions  that \ninclude (i) extensive stakeholder consultation during the design of subprojects; (ii) regular tariff \nreviews  and  adjustments  by  the  Government  following  national  guidelines  as  well  as  public \nawareness  programs;  (iii)  an  examination  of  the  GMG  budget  to  assess  availability  of \ncounterpart funding; (iv) formal commitment from GMG to introduce IWRM-based reforms; and \n(v) implementation of training, capacity development, and community support programs.  ADB \nreview missions will monitor compliance with the financial and operational covenants to ensure \nfinancial  sustainability  of  the  water  utility  companies.  Experienced  national  and  international \nconsultants  will  provide  advice  and  support  to  mitigate  specific  construction  and  other \nimplementation risks.  \n \nH. \n \n78. \nThe  Project  is  critical  to  keeping  Guiyang  Municipality\u2019s  water  supply  and  demand  in \nbalance  to  facilitate  continued  and  sustainable  economic  growth,  which  is  the  overall \ndevelopment  goal  of  GMG.  Analysis  during  project  preparation  suggests  that  the  economic \nviability of the subprojects that augment urban and rural household water supplies are easy to \ndemonstrate, but the economic justification of the subprojects providing mainly irrigation water \nhas a more marginal economic justification. In overall terms, collective project benefits outweigh \ncosts in both financial and social terms. The implementation of resettlement plans in accordance \nwith  PRC  and  ADB  policies  will  protect  persons  adversely  affected  by  the  Project,  and  the \napplication  of  PRC  and  ADB  environmental  safeguards  will  minimize  adverse  environmental \nimpacts.  \n \n\nOverall Assessment \n\n\f \n\n23\n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nA. \n \n79. \nfollowing specific assurances, which have been incorporated in the draft legal documents: \n\nSpecific Assurances \n \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GMG  have  given  the \n\n \n1. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIntegrated Water Resources Management \n\nGMG  will  ensure  that  the  principles  of  IWRM  under  the  Master  Plan  and \ndeveloped  under  the  TA  for  Strengthening  Water  Resources  Management  in \nGuiyang are carried out under the Project. In particular, GMG will ensure that the \nIWRM  strategic  action  plan  agreed  between  GMG  and  ADB  (Supplementary \nAppendix S) is implemented in a timely manner. Key activities to be implemented \nwill include (a) establishment of an effective water sector management structure, \n(b)  shift  from  the  current  supply  management  to  demand  management,  (c) \ngreater public participation in water resources management, (d) improvement in \ninformation management and sharing among relevant agencies, and (e) capacity \nbuilding in water management in Guiyang Municipality.  \nGMG  will  ensure  that  the  subproject  selection  criteria  and  implementation \nprocedures  (including  prior  ADB  approval  requirements)  agreed  upon  with  ADB \nare  followed,  including  environmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements  under \nthe EARF, EMP, resettlement framework, and EMDF.  \n\n(iv) \n\ninvolving \n\n(iii)  Within  3  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness  date,  GMG  will  appoint  a  dam  safety \npanel  of  eminent  national  engineers,  which  will  review  the  detailed  design  of \nproposed  subprojects \nthe  construction  of  dams,  oversee  dam \nconstruction,  and  confirm  to  ADB  that  the  design  and  construction  of  the  dams \nmeet international safety standards. \nGMG  will  itself  cause  the  finance  and  price  bureaus  of  each  local  county \nparticipating  in  the  Project,  to  undertake  annual  reviews  of  water  tariffs,  and  to \nestablish  tariffs  based  on  financial  and  economic  objectives  (including  the \nfinancial sustainability of water services, and the use of price as a water demand \nmanagement  tool  where  appropriate),  subject  to  compliance  with  laws  and \nregulations  in  the  PRC.  In  the  event  the  tariff  is  not  set  at  a  level  allowing  for \nfinancial  viability  and  sustainability  of  a  subproject,  GMG  will  ensure  that  the \ncounty governments will provide the necessary subsidy. For urban water supply, \ntariffs will be established, and if necessary, adjusted to ensure full repayment of \nO&M,  interest  charges,  the  greater  of  depreciation  or  debt  repayment,  and  a \nreasonable profit margin. \nGMG will ensure that each local county government (through its poverty bureau): \n(a) reviews the impact of increased water and wastewater tariffs on the poor, and \nin  urban  areas;  and  (b)  maintains  the  provision  of  the  water  tariff  waiver  under \nminimum living standard scheme to protect the basic living standard of the poor.  \nGMG will ensure that WUAs are established in a timely manner for all reservoir \nand irrigation core and noncore subprojects.  \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n2. \n \n(i) \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\nGMG,  through  the  relevant  local  governments  and  IAs,  will  ensure  that  (a)  all \nland  and  rights-of-way  required  by  the  Project  are  made  available  in  a  timely \nmanner; (b) the resettlement framework and resettlement plans are implemented \n\n \n\n\f 24 \n\nto  participate \n\npromptly in accordance with their terms, all applicable PRC laws and regulations, \nand  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995);  (c)  all  affected  persons  are \ngiven  adequate  opportunity \nin  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation;  (d)  counterpart  funds  are  provided  on  a  timely  basis  for  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities;  (e)  any  financial  obligations  in  excess  of \nthe  resettlement  plan  budget  estimates  are  met;  and  (f)  compensation  and \nresettlement assistance are given to the affected persons prior to dispossession \nand displacement to ensure that those affected will be at least as well off as they \nwould have been in the absence of the Project.  \nGMG,  through  the  local  level  PIOs,  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  resettlement  plans \nprepared  for  the  core  subprojects  are  updated  based  on  detailed  designs, \ndisclosed to the affected persons and resubmitted to ADB for concurrence prior \nto commencement of civil works; (b) resettlement plans for noncore subprojects \nare  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  framework  based  on  detailed \ndesign, disclosed to affected persons, and submitted to ADB for approval prior to \ncommencement of civil works; and (c) ADB is advised of any significant material \nchanges  in  project  scope  or  other  causes  and  this  is  reflected  in  an  updated \nresettlement  plan  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  its  approval.  With  respect  to  any \nupdated resettlement plans, GMG will disclose such updated resettlement plans \nto affected persons prior to ADB approval. \nGMG,  through  the  Guiyang  PMO,  will  ensure  that  (a)  adequate  staff  and \nresources are committed to resettlement monitoring and supervision, and ADB is \nprovided with quarterly reports on implementation, and a resettlement completion \nreport for all the reservoir subprojects; (b) an independent agency acceptable to \nADB  is  engaged  to  monitor  and  report  progress  semiannually,  and  to  evaluate \nresults through annual survey updates and reports for 2 years after completion of \nresettlement;  (c)  external  monitoring  reports  are  submitted  to  ADB  and  the \nGuiyang  PMO  for  review  and  comments;  and  (d)  a  summary  of  the  final \nresettlement audit for the Yudongxia reservoir subproject is provided to ADB.  \nGMG will ensure that the GAP is implemented in a timely manner over the entire \nproject  period,  and  that  adequate  resources  are  allocated  for  this  purpose. \nImplementation  of  the  GAP  will  be  closely  monitored,  and  progress  will  be \nreported in the quarterly progress reports submitted to ADB. \n\nEnvironment Management \n\nFor  those  water  supply  dam  subprojects,  particularly  the  Yudongxia  dam,  GMG \nwill  ensure  an  appropriate  classification  of  environmental  protection  zone  and \ndetermine  and  stipulate  related  regulations  for  preserving  water  quality  of  the \nrespective reservoir. Such regulations may include land use zoning and control of \nchemical  fertilizers/pesticides  use,  wastewater  discharge,  and  aquaculture \ndevelopment  in  the  environmental  protection  zone  area.  To  ensure  the \npreservation  of  the  income  and  livelihood  of  local  communities  that  may  be \naffected  by  such  regulations,  GMG  will  ensure  that  a  PES  mechanism  to \nmaintain the agreed level of water quality by providing sufficient compensation to \nupstream government and affected communities is established and implemented. \nGMG  will  cause  each  local  government  and  the  IAs  to  construct,  operate, \nmaintain,  and  monitor  the  project  facilities  in  strict  conformity  with  (a)  all \napplicable  laws  and  regulations,  including  national  and  local  regulations  and \nstandards  for  environmental  protection,  health,  labor,  and  occupational  safety; \nand  (b)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  the  environmental  mitigation  and \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n3. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n4. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\nmonitoring  measures  detailed \nexaminations, SEIA, SIEE, and EMP for the Project. \n\nthe  approved  EIAs, \n\nin \n\ninitial  environment \n\nOthers \n\nThe PMO, in consultation with the IAs, will prepare and submit to ADB for review \nand concurrence, a training plan for informing (e.g., on IWRM principles such as \nwater sharing) and empowering local communities to be implemented under the \nProject.  \nGMG will ensure that proper financial management systems are established and \nimplemented  by  the  IAs  in  accordance  with  domestic  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects,  and  the \ncustomized  financial  management  manual  prepared  for  the  Project,  and \nincorporating domestic regulations and ADB policies and requirements. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n80. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$150,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Guiyang  Integrated  Water  Resources \nManagement  (Sector)  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  26  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  6  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n7 October 2009 \n \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n       Appendix 1 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n\n \nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \nDesign Summary \nImpact \nSustainable and \ninclusive socioeconomic \ngrowth in Guiyang \nMunicipality \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\n \nGross value of agricultural \nproduction increases from \nCNY3.8 billion in 2006 to \nCNY6.1 billion by 2020 \n\n \nGuiyang Municipality \ngovernment statistics \n \n\nAssumptions \nGovernment continues to \npromote sustainable \ndevelopment  \n\nFarmers have access to \nadequate rural financing and \nmarketing infrastructure \n\n \nRisks \nDrought and excessive \nclimate variation  \nRural to urban migration of \npeople exceeds forecasts \n\nAssumptions \nGovernment encourages a \nparticipatory approach to \nwater resources management \n\nIncentives for effective \ninteragency coordination are \nintroduced \n\nFinancing is identified for the \nother activities under the \nMaster Plan \n\nRisk \nResistance to tariff reforms \nAssumptions \nCommunity support can be \nenlisted to help construct and \nmaintain rural water \ninfrastructure \n \nPollution control measures to \nbe paid by the wastewater \ngenerators \n \nThe EMPs, RPs, and EMDPs \nare adequately carried out \n \nRisk \nUnforeseen ground and \nconstruction conditions \n  \n  \n\nRural poverty incidence in \nGuiyang Municipality is \nreduced to 20% by 2020 \ncompared with 2004 poverty \nincidence of 28.7%a  \n\nUrban poverty incidence in \nGuiyang Municipality is \nreduced to 3.0% by 2020 \ncompared with 2004 poverty \nincidence of 4.3%  \n\nOutcome  \nWater supply and \ndemand in Guiyang \nMunicipality are \nbalanced in a \nsustainable manner \n \n\n \nTotal available water \nresources increase from \n0.9 billion m3 per year to \n1.4 billion m3 per year by \n2016 \n \n94% of surface water quality \ntargets met by 2016  \n \nNo adverse cumulative \nenvironment impacts reported \nas a result of project activities \n\n \nWRB statistics \nGuiyang Municipality \ngovernment statistics \nEPB monitoring data \nTA 4912-PRC completion \nreport \nProject completion report \nEPB monitoring data \n \n \n\n \nWRB statistics \n\nInternal and external \nmonitoring and evaluation \nreports of EMPs, RPs, GAP, \nand EMDPs \n\nWater saving office data \n\nWater supply company data \n\nProject progress reports \n\nOutputs \n1.

The  capital  of  the  province,  Guiyang  Municipality,  is  its  political,  economic,  cultural, \ntechnical,  and  service  center,  and  a  major  transportation  hub  of  southwest  PRC.  In  2008, \nGuiyang Municipality has an estimated population of about 3.6 million, of which about 2.4 million \nreside in the main urban area, with the remaining 1.2 million in suburban or rural areas. About \n574,000 people (16% of the total population) are ethnic minorities who mainly reside in the rural \nareas. The income disparity between the rural and urban population is high and about 25% of \nthe rural population lives on an income of less than CNY1,200 ($176) per capita per year. Like \nmany  other  areas  in  the  PRC,  Guiyang  Municipality  is  undergoing  rapid  urbanization  with  the \nurban population increasing at over 3% per annum, while the rural population is decreasing at \nan annual rate of 1.6%\u2014a trend that is likely to continue. \n \n2. \nGuiyang  Municipality  is  one  of  the  PRC\u2019s  major  producers  of  nonferrous  metals  and \ntobacco; and major industries include machinery, steel making, food processing, and chemicals. \nThe  total  gross  domestic  product  of  Guiyang  Municipality  in  2008  was  equivalent  to  about \nCNY81.1  billion,  of  which  the  tertiary  (service)  sector  accounted  for  46.69%,  the  secondary \n(manufacturing) sector for about 47%, and the primary (mining and agriculture) sector for about \n6%. However, the primary sector is much more important in terms of employment, accounting \nfor 34% of recorded employment in Guiyang Municipality.  \n \nB. \n\nWater Resources System in Guiyang Municipality \n\n3. \nIn the context of integrated water resources management (IWRM), the water resources \nsystem  (WRS)  comprises  (i)  the  natural  resources  system\u2014the  natural  resources  and  related \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  the  socioeconomic  system\u2014the  water-using  and  water-related  human \nactivities;  and  (iii)  the  administrative  and  institutional  system\u2014the  system  of  administration, \nlegislation, and regulation, including the authorities responsible for the management of the WRS \nand the implementation of laws and regulations.1 Major problems and constraints in the context \nof IWRM in Guiyang Municipality, and the cause\u2013effect relationship are provided in a problem \ntree in Supplementary Appendix V. \n \nNatural  resources  system  of  WRS  in  Guiyang  Municipality.  Both  urban  and  rural \n4. \nareas  of  Guiyang  Municipality  are  on  the  mountainous  ridge  of  the  watershed  boundary \nbetween  the  Yangtze  River  basin  to  the  north,  which  drains  about  95%  of  the  area,  and  the \nPearl  River  basin  to  the  south.  Annual  average  precipitation  is  quite  high  at  1,096 millimeters, \nbut large evaporative losses and uneven distribution present particular challenges for capturing \nand storing water. The total annual renewable freshwater supply is estimated at 8.8 billion cubic \nmeters  (m3),  almost  half  of  which  evaporates  because  of  the  poor  vegetative  cover  and  rocky \nterrain of the catchment areas. The remaining water drains into rivers (4.5 billion m3 or 51% of \n\n                                                 \n1  This definition of WRS covers the aspects that are essential for natural resources management: demand, supply, \nand control of the resources. The natural resources system refers to the supply side of the system (resource base) \nand the socioeconomic system to the demand side. The control of both sides is provided by the administrative and \ninstitutional  system  (AIS). The  external  natural  boundaries  of  the  natural  resources  system  usually  consist  of  the \nwater that divides the catchment area, boundaries of the groundwater aquifer(s) belonging to this catchment area \nand the point where the river or canal discharges into the sea. The geographical boundaries of the socioeconomic \nsystem  and  the  AIS  vary  depending  on  what  part  of  the  socioeconomic  system  is  considered  essential  for \nmanaging and assessing the impacts of the WRS. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nincreased  water  demand \n\nin  Guiyang  Municipality  means \n\ntotal precipitation) as quick surface flows through numerous short creeks and streams that run \ndeep in valleys, or through fast-flowing deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) through the limestone \nlayers  (karst  areas).  Local  surface  and  underground  water  resources  average  1,300  m3  per \ncapita.  This  compares  poorly  with  the  PRC  average  of  1,700 m3 per  capita.  To  illustrate  these \nchallenges: (i) 85% falls from May to September; (ii) only 4.5% falls from December to February; \n(iii) annual fluctuations with a 100% difference (i.e., a 1:2 ratio) between a low rainfall year and a \nhigh  rainfall  year;  and  (iv)  northern  Guiyang  Municipality  only  receives  60%  of  the  amount  of \nrain that falls in the south. \n \n5. \nSocioeconomic system of WRS in Guiyang Municipality. As the economic hub of the \nprovince, Guiyang Municipality has a rapidly increasing population and industrial development, \nand  hence  increasing  demand  for  water.  Servicing  this  population  and  related  municipal  and \nindustrial  water  demands  is  putting  a  severe  strain  on  the  existing  water  supply  facilities. \nUrbanization \nfor  household, \ncommercial, and industrial use. Water quality in local rivers and water sources is also a growing \nconcern.  \n \n6. \nThe Guiyang Municipality urban water supply infrastructure is old and in poor condition, \nwater pressures are declining, and the supply is rationed in dry periods. Industrial recycling fails \nto  meet  the  PRC  targets  of  75%  and  nonrevenue  water  is  believed  to  be  high,  probably  over \n30%  on  average.  Increased  urbanization  is  generating  increased  volumes  of  wastewater  and \ncurrently only about 10% is treated. \n \n7. \nIn rural areas of Guiyang Municipality, only 50% of homes have piped water supply. In \nthe absence of public water supply systems, the majority of the rural population relies on local \nsprings  and  streams,  although  some  have  small  storage  structures  near  their  homes  for \ndomestic and livestock use. About 420,000 rural residents face potable water shortages. Most \nrural  water  is  needed  for  agricultural  purposes  (domestic  requirements  only  account  for  about \n10%).  However,  the  steep  mountainous  terrain  makes  it  is  very  difficult  for  farmers  to  obtain \nriver water or groundwater for irrigation, particularly at higher elevations.  \n \n8. \nAbout  10%  of  Guiyang  Municipality  land  area  is  arable,  only  24%  of  this  land  has \npotential  access  to  irrigation,  and  only  50%  of  cultivated  land  is  irrigated.  Consequently, \nirrigation coverage is currently only 0.3 mu per capita, lower than the national average of 0.8 mu \nper  capita.  It  is  estimated  that  production  from  the  50%  of  the  cultivated  area  that  is  irrigated \nsupplies  70%  of  production.  Surface  irrigation  systems  account  for  99%  of  the  irrigation  area. \nUp  to  40%  of  these  structures  have  been  abandoned,  and  28.8  kilometers  of  canals  are \ndamaged.  Water  conveyance  efficiency  in  larger  irrigation  schemes  is  estimated  to  average \n40%  and  on-farm  application  efficiency  about  90%,  implying  scheme  level  efficiencies  of  no \nmore  than  40%.  With  rehabilitation,  conveyance  efficiencies  of  74%  and  on-farm  application \nefficiencies of 95% are expected (scheme level 70%). Nonpoint source pollution from agriculture \nand rural point source pollution from livestock rearing are significant threats to water quality. Soil \nerosion  is  estimated  to  affect  about  2,600  square  kilometers  of  Guiyang  Municipality,  and \nwatershed management is urgently needed to conserve soil and protect water sources. \n \nAdministrative and institutional system of WRS in Guiyang Municipality. In recent \n9. \nyears, the PRC has recognized the need to improve the comprehensive management of water \nresources, applying approaches consistent with IWRM methodologies, and to shift the emphasis \nmore  toward  managing  demand,  including  the  use  of  economic  mechanisms.  A  crucial \nmilestone  along  this  path  was  reached  on  1  October  2002,  when  the  revised  Water  Law  was \nmade  effective,  and  in  which  added  emphasis  is  given  to  such  issues  as  water  resources \nplanning, protection of water resources, the economical use of water, the resolution of disputes \n\n \n\n\f30         Appendix 2 \n\nconcerning  water,  and  the  enforcement  of  water  use  regulations\u2014all  of  which  are  common \nwater resources management concerns. \n \n10. \nThe  case  for  solutions  based  on  the  principles  of  IWRM  becomes  stronger  as  water \ndemands  increase  and  potentially  compete  with  one  another.  Under  the  2002  Water  Law,  the \nresponsibilities of the river basin commissions2 and local water bureaus in respect to integrated \nwater resources planning have been strengthened. The 2002 Water Law also stipulates full cost \nrecovery for urban water services. In 2004, the China Council for International Cooperation on \nthe  Environment  and  Development  completed  an  important  policy  recommendation  entitled \nPromoting  Integrated  River  Basin  Management  and  Restoring  China\u2019s  Living  Rivers.3 Since \nthen,  the  challenges  associated  with  its  adoption  have  been  discussed  in  a  wide  variety  of \nforums,  including  the  Second  Yangtze  Forum  in  April  2007  and  the  Third  International  Yellow \nRiver Forum on Sustainable Water Resources Management and Delta Ecosystem Maintenance \nin October 2007.  \n \nA recent comprehensive review of progress in adopting the IWRM approach in the PRC4 \n11. \nconcluded  that  there  has  been  considerable  progress  but  there  is  still  a  long  way  to  go.  The \nreport set out detailed recommendations for medium- and long-term action in five main areas\u2014\nlegal and organizational reform, policy integration, IWRM master planning, public participation, \nand  science  and  technology  support\u2014making  it  clear  that  sustainable  IWRM  is  a  long-term \nprocess that takes many years to achieve. \n \n12. \nAs  in  other  provinces  and  municipalities,  Guiyang  Municipality  level  bureaus  are \nsubordinate  to  their  relevant  central  line  ministries  and  agencies.  For  example,  the  Guiyang \nWater  Resources  Bureau  is  subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  but  exercises  a \ncoordinating  role  over  water  resources  management  with  particular  responsibilities  for  water \nresource planning, water allocations, water conservation, flood control, and rural water supplies \nat  the  local  level.  At  the  municipal  level,  the  Urban  Construction  and  Urban  Management \nBureaus (under the Ministry of Housing and Urban/Rural Construction) are responsible for the \nmanagement  of  urban  water  supply,  drainage,  and  wastewater  treatment.  The  provincial  and \nmunicipal environmental protection bureaus play important regulatory and enforcement roles in \nenvironmental protection and pollution control. The provincial and municipal Development  and \nReform  Commission,  operating  as  the  local  subordinates  of  the  National  Development  and \nReform  Commission,  are  involved  in  the  approval  process  of  investment  projects  and  in  most \ncases are delegated authority for administering the PRC\u2019s Pricing Law (1997). Other ministries \nand  government  offices  at  the  provincial,  municipal,  and  lower  levels  (notably  agriculture, \nfinance,  health,  civil  affairs,  land,  trade  and  industry,  and  forestry)  are  also  involved  in  water \nsector issues.  \n \n13. \nAs  indicated  above,  the  current  management  of  the  Guiyang  water  sector  is  not  well \nintegrated.  There  is  vertical  fragmentation  with  different  responsibilities  between  provincial, \nmunicipal,  and  district  and  county  levels,  and  horizontal  fragmentation  with  responsibilities  for \nwater  sector  management  split  between  different  functional  departments  of  each  level  of \n\n                                                 \n2  Seven  river  basin-based  water  resources  commissions  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources \nwere  set  up  in  the  1950s  for  improving  water  resource  planning  and  coordinating  flood  control.  Most  of  Guiyang \nMunicipality  lies  in  the  Yangtze  river  basin  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Yangtze  River  Water  Resources \nCommission, with its headquarters in Wuhan. A small part of Guiyang is within the Pearl River catchment under the \njurisdiction of the Pearl River Water Resources Commission, with its headquarters in Guangzhou. \n\n3   China  Council  for  International  Cooperation  on  the  Environment  and  Development.  2004.

Both  types  of \nfragmentation  lead  to  problems  in  water  resources  management,  but  generally,  horizontal \nfragmentation  presents  more  difficult  problems  to  deal  with.  This  is  because  the  system  of \nfunctional  supervision  within  the  Government  of  the  PRC  allows  issues  caused  by  vertical \nfragmentation  to  be  resolved  more  easily\u2014although  this  does  not  always  happen  in  practice.  \nProblems  of  horizontal  fragmentation  have  the  following  major  institutional  and  technical \nimplications:  (i)  overlap  of  monitoring  functions  and  lack  of  data  sharing,  (ii)  inadequate \ncomprehensive  water  resources  planning  that  includes  other  sectors,  (iii)  pollution  control \nplanning  that  is  largely  unrelated  to  water  resources,  and  (iv)  lack  of  integration  of  function \nzoning with harmonization of quantity and discharge permitting. \n \nC. \n\nIntegrated Water Resource Management in Guiyang Municipality \n\n14. \nGuiyang  municipal  government  (GMG)  recognizes  this  movement  toward  IWRM,  and \nhas given a commitment to develop solutions based on IWRM. As a first step, it has prepared \nthe Guiyang Integrated Water Resources Master Plan (the Master Plan).   \n \n15.  Master  Plan.  There  is  a  good  potential  for  further  water  resource  development  to \novercome shortages in both rural and urban areas. The primary objective of the Master Plan is \nto  ensure  an  increase  in  available  water  resources  in  line  with  Guiyang  Municipality\u2019s \ndevelopment  needs.  The  Master  Plan  provides  a  comprehensive  review  of  water  needs  in \ndifferent  sectors,  including  urban  and  rural  domestic  water,  industrial  water,  hydropower, \nirrigation,  environmental  and  ecological  water  needs,  wastewater  treatment  and  reuse,  water \nsavings, and flood control. Analysis of soil and water conservation needs is also included. The \nMaster  Plan  presents  an  economically-sound  strategy  to  pursue  Guiyang  Municipality\u2019s  water \nresources  development,  and  covers  all  forms  of  water  use,  both  urban  and  rural,  including \ninitiatives to (i) develop new resources, (ii) improve irrigation facilities, (iii) manage demand and \nconserve  water,  (iv)  exercise  pollution  control  and  protect  existing  water  resources,  (v)  reform \ninstitutions, and (vi) introduce market-based measures to save water. \n \n16. \nAs  well  as  enhancing  total  available  water  resources,  the  Master  Plan  has  specific \ntargets to (i) extend rural water supplies to un-serviced areas, (ii) increase irrigation coverage, \nand  (iii)  treat  areas  subject  to  soil  erosion.  However,  while  the  Master  Plan  contains  a  large \nlisting of structural interventions, the level of attention given to resolving institutional constraints, \nand developing nonstructural interventions and practices in keeping with IWRM principles is less \nwell  developed.  This  situation  is  understandable  given  the  traditional  emphasis  to  supply  side \nwater resources planning in the PRC, and the relatively recent attention given to demand side \nsolutions. However, the Master Plan correctly identifies the priorities, which are to provide water \nto  un-serviced  or  under-provided  areas,  and  recognizes \nthese  priorities  require \npredominantly  structural  solutions,  albeit  with  greater  stakeholder  involvement  in  their  design \nand implementation.    \n \n17. \nGMG has established a project leading group to address cross-sectoral water issues. It \nseeks  to  develop  initiatives  under  the  PRC  \u201cwater  saving  society  program\u201d  and  is  in  dialogue \nwith  the  Guizhou  provincial  government  to  introduce  integrated  management  of  reservoirs  on \nNanming River. These initiatives will further the development of institutional capacity needed for \nIWRM,  as  well  as  fulfillment  of  the  sector  lending  criteria  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB).5  \n\nthat \n\n                                                 \n5  According to ADB guidelines for sector lending, criteria for applying the sector loan modality are as follows: (i) the \nborrowing  entity  has  a  sector  development  plan  to  meet  the  priority  development  needs  of  the  sector;  (ii)  the \nborrowing entity has the institutional capacity to implement the sector development plan; and (iii) if so required, the \npolicies applicable to the sector can be improved. \n\n \n\n\f32         Appendix 2 \n\n \n18. \nBesides the policies mentioned above, a favorable set of government policies to support \nimplementation of the Master Plan already exists in Guiyang Municipality, but increased efforts \nmust be made to ensure they are fully implemented. These policies include: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nestablishment  of  water  user  groups  and  increased  responsibilities  conferred  on \nindividual households and local communities (including asset ownership), rather \nthan the Government; \ngreater  attention  in  national  planning  to  rural  development  and  livelihood \nimprovement; \npublic services to be corporative and not provided directly by the Government; \nthe Government role should become that of an enabler and regulator of services; \nseparation of government and the management of enterprises; \nutility  services  to  be  financed  from  user  charges,  with  tariffs  set  in  accordance \nwith full cost recovery principles; and \ncompetition and private sector participation to be encouraged for both investment \nin infrastructure construction, and for operation and maintenance. \n\nPolicy  Dialogue  and  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  Strategic  Action \nPlan in Guiyang Municipality \n\n \nD.  \n\nThe ADB-supported Project will help GMG to implement the Master Plan and to promote \n19. \nthe implementation of improved water sector management based on IWRM principles. ADB will \nfinance a slice of the Master Plan, specifically in respect of five priority structural areas related \nto  (i)  alleviating  shortfalls  in  urban  water  supplies  resulting  from  increased  urbanization; \n(ii) improving rural water supplies for irrigation and domestic use, via small reservoirs; (iii) tanks \nto serve individual households; (iv) rehabilitation and construction of new irrigation infrastructure; \nand (v) soil conservation and water source protection measures.    \n \nTechnical assistance (TA) for IWRM6 reform commenced in April 2007 to introduce the \n20. \nIWRM approach and enhance the enabling institutional environment. Since TA implementation, \nthe following progress has been made: (i) Qingzhen City, as one of the cities in the project area, \nhas  successfully  institutionalized  IWRM  in  water  sector  management  by  establishing  the  city \nwater  authority\u2014all  of  the  water-related  management  functions  become  the  mandates  of  this \nnewly established city water authority, and the fragmented water management in this city will be \nsignificantly  improved;  (ii)  Guiyang  Municipality  was  selected  by  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources as a potential candidate municipality to pilot the water-saving society program, which \naims  to  promote  water  demand  management  nationwide;  and  (iii)  the  IWRM  strategic  action \nplan  (Supplementary  Appendix  S),  based  on  the  findings  of  the  TA  interim  report,  was \ndiscussed and agreed with GMG.  \n \nGMG will ensure that the IWRM strategic action plan is implemented in a timely manner. \n21. \nKey activities to be implemented in the strategic action plan include the following: (i) establish \nan  effective  water  sector  management  structure,  (ii)  shift  the  current  supply  management  to \ndemand management, (iii) promote participation in water resources management, (iv) improve \ninformation  management  and  sharing,  and  (v)  build  the  capacity  to  manage  water  in  Guiyang \nMunicipality. The plan will be implemented in conjunction with the Project from 2010 to 2016. \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2006.

IAs have been assigned the responsibility for project \n3. \npreparation  and  implementation  of  individual  subprojects  by  the  relevant  local  governments. \nMost  IAs  are  located  at  the  district/county  level  of  the  Government,  with  actual  infrastructure \nprovision  often  at  the  township  or  village  level.  This  characteristic  of  the  Project  has  two \nsignificant  implications.  First,  the  Project  includes  a  very  large  number  of  subprojects,  and \nsecond,  the  majority  of  participating  agencies  have  limited  or  no  previous  involvement  with \nforeign-funded  infrastructure  projects,  and  certainly  no  substantive  experience  of  Asian \nDevelopment Bank requirements.   \n \n4. \nIt  is  recognized  that  county  level  project  management  and  professional  skills  capacity \nare significantly less than the level of capacity found in municipal and provincial level cities. A \npartial counterbalance to this lack of capacity is the fact that most of the subprojects are small-\nscale, and use well-proven approaches and technology, with which the IAs are already familiar. \nHowever, the need for significant capacity building during loan implementation is acknowledged. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nAlthough  technical  capacity  at  the  county  level  is  weak,  there  is  a  strong  presence  of \nengineering institutes and construction supervision companies in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(including  Guiyang)  with  good  technical  capacity  able  to  undertake  project  design,  and \nsafeguard  owner  interests  in  construction.  These  institutes  and  companies  are  licensed  under \naccreditation  systems  designed  and  supervised  by  the  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  for  water \nconservancy  projects  and  by  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban  and  Rural  Construction  for \nurban  water  supply  projects.  Environmental  institutes  and  laboratories  were  able  to  prepare \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  and  monitor  compliance,  operating  under  a  similar \naccreditation system under the auspices of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Except for \nthe small-scale water supply subprojects, IAs will make extensive use of bought-in expertise to \ndesign and construct the project facilities, and pass on significant responsibilities to these expert \nagencies. \n \n6. \nTable  A6  provides  more  detailed  analysis  of  the  capacity  needed  for  the  main  project \npreparations and implementation activities, and of the support that will be provided to overcome \nexisting gaps and weaknesses in capacity.   \n\nCapacity Building Measures and Support to the Implementing Agencies \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nProject Stage \n(Phase) \nA.

The  FA  is  proposed  as  these  works  are  small \nand scattered in remote locations for which qualified construction firms are unlikely \nto bid at reasonable prices. The CP is a desirable method in these small subprojects \nto ensure sustainability and ownership of farmers and to achieve the Project\u2019s social \nbenefits  since  CP  can  (i)  call  for  the  participation  of  local  communities,  and \n(ii) employ labor-intensive and other appropriate technologies.  \n \nThe CP should be applied first so that it is only when CP would not be practical that \nFA would be considered as a last resort, particularly when the works are scattered in \nremote locations for which no local contractors express interest, and when no NGOs \nor  community-based  organizations  can  participate.  ADB  must  be  satisfied  that  the \nconstruction  facilities  are  efficient  and  the  executing  agency  and  implementing \nagencies are capable of undertaking the works quickly and to the required quality, at \nreasonable cost. \n\nCP = community participation, FA = force account, ICB = international competitive bidding, NCB = national \ncompetitive bidding. \n  \n\n2. \n\nADB Prior or

The  full \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nB.      Environment Categorization \n\n1.  \n\nCountry Environmental System Categorization1 \n\n2. \nFollowing  the  PRC  regulations,  the  Project  was  approved  by  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental  Protection 2 on  20  January  2009.  As  part  of  the  submitted  documents,  a \ngeneral  and  five  subprojects  environmental  assessment  reports  were  submitted.  The \nYudongxia  reservoir  core  subproject,  a  medium-sized  reservoir3 with  future  water  storage \ncapacity  of  18.6  million  cubic  meters  (m3)  is  classified  category  A  and a  full  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  report  has  been  prepared.  Following \nthe  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  categorization  criteria,  all  other  subprojects  involving  construction  of  smaller \nreservoirs,  irrigation  system  rehabilitation,  and  soil  conservation  subprojects,  regardless  of \ntheir contents and locations, have been classified category B. Environmental impact reports \n(EIRs)  for  each  category  B  subproject  were  prepared.  The  Guizhou  Environmental \nProtection  Bureau  (EPB)  and/or  Guiyang  municipality  EPB  were  granted  authority  by  the \nMinistry of Environmental Protection to review and approve the category B subprojects. For \nthe small water storage structure component of the Project, because of the small scale and \ninsignificant environmental impacts, environment category C is applied.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nADB Environment Categorization \n\n \n3. \nFor  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment  purposes,  the  Project  has  been  classified \ncategory  A.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  under  a  sector  loan  modality,  and  six  core \nsubprojects  have  been  prepared  to  ADB  standards.  Three  EIAs  for  core  reservoir \nsubprojects  and  three  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  the  other  core \nsubprojects were completed. These have been summarized in one summary environmental \nimpact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  one  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE), \nreviewed by ADB environmental specialists, and posted on the ADB website. \n \n4. \nADB  does  not  have  a  formal  policy  on  environmental  categorization  of  dams  and \nreservoir  projects,  but  its  historical  practice  is  to  assign  environmental  category  A  to \nreservoir projects that involve the construction of a dam higher than 15 meters or a reservoir \ncapacity  greater  than  3  million  m3.  This follows  the  International  Congress on  Large  Dams \nand the World Commission on Dams, and their worldwide categorization of large reservoirs \nbased on technical design and dam safety considerations.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  In  accordance  with  the  Environmental  Protection  Categorization  Directory  of  Construction  Projects  (State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, 1 March 2003), three categories are classified based on degrees of \nproject impacts on the environment: (i) category A: projects with potential for significant adverse environmental \nimpacts, (ii) category B: projects with some lesser adverse environmental impacts, and (iii) category C: projects \nunlikely to have adverse environmental impacts.  \n\n2  Formerly State Environmental Protection Administration. \n3  The  PRC  classifies  reservoirs  into  four  categories:  (i)  large-sized  reservoir:  water  storage  capacity \n> 100 million  m3,  (ii)  medium-sized  reservoir:  water  storage  capacity  ranging  from  10  million  m3  to \n100 million m3,  (iii)  small  type  I  reservoir:  water  storage  capacity  from  1  million  m3  to  10  million  m3,  and  (iv) \nsmall type II reservoir: water storage capacity from 100,000 m3 to 1 million m3 . The PRC EIA system classifies \nlarge- and medium-sized reservoirs category A projects.   \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                     Appendix 11                                             \n\n55\n\n3.  \n\nAlignment of ADB and Country System Environment Categorizations \n\n5. \nThere  are  differences  in  environmental  categorization  of  reservoir  subprojects \nbetween ADB and the PRC country system. ADB pays more attention to the dam safety by \nemphasizing  the  dam  height  while  the  PRC  country  system  focuses  more  on  reservoir \ncapacity. The dam safety is addressed separately in the PRC system. In conjunction with an \nindependent  dam  panel\u2019s  review  of  technical  and  dam  safety,  the  Project  introduces  a \npractical  categorization  approach  for  reservoir  subprojects  based  on  their  environmental \neffects  (i.e.,  impacts  of  downstream  flows,  groundwater,  protected  areas,  etc.)  rather  than \ntheir physical characteristics, particularly dam height and reservoir volume. These principles \nwere jointly developed by ADB, the Executing Agency, and EPB, and based on the results of \nfocus group meetings with local stakeholders (e.g., farmers\u2019 union, women\u2019s union, and local \ngovernment). \n \nThese  principles  will  be  upheld  through  a  transparent  and  inclusive  environmental \n6. \nscreening  process  for  each  subproject.  Every  reservoir  subproject  will,  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  be  subject  to  an  environmental  screening  process  by  an \nindependent  stakeholder  panel,  in  conjunction  with  an  independent  dam  panel\u2019s  review  of \ntechnical and dam safety considerations.  The independent stakeholder panel will comprise \nenvironmental  experts  of  at  least  the  Water  Resources  Bureau,  EPB,  and  the  Land \nResources  Bureau.  The  expert  screening  will  determine  whether  significant  environmental \nimpacts warrant a full EIA. English translations of screening results will be sent to ADB for \nreview  and  comments  prior  to  finalizing  subproject  categorization.  The  environmental \nscreening results will also be used to prepare the terms of reference for the environmental \nassessment. The detailed description is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nC. \n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment of Subprojects \n\n4.  \n\nResponsibilities and Procedure for Environmental Assessment \n\n \n7. \nWith the exception of the small water storage structures component, an EIR or EIA \nwill be prepared for each noncore subproject during project implementation. The EIR or EIA \nwill  include  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  with  mitigation  measures  and \nfinancial sources as prerequisites for approval. A monitoring and enforcement program will \nbe  developed  to  ensure  that  none  of  the  project  components  has  any  major  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Public  consultation will be conducted through interviews, meetings, \nor  surveys  as  part  of  subproject  environmental  assessment,  based  on  the  PRC  public \ninvolvement procedures and guidelines. The results will be documented and reflected in the \nEIR  or  EIA.  A  qualified  environmental  consultant  with  experience  in  ADB  environmental \npolicy will be recruited to assist the project management office (PMO) to review the EIRs and \nEIAs prepared for all noncore subprojects by the local certified agency. \n \n8. \nFor  the  small  water  storage  structures  component  of  the  Project,  all  subprojects \nunder this component will be classified category C. Neither EIAs nor IEEs (or EIRs) will be \nrequired  but  the  subprojects\u2019  contents,  locations,  surrounding  environments,  and  other \nsubproject  features  will  be  reviewed  by  the  PMO  with  the  assistance  of  a  qualified \nenvironmental specialist to ensure that impacts, if any, will be within the acceptable levels. \nMitigation  measures,  where  needed,  will  be  incorporated  into  the  subproject  engineering \ndesign. The PMO will submit a simple environmental review recommendation (in English) for \neach  subproject 4  to  ADB  for  record,  2  weeks  before  contract  award  or  implementation \nagreement approval, as appropriate.  \n \n9. \nThe  PMO  will  submit  a  summary  of  the  EIR  in  English  for  nine  subprojects  on \nrehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation schemes, and eight subprojects on soil conservation \n\n                                                 \n4   Defined  as a  package  of small  water structures  needed  to  address the requirements of  a village  or  group  of \n\nvillages. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n     Appendix 11 \n\nand protection of water resources to ADB for endorsement on a no-objection basis 4 weeks \nbefore contract award. \n \n10. \nFor  the  43  noncore  subprojects  involving  construction  of  small  reservoirs  for  rural \nwater  supply  and  irrigation,  either  EIRs  or  EIAs  will  be  conducted,  depending  on \nenvironmental categorization as noted above (para 6).   \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEIRs will be prepared following ADB\u2019s guidelines on the preparation of IEEs. \nThe PMO (assisted by the environmental consultant) will review the findings, \ndepth  of  assessment,  and  mitigation  and  management  plans,  as  well  as \nreport quality. If it is satisfied that these meet the relevant ADB requirements, \nand is also supported by the subproject report of the independent dam safety \nreview panel, an SIEE for each subproject will be prepared (in English), and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  review  6  weeks  before  subproject  implementation  and \ncontract  award.  In  cases  of  identified  significant  impacts  or  where  a \nsubproject category might be changed to category A, ADB will notify the PMO \nof  its  concerns  and  requirements  within  3  weeks  of  the  SIEE  submission.  If \nthere are particular issues raised or identified in the process of preparing the \nEIR and technical assessment of dam safety, (e.g., subprojects, while small in \nscale,  are  located  in  or  near  environmentally  or  socially  sensitive  areas,  or \nconcerns  of  dam  safety  are  raised),  the  subprojects  would  be  upgraded  to \ncategory A, and all the procedures and requirements needed for category A \nsubprojects will be triggered.  \nEIAs  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  and  guidelines.  The \nSEIA  in  English  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  5  months \nbefore subproject implementation. Each SEIA needs to be posted on the ADB \nwebsite for 120 days, as well as in the local language, and there needs to be \na second public consultation after the SEIA has been posted. ADB will review \nand  comment  on  the  SEIA  within  2  weeks  of  its  submission,  and  approve  it \nafter  all  comments  from  ADB  and  the  public  are  appropriately  taken  into \nconsideration.  \n\n \nSubmission of English translations of EIRs and EIAs for noncore subprojects will not \n11. \nbe  a  standard  requirement.  However,  (i)  ADB  will  reserve  the  right  to  require  English \ntranslation  of  EIAs  or  EIRs,  if  any  noncore  subproject  is  deemed  highly  sensitive  by  ADB; \nand  (ii)  a  copy  of  the  Chinese  language  of  EIAs  and  EIRs  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \nrecord,  together  with  the  English  language  version  of  the  SEIA,  summary  environmental \nimpact report, or SIEE.  \n \n12. \nADB\u2019s  East  Asia  Department  will  review  and  approve  the  SEIA  and/or  SIEE  in \nconsultation  with  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department.  To  mitigate  any \npotential  adverse  impacts,  identified  environmental  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the \nsubproject  design.  The  Guizhou  EPB  and  its  subordinate  offices  at  the  municipal,  county, \nand township levels will monitor environmental mitigation measures as detailed in the EMPs \nfor  various  components.  The  PMO  will  also  be  provided  additional  expertise  for  regular \nenvironmental  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting  during  project  implementation,  and  a \ncomposite  SIEE  for  all  category  B  subprojects.  IEEs  prepared  at  the  end  of  each  6-month \nperiod  will  be  prepared  (in  English)  and  submitted  as  part  of  the  required  6-month \nenvironmental reports. \n \n\n5.  \n\nEnvironmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n\n13. \nTo  implement  environmental  considerations  across  all  subprojects,  the  following \nenvironmental  criteria  have  been  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  Guiyang  municipal \ngovernment:  (i)  all  subprojects  shall  avoid  areas  with  defined  or  known  environmental \nsensitivities; (ii) subprojects requiring environmental assessment must follow the procedures \noutlined  in  this  report;  (iii)  reservoir,  small  water  storage,  and  irrigation  subprojects  shall \navoid  apparent  pollution  sources  to  minimize  the  risk  of  water  contamination,  and  ensure \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                     Appendix 11                                             \n\n57\n\nsafety  of  water  supply;  and  (iv)  subprojects  shall  be  selected  to  maximize  environmental \nbenefits and minimize adverse environmental impacts.  \n \n14. \nThe underlying limestone geology of the entire Guiyang region is fractured and tilted, \nand reservoir leakage is typically found in the karst formation. Consequently, environmental \nassessments  for  reservoir  subprojects  must  include  a  review  of  the  engineering  and \nconstruction techniques such as grout curtains, etc., to avoid or minimize reservoir leakage, \nraising  water  tables,  and  water  logging.  In  addition,  reservoir  subprojects  will  consider \necological water demand with appropriate project design in the allocation of water resources, \nand allow a minimum 10% ecological or in-stream water. Necessary mitigation measures will \nbe  considered  to  minimize  downstream  impacts  due  to  the  imbalance  of  ecological  water \ncaused by the subprojects. \n \n15. \nBesides site screening and initial site investigation, one of the effective measures to \nmeet  the  criteria  described  above  is  to  identify  and  conduct  an  analysis  of  alternatives. \nWhere  possible  and  appropriate,  noncore  subprojects,  multiple/alternative  sites,  designs, \nand/or  scales  shall  be  identified  and  evaluated  during  subproject  identification  and \nevaluation, to allow the selection of optimal or least-impact alternatives. PMO staff, assisted \nby  qualified  consultant  environmental  specialists  and  institutions  working  closely  with  the \nproject planners and engineers throughout the project identification and preparation stages, \nwill provide the needed input to ensure that environmental considerations will be included in \nthe decision-making process. \n \nB.   \n\nStaffing Requirements and Budget \n\n16.  Within  the  PMO,  a  Social,  Environmental,  and  Resettlement  Management  Division \nhas been  established  under  the  Project,  and  an  engineer  with  environmental  management \nbackground  will  be  assigned  to  coordinate  and  manage  the  environmental  performance  of \nthe  project  implementation.  His  or  her  responsibilities  will  be  to  ensure  compliance  with \nproject  regulations,  review  reports,  supervise,  and  coordinate  EMP  implementation;  and \nrecruit and guide external independent monitoring.  \n \nThe  PMO  and  ADB  have  agreed  that  an  environmental  management  regulation  for \n17. \nproject construction will provide the legal basis for the overall environmental management of \nthe  Project.  The  environmental  management  regulation  for  project  construction  will  be \ndeveloped  by  the  Social,  Environmental,  and  Resettlement  Management  Division  of  the \nPMO.  It  will  address  the  common  environmental  management  and  mitigation  requirements \nand issues of all subprojects, which will include, but not be limited to, a summary of (i) the \nmitigation measures presented in the EIA/EIR, (ii) the project EMP, (iii) the applicable PRC \nenvironmental regulation and standards presented in the EMP, and (iv) the requirements for \ntendering \nincorporation  of  environmental  considerations \ndocuments and contracts.  \n \n18. \nTo  ensure  EMP  implementation,  the  PMO  will  adopt  the  environmental  supervision \nengineer  mechanism  to  supervise  the  contractors\u2019  environmental  performance  and  with \ngovernment counterpart financing, employ a third-party or external environmental monitor to \nmonitor the key environmental parameters in the affected areas regularly. \n \n19. \nA  competent  environmental  specialist  (national  consultant,  18  person-months)  with \nrich  experience  in  environmental  policy  and  related  ADB  requirements,  will  be  recruited \nduring  project  implementation  to  assist  the  PMO  to  (i)  conduct  environmental  screening  of \nreservoir subprojects, (ii) review EIRs prepared by the local certified agency for all noncore \nsubprojects  involving  the  construction  of  reservoirs,  (iii)  prepare  SEIA  and/or  SIEE  and/or \nsummary  environmental  impact  report  in  English  for  each  noncore  subproject,  (iv)  provide \nguidance  to  the  PMO  and  subproject  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation  of  EMPs  for  all  components  or  subprojects  funded  under  the  Project,  and \n(v) provide training. \n \n\ninto  subproject  construction \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n    Appendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China/Guiyang Integrated Water Resources Management (Sector) Project \n\n \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nSector \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nEast Asia Department/ \nAgriculture,  Environment,  and  Natural  Resources \nDivision \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI. POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project is a key part of the Guiyang municipal government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty during the 11th Five-Year Plan, \nincluding  completing  the  provision  of  domestic  water  to  all  urban  and  rural  households  (including  all  ethnic  minority \nhouseholds),  and  increasing  irrigated  agriculture  area  per  household.  Integrated  improvements  in  water  resources \ninfrastructure and management will reduce non-income poverty caused by lack of reliable water and increase incomes \nfrom agriculture and industry, raising the productivity of labor, water, and land resources, while strengthening capacity to \nassure environmental water flows. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.     Key Issues  \nGuizhou Province is one of the poorest provinces in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), with the second lowest rural \nincome, and the lowest level of urban income of any province. The Project will provide water supply to enhance industrial \nand  agricultural  production  activities  in  some  of  the  poorest  and  most  underserved  rural  and  urban  areas  of  Guiyang \nMunicipality.  About  25%  of  the  rural  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line  (CNY1,200  per  capita  per  year).  The \nproposed  Project  would  cover  71  towns/townships  out  of  the  total  77  towns/townships  in  the  Guiyang  Municipality, \nincluding 18 \u201cpoverty\u201d towns/townships designated by Guizhou Province, five of which are designated class A \u201cpoverty\u201d \ntowns/townships with average annual income of less than CNY785 per person. \n \nGuiyang\u2019s  steep  limestone  terrain  means  that  rainfall  rapidly  runs  off  into  deeply  entrenched  rivers  or  infiltrates  the \nground.  For  many  months  of  the  year,  there  is  little  rain.  Most  springs  and  streams  only  flow  intermittently.  Urban \ngroundwater  is  already  overexploited  and  polluted,  and  rural  groundwater  resources  are  mostly  limited,  unreliable,  or \ninaccessible. Water is not easily available for use unless intercepted, stored, and delivered to where it is needed. \n \nIn  Guiyang  Municipality,  about  430,000  people,  primarily  in  rural  areas,  lack  satisfactory  domestic  water  supplies,  with \nthe burden of water collection falling mainly on women. Irrigated land is very limited, and lack of reliable irrigation limits \npotential for changing to more profitable cropping patterns. Future industrial investment and employment opportunities in \ncities and towns depend on the availability of improved water supplies. \n \n2.     Design Features  \nData on poverty and ethnic minorities will be considered in the prioritization of subprojects. Analysis of proposed changes \nin water tariffs includes recommendations about appropriate adjustments in the minimum livelihood program payments to \nsupport affordability of water for poor households. Community management of tertiary irrigation development and small \nwater  tank  construction  will  encourage  special  consideration  for  households  constrained  by  poverty  and  limited  labor \nresources. Improvements in water supply and irrigation management will help to secure reliable, accountable delivery of \nservices, including arrangements for communication and participation in decision making. \n\nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nGuizhou Province is one of the poorest provinces in the PRC, with the second lowest rural income and the lowest level of \nurban  income  of  any  province.  In  2008,  about  4.6%  of  the  municipality\u2019s  urban  population  and  about  3.9%  of  the \nmunicipality\u2019s rural population lived under the municipality\u2019s absolute poverty line for urban and rural areas, respectively, \nand  received  conditional  support  from  the  Government.  The  rural  population  considered  being  income-vulnerable  and \nliving at less than CNY1,200 per person per year was estimated at 25%. The Project covers 71 towns and townships out \nof  the total  77 towns and townships  in the Guiyang Municipality, including  18 \u201cpoverty\u201d  towns/townships  designated  by \nGuizhou Province, five of which are designated class A \u201cpoverty\u201d towns/townships with an average annual income of less \nthan  CNY785  per  person.  The  Project  has  specific  provisions  to  target  women  and  ethnic  minorities,  considered \nparticularly vulnerable. In Guiyang Municipality, about 430,000 people, primarily in rural areas, lack satisfactory domestic \nwater  supplies,  with  the  burden  of  water  collection  falling  mainly  on  women.  The  Project  will  provide  rural  households \nwith opportunities to improve their agricultural income by increasing the surface of irrigated land, allowing them to change \nfrom low-yield crops and subsistence farming to higher-value crops. The Project will also reduce non-income poverty by \nproviding reliable domestic water supply to households \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                     Appendix 12                                             \n\n59\n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nPrimary stakeholders include rural and urban households using domestic water, irrigators, and water-using enterprises, \nas  well  as  those  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Secondary  stakeholders  include  village  councils,  and \ngovernment  units  at  township  level  and  above,  particularly  water  resources  bureaus.  The  Project  supports  integrated \nwater  resources  management  (IWRM),  which  emphasizes  involvement  of  stakeholders  in  improving  governance  and \nmanagement of water resources. \n \nTwo rounds of public consultation roundtables were held during the preparation of feasibility studies reports (FSRs) for \neach  subproject.  For  each  subproject  with  irrigation,  a  further  consultation  will  be  held  with  irrigator  representatives  to \nparticipate in the preliminary and detailed design, form a water users association (WUA), and prepare for implementation \nof  operation  and  maintenance  where  the  WUA  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  irrigation  management.  Public \nconsultation meetings and stakeholder panels will provide forums for participation in multipurpose reservoir management \nand  river  sub-basin  planning.  Where  appropriate,  community-managed  modalities  will  be  used  for  implementation  of \nirrigation  canal  system  (particularly  tertiary  canals)  and  small  tank  construction.  The  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (TA)a conducted  urban  and  rural  household  surveys  and  interviews,  including  key  informant  interviews  and \nfemale and male focus group discussions.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  capacity  development  for  public  consultation  and  participatory  planning  targeting  the  project \nmanagement office (PMO) and local communities in the subproject area. A participatory strategy for noncore subprojects \nhas been developed (Supplementary Appendix K). \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Project focuses on improving water supply for domestic use and for irrigated agriculture (where women are playing \nan increasingly larger role because of higher male-out migration to the urban area). During the TA, interviews held with \nfemale and male focus groups confirmed priority needs for water, and showed interest and support from women and men \nin  greater  participation  in  water  management.  Public  consultation  roundtables  included  women,  and  showed  the \nimportance  of  a  proactive  approach  to  disseminating  information,  inviting  local  leaders,  and  selecting  convenient \nlocations. The Women\u2019s Federation will take part in project implementation through its involvement in the project leading \ngroup  at  the  municipal  and  district/county  levels,  and  ensure  women\u2019s  effective  participation  in  the  participatory \nconsultation at the village levels. It will contribute to define implementation modalities for small water tanks using lessons \nfrom its Mother Water Tanks Project.b  \n \n2.  Key Actions.

RPs will be \nprepared for all subprojects \nwith resettlement impacts. \nThe municipality includes \nabout 15% ethnic minority \npopulations. An ethnic \nminorities development \nframework, and four ethnic \nminorities development \nplans (EMDPs) were \nprepared under the TA. \nEMDPs will be required for \nall subprojects with \nsignificant impacts on \nethnic minority people, to \nensure their full \nparticipation in benefits \nand mitigation of negative \nimpacts. \nAdditional jobs will be \ncreated during construction \nworks.

Gender analysis \nwas done as part of project preparation to understand social conditions and identify ways in which the Project might have different impacts on \nwomen  and  men.  Specific  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  in  project  implementation,  and  access  to  project  opportunities  and  benefits \ninclude the following: \n \n \n\nSmall-Scale Reservoirs \n(Multipurpose) \n1.

Six  core  subprojects  have  been  selected  for  appraisal  and  early \nimplementation  during  the  project  preparations.  Of  the  core  subprojects,  the  Yudongxia \nreservoir  subproject  will  involve  a  relatively  large  amount  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  A  full  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  and  approved  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); a detailed resettlement plan was prepared and will be the basis \nfor  implementation.  Jinlong  reservoir  subproject,  Liaojiuzhai  reservoir  subproject,  and  the \nWudang  irrigation  rehabilitation  subproject  will  involve  relatively  small  amounts  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  so  three  short  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  and \napproved by ADB. These three core subproject resettlement plans may need to be updated \nbased  on  detailed  design,  disclosed  to  affected  persons,  and  resubmitted  to  ADB  prior  to \ncommencement  of  land  acquisition  and  civil  works.  For  the  other  two  core  subprojects, \nresettlement plans are not required since no involuntary resettlement is involved.  \n \n2. \nRegarding  noncore  subprojects,  about  six  to  eight  full  resettlement  plans  and  40  to \n42 short resettlement plans will be prepared in accordance with the resettlement framework \nfor  ADB  approval  prior  to  the  commencement  of  civil  works  for  each  subproject.  These \nresettlement plans should be prepared based on subproject design and resettlement impact \nsurveys.    \n \nB.   \n \n3. \nTo avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, there was close consultation \nwith the local officials, village committees, and affected persons during project planning and \nresettlement  plan  preparation.  The  core  subprojects  will  affect  23  villages  of  eight \ntownships/streets in Wudang District, Xiuwen County, Xifeng County of Guiyang Prefecture, \nand Longli County of Qiannan Prefecture. A total of 1,751 persons (including 2 enterprises \nwith 26 employees) will be affected directly by land acquisition, of which 200 persons need \ntheir  houses  to  be  relocated.  The core  subprojects  will  permanently  acquire  2,412.5  mu  of \nland, of which 1,118 mu (46%) is classified cultivated land. In addition, 432.7 mu of land will \nbe occupied temporarily during the construction phase, which affects another 292 persons. \nThere will be demolition of 29,403 square meters (m2) of residential housing and 5,897 m2 of \nnonresidential housing, including the two tourism enterprises. The impact details for the core \nsubprojects  are  summarized  in  Table  A14.1.  For  the  noncore  subprojects,  preliminary \nstudies estimate that 10,450 mu of land will be acquired, of which 4,800 mu is cultivated land \nthat  affects  the  livelihoods  of  4,524  people,  including  about  1,000  persons  that  need  their \nhouses to be relocated.   \n\nResettlement Impacts \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\n         Appendix 14 \n\nYudongxia \nSubproject \n\nJinlong \nSubproject  \n\nLiaojiuzhai \nSubproject \n\nWudang \nIrrigation \nRehabilitation \nSubproject \n\nWudang \nDistrict \nLongli \nCounty \n\nXiuwan \nCounty \n\nXifeng \nCounty \n\nShuitian \ntown, \nWudang \nDistrict \n \n\nTable A14.1:  Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts  \nof Core Subprojects \n\nSubproject \nName \n\nAffected \nAreas \n\nAffected \nTownships\n/Villages \n\nPermanent  \nLand \nAcquisition \n(mu) \n\nTemporary \nLand \nAcquisition \n(mu)  \n\nHouseholds/ \nEnterprises \n(m2) \n\nPermanently \nAffected \nPersons \n\n5/11 \n\n1,986.8 \n\n119.1  29,402.9/5,897.1 \n\n1,458 \n\n1/5 \n\n1/1 \n \n\n1/6 \n\n384.9 \n\n275.3 \n\n39.6 \n\n16.3 \n\n1.2 \n\n22.0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n61 \n\n185 \n\n47 \n\n        Total  \n\n8/23 \n\n2,412.5 \n\n432.7  29,402.9/5,897.1 \n\n1,751 \n\nto \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\nm2 = square meter. \nSources: Resettlement plans and Yudongxia resettlement outlines.  \n \nC. \n \nFor  people  unavoidably  affected,  the  resettlement  objective  is  to  achieve  equal  or \n4. \nbetter income and living standards in accordance with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nlaws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy. 1  Key  PRC  laws  and \nregulations  include  the  Land  Administrative  Law  of  the  PRC,  2004;  the  Decision  on \nReinforcing  Reform  in  Land  Administration  by  the  State  Council  (State  Council  [2004] \nNo. 28);  Ministry  of  Land  Resources  (MLR)  Guidelines  on  Improving  Land  Acquisition  and \nRelocation  Regulations  (MLR  Document  No.  238)  and  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement \nRegulation for Construction of Large and Medium-sized Water Conservancy Projects (State \nCouncil  [2006]  No.  471); 2 Regulations  on  the  Compensation  for  Land  Acquisition  and \nResettlement  with  regard \nthe  Construction  of  Large  and  Medium-sized  Water \nConservancy and Hydroelectric Projects (National Government [2006] No. 17); Current Land \nUse  Classification(GB/T21010\u20132007);  and  Specifications  on  Land  Requisition  and \nResettlement Design for Construction of Water Resources and Hydropower Project (SL290-\n2003).  Meanwhile,  Guizhou  Province  and  Guiyang  Municipality  also  issued  related \ndocuments.  All  these  documents  have  provided  essential  guidelines  for  resettlement  plan \npreparation.  All  persons  affected  by  the  Project  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  and \nassistance.  The  cut-off  date  for  eligibility  for  compensation  and  assistance  is  the  date  of \neach  subproject  approval by  local government,  which  will be  announced  immediately  to  all \naffected persons. \n \n5. \nBased  on  consultations  with  local  governments  and  affected  persons,  and  general \npractices  in  the  project  counties/cities,  a  set  of  resettlement  principles  was  adopted  by  the \nproject  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  These  include  the  following:  (i)  avoid  or  minimize \nresettlement,  wherever  feasible;  (ii)  the  compensation  and  titles  gained  by  the  affected \npersons shall at least enable them to maintain the same living standards as \u201cwithout project\u201d \nor  even  better;  (iii)  affected  persons  should  derive  some  direct  benefits  from  the  Project; \n(iv) all affected people regardless of the legal titles shall be entitled to receive compensation \nand  demolition  assistance;  (v)  the  resettlement  compensation  shall  ensure  all  affected \npersons  to  at  least  maintain  the  living  standards  as  before;  (vi)  if  the  remaining  land  after \nland  acquisition  fails  to  safeguard  the  livelihood  of  the  affected  persons,  compensation  in \nforms  of  cash  or  land  replacement,  plus  other  necessary  profit-earning  activities,  shall  be \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1995.

Income  losses \nresulting from reduced production/sales and wages caused by the Project will be assessed \nand compensated in cash. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe plans for livelihood rehabilitation and physical relocation have been included in \neach  resettlement  plan  to  ensure  their  livelihoods  and  living  standards  are  fully  restored. \nAccording to the economic characteristics of affected villages, different schemes for income \nrestoration  will  be  carried  out.  People  can  choose  the  options  according  to  their \nrequirements.  Since  the  resettlement  impacts  of  Jinlong  and  Liaojiuzhai  subprojects  are \nsmall,  the  affected  villages  and  affected  persons  will  be  directly  compensated  in  cash. \nRegarding the villages seriously affected by the Yudongxia subproject, additional strategies \nand measures (including adjustments to agriculture crops structure to more cash crops, land \nconsolidation, and developing tourism) will be considered and incorporated into the detailed \nresettlement  plan.  This  will  include  assistance  measures  such  as  provision  of  employment \nfor  project  construction,  provision  of  skills  training,  and  employment  information  will  be \nprovided  to  all  affected  persons,  including  50%  women.  In  addition,  the  persons  who  are \naffected by the Yudongxia subproject, a medium-size water conservancy project, are entitled \nto  post-stage  development  support  with  CNY600  per  capita  per  year  during  the  20  years \nfollowing project completion. Through these measures, all affected persons can maintain or \nacquire more stable incomes to restore and enhance their living standards.  \n \n8. \nRegarding  housing  demolition,  the  affected  owners  will  receive  compensation  at \nreplacement  cost  for  the  lost  structures  and  attachments  without  consideration  of \ndepreciation.  The  affected  households  can  rebuild  their  houses  by  themselves  with  a  free \nhouse plot provided by the village. Local government will approve the new housing sites and \nprovide local infrastructure prior to house construction. The affected persons can salvage the \nstructural materials and a moving subsidy will also be provided.  \n \nIn  addition,  special  attention  will  be  paid  to  vulnerable  groups  for  their  resettlement \n9. \nand rehabilitation. The vulnerable groups will receive additional assistance from the Project: \n(i) setting up special supporting funds in each subproject; (ii) providing potential employment \nopportunities  to  seriously  affected  vulnerable  groups,  especially  women;  and  (iii)  providing \nlabor support to the vulnerable group in house reconstruction and farming activities.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\n         Appendix 14 \n\nto \n\nResettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance \n\nE. \n \n10. \nThe  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  core  subprojects  is \nCNY116.3  million  in  2008  prices,  including  contingencies  and  land  taxes.  For  the  noncore \nsubprojects, the initial estimate for land acquisition and resettlement cost is CNY302 million. \nDetailed  measurement  surveys  will  be  conducted  in  each  village  and  enterprise;  and  the \ncompensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, households, \nand  enterprises.  On  this  basis,  the  final  costs  will  be  adjusted.  The  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  costs  are  included  as  part  of  the  total  project  cost  and  will  be  funded  by \nGuiyang  municipal  government  or  county/district  governments.  According \nthe \ncompensation  policies  and  standards  defined  in  the  resettlement  plans,  the  payment  and \nusage  of  compensation  funds  will  be  carried  out  under  the  supervision  of  the  internal \nmonitoring agencies, with regular audit and external monitoring agency reviews.  \n \nF. \n \n11. \nFor  the  core  subprojects,  the  people  affected  have  been  informed  about  the  key \nelements of land acquisition and resettlement through consultation during the planning stage \nand  distribution  of  resettlement  information.  On  various  occasions  during  meetings, \ninterviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community \nconsultation meetings, local representatives have participated in the planning and concerns \nhave been integrated into the resettlement plans. Once the project feasibility was approved, \nthe  resettlement  plans  were  finalized  and  disclosed  to  local  officials;  the  resettlement \ninformation  booklets  had  earlier  been  provided  to  the  17  affected  villages  and  affected \nhouseholds. The core subproject resettlement plans have been posted on the ADB website \nand the noncore subproject resettlement plan will also be uploaded upon ADB approval. The \nrelevant  IAs  will  establish  project  resettlement  units  for  supervising  implementation, \ncontinuing  public  consultation,  monitoring  progress,  and  responding  to  grievances.  The \ngrievance redress procedures are well established and explained in the resettlement plans. \n \nG. \n \n12. \nThe Guiyang project management office (PMO) will assume the overall responsibility \nfor  implementing  resettlement.  The  Social,  Environment,  and  Resettlement  Management \nDivision  of  the  PMO  will  coordinate  the  planning,  implementation,  and  reporting  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  progress.  For  the  core  subprojects,  the  IAs  are  Guiyang \nZhushui  Water  Resources  Development  Company  for  Yudongxia  subproject,  Xifeng  Water \nResources  Bureau  for  Liaojiuzhai  subproject,  Xiuwen  Water  Resources  Bureau  for  Jinlong \nsubproject,  and  Wudang  Water  Resources  Bureau  for  Wudang  Irrigation  subproject.  The \nsubproject  resettlement  offices  that  are  set  up  under  each  subproject  IA  will  take  primary \nresponsibility  for  the  resettlement  consultation,  implementation,  and  timely  delivery  of \nentitlements.  \n \nThe  resettlement  implementation  schedule  for  the  four  core  subprojects  was \n13. \nprepared  based  on \ntimetable.  The  actual \nimplementation  schedule  needs  to  be  revised  based  on  the  subsequent  approval  process. \nFor  core  subprojects,  preliminary  civil  works  will  commence  by  early  2010,  but  most \nlivelihood rehabilitation and house relocation does not have to be completed until reservoir \ninundation in 2011 or 2012. So even for the seriously affected villages, there is still adequate \ntime  for  social  preparation  and  detailed  implementation  planning.  The  PMO  and  IAs  have \nagreed  to  a  set  of  supervision  milestones  with  ADB  to  ensure  timely  and  effective \nimplementation of resettlement activities.  \n \n14. \nthe  resettlement \ncategorization.  For  the  subprojects  that  affect  less  than  200  people  (category  B),  a  short \nresettlement  plan  should  be  prepared;  subprojects  affecting  more  than  200  people \n\nThe  noncore  subprojects  will  be  assessed \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Schedule \n\nfeasibility  study  and  construction \n\nto  determine \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f \n67\n\n                                                                                                                               Appendix 14       \n\n             \n    \n(category A)  will  require  a  full  resettlement  plan.  Subproject  resettlement  plans  will  be \nprepared  based  on  preliminary  designs  and  impact  surveys,  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix I). Resettlement plans will be reviewed by \nthe  local  government  and  then  by  the  PMO,  with  the  assistance  of  a  national  resettlement \nexpert.  If  the  resettlement  plan  passes  the  review,  the  resettlement  plan  will  be  translated \nand  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  If  quality  improvements  are  needed,  the  resettlement \nexpert will specify requirements to be addressed by the IAs. Once revisions are made, the \nresettlement plan will be rechecked and then sent to ADB for approval. Only then can civil \nworks commence for each subproject. \n \nH. \n \n15. \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  of  resettlement  implementation  will  be  conducted. \nInternal supervision and monitoring will be done by each IA to ensure compliance with the \nprovisions of the resettlement plan. The IAs will report to the PMO and the PMO will prepare \na  summary  of  progress  to  be  included  in  the  quarterly  progress  report  sent  to  ADB.  The \nPMO  will  also  engage  an  independent  agency  for  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nThere  will  be  semiannual  monitoring  for  category  A  subprojects  and  annual  monitoring  for \nothers.  Once  resettlement  activities  are  completed,  annual  evaluations  will  then  be \nconducted twice (i.e., for 2 years) or longer if rehabilitation is not deemed to be completed \nsatisfactorily.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be  forwarded  directly  to  both  the  PMO  and \nADB for review, comments, and follow-up actions. \n \n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\n Appendix 15 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n\n \nA.   \n \n\nAnalysis of the Project \n\n1.  \n\nRationale for Public Intervention \n\n1. \nSector  analysis  shows  that  Guiyang  Municipality  is  short  of  water  supply  for  its \nresidential  uses  and  industrial  development,  despite  the  fact  that  the  average  rainfall \nexceeds  1,096  millimeters  per  annum.  Guiyang  Municipality  lies  on  the  mountainous \nwatershed that separates the Yangtze River Basin to the north from the Pearl River Basin to \nthe south, which makes it difficult for the rainwater to be captured and utilized. While there \nare adequate natural water resources in Guiyang Municipality, significant problems relate to \n(i) the capture of sufficient quantities of water and its distribution to users, (ii) the efficiency of \nwater  distribution  and  use,  and  (iii)  increasing  concerns  over  water  quality.  On  the  other \nhand,  Guiyang,  like  any  other  major  cities  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  is \nexperiencing  rapid  urbanization  and  industrialization.  The  demand  for  water  use  is \nincreasing rapidly.  \n \n2. \nThe  rationale  for  public  intervention  rests  on  evidence  of  market  and  nonmarket \nfailure.  Principal  market  failures  involve  natural  monopolies,  an  incomplete  assignment  of \nproperty rights in rural land, externalities, and the public-goods nature of information. Natural \nmonopoly service provision and pollution externalities exist in Guiyang Municipality, and are \nendemic  in  the  water  resources  sector  in  most  countries.  There  appear  to  be  no \neconomically-viable  alternative  sources  of  supply  of  the  envisioned  scale  for  the  proposed \nreservoirs.  These  facilities  are,  therefore,  natural  monopolies.  Moreover,  rapid  economic \ndevelopment is placing additional stress on the water environment and water resources, with \ncontinuing  government  intervention  necessary  to  ensure  development  of  adequate  water \nresources, equitable allocation of water, and its proper management. \n \n3. \nThe  failure  to  control  overland  flows  and  soil  erosion  in  Guiyang  Municipality  has  a \nnegative  impact  on  downslope  landowners  because  of  sedimentation  and  the  increased \nerosive force of flows as they descend. Sediment delivered to surface waters degrades the \nquality  of  those  waters,  diminishes  the  storage  capacity  of  reservoirs,  and  reduces  the \necological values and downstream use values of the resources. \n \n4. \nfarm  water  resources  management.  Farmers  are  allocated  farmland  by  their  village  for  a   \n30-year  period.  They  cannot  sell  the  land  and  they  lose  it  if  they  fail  to  work  on  it.  This \nrestricted  property  right  creates  a  disincentive  to  invest  adequately  in  erosion  control \nmeasures and to maintain irrigation works since the full benefits from the investments cannot \nbe realized in the form of appreciated land values. Even if farmers are motivated to improve \ncrop and water management, limited access to information poses a major barrier to action. \nBoth  irrigation  improvements  and  soil  erosion  control  measures  include  an  element  of \ncapacity development and training in soil and water management. Farmers do not have the \ncapacity  to  acquire  this  information  independently  but,  once  it  is  acquired  in  an  area,  the \ndemonstration  effect  can  lead  to  rapid  dissemination.  Implementation  of  the  proposed \nProject is based on the principles of integrated water resources management (IWRM), which \nwill help overcome property rights and information availability constraints.   \n \n5. \nPrivate sector participation could conceivably address certain cases of market failure. \nFor  example,  reservoir  operation  could  be  contracted  to  the  private  sector,  arrangements \ncould be made with a local bank to encourage microcredit, and some project activities could \nbe  delivered  using  service  contracts.  However,  these  measures  would  not  address  the \nmarket failures identified, and government involvement in the development and management \nof the Guiyang Municipality water sector is concluded to be both justified and necessary.  \n\nThe limited property rights granted to farmers weaken their incentive to invest in on-\n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                    Appendix 15                                            \n\n69\n\n2.  \n\nGoals of the Master Plan  \n\n6. \nThe  Guiyang  Municipal  Government  (GMG)  has  formulated  the  Guiyang  Integrated \nWater  Resources  (IWRM)  Master  Plan  (2006\u20132020,  the  Master  Plan),  which  covers  all \naspects of infrastructure needs while recognizing some of the deficiencies of current water \nsector  management  arrangements,  including  fragmented  institutional  arrangements  and \ninadequate attention to water demand management. The overall goal of the Master Plan is \nto  facilitate  economic  growth  in  Guiyang  Municipality  by  ensuring  that  (i)  there  is  sufficient \nwater  supply  to  meet  the  demand,  and  (ii) the  water  is  of  satisfactory  quality.  The  Master \nPlan describes the failure of existing water resources to support sustainable development of \nGuiyang  Municipality,  and  establishes  goals  to  improve  the  security  and  safety  of  supply, \nand achieve optimal allocation and efficient utilization of water resources through integrated \nresources  planning.  These  goals  support  the  achievement  of  the  Government\u2019s  broader \ngoals of sustainable economic development, rural development, and poverty alleviation, as \nstated  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  for  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  (2006\u2013\n2010). The water management goals are supported by an analysis of imbalances between \nwater  demand  and  water  supply  capacity.  Identified  capacity  problems  include  insufficient \nquantities  of  water,  uneven  geographic  and  seasonal  distribution  of  water  resources, \nimpairment  caused  by  poor  water  quality,  and  losses  caused  by  poor  infrastructure \nmaintenance  and  mismanagement.  Proposed  demand  and  supply  management  measures \ninclude a mix of structural and nonstructural approaches.  \n \nThe  overall  goal  and  objectives  of  the  Master  Plan  are  fully  compatible  with  ADB\u2019s \n7. \nWater  Policy 1  and  its  poverty  reduction  aims.  Poverty  reduction  will  be  achieved  by \nfacilitating  economic  growth  generally,  and  more  specifically,  through  rural  development \nactivities  which  will  address  the  widening  gap  in  wealth  between  urban  and  rural  areas. \nIndicators  to  measure  achievement  of  the  goals  are  described  in  the  project  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  (Appendix  1),  and  have  been  verified  as  being  readily  measurable \nusing existing government information resources. \n \n\n3.  \n\nDesign of the Master Plan and ADB\u2019s Role \n\n8. \nWhile the Master Plan has some shortcomings from the perspective of IWRM, they \ndo  not  invalidate  the  Master  Plan  but  present  an  opportunity  for  its  strengthening.  Key \nshortcomings include the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Master  Plan  is  largely  based  on  municipal  jurisdictions  rather  than \nwatersheds,  reflecting  institutional  constraints  related  to  the  jurisdictional \nauthority of GMG. \nThe  analysis  of  water  management  options  in  the  Master  Plan  presents \nstructural  measures  without  an  assessment  of alternatives.  The  assessment \nof alternatives only occurs at the stage of the preliminary engineering design \nwhere it is documented in the feasibility study reports.   \nSome  time-bound  goals  are  established  in  the  Master  Plan  but  specific \nmanagement measures are not identified. \n\n \n9. \nThe  Project  will  help  implement  a  subset  of  the  measures  identified  in  the  Master \nPlan.  These  are  mainly  structural  measures  focusing  on  urban  and  rural  water  supply \ncapacity  (supply  management),  irrigation  water  use  efficiency  (demand  management),  and \nprotection of source water quality through erosion control. In addition, capacity development \nactivities  to  be  conducted  under  the  Project  will  promote  the  use  of  IWRM;  support  the \nintroduction  of  related  institutional  reforms;  and  establish  participatory  approaches  for  the \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001.

An  overview  of  the  general  approach  for  the  economic  analysis  is  presented \nbelow and results are presented for each of the core subprojects. The six core subprojects \nrepresent  the  range  of  physical,  social,  and  economic  conditions  that  characterize  the \n65 candidate subprojects. The detailed economic analysis based on key areas of economic \nanalysis of sector loans2 is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. Economic and financial \nanalyses  of  the  six  core  subprojects  are  based  on  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nguidelines  for  the  economic  analysis  and  financial  governance  and  management  of \nprojects.3 \n \n\n2. \n\nAssumptions  \n\n11. \nFinancial  prices  used  in  the  analysis  were  identified  through  review  of  the  updated \ncost  estimates  of  the  provincial  design  institute,  including  estimates  of  unit  costs  and \nquantities. To assess each subproject\u2019s contribution to the PRC economy, it is necessary to \nconvert  financial  values  to  their  economic  equivalents.  Economic  valuations  exclude \ntransfers  from  one  part  of  the  economy  to  another  (i.e.,  taxes,  duties,  and  subsidies)  and \nattempt  to  facilitate  the  comparison  of  project  benefits  and  real  opportunity  costs  to  the \neconomy by translating all prices to a common, undistorted base. Assumptions used in the \neconomic analysis include:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nevaluation in real terms using 2009 prices and a domestic price numeraire;  \nan exchange rate of CNY6.85 per dollar;4 \nphysical contingencies computed at 5%;  \nidentification  and  valuation  of  major  economic  benefits  using  willingness-to-\npay and net farm income approaches; \nestimation of costs and benefits on a with- and without-project basis; \neconomic  costs  exclude  price  contingencies,  duties,  and  taxes  but  include \nphysical contingencies; and \nshadow  pricing  based  on  domestic  market  price  conversion  factors  and  a \nshadow exchange rate factor for tradable items. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nLeast Cost Analysis \n\n12. \nA  least-cost  analysis  of  the  core  subprojects  was  completed,  based  largely  on \ntechnical  evaluations  and  investment  cost  comparisons  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The \nproposed Project compares favorable to the alternatives that involved similar technologies, \nand  provided  similar  levels  of  benefit.  Noncore  subprojects  will  also  be  subjected  to  least-\ncost  analysis.  Selection  criteria  for  candidate  noncore  subprojects  are  designed  to  ensure \ncompatibility  with  economic  and  social  objectives  of  the  Master  Plan,  the  financial  and \neconomic viability of the subproject, optimization of project benefits, and the minimization or \nmitigation of adverse social and environmental impacts (Appendix 8).  \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2005.

Water supply benefits. The quantification of urban and rural domestic water supply \nimprovements is based on the user\u2019s willingness to pay (WTP). In the case of urban water \nsupplies, the estimate of WTP is a measure of consumers\u2019 surplus based on an estimated \nurban  demand  for  tap  water.  The  estimated  WTP  is  CNY4.1  per  cubic  meter  (m3)  for \ndomestic demand and CNY6.5/m3 for total demand.5 Rural domestic water demand includes \nboth household uses and livestock watering. An opportunity cost method based on the value \nof household time spent obtaining water is used to estimate WTP for this type of water. Rural \nlabor is based on local wage rates, and the time spent fetching water was estimated using \nrural  household  survey  data. 6 The  estimated  value  for  water  is  about  CNY12/m3.  Once \nsubprojects are fully developed, the total value of annual water supply benefits are expected \nto reach about CNY144 million.  \n \n14. \nIrrigation  benefits. The direct impacts of subprojects involving irrigation works and \nadoption  of  improvements  in  crop  production  methods  include  improved  reliability  of  water \nsupply  and  increased  area  that  can  be  irrigated.  The  benefits  of  these  subprojects  include \nhigher farm incomes, reduced economic risks, increased food security, improved long-term \nsustainability of crop production, improved health status, and increased household capacity \nto accumulate capital. This evaluation was based on modeling of crop production with and \nwithout  the  Project.  Crop  production  data  were  obtained  from  a  survey  of  300  rural \nhouseholds  in  the  irrigation  subproject  areas.  A  conversion  of  crop  systems  and  patterns \nwas  assumed  to  occur  with  completion  of  the  Project.  Investment  costs  include  a  budget \nallocation of 0.5% of the base investment cost to finance extension services to support this \nconversion. Estimates of average net increases in crop income are in Table A15.1. \n \n\nTable A15.1: Estimates of Average Net Increases in Crop Income \n\n86 \n\n488  \n\nIncrease in Net Crop \nIncome (CNY per mu) \n561  \n438   \n258  \n\nIncrease in Revenue from  \nCrop Production (%) \n82 \n82 \n19 \n\n \nSubproject \nJinlong Reservoir \nLiaojiuzhai Reservoir \nWudang Irrigation \nSystem \nXifeng Small Water \nStorage \nCNY = Chinese yuan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15. \nSoil  and  water  conservation  benefits.  Soil  and  water  conservation  measures \nproposed  in  the  Master  Plan  cover  a  total  area  of  800  square  kilometers  (km2).  Measures \ninclude farmland restructuring, terracing, water control structures, and permanent vegetative \ncover  (afforestation,  grasses,  and  fruit  trees).  The  Huaxi  water  and  soil  conservation  core \nsubproject  covers  about  15  km2  of  land  in  the  Nanming  River  watershed  upstream  of  the \nHuaxi  and  Songbai  reservoirs.  These  are  multipurpose  reservoirs  used  for  urban  water \nsupply (Guiyang municipality and satellite towns), hydropower, and irrigation. Benefits from \nthese  measures  include  increased  farm  incomes,  improved  food  security,  increased \nhousehold capacity to accumulate capital, reduced risk of illness from water-borne disease, \nimproved aesthetic quality of surface waters, reduced loss of reservoir storage capacity, and \nimproved  water  quality  at  downstream  sources  of  supply  for  urban  tap  water.  However, \nmany  of  the  off-site  benefits  will  have  a  cumulative  effect,  e.g.,  changes  in  downstream \nwater  quality  will  not  occur  until  a  large  part  of  the  watershed  is  treated  so  that  pollutant \nloadings fall below critical thresholds.   \n\n                                                 \n5  The analysis of urban water demand is provided in Supplementary Appendix C. \n6  The rural household survey is described in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\n Appendix 15 \n\n \n16.  While  off-site  benefits  and  indirect  on-site  benefits  were  identified,  only  changes  in \nfarm incomes were estimated. This was based on the modeling of crop production with and \nwithout  the  Project.  Crop  production  data  for  the  analysis  were  obtained  from  a  survey  of \n60 rural  households  in  the  subproject  area.  After  accounting  for  lands  treated  with \npermanent vegetative cover, 10,400 mu of land are available for sustainable crop production \nwith  the  core  subproject.  Without  the  Project,  a  relatively  small  portion  of  these  lands  are \ncropped on a subsistence basis, with cropping on a plot lasting only until the topsoil is lost to \nerosion. The average net crop income on these lands with the Project is CNY281 per mu.  \n \n\n5. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n17. \nFinancial  analysis  of  core  subprojects.  Financial  internal  rates  of return  (FIRRs) \nwere  not  calculated  for  the  Liaojiuzhai  small-scale  reservoir  subproject,  the  Xifeng  small \nwater  storage  subproject,  or  the  Huaxi  soil  and  water  conservation  subproject  since  these \nare not revenue generating. For all of the other core subprojects, base case FIRRs exceed \nthe weighted average cost of capital and are shown to be robust in the sensitivity analysis \n(Table A15.2). \n \n\nTable A15.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n\nWACC\n\nCore Subproject \n\n2.4 \n2.2 \n2.1 \n2.2 \n\n  FIRR \n    20-Year \n1.9 \n7.1 \n1.8 \n3.7 \n\n  FIRR \n    30-Year \nYudongxia Urban Water Supply, Reservoir \n3.9 \nYudongxia Urban Water Supply, Water Treatment Plant \n11.9 \nJinlong Small-Scale Reservoir \n2.4 \nWudang Irrigation System Rehabilitation  \n4.3 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return.

With  the  exception  of  Wudang  irrigation  system  rehabilitation  subproject,  all  of  the \nrevenue generating subprojects can achieve average rates of return to equity of 4% or more. \nThe  urban  retail  water  supply  company  (WSC)  receiving  wholesale  water  from  Jinlong \nreservoir also achieves comparable or higher rates of return. The Wudang irrigation system \nrehabilitation subproject achieves an average rate of return of 2%, which is compatible with \nthe state government policy for irrigation projects that are not expected to earn any profit.  \n \n19. \nStandard targets for financial performance include a minimum debt-service coverage \nratio  of  1:0,  a  maximum  debt\u2013equity  ratio  of  70:30,  and  a  minimum  current  ratio  of  1:0. \nFinancial  performance  ratios  for  subproject  operating  authorities  generally  meet  these \ntargets with the exception of Jinlong reservoir subproject, which has a debt-service coverage \nratio below 1:0 for most of the period of ADB debt servicing, and will require assistance to \novercome  cash  flow  difficulties.  This  is  strictly  a  cash  flow  problem  since  other  ratios, \nincluding profitability, are acceptable and can be overcome by water tariff increase in Xiuwen \ncounty as discussed in paras. 20-22.  \n \n20.  Water  tariff  analysis.  A  tariff  increase  for  Xiuwen  County  is  required  to  finance  a \nnew water treatment plant as well as purchase wholesale water from the Jinlong reservoir. \nWater  supply  tariffs  in  Xiuwen  County  are  relatively  low  by  PRC  standards, and  are below \nthe long run incremental cost of expanding water supply capacity. The water tariff has been \nincreased by 20% from 2005 to 2006. Once the WSC begins receiving water from the project \nfacilities, a tariff increase of 108% will be required. Xiuwen county government has given a \nwritten  assurance  to  GMG  to  raise  tariffs  to  required  level,  and  failing  this,  to  provide \nsubsidies  to  sustain  the  subproject  facilities.  The  water  tariff  increase  is  expected  to \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                    Appendix 15                                            \n\n73\n\naccelerate in 2010 as economy-wide inflation pressure is reduced as a result of the global \nfinancial crisis.   \n \n21. \nIn  rural  areas,  the  current  method  of  charging  for  irrigation  water  by  area  of  land \nirrigated  is accepted as  being  inefficient  in  water  use and provides  little  incentive on water \nusers to economize. GMG will seek to promote the measurement of water consumption by \nindividuals  and  groups  of  users,  and  apply  tariffs  that  encourage  water  conservation  and \nprovide  for  basic  cost  recovery  of  at  least  the  operation,  maintenance,  and  management \ncosts  of  irrigation  systems  in  accordance  with  national  policies.  The  proposed  tariffs  for \nirrigation  water  for  the  operating  authorities  of  the  Jinlong  reservoir  and  Wudang  irrigation \nsystem rehabilitation subprojects are consistent with the Government\u2019s policy. The proposed \nirrigation charges are CNY0.45 per m3 for Wudang subproject, CNY0.60 per m3 for Jinlong \nsubproject,  and  CNY0.70  per  m3  for  Liaojiuzhai  subproject.  The  current  charge  is \nCNY0.10 per m3. The GMG and county governments, while reluctant to raise irrigation water \ntariffs because of the potential negative impacts on farmers\u2019 income, recognize the problem \nthat  low  irrigation  costs  discourage  water  savings.  The  GMG  and  county  governments \nrespond to the problem by more stringent local water management and sufficient subsidies \nfor local water management operations.  \n \n22. \nAssessment of WTP for urban and rural domestic water supplies and of net income \nfrom improved crop production indicates that beneficiaries would accept the proposed tariff \nincreases. The WTP is estimated at CNY4 per m3 for domestic use. Expenditure shares are \ncalculated before accounting for the water bill waiver for registered poor households and in \nall cases, with-Project water supply costs constitute less than 5% of household expenditure.  \n \n\n6. \n\nEconomic Analysis  \n\n23. \nA  base case economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR) was  determined  for  each  core \nsubproject. All core subprojects, except the Liaojiuzhai reservoir, have EIRR values of 12% \nor  more,  and  are  considered  economically  viable.  The  EIRR  for  the  Liaojiuzhai  subproject \nequals 10%, and is considered economically viable considering nonquantifiable benefits that \nare  not  enumerated,  including  water  allocated  to  ecological  uses  and  as  yet  undeveloped \nrural domestic water supply. EIRRs for the core subprojects are shown in Table A15.3. \n \n\nTable A15.3: EIRR for the Core Subprojects \n\nSubproject \nUrban Water Supply, Yudongxia \nSmall-Scale Reservoir, Jinglong \nSmall-Scale Reservoir,  Liaojiuzhai \nIrrigation System Rehabilitation, Wudang \nSmall Water Storage, Xifeng \nWater and Soil Conservation Huaxi \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n% \n20.8 \n18.6 \n10.0 \n22.7 \n12.1 \n18.9 \n\n \n\n24. \nSensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  economic  performance  is  very  robust  of  four \nsubprojects (Table A15.4), including Yudongxia reservoir and water treatment plant, Jinlong \nsmall-scale  reservoir,  Wudang  irrigation  system  rehabilitation,  and  Huaxi  soil  and  water \nconservation. The economic performance of other subprojects is sensitive to relatively small \nincreases  in  costs  or  reductions  in  the  value  of  benefits.  Overall,  the  core  subprojects  are \nshown  to  be  beneficial.  These  results  support  the  sector  loan,  but  indicate  that  individual \nnoncore  subprojects  must  be  carefully  scrutinized  to  assure  that  they  are  sufficiently \nbeneficial.  \n \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\n Appendix 15 \n\nTable A15.4: Estimated EIRRs and Switching Point Values \n(%) \n\nItem \n\nMidsize \nReservoir  \nYudongxia \n\nSmall-Scale \nReservoir  \nLiaojiuzhai \n\nBase case EIRR \n\n20.8 \n\nEliminate PPP adjustment \nDelay water sales growth \n1 year \n(i)  Delay water tariff \n\nincrease 1 year \nSwitching value testsa \n(ii)  Investment cost, \n% change \n\n(iii)  O&M costs, % change  \n(iv)  Willingness to pay for \nwater, % changeb \n(v)  Net crop income, \n\n% change \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nSmall-\nScale \nReservoir \nJinglong \n18.6 \n\n18.6 \n\n18.56 \n\n18.54 \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\n10.0 \n\n10.0 \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nna \n\nIrrigation \nSystem \nRehab. \nWudang \n22.7 \n\nSmall \nWater \nStorage \nXifeng \n12.1 \n\nWater and \nSoil \nConservation \nHuaxi \n18.9 \n\n22.8 \n\n12.1 \n\n18.9 \n\nna \n\nna \n\n197 \n\n1,357 \n\nna \n\n33 \n\nna \n\nna \n\n101 \n\n121 \n\n99 \n\n97 \n\nna \n\nna \n\n178 \n\n2,008 \n\nna \n\n56 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, na = not applicable, O&M = operation and maintenance, PPP = public\u2013\nprivate partnership. \na Indicate the percent change required to yield in EIRR value of 12% (10% in the case of Jinlong and Liajiuzhai \n  reservoirs). \nb Applies to urban and rural domestic water supplies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n7. \n\nDistributional and Poverty Impact \n\nPoor rural households will be the primary recipients of project benefits from irrigation \n25. \nand  rural  domestic  water  supply.  Poverty  is  comparatively  widespread  across  the  rural \npopulation, and the subprojects are located in areas where water supplies are inadequate or \nunreliable so that benefiting populations are more likely to be impoverished because of lack \nof  water.  Under  existing  conditions,  there  is  too  much  uncertainty  about  the  availability  of \nwater  for  cash  crop  production.  This  means  that  farmers  prefer  to  plant  subsistence  crops \nsince  this  lowers  the  risk  of  food  shortage  when  drought  occurs.  With  the  irrigation \nsubprojects in place, the risk of drought is greatly diminished, and cash crop production will \nbe more viable.  \n \n26. \nIn rural subprojects, beneficiary farmers contribute to the Project through labor input \nor payment of user charges. The benefits they receive will outweigh the costs as indicated \nby subproject EIRR values. Project preparatory technical assistance estimates indicate that \nthe  proportion  of  the  rural  population  experiencing  absolute  poverty  in  the  core  subproject \nservice areas will reduce from 35% to 21%, and the proportion experiencing relative poverty \nwill fall from 59% to 45%.7 \n \nThe  urban  water  supply  costs  are  recovered  from  water  supply  customers  through \n27. \nthe  water  tariff.  Domestic  customers  receive  a  modest  cross-subsidy  from  non-domestic \ncustomers  because  of  the  tariff  structure,  so  that  there  will  be  a  reallocation  of  project \ninvestment  costs  from  the  domestic  water  supply  customer  to  other  customers.  Poor \ndomestic  customers  of  Xiuwen  WSC  receive  an  additional  subsidy  because  urban  WSCs \nwaive the water bill for registered poverty households. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n7   The  annual  per  capita  income  threshold  is  assumed  to  be  CNY720  for  absolute  poverty  and  CNY1,200  for \n\nrelative poverty. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.146 \nCNY6.83 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \nAsian Development Bank \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \nenvironmental impact assessment \nenvironmental impact report \neconomic internal rate of return \nethnic minorities development framework \nethnic minorities development plan \nenvironmental management plan \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau \nfeasibility assessment report \nfinancial internal rate of return \nfeasibility study report \ngender action plan \nGuiyang Finance Bureau \nGuiyang municipal government \nGuizhou Provincial Finance Department \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nintegrated water resources management \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMinistry of Land Resources \nnational competitive bidding \nnongovernment organization \noperation and maintenance \npayment for environmental service \nproject implementing office \nproject leading group \nproject management office \nproject performance management system \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nquality and cost-based selection \nresettlement framework \nsummary environmental impact assessment \nsummary initial environmental examination \nstatement of expenditures \ntechnical assistance \nWater Resources Bureau \nwater resources system \nwater supply company \nwater users association \nwater users group \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ADB \nEA \nEARF \nEIA \nEIR \nEIRR \nEMDF \nEMDP \nEMP \nEPB \nFAR \nFIRR \nFSR \nGAP \nGFB \nGMG \nGPFD \nIA \nICB \nIEE \nIWRM \nLIBOR \nMLR \nNCB \nNGO \nO&M \nPES \nPIO \nPLG \nPMO \nPPMS \nPRC \nQCBS \nRF \nSEIA \nSIEE \nSOE \nTA \nWRB \nWRS \nWSC \nWUA \nWUG \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "\u2013  \nha \n \n\u2013  \nkm \n \nkm2 \n\u2013  \n \nm2 \n\u2013  \n \nm3 \n \n\u2013 \nm3/day  \n\u2013 \nm3/s \n\u2013 \n \nmu                   \u2013  \n", "hectare \nkilometer \nsquare kilometer \nsquare meter \ncubic meter \ncubic meters per day \ncubic meters per second \na Chinese land measure approximately equal to \n0.06667 ha, or 15 mu to 1 ha  \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", " \n", "C.
