This  will  occur  through the  development \nof  a  national  network  of  high-performing  vocational  senior \nsecondary schools (VSs) that will act as exemplars or models for \nother  schools\u2014initially  through  associated  networks  of  alliance \nschools. To increase the efficiency and dynamism of VSs, some \nmodel  schools  will  be  expanded  to  create  large  schools  with \nenrollments  of  around  1,500  students.  These  schools  will  offer \nconsiderable  advantages  over  smaller  schools  including  more \ndiverse course offerings, increased cost efficiency resulting from \neconomies  of  scale,  and  the  opportunity  to  develop  stronger \nteaching  and  mentoring  teams.  At  the  same  time,  the  quality  of \nthe  model  schools  will  be  enhanced  by  identifying  international \nbenchmarks and providing the resources needed to help schools \nachieve them.    \n\nSignificant changes in school management will be necessary so \nthat large institutions can be run effectively and efficiently along \nbusiness  lines.  Equally  important  are  strong  industry  linkages \nand  a  well-trained  teaching  force  able  to  effectively  deliver \ntechnical and academic courses. \n\nISO \n\n(International  Organization \n\nThe  Project  responds  directly  to  the  Government\u2019s  policy  that \nselected  senior  secondary  schools  should  meet  international \nbenchmarks. International benchmarking will be supported under \nthe Project through school linkages with multinational companies \nand \nfor  Standardization) \ncertification. \n \nNational  and  local  governments  are  concerned  that  too  many \ngraduates are leaving high school without the skills necessary to \nensure  their  economic  welfare,  and  to  contribute  to  national \neconomic  and  industrial  development.  The  Government\u2019s  policy \nto  strengthen  the  quality  and  relevance  of  vocational  education \nand training is part of its broader social and economic policy.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n \n \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \n\neducation \n\nvocational \n\nlargest \nThe \ninvestment  in  subprofessional  skills  development\u2014has  more \nthan 6,800 public and private VSs with a total enrollment of over \n2.86  million.  Ensuring  that  the  system  responds  to  Indonesia\u2019s \neconomic and employment needs is therefore a high priority. \n\nsystem\u2014Indonesia\u2019s \n\nindustry \n\nGovernment  consultations  with \nindicate  (i)  some \nindustrial  developments  are  constrained  due  to  Indonesia\u2019s \ncomparative lack of skilled workers, and (ii) widespread concern \nabout  the  lack  of  relevance  of  some  VS  courses  to  industry \nrequirements.  The  need  to  strengthen  ties  with  local  industry  is \nstrong; the Project will provide continuous upgrading courses for \nVS graduates and other workers.  \n\nGrowth in formal sector employment opportunities has stagnated \nin  recent  years  with  unemployment  and  underemployment \nbecoming  significant  social  concerns  and  slowing  poverty \nreduction. VS graduates are considered to have strong potential \nfor  generating  self-employment  and  for  small-scale  employment \ncreation.  To  strengthen  entrepreneurship  skills,  the  Project  will \nensure  the  introduction  of  entrepreneurship  training  in  all  model \nschools,  supported  by  productive  activities  in  school  production \nunits and business incubators. \n \nThe project impact is expected to be increased competitiveness \nand employment opportunities for vocational school graduates. \n\nThe outcome is expected to be improved quality and relevance, \nexpanded  access,  and  greater  efficiency  in  senior  secondary \nvocational  education.  This  outcome  will  be  achieved  through  a \nturnaround  in  school  management  practices  using  a  business \napproach;  a  better  teaching  and  learning  environment  resulting \nfrom  improved  facilities,  equipment,  and  teaching  skills;  more \nrelevant  and  up-to-date  teaching  and  learning  methodologies;  a \nstrong  focus  on  entrepreneurship;  and  more  efficient  use  of \nresources.  A  broader  role  for  VSs  that  includes  upgrading  and \nrecertifying graduates and other workers will be supported. \n \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $115  million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  contingencies,  and  interest  charges. \nOver 75% of the project funds will be used to empower schools \nin  planning  and  managing  their  own  educational  resources  and \nprograms.  The  bulk  of  the  project  funds  are  allocated  to \napproved  school-developed  business  plans  (SBPs)  for  model \nschools.  The  SBPs  can  cover  civil  works  and  equipment, \nteaching  and  learning  materials,  partnerships  with  industry, \nhuman  resource  development  (including  alliance  schools), \nentrepreneurship development, and project management.  \n \n\n\f \nPeriod of Utilization  \n\n \n1 June 2008 to 30 November 2013 \n\n \n31 May 2013 \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements  \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nIt is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \nloan  of  $80  million  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nfinance the Project.

MONE,  through  the  PMU,  will  be \nresponsible  for  selecting  and  hiring  consultants.  Individual \nconsultants will also be hired to assist the PMU. \n \nUpgrading and efficiency gains are expected to increase annual \nstudent  intake  from  28,000  to  34,000  students,  thus  expanding \nstudent  capacity  to  100,000  in  model  schools  and  110,000  in \nalliance  schools.  Forty  percent  of  the  students  will  be  girls. \nNearly  half  of  the  students  will  be  from  poor  and  low-income \nfamilies drawn predominantly from the urban poor.  \n\nrefinement  of  SBPs  and  SBP \n\nimplementation; \n\nto  guide \n\nthe \n\nfinance,  and  management \nLeadership,  business  planning, \ntraining  will  be  provided  to  2,400  principals  and  administrative \nstaff  in  the  model  and  alliance  schools.  Subject  matter  and \ntechnical  skills  training  will  be  provided  to  10,400  teachers. \nSchool,  equipment  and  teaching  materials  will  be  upgraded \naccording \nto  school-developed  business  plans.  Enhanced \nindustry  partnerships  are  central  to  the  Project.  The  intended \nresult is increased efficiency and education quality. \n\nOver  15  years,  the  Project  will  equip  614,000  graduates  with \nrelevant  industry  skills,  greater  capacity  to  adapt  to  changing \ntechnology,  and  higher  productivity  resulting  in  greater  earning \npotential.  The  additional  worker  productivity  generated  by  the \nProject  is  estimated  to  be  3  million  person-years,  boosting \nIndonesia\u2019s  industrial  competitiveness  and  reducing  poverty. \nEntrepreneur  development  and  business  incubators  will  help \nnew  graduates  establish  viable  enterprises.  Enhanced  industry \npartnerships  will  yield  more  work-study  placements,  shorter  job \nsearch time and reduced employment mismatch. By 2012, short \ncourses will have been developed for up to 20,000 VS graduates \n\n\f  \nRisks and Assumptions \n \n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nv\n\nand  other  workers  to  upgrade  their  skills,  thus  contributing  to \nupgrading the existing labor force. \n\n \nThe  Project  is  directly  linked  to  the  cornerstone  of  the  National \nMedium-Term Development Plan 2004\u20132009, to improve quality \nand  relevance  through  better  linkages  with  industry.  The  main \nrisk in any project that invests in vocational education is that an \neconomic downturn will occur just as the benefits of the Project \nare emerging. The other macro risk is that economic growth will \nbe  jobless  growth.  The  Project\u2019s  emphasis  on  entrepreneurship \nwill  assist  in  mitigating  these  risks  because  skilled  workers  will \nhave both big industry and micro-industry options. \n\nThe  policy  to  expand  and  upgrade  vocational  education  is \nexpected  to  be  sustainable  over  the  coming  decade  given  the \nGovernment\u2019s  keen  interest  in  reducing  unemployment  and  the \nstrong  social  demand  for  increased  training  and  employment \nopportunities.  Government  resources  for  vocational  education \nare  expected \nto  grow  because  of  MONE\u2019s \ndetermined  thrust  to  expand  the  sector.  Model  schools  will  be \nthe \nsustainable  given  Government  budget  resources  and \nincreasing  emphasis  on  public\u2013private  partnerships,  better \nrevenue  generation,  and  greater  relevance  to  industry  and \nbusiness, leading to higher enrollment and efficiency. \n\nto  continue \n\nThe  risk  of  insufficient  transparency  and  accountability  in \nGovernment  financial  management  and  accounting  processes \nwill  be  mitigated  by  specific  measures  including  a  financial \nmanagement information system. The risk that school principals \nand  senior  management  may  aim  for  enrollment  growth  rather \nthan  structural  and  management  change,  and  lack  the  capacity \nto  manage  large  VSs  successfully  will  be  mitigated  by  carefully \nselecting  model  schools,  intensive  leadership  training,  and  a \nbusiness approach to management and strategic planning.  \n\n \nADB  will  provide  a  TA  grant  of  $500,000  from  the  ADB-funded \nTA  program  to  help  MONE  investigate  and  trial  skills  upgrading \nprograms  in  VSs.  At  present  most  VS  graduates  enter  the \nworkforce after 3 years of training with little opportunity for further \nformal training, upgrading or recredentialing. This does not meet \nthe  demands  of  a  global  environment  of  technological  change. \nUnder  the  TA,  10  VSs  will  develop  and  trial  subprofessional \nupgrading courses in high priority areas. VS graduates and other \nworkers who need skills upgrading and recertification will be the \ntraining  and \ntarget  market,  as  well  as  predeparture \nrecredentialing for workers hoping to work internationally.  \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Vocational  Education  Strengthening  Project.  The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) to Enhance Continuing Skills Development, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nLong-term and sustainable poverty reduction requires technological change to increase \n2. \nproductivity  and  raise  incomes.  Three  quarters  of  all  employment  in  Indonesia  is  in  sectors \nwhere  future  viability  demands  an  increase  in  productivity\u2014agriculture,  manufacturing,  and \nhospitality.  A  major  economic  policy  of  the  Government  is  to  increase  domestic  production  of \ngoods and services, and to move away from lower level production of goods. This will require a \ngreater  supply  of  skilled  workers.  To  be  globally  competitive,  Indonesia  must  increase  the \neducation and skill base of its labor force. In countries where large firms make up the bulk of the \nproductive sector, and labor mobility is limited, skills can be developed through enterprise-based \ntraining. In such countries, government intervention can be restricted to serving disadvantaged \ngroups  such  as  the  unemployed.  However,  in  countries  where  the  majority  of  workers  are  in \nsmall enterprises that cannot support training costs, government must intervene. In Indonesia, \n90%  of  enterprises  are  microenterprises  employing  fewer  than  six  workers.  To  achieve  its \ntargets for economic development and poverty reduction, the Government must act to improve \nand expand senior secondary and higher education. The sector assessment is in Appendix 2.    \n \n3. \nSenior Secondary Education. For the last 15 years, almost all efforts and resources of \nthe  Government  and  external  funding  agencies  have  been  devoted  to  achieving  the \nGovernment\u2019s flagship education policy of 9 years of universal basic education. This has been \nremarkably  successful.  Primary  education  is  now  close  to  universal  and  junior  secondary \neducation coverage has reached 83%. The increase in output from basic education has led to a \nsurge  in  demand  for  senior  secondary  education  (SSE).  Already,  75%  of  junior  secondary \ngraduates continue on to SSE. The result is an impressive 27% growth in SSE enrollment over \nthe last 6 years, with the number of schools increasing even more rapidly. \n \nSSE  is  a  key  component  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  provide  young  people  with  the \n4. \nskills  needed  to  stay  out  of  poverty,  reduce  the  unemployment  rate,  and  create  a  globally \ncompetitive  labor  force.  SSE  is  the  final  stage  of  the  12-year  formal  school  system,  and  the \nentry point into the labor market for half of the final year graduates. The SSE system comprises \nvocational  education  (VE)  and  general  education  (GE).  VE  is  offered  in  vocational  senior \nsecondary schools (VSs) through a combined 3-year vocational and academic curriculum. GE is \noffered  in  general  senior  secondary  schools  (GSs)  and  madrasah  aliyah  which  offer  a  purely \nacademic  curriculum  over  3  years.  Senior  secondary  schools  are  managed  by  districts  in \naccordance  with  the  National  Education  Law  (20/2003),  with  considerable  support  from  the \nprovinces in planning, supervision, and monitoring of schools and programs. The Government is \nalready  looking  to  a  future  12  years  of  universal  education  and  has  taken  the  first  steps  by \nencouraging districts with near universal basic education to pursue this strategy.  \n \n5. \nAbout 50% of 16\u201318 year-olds are enrolled in SSE, with 40% of these enrolled in VE. In \ngeneral,  VE  students  come  from  families  with  lower  incomes  than  those  in  general  education \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n(GE). There are over 6,800 public and private VSs with a total enrollment of over 2.86 million. In \n2006,  most  students  were  in  either  technology  and  industry  schools  (46%)  or  business  and \nmanagement  schools  (43%);  with  a  much  smaller  number  in  tourism  (5%),  agriculture  (2.4%) \nand  arts  and  handicraft.  About  40%  of  students  are  girls,  with  a  high  degree  of  segregation \nacross different types of schools and programs. Girls predominate in business and management \nschools, while technology and industry schools are almost exclusively male. Given the size and \nimportance of the VE system, ensuring that it responds effectively to Indonesia\u2019s economic and \nemployment needs is a matter of priority. Graduates entering the labor force today will work until \nabout  2050,  so  the  quality  of  their  education  will  impact  heavily  on  Indonesia\u2019s  long-term \ncompetitiveness. \n \n6. \nPerformance.  Labor  market  outcomes  are  the  best  measure  for  assessing  the \nperformance of the VE system. Generally these are compared with GE outcomes to determine \nwhether the extra costs involved in vocational education are justified. In the case of Indonesia, \nVS  graduates  make  an  important  contribution  to  the  workforce.  They  comprise  25%  of  the \nskilled  labor  force,  and have  a  higher  labor  force  participation  rate  than  GS  graduates\u2014about \n10%  higher  overall  and  25%  higher  for  women.  Male  and  female  VS  graduates  are  also  20% \nmore  likely  to  be  in  the  formal  sector.  Salaries  are  higher,  particularly  for  women.  The \nunemployment  rate  of  VS  graduates  is  lower  than  for  diploma  or  higher  education  graduates. \nThis  has  been  noted  by  parents  and  political  leaders,  and  is  partly  responsible  for  the  recent \nexplosion  in  the  growth  of  VSs  across  the  country.  Since  2000,  the  number  has  increased  by \n45% and enrollment by 24%. \n \n7. \nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships. The private sector partners with the public sector both as \na direct provider of SSE, and indirectly through links between schools and business or industry \nPrivate schools contribute significantly to SSE, with an enrollment share of 73% in VE and 41% \nin  GE.  The  high  private  share  partly  reflects  decisions  about  public  involvement  in  VE.  In  the \n1970s and 1980s the Government invested heavily in VE, but over time vocational training was \nleft increasingly to the private sector. Imbalances in the provision of training resulted, with more \nthan  half  of  all  VSs  focusing  on  business  and  management  training  and  only  one  third  on \ntechnology  and  industry.  Today,  with  wage  returns  and  other  labor  market  outcomes  that  are \nbetter  for  VS  than  GS  graduates,  public  funding  is  returning  to  the  sector.  The  Government \nrecognizes the need to redress the imbalance between public and private provision. The rapid \ngrowth of public VSs reflects the Government\u2019s new strategy. Private schools still predominate \nin enrollment share, but are smaller and of lesser quality than public schools. Public and private \nVSs coordinate through the Association of Vocational Senior Secondary School Principals and \nteachers participate in the same regular peer learning groups.  \n \n8. \nLocal  linkages  with  industry  and  the  business  community  have  strengthened  in  recent \nyears.  VSs  rely  on  industry  partners,  local  government,  and  the  local  business  community  to \nkeep  in  touch  with  demand.  Industry  partners  such  as  chambers  of  commerce  and  local \nbusiness  people  sit  on  school  committees;  advise  on  course  content;  provide  instructors  and \nwork  placement  opportunities  and,  in  districts with  significant  industry,  have  supplied  vehicles, \nequipment and scholarships. Close contact with the business community enables schools to be \nflexible and maintain program relevance. \n \n9. \nFinancing. Education funding has increased significantly over the last few years as the \nGovernment  implements  its  policy  of  reaching  a  target  for  education  spending  of  20%  of \nnational and local expenditure, as mandated in the National Education Law. Total spending on \neducation  reached  17.2%  of  government  expenditure  and  3.9%  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) in 2006; comparable to many other middle-income countries. The central budget for VE \n\n\fdoubled between 2005 and 2007. Most of these funds (63%) are channeled directly from the \ncenter to the schools to cover facility improvements, materials, scholarships and competency \ntesting.  Twenty-five  percent  is  channeled  to  provinces,  primarily  for  allocation  to  schools \nthrough  additional  block  grants,  and  to  provide  support  for  provincial  supervision  and \nmonitoring.  In  all,  90%  of  the  funds  for  vocational  education  is  channeled  to  schools.  The \nremaining 10% is used for salaries and recurrent costs in DTVE. District support to vocational \nschools  is  growing  and  likely  to  increase  as  district  budgets  increase,  and  pressure  on  local \ngovernments to expand VE mounts. \n \n10. \nThe  education  budget  increases,  though  sufficient  to  cover  recurrent  expenses,  are \ninsufficient for the capital investments needed for a significant revitalization and expansion of \nthe  VE  system.  The  lack  of investment  in  SSE over  the  past  15  years has  left  schools  poorly \nprepared to deal with the influx of new students. The higher investment and operating costs for \nVSs have left them at a particular disadvantage in responding rapidly to these changes.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nProblems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n \n11. \nAccess to good quality SSE and economic opportunity is essential for reducing poverty. \nAlthough  the  recent  relatively  slow  economic  growth  has  reduced  the  capacity  of  the  labor \nmarket to absorb new job entrants, the low quality of human resources, low productivity, and low \nmastery  and  application  of  technology  are  also  key  constraints  to  employment  and  economic \ngrowth.1 The VE system helps to (i) ensure life skills and employment readiness for those who \nnot  continuing  to  postsecondary  education  and  (ii)   fulfill  the  need  for  mid-level  workers  in  the \nsectors  of  manufacturing,  industry,  construction,  mining,  trading,  social  services,  tourism, \ninformation and communications technology (ICT), agriculture, technology and arts. \n \nVS  graduates  will  be  more  attractive  to  employers  if  they  are  better  trained  and  can \n12. \ndemonstrate  relevant  skills  in  areas  of  high  demand.  Students  will  be  attracted  to  VE  if  the \ntraining  is  perceived  to  result  in  good  jobs  and  incomes,  without  closing  off  opportunities  for \nfurther training or education. More girls and poorer students will be attracted to VE if access is \nwidened and new opportunities are identified. Existing workers will be attracted to VE for skills \nimprovement  programs  and  certification  if  such  courses  become  more  widely  available.  And \nVSs  will  become  more  sustainable  if  unit  costs  are  lowered  through  efficiency  gains  and \nincreased income generation. The key issues thus relate to the growing demand for VE, quality \nand  relevance  of  the  programs  offered,  and  cost-effectiveness  of  the  training.  A  move  toward \nlarger,  better-managed,  and  more  efficient  institutions;  closer  linkages  with  industry;  improved \nteaching  and  an  enhanced  business  focus  in  school  management  and  training  should  help  to \nrevitalize the VE system and improve its capacity to satisfy student and workplace needs. \n \n13. \nIncreasing Demand for Vocational Education. In response to the growing demand for \nVE, the strategy of the Ministry of National Education (MONE) is to increase the size of existing \nVSs  rather  than  establish  new  schools.  This  will  result  in  more  schools  with  enrollments  over \n1,000,  generally  located  in  urban  or  industrial  areas.  They  will  be  termed  \u201clead  vocational \nschools.\u201d  These  larger  schools  will  act  as  models  for  other  VSs,  eventually  expanding  access. \nThis strategy cannot succeed by simply constructing more buildings, purchasing more equipment, \n\n                                                 \n1   National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  2005.

Jakarta. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nand  hiring  more  staff  who  continue  to  teach  using  traditional  methods.  International  experience \nshows  that  the  development  of  effective  lead  VSs  requires  a  series  of  fundamental  changes  to \nmanagement practices, efficiency, flexibility and closer linkages with industry.  \n \nThe  expansion  of  access  should  be  carried  out  along  with  a  strategy  for  broadening \n14. \nequity.  As  many  VS  students  come  from  the  middle-  and  lower-income  quintiles,  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy of channeling investment to public schools to increase the number of low \nfee  places  is  a  powerful  tool  in  promoting  social  equity.  To  broaden  access  in  rural  areas, \nMONE  will  expand  programs  based  on  ICT.  The  Project,  in  combination  with  the  national \nscholarship  program  for  poor  VS  students,  is  likely  to  encourage  more  children  from  lower-\nincome families to enroll. Gender equity will be addressed by identifying emerging opportunities \nfor women in the workforce, particularly in newer technology areas, and encouraging schools to \noffer such courses.  \n \n15. \nProgram  Quality  in  VS.  The  quality  of  teaching  and  learning  in  academic  and \nvocational  programs  needs  improvement.  Final  examination  scores  for  academic  subjects  are \nlower  in  VSs  than  GSs.  Only  62%  of  VS  teachers  meet  current  qualification  standards,  and \ngood  teachers  with  industry  experience  are  rare.  Labor  market  outcomes  can  be  raised  by \nimproving  general  cognitive  skills  to  foster  greater  flexibility  and  independent  thinking.  MONE \nhas begun to address these shortcomings by strengthening the teaching of academic subjects \nand  improving  teachers\u2019  technical  skills.  An  important  new  reform  is  to  assess  students\u2019 \ntechnical skills as part of the national final examination. Quality standards are being raised by \nestablishing international standard schools with higher quality standards and increased funding, \nas  mandated  in  the  National  Education  Law.  Nevertheless,  better  teaching  and  learning  in  all \nsubjects is critical, through more modern and varied teaching methods, wider use of ICT across \nthe curriculum, and a much greater supply and variety of teaching and learning materials. \n \n16. \nA turnaround in management practices and organization structures in VSs is important \nfor  their  long-term  success  and  vitality.  Schools  need  to  become  more  entrepreneurial  in  their \ntraining  approach  and  must  be  able  to  enter  into  commercial  arrangements.  Existing  good \nexamples  of  commercial  arrangements  and  business  practices  should  be  built  into  the \nmanagement of all VSs. To support total quality management, schools should be encouraged to \npursue ISO (International Organization for Standardization) or other accreditation. \n \n17. \nRelevance of Vocational Courses. To improve the relevance of VS courses, stronger \nlinks with industry and entrepreneurship skill development are needed. School\u2013industry linkages \ncan extend to partnerships, increasing worker skills, and international certification of students to \nmultinational  competency  standards.  This  can  be  achieved  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including \n(i) national\u2013international  linkages,  such  as  those  with  Cisco  and  Caterpillar,  encompassing \nprincipal  and  teacher  placements  as  well  as  upgrading  facilities  and  equipment  to  that  of  the \npartner,  work  placements  for  students,  certification  and  job  placement;  (ii)  local  linkages \nbetween  principals  and  local  industry  or  businesses  and  (iii)  industry  certification  for  students. \nThe  developing  trend  for  some  VSs  to  offer  short  skills  training  courses  to  graduates  and \nexisting  workers  will  reinforce  ties  with  local  industry,  as  will  the  strengthening  of  school \nproduction units.  The  development  of  competency-based  training  using  industry  standards  will \nbe continued and expanded. A linked strategy is to ensure that evaluation and assessment also \nhas links to industry by involving industry workers in the assessment of students' practical skills. \n \nVSs  must  also  respond  to  labor  market  realities  to  better  equip  students  destined  for \n18. \nself-employment  (30%  of  the  labor  force  is  employed  in  enterprises  comprising  one  to  four \npeople,  excluding  agriculture).  The  technical  skills  taught  lend  themselves  to  self-employment \n\n\fand  the  creation  of  small  enterprises.  The  Education  Strategic  Plan  2005\u20132009  identifies  the \nneed  for  VSs  to  develop  entrepreneurship  programs,  to  help  graduates  develop  self-\nemployment opportunities. Extending the scope of school production units to provide support to \nstudents after graduation will help them to start up small businesses.  \n \n19. \nCost-Effectiveness  of  VS.  The  sustainability  of  good  quality  vocational  programs  will \ndepend partly on progress made in reducing unit costs. Facilities must be used more efficiently. \nThe best way to do this is by expanding the size of institutions substantially to reduce overhead \ncosts and promote higher utilization rates for buildings, classrooms, and equipment. Campuses \nshould be suitable for use in the evenings and on weekends. This will require targeted planning \nfor new facilities and equipment, as well as rehabilitation of existing teaching space to expand \nenrollment. Larger schools allow better utilization of teaching staff, as well as the development \nof a critical mass of teachers in specialized areas and teaching teams that stimulate new ideas \nand more varied teaching practices. A major cost factor for VSs is the need to carry up-to-date \nequipment. The Government is attempting to address this innovatively, primarily by contracting \nspecific VSs to produce the training equipment needed. This has the added benefit of providing \nschools with income and students with practical manufacturing experience. The cost of technical \ntraining can be offset and technical skills enhanced through increased use of production units, \non-site stores, restaurants, travel agencies and hotels. VSs can also earn additional income and \nimprove their ties to local industry by offering short skills upgrading and certification courses for \ngraduates  or  workers.  These  programs  are  cost-effective  for  local  industry,  especially  small \ncompanies that lack the resources to train their own workers, while providing the school with a \nbetter understanding of local industry needs. The programs will benefit workers seeking formal \nsector employment at home or abroad, workers who want to learn new technologies or change \nindustry streams, and women reentering the labor force.  \n \n20. \nThe current high-level commitment to education reform provides a major opportunity to \nsupport  education  development  in  Indonesia.  More  public  resources  are  being  allocated  to \neducation, particularly basic education as the largest part of the education system. To achieve \nGovernment  objectives  for  VE,  increased  external  assistance  will  be  required  over  the \nmedium term to cover the initial investment costs for expansion and quality improvement. The \nupward  trend  in  allocations  for  this  subsector  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  medium  term  to \naccommodate the growing output from basic education and the priority Government places on \nupgrading  labor  force  skills  and  improving  employment  opportunities  for  senior  school \ngraduates.  \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Strategy and Policy \n\n \n21. \nA central goal of the National Medium-Term Development Plan 2004\u20132009 is to increase \naccess  to  quality  education.  The  plan  sets  targets  for  SSE  that  reflect  the  need  to  broaden \naccess in response to the expansion of junior secondary education, and to supply good quality \nSSE  graduates  to  the  labor  market  with  training  relevant  to  market  demand.  The  Government \nplans to increase gross enrollment rates for SSE to 69% (about 9.07 million) by 2009, through \nan  increase  to  90%  in  the  transition  rate  from  junior  secondary  to  SSE.  MONE\u2019s  Education \nStrategic Plan 2005\u20132009 notes that the thrust for SSE expansion will be through VE, to ensure \nlife  skills  and  readiness  for  employment  for  those  who  do  not  continue  to  postsecondary \neducation  and  fulfill  the  needs  for  mid-level  employment  in  relevant  sectors.2  Quality  and \nrelevance will be improved by (i) developing competency-based curricula, instructional materials \n\n                                                 \n2   Manufacturing, industry, construction, mining, trading, social services, tourism, ICT, agriculture, and technology. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nand  assessment  systems,  including  entrepreneurship  skills  and  programs  that  are  relevant  to \nlocal  job  market  needs;  (ii) developing  selected  schools  to  become  world  class  or  model \nschools, to be developed by central and regional governments working together to identify and \ndevelop  local  competitiveness  and  promote  international  collaboration  in  curriculum  and \ncompetency  standard  development;  and  (iii)  expanding  integration  of  ICT  into  teaching  and \nlearning  to  enhance  the  skills  of  future  mid-level  workers.  Improved  governance  and \naccountability will result from greater involvement of business and industry partners in managing \nVE,  and  community  participation  in  the  management  of  school  funds  with  the  development  of \ntransparent and accountable financial management systems. \n \n\n3. \n\nAsian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n\n \nThe Project is included in the 2006\u20132009 country strategy and program3 and supports its \n22. \ntwo pillars: pro-poor sustainable economic growth and social development. The country strategy \nand  program  identifies  low  competitiveness  as  a  key  constraint  to  growth.  In  the  education \nsector, ADB aims to improve competitiveness of the labor force by strengthening the quality and \ncompetitiveness  of  VE  graduates.  The  country  strategy  and  program  identifies  specific \neducation sector outcomes: (i) improved expansion and equity; (ii) better quality, relevance and \ncompetitiveness;  and  (iii)  enhanced  governance,  accountability  and  public  image.  The  Project \nwill contribute to all three outcomes by expanding the size of selected schools; increasing the \nquality  of  graduates  and  competitiveness  in  the  labor  market;  and  introducing  new  school \nmanagement  practices  based  on  a  business  approach.  ADB  has  been  a  strong  supporter  of \nIndonesian  education,  providing  $2.2  billion  in  loans  and  $17  million  in  TA.  ADB  support  has \nbeen especially influential in technological and workforce skills development. The Project builds \nupon the gains of ADB projects from the 1980s and 1990s that were successful in establishing \nand  developing  the  current  VE  system,4  and  whose  legacy  is  still  evident  today.  The  schools \nestablished are still among the highest performers, and the vocational teacher training centers \ncontinue  to  play  a  key  role  in  development  of  the  VE  system  The  Project  also  complements \ncurrent  policy-led  interventions  aiming  to  improve  the  investment  climate  for  growth  and \nemployment creation. \n \n\n4. \n\nOther External Support and Aid Coordination \n\n \n23. \nIndonesia\u2019s  strategic  importance  has  attracted  large  amounts  of  grant  funding  for \neducation  in  recent  years,  primarily  for  basic  education,  from  donors  including  the  Australian \nAgency for International Development, the United States Agency for International Development, \nand  smaller  donors  such  as  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  German  Agency  for \nTechnical Cooperation (GTZ), Embassy of the Netherlands, and Save the Children, as well as \nUnited Nations agencies (Appendix 3 provides a summary  of external assistance). Some loan \nfunds  have  also  been  directed  to  basic  education,  including  madrasah  education  (ADB)  and \nearly childhood education (World Bank). Policy-based programs incorporating broad reforms in \nbasic  education  have  been  supported  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  Fewer  development \nagencies  are  involved  with  higher  education,  with  the  exception  of  ADB,  GTZ/Reconstruction \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2006.

One  recently  approved \nWorld Bank project for strengthening teacher development and teacher education should benefit \nthe proposed Project.  \n \n24. \nAid  coordination  in  the  education  sector  occurs  through  the  education  sector  working \ngroup, with the major focus on basic education. The group has been working for some time to \nestablish  a  policy  dialogue  board  with  Government  leadership.  Recently  the  Government \nannounced  that  it  will  establish  a  high-level  policy  board  to  review  education  sector  policy,  to \nwhich development partners will be invited to discuss specific issues. This provides a stronger \nforum  for  strategic  policy  development,  and  will  facilitate  Government\u2013development  partner \ncoordination. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons \n\n \nA review of ADB projects in technical and vocational education (TVE) across the Asia-\n25. \nPacific  region5  concludes  that  linkages  with  industry  are  the  single  most  important  factor  in \ntraining success. To strengthen school\u2013industry linkages, the review recommends incentives for \nemployers to participate in advising or directing TVE. Encouraging school managers to involve \nindustry  in  the  running  of  schools  is  also  important.  Entrepreneurship  training,  marketing  and \nbusiness support  were  found  to  be  neglected  in  many  projects.  An  impact  evaluation  study  of \nADB TVE projects observed that most TVE projects focus on short-term training as a safety net \nfor  the  disadvantaged,  while  disregarding  quality  and  industry  demands.  To  redress  this,  the \nstudy  recommends  a  shift  to  a  competitive  advantage  orientation  by  investing  in  a  number  of \nkey  institutions  producing  well-qualified  graduates.6  The  use  of  competency-based  training \nfurthers  quality  improvements  and  quality  assurance  by  establishing  competency  standards \nagreed  with  industry.  These  lessons  have  been  incorporated  in  the  Project\u2019s  design.  National \nand  local  linkages  with  industry  will  be  promoted  through  formal  partnerships;  and  assessors \nfrom local industry will be paid to assess students completing competency-based modules, and \nto train teachers. School managers will be trained in business management practices involving \ncloser  links  with  the  private  sector.  The  Government\u2019s  decision  to  invest  significantly  in  a \nnetwork  of  high-performing  schools  through  the  Project,  while  continuing  other  Government \nprograms aimed at upgrading poorer quality schools and expanding access in rural areas, aims \nat achieving the twin objectives of high-quality training combined with broad access.  \n \nThe sustainability of TVE programs is the most critical issue after linkages with industry. \n26. \nThe  continued  success  of  the  VSs  and  teacher  training  institutions  established  under  earlier \nADB  projects  augurs  well  for  sustainability.  Continued  public  investment  is  assured  following \nsignificant  increases  in  national  and  local  education  budgets,  for  both  public  and  private \nschools, coupled with awareness that public investment in vocational education over the past 15 \nyears has been too low. Most schools have active partnerships with local industry. During the \nProject,  cost  savings  resulting  from  better  efficiency  and  increased  income  generation  will \ncontribute  to  sustainability.  ADB  evaluations7  recommend  that  schools  develop  annual \npreventive maintenance plans to protect their assets. These will be required under the Project. \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2004. Improving Technical Education and Vocational Training. Strategies for Asia.

Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nA national subsidy program for operation and maintenance was introduced in 2007.  \n \n27. \nIn  Indonesia,  recent  experience  with  education  projects  continues  to  support  the  view \nthat  the  most  effective  means  for  bringing  about  sustainable,  whole-school  development  is  to \nchannel funds directly to schools while allowing flexibility in their usage. The advantages of this \napproach are closer supervision of the use of funds by schools; better outcomes at lower cost; \nmore appropriate facilities, books, and programs; and a resultant building of capacity for project \nmanagement  within  institutions.8  As  a  result,  all  levels  of  government  now  use  this  approach \nwhen  providing  funds  for  school  development.  However,  evaluation  of  the  Government\u2019s \nsubsidy  system  for  school  operating  costs  indicates  that  stronger  systems  for  school  financial \nmanagement and compliance are needed.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n \nA. \n \nIn partnership with the Government, the Project is expected to increase the international \n28. \ncompetitiveness  and  employment  opportunities  for  VS  graduates,  which  is  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s economic and industry policy agenda. The medium-term outcome of the Project \nis  expected  to  be  improved  quality  and  relevance,  expanded  access  and  greater  efficiency  in \nVE. Key success indicators include (i) a 20% increase in enrollment in model VSs; (ii) upgrading \nof  teaching  in  academic  subjects,  especially  mathematics,  science,  and  English,  to  national \nstandards  through  upgraded  curricula  with  increased  time  allocations  in  model  and  alliance \nschools;  (iii)  agreements  with  local  industry  to  carry  out  student  skills  assessment  in  at  least \n50%  of  model  VSs;  (iv)  entrepreneurship  start-up  programs  in  all  model  VSs;  (v)  trials  of \narrangements with international agencies for mutual skills recognition in at least 40 model VSs. \n  \nB. \n \n29. \nThe Project will produce four outputs to help ensure that 90 selected VSs are developed \nas  model  schools  with  (i)  refocused  school  management  using  a  business  approach; \n(ii) improved  quality  of  teaching  and  learning;  (iii)  strengthened  school\u2013industry  linkages;  and \n(iv)  enhanced  entrepreneurship  focus.  A  TA  grant  will  be  provided  to  support  increased \nefficiency,  close  links  with  industry,  and  more  diversified  courses  by  offering  after-school \ncourses for skills improvement and retraining.        \n \nThe project design has two key features. The first is a national school cluster structure in \n30. \nwhich 90 model schools will form the center of clusters consisting of 3\u20134 surrounding schools. In \nall,  230  alliance  schools  will  be  mentored  by  the  model  schools  and  benefit  from  training \nopportunities  and  minor  equipment.  The  Project  is  a  national  project  with  at  least  one  model \nschool cluster per province. In all, the Project covers 20% of districts. The 90 model VSs will be \nselected through a two-stage process from among 212 VSs (of which 10 are private) that MONE \nhas  already  designated  as  \u201cinternational  standard  schools.\u201d  In  the  first  stage,  120  VSs  will  be \nselected  based  on  an  assessment  of  the  data  available  and  the  school  development  plans \nprepared for DTVE. In the second stage, 90 of the 120 schools will be selected based on the \n\n                                                 \n8   These results are evident in two ongoing projects: ADB. 2000.

The 90 SBPs that best \ndemonstrate  how  the  schools  can  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  objectives  will  be  granted \nfunds. The criteria for selecting model VSs will ensure broad district geographic representation, \nparticularly  in  areas  with  good  prospects  for  industry  expansion  and  strong  school\u2013industry \nlinkages; a balance among different types of schools and programs; a female enrollment share \nof 40%; potential for expansion; and strong local government commitment. Selection criteria for \nalliance schools include good potential for quality improvement as well as geographic proximity \nto the model VS. To give smaller and lower quality private schools an opportunity to learn from \nthe model schools, they will comprise around 50% of the alliance schools. The model\u2013alliance \nscheme will spread the benefits of improved management and teaching and learning practices \nfrom the model to the alliance VSs. Replication of the strategy will be fostered by treating the 30 \nVSs  not  selected  as  model  schools  as  the  core  for  the  next  batch  of  model  schools  to  be \ndeveloped by the Government. The 120 candidate VSs are listed in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n31. \nThe  second  key  feature  of  the  design  is  the  SBP.  Around  75%  of  project  funds  will  be \nused to finance the SBPs, of which two thirds will be channeled directly to schools to empower \nthem through the planning and management of their own resources and programs to meet the \nGovernment\u2019s  objectives  of \nthis \nmechanism  is  now  used  widely  in  Indonesia,  the  approach  used  here  is  more  challenging  for \nschools as it will cover all aspects of a school\u2019s operations. The resources are also substantial \nenough  to  fully  fund  medium-term  plans  rather  than  just  specific  aspects.  Each  model  VS  will \nprepare a 4-year SBP that will be demand-driven and involve extensive consultations with local \nindustry.  The  SBP  will  include  annual  budgets  and  implementation  plans  that  will  be  updated \nannually.  It  will  be  financed  partly  by  funds  channeled  directly  to  the  school  (known  as  SBP \nfunds)  and  partly  by  the  central  provision  of  some  of  the  goods  and  services  specified  in  the \nSBP.  Appendix 4 provides a description of the SBPs and project fund flows. \n \n32. \nThe SBPs will be demand-oriented and results-based, specifying activities and a budget \nthat shows sources of funding for each activity, tied to specific performance indicators with the \nfollowing  options:  (i)  civil  works  upgrading  and  extension  to  improve  efficiency  and  increase \nenrollment; \nincluding  computer-aided \ninstructional  materials  and  software;  (iii)  human  resource  development  for  upgrading  general \nand  technical  teaching,  management  development,  and  entrepreneurship  for  both  model  and \nalliance  schools;  (iv)  partnerships  with  industry;  (v)  development  of  business  incubators  or \nsimilar schemes to assist students to trial business ventures; (vi) improvement and development \nof new activities in production units; and (vii) project implementation costs at school level. One \nof  the  components  of  an  SBP  will  be  improvement  of  the  technical,  management  and \nentrepreneurship skills of alliance schools. Outputs 2, 3 and most of 4 will be funded through the \nSBP  funds  paid  to  schools.  Output  1  (management  training)  and  VS  equipment,  management \nand teacher in-service training, and monitoring and evaluation services (under output 2) will be \nprocured through DTVE.  \n  \n \n \nTrain  School  Managers  in  Demand-Oriented  School  Business  Planning.  A  mixed \n33. \ntraining and mentoring approach will be taken to develop the SBPs. First, a uniform approach \nand methodology for the formulation of SBPs will be developed, and the results disseminated to \nselected  institutions  that  will  support  the  model  VSs  in  developing  their  SBPs.  For  around  6 \nmonths,  the  institutions  and  firms  will  provide  training  and  mentoring  to  principals,  senior \nteachers and school committee leaders in model schools, and facilitate development of SBPs by \nschool  management  and  the  school  committee.  The  completed  SBPs  will  be  reviewed  and \n\nRefocused School Management Using a Business Approach \n\nlearning  materials \n\n(ii)  equipment, \n\nteaching  and \n\n1. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nrefined  by  technical  and  industry  specialists  working  with  each  school,  before  being  assessed \nby an advisory panel of technical experts, including industry representatives. SBP funds will be \nallocated competitively, and tranche releases will be dependent upon performance as defined in \nthe SBPs.  \n \n34. \nDevelop a Business Approach to School Management. To enable managers to lead \nlarge and complex institutions more effectively, a new approach to school management will be \nencouraged.  An  integrated  program  of  management  training  will  be  provided  separately  by  a \nmanagement  training  firm  based  on  business  principles  including  annual  planning,  cost-\nefficiency,  business  development,  marketing  and  advocacy,  effective  personnel  management \nand  accountability,  and  gender  awareness.  This  activity  is  an  essential  element  for  creating \ndynamic  and  well-managed  institutions  that  can  operate  effectively  and  efficiently.  The \nmanagement training will be provided annually to both model and alliance schools.  \n \n35. \nEstablish School Management Systems and Improve School Administration. While \nVSs  with  200\u2013300  students  can  manage  with  simple  management  information  systems,  the \nmove to larger institutions demands more sophisticated systems with wider usage by staff. The \nProject  will  therefore  support  the  development  of  computerized  education  management \ninformation systems and financial management systems, and will provide in-house support and \nfollow-up  to  ensure  their  proper  use  in  planning  and  monitoring  in  both  model  and  alliance \nschools. Efficiency and effectiveness indicators will be developed for schools to use in project \nreporting,  with  all  relevant  staff  trained  in  their  use.  The  aim  is  also  to  develop  indicators  that \ncan  be  used  long  beyond  the  Project  to  increase  accountability  and  sustainability.  As  MONE \nhas  already  made  a  substantial investment  in  the  national education  management  information \nsystem, it will be relatively inexpensive to extend the system to a school-based system that can \nassist school management. This will be a requirement for all model schools. \n \n36. \nImprove  Internal  Communication  Systems  and  Establish  Networks.  As  the  model \ninternal  and  external \nschools  expand  and  develop, \ncommunications  to  share  innovations  and  best  practice.  The  Project  will  support  internet \nconnections to enable project schools to share information and advice. A project website will aid \ninformation  sharing  among  the  model  and  alliance  VSs,  as  well  as  the  development  of  e-\nlibraries to broaden the technical knowledge base of schools.    \n \n \n \nThe bulk of the SBP funds will be used to improve teaching and learning quality. The aim \n37. \nis to encourage model VSs to develop their own plans and to assess the relative priorities of (i) \nupgrading or constructing new facilities; (ii) providing new, or upgrading and relocating existing, \nequipment;  (iii)  new  teaching  and  learning  tools\u2014computer  learning  aids,  textbooks,  online \nlearning services, etc.; and (iv) upgrading teachers\u2019 technical and academic skills. The SBPs will \nidentify school development priorities in relation to national and local skills demand, and will link \nthese  school  priorities  systematically  to  existing  and  planned  new  course  offerings,  planned \ncurriculum  and  teacher  development  activities,  and  proposed  facilities  and  equipment  needs. \nThe  SBP  activities  will  aim  to  put  each  school  in  a  better  position  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s \nobjectives  of  improved  quality  and  expanded  access.  This  will  necessitate  efficiency  and \neffectiveness gains in the core business of the VSs\u2014delivering skills training.  \n \nImprove  Facilities  to  Increase  Efficiency,  Expand  Enrollments  and  Extend  Hours \n38. \nof Operation. The extent to which new facilities and equipment are required, and the type, will \nbe identified in the SBPs after each school has assessed its capacity for expansion in line with \n\nImproved Quality of Teaching and Learning \n\nthey  will  need \n\nimprove \n\ntheir \n\nto \n\n2. \n\n\fskills  demand  and  efficiency  gains.  Although  the  physical  facilities  in  VSs  are  generally  good, \nadditional facilities will be necessary to expand enrollment and achieve the desired efficiencies. \nSchools  will  be  able  to  obtain  professional  advice  on  proposed  capital  works.  Refurbishment \ncosts may also arise, especially where existing schools amalgamate to create larger institutions. \n \n39. \nThe  equipment  in  most  of  the  better  VSs,  including  those  selected  for  the  Project,  is \nadequate  for  basic  training  but  needs  to  be  updated  to  meet  current  industry  standards.  \nEmerging  areas  in  electronics,  computer-aided  manufacturing  and  information  technology  will \nrequire  new  equipment.  An  equipment  specialist  will  advise  the  model  schools  to  ensure \nequipment  purchases  are  in  line  with  skills  demand  and  planned  SBP  activities  in  terms  of \nproposed  training  programs,  curriculum  and  teacher  development,  and  instructional  materials. \nEach school will get the equipment it prioritizes and will pay for it out of its SBP allocation. The \nalliance schools will also be provided with selected minor equipment, based on an internal and \nexternal  assessment  of  their  equipment  needs.  SBPs  will  be  required  to  include  a  preventive \nmaintenance plan to ensure that new facilities and equipment can be maintained properly.  \n \nImprove  the  Teaching  of  Academic  and  Technical  Subjects.  To  improve  teaching \n40. \nskills  and  reach  national  standards  in  core  academic  subjects  (especially  mathematics  and \nscience) and industry standards in technical subjects, teachers will be offered a comprehensive \nin-service training program. The program will cover all teachers in model schools and half of the \nteachers in alliance schools. DTVE will implement the in-service training program together with \nother relevant institutions and industry. The curriculum in core subjects will be strengthened to \napproximate  the  curriculum  for  general  schools,  and  revised  curriculum  guidelines  and \ntextbooks  will  be  issued.  Curricula  for  new  skills  training  courses  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation  with  industry.  All  teachers  will  receive  intensive  training  in  English  to  meet  the \nrequirements for international standard schools. Training in multimedia approaches and the use \nof  computer-aided  instruction  will  be  a  further  priority.  MONE  will  carry  out  long-term \nqualification upgrading and professional certification of teachers through the Directorate General \nof  Quality  Improvement  of  Teachers  and  Education  Personnel.  As  there  is  currently  only  a \nfledgling system for the professional certification of vocational teachers, this will be developed \nunder the Project.  Appendix 5 provides the human resource development plan. \n \nDevelop  New  Learning  Methodologies  Suitable  to  Large  Institutions.  The  use  of \n41. \nnew  teaching  methodologies  such  as  group  learning,  project  learning,  computer-aided \ninstruction,  and  self-paced  learning  is  an  essential  element  of  the  strategy  to  develop  larger \nschools  of  international  quality.  In  addition,  a  stronger  emphasis  on  competency-based \nassessment  will  be  necessary.  The  intention  as  the  Project  progresses  is  that  teachers  will \nfacilitate learning through a wide variety of techniques, and that learning will not be confined to \nthe  classroom  and  workshop.  Activities  to  achieve  this  output  include  research  studies, \nexamination  and  review  of  DTVE  guidelines  and  school  standards,  plus  trials  of  new \napproaches at all model VSs. \n \n42. \nProvide  New  Instructional  Materials  and  Software.  Teaching  and  learning  materials \nare both scarce and outdated in most VSs. New instructional materials will be identified for each \nschool  following  decisions  about  the  new  teaching  methodologies  to  be  introduced  and  the \ncontent  of  the  training  program.  Additional  instructional  materials,  including  e-learning  tools, \ncomputer-aided instruction and software will be required in most schools. \n \n \n \n43. \n\nSupport  Partnerships  between  Schools  and  Industry.  To  support  close  ties  with \n\nStrengthened School\u2013Industry Linkages \n\n3. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nExamine  Opportunities  for \n\nindustry, each model school will enter into at least one formal arrangement with a local industry \npartner  to  share  knowledge  and  expertise.  Each  school  will  be  expected  to  deliver  more  than \nthree courses per year for skills improvement and retraining of workers. In these ways, VSs will \nbuild  relationships  with  local  industry  that  have  two-way  advantages:  industry  will  benefit  by \nhaving workers\u2019 skills upgraded and the schools will gain a better knowledge of industry needs. \nThe enhanced linkage will facilitate appropriate student work placements and job placement, as \nwell  as  strengthen  the  career  center  programs  through  which  some  VSs  already  provide  a \nlimited number of upgrading courses to workers. \n \n44. \nSupport New Courses to Meet Local Industry Needs. This activity will build upon and \nenhance the career center programs to strengthen VS links with local industry. The Project will \nsupport  a  series  of  school-based  research  studies  to  investigate  the  needs  and  priorities  of \nschools and local industry, and explore new opportunities for men and women. The studies will \nbe  carried  out  by  local  trade  or  business  experts.  In  the  second  stage,  new  short  courses  for \nexisting  workers  will  be  developed  and  trialed  by  VS  in  collaboration  or  cosponsorship  with \nindustry partners. Evaluation of the trials will be led by industry experts. Given the experimental \nnature of this work, not all courses are expected to be successful. In the long term, successful \ncourses could be institutionalized where similar industry needs exist. \n \n45. \nInternational  Benchmarking  and  Trial  Selected \nInternational  Standards  and  Benchmarks  in  Cooperation  with  Industry.  This  activity \nresponds  directly  to  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on  international  standard  schools,  specifically \nrelated to VSs. The model schools will examine opportunities for students to obtain international \ncertification. At present, this is available to VS students in the field of computer operations, who \nobtain  certification  recognized  by  multinational  ICT  companies,  and  hotel  management  and \ntourism.  These  opportunities  can  be  extended.  As  well,  new  fields  such  as  auto-mechanics, \naircraft maintenance, rigging and scaffolding, and heavy machinery operation will be examined.  \n \nThe milestone for this activity is that at least 40 model schools will enter arrangements \n46. \nwith  multinational  or  international  companies  or  organizations  for  mutual  skills  recognition \narrangements  by  2011.  Moreover,  based  on  trials  by  model  schools,  MONE  will  be  able  to \nassess  the  opportunity  for  entering  formal  agreements  with  multinational  or  international \norganizations for system-wide mutual recognition or international skills recognition.  \n \n \n \nA quarter of VS graduates become self-employed, and require general business skills in \n47. \naddition to technical skills. For new graduates, the job search can be lengthy as they lack basic \nworkplace  skills.  Entrepreneurship  training,  business  incubators  and  production  units  provide \nbasic workplace and business experience needed for self-employment and the workplace.  \n \n48. \nProvide  Assistance  to  Students  to  Start  Their  Own  Businesses.  This  activity  will \ninvolve  the  piloting  of  business  incubators  or  similar  initiatives  designed  locally  to  suit  local \nopportunities.  For  example,  a  group  of  students  might  be  assisted  to  rent  premises  or  hire \nequipment, or they may be given access to school equipment after teaching hours. In all cases, \nthey will be mentored by a staff member or a community expert. Each model school will make \nits own assessment of opportunities in its region for successful student businesses and include \nits  proposals  in  its  business  plan.  Some  model  schools  are  expected  to  enter  partnership \nagreements with local chambers of industry or other private entities with similar objectives.  \n \n49. \n\nStrengthen  Entrepreneurship  Education.  The  need  for  increased  entrepreneurship \n\nEnhanced Entrepreneurship Focus  \n\n4. \n\n\fProject Investment Plan \n\neducation  is  recognized  by  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  which  has  developed \ntwo programs for young people to teach them about business and give them the skills to plan \nand  open  their  own  businesses.  Some  VSs  already  have  qualified  trainers  accredited  by  ILO \nand  offer  courses  based  on  ILO  materials.  The  Project  will  associate  with  ILO  (or  a  similar \norganization) to enable the model schools to train staff in the use of the material and deliver the \ncourses. All model schools will be involved in this initiative. About 80% of students are expected \nto undertake the basic modules and 40% the more advanced modules. \n \nEnhance Production Units. These units are an important feature of VSs and comprise \n50. \nactivities  organized  by  the  school  to  produce  goods  and  services  sold  to  the  public.  This  is  a \npractical  means  of  giving  students  hands-on  experience  while  offsetting  direct  costs  and \ngenerating revenue for other school operations. They are an introduction to the world-of-work. \nUnder  the  Project,  model  schools  will  be  able  to  include  in  their  SBP  investments  related  to \nproduction units provided they can demonstrate that the unit is viable. \n \nC. \n \n51. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $115 million, including contingencies of $4.4 \nmillion,  and  local  taxes  and  financing  charges  of  $2.5  million  (Table  1).  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 6. \n \n52. \nAround  three-quarters  of  the  total  project  funds  will  be  used  to  support  the  SBPs  for \nmodel  schools,  of  which  65%  will  be  channeled  directly  to  schools.  These  funds,  termed  SBP \nfunds, will cover civil works and minor equipment, teaching and learning materials, partnerships \nfor  alliance  schools), \nwith \nentrepreneurship  development,  promotion  of  production  units  and  business  incubators,  and \nproject  management  in  schools.  Major  items  of  equipment  and  the  management  and  teacher \ndevelopment  programs  will  be  determined  through  the  SBPs  but  procured  centrally.  Around \n60% of the project funds are expected to be used to upgrade physical facilities and equipment \nto international standard. About 80% of the  SBP funds will be used to modernize and expand \nphysical facilities and equipment in line with the planned business directions. \n \n\nindustry,  some  human \n\nresource  development \n\n(including \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($\u2018000) \n\n1.

The \nGovernment  counterpart  funds  will  be  used  for  SBP  funds  (32%  of  the  total  amount),  project \nmanagement, and taxes and duties (Table 2).  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n80.0 \n35.0 \n115.0 \n\n% \n70 \n30 \n100 \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nE. \n \n \n \n54. \nThe  Directorate  General  for  the  Management  of  Primary  and  Secondary  Education \n(DGMPSE)  will be the Executing Agency and  will be  responsible for overall implementation of \nthe  Project.  The  director  of  DTVE  will  be  the  project  director  and  will  provide  implementation \nsupport to DGMPSE. The project management unit (PMU) has been established by DGMPSE, \nunder the guidance of the project director. The PMU is headed by a project manager and will be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation,  planning  and  budgeting,  procurement, \ndisbursement,  monitoring,  supervising,  overseeing  of  implementation  in  project  schools,  and \nsubmitting the required reports to the Government and ADB. The PMU will have at least 25 staff \nmembers  from  DTVE,  including  technical,  finance,  monitoring,  and  administrative  staff.  The \nPMU will also include a technical working group comprising full-time DTVE staff, who will work \nclosely with consultants on each project component. An advisory expert panel will conduct the \ninitial evaluations of SBPs using agreed criteria and procedures, and the annual evaluations of \nschool  performance  thereafter.  The  panel  will  comprise  a  core  group  of  around  five  education \nand  industry  representatives,  hired  as  PMU  consultants,  with  an  ad  hoc  pool  of  experts  in \nspecific vocational fields to be called upon when required. The panel will be chaired by one of \nthe technical experts. The school committee in each of the model schools will be responsible for \nimplementing the approved SBP. Each school committee will be headed by a chairperson with \nthe school principal acting as the secretary, and assisted by an implementation team consisting \nof members of the school committee and teachers. The secretary of the school committee will \nreport to the PMU. A budget allocation to support the school committee will be required under \neach SBP. The organization structure is presented in Appendix 7.   \n \n55. \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  guide  the  PMU  on  general \npolicy,  intersectoral  coordination  and  strategic  direction.  The  deputy  minister  for  Human \nResources and Cultural Affairs, BAPPENAS will chair the PSC. The PSC will be supported by a \nproject  technical  committee  that  will  be  chaired  by  the  director  of  Religious  Affairs  and \nEducation,  BAPPENAS.  The  PSC  and  PTC  will  comprise  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of \nFinance,  MONE,  BAPPENAS,  the  Ministry  of  Manpower,  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  the \nChamber of Commerce.  \n \n \n\n\f2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n56. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years, from 1 June 2008 to 31 May 2013. First-\nyear activities will focus on human resource development and the SBPs. In subsequent years, \nproject  funding  and  support  will  be  allocated  in  accordance  with  approved  SBPs  and \nperformance. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n \n \n57. \nProcurement of goods and services financed under the loan will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Contracts  for  the \nrefurbishment of the PMU office including equipment and furniture will be awarded on the basis \nof  shopping  for  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less,  and  by  national  competitive \nbidding  for  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than  $100,000  up  to  $500,000. \nCivil works, teaching materials, textbooks, furniture and instructional aids will be procured using \nnational  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than \n$100,000  up  to  $500,000,  and  shopping  for  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less. \nContracts  for  works,  goods  and  equipment  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  will  be \nawarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. The procurement plan is in Appendix \n9 and the procurement capacity assessment is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n \n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n \n58. \nAll consultants to be financed from the loan proceeds will be selected in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Individual \nnational  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  guide  the  development  of  SBPs  and  to  provide \npreparatory training to ensure a uniform approach. Institutions and firms will be engaged to help \nmodel  VSs  prepare  SBPs  and  the  PMU  with  selecting  qualified  consultants.  Consultants  for \n(i) the review and refinement of SBPs and SBP implementation; (ii) management development; \nand  (iii)  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  reporting  will  be  engaged  through  firms  on  the  basis  of \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  with  80:20  weighting.  MONE,  through  the  PMU,  will  be \nresponsible for selecting and hiring consultants. Individual consultants will be hired to assist the \nPMU. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 10. \n \n \n \n59.  MONE  will  undertake  advance  contracting  to  speed  up  project  implementation. \nDGMPSE may start consultant selection, but this will not include the signing of contracts.  \n \n \n \n60. \nThe imprest account will be established at the Bank of Indonesia or a state-owned bank \nto  be  agreed  between  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  account  will  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  initial  amount  to  be deposited  into  the  imprest  account shall \nnot  exceed  the  lower  of  (i)  the  estimated  expenditure  for  the  first  6  months  of  project \nreplenishment, or (ii) the equivalent of 10% of the loan amount. The statement of  expenditure \nprocedure may be used to liquidate or replenish the imprest account for contracts not exceeding \n$100,000.  SBP  funds  will  be  remitted  directly  from  the  imprest  account  to  the  school \ncommittee\u2019s bank account. Remittances will be based on a payment order authorizing financing \nof the SBPs. The funds flow to schools is shown in Appendix 4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n6. \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing and Reporting \n\n \n61. \nEach school committee will be required to establish and maintain a separate account at \na local branch of a bank acceptable to ADB, and evidence of the use of the SBP funds for audit \nby the PMU and the government audit agency. The SBP funds deposited into this account will \nbe used exclusively for activities approved in the SBP.  Each school committee will submit to the \nPMU  quarterly  and  annual  financial  reports.  The  PMU  will  carry  out  spot  checks  on  VSs  by \narranging for semiannual audits of accounts and records of a sample of model schools. In cases \nof fund misuse or irregularity, the PMU may suspend activities at the schools involved until the \ncase  is  resolved.  Any  fund  recovery  will  be  determined  by  the  PMU  investigative  panel,  in \ncollaboration  with  ADB.  The  Government\u2019s  audit  agency  will  audit  all  accounts  annually  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  practices  and  submit  its  findings  to  MONE  and \nMinistry of Finance to ensure that the SBP funds are used properly and that cases of irregularity \nand fraudulent practice are handled properly. \n \n62.  MONE  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project  that  identify  goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  It  will  ensure  that  accounts  and  financial \nstatements  are  audited  annually  by  the  Government\u2019s  audit  agency  or  other  certified \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  auditor  will  prepare  a  report  on  the  use  of  loan \nfunds,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  use  of  the  imprest  account,  and  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedures;  issue  findings  of  any  irregularities  or  discrepancies;  and  recommend \ncorrective  measures  so  that  the  financial  statements  and  audited  accounts  will  be  certified  by \nthe auditor as meeting generally accepted accounting practices. The auditors will provide audit \nstandards and key procedures in their report. The financial management capacity assessment \nfor MONE is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n63. \nDTVE will submit the audited financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report on the project \naccounts,  including  the  imprest  account  and  use  of  the  statement  of  expenditure,  to  ADB  in \nEnglish within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. The PMU will prepare and submit to \nADB  and  DTVE  quarterly  reports  on  the  status  and  progress  of  project  implementation  within \n20 days  after  each  quarter.  The  reports  will  have  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  indicate \nprogress  made  against  established  targets,  status  of  performance  indicators,  problems \nencountered and actions taken, compliance with loan covenants, and the proposed program of \nactivities  for  the  following  quarter.  Within  3  months  after  project  physical  completion,  the \nGovernment will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report.  \n \n \n \n64. \nThe  Government  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate)  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing  international  best  practice  standards  to  prevent  corruption  or  money  laundering \nactivities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities. The investment documentation between ADB and the Government will allow ADB to \ninvestigate any  violation  or  potential  violation of  these  undertakings.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  DTVE  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n65. \n\nThe  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n8. \n\n\frequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. The Project will (i) build capacity \nwithin DTVE and model VSs to understand and comply with ADB and government procedures \nas  outlined  in  the  project  administration  manual;  and  (ii)  widely  publicize  in  schools  and \ncommunities the existence of the integrity division within ADB\u2019s Office of the Auditor General, as \nthe  initial  point  of  contact  for  allegations  of  fraud,  corruption,  and  abuse  in  ADB-financed \nprojects.  A  project  website  will  be  developed  to  disclose  information  about  project  matters, \nincluding  procurement.  The  Project  will  establish  a  computerized  financial  management \ninformation  system  in  model  VSs  and  enforce  strict  reporting  requirements.  Finally,  to \nencourage  more  stakeholder  vigilance  as  well  as  ensure  greater  accountability,  a  complaints \nand action task force will be set up at the PMU to receive and resolve grievances or act upon \nstakeholders\u2019  reports  of  irregularities.  The  task  force  will  (i) review  and  address  grievances  of \nproject stakeholders, in relation to either the Project, any of the service providers, or any person \nresponsible  for  carrying  out  the  Project;  and  (ii)  set  the  threshold  criteria  and  procedures  for \nhandling such grievances, for proactively responding to them, and for providing the stakeholders \nwith notice of the mechanism.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Management and Review System \n\n \n66. \nA  comprehensive  and  gender-disaggregated  project  management  information  system \n(PMIS)  will  be  designed  for  different  levels  of  management,  including  DTVE,  provincial  and \ndistrict education offices, and model schools. A user manual will be developed, and workshops \nconducted for provincial, district, and model and alliance school staff. The workshops will help \nofficials appreciate the value of the PMIS, and provide technical training. A national consultant \nwill  be  contracted  to  design  the  PMIS,  develop  the  manual,  and  conduct  the  training.  Project \nperformance  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  by  a  firm  providing  consultants  to  monitor  the \nprogress of programs in accordance with the agreed indicators and targets. \n \n67. \nResponsibility  for  the  internal  monitoring  of  project  implementation  performance  will  lie \nwith  the  project  monitoring  unit  in  the  PMU,  shared  with  the  provincial  and  district  education \noffices.  The  SCs  in  each  of  the  90  model  VSs  will  assume  a  vital  role  in  monitoring \nimplementation at schools, particularly in relation to the oversight and management role of the \nschool  committee  and  the  generation  of  data  for  the  monitoring  system.  The  Project  will  help \nstrengthen  district  management  information  systems  by  ensuring  that  all  required  data  is \nsubmitted  by  schools  to  districts.  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  contracted  to  a \nreputable  firm  or  institution,  which  will  carry  out  compliance  monitoring  through  regular  and \nsystematic  audits  of  a  sample  of  model  VSs  and  conduct  the  baseline,  midterm,  and  final \nevaluation  surveys.  This  firm  will  also  assist  the  PMU  in  designing  the  internal  monitoring \nsystem, and provide training and support during implementation. The monitoring and evaluation \nframework is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\nProject Review \n\n10. \n \n68. \nThe Government and ADB will review the Project\u2019s progress jointly at least twice a year. \nThey  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm  review  shortly  after  the  PMU\u2019s  submission  of  the  third \nannual  report.  The  midterm  review  will  focus  on  overall  project  strategy  and  achievements, \nwhich  may  require  adjustments  of  targets  and  processes,  and  reallocation  of  resources. \nSpecifically,  the  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  project  scope,  design,  implementation \narrangements,  and  human  resource  development;  (ii)  assess  project  implementation  against \nprojections and performance indicators; (iii) review compliance with loan covenants; (iv) identify \ncritical  issues,  problems,  and  constraints;  and  (v)  recommend  changes  in  project  design  or \nimplementation.  One  month  before  the  review,  the  PMU  will  submit  to  ADB  a  comprehensive \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nreport on each of these issues. Following project completion, a project completion report will be \nprepared to assess early impact and identify lessons.  \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n69. \nADB  will  provide  a  TA  grant  to  help  selected  model  schools  introduce  skills  upgrading \nand  certification  programs  for  workers,  and  to  develop  a  coherent  policy  framework  for \nsustainable  upgrading  programs  in  the  vocational  school  system.  The  total  TA  cost  will  be \n$665,000.  ADB  will  provide  $500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \nGovernment will contribute the balance of $165,000, in kind. The TA will support the Project by \nstrengthening the links of vocational schools with industry, improving school sustainability, and \nexpanding skills upgrading opportunities for workers. \n \n70. \nImpact and Output. The expected impact of the TA is that Indonesian workers will have \nbetter  access  to  opportunities  for  skills  upgrading,  allowing  them  to  move  up  in  their  careers, \nreenter the workforce, or find skilled positions overseas. The outcome is expected to be wider \nopportunities for skills upgrading for workers delivered through VSs on a demand-driven basis, \nin collaboration with industry. Although some schools have already established career centers \nto  undertake  such  initiatives,  they  are  ad  hoc.  A  set  of  trials,  which  are  well  researched  and \nmonitored, will provide the basis for the confident expansion of such courses. This is consistent \nwith the long-term objectives for the vocational education system.  \n \n71.  Methodology and Key Activities. The TA activities comprise (i) a desk study review of \nexamples  of  international  best  practice  in  vocational  skills  upgrading;  (ii)  a  review  of  skills \nupgrading  activities  in  model  VSs  and  development  of  a  database;  (iii)  an  intensive  review  of \nbest  international  practice  in  two  other  countries  to  gather  ideas  for  implementing  skills \nupgrading  courses;  (iv)  an  investigation  of  the  feasibility  of  international  links  to  develop  joint \ncooperation  for  international  certification,  linkages,  and  mutual  recognition;  (v)  a  series  of \npractical trials in 10 VSs; and (vi) preparation of a final report, based on the results of the trials, \nwith recommendations for a sustainable skills upgrading program in VSs.  \n \n72. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  MONE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA;  the \nDirectorate of Technical and Vocational Education will be the Implementing Agency. The TA will \nbe undertaken over 2 years. A small task force will be created to oversee the TA, and DTVE will \nappoint a senior staff member as TA coordinator for all matters pertaining to the TA. ADB will \nengage a qualified consulting firm or educational institution to implement the TA. The firm will be \nselected  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  of  the  international  consultant  in  association \nwith national consultants. The firm will provide one international expert for 6 person-months and \none national consultant for 8 person-months. The final TA output will be a comprehensive report \nthat  summarizes  outcomes  of  the  school  trials  and  identifies  directions  for  the  sustainable \ndevelopment of VS upgrading programs. A summary of the TA is in Appendix 11. \n  \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\n \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \n73. \nEconomic Benefits. The Project will raise education quality and efficiency in 90 model \nVSs and initiate similar improvements in 230 alliance schools, thus establishing a presence in \n20% of all districts in Indonesia and reaching 10% of VS students. By the sixth year after project \nstart-up,  30,000  students  will  be  graduating  each  year  from  the  model  VSs.  If  the  improved \nstandards are sustained over 15 years, the model VSs will have produced 0.5 million graduates, \n\n\fand the alliance schools 0.25 million graduates. \n \n74. \nThe  quantifiable  project  benefits  were  calculated  based  on  the  productivity  increase \nrequired to achieve a 12% economic rate of return. The bulk of the quantifiable benefits accrue \nto  the  working  graduates  from  the  model  schools.  Project  outputs  include  367,000  male  and \nfemale working graduates generating 3.7 million work-years between year 4 and year 20 of the \nProject.  The  net  increase  in  productivity  of  these  graduates  at  a  conservative  12%  economic \nrate of return is equivalent to 30 minutes of additional productivity per worker per day worked or \n13  additional  days  per  worker  each  year.  The  Project\u2019s  marginal  productivity  gain  with  a  12% \neconomic rate of return is equivalent to an additional 230,000 work-years.  \n \n75.  While  a  12%  economic  rate  of  return  is  considered  easily  achievable,  a  higher  rate  of \nreturn appears more likely. Although labor force surveys do not allow estimation of the return to \nquality,  anecdotal  evidence  from  schools,  employers,  and  parents  indicate  that  the  return  to  a \nbetter quality education can be measured in much larger wage premiums ranging from half to \ndouble the median wage; a 50% premium would result in a rate of return of 30%.  \n \n76. \nFurther  benefits  accrue  from  the  enhanced  partnerships  with  industry  by  reducing  the \nsearch  time  for  the first  job  and  by reducing  the  amount  of  employment  mismatch.  A  1-month \nreduction  in  job  search  time  accruing  to  career  development  center  enhancement  would \nincrease  project  benefits  by  a  further  31,000  work-years.  The  entrepreneur  development  and \nbusiness incubators will enable recent graduates destined to become own account workers or \nowners  of  microenterprises  to  establish  more  productive  businesses  and  reduce  the  rate  of \nstart-up  failure.  Starting  in  year  9,  the  Project  will  support  the  development  of  at  least  3,000 \nsuccessful  microenterprises  per  year  generating  99,000  jobs  and  580,000  work-years  of \nemployment through the student assistance for business and business incubators.   \n \n77. \nleadership  development,  business  planning, \nmanagement,  and  financial  information  system  training  to  2,396  administrative  staff  in  the  90 \nmodel  schools,  230  alliance  schools  and  33  provincial  offices.  Subject  matter  and  technical \nskills training will be provided to 10,428 teachers. While this training is necessary to realize the \nproject benefits, other indirect benefits will accrue to improved capacity for non-project activities. \nThe summary financial and economic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \n78. \nSocial and Poverty Benefits. Given that almost half of VS students are from poor and \nlow-income households (cottage industry, drivers, self-employed), the channeling of investment \nto VSs is a powerful tool in promoting social equity. As enrollments expand, more students from \nlower-income families will enter VE. The Project will initially benefit 22,000 such students each \nyear. VE will place male and female graduates in a more competitive position as they enter the \nlabor force, as they will have more marketable skills and workplace experience. The time taken \nto find jobs will also be reduced; in schools with a good reputation, students even now are hired \ndirectly  upon  graduation  by  the  companies  where  they  gained  workplace  experience.  Getting \nyoung  people  into  work  quickly  is  important  for  the  economy  and  for  alleviating  the  loss  of \nconfidence and social ills that accompany prolonged job search and unemployment. The gender \nanalysis and strategy includes actions aimed at creating equal opportunities for VS participation \namong both young  men and women. These specific actions  will be incorporated into SBPs and \nnational and school project implementation in response to local conditions (The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13; the summary gender strategy is in Appendix 14). \n \n79. \nThe  career  counseling  offered  by  VSs,  as  well  as  the  exposure  to  different  types  of \nenterprises and industry during training, will help students make more strategic job choices. The \n\nStaff  development  will  provide \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nopportunity to take part in skills enhancement through the upgrading programs in career centers \nwill allow continuing career development. Skills upgrading and entrepreneurial skill development \nare  especially  important  for  women,  who  often  struggle  to  reenter  the  labor  force  after  child \nrearing, and is essential in an economy where one third of all employment is informal.  \n \n80. \nEnvironment  and  Social  Safeguards.  The  Project  involves  upgrading  of  existing \nschools where all work, including construction of new classrooms, will be carried out on existing \nschool  property.  Project  support  for  physical  construction  will  only  be  extended  if  the  land \nrequired  is  already  owned  by  the  school.  School  upgrading,  particularly  rehabilitation,  will \nrequire  management  of  possible  hazardous  and  nonhazardous  solid  wastes.  These  potential \nimpacts will be managed through standard construction contract requirements. As the schools \nare  located  in  urban  areas,  other  construction  impacts  such  as  road  blocking  or  traffic \ndisturbances,  noise  and  dust,  and  silt  runoff  must  be  similarly  managed.  No  negative \nenvironmental  impact  is  expected.  As  project  schools  are  located  in  city  or  district  urban \ncenters, no encroachment will occur on indigenous people\u2019s territory.  \n \nFiscal  Impact  and  Sustainability.  A  financial  plan  showing  the  fiscal  impact  of  the \n81. \nProject  and  identifying  the  funding  needed  to  finance  project  expenditures  during  and  beyond \nthe  project  period  was  prepared.  The  financial  sustainability  analysis  is  based  on  the \nassumption that gross domestic product (GDP) will continue to grow with relative real growth of \n5%, that the share of public expenditure will remain unchanged, and that education expenditure \nas a percentage of GDP will increase to around 20% annually in line with the National Education \nLaw. Project-related expenditures will increase annually and will reach $115 million during the \nlast  year  of  the  Project.  Some  commitments  will  terminate  at  the  end  of  the  Project.  The \ncontinuing annual incremental cost of $0.25 million after the Project ends will add $3 million to \nthe total from 2013\u20132025. This is feasible and sustainable, given the Government\u2019s commitment \nto educational expansion and development.  \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  efficiency  gains  in  the  model  VSs  by  lowering  unit  costs \n82. \nthrough  expanded  enrollment,  higher  utilization  of  facilities  and  equipment,  a  business-like \napproach  to  school  management,  and  stronger  financial  management.  Schools  will  increase \nrevenue  to  some  extent  through  stronger  and  more  numerous  partnerships  with  industry, \nbroader course offerings for workers and others, and increased output and better management \nof production units. The Government\u2019s annual commitment to the Project as a percentage of the \ncentral education budget ranges from 0.04% to 0.14%, and decreases to 0.01% by project end. \nThe  Government\u2019s  funding  share  is  estimated  to  increase  from  $1.5 million  in  year  1  to  more \nthan  $11  million  in  years  2  and  3  and  to  decrease  gradually  to  $1.5 million  by  the  end  of  the \nProject.  The  Government\u2019s  annual  commitment  for  the  Project  is  judged  affordable,  as  this \nrepresents only 0.01% of the MONE budget and 0.16% of the DTVE budget.  \n \nReplication  Strategy.  The  Government  is  committed  to  replicating  the  model  school \n83. \napproach in all districts, as part of the strategy to revitalize vocational education. The Project will \nincorporate the first stage of a replication strategy into the Project itself. The 90 model schools \nare to be selected from a shortlist of 120 schools. The 30 schools not selected will automatically \nbecome  alliance  schools,  thereby  immediately  receiving  some  project  support.  They  will \nsubsequently  form  the  foundation  for  the  next  batch  of  model  VSs,  and  receive  additional \nfinancial and other support toward the end of the Project. Local governments will be encouraged \nto  include  support  for  these  schools  in  their  5-year  plans,  with  this  support  coming  on-stream \nbefore the end of the Project. Provincial, district, and city governments have already indicated \ntheir  desire  to  play  a  key  role  in  project  planning  and  implementation,  as  well  as  their \ncommitment  to  providing  resources  for  future  model  school  development.  Guidelines  for  the \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\nreplication  of  model  schools  nationwide,  as  required  by  the  National  Education  Law,  will  be \nprepared  under  the  Project.  The  sustainability  and  replication  strategy  is  described  in \nSupplementary Appendix E.   \n \nB. \n \n84.  Macro.  The  Project  is  directly  linked  to  the  cornerstone  of  the  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan to improve quality and relevance through better linkages with industry. The \nmain  risk  in  any  project  that  invests  in  vocational  education  is  that  an  economic  downturn  will \noccur just as the project benefits are emerging. Economic downturns, especially for construction \nand  industry,  always  affect  skilled  workers  more  than  the  professional  work  force.  The  other \nmacro risk is that economic growth will be jobless growth. These risks are endemic to projects \ndirectly linked to government economic and industrial development. The emphasis of the Project \non entrepreneurship will assist in mitigating these risks because skilled workers will have both \nbig industry and micro-industry options. \n \nCurrent  commitment  to  policy  reform  is  expected  to  continue,  ensuring  the  longer-term \n85. \nsustainability  of  the  reform  process.  This  seems  likely  over  the  next  decade  because  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  strong  interest  in  expanding  the  number  of  skilled  workers  and  entrepreneurs; \nissuance  of  the  Education  Strategic  Plan  2005\u20132009  resulting  from  extensive  consultations \nbetween  MONE,  BAPPENAS  and  Parliament;  a  nationwide  campaign  to  promote  vocational \neducation and regular consultations between MONE and industry on vocational education.  \n\nProject. \n\nInsufficient \n\nin  Government \n\n86. \nGovernment  resources  for  VE  are  expected  to  continue,  despite  the  large  amount  of \nresources still needed to finance the compulsory 9 years of basic education. This appears more \nlikely  now  than  in  the  past  because  of  MONE\u2019s  strong  thrust  to  expand  VE  substantially.  The \nGovernment  has  also  launched  new  economic  policies  to  lessen  barriers  to  direct  investment, \nencourage small and medium-sized industries, and give institutional incentives to business. \n \n87. \nfinancial \ntransparency  and  accountability \nmanagement and accounting processes are a potential project risk, which will be mitigated by \n(i) support  for  governance  reforms  through  technical  support  for  strengthened  financial \nmanagement and reporting in project schools, along with public disclosure; (ii) managing SBP \nfunds through school committees to strengthen community governance and accountability; and \n(iii)  extensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  and  public  information  systems.  The  financial \nmanagement capacity assessment indicates that DTVE\u2019s financial management system meets \nADB requirements but the financial management systems of many VSs will need strengthening. \n \n88. \nAnother  risk  is  that  school  principals  and  senior  management  will  aim  for  enrollment \ngrowth  rather  than  structural  and  management  change,  and  will  lack  the  capacity  to  manage \nlarge  VSs  successfully.  This  will  be  mitigated  through  a  careful  school  selection  process, \ntraining  in  leadership,  a  business  approach  to  management,  and  strategic  planning  to  help \nprepare school principals and local education officials for the changes envisaged. \n \nThe  model  schools  may  have  difficulty  retaining  better-skilled  technical  teaching  staff \n89. \ngiven  their  low  salaries.  The  Government  plans  to  introduce  financial  incentives  for  teachers \nfulfilling qualification standards and having full teaching loads; this will reduce the risk. The long-\nterm  financial  sustainability  of  the  model  VSs  will  be  addressed  through  efficiency  gains  from \nhigher enrollment, partnerships with industry, and income-generating measures. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA.  \n \n90. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  DTVE  have  given  the \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.  DGMPSE  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation \nrequests  to  MOF  and  MOF  will  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated \nfunds during each year of project implementation. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  the  smooth  flow  of  funds  from  central  level  to  the \nmodel schools in accordance with the flow of funds mechanism agreed between \nthe Government and ADB.  \n\nThe Government and DGMPSE will ensure that only model schools meeting the \nagreed  eligibility  criteria  for  grant  assistance  set  out  in  Appendix  4  to  this \ndocument will receive funding under the Project. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nThe  Borrower  will  ensure  that  each  of  the  school  committees  will  establish  a \nseparate account at a local branch of a bank acceptable to ADB, for the purpose \nof the SBP funds. The Government will further ensure that the SBP funds will be \nused exclusively for the activities approved under the model VS SBP.  \n\n \n(v)  Within  12  months  following  the  loan  effective  date,  DGMPSE  will  design  and \nstandardize  a  comprehensive  PMIS  for  the  different  levels  of  management \nincluding  for  DGMPSE,  the  provincial  education  offices,  and  model  schools. \nFurthermore, DGMPSE will develop a users\u2019 manual within same period of time. \n\nTo  ensure  that  women  benefit  equally  from  the  Project,  the  Government  and \nDGMPSE  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998)  and  the  agreed  gender \nanalysis and strategy described in Appendix 14 to this document.  \n\n \n(vii)  Within 9 months following the loan effective date, DGMPSE will create a project \nwebsite  to  disclose  information  about  various  matters  on  the  Project,  including \nprocurement.

The task force will (a) review and address grievances of \nstakeholders  of  the  Project,  in  relation  to  either  the  Project,  any  of  the  service \nproviders,  or  any  person  responsible  for  carrying  out  any  aspect  of  the  Project; \nand  (b)  set  the  threshold  criteria  and  procedures  for  handling  such  grievances, \nfor  proactively  and  constructively  responding  to  them,  and  for  providing  the \nstakeholders with notice of such mechanism.  \n\nforce \n\ntask \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\n\f(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\nAlthough no significant environmental impacts were identified, the siting, design, \nconstruction, and operation of school facility rehabilitation work undertaken under \nthe Project will be implemented in line with the Government\u2019s environmental laws \nand  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  All  civil  works  contracts \nwill contain standard requirements for environmental impact mitigation. \n\nThe Government and DGMPSE will ensure that it will not approve any SBP funds \nif  the  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  the  new  school  facilities  will  involve \ninvoluntary  resettlement  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy \n(1995). To be eligible for SBP funds the schools are required to confirm that no \nland  acquisition  or  resettlement  is  required  under  the  Project.  Construction  of \nnew  classrooms  will  be  added  to  existing  model  schools  on  unoccupied  land \nalready owned by the model schools. \n\nDGMPSE will ensure that the construction of multistory buildings will comply with \nconstruction  safety  standards.

Net enrollment is \nestimated  at  94%  for  primary  and  64%  for  junior  secondary  education  (gross  enrollment  rates \nare  115%  and  83%,  respectively).  Internal  efficiency  rates  in  basic  education  have  also \nimproved,  with  repetition  and  dropout  rates  below  3%.  The  number  of  graduates  from  the \ncompulsory 9 years of basic education increased steadily over the last decade, to more than 3 \nmillion  annually.  These  graduates  are  increasingly  demanding  senior  high  school  education, \nwith  83%  of  junior  secondary  graduates  currently  making  the  transition.  The  first  steps  to \nintroducing  12  years  of  compulsory  education  have  been  taken  by  encouraging  districts  with \nuniversal basic education coverage to pursue this strategy independently. \n \nSenior secondary education (SSE) covers about 50% of eligible students, of whom 82% \n2. \nare  aged  16\u201318,  in  diversified  vocational  senior  secondary  schools  (VSs)  and  academic  or \ngeneral  senior  secondary  schools  (GSs).  Net  enrollment  is  around  40%.  In  comparison  with \nother  Asian  countries,  access  to  SSE  is  in  the  mid-range  and  is  surpassed  significantly  by \nneighboring  Malaysia,  Thailand,  the  Philippines  and  Viet  Nam.  However,  based  on  population \nprojections of the senior secondary-aged population, the Government is targeting an increase in \nSSE enrollments to 9 million students by 2009, yielding a gross enrollment rate of almost 70%. \nParticular emphasis will be placed on increasing VS enrollment to fulfill the needs for mid-level \nemployment in specific sectors.  \n \n3. \nIn  2006,  of  the  approximately  3.8  million  SSE  students,  about  60%  were  in  general \neducation  (Table  A2.1).  General  education  is  the  natural  choice  for  students  who  aim  to \ncontinue  on  to  higher  education.  However  about  one  half  of  all  exiting  GS  students  do  not \nproceed to higher education and enter the labor market at the conclusion of their courses. VS \nstudents still have opportunities for higher education, but the path is not as straightforward. \n   \n\nTable A2.1: Senior Secondary Education: Number of Schools and Students, 2000\u20132006 \n\n \n\n \n\n2000 \n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n2006 \n\nNo. of VS \n\nPupils of VS \n\nNo. of GS \n\nPupils of GS \n\nYear \n\nPublic \n\nPrivate \n\nTotal \n\nPublic \n\nPrivate \n\nTotal \n\nPublic \n\nPrivate \n\nTotal \n\nPublic \n\nPrivate \n\nTotal \n\n771 \n796 \n\n838 \n\n899 \n\n1,159 \n\n1,262 \n1,464 \n\n3,658 \n3,726 \n\n4,429 \n4,522 \n\n579,892  \n596,147  \n\n1,354,045  \n1,431,317  \n\n1,933,937  \n2,027,464  \n\n2,897  \n  2,925  \n\n5,083   7,980  \n4,860   7,785  \n\n1,721,342  \n1,791,935  \n\n1,217,172  \n1,232,241  \n\n2,938,514  \n3,024,176  \n\n4,105 \n\n4,943 \n\n598,876  \n\n1,500,877  \n\n2,099,753  \n\n  3,120  \n\n4,916   8,036  \n\n1,827,046  \n\n1,316,684  \n\n3,143,730  \n\n4,216 \n\n5,115 \n\n608,441  \n\n1,533,133  \n\n2,141,574  \n\n  3,203  \n\n5,035   8,238  \n\n1,886,701  \n\n1,371,272  \n\n3,257,973  \n\n4,506 \n\n5,665 \n\n636,064  \n\n1,528,004  \n\n2,164,068  \n\n  3,634  \n\n5,265   8,899  \n\n2,000,241  \n\n1,402,374  \n\n3,402,615  \n\n4,662 \n4,974 \n\n5,924 \n6,438 \n\n640,342 \n644,619 \n\n1,642,014 \n1,756,024 \n\n2,282,356  \n2,400,643 \n\n3,940 \n \n\n5,377 \n  \n\n9,317 \n9,903 \n\n2,069,243 \n  \n\n1,428,177 \n \n\n3,497,420 \n3,785,471 \n\nGS = general senior secondary school, VS = vocational senior secondary school. \nSource: Education Management Information System, Ministry of National Education. \n \n4. \nEnrollment growth in both general senior secondary education and vocational education \n(VE)  from  2000  to  2006  has  been  quite  rapid,  at  29%  and  24%  respectively.  The  number  of \nschools  has  increased  even  more  rapidly,  especially  for  VSs,  from  4,429  in  2000  to  6,438  in \n2006\u2014a growth rate of 45%. This is no doubt a response by local government and, less so, the \nprivate  sector,  to  strong  community  demand  for  vocationally  oriented  schooling.  Over  recent \nyears, about 20% of applicants have failed to gain admission to VSs.  \n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nfor  VE,  alongside  growing  government  concerns  about \n\nThe  private  sector  contributes  significantly  to  both  general  and  VE,  with  enrollment \n5. \nshares  of  73%  and  40%  respectively.  The  high  private  share  in  VE  partly  reflects  decisions \nabout public involvement. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Government invested heavily in VE, but \nover time the provision of vocational training was increasingly left to the private sector. By 2002, \n83% of VSs were privately run. Imbalances in the provision of training resulted, with more than \nhalf  focusing  on  business  and  management  training  and  only  one  third  on  technology  and \nindustry. However, today this situation has changed, with wage returns and other labor market \noutcomes  now  better  for  VS  than  GS  graduates.  This  is  reflected  in  the  growth  of  community \nincreasing  youth \ndemand \nunemployment. The larger public investment is reflected in the rapid growth of public VSs, which \nincreased  90%  over  the  last  6  years  compared  with  private  school  growth  of  34%.  Most  VSs \nconcentrate their teaching activities on a set of related areas. Business and management is the \nmost popular program for both public and private schools, followed by technology and industry. \nTourism, agriculture, and forestry programs are more concentrated in the public sector.  \n \n6. \nThe  system  is  generally  efficient  with  regard  to  student  flow.  Completion  rates  exceed \n95%,  with  dropout  rates  of  around  5%,  and  overall  repetition  rates  of  below  0.5%.  Almost  all \nrepetition  is  for  boys  in  grades  1  and  2.  Around  40%  of  classroom  time  is  devoted  to  general \nacademic  subjects  such  as  English,  Indonesian,  physics,  chemistry,  and  mathematics,  which \nare adapted to the area of specialty. The Ministry of National Education (MONE) estimates that \naround 60% of VS graduates enter the labor market through formal employment, around 25% \ntry  to  set  up  their  own  businesses  usually  as  part  of  a  group,  and  10%\u201315%  pursue  further \nstudies.  \n \nDespite the popular demand for VE, significant problems exist. The quality of academic \n7. \neducation  and  relevance  of  vocational  courses  are  generally  not  well  regarded  by  employers, \nand many argue that the labor market outcomes do not justify the cost of VE (because of the \nlower  student\u2013staff  ratios  required  in  workshop  and  technical  classes  and  the  cost  of \nconsumables, etc.; the average recurrent cost per student in a VS is currently 25% higher than \nin  an  academic  school).  The  focus  on  business  and  entrepreneurship  skills  to  help  graduates \nestablish their own small businesses is also seen as too weak. Finally, VSs are seen as highly \ngender-segregated and ineffective in reaching the poor.   \n \nA. \n \n \n \n8. \nAll SSE students take final national examinations, on which VS students perform slightly \nbelow GS students (5% lower in 2005/06). Public VS students outperform private VS students in \nall  subjects.  Failure  rates  of  22%  are  high,  despite  improvement  in  recent  years.  The  general \npublic perception is that the quality of VE is lower then general education. Given concerns about \nthe  quality  of  the  academic  subjects  being  provided  for  VE  students,  MONE  has  decided  to \nincrease the time allocation and difficulty level for English, mathematics, and science subjects. \n \nQuality  standards  are  being  raised  through  the  establishment  of  international  standard \n9. \nschools,  as  mandated  in  the  National  Education  Law  (20/2003).  At  least  one  international \nstandard  school  is  to  be  established  in  each  district.  The  VE  subsector  has  led  the  way,  with \naround  200  VSs  already  identified  and  supported  with  additional  funding.  Performance  and \nother standards have been identified for international standard schools, including performance \non  academic  courses,  standards  on  competency  tests  for  vocational  courses,  English \n\nQuality and Relevance \n\nMajor Issues \n\n1. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\ncompetency  among  students  and  teachers,  good  facilities,  and  a  link  with  at  least  one \ninternational partner. \n \n10. \nTeacher  Quality.  The  quality  of  teachers  and  the  teaching\u2013learning  process  are \nfundamental  to  learning  outcomes.  VSs  face  difficulties  in  recruiting  and  retaining  good \nteachers,  especially  teachers  with  industry  experience.  Around  68%  of  VS  teachers  teach \nvocational  subjects.  Only  62%  meet  current  qualification  standards  (a  degree  in  education),  a \nfurther 11% have a non-education degree. Part-time staff are used widely, particularly in private \nschools; this allows schools to hire industry personnel as teachers. Training in pedagogy will be \nneeded to transform the traditional teaching methods generally used by VS teachers. \n \n11. \nRelevance  in  technical  and  vocational  education  is  assessed  through  employer \nsatisfaction  with  the  quality  of  graduates  and  labor  market  outcomes.  The  only  data  available \nrelates to the situation of vocational graduates in the labor market. Vocational school graduates \ncomprise 25% of the skilled labor force and outperform graduates of general schools, with the \ndifference  being  particularly  marked  for  girls  (Table  A2.2).  They  have  a  higher  labor  force \nparticipation rate than GS graduates\u2014about 10% higher overall and 25% greater for women\u2014\nand  are  also  20%  more  likely  to  be  in  the  formal  sector;  while  this  is  not  a  guarantee  against \npoverty,  it  does  provide  greater  certainty  of  a  regular  income.  Unemployment  rates  are  lower \nthan  for  diploma,  academy,  or  university  graduates.  The  wage  returns  are  also  impressive  as \nthese  graduates  not  only  outperform  GS  graduates  in  obtaining  quality  jobs  but  also  earn \nslightly more, especially women. All of these indicators have been noted by parents and political \nleaders in particular, and are partly responsible for the explosion in growth of vocational schools \nacross the country.  \n\n \nTable A2.2: Labor Force Participation and Earnings:  \nGS and VS Graduates \n\n \n\nItem \n\nGS \n\nVS \n\n67.6 \nLabor Force Participation \n14.8 \n% of Total Labor Force \n56.2 \n% in Formal Sector \n43.8 \n% in Informal Sector \n18.1 \n% Unemployed \n% Underemployed \n13.5 \nEarnings in Rp/month, formal sector 1,045,303.0 \n\n77.6 \n7.1 \n66.2 \n33.8 \n17.3 \n13.2 \n1,079,580.0 \n\nGS = general senior secondary school, VS = vocational senior secondary school. \nSource: Labor Force Survey, 2006. \n\nAll \nWorkers \n\n66.2 \n100.0 \n31.1 \n68.9 \n10.3 \n27.4 \n997,000.0 \n\n \nNevertheless, questions remain about the relevance of vocational courses, including the \n12. \ngap  between  the  courses  and  industry  needs,  the  slow  response  to  changing  labor  market \nneeds  and  technological  advances,  the  cost  of  vocational  education,  and  the  focus  on  formal \nemployment rather than entrepreneurship skills.  \n \n \n \n13. \nSchool Size. Most VSs are too small to provide economies of scale or improved quality \nthrough  more  varied  courses  and  stronger  teaching  teams.  The  average  VS  in  2006  had  380 \npupils, while many had less than 200. To reduce running costs, the trend to smaller school sizes \n\nInternal Efficiency \n\n2.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n3. \n\nSocial Equity \n\nmust  be  reversed  and  school  size  increased  significantly.  A  move  to  larger  schools  will  have \nbenefits in terms of efficiency and the quality of vocational courses. \n \n14. \nTeacher\u2013School  and  Pupil\u2013Teacher  Ratios.  The  average  number  of  teachers  per \nschool  is  low  at  48  per  school  for  public  VSs  and  28  per  school  for  private  schools.  This  has \nimplications  for  teaching  quality  and  the  potential  for  teachers  to  upgrade  their  skills.  It  also \nindicates  that  many  schools  will  lack  a  critical  mass  of  teachers  in  each  discipline.  The  pupil\u2013\nteacher  ratio  is  12:1  for  public  and  13:1  for  private  VSs.  These  ratios  are  low  by  international \nstandards, especially as nearly half of the students are in business studies. The average class \nsize of 36, on the other hand, is quite high, indicating short working hours associated with small \nschool size. An increase in school size will alleviate these inefficiencies and reduce overstaffing.  \n \n \n \n15. \nOnly  40%  of  pupils  who  begin  primary  school  enter  SSE,  with  around  33%  graduating \n(an  increase  from  22%  over  the  past  decade).  The  main cause  is  the  low  continuation  rate  of \n72%  from  primary  to  junior  secondary  (excluding  madrasah),  which  has  proved  stubbornly \nresistant to Government efforts to raise it. Given the links between poverty and continuation, not \nsurprisingly  the  lowest  income  quintiles  are  underrepresented  in  SSE.  VSs,  however,  cater \nmore to the poor than GSs, with a slightly U-shaped distribution. Representation is highest for \nthe  middle  quintiles  3  and  4  (22%\u201323%),  slightly  lower  for  quintiles  1  and  2  (15%\u201319%)  and \nquintile  5  (21%).  Equity  is  greater  in  urban  than  rural  areas.  The  distribution  range  for  GSs  is \nmore regressive, rising steadily from 13% for the first quintile to 27% for the fifth. To encourage \nmore  poor  students  to  enter  SSE,  the  Government  has  been  giving  scholarships  to  10%  of \nstudents  since  2005.  The  greater  problem,  however,  is  to  increase  the  number  of  poor \ngraduates from junior secondary education. \n \n16. \nThe overall gender gap for SSE enrollment is small: 52% of students are male. However, \nthese  figures  mask  marked  differences  across  schools  and  programs.  Many  schools  are \nessentially  single-sex,  overwhelmingly  male,  or  overwhelmingly  female.  All  of  the  schools  with \nlarge  female  enrollments  offer  programs  in  tourism  and/or  information  and  communication \ntechnology. None of the schools offering construction, machinery, or automotive have less than \n90% male enrollment and most are 95\u201398% male. Moving girls into male-dominated programs \nis usually difficult, but new opportunities for girls in electronics, surveying, drafting, megatronics, \nand \nidentified.  These  emerging \nopportunities for girls will need to be taken into account during the planned school expansions. \nFurther,  decisions  to  expand  the  size  of  particular  institutions  will  have  direct  effects  on  the \nrelative opportunities for females and males to participate in vocational education. \n \n\ninformation  and  communication \n\ntechnology  are  being \n\n4. \n\nLabor Market \n\n \n17. \nVocational  courses  are  designed  to  prepare  graduates  for  direct  entry  to  the  labor \nmarket, but unemployment among these graduates remains a concern: VS graduates make up \n7.1% of the total workforce, but they are 9.2% of the unemployed workforce. Given the types of \nskills  that  VS  graduates  have  learned,  many  would  be  suited  to  self-employment.  Entry-level \npositions  in  the  labor  market  will  remain  tight  for  new  entrants  over  the  next  few  years,  and \nagriculture will remain the dominant form of employment.  \n \nIndonesia,  as  other  economies,  has  skill  shortages  that  impact  on  the  capacity  for \n18. \nbusiness  investment  and  economic  growth.  But  such  shortages  are  generally  for  experienced \nworkers. In response to the training needs of these workers, DTVE has been developing career \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\ncenters offering upgrading courses to workers to enable them to seek promotions and new and \nbetter jobs, be more productive in their own businesses, or to work overseas. In this way the VS \nsystem will expand its focus to embrace a more comprehensive skills training role. \n \n\n \n5. \n\nEducation Policy Directions \n\n \n19. \nThe  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  2004\u20132009  targets  for  SSE  reflect  the \nneed  to  broaden  access  in  response  to  the  expansion  of  junior  secondary  education,  and  to \nsupply  SSE  graduates  to  the  labor  market  with  training  relevant  to  market  demand.  The \nGovernment plans to increase gross enrollment rates for SSE to 69% (about $9.07 million) by \n2009 by increasing the transition rate from junior secondary to SSE to 90%. In the case of VE, \nthe  plan  notes  specifically  the  importance  of  improving  quality  and  relevance  through  better \nlinkages with industry. MONE\u2019s Education Strategic Plan 2005\u20132009 acknowledges the need to \nexpand SSE in anticipation of increased output from basic education.  \n\n \n\nStrategic Response to the Issues Raised \n\nB. \n \n20. \nThe  Project\u2019s  rationale  and  design  is  in  response  to  the  broad  policy,  strategies,  and \ninstitutional  features  derived  from  this  sector  assessment.  In  addition,  the  project  design \nresponds  to  the  unique  opportunities,  challenges,  and  potential  risks  facing  the  VE  subsector. \nDemand for VE is being sustained and is growing. Improving and sustaining the VS system is \ncritical if the Government\u2019s goals to provide young people with marketable skills, reduce youth \nunemployment,  and  create  a  competitive  work  force  are  to  be  achieved.  The  educational \nresponse to these imperatives is that \u201caccess to vocational education should be expanded cost-\neffectively while quality and relevance are raised.\u201d Two overarching strategies are suggested to \nachieve this goal: (i) link the development of VE to industry and internationally accepted quality \nstandards; and (ii) take a cost-effective phased approach to expansion by targeting a number of \nexisting schools with the potential to expand and develop into dynamic training institutions, while \nsharing  their  experience  with  a  wider  pool  of  schools.  Within  these  broad  strategies,  a \ndiscussion  of  the  major  thrusts  proposed  for  addressing  the  issues  raised  in  the  sector \nassessment follows. \n \nExpansion of Access and Equity. The Project will help expand access to SSE, and VE \n21. \nin particular, by establishing different types of VS to serve needs in different areas. For remote \nareas,  small  schools,  integrated  senior  secondary  schools,  and  greater  use  of  ICT  will  be \nintroduced, while large lead VSs will be established in industrial areas. These larger schools will \nact as models for emulation by other VSs, thus expanding access. To run these large schools \nsuccessfully,  a  number  of  fundamental  changes  will  be  needed.  First,  a  turnaround  in \nmanagement  practices  and  organization  structures  of  the  VSs  will  be  critical.  Central  to  this \napproach is the need for VSs to become more entrepreneurial in their approach to training to be \nable  to  enter  into  commercial  arrangements.  Second,  facilities  must  be  used  more  efficiently, \nrequiring high utilization rates for buildings, classrooms, and equipment. Third, carefully targeted \nplanning  of  new  facilities  and  equipment  will  be  needed,  as  well  as  rehabilitation  of  existing \nteaching space to expand enrollment and improve efficiency.  \n \n22. \nAs  many  VS  students  come  from  the  middle-  and  lower-income  quintiles  (cottage \nindustry,  drivers,  self-employed),  the  channeling  of  investment  to  VSs  is  a  powerful  tool  in \npromoting social equity. And as enrollment expands, more students from lower-income families \nare likely to enter training. Gender equity will be addressed by encouraging programs that offer \nnew  and  emerging  opportunities  for  girls  particularly  in  the  areas  of  information  and \ncommunication technology and other new technologies.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRelevance and School\u2013Industry Linkages. To improve the relevance of VS courses, \n23. \nstronger  links  with  industry,  including  partnerships,  skill  enhancement  of  workers,  and \ninternational certification of students to multinational competency standards, are essential. The \nnew  trend  for  VSs  to  offer  short  skills  training  courses  to  graduates  and  existing  workers  will \nreinforce ties with local industry, while the strengthening of production units in schools will forge \ncloser  ties  with  the  local  economy.  VSs  must  respond  to  the  needs  of  their  students  by \npreparing them for current labor market conditions through the development of specific skills as \nwell as general workplace skills. Entrepreneurship skills are especially important. Extending the \nscope of school production units to providing support to students after graduation will facilitate \nthe involvement of graduates in small businesses. \n \n24. \nQuality of Teaching and Learning. One of the constraints to the balanced expansion of \nVSs  will  be  the  availability  of  qualified  teachers.  MONE  is  introducing  a  national  certification \nprogram for teachers, but arrangements for the certification of teachers' technical skills remain \nunclear.  The  development  of  this  system  is  urgent  to  ensure  that  technical  teachers  are  not \nexcluded  from  the  benefits  of  certification.  Equally  important,  VS  students  must  have  a  solid \ngeneral  education.  Industry  needs  flexible  workers  with  the  ability  to  calculate,  communicate, \nwork in teams, be responsible citizens, and be able to cope with new technologies. The quality \nof  education  in  the  general  subjects  must  be  equivalent  to  that  in  GSs.  Teachers  will  need \ntraining  in  new  ways  of  teaching  and  learning  to  encourage  self-paced  learning,  learning  in \nteams,  and  other  innovative  learning  strategies  more  appropriate  for  large  institutions. \nContinuous  improvement  in  the  efficiency  of  teaching  methods  will  be  essential.  Wider  use  of \ninformation  and  communication  technology  across  the  curriculum  will  be  critical  in  helping  VS \ngraduates compete in a competitive labor market.  \n \nC. \n \n25. \n \n\nThe opportunities and challenges for the VE system can be summarized as follows: \n\nPriority Opportunities and Challenges \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nExpansion  of  the  system  must  be  achieved  by  changing  the  management  and \noperation  of  existing  schools  rather  than  by  further  proliferation  of  schools. \nLarger,  more  efficient  schools  have  better  potential  to  improve  access  and \nquality. \n\nA start must be made in this process; some model schools must test appropriate \nways to develop new approaches to school management, teaching and learning, \nand links with industry. This will be the key to quality and expansion. \n\nTo achieve these objectives, the model VSs will need to be provided with a range \nof  support:  equipment  and  works,  management  development,  teacher  training, \nand  assistance  with  industry  linkages.  In  addition,  VSs  should  enhance  the \nlearning  of  entrepreneurship  within  the  curriculum  to  prepare  students  for \nemployment. \n\n(iv) \n\nVSs  also  need  to  reach  out  beyond  students  16\u201318  years  old.  The  Indonesian \nworkforce needs access to skills upgrading, and VSs have the potential to make \na significant contribution to meeting this need. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nProject Name \nIndonesia\u2013German Institute (IGI) \nWest Java, Central Java, East Java, \nBanten, North Sumatra \n\nIndonesia\u2013Australia Partnership in \nSkills Development (IAPSD) \n\nValue and Year \n\nPhase 1 (2001\u20132004)  \n\u20ac10 million grant \nPhase 2 (2005\u20132007)  \n\u20ac2.5 million grant and  \n\u20ac6 million loan \nPlanned: Phase 3  \n(2008\u20132010)  \n\n$25 million  \n \nJul 1998\u2013Mar 2005 \n\nVocational and Technical Education \nProject \nADB Loan 1319-INO \nAll 26 provinces \n\n$85 million \n \nApr 1995\u2013Jan 2001 \n\nSenior Secondary Education Project \nADB Loan 1360-INO \nAll 27 provinces \n\n$110 million \n \nJul 1995\u2013Oct 2000 \n\n$100 million \n \nSep 1991\u2013Jun 1998 \n\n$85 million \n \nMar 1991\u2013Oct 1998 \n \n\nTechnical Education Development \nProject \nADB Loan 1100-INO \n \n \n\nAgricultural Technology Schools \nProject \nADB Loan 1050-INO \nWest and Central Java, D.I \nYogyakarta, Aceh, Jambi, Bengkulu, \nSouth Sumatra, Lampung West, South \nand East Kalimantan, Central and \nSoutheast Sulawesi, Bali, West and , \nEast Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and Irian \nJaya \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE  \n\nFocus of Assistance \n\nThe project aims to improve the quality of the labor force through vocational education and \ntraining in 5 IGI centers, which collaborated with 17 IGI partner institutes.

The project had three components: (i) improving \nteaching and learning; (ii) supporting industrial growth through human resource development; \nand (iii) improving management practices. The teaching and learning improvement included \nsupporting the introduction of competency-based training, providing instructional materials, \nenhancing students\u2019 industrial exposure through practice in industry and business, and \nupgrading teachers\u2019 skills. The project also developed 28 new schools and provided new \nequipment and materials to 25 existing schools. \n\nThe project aimed to improve the quality of SSE, address imbalances in the provision and \nstandards of educational facilities and resources, and improve the capacity of the Ministry of \nEducation and Culture to deliver SSE. The project upgraded 1,250 schools, and trained \nprincipals, teachers, and staff in about 3,000 schools under four technical teacher training \ncenters. \n\nThe project helped to render the technical education system more relevant and responsive to \nthe needs of industry as well as consolidate the gains made in earlier projects. The overall \nobjective was to improve the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of the SSE technical \neducation system. The project upgraded 47 public trade schools as well as teacher training \ncolleges, including assistance with income-generating units. \n\nThe project improved the quality of agricultural technology education; provided equitable \naccess to agricultural schools for rural students, especially on islands other than Java; and \ndeveloped entrepreneurial skills of teachers and students to accelerate regional development \nand contribute to the growth of the agriculture sector. The project had three components: \n(i) educational programs development; (ii) educational facilities development for upgrading \n8 existing agricultural senior secondary schools; establishing 16 new schools; and providing \nequipment, instructional materials, and books; and (iii) production unit and entrepreneurial \nsupport, which involved providing production facilities and equipment, and seed capital for \noperating project implementation units. The project built upon the earlier Loan 675-INO. \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n\ni\n\n \n\n3\n5\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nProject Name \nSecond Vocational Education \nProject \nADB Loan 969-INO and \nADB Loan 970-INO (SF) \nAll 27 provinces \n\nThird Senior Technical Schools \nProject \nADB Loan 715-INO \nAceh; North, West, and South \nSumatra; Lampung; West, Central, and \nEast Java; South, Southeast, and \nCentral Sulawesi; West Nusa \nTenggara; and East Timor  \n\nAgricultural Education Project \nADB Loan 675-INO \nAceh; North, West, and South \nSumatra; Lampung; West, Central, and \nEast Java; South, Southeast, and \nCentral Sulawesi; West Nusa \nTenggara; Irian and East Timor  \nVocational Education Project \nADB Loan 574-INO \nAll 26 provinces \n\nValue and Year \n\n$70 million (OCR) and \n$30 million (SF) \n \nSep 1989\u2013Mar 1996 \n \n\n$83 million \n \nFeb 1985\u2013 Sep 1993 \n\nFocus of Assistance \n\nThe project improved the quality of senior secondary vocational education with limited \nincreases in enrollment. It was designed to build on the achievements of Loan 574-INO, \nparticularly by making use of new teacher training facilities, and improved curriculum and \nfacility standards. Two main components: development of (i) educational programs and  \n(ii) educational facilities by upgrading 48 VSs and establishing new schools in business and \ncommerce, and arts and craft. At least one school was upgraded in each of the 27 provinces, \nand new schools were established in Jakarta and underserved provinces. \n\nThe project improved quality and access to senior vocational education, leading to a better \nquality work force. The project built upon the earlier technical education projects. It upgraded \n24 trade schools in 11 provinces; and established 7 new trade schools in outer islands; three \nspecialized trade schools in shipbuilding, graphic arts, and industrial chemistry; a technical \ntraining center for private senior technical schools; and a technical teacher upgrading center.  \n\n3\n6\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\n$68 million \n \nApr 1984\u2013Dec 1992 \n\nThe project objectives were to (i) improve the quality and supply of skilled agricultural \nworkers, technicians, and teachers in agricultural schools and polytechnics; and (ii) provide \nproject schools with adequate agricultural education facilities. The project upgraded 18 \nagricultural schools; and established six new agricultural schools in the outer islands, a \nteacher training center for agriculture, six new polytechnics (five in the outer islands), and the \nPolytechnic Education Development Center for Agriculture. \n\n$40 million \n \nJun 1982\u2013Dec 1990 \n\nThe project aimed to improve the quality of education in public VSs in business and \ncommerce, home economics, and arts and crafts. It upgraded 48 VSs in 26 provinces; \nconstructed two technical teacher training centers; and provided fellowships to upgrade the \nqualifications and skills of teachers, supervisors, and administrative staff. \n\nSecond Senior Technical Schools \nProject \nADB Loan 488-INO \n\n$26 million \n \nNov 1990\u2013Aug 1990 \n\nThe project aimed to improve the quality of senior technological schools to produce better \nquality graduates for the labor market. It upgraded 16 technology schools and one technical \nteacher training center, and constructed a technical teacher training center. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, IAPSD = Indonesia-Australia Partnership in Skills Development, IGI = Indonesia\u2013German Institute, INO = Indonesia, OCR = ordinary \ncapital resources, SF = Special Funds, SSE = senior secondary education, VS = vocational senior secondary schools. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n37 \n\nSCHOOL BUSINESS PLANS AND FUND CHANNELING \n \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nAbout  70%  of  project  funds  will  be  channeled  directly  to  the  school  committees  of  the \n1. \nmodel  vocational  senior  secondary  schools  (VSs)  to  allow  them  to  plan  and  manage  their \neducational resources and programs according to their individual situations and needs to meet \nthe  Government\u2019s  policy  objectives.  Each  school  will  prepare  a  4-year  school  business  plan \n(SBP)  covering  all  aspects  of  its  operations  with  the  objective  of  improving  the  quality  and \nrelevance  of  the  education  it  offers  to  students.  Project  funds  will  finance  SBPs  that  clearly \ndemonstrate a school\u2019s capacity to contribute to the Government\u2019s objectives.  \n \nThe Project is based on a model\u2013alliance scheme that consists of 90 model schools and \n2. \n230 alliance schools. By the end of the Project, the model schools will enroll a large number of \nstudents;  have  successfully  implemented  income-generating  measures  through  new  demand-\noriented  training  courses;  produce  marketable  goods  in  their  production  units  and  have \nimplemented  partnerships  with  industry.  The  alliance  schools  will  have  the  same  programs  as \ntheir  local  model  school  and  will  have  potential  for  growth.  The  model\u2013alliance  scheme  will \nimprove  management  and  teaching  and  learning  technology,  which  will,  in  turn,  improve  the \nquality,  relevance  and  access  to  the  vocational  education  system.  Selection  criteria  for  model \nschools  include  (i)  provincial  geographic  representation  to  ensure  that  experience  can  be \ntransferred within each province, (ii) capacity to expand to up to 2,000 students and located in \nareas  where  industry  may  expand,  (iii)  representation  and  balance  among  different  types  of \nschools  and  programs  to  yield  a  gender  ratio  near  the  average  of  40%  girls,  (iv)  local \ngovernment commitment, and (v) linkages with local industry.  \n \nB.    Development of School Business Plans  \n \nThe Project will provide training in performance-based school planning and budgeting for \n3. \nschool management teams and provincial and district staff. Training in the latest approaches in \nschool-based  performance  planning  will  be  provided  to  selected  institutions  and  firms,  and  a \nmethodology  for  the  formulation  of  SBPs  developed.  These  institutions  or  firms  will  provide \ntraining  for  the  model  and  alliance  schools  and  facilitate  the  development  of  VS  plans  for \n6 months  in  year  1.  The  SBPs  must  be  developed  in  collaboration  with  local  industry.  The \ncompleted  SBPs  will  be  assessed  by  an  advisory  panel  consisting  of  education  and  industry \nexperts,  and  funds  allocated  competitively.  Subsequent  tranche  releases  will  be  dependent \nupon performance as defined by performance indicators in the SBPs. \n \n4. \nThe SBPs will be demand-oriented and results-based, and comprise an analysis of local \nand  national  skills  demand,  a  strategy  for  school  development  responding  to  these  demands, \nactivities and a budget specifying sources of funding for each activity, and specific performance \nindicators.  The  menu  options  include  (i)  civil  works  upgrading  and  extension  to  improve \nefficiency and increase enrollment; (ii) equipment, and teaching and learning materials including \ncomputer-aided  instructional  materials  and  software;  (iii)  human  resource  development  for \ntechnical  skills  upgrading,  management  development,  and \ngeneral \nentrepreneurship  for  both  model  and  alliance  schools;  (iv)  partnerships  with  industry;  (v) \ndevelopment  of  business  incubators  or  similar  schemes  to  assist  students  to  trial  business \nventures;  (vi)  improvement  and  development  of  new  activities  in  production  units;  and  (vii) \nproject implementation costs at school level. Each SBP will include a gender plan based on the \ngender  strategy  prepared  for  the  Project  (Appendix  14).  Schools  will  be  informed  that  all  civil \nworks must take place within existing school premises. One of the key components of an SBP \n\nteaching  and \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nDisbursement Procedures for SBP Funds \n\nwill  be  improvement  of  the  technical,  management,  and  entrepreneurship  skills  of  alliance \nschools.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe model schools will submit their SBPs to the project management unit (PMU) in the \nMinistry  of  National  Education  (MONE)  for  review  and  evaluation  by  technical  experts.  The \nexperts will recommend allocation of the funds on a competitive basis. Unapproved SBPs will be \nreturned to the schools for revision. Upon approval of the SBP, an MOU will be signed between \nthe school committee and the project director to authorize financing of the SBP. The MOU will \nspecify the name of the school, performance agreements, activities, bank account information, \nand amount of funding.  \n \n6. \nFunds will be allocated for each school to implement its SBP activities. SBPs will cover 4 \nyears and funds will be provided in annual tranches, based on SBP project commitments and \naccomplishments. The SBP fund for the first year will be based on the expenses approved for \nthe first year of SBP activities (year 2 of the Project). The subsequent releases will be based on \nreports from schools on progress achieved, and funds utilized and committed, submitted to the \nPMU  against  targets  in  the  business  plan.  Schools  will  make  any  necessary  adjustments  to \nyears  3,  4, and  5  and  submit  their updated  business  plans.  In conjunction  with  the  monitoring \nand evaluation specialists, the advisory panel of technical experts will evaluate the achievement \nof  performance  indicators  in  the  SBPs,  which  will  be  verified  by  the  PMU  prior  to  approval  of \nsubsequent tranche releases. VSs that do not perform will have their participation in the Project \nreconsidered,  or  funds  for  years  3,  4,  and  5  reduced  so  that  they  can  be  reallocated  to  more \nsuccessful VSs.  \n \n7. \nThe  SBP  funds  will  be  channeled  through  the  imprest  account,  with  payments  made \ndirectly to the school committee\u2019s bank account. The fund channeling mechanism for the SBP \nfunds  is  illustrated  in  Figure  A4.1.    Payments  may  also  be  made  through  the  direct  payment \nmethod illustrated in Figure A4.2. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe school committee of each model VS will be required to establish a separate account \nat  a  local  branch  of  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  maintain  evidence  of  the  use  of  the  SBP \nfunds  for  audit  by  the  PMU  and  the  government  audit  agency.  The  SBP  funds  deposited  into \nthis  account  will  be  used  exclusively  for  activities  approved  in  the  SBP.  Every  6  months,  the \nPMU  will  arrange  for  an  audit  of  the  accounts  and  records  of  a  sample  of  schools  as  a  spot-\ncheck  mechanism  to  ensure  that  the  SBP  funds  are  used  properly  in  accordance  with  the \napproved plan and budget. If irregularities, corruption cases, or fraudulent practices are noted in \nthe  use  of  the  SBP  funds,  the  PMU  will  investigate  and  take  administrative  and  legal  action \nagainst  the  school  and  individuals  involved.  The  PMU  will  report  to  ADB  and  issue  an  order \nsuspending the activities at the particular school until the case is resolved satisfactorily. When \nthe SBP funds are used improperly, fund recovery will be determined by the PMU investigative \npanel in consultation with ADB. A similar procedure will be followed for audits conducted by the \nGovernment  audit  agency.  MONE  will  also  request  the  audit  agency  to  audit  the  project \naccounts and statements of expenditures annually, and provide a management letter covering \ninternal  controls  and  procedures  associated  with  the  maintenance  of  project  accounts  and \npreparation of audited project accounts. The audited accounts should be submitted to ADB no \nlater than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year.  \n \n\nAccounting and Auditing  \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n39 \n\nE. \n\nCriteria for Allocation of SBP Funds \n\n \n\n9. \nA  shortlist  of  120  model  VSs  will  be  agreed  to  prior  to  the  start  of  the  Project.  After \npreparation  of  the  SBPs,  DTVE  will  appoint  an  advisory  panel  of  technical  experts\u2014from  the \neducation and business communities\u2014to help select 90 SBPs from among this group. The PMU \nand DTVE will provide secretariat and analytical assistance to the advisory panel. The panel will \nassess the SBPs of each VS, make recommendations on the funding needed, and provide each \nVS  with  a  non-binding  assessment  of  the  funding  needs  for  years  3  and  5  (subject  to \nsatisfactory  performance).  Each  VS  will  be  free  to  include  in  its  SBP  whatever  it  requires  to \nmeet  the  Government  and  project  objectives.  However,  DTVE  will  provide  advice  to  each  VS \nabout a lower and upper limit of funds for which to bid. This will be done to avoid getting bids \nthat  are  far  in  excess  of  the  total  funds  available.  After  each  quarter,  each  VS  will  report  on \nimplementation  of  its  SBP  and  any  required  changes.  The  advisory  panel  will  review  these \nperformance reports and recommend the allocation of funds for subsequent years. The advisory \npanel  will  reach  judgments  on  each  bid  and  be  free  to  negotiate  with  VSs  on  modifications  to \ntheir bids. However, transparency is essential and the panel will need to justify its decisions and \nrecommendations  to  the  PMU.  For  this  reason,  a  standard  template  will  be  used  to  evaluate \neach bid (Table A4.1): \n   \n\nTable A4.1: Proposed Criteria for Evaluation of School Business Plans \n\n \n\nParticulars \n\nNo. \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\nSchool profile is complete and adequately represents the school\u2019s potential for development, and \nprovides an indication of shortcomings that need to be addressed and problems identified \n\nGeneral responsiveness to project and Government objectives (in terms of goals and objectives, \ne.g., expansion of enrollment, programs, etc.) \nAbility to draw in industry and other contributions (in terms of demonstrated approach and concrete \nplans) \nExtent of innovation and general quality of business plan: does this plan have a vision for the \nfuture?

The  changes  will  create  opportunities \nfor vocational senior secondary school (VS) graduates and other members of the community to \nreturn to the VS system to obtain skills upgrading, recertification, and other training services that \nwill help them in their careers. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe expected impact is that Indonesian workers will have better access to opportunities \nfor  skills  upgrading,  allowing  them  to  move  up  career  ladders,  reenter  the  workforce,  or  find \nskilled positions overseas. The expected outcome is that skills upgrading courses are provided \nto  graduates  and  other  adults  on  a  demand-driven  basis  through  career  centers.  The  outputs \nwould  be  a  research  study  on  the  career  center  concept  and  alternative  approaches,  school \ntrials of alternative career center arrangements, incorporation of course statistics into the MONE \nEMIS, and a policy paper and manual on the provision of skills upgrading courses in VSs.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe TA activities will comprise (i) a desk study review of examples of international best \npractice  in  vocational  skills  upgrading;  (ii)  a  review  of  skills  upgrading  activities  in  model  VSs \nand  development  of  a  database;  (iii)  an  intensive  review  of  best  international  practice  in  two \nother countries to gather ideas for implementing skills upgrading courses; (iv) an investigation of \nthe  feasibility  of  international  links  to  develop  joint  cooperation  for  international  certification, \nlinkages, and mutual recognition; (v) implementation of a series of practical trials in 10 VSs; and \n(vi) preparation of a final report, based on the results of the trials, with recommendations for a \nsustainable skills upgrading program in VSs.  \n \n4. \nThe first phase of the TA will consist of the desk review of international best practice in \nskills upgrading and development of a presentation about international practice. In the second \nphase, the international consultant will meet with the task force, help identify 10 VSs and other \nprofessional  upgrading  institutions,  and  together  with  the  task  force  hold  discussions  with \nindustry representatives to gauge needs and priorities. The task force will then hold a national \nworkshop on the findings of the study. School principals and others with practical experience in \nskills  upgrading,  together  with  industry  representatives,  will  be  asked  to  share  their  views  and \nexperience. The third phase of the TA will plan an approach to gather international best practice \nand pursue international linkages, involving a task force visit to two or three countries (20 days \nin total) identified by the international consultant. The objectives of the visits are to experience \ninternational  best  practice;  and  to  investigate  the  feasibility  of  international  linkages  for \ninternational certification, linkages, and mutual recognition.  \n \n5. \nThe final phase will comprise a series of practical trials for 10 VSs selected from among \npublic  and  private  schools  that  already  offer  a  range  of  skills  upgrading  courses  and  are \ninterested  in  improving.  Issues  of  cost  recovery  and  demand  will  be  addressed  during  these \npilots. The trials will be costed and a proposal submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor  approval  before  implementation.  The  task  force  and  TA  coordinator  will  monitor  the  pilots \nand submit quarterly reports to ADB. At the conclusion of the trials, the task force will prepare a \nfinal  report  with  recommendations  for  a  sustainable  skills  upgrading  program  in  VSs.  The \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nCost and Financing \n\nrecommendations  will  cover  the  nature  and  extent  of  possible  courses  and  the  administrative \nand financial structures required within the VS system to support career centers.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program.

Prudent  macroeconomic  policies,  particularly  the  extremely  low  budget \ndeficits,  were  instrumental  in  this  recovery.  The  reduction in  fuel subsidies opened  up space \nfor additional spending, debt dropped below 40% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end \nof 2006,1 aggregate expenditure increased by 20%, and transfers to sub-national governments \ngrew  by  28%.  Spending  on  core  government  administration  including  salaries  (20%)  and \nsubsidies (15%) now accounts for 35% of total government spending. Subsidies still consume \nroughly  15%  of  the  budget  and  remain  at  the  2004  level.  Following  the  reallocation  of  fuel \nsubsidies to pro-poor social programs in 2005, public investment has recovered and returned \nto  the  pre-crisis  7%  of  GDP.  However,  Indonesia\u2019s  public  investment  rate  is  still  one  of  the \nlowest among middle-income countries. With its bold reallocation of resources, Indonesia is now \nat a point where investment can and must rise above pre-crisis levels to compensate for the low \ninvestment  from  1999  to  2002.  In  terms  of  spending,  Indonesia  is  already  one  of  the  most \ndecentralized countries in the world; sub-national governments now manage half of Indonesia\u2019s \npublic investment and spend a record 40% of total public funds.  \n \nSubstantial  progress  has  been  made  over  the  past  2  years  in  reallocating  spending \n2. \n(from \nthe  economic  crisis  and \ninefficient  subsidies) \nto  pro-poor  programs.  Since \ndecentralization, the composition of sectoral expenditures has changed substantially. Spending \non  infrastructure  has  still  not  recovered  to  its  pre-crisis  level  and  has  remained  at  only  3%  of \nGDP  since  2001.  The  reduction  in  oil  subsidies  was  designed  to  sustain  macroeconomic \nstability and enable redirection of a greater share of public expenditure to education and health. \nImpressive gains have been made in allocating additional funds to education. Total spending \non education is now 17.2% of Government expenditure, the highest share of any sector and \ncomparable  to  that  of  many  other  low-  and  middle-income  countries.  Education  spending \nreached  3.9%  of  GDP  in  2006,  increasing  from  2%  in  2001.  Public  infrastructure  spending \nnever recovered from its post crisis low and is only 3.4% of GDP. This structural change has \nimplications for job creation and its effect on employment and income.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEducation Financing Outlook \n\n \n3. \nDue  to  difficulty  obtaining  education  budget  data  from  districts,  the  education  budget \nanalysis  focuses  on  central  Government  budgets.  Trends  have  shown  significant  budgetary \nincreases  to  education,  as  central  education  budgets  grew  from  $4.4  billion  in  2005  to  \n$5.8 billion in 2007, representing an annual growth rate of 15%. Of the $5.8 billion allocation to \nthe  sector,  82.5%  was  allocated  to  the  Ministry  of  National  Education  (MONE)  and  the \nremainder  to  the  Ministry  of  Religious  Affairs  and  other  ministries.  Secondary  education, \nparticularly junior secondary, is a priority for Indonesia. \n \n4. \nIn  the  context  of  rising  education  budgets,  MONE  recognizes  the  need  for  increased \nspending for secondary education; its medium-term development plan proposes increasing the \n\n                                                 \n1   World  Bank.  2007.  Spending  for  Development:  Making  the  Most  of  Indonesia\u2019s  New  Opportunities.  Indonesia \n\nPublic Expenditure Review. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nbudget  to  Rp8.9  trillion  by  2009.  In  the  decentralized  system,  district  governments  are \nresponsible for providing primary and secondary education; salary expenditures are the largest \ndistrict expenditures. They are financed through block grant transfers and accounted for as sub-\nnational expenditures. While spending on junior secondary education by districts is significantly \nlower  than  that  of  primary,  higher  central  spending  on  junior  secondary  education  partially \ncompensates  for  this.  Developing  the  vocational  education  system  is  critical  for  achieving  the \nGovernment\u2019s objectives of making the labor force globally competitive. Of all students, 40% are \nenrolled in vocational senior secondary schools (VSs), constituting a significant proportion of the \nfuture work force. Senior secondary vocational education received a twofold increase in 2007, \nas the Directorate of Technical and Vocational Education (DTVE) budget increased from Rp0.9 \ntrillion  in  2005  to  Rp1.6  trillion  in  2007.  However,  this  still  represents  only  3.7%  of  MONE \nbudget.  \n \n\nTable A12.1: Central Government Education Budget Analysis of Indonesia, \nActual and Projected, 2005\u20132011  \n($ million) \n \n\n \nIndicator \n\nActual \n\n \n\nProjection \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n292,944 \n57,356 \n60,309 \n43,647 \n4,404 \n1.5 \n7.3 \n10.1 \n3,767 \n8.6 \n85.5 \n100 \n1.2 \n2.3 \n2.6 \n\nGDP \nRevenue \nExpenditure \nCentral Government Budget \nCentral Education Budget  \n  % of GDP \n  % of Total Budget \n  % of Central Budget \nMONE Education Budget \n  % of Central Budget \n  % of Central Education \nDTVE Education Budget \n552 \n  % of Education Budget \n0.8 \n  % of Central Education \n4.8 \n5.5 \n  % of MONE Education \nDTVE  =  Directorate  of  Technical  and  Vocational  Education,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  MONE  =  Ministry  of \nNational Education. \nSources:  2005\u20132006:  Anggaran  Pendapatan  dan  Belanja  Negara  2005\u20132006;  2007:  Directorate  of  Technical  and \nVocational Education, Ministry of National Education data; 2008\u20132010: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n275,623 \n84,437 \n105,263 \n64,690 \n9,607 \n3.5 \n9.1 \n14.9 \n8,333 \n12.9 \n86.7 \n395 \n0.6 \n4.1 \n4.7 \n\n262,498 \n80,416 \n97,225 \n61,325 \n8,006 \n3.0 \n8.2 \n13.1 \n6,944 \n11.3 \n86.7 \n292 \n0.5 \n3.7 \n4.2 \n\n249,998 \n76,587 \n89,801 \n58,135 \n6,672 \n2.7 \n7.4 \n11.5 \n5,787 \n10.0 \n86.7 \n225 \n0.4 \n3.4 \n3.9 \n\n238,093 \n72,940 \n82,944 \n55,111 \n5,846 \n2.5 \n7.0 \n10.6 \n4,822 \n8.8 \n82.5 \n180 \n0.3 \n3.1 \n3.7 \n\n226,756 \n69,467 \n76,611 \n52,244 \n5,123 \n2.3 \n6.7 \n9.8 \n4,333 \n8.3 \n84.6 \n150 \n0.3 \n2.9 \n3.5 \n\n289,404 \n88,659 \n113,964 \n68,239 \n11,529 \n4.0 \n10.1 \n16.9 \n9,999 \n14.7 \n86.7\n\n3. \n\nFinancial Sustainability  \n\n \nA financial plan showing the fiscal impact of the Project and identifying funding needed \n5. \nto finance project expenditures during and beyond the project period is in Table A12.2. Project \nexpenditures  will  be  disbursed  annually  and  accumulate  to  about  $115  million  during  the  last \nyear of the Project in relation to incremental costs related to the VS expansion, upgrading, and \nquality improvement. Several commitments will terminate at the end of the Project, and hence \nnot  be  an  ongoing  burden  for  the  Government.  The  continuing  incremental  cost  of  \n$0.25 million annually after the Project ends will add $3 million to the total for 2013\u20132025. This \nis feasible and sustainable given the Government\u2019s commitment to educational expansion and \ndevelopment.  Some  efficiency  and  quality  gains  will  have  long-term  beneficial  impact  and  are \nnot susceptible to short-term resource constraints. The Government\u2019s annual commitment to the \nProject  as  a  percentage  of  the  central  education  budget  ranges  from  0.04%  to  0.14%,  and \ndecreases to 0.01% at the end of the Project; as a percentage of the MONE budget, this ranges \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nfrom 0.04% to 0.15%, and likewise decreases to 0.01% in 2012. The Government\u2019s share in the \nProject is estimated to increase from $2.4 million in year 1 to over $11 million in years 2 and 3, \nand  to  gradually  decrease  to  $1.2  million  at  the  end  of  the  Project.  The  Government\u2019s  annual \ncommitment for the Project is deemed affordable, as this represents about 0.01% of the MONE \nbudget and 0.16% of the DTVE budget.  \n\nTable A12.2: Fiscal Impact 2007\u20132012  \n($ million) \n\n \nIndicator \n\nEducation Budget \nCentral Education Budget \nMONE Budget \nDTVE Budget \nSSE Financing Plan \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Indonesia \n \nTotal \nSSE Fiscal Impact \n\n \n\n \n\n2007 \n \n\n5,846 \n4,822 \n180 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2008 \n \n\n6,672 \n5,366 \n225 \n \n5.55 \n2.38 \n7.94 \n \n\nProject Years \n\n \n7,613 \n5,972 \n297 \n \n27.03 \n11.59 \n38.62 \n \n0.14 \n0.17 \n3.96 \n\n \n8,688 \n6,645 \n395 \n \n26.43 \n11.33 \n37.75 \n \n0.12 \n0.14 \n2.87 \n\n \n\n \n\n9,914  11,313 \n8,229 \n7,395 \n801 \n552 \n \n \n2.92 \n18.56 \n1.25 \n7.96 \n4.17 \n26.52 \n \n \n0.01 \n0.07 \n0.01 \n0.08 \n0.60 \n1.44 \n\nImpact on Central Education Budget \nImpact on Total MONE Education Budget \nImpact on Total DTVE Education Budget \nDTVE  =  Directorate  of  Technical  and  Vocational  Education,  MONE  =  Ministry  of  National  Education,  \nSSE = senior secondary education. \nSources: 2007: Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara; 2008\u20132010: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n0.04 \n0.04 \n1.06 \n\nEconomic and Benefit and Cost Analysis \n\nB. \n \nEconomic Rationale. As the Government pursues its universal 9-year education policy, \n6. \ndemand  for  senior  secondary  education  (SSE)  is  outstripping  supply  and  is  rapidly  becoming \nthe minimum standard for formal sector employment. Government key planning and budgeting \ndocuments  prioritize  the  importance  of  increasing  both  access  and  quality  of  SSE  to  achieve \npoverty  reduction  targets  and  realize  Indonesia\u2019s  growth  potential.  The  Asian  Development \nOutlook  20072  and  the  2006\u20132009  country  strategy  and  program3  emphasize  the  need  to \nincrease the quality of SSE including vocational education (VE) as a necessary complement to \ninvestment climate reforms to achieve higher productivity, lower unemployment, and sustainable \ngrowth. \n \n7. \nThe  VE  system  is  a  major  component  of  SSE  accommodating  one  third  of  total  SSE \nenrollment,  while  VS  graduates  comprise  a  quarter  of  the  skilled  labor  force.4  Labor  statistics \nindicate that VS graduates, particularly women, outperform GS graduates in the labor market. In \nthe  public  eye,  vocational  education  is  now  seen  as  a  more  certain  route  to  employment  than \nGS for non-college bound students at a time of slack employment.  \n\n \nPublic sector investment is required to upgrade quality. While the private sector plays a \n8. \ncrucial  role  in  system  expansion,  it  is  often  at  lower  quality  and  higher  cost.  Private  VSs \ngenerally  belong  to  grassroots  organizations,  are  smaller  than  public  schools,  have  fewer \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n4   The skilled labor force includes senior high school level, diploma, and university graduates. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nqualified  and  full-time  teachers,  and  are  unable  to  raise  the  capital  investment  required  from \ntheir  members  or  parents  of  students.  The  Project  will  develop  a  network  of  public  model \nschools  and  mainly  private  alliance  schools,  where  the  stronger  model  school  acts  as  a \nbenchmark  for  the  surrounding  private  alliance  schools.  The  model  school  is  a  means  for \nchanneling public investment for training and other improvements to  alliance schools, creating \npositive  interactions  to  increase  system  quality  faster  than  investing  on  a  school-by-school \nbasis. \n\n \nComparing  Benefits  and  Costs.  The  benefit\u2013cost  analysis  calculates  the  increase  in \n9. \nproductivity required to achieve a 12% return on investment over 20 years. The economic costs \nare taken as the financial costs net of price increases and taxes. The quantifiable benefit of the \ninvestment is the marginal productivity increase expressed in terms of wages accruing to working \ngraduates  from  the  higher  quality  education  obtained  from  the  upgraded  model  and  alliance \nschools,  and  the  marginal  productivity  of  graduates  produced  with  the  expansion  of  vocational \nschools.  A more detailed economic benefit cost analysis is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nThe number of male and female working graduates is based the number of model school \n10. \ngraduates  each  year  plus  10%  of  the  male  and  female  students  graduating  from  the  alliance \nschools. Without the synergies accruing to the full investment in the model schools, the alliance \nschools  are  assumed  to  achieve  fewer  benefits.  The  number  of  working  graduates  is  the \nestimated  number  of  project  graduates,  and  their  expected  labor  force  participation  rate  and \nunemployment  rate  is  taken  from  the  2006  National  Labor  Force  Survey.  Due  to  the  limited \ncapacity  of  the  SSE  system  and  rising  junior  secondary  enrollment  and  transition  rates,  the \nadditional  capacity  generated  through  efficiency  gains  would  enable  more  junior  secondary \nschool graduates to attend SSE. Therefore, the marginal increase in average earnings accruing \nto  an  SSE  graduate  over  a  junior  secondary  graduate  is  counted  toward  the  project  benefits. \nWages  and  earnings  are  not  increased  over  time;  any  further  contribution  from  improved \neducation  prior  to  work  cannot  be  separated  from  increases  due  to  post-school  experience  or \ntraining. The social contributions of graduates outside the labor force were not quantified.  \n \n\nTable A12.3: Marginal Increase in Monthly Wages and Earnings Required to Achieve a \n12% Economic Rate of Return under Various Scenarios \n\n \n\nItem \nRequired increase \nPercent of median wage \n\nMain Scenario \n52,800.0 \n6.9 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n10% Capital Cost Increase \n62,400.0 \n8.2 \n\n10% Benefit Decrease \n63,500.0 \n8.4 \n\n \n11. \nUnder the general scenario described, the monthly wage increase required to achieve a \n12% economic rate of return is Rp52,800 or $5.87 per working graduate. This is equivalent to \n6.9%  of  the  current  median  wage  or  30  minutes  of  additional  effort  per  workday.5  Two \nalternative  scenarios  were  considered:  (i)  a  10%  increase  in  capital  and  recurrent  costs,  and \n(ii) a 10% decrease in benefits. The required increase in productivity is feasible. The investment \nwill enable model schools to produce consistently higher quality graduates with greater capacity \nto learn new skills. While labor force surveys do not track returns to quality, anecdotal evidence \nfrom schools, employers, and parents indicates that graduates from quality schools can expect \nwage premiums ranging from half to double the median wage. While the 12% rate of return is \nachievable,  a  50%  wage  premium  is  equivalent  to  a  30%  economic  rate  of  return.  Thus  the \n\n                                                 \n5  Assuming  an  8-hour  or  480  minutes  per  day  working  day,  a  6.9%  increase  in  a  working  day  is  equivalent  to \n\n33 minutes while an 8.4% increase is equivalent to an additional 40 minutes. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n63 \n\neconomic  rate  of  return  needed  will  be  met  though  a  higher  proportion  of  students  accessing \nhigher quality employment with higher wages or earnings.  \n \n12. \nThe  bulk  of  the  quantifiable  benefits  accrue  to  working  graduates  from  the  model \nschools.  Project  outputs  include  367,000  male  and  female  working  graduates  generating \n3.7 million  work-years  between  year  4  and  year  20  of  the  Project.  The  net  increase  in \nproductivity of these graduates at a conservative 12% economic rate of return is equivalent to \n30  minutes  of  additional  productivity  per  worker  per  day  worked.  The  Project\u2019s  marginal \nproductivity gain with a 12% economic rate of return is equivalent to an additional 230,000 work-\nyears.  Further  benefits  accrue  from  enhanced  partnerships  with  industry  by  reducing  search \ntime for the first job and reducing employment mismatch. A 1-month reduction in job search time \nfrom enhanced career development centers increases project benefits by another 31,000 work-\nyears.  The  entrepreneur  development  and  business  incubators  will  enable  recent  graduates \ndestined  to  become  own  account  workers  or  owners  of  microenterprise  to  establish  more \nproductive businesses and reduce the rate of start-up failure, generating additional benefits.  \n\n \nDistribution  of  Benefits.  Affordability  and  expected  returns  influence choice  of school \n13. \nand  distribution  of  benefits.  SSE  of  all  types  is  more  expensive  than  junior  secondary  and \nelementary  school.  Nonetheless,  greater  access  resulting  from  expansion  of  the  education \nsystem  has  led  to  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  children  from  poor  households  attending \nsenior secondary schools. By 2006, the average gross enrollment rate had risen over 50% with \n36%  of  children  in  the  bottom  quintile  enrolled.  While  SSE  continues  to  benefit  the  non-poor \nmore than the poor, the degree of disparity has greatly diminished. Location plays a large role in \ndetermining  participation  in  SSE  including  vocational  schools.  Urban  students  have  better \naccess to general schools than vocational schools; this is even more marked for rural students. \nGender  enrollment  by  vocational  school  programs  tends  to  reflect  labor  market  gender \nsegmentation.  Male  students  are  concentrated  in  industry-oriented  programs,  while  female \nstudents are in services-oriented programs. As vocational schools are skewed toward technical \nprograms, the participation of males is higher than for females. \n \n\nTable A12.4: Distribution of VS Students by Income Quintile, Gender, and Location (%) \n\n \n\n     Q5 \n\n      Q4 \n\n      Q2 \n\n      Q1 \n\n      Q3 \n\n       Total \n\nItem \n \n62.8 \nVS Urban \n37.2 \nVS Rural \n \n \n61.1 \nVS Male \n38.9 \nVS Female \n \n \n100.0 \nVS Total \n \n \n100.0 \nGS Total \nGS  =  general  senior  secondary  school,  Q  =  quintile,  VS  =  vocational  senior \nsecondary school. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n14.4 \n5.0 \n \n12.1 \n7.3 \n \n19.4 \n \n17.3 \n\n11.3 \n3.7 \n \n8.8 \n6.2 \n \n15 \n \n12.7 \n\n9.1 \n11.6 \n \n12.8 \n7.9 \n \n20.7 \n \n26.6 \n\n14.8 \n7.4 \n \n13.6 \n8.6 \n \n22.2 \n \n19.9 \n\n13.2 \n9.5 \n \n13.8 \n8.9 \n \n22.7 \n \n23.5 \n\n \n \nIn  comparison  with  general  schooling,  the  benefits  of  vocational  schooling  accrue \n14. \ndisproportionately  to  poor  and  low-income  households.  This  is  particularly  notable  as \nhouseholds incur higher out-of-pocket expenses for vocational education due partly to the cost \nof workshops and consumables. As a result of lower access in rural areas, vocational schooling \nbenefits accrue more to urban males and females. The tendency of VSs to offer more programs \nfor males means that VSs benefit proportionally fewer females than general schools. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nIs the sector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty partnership agreement? \n\nA. \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nThe  vocational  senior  secondary  education  system  is  a  key  component  of  the  Indonesian  Government\u2019s  policy  to \nprovide  young  people  with  the  skills  needed  to  stay  out  of  poverty,  reduce  the  unemployment  rate,  and  create  a \nglobally  competitive  labor  force.  The  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  2004\u20132009,  the  Asian  Development \nOutlook  2007  and  the  country  strategy  and  program  2006\u20132009  emphasize  the  need  to  improve  technical  skills  in \nsenior secondary and tertiary education to facilitate the transformation of technology into long-term growth. Technical \nand vocational education (TVE) provides young males and females  with marketable skills and initial  work experience \nthrough apprenticeships. The Vocational Education Strengthening Project builds on this comparative advantage to help \nincrease Indonesia\u2019s competitiveness in the global economy.  \n \nB. \nThe senior secondary education (SSE) system consists of vocational senior secondary schools (VSs), general senior \nsecondary schools (GSs) and madrasah aliyah. Each offers an academic curriculum over 3 years. About 50% of 16\u201318 \nyear olds are enrolled in SSE, with 40% of the students enrolled in VSs (or 17% of the age group). Approximately 42% \nof VS students are female. VSs are particularly favored by students from urban households.  \n \nSSE  is  more  expensive  than  junior  secondary  and  elementary  school,  and  is  increasingly  becoming  the  minimum \nrequirement for any formal sector job. The proportion of children from the highest to lowest quintile attending SSE has \nremained  constant  from  1993  to  2006  (less  than  2  to  1).  However,  students  in  VSs  come  from  families  with  lower \nincomes than those enrolled in GSs. Some data show that households incur higher out-of-pocket expenses for VSs, as \nGS  students  have  fewer  workshop  classes  and  no  practicum.  However,  the  returns  on  vocational  education  can  be \nassumed to be higher than for general education, as demonstrated by the disproportionately higher share of students \nfrom the lower quintiles, especially from urban areas.  \n \nVS  graduates  from  poor  and  low-income  households  often  participate  in  cottage  industries,  are  drivers,  or  are  self-\nemployed. The Project is expected to expand male and female VS enrollment by strengthening model\u2013alliance school \nnetworks. It will channel investment to VSs and help promote social equity. \n \nC. \nParticipation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted to determine key project stakeholders: oversight and line government ministries, \ndistrict  government  education  offices,  gender  working  unit  within  DTVE,  public  and  private  VSs,  school  committee \nrepresentatives,  parents,  and  male  and  female  students.

A  gender  analysis  and  strategy  (Supplementary  Appendix  I) \nhighlights the specific needs and interests of female and male VS students and teachers. It is in \naccordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998), \nMinistry  of  National  Education  gender  mainstreaming  efforts,  and  Indonesia:  Country  Gender \nAssessment.1 \n \n\nProject Output \n\nActions Proposed \n\nProvide male and female school managers with equal access to training opportunities. \nInvolve women from school management/committees in SBP preparations (Target: at least \n40% of members on school committees are females).  \n\nGeneral  \nThe 90 model VSs to be included in the Project will have an overall female enrollment share of at least 37%. \nThe alliance schools to be included in the Project will have an overall female enrollment share of at least 37%. \nEach  school  business  plan  (SBP)  will  be  gender  inclusive.  SBPs  will  include  a  gender  action  plan  and  sex-\ndisaggregated  performance  indicators  based  on  the  overall  gender  strategy  for  the  Project.  Each  gender  plan  will \ninclude  specific  actions  to  promote  (i)  increased  female  enrollment;  (ii)  construction  of  separate  sanitation  facilities  for \nmales and females; (iii) equal access for female and male students to work placements, apprenticeships, and production \nunits or school-run businesses; and (iv) equal access to female and male teachers for upgrading teaching skills.  \nOutput 1: Refocused School Management Using a Business Approach \n1.1.
