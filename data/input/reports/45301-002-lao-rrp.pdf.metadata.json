It will be financed by a sector loan as it meets the criteria in the \nsector  lending  policy  of  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).2 It  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2019s \nurban sector targets\u201490% coverage for piped water supply and 100% coverage for sanitation by \n2030\u2014by  improving  sector  coordination  and  policy  implementation  in  corporatization,  improving \nnonrevenue  water  (NRW)  management  and  expanding  water  supply  in  provincial  towns, \ndeveloping new water supply systems in small towns, enhancing community action in urban water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  and  strengthening  capacity  for  project  implementation  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). The project will expand water and sanitation services to small district towns, \nprovincial  capital  towns  and  their  peri-urban  areas  in  accordance  with  the  government\u2019s  urban \nwater supply and sanitation strategy, 2013\u20132030 and water supply investment plan, 2012\u20132020.3   \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nThe project provides financing to corporatized PNPs for the development and expansion \nof  water  supply  systems  and  village  improvements  to  help  reinforce  links  between  sanitation \nand  health.  It  complements  existing  projects  by  further  strengthening  the  performance  of \ncorporatized  PNPs  through  innovative  approaches  to  NRW  management,  water  safety  plan \nimplementation,  and  O&M  training  through  a  water  operator  partnership.  It  demonstrates  the \nbenefits of improved utility performance and efficiency on expanding water supply and sanitation \nservices  to  small  district  towns  and  peri-urban  areas  of  provincial  capital  towns.  It  showcases \nADB  as  a  finance++  bank  through  (i)  its  partnership  with  Phu  Bia  Mining  Limited,  which  will \nprovide  project  specific  cofinancing  through  its  sustainability  initiative,  commonly  known  as \ncorporate  social  responsibility,  and  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the  government  in  strengthening  its \nmechanism for coordinating development partners in the sector through output 1. \n\n4. \nThe Lao PDR population was estimated in 2011 at 6.4 million, of whom a third reside in five \nlarge urban centers and 150 small towns in 144 districts. Gross domestic product was estimated at \n$1,270  per  capita  in  2011  and  $1,422  in  2012. The poverty rate  declined to  28%  in  2008  and  is \nprojected to fall by one percentage point per annum.4 The development of urban centers and small \ntowns is important to improve living conditions and public health, strengthen urban\u2013rural linkages, \ngenerate  employment,  and  narrow  regional  income  disparities.  Increased  access  to  safe  and \nreliable water and sanitation plays a vital role in the economic development of these towns. About \n58% of urban residents had access to piped water supply and 87% to improved sanitation in 2011. \n                                                \n1    The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Phu Bia Mining Limited operates gold, copper, and silver \nmines  in  the  Lao  PDR,  90%  owned  by  the  ASX-200  listed  company  PanAust  Limited,  and  10%  owned  by  the \nGovernment of the Lao PDR.

Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  Statistical  Yearbook  2011.  Vientiane.  Town \nclassification, now under review, has Vientiane as the capital, four secondary towns (with more than 20,000 people), \nprovincial or small district towns (with 4,000\u201320,000 people), and small towns (with fewer than 4,000 people). \n\n\f2           \n\nUrban water supply and sanitation  sector in the Lao PDR used to lack sustainability and \n5. \neffective  sector  regulation.  Transforming  PNPs  into  profit-making  corporatized  business  entities \nwas a challenge because of their limited institutional capacity. PNPs operated at a loss because \nof  low  tariffs,  few  water  connections,  and  poor  managerial  and  operational  performance.  This \nresulted in poor PNP technical and financial performance, poor service to consumers, and PNPs\u2019 \nreliance on the government for budget support.5 Since 2008, PNPs have corporatized under the \nEnterprise Law, 2005 and adopted a more business-like approach in line with the government\u2019s \nreforms for state-owned enterprises. The legal framework has improved with the approval of the \nWater Supply Law in 2009, the issuance of an urban water supply and sanitation strategy in 2013, \nand improved national and provincial sector regulation.  \n\n6. \nADB  has  supported  the  government  improve  its  sector  performance  through  three  loans \nfor small towns that have (i) developed and rehabilitated 31 small town water supply systems; (ii) \napplied appropriate technology to the design of water supply systems; (iii) improved construction \nstandards  through  technical  support  to  construction  contractors  and  onsite  supervision;  (iv) \nimproved  the  operational  and  financial  performance  of  PNPs  through  regular  tariff  adjustments \nand reduced arrears (7 of 16 PNPs have achieved full cost recovery, and 10 reduced arrears to \nless than 90 days in 2013); (v) made water supply affordable to poor and low-income households \nthrough  a  lifeline  tariff;  and  (vi)  increased  water  supply  and  sanitation  coverage  by  requiring \nhouseholds  to  improve  household  latrines  prior  to  receiving  free  household  water  connections.6 \nBy 2015, 12 more systems will be constructed and rehabilitated, and 10 PNPs will have corporate \nplans,  system-specific  service  agreements,  billing  and  accounting  systems,  and  asset \ndepreciation accounts. ADB technical assistance is supporting the government\u2019s strengthening of \nits regulations and facilitation of private sector participation in the water supply and sanitation.7  \n\n7. \nDespite these impressive sector developments, NRW reduction needs to be prioritized, as \nhigh water losses in distribution networks adversely affect the efficiency and financial sustainability \nof water utilities and result in higher tariffs. In 2011, NRW for all 16 PNPs was estimated at 11.6 \nmillion cubic meters per year (m3/year) or 28% of water production. These figures understate the \nactual  problem,  as  about  half  of  the  PNP  systems  provide  intermittent  supply.  NRW  would  be \nmuch higher if the systems are pressurized.8 If current NRW could be reduced to around 20%, an \nadditional 3.3 million m3/year of piped water would be available to about 76,000 PNP customers, \nassuming  consumption  of  120  liters per  capita  per  day.  The  project  emphasizes  efficient  water \nuse and helps participating PNPs reduce NRW in provincial water supply systems while providing \ncapital investments for the provincial system and one small town system in the same province. \n\nWater  supply  and  sanitation  in  peri-urban  areas  is  a  neglected  area  of  service,  as \n8. \nexpansion to these areas is often costly and technically challenging. In the Lao PDR, these areas \nare rapidly growing and becoming more densely populated, and they are home to about 60% of the \n\n                                                \n5    ADB.  2009.

The project provides investment to expand \nprovincial capital town water supply systems to peri-urban areas at a lower incremental cost than \ninstalling a new system. It will optimize investment efficiency and expand the PNP customer base. \nIt offers economies of scale, builds on established water supply systems, and enables tariff cross \nsubsidy between the provincial and small town water supply systems. \n\n9. \nThe project entails community-driven initiatives that complement the water and sanitation \ninfrastructure components to ensure that benefits reach the poor and vulnerable in each village. In \npast  projects,  community  identification,  prioritization for  urban  environmental  improvements,  and \ncommunity  awareness  were  instrumental  to  addressing  sanitation.  These  initiatives  mobilized \nadditional government funds to extend improvements or develop complementary infrastructure.  \n\n10. \nPNP  business  operations  can  be  strengthened  in  two  additional  areas:  customer \nrelations and water safety plans. One-third of PNPs have a complaints register, and a few report \ncomplaints regularly to their board. The project encourages PNPs to improve their services and \npartnership with communities regarding water conservation and water loss reduction through a \nPNP  customer  relations  manager. 9 The  focus  on  NRW  management  will  ensure  that \nbeneficiaries do not pay for PNP water losses. The free connection policy will minimize apparent \nlosses (commercial) by reducing the incentive for illegal or unauthorized connections. \n\n11.  Monitoring  the  quality  of  piped  water,  in  accordance  with  the  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s  draft \ndrinking water quality standards, requires PNPs to prepare and implement water safety plans for \nall  systems.  Compliance  requires  sufficient  in-house  capacity  and  resources  to  test  all \nparameters.  The  project  supports  PNP  implementation  of  water  safety  plans  as  part  of  their \nregular corporate planning updates, improving drinking water quality monitoring through a staged \napproach  and  raising  awareness  about  compliance  with  standards.  The  application  of  water \nsafety  plans  will  facilitate  discussions  on  water  security  issues  and  on  the  multiple  demands \nplaced on raw water sources. Limited protection and competing demands for raw water sources \ncauses  poor  water  quality,  water  shortage,  and  system  failure.  Rapid  urbanization,  agriculture, \nindustry,  irrigation,  and  hydropower  development  pose  risks  of  possible  contamination  by \nwastewater,  pesticides,  and  fertilizer,  and  of  insufficient  water  flow  downstream.  The  project \nincorporates these factors into the preparation of each subproject.  \n\nThe  project  aligns  with  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  Seventh  National  Socio-Economic  Development \n12. \nPlan,  2011\u20132015,  which  envisions  graduation  from  least-developed  country  status  by  2020.  It \ncontributes to the achievement of the Lao Millennium Development Goal targets for urban water \nsupply and sanitation by 2015. ADB\u2019s Lao PDR country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 and its \nLao PDR urban development assessment strategy and road map both emphasize stronger rural\u2013\nurban  linkages  through  improved  urban  services  and  municipal  infrastructure.  The  project \nincorporates  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  independent  evaluations  and  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Water \nOperational Plan, 2011\u20132020 under Strategy 2020, which promotes working with corporate water \ninefficiencies,  and  stabilize  water \nutilities \nconsumption  through robust  demand management.10 The  project  supports  the  Ministry  of  Public \n                                                \n9   An  information  technology  pilot  activity  to  improve  PNP\u2013client  relations  in  the Lao  PDR  could  be scaled  up  (ADB. \n\nfinancial  management,  reduce \n\nto  strengthen \n\n2011.

ADB  is  a  lead  partner  in  urban  water  supply  and \nsanitation  in  the  Lao  PDR.  Other  partners  are  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  Bremen \nOverseas  Research  and  Development  Association,  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of  China,  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  Korean  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Netherlands \nDevelopment Organization, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, Syndicat des Eaux \nd\u2019Ile de France through Groupe de Recherches et d'Echanges Technologiques,  the Neighboring \nCountries  Economic  Development  Agency  (Thailand),  United  Nations  Human  Settlements \nProgramme,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund,  Water  and  Sanitation  Program  (World  Bank),  and \nWorld Health Organization.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  impact  will  be  expanded  access  to  quality  and  reliable  piped  water  supply  and \nsanitation  services  for  the  urban  population  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  outcome  will  be  improved \nperformance of participating PNPs in delivering sustainable water supply and sanitation services. \nThe  proposed  project  is  a  sector  lending  project  following  a  prioritized  list  of  subproject  towns \nbased on the water supply investment plan. It provides capital to selected PNPs that are state \n(or  corporate)  companies,  have  prepared  a  corporate  plan,  and  have  arrears  at  less  than  90 \ndays. Each PNP will receive funds to expand and rehabilitate its provincial capital water supply \nsystem  and  to  construct  a  new  water  supply  system  in  a  small  town.  Each  town  selected  will \nhave 4,000\u201320,000 residents. The project supports about six PNPs improve and develop water \nsupply  systems  in  about  two  towns  per  province.  It  is  expected  to  improve  access  to  water \nsupply for 155,000 people and improved sanitation for 160,000 people in these urban areas. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \n\nThe project will have the following five outputs. \n\nOutput  1:  Improved  sector  coordination  and  policy  implementation.  This  will \n15. \ncontinue  reforms  introduced  under  previous  projects  and  implement  new  policy  reforms  to \nimprove the performance of about six PNPs. This includes (i) strengthened sector coordination, \nincluding support to  help  coordinate the  subsector  working group  on  water  supply  and sanitation \nunder  the  Technical  Working  Group  subgroup  on  urban  development,  subsector  biannual \nmeetings, annual subsector performance review with development partners, and smaller subsector \ncoordination  meetings;  (ii)  continued \nincluding  service \nagreements between PNPs and provincial governments, PNP training on corporate planning and \nfinancial  management,  tariff  adjustments,  free  connection  policy,  issuance  of  district  sanitation \nregulations,  and  the  use  of  simplified  corporate  plans;  and  (iii)  expanded  policy  implementation, \nincluding  nationalizing  a  free  connection  policy  and  sanitation  regulations;  wider  coordination  of \nNRW  management,  asset  management,  and  water  safety  plans;  and  the  establishment  of  a \ncorporate planning helpdesk in the project coordination unit.  \n\nimplementation  of  policy  reforms, \n\n16. \nOutput 2: Improved nonrevenue water management and water supply development. \nThis  will  integrate  a  comprehensive  NRW  reduction  program  with  water  supply  development  in \nabout  five  provincial  capitals.  The  NRW  program  applies  an  integrated  business  approach  that \nincludes both investment for physical works and support for surveys, water audits and balances, \nrecord  drawings,  and  registers.  It  addresses  both  real  losses  (leakage)  and  apparent  losses \n(metering losses and water theft). Participating PNPs will be required to establish permanent leak \ndetection  and  repair  teams  and  implement  disconnection  and  meter  management  policies. \nExperts  will  help  these  teams  implement  the  NRW  program.  PNPs  that  participate  in  the  NRW \nreduction program and the policy implementation activities under output 1 will be eligible to seek \n\n \n\n\ffinancing for water supply rehabilitation and expansion of existing provincial systems to peri-urban \nareas.

Safe,  affordable, \nreliable PNP piped water supply systems  will be built in the core urban areas of about six small \ndistrict towns. PNPs that have agreed to participate in outputs 1 and 2 will be eligible for financing \nto  build  a  new  water  supply  system  in  a  small  district  in  the  same  province,  acquire  O&M \nequipment for it, and offer free connections and meters to households during construction.  \n\n18. \nOutput  4:  Enhanced  community  action  in  water  supply  and  sanitation.  This  will \nsustain the benefits from investments in small town water supply systems through complementary \nsanitation  and  awareness  activities.  The  output  includes  (i)  village  environmental  improvement \n(VEI) grants for core villages in a small town according to agreed eligibility criteria;12 (ii) improved \nhousehold  sanitation  for  the  poor;13 (iii)  constructed  or  repaired  public  sanitation  facilities  where \nO&M  can  be  contracted  to  a  business  or  social  entity,  and  constructed  septage  disposal \nfacilities  where  they  are  unavailable  in  the  subproject  area;  and  (iv)  increased  project  and \nhygiene awareness through stakeholder consultations and community participation, and water, \nsanitation,  and  hygiene  behaviour  change  in  areas  such  as  water  source  protection.  Activities \nwill be coordinated by district authorities and implemented by village development committees. \n\nOutput  5:  Strengthened  capacity  for  project  implementation,  operation,  and \n19. \nmaintenance.  This  will  include  support  for  project  implementation  assistance  and  capacity \ndevelopment, including safeguards and O&M. Each participating PNP will benefit from on-the-job \ntraining  through  a  proposed  water  operators  partnership  with  a  regional  water  utility  such  as \nThailand\u2019s  Provincial  Waterworks  Authority. 14  The  output  supports  village  development \ncommittees  in  O&M  of  VEI  infrastructure  and  includes  incremental  administration  support  for \nproject vehicles, project office equipment, and PNP operational and leak-detection equipment.  \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n20. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $46.55 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB.  \nC.  \n \n\nOutput 1:Improved sector coordination and policy implementation \nOutput 2: Improved nonrevenue water management and water supply development \nOutput 3: Developed new water supply systems in small towns \nOutput 4: Enhanced community action in urban water supply and sanitation \nOutput 5: Strengthened capacity for project implementation and O&M \nSubtotal (A) \n\nBase Costb \n1.  \n2.  \n3.  \n4.  \n5.  \n \nContingenciesc \nFinancing Charges during Implementationd \n \n\nTotal (A+B+C) \n\n \n\nAmounta \n\n  \n0.53 \n12.73 \n8.48 \n2.73 \n11.52 \n35.98 \n9.41 \n1.16 \n46.55 \n\nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely due to rounding.  \n                                                \n11   The program will offer business opportunities for Nam Papa Nakhoneluang (the Vientiane water utility) and private \n\ncompanies to develop expertise in NRW reduction and continue annual NRW audits and other services. \n\n12   The project will contribute up to 80% of the cost of improvements (about $25 per capita), local governments at least \n10%, and the village at least 10% in cash. Percentages exclude taxes and duties, which the government will finance. \n13    A grant of $120 will cover materials to construct a durable water seal pit latrine.

It assessed the suitability of \ntechnology used in water supply development, measures for energy efficiency and management, \ncontrols  for  NRW  management,  and  technical  viability  and  compatibility  with  local  conditions  for \nproposed  VEI.  The  project  adopts  appropriately  durable  and  sustainable  technologies  for  water \nand sanitation improvements. It considers measures to ensure energy efficiency using least-cost \nanalyses.  The  current  designs  of  water  treatment  plants  suit  specific  site  conditions;  they  are \nrobust and capable of handling a range of flows and raw water quality. They use gravity dosing of \nchemicals, hydraulic mixing of alum, horizontal sedimentation tanks, rapid gravity sand filters, and \nchlorination. The project includes initiatives to sustain low NRW, the free connections policy being \ndisincentives  for  unauthorized  connections  and  water  theft.  Engineering  solutions  for  VEI \ninfrastructure and equipment are selected for technical viability, compatibility with local conditions, \nand local O&M capacity. Household sanitation options will be selected for function, cost, long-term \ndurability, and suitability for local social norms.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic and financial analyses of subproject water supply components accord with ADB \n26. \nguidelines. The project contributes significantly to improved economic well-being in small towns in \nterms of resource cost savings and consumer satisfaction. The estimated economic internal rates \nof return of the three sample subprojects range from 15.39% to 20.00%, higher than the assumed \neconomic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12.00%.  The  estimated  financial  internal  rates  of  return \nrange from 6.20% to 8.55%, higher than the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 5.14%. \nThe subprojects are most sensitive to implementation delays and decreased benefits or revenues, \nbut  their  estimated  economic  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return  remain  above  the  economic \nopportunity cost of capital and the weighted average cost of capital under various scenarios. \n\n27. \nEach PNP participating in the project will implement utility-wide tariffs that are sufficient to \nfully  recover  utility-wide  O&M  costs;  recover  utility-wide  debt  service;  maintain  a  utility-wide  debt \nservice ratio of at least 1.2 times once the project is operational; gradually recover an increasing \nproportion  of  annual  depreciation  expense  of  utility-wide  fixed  assets;  and  maintain  customer \naccounts receivable at less than 90 days of annual sales. The proposed utility-wide tariffs can meet \nthe  sector\u2019s  financial  objectives  of  cost  recovery  and  debt  service,  indicating  subproject  financial \nsustainability. Affordability analyses of the three sample subprojects show the proposed tariffs to be \naffordable to domestic consumers. PNPs will be required to review and adjust their tariffs annually.  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n28. \nAssessments  of  MPWT\u2019s  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  and  of  the \nproject  coordination  unit  confirmed  that  project  implementation  arrangements,  which  follow \nprevious ADB  water supply sector projects in the Lao PDR, are appropriate. The executing and \nimplementing  agencies  have  experience  in  managing  externally  funded  projects  and  sufficient \ncapacity to undertake international and national competitive bidding for civil works packages. The \nproject\u2019s focus on corporate planning and requirement for external audit of PNP financial accounts \nwill improve governance. Output 5 will strengthen the capacity of project staff and provide on-the-\njob  training.  The  project  coordination  unit  will  build  local  capacity  through  its  review  of \nprocurement  and  disbursement  documents.  It  will  hire  a  national  accounting  firm  to  assist  with \nproject accounts and build capacity. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \n\n \n\n\fexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MPWT.  Specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 16).  \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n29. \nThe  project  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  health,  economic  prospects,  and  living \nconditions of town residents. It is gender category 2, effective gender mainstreaming. By 2021, the \nproject will benefit about 160,000 residents in 113 core villages in 11 small towns, including 5,000 \npoor  urban  households,  or  15%  of  all  households.  It  eliminates  barriers  to  access  for  the  urban \npoor  and  prioritizes  poor  districts  (output  3).  Health  benefits  will  be  derived  through  access  to \nimproved  drinking  water; greater  water  availability for  sanitation  and  personal  hygiene;  increased \naccess to improved sanitation and reduced open defecation; and improved septage management. \nGender  benefits  for  women  will  result  from  greater  convenience,  reduced  physical  burden,  and \ntime  savings  in  water  collection;  improved  family  health;  increased  privacy  and  dignity  when \ntending  to  sanitation  needs;  and  greater  hygiene  information  specific  to  women\u2019s  health  and \nmenstrual hygiene. The gender action plan furthers ADB\u2019s experiences in gender mainstreaming \nin the urban water and sanitation sector in the Lao PDR.18 \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nThe  project  is  involuntary  resettlement  category  B,  as  it  will  not  entail  significant  land \nacquisition or resettlement. A resettlement framework and resettlement plans for the three sample \nsubprojects  have  been  prepared.  The  resettlement  framework  will  guide  the  preparation  of  the \nremaining resettlement plans once subprojects are identified. \n\nThe  project  is  indigenous  peoples  categories  B,  as  the  three  sample  subprojects  are  in \n31. \nurban areas, where ethnic groups are likely to be well integrated into society and so indigenous \npeoples plans are not required. An indigenous peoples planning framework has been prepared to \nguide  the  assessment  and  preparation  of  an  indigenous  peoples  plans,  if  necessary,  once  the \nremaining subprojects are identified during implementation. \n\n32. \nThe  project  is  environment  category  B.  The  project  includes  a  sound  approach  to \nmanaging  water  security  issues.  Subprojects  are  not  expected  to  cause  any  irreversible \nenvironmental  impacts.  An  environmental  assessment  review  framework,  initial  environmental \nexaminations for the project and three sample subprojects, and environment management plans \nhave been prepared. Potential impacts of climate change and natural hazards to the project have \nbeen integrated into initial environmental examinations with recommendations for detailed design. \nPotential adverse impacts during construction are expected to be temporary and can be mitigated \nby executing the environment management plans required in the bidding and contract documents.  \n\n33. \nSafeguard  documents  have  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  local  communities  and \naffected people accord with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), sector requirements, and \ngovernment  regulations  and  disclosed  on  ADB  website.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will \nfacilitate the resolution of complaints during project implementation. The project includes budget \nand  institutional  support  for  safeguard  document  preparation,  updates,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring. It includes provision for an external resettlement monitor. A project information booklet \nfor  resettlement  will  be  distributed  to  affected  people  during  the  detailed  measurement  survey. \nSafeguard documents have been approved by the government. Subproject plans will be updated \nafter detailed design, cleared by the government and ADB prior to contract award, and disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website according to ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements.  \n\n                                                \n18   See footnote 5, which includes a $500,000 grant from the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10           \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.
