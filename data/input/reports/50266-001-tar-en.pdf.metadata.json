The Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) region, comprising 10 Southeast Asian countries, is home to over 622 \nmillion people. It has the third largest labor force in the world, behind only the People\u2019s Republic \nof China and India. With an average annual economic growth of 5.3% during 2007\u20132015, ASEAN \nhas  consistently  outperformed  global  economic  growth.  ASEAN\u2019s  combined  gross  domestic \nproducts in 2015 stood at $2.4 trillion (sixth largest economy in the world).3 The robust economic \nperformance  enabled  the  region  to  reduce  the  proportion  of  populations  below  the  respective \nnational poverty lines from 31% in 1990 to 14% in 2015.4 \n \n3. \nIncreasing  rural-urban  income  disparity.  Despite  the  remarkable  poverty  reduction, \nthere  are  still  36  million  people  in  the  region  living  below  the  international  poverty  line.5 The \neconomic  growth  driven  by  industrial  and  service  sectors  centered  in  urban  areas  has  left  the \nlarge population in rural areas outside the stream of viable economic opportunities. The widening \nrural-urban income disparity within countries has been recognized as a common symptom.6 To \nmake economic growth equitable, inclusive, and sustainable, investing in urban development is \nnot  sufficient.  Vitalizing  rural  economies  is  imperative  as  the  region  is  endowed  with  rich \nagricultural and natural resources, and with large populations engaged in agriculture. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The TA facility will initially provide project preparation support for three ensuing projects for Myanmar and Viet Nam, \nand  project  implementation  support  to  ongoing  projects  such  as  the  L3724-MYA  and  Grant  0617-MYA  Climate-\nFriendly Agribusiness Value Chains Sector project. These projects are listed in Appendix 2. The ensuing projects \nand  relevant  TAs  are  in  the  Country  Operations  Business  Plans  of  the  respective  DMCs.  With  additional  funds \nincluding Technical Assistance Special Fund for 2019, more projects for additional DMCs in Southeast Asia will be \nadded under the TA facility. \n\n2   These strategies include Myanmar\u2019s Five-Year Development Plan 2016/2017-2020/2021 and Viet Nam\u2019s Five-Year \n\nSocio-Economic Development Plan (2016\u20132020). \n\n3   ASEAN. 2016.

The Diplomat. 15 September. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n2. \n\nSector Challenges \n\n4. \nLow  rural  labor  productivity.  The  increasing  rural-urban  income  disparity  is  largely \nattributable to low rural labor productivity. The DMCs have substantial rural populations, whose \nshares in total populations vary from the lowest in Indonesia (46.3%) to the highest in Cambodia \n(79.3%). Rural labor opportunities in the region are largely in rice-dominant, small-scale, and low \nmechanized farming.7 A large portion of the rural workforce is engaged in subsistent agriculture \nand underemployed. It is crucial for the DMCs to generate productive economic opportunities for \nrural populations by diversifying the sector and building backward and forward linkages within the \nsector. \n \n5. \nIncreasing  demand  for  a  wide  variety  of  safe  food.  Due  to  increased  income  and \nawareness for a safe and balanced diet, the people in the region demand a variety of high quality \nand  more  nutritious  food  products.  Because  food  products  are  produced  and  transported  by \nmultiple players in the food value chains, it is more difficult to trace causes of food adulteration \nand contamination. The extended food value chains and wide variety of food products have made \nlaw enforcement on food safety control a challenge. While food safety laws have become more \nstringent in the DMCs, their capacity to enforce food safety laws is still limited. \n \n6. \nUnderdeveloped agro-based value chains. To achieve inclusive growth in the region, \nthe ANR sector needs to become more competitive and generate productive off- and non-farm \njobs. Agro-based value chain development is the key to realize this. However, value chains of \nmost agriculture products in the DMCs are underdeveloped because of insufficient private sector \ninvestment caused by various constraints: (i) underdeveloped infrastructure; (ii) limited access to \nlong-term  affordable finance  for  a great majority of  business  entities  in  the  sector  (i.e.,  micro-, \nsmall-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  cooperatives);  and  (iii)  sourcing  raw  materials  from \nmany scattered small farmers. \n \nNatural resources degradation and environmental pollution. The region is endowed \n7. \nwith rich natural resources, which are pivotal in sustaining a wide range of economic activities \nand livelihoods. However, natural resources intensive agricultural growth has caused immense \nnatural  resources  degradation  and  environmental  pollution.  Environmentally  unsustainable \nfarming  practices,  resource-intensive  industrial  agricultural  production,  poor  management  of \ncommercial plantations, and an increasing volume of agricultural products that require transport \nhave  all  contributed  to  the  degradation  of  natural  resources  and  environmental  pollution.  It  is \nimportant  to  take  a  holistic  approach  to  make  the  performance  of  agro-based  value  chains \nresource-efficient and green. \n \n8. \nClimate change impacts. The region is highly vulnerable to climate change as a large \nproportion of population and economic activity is concentrated along coastlines and water bodies. \nThe  region  relies  heavily  on  agriculture,  the  most  climate  vulnerable  sector,  for  livelihood. \nAlthough  the  region\u2019s  contribution  to  global  greenhouse  emissions  is  relatively  low,  Intended \nNationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change identifies the \nregion\u2019s  increasing  energy  use  in  agriculture,  industry,  and  transportation,  together  with \ndeforestation and land-use change as the main factors for the rise in greenhouse gas emissions.8 \nAn Asian Development Bank (ADB) study projected that the region may lose up to 11% of gross \ndomestic product by 2100 if no action is taken to address climate change.9 \n                                                \n7   Average agricultural land per capita ranges from 0.36 hectare in Cambodia as the largest and 0.12 hectare in Viet \n\nNam as the smallest. \n\n8   Synthesis of intended nationally determined contributions as communicated by Parties.

As one of \nthe fastest growing regions in the world characterized with rich agricultural resources, the region \nhas  had  some  success  in  integrating  into  the  global  agro-based  value  chains  with  countries \noutside  the  region  and  in  increasing  the  value  chain  linkages  within  the  region.  To  enable the \nregion  to  grow  as  the  hub  of  safe  and  environment-friendly  agro-based  value  chains,  ADB \nfacilitated  the  ministerial  level  agreement  Siem  Reap  Action  Plan  2018\u20132022  for  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion.10 This action plan is in line with the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint \n2025, which places a strategic importance to the ANR sector.11 \n \n10. \nPromotion  of  advanced  technologies.  Application  of  advanced  technologies  to \nagriculture is on the rise. Advanced technologies vary from agricultural machinery, biotechnology \nfor seeds and agricultural chemicals, and satellite imaging to more recent technologies such as \ninternet of things, drones, and robotics. They enable farmers to access critical information and \nimprove farming operations and marketing of their products. Buyers of farm products can better \ncommunicate  with  farmers  and  manage  supplies  and  inventory  more  efficiently.  Advanced \ntechnologies will also help establish food traceability systems, which are increasingly in demand \nby consumers. \n \n11. \nThe TA facility will help prepare and implement investment projects that will address the \nabove-mentioned challenges and capitalize on the opportunities. These projects will continue to \n(i) promote the use of climate-smart agricultural practices; (ii) promote the adoption of advanced \ntechnologies  such  as  satellite  and  drone-assisted  applications  to  increase  irrigation  efficiency; \n(iii) ensure  the  sustainable  use  of  land  and  water  resources;  and  (iv)  enhance  disaster \npreparedness  and  climate  resilience.  The  projects  will  strengthen  public  infrastructure  and \nservices (e.g., irrigation, rural roads, public markets, and food safety-related facilities and services) \nto  create  enabling  ANR  sector  development  and  business  environments  for  agro-based  value \nchain stakeholders (e.g.,  private  agribusiness  entities  and farmer  cooperatives). They  will  also \npromote  private  sector  investment  to  accelerate  growth  by  increasing  productivity  and  adding \nvalue, and ensure the quality of growth by improving food safety and environmental controls. The \nprojects will also promote efficiency in resource use, especially in the post-harvest segments of \nagro-based  value  chains.  They  will  incorporate  gender  designs  and  targets  to  improve  and \nsupport women\u2019s participation in the ANR sector.  \n \nThe  TA  facility  will  support  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  and  its  operational  priorities  by \n12. \n(i) promoting rural development and food security; (ii) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability; \nintegration;  and \nfostering \n(v) accelerating progress in gender equality.12  \n \n\nregional  cooperation  and \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2017.
