The\nProject  will  contribute  to  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to  promote  regional  cooperation.  The  Government\nreceived a project preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 to update the transport sector profile\u2014\nincluding an assessment of the priority needs of the sector\u2014and prepare the feasibility study for\nthe  proposed  Project.  Fact\u2013finding  for  the  Project  was  undertaken  and  a  tripartite  meeting  to\ndiscuss the findings of the Third Road Rehabilitation TA was held during 27 February\u201313 March\n2001,  and  loan  appraisal  was  conducted  during  24  May\u20136  June  2001.2  The  Project  was\nformulated  from  the  findings  of  ADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the  Government,\ndiscussions with other funding agencies and road sector representatives, and the findings of the\nThird Road Rehabilitation TA (footnote 1). If approved, the proposed loan will be ADB's fourth to\nthe transport sector of the Kyrgyz Republic. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nThe Transport Sector\n\n1.\n\nGeneral\n\n3.\nThe  transport  infrastructure  inherited  by  the  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs)  was\ndesigned to facilitate integration of the republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU) with Russia,\nrather than to serve the needs of independent countries. As a result, the transport networks of\nthe CARs often do not meet their domestic and international transport requirements. The Kyrgyz\nRepublic  is  a  mountainous,  landlocked  country,  and  road  transport  dominates  the  country's\ntransport sector. Road transport accounted for about 97 percent of freight tonnage movements\nand  almost  all  passenger  traffic  in  1999  (Appendix  2).  Railways  carry  most  of  the  remaining\nfreight,  including  a  substantial  part  of  the  cross\u2013border  traffic,  by  means  of  separate  branch\nlines that link the north of the country to the Kazakh rail system, and the south of the country to\nthe  Uzbek  system,  with  no  direct  connection  between  the  two  links.  Due  to  longer  average\nhaulage,  railways  account  for  about  21  percent  of  the  total  freight  in  terms  of  ton\u2013kilometers\n(ton\u2013km).  Air  transport  accounts  for  less  than  1  percent  of  passenger  movements,  mainly  on\nroutes between Bishkek and  Osh. Water transport is confined to a few small vessels on Lake\nIssyk\u2013Kul.\n\n                  \n\n1 TA 3335\u2013KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.\n2 The  Missions  comprised  J.  Miller,  Mission  Leader/Project  Economist;  F.  Agnello,  Poverty  Reduction  Specialist;  L.\n\nNazarbekova, Counsel; and K. Saari, Transport Specialist.\n\n\f2\n\nAs with most other republics of the FSU, the economic crisis stemming from the breakup\n4.\nof the FSU resulted in a decline in economic activity and disrupted customary trading patterns.\nThe  demand  for  transport  has  fallen  dramatically  since  independence.  The  lowest  levels  were\nreached in 1995 when the volumes of freight in ton\u2013km and passenger movements were only\n14  percent  and  33  percent  of  their  respective  1990  levels,  reflecting  a  sharp  decline  in  real\nincomes and output. The gross domestic product (GDP) and demand for freight and passenger\ntransport grew substantially in 1996 and 1997; however, GDP growth slowed in 1998 because\nof  (i)  the  impact  of  the  economic  crisis  in  Russia,  (ii)  damage  to  the  infrastructure  caused  by\nflooding  in  the  Fergana  valley,  and  (iii)  a  substantial  reduction  in  tourism  revenue  caused  by\nadverse  publicity  concerning  the  cyanide  spill  at  Lake  Issyk\u2013Kul.  Accordingly,  the  transport\ndemand for freight tons and ton\u2013km in 1999 was unchanged and lower, respectively, compared\nwith the 1997 levels. Since most of the roads were designed for higher traffic capacities and are\nunderutilized,  the  existing  basic  transport  infrastructure  is  adequate  for  the  level  of  economic\nactivity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion\nor  major  upgrading  of  the  transport  system,  but  proper  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  to\npreserve the existing network.\n\n5.\nThe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) is responsible for policymaking\nin  and  regulating,  planning,  and  developing  the  transport  and  communications  sectors  in  the\nKyrgyz Republic. In conjunction with the policy dialogue under the Second Road Rehabilitation\nProject3 and following the passage of Law No. 8 on Transport and issuance of Decree No. 419\nin  1998,  MOTC  was  restructured  to  improve  its  efficiency  (Appendix  3).  As  part  of  the\nrestructuring, a Government decree was issued in January 1999 requiring consolidation of the\nadministration  of  transport\u2013related  activities.  This  resulted  in  a  restructuring  of  responsibilities\namong  the  Ministry  of  Architecture  and  Construction,  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  (MIA),  and\nMOTC (para. 21).\n\n6.\nRailway  and  air  transport  are  under  MOTC's  jurisdiction.  MOTC  exercises  both\nregulatory  and  operational  functions  for  the  railway  network,  which  has  a  combined  length  of\n424  km.  Railways  are  expected  to  remain  under  Government  ownership.  A  joint\u2013stock\ncompany,  National  Aircompany  Kyrgyzstan  Aba  Joldory,  serves  as  the  Kyrgyz  Republic's\nnational  airline  and  also  operates  the  country's  airports.  The  Government  plans  to  separate\noperations of the airline and airports in the future. MOTC also exercises general regulatory and\nmonitoring functions for the operations of road transport for freight and passengers.\n\n2.\n\nThe Road Sector\n\na.\n\nThe Road Network\n\n7.\nThe  road  network  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  covers  all  seven  provinces  (oblasts),  and\nprovides connections to far\u2013flung communities and links to neighboring countries. The Bishkek\u2013\nOsh  road  provides  links  between  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  in  the  south  and  Kazakhstan  and\nRussia in the north. There are 18,876 km of roads under MOTC jurisdiction: 9,803 km of state\nroads and 9,073 km of local roads. Roads are divided into five design categories, distinguished\nmainly by carriageway width. About 15 percent of the roads are in category I (15 meters [m] or\nwider), category II (9\u201311.5 m), and category III (7.5 m); 85 percent are in category IV (6 m) and\ncategory V (4.5 m). About 40 percent of the roads are sealed, including some with gravel mixed\nwith bitumen binder. Over 50 percent are gravel and less than 10 percent are earth roads. The\n\n3 Loan 1630\u2013KGZ(SF): Second Road Rehabilitation Project, for $50 million, approved on 10 September 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f3\n\ncoverage of the road network is generally adequate for the developmental needs of the country.\nOf  primary  concern  is  the  deteriorating  state  of  the  roads  at  all  levels;  over  60  percent  now\nrequire periodic maintenance or rehabilitation.\n\nThere are 15,000 km of roads outside MOTC's jurisdiction, mainly rural and farm roads.\n8.\nMost  were  formerly  the  responsibility  of  state  and  collective  farms.  The  responsibility  for\nmaintaining  rural  and  farm  roads  is  now  with  the  local  district  administrations  following  the\nprogressive breakup of the state and collective farming system.\n\nb. \n\nRoad Standards and Safety\n\n9.\nThe  FSU's  road  standards  and  specifications  continue  to  be  used  in  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic. A number of studies have indicated that the design standards of FSU state roads are\ngenerally  comparable  with  those  of  the  United  States  or  Western  Europe,  but  do  not  always\nresult  in  optimum  road  design.  Roads  constructed  during  the  FSU  period  were  generally\ndesigned  for  axle  loads  of  6\u20138  tons  (t).  Since  independence,  axle  loads  of  10\u201312  t  and  even\nhigher  have  become  common,  which  has  considerably  reduced  the  residual  design  life  of\npavements.  Unlike  the  design  standards,  the  quality  of  road  construction  during  the  FSU  was\nrarely  acceptable,  mainly  because  of  lack  of  cost\u2013effective  construction  techniques,  and\ninadequate  independent  construction  supervision  and  quality  control.  Road  design  and\nconstruction  standards  were  reviewed  through  an  ADB\u2013financed  TA4  for  three  CARs\n(Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan) and Mongolia to prepare road design and\nconstruction standards that are suitable for market\u2013oriented operations. These standards will be\napplied to the civil works in the Project.\n\n 10.\nADB  is  also  significantly  involved  in  improving  road  safety  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,\nthrough the Second Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 3) and the Almaty\u2013Bishkek Regional\nRoad  Rehabilitation  Project.5  The  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  prepared  a  time\u2013bound\nroad  safety  program  to  reduce  the  accident  rate.  Under  the  Almaty\u2013Bishkek  Project,  the\nGovernment  agreed  to  establish  the  National  Road  Safety  Council  (NRSC)  with  a  full\u2013time\nsecretariat  to  coordinate  road  safety  activities  and  involve  the  various  stakeholders.  The\nGovernment  also  agreed  to  update  the  Road  Safety  Act  (RSA)  for  submission  to  parliament.\nThe  RSA  will  include  legislation  concerning  safe  driving,  safety  audit  of  road  designs,  safety\neducation, road safety publicity, vehicle safety standards, road safety research, and emergency\nassistance to accident victims. An advisory TA attached to the Almaty\u2013Bishkek Project will help\nthe  Government  to  establish  the  NRSC,  update  the  RSA,  prepare  a  Russian  version  of  the\nRoad Safety Guidelines prepared  under  an  earlier  TA,6  and  conduct  road  safety  seminars  to\nimplement the Road Safety Guidelines.\n\nc. \n\nVehicle Traffic and Fleet\n\n11.\nThe  busiest  roads  on  the  outskirts  of  Bishkek  typically  carry  an  average  annual  daily\ntraffic (AADT) of about 10,000 vehicles, while traffic levels on similar roads around Osh reach\nabout  4,500  AADT.  Sections  of  main  roads  farther  away  from  the  larger  towns,  such  as  the\ncentral sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, now carry about 1,000\u20131,500 AADT. Cars and vans\ngenerally  comprise  the  majority  of  traffic  on  these  roads.  Prior  to  the  economic  crisis,  traffic\n\n                  \n\n4  TA 5733\u2013REG: A Review of Road Design and Construction Standards, for $600,000, approved on 3 April 1997.\n5  Loan  1774\u2013KAZ:  Almaty\u2013Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project,  for  $65  million,  approved  on  31  October\n2000; Loan 1775\u2013KGZ: Almaty\u2013Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project, for $5 million, approved on 31 October\n2000.\n\n6 TA 5620\u2013REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.\n\n\f4\n\nvolumes  on  some  road  sections  were  three  and  six  times  higher  in  terms  of  freight  and\npassengers, respectively. Seasonal variations, reflecting both changes in transport demand and\nweather\u2013related constraints, are significant on roads crossing the central mountainous areas of\nthe country.\n\n12.\nIn  1998,  the  country's  vehicle  fleet  comprised  about  56,500  trucks,  13,200  buses,\n197,100  cars,  and  39,900  other  vehicles.  Since  1993,  the  number  of  cars  has  increased\nsubstantially,  buses  have  increased  by  a  small  amount,  and  trucks  and  other  vehicles  have\ndecreased substantially. The fleet is aging, since few companies have been in a position to buy\nmodern vehicles. Over half the truck fleet has a capacity of less than 7 t, with a predominance of\n5\u2013t  trucks.  Longer  distance  interurban  freight  movements  are  handled  mainly  by  three\u2013axle\nvehicles and semi\u2013trailers with average payloads in the range of 8\u201315 t. About 5 percent of the\nfleet has a capacity of 15 t or more.\n\n13.\nVehicle ownership patterns have changed dramatically since independence, when there\nwas  almost  no  private  ownership  of  vehicles.  About  95  percent  of  cars  are  privately  owned.\nPreviously,  state  organizations  owned  and  operated  most  trucks  and  buses.  With  the\nintroduction  of  the  privatization  program  and  auctions,  individuals  now  own  26  percent  of  the\ntrucks and 23 percent of the buses. The rest are owned and operated by transport companies.\nThe  majority  of  the  fleet  is  still  made  up  of  vehicles  manufactured  in  the  FSU.  Some  trucking\ncompanies  have  procured  secondhand  trucks  of  larger  capacity  and  of  more  modern  design,\nmainly for use on international routes. A significant number of cars, most of them secondhand,\nare now being imported from Western Europe for private use.\n\nd.\n\nRoad Transport Industry\n\n14.\nTransport  companies  were  controlled  by  a  joint\u2013stock  holding  company,  Kyrgyz  Auto\nTransport until 1994, when Decree No. 61 abolished the company and transferred its functions\nto MOTC. Of the total 251 transport sector enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic, 126 have been\nprivatized,  primarily  through  conversion  to  joint\u2013stock  companies.  Currently  86  companies\nprovide road transport services, and 74 of them have been privatized. The companies that have\nnot  been  privatized  comprise  urban  bus  enterprises  in  major  cities  and  some  enterprises\nconnected  with  state  security.  The  transport  companies  employ  about  25,000  people.  Most  of\nthe freight and passenger transport companies operate at the provincial and district (raion) level,\nwith  a  small  number  of  national\u2013level  operators.  As  a  result  of  measures  that  the  Government\nintroduced in 1994 to increase competition, most of the national and provincial holding companies\nand  associations  (which  had  continued  to  exercise  control  over  the  operations  of  individual\ntransport companies) were abolished.\n\n15.\nThrough ownership and regulation the Government continues to have a strong influence in\nthe  market  for  intercity  passenger  transport.  The  Government  maintains  large  holdings  in  the\njoint\u2013stock  companies  operating  transport  services.  Buses  must  travel  designated  routes  and\noperate out of Government\u2013owned bus stations. Kyrgyz Transport Inspection, created in MOTC in\n1994, issues transport licenses and regulates transport services. The Project  will  address  these\nand other issues affecting competitiveness of the market for passenger transport services through\npolicy dialogue (para. 34).\n\n16.\nThe  market  for  freight  transport  services  is  more  competitive  than  that  for  passenger\ntransport.  Freight  transport  customers  are  free  to  negotiate  conditions  of  price  and  quality  of\nservice directly with the operators. Freight forwarders are encouraged to negotiate and arrange\nintermodal transport services, thus facilitating door\u2013to\u2013door transport arrangements, and to offer\n\n\f5\n\nservices  directly  themselves.  However,  the  Government  also  plays  a  large  role  in  freight\ntransport,  through  its  holdings  in  joint\u2013stock  companies  and  through  regulation.  MOTC  is\nresponsible  for  monitoring  and  regulation,  including  licensing,  inspection,  and  safety  audits.\nCompetitiveness  of  the  market  for  freight  transport  services  is  also  being  addressed  by  the\nProject through policy dialogue (para. 34).\n\ne. \n\nRoad Sector Revenue and Expenditure\n\nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  recovering  from  the  adverse  impact  of  the  1998  Russian  crisis\n17.\nand  registered  GDP  growth  of  5  percent  in  2000.  However,  the  Government  is  still  facing  a\ndifficult fiscal situation and high external debt burden, and the IMF's current PRGF has lapsed.\nDespite fiscal restraint, the fiscal deficit of 10.2 percent of GDP for 2000 was much higher than\nthe target (para 25).\n\n18.\nFinancing for the road sector suffers from the overall fiscal constraints and is inadequate\nfor  the  country\u2019s  needs.  In  1999,  MOTC  estimated  the  annual  requirement  for  the  road  sector\n(including  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  administration,  and  design)  at  about  Som700\nmillion. Total road\u2013sector\u2013related revenues comprised Som492 million; however, only Som343\nmillion  was  allocated  to  MOTC,  and  only  Som142  million  of  that  was  allocated  for  road\nmaintenance.\n\n19. With  the  assistance  of  an  ADB\u2013financed  TA  for  institutional  strengthening,7  the\nGovernment passed the Road Fund Act in 1998 and, as specified in the loan covenants for the\nSecond  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  is  collecting  road  user  charges  prescribed  under  the  act.\nAccording to the Road Fund Act, a portion of the road sector revenues should be deposited into\na  separate  road  fund  account.  The  specific  sources  of  revenue  for  the  road  fund  are  (i)  50\npercent of the excise taxes on fuel, (ii) 100 percent of the 0.8 percent tax on enterprises, (iii) 100\npercent of the tax on vehicle owners, (iv) 90 percent of vehicle registration fees, (v) charges for\nthe  use  of  toll  roads  and  tunnels,  (vi)  charges  for  oversize  and  overweight  vehicles,  (vii)  state\nbudget  allocations,  and  (viii)  foreign  loans  and  grants.  In  1999,  collections  of  revenues\ndesignated by statute for deposit in the road fund, excluding state budget allocations and foreign\nloans  and  grants,  totaled  approximately  Som415  million.  However,  due  to  the  severe  fiscal\nproblems faced by the Kyrgyz Republic (para. 17), a separate account for the road fund has not\nbeen  established.  Instead  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  makes  annual  allocations  for  road\nmaintenance and other road sector expenditures based on overall budget considerations. The\nallocations  have  been  inadequate  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s  needs  (para.  18).  The  Project  is\naddressing  the  issue  of  ensuring  adequate  financing  for  road  maintenance  through  policy\ndialogue (paras. 35\u201336).\n\nf.\n\nRoad Administration\n\n20.\nOrganizational  Structure.  The  Automobile  Roads  Act  gives  the  main  responsibility  for\nplanning  and  administering  road  sector  policies,  programs,  and  projects  to  MOTC.  The\nDepartment of Roads (DOR) under MOTC is responsible for managing the road sector. MOTC's\nseven  regional  road  maintenance  agencies  (RRMAs),  one  in  each  province,  plus  the  Bishkek\u2013\nOsh  Road  Division  are  responsible  for  maintaining  the  state  and  local  roads  under  MOTC's\njurisdiction. The RRMAs and Bishkek\u2013Osh Road Division are composed of 82 local maintenance\nunits  (LMUs)  that  carry  out  actual  maintenance  works.  Other  important  agencies  in  the  road\n\n7  TA 2587\u2013KGZ: Institutional Strengthening of the Road Sector, for $800,000, approved on 13 June 1996.\n\n                  \n\n\f6\n\nsector are (i) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency for six freight transport companies and forwarding\nagencies engaged mainly in international trade; and (ii) technical agencies in various stages of\ndivestment  from  MOTC\u2019s  control,  including  the  Road  Design  Institute  (Kyrgyzdortransproect)\nand  a  small  agency  responsible  for  developing  and  testing  new  road  construction  techniques\nand equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika).\n\n21.\nADB  has  assisted  MOTC  in  streamlining  management  of  the  road  sector.  In  1998,  the\nDirectorate  General  for  Rehabilitation  and  Maintenance  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road,  established\nthrough Decree No. 45 of 4 March 1996 under the Office of the Prime Minister, was integrated\ninto  DOR.  The  Government  has  completed  the  transfer  of  responsibilities  for  developing  road\ndesign and construction standards from the Ministry of Architecture and Construction to MOTC.\nOn 30 November 1999 MIA and MOTC agreed to jointly administer the functions of road safety\nand traffic management, while leaving the responsibility for vehicle inspection with MIA.\n\n22.\nPlanning  and  Budgeting.  In  the  past,  road  expenditure  plans  and  budgets  were\nprepared  on  the  basis  of  periodic  assessments  of  road  conditions,  using  norms  and  technical\njudgment  to  decide  the  level  of  required  interventions  and  their  priority.  Neither  an  economic\noptimization of investments nor a correlation of expenditures to user charges was undertaken.\nWith the drastic reduction in road financing and the restructuring of the road sector institutions,\nthe planning and budgeting system collapsed. To determine the broad expenditure priorities in\naccordance with road traffic, road conditions, and possible types of intervention, ADB assisted\nMOTC through the Institutional Strengthening TA (footnote 7) in reviewing the existing planning\nand  budgeting  practices  for  road  maintenance  and  in  preparing  preliminary  estimates  of\nrehabilitation and maintenance needs for the national road network, including the Bishkek\u2013Osh\nroad. The TA on Policy Support in the Transport Sector8 gave recommendations for improving\nfinancial  management \nthe\nrecommendations (para. 80).\n\nin  MOTC.  The  Government  has  agreed \n\nimplement \n\nto \n\nConstruction  and  Maintenance.  The  Government  has  made  substantial  efforts  to\n23.\nprivatize  road  construction  and  maintenance  operations.  All  of  the  29  road  construction\nenterprises have been privatized. The uncertainty relating to DOR's road construction program\nhas hindered developing the private road construction industry. However, ADB's ongoing road\nrehabilitation  projects  have  assisted  in  developing  the  privatized  road  construction  enterprises\nthrough extensive subcontracting by the civil works contractors.\n\n24.\nThe RRMAs of MOTC have overall responsibility for carrying out road maintenance. At\nthe  operational  level,  the  82  LMUs  under  the  RRMAs  maintain  18,876  km  of  state  and  local\nroads  under  MOTC  jurisdiction  (para.  7).  Local  authorities  maintain  roads  not  under  MOTC\njurisdiction (para. 8). The total staff of the RRMAs and LMUs is around 3,000 people. Through\nits ongoing projects, ADB has been working with MOTC to improve the equipment and methods\nused  for  road  maintenance.  Under  the  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  3),  a\nmaintenance manual was prepared, and training of maintenance personnel is now under way.\nMaintenance  equipment  for  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  is  being  purchased  through  the  cofinanced\nportion  of  the  first  Road  Rehabilitation  Project.9  With  ADB  assistance,  MOTC  also  established\nthe equipment pool, which is now leasing equipment to contractors for road sector activities. In\nthe future, this equipment can be used by contractors to conduct road maintenance. While the\nGovernment wants to retain the LMUs as part of MOTC, it has undertaken measures, with ADB\nassistance, to contract out road maintenance activities. Under the Second Road Rehabilitation\n\n                  \n\n8  TA 3065\u2013KGZ: Policy Support in the Transport Sector, for $600,000, approved on 10 September 1998.\n9  Loan 1444\u2013KGZ(SF): Road Rehabilitation Project, for $50 million, approved on 13 June 1996.\n\n\f7\n\nProject,  the  Government  has  invited  bids  from  local  contractors  to  undertake  routine\nmaintenance on a section of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. Under the proposed Project, the contracting\nout of road maintenance will be expanded (para. 37).\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n25.\nPublic  investment  in  the  transport  sector  dropped  from  about  2  percent  of  the  gross\nnational product (GNP) in 1990 to near zero during 1995. As a result, the transport infrastructure\nhas deteriorated to a point where major reconstruction will be required unless adequate funds are\nallocated for rehabilitation and maintenance. Transport investment needs to increase to about 4\npercent of GDP to avoid major reconstruction in the future. In 1998 and 1999, expenditures in the\ntransport  sector  were,  respectively,  Som751  million  (2.2  percent  of  GDP),  and  Som800  million\n(2.3  percent  of  GDP),  of  which  Som273  million  was  for  roads.  Increased  investment  in  the\ntransport  sector  is  dependent  on  continued  economic  growth.  However,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s\nhigh external public debt burden, at $1.24 billion or 95 percent of GDP, poses a substantial threat\nto economic growth. The IMF and the Government are preparing a detailed strategy to address\nthe  debt  situation,  including  the  Government  reaching  agreement  with  the  Paris  Club  on  debt\nrescheduling.10  Subject  to  the  Government  and  IMF  reaching  agreement  on  the  economic\nprogram  shortly,  a  new  three\u2013year  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)  could  be  in\nplace  before  the  end  of  2001.  The  new  PRGF  program  is  expected  to  include  limits  on  Public\nInvestment Program (PIP) disbursements and thus external borrowing. Under the lapsed PRGF,\nthe Government and the IMF agreed that PIP disbursements would be limited to 6.0 percent of\nGDP  in  2001  and  5.5  percent  in  2002,  and  would  progressively  fall  to  3.0  percent  by  2005.  To\nmeet  these  limits,  the  Government  has  prioritized  ongoing  projects  in  the  PIP;  prioritization  of\nfuture  projects  is  still  ongoing.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  the  PIP  gives  highest\npriority to rehabilitation of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road.\n\n26.\nThe Government's transport sector strategy and plans are included in the Transport and\nRoad  Sector  Policy  Statement  prepared  under  the  institutional  strengthening  TA  (footnote  7)\nand  issued  by  MOTC  in  1997,  and  in  the  PIP  being  prepared  by  MOF.  The  Government's\noverall  policy  objectives  for  the  transport  sector  were  developed  with  ADB  assistance  and\ninclude (i) adequately maintaining transport infrastructure to support the reform of the economy;\n(ii)  privatizing  transport  operations  and  promoting  competition  among  operators,  while\naddressing safety and environmental concerns; and (iii) increasing cost recovery from the users\nof transport infrastructure. To achieve these objectives, the Government's strategy includes (i)\nincreasing  the  financial  provision  for  rehabilitating  and  maintaining  the  road  network;  (ii)\nconsolidating  road  sector  responsibilities  under  MOTC;  (iii)  promoting  private  sector\nparticipation in road maintenance; (iv) completing the privatization of road transport operations\nand  dismantling  of  licensing  controls,  which  hinder  competition;  (v)  promoting,  in  collaboration\nwith neighboring countries, rail transport as the most efficient means of transporting bulk loads\nover  long  distances;  (vi)  privatizing  lake  shipping  services;  (vii)  promoting  civil  aviation\ninfrastructure  and  supporting  services  that  encourage  foreign  and  local  airline  operations;  and\n(viii) increasing road sector revenues through appropriate pricing and taxation.\n\n                  \n\n10 The  19  permanent  members  of  the  Paris  Club  comprise  governments  holding  large  debt  owed  by  other\ngovernments. All Paris Club decisions on debt rescheduling require a consensus among the participating debtor and\ncreditor  countries.  Debt  rescheduling  agreements  also  require  debtor  countries  to  implement  reforms  to  prevent\nfuture debt repayment difficulties.\n\n\fC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n8\n\n27.\nADB  is  playing  a  leading  role  in  providing  policy  advice,  capacity  building,  and  capital\nfinancing  for  the  Kyrgyz  road  sector.  ADB\u2019s  first  and  second  loans  of  $50  million  each,  with\ncofinancing  of  about  $28  million  and  $41  million,  respectively,  from  the  Japan  Bank  for\nInternational Cooperation (JBIC), have helped the Government rehabilitate part of the Bishkek\u2013\nOsh  road  (footnotes  3  and  9).  In  addition,  ADB  has  provided  six  TA  grants  totaling  $3.64\nmillion.11 The World Bank approved a $22 million loan for the Urban Transport Project in August\n2000  to  rehabilitate  urban  roads  in  Bishkek,  Jalal\u2013Abad,  and  Osh.  The  Islamic  Development\nBank  (IDB)  approved  $9  million  in  1998  to  rehabilitate  the  Jalal\u2013Abad\u2013Uzgen  section  of  the\nBishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  a  short  bypass,  and  grant  assistance  for  a  feasibility  study  of\nrehabilitating a section of the Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart road. ADB, JBIC, and IDB complement\neach other in rehabilitating the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, and this cooperation will continue under the\nProject.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n28.\nFor  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road,  ADB  has  financed  two  projects  that  are  rehabilitating  priority\nsections  of  the  road  and  have  supported  policy  reform  and  institutional  strengthening,  thereby\nimproving  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  the  country\u2019s  principal  road  transport  corridor.  The  civil\nworks for the first project began in September 1996, and the project was physically completed in\nJuly 2001, or 21 months later than the original project completion date. The overall delay is due to\na nine\u2013month delay in procuring and awarding the civil works contract, and to a one\u2013year delay in\nexecuting the works. All the loan covenants for the first project have been fully or partly complied\nwith.  The  civil  works  for  the  second  project  began  in  March  1999,  and  overall  progress  of  the\nADB\u2013financed  civil  works  is  about  60  percent.  The  original  loan  closing  date  has  not  been\nextended; however, physical completion may not occur until three months after the original project\ncompletion  date,  due  to  the  delay  in  the  detailed  design  of  the  tunnel  works.  All  the  loan\ncovenants  have  been  complied  with,  except  for  the  loan  covenant  that  requires  establishing  a\nseparate road fund account, which was waived by ADB on 14 July 2001 (para. 35).\n\n29.\nADB's  experience  with  the  ongoing  road  rehabilitation  projects  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\ndemonstrates  that  skills  are  available  to  implement  technically  uncomplicated  infrastructure\nprojects  supervised  by  international  consultants,  and  highlights  the  need  for  investments  to  be\naccompanied  by  comprehensive  support  for  policy  reform,  institutional  strengthening,  and\nsignificant  consultant  assistance.  These  lessons  have  been  taken  into  account  in  designing  the\nproposed Project.\n\nE.\n\nADB's Operational and Sector Strategy\n\nThe  main  objectives  of  ADB's  strategy12  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  are  to  (i)  support  the\n30.\nGovernment\u2019s  reform  activities  and  strengthen  its  development  management  by  encouraging\ninstitutional  change,  strengthening  institutional  capacity,  and  improving  the  provision  of  public\nservices;  (ii)  encourage  the  creation  of  a  new  structure  for  output  and  capacity  by  the  private\nsector  through  investment  and  job  creation;  and  (iii)  enhance  the  long\u2013term  potential  of  the\ncountry  by  investing  in  physical  infrastructure  and  human  development  as  well  as  selective\n\n                  \n\n11 TA  2256\u2013KGZ:  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  21  December  1994;  TA  2587\u2013KGZ\n(footnote 7) TA 2760\u2013KGZ: Second Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 11 February 1997; TA\n3065\u2013KGZ: (footnote 8); TA 3335\u2013KGZ (footnote 1), and TA 3531-KGZ: Improvement of the Road Sector Efficiency,\nfor $440,000, approved on 31 October 2000.\n\n12 Country Assistance Plan: Kyrgyz Republic (2001\u20132003), December 2000.\n\n\f9\n\ninterventions  to  protect  and  rehabilitate  the  environment.  To  maximize  the  impact  of  ADB\u2019s\nlimited  resources  and  in  consultation  with  the  Government  and  other  aid  agencies,  ADB\u2019s\nactivities are focusing on (i) improved provision of public services, particularly those provided by\nlocal  governments;  (ii)  agriculture,  including  rural  finance;  (iii)  human  development;  and  (iv)\ninfrastructure,  especially  rehabilitation  projects  to  preserve  the  economic  utility  of  the  past\ninvestment in the road sector.\n\n31.\nADB\u2019s transport sector strategy supports the Government\u2019s ongoing economic transition\nto  a  market\u2013driven  economy  by  assisting  in  (i)  developing  an  efficient  policy  and  regulatory\nframework;  (ii)  corporatizing/commercializing  and,  where  appropriate,  privatizing  operations  of\nstate\u2013owned  enterprises;  (iii)  promoting  competition  and  private  sector  participation  in  the\nproviding and operating of road infrastructure facilities and services; (iv) improving road funding\nby improving tax and duties collection, developing a user\u2013pays approach to road funding, and\nremoving  subsidy\u2013induced  distortions  in  pricing  of  transport  services;  (v)  rehabilitating  and\nimproving  operation,  maintenance,  and  safety  standards  of  the  road  network;  (vi)  developing\nhuman resources; and (vii) improving environmental standards. ADB\u2019s involvement in the road\nsector since 1996 through the first and second road rehabilitation projects has been guided by\nits sector strategy and has been instrumental in improving the policy and regulatory framework,\ninstitutional strengthening of MOTC and other sector institutions, preparing a road maintenance\nplan, and mobilizing additional resources from other agencies.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n32.\nADB's ongoing projects have helped the Government implement reforms in the areas of\npolicy  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development,  road\nsector  funding  and  cost  recovery,  road  maintenance,  and  road  safety.  The  policy  issues\ndiscussed  and  agreed  upon  with  the  Government  during  project  processing  strengthen  and\ncomplement  the  earlier  initiatives  (Appendix  4).  The  policy  dialogue  focused  on  poverty\nreduction,  competitiveness  of  markets  for  transport  services,  financing  of  road  maintenance,\nroad maintenance practices, and MOTC financial management reform.\n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n33.\nPoverty  has  been  a  major  issue  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  since  independence.  The\nGovernment is committed to reducing poverty, and the national strategy for poverty reduction is\nbeing prepared with ADB assistance. In addition to improving the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, the Project\nwill  also  improve  secondary  roads  in  areas  with  high  poverty  levels.13  MOTC  was  extensively\ninvolved in selecting the secondary roads for the Project. The Government agreed to provide its\nshare  of  funds  for  the  secondary  road  component  of  the  Project  and  to  encourage  the  active\nparticipation  of  the  project  beneficiaries,  e.g.,  through  community\u2013based  maintenance  of\nsecondary roads.\n\n2. \n\nCompetitiveness of Markets for Transport Services\n\nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  made  substantial  progress  over  the  last  few  years  in\n34.\ncommercializing transport enterprises; however, the Government still has substantial influence\nin  the  markets  for  transport  services,  for  example,  through  Government  ownership  of  bus\n\n                  \n\n13  The  secondary  roads  included  in  the  Project  connect  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  with  poor  villages  that  are  primarily\ndependent on agriculture. These roads have a mix of earth, gravel, and deteriorated pavement surfaces. In terms of\nwidth, they are classified as categories IV and V (para. 7).\n\n\f10\n\nstations  and  licensing  and  other  regulations  (paras.  14\u201316).  Increased  competitiveness  of  the\nmarkets  for  transport  services  is  necessary  to  improve  transport  services  for  all  inhabitants  of\nthe  project  area  and  ensure  that  the  reductions  in  transport  costs  are  passed  on  to  transport\nusers.  The  Government  has  agreed  that  the  TA  associated  with  the  Project  will  include  a\ncomponent to analyze the markets for transport services and give recommendations to improve\nthe  competitiveness  of  the  markets  so  as  to  maximize  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the\nProject. The TA will also study the impact of the measures to increase competitiveness on the\npoorest part of the population, and any additional measures to ensure that the poorest are not\nnegatively  affected  by  regulatory  changes  or  other  proposed  measures.  The  Government\nagreed  to  implement  the  regulatory  changes  recommended  by  the  TA,  and  which  are\nacceptable  to  ADB,  for  improving  the  competitiveness  of  the  markets  for  transport  services  to\nensure that the project benefits are passed on to the poor (para. 80).\n\n3. \n\nFinancing of Road Maintenance\n\n35.\nThe  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  included  loan  covenants  related  to  the\noperation of the road fund, which were designed to ensure adequate and sustainable financing\nof  road  maintenance.  The  Government  has  made  significant  progress  on  this  issue,  i.e.,\ncollecting road user charges specified in the Road Fund Act and hiring independent auditors to\naudit  collection  of  these  revenues.  However,  the  covenant  requiring  establishment  of  a\nseparate,  dedicated  account  for  the  road  fund  has  not  been  complied  with.  While  the\nGovernment is aware of the importance of this issue, it is presently unable to comply with the\ncovenant.  Establishing  dedicated  accounts  outside  the  Government's  consolidated  budget  will\nnot be prudent in light of the Government's current fiscal difficulties (para. 17). In view of this, a\nseparate  dedicated  road  fund  account  is  considered  premature  and  accordingly  ADB  waived\nthis  covenant.  The  collection  of  road  user  charges  in  accordance  with  the  Road  Fund  Act  will\ncontinue.\n\nTo provide for adequate financing of road maintenance, the Government has agreed to\n36.\nloan covenants mandating specific budget allocations for maintaining (i) the Bishkek\u2013Osh road,\nand  (ii)  all  other  roads  under  the  jurisdiction  of  MOTC.14  These  covenants  indicate  the\nGovernment's  commitment  to  provide  adequate  financing  for  road  maintenance.  MOF  will\nestablish a separate budget item for maintaining the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and will allocate funding\nfor  maintaining  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  other  roads  under  MOTC  administration  in  the\namounts shown in Table 1. The amounts are sufficient for conducting routine maintenance on\nthe  rehabilitated  sections  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  other  MOTC  roads  and  represent\nsubstantial  increases  over  current  levels.  MOF  will  adjust  these  allocations  to  compensate  for\nthe effects of inflation and depreciation of the som against the dollar. Independent auditors will\naudit the expenditures for road maintenance annually.\n\nRoads\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\nTable 1: Allocations for Maintenance\n(Som million)\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2000\n\n1.

The  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  give  high\npriority  to  road  maintenance  and  has  agreed  to  expand  road  maintenance  capacity  building.\nUnder the proposed Project, MOTC will invite bids from contractors, regardless of ownership, for\nroutine  maintenance  on  all  sections  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  for  which  the  construction\ncontractor's  warranty  period  has  expired.  Policy  dialogue  under  the  ongoing  projects  has\nfocused  on  maintaining  national  roads.  The  proposed  Project  will  improve  secondary  roads\nalong  with  sections  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road,  and  will  extend  improved  road  maintenance\npractices  to  secondary  roads  as  well.  The  advisory  TA  will  develop  a  system  for  maintaining\nsecondary  roads  based  on  collaboration  between  the  LMUs  and  local  communities,  which  will\nhelp ensure that the poverty\u2013reduction benefits of improving secondary roads will be sustained.\nMOTC  has  agreed  to  ensure  the  maintenance  of  secondary  roads  rehabilitated  under  the\nProject  by  preparing  the  LMUs  assigned  to  the  Project\u2019s  secondary  roads  to  operate  the  new\nmaintenance  system,  including  procuring  appropriate  maintenance  equipment  and  enacting  or\nmodifying any necessary regulations (para. 80).\n\n5. \n\nMOTC Financial Management Reform\n\n38.\nADB's ongoing projects have assisted the Government in making substantial progress in\nrestructuring MOTC to improve its efficiency in managing the transport sector. However, there\nremains  additional  scope  for  institutional  reform  to  further  improve  efficiency.  The  current\norganizational structure of financial management in MOTC is designed for historical functions of\noversight,  rather  than  the  needs  of  management  in  a  market  environment.  MOTC's  current\nfinancial  management  structure  was  studied  under  the  TA  for  Policy  Support  in  the  Transport\nSector  (footnote  8).  Recommendations  for  improvement  include  appointing  a  chief  financial\nofficer to head MOTC\u2019s financial management and planning functions, integrating the financial\nplanning and management functions of MOTC and the RRMAs, and starting implementation of\ninternational accounting standards. MOTC has agreed to implement these changes, which will\nintegrate  and  ensure  the  consistency  of  its  financial  reporting;  improve  the  effectiveness  of\nfinancial  management;  and  increase  the  usefulness  of  financial  reporting  for  planning,\nbudgeting, and other management decision making (para. 80).\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  two  main  centers  of  population,  trade,  and  industrial  activity:\n39.\nBishkek, the capital, in the north of the country, and Osh, in the southwest, at the eastern end of\nthe  Fergana  valley.  The  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  provides  the  only  internal  surface  connection\nbetween  these  two  national  centers.  The  road  passes  through  four  of  the  country's  seven\nregions and serves over two million people, almost half the country's population. The Bishkek\u2013\nOsh  road  is  vital  for  integrating  the  Kyrgyz  economy,  providing  markets  for  agricultural  produce\nfrom Osh and Jalal\u2013Abad provinces, and strengthening social and cultural links among the Kyrgyz\nRepublic's population groups. In addition to being the most important domestic transport corridor,\nthe road is also important from a regional perspective: it comprises part of the transnational route\nlinking  Tajikistan  and  the  agriculturally  productive  Fergana  valley  in  Uzbekistan  to  Almaty  and\n\n\f12\n\nRussia.  In  addition,  the  northernmost  section  forms  part  of  the  Almaty\u2013Bishkek\u2013Tashkent  road,\nwhich is also an important regional transport corridor.\n\n40.\nADB has been involved in the Kyrgyz road sector since 1996. The Project would be the\nthird  phase  of  a  rehabilitation  program  for  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road,15  which  has  a  total  length  of\nabout 650 km. The two ongoing projects are rehabilitating the central, mountainous sections of\nthe  road  (from  km  81  to  km  426),  which  are  in  the  most  advanced  state  of  deterioration  and\nhave the worst safety conditions. The proposed Project will rehabilitate the most deteriorated of\nthe remaining sections of the road in the project area in Jalal\u2013Abad and Osh provinces, as well as\nsecondary roads.\n\n41.\nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  one  of  the  poorest  of  the  CARs.  About  52  percent  of  the\npopulation  are  estimated  to  be  living  in  poverty  (unable  to  afford  a  minimum  consumption\nbasket), and about 18 percent are estimated to be living in extreme poverty (unable to obtain a\nminimum  diet).  About  73  percent  of  people  in  the  project  area  are  estimated  to  be  poor,  and\nabout  28  percent  are  estimated  to  be  extremely  poor.  The  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by\nlowering  transport  costs  for  road  users  and  by  improving  market  access  for  farmers  in  Jalal\u2013\nAbad,  who  no  longer  have  access  to  their  traditional  markets  in  Uzbekistan.  In  addition,\nimproving the secondary roads will improve access to markets, employment opportunities, and\nmore  comprehensive  health  facilities  for  a  large  number  of  people.  The  Project  will  also\ngenerate employment for local poor people during the rehabilitation works.\n\n42.\nThe  Project  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  by\nreducing  the  cost  of  road  transport  and  improving  access  to  markets  in  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh\ncorridor. The Project will rehabilitate the most deteriorated of the remaining sections of the road\nlinking Bishkek and Osh and will improve market access for agricultural producers in Jalal\u2013Abad\nprovince. The Project will support reforms in the road sector to improve road maintenance and\nto provide a sustainable source and adequate level of financing for road maintenance.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1. \n\nObjectives\n\n2. \n\nScope\n\n43.\n\nThe Project comprises\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nrehabilitation  of  about  120  km  of  the  650  km  two\u2013lane  national  highway  from\nBishkek  to  Osh,  in  particular,  km  427\u2013498  in  Jalal\u2013Abad  province  (72  km)  and\nthe Uzgen\u2013Osh section in Osh province (48 km), including safety features;\n\nimprovement  of  about  125  km  of  secondary  roads  in  Jalal\u2013Abad  (Tash  Kumyr\u2013\nKara  Djigadz  and  Bazar  Korgon\u2013Arslanbob\u2013Kyzyl  Ungkur)  feeding  into  the\nBishkek\u2013Osh road;\n\n                  \n\n15 The Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 9) assisted the Government in rehabilitating 135 km of key sections of the\nBishkek\u2013Osh  road.  JBIC  provided  parallel  cofinancing  of  $28  million  for  civil  works,  consulting  services,  and\nmaintenance  equipment.  The  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  3)  assisted  the  Government  in\nrehabilitating another 208 km of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. JBIC again provided parallel cofinancing of $40.8 million for\ncivil works and consulting services.\n\n\f13\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and\nimplementation of reforms in road maintenance practices; and\n\nprocurement  of  light,  hand\u2013operated  equipment  and  truck\u2013mounted  cranes  for\nroutine maintenance of the selected secondary roads and the Bishkek\u2013Osh road.\n\n44.\nIn  addition,  an  accompanying  advisory  TA  will  develop  a  system  for  maintaining\nsecondary  roads  through  the  collaboration  of  the  LMUs  and  local  communities  and  will\nrecommend measures to improve the competitiveness of markets for transport services (paras.\n68\u201370).\n\nC.\n\nTechnical Justification\n\n45.\nThe existing Bishkek\u2013Osh road was designed and constructed mostly during the 1960s\naccording to FSU standards; however, construction of the road did not strictly follow the design\nand  the  quality  was  substandard.  As  a  result,  the  road  suffers  from  frost  damage,  and  the\nasphalt pavement has worn out. The road has further deteriorated with the collapse of the FSU\nand subsequent disintegration of the road maintenance organizations. Safety conditions on the\nroad  are  poor.  The  road  passes  through  many  villages  in  which  there  are  no  pedestrian\nwalkways or facilities for nonmotorized and light vehicles.\n\n46.\nThe sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road to be included in the Project consist of two lanes\nand are the most deteriorated of the sections not covered by other projects. The first 30 km of\nthe  km  427\u2013498  section  pass  through  steep  slopes  along  the  Naryn  River  and  are  prone  to\nlandslides, flash floods, and severe erosion. Many existing culverts on this section are too small\nto ensure sufficient drainage and become clogged during heavy rains. The works for the first 30\nkm of the km 427\u2013498 section include rehabilitating the pavement structures (base course and\npavement),  improving  the  drainage  structures,  repairing  damaged  culverts  and  bridges,  and\nconstructing  protective  structures  against  rockfalls,  landslides,  and  erosion.  The  works  on  the\nrest  of  the  km  427\u2013498  section  consist  of  rehabilitating  the  pavement  and  repairing  drainage\nstructures.  On  the  Uzgen\u2013Osh  section,  similar  pavement  rehabilitation  and  drainage  repair\nworks  will  be  implemented.  In  addition,  pedestrian  walkways  will  be  added  and  traffic  safety\ninstallations will be improved.\n\n47.\nThe  present  traffic  levels  on  the  sections  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  to  be  rehabilitated\nunder the Project vary from a low of about 1,300 vehicles per day in the km 427\u2013498 section to\na  high  of  about  4,600  vehicles  per  day  in  the  Uzgen\u2013Osh  section.  Traffic  levels  for  heavy\nvehicles range from a low of about 470 trucks per day in the km 427\u2013498 section to a high of\nabout 670 trucks per day in the Uzgen\u2013Osh section. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type have been\nprepared for the 2002\u20132024 period for the sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road to be rehabilitated\n(Appendix  5).  The  forecasts  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  GDP  and  population  and  the\nelasticity of demand for freight and passenger traffic. Some additional traffic is expected to be\ngenerated as a result of  lower transport costs arising from the Project.  The projected average\nannual growth rates for passenger traffic are 6.8 percent during 2001\u20132005, 7.0 percent during\n2006\u20132010, and 6.5 percent for the remaining project period. Freight traffic is expected to grow\nat rates of 6.8 percent during 2001\u20132005, 6.5 percent during 2006\u20132010, and 6.0 percent during\nthe remaining project period.\n\nThe  two  secondary  roads  included  in  the  Project  are  in  poor  condition  and  will  be\n48.\nrehabilitated  to  different  standards  appropriate  to  each  section.  On  the  Tash  Kumyr\u2013Kara\nDjigadz  road  (53  km),  the  first  15  km  will  be  rehabilitated  by  repairing  the  existing  bituminous\n\n\f14\n\npavement.  The  works  on  the  km  16\u201353  section  of  this  road  will  comprise  building  a  proper\nembankment  and  constructing  a  bituminous  gravel  pavement.  The  Bazar  Korgon\u2013Arslanbob\nroad  (52  km)  and  its  branch  to  Kyzyl  Ungkur  (20  km)  will  be  rehabilitated  by  repairing  the\nbituminous pavement of the first 10 km and laying a gravel surface on the remainder of the road\nto Arslanbob, with improvements to the earth road and bridge on the branch to Kyzyl Ungkur. In\naddition, damaged culverts and bridges along the length of this road will be repaired or rebuilt.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n49.\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $50  million  equivalent  (including  physical\ncontingencies,  price  escalation,  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  but  excluding\nthe VAT and other taxes, of which $30.6 million (61.2 percent) is the foreign exchange cost. The\nlocal currency costs are estimated at $19.4 million equivalent, or 38.8 percent of the total cost.\nThe cost estimates are summarized in Table 2, with details in Appendix 6.\n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\na.

ADB financing of a portion of the local currency cost\nis justified due to the Government's budget constraints, the heavy external debt burden, and the\ncountry's  severe  poverty.  The  Project  will  have  a  strong  pro\u2013poor  growth  impact.  In  view  of\nthese reasons, provision of local cost financing for this Project is reasonable. The ADB loan will\nrepresent 80 percent of the total cost of the Project including contingencies and interest charge\non  the  loan  during  construction.  The  terms  and  conditions  of  the  loan  will  be  ADB\u2019s  standard\nterms  and  conditions  for  loans  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  ADB  loan  will  have  a\nmaturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0 percent\nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  during  the  remaining  period.  The\nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  local  currency  cost.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Kyrgyz\n\n\f15\n\nRepublic. The Government has given its assurance that adequate local counterpart funds will be\nmade available from the State budget or other sources as necessary to enable the Project to be\nimplemented in a timely manner. In case of escalation of prices or required quantities covered\nby  contingencies,  the  increase  will  be  shared  by  the  Government  and  ADB  according  to  the\nfinancing percentages of the overall project cost, with ADB's share in the total cost limited to the\nmaximum  loan  amount.

The PSC will (i) oversee and coordinate all\nproject  activities,  including  liaison  among  the  consultants  and  the  agencies  involved  in  project\nimplementation and sector reforms, as agreed upon during policy dialogue with ADB; (ii) review\nthe status of the implementation of project components; (iii) monitor the progress achieved and\nresolve difficulties encountered; and (iv) serve as a forum for discussions on, and review of, the\nProject's  impact  on  poverty  reduction  and  economic  development.  The  PSC  is  chaired  by  the\nminister of MOTC. Its members include the project manager and representatives from the Prime\nMinister's  Office,  MOF,  and  MOTC.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  four  times  a  year,  and  more\noften if required.\n\n53.\nThe  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  presently  administering  ADB's  ongoing  road\nprojects  will  also  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  proposed  Project.  As  both  the  first  and\nsecond projects should be completed by the end of 2002, the PIU will have sufficient capacity to\nimplement  the  proposed  Project.  The  PIU,  assisted  by  the  international  and  domestic\nconsultants to be recruited for construction supervision, will undertake day\u2013to\u2013day supervision\nof  project  implementation  and  provide  the  necessary  liaison  among  MOTC,  contractors,\nsuppliers, and ADB. In particular, the PIU will be responsible for procuring goods and services,\nrecruiting consultants, making disbursements, and reporting.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n54.\nThe Project will be implemented in a little more than three years. Advance procurement\nactivities are expected to begin in September 2001, and construction completed by 31 October\n2004.  The  secondary  road  improvement  component  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  1.5\n\n\f16\n\nyears  during  the  last  two  years  of  the  Project.  The  proposed  implementation  schedule  is  in\nAppendix 7. This schedule is considered attainable as only a small section of the project road is\nin mountainous terrain and subject to severe winter weather limitations.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement\n\n55.\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. All contracts for civil works and contracts valued in excess\nof $500,000 for goods will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). Supply\ncontracts  not  exceeding  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  Civil  works\nfor  rehabilitating  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  the  secondary  roads  will  be  packaged  into  three\ncontracts  each.  All  six  civil  works  contracts  will  follow  ICB  procedures  to  encourage  the\nparticipation  of  international  competitors  and  joint  ventures  by  international  and  domestic\ncontractors. Supply contracts for the equipment will be grouped into three packages based on\nthe technical requirements. These packages will be finalized during project implementation. The\ntentative contract packages are listed in Appendix 8.\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n56.\nInternational consulting services totaling 51 person\u2013months will be provided for (person\u2013\nmonths  are  in  parentheses)  construction  supervision  (47)  and  project  impact  monitoring  and\nevaluation (4). The international consultants will give on\u2013the\u2013job training to the counterpart staff\nand  domestic  consultants.  In  association  with  the  international  consultant  inputs,  domestic\nconsulting  services  (300)  will  be  provided  for  construction  supervision,  contract  management,\nand  other  technical  advisory  assistance  (270);  as  well  as  for  assisting  the  international\nconsultants in monitoring the social and poverty impact of the Project through household survey\nand data analysis (30). The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic\nconsultants. The terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 9.\n\n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement and Recruitment Action\n\nDuring project processing, the Government requested ADB approval for advance action\n57.\nin  view  of  the  high  priority  the  Government  accords  to  the  Project  and  to  minimize\nimplementation  delays  and  ensure  timely  project  completion.  Advance  procurement  and\nrecruitment action was approved on 18 May 2001 and covers (i) prequalification of contractors,\ntendering,  and  bid  evaluation  for  the  civil  works  contract  packages;  and  (ii)  recruitment  of\ninternational consultants to help implement the Project. However, it does not include the signing\nof  contracts.  The  advance  action  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement  and  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The  Government  has  been  advised\nthat approval of the advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n\n6. \n\nMidterm Review\n\nADB  and  the  Government  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  project  implementation  in\n58.\n2003.  The  objectives  will  be  to  (i)  evaluate  the  Government's  progress  in  implementing  policy\nreforms;  (ii)  examine  project  implementation  and  determine  whether  any  adjustments  to  the\nscope and implementation arrangements are warranted; (iii) determine compliance with relevant\nstandards;  (iv)  address  any  potential  procurement,  financing,  and  scheduling  issues;  and  (v)\nexamine compliance with the loan covenants.\n\n\f17\n\n7. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n59.\nMOTC  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project\nimplementation. MOTC will maintain separate accounts for all project components financed by\nADB  and  the  Government  and  have  them  audited  by  an  independent  auditor,  acceptable  to\nADB, with adequate knowledge of and experience with international accounting practices. The\naudited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be submitted to ADB within nine months\nafter the end of each financial year. The Government has been informed of ADB\u2019s requirement\nof  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  including  the\nsuspension of disbursements in case of noncompliance. The auditing services may be financed\nthrough  the  loan  proceeds  as  part  of  project  management  costs  (Appendix  6).  To  facilitate\npostevaluation of the Project, the Government has agreed to submit a project completion report\nto ADB, within three months of physical completion of the Project.\n\n8. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nA  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  its\n60.\ngoals  and  purposes,  with  emphasis  on  poverty  reduction,  has  been  agreed  upon  with  MOTC\n(Appendix  10).  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  MOTC  will  establish  baseline  values  for\nsocial,  environmental,  and  poverty  reduction  impact  indicators.  Monitoring  indicators  will  be\nmeasured  at  the  necessary  frequency  during  project  implementation.  Comments  and  findings\nregarding these project indicators will be incorporated in every other quarterly report to ADB. In\naddition  to  indicators  for  monitoring  implementation,  indicators  for  project  evaluation  will  be\nmeasured at project completion and three years after completion. Where relevant, indicators will\nbe  disaggregated  by  gender.  Participatory  surveys  will  take  place,  and  the  results  will  be\ncompared with the baseline. A final report will evaluate the changes that occurred in the three\npreceding  years.  To  facilitate  assessment  of  the  socioeconomic  and  environmental  impact  of\nthe  Project,  an  international  consultant  will  be  recruited  to  monitor  and  evaluate  all  relevant\nproject impacts. The consultant will also work with MOTC to ensure the continued monitoring of\nthe first and second projects.\n\n9.\n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n61.\nThe  Mission  explained  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  to  the  officials  of  the  Government.\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  creating  and  sustaining  a  corruption\u2013free  environment,  and\nhas  agreed  to  abide  by  the  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  in  preparing  all\ndocuments and contracts during the bidding process and during project implementation.\n\n10.\n\nCapacity Building and Human Resource Development\n\nThe Project will build capacity and develop human resources within MOTC in the area of\n62.\nmaintenance of secondary roads. Under the advisory TA, consultants will develop a system for\nmaintaining  secondary  roads  and  will  conduct  workshops  on  the  system.  Subsequently,  the\nsupervision  consultants  will  give  training  and  other  assistance  to  the  LMUs  and  local\ncommunities to help implement the system.\n\n\f18\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects\n\nThe  Project  is  in  environmental  category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)\n63.\nwas  carried  out  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental\nAssessment  Requirements  and  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure\nDevelopment Projects.  The  IEE  indicated  that  the  Project  will  have  no  significant  adverse\nenvironmental impact and that an environmental impact assessment is not necessary because\nthe  Project  involves  mainly  rehabilitation  of  roads  on  the  existing  alignment  (except  for  minor\nrealignments  to  improve  road  safety)  and  requires  no  land  acquisition.  The  Summary  IEE\n(SIEE)  has  been  prepared  (Appendix  11).  The  Project  will  not  have  any  significant  negative\nimpact  on  the  two  protected  nature  areas  located  in  the  project  area.  Appropriate  mitigation\nmeasures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design  including  adequate  drainage  facilities,\nerosion prevention measures, and traffic management facilities. The consultants for construction\nsupervision will assist MOTC to supervise and monitor the (i) selection and restoration of borrow\nareas and quarries, (ii) extraction of water for construction, (iii) waste management, (iv) control\nof hazardous and toxic materials, and (v) prevention of impairment of downstream water quality.\nAll  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  recommended  in  the  IEE  will  be  implemented.  The\nrelevant mitigation costs are reflected in the project costs. The Government has agreed that the\nProject will be implemented following the environmental laws of the Kyrgyz Republic and ADB\u2019s\nenvironmental guidelines, as specified in the loan covenants (para. 80).\n\n2.\n\nSocial Issues\n\n64.\nThe  sections  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  to  be  rehabilitated  are  located  in  two  provinces\n(Jalal\u2013Abad  and  Osh)  and  directly  affect  six  districts  (Ak\u2013Syi,  Nooken,  Bazar  Korgon,  Suzak,\nUzgen,  and  Kara\u2013Suu)  and  four  cities  (Jalal\u2013Abad,  Tash  Kumyr,  Mayluu\u2013Suu,  and  Osh).  The\ndistricts and cities have a population of approximately 1.3 million inhabitants, of which about 73\npercent  are  living  in  poverty.  This  figure  is  much  higher  than  the  national  level  of  52  percent.\nThe unemployment rate is also high, and the annual per capita income is approximately $102\nequivalent,  substantially  lower  than  the  national  average  of  $124  equivalent.  Farming  and\nlivestock raising account for about one half of employment and about 40 percent of the country\u2019s\nGDP.  The  project  area  accounts  for  about  33  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  agricultural  output  and\nabout 29 percent of the industrial output.\n\nA social impact assessment was prepared, and a summary is attached as Appendix 12.\n65.\nThe  Project  will  exclude  bypasses  or  realignments  (except  for  minor  realignments  to  improve\nroad safety, which will not entail resettlement) or development of new alignments in previously\nundisturbed areas. No land will be acquired. No people will be involuntarily relocated; therefore,\nno  resettlement  action  plan  is  needed.  Ethnic  minorities  will  not  be  severely  or  adversely\naffected  by  the  Project  because  of  their  separate  cultural  identity.  The  overall  impact  of  the\nproject will be essentially gender neutral. Although women in construction works account for a\nvery small percentage of the overall labor employment, they will be given equal opportunity and\npay for construction and operation work during project implementation in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nPolicy on Gender and Development.\n\nFrom  the  conclusions  of  the  social  impact  assessment,  a  number  of  measures  were\n66.\nidentified  to  maximize  the  social  benefits  of  the  Project.  These  specific  measures  have  been\nincorporated  in  the  project  design:  (i)  enhancing  roadside  social  infrastructure,  including\n\n\f19\n\nrehabilitation  of  existing  bus  shelters  and  roadside  amenities  that  come  under  MOTC's\njurisdiction;  (ii)  constructing  pedestrian  walkways  and  improving  traffic  safety  installations  in\nvillages  through  which  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  passes;  and  (iii)  implementing  precautionary\nmeasures  against  socially  transmitted  diseases.  The  rehabilitation  works  will  also  generate  an\nestimated 903 person\u2013years of direct employment, including 624 person\u2013years (69 percent) for\nunskilled labor. It is expected that local residents will provide all the unskilled labor and part of\nthe skilled labor required. The Project will also stimulate the local construction materials industry\nthrough purchase of locally produced construction materials.\n\n67.\nProject impacts, particularly those relating to poverty reduction, social development, and\ngender  issues,  will  be  monitored  during  and  after  project  implementation.  The  monitoring\nsystem  will  specifically  focus  on  the  social  and  poverty  impact  of  road  rehabilitation  and\nimprovement  of  the  secondary  roads,  and  will  provide  quantitative  and  qualitative  analyses  of\nthe  income  levels  of  the  poor  and  the  distribution  of  project  benefits  to  them.  The  monitoring\nsystem  will  be  implemented  through  social  and  household  surveys,  public  consultation,  and\nparticipation  of  the  project  beneficiaries.  A  set  of  baseline  indicators  for  monitoring  the  project\nimpacts has been agreed upon with MOTC (para. 60).\n\nI.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nThe Government has requested ADB to provide an advisory TA focusing on institutional\n68.\ncapacity building to maintain secondary roads and for policy support focusing on the transport\nservices  markets.  The  TA  attached  to  the  Project  will  (i)  assist  the  Government  in  developing\nthe capacity for maintaining secondary roads using community maintenance techniques; and (ii)\ndevelop a set of specific measures for regulatory reforms to increase the competitiveness of the\nmarkets  for  transport  services.  These  measures  will  be  based  on  the  findings  of  the  Policy\nSupport for the Transport Sector TA (footnote 8) and will be consistent with the national strategy\nfor poverty reduction.\n\n69.\nThe  TA  will  require  17  person\u2013months  of  international  and  40  person\u2013months  of\ndomestic  consulting  services  with  expertise  in  road  maintenance  engineering,  financing,  and\ntraining; and also in economics of transport markets and transport sector policy reform. The total\ncost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $770,000  equivalent  including  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of\n$505,500  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $264,500  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested\nADB  to  provide  $650,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  local\ncurrency  cost  of  $144,500  equivalent.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local\ncurrency cost of $120,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the\nJapan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the\nconsultants and the cost estimates are in Appendix 13.\n\nimplementation  activities \n\nMOTC will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and will be responsible for the day\u2013to\u2013\n70.\nday \nliaison  and  coordination  with  other  concerned\nGovernment departments or agencies. The TA will be implemented in nine months starting from\nJuly 2002. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\n\nincluding \n\n\f20\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nEconomic analysis for the project road sections was carried out by comparing with\u2013 and\n71.\nwithout\u2013project  scenarios  (Appendix  14).  The  principal  sources  of  economic  benefits  for  the\nProject  are  the  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs),  time  savings,  benefits  arising  from\ngenerated traffic, and economic value added. VOC savings account for the bulk of total benefits\nand  arise  from  the  improved  road  surface  resulting  from  the  civil  works  carried  out  under  the\nProject. The VOCs are calculated for each vehicle type comprising traffic on the road sections.\nThe Project will also improve safety conditions and induce economic development by improving\naccess to and lowering the costs of transport to the principal domestic markets for agricultural\nand  industrial  goods  produced  in  the  project  area.  By  improving  secondary  roads,  the  Project\nwill improve the access of the poor to markets and health services. Improved access to markets\nwill generate economic value added in the form of increased agricultural production in the areas\nalong  the  secondary  roads.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is\nestimated  at  19.3  percent  and  the  net  present  value  at  $28.2  million.  The  Project  will  also\nbenefit road users in other countries of the region, for example, through reduced transport costs\nfor shipments of fresh produce from Uzbekistan to Russia. Since these benefits do not accrue to\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, they are not included in the EIRR. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to\ntest the effects of negative changes in the key parameters that determine the costs and benefits\nof  the  Project.  The  analysis  indicates  that  costs  would  have  to  increase  by  77  percent  or\nbenefits  decrease  by  43.5  percent  to  bring  the  EIRR  down  to  the  cutoff  level  of  12  percent.\nGiven MOTC's  experience with similar projects and the relatively straightforward nature of the\nrehabilitation works, such changes are unlikely to occur.\n\nB.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\nA poverty impact assessment comprising a detailed analysis of the poverty situation in\n72.\nthe  project  area  and  the  project  impact  on  poverty  was  prepared  (Appendix  15).  Using\nparticipatory  rapid  appraisal  techniques,  surveys  of  passengers,  drivers  of  freight  and\npassenger  vehicles,  households,  and  local  officials  were  conducted  in  the  six  districts  of  the\nproject  area.  Agriculture  is  the  primary  economic  activity  although  there  is  some  concentrated\nindustrial activity, primarily hydroelectric power stations and minerals extraction and processing.\nAgriculture,  including  harvesting  of  natural  resources,  is  also  the  primary  economic  activity\nalong  the  secondary  roads  included  in  the  Project,  with  some  tourism  and  mining  activity  in\nspcecific locations.\n\n73.\nBoth provinces comprising the project area have levels of per capita income lower than\nthe  national  average.  Poverty  incidence  in  Jalal\u2013Abad  is  substantially  above  the  national\naverage, while in Osh it is about the same as the national average. Poverty incidence in the six\ndistricts ranges from 46 percent to 95 percent, with poverty in five of the six above the national\nlevel  of  52  percent.  Poverty  incidence  in  the  four  cities  in  the  project  area  ranges  from  38\npercent  to  85  percent;  with  two  above  and  two  below  the  national  level.  Overall,  about  73\npercent (almost 1.0 million) of the approximately 1.3 million inhabitants in the project area are\nliving  in  poverty.  This  percentage  is  substantially  higher  than  the  national  average  of  52.\nApproximately  28  percent  of  the  project  area  inhabitants  are  classified  as  extremely  poor,\ncompared with 18 percent nationally. Surveys show that 73 percent of the passengers using the\nproject sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road are poor.\n\n\f21\n\nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  rehabilitating  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road,  improving\n74.\nsecondary  roads,  and  introducing  policy  and  regulatory  reforms.  VOCs  contribute  to  the  high\ntransport fares charged on the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and the project secondary roads. The largest\nsource  of  direct  economic  benefits  will  be  the  reduced  VOCs  on  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road.  The\nadvisory TA accompanying the Project will develop recommendations for regulatory reforms to\nincrease  competitiveness  of  the  markets  for  transport  services  and  ensure  that  the  VOC\nreductions  will  be  substantially  passed  on  to  the  road  users.  The  Government  has  agreed  to\nimplement the TA recommendations (para. 80).\n\n75.\nThe Project will improve secondary roads providing access from the Bishkek\u2013Osh road\nto adjacent areas with high incidence of poverty. Two secondary roads with a total length of 125\nkm  will  be  improved:  (i)  the  Tash  Kumyr\u2013Kara  Djigadz  road,  and  (ii)  the  Bazar  Korgon\u2013\nArslanbob  road  and  its  branch  to  Kyzyl  Ungkur.  The  secondary  roads  were  carefully  selected\nfrom  an  initial  group  of  approximately  2,000  km  through  an  evaluation  process  involving\nextensive  consultation  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  during  site  visits.  The  criteria  for\nselecting the secondary roads included (i) population density and number of settlements served\nby the roads, (ii) poverty incidence, (iii) economic potential, (iv) potential improvement of access\nto  social  services  and  employment  opportunities,  (v)  traffic  volume,  and  (vi)  environmental\nimpact. Improving these secondary roads will improve the poor inhabitants' access to markets\nfor  their  agricultural  produce,  employment  opportunities,  and  more  comprehensive  health\nfacilities.  Improved  access  to  markets  is  particularly  important  as  it  will  enable  farmers  to\nincrease agricultural production for sale in markets that require travel on the project roads.\n\n76.\nThe project design has specific measures to maximize the poverty reduction impact. To\nensure that the reduced VOC savings are passed on to the poor, the Project will increase the\ncompetitiveness  of  markets  for  transport  services  by  implementing  regulatory  reforms  to  be\nidentified  under  the  advisory  TA.  The  TA  will  also  recommend  measures  to  ensure  that  these\nreforms do not adversely affect the poorest segment of the population. The Project will support\nlocal procurement of goods and services as well as local employment generation for skilled and\nunskilled labor, and will ensure that local employees receive wages above the poverty level. The\nProject  will  also  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  poor  through  employment  generation.  The\nrehabilitation  works  will  generate  substantial  employment  for  local  labor  services  during  the\nimplementation period (para. 66). The Project will also stimulate the local construction materials\nindustry by locally procuring construction materials for the civil works.\n\n77.\nThe  Project  benefits  were  analyzed  to  determine  the  poverty  reduction  impact.  The\npoverty  impact  ratio  for  the  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  rehabilitated  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  and\nsecondary roads was calculated at 53 percent. However, due to the non\u2013specific nature of the\nbeneficiaries  and  the  inability  to  guarantee  that  the  Project's  benefits  will  be  passed  on  to  the\npoor, the Project's poverty classification is other with a thematic priority of economic growth.\n\nC.\n\nProject Risks\n\n78.\nThe risks to achieving the road rehabilitation targets include (i) delay in implementation,\n(ii)  inadequate  capacity  for  implementation  such  as  weak  technical  and  managerial  expertise,\n(iii)  poor  construction  quality,  (iv)  safety  risks  during  and  after  project  implementation,  and  (v)\ninadequate  provision  of  counterpart  funds.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  to  reduce  these\npotential  risks  through  use  of  advance  procurement  and  recruitment  action,  preparation  of\ndetailed  design  prior  to  project  inception,  use  of  ICB  procedures  for  all  contract  packages,\nmonitoring  and  testing  by  the  international  supervision  consultants,  and  policy  dialogue  to\nensure  the  provision  of  the  budget  allocations  required  for  project  implementation.  The\n\n\f22\n\nGovernment  has  agreed  that  MOTC  and  MIA  will  take  all  necessary  measures  to  ensure  the\nsafety of project workers and road users, including implementation of proper traffic management\nprocedures,  and  will  implement  in  a  timely  manner  all  agreed\u2013upon  recommendations  for\nmaintaining safety made by the contractor, supervision consultant, and ADB (para. 80).\n\n79.\nThe  poverty  reduction  aspects  of  the  Project  are  also  subject  to  risks:  (i)  savings  in\ntransport costs may not be passed on to the transport users, especially the poor; (ii) access to\ntransport services in poor areas may not improve; (iii) local labor may not be employed to the\nextent  anticipated;  and  (iv)  the  secondary  roads  may  not  be  properly  maintained.  The  project\ndesign  includes  measures  to  address  these  potential  risks.  The  advisory  TA  will  recommend\nspecific  measures  to  improve  the  competitiveness  of  markets  for  transport  services  to  ensure\nthat  savings  in  transport  costs  are  passed  on  to  the  users.  The  loan  covenants  require  that\nthese  measures  be  implemented.  The  TA  recommendations  will  also  include  measures  to\nstimulate  increased  frequency  of  transport  services  to  poor  areas,  especially  those  along  the\nsecondary roads. The consulting services under the Project will monitor the use of local labor by\ncontractors to ensure that it is used to the extent possible. The advisory TA will prepare a road\nmaintenance  system  based  on  collaboration  between  the  LMUs  and  local  communities.  The\nloan covenants will require implementation of this system on the secondary roads rehabilitated\nby the Project.\n\nII. \n80.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nProject  counterpart  funding.  The  Government  will  provide  all  funds  and\nresources necessary for rehabilitating, operating and maintaining, and managing\nthe  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  the  secondary  roads  included  in  the  Project.  Before\n31  December  of  each  year  of  implementation,  the  Government  will  submit  to\nADB a copy of the PIP for the succeeding year to confirm that these funds and\nresources will be available on a timely basis so that the Project can be completed\naccording  to  schedule.  The  Government  will  cause  MOF  to  take  all  necessary\nmeasures to ensure that MOTC can successfully implement the rehabilitation of\nthe project roads, and operate and maintain them after completion.\n\nProject  implementation  unit.  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  the  PIU  for  the\nongoing  ADB  road  rehabilitation  projects  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  will  be\nresponsible  for  the  day\u2013to\u2013day  implementation  of  the  Project  and  provide  the\nnecessary contact between MOTC, the contractors, the suppliers, and ADB. The\nPIU will be headed by a project manager appointed by MOTC and approved by\nthe\nADB  and  will \nimplementation period.\n\nremain  adequately  staffed  at  all \n\nthroughout \n\ntimes \n\nConstruction  quality.  MOTC  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  project  roads  are\nrehabilitated in accordance with the technical specifications; and (b) construction\nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are  in  accordance  with\ninternationally accepted standards.\n\nFinancing the maintenance of the road network. MOF will establish, no later\nthan  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness,  a  special  account  for  road  fund  revenues\nwithin  the  treasury.  MOF  will  also  establish  a  separate  budget  item  for\n\n\f23\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nmaintaining  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  Road  and  will  allocate  Som35  million  in  2001,\nSom40  million  in  2002,  and  increase  allocations  by  Som20  million  per  year  to\nreach Som100 million by 2005. For all other roads under MOTC administration,\nMOF will allocate Som162 million in 2001 and increase allocations by 10 percent\nper  year  to  reach  Som237  million  in  2005.  MOF  will  adjust  these  allocations  to\ncompensate  for  the  effects  of  inflation  and  depreciation  of  the  som  against  the\ndollar.  The  Government  will  (a)  ensure  that  details  of  actual  road  maintenance\nexpenditures  are  included  in  every  other  quarterly  progress  report  to  be\nsubmitted by MOTC to ADB; (b) have the road maintenance expenditures as well\nas  the  road  fund  special  account  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  in\naccordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards;  and  (c)  submit  such  audited\nreports to ADB within nine months from the end of the fiscal year.\n\nBishkek\u2013Osh  road  maintenance  practices. By  project  completion,  MOTC  will\ninvite bids from contractors, regardless of ownership, for routine maintenance on\nall sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, including sections rehabilitated under other\nprojects, for which the warranty periods have expired.\n\nSecondary road maintenance practices. Within three months of submission of\nthe  final  report  of  the  advisory  TA,  MOTC  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a\ndetailed  action  plan  for  implementing  the  secondary  road  maintenance  system\n(featuring  collaboration  between  the  LMUs  and  local  communities)  developed\nunder  the  advisory  TA.  The  maintenance  system  for  secondary  roads  will  be\nready for operation by the LMUs assigned to these roads by the time civil works\nfor  these  roads  are  completed.  The  Government  will  ensure  active  participation\nof  the  project  beneficiaries  in  maintaining  the  rehabilitated  secondary  roads  by\nproviding  necessary  resources  and  equipment  and  enacting  or  modifying  any\nnecessary  regulations.  The  supervision  consultants  will  prepare  the  list  of\nequipment  to  be  procured  by  the  Government  for  maintaining  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh\nroad and secondary roads, and MOTC will submit it to ADB for approval by June\n2003.  MOTC  will  thus  ensure  that  the  secondary  roads  rehabilitated  under  the\nProject will be maintained as specified\u2014using the collaborative system\u2013after the\nwarranty period expires.\n\n(vii)  Competitiveness  of  the  markets  for  transport  services.  To  improve  the\ncompetitiveness  of  the  markets  for  transport  services  and  to  ensure  that  the\nproject  benefits  are  passed  on  to  the  poor,  the  Government  will  implement  the\nregulatory changes agreed upon with ADB and recommended by the advisory TA\nassociated with the Project. Within three months from the submission of the final\nTA report, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a detailed action plan\nfor implementing the recommendations to ensure implementation of a substantial\npart of the recommendations by June 2004 and completion of implementation by\nthe end of 2004.\n\n(viii)  MOTC  financial  organization  reforms.  MOTC  will  (a)  appoint  a  chief  financial\nofficer  for  MOTC  to  direct  financial  management  and  planning  functions  by  1\nJanuary 2002, (b) integrate the financial planning and management functions of\nMOTC  and  the  RRMAs  by  1  January  2002,  and  (c)  begin  implementing\ninternational  accounting  standards  (of  the  International  Accounting  Standards\nCommittee or equivalent acceptable to ADB) in MOTC, its branches, and entities\ninvolved in project implementation by 1 January 2004.\n\n\f24\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nfacilities,  hazard  barriers,  and \n\nRoad  safety.  To  ensure  a  safe  road  network  in  the  project  area,  MOTC  will\ninstall  appropriate  road  safety  facilities  during  project  implementation  and  after\ncompletion:  pavement  markings,  warning  signs,  traffic  signs  and  signals,\ntraffic  management  and\ncommunications \nmonitoring facilities. The Government will cause MOTC and the State Automobile\nInspection  of  MIA  to  take  all  necessary  measures,  including  implementation  of\nproper  traffic  management  procedures,  during  project  implementation  to  ensure\nthe  safety  of  project  workers  and  road  users.  The  Government  will  ensure  that\nrecommendations  for  maintaining  road  safety  made  by  the  contractor,  the\nsupervision  consultant  or  ADB,  and  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,\nwill be implemented in accordance with the agreed timeframe.\n\nEnvironment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  road  rehabilitation  and\nmaintenance  works  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  laws\nand regulations of the Kyrgyz Republic and ADB\u2019s environmental procedures and\nguidelines,  in  particular,  Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure\nDevelopment Projects. The Government will ensure that adequate environmental\nmitigation measures are implemented by requiring that all contracts related to the\nrehabilitation  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  the  secondary  roads  contain\nadequate  provisions  requiring  the  contractor  to  (a)  take  appropriate  erosion\ncontrol measures; (b) minimize any adverse impact due to altered embankments,\nborrow  pits,  and  other  activities  as  set  out  in  the  SIEE;  (c)  adopt  appropriate\nsafety  measures  to  minimize  risks  of  landslides,  soil  subsidence,  and  related\noccurrences;  and  (d)  keep  construction  materials  and  facilities,  such  as  asphalt\nand  hot\u2013mix  plants,  at  least  500  m  away  from  schools,  hospitals,  and  other\nsensitive facilities. The Government will ensure that (a) MOTC and the Ministry of\nEcology  and  Emergency  Situations  jointly  inspect  on  a  regular  basis  the\nenvironmental  aspects  of  the  Project,  including  erosion  control,  and  include  the\nresults of the inspections in the project quarterly reports submitted by MOTC to\nADB;  and  (b)  the  contractors  implement  the  mitigation  measures  in  accordance\nwith the SIEE.\n\n(xi) \n\nPoverty  reduction.  The  Government  will  encourage  the  use  of  local  labor  in\nproject  works  and  procurement  of  local  materials,  and  will  ensure  that  local\nlaborers employed under the Project receive wages above the poverty line.\n\n(xii)  Gender  and  development.  MOTC  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and\nDevelopment  during  project implementation and will adopt measures necessary\nto  encourage  women  to  participate  in  project  implementation  activities.  MOTC\nwill monitor effects on women through the monitoring and evaluation system, in\nconsultation with local governments and local women's associations.\n\n(xiii)  Health  risks.  MOTC,  together  with  the  appropriate  authorities,  will  ensure  that\ncontractors  disseminate  to  those  employed  during  project  implementation\ninformation in the Russian language on the risks of socially transmitted diseases.\nMOTC  will  also  ensure  that  similar  information  in  the  Russian  language  is\ndisseminated to transport operators using the project facilities.\n\n(xiv)  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  MOTC,  with  the  assistance  of  the  international\nconsultants, will monitor and evaluate project impacts to ensure that the project\n\n\f25\n\nfacilities  are  managed  effectively,  and  that  the  benefits  are  maximized.  MOTC\nwill collect the data agreed upon with ADB at the start of rehabilitation, at project\ncompletion,  one  year  from  project  completion,  and  three  years  after  project\ncompletion.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n81.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the\nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various\ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 31,778,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Third\nRoad  Rehabilitation  Project,  with  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and\nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5\npercent  per  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\nMYOUNG\u2013HO SHIN\nVice President\n\n7 September 2001\n\n\f26\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nProject Framework\n\nTransport Sector Trends\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3. \n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\n15.\n\nOrganization Chart of the Ministry of Transport and \nCommunications\n\nRoad Sector Reform Program\n\nTraffic Forecast\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nContract Packages\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services \nfor Project Implementation\n\nProposed Indicators for Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nSummary Social Impact Assessment\n\nTechnical Assistance for\nInstitutional Support in the Transport  Sector\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nSummary Poverty Impact Assessment\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n27\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n45\n\n47\n\n54\n\n59\n\n63\n\n67\n\n1, 2\n\n1, 3\n\n2, 5\n\n9, 32\n\n13, 47\n\n14, 49\n\n16, 54\n\n16, 55\n\n16, 56\n\n17, 60\n\n18, 63\n\n18, 65\n\n19, 69\n\n20, 71\n\n20, 72\n\n\f27\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nDesign Summary\n\nMonitoring Mechanism\n\nPerformance\nIndicators/Targets\n\nRisks and\nAssumptions\n\nA.

Traffic\ncomprises  seven  vehicle  types:  cars,  pickups,  buses,  and  four  types  of  trucks.  Cars  are  the\nmajority accounting for 50 percent on the km 427\u2013498 section and 69 percent on the Uzgen\u2013\nOsh section.\n\n2.\nTraffic  forecasts  by  vehicle  type  were  prepared  for  the  project  road  sections  for  2001\u2013\n2024 (Table A5). The forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP)\nand  population,  and  on  income  elasticities  of  demand  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic.  The\npopulation is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 1.7 percent per year during the\nproject  period.  GDP  is  forecast  to  grow  at  annual  rates  of  4.5  percent  through  2005,  and  5.0\npercent thereafter. The values of income elasticity of demand used for passenger traffic are 1.5\nduring 2001\u20132005, 1.4 during 2006\u20132010, and 1.3 for the remaining project period. For freight\ntraffic,  the  values  used  are  1.5  during  2001\u20132005,  1.3  during  2006\u20132010,  and  1.2  during  the\nremaining project period.\n\n3.\nThe  average  annual  growth  rates  for  passenger  traffic  are  6.8  percent  during  2001\u2013\n2005,  7.0  percent  during  2006\u20132010,  and  6.5  percent  for  the  remaining  project  period.  For\nfreight traffic, the average annual growth rates are 6.8 percent during 2001\u20132005, 6.5 percent\nduring  2006\u20132010,  and  6.0  percent  for  the  remaining  project  period.  Traffic  levels  on  the  km\n427\u2013498  section  are  forecast  to  increase  to  an  AADT  of  about  5,300  in  2024,  while  AADT  on\nthe Uzgen\u2013Osh section will increase to almost 21,000 by 2024. Generated traffic resulting from\nlower  transport  costs  comprises  approximately  10  percent  of  total  traffic.  International  transit\ntraffic is forecast to comprise approximately 5 percent of total traffic.\n\nTable A5: Traffic Forecast for the Project\n(Average Annual Daily Traffic)\n\nRoad Section\nand Year\n\nCar\n\nPickup\n\nBus\n\nLight\nTruck\n\nMedium Heavy Articulated\nTruck\n\nTruck\n\nTruck\n\nTotal\n\nKm 427-498\n2001\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2024\n\nUzgen-Osh\n2001\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2024\n\n        663\n        644\n        926\n     1,290\n     1,788\n     2,316\n\n     3,169\n     3,968\n     5,692\n     7,917\n  10,964\n  14,195\n\n     146\n     201\n     288\n     400\n     554\n     716\n\n47\n85\n123\n170\n233\n301\n\n     509\n     649\n     931\n 1,294\n 1,793\n 2,321\n\n277\n380\n544\n756\n   1,046\n   1,353\n\n20\n30\n30\n40\n54\n68\n\n46\n76\n76\n103\n139\n177\n\n60\n80\n111\n150\n203\n258\n\n139\n188\n263\n357\n482\n612\n\n312\n414\n579\n785\n1,062\n1,348\n\n333\n447\n626\n848\n1,146\n1,455\n\n80\n103\n145\n197\n266\n338\n\n153\n195\n272\n368\n498\n634\n\n    1,328\n    1,557\n    2,202\n    3,032\n    4,160\n    5,345\n\n    4,626\n    5,903\n    8,404\n  11,643\n  16,068\n  20,747\n\n1 TA 3335-KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($ million)\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n \nForeign\nExchange\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\nGovernment\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n \nItem\n\nA.

the\n1.\ninformation  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE).  The  IEE  was  prepared  under  the\nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  TA  3335\u2013KGZ1  in  accordance  with  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB\u2019s)  Environmental Assessment Requirements  and  Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects.  The  IEE  was  prepared  in  four\nsteps:  (i)  secondary  data  and  reports  on  relevant  previous  projects  were  analyzed,  and\ndiscussions  were  held  with  the  representatives  of  the  local  environmental  authorities,  road\nmaintenance  units,  and  road  design  organizations;  (ii)  field  investigations  were  conducted  to\ncollect  data  for  the  Project;  (iii)  the  data  were  reviewed  and  possible  environmental  impacts\nwere analyzed; and (iv) mitigation measures were designed to minimize adverse effects during\nand  after  construction.  Additional  information  was  obtained  through  a  series  of  meetings  with\ndomestic  specialists,  local  authorities  and  road  maintenance  units,  and  site  inspection  during\nthe fact\u2013finding mission.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\nThe Project will rehabilitate about 120 kilometers (km) of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and 125\n2.\nkm of secondary roads feeding into the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. The first 30 km of the km 427\u2013498\nsection  pass  through  steep  slopes  along  the  Naryn  River  and  are  prone  to  landslides,  flash\nfloods, and severe erosion. Many of the existing culverts on this section are too small to ensure\nsufficient drainage and become clogged during heavy rains. The works for the first 30 km of the\nkm  427\u2013498  section  include  rehabilitating  the  pavement  structures  (base  course  and\npavement),  improving  the  drainage  structures,  repairing  damaged  culverts  and  bridges,  and\nconstructing  protective  structures  against  rockfalls,  landslides,  and  erosion.  The  works  on  the\nrest of the section consist of rehabilitating the pavement and repairing drainage structures. On\nthe  Uzgen\u2013Osh  section,  similar  pavement  rehabilitation  and  drainage  repair  works  will  be\nconstructed.  In  addition,  as  the  Uzgen\u2013Osh  section  passes  through  villages,  pedestrian\nwalkways will be added and traffic safety installations will be improved.\n\n3.\nThe two secondary roads will be rehabilitated to different standards appropriate to each\nroad section. On the Tash Kumyr\u2013Kara Djigadz road, the existing bituminous pavement of the\nfirst  15  km  will  be  repaired.  The  works  on  the  km  15\u201353  section  of  this  road  will  comprise\nbuilding  a  proper  embankment  and  constructing  a  bituminous  gravel  pavement.  The  Bazar\nKorgon\u2013Arslanbob road (52 km) and its branch to Kyzyl Ungkur (20 km) will be rehabilitated by\nrepairing  the  bituminous  pavement  of  the  first  10  km  and  laying  a  gravel  surface  on  the\nremainder  of  the  road  to  Arslanbob,  with  improvements  to  the  earth  road  and  bridge  on  the\nbranch  to  Kyzyl  Ungkur.  In  addition,  damaged  culverts  and  bridges  along  this  road  will  be\nrepaired or rebuilt.\n\n1 TA  3335\u2013KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nProject Area\n\nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  extremely  mountainous  and  contains  some  of  the  highest  and\n4.\nmost  dramatic  parts  of  the  Tien  Shan  and  Pamir  Alay  Ranges.  Its  average  elevation  is\napproximately 2,750 meters (m). The project area covers km 427\u2013498 and the section Uzgen\u2013\nOsh of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road with the Tash Kumyr\u2013Kara Djigadz and Bazar Korgon\u2013Arslanbob\nsecondary roads. From km 427 to km 457, the road follows the Naryn River that descends from\nthe Toktogul reservoir toward the Fergana valley. Up to km 436 the road is carved in the steep\nand high slope above the reservoir near Tash Kumyr. In that section the road is subject to rock\nand  mud  slides  and  prone  to  erosion.  Due  to  inadequate  drainage  structures  (too  small\nculverts), the road embankment has been eroded up to km 457. The rest of the road runs over\nthe rolling foothills surrounding the Fergana valley. The secondary roads lead from Tash Kumyr\nand  Bazar  Korgon  to  the  mountain  villages  Kara  Djigadz  and  Arslanbob,  which  are  popular\nrecreational areas during the summer months. Tash Kumyr is a mining town with a coal mine,\nwhich  is  presently  working  at  only  minimum  capacity.  Investigations  are  under  way  to  find\ndeposits of gold and other precious metals.\n\n5.\nSoil  erosion  is  a  major  environmental  concern  throughout  the  country  due  to  seismic\nactivity,  steep  slopes,  fragile  soils,  and  human  activities.  Soil  disturbance  activities  must  also\ntake  into  account  the  fact  that  old  biologically  active  disposal  sites  used  for  anthrax\u2013infected\nanimals may be unearthed during construction. Approximately 700 such sites are registered and\nmost  are  believed  to  be  adjacent  to  the  international  trade  roads,  including  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh\nroad.\n\n6.\nThe  potentially  affected  environment  is  defined  as  an  area  approximately  10  km  on\neither  side  of  the  project  roads,  with  appropriate  adjustments  for  intervening  mountainous\nconditions,  international  boundaries,  and  similar  constraints,  and  with  due  consideration  of\npotential  environmental  effects  at  greater  distances  (downstream  hydrological  effects,  for\nexample). Pursuant to the ADB guidelines, the potentially affected environment is described in\nterms  of  its  physical,  biological,  and  human  resources;  economic  development;  and  quality  of\nlife characteristics.\n\n2. \n\nProtected Nature Areas\n\nThe  two  protected  nature  areas  in  the  project  area  are  the  Sary  Chelek  Strict  Nature\n7.\nPreserve  and  the  Dashman  Forest  Protected  Area.  They  are  in  the  area  defined  by  the\nsecondary roads, but remain some distance from the sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road being\nrehabilitated. The protected areas are under the administrative oversight of the Department of\nProtected  Areas  within  the  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Emergency  Situations,  although  the\nDepartment  is  reported  to  have  little  actual  authority  over  the  areas  compared  to  the  regional\nauthorities through which the budgets are channeled.\n\n8.\nThe Sary Chelek Strict Nature Preserve is in the most highly protected class of protected\nnature areas in the Kyrgyz Republic. Sary Chelek is 60 km from Tash Kumyr (and the Bishkek\u2013\nOsh  road  sections  being  rehabilitated)  and  30  km  from  the  closest  point  of  the  Tash  Kumyr\u2013\nKara Djigadz secondary road. The preserve covers 23,868 hectares (ha), of which a section of\n18,080  ha  is  considered  core  area,  and  consists  primarily  of  alpine  forest.  Some  endangered\nspecies of flora and fauna are reported to inhabit the preserve. While there is not much tourism\nin  the  preserve  at  present,  in  the  1980s  as  many  as  10,000  tourists  visited  Sary  Chelek\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nannually. The village of Arkyt is located within the boundaries, and the population of 850 carry\nout economic activities such as grazing their animals within the preserve.\n\n9.\nThe Dashman Forest Protected Area is in the least protected class of protected nature\nareas  in  the  country,  specifically,  a  protected  area  in  which  limited  economic  activity  is\npermitted. The Dashman forest is about 35 km from the sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road being\nrehabilitated  and  3  km  from  the  Arslanbob  end  of  the  Bazar  Korgan\u2013Arslanbob\u2013Kyzyl  Ungkur\nsecondary  road.  The  only  road  connection  to  the  forest  from  that  point  is  almost  completely\neroded.  The  Dashman  forest  covers  3,095  ha  and  comprises  primarily  a  walnut  forest  (70\npercent)  with  apple  (20  percent)  and  other  trees.  Sustainable  economic  activities  are  allowed\nwithin  the  forest,  including  raising  of  sunflowers  by  185  landless  people  from  nearby  villages\nwho lease the land.  More than 500  people from nearby villages have smallholdings within the\nforest and are allowed to collect walnuts during one month every year. Very few tourists visit the\nforest.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Problems Due to Project Location\n\n10.\nNo impacts on archaeological and historic resources; no significant adverse impacts on\nsettlement patterns, provinces, and communities; and no significant adverse impacts to aquatic\nor terrestrial ecosystems are anticipated. Little or no agricultural displacement will occur. Access\nto markets will be enhanced. Construction materials except special ones such as cable strands,\nadmixtures,  etc.,  will  be  obtained  in  and  around  the  project  area.  Embankment  soil,  fine\naggregates, coarse aggregates, and cement sources are available in or near the project area.\nThe Project will have an impact on the mineral and building material resources of the area by\nincreasing  the  rate  at  which  these  resources  are  consumed,  but  is  unlikely  to  cause  or\ncontribute significantly to their depletion. The area's potential for economic development will be\nenhanced. No adverse socioeconomic impacts on employment and income trends, or on ethnic\nminorities  within  the  area  are  foreseen.  The  Project  is  expected  to  enhance  commercial\nactivities adjacent to the existing roadways.\n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impact on Protected Nature Areas\n\n11.\nThe  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  direct  impact  on  either  the  Sary  Chelek  Strict\nNature  Preserve  or  the  Dashman  Forest  Protected  Area,  although  some  indirect  impacts  are\nexpected.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  Tash  Kumyr\u2013Kara  Djigadz  secondary  road  may  lead  to\nincreased  tourism  in  the  Sary  Chelek  Preserve;  however,  any  increases  are  expected  to  be\nminor  as  approximately  30  km  of  unimproved  road  lies  between  the  secondary  road  and  the\npreserve.  Any  increases  in  tourism  are  expected  to  be  within  the  environmental  management\ncapacity  of  the  preserve\u2019s  administration,  as  the  tourism  levels  would  still  remain  well  below\nthose during the 1980s. The risk of increased exploitation is expected to be minor as well, due\nto the 30 km of unimproved road, and to be within the management capacity of the preserve\u2019s\nadministration.\n\n12.\nAs  for  the  Dashman  Forest  Protected  Area,  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Bazar  Korgon\u2013\nArslanbob\u2013Kyzyl  Ungkur  secondary  road  raises  issues  of  increased  tourism,  additional\nexploitation of timber, and conversion to other uses. Any increase in tourism is expected to be\nvery  small,  as  the  forest  has  never  been  a  major  tourist  destination  and  the  road  linking  the\nsecondary  road  to  the  forest  is  in  a  very  bad  condition.  There  may  be  some  risk  of  additional\nexploitation  of  timber;  however,  the  very  poor  condition  of  the  road  link  from  the  end  of  the\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nproject  road  to  the  forest  may  be  a  deterrent.  The  Government  is  aware  of  this  issue,  and  in\nrecognition  of  the  exploitation  in  Dashman  and  other  areas,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  parliament\nenacted  in  December  2000  a  resolution  proposing  the  suspension  of  walnut  timber  extraction\nuntil effective measures can be taken to control exports. The pressure to convert forestlands to\nother uses, e.g., agriculture, is also an issue at Dashman; however, the Project is not expected\nto  increase  this  pressure  and  may  in  fact  alleviate  it  by  improving  access  to  other  economic\nopportunities.\n\n3.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Associated with Construction\n\n13.\nDetours and traffic inconveniences will occur during construction. After construction, the\nprimary transport impact of the Project will be to improve the performance of the transport sector\nand  greatly  facilitate  the  flow  of  traffic,  goods,  and  travelers.  Care  will  be  taken  during\nconstruction to minimize traffic disruptions. No mitigating actions related to transport, other than\nthose actions already incorporated in the Project, are considered warranted.\n\nTopographic and soil impacts could occur due to altered road embankments, borrow pit\n14.\nexcavations,  and  quarry  operations.  No  significant  cut\u2013and\u2013fill  operations  are  anticipated.  No\nlong\u2013term  impacts  to  the  area's  soils  due  to  increased  pollutant  levels  are  anticipated.  No\nsignificant changes in hydrological characteristics are likely and no significant adverse impacts\nto surface hydrology, wetlands, groundwater characteristics, or flood/inundation characteristics\nare anticipated. Air quality impacts could occur in both the construction and operational phases,\nbut  no  significant  violations  of  standards  are  anticipated  in  light  of  the  contractual  provisions\nnoted in para. 26.\n\n15.\nThe  feasibility  study  recommends  that  contracts  include  provisions  to  mitigate  adverse\nimpacts  due  to  altered  road  embankments,  borrow  pits,  and  provisions  for  quarry  operations.\nThe  Project  will  install  drainage  facilities  of  adequate  size  to  accommodate  foreseeable  flood\nlevels and will stabilize downstream slopes with concrete, or rock gabions, or walls to prevent\nerosion.  Contracts  will  require  asphalt  and  hot\u2013mix  plants  to  be  located  at  least  500  m  away\nfrom  the nearest sensitive  receptor  (e.g., schools and hospitals). Operators will be required to\ninstall emission controls. Blasting will be carried out using carefully designed charges, and dust\u2013\ngenerating  items  will  be  conveyed  under  cover.  Road  surfaces,  excavation  areas,  and\nconstruction  sites  will  be  sprayed  with  water  to  control  dust.  Trucks  carrying  earth,  sand,  or\nstone  will  be  covered  with  tarps  to  prevent  spilling.  Contracts  will  require  preconstruction  and\nroutine air quality monitoring.\n\n16. Worker camps could constitute a temporary land use change and raise issues related to\nthe  maintenance  of  healthy  living  conditions  and  control  of  off\u2013site  impacts,  hazardous  traffic\nflows at construction sites, disposal of human and construction waste, and similar issues.\n\n17.\nThe feasibility study recommends that contracts require construction operators to attend\nto  the  health  and  safety  of  their  workers,  maintain  and  clean  up  campsites,  and  respect  the\nrights  of  local  landowners.  For  land  located  outside  the  right\u2013of\u2013way  (ROW),  written\nagreements  with  local  landowners  for  temporary  property  use  will  specify  that  sites  will  be\nrestored to an acceptable level within a predetermined period.\n\nHuman  health  risks  associated  with  road  projects  typically  involve  issues  such  as\n18.\ntransmission of diseases along previously undeveloped corridors. In this instance, however, the\nProject involves only existing ROWs and will not open any additional corridors. Contamination\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nof local water supplies, air and noise pollution, and issues related to road safety and accidents\nare often associated with road projects. The improved road conditions could lead to increased\nspeeds and more severe accidents.\n\nThe  proposed  contract  specifications  will  prevent  contamination  of  local  water  supplies\n19.\nand  will  control  air  and  noise  pollution.  Road  safety  will  be  enhanced  as  a  result  of  the  road\nimprovements, improved signage, and other features incorporated in the Project. The possibility\nof  higher  accident  rates  will  require  greater  enforcement  of  traffic  controls  and  placement  of\nappropriate devices such as speed bumps and traffic lights.\n\n20.\nTemporary  noise  impacts  in  the  immediate  vicinity  may  occur  due  to  construction.\nImpacts  to  sensitive  receptors  during  the  operational  phase  of  the  Project  are  expected  to  be\nminimal.  Noise  impacts  during  the  construction  phase  will  be  mitigated  through  the  use  of\nsource  controls,  site  controls,  time  and  activity  constraints,  community  awareness  initiatives,\nand related activities.\n\n4.\n\nEnvironmental Problems Due to Project Operations\n\n21.\nThe Project will have no direct impact on area water supply systems, raw water supplies,\narea  sewerage  systems,  energy  systems,  or  waste  disposal.  Coordination  with  concerned\nofficials and agencies is required. The Project will enhance access to recreational areas within\nthe potentially affected areas, but will have no adverse impacts on such resources.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Transportation  and  Communications  (MOTC)  will  ensure \n\n22.\nenvironmental procedures are incorporated at each stage of the work, specifically:\n\nthat\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv) \n\npreparation of tender documents and contracts,\nbid reviews and awards,\nsupervision of preconstruction baseline monitoring, and\nconstruction supervision.\n\nMOTC  will  also  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  following  laws  of  the  Kyrgyz\n\n23.\nRepublic are complied with:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n(vi)\n(vii)\n(viii) \n\nLaw on Environmental Protection,\nLaw on Environmental Expertise (Environmental Assessment),\nLaw on Specially Protected Nature Territories,\nLaw on Animal World,\nLaw on Atmosphere Protection,\nForest Code,\nLaw on Highways, and\nLaw on Protection and Usage of Historical and Cultural Heritage.\n\nThe  feasibility  study  includes  a  recommendation  for  an  environment/social  officer  for\n\n24.\neach rehabilitation package to ensure that environmental contract provisions are enforced.\n\n25.\nThe  environmental  monitoring  program  incorporated  in  the  project  recommendations\nincludes  routine  site  inspection  and  reporting  related  to  soil  and  erosion  control,  embankment\nand erosion protection, borrow pit restoration, and water quality monitoring (including baseline\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 11, page 6\n\nand routine periodic water quality monitoring).\n\nF.\n\nFindings and recommendations\n\n1. \n\nRecommended Contract Provisions\n\nIt is recommended that specific environmental provisions related to the following topics\n\n26.\nbe included in the contract documents:\n\nembankments and erosion prevention measures;\nborrow pit restoration;\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)  mining/quarry activities;\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nsiting of construction camps and related facilities;\nsiting of asphalt plants;\nbaseline and routine periodic air quality monitoring;\nother  air  quality  provisions:  open  burning  is  prohibited;  use  of  solvents  and\nvolatile  materials  will  be  approved  by  the  project\u2019s  construction  supervision\nconsultants  (CSC);  blasting  will  be  carried  out  using  controlled  charges;  dust\u2013\ngenerating  items  will  be  conveyed  under  cover;  road  surfaces,  excavation  and\nconstruction sites will be sprayed with water to control dust if deemed advisable\nby the CSC; and trucks carrying earth, sand, or stone will be covered with tarps\nto avoid spilling;\nbaseline and routine periodic water quality monitoring;\nbaseline and routine periodic noise monitoring;\nother  noise\u2013related  provisions:  source  controls,  time\u2013of\u2013day  restrictions,  time\nand activity constraints, and community awareness activities;\nsafety  provisions:  provisions  for  detours  and  traffic  interruptions,  blasting\nprocedures,  and  emergency  response  procedures  in  the  event  of  accidents  or\nnatural disasters; and\ncommunity relations.\n\n2.

The transition to a market economy following the\ncollapse  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  has  seen  increasing  levels  of  poverty,  increased\nunemployment,  and  decreased  access  to  social  services.  Most  recently  the  financial  crisis  in\nRussia in 1998 brought even greater increases in poverty levels and worsened the living standards\nof the population.\n\n2.\nThe Bishkek\u2013Osh road in the southwestern part of the country links the two most important\ncities and economic centers. The Project will rehabilitate sections of the road from Bishkek to Osh\nand improve two secondary roads connecting poor villages to the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. Although the\nProject will affect much of the country directly or indirectly, the project roads are limited to Jalal\u2013\nAbad and Osh provinces. In Jalal\u2013Abad, four districts and three cities will be directly affected. The\ndistricts  are  Bazar  Korgon,  Ak\u2013Syi,  Nooken,  and  Suzak,  and  the  cities  are  Jalal\u2013Abad,  Tash\nKumyr,  and  Mayluu\u2013Suu.  In  Osh,  two  districts  (Kara  Suu  and  Uzgen)  and  one  city  (Osh)  will  be\ndirectly  affected.  The  Project  will  directly  affect  27  percent  of  the  total  population,  or  about  1.3\nmillion out of 4.9 million people.\n\nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Characteristics of the Country and the Project Area\n\n1.\n\nThe Economy\n\n3.\nEven  before  the  breakup  of  the  FSU,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  was  one  of  the  poorest  of  the\nFSU  republics.    Following  independence,  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  declined  by  over  50\npercent in a very short time. While some economic growth resumed in 1996\u20131997, the country was\nagain  set  back  by  the  region\u2019s  financial  crisis  in  1998.  The  GDP  growth  rate  has  gradually\nincreased since then, however, and reached 5.0 percent in 2000. Economic activity is curtailed by\nUzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  closing  their  borders  at  times,  and  by  Kazakhstan  imposing  trade\nbarriers on Kyrgyz exports.\n\n4.\nMost  residents  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  derive  their  livelihoods  from  the  agriculture  and\nforestry  sector.  Agriculture  and  forestry  accounted  for  more  than  51  percent  of  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic\u2019s employment in 1999, a figure that increased from about 47 percent in 1995. During the\nsame  period,  the  sector\u2019s  percentage  of  contribution  to  GDP  varied  considerably,  ranging  from  a\nhigh of 46.2 in 1996 to a low of 35.9 in 1998. Employment in the industry sector, which stood at\nmore than 33 percent of total employment in 1993, fell to 17 percent in 1996.  Since that time it has\nrebounded to a 1999 level of more than 22 percent of total employment.\n\n5.\nJalal\u2013Abad  province  occupies  approximately  17  percent  of  the  country,  has  a  population\ndensity  of  26  persons/km2,  and  comprises  approximately  18  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  population.\nJalal\u2013Abad is part of the Fergana valley with a long history of agricultural productivity. The province\nhas significant industries, including the largest hydroelectric stations in the country and nearly all of\nthe  oil  and  gas  extraction  and  oil  processing  enterprises.  The  area  is  subject  to  frequent  natural\ndisasters,  particularly  floods  and  landslides.  Osh  province  occupies  approximately  15  percent  of\nthe country, has a population density of 42 persons/km2, and comprises approximately one fourth\nof  the  country\u2019s  population.  Osh  is  also  in  the  Fergana  valley  and  is  known  as  a  center  of\nagriculture  (cotton,  fruits,  and  vegetables).  Its  industrial  output  is  considerably  lower  than  that  of\nJalal\u2013Abad province, while its agricultural production is higher (Table A12.1).\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nTable A12.1: Main Economic Indicators of Project Provinces, 2000\n\nJalal\u2013Abad\n\nOsh\n\nIndicator\nRegional Population\nTotal\nAs percent of country\n\nUnemployed Population (percent)\nPer Capita Income (Som, current prices)\nAgricultural Output (percent of country) a\nIndustrial Output (percent of country)\nRegional Imports (percent of country imports) a\nRegional Exports(percent of country exports) a\n\na  Data are for 1999.\nSource:  National Statistics Committee, Kyrgyz Republic, 1999, 2000.\n\n893,900\n18.1\n3.3\n4,179\n14.4\n23.2\n5.0\n7.2\n\n1,211,700\n24.5\n1.8\n5,457\n18.5\n5.7\n4.5\n6.8\n\nProviding the Kyrgyz Republic's population with the basic minimum food requirements is an\n6.\nacute  problem.  The  cost  of  food  products  makes  up  a  significant  part  of  consumer  expenditures.\nThe poor, the majority of the population, spend 50 percent of their income on food. Generally, food\nexpenditures  as  a  share  of  the  family  budget  have  risen  because  the  prices  of  food  products,\nparticularly meat and milk products and fruit, have risen more quickly than income.  As a result of\nhigh  prices,  food  consumption  by  the  population  is  insufficient  and  lower  than  established\nstandards.\n\n2.\n\nEthnic Groups\n\n7.\nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  a  multiethnic  country  and  the  project  area  reflects  much  of  the\nethnic diversity. More than 100 ethnic groups are variously represented in the national population;\na dozen major groups have populations greater than 20,000. The main ethnic groups are Kyrgyz,\nRussians,  and  Uzbeks  (Table  A12.2).  Other  ethnic  groups  with  substantial  representation  are\nGermans,  Ukrainians,  Tatars,  Dungans,  Uighurs,  Kazakhs,  and  Tajiks.  The  country\u2019s  changing\nethnic  structure  corresponds  to  shifts  in  the  national  economy  associated  with  the  decline  of\nindustrial production. There has been an outflow of ethnic groups traditionally involved in industrial\nproduction,  as  well  as  those  migrating  to  countries  with  living  standards  higher  than  those  of  the\nKyrgyz Republic.\n\nTable A12.2:  Ethnic Composition\n\nLocation\nJalal\u2013Abad Province\n\nAk\u2013Syi District\nTash\u2013Kumyr City\nNooken District\nBazar\u2013Korgon District\nSuzak District\nJalal\u2013Abad City\nMayluu\u2013Suu City\n\nOsh  Province\n\nUzgen District\nKara\u2013Suu District\nOsh City\n\nKyrgyz (%)\n68.9\n93.3\n82.2\n65.1\n57.7\n58.9\n44.0\n\u2014\n\n62.9\n73.0\n54.2\n43.0\n\nEthnic Groups\n\nRussian (%)\n1.3\n0.4\n4.0\n1.1\n0.3\n0.5\n7.4\n\u2014\n\n2.0\n0.6\n0.3\n5.3\n\nUzbek (%)\n30.7\n4.9\n8.5\n30.5\n40.6\n35.1\n37.4\n\u2014\n\n24.1\n21.7\n37.2\n43.3\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\u2014 = not available.\nSource: TA 3335\u2013KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.\n\n63.9\n\n12.3\n\n13.6\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nC.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\nThe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  tried  to  determine  the  priority  that  the\n8.\npoor place on the road rehabilitation Project among their many needs, and reached the following\nconclusions.\n\n1.\n\nNeeds Assessment\n\n9.\nThe  surveys,  workshops,  and  focus  group  interviews  indicate  that  stakeholders  perceive\nimprovement of the project roads as being critically important in addressing the underlying causes\nof  poverty  and  increasing  economic  development  in  the  area  and  the  country.  All  sectors\nrecognized the Bishkek\u2013Osh road as the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s premier highway and its rehabilitation\nhas flagship status among other national development projects. As the road is a vital link between\nnorth  and  south,  stakeholders  perceive  its  improvement  as  strategic  and  essential  to  promote\nnational  integration,  consolidation,  and  political  stability.  Stakeholders  regard  the  following  as\nimpact areas of the Project:\n\n10.\nEmployment. Stakeholders regard the Project as a major opportunity to address in part the\nunemployment  problems  of  local  communities  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  will  generate  an\nestimated  903  person\u2013years  of  direct  employment,  including  624  person\u2013years  (69  percent)  for\nunskilled labor for roadworks. It is expected that local residents will supply all of the unskilled labor\nand part of the skilled labor requirements of the Project. In addition to employment in roadworks,\nroad  improvements  are  expected  to  create  jobs  through  the  expansion  of  roadside  trade  and\nservices,  including  camping  and  rest  areas  for  transiting  passengers  and  tourists  and  catering\nestablishments.\n\nAgricultural Benefits. Stakeholders see poor road conditions as a large problem for local\n11.\nfarmers who want to get their products to city markets. High transport costs and loss of agricultural\nproduce  restrict  market  access  and  inhibit  full  production.  The  reductions  in  product  damage\nanticipated  from  road  improvements  will  provide  significant  savings.  Lower  production  costs  and\nexpanded marketing opportunities are also expected.\n\n12.\nEducation and Health Care Services. Deficiencies in the provision of health care services\nand education exist, but mainly in terms of services and staffing. Physical facilities such as schools\nand hospitals are generally adequate. But the ability to maintain, staff, and support such facilities is\nnot adequate due to the fact that the area is still recovering from the collapse of the FSU and the\ndislocations  that  followed.  Road  improvements  are  perceived  as  contributing  to  economic\ndevelopment  and  thus  addressing  the  root  cause  of  the  problems.  The  proposed  road\nimprovements  will  contribute  to  mitigating  the  underlying  causes  of  poverty  in  the  area  by\nfacilitating  economic  recovery  and  allowing  continued  access  to  existing  medical  facilities  and\nschools.    In  the  areas  of  the  secondary  roads  to  be  improved  under  the  Project,  residents  have\naccess to basic health facilities; however, improvement of the secondary roads will facilitate access\nto more comprehensive health facilities.\n\n13.\nComplement to Ongoing Poverty\u2013Reduction Efforts. Road improvements are also seen\nto  complement  ongoing  development  efforts  in  the  project  area.  Other  aid  agency  programs\nincluding microfinance, agricultural extension services, tourism development, and NGO support are\nactive in the area and will benefit from the improved roads.\n\n                                                \n1  TA 3335\u2013KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\n14.\nOther Development Benefits. Project stakeholders anticipate that improving the Bishkek\u2013\nOsh  road  will  result  in  increased  household  income,  family  budget  savings  from  lower  transport\ncosts, enhanced labor mobility, improved access to services, increased practice of family planning,\nand a wider range and better quality of goods available at central markets. Road improvements are\nalso  expected  to  facilitate  civil  activity  and  the  dissemination  of  information.  Some  stakeholders\nemphasized  the  need  to  complement  road  improvements  with  other  measures  such  as\nmicrofinance activities to support small and medium\u2013scale enterprise development and agriculture\nso as to realize full benefits from the Project and maximize its contribution to poverty reduction.\n\n2.\n\nAdverse Impacts\n\nEthnic  Groups.  The  TA\u2019s  social  assessment  concluded  that  the  Project  would  not\n15.\nsignificantly  affect  ethnic  minorities.  Although  the  findings  identified  interethnic  relations  as  a\nsensitive  social  concern,  the  social  assessment  concluded  that  (i)  ethnic  groups  that  could\npotentially be adversely affected by the Project would not be affected on the basis of their ethnic\nidentity,  and  (ii)  that  access  to  project  benefits  would  not  be  conditioned  by  ethnicity.  The  social\nassessment found no reason to conclude that ethnic minorities would be inherently more affected\nby the potentially adverse impacts of road rehabilitation than would other groups. The rehabilitated\nroads will be open to all groups, and not restricted or constrained on an ethnic basis.\n\n16.\nResettlement. No resettlement, relocation activities, or land acquisition are anticipated. As\ncurrently  proposed,  the  project  activities  will  include  no  bypasses,  significant  realignments,  or\ndevelopment  of  new  alignments  in  previously  undisturbed  areas.  However,  in  case  the  detailed\ndesign reveals that people need to be resettled or land has to be acquired, the Executing Agency\nwill comply with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines.\n\n17. Women.  Through  participatory  rapid  appraisal  and  other  project\u2013design  activities,  it  was\nconcluded that women do not face any special obstacle in accessing and benefiting from transport\nservices,  nor  are  there  apparent  gender  issues  that  might  arise  during  implementation  of  the\nProject.  Consultations  also  indicate  that  women  are  likely  to  participate  in  the  employment\ngenerated  by  the  proposed  rehabilitation  activities  to  some  degree,  although  probably  not  to  a\nlarge extent, especially for certain manual jobs.\n\n18.\nOther  Vulnerable  Groups.  Vulnerable  groups  are  perceived  as  the  small\u2013scale  farmers,\nthe  unemployed  and  underemployed  urban  poor,  pensioners,  female  heads  of  households,  and\nothers who are vulnerable to changes in current economic conditions, including ethnic minorities.\nNone of these groups are perceived as vulnerable to adverse impacts resulting from the Project,\nhowever,  and  no  adverse  impacts  to  them  are  anticipated.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  entail\ninvoluntary resettlement, loss of livelihood, or price changes.\n\nD.\n\nIncorporation of Social Dimensions into the Project Design\n\n19.\nThe  social  analysis  indicates  a  need  for  activities  to  complement  the  road  rehabilitation.\nAdditional  components  have  been  identified,  and  activities  will  be  incorporated  in  the  Project\nconsistent with ADB's guidelines.\n\n1.\n\nRehabilitation of Roadside Social Infrastructure\n\n20.\nPullover  areas  and  bus  shelters  exist  at  adequate  intervals  along  the  roadway,  but\ngenerally need repair. Sidewalks and pedestrian facilities in villages through which the road passes\nwill be restored and improved.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\n2. \n\nTargeted Labor Recruitment\n\n21.\nEmployment  was  widely  identified  as  one  of  the  major  development  benefits  likely  to  be\ngained  from  the  Project.  Stakeholders  argued  that  the  most  important  way  to  maximize  project\nbenefits  was  to  give  more  attention  to  local  employment.  Recruitment  should  be  targeted  so  that\nmaximum benefit goes to the most disadvantaged and impoverished members of the community.\nThe project design incorporates measures to improve local recruitment. Benefits resulting from this\ncomponent will be evaluated through the project performance management system (PPMS) by the\nproject implementation unit. Several stakeholders also drew attention to salary issues, alleging that\nlocal employees of foreign contractors and subcontractors are underpaid and that salaries are not\ngiven on time. Late payments to subcontractors and employees reportedly cause hardships to local\ncommunities and affected households.\n\n3. \n\nParticipation of Local Contractors\n\nA  number  of  complaints  touch  on  the  participation  of  local  contractors  in  the  project  road\n22.\nconstruction and their ability to compete with foreign firms in contract awards; fairness of contracts\nand contracting procedures; delayed payments for works; and the need to give preference to local\ncompanies.  Citing  experience  in  the  ongoing  road  rehabilitation  projects,  several  stakeholders\nrecommended that steps be taken to consolidate experience gained by local subcontractors and to\nstrengthen  and  prepare  them  for  participation  in  the  proposed  Project.  This  is  being  done  by  the\ninternational consultants for the Second Road Rehabilitation Project.\n\n4.\n\nTargeted Procurement of Goods and Services\n\n23.\nThe Project will also generate a considerable demand for goods and services that can be\npurchased,  as  much  as  possible,  within  the  project  area.  Benefits  resulting  from  this  component\nwill also be evaluated as a part of the PPMS.\n\n5.\n\nSocially Transmitted Diseases\n\nThe  contractors  will  be  required  to  distribute  to  all  employees  and  casual  laborers,  and\n24.\ndisplay  in  prominent  places,  advice  concerning  the  nature,  dangers,  and  transmission  of  socially\ntransmitted  diseases  and  information  concerning  precautionary  measures.  Similar  material\nconcerning the dangers of drug use and the penalties associated with possession of and trafficking\nin drugs should also be distributed.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\n INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR\n\nA. \n\nObjectives\n\n1.\nThe technical assistance (TA) has two objectives. First, the consultants will help\nthe  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  strengthen  the  management  of\nthe secondary road network and give training to the maintenance organizations and the\nlocal communities. In performing their task, the consultants will work in cooperation with\ncommunity-based  organizations  or  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the\nsupervision  consultants  of  the  Project,  who  will  supervise  the  implementation  of  the\nmaintenance  operations  after  completion  of  the  TA.  Second,  the  consultants  will  study\nthe markets for transport services in the Kyrgyz Republic and recommend regulatory and\nother changes to increase their competitiveness.

Economic  prices  are  expressed  using  the  world  price  numeraire.  The  Project\ninvolves  rehabilitation  of  approximately  120  kilometers  (km)  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road  and\nimprovement of approximately 125 km of secondary roads. In the without\u2013project scenario, the\nroad  would  receive  only  minimal  maintenance  and  continue  to  deteriorate.  The  with-project\nscenario  includes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  according  to  international  standards.  The\neconomic analysis covers a period of 23 years (2002-2024), including about 3 years for project\nimplementation. All benefits and costs are in constant 2001 prices.\n\n2.\nProject  economic  costs  include  the  cost  of  resources  for  road  improvement  and\nmaintenance,  as  well  as  rural  road  improvement,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Costs\nwere  divided  into  tradable  and  nontradable.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  was  then\napplied to the nontradable portion.\n\n3.\nThe  principal  sources  of  economic  benefits  from  the  Project  are  savings  in  vehicle\noperating  costs  (VOCs),  passenger  and    freight  time  savings,  benefits  arising  from  generated\ntraffic,  and  economic  value  added.  Economic  benefits  were  calculated  with  the  same  method\nused  for  costs.  Improving  the  secondary  roads  will  improve  the  access  of  the  rural  poor  to\nmarkets  and  health  services.  Under  present  conditions,  transport  services  are  somewhat\nlimited, relative to potential demand, as vehicle owners and drivers are reluctant to drive on the\nmost deteriorated sections of the secondary roads. With improved conditions on these roads, it\nis expected that the frequency of service will increase, and fares and freight rates will decrease.\nThis will facilitate greater use of transport by local residents to markets, for example. Economic\nvalue  added  arises  from  the  improved  market  access  with  improvement  of  secondary  roads.\nThe  benefits  of  improved  access  to  health  services  or  of  improved  safety  conditions  on  the\nBishkek-Osh road were not included in the analysis as data to quantify them was insufficient.\n\n4.\nSavings in VOCs (Table A14.1) comprise the largest category of benefits, accounting for\nabout  76  percent  of  total  benefits,  and  arise  from  the  improved  road  conditions  resulting  from\nthe  civil  works  carried  out  under  the  Project.  The  VOCs  are  calculated  for  each  vehicle  type.\nUnit  economic  VOCs  for  passenger  and  freight  vehicles  were  estimated  using  the  highway\ndesign  and  maintenance  model  (HDM-IV).  VOC  savings  will  accrue  primarily \nfrom\nimprovements  on  the  road  surface,  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment,  and  increased  average\nspeed on some sections. Generated traffic is expected to arise from the reduced VOCs. With a\n20 percent reduction in VOCs and a price elasticity of transport demand of 0.5, generated traffic\nis  estimated  at  10  percent  of  total  traffic.  Benefits  from  VOC  savings  for  generated  traffic  are\nestimated  at  half  the  value  for  normal  traffic.  Benefits  from  international  transit  traffic,  which\ncomprises about 5 percent of total traffic, are not included in the economic analysis as they do\nnot accrue to the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n5.\nRehabilitating the Bishkek-Osh road will result in time savings due to the improved road\nconditions. The value of time for passengers is calculated at $0.28 per working hour and $0.08\nper  nonworking  hour.  The  value  of  time  for  freight  traffic  was  estimated  based  on  the\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\ncomposition of commodities transported by vehicle type and the value of the commodities. The\nvalues range from $0.05 per hour for light trucks to $0.22 per hour for articulated trucks.\n\nTable A14.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type\n($ per \u2018000 vehicle-km)\n\nScenario a\n\nCars\n\nPickups\n\nBuses\n\nLight\nTrucks\n\nHeavy\nTrucks\n\nArticulated\nTrucks\n\n70\n50\n20\n\n215\n150\n65\n\n140\n100\n40\n\n400\n290\n110\n\n475\n375\n100\n\nMedium-\nsize\nTrucks\n170\n130\n40\n\nWithout Project\nWith Project\nVOC Savings\nVOC = vehicle operating costs.\na  For Uzgen-Osh road section in 2005.\n\n80\n60\n20\n\n6.\nEconomic  value  added  comprises  the  generated  agricultural  production  resulting  from\nimproved access to markets provided by the improved secondary roads. Surveys of residents in\nthe  areas  of  the  secondary  roads  indicate  that  a  large  proportion  of  residents  will  increase\nagricultural production to sell in markets along the secondary roads and the Bishkek-Osh road.\nThe  surveys  also  indicate  that  significant  numbers  of  residents  will  shift  to  higher  value\nagricultural  crops  to  take  advantage  of  the  improved  access  to  markets.  The  economic  value\nadded is calculated at 60 percent of the value of agricultural production.\n\nD.\n\nResults of Economic Analysis\n\n7.\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 19.3 percent (Table A14.2),\nand the net present value is $28.2 million. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects\nof negative changes in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project.\nThe sensitivity analysis (Table A14.3) indicates that costs would have to increase by 77 percent\nor benefits decrease by 43.5 percent for the EIRR to reach the cutoff level of 12 percent. Given\nthe  straightforward  nature  of  the  rehabilitation  works  and  the  executing  agency\u2019s  experience\nwith similar projects, such changes are unlikely to occur.\n\n8.\nDistribution  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  net  economic  benefits  arising  from  the\nProject.  The  benefits  were  distributed  among  (i)  passengers,  (ii)  freight  users,  (iii)  vehicle\nowners,  (iv)  direct  labor,  and  (v)  the  Government/economy  (Table  A14.4).  The  distribution  is\nbased  on  the  development  of  increased  competitiveness  of  transport  services  in  the  project\narea, as a result of the policy reforms to be implemented as part of the Project. The increased\ncompetitiveness will result in a higher proportion of  VOC savings being passed on to passenger\nand freight transport users than would be the case without the Project. It is assumed that vehicle\nowners will pass on 50 percent of VOC savings to users in the form of lower fares and freight\nrates.  The  benefits  from  the  economic  value  added  from  generated  agricultural  production\naccrue  to  direct  labor,  based  on  poverty  incidence  in  the  areas  of  the  secondary  roads.\nPassenger users receive the largest proportion of benefits at 46 percent, followed by labor at 33\npercent.\n\n\f 65\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nTable A14.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n($ million)\n\nCosts\n\nYear\n\nCapital\n\nMaintenance\n\nTotal \n\nVOC \nSavings\n\nTime \nSavings\n\nBenefits\nGenerated \nTraffic\n\nEconomic \nValue \n\nTotal \n\nNet \nBenefits\n\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n\n13.475\n17.966\n13.475\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.345\n0.419\n0.000\n0.000\n0.000\n0.070\n1.110\n0.000\n0.983\n0.000\n0.000\n0.345\n0.419\n0.000\n\n13.475\n17.966\n13.475\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.359\n0.433\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.084\n1.124\n0.014\n0.997\n0.014\n0.014\n0.359\n0.433\n0.014\n\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n0.014\n\n0.550\n1.576\n3.021\n4.670\n5.888\n6.324\n6.815\n7.380\n7.923\n8.458\n8.803\n9.506\n10.267\n11.001\n11.745\n12.917\n13.765\n14.894\n15.894\n16.826\n17.666\n18.368\n\n0.056\n0.178\n0.418\n0.808\n1.114\n1.211\n1.327\n1.461\n1.597\n1.737\n1.863\n2.047\n2.239\n2.416\n2.597\n2.844\n3.053\n3.286\n3.519\n3.740\n3.934\n4.093\n\n0.039\n0.113\n0.216\n0.334\n0.421\n0.452\n0.487\n0.527\n0.566\n0.604\n0.629\n0.679\n0.733\n0.786\n0.839\n0.923\n0.983\n1.064\n1.135\n1.202\n1.262\n1.312\n\n0.644\n1.866\n4.065\n6.632\n8.652\n9.627\n10.679\n11.418\n12.136\n12.848\n13.345\n14.283\n15.289\n16.253\n17.231\n18.733\n19.851\n21.294\n22.599\n23.818\n24.912\n25.822\n\n0.410\n0.820\n1.230\n1.640\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n2.050\n\n(13.475)\n(17.322)\n(11.609)\n4.051\n6.618\n8.638\n9.613\n10.665\n11.404\n11.777\n12.415\n13.331\n14.269\n15.275\n16.169\n16.107\n18.719\n18.854\n21.280\n22.584\n23.459\n24.479\n25.808\n\nVOC = vehicle operating costs.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return =\n\n19.3%\n\nNet Present Value =\n\n28.220\n\nTable A14.3: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nSwitching\nValues (%)\n\u2013\n77.0\n43.5\n64.0\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nEIRR\n(%)\nScenario\n19.3\n1.

The PIA\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nassessed the extent to which transport cost reductions will be passed on to users of\npassenger and freight transport services;\nassessed the distribution of the net benefits between users of transport services and\nother groups;\nidentified  the  proportion  of  poor  and  very  poor  beneficiaries  and  the  net  benefits\nthey will receive;\nclarified the  assumptions and analysis behind the distribution analysis and poverty\nimpact assessment; and\nidentified complementary activities to help reduce poverty in the project area.\n\n2.\nThe main finding is that the Project will directly benefit the poor and very poor people in the\nproject  area.  It  will  give  them  a  substantial  share  of  the  net  benefits  from  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road\nand  secondary  roads  by  decreasing  vehicle  operating  costs  and  improving  access  to  markets,\nemployment opportunities, and health facilities.\n\nB.\n\nPoverty\n\n1. \n\nDefinition of Poverty\n\n3.\nThe  Kyrgyz  National  Statistics  Committee  in  conjunction  with  the  World  Bank  set  two\npoverty  lines  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic:  the  first  or  the  \"food\"  poverty  line  measures  \u201cextreme\npoverty\u201d and is set at the level of consumption below which, even if all resources were devoted to\nfood, the minimum caloric requirement would not be met. The other, or the \u201cgeneral\u201d poverty line,\nrepresents a minimum per capita consumption basket that includes food and nonfood items. The\nvalue of the general poverty line for the year 2000 is Som7,580 (equivalent to approximately $158)\nand  that  of  the  extreme  poverty  line  is  Som4,563  (equivalent  to  approximately  $95).  These  have\nbeen adopted by all international agencies and Government offices to define poverty in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic.\n\n2. \n\nThe Policy Environment\n\n4.\nThe comprehensive development framework (CDF) is the Government\u2019s framework for the\ncountry\u2019s  development  over  the  period  2000\u20132010.  A  key  element  of  the  CDF  is  the  national\nstrategy for poverty reduction (NSPR). The premises and key features of the CDF are\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\ngrowth and development of the private sector,\ngrowth of employment and reduction of unemployment,\ngrowth of Government revenues,\nimproving the tax system, and\nproviding targeted assistance to vulnerable groups.\n\n                                                \n1 TA  3335-KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\nThe  Government,  with  the  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the  World  Bank,  and\n5.\nthe  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  is  currently  drafting  the  NSPR.  The  strategy  will\ndefine the priority areas of intervention for each sector and also geographically so as to maximize\nthe poverty reduction impact of foreign and domestic investments. The NSPR has highlighted the\nimportance of the transport sector principally for promoting political stability, economic growth, and\ntrade as a necessary step in reaching the country's development and poverty\u2013reduction goals.\n\n3. \n\nPoverty Profile\n\n6.\nAt the national level, the proportion of households living in poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic\nincreased  from  43.5  percent  in  1996  to  54.9  percent  in  1998.  Similarly,  the  incidence  of  extreme\npoverty increased from 19.1 percent in 1996 to 23.0 percent in 1998. With the increased economic\ngrowth  since  1998,  the  overall  poverty  incidence  dropped  to  52.0  percent  in  2000  (Table  A15.1),\nwhile the percentage of the extremely poor decreased to 17.8 percent.\n\nTable A15.1:  Kyrgyz Republic Poverty Incidence and Per Capita Income, by Province \u2013 2000\n\nLocation\n\nChuy\nJalal\u2013Abada\nOsha\nTalas\nNaryn\nIssyk\u2013Kul\nBatken\nBishkek\n\nPoor\n%\n\nExtremely\nPoor %\n\nNon\u2013Poor\n%\n\nPer Capita\nIncome\n(Som)\n8,056\n4,179\n5,457\n4,041\n3,155\n4,631\n4,125\n9,644\n\n28.1\n67.9\n51.6\n72.7\n81.4\n60.9\n69.0\n29.9\n\n4.5\n15.1\n19.8\n36.6\n37.6\n27.6\n34.3\n5.8\n\nTotal\nPopulation\n(thousands)\n767.1\n893.9\n1,211.7\n204.1\n254.2\n420.2\n390.8\n793.4\n\n71.9\n32.1\n48.4\n27.3\n18.6\n39.1\n31.0\n70.1\n\n5,945\nNational Average\naProvinces traversed by the project roads.\nSource: 1996\u20131998 Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Surveys, World Bank, and National Statistics Committee, Kyrgyz\n\n17.8\n\n48.0\n\n52.0\n\n4,935.4\n\nRepublic, 2000.\n\n7.\nWithin  a  country  in  which  more  than  half  of  the  population  is  classified  as  poor,  the  data\nindicate that in the project area2 there are extremely high poverty rates (ranging roughly from 46 to\n95 percent) and that five of the six districts (Table A15.2) directly affected by the proposed Project\nhave  a  poverty  incidence  above  the  national  average.

The results for the provinces in the project area are very similar to the\n9.\naggregate for the country. The poor and very poor do not own motor vehicles. Given the breadth of\npoverty, the ownership rates are somewhat higher than expected for the middle\u2013income quintiles\n(Table A15.3).\n\nTable A15.3: Percent of Households Reporting Ownership of a Motor Vehicle, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, by Total Per Capita Household Expenditure Quintile\n\nTotal Per Capita\nExpenditure Quintile\n\n81\u2013100%\n61\u201380%\n41\u201360%\n21\u201340 %\n0\u201320%\nSource: Poverty Monitoring Survey.\n\nYes\n\n9\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\nNo\n\n91\n95\n96\n97\n98\n\nIncome  Levels  and  Transport  Expenses.  The  Project\u2019s  household  survey  results  show\n10.\nhow expenditures for transport and gasoline vary by per capita income levels  (Table A.15.4). The\ndisparity  between  expenditures  for  transporting  farm  produce  to  market  suggests  that  only  the\nbetter\u2013off farmers travel to more distant markets.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 15, page 4\n\nTable A15.4: Households in the Project Area and Transportation Expenditure (Som), 2000\n\nTotal Per Capita\nExpenditure Quintile\n\nAverage Total\nMonthly Per\nCapita  Income\n\n81 \u2013 100%\n61 \u2013 80%\n41 \u2013 60%\n21 \u2013 40 %\n0 \u2013 20%\n\n1,508\n763\n611\n443\n391\n\nAverage Per Capita\nMonthly\nExpenditure on all\nTransportation\n169\n77\n51\n36\n25\n\nAverage Per Capita\nMonthly Expenditure\nto Transport  Farm\nProducea\n36\n4\n3\n3\n2\n\naFor those engaged in farming or marketing farm produce.\nSource: Consultant Household Survey, The Kyrgyz Republic, 2000.\n\n11.\nCompetitiveness of Transport Services. Results of the surveys suggest that the market\nfor  passenger  transport  on  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  is  somewhat  competitive,  but  the  public  sector\nstill  has  a  large  influence.  While  the  Government  has  privatized  the  majority  of  transport\nenterprises,  it  still  maintains  large  holdings  in  the  joint\u2013stock  companies,  which  comprise  the\nlargest share  of privatized enterprises.  The surveys confirmed the Government\u2019s presence in the\ntransport  market.  Of  the  drivers  of  passenger  vehicles  surveyed,  a  third  are  employed  by  the\nGovernment or lease their vehicles from the Government. The remainder of the passenger vehicles\nare driven by owner/operators, almost all of whom own only one vehicle. Fares vary by vehicle type\nand distance, as is to be expected in a competitive market. About 15 percent of passenger drivers\nsaid they would reduce the fares they charged based on the vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings\nthey would realize from the rehabilitated project roads.\n\n12.\nThe  Government  owns  the  bus  stations  along  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road.  The  bus  terminal\noperators require large bus operators to travel previously approved routes. The bus terminals also\nset  the  fares  that  the  drivers  can  charge.  Each  driver  is  issued  a  document  approving  each  trip\nfrom  origin  to  final  destination.  The  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs,  through  its  own  checkpoints,\nroutinely  stops  large  bus  drivers  to  check  their  papers.  Large  bus  drivers  without  the\ndocumentation  issued  by  the  bus  terminal  must  make  frequent  unofficial  payments  to  proceed  to\ntheir  destinations.  Moreover,  these  unofficial  payments  are  large  so  that  such  trips  are  not  very\nprofitable  and  are  thus  a  relatively  rare  event.  The  survey  indicates  that  unofficial  payments  are\nmade at various checkpoints set up by Government agencies. These informal tolls run as high as\nSom1,500  per  vehicle  per  checkpoint  for  drivers  of  freight  vehicles  and  Som200  per  vehicle  per\ncheckpoint for drivers of passenger vehicles.\n\n2. \n\nPoor People\u2019s Use of the Project Roads\n\n13.\nThe surveys show that the users of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road are predominantly poor. Of the\n113 passengers surveyed, 73 percent were below the poverty line, and 52 percent were below the\nextreme  poverty  line.3  People  engaged  in  nonfarm  commerce  make  up  about  a  third  of  the  road\nusers  surveyed.  The  other  large  group  of  users  (35  percent)  comprises  professionals  who  are\nprimarily  in  the  public  sector.  Of  the  passengers  using  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road,  70  percent  live  in\nrural areas. They tend to use the road for local as opposed to long\u2013distance trips.\n\n                                                \n3  As was done for the Poverty Monitoring Survey (PMS) and all of the consultant\u2019s surveys, reported expenditures were\nadjusted upward to take into account people's noncash incomes. Using the PMS method, an estimated 26 percent of\nrural household income is produced on land near the home. For urban households, the PMS estimated that 5 percent\nof household income was produced via noncash means. Even with these upward adjustments, the results show that\nthe poor and extremely poor comprise very large proportions of the project road users.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 15, page 5\n\n3.\n\nAccess to Social Services\n\n14.\nAs  with  most  countries  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  access  to  lower\u2013level  schools  and\nhospitals/health  facilities  generally  is  not  a  major  issue.  The  vast  majority  of  passengers  with\nschool\u2013age children reported that the school is less than a kilometer from their residence and that\nall the children walk to school. Over three quarters of them said that it takes their children less than\n30 minutes to reach school. The results are nearly the same for hospitals/clinics. About two thirds\nsay  they  walk  to  the  nearest  hospital  or  clinic,  and  about  80  percent  say  that  the  trip  takes  less\nthan 30 minutes. The only access problem occurs when there is a health emergency situation, a\nneed  for  more  comprehensive  health  facilities,  or  when  one  wants  to  reach  higher  education\nfacilities that are found in the district center. Men and women use the road with equal frequency.\nThe  average  age  of  the  passengers  on  the  road  is  38.  The  profile  of  household  size  fits  the\nnational  pattern,  with  rural  households  approaching  six  persons  and  urban  households\napproaching three persons.\n\nC. \n\nThe Secondary Road Network\n\n15.\nEvaluation criteria and an evaluation system were developed to identify secondary roads to be\nimproved by the Project. The system incorporated inputs from MOTC, as well as from MOTC provincial\noffices and local maintenance units in the project area. Inputs from other local government units at the\nprovincial  and  district  levels,  and  other  stakeholders,  including  prospective  beneficiaries,  were  also\nsolicited and their road nominations considered.\n\n16.\n\nThe following criteria were used to form the shortlist:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\npopulation and population density within the road area of influence;\nextent and degree of poverty within the beneficiary population;\ncash  crop  production  and  potential  of  the  agricultural  areas  to  be  served  by  the\nsecondary roads;\nextent to which the roads would improve access to employment, health, education,\nand other services (i.e., number of schools and clinics served);\nexisting and potential traffic volumes on the roads; and\nenvironmental assessment.\n\n17.\n\nThe selected secondary roads are listed in Table A15.5.\n\nTable A15.5: Selected Secondary Roads\n\nLength To Be\nRehabilitated (km)\n72\n\nPopulation Served\n\n37,400\n\nRoad\n\nBazar Korgon\u2013Arslanbob\n(including Kyzyl Ungkur\nbranch)\n\nTash  Kumyr\u2013Kara Djigadz\n\n53\n\n102,000\n\n(i) \n\nThe  Bazar  Korgon\u2013Arslanbob  road  connects  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  to  the  Kyzyl\nUngkur  road  segment.  The  valley\u2019s  economic  potential  lies  in  its  rich  agricultural\nresource base\u2013cotton, tobacco, and rice, as well as orchards and livestock. Farmers\nalso tend walnut trees  along the productive segments of this road. The Government\npermits,  but  regulates,  selective  harvesting  of  wood.  Walnut  wood  is  a  high\u2013value\ncommodity  and  an  appropriate  extension  program  could  help  farmers  expand\n\n\f72\n\nproduction  of  the  nuts  and  the  wood.  The  Kyzyl  Ungkur  branch  is  35  km  from  the\nBishkek\u2013Osh  road.  According  to  the  social,  economic,  and  environmental  criteria,  this\nroad segment is the top priority road requiring improvement. The population of the valley\nis  served  by  a  hospital  that  has  6  doctors  and  42  nurses.  The  hospital  seems  in  good\ncondition  although  patients  have  to  buy  their  own  medicine  in  order  to  be  treated  and\npurchase fuel if they need to be transported to the main hospital in Jalal\u2013Abad.\n\nAppendix 15, page 6\n\n(ii)  The Tash Kumyr\u2013Kara Djigadz road has become, due to the border controls imposed\nby  Uzbekistan,  the  only  outlet  to  markets  for  people  living  along  the  road.  At  the\nbeginning  of  the  road,  just  off  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road,  coal  mining  still  provides\nminimal  economic  activity.  In  the  relatively  poorer  areas  of  the  district,  economic\npotential  is  limited  to  sheep  and  goat  husbandry.  However,  for  the  town  and  the\nsurrounding valley the outlook will be much better with improved access. This area is\nbetter  endowed  with  agricultural  potential,  with  cotton  and  tobacco  being  prominent\ncrops.  Improving  the  road  will  help  facilitate  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty\ncaused by the cessation of access to markets in Uzbekistan.\n\nD. \n\nDistribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio\n\nThe estimated direct benefits to the economy as a whole of rehabilitating the Bishkek\u2013Osh\n18.\nroad  and  the  secondary  roads  are  $28.2  million  in  present  value  (PV).  This  is  a  conservative\nestimate,  because  only  direct  benefits  are  considered,  and  represents  the  sum  of  the  PV  of\nbenefits to passengers, freight users, vehicle owners, labor, and the Government or the economy.\nThe distribution of net benefits (Table A15.6) is based on increased competitiveness of markets for\ntransport services in the project area, which will result from the policy reforms to be implemented\nas  part  of  the  Project.  As  a  result  of  increased  competitiveness,  a  higher  proportion  of  VOC\nsavings  will  be  passed  on  to  the  poor  than  would  be  the  case  without  the  Project.  It  is  assumed\nthat vehicle owners will pass on 50 percent of VOC savings to users in the form of lower fares and\nfreight rates.\n\nTable A15.6: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nNet Project Benefits\nNet Loan Flows\nGovernment's\nFinancial Revenues\nNet Present Value\nGains and Losses\nProportion of the\nPoor (%)\nNet Benefits for the\nPoor\n\nFinancial\nPresent\nValue\n\n-21.980\n\n-4.132\n\nEconomic\nPresent\nValue\n28.220\n\n28.220\n\n28.220\n21.980\n\n4.132\n54.332\n\nEconomic \u2013\nFinancial\n\nPassengers Freight\nUsers\n\nVehicle\nOwners\n\nLabor\n\nGovt/\nEconomy\n\nNet\nNational\nBenefits\n\nLender\nForeign\n\n12.933\n\n5.493\n\n0.736\n\n9.207\n\n-0.150\n21.980\n\n4.132\n9.207 25.962\n9.207 25.962\n\n-21.980\n\n-21.980\n\n12.933\n12.933\n\n5.493\n5.493\n\n0.736\n0.736\n\n73\n\n60\n\n5\n\n80\n\n33\n\n9.441\n\n3.296\n\n0.037\n\n7.365\n\n8.568\n\nPoverty Impact Ratio\n\n54.332\n\n28.707\n53%\n\nThe  Project  will  also  provide  indirect  benefits,  such  as  the  increased  trade  and  economic\n19.\nactivity induced by the improved road, in addition to the generated agricultural production included\nin  the  economic  analysis.  The  size  of  the  indirect  benefits  will  depend  on  how  the  regional  and\nnational economies grow over the Project's time horizon. The indirect benefits will affect the poor in\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 15, page 7\n\ntwo ways: first, jobs and other economic opportunities will be created; and second, the tax revenue\narising from the generated economic activity will provide more funding for social services.\n\n20.\nTo assess the poverty impact of the Project, the proportion of the poor in each category of\nbeneficiary was determined, based on extensive surveys in the project area carried out by the TA\nconsultants and by analysis of Government expenditures. The surveys indicated that 73 percent of\npassengers using the Bishkek\u2013Osh road are poor (which corresponds to poverty incidence in the\nproject area), while 60 percent of freight users are poor. Among the users of freight services are\nsmall farmers sending their goods to market as well as individuals engaged in small\u2013scale trading\nactivities.  The  Project  will  use  a  high  level  of  unskilled  labor,  and  the  proportion  of  the  poor  for\nlabor  is  estimated  at  80  percent.  Benefits  from  the  economic  value  added  from  the  generated\nagricultural production have been distributed to labor, in accordance with poverty incidence in the\nareas along the secondary roads. For benefits accruing to the Government or the economy, it was\ncalculated  that  33  percent  will  go  to  the  poor,  based  on  the  proportion  of  Government  spending\ndirected to the poor, and determined through analysis of Government expenditure data.\n\nAs  part  of  the  benefits  analysis,  the  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  was  computed  for  the\n21.\nBishkek\u2013Osh road and the secondary roads, based on the present value of the benefits. The PIR\nrepresents the proportion of project benefits that accrue to the poor. The PIR is 0.53, indicating that\n53 percent of the net project benefits reach poor users. With the 73 percent proportion of the poor\namong project beneficiaries and the PIR of 53 percent, the Project is expected to have a significant\npoverty\u2013reduction impact. However, since the Project is beneficiary non\u2013specific and it cannot be\nguaranteed that the Projects benefits will be passed on to the poor, by ADB's poverty classification\ncriteria the Project is classified as other, with a thematic priority of economic growth.\n\n22.\nSensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  the  effect  of  reduced  competition  for\ntransport services on the poverty reduction impact of the Project. The analysis was conducted for a\nscenario of reduced competition in which it is assumed that vehicle owners pass on only 5 percent\nof reductions in VOCs to road users, compared with 50 percent in the base case. In the reduced\ncompetition scenario, the PIR is estimated to be 44 percent (Table A15.7), versus 53 percent in the\nbase  case.  This  demonstrates  that  increased  competition  in  the  transport  market  is  an  important\nfactor  in  ensuring  that  benefits  are  passed  on  to  the  poor,  and  reinforces  the  importance  of  the\nProject\u2019s policy dialogue on this issue.\n\nTable A15.7: Sensitivity Analysis: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio with\n\nLess Competitive Transport Markets\n\n($ million)\n\nItem\nNet Project Benefits\nNet Financial Flows\nGovernment's\nFinancial Revenues\nNet Present Value\nGains and Losses\nProportion of the\nPoor (%)\nNet Benefits for the\nPoor\n\nEconomic\n\u2013Financial\n\nPassengers Freight\nUsers\n\nVehicle\nOwners\n\nLabor\n\nGovt/\nEconomy\n\n4.963\n\n2.107 6.995\n\n11.047\n\nNet\nNational\nBenefits\n\nLender\nForeign\n\n-21.980\n\nFinancial\nPresent\nValue\n\n-21.980\n\n-4.132\n\nEconomic\nPresent\nValue\n28.220\n0.000\n\n0.000\n28.220\n\n28.220\n21.980\n\n4.132\n54.332\n\n3.108\n21.980\n\n4.132\n29.220\n29.220\n\n4.963\n4.963\n\n2.107 6.995\n2.107 6.995\n\n11.047\n11.047\n\n0.000 -21.980\n\n54.332\n\n73\n\n60\n\n5\n\n80\n\n33\n\n3.623\n\n1.264 0.350\n\n8.837\n\n9.643\n\nPoverty Impact Ratio\n\n23.717\n44%\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 17 August 2001)\n", "        \n             \n", "Currency Unit\nSom1.00\n$ 1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Som\n$0.02\nSom48\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\naverage annual daily traffic\nCentral Asian Republic\ncomprehensive development framework\nDepartment of Roads\nexecuting agency\neconomic internal rate of return\nformer Soviet Union\ngross domestic product\ngross national product\nhectare\nhighway design and maintenance model\ninternational competitive bidding\nIslamic Development Bank\ninitial environmental examination\nInternational Monetary Fund\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation\nlocal maintenance unit\nMinistry of Internal Affairs\nMinistry of Finance\nMinistry of Transport and Communications\nNational Road Safety Council\nnational strategy for poverty reduction\nproject administration\npublic investment program\npoverty impact ratio\nproject implementation unit\npoverty monitoring survey\nproject performance management system\nparticipatory rapid appraisal\npoverty reduction and growth facility\nproject steering committee\nregional road maintenance agency\nRoad Safety Act\nsummary initial environmental examination\nton (metric)\ntechnical assistance\nvehicle operating cost\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "ADB\nAADT\nCAR\nCDF\nDOR\nEA\nEIRR\nFSU\nGDP\nGNP\nh\nHDM\nICB\nIDB\nIEE\nIMF\nJBIC\nLMU\nMIA\nMOF\nMOTC\nNRSC\nNSPR\nPA\nPIP\nPIR\nPIU\nPMS\nPPMS\nPRA\nPRGF\nPSC\nRRMA\nRSA\nSIEE\nt\nTA\nVOC\n", "NOTES\n", "(i)\n(ii)\n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.\nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.\n", "CONTENTS\n", "LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY\n", "MAP\n", "I. \n", "II. \n", "III.\n", "THE PROPOSAL\n", "INTRODUCTION\n", "BACKGROUND\n", "IV.\n", "THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n", "The Transport Sector\nGovernment Policies and Plans\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\nLessons Learned\nADB\u2019S Operational and Sector Strategy\nPolicy Dialogue\n", "Rationale\nObjectives and Scope\nTechnical Justification\nCost Estimates\nFinancing Plan\nThe Executing Agency\nImplementation Arrangements\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\nTechnical Assistance\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD. \nE.\nF.\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\nG.\nH.\nI.\n", "A.\nB.\nC.\n", "V.\n", "PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n", "Economic Analysis\nImpact on Poverty\nProject Risks\n", "VI.\n", "ASSURANCES\n", "VII.\n", "RECOMMENDATION\n", "APPENDIXES\n", "Page\n", "ii\n", "vi\n", "1\n", "1\n", "1\n", "1\n7\n8\n8\n8\n9\n", "11\n", "11\n12\n13\n14\n14\n15\n15\n18\n19\n", "20\n", "20\n20\n21\n", "22\n", " 25\n", "26\n"]}
