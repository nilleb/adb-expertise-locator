The  irrigation  system  rehabilitation  and  modernization  component  will \ncover about 20,000 hectares (ha) and benefit about 24,000 households. 3 Parallel to the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  project,  cofinancing  from  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD)  will  strengthen  local,  regional,  and  national  capacity  for  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDevelopment  issues.  Agriculture  accounted  for  31%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct,  52%  of  employment,  and  20%  of  exports  in  2014.4 Despite  good  land 5 and  water \nresource endowments,6 an ample pool of low-cost labor, and proximity to large regional markets, \nMyanmar  has  significantly  underperformed  neighboring  countries  in  terms  of  labor  and  land \nproductivity since the 1960s. Growth in the agriculture sector was only 3.3% in 2014, and most \nfarming  systems  are  caught  in  a  low  equilibrium  trap:  low  inputs  result  in  low  productivity  and \nlow quality of outputs that bring low returns. This contributes to a high incidence of poverty, food \ninsecurity, indebtedness, malnutrition, and low levels of education among the rural poor. \n \nAlthough  sector  indicators  reflect  an  economy  in  transition,  Myanmar\u2019s  agricultural \n4. \ndevelopment potential is considerable and offers a significant opportunity for inclusive economic \ngrowth.7 The country has 18.2 million ha of arable land, of which only 13.3 million ha (73%) are \ncultivated at present. In the monsoon season, only 2.1 million ha of cultivated land are irrigated, \nwhile  the  remaining  11.2  million  ha  are  rain-fed.  Rice  is  the  main  crop.  Other  crops  include \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The project meets the criteria for a sector project that (i) the government have an agriculture sector development \nplan and appropriate sector policies; (ii) there be sufficient institutional capacity to implement the plan; and (iii) the \nassistance  support  the  articulation  of  strategic  sector  policy  priorities.

Country Information Note. Manila. \n5   In Myanmar, the average farm size of 3 ha is higher than in other developing Asian countries. Myanmar also has a \n\nlarger share of the workforce working in agriculture, and the average age of farmers is lower. \n\n6  Myanmar\u2019s water resources are considerable. Four river systems supply more than 19,000 cubic meters per capita \nof  water  each  year,  compared  with  an  average  4,000  cubic  meters  per  year  across  Asia.   The  country  currently \nuses less than 10% of its water resources.  \n\n7  ADB. 2014. Myanmar: Unlocking the Potential\u2014Country Diagnostic Study. Manila. \n\n\f2  \n\n \n\npulses, oilseeds, maize, cotton, rubber, sugarcane, tropical fruits, and vegetables.8 The potential \nfor further developing the value chain for these crops is significant. \n \n5. \nSector  constraints.  The  CDZ  has  the  second-highest  population  density  but  remains \none of the least developed.9 Seasonal water shortages caused by low and erratic annual rainfall \npatterns  and  sandy  and  fragile  soils  render  agriculture  a  high-risk  endeavor. 10  Key  sector \nconstraints  in  the  CDZ  include  (i)  weak  land  and  water  resource  management;  (ii)  disjointed \nagricultural  value  chains,  with  poor  access  to  support  services,  inputs,  and  inadequate  post-\nharvest  operations  and  marketing  arrangements;  (iii)  poor  irrigation  infrastructure  and  weak \nmanagement, resulting in unreliable and inequitable access to water; (iv) insufficient operational \nflexibility  to  cope  with  the  emerging  impacts  of  climate  change;  and  (v)  insufficient  public \ninvestment and private sector participation.  \n \n6. \nRevitalizing  agriculture  and  promoting  agricultural  value  chains.  Stimulating  and \ndeveloping  agricultural  value  chains  will  help  ensure  balanced,  integrated  rural  development \nand income growth for farmers in the CDZ. Improvements in the value chains through research \nand  development  and  extension  delivery  of  improved  cropping  systems  that  increase  the \nproduction  of  pulses,  oilseeds,  and  other  non-rice  crops  are  necessary  to  raise  both  on-farm \nand  off-farm  agricultural  productivity.  Predictable water  supply  is  an  important  prerequisite  but \nonly part of the solution. Along with improving access to irrigation, a broader focus on integrated \nvalue chain development will help enhance the production base and ensure that farmers have \nmore access to production credit and quality seeds and other farm inputs at reasonable prices. \n \n7. \nIrrigated  agriculture.  Myanmar  increased  its  investment  in  new  irrigation  systems  in \n1960 and stepped this up after 1990, but construction quality and maintenance have often been \npoor.11 The condition of these systems has declined, resulting in low efficiency and productivity. \nTraditional arrangements for irrigation management have also been undermined by decades of \ntop-down administrative control. The government lifted a restriction on irrigating non-rice crops \nin 2014. The potential now exists to operate existing systems more flexibly as storage systems, \nincreasing  water  utilization  and  diversifying  crop  production,  for  which  the  CDZ  has  a \ncomparative  advantage  over  other  areas  in  Myanmar.  The  four  project  districts  of  Magway, \nMeiktila,  Shwebo,  and  Yamethin  have  a  combined  irrigable  area  of  more  than  75,000  ha,  of \nwhich  the  project  will  cover  about  20,000  ha  (6%  of  the  total  irrigated  area  in  CDZ).12 The \naverage annual cropping intensity of the subprojects studied under the project preparatory TA is \nbroadly  typical  of  the  CDZ.  It  ranges  from  65%  to  130%  and  averages  110%.  These  systems \nneed  to  be  rehabilitated,  modernized,  and  better  managed  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, \n\n                                                \n8  Myanmar  is  the  world\u2019s  second-largest  producer  of  pulses  and  beans,  and  third-largest  for  sesame  after  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and India. \n\n9  The  CDZ  covers  more  than  54,000  square  kilometers,  encompassing  the  lower  Sagaing  region,  the  central  and \nwestern Mandalay region, and most of Magway region. It is home to more than 15.4 million people, accounting for \n25% of the country\u2019s population, 76% of whom live in rural areas.

Nay Pyi Taw. \n\n10 Situated  in  the  shadow  of  the  Rakhine  mountain  range,  the  CDZ  has  an  average  annual  rainfall  of  just  800 \nmillimeters. Rainfall is negligible during Myanmar\u2019s 6-month dry season and the effects of drought and dry spells \nare  a  key  determinant  of  chronic  poverty  and  food  insecurity  in  the  CDZ.  Irrigation  is  needed  to  produce  a  dry \nseason crop and essential even for securing a good crop during the monsoon season rains.  \n\n11 Nationwide,  there  has  been  rapid  construction  of  dams  and  irrigation  coverage  since  the  1960s,  and  particularly \n\nafter 1990, but the currently developed area is still just over 20% of the potential area of about 10 million ha. \n\n12 The CDZ has a combined irrigated area of about 350,000 ha, 25% of the total irrigated area in Myanmar.  Of 240 \nprojects  built  since  1998,  130  are  located  in  the  CDZ.  Of  these,  113  have  reservoirs  that  make  them  relatively \nresilient  to  climate change.

Myanmar  is  highly  vulnerable  to severe  climate \nevents,  particularly  cyclones.  Although  conditions  vary  considerably  between  regions,  climate \nchanges  observed  during  2005\u20132015  have  included  higher  temperatures,  higher  rainfall,  and \nincreased intensity of rains, with longer dry seasons and delays in the onset of the rainy season. \nThis  trend  suggests  that  in  future,  longer  dry  seasons  and  higher  temperatures  will  increase \ncrop water requirements, but higher and more intense rainfall will  increase runoff. All irrigation \nsystems covered by the project have reservoirs, which may allow storage of increased monsoon \nrunoff for subsequent use to increase cropping intensity. Overall, climate change is expected to \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  crop  intensities  in  reservoir-backed  irrigation  systems,  but  more \nintense rainfall and flood flows will need improved drainage infrastructure.  \n \n9. \nInstitutional  and  governance  reforms  to  improve  water  management.  Myanmar \nneeds to  strengthen its institutional and legal framework for IWRM and irrigation management. \nIrrigation  is  still  guided  by  the  Burma  Canal  Act  of  1905  and  it  is  not  covered  by  the  2006 \nConservation  of Water  Resources  and  Rivers  Law,  which  focuses  on  river  navigation  and  the \nrole of the Ministry of Transport. No national body exists to coordinate water resources, but the \nMOALI  recognizes  the  need  to  continue  developing  policies,  legislation,  and  institutions  to \nstrengthen IWRM. In 2013, the Ministry of Transport received support from the Government of \nthe  Netherlands  to  develop  an  IWRM  strategy.13 An  ADB  TA  is  supporting  the  IWRM  strategy \nthrough water allocation and water demand modeling in the Samon River Basin in  the CDZ. 14 \nThese  efforts  should  help  to  identify  pathways  to  raising  water  productivity  at  the  basin  level. \nIrrigation  service  fees  are  currently  set  very  low  at  MK1,950  per  acre,  and  revenue  flows  are \nreduced  by  weak  collection  arrangements.  Nevertheless,  agricultural  production  and  irrigation \nwater productivity can be increased by establishing key performance indicators related to crop \nareas  and  the  reliability,  timeliness,  and  equity  of  water  supply  and  by  introducing  asset \nmanagement systems for improved operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \n10. \nGovernment  strategy.  The  current  policy  environment  is  favorable  to  medium-term \nagriculture sector growth, enhanced by agricultural policy liberalization and a raft of reforms and \nlegislation since 2011. The newly elected government sees agricultural development as critical \nto achieving inclusive growth, developing market mechanisms, creating social stability between \nagriculture-based  ethnic  communities,  and  accelerating  rural  development  and  poverty \nreduction.  The  government\u2019s  5\u2013year  agriculture  sector  plan  sets  key  objectives  to  improve \nirrigation  and  flood  protection,  crop  production,  and  agro-industry;  and  to  strengthen  markets, \nhuman  resource  development,  and  research.15 It  aims  to  increase  cropping  intensity  to  160% \nand  irrigated  area  to  2.25  million  ha  by  2021.  In  2016,  the  former  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nIrrigation was merged with the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries, and Rural Development to create \nthe MOALI. A single ministry will be better able than its predecessors to coordinate whole farm \ndevelopment of crops, improvement of on-farm and nonfarm livelihoods, and promotion of value \nchains.  In  addition  to  contributing  to  the  5-year  plan  targets,  the  project  is  aligned  with \nMyanmar\u2019s long-term national comprehensive development plan and its rice sector development \n\n                                                \n13 P.  van  Meel  et  al..  2014.

Consistent with the sector modality, the project \naddresses  key  aspects  of  Myanmar\u2019s  agriculture  sector  5-year  plan  and  associated  sector \nstrategies  (footnotes  15  and  16).  It  will  support  their  implementation  and  help  in  developing \nrelevant  sector  policies  within  the  MOALI.  It  includes  components  that  will  help  diversify \nagriculture,  modernize  irrigation,  promote  private  sector  development,  and  enhance  human \nresources. By targeting the CDZ, the project will focus on one of the most food-insecure, water-\nstressed,  climate-sensitive,  and  natural  resource-poor  regions  in  Myanmar.  Uncertain  climatic \nconditions  make  well-functioning  irrigation  systems  critical  to  successful  crop  production  and \nsustaining  the  livelihoods  of  farmers  and  farm  workers.  Demand  growth  is  strongest  in  the \ndiversification of  crops  such  as oilseeds and  pulses and commercial  horticultural  crops. When \ncombined  with  help  to  develop  farmer  associations  and  establish  linkages  with  local  private \nsector  companies  for  improved  market  access,  the  cultivation  of  these  crops  offers  the  best \nprospects for boosting agricultural profitability.  \n \nADB  experience  and  lessons  learned.  This  will  be  the  first  ADB-financed  irrigation \n12. \nproject  in  Myanmar  since  restarting  operations  in  2012,  but  ADB  regional  post-evaluation \nstudies indicate that, along with infrastructure improvements, the outcomes of irrigation projects \nare enhanced when combined with agricultural support services and comprehensive policy and \ninstitutional reforms to promote agricultural value chains.  ADB irrigation projects have a mixed \ntrack  record  in  participatory  irrigation  management  and  management  transfer.  Recognizing \nthese  lessons,  the  project  will  include  a  diagnostic  assessment  of  agricultural  diversification \noptions and a participatory assessment of system-wide irrigation modernization needs to inform \ntraining  programs  and  extension  needs.  It  will  include  a  revision  of  design  standards  as \nappropriate and consideration of financing options for O&M costs. Capacity building for MOALI\u2019s \nIrrigation  and  Water  Utilization  Management  Department  (IWUMD)  and  water  users\u2019  groups \n(WUGs) will strengthen irrigation system management.  \n \n13. \nDevelopment  coordination.  Development  partners  such  as  AFD,  the  International \nFund for Agriculture Development, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World \nBank  are  reengaging  in  the  agriculture  sector  in  Myanmar.  They  are  working  with  MOALI  to \nintroduce  regional  and  global  best  practices  in  the  CDZ  to  achieve  sustainable  smallholder \nagriculture, irrigation, and rural development. Projects have complementary objectives and take \na  coherent  approach  to  sector  development  and  improvement  of  irrigated  and  rain-fed \nagriculture. Development partners avoid duplication by covering different areas of the CDZ, but \npromote consistency to ensure coordination, lesson sharing, and wide synergy. 17 \n\n \n14. \nAlignment  with  ADB  strategies  and  plans.  The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s  interim \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  2012\u20132014  (extended  to  2016) 18 and  the  proposed  country \npartnership strategy, 2017\u20132021 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \n2016\u20132018.

These  impacts  are  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  midterm \nagriculture  sector  plan  (footnote  15).  The  outcome  will  be  income  increased  and  poverty \nreduced for rural populations in the project areas. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nOutput 1: Effective agricultural value chains in oilseeds, pulses, and horticultural \ncrops developed. To diversify agriculture and promote exports, the project will support farmers, \nlandless  communities,  and  other  key  participants  in  the  four  project  districts  to  develop  and \npromote  agricultural  value  chains  for  oilseeds,  pulses,  and  horticultural  crops. 21  Key \ninterventions will include the (i) establishment of district-level hub frontline centers, to serve as a \nlink  between  government  and  private  sector,  with  provision  for  market  promotion  and \ncollaboration with commodity associations and chambers of commerce, development of market \ninformation systems, and facilitation of contract farming ventures with smallholder farmer groups \nand  cooperatives;  (ii)  establishment  of  irrigation  system-or  township-level  satellite  frontline \ncenters to support agricultural coordination committees (ACCs), through organization of farmer \nand producer groups, delivery of improved seed and inputs, provision of mechanization services, \nand post-harvest operations, and (iii) promotion of climate-smart agriculture. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Reliability  of  agricultural  water  supplies  improved  and  irrigated  area \nincreased. The project will support rehabilitation, modernization, and improved management of \nabout five irrigation systems to improve the reliability of water supplies  to about 20,000 ha22 of \nirrigated  land  within  Magway,  Meiktila,  Shwebo,  and  Yamethin  districts.  It  will  (i)  finance  the \nplanning,  design,  supervision,  civil  works,  and  materials  to  improve  irrigation  infrastructure;23 \nand (ii) improve irrigation management from the township to the tertiary levels through capacity \nbuilding within the IWUMD, the ACCs and their subsidiary committees, and WUGs. Activities will \ninclude the introduction of asset management, improvement of reservoir operations, agricultural \nplanning,  and  irrigation  scheduling,  and  performance  monitoring.  WUGs  will  be  developed \nincrementally starting from the existing farmer-led management arrangements. The project will \npromote active participation by irrigation system users in the design of infrastructure and provide \ngender-inclusive training on system O&M, water management, and governance. \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 2015.

The government has requested \na  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR53,830,000  ($75  million)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-\nyear  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  loan  agreement.  The  government  will  finance  taxes  and  duties.  The  financing  plan  is  in \nTable 2. \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n  \n  \n\n  \n\nItem \nA.  Base Costb \n \n\n1.

The TA is estimated \nto  cost  $5.32  million,  of  which  $4.79  million  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Global \nEnvironment Facility and administered by ADB. The TA will be implemented over 5 years from \nMarch  2017  to  March  2022.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ntechnical direction and guidance, support staff, hosting of the project management unit (PMU), \noffice  supplies,  domestic  transportation,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.27 The  TA  will  design \nand pilot-test training and capacity development packages in the Mae Nyo Taung forest reserve \nin  Meiktila  district  and  scale  up  good  practices  in  an  additional  5\u20137  forest  reserve  areas.  The \nMinistry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental  Conservation  will  serve  as  the  executing \nagency and work closely with the MOALI to ensure protection and sustainable management of \nthe catchments in the CDZ, mitigating erosion and associated sedimentation in irrigated areas.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n27 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8  \n\n \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n22. \nIn accordance with the sector project approach, 11 potential irrigation subprojects were \nstudied  in  four  CDZ  districts  under  the  project  preparatory  TA.  Nine  of  these  were  ranked  by \neconomic  viability  for  possible  inclusion  in  the  sector  project.  The  two  core  subprojects, \nNatmauk in Magway district and Chaungmagyi in Yamethin district, were taken to the feasibility \nstudy  level  based  on  their  economic  viability  and  technical  feasibility.  Additional  subprojects, \nincluding the noncore subprojects, will be selected for project inclusion based on the selection \ncriteria in the PAM. The detailed design for the Chaungmagyi system is under way to advance \nproject  readiness  for  implementation.  Government  stakeholders,  WUGs,  and  farmers  will \nparticipate  in  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and  management  of  the  irrigation  systems. \nConsultations with women will be emphasized to develop WUGs in gender-sensitive ways. \n\n23. \nThe identification, adaptation, and dissemination of farming technologies and knowledge \nsuited to enhancing agriculture in the CDZ will be key to achieving a successful project outcome. \nThis  will  involve  the  latest  technologies,  particularly  the  introduction  of  good  agricultural \npractices and climate-smart agriculture interventions incorporating efficient water management, \nimproved  crop  production  technologies  suited  for  the  CDZ,  including  legume  based  farming \nsystems,  cereal-legume  crop  rotations,  drought  and  salinity  resistant  rice  varieties,  improved \ndrying  and  storage  facilities,  logistics  and  enhanced  private  sector  linkages.  The  frontline \ncenters  will  provide  appropriate  training,  extension  and  farm  advisory  services  based  on  the \nfarmers\u2019 needs and technical constraints, farming systems, and market opportunities. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nEconomic analyses were conducted for the two core subprojects. The investment costs \ncover  value  chain  development  and  irrigation  system  rehabilitation  and  management.  Several \nbenefit  categories  were  quantified  and  assessed:  (i) yield  improvement,  (ii)  cropping  pattern \nchanges, and (iii) cultivation area expansion. National reforms to be undertaken separately but \nconcurrent with project implementation will reduce transaction costs and losses during milling or \nprocessing  and  translate  into  higher  profit  margins  for  farmers,  but  this  was  not  considered  in \nthe  economic  analysis.  On  an  incremental  basis,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nChaungmagyi subproject was estimated at 13.6% and that of Natmauk subproject at 16.8%.28  \n \n25. \nFinancial and sustainability analyses were conducted to determine the financial viability \nof  the  project.  The  government\u2019s  annual  costs  for  O&M  were  estimated  to  be  1.5%  of  total \nrehabilitation  costs,  or  $69,000  for  the  Chaungmagyi  system  and  $190,000  for  Natmauk. \nCurrent government O&M budgets are constrained and irregular, but analysis indicates that the \ngovernment  could  fund  projected  O&M  expenses  without  creating  a  fiscal  burden.  The  works \nimprovements  under  the  project  will  substantially  reduce  O&M  costs  for  the  project  systems. \nManagement  efficiency  enhancements  at  IWUMD,  support  for  asset  management,  and  the \nestablishment of WUGs will also contribute to reducing the overall O&M burden. Calculations of \nwith-  and  without-project  crop  budgets  for  different  commodities  indicated  that  overall,  the \nproject will substantially increase the yields and net incomes of beneficiary farmers.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nGovernment  accounting  manuals  and  practices  do  not  fully  meet  ADB\u2019s  requirements. \n\n26. \n                                                \n28 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nThe financial management and procurement assessments noted that the MOALI\u2019s systems and \ncapacity  are  both  weak.  Internal  audits  are  a  relatively  new  requirement.  To  address  these \nissues,  a  PMU  will  be  established  with  dedicated  procurement  and  financial  support  staff  and \nproject-specific accounting systems to ensure accuracy in financial reporting. Training on ADB \nprocurement and disbursement policies and procedures will be conducted before project start-\nup.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith the government. The specific project requirements are described in the PAM. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nConsistent with government poverty and social objectives, the project is expected to help \nsignificantly  in  reducing  poverty  in  the  project  areas.29 Household  incomes  will  be  augmented \nfrom increases in the value of and returns from agricultural production and higher returns from \nlabor.  Specialized  good  agricultural  practice  support  will  be  provided  to  both female  and  male \nfarmers,  and  training  will  be  conducted  for  the  IWUMD,  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  and \nfarmers. The project will create 2,500 person-years of direct employment during construction. \n \n28. \nThe  project  supports  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been \nprepared  to  ensure  that  women  have  access  to  project  benefits,  including  credit,  technology, \nand markets.30  Women will make up at least 30% of all those receiving training, of participants \nin farmer field schools, and of the memberships of common interest groups and WUGs.  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nThe project is classified under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) as category B \nfor  environment.  An  environmental  assessment review  framework  has  been  prepared to  cover \nthe  project  areas  and  guide  the  preparation  and  assessment  of  subprojects. 31  Initial \nenvironmental  examinations  were  prepared  for  the  two  core  subprojects.32 Excessive  use  of \nfertilizer  and  pesticide  could  impact  drinking  water  sources  through  waste  disposal  and \nagricultural  drainage;  water  quality  will  therefore  be  monitored.  The  initial  environmental \nexaminations concluded that all adverse impacts associated with the project will be prevented, \neliminated,  or  minimized  to  an  acceptable  level  if  the  mitigation  and  management  measures \ndefined in the environmental management plans are properly implemented.  \n \n30. \nThe project is classified category B under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for \nboth involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (ethnic groups). A resettlement and ethnic \ngroups  framework  (REGF)  was  prepared  to  guide  the  preparation  of  resettlement  and  ethnic \ngroups  plans  or  resettlement  plans  for  individual  subprojects,  as  appropriate.33 Due  diligence \nwas  carried  out  for  the  two  core  subprojects  to  identify  potential  ethnic  minority  or  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. Preliminary designs for these subprojects indicate that all \nworks  will  be  within  existing  canal  rights-of-way.  Resettlement  plans  were  not  prepared  at  the \nfeasibility  stage  because  final  designs  will  be  developed  in  a  participatory  manner  during \nimplementation.  A  safeguards  due  diligence  report  has  been  prepared.  The  project  may  have \nminor involuntary resettlement impacts due to encroachment by farmers on land within existing \nsubproject rights-of-way. This may mean the temporary loss by such farmers of crops or assets \non these small areas. Compensation will be provided in accordance with the REGF. Since the \n                                                \n29 Project beneficiaries will include marginal landholders, sharecroppers, landless, and destitute women. \n30 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Resettlement and Ethnic Groups Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10  \n\n \n\nlocations  of  the  subsequent  noncore  subprojects  have  yet  to  be  determined,  small  direct  or \nindirect  but  so  far  unanticipated  impacts  on  ethnic  groups  may  arise.  In  these  cases, \nresettlement and ethnic group plans will be prepared based on the REGF.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 Overall, project risk is assessed as medium, \nand the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe government fails to sustain \nthe reform processes related to \ninputs, farming, and markets. \nWater availability for irrigated \nagriculture declines due to \nclimate change. \nMOALI and farmers fail to \nproperly operate and maintain \nthe rehabilitated infrastructure. \nGovernance: weak procurement \nand financial management \ncapacity of the executing and \nimplementing agencies. \nAsIF = Asian Investment Facility; MOALI = Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Irrigation; O&M = operation and \nmaintenance; TA = technical assistance; WUGs = water users\u2019 groups. \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessments. \n \n\nThis risk is external to the project, but policy assistance is being provided to \nMOALI through AsIF financing to address good agricultural practices, land tenure \nissues, and integrated water resources management. This reduces this risk. \nThis risk will be reduced by the project through efficiencies in systems design, \nirrigation management, reservoir operation, and integrated water resources \nmanagement. The attached TA will promote water catchment protection. \nThe project will provide support and training in O&M for farmer beneficiaries and \nWUGs, as well as MOALI\u2019s system-level operators, as well as policies and \ninstitutional mechanisms for WUGs and O&M, through AsIF financing. \nA project management unit will be established within MOALI to include \nprocurement, accounting, and financial management specialists. The project will \nprovide the unit\u2019s staff with support for advance contracting and capacity building. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \n32. \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the  PAM \nand  loan  documents.  ADB  will  disburse  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  once  (i)  a  PMU  has  been \nestablished  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  and  (ii)  PMU  staff  has  been  trained  in  financial \nmanagement. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which \nare set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n33. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR53,830,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Union  of  Myanmar  for  the \nIrrigated Agriculture Inclusive Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n7 November 2016\n                                                \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n \n\nData Sources \nand Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \na\u2013b Project \nmonitoring \nsystem, DOA \nrecords, ADB \nmission reports \n\n \n1a\u20131d Project \nmonitoring \nsystem, \nIWUMD \nrecords, DOA \nrecords, ADB \nmission reports \n\nRisks \n\n \nThe government fails to \nsustain the reform \nprocesses related to \ninputs, farming, and post-\nharvest markets. \nMOALI and farmers fail to \nproperly operate and \nmaintain the rehabilitated \ninfrastructure. \n \nFarmers do not execute \nchanges in farming \nsystems or water \nmanagement. \n \n\n2a\u20132d Project \nmonitoring \nsystem, \nIWUMD \nrecords, DOA \nrecords, ADB \nmission reports \n\nNot enough data is \navailable for design \nsubproject civil works. \nFinancial management \nand procurement systems \nfor the project are slow \nand/or ineffective. \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpacts the Project is Aligned With: \nFood security for domestic consumption and higher nutritional value by all citizens attained. \nSocioeconomic status of rural people through increased agricultural productivity enhanced. \nQuality and standard of agricultural products to compete in international markets improved. \n(Agriculture Sector Second Five-Year Plan (2016/2017-2020/2021.)a \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nIncome increased \nand poverty \nreduced for rural \npopulations in the \nproject areas  \n\nOutputs \n1.
