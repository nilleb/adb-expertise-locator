The \nProject  will  also \nroad \nmaintenance  by  securing  appropriate  government  budget  for \nmaintenance  and  by  promoting  private  sector  participation  in \nroad maintenance.  \n\nimprove  periodic  and \n\nroutine \n\nIn 2002 the Government developed NLTP with the assistance \nof  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID, \nUnited  Kingdom)  as  covenanted  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) loan for the Road Maintenance and Improvement \nProject.  The  draft  NLTP  is  with  the  cabinet  for  review  and \napproval.  It  is  commendable  that  the  Government  has \nrecognized  the  urgency  of  sectoral  and  institutional reforms. \nTo  ensure  implementation  of  NLTP,  the  Project  will  prepare \nthe sector road map in consultation with the Government and \nset  the  milestones  for  key  reform  measures  to  be  achieved \nwithin  a  certain  timeframe,  which  are  linked  to  further \nprocessing  of  the  Project  and  provision  of  ADB\u2019s  next  loan \nproject, programmed for 2006.  \n\nCompared  with  national  and  regional  roads,  about  96%  of \nwhich are paved, district roads, which are mostly used by rural \nfarmers  to  access  markets  or  social  facilities,  have  only  60\u2013\n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\n65% pavement ratio. Because of the poor condition of district \nroads,  rural  farmers\u2019  connection  to  national  markets  or \neducation or health facilities, which are located in commercial \ncenters connected by national roads, is limited. There is need \nfor  complementary  improvement  of  national,  regional,  and \ndistrict roads to develop an integrated road network to link the \nrural poor to economic opportunities.  \n \nIn  1998  India  and  Nepal  signed  the  Phulbari  agreement  to \nallow  Nepalese  shipments  to  move  freely  through  the  43-\nkilometer  strip  in  India  connecting  to  Bangladesh,  increasing \ntraffic across the border. However, the intended benefits have \nnot  fully  accrued  because  of  poor  land  port  facilities  in \nBanglabandh  and  narrow  and  poorly  maintained  border \naccess roads in Bangladesh. As the Government improves the \nland  port  facilities,  however,  cross-border  traffic  through \nBanglabandh  will  grow  substantially.  Improving  the  border \naccess  road  to  Banglabandh  will  maximize  the  benefits  of \ngovernment  and  aid  agency  initiatives  for  regional  economic \ncooperation.  \n \nAlthough  the  major  strategic  corridors  are  almost  completed \nover  the  past  decades  by  coordinated  efforts  between  the \nGovernment  and  aid  agencies,  some  missing  links  remain  in \nmajor  road  networks  that  cause  serious  bottleneck  and \nsubstantial  economic  cost  to  the  country.  Completing  the \nmissing links in the main road network should be given a high \npriority to better use existing road infrastructure. \n \nThe  Project  will  help \nthe  Government  achieve  poverty \nreduction  through  economic  growth  by  improving  transport \nefficiency  and  strengthening  integrated  road  networks.  The \nProject  will  (i)  facilitate  the  Government  to  implement  the \nsector  and  institutional  reform  measures  envisaged  in  NLTP; \n(ii)  improve  national,  regional,  and  district  roads  to  provide \nrural  farmers  with  better  access  to  markets,  social  services, \nand employment opportunities, to provide better access to the \nborder  point  in  Banglabandh,  and  to  complete  some  missing \nlinks  in  the  main  road  network;  (iii)  secure  Government \nresources for periodic road maintenance; (iv) promote private \nsector  participation  in  road  maintenance;  (v)  improve  road \nsafety;  (vi)  privatize  the  operation  of  5  vehicle  inspection \ncenters; and (vii) improve public awareness for HIV/ AIDS1 and \ntrafficking of women.  \n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $187.1 million equivalent, \ncomprising  foreign  exchange  of  $75.0  million  and  local \ncurrency of $112.1 million equivalent.  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n________________________  \n1 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nv\n\n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n\n \n \n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \n\nSource \n\nADB-ADF  \nGovernment \nTotal \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n75.0 \n0.0 \n75.0 \n\n       ($ million) \n\n \n\n \nLocal \nCurrency \n51.0 \n61.1 \n112.1 \n\nTotal \nCost \n126.0 \n61.1 \n187.1 \n\n% \n\n67.3 \n32.7 \n100.0 \n\n   ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \n \n\nSource: ADB staff. \n\n \nA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing \nRights 88,125,000 ($126 million equivalent) will be provided.  \nThe loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project  \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\nUntil 30 December 2008 \n\n30 June 2008 \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nRoads and Highways Department for road improvement, road \nmaintenance, and road safety. \n\nBangladesh  Road  Transport  Authority  for  vehicle  inspection \ncenter privatization.  \n\nMinistry  of  Women\u2019s  and  Children\u2019s  Affairs  for  raising  public \nawareness of HIV/AIDS and trafficking of women.  \n\nresponsibility \n\nfor  periodic \n\nThe Project will be implemented by a project management unit \nheaded  by  an  additional  chief  engineer  and  project  director. \nThe  project  director  will  report  to  the  chief  engineer  of  RHD \nand  be  supported  by  an  additional  project  director  and  three \nexecutive engineers as project managers responsible for day-\nto-day  project  implementation.

The task team will be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project  and \nreport to the engineering of BRTA.  \n\nFor  improvement  of  public  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and \ntrafficking  of  women,  a  steering  committee  headed  by \nSecretary, Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MOWCA) \nwill  be  established  consisting  of  the  senior  assistant  chief  of \nthe MOWCA, the project director in RHD, and nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs).

Besides \n\n(i)  design  performance-based \n\nConsulting services will be required to supervise civil works for \nroad \nimprovement  and  periodic  road  maintenance.  An \ninternational  consulting  firm  will  do  this  in  association  with \nsupervision, \ndomestic \nconsultants  will \nroad \nmaintenance and implement supervision maintenance; and (ii) \nassess  the  safety  of  existing  roads,  develop  a  black-spot \nimprovement  plan,  and  procure  and  supervise  civil  works. \nConsulting  services  will  also  be  required  to  (i)  prepare  a \ndetailed  design  for  the  proposed  road  sector  development \nproject, (ii) manage privatization of vehicle inspection centers, \n(iii)  prepare  the  road  master  plan,  and  (iv)  audit  project \naccounts  for  the  Project\u2019s  periodic  and  random  procurement \naudits.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. \n\nThe  direct  and  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  Project  consist  of \nsavings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  to  normal  and \ndiverted  traffic,  where  applicable,  and  savings  in  time. \nNonquantifiable  benefits  include  greater  passenger  comfort \nand  reduced  cargo  damage.  Indirect  benefits  arise  from \nsecondary  effects  of  reduced  VOCs  and  time  costs,  which \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \nvii \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nlead  to  increased  economic  activities.  These  benefits  have \nbeen estimated as generated passenger and cargo traffic.  \n\nThe  beneficiaries  are  the  various  categories  of  road  users: \nowners/operators  of  buses  and  trucks,  passengers,  cargo \nowners, and the population in the Project area. Benefits in the \nform of lower VOCs enjoyed by vehicle owners/operators are \nexpected \nthe  various \nstakeholders as the transport industry is competitive. \n\nto  be  distributed  widely  among \n\nlenders,  who  also  subsidize \n\nAnalysis  of  the  project  effects  on  road  users,  construction \nworkers,  Government,  and  lenders  shows  benefit  distribution \namong  road  users  and  considers  the  negative  or  positive \neffects  on  (i)  the  Government  and  the  economy  in  general  (a \nnegative  effect)  by  way  of  the  subsidy  the  Government \nprovides to road users by funding part of the construction cost; \nthrough \n(ii) \nconcessional  loan  terms;  and  (iii)  construction  workers,  who \ngain because their wages are higher than the opportunity cost \nof their labor. When gains and losses of all parties are netted, \na poverty impact ratio, expressing the proportion of net benefit \naccruing to the poor, was calculated as 0.60 for district roads, \n0.63 for border access roads, and 0.34 for missing links. In the \ncase of border access roads, about 6% of project benefits are \nfound to accrue to Nepali cargo owners.  \n\nroad  users \n\nTo \n\nand \n\ntimely \n\nfacilitate \n\nThe main risk is that prolonged resettlement will delay project \nimplementation. \neffective \nimplementation and monitoring of the resettlement plan, RHD \nwill  hire  NGOs  to  process  and  resolve  all  resettlement \nproblems.  A  district  coordination  mechanism  will  be \nestablished  to  resolve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nissues.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  counterpart  funding  is  another  risk  factor \nthat  needs  close  attention  during  implementation,  particularly \nfor periodic maintenance, because it requires 70% government \nfinancing,  which  is  much  higher  than  usual.  The  Project  has \nthus  obtained  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  not  only  for \ngeneral  assurance  about  counterpart  funding  but  also  for \nspecific assurances such as increasing annual  revenue budget \nallocation  for  periodic  road  maintenance.  If,  however,  a  road \nfund is created by the end of 2005 as covenanted, this risk will \nbe  dramatically  mitigated  because  counterpart  funding will be \nsourced  from  the  road  fund,  which  will  not  be  affected  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal situation. \n \nThe expected benefits from the improvement of border access \nroad,  Panchagahr-Banglabandh,  will  accrue  only  when \nlandport facilities in Banglabandh are  improved as pursued by \nthe  Government.

The progress of BOT concessioning will \nbe  closely  monitored  and,  if  necessary,  ADB  will  provide \nassistance  to  ensure  the  success  of  BOT  investment  in  the \nBanglabandh land port. \n \nThe  important  risk  is  that  the  Government  would  lose  their \ninterest  in  sector  reform  that  was  initiated  and  maintained  by \nfrom  aid  agencies  and  recently \ncoordinated \nculminated  with  several  landmark  achievements  of  reform \ninitiatives. To keep this momentum, aid agencies will continue \nto closely coordinate, provide financial and technical support to \nassist  the  Government  in  achieving  the  sector  road  map,  and \nmake  unified  voice  in  terms  of  future  institutional  and  sector \nreform \nInstitutional \nDevelopment Component 3 (IDC3), World Bank\u2019s sector reform \nproject in 2005, and ADB\u2019s road sector development project in \n2006 will be formulated in close consultation and gather forces \nto leverage Government\u2019s continuing interest in sector reform. \n\nin  Bangladesh.

The  primary  road  network  connecting \nnational and regional roads and district roads comprises 20,800 km,1 while the secondary roads \ntotal 115,000 km. National and regional roads and district roads are administered by the Roads \nand  Highways  Department  (RHD)  within  the  Ministry  of  Communications  (MOC).  Secondary \nroads  are  administered  by  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  within the \nlocal government division. \n \n3. \nThe  performance  of  the  road  sector  has  consistently  improved  in  the  past  decades, \naided by extension of the road network and demand for road transport that increased rapidly at \nan average annual rate of 8.4% for passengers and 8.2% for freight during the 1990s, or almost \ndouble  the  average  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  4.7%.  The  modal  share  of \ntransport  has  gradually  shifted  in  favor  of  roads.  From  1975  to  1997  the  modal  share  of  road \ntransport rose from 54% to 73% for passenger traffic, and from 35% to 63% for freight. Roads \nhave become the principal mode of transport.  \n \n4. \nRoads  are  important  for  regional  cooperation,  which  constitutes  ADB\u2019s  long-term \ndevelopment  strategy.  At  the  center  of  the  South  Asia  growth  quadrangle  and  surrounded  by \nIndia,  Nepal,  Bhutan,  and  Myanmar,  Bangladesh  will  accommodate  most  intraregional  transit \nshipments  in  the  region.  Asian  Highways,  conceived  and  pursued  by  the  United  Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP) to set up a road network linking \nAsia  and  Europe,  will  pass  through  Bangladesh,  making  it  the  link  between  South  and \nSoutheast Asia. ADB\u2019s assistance for the road sector in Bangladesh should foster a conducive \nenvironment for regional cooperation and maximize the development impact over South Asia.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Land Transport Policy \n\n \nIn  2002  the  Government  developed  the  national  land  transport  policy  (NLTP)  with  the \n5. \nassistance  of  Department \nInternational  Development  (DFID),  United  Kingdom,  as \ncovenanted  by  ADB\u2019s  loan  for  the  Road  Maintenance  and  Improvement  Project.2  The  draft \nNLTP is with the Cabinet for review and approval. NLTP will change the way the road sector is \nplanned and managed by (i) promoting greater private sector participation and (ii) fostering the \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1   The  primary  road  network  comprises  3,086  km  of  national  roads,  1,751  km  of  regional roads, and 15,962 km of \n\ndistrict roads. District roads are the ones connecting national and regional roads.  \n\n2   ADB. 2000.

Main  thrusts  of  NLTP  are  summarized  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoads and Highways Department \n\n \n6. \nRHD was founded in 1962, with 5,000 personnel, and 1,150 km of paved road under its \njurisdiction.  RHD  grew  steadily,  and  now  has  20,000  personnel  looking  after  20,800  km  of \nprimary  roads.  RHD  consists  of  three  wings  (mechanical,  technical  services,  and  network \nmanagement and build-operate-transfer [BOT]) and seven field zones, each headed by a chief \nengineer who reports directly to the chief engineer.  \n \n7. \nRHD has achieved its mission successfully, completing the five strategic road corridors \nwith the assistance of aid agencies. However, RHD now needs to be restructured as the nature \nof its road works has changed substantially:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nRHD  road  works  have  become  more  complex  and  sophisticated,  i.e.,  planning \nnow  requires  more  advanced  techniques,  bridge  design  and  construction  are \nmore  complex,  financial  and  physical  accounting  and  reporting  systems  are \nbecoming  more  complex,  and  pressure  is  greater  to  improve  the  quality  of  all \nworks; \n\n(ii)  With the major road network now almost complete, the emphasis of RHD\u2019s work \nmoves  from  construction  to  maintenance,  which  is  not  technically  complex  but \nrequires a high level of planning and management; and \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii)  Most construction and maintenance used to be carried out by RHD, which also \nsupplied labor, equipment, and materials. These functions are now mostly carried \nout under contract, with the private sector playing the major role.  \n\n \n8. \nDFID financed Institutional Development Component 3 (IDC3) of the World Bank\u2019s Third \nRoad Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project, approved in 1998, to strengthen the institutional \ncapacity of RHD and reorganize it. Successful implementation of IDC3 has rationalized RHD\u2019s \noperations in many ways: (i) RHD is now run according to modern management methods; (ii) \nroad  transport  planning  capability  is  sustainable;  (iii)  the  Road  Safety  Cell  in  the  Bangladesh \nRoad  Transport  Authority  (BRTA)  is  now  functioning,  providing  road  safety  information, \nplanning,  coordination,  and  publicity  services;  (iv)  sustainable  work-based training and human \nresources  development  capability  are  developed  by  the  RHD  Training  Center;  (v)  RHD\u2019s  \nfinancial  management  has  been  improved  by  a  financial  management  unit;  and  (vi)  computer \nnetworks and a management information system are operational.  \n \nIDC3  also  drew  up  a  new  organizational  structure  for  RHD,  defining  its  mission  as  (i) \n9. \nprovision of a safe, cost-effective, and well-maintained major road network; and (ii) delivery of \nthe  full  range  of  responsibilities  in  respect  of  main  road  and  bridge  network  with  clear \naccountability.  The  proposed  RHD  structure  consists  of  five  headquarter  wings  (technical \nservices,  planning  and  maintenance,  bridge  management,  management  services,  and \nmechanical) and seven field zones, each headed by a chief engineer. One chief engineer has \nbeen  assigned  to  manage  World  Bank  projects  and  another  one  to  manage  ADB  projects.  In \nNovember 2002 MOC ratified this new organizational structure. DFID will help RHD finalize job \ndescriptions  of  staff;  prepare  a  restructuring  action  plan;  and  complete  circle  operation  plans, \noperational  procedures,  management  manuals,  staff  professional  development  plans,  and \ndepartmental training plans.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n3\n\n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n \n10. \nRHD\u2019s  road  network  is  estimated  at  $7.4  billion.  Annual  preventive  maintenance  is \nestimated  to  cost  $100  million.3  Actual  spending,  however,  is  around  $44  million,  with  the \nconsequent shortfall adding up to the maintenance backlog of $450 million. RHD is thus shifting \nits focus from road development to road maintenance. Under IDC3, RHD developed an annual \nroad  maintenance  plan  (ARMP),  which  uses  the  highway  design  and  maintenance  standards \nmodel (HDM) to determine which roads should be maintained for the year and at what level.  \n \n11. \nStrengthening institutional focus on road maintenance will, however, have only a limited \neffect unless additional sources of road maintenance financing are established. For the past 5 \nyears,  no  more  than  20\u201325%  of  road  sector  revenue4  has  been  spent  to  maintain  RHD  and \nLGED  roads.  NLTP  urges  the  establishment  of  a  sustainable  funding  mechanism  for  road \nmaintenance by earmarking part of the fuel tax levy or introducing an additional road fuel levy. \nThe  Government  plans  to  eliminate  backlog  maintenance  in  20  years  and  to  create  no  more \nonce a sustainable funding mechanism is in place.  \n \n12. \nApart from finding a sustainable financing mechanism for road maintenance, continuing \nattention was paid to the shortfall of government resources for periodic road maintenance and \nthe  increasing  backlog  of  deferred  maintenance.  The  World  Bank  provided  $70  million  for \nperiodic  maintenance  over  2000\u20132004  through  its  Road  Rehabilitation  and  Maintenance \nProject.  ADB\u2019s  past  two  road  projects  attempted  to  reduce  the  increasing  backlog  by \nencouraging  the  Government  to  commit  more  of  its  annual  budget  to  periodic  road \nmaintenance.  ADB  allocated  $15.8  million  for  periodic  road  maintenance  and  required  the \nGovernment  to  pay  70%  of  the  cost  of periodic maintenance carried out through the projects, \nwhich  will  enable  the  Government  to  source  $47  million  to  finance  500  km  of  periodic \nmaintenance for 5 years.    \n \n\n5. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n13. \nThe fatality rate on the road network remains the highest in South Asia, with the number \nof people reported killed increasing from 955 in 1983 to 3,162 in 1997, for an annual fatality rate \nof 73 per 10,000 motor vehicles, double that in other South Asian countries, and several times \nhigher  than  that  in  Europe.  The  causes  of the significantly increased accident rate are mainly \noverspeeding,  overloading,  and  overtaking  by  motor  vehicles.  Unregulated  movement  of \nnonmotorized vehicles along with motorized vehicles on the same route is also a major cause of \nroad accidents and traffic congestion.  \n \n14. \nTo address the safety issue more systematically, RHD established an independent road \ndesign  and  safety  circle  (RDSC),  which  monitors  road  safety  throughout  RHD  and  prepares \nmanuals for road safety and road design. RDSC also introduced a road safety audit program for \nRHD roads, and prepared a road safety manual with an institutionalized systematic method to \nidentify hazards on new and existing roads.   \n \n15.  While RHD addresses road safety through engineering solutions such as a road safety \naudit, the National Road Safety Council (NRSC) leads national activities to improve road safety. \nNRSC set up district and municipal committees and carried out the initial public campaigns, bus \n\n                                                 \n3 RHD. (2001). Towards Effective Asset Management of Roads and Bridges. February. \n4 Road sector revenue consists of  taxes and duties on fuel, taxes and duties on vehicle imports, taxes and duties on \nvehicle parts and accessory imports, taxes and fees on vehicle registration, and toll collection on ferries and bridges.  \n\n\f4\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndriver-truck  driver-training  programs,  and  overloading  awareness  campaigns. The road safety \ncell established in BRTA provides secretariat services to NRSC and coordinates all road safety \nactivities.  \n \n\n6. \n\nManagement of Air Pollution \n\n \n16. \nVehicles  in  Bangladesh  have  been  increasing  rapidly  in  the  past  decade,  with  many \nurban  centers,  particularly  Dhaka  and  Chittagong,  experiencing  phenomenal  increases  in  air \npollution due in large part to vehicle emissions. The problem is compounded by an aging vehicle \nfleet,  substandard  vehicle  maintenance,  and  lack  of  proper  vehicle  inspection facilities. Under \nthe Southwest Road Network Development Project,5 ADB provided technical assistance (TA) to \nformulate  a  strategy  to  improve  air  quality  in  Dhaka  and  other  major  cities,  particularly  by \nreducing  vehicular  emission.  The  study  identified  opportunities  to  introduce  technological \nchanges  to  the  use  of  compressed  natural  gas  (CNG)  for  trucks  and  buses.6  These  efforts \nresulted  in  the  Bangladesh  Road  Transport  Corporation\u2019s  introducing  CNG-powered  buses, \nwhich  provides  about  50%  savings  in  fuel  costs  and  significant  environmental  benefits  in \nreducing air pollution.  \n \n17. \nThe  most  polluting  vehicles  are  those  with  two-stroke  petrol  engines.  The  country, \nespecially Dhaka, has a large fleet of two-stroke three-wheeled vehicles, producing around 75% \nof  harmful  emissions  in  the  city.  The  Government  ordered  that  all  such  vehicles  in  Dhaka  be \nCNG-powered, then phased out, and later banned in the rest of the country. These efforts have \nsubstantially contributed to reducing air pollution in Dhaka as applauded  by road users as well \nas by most aid agencies.  \n \nUnder the Road Overlay and Improvement Project,7 ADB provided technical advice and \n18. \nfinancing  for  five  vehicle  inspection  centers  (in  Dhaka,  Chittagong,  Rajshahi,  and  Khulna)  that \nwill  issue  fitness  and  nonpollution  certificates.  Five  centers  were  built  and  sophisticated \nequipment  installed.  The  equipment,  however,  has  not  been  fully  utilized  because  of  lack  of \nexpertise in BRTA. In a loan covenant, the Southwest Road Network Development Project thus \nrequired  BRTA  to  lease  to  the  private  sector  the  operation  and  management  of  vehicle \ninspection centers by June 2001. This requirement has not been complied with because of poor \ninstitutional capacity and lack of expertise in BRTA. The project completion report of the Road \nOverlay  and  Improvement  Project8  recommended  ADB\u2019s  further  assistance  to  strengthen \nBRTA\u2019s  capacity  as  a  way  to  normalize  and  ultimately  privatize  the  operation  of  vehicle \ninspection centers.   \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\nB. \n \n\n1. \n\nDistrict Roads \n\n \n19. \nThe partnership agreement on poverty reduction concluded in April 2000 identified roads \nas  one  of  the  most  important  tools  to  reduce  poverty.  In  line  with  the  agreement,  the  road \n\n                                                 \n5 ADB. 1999.

Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n5\n\n \n\nsubsector  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  accelerating  pro-poor  economic  growth,  e.g.,  by  providing \nfarmers with access to markets and inputs; (ii) reducing obstacles to social service delivery and \nproviding access to vulnerable groups; (iii) facilitating popular participation by facilitating travel; \nand  (iv)  conducting  road  sector  operations  with  greater  public  scrutiny  and  introducing  more \nobjective and transparent approaches to resource allocation, especially for road maintenance.   \n \n20. \nSince  1977  ADB  has  provided  12  loans  totaling  $931  million  to  the  road  sector  in \nBangladesh, focusing largely on the completion of five strategic road transport corridors. Other \nmajor financiers, including the World Bank and bilateral agencies, have invested $1.8 billion in \nthe  road  sector,  also  focusing  on  strengthening  strategic  corridors.  These coordinated efforts \nconsiderably  helped  meet  the  growing  demand  for  roads  by  linking  strategic  areas  in  through \nstrategic corridors. About 96% of national and regional roads are paved.   \n \n21. \nDeveloping  an  integrated  road  network  to  link  the  rural  poor  to  economic opportunities \nshould  not  be  emphasized.  Only  65%  of  district  roads,  mostly  used  by  farmers  to  access \nmarkets or social facilities, are paved, which hinders farmers from reaching national roads and, \nconsequently,  accessing  markets  or  education  or  health  facilities,  which  are  in  commercial \ncenters.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRegional Economic Cooperation \n\n \n22. \nLandlocked  Nepal  will  benefit  from  access  to  Mongla  and  Chittagong  ports  in \nBangladesh as an alternative to Calcutta or Haldia ports, especially with the Paksey and Rupsa \nbridges being built in Bangladesh. The preferable road connection to Nepal is from Rangpur and \nBanglabandh  in  Bangladesh,  via  Phulbari  and  Silliguri  in  India,  to  the  East-West Highway at \nKakarvitta in Nepal. In 1998 India and Nepal signed the Phulbari agreement to allow Nepalese \nshipments to move through the 43 km strip in India connecting to Bangladesh. Nepalese trucks \ncross  Nepal  at  Kakarvitta  and  travel  through  Phulbari  in  India  to  enter  Bangladesh  at \nBanglabandh with Indian police escorts.  \n \n23. \nThe  intended  benefits,  however,  have  not  fully  accrued  because  of  a  number  of \nobstacles.  Banglabandh  has  no  land  port  facilities  such  as  customs  offices,  inland  container \ndepot and warehousing facilities, parking and loading and unloading areas, or banking services. \nThe  city  has  neither  formal  customs  office  nor  customs  officials.  Among  the  most  serious \nimpediments are, however, the physical constraints, i.e., capacity bottlenecks in border access \nroads  in  Bangladesh,  mainly  caused  by  narrow  roads  and  bridges  and  poor maintenance of \nborder  access  roads.  Access  roads  to  the  border  point  are  in  too  poor  a  condition  to \naccommodate transborder traffic from Nepal, especially multi-axle heavy trucks.  \n \n24. \nThe Government established the Land Port Authority (LPA) in the Ministry of Shipping in \n2001 to (i) facilitate trade with neighboring countries, (ii) increase national income through trade, \n(iii) reduce smuggling, and (iv) enable private enterprises to participate in the port services. LPA \nidentified  12  strategic  land  ports,  including  Banglabandh,  for  development  by  BOT.  Private \ndevelopers  will  design,  finance,  construct,  operate,  and  maintain  the  port  facilities,  including \nstack  yard  and  warehouse  for  storage,  transshipment  yard  facilities,  parking  areas,  and \nequipment and machinery. The land port development project has already been bidden out, and \nproposals  of  private  developers  are  under  review.  Improvement  of  border  access  roads  will \ncomplement the Government\u2019s efforts to increase trade with neighboring countries through land \nports.  \n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Panchagarh-Banglabandh  road  is  the  key  linking  route  of  Asian  Highway  2,  which \n25. \nstarts at the border between Iraq and Iran, passes through Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, \nMyanmar, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Malaysia, and ends in Singapore. \nBanglabandh  is  a  strategic  linking  point  in  Asian  Highway  2,  connecting  South  with  Southeast \nAsia,  so  its  operation  will  depend  primarily  on  the  functioning  of  the  land  port  at  Banglabandh \nand upgrading of Panchagahr-Banglabandh road to Asian Highway standards. Improvement of \nthis  border  access  road  will  improve  the  whole  stretch  of  Asian  Highway  2  and  boost  cross-\nborder  traffic  through  Banglabandh  in  parallel  with  neighboring  countries\u2019  efforts  to  promote \nregional trade. \n \n26. \nUnder the  initiatives  of  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC), \nconcerted efforts are being made in neighboring countries to improve interconnectivity. In India, \nthe West Bengal Corridor Development Project, approved in 2001, provides a backbone in West \nBengal \nfor  subregional  connectivity.  The  Subregional  Transport  Connectivity  Project, \nprogrammed  for  2004,  will  supplement  the  West  Bengal  Corridor  Development  Project  by \nproviding linkages to main commercial/production centers and the subregional transit system. In \nNepal,  the  Subregional  Roads  Connection  Project,  programmed  for  2004,  intends  to  improve \nthe  eastern  end  of  the  east-west  highway  to  establish  a  smoother  connection  to  Siliguri-India \nand  Banglabandh-Bangladesh.  These  harmonized  efforts  in  India, Nepal, and Bangladesh will \nhelp achieve SASEC\u2019s goal to develop efficient transport logistics links in South Asia. \n\n \n3. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \n27. \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  World  Bank,  DFID,  and  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) are major aid agencies that have supported the road \nsector  in  Bangladesh.  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Denmark,  Italy,  Kuwait,  Netherlands,  and \nSwitzerland  also  provided  bilateral  support.  Aid  agencies\u2019  assistance  has  been  closely \ncoordinated  through  local  consultative  group  meetings  by  addressing  all  road  sector-related \nissues.  Aid  agencies\u2019  coordination  resulted  in  NLTP.  DFID  financed  IDC3  to  strengthen  RHD, \nand was remarkably successful in changing RHD\u2019s management of the major road network and \nin coordinating the activities of the major aid agencies. In line with IDC3 reforms, ADB\u2019s Road \nMaintenance  and  Improvement  Project  (footnote  2)  required  the  Government  to  prepare  a \nnational  transport  policy  as  a  loan  condition.  DFID  responded  to  ADB\u2019s  initiative by financing \nconsulting services for preparation of the national transport policy. NLTP was prepared by this \nconcerted effort of the Government, DFID, and ADB.  \n \nJBIC finances the construction of the Paksey and Rupsa bridges, which will connect the \n28. \nnorthwest to the southwest region and help direct cross-border traffic from Nepal and Bhutan to \nMongla  Port.  With \nImprovement  and \nthe  bridges  constructed,  ADB\u2019s  Road  Network \nMaintenance  Project  in  the  northwest  and  initiative  to  facilitate  cross-border  traffic  through \nBanglabandh will have more critical development impact. JICA is supporting a feasibility study \non  constructing  Padma  Bridge,  which  will  connect  the  southwestern  and  eastern  regions  and \nthereby complete the integration of the country following the construction of Paksey and Rupsa \nbridges.  ADB  will  provide  TA  for  Padma  Bridge  in  2005,  and  closely  coordinate  with  JICA  to \ndevelop  a  financially,  economically,  technically,  and  environmentally  viable  project.  External \nassistance to the road sector is summarized in Appendix 3. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n29. \nAttention  to  the  social  and  environmental  aspects  of  road  projects  has  become \nincreasingly  important  for  their  successful  implementation.  Consultations  with  stakeholders  in \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n7\n\n \n\nthe field are essential to identify possible adverse impacts and to develop land acquisition and \nresettlement plans, mitigate environmental impacts, and address gender dimensions of projects. \nA  flexible  resettlement  plan  prepared  in  full  consultation  with  stakeholders  will  avoid  the \nunnecessary  delays  encountered  by  recent  road  projects.  Participatory  assessments  involving \nthe poor are an important tool to ensure that their needs are reflected in project formulation. \n \n30. \nOne  more  important  lesson  is  that  unless  periodic  maintenance  is  undertaken  on time, \nroads will deteriorate and require more costly investment in rehabilitation. A sustainable funding \nmechanism for road maintenance would help avoid inefficient use of resources. \n \n31. \nOver  the  past  decade  ADB;  other  aid  agencies,  including  DFID  and  World Bank; and \nJapan  have  seen  the  need  to  closely  coordinate  their  support  programs  after  encountering \nproblems  of  competing  strategies  and  support  duplication.  The  main  aid  agencies  have \nestablished a consultative group that meets regularly in Dhaka, and increasingly seek to finance \nelements of a common sector agenda. For example, the main aid agencies\u2019 support for IDC3\u2019s \ninstitutional and road maintenance initiatives culminated in the development of NLTP. \n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n32. \nPolicy dialogue was conducted with the Government to determine institutional and policy \nreforms for inclusion in project formulation. Participants agreed that the Project would include a \nroad map to link future ADB support to implementation of principal elements of NLTP relating to \nthe  road  sector.  The  road  map  is  expected  to  cover  2003-2008,  considered  sufficient  to \ncomplete implementation of the main institutional and policy reforms envisaged by NLTP for the \nroad  sector.  The  road  map  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  during  preparation  of  ADB projects \nduring  this  period,  including  the  proposed  road  sector  development  project,  tentatively \nscheduled for 2006. \n \nA road map was prepared based on discussions with the Government, review of NLTP, \n33. \nand review of compliance with loan covenants under previous ADB road projects in consultation \nwith DFID and the World Bank. The road map (Appendix 4) covers the following institutional and \npolicy reform elements of NLTP: (i) integration of transport policy, planning, and appraisal within \nMOC;  (ii)  updating  of  legislation;  (iii)  private  sector  participation  in  highway  development;  (iv) \nmodernization  and  strengthening  of  RHD;  (v)  privatization  of  RHD\u2019s  plant  and  equipment \nworkshops; (vi) funding of road maintenance; (vii) road maintenance; (viii) preparation of  a road \nsector master plan; and (x) modernization and strengthening of BRTA, including road safety. A \nnumber of advance actions were identified for inclusion in the loan-processing conditions. Key \nimplementation outcomes within the road map were identified  as milestones to be met before \nADB  processes/approves  its  support,  tentatively  scheduled  for  2006.  These  were  included  as \nassurances to be met within 18 months of effectiveness of the project loan. The linking of further \nADB  financing  to  accomplishing  milestones  will  encourage  the  Government  to  implement  its \nreform program in full and on schedule. The Appraisal Mission and Government considered the \nadvance actions and milestones to be achievable within the stipulated time frames.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \nThe objective of the Project is to help the Government achieve poverty reduction through \n34. \neconomic growth by improving transport efficiency and strengthening integrated road networks. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  facilitate  the  Government  to  implement  sectoral  and  institutional  reform \n\n\f8\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nmeasures envisaged in NLTP; (ii) improve national, regional, and district roads to provide rural \nfarmers  with  better  access  to  markets,  social  services,  and  employment  opportunities,  and  to \nprovide better access to the border point in Banglabandh; (iii) secure Government resources for \nperiodic  road  maintenance;  (iv)  promote  private  sector  participation  in  road  maintenance;  (v) \nimprove  road  safety;  (vi)  privatize  the  operation  of  five  vehicle  inspection  centers;  and  (vii) \nimprove public awareness of HIV/AIDS9 and trafficking of women.   \n \nB. \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nSector and Institutional Reform Program \n\n \n35. \nThe  Government  will  develop  follow-up  action  plans  to  implement  NLTP  with  DFID \nassistance.  The  Project  will  prepare  the  sector road map in consultation with the Government \nand  set  the  milestones  for  key  reform  measures  to  be  achieved  within  a  certain  timeframe, \nwhich  are  linked  to  further  processing  of  the  Project  and  provision  of  ADB\u2019s  next  loan  project, \nprogrammed for 2006.  \n \n36.  Major  external  agencies,  DFID,  World  Bank,  and  ADB,  will  provide  financial  and \ntechnical  support  (Appendix  3)  to  help  the  Government  achieve  the  above  milestones.  DFID, \nthrough IDC3, will help the Government prepare the NLTP action plan, which will be available \nby 2005. As one of these actions, NLTP expects that a long-term (20-year) road master plan will \nbe prepared to complete the strategic highway network. This plan will be evaluated to determine \npriorities  for  construction  that  meet  economic  targets, and will identify opportunities for private \nsector participation. The plan should be developed urgently since it will guide future road sector \ninvestment in line with the sector road map agreed upon with the Government.  \n \n37. \nThe  Project  will  help  prepare  the  road  master  plan.  The  assistance  will  comprise \nconsulting  services  to  (i)  assess  Bangladesh\u2019s  overall  economic  development  prospects, \nresulting  transport  demand,  and  its  likely  effect  on  road  transport  demand;  (ii)  forecast  road \ntransport  demand  and  determine  the  basic  grid  of  main  roads  required  to  meet  it,  taking  into \naccount  the  existing  network  and  possible  extension  by  upgrading  existing  network  and \nconstructing  new  links;  (iii)  determine  an  optimal  sequence  of  investments  (new  construction, \nrehabilitation,  upgrading,  and  widening)  and  maintenance  works  for  each  segment  of  the  grid \nover 20 years; (iv) assess the feasibility to construct toll-based highways, and identify potential \ntoll-based highways and possible financing modes, including BOT; and (v)  formulation of a 20-\nyear  road  investment  strategy,  and  its  financing  plan.  An  international  consulting  firm  in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  procedures  and  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of \nreference for the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n2. \n\nRoads Improvement Component \n\n \n\na. \n\nRegional and District Roads \n\n \n38. \nThe  Project  will  help  improve  the  remaining  project  roads:  (i)  reconstruction  of  15  km \nregional road in Nandail-Kishoreganj, (ii) reconstruction of 45.4 km district road in the Bhaluka-\nKishoreganj road, and (iii) reconstruction of 44.0 km district road in the Parbatipur-Madyapara. \nThe design approach and technical standards for reconstruction are in Appendix 5.  \n\n                                                 \n9 HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n9\n\n \n\nb. \n\nBorder Access Road to Banglabandh \n\n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  help  improve  57.0  km  national  road  in  Panchaghar-Banglabandh, and \n52.6  km  district  road  in  the  Boda-Nilphamari.  Part  of  this  component,  together  with  raising \nawareness of the risks of HIV/AIDS and trafficking of women, will be financed by a subregional \ncooperation fund.   \n \n\nc. \n\nMissing Links \n\n \n40. \nAlthough the major strategic corridors are almost complete after decades of coordinated \nefforts by the Government and aid agencies, some missing links remain in major road networks, \nwhich NLTP prescribes completing, giving rise to serious bottlenecks and substantial economic \ncosts.   \n \nADB\u2019s  Jamuna  Bridge  Access  Roads  Project,10  approved  in  1997,  and  Road \n41. \nMaintenance  and  Improvement  Project  (footnote  2),  approved  in  2000,  improved  various \nsections of roads in Dhaka-Chittagong. ADB\u2019s Road Overlay and Improvement Project (footnote \n7), approved in 1993, improved Dohazari-Cox\u2019s Bazar road, which is an important link between \nCox\u2019s Bazar and Dhaka. However, the 26.2 km link from Chittagong to Dohazari and the 3.2 km \nof bypass in Kaliakoir, which had been included in the Jamuna Bridge Access Roads Project, \nwere  excluded  from  the  scope  due  to  insufficient  funds,  and  are  in  such  poor  condition  that \nbenefits from past road improvements cannot be fully realized. The project completion report on \nRoad  Overlay  and  Improvement  Project  (footnote  8),  prepared  in  2002,  recommends that the \nGovernment seriously consider improving the Chittagong-Dohazari road. \n \n42. \n(ii) 3.2 km of national roads in Kaliakoir Bypass.  \n \n\nThe  Project  will  help  improve  (i)  26.2  km  of  national  roads  in  Chittagong-Dohazari and \n\n3. \n\nPeriodic Road Maintenance Component \n\n \n43. \nThe periodic road maintenance component will finance a 2-year time slice of priority road \nmaintenance  activities  under  the  ARMP.  For  each  of  the  two  years,  this  component  will  cover \nperiodic  maintenance  of  an  estimated  300  km,  to  be  carried  out  through civil works contracts \nworth  $12  million  equivalent.  The  roads  to  be  maintained  will  be  selected  annually  using  the \nHDM ranking as part of the ARMP. Support will be restricted to periodic maintenance works and \ncomprise mainly sealing and overlay. Road widening and improvement are excluded except in \nlocations approved by ADB, such as markets and bus bays. The support will target the districts \nselected  by  Road  Network  Improvement  Maintenance  TA.  The  criteria  for  selecting  road \nmaintenance subprojects are in Appendix 6. Consultants will supervise the civil works under the \nADB-assisted time slice.  \n \n44. \nSince  this  component  is  to  encourage  the  Government  to  commit  more  of  its  annual \nbudget to periodic road maintenance, the costs to be met under the ADB loan will be limited to \n30%, while the balance will be met through Government counterpart funding. This element will \ncontribute  significantly  to  securing  Government  resources  for  periodic  road  maintenance, \namounting  to  12%  of  total  annual  requirement  and  addressing  the  critical  backlog  of  periodic \nmaintenance.  \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1997.

Manila.  \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nRoutine Road Maintenance Component \n\n \n45. \nRoutine and recurrent maintenance for about 100 km of regional or district roads will be \ncontracted out to domestic contractors based on performance-based contracts for 3 years. The \nroads  for  routine  maintenance  will  be  selected  from  regional  or  type-A  feeder  roads  in  the \ndistricts selected by Road Network Improvement Maintenance TA, the periodic maintenance of \nwhich has been completed within a year at the time of selection. The concept of performance-\nbased maintenance and its implementation are outlined in Appendix 7.  \n \n46. \nConsultants will develop the contract scheme, train RHD officials and local contractors, \nhelp  award  contracts,  and  supervise  the  works  in  the  first  year  of  implementation.  During  the \nremaining years of implementation, RHD will supervise and monitor the works. During the first \nyear, the consultant will monitor and evaluate implementation, and prepare a final report giving \nthe findings, lessons learned, and recommendations for replication.  \n \n\n5. \n\nRoad Safety Component \n\n \n47. \nApart from the safety audit of project roads for improvement and periodic maintenance, \nthe  Project  will  also  audit  about  800  km  of  existing  roads  with  the  highest  accident  rate  and \nimprove accident-prone areas or black spots in accordance with ADB\u2019s Road Safety Guidelines \nfor the Asian and Pacific Region. Black spots will be minimized by (i) improving delineation and \nedge marking on roads and installing reflecting marked posts; (ii) installing deviation boards in \ncritical locations; (iii) widening the pavement sections of main roads that carry high volumes of \npedestrians,  rickshaws,  and  animal-driven  vehicles;  (iv)  providing  off-road  facilities  for \npedestrians in settlements, including facilities for buses and bus passengers; and (v) providing \nadequate reflective warning signs, and setting realistic speed limits.  \n \n\n6. \n\nPrivatization of Vehicle Inspection Center Component \n\n \n48. \nAs  covenanted  by  the  Southwest  Road  Network  Development  Project  (footnote  5), the \noperation  and  management  of  five  vehicle  inspection  centers  will  be  leased  out  to  the  private \nsector. The Project will help BRTA (i) repair existing testing equipment and machinery and (ii) \nprivatize  operations  of  five  vehicle  inspection  centers.  To  identify  and  implement  repair  and \nmanagement of privatization processes, consultants will develop the investment plan for repair, \nselect  and  supervise  contractors  for  repair  work,  develop  a  licensing  regime  for  vehicle \ninspection  together  with  licensing  framework,  develop  a  bidding  framework  and  documents, \nprepare  a  framework  for  BRTA  to  regulate  privatized  operations,  and  supervise  the  whole \nprocess of privatization. An international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants \nwill  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  and  according  to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n7. \n\nImproving  Public  Awareness  of \nTrafficking in Women \n\nthe  Risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  \n\n \n49. \nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  identify  effective  and  viable  modes  of  anti-\ntrafficking  operations  and  improve  awareness  of  vulnerable  groups  on  HIV/AIDS.  This \ncomponent  will  assist  in  (i)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  Government,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and media in creating awareness on issues of HIV/AIDS and trafficking \nof  women  in  the  cross-border  area  of  Bangladesh  and  India;  and  (ii) providing assistance for \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n11\n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nCost Estimates \n\ncapital  investments  for  physical  upgrading  of  innovative  schemes  (i.e.,  center  for  legal \nliteracy/awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  in  women)  in  two  districts  of  Panchaghar  and \nDinajpur in the northern border of Bangladesh  and one district in Chittagong, which are close to \nthe Project. The preliminary proposal for this component is in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nC. \n \n50. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $187.1 million equivalent, inclusive of physical and \nprice  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charges  during  construction.  The  foreign \nexchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $75  million,  representing  about  40%  of  total  cost.  The  local \ncurrency  cost  is  estimated  at  $112.1  million  equivalent,  or  about  60%  of  total cost. The local \ncurrency  costs  include  $30.7  million  equivalent  for  taxes  and  duties,  and  about  $7.5  million \nequivalent for land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \nD. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $126.0  million  equivalent  from  its  Special \n51. \nFunds Resources. Of this loan, $20.0 million is financed by subregional cooperation indicative \nplanning  figure  to  improve  the  border  access  road  and  Panchargahr-Banglabandh  and  Boda-\nNilphamari roads, and raise public awareness of the risk of HIV/AIDS and trafficking in women \nalong these roads. The Government will finance the balance of $61.1 million of the project cost. \n \n52. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest \ncharge of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The ADB loan \nwill  finance  100%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project  and  45%  of  the  local  currency \ncost. Total ADB financing accounts for 67% of Project costs, and government financing will be \n33%. The Government will make the loan proceeds available to the project executing agencies \nfor the purposes of the Porject. The detailed financing plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n53. \nProviding  financing  for  local  currency  costs  is  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency \nfinancing policy. 11 Because a low per capita income discourages national savings, assistance is \nrequired  to  support  the  local  currency  costs  of  some  development  projects.  The  domestic \nsavings  and  investment  rate  of  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  lowest  among  developing  member \ncountries. Public finances remain severely constrained. The banking system also faces serious \nfinancial  problems,  including  a  high  proportion  of  nonperforming  loans.  The  Government  is \ntaking  steps  to  strengthen  the  financial  sector  and  generate  increased  national  savings  by \nintroducing financial sector reforms and improving budgetary revenue collection. Given all these \nfactors,  the  current  social  and  economic  development  circumstances  warrant  continued  ADB \nfinancing of local costs. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n \n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \nRHD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project,  except  for  the  vehicle  inspection \n54. \ncenters and public awareness raising of the risk of HIV/AIDS. RHD has substantial experience \nin  implementing  ADB-financed  road  projects.  In  accordance  with  the  loan  covenants  for  the \nADB-financed Southwest Road Network Development Project, the RHD office of the additional \nchief  engineer  implements  all  ADB  projects.  This  office  will  be  responsible  for  all  RHD \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 1995. Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects.

The  project  director  will  be  supported  by  the \nadditional  project  director  and  three  executive  engineers  as  project  managers  to  be  appointed \nwithin  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  and  be  responsible  for  day-to-day implementation. \nThe  additional  project  director  will  also  be  responsible  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement. \nDetails of the proposed project management for road improvement are in Appendix 9.  \n \n56. \nThe transport sector coordination (TSC) wing, which will be established by mid-2004 in \nMOC,  will  monitor  implementation  of  the  sector  road  map  agreed  upon  with  ADB  and \nachievement  of  the  milestones  spelled  out  in  the  road  map.  After  the  loan  becomes  effective, \nthe  TSC  wing  will  submit  to  ADB  a  quarterly  report  summarizing  the  progress  of  reform \nmeasures included in the road map.  \n \nBRTA will be the Executing Agency for the vehicle inspection center component and will \n57. \nappoint  its  director  engineering  as  project  director  for  this  component.  The  Infrastructure \nInvestment Facilitation Center (IIFC)12 will be designated as implementing agency and manage \nall  privatization  processes.  IIFC  will  form  a  task  team  of  a  leader  and  two  members.  It  will \nimplement the Project on a day-to-day basis and report to BRTA\u2019s director engineering.  \n \n58. \nThe Ministry of Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Affairs (MOWCA) will be the executing agency \nfor  the  component  to  improve  public  awareness  of  the  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  of \nwomen  and  will  appoint  its  senior  assistant  chief  as  project  director  for  this  component.  A \nsteering committee will be established consisting of the senior assistant chief of MOWCA, RHD \nproject  director,  and  NGOs.  The  steering  committee  will  meet  three  times  a  year  and  guide \nMOWCA, and also select and supervise the NGOs for implementing this component.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n59. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years,  inclusive  of  preconstruction \nactivities.  Detailed  design  of  the  project  roads  will  start  in  April  2004,  and  civil  works  by  July \n2005. The Government will not award any ADB-financed civil works construction contracts until \nafter the construction supervision consultants have been appointed, and until the land and rights \nto land, free of encumbrances, required to execute such contracts, have been acquired or made \navailable.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  30  June  2008.  Details  of  the \nimplementation schedule are in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n60. \nCivil  works  for  road  improvement  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures among prequalified bidders in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Contract packages for road improvement are listed in Appendix 11. Civil works for \nperiodic road maintenance will be packaged in contracts with an estimated value of $1 million\u2013\n$2  million,  and  procured  in  accordance  with  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Local contractors have proved technically and financially qualified to carry \nout  this  size  of  periodic  maintenance  works,  and  few  international  contractors  would  be \n\n                                                 \n12  IIFC  is  a  state-owned  company  set  up  in  1999  with  World  Bank  assistance  to  facilitate  private investment in   \n\ninfrastructure.

To improve black spots on existing roads, and \nequipment  and  machinery  installed  in  five  vehicle  inspection  centers,  local  contractors  will  be \nselected in accordance with LCB procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\nfor \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n62. \nAn  international  consulting  firm  will  supervise  civil  works  for  road  improvement  and \nperiodic road maintenance in association with domestic consultants, and will ensure community \nparticipation, identify community needs, and monitor gender and child labor issues. About 225 \nperson-months of international and 990 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  appointed  by  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method using full technical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  and  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants. \nOutline terms of reference for these services are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nConsultants  will  prepare  a  detailed  design  for  the  proposed  road  sector  development \n63. \nproject  in  2006  (about  20  person-months  international  and  140  domestic).  Outline  terms  of \nreference for these services are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \nRHD  will  appoint  full-time  domestic  consultants  or  NGOs  to  help  implement  and \n64. \nindependently monitor the land acquisition and resettlement plan. Outline terms of reference  for \nthese  services  are  in  Appendix  12.  The  steering  committee  to  raise  public  awareness  of  the \nrisks of HIV/AIDS and trafficking of women will also appoint NGOs to carry out the activities and \nguide  implementation.  The  consultants  or  NGOs  will  be  recruited  according  to  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n65. \nFor consulting services, procurement of equipment, and civil works contracts, loan funds \nwill  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures  in  accordance  with  \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n\na. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n \n66. \nRHD,  BRTA,  and  MOWCA  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received, \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, and local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance \nwith  sound  accounting  principles.  In  addition  to  the  audit  conducted  by  the  comptroller  and \nauditor  general,  consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nannually  by  recognized  international  private  sector  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Office  of \nComptroller  and  Audit  General  will  appoint  the  auditors  in  consultation  with  RHD.  The  audited \nreports and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after \nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The Office of the Director of Accounts in RHD will \ncoordinate all accounts and ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s audit and accounting requirements, \nwhich will be followed up in regular reviews by ADB.  \n \n67. \nAll procurement activities will be subject to an independent performance audit to ensure \ntransparency  and  objective  and  independent  assessment  of  such  activities.  The  performance \naudit will be conducted twice during implementation by the international private sector auditors \nappointed by the Office of Comptroller and Audit General in consultation with RHD. The auditors \nwill  also  conduct  random  or  spot  audits  for  contract  implementation  activities  under  the  civil \nworks contracts.   \n\n \nb. \n\nReports \n\n \nIn  addition  to  the  quarterly  reports  on  progress  of  project  implementation  that  will  be \n68. \nprovided by the Government to ADB, the supervision consultant appointed under the Project will \nsubmit monthly progress reports to RHD, MOC, and ADB. RHD will ensure that the consultant \nincludes  in  the  reports  the  status  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  other  activities  that \nare  critical  to  project  implementation,  but  are  not  directly  included  in  the  scope  of  engineering \nservices. Within three months of the Project\u2019s physical completion, the Government will prepare \na completion report in a format acceptable to ADB. \n \nRHD,  BRTA,  and  MOWCA  will  monitor  project  preparation  and  implementation  in \n69. \naccordance  with  the  implementation  schedule,  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant \ndeviations that could delay the project implementation.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n70. \nRHD,  assisted  by  the  supervision  consultant,  will  establish  capability  for  systematic \nproject performance monitoring and analysis throughout project implementation, integrated with \nits  management  information  system.  Before  civil  works,  project  performance  monitoring  will \ndevelop and conduct a \u201cquick and easy\u201d sample survey to establish a baseline for subsequent \nperformance monitoring. After completion of civil works, surveys will be conducted annually. The \nscope  of  the  survey,  quantity  and  quality  of  data,  and  frequency  of  collection  will  be  guided \nprimarily  by  the  project  management\u2019s  need  for  progressive  and  rapid  feedback  on \nimplementation  status,  as  well  as  early  warning  on  situations  that  might  jeopardize  the \nattainment of development objectives. The key indicators and assumptions outlined under goal \nand  purpose  in  the  project  framework  (Appendix  1)  will  form  the  core  of  the  data  required  for \nassessment. Project performance monitoring will be strengthened by supplementary systematic \nanalysis of sample data from similar nonproject areas.  \n\n \n7. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n71. \nADB staff will review project implementation through regular or special review missions. \nBased on the project schedule, a mid-term review will be carried out around July/August 2006. \nThe  midterm  review  will  include  discussion  with  the  Government  about  performance-based \nmaintenance contract. Terms of reference for the midterm review will be included in the project \nadministration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission for the Project.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n15\n\n \n\n8. \n\nAdvance Action on Recruitment of Consultants and Civil Works \n\n \n72. \nADB has approved advanced recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil works \non the understanding that such action will not necessarily commit ADB to financing the Project. \nThe project director has started engaging project supervision consultants.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n\n \n73. \nThe  project  benefits  are  wide-ranging  and  include  direct  and  quantifiable  benefits \n(savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  [VOCs]  to  normal  traffic  [and  diverted  traffic  where \napplicable] and savings in time costs) as well as indirect and nonquantifiable benefits (greater \ncomfort and safety for road users, and reduced damage to cargo). Indirect benefits, estimated in \nthe form of generated passenger and cargo traffic, arise from secondary effects of reduction in \nVOCs and time costs, which, in turn, lead to increased economic activities.  \n \n74. \nThe project roads\u2019 economic internal rate of return (EIRR) ranges from 17.0% to 43.1%, \nor a combined EIRR of 26.2%. A review of the various factors affecting EIRR indicates that the \nmain  threat  to  the  investment\u2019s  viability  is  premature  road  failure  due  to  inadequate \nmaintenance. The Project will help the Government establish and implement policies to mitigate \nthese risks. Various sensitivity tests indicate that EIRR is robust in relation to construction cost \nincrease by 15%, reduction of benefits by 15%, project implementation delay by a year, and a \nless-than-optimal maintenance after construction. The switching values of these sensitivity tests \nrange from 33% to 98%. Detailed economic analysis for the road improvement components is in \nAppendix 13. \n \nB. \n \n75. \nThe population of project areas is made up mainly low-income farmers and day laborers. \nMost  live  in  small  hand-built  clay  houses,  and  differences  in  wealth  and  status  are  not \nparticularly visible. The population consists of roughly three economic groups: (i) landless poor \nwho  are  mostly  daily  wage  laborers,  (iii)  small  farmers  with  land  holdings  of  0.2\u20130.4 hectares, \nand (iv) well-off farmers with 0.8 or more hectares as well as other income-generating assets. \n \n76. \nPreliminary findings indicate that all social and income categories surveyed either keenly \nsought  or  highly  appreciated  improved  roads.  All  groups  expected  the  road  to  help  increase \nincomes or were already enjoying easier transport of agricultural products and inputs, and travel \nto  work.  The  respondents  said  that  the  Project  would  most  likely  directly  increase  their \ndisposable  income  by  lowering  freight  transport  costs  and  offering  greater  access  to  larger \nmarkets,  resulting  in  increased  trade-related  profits.    A  summary  of  the  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 14.  \n77. \nThe distribution of project effect and poverty impact ratio is estimated for district roads, \nborder access roads, and missing links. All amounts are in net present value using a discount \nrate of 12% and arrived at in the following way: (i) estimating the net present value of financial \nbenefits  by  participating  groups,  (ii)  estimating  the  net  present  values  of  economic  benefits  by \nparticipating groups, and (iii) estimating economic benefits accruing to the poor according to the \nproportion  of  each  group  that  is  poor.  A  poverty  impact  ratio  expressing  the  proportion  of  net \nbenefit  accruing  to  the  poor  was  calculated  as  0.60  for  district  roads,  0.63  for  border  access \nroad, and 0.34 for missing links. In case of border access roads, about 6% of project benefits \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSocial Impacts \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nare  found  to  accrue  to  Nepali  cargo  owners.  The  distribution  analysis  is  summarized  in \nAppendix 15.  \n \nC. \n \n78. \nAccording to the social assessment, the proposed 240 km of roads in six road sections \nwill require 186 hectares of land for realignment, adjustments in road shoulders and drainage, \nand  road  widening.  This  means  an  estimated  4,650  households  will  lose  their  assets,  mostly \nagricultural land and structure frontage. Based on the social assessment, a resettlement plan is \nbeing  prepared  for  the  Project.  The  plan  is  guided  by  the  land  acquisition  laws/regulations in \nBangladesh and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the Handbook on Resettlement. \nThe  plan  stipulates  eligibility  and  provisions  for  various  types  of  losses  (land,  crops/trees,  and \nstructures).  The  entitlement  matrix  establishes  the  parameters for mitigation of various losses \nand  recognizes  the  range  of  likely  household  losses.  Female-headed  households  and  other \nvulnerable  households  will  be  eligible  for  further  cash  assistance,  based  on  specific  project \nimpacts.  The social assessment also indicated that no indigenous people or ethnic minority will \nbe harmed by the Project. A summary of the resettlement plan is in Appendix 16. \n \nD. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  existing  roads.  The  overall  finding  of  the  initial  environmental \n79. \nexamination  (IEE)  is  that  the  Project  will  not  cause  significant  environmental  problems  and \npotential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable.  The  Project  will  not  disturb  any  environmentally \nsensitive  areas.  Therefore,  a  full  environment  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  not  required. \nHowever, some project roads\u2014Panchagahr-Banglabandh and Chittagong-Dohazari roads, and \nKaliakoir  bypass\u2014fall  under  the  red  category  in  Bangladesh\u2019s  Environmental  Preservation \nRules 1997, which require a full EIA. 13 Civil works for this project road can be started only after \nthe Department of Environment (DOE) issues an environmental clearance based on the full EIA. \nThe EIA for the subject road will be prepared as part of the detailed engineering design of the \nroad and submitted to ADB with DOE\u2019s environmental clearance before civil works contracts are \nawarded. A summary environmental analysis is in Appendix 17. As part of mitigation measures \nif any, required under the IEE and EIA, the Government will ensure that the IEE or EIA will be \nattached to  bid  documents,  required  to  be  followed  by  the  contractor  during  construction  of \nProject roads, with penalty and contract termination provisions under the civil works contracts in \ncase of noncompliance of these by the contractor. \n \nE. \n \n80. \nThe  proposed  road  improvement  component  does  not  present  exceptional  or  unusual \nrisks  that  would  require  specially  designed  mitigation  measures.  RHD,  contractors,  and \nsupervision  consultants  are  all  familiar  with  the  kinds  of  works  to  be  financed  and  have \nsatisfactorily  implemented  similar  ones.  If  the  implementation  arrangements  are  properly \nstructured,  the  risk  that  construction  works  will  fail  will  be  minimal.  The  main  risk  for  road \nimprovement is that prolonged resettlement will delay project implementation. To facilitate timely \nand  effective  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  resettlement  plan,  RHD  will  hire  NGOs  to \nprocess  and  resolve  all  resettlement  problems.  A  district-level  coordination  mechanism  will \nresolve all land acquisition and resettlement issues.  \n\nRisks \n\n                                                 \n13  According  to  Bangladesh\u2019s  Environmental  Preservation  Rules  1997,  any  improvement  works  for  national  and \nregional  roads   require  a  full  EIA  regardless  of  the  types  of,  and  the  expected  environmental  impact  from, \nimprovement works.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n17\n\n \n\n \n81. \nGovernment counterpart funding is another risk factor that needs close attention during \nimplementation,  particularly  for  periodic  maintenance,  which  requires  70%  government \nfinancing,  much  higher  than  usual.  The  Project  has  thus  obtained  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment  not  only  for  general  assurance  about  counterpart  funding  but  for  more  specific \nassurances such as revenue budget allocation for periodic maintenance, to continue to increase \nannual funding for road maintenance. If, however, a road fund comes into being as covenanted \nby the end of 2005, this risk will be dramatically mitigated because counterpart funding will be \nsourced from the road fund, which will not be varied by Government\u2019s fiscal situation.   \n \n82. \nThe  expected  benefits  from  improvement  of  the  Panchagahr-Banglabandh  border \naccess  road  will  accrue  only  when  land  port  facilities  in  Banglabandh  are  improved.  The \ndialogue  with  LPA  and  IIFC,  which  will  oversee  land  port  development  and  operation \nconcessions in Banglabandh, revealed that enough private sector investors expressed interest \nbut  that  poor  border  access  road  would  discourage  them.  IIFC  has  a  good  track  record  in \nhelping  state-owned  companies  privatize,  and  has  a  number  of  qualified  staff  knowledgeable \nabout  BOT-type  concession  contracts.  The  progress  of  BOT  concessions  will  be  closely \nmonitored  and,  if  necessary,  ADB  will  help  ensure  the  success  of  BOT  investment  for  the \nBanglabandh land port.  \n \nThe  most  important  risk  is  that  the  Government  loses  interest  in  sector  reform  initiated \n83. \nand maintained  by  coordinated  influences  from  aid  agencies,  recently  culminating  in  several \nlandmark reforms. To keep this momentum, aid agencies will continue to closely coordinate with \neach other, provide financial and technical support to help the Government achieve the goals of \nthe sector road map, and speak as one on institutional and sector reform. DFID\u2019s consolidated \nIDC3, World Bank\u2019s sector reform project in 2005, and ADB\u2019s road sector development project \nin  2006  will  be  formulated  in  close  consultation  among  the aid agencies, and gather forces to \nleverage Government\u2019s continuing interest in sector reform.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nGeneral \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n \n84. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \nA. \n \nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funding  for  the  Project  in  a  timely  manner  in \n85. \naccordance  with  its  annual  approved  development  plan  allocation  and  in  accordance  with  the \nproject  financing  plan(cid:190)\nincluding  cost  of  land  acquisition,  other  resettlement  compensation, \nimplementation and monitoring cost under the land acquisition and resettlement plan including \nfor any revision, utility relocation, and general project management expenses. \n \n86. \nRHD  will,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  paragraphs  89,  and  91,  (i)  acquire  or  make \navailable  on  a  timely  basis  (i.e.,  strictly  in  accordance  with  the  schedule  as  agreed  under  the \nrelated  civil  works  contract)  the  land  and  rights  in  land,  free  from  any  encumbrances,  and  (ii) \nclear the utilities, trees and any other obstruction from such land, on a timely basis (i.e., strictly \nin accordance with the schedule as agreed under the related civil works contracts), as required \nfor  construction  activities  relating  to  each  section  of  the  related  civil  works  contract  under  the \nProject. RHD will ensure that subsequent to award of civil works contract under the Project, no \nsection or part thereof under the civil works contract will be handed over to the contractor unless \nthe requirements of paragraphs 89, and 91 are complied with. \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResettlement, Environment, and Social Issues  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  MOC  ensures  sufficient  representation  of  RHD  and \n87. \nBRTA in the meetings of the steering committee to be established under ADB\u2019s TA for Suporting \nGood Government Initiatives. 14 \n \nBased  on  the  recommendations  of  the  TA  as  referred  in  previous  paragraph,  the \n88. \nGovernment,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  will  ensure  that  MOC,  RHD,  and  BRTA  adopt  the \nanticorruption rules, regulations, and procedures prepared under the TA to monitor and evaluate \ntransparent procurement, recruitment, accounting, and regulatory review mechanisms. \n \nB. \n \n89. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  proceed  in \naccordance with its applicable laws, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, as set out in \nthe agreed upon resettlement plan, that includes (a) land and rights of way acquired promptly, \nfree from encumbrances, (b) compensation and entitlements to affected peoples as stipulated in \nthe  resettlement  plan,  (c)  timely  provision  of  counterpart funds and disbursements to affected \npersons,  (d)  meeting  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  budget  estimate,  (e)  adequate \nsupervision, monitoring, and reporting by the RHD; (f) external monitoring and evaluation by a \ncompetent  independent  agency  (consultant  or  NGO);  (g)  annual  audit  of  resettlement \ndisbursements and expenditures; (h) adequate information dissemination and consultation with \naffected  peoples;  (i)  documentation  of  consultation  and  grievances;  (j)  updated  resettlement \nplan as necessary including if the scope of the Project is changed; and (k) regular reporting of \nprogress to ADB. \n \nThe  resettlement  budget  will  be  revised  based  on  any  new  data  collected,  and  any \n90. \nadditional  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  cost  will  be  borne  by  the  Government.  This  full \nresettlement  plan,  including  any  revisions  thereof,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval before award of civil works contracts. \n \n91. \nThe Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified in the \nIEE  and  to  be  identified  in  the  EIA  to  be  prepared  for  the  Nandail\u2013Kishoreganj  road, \nPanchagarh-Banglabanh  road,  and  Kaliakoir  bypass  are  incorporated  into  the  project  design \nand  followed  during  project  implementation  in  consultation  with  DOE,  and  in  accordance  with \nthe applicable laws in Bangladesh and ADB\u2019s environmental requirements as set forth in ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) including as amended from time to time. \n \nThe Government will ensure that RHD requires contractors to comply with its applicable \n92. \nlabor laws and (a) not differentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value, (b) \nnot  employ  child  labor,  (c) provide  appropriate  facilities  for  children  in  construction  campsites, \nand (d) conduct an adequate number of information and education campaigns at worksites on \nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for construction workers as part of their health and \nsafety program. \n \n93. \nThe Government will also ensure that RHD closely monitors and supervises compliance \nwith  all  requirements  of  the  above  paragraph,  and  provides  in  the  bidding  documents  for \ntermination of the contract in case of any noncompliance. \n \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2003.

NATIONAL LAND TRANSPORT POLICY \n\n \n1. \nPrivate Sector Participation. In Bangladesh, the Government provides most transport \ninfrastructure.  The  national  land  transport  policy  (NLTP)  encourages  the  private  sector  to \nparticipate  in  infrastructure  development  by  introducing  finance,  efficient  operating  techniques, \nand technological innovation. In accordance with the loan covenant of ADB\u2019s Road Maintenance \nand Improvement Project, approved in 2002, the Government prepared the draft guidelines for \nprivate  investment  in  highway  projects  and  draft  laws,  which  are  now  under  review  by  various \nstakeholders.  \n \n2. \nUser Pays. In Bangladesh, roads are considered public goods, and the concept of \u201cuser \npays\u201d  for  road  infrastructure  is  not  well  accepted.  This  perception  has  long  been  a  critical \nobstacle to development of toll roads. The Government recognizes that transport users should \npay  for  transport  facilities  provided  by  either  the  public  or  private  sector.  NLTP  ensures  that \nusers  pay  for  the  costs  of  the  transport  operation  and  maintenance.  As  part  of  the  long-term \nhighway plan, the Government will draw up plans for national toll roads with the consideration of \nestablishing a separate authority and executive to deliver the toll road network.  \n \n3. \nNLTP  spells  out  strategic  objectives  for  the  road  sector  formulated  in  line  with  policy \ndialogues carried out by ADB as well as by other aid agencies, which  (i) clarifying government \nresponsibilities  for  roads  and  highways,  (ii)  introducing  long-term  network  planning,  (iii) \nmaintaining the road network at a level which protects the value of the investment, (iv) securing \na sustainable means of funding road expenditure, and (v) improving organizational efficiency of \nRoads and Highways Department (RHD).  \n \n4. \nRoads and Highways Department and Local Government Engineering Department. \nThe ownership of, and responsibility for, parts of the road network has not been so clear. RHD \nconstructs  and  maintains  roads  as  does  Local  Government  Engineering  Department (LGED). \nLocal  authorities  also  construct  some  roads.  RHD  and  LGED  thus  compete  for  ownership  of \nroads that are politically sensitive while simply neglecting others. NLTP ensures a logical split of \nresponsibilities  between  RHD  and  LGED.  The  division  of  responsibilities  among  RHD,  LGED, \nand local authorities will be clearer and more rational. A committee to clarify road ownership has \nreclassified  existing  roads  and  reassigned  ownership  and  responsibility  between  RHD  and \nLGED for their development and maintenance.  \n \n5. \nLong-Term  Network  Planning.  Provision  of  transport  infrastructure  needs  a  long \nplanning  horizon.  NLTP  will  develop  a  long-term  (20-year)  road  master  plan  to  complete  the \nstrategic  highway  network\u2014roads  that  serve  strategic  business  and  commercial  centers.  This \nplan  will  be  evaluated  to  determine  priorities  for  construction  that  meet  economic  targets,  and \nwill identify opportunities for private sector participation.  \n \n6. \nRoad Maintenance  and  Sustainable  Financing.  Most  resources  have  been  used  to \nbuild  new  roads  rather  than  to  maintain  highways.  This  imbalance  in  capital  and  revenue \nexpenditure should be redressed to protect the value of road investment. NLTP seeks to avoid \nrecurrence of backlog of road maintenance through improved routine and periodic maintenance. \nThe  private  sector  will  be  encouraged  to  play  a  greater  part  in  highway  maintenance.  The \nGovernment has also started to research the most appropriate form of sustainable funding  for \nroutine and periodic road maintenance. Whatever institutional arrangements are made to secure \na  funding  source  for  maintenance,  NLTP  well  recognizes  that  government  revenues  are \ninsufficient  to  address  the  problem.  For  sustainable  financing,  NLTP  will  set  aside  part  of  the \nfuel tax levy or consider the introduction of an additional road fuel levy.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24\n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n   \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROADS SUBSECTOR, 1977\u20132002 \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\nSource  \n\nAsian Development \nBank \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWorld Bank \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJapan \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nPeople\u2019s  \nRepublic of \nChina \n \n \n \n \nNetherlands \n \nUnited \nKingdom \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDenmark \n \n \n \n \n \n \nItaly \n \nKuwait \n \n \n \n \n\n\u2022  Khulna-Mongla Road \n\u2022  Feeder Roads Improvement \n\u2022  Road Improvement \n\u2022  Flood Damage Restoration \n\u2022  Second Flood Damage Restoration \n\u2022  Cyclone Damaged Roads Reconstruction \n\u2022  Road Overlay and Improvement Project \n\u2022  Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge \n\u2022  Jamuna Bridge Access Roads Project \n\u2022  Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project (1998) \n\u2022  Southwest Road Network Development Project \n\u2022  Road Maintenance and Improvement \n\u2022  Road Network Improvement and Maintenance \n\n \n \n\nSubtotal \n\n\u2022  Second Highway  \n\u2022  First Highway Supplemental \n\u2022  Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance \n\u2022  Flood Damage Rehabilitation \n\u2022  Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance \n\u2022  Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge \n\u2022  Third Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance \n \n \n\u2022  Upazila Connecting Roads (JICA) \n\u2022  Construction of Meghna Bridge (JICA) \n\u2022  Construction of Meghna-Gumuti Bridge (JICA) \n\u2022  Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge (JBIC) \n\u2022  Jamuna Bridge Access Road Project (JBIC) \n\u2022  Construction of Small and Medium Bridges on Dhaka-\n\nSubtotal  \n\n \n\nChittagong Highway (JICA) \n\n \n\n \n\nSubtotal \n\n\u2022  Meghna Bridge Resettlement Project (JICA) \n\u2022  Paksey Bridge (JBIC) \n\u2022  Rupsa Bridge (JBIC) \n \n \n\u2022  Buriganga Bridge \n\u2022  Shambhuganj Bridge \n\u2022  Mohananda Bridge \n\u2022  Karatua Bridge \n\u2022  Gabkhan Bridge \n \nSubtotal \n \n\u2022  Karnaphuli Bridge \n \n\u2022  Bailey Bridges \n\u2022  Gorai River Bridge \n\u2022  Institutional Development Component-2 \n\u2022  Institutional Development Component-3 \n\u2022  Bridge Improvement and Maintenance Project-2 \n\u2022  Bhairab Bridge \n\u2022  Reconstruction of Narrow Bridge and Culvert \n \n \n\u2022  Road Maintenance Equipment \n\u2022  Supply of Road Rollers \n\u2022  Dhaka-Aricha Highway \n\u2022  Important Road Rehab. in Patuakhali and Barguna \n\u2022  Khagrachari-Rangamati Road \n \n \n\u2022  Dinajpur-Panchagarh Road \n \n\u2022  Doarika-Shikerpur Bridge Project \n\u2022  Sylhet-Tamabil  Road Project \n\nSubtotal \n\nSubtotal \n\n \n\n \n\nSubtotal \n\n \n \n \n\nTotal  \nJBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, JICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n15.00 \n58.00 \n137.50 \n40.00 \n80.00 \n28.80 \n68.00 \n200.00 \n74.25 \n45.60 \n115.00 \n68.70 \n65.00 \n995.85 \n \n10.00 \n6.00 \n102.00 \n25.00 \n146.80 \n200.00 \n270.96 \n785.76 \n \n4.40 \n56.00 \n74.00 \n200.00 \n50.40 \n21.23 \n\n1.66 \n116.93 \n77.85 \n602.47 \n \n19.00 \n14.00 \n6.50 \n8.50 \n10.30 \n58.30 \n \n25.80 \n \n25.00 \n69.00 \n10.00 \n7.00 \n20.90 \n37.94 \n11.00 \n180.84 \n \n3.50 \n2.50 \n30.00 \n33.70 \n17.38 \n87.08 \n \n25.00 \n \n21.63 \n22.00 \n43.63 \n \n2,779.73 \n\nYear of \nApproval \n1977 \n1985 \n1987 \n1988 \n1989 \n1991 \n1993 \n1994 \n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2002 \n \n \n1979 \n1982 \n1987 \n1989 \n1994 \n1994 \n1998 \n \n \n1985 \n1986 \n1991 \n1994 \n1997 \n1998 \n\n1999 \n1997 \n2001 \n \n \n1986 \n1989 \n1991 \n1996 \n1988 \n \n \n1987 \n \n1981 \n1986 \n1994 \n1999 \n1995 \n1998 \n1999 \n \n \n1981 \n1983 \n1993 \n1999 \n2001 \n \n \n1991 \n \n1998 \n1996 \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4       25\n\nDETAILS OF SECTOR AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROGRAM \n\n \n1. \nIntegration  of  Transport  Policy,  Planning,  and  Appraisal  Capacity  within  the \nMinistry of Communications. Implementation of the national land transport policy  (NLTP) is \ncontingent  on  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Communication  (MOC)  fo r integrated transport \nsector planning and appraisal. MOC will establish a transport sector coordination (TSC) wing, \nheaded by an additional secretary, adequately staffed, and assisted by outside experts by mid -\n2004. The TSC wing will have a sector-wide multimodal remit to develop a program approach to \nimplement  NLTP.  The  TSC  wing  will  draw  up  a  new  appraisal  method  to  develop  a  rational \nbasis for resource allocation across modes of transport in line with NLTP. With the initiative of \nthe TSC wing, the Government will prepare, approve, and start implementation of the NLTP \naction  plan  by  2004,  and  prepare  and  approve  a  long-term  land  transport  strategy  and \ninvestment program by 2005.  \n \n2. \nRoads  and  Highways  Department  Modernization  and  Strengthening.  Roads and \nHighways  Department\u2019s  (RHD)  new  organization  structure,  developed  by  IDC3,  proposes \nfunctional  units  for  maintenance,  highways  and  construction,  bridges,  and  management \nservices, with each, except management services, responsible for planning and design as well \nas construction. MOC  issued and executed orders for RHD\u2019s reorganization  and RHD  will  be \nfully reorganized by the end of 2004. Changing the structure alone will not ensure accrual of \nexpected benefits unless management procedures and budgetary systems are reformed. RHD \nwill  introduce  improved  budgetary  and  financial  monitoring  systems  that IDC3 will develop by \nmid-2005. \n \nThe new structure, however, concentrates on improving organizational efficiency at RHD \n3. \nheadquarters and intends to retain the current structure and functions of seven field zones. RHD \nwill  initiate  its  second-generation  reorganization,  focusing  mainly  on  field  or  zonal  level,  to \nbecome  a  strategic  manager  and  procurer  of  services.  RHD  will  prepare  and  appro ve  its \nsecond-generation organization by mid-2005, and implement it in full by the end of 2008. \n \n4. \nRoad Maintenance Funding. With concerted efforts of aid agencies, the Government \nstarted  to  determine  the  best  form  of  guaranteed  funding  for  road  maintenance. A series of \nseminars has shared knowledge about a road fund. At a seminar held in January 2003 in the \npresence of the ministers of communications and of finance and planning, the road fund was \nconsidered a viable way to sustain financing for road maintenance. The Government will confirm \nits intention to develop a road fund as a condition of project loan appraisal. The Government will \ncomplete  studies  and  consultations  on  establishing  road  fund  mechanism  to  finance  road \nmaintenance  requirements  with  stakeholders\u2019 oversight by the end of 2004, and approve and \nintroduce a road fund mechanism by mid-2005. \n \nPrivatization of the  Roads and Highways Department\u2019s Plant and Equipment, and \n5. \nWorkshops  Functions.  RHD\u2019s  mechanical  wing  provides  all  mechanical  services,  including \nprocurement,  O&M,  and  repair  of  construction  equipment,  vehicles,  and  ferries.  Traditionally \nRHD owned all construction equipment and rented it at rates below cost to contractors as they \ncould not own su ch equipment themselves. Now contractors are being required to provide their \nown  construction  equipment.  To  facilitate  equipment  ownership  by  private  contractors,  the \nmechanical  wing  established  a  plant  pool  to  commercially  rent  out  equipment  to  contractors, \nwho will eventually recognize that they should have their own equipment. Foreseeing that the \nrole of the mechanical wing will gradually shrink, RHD will study the feasibility of privatizing its \nplant,  equipment,  and  workshops,  and  have  the  study\u2019s  recommendations  and  action  plan \napproved by the end of 2004 and implemented by mid-2005.   \n\n\f \n\n26\n\nAppendix 4 \n\nModernization and Strengthening of the  Bangladesh  Road  Transport  Authority. It  \n6. \n(i) licenses all vehicle types and driver and vehicle fitness testing, (ii) regulates road transport \nservices,  and  (iii)  provides  secretarial  services  for  NRSC  through  the  road  safety  cell. The \nGovernment will formally establish the road safety cell funded by external agency and provide \nadditional professional staff and annual budget for its activities by mid-2004. The Government \nwill also prepare and approve the BRTA institutional reform program by 2005, focusing on the \nagency\u2019s regulatory functions and roadside enforcement capacity. \n \n\n\fRoad Map for Road Sector Reform\n\nAppendix 4        27\n\nActivity\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006-8\n\nMain \nSupporter\n\n1.

The  suggested \nimprovements are full reconstruction following the current alignment but including widening and \ncorrecting substandard curves, and construction of bypasses to avoid densely inhabited market \nplaces.  \n \nAs  required  by  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n3.  \n(TA),  the  consultant  conducted  the  feasibility  study  for  the  project  roads  and  prepared \npreliminary  designs.  The  TA  consultant  designed  the  project  roads  in  accordance  with \ninternational  standards  and  procedures  but  largely  followed Roads and Highways Department \n(RHD)  geometric  design  standards  and  guidelines  for  bridge  design,  respectively,  for  cross-\nsection parameters of roads and structural configurations.

The cross section consists of motorized traffic lanes of 7.3 meter (m), 5.5 \nm,  and  3.65  m,  respectively,  for  national,  regional,  and  district  roads,  with  two  surfaced \nshoulders of 1.5 m for all types of road. A feature that adds to the overall cost but is considered \nnecessary  for  safety  and  traffic  flow  efficiency  is  surfaced  shoulders  along  the  length  of  each \nproject  road.  The  shoulders  will  provide  space  for  nonmotorized  and  slow  motorized  traffic  as \n\n\f \n\n \n\n30\n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwell as space for vehicle repairs, tire replacement, or mechanical breakdown, without disturbing \ntraffic flow or posing high traffic safety risks. \n \n\nPavements \n\n3. \n \n6.  \nThe pavements were designed in accordance with accepted international standards and \nprocedures  for  a  20-year  life,  with  provision  for  overlays  during  or  at  the  end  of  10  years  to \ncover  the  serviceability  loss  and  extend  the  life  to  20  years  while  maintaining  international \nroughness  index  at  the  recommended  level.  The  designs  will  be  based  on  traffic  counts  and \ntraffic projections (for capacity), and axle-load surveys and projections (for structural capacity). \nThe  pavement  structure  will  consist  typically  of  an  improved subgrade, a granular subbase of \nbrick  aggregate,  a  base  of  stone  aggregate,  asphaltic  concrete  surfacing  (base  course  and \nwearing  course),  or  double  bituminous  surface  dressing.  Roughness  values  for  the  completed \npavements, expressed in international roughness index terms, should be 2.0\u20132.5. \n\n4.  \n\nBridges and Drainage Structures \n\n \n7.  \nThe  structures  were  designed  in  accordance  with  AASHTO  standards. AASHTO HS20 \nlive  loading  was  adopted  and  a  return  period  of  20  years  considered  for  drainage  structures. \nImprovement  of  structures  includes  (i)  rehabilitating  bridges/culvert  decks,  and  widening \nstructures according to road section and RHD guidelines; (ii) reconstructing structures that must \nbe  replaced  because  of  structural  and  hydrological  inadequacy;  and  (iii)  constructing  new \nstructures on realigned sections.  \n \n B. \n \n8.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDetails of the roads for improvement are in the table below: \n\nRoads for Improvement \n\n\f  \n\n \n\nDetails of Preliminary Design of Roads \n\nMymensingh Region \n\nDhaka Region \n\nRangpur Region \n\nBhaluka- \nKishoreganj \n \n45.4 \n2 lanes  \n \n \n3.5\u20135.5 m  traffic \nlane \n \n5.5 m traffic  \nlane \n\n \n \n1.27 m each,  \nno pavement \n \n3.35 m each,  \n1.5 m paved \nReconstruction \n\nNandail- \nKishoreganj \n \n15.0 \n2 lanes  \n \n \n5.5 m traffic  \nlane \n \n5.5 m traffic lane \n\n \n \n1.805 m each, \nno pavement \n \n3.35 m each,  \n1.5 m paved \nReconstruction \n\n \nLength (km) \nNumber of Lanes  \nPavement Width \n \n  Current \n \n \n  Design \n\nShoulder Width \n \n  Current \n \n \n  Design \n\nImprovement Type \nPavement (typical) \n \nBituminous Surface \nDressing (mm) \n \nAsphalt Concrete  \n(mm) \n \nAggregate Base (mm) \n \nAggregate Subbase \n (mm) \n \nImproved Subgrade \n(mm) \n \nConstruction Cost \n ($ million)  \n\n \n\n     m = meter, mm = milimeter \n     \u2014 = no data available. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n100 \n \n275 \n \n275 \n \n \n300 \n\n \n34.1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n100 \n \n275 \n \n275 \n \n \n300 \n\n \n8.2 \n\nKaliakoir Bypass \n\n \n3.2 \n2 lanes  \n \n \n \u2014   \n \n \n7.3 m traffic lane \n\n \n \n \u2014 \n \n \n2.45 m each, \n1.5 paved \nNew Construction \n \n \n \n \n \n120 \n \n330 \n \n225 \n \n \n300 \n\nPanghagarh- \nBanglabandh \n \n57.0 \n2 lanes  \n \n \n3.2 - 7.3 m \ntraffic lane \n \n7.3 m traffic  \nlane \n\n \n \n1.28 - 2.75 m \neach  \n \n2.75 m each, \n1.5 m paved \nReconstruction \n \n \n \n \n \n100 \n \n250 \n \n300 \n \n \n500 \n\nParbatipur- \nMadhyapara \n \n44.0 \n2 lanes  \n \n \n5.5 m traffic \nlane \n \n \n5.5 m traffic \n lane \n \n \n1.5 m each, \n no pavement \n \n2.45 m each, \n1.5 m paved \nReconstruction \n \n \n \n \n \n125 \n \n250 \n \n250 \n \n \n200 \n\nBoda- \nNilphamari \n \n52.6 \n2 lanes  \n \n \n3.2 - 5.5 m \ntraffic lane \n \n \n5.5 m traffic \n lane \n \n \n1.295 - 1.38 m \neach, no \npavement \n2.45 m each,  \n1.5 m paved \nReconstruction \n \n \n \n \n \n100 \n \n250 \n \n200 \n \n \n200 \n\n \n6.9 \n\n \n12.9 \n\n \n22.1 \n\n \n23.5 \n\nChittagong \nRegion \nChittagong- \nDohazari \n \n26.2 \n2 lanes  \n \n \n5.5 - 7.3 m traffic \nlane \n \n7.3 m traffic lane \n\n \n \n1.25 - 2.45 m \neach \n \n2.45 m each, \n1.5 m paved \nReconstruction \n\n \n \n \n \n \n120 \n \n330 \n \n225 \n \n \n300 \n\n \n14.2 \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n1\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nCRITERIA FOR SELECTING \nPERIODIC ROAD MAINTENANCE SUBPROJECTS \n\n \n1. \nThe periodic road maintenance component will finance a time slice of road maintenance \nunder  the  Roads  and  Highways  Department  (RHD)  from  its  annual  road  maintenance  plan \n(ARMP).  The  work  will  be  divided  into  two  annual  tranches  and  implemented  over  2  years.  \nEach tranche will cover civil works valued at about $12 million equivalent, providing for periodic \nmaintenance of about 300 kilometers (km) of roads. \n \n2. \nRoads to be included will need Asian Development Bank (ADB) approval. They will be \nselected  annually  in  order  of  estimated  economic  returns,  based  on  rankings  produced  each \nyear by ARMP, and subject to the criteria listed below. Among roads satisfying the listed criteria, \npreference  will  be  given  to  roads  that  were  previously  improved  with  ADB  assistance.  The \ncriteria for selecting subprojects for the periodic maintenance program follow: \n \n\nThe  roads  are  included  in  ARMP  and  have  been  given  priority  in  periodic \nmaintenance tasks, using the highway design and maintenance standards model. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe roads are within the districts of Dinajpur, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, \nNilphamari, Panchagarh, Rangpur, and Thakurgaon in the northwest region; and \nJamalpur, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, Netrokona, and Sherpur in the central north \nregion. \n\nThe  proposed  civil  works  will  be  limited  to  periodic  maintenance  consisting  of \noverlay  and  sealing  works,  but  excluding  road  development,  upgrading,  and \nwidening  except  in  specific  locations  approved  by  ADB  such  as  market  places \nand bus bays. \n\nBased  on  a  minimum  10-year  evaluation  period  using  full  life-cycle costs and \nbenefits, the estimated economic internal rate of return for the road maintenance \nworks will be at least 20%. \n\nThe  proposed  works  will  not  adversely  affect  the  environment  and  will  include \nmitigation measures acceptable to ADB where adverse environment impacts are \nanticipated. \n\nSufficient Government counterpart funding from the RHD budget will be allocated \nto implement the works as scheduled. \n\nTo facilitate efficient subproject implementation and to encourage participation by \nqualified  contractors,  the  civil  works  will  be  arranged  in  packages  each  with an \nestimated value of at least $1 million. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        Appendix 7          33 \n\nPERFORMANCE-BASED MAINTENANCE CONTRACT \n\nConcept \n\n \nA. \n \nA  performance-based  maintenance  contract  is  an  agreement  between  a  government \n1. \ndepartment or state enterprise and a private contractor whereby the private contractor maintains \nthe road to achieve specified condition standards for a certain period (usually long term, ranging \nfrom 3 to 10 years) in return for a fixed payment stream. \n \n2. \nThe concept of a performance-based contract originated from a consideration of (i) the \nincreasing lack of personnel within the  government department to measure the vast quantity of \nactivities  involved  in  the  more  traditional  maintenance  contracts,  and  to  monitor  performance \nstandards using input indicators; (ii) the frequency of claims resulting from the need to increase \nthe  quantity  of  activities  in  the  original  contracts;  (iii)  the  need  to  focus  more  on  customer \nsatisfaction; and (iv) the need to shift greater responsibility to contractors throughout the entire \ncontract period, as well as to stimulate and profit from their innovative capabilities.1 \n \n3. \nThe  performance-based  contract  is  different  from  a  traditional  quantity-  and  unit-price-\nbased,  short-term  maintenance  contract.  In  the  traditional  maintenance  contract,  the  private \nsector maintains an existing road based on input indicators, such as materials, equipment, and \nlabor, and, more frequently, tons of pothole patch material used, number of linear meters of pipe \nculverts  replaced,  and  number  of  square  meters  of  crack  sealed.  In  the  performance-based \ncontract,  the  private  sector  maintains  an  existing  road  on  the  basis  of  customer-based \nperformance indicators, such as riding and strength quality (smoothness), safety features, and \naesthetic and attractiveness of the roadside. \n \n4. \nfrom  a  road  operation  and \nmaintenance  concession.  Under  the  performance-based  contract,  performance  risks  are \nallocated between the government or client and the contractor. However, the traffic risk remains \nwith \nthe \nconcessionaire  assumes  the  traffic  and,  ultimately,  the  revenue  risks.  The  concessionaire \ncollects toll, maintains the road, and pays an agreed-upon amount to the government. Since the \nrisk  from  uncertain  traffic  is  to  be  borne  by  the  private  sector,  the  road  operation  and \nmaintenance concession is suitable only for roads with sufficient traffic volume. For low-volume \nroads,  the  performance-based  contract  may  prove  a  promising  alternative  modality  for  private \nsector participation in road maintenance. \n \n5. \nPerformance-based maintenance is especially suitable for low-volume roads with gravel \nsurface  or  thin  bituminous  surface  treatments,  as  the  continued  serviceability  of  such  roads \ndepends  on  the  quality  and  reliability  of  future  maintenance.  Performance-based maintenance \noffers  an  effective  means  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  public  accountability  of  road \nmaintenance  operations.  Other  benefits  include  improved  service  to  road  users  and  reduced \nsize  of  the  government  establishment  (staff,  equipment,  and  workshops)  needed  for  road \nmaintenance operations. In the long run, this approach will significantly reduce the unit cost of \nmaintenance  operations  while  improving  the  quality  and  cost-effectiveness  of  maintenance \nworks. \n\nthe  road  operation  and  maintenance  concession, \n\nThe  performance-based  contract \n\nthe  government.

These  standards  should  be  defined  to  minimize  the  long-term cost of \npreserving the road, as well as the cost to the road user.

Inspectors may be hired to \ninspect the road and make random checks regularly to verify compliance. Road users may also \nbe  encouraged  to  take  an  important  role  in  monitoring  performance  by  reporting  road \ndeficiencies to the road agency. A percentage of noncompliance may be calculated based on a \nformula incorporated in the contract, by which penalties are applied. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe guiding principle for the bidding processes should be to maximize competition and \nclarity of the process. The major aspects that should be considered to ensure competitive and \ntransparent bidding processes follow: \n \n\nBidding Processes \n\nDetailed  development  of  the  contract  should  be  set  out  clearly  in  the  bidding \ndocuments, specifying the responsibilities of the contractor and the government. \n\nA draft contract agreement should be prepared by the government and included \nin the bidding documents to ensure that all bidders make similar assumptions. \n\n \nThe evaluation criteria should be clearly set out in the bidding documents. The most transparent \napproach  is  to  select  a  single  criterion,  perhaps  the  lowest  level  of  bid  price  for  a  given \nperformance specification. The decision should be made only after prequalification procedures \nwhere  potential  bidders  are  evaluated  in  terms  of  their  technical,  operational,  and  financial \ncapacity. \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\f        Appendix 8          35\n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($ million)\n\nProject Cost\n\nFinancing Source\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nADB\n\nGovernment\n\nItem\n\nA.

Three  are  part  of  national  highways,  one  regional  highway,  and  other  three  are \ndistrict  road. Three in the northwest, three in the north central, and one in the southeast regions. \nImprovement of these roads will provide rural farmers with better access to markets, social services, \nand jobs; improve boarder access; and complete some missing links in the main road network.  \n \nB. \n \n\nTraffic Analysis and Projections  \n\n1. \n\nBase-Year Traffic \n\n2. \nFor the purpose of traffic analyses, representative vehicles used in the Roads and Highways \nDepartment (RHD) (Table A13.1, column 1) were selected based on traffic surveys. Road base-year \ntraffic was estimated on the basis of growth potentials, historical trends, classified traffic counts, and \norigin-destination (O-D) surveys carried out in the project areas, and adjustment of seasonal factors.  \n \nTable A13.1: Base Year Traffic by Project Road  \n(units) \n\nRepresentative \nVehicles \n\nBhaluka- \nKishoreganj  \n\nNandail- \nKishoreganj  \n\nParbatipur- \nMadhyapara \n\nBoda- \nNilphamari \n\nPanchagarh- \nBanglabandh \n\nChittagong\n-Dohazari \n\nJoydebpur-\nKaliakoir \n\nHeavy Truck \nMedium Truck \nSmall Truck \nLarge Bus \nMedium Bus \n\nMicro Bus \nCar \nUtility \nAuto-Rickshaw \nMotor Cycle \nTotal Motorized \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n0 \n165 \n42 \n1 \n25 \n\n36 \n163 \n28 \n77 \n325 \n863 \n\nBicycle \nRickshaw \nCart \nTotal \nNonmotorized \n\n  1,345 \n  2,878 \n50 \n \n \n \n  4,274 \n       Source: Consultant surveys. \n \n \n\n0 \n228 \n88 \n251 \n51 \n\n104 \n65 \n65 \n91 \n306 \n1,249 \n\n1,134 \n1,478 \n8 \n \n2,620 \n\nMotorized \n0 \n291 \n94 \n5 \n139 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n104 \n \n92 \n \n51 \n \n54 \n \n \n522 \n  1,352 \nNonmotorized \n  1,383 \n  2,209 \n2 \n \n \n \n  3,595 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n0  \n70 \n9 \n40 \n63 \n\n \n49 \n \n40 \n23 \n \n  161 \n  1,186 \n  1,642 \n\n  2,748 \n  1,816 \n \n3 \n \n  4,567 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n0 \n200 \n20 \n5 \n50 \n\n76 \n55 \n66 \n40 \n250 \n762 \n\n2,300 \n1,850 \n10 \n\n4,160 \n\n \n\n \n30 \n  1,427 \n490 \n \n450 \n \n250 \n \n\n276 \n \n120 \n \n170 \n \n450 \n \n \n550 \n  4,213 \n\n  1,200 \n  2,500 \n0 \n \n \n \n  3,700 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n403  \n1,731 \n977 \n1,487 \n1,627 \n\n1,315 \n1,442 \n1,232 \n1,424 \n1,236 \n12,874 \n\n958 \n1,816 \n346 \n\n3,120 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Projections  \n\nEstimates were made on the present volume of traffic on each project road, volume of traffic \n3. \nlikely to be generated after improvement, and volume of traffic likely to be diverted from alternative \nroads as a result of improvement. Traffic projections were estimated from the analyses of historical \ntraffic  growth  during  last  two  decades,  gross  domesic  product  (GDP)  growth  pattern,  population, \nvehicle fleet, industrial production, growth of nonfarm activities, traffic counts, traffic diversions, and \nO-D survey results. Road traffic increased at about 8% per annum during the 1980s and 1990s. The \nkey factor used to estimate the projected traffic was income elasticity of traffic demand. Over the \nanalyses  period  2002\u20132006,  GDP  growth  was  projected  to  be  5.0\u20135.5%, and elasticity of traffic \ndemand 1.20\u20131.35. The resultant traffic growth factors estimated are in Table A13.2. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13       41 \n\n \n\nTable A13.2: Traffic Growth by Vehicle Category  \n(%) \nMotorized \nPassenger \n7.4  \n6.9  \n6.3  \n\n \nFreight \n7.2 \n6.6 \n6.0 \n\nNon-\nmotorized \n6.0  \n \n5.0  \n \n5.0  \n \n\n \n \n \n\nPeriod  \n \n2002-2007 \n \n2007-2012 \n2012-2026 \n \nSource: Consultant estimate. \n\n \n\n \n \nRoad improvement and maintenance will induce the generated traffic, i.e., traffic that did not \n4. \nexist  before  the  investment,  as  an  incentive  to  reduce  transport  costs  and  journey  time,  and \nincrease  comfort.  Additional  traffic  will  be  generated  as  a  result  of  the  increased  volume  of \nagricultural produces, processing, and marketing due to reduced transport costs. Generated traffic \nwas estimated to increase conservatively by 10%. In some cases traffic diversion will take place in \nlarge  volume,  particularly  on  the  Bhaluka -Kishoreganj  road.  Dhaka -bound traffic from Kishoreganj \nwill be attracted to divert to this road from Mymensingh-Kishoreganj and Bhairab Bazar-Kishoreganj \nroads due to distance savings of more than 60 kilometer in each case.  \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n1. \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries \n\n \n The direct and quantifiable project benefits include vehicle operating costs savings  (VOCs) \n5. \nfor normal, generated, and diverted traffic; time savings; and recurrent and periodic maintenance \nsavings.  The  indirect  benefits  are  increased  agricultural  output,  business  and  other  economic \nactivities,  and  local  enterprise  growth.  These  benefits  have  been  estimated  as  generated  traffic. \nUsing a road design model that allowed for differences in roughness, terrain, speed, and congestion \nfacilitated  the  estimation  of  benefits.  Unquantifiable  benefits  include  greater  riding  comfort  for \npassengers  and  reduced  damage \nto  commodities  carried,  and  other  benefits,  including \nenvironmental and health improvement and improved access to basic education.  \n\n6. \nThe  beneficiaries  include  those  benefiting  directly  from  investments  and  those  benefiting \nindirectly because of their dependence on the impact zones of the roads. Project beneficiaries are of \nvarious categories of road users such as the owners, operators, bus and truck crews, passengers of \nall types of vehicles, cargo owners, and the population in the impact zone in general. Benefits in the \nform of reduced transport costs, accrued to transport owners and operators, are expected to be \nevenly  distributed  among  all  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries  due  to  competitive  situation  in  the \nindustry. \n \n\n2. \n\nEvaluation Approach and Methodology \n\n7. \nThe evaluation examines road conditions, traffic volume and importance of road, network, \ninvestment  and  maintenance  costs,  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time  costs  with  and  without \nthe project for 20 years after improvement. All co sts are valued at border prices, using a world price \nnumeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to \nnon-traded  items  and  labor.  The  evaluation  was  carried  out  using  the  highway  design  and \nmaintenance model 4 (HDM-4), which has been calibrated for conditions in Bangladesh under the \nInstitutional  Development  Components  (IDC)  of  Road  Rehabilitation  and  Maintenance  Project \n(RRMP)  projects  funded  under  the  World  Bank  Consortium.  The  economic  evaluation  involved \ncomparison of cost and benefit streams under \u201cwithout\u201d and \u201cwith\u201d project conditions, over a fixed \nanalysis  period.  The  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  situation  is  the  base  case  or  the  \u201cdo-minimum\u201d case, where \nstatus quo on the project road is maintained with minimum maintenance, and no major improvement \nwork is taken up. The \u201cwith project\u201d case provides for major improvement. For generated traffic, half \nof the benefits of normal traffic were assigned. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n3.  \n\nConstruction Costs \n\n \n  \n8. \nThe  economic  costs  of  road  construction  and  maintenance  are  expressed  in  early  2003 \nprices (Table A13.3) and derived from the financial costs by deducting taxes and duties from the \ncosts  of  imported  equipment  and  materials  and  applying  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  for \nnontraded   items  and  labor.  Construction  costs  include  physical  contingencies,  land  acquisition, \nenvironmental mitigation, and resettlement costs as well as construction supervision.  \n\n \nTable A13.3: Construction Costs \n(Tk million) \n\nRoad \nBhaluka-Kishoreganj \nNandail-Kishoreganj  \nParbatipur-Madhyapara  \nBoda-Nilphamari \nJoydebpur-Kaliakoir \nPanchagarh-Banglabandh \nChittagong-Dohazari \n    Source: Consultant estimate. \n\n  Per km \n38.31  \n27.88  \n26.56  \n23.82  \n105.26  \n12.34  \n24.70  \n\n  Total \n  1,739  \n \n418  \n  1,168  \n  1,253  \n337  \n \n    703  \n647  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nVehicle Operating Costs and Time Costs \n\n \n \n \n \n9. \nVehicle operating costs for representative motorized vehicles are those prepared jointly by \nthe IDC and RHD and updated for 2001. VOCs were derived from the financial costs by excluding \nall applicable  taxes  and  duties  such  as  custom  duties,  development  surcharge,  supplementary \nduties, value-added tax, advance income tax, and import permit fees. For fuels, the economic costs \nof petrol, diesel, and lubricants have been calculated by excluding the tariff and other implicit taxes \nand  including  the  economic  costs  of  distribution  expenses.  For  nonmotorized  vehicles  operating \ncosts  and  other  operating  parameters  developed  by  RHD  under  IDC  have  been  used.  Financial \ncosts of nontraded items, net of taxes and duties, were converted into economic costs applying a \nconversion factor of 0.9.

Construction  was assumed to be spread over 3 years with about 20% of works being \ncompleted  in  the  first  year,  40%  in  the  second  year,  and  the  remaining  40%  in  the  third  year. \nPeriodic  maintenance  and/or  overlays  were  assumed  to  be  applied  every  6\u20138  years  after \ncompletion,  depending  on  the  volume  of  traffic  and  truck  loading  pattern.  The  results  of  the \neconomic evaluation are in Table A13.6.  \n \n12. \nEIRR for seven roads varies between 17% to 43%, with a consolidated EIRR of 26.2%. At \n12% rate of discount, net prese nt value (NPV) calculated for each project road ranges from Tk295 \nmillion to Tk3,821 million. The consolidated NPV for seven roads amounts to Tk9,202 million.  \n\n \nTable A13.6: Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value  \n\n \n\nRoad \nBhaluka -Kishoreganj \nNandail-Kishoreganj  \nParbatipur-Madhyapara  \nBoda-Nilphamari \nJoydebpur-Kaliakoir \nPanchagahr-Banglabandh \nChittagong -Dohazari \n \n\nTotal   \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n  19.5 \n  21.0 \n  21.1 \n  17.0 \n  41.8 \n  17.5 \n  43.1 \n  26.2 \n\nNPV \n(Tk million) \n \n994  \n \n296  \n \n830  \n572  \n \n  3,821  \n \n420  \n  2,369  \n  9,202  \n\nRisk and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n \n7. \n \nA review of the various factors affecting EIRR indicates that the main risk for the viability of \n13. \nthe  investment  is  premature  road  failure  due  to  inadequate  maintenance.  The  project  includes \nmeasures to address these risks by helping the government to establish and implement appropriate \npolicies. \n \nThe  robustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  viability  was  tested  through  sensitivity  analysis  (Table \n14. \nA13.7).  A  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  performed  for  cases  of  cost  increased by 15%, benefits \nreduced  by  15%,  a  combination  of  both,  construction  delayed  by  1  year,  and  maintenance  after \nconstruction carried out at a less-than -optimal  level.  The  sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  reduction  in \nin  cost,  that  implementation  delay  by  1  year  is  not \nbenefit  is  more  sensitive  than  increase \nsignificantly sensitive, and that the less-than-optimal maintenance has as much a significant effect \non  EIRR  as  reduction  of  benefits  by  15%.  For  the  Chittagong -Doharazi  road,  the  sensitivity  was \n\n \n\n \n\n\ftested for construction delay by 3 years since relatively extensive resettlement and land acquisition \nare anticipated for this road. The EIRR was reduced by a quarter from 43.1% to 31.5%. Although \nthe  reduced  EIRR  still  supports  the  improvement  works  for  the  road,  all  efforts  will  be  made  to \nminimize the construction delay so as to fully achieve the expected economic rate of return. \n\n \nTable A13.7: Economic Internal Rate of Return Sensitivity Analysis  \n\nConstruction \nCost \n+ 15% \n(%) \n\nBenefits \n- 15% \n(%) \n\n17.0 (0.46) \n17.5 (0.39) \n18.3 (0.49) \n15.1 (0.39) \n15.7 (0.44) \n37.2 (0.98) \n37.9 (0.90) \n\n16.7 (0.40)  \n17.0 (0.33)  \n17.9 (0.43)  \n14.8 (0.33)  \n15.4 (0.38)  \n36.5 (0.85)  \n37.1 (0.78)  \n\nCost \n + 15% \nBenefits  \n- 15% \n(%) \n14.7 \n15.1 \n15.9 \n13.3 \n13.6 \n33.2 \n34.0 \n\nConstruction \nDelay by 1 \nyear (%) \n\nLess-Than-\nOptimal \nMaintenance  \n\n18.1 \n19.5 \n19.5 \n16.8 \n17.0 \n36.2 \n40.3 \n\n16.6 \n17.4 \n17.6 \n14.3 \n14.7 \n38.1 \n37.7 \n\n44 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n \n\nRoad \n\nBhaluka- Kishoreganj \nNandail- Kishorganj \nParbatipur- Madhyapara \nBoda- Nilphamari \nPanchagarh-Banglabandh \nJodebpur-Kaliakoir \nChittagong- Dohazari \n\n   Switching values in parenthesis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         Appendix 14         45 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  (SPRSS) \n\n \nYes \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nSector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty partnership \nagreement?  \n\n \nA. \n \nSector identified as a national priority in the \ncountry poverty analysis?  \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  of  the  Project  was  conducted  at  the  end  of  2002  and  early  2003, \nshowing  that,  aside  from  the  direct  employment  benefits  of  the  construction  aspect  of  road  projects, \nimproving  the  roads  sector  in  Bangladesh  does  have  some  positive  effects  on  reducing  poverty,  but  the \nresults vary by type of intervention. Based on the community consultations, that roads interventions alone \nwill  not  address  directly  to  poverty  reduction.  However,  based  on  the  qualitative  assessment,  the \ncommunities where roads have been constructed or improved indicated the following: \n \n\n \nYes \n\n\u2022  Farmers  stated  that  improved  roads  would  increase  their  production  substantially,  due  to  improved \naccess  to  fertilizer  and  seeds.  The  road  improvements  will  also  lead  to  increase  use  of  irrigation  and \ncash  crops,  so  labor  is  needed  throughout  the  year.  However,  according  to  several  researches,  the \nbenefits  from  the  improved  agricultural  production  accrued  primarily  to  the  larger  (and  likely  nonpoor) \nfarmers. Improved transport will lead to increased agricultural activities, which will increase demand for \nlabor, which will benefit the poor. \n\n \n\u2022  The respondents indicated that the Project would most likely have a direct effect on disposable income \nthrough lower freight transport costs and greater access to larger markets, resulting in increased trade \nrelated  profits.  In the same regard, the Project will most likely have a direct effect on road users as a \nresult of lower passenger fares and increased time savings, allowing road users more time and money \nto devote to other income-generating activities. \n\n \n\u2022  Improvement  of  road  conditions  may  lead  to  higher  migration  of  people  from  the  project  area,  which \nwould  have  two  potentially  positive  impacts.  Assuming  that  most  of  those  migrating  are  not  major \ncontributors  to  household  income,  induced  reduction  of  the  road  area  population  would  result  in \nincreased  per  capita  income.  In  addition,  those  migrating  could  send  remittances  to  remaining \ninhabitants  of  the  road  area,  further  increasing  household  income.  Based  on  the  focus  group \ndiscussion,  the  respondents  stated  that  the  Project  would  increase  land  values  significantly.  Gains \nwere even more impressive for the value of commercial land. \n\n \n\u2022  The  survey  also  attempts  to  address  other  non-income  areas  in  which  the  Project  could  potentially \nimprove quality of life. Improvements in some of  these areas are expected to result from the potential \nincome impact of the Project, including household purchasing power, food consumption, and access to \ncredit.  The  increased  accessibility  and  improved  travel  conditions  from  the  Project  could  result  in \nimprovement  of  other  quality  of  life  areas,  including  use  of  medical  services,  use  of  educational \nservices, and jobs.  \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \n \nB. \n \nWith  a  land  area  of  147,570  square  kilometers  and  population  estimated  at  130  million  in  2000, \nBangladesh  is  among  the  world\u2019s  most  densely  populated  countries.  It  also  has  one  of  the  highest \nincidences  of  poverty  in  the  world.  Most  statistics  indicate  that  about  half  of  the  total  population  is  poor \n(i.e., consuming less than 2,122 cal/person/day) and about a third of the total population is extremely poor \n(i.e., consuming less than 1,800 cal/person/day). Poverty as measured by income or income proxies such \nas  the  figures  above  is  substantially  more  pronounced  in  rural  areas  than  urban  areas.  According  to  the \nWorld  Bank,  the  incidence  of  poverty,  as  measured  by  the  cost  of  basic  needs  of  the  very  poor,  declined \n\nProposed Classification: PI \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 14  \n\nfrom  43%  to  36%  in  1991\u20131996.  However,  this  trend  masks  the  fact  that  poverty  remains  much  higher  in \nrural  areas  at  40%,  compared  to  urban  areas,  at  15%.  There  is  a  considerable  poverty  gap  across  the \ncountry.  Per  capita  income  is  highest  in  the  urban  centers  such  as  Dhaka,  Chittagong,  and  Khulna.  In \ncontrast  people  living  in  the  northern  and  southern  districts,  where  most  of  the  project  areas  are\u2014\nRangpur,  Gaibanda,  Jamalpur,  Nilphamari,  Sirajghon,  Sherpur,  Myemengsingh,  Gaziphur,  Tangail, \nDinajpur,  and  Thakurgaon\u2014have  per  capita  incomes  lower  than  the  national  average.  Over  half  the \npopulation in the northern districts and 40\u201350% in southern districts live in poverty. In Chittagong, poverty \nis  moderate.  According  to  the  1995/96  household  expenditure  survey,  35.3\u201347.2% of the rural population \nin Chittagong is poor.  \n \nThe poor are not limited to those unable to secure a minimum level of income or consumption. People who \nare  most  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters,  health  problems,  lack  of  jobs,  landlessness,  lack  of  social \nnetwork,  and  lack  of  a  political  voice  are  also  considered  poor.  Bangladesh  experiences  one  of  the \nheaviest  average  annual  rainfalls  in  the  world,  which  falls  mainly  during  the  monsoon  season.  During  the \nmonsoons,  massive  flooding  takes  place,  with  resulting  soil  erosion  and  changes  in  the  river  channels. \nThe low-lying area at the mouth of the Ganges is also susceptible to tidal waves, cyclones, and tornadoes. \nThe  severity  of  natural  disasters  is  exacerbated  by  the  precarious  nature  of  many  dwellings  lining  rivers \nand the coast.  \n \nBangladesh  suffers  from  some  of  the world\u2019s highest malnutrition levels and thus worst health problems: \nchildhood  protein-energy  deficiency,  maternal  undernutrition,  short  stature  and  anemia  in  expectant  and \nnursing  mothers,  and  micronutrient  deficiencies  affecting  all  ages.  In  1996\u201397,  more  than  half  of  all \nchildren under 5 were moderately or severely underweight, or suffering from moderate or severe stunting. \nMedical  facilities are scarce in Bangladesh and dominated by the public sector, which provides more than \n90%  of  the  country\u2019s  health  services.  In  1999  there  was  one  hospital  bed  for  4,128  persons,  1  physician \nfor  4,524  persons,  and  1  nurse  for  7,547  persons.  Access  to  health  services  is  more  restricted  than  in \nPakistan  and  India.  Spending  on  healthcare  and  family  planning  hovered  around  1%  of  gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in 1993\u20131998, and government health spending per person is around $3.60 annually. The \nliteracy  rate  (over  7  years  of  age)  is  around  50%  in  2000,  and  the  adult  literacy  rate  is  about  60%.  Large \ndisparities between urban and rural, and male and female literacy rates remain. \n \nThe  agricultural  sector  is  the  s  largest  employer  and  accounts  for  approximately  60%  of  the  labor  force. \nBangladesh  has  an  area  of  about  14  million  hectares ,  of  which  two  thirds  are  under  cultivation.  Over  the \nyears,  population  growth,  urbanization,  and  erosion  have  reduced  the  amount  of  land  under  cultivation. \nApproximately  5%  of  farm  households  own  and  operate  about  one  quarter  of  all  agricultural  land. \nAgricultural land is highly fragmented due to population growth and traditional inheritance laws. The issue \nof  landlessness  is  of  particular  importance.  Economic  pressures  exacerbate  this  problem  by  forcing \nindividuals  to  sell  the  entirety  of  any  remaining  landholdings  to  pay  off  debt  or  in  response  to  unforeseen \nevents,  such  as  natural  disasters  or  the  death  of  household  heads.  Two  concepts  of  landlessness  are \ncommonly  used.  One  is  complete  landlessness,  where  an  individual  does  not  have  any  land,  not  even  a \nhomestead.  According  to  1999  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  data,  approximately  10.2%  of  rural \nhouseholds  are  completely  landless.  The  second  definition  of  landlessness  refers  to  the  functionally \nlandless, i.e., those owning land up to 0.2 hectare, inclusive of both cultivable and homestead land. Those \nclassified  as  functionally  landless  account  for  53%  of  households.  Both  these  groups  survive  largely  on \ndaily wages and, to some extent, on petty trading. \n \n \nC. \n \nParticipatory Process in Project Design \n \nThe  consultants  conducted  surveys,  focus  group  discussions  (FGDs),  and  key  informants  in  all  project \nareas to collect the data necessary to complete the poverty and social analysis (PSA). The team met with \nofficials  from  the  government  and  other  organizations  to  incorporate  all  available  relevant  data.  The  team \nconducted 20 focus group discussions, about three to four per sample corridor, to prepare the PSA. FGDs \nenhanced  the  participatory  process  of  the  people  most  likely  to  be  affected  by  the  Project.

Two of the three conducted per corridor included a general mix of people, including key \ninformants, who are village or hamlet leaders, either holding elected positions in the  village  councils, or as \nowners  of  major  shops,  or  farms.  The  third  or  fourth  FGD  held  per  corridor  was  composed  of  women,  to \nfocus on gender issues faced by those in the project\u2019s zone of influence. \n \nParticipation strategy: \n \nThe public\u2019s response to the Project is strongly supportive and positive. Stakeholders\u2019 meetings were held \nduring  the  census and  surveys .  The  meetings  were  primarily  aimed  at  information  disclosure  about  the \nproposed  road  improvements  work,  objectives  of  the  census/survey  data  collection,  and  project \nimplementation schedule. Resettlement officials of project management unit will step up more information \ncampaigns and publish brochures on the project resettlement plan, payment procedures, and construction \nschedule  aimed  at  social  preparation  for  relocation  and  resettlement  of  the  affected  households/small \nbusiness  enterprises.  Nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  be  hired  to  assist  the  information \ncampaign  and  consultation  program,  road  safety  awareness,  and  resettlement-related  work  in  the  project \narea.  A  resettlement  advisory  committee  will  be  formed  to  conduct  dialogue  with  key  stakeholders  in \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. \n \nD. \n  \n \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women \n \nFrom  a  gender  viewpoint. \ntravel \nindependently.  There  was  a  marked  increase  in  school  attendance,  and  the  increase  was  greater  for \nwomen  than  men  along  the  improved  roads.  The  results  also  showed  increased  female  involvement  in \nspecific NGO-supported activities such as credit and handicrafts.  \n \nAn  important  dimension  of  inclusive  development  and  a  key  focus  area  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  involves  strengthening  participation  of  vulnerable  groups  in  mainstreaming  development, reducing \ngender  discrimination,  and  promoting  development  of  social  capital.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  combating \nHIV/AIDS 1  and  trafficking  women  and  children  directly  addresses  ADB\u2019s  strategic  goals:  reducing  poverty \nand  promoting  gender  equality.  An  information  campaign  on  HIV/AIDS  and  safe  migration  in  the  selected \nsource  areas  linked  to  the  roads  connected  is  included  in  as  a  project  component.

The  method  of  benefit  distribution \nfollowed  four  steps:  (i)  quantifying  direct  quantifiable  benefits  from  the  economic  analysis;  (ii) \nsurveying road users and assessing their socioeconomic and poverty status; (iii) assigning benefits \nto different road users, including those below the poverty line; and  (iv) establishing a poverty impact \nratio (PIR) for quantified benefits.  \n\n \n\nProject Development and Design Features \n\nB. \n \nSelection  of  Project  Regions  and  Roads.  Poverty  was  a  major  criterion  for  selecting \n2. \nproject  regions  and  roads.  It  was  also  an  important  consideration  in  the  studies,  participation  of \nstakeholders,  finalization  of  road  selection,  project  design,  and  implementation.  Project  districts \nwere  selected  on  the  basis  of  higher  incidence  of  spatial  income  poverty  and  socioeconomic \nbackwardness in the impact zones. For the purpose of poverty analyses, representative samples of \nroads,  particularly  district  roads,  were  selected  based  on  traffic  databases,  socioeconomic \nbackwardness, and poverty incidence. In national road selection, economic growth and transport \nservice improvement were also the main criteria besides poverty. In the final stage, a selection was \nmade from among the roads screened, taking into account funding constraints.  \n \n3. \nProject Design and Implementation. Road design takes into account innovative alignment \nand  pavement  design  to  accommodate  poor  people\u2019s  common  transport.  The  design  provides \nwider,  harder,  and  paved  shoulders,  facilitating  nonmotorized  traffic  (NMT)  where  operators  and \npassengers are mostly poor. The design will enhance the speed of NMT per hour, and driving and \nriding  comfort,  as  well  as  reduce  road  accidents.  Pro-poor  construction  methods  will  be  used, \nparticularly  in  earthwork,  embankment  construction,  local  material  procurement,  pavement \nconstruction,  shoulder maintenance, and tree plantation and nursing to employ poor unskilled and \nsemiskilled  workers  in  the  project  area  during  and  after  construction.  The  Project  will  employ  a \nsizable number of laborers from neighboring areas, increasing poor households\u2019 income, which, in \nturn, will help circulate more money. The Project will create more jobs in the NMT and MT sectors. \nConstruction  of  project  roads  will  require  skilled,  semiskilled,  and  unskilled  laborers.  Road \nmaintenance will create more jobs. Unskilled labor will be paid Tk539 million, and semiskilled labor, \nTk221 million. The total wage bill for road improvement will be Tk876 million, including payments to \nskilled laborers. The project design ensures that goods and services will be procured in a manner \nthat will benefit local suppliers. Project design also ensures gender equity. The Government will fix \nemployment targets for women in construction works. Construction contracts will not allow different \npay for men and women for comparable work.  \n \nC. \n \nBenefit  distribution  followed  four  steps:  (i)  quantifying  the  direct  and  quantifiable  benefits \n4.   \nfrom  the  economic  analysis  using  the evaluation  tool  of  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance \nStandards  Model  4;  (ii)  conducting  a  field  survey  of  transport  and  road  users  and  identifying \npotential beneficiaries and assessing their socioeconomic and income status; (iii) assigning shares \nof benefits to different beneficiaries, including those below the poverty line; and (iv) establishing a \nPIR for quantified benefits.  \n \n5.  Project beneficiaries are various road users such as owners, operators, and crews of buses and \ntrucks; passengers of all types of vehicles; cargo owners; and the population in the impact zone in \ngeneral.  Benefits  to  transport  owners  and  operators,  in  the  form  of  reduced  transport  costs,  are \nexpected to be evenly distributed among all stakeholders and beneficiaries due to competition in the \nindustry.

The share \nof  distribution  to  different  beneficiaries  depends  on  several  assumptions.  If  the  situation  is \ncompetitive for all vehicle categories on all roads after improvement, and free entry and exit are \ncommon  on  all  roads,  then  distribution  can  be  expected  to  be  fair  and  just.  If  the  situation  is \nmonopolistic,  then  owners  will  get  the  lion\u2019s  share  and  little  will  be  left  for  clients  or  other \nbeneficiaries.  However,  when  a  road  is  improved  in  Bangladesh,  traffic  starts  pouring  in \nimmediately, inducing growing competition in the market. Price undercutting is often observed. Fair \ncompetition can be assumed to continue after road improvement.  \n \n7. \nPassenger vehicle categories are (i) buses (large, medium-sized, mini, micro); (ii) cars, utility \nvehicles,  and  motorcycles;  (iii)  auto -tempos  and  baby  taxis;  and  (iv)  cycle  rickshaws/vans.  How \nbenefits  are  distributed  first  between potential beneficiaries and then between poor and nonpoor \nshould be examined.  \n8.    Only  the  nonpoor  can  afford  cars,  utility  vehicles,  and  motorcycles,  and  thus  all  benefits \naccruing to them go to the nonpoor. Two types of bus service are available: (i) low-cost, economy \nbuses  serving  short  distances  within  the  district  or  region;  and  (ii)  luxury  services  serving  usually \nlong -distance intercity routes. The first is a major traffic category in the project roads. The market for \neconomy bus service is open and competitive but route permits are regulated by the Bangladesh \nRoad Transport Authority (BRTA), which issues new route permits in consultation with local owners\u2019 \nassociations. Entry into the market and getting a route permit is relatively easy. BRTA fixes the bus \nfare  at  the  national  level  but  after  a  relatively  long  interval.  There  is  no  hard  and  fast  rule  to \nimplement  the  national  fare,  but  according  to  the  fixation  criteria  there  has  been  no  scope  for \ntransferring  VOC  savings  automatically  to  passengers. VOC benefits, however, are transferred to \npassengers  in  other  forms:  lagging  fare  increases  in  response  to  general  increase  in  input  costs, \nundercutting rates for over loaded passengers, etc. Around 60-70% of VOC savings are eventually \npassed on to the passengers.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f      Appendix 15        51 \n \n\nAuto -tempo services are unregulated in the sense that BRTA does not fix a uniform fare. \n9. \nEntry into the market is open and occurs in consultation with local transport associations and trade \nunions. Service operators are supposed to get a route permit but often do not. About 80% of VOC \nsavings  benefits  were  estimated  as  passed  on  to  passengers.  As  fares  have  recently  increased \nmore  than  fuel  prices,  70%  of  VOC  savings  from  road  improvement  are  estimated  to  accrue  to \npassengers. \n \n10. \nRickshaws and vans are common modes of rural and urban transport. The market is highly \ncompetitive  and  market  entry  or  exit  is  free,  even  in  towns.  Municipal  authorities  encourage \nrickshaw operators/pullers to register for a nominal fee. Typically the vehicles are owned by small \nbusinesspeople and rented out daily to pullers in towns and cities. In rural areas, however, half the \nowners  are  operators/pullers  themselves.  Standard  fares  are  usually  determined  by  forces  of \ndemand and supply. In cities and towns the fare increases when the weather is bad and during peak \ntraffic  hours.  Road  conditions  significantly  affect  rickshaw  VOC,  which  means  that  road \nimprovements bring fares down to a minimum. Several LGED studies observed that per kilometer \nfare  for  earth  road  was  over  Tk.3  per  person,  and  for  paved  road  usually  it  is  Tk.1  or  less, \ndepending on the length of journey. Owners will gain from road improvement in the project region by \nreducing  wear  and  tear  on  vehicles  and  reduced  maintenance  costs.  Rickshaw  pullers  will gain \nbecause they will be able to go faster with less effort and make more trips. Passengers will gain \nfrom lower fares and faster speeds. About 80% of savings were estimated to accrue to passengers. \n\n11.  Most  of  the  interdistrict  and  long-distance  ca rgo is carried by heavy, medium-weight, and \nlight trucks. Local cargo movements in rural areas, particularly of agricultural produce and inputs \nfrom farm gate to growth center markets and vice versa, are carried by rickshaw/rickshaw vans. The \ndistribution of VOC and time savings benefits accrued to cargo transport are distributed according to \nthe (i) nature of cargo transported in the project regions, (ii) competitive conditions in the regional \ntransport and product markets, and (iii) estimates of the poverty status of producers and consumers \nof the cargo transported through project roads. Cargo is broadly categorized as food grain, building \nmaterials, fruits and vegetables, cement, fertilizer, coal, iron and steel, sand, edible oil, and general \ncargo.  \n \n\n12. \nRegional  truck  markets  are  highly  competitive.  Truck  owners\u2019  associations  claim  that  the \ntruck supply is larger than demand. During the dry season and peak cargo movement season trucks \nare fully employed, but not in the rainy season. However, the rates are negotiable between truckers \nand cargo owners, and the outcome is related to several factors, of which demand and supply are \ndominant.  Produce  markets  are  also  relatively  competitive  and  forces  of  demand  and  supply \ndetermine the price. VOC savings due to  road improvement pass on to farmers as higher farm-gate \nprices.  Prices  of  agricultural  inputs,  such  as  seed,  fertilizer,  irrigation,  and  pesticide  are  less \ncompetitive  at  the  wholesale  level  but  more  so  at  the  retail  level,  with  the  result  that  a  large \nproportion of VOC savings will be passed on to the farmers. Some estimates put VOC savings for \ngeneral cargo owners at 35%, and for general consumers, 65%.  \n  \n13. \nClassification of Beneficiaries according to Poverty Status. To determine and update \nthe poverty line for the project districts, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000 was \nused. The analysis used the costs-of-basic-needs approach. The survey provides poverty estimates \nfor 14 areas\u20149 rural and 5 urban. The six project roads fall under three rural and one semi-urban \nareas. Upper and lower poverty-line estimates were updated for 2003, adjusting the consumer price \nindex: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52        Appendix 15 \n\nTable A15.2: Poverty Line Incomes for Project Regions, 2003 \n(per capita monthly expenditure in taka) \n\nLower Poverty Line  \n\nUpper Poverty Line  \n\n \n \n \n\n573 \n542 \n623 \n\n \n \n \n\n628 \n619 \n750 \n\n    Source: Household expenditure and Income Survey \u2013 2000, Bangladesh Bureau Statistics. \n\nRegions \n\nMymensingh  \nRangpur  \nChittagong  \n\n   \n \n\n14. \ndetermined after surveys of six roads.

For each passenger-vehicle category, \nthis  step  is  done  by  combining  the  percentages  of  the  first-level distribution of benefits (between \nowners and passengers) with the percentages of the second -level distribution of benefits (between \npoor  and  nonpoor).  For  cargo  this  is  done  by  combining  the  proportion  of  savings  accruing  to \nfarmers/laborers and consumers on the one hand, and the proportion of the poor among them on \nthe other. When these proportions are weighted by volume of transported commodities, an estimate \nis obtained of the proportion of total savings that accrue to people under the poverty line.  \n \n16.  When  the  six  roads  are  combined,  the  poor  comprise  0-10%  of  vehicle  owners;  50%  of \npassengers (traveling by bus, tempo, rickshaw, and bicycle); and 60% of producers and consumers \nof cargo (farmers, laborers). \n \nCalculating  the  Poverty  Impact  Ratio.  The  distribution  of  project  effect  and  PIR  is \n17. \nestimated for district roads, border access roads, and missing links. All amounts a re in net present \nvalue  using  a  discount  rate  of  12%,  calculated  by  estimating  (i)  net  present  value  of  financial \nbenefits by participating groups, (ii) net present values of economic benefits by participating groups, \nand (iii) economic benefits accruing to the poor according to the proportion of each poor group. A \nPIR expressing the proportion of net benefit accruing to the poor was calculated by comparing the \nnet economic benefits to the poor.  \n \nA  sensitivity  test  was  conducted  by  lowering  the  proportion  of  the  poor  among  vehicle \n18. \npassengers from 50% to 40%, and of producers of cargo from 60% to 30%. The sensitivity indicator \nfor the first case is around 0.8, while that for the second case almost zero.

Major portions of the alignments in the \nproject  area  largely  consist  of  agricultural  land,  homesteads,  and  small  business  enterprises \n(SBEs). Agriculture is the principal occupation, with close to 85% of the workforce dependent on \nagriculture and related activities. \n \n4. \nProject  construction  will  acquire  an  estimated  175.0  hectares  (ha):  (i)  156.0  ha  of \nagricultural land; (ii) 8.6 ha of homestead land; and (iii) 8.6 ha of SBEs\u2019 land. As a result, 5,272 \nhouseholds  will  lose  their  land  and  buildings,  and  SBEs  will  be  affected;  90%  of  all  affected \nhouseholds and  SBEs  (5,225)  have  clear  land  titles;  about  10%  families and  SBEs are illegal \noccupants and squatters on RHD\u2019s right of way (Table A16.2). Impact will be minimized during \ndetailed design by keeping the road improvement as much as possible within the existing right \nof way. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nTable A16.2: Type of Impacts and Number of Affected People  \n\n  \n\nRoad Number \n\nRoad Name \n\nLength \n(km) \n\nNumber of \nHouseholds \n\nTotal loss in \nEach Section \n(ha) \n \n41.2 \n7.3 \n0.8 \n78.9 \n8.1 \n36.8 \n17.6 (1.9) \n\n \nF3032/F3604 \nF5011/F5853 \nR360 \nF5003/F5707 \nN5 \nN1 \nN41 \n \n \n\n \nBhaluka-Kisgoreganj \nParbatipur-Madyapara \nNandali-Kisgoreganj \nBoda- Nilphamari \nPanchagar- Banglabandh \nChittagong-Dohazari \nKailakoir bypass \n\n \n46.4 \n44.0 \n15.0 \n52.6 \n57.0 \n26.2 \n3.2 \n\n \n1,257 \n \n1,399 \n \n214 \n \n1,244 \n \n385 \n \n \n726 \n  591 (47) \n\n \n5,272 \n\n \n\n \n\n244.4 \n\nTotal \n     ha = hectares, km = kilometers. \n     Source:  Consultant surveys . \n \n5. \nThe  nature  of  land  loss  and  impacts  as  indicated  by  the  project  social  analysis  report \nincludes a very small number of  affected people  (0.05%)  losing  their  entire  holding,  with  the \nremaining households experiencing only partial losses. About 0.2% of affected households will \nlose  entire  structures.  An  estimated  41%  of  affected  households  are  under  the  nationally \ndefined poverty line. The Project will not affect indigenous people. \n \n\n175.03 \n\n2. \n\nResettlement Audit for Kaliakoir Bypass \n\n \n6. \nPart  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Jamuna  Bridge  Access  Roads  Project, \napproved in 1997,  this section could not be completed under the earlier project due to lack of \nbudget. The 26 kilometer (km) bypass is part of the Joydevpur-Garai road section. The Project\u2019s \nresettlement plan was prepared in September 1996. This section required 17.4 hectares of land. \nAffected  people  total  591,  including  437  title  owners  and  154  indirectly affected (without titles, \nsharecroppers, squatters, and tenants).  \n \nIn  March  2003  an  independent  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  conducted  a \n7. \nresettlement audit for the proposed 3.24 km Kaliakoir bypass, showing that all indirectly affected \n154 people had received compensation. Of the 437 directly affected people, 390 had been paid. \nThe  remaining  47  affected  peoples  has  not  been  received  compensation  due  to  dubious \nauthenticity of title or ownership to the land as stated by the district commissioner. The deputy \ncommissioner determines the title or ownership of lost properties. The approved budget amount \nhas  been  transferred  to  the  deputy  commissioner  to  compensate  the  rest  of  the  affected \npeoples, which is a condition to award civil works contracts.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nA  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  in  January-February  2003  along  the  project \narea, covering 1,600 households or 30% of the total affected households. Based on estimated \nincomes from all sources, about 41% of the households are under the nationally defined poverty \nline.2 The survey collected detailed data on assets likely to be affected, ownership and tenure \n\nFindings of Socioeconomic Survey \n\n                                                 \n1 See subsection 2 of the resettlement audit for Kalaikoir bypass (N1). \n2  More  than  47%  of  the  population  is  getting  less  than  2,212  calories/day/person  (BBS  1995/96),  which  is  an     \n\nindicator of the absolute poverty. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n    Appendix 16       55 \n  \n\nResettlement Principles and Compensation \n\nstatus  of  land,  income,  and  other  socioeconomic  parameters.  The  social  assessment  report \nindicates that the Project will affect few community structures and common properties. \n \n9. \nThe  qualitative  survey  of  female-headed  affected  households  indicated  women\u2019s \nconcerns  about  sustaining  their  sources  of  livelihood.  Other  vulnerable  groups  are  landless \nhouseholds  or  squatters,  and  the  disabled.  The  vulnerable  groups  will  receive  additional \nassistance through an income rehabilitation program. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nIn the absence of a national policy on resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) of persons \ndisplaced  by  development  projects,  the  project  policy  is  to  compensate  and  help  affected \npeople,  commensurate  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  The  policy \nincludes enabling AP to at least regain their pre-acquisition standard of living and preferably to \nimprove upon it. The policy is based on the principle that all people who sacrifice some or all of \ntheir  property  and  standard  of  living  for  the  Government\u2019s  development  initiatives  should also \nbenefit from government interventions.  \n \n11. \nThe  project  compensation  policy  and  entitlement  matrix  were  designed  to  cover \ncompensation  for  lost  assets  and  restore  or  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  all  categories  (direct, \nindirect,  title  holders,  and  non-title  holders)  of  affected  people.  They  are  entitled  to  (i) \ncompensation  for  loss  of  land,  trees,  fishes, or  crops;  (ii)  compensation  for loss of structures \n(titled  and  informal)  and  other  immovable  properties;  (iii)  assistance  for  loss  of  income/wages \nand business; and (iv) restoration of income. Titled owners will be paid for lost land at market \nrates. Sharecroppers/tenants are also eligible for compensation for loss of access and/or crops. \nCompensation  for  loss  of  structures  (by  type)  will  be  paid  at  current  construction/replacement \ncosts. Affected people will be allowed to take salvageable materials at no cost. Income losses \nwill  be  compensated,  including  additional  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups.  For  non-titled \npersons (i.e., informal settlers/SBEs), the cut-off date for eligibility is the date of the census in \nthe  specific  road  section.  Compensation  will  be  paid  at  least  3  months  before construction \nstarts. \n \nAffected  peolple  will  not  only  receive  replacement  cash  for  land  and  other  assets  at \n12. \nmarket  prices,  but  also  shifting  or  moving  allowance,  house  reconstruction  grant,  income \nrestoration  allowance,  and  assistance  to  female-headed  households.  In  sum,  the  land \nacquisition  and  compensation  policy  is  meant  to  ensure  that  affected  people  are  not \ndisadvantaged  and  can  soon  regain  their  lost  income  and  livelihood.  Table  A16.3  lists  all \ncategories  of  entitlements  and  summarizes  compensation  and  entitlement  policies  applicable \nunder the Project.  \n \nE. \n \n13. \nAt various stages of project planning, affected people have been informed and consulted \nabout  likely  project  impacts.  During  the  social  assessment,  the  consultant\u2019s  team  conducted \nseveral  consultative  meetings  and  focus  group  discussions  along  the  alignments.  Affected \npeople and other stakeholders such as local government staff, head of village councils, village \ncouncil members, local voluntary organizations, and women\u2019s groups attended the meeting. \n \nThe  resettlement plan  will  be  translated  into  the  local  language  and  made  available  to \n14. \nAPs and other stakeholders. The  RHD will conduct further public consultations on resettlement \n\nStakeholder Participation, Disclosure of the Resettlement Plan, and Grievances  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nland \n\nthrough \n\nthe  Government  acquires \n\nImplementation Framework and Budget \n\nplan  implementation.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  will  be  posted  on  the  ADB  website. \nConsultations will continue throughout project implementation.  \n \nF. \n \n15. \nThe  environment  and  resettlement  circle  (ERC)  in  RHD,  headed  by  an  executive \nengineer,  was  established  under  a  previous  ADB  loan  to  monitor  road  improvement  projects\u2019 \nenvironment,  and  R&R  activities.  RHD\u2019s  main  tasks  for  R&R  activities  involve  resettling  and \nrehabilitating  affected  persons,  or  otherwise  mitigating  any  negative  social  impacts  related  to \nland  acquisition.  While \nthe  deputy \nfor  RHD \ncommissioner of an affected district, RHD is directly responsible for R&R.  \n \nThe  ERC  will  coordinate  and  supervise  NGO  work  in  the  field  and  help  implement  the \n16. \nRP.  A  grievance  redress  committee  will  be  established  at  each  road  section  to  resolve  any \ndispute regarding compensation and other R&R benefits. The R&R officer for the road section \nwill  chair  the  committee,  which  will  have  as  members  representatives  from  the  district \nadministration, local government, and affected persons, including women\u2019s groups. Claims from \naffected persons will be reviewed and resolved within one month from the date of submission to \nthe committee. \n \nThe estimated resettlement budget is $7.5 million. Estimates include all costs related to \n17. \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  including  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance, \nrelocation, shifting costs, and NGO services for resettlement plan implementation.  \n \nG. \n \n18. \nInternally, the  ERC  will  internally  monitor  the  monthly  progress  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, with help from the land acquisition officer, Office of the Deputy Commissioner. The \nreport  will  contain  progress  made  in  resettlement  plan  implementation  in  each  quarter  (and \ncumulative to the period), with particular attention to compliance with the principles and matrix \nset  out  in  the  RP.  The  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  agency  will  be  commissioned  for \nannual,  midterm,  and  end-term  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  these  activities.  The  monitoring \nconsultants will be selected within three months of loan effectiveness.  \n \nH. \n \nConstruction  will  not  start  until  the  required  lands  have  been  fully  acquired  and \n19. \npopulations appropriately relocated. Resettlement will be coordinated with the civil works and be \ncompleted  satisfactorily  before  awarding  of  the  civil  works  contracts  for  the  pipeline. \nConstruction  is  expected  to  start  in  early  2005.  Therefore,  land  acquisition  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by mid-2004. \n \n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n    Appendix 16       57 \n  \n\nTable A16.3: Project Compensation Policy and Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nType of Loss \nAgricultural Land \nand Assets  \n\nUnit \nTitle holder \n\nEntitlement \nCompensation at \n\u201creplacement \ncost\u201d or \u201cactual \nmarket value\u201d \n\nNon-agricultural \nLand and Assets  \n\nTitleholders/\nowners \n(residential \nand \ncommercial),  \n\nCompensation at \n\u201creplacement \ncost\u201d \n\nNon-perennial \ncrops  \n\nFamily \n\nNotice to harvest \nstanding crops  \n\nPerennial Crops  \n\nFamily \n\nEncroachers  \n\nFamily \n\nSquatters/ \nInformal Settlers  \n\nFamily \n\nCompensation at \n\u201creplacement \nvalue\u201d \n\nWill receive no \ncompensation for \nland but the \nvulnerable will \nreceive \nassistance to \nreplace assets  \nWill receive no \ncompensation for \nland but will \nreceive \nassistance to \nreplace assets  \n\nIncome from \nLand through \nLabor/Wage \nEarnings  \nLoss of \ncommunity \nfacilities  \n \n\nIndividual \n\nLump sum  \n\nCommunity \n\nReconstruction of \nfacilities  \n\nDetails \n(cid:159) If the replacement cost is more than the compensation \nat \u201cmarket price\u201d as determined by the deputy \ncommissioner, then the difference is to be paid by the \nProject in the form of \u201cassistance\u201d. \n(cid:159) In case of severance of agriculture land, an additional \ngrant of 10% of the amount paid for land acquisition will \nbe given.  \n(cid:159) If the replacement cost is more than the compensation \nat \u201cmarket price\u201d as determined by the competent \nauthority in the policy framework, then the difference is to \nbe paid by the Project. \n(cid:159) Transitional assistance of Tk2,000 per month will be \ngiven in the form of grant to cover a maximum of 3 months \nrental accommodation. \n(cid:159) A lump-sum shifting allowance of Tk2,500 will be given. \n(cid:159) Absentee landlords will receive only the compensation at \n\u2018replacement cost.\u2019 \n(cid:159) Affected people will have the right to salvage material \nfrom the demolished structure, and to compensation for \nloss of residential/commercial land at replacement value. \n(cid:159) Affected people are entitled to notice of 4 months.  \n(cid:159) A grant will be given to cover the cost of the crop lost \ndue to forced relocation, equal to market value of crop lost \nplus cost or replacement of seeds for the next season \nharvest. \n\n(cid:159) Compensation for perennial crops and trees will be  \ncalculated as annual produce value for one season. \n(cid:159) In case of perennial trees, compensation value will be \nmultiplied 3\u20135 times, depending on the nature of the \nperennial crop.  \n(cid:159) Encroachers will be notified when they should remove \ntheir assets and harvest their crops. \n(cid:159) Encroachers are to be assisted on case-to-case basis \nby considering relevant facts on family income and \nexisting assets for vulnerable people. \n(cid:159) Vulnerable people will receive compensation for \nstructures at replacement cost.  \n(cid:159) Families will receive access to training, which includes \nincome-generating assistance. \n(cid:159) They will receive a lump-sum shifting allowance of \nTk2,500 for temporary structures, Tk4,000 for \nsemipermanent ones, and Tk6,000 for permanent ones. \n(cid:159) Families will be compensated for loss of structure at \nreplacement cost, \n(cid:159) This is valid for persons indirectly affected due to the \nemployer having being displaced.

An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared,  which  is \nthe basis for this appendix.1   \n\n \nAccording  to  Bangladesh\u2019s  Environmental  Preservation  Rules  1997,  the  construction \n2. \nand  reconstruction,  and/or  extension  of  feeder  and  local  road  fall  under  \u201corange-B\u201d category, \nwhile construction and reconstruction, and/or extension of regional and national roads fall under \n\u201cred.\u201d  Civil  works  for  project  roads  falling  under  the  red  category  can  proceed  only  after  the \nDepartment  of  Environment  (DOE)  issues  an  environmental  clearance.  An  IEE  is  required  for \n\u201corange-B\u201d  projects  and  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  required  for  \u201cred\u201d \nprojects. \n  \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  reconstruct  existing  roads  to  higher  standards  through  widening, \nalignment  adjustment,  and  other  improvements  (e.g.,  lane  markings, cross walks, signs, and \nsafety features); and (ii) supply the roads\u2019 missing links.

It is in Mymesingh, which is flat. The road crosses the \nNarasundhs  River;  along  the  road  there  are  some  ponds.  This  project  area  is \nsometimes  flooded  due  to  heavy  rainfall.  The  road  mainly  passes  through \nagricultural land, where fish production is high. The area is not rich in either flora \nand  fauna  and  has  no  wildlife.  Homestead trees are scattered on both sides of \nthe road for 15 km. About 2,350 trees are within 15 km from the road\u2019s centerline.  \nBhaluka-Kishoreganj  road.  It  is  also  in  Mymesingh.  The  road  crosses  some \nbranches  of  the  Brahmaputra  River  (e.g.,  Suthia  and  Shila),  and  some  small \ncanals.  The  area  is  periodically  flooded.  The  portion  between  Gaffargoan  to \nHossainpur is prone to riverbank erosion. Homestead trees are found along the \nroad. Production of fish (culture and capture) is high. About 5,770 trees are within \n15 m from the road\u2019s centerline. There is no sensitive ecological area.  \nIt  is  in  Rangpur,  which  is  flat.  The  soil  is \nParbatipur-Madyapara  road. \npredominantly  sandy  and  clay.  The  road  crosses  a  number  of  canals  and  there \nare some ponds along the road. The area does not experience floods. The 44 km \nroad crosses a forest (about 300 m at km 7 and 500 m at km 25). On both sides \nof  the  road  are  homestead  forests  and  agricultural  field.  About  7,060  trees  are \nwithin 15 m from the road\u2019s centerline.  \nBoda-Nilphamari  road.  This  road  is  in  Rangpur.  The  soil  is  predominantly  non-\ncalcareous,  dark  gray,  and  brown.  The  area  is  not  prone  to  floods.  The  road \ncrosses agriculture lands, and many homesteads line the roadside. About 5,990 \ntrees are within 15 m from the road\u2019s centerline.  \nPanchaghar-Banlabandh road.  It is in Rangpur, at the foothills of the Himalayas. \nThe  soil  is  predominantly  fertile.  Some  areas  have  abundant  sand  and  stone. \nThe  road  crosses  some  rivers  (Chawai,  Varsha,  Ranachadi,  Karatoa,  and \nTeernai).  Numerous  homesteads,  orange  orchards,  and  tea  plantations  are  on \nboth sides of the road.  \nChittagong-Dohazari road, including Kaliakoir bypass. The road is in Chittagong, \nand  the  bypass  in  Dhaka.  This  area  is  flat  and  classified  as  lowland.  River \nerosion and flooding are significant. The road passes through agricultural fields, \nand homesteads are found the roadside.  \n\nScreening Potential Environmental Impacts, and Mitigation Measures \n\n \nD. \n \n5. \nThe Project will have no significant environmental impact as only existing roads will be \naffected,  and  they  are  not  in  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  However,  the  Bhaluka-\nGaffargaon-Kishoreganj  road  is  prone  to  riverbank  erosion,  as  are  some  areas  along  the \nPanchaghar-Tetulia-Banlabandh road. These areas need adequate protection work. \n\n \nThe  environmental  impacts  of  construction  are  temporary,  manageable,  and  will  occur \n6. \nonly  during  construction:  (i)  disruption  of  traffic  in  the  construction  area,  (ii)  increased  air \npollution due to increasing dust and other volatile chemical substances from the asphalt plant, \n(iii) noise and vibration, and (iv) disruption of the water system due to cut and filling and other \nearth  work.  Mitigation  measures  to  minimize  these  impacts  include  (i)  rerouting  traffic;  (ii) \nmaintaining  optimum  moisture  content  during  soil  handling,  spraying  water  to  minimize  dust, \nand  maintaining  a  safe  distance  between  the  asphalt  plant  and  public  facilities,  including \neducation facilities; (iii) strictly controlling construction works that create noise and vibration by \nprohibiting  night  work  in  residential  areas;  (iv)  pumping  of  stagnant  water,  and  providing \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nadequate drainage; and (v) stabilizing road embankment side slopes, restricting construction in \nflood  areas  to  the  dry  season,  and  avoiding  road  widening  where  there  are  ponds.  These \nmeasures will be included in the contractor\u2019s contract.  \n \n7. \nThe  Project\u2019s  environmental  impact  is  mainly  on  traffic  safety,  and  will  be  mitigated  by \nproviding  adequate  traffic  signs  and  physical  barriers  to  reduce  motorists\u2019  speed.  Borrow  pits \nhave an important environmental impact, and they will not be placed in fertile agriculture lands \nor  areas  prone  to  erosion  and  landslides.  Former  borrow  pit  areas  will  be  restored  and \nrehabilitated.  \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nE. \n \n8. \nInstitutional Framework and Responsibility.  Implementation  of mitigation measures \nduring construction will be the responsibility of the contractor. An environmental engineer, who \nwill  be  hired  as  part  of  the  consultant  team  to  implement  the  Project,  will  help  the  social  and \nenvironmental circle (SEC) of the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) prepare contractual \ndocumentation so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other contractual obligations \nof  the  contractor  clearly  identify  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for \nnoncompliance.  RHD  and  SEC  will \nimplement  overall  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement. \n \n9. \nEnvironmental Monitoring and Management Plan. The IEE has identified the generic \nmonitoring and management program, which will be part of mitigating adverse impacts. Detailed \nmonitoring and management for each road will be prepared during the detail engineering work. \n  \nF. \n \n10. \nThe  IEE  shows  that  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  are  manageable  and  can  be \nmitigated. None of environmentally sensitive areas will be disrupted by the Project. Therefore, a \nfull EIA to assess further impacts for roads involved in this Project is not required.  \n \n11. \nThree  project  roads  are  national  roads  and  one  is  a  regional  road.  In  accordance with \nthe  Environmental  Preservation  Rules  1997,  construction,  reconstruction,  and/or  extension  of \nthese roads fall under the \u201cred\u201d category. Such civil works can be done only after DOE issues \nan environmental clearance. The application for such an environmental clearance needs to be \ncompleted  with  a  full  EIA.  Since  the  areas  affected  by  these  roads  are  not  environmentally \nsensitive, therefore, the EIA should be done at the same time as the detail engineering study. \nBased on the full EIA, the detailed environmental management and monitoring plan and a more \nspecific management plan to mitigate the adverse impacts can be prepared.  \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nG. \n\nConclusion \n\n12. \nThe Project will improve existing roads. The overall IEE finding is that the Project will not \ncause  significant  environmental  problems,  and  potential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable. \nHowever, the Project should be continuously monitored. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2003) \n", "Currency Unit  \nTk1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "taka (Tk) \n$0.017 \nTk58.41 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \nADB \nADF \n \nARMP   \nBOT \n \nBRTA   \n \nCNG \n \nDFID \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "\u2013 \nDMC \n\u2013 \nDOE \n\u2013 \nEIA \n\u2013 \nEIRR \n\u2013 \nERC \n\u2013 \nFGD \n\u2013 \nGDP \n\u2013 \nHDM \n\u2013 \nIDA \n\u2013 \nIDC3 \n\u2013 \nIEE \n\u2013 \nIIFC \n\u2013 \nJBIC \n\u2013 \nJICA \n\u2013 \nLPA \n\u2013 \nMOC \n\u2013 \nMOWCA \n\u2013 \nNGO \n \n\u2013 \nNLTP   \n\u2013 \nNMT \n \n\u2013 \nNRSC   \nO-D \n\u2013 \n \nOPEC Fund  \u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "PSA \nPRC \n \nRDSC   \n \nRHD \nR&R \n \nSASEC \n \nSBE \nSEC \nTA \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nannual road maintenance plan \nbuild-operate-transfer \nBangladesh Road Transport Authority \ncompressed natural gas \nDepartment for International Development (United  \nKingdom) \ndeveloping member country \nDepartment of Environment \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental resettlement circle \nfocus group discussion \ngross domestic product \nhighway design and maintenance standards model \nInternational Development Association \nInstitutional Development Component 3 \ninitial environmental examination \nInfrastructure Investment Facilitation Center  \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nLand Port Authority \nMinistry of Communications \nMinistry of Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Affairs \nnongovernment organization \nnational land transport policy  \nnonmotorized traffic \nNational Road Safety Council \norigin destination \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for \nInternational Development \npoverty and social analysis \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nroad design and safety circle \nRoads and Highways Department \nresettlement and rehabilitation \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nsmall business enterprise \nSocial and Environmental Circle \ntechnical assistance \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "transport sector coordination \nvehicle operating cost \n", "NOTES \n", "TSC \nVOC \n \n", " \n", " \n(i) \n", " \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 \nJune.
