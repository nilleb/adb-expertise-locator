THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the additional financing of the \nPhuentsholing Township Development Project. \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will cover cost overruns of the ongoing Phuentsholing \nTownship Development Project.1 The ongoing project will construct river walls and raise ground \nlevels to protect Phuentsholing city and a new township from floods and riverbank erosion. It will \nalso develop common infrastructure on about 66 hectares (ha) of new urban land to enable the \nsafe and sustainable expansion of human settlements and commercial activities. The project will \nalso support capacity development to improve flood risk management and the delivery of urban \nservices. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bhutan\u2019s development strategy has a focus on the potential of growth centers in the south \nnear the Indian border to boost export-oriented industrial development. Bhutan\u2019s Eleventh Five-\nYear Plan, 2014\u20132018 identified Phuentsholing as a regional growth center that could be safely \nexpanded through the construction of flood protection works and planned urbanization.2 Located \non two major trade corridors developed under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nframework, Phuentsholing handles more than 80% of Bhutan\u2019s trade and is the country\u2019s largest \ncommercial and industrial hub and main trading gateway with India. Phuentsholing is also \nBhutan\u2019s second most populous city, with 25,000 residents, and is anticipated to grow by 5% per \nyear subject to land availability.3 \n \n4.  Land scarcity is a key growth constraint for Phuentsholing, which is physically confined by \nsteep and unstable Himalayan foothills, the Amochhu River, and an international border. The city \nis vulnerable to precipitation- and earthquake-triggered landslides and has been significantly \nimpacted by flood damage and riverbank erosion. The impacts of flash floods triggered by \nmonsoon rains are being experienced more frequently because of urban expansion into unsafe \nareas, increasingly dense urban development, the loss of natural ground cover, and climate \nchange.4 Since 2002, the Government of Bhutan has worked to mitigate Phuentsholing\u2019s land \nconstraints and exposure to geophysical and flood hazards. It has constructed flood and erosion \ndefenses along the Amochhu and Omchhu rivers and planned for city expansion away from the \nmountain slopes to flat areas suitable for residential, commercial, and recreational uses.5 \n \n5.  The  Phuentsholing  Township  Development  Project  supports  the  government  with \nachieving these mitigation efforts by strengthening flood defenses and constructing safe, new \nurban areas. The ongoing project was approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2018.

Under  the  project,  about  66  hectares  of  vacant  riparian  land \nimmediately adjacent to the existing city along the left bank of the Amochhu River are being \ndeveloped, based on the Amochhu Development Master Plan.6 The executing agency is Druk \nHolding and Investments Limited (DHI), which is a state-owned entity, and the implementing \nagency is the Construction Development Corporation Limited (CDCL), a fully owned subsidiary of \nDHI. The closing date for the loan and grant under the ongoing project is 31 December 2025. \n6.  Specifically,  activities  under  the  ongoing  project  are  (i)  constructing  river  walls  and \ncommon urban infrastructure in a new greenfield area, (ii) raising land, (iii) installing a flood early \nwarning system, (iv) implementing a flood management plan, and (v) helping the government \nprepare subsequent phases of development. To implement and administer the new urban area, \nthe government is applying a new integrated project modality by entrusting DHI and CDCL to \nimplement and sustainably operate and maintain the river defenses, building plots, and common \nurban infrastructure. The ongoing project will also build the capacity of both the new township \noffice and Phuentsholing municipality to ensure that coordination and high service standards are \nachieved, while ensuring the disaster resilience of the facilities with proper monitoring and \nmaintenance. \n7.  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The project remains highly relevant in a \npost covid-19 strategic context. Efforts are being made to restart the economy and mitigate the \nadverse impact of the lockdown, particularly on employment of the vulnerable population. The \nadditional  financing  will  provide  needed  support  for  the  long-term  growth  prospects  of  the \neconomy. The construction of the river walls and new township is generating local employment, \nthe new commercial area will stimulate the local economy and create service sector jobs, and the \nnew town will be equipped with new hospitals and clinics that offer health services and medical \nsupplies. \n8.  Ongoing project performance. The ongoing project is performing well. It was rated on \ntrack since project effectiveness and, as of 20 August 2020, had achieved 96% of projected \ncumulative contract awards ($37.6 million) and exceeded cumulative disbursement targets ($22.8 \nmillion, 135% of projections). The ongoing project is also on track to achieve the project outputs. \nIn terms of physical achievements, output 1 activities (flood and erosion protection measures) are \nunder way, and the construction of the wall and backfilling are due to be completed in July 2021. \nOutput 2 activities (municipal infrastructure)  will start in April 2021, supported by output 3 \n(installation of township management systems), which will be initiated in the first quarter of 2022. \nThe  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements  of  the  ongoing  project  is  proceeding \nsatisfactorily. All risks detailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan are being \nmanaged successfully. \n \n9.  Reason for additional financing. The additional financing will finance cost overruns on \nthe ongoing project. Since the project appraisal, the cost increase is attributed to two civil works \npackages: the river protection works, and the urban common infrastructure. The river protection \nworks contract was awarded in July 2018 and was 37% higher than the engineer\u2019s estimate.7 The \nhigher bid price was the results of the delayed approval of the ongoing project and the lowest \n \n6  Government of Bhutan, Druk Holding and Investments Limited. 2017. Amochhu Development Master Plan. Thimphu. \nThe master plan is aligned with the Phuentsholing Structure Plan 2013\u20132028. \n7  The contract was awarded on 18 July 2018 to the second lowest responsive bid, which was 37% higher than the \nengineer\u2019s estimate ($45.09 million compared with the engineer\u2019s estimate of $32.80 million). \n ", "3 \nbidder withdrawing after its specialist equipment for wall construction was no longer available.8 \nThe contract\u2019s price adjustments (labor, steel, cement, fuel, and lubricant) have also been higher \nthan expected at project appraisal, increasing the contract price by 12% compared with the \nstandard 5% price contingency provided. The updated contract amount also allows for upgrading \na short section of the Omchhu River\u2019s banks (360 meters) which is contiguous with the ongoing \nworks (4 kilometers).9 Overall, the river protection works contract increased from $33 million to \n$48 million (145%). The common urban infrastructure package has also increased since project \nappraisal, when only its feasibility level design and cost estimate were available. The detailed \ndesigns and engineer\u2019s estimate are now completed, and the package\u2019s cost has increased from \n$11.9 million to $20.8 million. The asset management system costs also increased with the \nfinalized cost estimate and incorporating the maintenance equipment costs of $2.1 million. \nAdditional financing includes 10% contingencies as the river protection works package is still \nunder construction and the common urban infrastructure package has yet to be awarded. The \nactivities under the additional financing are expected to be completed by 31 December 2025, \nwhich is the closing date of the loan and grant under the ongoing project. \n \n10.  Eligibility criteria for additional financing. The additional financing project meets the \neligibility criteria for additional financing. The overall project (i) remains technically feasible and \neconomically viable; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; (iii) is consistent with the \nproject\u2019s development objectives; (iv) is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nBhutan, 2019\u20132023;10 and (v) is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities of (a) \nmaking cities more livable; (b) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability; and (c) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity.11 The additional financing is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for \nBhutan, 2020\u20132022.12 \n \n11.  Suitability of using additional financing. Additional financing is the most appropriate \nway to fund the cost overruns to complete the project in the most efficient way while providing the \ntownship with the requisite physical and institutional resilience against the impact of the natural \ndisasters. The project will be completed within the ongoing project completion date. Through this \napproach,  current  effective  implementation  arrangements\u2014such  as  the  project  steering \ncommittee, executing and implementing agencies, project implementation unit, and civil works \ncontractor and supervisor\u2014will be maintained to ensure a high degree of readiness for the \nimplementation of the additional financing. \n \n   \n \n8  The circulation of the report and recommendation of the President to the Board awaited the consultations by the \ngovernment with a neighboring country. Meanwhile, the executing agency chose to delay contract award until ADB \nconfirmed the Board consideration date. \n9  The Omchhu River is a tributary of the Amochhu River that flows through Phuentsholing. The additional financing \nwill extend the Omchhu River protection wall constructed under the ongoing project and within the existing project \nboundaries. \n10 ADB. 2019.

The project is \naligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  balanced  and  sustainable  development  of  human \nsettlements  ensured  (footnote  2)  and  (ii)  smart  growth  principles  applied  in  planning  and \ndevelopment13. The project will have the following outcome: Phuentsholing\u2019s urban area protected \nfrom floods and expanded with improved amenities and services. 14 \n \n13.  The outputs of the overall project will remain unchanged. These are (i) flood and erosion \nprotection  measures  installed,  (ii)  municipal  infrastructure  constructed,  and  (iii)  township \nmanagement systems installed. The additional financing will finance cost overruns experienced \nacross all three project outputs. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n14.  During  preparation  of the  ongoing  project,  ADB  helped the  government  incorporate \nintegrated urban planning principles that address the social, economic, environmental, and \nphysical aspects of the new township into the township master plan. During implementation, ADB \nhas continued to support DHI and CDCL with improving the detailed designs of the common urban \ninfrastructure. ADB has also supported DHI and CDCL with (i) streamlining coordination between \nthe new township and Phuentsholing municipality to enhance service delivery, connectivity, and \nlinks with the existing city and ongoing and future multisector ADB projects; (ii) developing a \nsustainable  and  effective  model  for  township  management;  (iii)  ensuring  sustainability  by \nembedding the project within longer-term strategic plans for the wider economic area; and \n(iv) ensuring that strong marketing machinery is in place to attract investors. ADB\u2019s support has \nresulted in development of a strategic action plan (SAP) for sustainable township management. \nThe plan was updated and elaborated during preparation of the additional financing, based on \nprogress achieved and outstanding tasks associated with developing a legal, institutional, and \nadministrative  framework  for  the  new  township.  The  project  will  improve  the  capacity  and \ncompetitiveness of the Phuentsholing urban area and complement the efforts of the ADB-\nsupported South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program, which has enabled greater \nconnectivity and facilitated trade between Bhutan and other countries in the region.  \n \nD.

Project readiness in the context of COVID-19. Readiness is high as additional financing \nis for the ongoing project where the first civil works package is already under construction and the \nsecond major civil works has been tendered. The implementation consultants, recruited in 2016, \nwill continue to support the overall project. The COVID-19 pandemic has not affected the project\u2019s \nimplementation  arrangements  or  overall  cost. A  nationwide  lockdown  was  imposed  by  the \ngovernment on 11 August 2020 and project construction works were stopped for 38 days. The \nadditional financing implementation period of 5 years provides adequate cushion for the lockdown \ndelay and the project is programmed to be completed within the existing implementation period. \nBased on government orders, health and safety guidelines and standard operating procedures \non construction sites have been developed and are being strictly implemented, with compliance \nmonitoring being ensured by the project manager. \nIII.

The \nstrengthening of existing river walls along the Omchhu River (footnote 9) maintains the same \ndesign as the river protection works being constructed under the ongoing project, the design of \nwhich included a thorough evaluation of hydrological, hydraulic, and sediment transport conditions \nto assess probable flood levels; the projected impact of climate change; sedimentation; and scour. \nThe section of the Omchhu River in which the works will take place is an engineered channel and \nthe works will not extend beyond the width of the existing river channel. Urban infrastructure \ndesign incorporates smart technology to monitor water supply and wastewater operations to \nensure maximum efficiency in the management of assets. Since the same climate baseline and \n ", "8 \nprojections are still applicable and the expected impacts are the same as for the ongoing project, \nthe  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  prepared  during  project  appraisal  remains \napplicable. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n23.  Economic  analysis.  Increased  land  value  accounts  for  about  75%  of  total  project \nbenefits, with reduced flood damage to infrastructure and increased benefits from water and \npower supply accounting for the remaining 25%. Given several uncertainties related to the project, \na risk modeling framework was used to estimate the value of the project benefits. With the \nadditional financing included, the project\u2019s mean economic internal rate of return (EIRR) has \nreduced from 11.28% at project appraisal to 9.87%. The economic analysis indicates that the \noverall project is economically viable. The project\u2019s economic feasibility is sensitive to unfavorable \nchanges in investment costs and economic benefits. However, within the expected range of \nvariations of these key variables, the EIRR remains above the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 9% unless investment costs increase by 10.20% or benefits decrease by 8.54%. The \nproject\u2019s EIRR is less sensitive to changes in operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The \npoverty impact ratio was estimated at 4.1%. It is assumed that occupants of residential housing\u2014\nincluding social housing reserved for the poor\u2014will value the new land they occupy at higher \nlease rates than would be payable to the government, primarily because the quality of urban \ninfrastructure and services will be much better than can be found elsewhere in Bhutan. \n \n24.  Financial analysis. The overall project\u2019s financial sustainability assessment was updated \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. The project\u2019s cash inflows mainly comprise revenues \ngenerated from leasing the developed land, which the government will promote to investors with \nfinancial  and  regulatory  incentives.  Revenues  will  also  include  water  supply,  wastewater \ntreatment, and solid-waste management service charges. The financial analysis found the project, \nincluding the additional financing, to be financially viable. The net present value is positive and \nthe internal rate of return of 2.64% is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 1.39%. \nThe financial internal rate of return is sensitive to adverse changes in variables such as increase \nin construction cost, increase in O&M costs, and decrease in lease revenues. However, the \nproject remains financially viable under most adverse scenarios, except for a decrease of lease \nrates of more than 23%. The project supports the establishment of the new township\u2019s institutional \narrangements and implementation of the SAP, which includes a time-bound plan for the O&M.17 \nFurther, the urban works package includes 5 years of O&M, which will further mitigate the financial \nsustainability risk. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n25.  This project will develop a modern township designed on sustainable principles of equity, \nlivability, and competitiveness. The project is expected to provide opportunities for investment, \ncreate jobs, and relieve existing housing pressures. Integrated planning and infrastructure, \nstrengthening DHI institutionally, and creating a township management unit will ensure the \nsustainability  of  investments  in  a  climate-  and  disaster-resilient  township.  The  project\u2019s \ncommercial approach, support for investor outreach, and strong focus on O&M will ensure the \nnew township\u2019s financial and operational sustainability (para. 24). Moreover, expanding the \nmunicipality\u2019s tax base will help it finance its own investments and operations. \n \n17 The PAM includes the draft SAP, which is to be approved by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlements. To \nmitigate the risk of delays in SAP approval, the SAP has been included in the loan agreement and will be monitored \nthrough quarterly progress reports. \n ", "9 \nD.  Governance \n \n26.  Financial  management.  An  updated  financial  management  assessment  has  been \nconducted for the CDCL, in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines.18 The financial management \nassessment found that the CDCL has adequate financial management capacity to (i) record the \nrequired financial transactions, (ii) provide reliable annual financial statements and audit reports, \nand (iii) safeguard the financial assets. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nmoderate because of the following: (i) complex financing structure with five sources of financing; \n(ii) there is scope for improving the quality of financial reporting under the ongoing project; and \n(iii) in the past, there has been delay in submitting the audited project financial statements to ADB. \nThe main risk mitigation actions are (i) providing training in ADB\u2019s financial management and \ndisbursement procedures and systems; (ii) strengthening the frequency, timeliness, and quality \nof financial reporting; and (iii) adopting measures to ensure that the audited project financial \nstatements are submitted to ADB on time. As per established practice, the project financial \nstatements will be audited annually by an auditor acceptable to ADB, following auditing standards \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n27.  Procurement. All procurement and recruitment of consultants to be financed by the ADB \nloan and grant will be carried out in accordance with the ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). The additional strengthening of the Omchhu River\u2019s banks will be included in the \nongoing civil works contractor\u2019s scope as a contract amendment. The municipal infrastructure is \npart  of  the  procurement  plan  of  the  ongoing  project.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  the \nlandscaping component will be procured separately from the municipal infrastructure package \nbecause of their small value. \n \n28.  The procurement capacity assessment conducted for the ongoing project concluded that \nthe project\u2019s overall procurement risk is moderate.19 Procurement specialists supporting the \nongoing project will continue to help the CDCL prepare and evaluate bids. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, DHI, and the CDCL. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  Poverty.  The  erosion  and  annual  flooding  experienced  by  the  existing  municipality \ndisproportionately affects the poor, who lack the resources to cope and recover quickly. By \naddressing this problem, the project is expected to boost the economy, create more and better \nemployment opportunities in the longer term, and help alleviate poverty. Moreover, adding \nhousing stock to the new township will relieve pressure in the existing municipality by making \nhousing more affordable. Therefore, the project will directly benefit vulnerable local inhabitants in \nseveral ways. The second project output includes the development of recreation areas and \npedestrian  safety  features  such  as  streetlights,  public  toilets,  road  markings,  ramps,  and \nfootpaths. The ongoing project summary poverty reduction and social strategy has been updated \nfor the additional financing.20 \n \n18 ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.

The project is categorized as having some gender elements as it will promote \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  project  consultations  and  reduce  women\u2019s  time  poverty  through \nimproved urban infrastructure services, including water and sanitation. Women and women\u2019s \norganizations, differently abled people, the elderly, and children will be encouraged to participate \nin  public  planning  meetings  associated  with  the  project,  especially  those  related  to  the \ndevelopment of municipal infrastructure and the flood early warning system. The civil works \ncontracts include labor provisions to ensure that women and men receive equal pay for equal \nwork, and that hygiene, HIV prevention, and COVID-19 awareness campaigns are conducted for \nlaborers and local communities. The additional financing will continue to aim for at least 30% \nfemale participation in the community consultations and awareness campaigns, when possible. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n32.  The  social  and  environmental  safeguard  requirements  for  the  ongoing  project  are \nunchanged. The additional financing will cover the shortfall in the loan and grant amount resulting \nfrom cost increases to complete the components in the ongoing project. The environmental and \nsocial safeguards plan implementation, monitoring, and reporting and the grievance redress \nmechanism established for the ongoing project will remain unchanged and will also be applicable \nto the additional financing. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category C) and indigenous peoples (category C). The \nongoing project will remain category C for involuntary resettlement and for indigenous peoples. \nThe additional financing is also classified C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nin compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).21 There are no indigenous peoples \nliving in the project site and no land acquisition is envisaged for the additional financing. Social \nsafeguard measures will be achieved in line with the provisions stated in the PAM and no land \nacquisition and resettlement plan or indigenous peoples plan will be required. \n \n34.  Environment. The ongoing project will remain category A for environment. The additional \nfinancing will be category C for environment as it will have no significant adverse environmental \nimpacts.  The  existing  environmental  management  plan  will  be  updated  to  include  the \nstrengthening of an additional 360 meters of the Omchhu River protection wall. Since the majority \nof additional financing funds will be used for covering cost overruns and the scope of the river \nwall extension works are minor, no significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated. \nTherefore, no changes to the ongoing project environmental impact assessment will be required. \n \n35.  To date, the CDCL is satisfactorily implementing all safeguards requirements, and any \nsafeguard implementation issues arising during implementation are being addressed effectively. \nThe CDCL submits environmental safeguard monitoring reports to ADB, and these are reviewed \nand disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project\u2019s safeguard \nand environmental specialists will continue (i) building the capacity of the CDCL and relevant \nstakeholders  in  environmental  monitoring,  (ii)  ensuring  that  the  project  is  implemented  in \naccordance with social and environmental safeguard requirements, and (iii) monitoring safeguard \ncompliance. An independent environmental monitoring expert is already engaged by the CDCL \nunder the ongoing project. The expert  will continue to monitor project implementation and \ndocument implementation of the environmental management plan and compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and the government\u2019s environmental clearance. \n \n \n21 ADB.
