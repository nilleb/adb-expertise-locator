(BSEE),  comprising  (i)  a \nproposed  A-loan  of  up  to  $100  million  equivalent  in  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii) a  proposed \ncomplementary  loan1 of  up  to  $200  million  equivalent  in  dollars  and  yuan  for  the  Rural  Smart \nWastewater Treatment Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n2. \nPollution  exacerbates  water  scarcity  in  the  PRC.  The  enormous  volume  of  wastewater \ngenerated  by  rural  areas\u2014home  to  a  half  of  the  country\u2019s  population\u2014poses  a  major \nenvironmental threat to the country\u2019s rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers. The responsibility \nfor  wastewater  management  falls  on  local  governments  outside  of  major  city  areas.  However, \nwastewater  treatment  facilities  and  sewage  pipelines  are  scarce.  Among  the  limited  pipeline \nnetworks,  most  have  a  combined  sewer  system,  where  storm  water  and  wastewater  are \ncollected in a single pipe system, allowing untreated wastewater to escape into the environment \nwith  the  storm  water.  In  rural  areas,  less  than  20%  of  wastewater  was  treated;  the  rest  was \ndischarged  untreated  into  rivers  and  the  lakes. 3 Furthermore,  only  10%  of  rural  wastewater \ntreatment  projects  were  properly  maintained.4 With  most  untreated  wastewater  flowing  directly \ninto  the  local  surface  water,  the  quality  of  local  water  sources  has  greatly  deteriorated,  often \nexceeding  water  quality  limits  specific  to  the  source\u2019s  water  body.5 In  2012,  31%  of  10  major \nriver  systems  and  39%  of  62  primary  lakes  could  not  meet  the  water  quality  requirement  for \ndrinking water. The quality of as much as 57% of total national groundwater is classified \u201cbad\u201d or \n\u201cvery  bad.\u201d 6  This  pollution  in  upstream  areas  can  have  a  great  sanitation  impact  on  local \npopulations  who  depend  on  these  local  water  sources  for  their  water  supply;  this  problem  is \nexacerbated in rural areas where drinking water treatment is inadequate or nonexistent. \n \n3. \nAlong  the  spectrum  of  wastewater  treatment  systems,  the  decentralized  wetland \napproach  relying  on  natural  purification  has  been  most  widely  implemented.  It  is  mechanically \nsimple, yet biologically complex. However, this treatment method often cannot meet the central \ngovernment\u2019s  higher  discharge  standards.7 As  constructed  wetlands  are  open-air,  the  facilities \nare  vulnerable  to  adverse  weather,  secondary  contamination,  and  local  sanitation  problems. \nThe long-term efficiency and stability of purifying ever-increasing wastewater is uncertain. \n\n                                                 \n1  Complementary loan is an ADB syndicated loan funded by commercial banks, where ADB is the lender of record.  \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2012.

Beijing. \n\n\f2 \n\nTo  address  this  challenge,  the  central  government  set  a  target  to  increase  the \n4. \nwastewater  treatment  rate  in  townships  to  30%  by  2015. 8  Furthermore,  the  government \nreemphasized  the  importance  of  integrated  urban  and  rural  development  through  the  Central \nCommittee Resolution: Concerning Some Major Issues in Comprehensively Deepening Reform. \nThis shift is expected to yield high environmental benefits but will require significant investment \nin  wastewater  plants  and  sewage  networks.  As  for  technology  selection,  conventional  large-\nscale wastewater treatment systems in urban areas typically employ oxidation ditch, sequencing \nbatch  reactor,  and  anaerobic\u2013anoxic\u2013oxic,  with  a  fast-growing  trend  for  membrane  biological \nreactors.  Those  approaches  require  high  up-front  capital  expenditure  and  a  number  of  highly \nskilled  operations  staff  on  site  to  constantly  adjust  oxygen,  chemical,  and  retention  time.  The \nlocal  utilities  owned  by  local  governments  have  limited  financing,  technology,  and  operating \nknow-how  for  rural  wastewater  treatment.  A  cost-effective  and  flexible  technical  solution  that \ncan adapt to the characteristics of rural areas is urgently needed. \n \n5. \nWater  management,  including  drinking  water  and  wastewater  treatment,  has  been  a \nfocus area for Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations in the PRC since 1992. ADB\u2019s long-\nterm support for broad-based policy and regulatory reforms has played a critical role in enabling \nprivate  sector  participation  (e.g.,  lifting  tariffs  to  reach  cost  recovery,  strengthening  technical \nstandards).  ADB  has  been  taking  a  lead  in  supporting  private  sector  participation  in  the  water \nsector  since  the  government  requested  ADB  support  for  the  first  water  sector  public\u2013private \npartnership  (PPP)  project  and  the  national  water  tariff  guidelines  encouraging  cost  recovery.9 \nRecently ADB has helped various provincial and city governments in the Songhua River Basin \nto develop pollution control strategies via the use of technical assistance projects to develop a \nlong-term road map for PPP, and to fund projects using sovereign and nonsovereign modalities \nto achieve higher environmental performance.10 \n \n6. \nThrough continuous project screening and discussion with stakeholders, ADB identified \nSound  Global  Ltd.,  an  integrated  water  services  provider,  as  having  an  innovative  business \nmodel  and  proprietary  technology  to  address  rural  wastewater  management.  The  proposed \nproject is timely and builds on the achievements of earlier projects that addressed wastewater \ntreatment  and  reuse  in  cities.11 The  project  represents  the  first  opportunity  for  ADB  to  provide \ndirect assistance focusing on rural wastewater management. \n \n\n                                                 \n8  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2012.

ADB\u2019s loans will be channeled to subprojects through \nSound Global Ltd. and BSEE, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sound Global Ltd. \n \n8. \nEach subproject will have a mother plant that controls multiple daughter plants, which do \nnot  require  control  rooms  for  operations.  The  concession  agreement  between  the  project \ncompany and a county or municipal government will cover both types of plants, which is in line \nwith  the  PRC\u2019s  urban\u2013rural  integration  policies,  under  which  a  municipality\u2019s  regulatory \njurisdiction covers both the county center and surrounding villages and communities.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n \nThe Sponsor and the Borrowers \n\n3. \n\nThe project sponsor and borrower, Sound Global Ltd., is a private company established \n9. \nin  1993  in  Beijing  and  listed  on  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange.  The  major  shareholders \ninclude  Yibo  Wen,  the  founder  and  chairman  (50.2%),12 Schroders  PLC  (7.4%),  International \nFinance Corporation (7.3%), and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

BSEE,  the  second  borrower,  is \nincorporated  in  the  PRC  as  an  onshore  platform  fully  owned  by  Sound  Global  Ltd.  to  develop \nwastewater treatment-related business and hold wastewater treatment project companies.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n10. \nSound  Global  Ltd.\u2019s  core  value  is  integrated  water  environment  management.  The \nbusiness  lines  cover  engineering,  procurement,  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of \nwater  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities;  and  the  manufacturing  of  water  and  wastewater \ntreatment  equipment.  In  2013,  Sound  Global  Ltd.  operated  a  portfolio  of  25  municipal \nwastewater  treatment  projects  with  a  combined  treatment  capacity  of  1.2  million  tons/day  and \ntwo rural wastewater treatment projects with a combined treatment capacity of 42,400 tons/day \nunder build\u2013operate\u2013transfer (BOT) arrangements. It also provided operation and maintenance \nservices to 19 projects with an aggregate treatment capacity of 310,000 tons/day. \n \nSound  Global  Ltd.  differentiates  itself  from  its  peers  by  adding  a  focus  on  rural \n11. \nwastewater  treatment.  Since  2005,  Sound  Global  Ltd.  has  been  developing  an  innovative \n\n                                                 \n12 Yibo  Wen  owns  his  shares  through  Sound  Water  (BVI)  Limited,  incorporated  in  the  British  Virgin  Islands,  a \ncompany  jointly  owned  by  Yibo  Wen  and  his  wife.  The  Global  Forum  for  Transparency  and  Exchange  of \nInformation for Tax Purposes recently rated British Virgin Islands as a \u201cnoncompliant\u201d jurisdiction. The project team \nhas  referred  this  significant  integrity  issue  to  ADB  PSOD  Operations  Coordination  Division  (PSOC),  Office  of \nAnticorruption and Integrity, and Office of the General Counsel and conducted detailed due diligence to satisfy ADB \nthat there are valid business and commercial reasons for the use of such an intermediate jurisdiction. \n\n13 Schroders PLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. hold shares of Sound Global Ltd. as nominee shareholders on behalf \n\nof individual investors. \n\n\f4 \n\nbusiness  model  and technology for  rural  wastewater  management  based  on  international  best \npractice. Building on the rotating biological contactor (RBC) technology mainly used in Europe \nand the United States for industrial wastewater treatment, Sound Global Ltd. developed SMART \ntechnology. The RBC is being used for an integrated rural wastewater treatment process for the \nfirst  time  worldwide.  The  PRC  National  Intellectual  Property  Bureau  awarded  SMART  six \npatents for its various components. The SMART solution is a small-scale wastewater treatment \nsystem  with  several  distinguishing  features  suited  for  rural  wastewater  treatment:  (i)  an \nautomated  system  requiring  a  minimum  of  on-site  operations  staff;  (ii)  a  centralized  control \nsystem  integrating  multiple  small  plants  and  improving  operating  efficiency  and  monitoring \neffectiveness;  and  (iii)  small-scale  standardized  modular  equipment  (capacity  of  300\u2013500 \ntons/day for each module); additional units can be installed to cope with increased wastewater \nresulting from future expansion. \n \n12. \nEach SMART module comprises a multipurpose pretreatment tank for primary treatment, \na high-efficiency RBC for secondary treatment, and a double filtration tank for tertiary treatment. \nAfter  the  pretreatment  process  with  the  multipurpose  treatment  tank,  the  wastewater  will  be \nlifted  to  the  high-efficiency  RBC  for  the  removal  of  organic  pollutants,  ammonia  nitrogen,  total \nnitrogen,  and  total  phosphorus.  A  series  of  closely  packed  discs  are  mounted  on  a  rotating \nshaft,  supported  just  above  the  surface  of  the  wastewater  (i.e.,  around  40%\u201345%  of  the  disc \nmedia are constantly being submerged in the wastewater and the rest are exposed to the air). \nThe  rotational  motion  provides  a  chain  of  reactions  that  involve  oxidation,  adsorption,  and \ndecomposition  of  organic  pollutants  presented  in  the  incoming  wastewater.  Then  the  double \nfiltration  tank  removes  the  remaining  suspended  solids,  lowering  the  total  phosphorus  before \neffluent discharge. The double filtration tank comprises a filtration tank and a rotating microfilter \nmade up of microfiber cloths capable of filtering fine particles through different pore sizes. Each \nunit of the SMART module can be designed for the specific treatment needs at each wastewater \ntreatment  plant.  The  local  environmental  protection  bureaus  will  monitor  the  quality  of  the \ntreated wastewater using a continuous emission monitoring system. \n  \n13. \nimplementing, and administering the project companies.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nSound  Global  Ltd.  is  responsible  for  identifying,  evaluating,  selecting,  negotiating, \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nThe project impact includes enhanced environment and mitigated pollution in the PRC\u2019s \n14. \nrural  areas,  particularly  in  townships  currently  without  wastewater  treatment  facilities.

Influent \nand effluent will be metered with minimum offtake quantities in all the plants. \nWastewater tariffs will be governed by the cost\u2013plus regulations set by the \ncentral government and paid by the city or county governments based on the \nconcession agreements. Sound Global Ltd. will construct the trunk sewage \npipeline networks to link the plants based on a build\u2013transfer arrangement.  \nSound Global Ltd. will centrally control all project development, procurement, \nand financing arrangements across its operations. Sound Global Ltd. will assign \na seconded experienced general manager to the each plant. Cash is centrally \nmanaged through the cash management system. \nJanuary 2015\u2013December 2017 \nSMART application will be sourced by Sound Global Ltd. Other goods and \nservices will be procured from Asian Development Bank members in a \ntransparent manner. Sound Global Ltd. will centrally manage engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contracts with subcontractors. \n\nBuild\u2013operate\u2013transfer plants generate construction revenue, operating income, \nand interest income. Trunk sewage pipelines under build\u2013transfer contracts \ncontribute construction revenue. \nThe major operating costs comprise electricity, chemicals, and payroll and \nmaintenance expense. \nDaughter plants do not need skilled staff on site for operations. Seconded staff \nfrom Sound Global Ltd. will handle most operation and maintenance work of the \nmother plant with support from locally recruited staff. \nThe mother plant will monitor each daughter plant. Sound Global Ltd. will report \ndata on key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, \nand compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nConstruction \narrangement \n\nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure \n\nMajor cost structure \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nSMART = small multiple modular automatic rapid technologies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n20. \nInitial  financial  projections  indicate  the  project  would  yield  a  minimum  financial  internal \nrate  of  return  is  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The  project  is  economically \nviable as the economic internal rate of return is higher than the social discount rate of 12%. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n                                                 \n19 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f7 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB\u2019s proposed assistance to Sound Global Ltd.  and BSEE comprises (i) an A-loan of \n21. \nup  to  $100  million  in  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii)  a  complementary  loan  of  up  to  $200  million \nequivalent in dollars and yuan. ADB will fund the A-loan from its ordinary capital resources; the \ncomplementary loan will be funded by participating banks with ADB acting as lender of record. \nThe  proposed  A-loan  will  have  a  maturity  of  up  to  10  years  from  the  date  of  the  first \ndisbursement. The complementary loan will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the \nA-loan.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nThe project will bring urgently needed infrastructure into rural areas. Access to finance is \n22. \nidentified as one of the key bottlenecks to better sector performance. City commercial banks are \nless active in rural areas. Rural credit cooperatives and village and township banks are the main \nofficial  banking  institutions  servicing  borrowers  outside  of  cities.  Each  branch  office  cannot \noperate beyond its designated township or village. Their loans are mainly provided to township \nand village enterprises, which are managed by township and village governments. ADB support \nis  crucial  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  rural  environmental  infrastructure,  where \ncommercial finance is still scarce. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s value addition is to link the private sector-led rural infrastructure projects with the \nwider financing community, including international banks by aggregating small-scale subprojects \nand providing in-depth technical and safeguard due diligence. ADB\u2019s assistance is designed to \nlower  transaction  costs  by  adopting  a  portfolio  approach  to  finance  multiple  wastewater \ntreatment subprojects, which are often too small and time-consuming for international banks to \nfinance on a stand-alone basis. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n24. \nRevenue risk. Sound Global Ltd. still derives a majority of its revenue from construction \nservices,  which  has  only  short-term  revenue  visibility  and  is  dependent  on  a  steady  stream  of \nengineering  procurement  construction  contract  wins.  However,  greater  emphasis  on \nenvironmental  protection  in  the  PRC  should  result  in  higher  demand  for  engineering \nprocurement  construction  services  and  Sound  Global  Ltd.  can  leverage  its  in-house  research \ncapabilities  to  secure  more  contracts.  In  the  BOT  segment,  Sound  Global  Ltd.\u2019s  subprojects \noperate  under  standardized  concession  arrangements  with  guarantee  minimum  offtake  and \nregulated  cost\u2013plus  tariffs.  Further  mitigating  this  risk  are  (i)  large  latent  demand  for  rural \nwastewater  treatment  and  (ii)  strong  policy  pressure  for  tariff  reform  to  achieve  full  cost-\nrecovery. \n \n25. \nOfftake  counterparty  risk.  Wastewater  treatment  fees  are  publicly  announced  and \nreliably collected from end-users through bundling with water distribution fees and backstopped \nby  host  governments  under  concession  agreement  obligations.  Sound  Global  Ltd.  practices \ncomprehensive  financial  analysis  of  government  counterparties.  The  project  benefits  from  its \nportfolio approach to diversify offtake risk among subprojects. \n \n\n\f8 \n\nFinancial  risk.  Sound  Global  Ltd.\u2019s  new  business  strategy  to  shift  to  more  BOT  and \n26. \nbuild\u2013transfer projects will require large up-front capital costs. Each BOT concession will need \nto  be  debt  financed  through  long-term  project  loans,  which  will  increase  Sound  Global  Ltd.\u2019s \nfinancial leverage. At the same time, free cash flow at the project level will remain negative for \nthe first few years of operation. The risk is partially mitigated by (i) Sound Global Ltd.\u2019s strong \nliquidity  position  with  sufficient  cash  on  hand  and  revenue  growth  from  its  cash-generating \nconstruction business, (ii) more stable and predictable operating cash flows from its expanding \nportfolio  of  BOT  projects,  and  (iii)  strengthened  equity  base  after  recent  full  conversion  of \nconvertible notes. \n \n27. \nCompletion  and  operating  risk.  Sound  Global  Ltd.  has  a  proven  technical  and \nmanagement track record in construction, and operation and maintenance. The risk is mitigated \nby the homogeneous nature of the subprojects, and the modularized and standardized nature of \nthe SMART technology, as well as low number of staff required for plant operation. \n \n28. \nAssociated  infrastructure  risk.  The  success  of  a  wastewater  treatment  subproject \nrelies  not  only  on  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  plant,  but  also  on  the  readiness  and \nreliability  of  the  associated  infrastructure,  especially  the  pipelines  and  pump  stations. \nTraditionally, this infrastructure is constructed and owned by municipal governments. This risk is \npartly  mitigated  by  Sound  Global  Ltd.\u2019s  business  model  to  take  over  the  construction  of  trunk \nsewage pipelines under a build\u2013transfer arrangement. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nSafeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment  as  potential  adverse \n29. \nenvironmental  impacts  of  future  subprojects  are  negligible  if  the  water  treatment  system \nfunctions  properly.  Detailed facility  location,  design,  and  operation  plans will  be  determined  by \nthe  concession  agreements,  and  an  initial  environmental  examination  will  be  prepared  for  the \nproject according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), after subprojects are identified. \nThe  initial  environmental  examination  will  include  an  environmental  management  plan,  which \nwill manage possible environmental adverse impacts during construction and operation. \n30. \nAt  this  stage,  ADB  proceeds  are  not  allocated  for  implementing  specific  subprojects. \nTherefore,  this  loan  is  classified  as  general  corporate  finance,  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  Sound  Global  Ltd.  commissioned  qualified  external  experts  to  conduct  a \ncorporate  audit  of  its  current  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS)  and  the \ncompany\u2019s past and current performance against the objectives, principles, and requirements of \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The experts prepared corrective action plans for the current \nESMS  to  address  gaps  identified  between  the  current  ESMS  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement requirements. The company has committed to incorporate the corrective action plans \ninto its ESMS. ADB will confirm the company\u2019s revised ESMS before the first disbursement. \n \n31. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  audit  finds  that  the  land  acquisition  is  expected  to  be  located  in \nsparsely  populated  rural  areas  near  or  surrounding  the  townships,  which  reduces  impacts  on \nlocal residents. As the area is generally nonresidential, house demolition in the buffer zone can \nbe avoided. Land acquisition is not expected to be significant and is normally carried out by the \nlocal governments before awarding the concession. The audit also finds that the client needs to \n\n\f9 \n\nimprove  its  ESMS  performance  and  staffing  issues.  Sound  Global  Ltd.  will  follow  its  revised \nESMS prior to the disbursement for the first subproject and hire capable staff to ensure that the \nESMS is implemented. The ESMS will include resettlement policy principles and procedures to \nmake sure that subprojects using ADB funds are screened. If the subprojects entail physical and \neconomic displacement, resettlement plans will be prepared following national laws of the PRC \nand  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  Requirement  2  on  Involuntary \nResettlement. The audit also notes that the project will not impact ethnic minorities. \n \nOther  social  dimensions.  The  project  is  categorized  as  no  gender  elements.  Sound \n32. \nGlobal Ltd. upholds gender equality, and provides equal benefits and training opportunities for \nboth  men  and  women.  Priorities  are  provided  to  women  if  the  jobs  are  more  appropriate  for \nfemale staff, such as in the finance and human resource departments, and laboratories. Sound \nGlobal Ltd. is committed to undertaking the following measures: (i) support the engagement of \nwomen  in  construction  activities  by  contractors,  and  (ii)  regularly  reach  out  to  concerns  of \nresidents  including  women,  through  consultations  with  resident  welfare  associations.  Sound \nGlobal  Ltd.  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  and  report  regularly  to  ADB  on \nmeasures  taken  to  ensure  compliance  (including  that  of  contractors)  with  national  labor  laws \nand adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.20 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n33. \nSound  Global  Ltd.  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\n\n34. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n35. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),21 the government\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to Sound Global Ltd. and \nBSEE  will  be  obtained.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and \nsubstance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  the  Board  of \nDirectors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n36. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of the  President,  under the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan facility of up to $300,000,000 equivalent in dollars and yuan to Sound Global \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2001.
