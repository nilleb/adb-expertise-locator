I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof $25,100,000 to Sylvan Agriculture Limited for the PRAN Agribusiness Project in Bangladesh. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  In 2010 and 2011, the Private Sector Operations Department of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) conducted business development missions to Bangladesh to explore investment \nopportunities  in  sectors  with  high  potential  for  development  impact.  Several  agribusiness \ncompanies  were  considered,  and  PRAN  was  found  to  be  one  of  the  most  professional, \nreputable, creditworthy, and able to use ADB\u2019s funds toward development. PRAN received \nfinancing from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for previous expansion projects.1 In \nJuly 2011, PRAN applied for ADB assistance to fund its investment in three new agribusiness \nfacilities: (i) a liquid glucose plant, (ii) a flour mill, and (iii) a frozen food processing plant. ADB\u2019s \ninvestment committee endorsed the concept review paper for the transaction in January 2012. \n \n3.  The project is central to PRAN's strategy of pursuing vertical integration and product \ndiversification. Investment in liquid glucose and flour amounts to vertical integration as these are \ningredients of PRAN\u2019s food products. Bangladesh does not produce high-quality liquid glucose, \nrequiring PRAN to import it from India. Vertical integration will help PRAN manage input costs \nand improve quality control, boosting its sales in Bangladesh and abroad. As part of its product \ndiversification strategy, PRAN plans to enter the promising frozen food business. PRAN can rely \non its industrial know-how and extensive distribution network and marketing capability to ensure \nthe project\u2019s success. \n \n4.  The project is consistent with the government\u2019s objective of making agriculture and food \nprocessing more productive and competitive. In particular, the Sixth Five-Year Plan, FY2011\u2013\nFY2015 emphasizes (i) import substitution for certain crops and food products, (ii) increased \nexports of high-value food products, (iii) increased private sector participation and investment in \nagribusiness, and (iv) food security and improved nutrition for all.2 PRAN will become one of the \nfirst companies to produce fortified flour in Bangladesh. \n \n2.  Project Design \n5.  The project will be developed by a new dedicated PRAN company, Sylvan Agriculture \nLimited (SAL), with full support from the group\u2019s functional departments. The project will be \nconstructed at two sites: the flour mill and frozen food processing plant in Danga, 30 kilometers \neast of Dhaka, and the liquid glucose plant in Olipur, 120 kilometers northeast of Dhaka. The \nliquid glucose plant could be located in Danga as well if sufficient power connection could be \nallocated from the grid. However, the Olipur site currently enjoys better energy supply. The land \nat both sites is owned by PRAN shareholders and will be provided to SAL as in-kind equity at a \nvaluation confirmed by independent land valuation reports. \n \n                                                \n1  IFC lent $15 million to PRAN in 2009 for corporate-wide expansion, $7 million in 2011 for a dairy project, and $25 \nmillion in 2012 for introducing new packaged foods, spices, and condiment to its product line. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning. 2011. Sixth Five-Year Plan: FY2011\u2013FY2015. Dhaka. \n ", "2 \n6.  PRAN\u2019s objective is to source as much raw material as possible from local farmers. \nLiquid glucose is made from starch, which can be derived from either maize or cassava, two \ncrops cultivated in Bangladesh. SAL plans to produce both liquid glucose and starch in-house. \nIn the first year of operation, however, SAL will procure starch from third parties while delaying \nstarch  production  until  glucose  production  has  stabilized.  From  the  second  year,  SAL  will \nprocure maize from local farmers (or cassava as a less likely alternative) to produce starch. \nFlour will be made from wheat. In the first year of operation, wheat will be imported to ensure \nappropriate quality. However, SAL plans to source high-quality wheat locally from the second \nyear. The frozen food that SAL intends to produce is mainly flat breads such as parata or \nchapati. As such, 83% of the raw material required for frozen food will be flour, which the \ncompany intends to produce in its own flour mill. \n \n7.  SAL will have an annual production capacity of 45,000 tons of liquid glucose, 90,000 \ntons of starch (half to be used for glucose production and half sold externally), 90,000 tons of \nflour, and 180 million units of flour-based frozen foods. Capacity utilization will rise slowly from \n50% in the first year to 90% in the fifth year. SAL will sell 50% of the liquid glucose produced \nand 25% of the flour produced to other group companies for preparing PRAN food products \n(e.g., juices, biscuits, and baked goods). However, most of SAL\u2019s production will be sold to \nexternal clients: 50% of liquid glucose and starch, 75% of flour, and 100% of frozen foods. While \nliquid glucose and starch will be sold solely for industrial use, flour will be sold wholesale to \nindustrial bakeries and retail as packaged flour. All frozen food sales will be retail. \n \n3.  The Sponsor \n8.  The PRAN group is one of the largest manufacturing groups in Bangladesh, the market \nleader in food under the PRAN brand and in plastics under the RFL brand. Its factories are \nlocated at 13 locations across the country. The group\u2019s estimated turnover in 2011 was $450 \nmillion.  It  is  made  up  of  25  companies,  two  of  which  are  publicly  listed:  the  Agricultural \nMarketing Company in food and Rangpur Foundry in plastics. \n \n9.  The group is controlled by Amjad Khan Chowdhury and his family. All group companies \nare 100% owned by the family except the two listed companies, in which the family retains 41% \nand 49%. Similarly, SAL will be 100% owned by the Chowdhury family, with a 40% equity stake \nheld by Amjad Khan Chowdhury, 40% by his son Ahsan Khan Chowdhury, and 20% by his wife, \nSabiha Amjad. Amjad Khan Chowdhury started his business after retiring from the Bangladesh \narmy in 1981 as a major general. \n \n10.  PRAN has leading market shares in Bangladesh in almost all segments in which it \noperates: 74% in juices, 35% in culinary products, 11% in biscuits and baked goods, and 60% in \nplastic household products. PRAN benefits from strong brand recognition supported by one of \nthe largest advertising budgets in the country. A key strength of the group is its extensive \ndistribution network of 14 depots and 3,600 distributors. \n \n11.  In addition to its domestic business, the group exports to 77 countries, with exports sales \nestimated at $70 million in 2011. The original export target was Bangladeshi expatriates, but \nPRAN now targets local populations as well, particularly other South Asians and Muslims, as \nPRAN\u2019s products are certified halal. India, the Middle East, and Africa each accounts for about \none third of the group\u2019s exports. PRAN has overseas offices in India, Malaysia, Singapore, and \nthe United Arab Emirates. \n \n ", "3 \n12.  PRAN\u2019s  companies  function  as  a  group  under  the  ownership  and  control  of  the \nChowdhury family. Intercompany transactions are conducted at arm\u2019s length, but the group has \nin  its  Dhaka  headquarters  centralized  functional  departments  to  manage  finance,  legal \nconcerns, development engineering, procurement, and human resources. The cost of these \nshared services is allocated to the different companies of the group based on transparent rules. \n \n13.  The group directly employs about 29,000 staff. Workers receive training, and all factories \nhave  day-care  facilities  for  workers  and  their  families.  The  workers  are  unionized,  and \nmanagement has excellent relationships with the unions. In addition, about 60,000 households \ndepend on PRAN business for their livelihood. PRAN engages contract farmers to ensure \nconsistent supply volume and quality and reduce dependence on imports, allowing PRAN food \nproducts to have about 90% local content. PRAN currently has under contract about 42,000 \nfarmers  all  over  Bangladesh  producing  mangos,  tomatoes,  mung  beans,  chili,  coriander, \nmustard, peanut, and aromatic rice, among other crops. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n14.  The project will help sustain high agricultural growth by connecting farmers to markets \nfor  processed  food  locally  and  abroad.  Agricultural  gross  domestic  product  growth  should \nremain at 4.5% on average from 2011 to 2020. The project will boost exports of agricultural and \nprocessed food products. The share of agricultural and food products in total exports could \nincrease from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2020. The project will help strengthen national food security \nby  improving  nutrition  with  affordable,  high-quality  foods.  The  percentage  of  wheat  flour \nproduced in Bangladesh that is fortified could increase from close to 0% in 2011 to at least 10% \nin 2020. \n \n2.  Outcome \n15.  The project\u2019s expected outcome will be the production of high-value food products with \ninputs from local farmers. SAL\u2019s annual sales are expected to exceed $50 million by 2016. \nAgricultural products sourced from Bangladeshi farmers are expected to reach a value of at \nleast $30 million by 2016. Direct employment is expected to benefit 1,000 workers by 2016, and \nindirect employment at least 50,000, especially farmers under contract. Food processing is a \nlight industry that typically employs a fair proportion of women. PRAN now employs 7,000 \nwomen, or 24% of its workforce. The project is expected to have some gender benefits, as SAL \nwill commit to employing at least 30% women. \n \n3.  Outputs \n16.  The expected outputs of the project will be the completion of the three agribusiness \nproject components by 2015, including the implementation of all corrective actions identified in \nenvironment and social safeguard plans by 2015.3 \n \n                                                \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n17.  Strategy  2020  identifies  support  to  agriculture  and  rural  areas  as  an  \u2015underlying \ncomponent of the inclusive growth strategy\u2016 because \u2015the majority of the poor still live in rural \nareas, and agriculture remains a source of productivity improvement, seasonal employment, \nand income growth\u2014especially when connected to urban, industrial, and export markets.\u20164 The \nproject is particularly relevant because PRAN, an integrated food and agribusiness company, \nconnects agricultural production to food processing and export markets. The project is also \nconsistent with Strategy 2020\u2019s objective of scaling up private sector development and private \nsector operations in all operational areas. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n18.  The project aligns with ADB\u2019s agriculture sector strategy. In particular, the Operational \nPlan  for  Sustainable  Food  Security  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  recommends  an  \u2015expanded \npartnership  with  the  private  sector\u2016  to  attract  \u2015more  direct  investments  in  productivity \nenhancement, agro-processing, agro-retailing, and other nonfarm rural business.\u2016 5 Assistance \nto an integrated food and agribusiness company also addresses the operational plan\u2019s objective \nof \u2015increasing synergy and value addition in the backward and forward linkages along the food \nand agriculture value chain.\u2016 Improved linkages along the value chain enhance productivity, \nemployment opportunities, exports, and regional trade, as well as food security for the poor. \n \n19.  Agriculture and natural resources is one of the six sectors identified for ADB assistance \nunder its country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2011\u20132015. In particular, the strategy \ndocument mentions that ADB's private sector operations will consider financial support for the \nfood  processing  industry.  The  project  will  benefit  from  synergies  with  ADB\u2019s  sovereign \nassistance to rural infrastructure and water resource management. For example, rural road \nimprovement may improve the ability of farmers to sell their products to PRAN.6 \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $35.8 million. Project costs include land (6%), civil works \n(19%), machinery and equipment (54%), starting raw material production (17%), financing (3%), \nand contingencies (1%).

Implementation Arrangements \n22.  Table 3 summarizes implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  The  project  will  operate  under  the  general  regulatory  framework  applicable  to \nframework  manufacturing  companies  in  Bangladesh.  Agribusiness  companies  benefit  from \nincentives such as a corporate tax holiday for the first 5 years of operation. \nManagement  As with all other group companies, SAL\u2019s strategic decisions will be made by its board \nof directors, which will include members of the Chowdhury family and a representative \nfrom management. Operational decisions will be delegated to the general manager of \nthe  company  and  executed  by  managers  of  each  business  line.  Production \nmanagement will be staffed by highly skilled personnel. \nImplementation  Construction has started and is expected to take 2 years, from January 2012 to \nperiod  December  2013.  According  to  ADB\u2019s  market  and  technical  consultant,  the  time \nprojected to complete the project is sufficient. \nConstruction  Procurement will be implemented in line with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \narrangements  amended from time to time) for private sector projects. Equipment and machinery will \nbe procured from international manufacturers to be selected  through competitive \nbidding. Potential suppliers identified by PRAN, most of them in western Europe and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, have good reputations. Equipment installation and \ncivil works will be carried out by a group company, selected in a transparent manner \nand operating at arm\u2019s length, that has constructed most of PRAN\u2019s factories. ADB\u2019s \nmarket and technical consultant is confident of the company\u2019s ability to carry out \nequipment installation and civil works. \nOperation and  The operation and maintenance of the project will be undertaken by SAL, with support \nmaintenance  from the PRAN group. The project will benefit from PRAN\u2019s manufacturing expertise. \nAll PRAN factories are ISO 9001  or  ISO 9000 certified for  quality management \nsystems.  SAL\u2019s  business  plan  includes  both  routine maintenance  and  significant \ncapital expenditure maintenance, such as to replace machinery, from the third year of \noperation. \nRaw material  Maize and wheat will ultimately be sourced from local farmers on contract to ensure \nsupply  good quality and price and certainty of supply, while providing farmers with technical \nassistance and reliable income over the long term. Initially, however, PRAN may rely \non the wholesale market for sourcing raw materials, as SAL\u2019s requirement is less than \n5% of the maize produced in or imported to Bangladesh and less than 1% of wheat \nproduced domestically or imported. Contract farming for the project will take 2\u20133 years \nto establish, as appropriate seeds, locations, and farmers have to be selected. \nSales,  The project will benefit from PRAN\u2019s extensive distribution network of 14 depots and \nmarketing, and  3,600 distributors across the country, as well as from its marketing capability. \ndistribution \n ", "6 \nAspects  Arrangements \nPerformance  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators and financial \nmonitoring  covenants, will be reported by PRAN companies. SAL will report on the percentage of \nwomen employed. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ISO = International Organization for Standardization, SAL = Sylvan Agriculture \nLimited. \nSources: PRAN and ADB analysis. \n \nF.  Unique Features \n23.  This is ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign agribusiness project since 1985. The project will support \nprivate sector job creation and strengthen nutrition security through flour fortification. PRAN has \nbeen working since 2005 with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition on food fortification, \nintroducing vitamins and minerals in biscuits, noodles, juices, and milk. Similarly, PRAN is \nplanning to fortify its flour with vitamins A and B and the minerals iron and zinc. Fortifying \nindustrially  processed  flour,  when  appropriately  implemented,  is  an  effective,  simple,  and \ninexpensive strategy for supplying vitamins and minerals in the diets of large segments of the \npopulation.7 Whereas  21%  of  wheat  flour  in  Southeast  Asia  is  fortified,  as  is  97%  in  the \nAmericas, almost none is in Bangladesh. The duty levied on food manufacturers\u2019 imports of \nvitamins and minerals is a major hurdle to food fortification in Bangladesh. PRAN is also an \naccredited supplier of high energy biscuits under the World Food Programme in Bangladesh. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n24.  It is proposed that ADB lend up to $25.1 million to the project company as a senior \nsecured loan. Corporate guarantees have been negotiated with four other group companies. \nBecause the ADB loan will help finance long-lived capital expenditure items, its door-to-door \ntenor will be 7 years, with a 2-year grace period on repaying principal. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n25.  ADB  will  provide  long-tenor  US  dollar  financing,  which  is  not  readily  available  in \nBangladesh. PRAN\u2019s partnership with ADB will contribute to further raising the international \nprofile of a \u2015national champion\u2016 in a strategic industry for Bangladesh. Agribusiness increasingly \ncontributes to gross domestic product and export growth and, as it is very labor intensive, will \ncontinue to create jobs. PRAN is already one of the largest private employers in the country. \nTogether with IFC, ADB will continue to promote good corporate governance, which will help \nPRAN raise more capital in the future from international debt and equity markets. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n26.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is category B \nfor  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental, health, and safety impacts and risks of the project have \nbeen identified in the Initial Environmental Examination, and effective corrective measures to \n                                                \n7  World Health Organization. 2009.

The institutional \ncapacity and commitment of SAL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are \ndeemed adequate. \n \n27.  Measures to benefit women and facilitate their involvement in constructing and operating \nthe project have been incorporated into project design in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development (1998). SAL will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and \nreport regularly to ADB on its compliance, and that of its contractors, with national labor laws \nand their adherence to internationally recognized core labor standards.9 Information disclosure \nand consultations with project stakeholders are consistent with ADB requirements.10 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n28.  SAL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n29.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n30.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nthe Government of Bangladesh will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed assistance to SAL. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of \nDirectors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n31.
