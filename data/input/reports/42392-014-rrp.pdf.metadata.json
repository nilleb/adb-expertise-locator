The  project  is  complemented  by  associated \ntechnical  assistance  (TA) 4  to \nimprove  sector  governance,  and  safety  regulation  and \nenforcement through institutional strengthening and legal and regulatory reforms.5 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nInfrastructure  constraints.  Inadequate  wharves  and  jetties  restrict  the  ability  of \ninterisland  vessels  to  call  at  destinations  in  all-weather  conditions.  Restricted  access  causes \nincreased  waiting  times  and  costs  and,  in  some  cases,  prevents  vessels  from  reaching  rural \nareas altogether. Poor wharf and jetty facilities create unsafe loading conditions for passengers \nand  loss  of  goods.  Port  Vila  has  insufficient  domestic  berths  and  faces  the  impending  loss  of \nnearly all remaining berths, with potentially severe consequences for national commerce. Out of \n21 wharves and jetties in Vanuatu, 11 are government-owned and the remainder are privately \nowned. Of the 11 government-owned wharves, 60% are in poor condition.     \n \n4. \nService  provision.  Vanuatu  has  a  sufficient  domestic  fleet,  but  services  are  not \nprovided to some remote locations as those routes are uneconomical. Shipping services are not \nprovided  because  demand  is  uncertain  in  rural  areas,  while  demand  is  not  effectively \ncommunicated  since  service  provisions  are  uncertain.  Interisland  water  transport  is,  therefore, \ninfrequent and unreliable.6  \n  \nCurrent  project.  The  current  project  was  approved  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n5. \n(ADB) Board on 30 November 2011 and was made effective on 6 September 2012. The project \nrepresented a return to borrowing by the government from ADB after a period of 12\u201313 years. \n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2011.

Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe Board of Directors: Proposed Loan, Administration of Grant, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Republic of \nVanuatu for the Interisland Shipping Support Project. Manila. \n5  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents Appendix 2). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nAround  the  same  time,  national  elections  were  held  and  accordingly,  it  took  time  for  the  new \ngovernment to get familiarized with ADB processes and complete pre-implementation activities \nwhich led to some delays in effectivity. \n\n \nThe  current  project  aims  to  build  a  new  interisland  shipping  terminal  in  Port  Vila,  with \n6. \nsufficient  berthing  capacity  to  handle  conventional  vessels  and  landing  crafts  in  the  Vanuatu \nfleet  simultaneously.  To  improve  rural  access,  one  outer  island  wharf  and  three  jetties  will  be \nconstructed,  and three existing  outer  island  wharves  will  be  rehabilitated  or  repaired.7 All  sites \nwill  have  ancillary  infrastructure,  as  appropriate  for  each  location,  to  cater  to  the  transit  of \npassengers  (including  market  shelters  and  separate  facilities  for  women,  children,  men,  and \npeople  with  disabilities)  and  storage  for  cargo  transshipment.  Wharves  and  jetties  will  be \ndesigned to endure a lifespan of 50 years. The design will adopt a low-maintenance strategy in \nrecognition  of  the  limited  capacity  for  maintenance  in  outer  islands,  and  will  include  climate-\nproofing measures. \n \n7. \nTo  improve  frequent  and  reliable  shipping  services  to  remote  areas,  two  shipping \nsupport  schemes  will  be  established:  (i)  the  SSS  will  provide  subsidies  for  a  fixed  number  of \nvoyages  at  designated  frequencies  on  otherwise  commercially  unviable  routes; 8  and  (ii)  a \nshipping  coordination  scheme  (SCS)  will  appoint  people  in  each  province  to  promote  and \naggregate  demand,  and  communicate  needs  for  voyages  to  private  sector  vessel  operators. \nThe SSS is based on a least-cost tender process for services to be provided by private sector \noperators. Under an output-based approach, subsidies are tied to performance, including vessel \nsuitability,  franchise  areas  and  routes,  voyage  locations  and  frequency,  and  substantiation  of \nvoyages. Vessels are required to meet safety standards, and carry insurance cover for vessels, \ncargo,  and  passengers.  Subsidies  will  be  reduced  over  time  as  routes  become  commercially \nviable. The support program is scheduled to be implemented over 5 years. \n \n8. \nThe  expected  outcome  of  the  current  project  is  that  private  sector  operators  provide \ninterisland shipping services that are reliable, safe, and adequately frequent.  Expected outputs \ninclude  (i)  improved  maritime  infrastructure  in  the  capital  and  rural  areas,  (ii)  establishment  of \nshipping support and coordination schemes, (iii) project management services for efficient and \neffective project implementation, and (iv) establishment of the Office of the Maritime Regulator. \n \n9. \nProject  management  and  implementation.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic \nManagement is the executing agency and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities is the \nimplementing agency. The government established Vanuatu Project Management Unit (VPMU) \nin  2010  to  manage  all  externally-funded  projects.  VPMU  operates  under  the  oversight  of  the \nVanuatu  Project  Management  Unit  Steering  Committee  (VPMU-SC)  (Table  4). 9 The  project \nimplementation team (PIT), comprising international and national consultants, assists VPMU in \nday-to-day implementation activities. \n \n10. \nImplementation  progress  and  project  performance.  Following  the  completion  of \ngeotechnical  investigations  in  March  2010,  the  detailed  engineering  designs  are  mostly \ncomplete  for  the  four  wharves  and  three  jetties,  and  bid  documents  have  been  finalized.  The \ngovernment will deliberate further on the construction of Waisisi wharf because (i) 8 kilometers \n\n \n\n                                                \n7  Wharf to be constructed in Waisisi Bay (Tanna) and jetties are at Port Sandwich (Malekula), Lolowai (Ambae), and \nLoltong (Pentecost). Existing wharves will be rehabilitated or repaired at  Litzlitz (Malekula), Lenakel (Tanna), and \nSimonsen (Espiritu Santo). \n\n8  Initially, to five destinations in Tafea and Sanma provinces. The scheme will be flexible and allow revision. \n9  The VPMU-SC is the steering committee for the project. \n\n\f3 \n\nof road and  three  bridges  would  need  to be  constructed from Waisisi  village  to  the  wharf  site, \nand (ii) site conditions and wave actions require a more detailed investigation.10  \n \n11. \nThe  SSS  has  been  established.  Shipping  services  routes  have  been  designed  and  a \ncontract has been awarded, with voyages commencing in August 2014 to the southern group of \nislands. A contract for the northern group of islands was awarded in November 2014. The SCS \nwas  slightly  modified  and  is  now  supplemented  by  shipping  administrator  capacity  building \nservices  under  a  minor  change  in  implementation  arrangements.  Under  this  arrangement,  a \nnational  consultant  was  engaged  to  administer  the  SSS,  supported  by  the  government\u2019s \nshipping support  unit  (SSU). The  SSU  is  adequately  resourced  and the  shipping  administrator \ncapacity building services will build the capacity of SSU staff in the administration of the SSS. \nSSU  staff  will  coordinate  with  provincial  governments  to  appoint  shipping  coordinators.  The \ncontract documents also require that the vessel operators appoint shipping coordinators in each \nprovince who will liaise between shipping operators and passengers.11 \n \nProject  performance  has  been  satisfactory  and  is  estimated  at  25%  complete.12 Pre-\n12. \nconstruction  activities  of  civil  works  are  under  way,  with  detailed  engineering  designs  for  the \nwharves  complete.  An  invitation  for  bids  was  issued  on  3  December  2014  and  closes  on \n11 February  2015.  Progress  under  the  SSS  is  satisfactory.  Contract  awards  are  at  1.0%  and \ndisbursements at 0.3% under the ADB loan. Contract awards are at 28% and disbursements at \n9%  under  the  parallel  grant  from  the  Government  of  New  Zealand. 13 The  grant  is  partially \nadministered by ADB. The project performance rating has been on track for the past 12 months. \nHowever, as of the fourth quarter of 2014, the project was rated an actual problem because the \ncontract  award  projection  was  not  met.  Pending  the  approval  of  the  proposed  additional \nfinancing, and award of the wharves contract in the first quarter of 2015, the project is expected \nto be back on track. \n \n13. \nSafeguard  compliance.  The  current  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment. \nVPMU  and  the  PIT  have  recruited  a  safeguards  specialist  to  update  and  supervise \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  and  to  undertake  monitoring \nas  required  in  the  approved  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs),  EMPs,  and  project \ndocuments. \n \n14. \nThe current project is classified category C for  involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. The loan agreement covenants are being complied with and the project\u2019s resettlement \nframework followed. Access to land has been negotiated with customary landowner groups. No \ninvoluntary land acquisition or physical displacements are expected. The due diligence report is \nbeing finalized, documenting consultations and agreements on land access. VPMU is recruiting \na  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  specialist  to  assist  in  completing  the  land  acquisition \n\n                                                \n10 This will be carried out under a minor change in scope subject to receiving favorable  a bid price for  the wharves \n\ncontract resulting in any surplus project funds. \n\n11 Similar  arrangements  are  successfully  operating \n\nIslands  under  ADB.  2008.  Report  and \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Asian  Development  Fund  Grant  and \nAdministration of Grant to Solomon Islands for the Domestic Maritime Support Project. Manila. \n\nin  Solomon \n\n12 The project is classified as satisfactory because (i) the detailed engineering design for the wharves (about 75% of \nproject funds) is complete and bids close on 11 February 2015; (ii) two contracts for the shipping support scheme \nare in place and bid documents are under preparation for two further contracts; and (iii) all consultancy contracts \nare  in  place.  The  project  was  assessed  during  the  review  mission  in  November  2014.  The  assessment  largely \ndraws  from  the  project  tracking  report  which  assigns  a  weight  to  each activity,  assesses actual progress  against \neach activity, and then derives the weighted progress score. \n\n13 Consulting  services,  which  started  in  2013,  are  fully  financed  through  the  grant  from  the  Government  of  New \n\nZealand. The majority of the ADB funds are for civil works for which contracts will be awarded in 2015. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nprocess  (lease  or  purchase)  and  to  finalize  the  due  diligence  report.  Inhabitants  of  the  wharf \nsites are indigenous and are the main beneficiaries. Adverse impacts on distinct and vulnerable \ngroups of indigenous peoples are not expected, and an indigenous peoples plan is not required. \n \nThe  current  project  activities  are  being  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  gender \n15. \naction  plan  (GAP).  The  PIT  has  engaged  a  community  development  and  gender  specialist  to \nassist in implementing the GAP and to support VPMU and Ministry of Infrastructure and Public \nUtilities staff in monitoring targeted indicators. \n \n16.  Management of risks. The risk assessment and management plan prepared under the \ncurrent  project  is  adhered  to.  The  contract  packages,  procurement  procedure,  and  consultant \nselection methods defined in the procurement plan are followed. Loan covenants relating to the \nfinancial management and audit of financial accounts are being complied with. \n \n17. \nAdditional  financing.  The  required  additional  financing  results  from  (i)  a  change  in \ntechnical  and  design  specifications  and  an  increase  in  the  bill  of  quantities  (BOQ);  (ii)  the \ngovernment\u2019s  request  for  a  change  in  project  scope  for  (a)  reconstruction  of  Simonsen  wharf \ninstead of rehabilitation, and (b) dredging of a channel in South Paray bay for easier access to \nthe  Port  Vila  domestic  wharf;  and  (iii)  additional  consulting  services  in  connection  with  the \nforegoing  including  an  IEE  for  (a)  Simonsen  wharf  and  (b)  proposed  dredged  channel.  As  a \nresult,  the  overall  project  costs  increased  by  $24.80  million  from  $26.82  million  in  2011  to \n$51.62 million in 2014\u2014a 92% increase. Table 1 summarizes the increase. \n\nTable 1: Summary of Increase \n\nTotal  \n\n% of Total Amount \nIncrease \n\nAmount Increase \n($ million) \n15.68 \n4.87 \n0.50 \n3.44 \n0.31 \n24.80 \n\n63.22 \n19.64 \n2.02 \n13.87 \n1.25 \n100.00 \n\nFactors \nChange in technical and design specifications \nChange in scope \nConsulting services for extended implementation period \nContingencies \nInterest during construction \n \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Vanuatu Project Management Unit estimates. \n \n18. \nChange of technical and design specifications, and bill of quantities. Geotechnical \ninvestigations completed in March 2014 revealed unforeseen conditions underneath the seabed. \nThese  result  in  (i)  an  increased  BOQ  (length  of  piles)  for  Port  Vila  domestic  and  Simonsen \nwharves and the jetties in Lolowai, Port Sandwich, and Loltong; and (ii) an increased BOQ for \nthe repairs of Lenakal and Litzlitz wharves.14 \n \nGovernment\u2019s  request  for  the  change  in  project  scope.  The  request  involves  the \n19. \nfor  rehabilitation; \n(i) reconstruction  of  Simonsen  wharf,  which  was  originally \n(ii) dredging  of  a  channel  in  South  Paray  bay  to  access  the  Port  Vila  domestic  wharf;  and \n(iii) additional  consultancy  services  for  the  coastal  process  study  and  environmental  impacts \nfrom the proposed dredged channel. An initial assessment of Simonsen wharf was carried out in \n2010  (footnote  2),  but  a  detailed  assessment  by  the  project  team  found  that  the  wharf  had \ndeteriorated  significantly  and  that  any  rehabilitation  would  not  be  cost-effective and  would last \n\nintended \n\n                                                \n14 The  wharves  were  initially  inspected  in  2010  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  (footnote  2).  They  were  again \ninspected in 2014 by the project team, which identified the need for major repairs to the existing concrete structure \nfor  wharf  and  land  craft  ramps;  installation  of  new  bollards  and  fenders;  construction  of  a  new  market  house, \nstorage shed, passenger shelters, and a toilet block; and supply and placement of materials for the causeways and \ntheir protection works. \n\n\f5 \n\nless than  10  years. The government  requested the reconstruction  of the wharf,  with  a  50-year \ndesign  life.  It  also  requested  that  a  navigable channel  be  dredged  through  the  sand  bars,15 to \nprovide  more  efficient  access  to  the  Port  Vila  domestic  wharf. 16  The  proposed  channel  is \n300.0 meters (m) long, 50.0 m wide, and 6.5 m deep. To confirm the feasibility and design of the \nchannel, further studies\u2014including coastal processes numerical modeling, geotechnical studies \non marine surficial sediments, an IEE, an assessment of marine physical and ecological impacts, \nan assessment of changes in coastal processes, and socioeconomic impacts of the dredging\u2014\nwill be undertaken with resources from additional financing. An environmental assessment and \nreview framework has been prepared, outlining the methodology of the IEE for Simonsen wharf, \nand the channel.17 \n \n20. \nExtension of implementation period. The project team assessed that the construction \nof the two wharves and three jetties will take 21 months while the repairs of the two wharves will \ntake  3  months,  bringing  the  total  contract  period  to  24  months.  The  contract  award  of  the \nwharves is expected in March 2015, leaving only 19 months for implementation until the original \nproject  completion  date  of  December  2016.  To  execute  the  contract  within  24  months,  the \ngovernment has requested a 6-month extension to the physical completion date. Therefore, the \nPIT  contract  will  be  extended  by  6  months  to  June  2017  to  provide  continuity  of  consultancy \nservices for  project  management  and  implementation  supervision,  and  these  costs  have  been \nincluded in Table 1. \n \n21. \nEligibility  for  additional  financing.  ADB  may  provide  additional  financing  to  projects \nthat (i) remain technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) are accorded \nhigh priority by the government; (iii) are consistent with the current project\u2019s objectives; and (iv) \nare consistent with the current country partnership strategy.18 The proposed additional financing \nmeets  these  eligibility  criteria.  Technical  soundness  has  been  strengthened  through  the \nadditional geotechnical information collected, and the updated economic internal rates of return \n(EIRRs) for all subprojects remain above 12%. The government has confirmed that the overall \nproject  is  a  nationally  important  strategic  investment  and  the  current  project\u2019s  development \nobjectives remain unchanged. The governments of New Zealand and Vanuatu will also support \nthe  project  with  additional  cofinancing  (para.  26).  The  Government  of  Vanuatu\u2019s  Priorities  and \nAction  Agenda,  2006\u20132015  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Vanuatu,  2010\u20132014 \nboth confirm sea transport as a strategic investment priority.19    \n \n22. \nSuitability  of  additional  financing  modality.  Without  additional  financing,  the  project \nwill  not  meet  its  overall  impact,  outcome  and  outputs.  The  engineering  designs  have  been \nmodified to minimize the potential risks from natural disasters. The additional financing will help \nretain most of the original project scope, except Waisisi wharf (para. 10), and meet the outcome \nof the project. \n\n                                                \n15 The channel would be in an area between south of Iririki Island and South Paray wharf site, which is 2.5 m deep at \n\nlow tide. \n\n16 The  current  project  had  envisaged  that  access  to  the  South  Paray  wharf  by  the  interisland  vessels  would  be \n\nthrough the passage between the Port Vila mainland and the Iririki Island.   \n\n17 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB. 2011.

The outcome will be \nprivate  sector  operators  provide  interisland  shipping  services  that  are  reliable,  safe,  and \nadequately frequent.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nProject  outputs  are  unchanged  except  for  changes  to  (i) Waisisi  wharf  in Tanna  (para. \n24. \n10), two new wharves and three jetties that will now be constructed, and two wharves that will \nnow  be  repaired;  and  (ii)  a  navigable  channel  that  will  be  dredged  in  South  Paray  Bay.  The \nphysical completion of these wharves and jetties will be extended from December 2016 to June \n2017. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nInvestments.

Wharf  and  jetty  infrastructure  facilities,  channel  dredging,  and  shipping  services  are  at \nvarious stages of implementation. The design life of the wharves conforms to the current project \nrequirements,  current  best  practice,  and  international  codes  and  standards.  The  marine \nstructures  have  included  earthquake  and  climate-resilient  design  features  to  remain  fully \noperational  within  the  design  life  period.  Technical  aspects  of  the  design  remain  largely \nunchanged  from  the  current  project,  but  have  been  strengthened  through  geotechnical \ninvestigations.  Overall,  the  civil  works  under  the  project  remain  technically  feasible.  The  SSS \nand SCS  are  being  implemented  with minor rearrangements,  with  the government\u2019s  SSU  now \nadministering  the  shipping  services.  The  subsidized  shipping  service  through  private  sector \nparticipation commenced in August 2014. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  four  wharves  and  three  jetties  was  reassessed. 25 A \n30. \nreassessment of the subprojects shows positive net present values of net benefits, and EIRRs \nfor  subprojects  generally  above  the  social  discount  rate  of  12%,  except  for  a  marginal  result \nshown  by  Loltong  wharf.  When  compared  with  the  2010  assessment,  like-for-like  subprojects\u2019 \neconomic  indicator  values  have reduced for  all  subprojects. This  was  expected,  as the  capital \ncosts of all the subprojects have increased significantly even though some of the increase was \noffset  by  the  combined effect  of  other  updates (e.g.,  use  of  the  correct  social  discount  rate  of \n12%  rather  than the  10%  used earlier,  benefits were  grown to 2014  prices)  introduced for the \n2014  analysis.  To  check  the  acceptability  of  the  economic  outputs  of  the  2014  analysis,  ADB \ncarried out an incremental analysis to see how the results varied by changing one parameter at \na time; it concludes that the reliability of the new results can safely be relied on. \n   \n31. \nThe  resilience  of  the  net  present  value  of  net  benefits  to  changes  in  key  input \nassumptions for the reappraisal was tested through a number of sensitivity tests. The 30 years \nsensitivity analysis results (EIRRs > 10%) indicate that all the wharves and jetties show strong \neconomic  cases  even  with  10%  increase  in  capital  costs  or  10%  decrease  in  benefits.  The \nsubprojects also included significant unquantified benefits. \n \n32. \nThe conclusions of the financial analysis have not changed since approval. It assumed \nthat  the  government  will  impose  modest  charges  for  the  use  of  wharf  in  Port  Vila  but  not \nelsewhere,  and  none  of  these  are  expected  to  operate  on  a  commercial  basis.  The  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  on  civil  works  is,  therefore,  negative,  which  is  acceptable  for  public \nfacilities,  particularly  with reasonable EIRRs. The maintenance expenditure forecast for  all  the \nwharves  has  been  estimated  at  $147,000  until  2027.  The  government  has  agreed  to  finance \nthese costs and will budget for this starting in 2018. Furthermore, the government is establishing \na  transport  infrastructure  maintenance  fund  for  the  long-term  sustainability  of  infrastructure \nassets.  During project  implementation,  discussions  with the  Ministry  of Finance  and Economic \nManagement  will  take  place  to  ensure  the  asset  register  and  asset  maintenance  plan  will \nprovide  the  necessary  information,  and  to  ensure  that  recurrent  budget  funding  for  the \nmaintenance  of  newly  constructed  and  repaired  assets  is  allocated  as  part  of  the  budget \nprocess. \n \n\n                                                \n25 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n \nA financial management assessment was completed as part of the current project.26 The \n33. \nassessment concluded that the overall inherent risk and overall control risk were moderate, and \nproposed  a  number  of  risk  mitigating  measures.  Since  2011,  VPMU  has  the  responsibility  to \nmanage  project  funds  and  report  to  financing  partners.  VPMU  is  adequately  staffed  with \nqualified  finance  personnel  and  has  appropriate  financial  management  systems  and  reporting \nmechanisms.  The  project  financial  management  arrangements  established  by  the  government \nthrough the Department of Finance and Treasury, and VPMU under the oversight of the VPMU-\nSC,  are  considered  to  be  operating  effectively,  and  no  change  to  those  arrangements  is \nproposed.  The  main  governance-related  risks,  with  an  emphasis  on  public \nfinancial \nmanagement and procurement, have been updated.27 \n \n34. \nA risk assessment and risk management plan was prepared for the current project. The \nassessment  concluded  that  procurement  and  corruption  risks  are  high,  however  mitigation \nmeasures are proposed. In addition, a report concluded that procurement remains a key area of \nconcern,  in  particular  the  ability  of  the  government  to  ensure that  its  procurement  policies  are \nfollowed  in  an  equitable,  efficient,  and  transparent  manner. 28 While  the  report  identified  an \nimprovement  in  the  availability  of  information  on  procurement  activities,  the  government  is \naddressing  procurement  concerns  with  financial  support  from  the  Government  of  Australia. \nVanuatu\u2019s score on the World Bank\u2019s governance indicator for control of corruption was +0.45 in \n2012,  which  placed  it  in  the  top  third for  effective control  of  corruption. Vanuatu is the  highest \nranking  country  in  the  Pacific,  excluding  Australia  and  New  Zealand. 29 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government under \nthe  current  project  and  will  continue to  apply.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n \n35. \nThe  additional  financing  does  not  include  any  additional  works  involving  issues  of \ninvoluntary  settlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and  gender.  All  civil  works  under  the  additional \nfinancing will be undertaken at locations that have already been identified and subject to access \narrangements  prepared  under  the  current  project.  The  resettlement  framework  has  been \nupdated.30 Additional documentation on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples is not \nrequired for the project. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the project has \nbeen updated.31 \n  \n36. \nThe improvement in shipping services for remote rural communities will greatly enhance \naccess to essential social services and market opportunities, especially for women. The project \nincludes specific features to accommodate women\u2019s needs in constructed or repaired wharves, \nas well as to meet women\u2019s demands for shipping services. The project is proposed for effective \ngender  mainstreaming.  The  GAP  and  its  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework \nunder the current project remain unchanged and will be applied to the project. \n \n\n                                                \n26 ADB. 2011.

Except for Simonsen wharf, the design modifications of \nthe  wharves  and  jetties  will  not  result  in  any  environmental  impacts  different  from  those \ndescribed in the approved IEEs because (i) the location and footprint for each wharf remains the \nsame; (ii) the increased depth of piles would not create any different impacts from those already \nidentified  and  for  which  mitigations  are  proposed;  and  (iii)  the  transportation  of  plant  and \nmaterial, and approximate period of the works (3\u20136 months at each site) will remain the same. \nAny modifications to wharf designs will be updated in the EMPs and the updated EMPs will be \nincluded  in  the  bid  documents.  The  project  now  includes  (i) construction  of  Simonsen  wharf \ninstead  of  rehabilitation  at  the  same  location,  and  (ii)  a  dredged  channel  in  South  Paray  bay \n(para. 19). The IEE of Simonsen wharf and proposed dredging of the channel will be prepared \nas  outlined  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  from  the  additional \nfinancing  funds  to  comply  with  Vanuatu  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \nincluding clearance by ADB and the Department of Environment Protection and Conservation. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n \n38. \nThe  project  risks  will  continue  to  be  managed  through  mechanisms  established  under \nthe current project to ensure that ADB procedures on consultant recruitment, procurement, and \ndisbursement are closely followed and project financial accounts are audited. The updated risk \nassessment and risk management plan will be followed. No additional risks are identified.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n39. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the \nupdated PAM and loan documents.
