THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan;  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of \nNew Zealand, both to the Republic of Vanuatu for the additional financing of the Interisland \nShipping Support Project.1 The need for additional financing is due to (i) changes in technical \nand  design  specifications  of  certain  wharves  and  jetties;  (ii)  the  government\u2019s  request  for \nchanges in scope; and (iii) additional consulting services in connection with the foregoing.   \n \n2.  The project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of interisland shipping services.2 \nThis involves (i) the construction and repair of wharves and jetties, with associated facilities, in \nthe national capital of Port Vila and five outer islands;3 and (ii) the establishment of a shipping \nsupport  scheme  (SSS)  to  catalyze  the  provision  of  services  to  remote  noncommercial \ndestinations using an output-based aid approach. The project is complemented by associated \ntechnical  assistance  (TA) 4  to  improve  sector  governance,  and  safety  regulation  and \nenforcement through institutional strengthening and legal and regulatory reforms.5 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Infrastructure  constraints.  Inadequate  wharves  and  jetties  restrict  the  ability  of \ninterisland vessels to call at destinations in all-weather conditions. Restricted access causes \nincreased waiting times and costs and, in some cases, prevents vessels from reaching rural \nareas altogether. Poor wharf and jetty facilities create unsafe loading conditions for passengers \nand loss of goods. Port Vila has insufficient domestic berths and faces the impending loss of \nnearly all remaining berths, with potentially severe consequences for national commerce. Out of \n21 wharves and jetties in Vanuatu, 11 are government-owned and the remainder are privately \nowned. Of the 11 government-owned wharves, 60% are in poor condition.     \n \n4.  Service  provision.  Vanuatu  has  a  sufficient  domestic  fleet,  but  services  are  not \nprovided to some remote locations as those routes are uneconomical. Shipping services are not \nprovided  because  demand  is  uncertain  in  rural  areas,  while  demand  is  not  effectively \ncommunicated since service provisions are uncertain. Interisland water transport is, therefore, \ninfrequent and unreliable.6  \n  \n5.  Current project. The current project was approved by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Board on 30 November 2011 and was made effective on 6 September 2012. The project \nrepresented a return to borrowing by the government from ADB after a period of 12\u201313 years. \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011.

Manila. \n5  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents Appendix 2). ", "2 \n \nAround the same time, national elections were held and accordingly, it took time for the new \ngovernment to get familiarized with ADB processes and complete pre-implementation activities \nwhich led to some delays in effectivity. \n \n6.  The current project aims to build a new interisland shipping terminal in Port Vila, with \nsufficient berthing capacity to handle conventional vessels and landing crafts in the Vanuatu \nfleet simultaneously. To improve rural access, one outer island wharf and three jetties will be \nconstructed, and three existing outer island wharves will be rehabilitated or repaired.7 All sites \nwill have ancillary infrastructure, as appropriate for each location, to cater to the transit of \npassengers (including market shelters and separate facilities for women, children, men, and \npeople  with  disabilities)  and  storage  for  cargo  transshipment.  Wharves  and  jetties  will  be \ndesigned to endure a lifespan of 50 years. The design will adopt a low-maintenance strategy in \nrecognition of the limited capacity for maintenance in outer islands, and will include climate-\nproofing measures. \n \n7.  To  improve  frequent  and  reliable  shipping  services  to  remote  areas,  two  shipping \nsupport schemes will be established: (i) the SSS will provide subsidies for a fixed number of \nvoyages  at  designated  frequencies  on  otherwise  commercially  unviable  routes;8 and  (ii)  a \nshipping  coordination  scheme  (SCS)  will  appoint  people  in  each  province  to  promote  and \naggregate demand, and communicate needs for voyages to private sector vessel operators. \nThe SSS is based on a least-cost tender process for services to be provided by private sector \noperators. Under an output-based approach, subsidies are tied to performance, including vessel \nsuitability, franchise areas and routes, voyage locations and frequency, and substantiation of \nvoyages. Vessels are required to meet safety standards, and carry insurance cover for vessels, \ncargo, and passengers. Subsidies will be reduced over time as routes become commercially \nviable. The support program is scheduled to be implemented over 5 years. \n   \n8.  The expected outcome of the current project is that private sector operators provide \ninterisland shipping services that are reliable, safe, and adequately frequent. Expected outputs \ninclude (i) improved maritime infrastructure in the capital and rural areas, (ii) establishment of \nshipping support and coordination schemes, (iii) project management services for efficient and \neffective project implementation, and (iv) establishment of the Office of the Maritime Regulator. \n \n9.  Project management and implementation. The Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement is the executing agency and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities is the \nimplementing agency. The government established Vanuatu Project Management Unit (VPMU) \nin 2010 to manage all externally-funded projects. VPMU operates under the oversight of the \nVanuatu Project Management Unit Steering Committee (VPMU-SC) (Table 4).9 The project \nimplementation team (PIT), comprising international and national consultants, assists VPMU in \nday-to-day implementation activities. \n \n10.  Implementation  progress  and  project  performance.  Following  the  completion  of \ngeotechnical  investigations  in  March  2010,  the  detailed  engineering  designs  are  mostly \ncomplete for the four wharves and three jetties, and bid documents have been finalized. The \ngovernment will deliberate further on the construction of Waisisi wharf because (i) 8 kilometers \n                                                \n7  Wharf to be constructed in Waisisi Bay (Tanna) and jetties are at Port Sandwich (Malekula), Lolowai (Ambae), and \nLoltong (Pentecost). Existing wharves will be rehabilitated or repaired at Litzlitz (Malekula), Lenakel (Tanna), and \nSimonsen (Espiritu Santo). \n8  Initially, to five destinations in Tafea and Sanma provinces. The scheme will be flexible and allow revision. \n9  The VPMU-SC is the steering committee for the project. ", "3 \nof road and three bridges would need to be constructed from Waisisi village to the wharf site, \nand (ii) site conditions and wave actions require a more detailed investigation.10  \n \n11.  The SSS has been established. Shipping services routes have been designed and a \ncontract has been awarded, with voyages commencing in August 2014 to the southern group of \nislands. A contract for the northern group of islands was awarded in November 2014. The SCS \nwas slightly modified and is now supplemented by shipping administrator capacity building \nservices under a minor change in implementation arrangements. Under this arrangement, a \nnational  consultant  was  engaged  to  administer  the  SSS,  supported  by  the  government\u2019s \nshipping support unit (SSU). The SSU is adequately resourced and the shipping administrator \ncapacity building services will build the capacity of SSU staff in the administration of the SSS. \nSSU staff will coordinate with provincial governments to appoint shipping coordinators. The \ncontract documents also require that the vessel operators appoint shipping coordinators in each \nprovince who will liaise between shipping operators and passengers.11 \n \n12.  Project performance has been satisfactory and is estimated at 25% complete.12 Pre-\nconstruction activities of civil works are under way, with detailed engineering designs for the \nwharves complete. An invitation for bids was issued on 3 December 2014 and closes  on \n11 February 2015. Progress under the SSS is satisfactory. Contract awards are at 1.0% and \ndisbursements at 0.3% under the ADB loan. Contract awards are at 28% and disbursements at \n9% under the parallel grant from the Government of New Zealand.13 The grant is partially \nadministered by ADB. The project performance rating has been on track for the past 12 months. \nHowever, as of the fourth quarter of 2014, the project was rated an actual problem because the \ncontract  award  projection  was  not  met.  Pending  the  approval  of  the  proposed  additional \nfinancing, and award of the wharves contract in the first quarter of 2015, the project is expected \nto be back on track. \n \n13.  Safeguard compliance. The current project is classified category B for environment. \nVPMU  and  the  PIT  have  recruited  a  safeguards  specialist  to  update  and  supervise \nimplementation of the environmental management plans (EMPs) and to undertake monitoring \nas  required  in  the  approved  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs),  EMPs,  and  project \ndocuments. \n \n14.  The current project is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. The loan agreement covenants are being complied with and the project\u2019s resettlement \nframework followed. Access to land has been negotiated with customary landowner groups. No \ninvoluntary land acquisition or physical displacements are expected. The due diligence report is \nbeing finalized, documenting consultations and agreements on land access. VPMU is recruiting \na  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  specialist  to  assist  in  completing  the  land  acquisition \n                                                \n10 This will be carried out under a minor change in scope subject to receiving favorable a bid price for the wharves \ncontract resulting in any surplus project funds. \n11 Similar  arrangements  are  successfully  operating  in  Solomon  Islands  under  ADB.  2008.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development Fund Grant and \nAdministration of Grant to Solomon Islands for the Domestic Maritime Support Project. Manila. \n12 The project is classified as satisfactory because (i) the detailed engineering design for the wharves (about 75% of \nproject funds) is complete and bids close on 11 February 2015; (ii) two contracts for the shipping support scheme \nare in place and bid documents are under preparation for two further contracts; and (iii) all consultancy contracts \nare in place. The project was assessed during the review mission in November 2014. The assessment largely \ndraws from the project tracking report which assigns a weight to each activity, assesses actual progress against \neach activity, and then derives the weighted progress score. \n13 Consulting services, which started in 2013, are fully financed through the grant from the Government of New \nZealand. The majority of the ADB funds are for civil works for which contracts will be awarded in 2015. \n ", "4 \n \nprocess (lease or purchase) and to finalize the due diligence report. Inhabitants of the wharf \nsites are indigenous and are the main beneficiaries. Adverse impacts on distinct and vulnerable \ngroups of indigenous peoples are not expected, and an indigenous peoples plan is not required. \n \n15.  The current project activities are being implemented in accordance with the gender \naction plan (GAP). The PIT has engaged a community development and gender specialist to \nassist in implementing the GAP and to support VPMU and Ministry of Infrastructure and Public \nUtilities staff in monitoring targeted indicators. \n \n16.  Management of risks. The risk assessment and management plan prepared under the \ncurrent project is adhered to. The contract packages, procurement procedure, and consultant \nselection methods defined in the procurement plan are followed. Loan covenants relating to the \nfinancial management and audit of financial accounts are being complied with. \n \n17.  Additional financing. The required additional financing results from (i) a change in \ntechnical and design specifications and an increase in the bill of quantities (BOQ); (ii) the \ngovernment\u2019s request for a change in project scope for (a) reconstruction of Simonsen wharf \ninstead of rehabilitation, and (b) dredging of a channel in South Paray bay for easier access to \nthe Port Vila domestic wharf; and (iii) additional consulting services in connection with the \nforegoing including an IEE for (a) Simonsen wharf and (b) proposed dredged channel. As a \nresult, the overall project costs increased by $24.80 million from $26.82 million in 2011 to \n$51.62 million in 2014\u2014a 92% increase. Table 1 summarizes the increase. \nTable 1: Summary of Increase \nAmount Increase  % of Total Amount \nFactors  ($ million)  Increase \nChange in technical and design specifications  15.68  63.22 \nChange in scope  4.87  19.64 \nConsulting services for extended implementation period  0.50  2.02 \nContingencies  3.44  13.87 \nInterest during construction  0.31  1.25 \n  Total   24.80  100.00 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Vanuatu Project Management Unit estimates. \n \n18.  Change of technical and design specifications, and bill of quantities. Geotechnical \ninvestigations completed in March 2014 revealed unforeseen conditions underneath the seabed. \nThese result in (i) an increased BOQ (length of piles) for Port Vila domestic and Simonsen \nwharves and the jetties in Lolowai, Port Sandwich, and Loltong; and (ii) an increased BOQ for \nthe repairs of Lenakal and Litzlitz wharves.14 \n \n19.  Government\u2019s request for the change in project scope. The request involves the \n(i) reconstruction  of  Simonsen  wharf,  which  was  originally  intended  for  rehabilitation; \n(ii) dredging of a channel in South Paray bay to access the Port Vila domestic wharf; and \n(iii) additional consultancy services for the coastal process study and environmental impacts \nfrom the proposed dredged channel. An initial assessment of Simonsen wharf was carried out in \n2010 (footnote 2), but a detailed assessment by the project team found that the wharf had \ndeteriorated significantly and that any rehabilitation would not be cost-effective and would last \n                                                \n14 The wharves were initially inspected in 2010 under the project preparatory TA (footnote 2). They were again \ninspected in 2014 by the project team, which identified the need for major repairs to the existing concrete structure \nfor wharf and land craft ramps; installation of new bollards and fenders; construction of a new market house, \nstorage shed, passenger shelters, and a toilet block; and supply and placement of materials for the causeways and \ntheir protection works. ", "5 \nless than 10 years. The government requested the reconstruction of the wharf, with a 50-year \ndesign life. It also requested that a navigable channel be dredged through the sand bars,15 to \nprovide  more  efficient access  to  the  Port  Vila  domestic  wharf.16 The  proposed  channel  is \n300.0 meters (m) long, 50.0 m wide, and 6.5 m deep. To confirm the feasibility and design of the \nchannel, further studies\u2014including coastal processes numerical modeling, geotechnical studies \non marine surficial sediments, an IEE, an assessment of marine physical and ecological impacts, \nan assessment of changes in coastal processes, and socioeconomic impacts of the dredging\u2014\nwill be undertaken with resources from additional financing. An environmental assessment and \nreview framework has been prepared, outlining the methodology of the IEE for Simonsen wharf, \nand the channel.17 \n \n20.  Extension of implementation period. The project team assessed that the construction \nof the two wharves and three jetties will take 21 months while the repairs of the two wharves will \ntake 3 months, bringing the total contract period to 24 months. The contract award of the \nwharves is expected in March 2015, leaving only 19 months for implementation until the original \nproject completion date of December 2016. To execute the contract within 24 months, the \ngovernment has requested a 6-month extension to the physical completion date. Therefore, the \nPIT contract will be extended by 6 months to June 2017 to provide continuity of consultancy \nservices for project management and implementation supervision, and these costs have been \nincluded in Table 1. \n \n21.  Eligibility for additional financing. ADB may provide additional financing to projects \nthat (i) remain technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) are accorded \nhigh priority by the government; (iii) are consistent with the current project\u2019s objectives; and (iv) \nare consistent with the current country partnership strategy.18 The proposed additional financing \nmeets  these  eligibility  criteria.  Technical  soundness  has  been  strengthened  through  the \nadditional geotechnical information collected, and the updated economic internal rates of return \n(EIRRs) for all subprojects remain above 12%. The government has confirmed that the overall \nproject is a nationally important strategic investment and the current project\u2019s development \nobjectives remain unchanged. The governments of New Zealand and Vanuatu will also support \nthe project with additional cofinancing (para. 26). The Government of Vanuatu\u2019s Priorities and \nAction Agenda, 2006\u20132015 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Vanuatu, 2010\u20132014 \nboth confirm sea transport as a strategic investment priority.19    \n \n22.  Suitability of additional financing modality. Without additional financing, the project \nwill not meet its overall impact, outcome and outputs. The engineering designs have been \nmodified to minimize the potential risks from natural disasters. The additional financing will help \nretain most of the original project scope, except Waisisi wharf (para. 10), and meet the outcome \nof the project. \n                                                \n15 The channel would be in an area between south of Iririki Island and South Paray wharf site, which is 2.5 m deep at \nlow tide. \n16 The current project had envisaged that access to the South Paray wharf by the interisland vessels would be \nthrough the passage between the Port Vila mainland and the Iririki Island.   \n17 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB. 2011.

The outcome will be \nprivate  sector  operators  provide  interisland  shipping  services  that  are  reliable,  safe,  and \nadequately frequent.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n24.  Project outputs are unchanged except for changes to (i) Waisisi wharf in Tanna (para. \n10), two new wharves and three jetties that will now be constructed, and two wharves that will \nnow be repaired; and (ii) a navigable channel that will be dredged in South Paray Bay. The \nphysical completion of these wharves and jetties will be extended from December 2016 to June \n2017. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n25.  Investments.

Technical \n \n29.  Wharf and jetty infrastructure facilities, channel dredging, and shipping services are at \nvarious stages of implementation. The design life of the wharves conforms to the current project \nrequirements,  current  best  practice,  and  international  codes  and  standards.  The  marine \nstructures  have  included  earthquake  and  climate-resilient  design  features  to  remain  fully \noperational  within  the  design  life  period.  Technical  aspects  of  the  design  remain  largely \nunchanged  from  the  current  project,  but  have  been  strengthened  through  geotechnical \ninvestigations. Overall, the civil works under the project remain technically feasible. The SSS \nand SCS are being implemented with minor rearrangements, with the government\u2019s SSU now \nadministering the shipping services. The subsidized shipping service through private sector \nparticipation commenced in August 2014. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n30.  The economic evaluation of the four wharves and three jetties was reassessed.25 A \nreassessment of the subprojects shows positive net present values of net benefits, and EIRRs \nfor subprojects generally above the social discount rate of 12%, except for a marginal result \nshown by Loltong wharf. When compared with the 2010 assessment, like-for-like subprojects\u2019 \neconomic indicator values have reduced for all subprojects. This was expected, as the capital \ncosts of all the subprojects have increased significantly even though some of the increase was \noffset by the combined effect of other updates (e.g., use of the correct social discount rate of \n12% rather than the 10% used earlier, benefits were grown to 2014 prices) introduced for the \n2014 analysis. To check the acceptability of the economic outputs of the 2014 analysis, ADB \ncarried out an incremental analysis to see how the results varied by changing one parameter at \na time; it concludes that the reliability of the new results can safely be relied on. \n   \n31.  The  resilience  of  the  net  present  value  of  net  benefits  to  changes  in  key  input \nassumptions for the reappraisal was tested through a number of sensitivity tests. The 30 years \nsensitivity analysis results (EIRRs > 10%) indicate that all the wharves and jetties show strong \neconomic cases even with 10% increase in capital costs or 10% decrease in benefits. The \nsubprojects also included significant unquantified benefits. \n \n32.  The conclusions of the financial analysis have not changed since approval. It assumed \nthat the government will impose modest charges for the use of wharf in Port Vila but not \nelsewhere, and none of these are expected to operate on a commercial basis. The financial \ninternal rate of return on civil works is, therefore, negative, which is acceptable for public \nfacilities, particularly with reasonable EIRRs. The maintenance expenditure forecast for all the \nwharves has been estimated at $147,000 until 2027. The government has agreed to finance \nthese costs and will budget for this starting in 2018. Furthermore, the government is establishing \na transport infrastructure maintenance fund for the long-term sustainability of infrastructure \nassets. During project implementation, discussions with the Ministry of Finance and Economic \nManagement will take place to ensure the asset register and asset maintenance plan will \nprovide  the  necessary  information,  and  to  ensure  that  recurrent  budget  funding  for  the \nmaintenance  of  newly  constructed  and  repaired  assets  is  allocated  as  part  of  the  budget \nprocess. \n \n                                                \n25 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nC.  Governance \n \n33.  A financial management assessment was completed as part of the current project.26 The \nassessment concluded that the overall inherent risk and overall control risk were moderate, and \nproposed a number of risk mitigating measures. Since 2011, VPMU has the responsibility to \nmanage  project  funds  and  report  to  financing  partners.  VPMU  is  adequately  staffed  with \nqualified finance personnel and has appropriate financial management systems and reporting \nmechanisms. The project financial management arrangements established by the government \nthrough the Department of Finance and Treasury, and VPMU under the oversight of the VPMU-\nSC,  are  considered  to  be  operating  effectively,  and  no  change  to  those  arrangements  is \nproposed.  The  main  governance-related  risks,  with  an  emphasis  on  public  financial \nmanagement and procurement, have been updated.27 \n \n34.  A risk assessment and risk management plan was prepared for the current project. The \nassessment  concluded that  procurement  and  corruption  risks  are  high,  however  mitigation \nmeasures are proposed. In addition, a report concluded that procurement remains a key area of \nconcern, in particular the ability of the government to ensure that its procurement policies are \nfollowed in an equitable, efficient, and transparent manner.28 While the report identified an \nimprovement in the availability of information on procurement activities, the government is \naddressing procurement concerns with financial support from the Government of Australia. \nVanuatu\u2019s score on the World Bank\u2019s governance indicator for control of corruption was +0.45 in \n2012, which placed it in the top third for effective control of corruption. Vanuatu is the highest \nranking country in the Pacific, excluding Australia and New Zealand.29 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government under \nthe current project and will continue to apply. Specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n35.  The  additional  financing  does  not  include  any  additional  works  involving  issues  of \ninvoluntary settlement, indigenous peoples, and gender. All civil works under the additional \nfinancing will be undertaken at locations that have already been identified and subject to access \narrangements  prepared  under  the  current  project.  The  resettlement  framework  has  been \nupdated.30 Additional documentation on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples is not \nrequired for the project. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the project has \nbeen updated.31 \n  \n36.  The improvement in shipping services for remote rural communities will greatly enhance \naccess to essential social services and market opportunities, especially for women. The project \nincludes specific features to accommodate women\u2019s needs in constructed or repaired wharves, \nas well as to meet women\u2019s demands for shipping services. The project is proposed for effective \ngender mainstreaming. The GAP and its indicators in the design and monitoring framework \nunder the current project remain unchanged and will be applied to the project. \n \n                                                \n26 ADB. 2011.

Safeguards \n \n37.  The project is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \nThe project is environment category B. Except for Simonsen wharf, the design modifications of \nthe  wharves  and  jetties  will  not  result  in  any  environmental  impacts  different  from  those \ndescribed in the approved IEEs because (i) the location and footprint for each wharf remains the \nsame; (ii) the increased depth of piles would not create any different impacts from those already \nidentified  and  for  which  mitigations  are  proposed;  and  (iii)  the  transportation  of  plant  and \nmaterial, and approximate period of the works (3\u20136 months at each site) will remain the same. \nAny modifications to wharf designs will be updated in the EMPs and the updated EMPs will be \nincluded in the bid documents. The project now includes (i) construction of Simonsen wharf \ninstead of rehabilitation at the same location, and (ii) a dredged channel in South Paray bay \n(para. 19). The IEE of Simonsen wharf and proposed dredging of the channel will be prepared \nas  outlined  in  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  from  the  additional \nfinancing funds to comply with Vanuatu laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nincluding clearance by ADB and the Department of Environment Protection and Conservation. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n38.  The project risks will continue to be managed through mechanisms established under \nthe current project to ensure that ADB procedures on consultant recruitment, procurement, and \ndisbursement are closely followed and project financial accounts are audited. The updated risk \nassessment and risk management plan will be followed. No additional risks are identified.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n39.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the \nupdated PAM and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR12,600,000 to the Republic of \nVanuatu for the additional financing of the Interisland Shipping Support Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; for a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$4,650,000  to  the  Republic  of  Vanuatu  for  the  additional  financing  of  the \nInterisland  Shipping  Support  Project,  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of \nNew Zealand. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n4 February 2015", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nDesign Summary  Baselines  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nImpact      Assumptions \nCurrent project  Current project    Private sector operators \nPeople throughout  3% annual growth in  Baseline survey and  continue to respond to \nVanuatu have improved  cargo and passenger  monitoring surveys at  opportunities \naccess to socioeconomic  volumes from rural  inception, midterm, and   \nopportunities.  areas by 2020  completion  Sufficient incentives for \n(Baselines: Cargo    rural agriculture to grow \nbaseline is 65,000 tons  SSS voyage reports  in response to services \nper annum in 2010,     \npassenger baseline will    Risks \nbe established during   \nDeterioration in \nimplementation)   \ndomestic and external \n   \neconomic conditions \nWomen in rural areas  Government \nconstraining growth and \nestablish markets at  socioeconomic \ndevelopment \nmore than half of the  monitoring reports \n \nproject jetties and \nInefficient franchise \nwharves by 2018 \nmanagement could \n(2010 baseline: 0) \naffect service provision \n \nOverall project  Overall project     \nUnchanged  Unchanged \nOutcome      Assumptions \nCurrent project  Current project     \nPrivate sector operators  Sailing schedules to all  Maritime regulatory  Continued political \nprovide interisland  islands are published  authority reports  stability and support \nshipping services that are  and 90% of vessel calls     \nreliable, safe, and  are delivered without  Reports from provincial  Private sector operators \nadequately frequent.  cancellations or delays  shipping coordinators  respond to opportunities \ngreater than 24 hours by     \n2017.     \n(2010 baseline: about    Risks \n50%)   \n \n   \nInefficient franchise \nAll vessels in Vanuatu  Reports from the \nmanagement could affect \ncomply with national  Vanuatu Maritime \nservice provision \nsafety regulations by  Safety Administration \n2017   \n(2008 baseline: about   \n50%)   \n   \nMain population centers  SSS voyage reports \nin project areas receive a \nvessel call at least once \nevery 2 months. \n(2010 baseline: at least \nonce every 3 months) \n \nOverall project  Overall project     \nUnchanged  Unchanged \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nDesign Summary  Baselines  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nOutputs      Assumption \nCurrent project  Current project     \n1.
