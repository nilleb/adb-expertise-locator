THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Horticulture Value Chain Development Sector \nProject. \n \n2.  The proposed project will help strengthen the horticulture value chain in Afghanistan by (i) \nimproving  the  processing  efficiency  and  marketing  capacity  of  domestic  agro-business \nenterprises (ABEs); (ii) modernizing crop production through better planting material, trellising, \nmodern  greenhouses,  and  on-farm  facilities;  and  (iii)  contributing  to  the  national  effort  in \nestablishing internationally recognized brands of Afghan horticultural produce. It will increase \nvalue addition for horticultural commodities produced in 11 provinces in the central, southern, and \neastern parts of Afghanistan.1 As such, the project will contribute to increasing the supply of fresh \nand processed fruit and vegetables, and expanding exports of high-value fruit, vegetables, and \nnuts in which the country has a comparative advantage.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector performance. Afghanistan is one of the least-developed countries in the world. In \n2016, its poverty rate was 55%, while 44% of inhabitants were considered food insecure.3 \nBetween 2011 and 2016, the average annual per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was $630, \nranking Afghanistan 168th of the 183 countries reported by the World Bank.4 Agriculture is \nAfghanistan\u2019s major source of livelihood, employing 62.2% of the national workforce of 10.9 \nmillion people in 2017 and contributing 21.9% of the national GDP, with sector value addition of \n$4.1 billion in 2016.5 Historically, the sector was a significant source of foreign exchange because \nof the country\u2019s unique agro-climatic conditions. Of the total export earnings of $771 million in \n2016, export earnings from agriculture were $375 million, accounting for 48.6%. Export earnings \nfrom fruit and vegetables alone amounted to $331 million (42.9% of total exports).6 \n \n4.  Within the agriculture sector, the horticulture subsector has been a major contributor \nthrough the production of a wide array of crops, unique varieties, and an extended range of \nmaturity periods, providing a strong comparative advantage in export markets. In 2016, licit \nhorticulture crops were grown on 360,000 hectares (ha) that included 14% of the total irrigated \narea and generated $1.4 billion equivalent annually, representing 34% of agriculture GDP. Labor \nrequirements for production and harvesting are the equivalent of 200,000 full-time equivalent jobs \n                                                \n1  Project provinces are Bamyan, Ghazni, Kabul, Khost, Kunar, Laghman, Logar, Nangahar, Paktika, Paktya, and \nWardak. Kandahar has great potential as a project province and may be included after year 1 of project \nimplementation subject to a review of the security situation, demand for subproject investment, and appropriate \nimplementation arrangements. These provinces were selected based on production area and output for fruit and \nvegetables. Together, these provinces account for 26% of the national planted area of fruit, 21% of the national area \nof vegetables, and 22% of the national horticulture production output. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017.

", "2 \n(seasonal income for about 2 million people). Many horticulture crops provide a good source of \nrevenue for commercial farmers compared with alternative crops to the extent that they are widely \npromoted by the government and development partners as an alternative to poppy cultivation. \n \n5.  Grapes generated the greatest income of any crop with nearly $150 million for fresh \ngrapes and $280 million for raisins in 2016. Almonds generated $120 million, while pomegranates \ngenerated $100 million in that year. About one-third of Afghanistan\u2019s horticulture crops are \nexported, primarily to India and Pakistan, although significant quantities of raisins are exported to \nthe Russian Federation, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, and central Asian countries. Vegetable \nproduction also contributes significantly to horticulture GDP (estimated at $475 million per annum) \nbut remains highly seasonal. During the off-season, the country relies on imported vegetables\u2014\nparticularly onions, potatoes, and tomatoes\u2014from neighboring India and Pakistan. \n \n6.  Binding constraints. Growth in the horticulture subsector is constrained by a large \nnumber of small-scale producers that are geographically scattered. On-farm productivity is low \nand post-harvest losses are high because of (i) limited access to water largely because of \ndilapidated irrigation infrastructure and lack of on-farm distribution and application systems; (ii) \nold orchards with low-productivity varieties; (iii) limited access to quality production inputs, \nincluding planting material but also fertilizers and agro-chemicals for pest and disease control; \n(iv) a predominance of traditional production technologies; (v) lack of access to finance to \nmodernize  production  systems  and  processing  for  value  addition;  (vi)  absence  of  national \ncertification and/or branding strategies for horticultural produce, particularly outside the traditional \nexport markets of India and Pakistan; and (vii) insecure land tenure, which discourages farmers \nto invest in on-farm facilities and land improvement. Post-harvest losses for fruit and vegetables \nare in the range of 30%\u201360% of total production.7 The main causes include (i) lack of precooling \nfacilities, cold storage, refrigerated transport, and packhouse facilities; (ii) inadequate processing \nfacilities; (iii) poor transportation facilities and high transportation costs; and (iv) a lack of farmers' \nknowledge of good post-harvest practices. \n \n7.  The banking subsector in Afghanistan has a narrow base with weak governance and low \nintermediation and outreach. In 2017, the subsector consisted of 15 banks with total assets of \n$4.0 billion, customer deposits of $3.6 billion, and a gross loan portfolio of less than $0.7 billion. \nCredit to the private sector is low\u2014just 4% of GDP\u2014and the loan\u2013asset ratio is below 15%. Only \n2% of enterprises use bank loans to finance investments because (i) loan interest rates are \nextremely high (12%\u201320% per annum); and (ii) loans are mainly short term, with an average \nmaturity of 10 months. While there is a high demand for medium- and long-term loans, banks are \nnot able to extend loans of the same terms because of their lack of equivalent medium- and long-\nterm funding sources, and access to finance for individuals and enterprises is constrained by \nlimited branch networks. In this context, and given public mistrust of domestic banks since the \nKabul Bank collapse in 2010, project financing interventions through financial intermediation are \ncurrently not an appropriate choice. \n \n8.  Growth potential. Afghanistan currently exports some fruit and vegetables, yet there has \nbeen increasing dependence on seasonal imports of both fresh and processed horticultural \nproduce.  Imports  result  from  inadequate  domestic  supplies  because  of  limited  in-country \nprocessing,  post-harvest  handling,  and  appropriate  storage  to  stabilize  sources  of  supply \nthroughout the year and ease seasonal shortages. Production gains can be achieved through a \n                                                \n7  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Center for Alleviation of Poverty through \nSustainable Agriculture. 2018.

Total \nproduction could increase from 3.9 million tons per annum in 2017 to 5.0 million tons per annum \nby 2026. Together, these changes could lead to an annual GDP contribution of about $3.5 billion \nby 2026 (compared with $1.4 billion in 2016). This would add another 362,000 full-time equivalent \njobs by 2026\u2014around 267,000 in horticultural production and 95,000 in other economic activities \nalong the value chain. \n \n9.  The domestic demand is estimated at 0.9 million tons for fruit and 1.4 million tons for \nvegetables.8 In 2017, Afghanistan produced 3.9 million tons of horticultural produce (1.5 million \ntons of fruit and 2.4 million tons of vegetables). Of the surplus of 1.6 million tons of fruit and \nvegetables, an estimated 0.5 million tons were exported and the balance of 1.1 million tons might \nhave been post-harvest losses, while a small percentage is used for seeds. Over 85% of \nhorticultural produce is unprocessed, whether being marketed domestically or for export. \n \n10.  Government strategies. The key development strategy of the Ministry of Agriculture, \nIrrigation and Livestock (MAIL) is that the National Comprehensive Agriculture Development \nProgram 2016\u20132020 highlights horticulture value-chain development as one of its seven strategic \npillars.9 Under horticulture value-chain development pillar, the priorities are (i) expansion of the \nhorticultural land base; (ii) increase in crop productivity; (iii) development of value chains for \nselected crops, where the country has a high comparative advantage; (iv) infrastructure and \nmarket development; (v) promotion of standardization and certification; (vi) support to the private \nsector, (vii) development of crop nurseries through adaption research; and (viii) expansion of the \narea under conservation agriculture. \n \n11.  Development  partners  have  contributed  to  agriculture  sector  development  with  the \nhorticulture  and  irrigation  subsectors  being  the  main  beneficiaries.10 Ongoing World  Bank-\nfinanced projects include the National Horticulture and Livestock Project,11 the On-farm Water \nManagement Project,12 and the Afghanistan Agricultural Inputs Project,13 while the United States \nAgency for International Development financed the Commercial Horticulture and Agricultural \nMarketing Program14 and the European Union financed the MAIL Transition Project,15 each \naddressing various aspects in the horticulture subsector. Three Asian Development Bank (ADB)-\nfinanced projects\u2014the Rural Business Support Project,16 the Agriculture Market Infrastructure \nProject,17 and the Enhanced Agricultural Value Chains for Sustainable Livelihoods Project18\u2014\nhave  helped  promote  market  linkages  for  fruit  and  vegetables  while  enhancing  rural \n                                                \n8  Based on minimum per capita consumption of 0.11 kilograms of vegetables and 0.07 kilograms of fruit per day, and \nthe 2016 national population of 34.7 million. \n9  Government of Afghanistan, MAIL. 2016.

To enhance the intermediation function and efficiency of the banking subsector, \nin March 2018 the World Bank approved the $40 million Modernizing Afghan State-Owned Banks \nProject to help (i) strengthen corporate governance of state-owned banks, and (ii) support \ninstitutional  development  and  business  strategy  and  the  modernization  of  management \ninformation systems.19 \n \n12.  The project will support the National Comprehensive Agriculture Development Program \n2016\u20132020 (footnote 9) through both physical investments and capacity development to increase \nvalue addition along the horticulture value chain. It will complement and enhance the impacts of \npast and ongoing projects financed by ADB and development partners by promoting an integrated \nand  practical  approach  to  value  chain  development  in  high-impact  production  zones.  The \njudicious use of matching funds under the project will stimulate mobilization of private resources \nas ABE contributions reduce the risks associated with subproject investments and promote \nsustainability. The project design adopts a sector modality because of the clear development plan \nfor the sector and MAIL\u2019s experience in the implementation of other internationally financed \nprojects in horticulture, while the project will contribute to national polices in respect of quality \ncertification and applied research. The project meets the sector modality criteria as (i) the \ngovernment has a clear sector development plan to meet the priority development needs of the \nsector, (ii) MAIL has implemented a large number of similar sector projects and has adequate \ninstitutional capacity to implement the sector development plan, and (iii) the strategies and \npolicies applicable to the sector are appropriate and will be improved though the project\u2019s \napproaches to strengthening linkages between ABEs and producers. \n \n13.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project promotes business linkages between \nABEs  and  farmers  in  high-impact  production  zones,  and  is  expected  to  create  significant \neconomic opportunities for agribusiness development both vertically and horizontally. The project \nreflects lessons from past and ongoing sector projects financed by ADB and development \npartners. Key lessons call for the need to increase the government\u2019s ownership, avoid setting up \nparallel management structures, set up realistic implementation plans, keep interventions simple \nyet effective, and promote market linkages in a holistic manner addressing key farm\u2013market \nconstraints. The project follows the fragile and conflict-affected states approach in that it uses (i) \na sector modality, which allows flexibility in subproject selection and implementation given security \nconcerns;  and  (ii)  a  streamlined  project  management  structure,  which  helps  long-term \nprogrammatic  sector  interventions.  The  project\u2019s  readiness  is  enhanced  by  using  advance \nrecruitment and financing taxes on eligible project expenditures.20 \n \n14.  The project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132021 which \nsupports the government\u2019s strategic priorities, and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2017\u20132019.21 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s operational plan for agriculture \nand natural resources, 2015\u20132020 and ADB\u2019s water operational plan, 2011\u20132020. 22 \n \n   \n                                                \n19 World Bank. 2018.

Output 1: Horticulture value chain infrastructure and facilities improved. Two groups \nof subprojects are envisaged for project financing. First, eligible subprojects for ABEs will include \n(i)  precooling  rooms  (static  and  mobile);  (ii)  packhouse,  sorting,  or  grading  buildings  and \nequipment; (iii) storage (zero energy, cold storage, and controlled atmosphere) facilities; (iv) \nprocessing  equipment  and  machinery  to  expand  processing  capacity;  (v)  a  quality  control \naccredited laboratory; (vi) introduction of hazard analysis and critical control point and good \nmanufacturing practices into horticulture processing plants; and (vii) a tissue culture laboratory \n(potatoes, clonal rootstock, and micropropagation). Second, eligible subprojects for affiliated \nfarmers will include (i) modern greenhouses; (ii) planting material (potatoes and onions, tomato \nand cucumber hybrid seeds, clonal rootstock, and high-density certified saplings); (iii) trellising \n(for grapes and high-density orchards); (iv) on-farm storage for onions and potatoes; (v) on-farm \nprocessing, drying, and grading equipment; and (vi) on-farm water sources and distribution \nsystems (such as storage ponds, rainwater harvesting, and drip irrigation).24  \n \n17.  Output 2: National capacity for horticulture export expansion developed. Three \nareas have been identified for project support: (i) adaptive research to demonstrate the benefits \nfrom introduced varieties and modern production technologies and applying these under local \nconditions, (ii) the introduction of internationally recognized standards and certification to provide \nquality  assurance  to  buyers,  and  (iii) the  promotion  of  national  marketing  and/or  branding \nstrategies  for  uniquely  Afghan  horticultural  produce  so  as  to  establish  an  internationally \nrecognized brand with associated quality on higher-priced markets. This output will be achieved \nthrough the provision of resources for studies and institutional development combined with \ntechnical expertise for branding in a competitive commercial and/or international environment. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $118.66 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).25 \n \n19.  The sector modality is proposed for the project as it facilitates identification and financing \nof high-value subprojects on a demand-driven basis during implementation. The government has \nrequested a grant not exceeding $75.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) to help finance the project. The summary financing plan is in Table 2 and \nfurther detailed in the PAM (footnote 25). ADB will finance expenditure in relation to civil works, \nequipment and machinery, consulting services, and taxes and duties. 26 The ABEs will contribute \n                                                \n23 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n24 List of Candidate Subprojects and Estimated Demand (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB will finance taxes and duties estimated at 5%\u201310% of total project cost, which does not represent an excessive \nshare of the financing plan and is within applicable country partnership strategy parameters.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency and MAIL the implementing agency. \nA project management unit (PMU) and four regional project implementation units will be set up \nunder the existing structure of MAIL\u2019s Central Program Management Office to implement the \nproject. Implementation support consultants (ISC) will be recruited to assist the PMU for the entire \nimplementation period. A nongovernment organization will be engaged as the facilitation partner \nto assist with solicitation and consolidation of on-farm subproject proposals and facilitation of \nbusiness linkages between producers and ABEs. A subproject evaluation committee comprising \nindependent membership from various government agencies and the private sector will be set up \nto  assess  the  merits  of  subprojects  based  on  the  guidelines  for  evaluation  of  subproject \ninvestment proposals (SIPs), and make recommendations regarding candidate subprojects. \n \n21.  Two types of subprojects envisaged for project financing are ABE subprojects and on-\nfarm subprojects. The subproject selection, appraisal, and approval will be undertaken with the \nfollowing steps: (i) identify subprojects and solicit SIPs through public awareness campaigns; (ii) \nscreen SIPs based on the eligibility criteria; (iii) prepare subproject investment reports (SIRs) with \ndue diligence on technical, social, financial, economic, social and environmental safeguards, \nimplementation arrangements, and operation and maintenance (O&M); (iv) assess SIRs by \nsubproject evaluation committee based on the eligibility criteria and recommendations made to \naccept or reject candidate subprojects; (v) sign subproject agreements by MAIL\u2019s delegated \nauthority and subproject owners if SIRs pass the evaluation; and (vi) procure goods, works, and \n ", "7 \nservices in accordance with terms and conditions of the subproject agreements. This subproject \nselection, appraisal, and approval process will ensure that only subprojects of merit and high \nimpact will be selected for project grants, which will minimize risks of corruption and collusion. For \nABE subprojects, the project will promote private sector participation by requiring selected ABEs \nto contribute 50% of subproject costs and be responsible for subproject implementation under the \nguidance of the PMU and the ISC. ABEs will undertake the procurement on commercial practice \nto ensure that procured items are relevant to the ABEs\u2019 operational needs and the equipment \nand/or facilities are fully utilized and maintained. ABEs will be required to submit all invoices and \npayment evidences related to subproject costs in order to substantiate 50% of the project grant. \nIn this regard, financial management and funding risks will be minimized. For on-farm subprojects, \nthe PMU will undertake the procurement using framework agreements based on demand by \ngeography and type of goods, works, and services as consolidated by the facilitation partner. The \nentire subproject appraisal process and subsequent subproject implementation will be undertaken \nand/or supervised by the PMU with assistance of the ISC and the facilitation partner. The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM \n(footnote 25). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 January 2019\u201330 December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  30 December 2024 \nEstimated grant closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  MOF \n(ii)  Implementing agency  MAIL \n(iii) Implementation units  One PMU in MAIL\u2019s head office (under CPMO), and four regional PIUs \nlocated in the provinces of Bamyan, Ghazni, Nangarhar, and Paktya. \nTotal staff will be 76 in PMU and 80 in PIUs. \nProcurement  OCB  1 contract for vehicles for PMU  $250,000 \nFA  18 contracts using framework  $18.0 million \nagreements for on-farm subprojects \nCPP  49 contracts for on-farm subprojects  $3.4 million \nRFQ  6 contracts for PMU and PIU office  $245,000 \nequipment \nConsulting services  QCBS 90:10  1 contract with 334 person-months for  $3.64 million \nimplementation support consultants \nQCBS 90:10  1 contract (total 800 person-months) for  $2.44 million \nthe facilitation partner \nCQS  10 contracts  $1.3 million \nICS  2 contracts (10 person-months)  $130,000 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance recruitment action for implementation support consultant will \nadvance contracting  be required.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  The project is designed to ensure long-term sustainability. To maintain infrastructure and \nequipment throughout its economic life, various design and implementation support measures are \nincluded. For ABE investments, full feasibility studies will be prepared that will include detailed \nengineering designs of planned works prior to appraisal by the subproject evaluation committee. \nThese will require international standards to be adopted in the design of subproject works and \nfacilities. As a subproject eligibility criterion, ABEs are required to demonstrate and commit \nadequate financial resources for O&M of buildings, equipment, and machinery to be financed by \nthe project. For on-farm interventions, the project will provide capacity building to subproject \nowners in O&M of installed facilities and equipment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Project  benefits  are  multifaceted  and  include  increased  value  addition  for  Afghan \nhorticultural produce. First, the introduction of improved equipment and cold storage facilities will \nreduce losses by an estimated 30%\u201350%, adding to the economic benefit from the project.27 \nSecond, the increased availability of fruit and vegetables will minimize imports and increase \nexports  and  foreign  reserves.  The  increased  supply  of  quality  produce  will  enhance \ncompetitiveness in international markets. Third, increased economic opportunities will be created \nfor  upstream  (input  suppliers)  and  downstream  (processors  and  market  intermediaries) \nstakeholders. The analysis of two representative subprojects indicates that the investments are \nfinancially and economically viable. The calculated financial internal rates of return for these \nsubprojects are 19.3% and 19.5% as compared with the funding cost of 7.14%, and the economic \ninternal rates of return are 18.9% and 19.0%, well above the economic opportunity cost of capital \nof 9.0%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that both subproject cash flows are robust with respect \nto potentially adverse movements in revenue and cost streams.28 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  The overall premitigation financial management, procurement and funding risk is classified \nsubstantial.  Assessments  have  identified  risks  related  to  the  country's  public  financial \nmanagement  system  in  the  areas  of  internal  control,  procurement  management,  financial \nreporting, and external auditing.29 Action plans have been agreed with MAIL to strengthen its \nfinancial management. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nthe Ministry of Finance and MAIL. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25.  Poverty.

Incremental household income and jobs \ncreated, particularly for women in packing and processing premises, will significantly contribute \nto local poverty reduction. \n \n26.  Social  and  gender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. \nGender activities will be mainstreamed in the project.31 It will directly benefit ABEs and affiliated \nfarmers, including poor households within the project areas, through increases in agricultural \nproduction  and  farm  incomes.  Improved  access  to  water-efficient  on-farm  distribution  and \napplication systems, quality planting material, modern production systems, on-farm greenhouses, \nand storage facilities will allow farmers to access higher off-season prices for perishable produce \nand reduce income inequality. Women subproject owners will be specifically targeted to ensure \nthat they participate equally in access to grant funding. Supply contract arrangements between \nABEs and affiliated farmers will be developed, taking into account the special requirements of \nfarming households headed by women. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework and \ninitial environmental examinations for two representative subprojects were disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite in July 2018. Site-specific environmental impacts may occur in each of these subprojects \nduring the construction and operation phase. Adequate mitigation measures are included and will \nbe implemented through environmental management plans. ADB conducted public consultations \nfor  the  representative  subprojects  in  May  2018.  The  review  framework  ensures  project \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  by  specifying  environmental \nsafeguards procedures required for subprojects prepared during implementation. Each subproject \nwill be screened for environmental classification. Subprojects classified category A will not be \neligible. Category B subprojects will require an initial environmental examination, including an \nenvironmental  management  plan,  and  incorporation  of  environmental  management  plan \nmeasures  into  civil  works  contracts.  Category  C  subprojects  will  require  summaries  of \nenvironmental implications in their feasibility studies. Adequate resources have been allocated \nfor environmental safeguards preparation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting.32 \n \n28.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  Subproject  proposals  that  involve  land \nacquisition or lead to involuntary resettlement will not be considered. As a good practice, a \nresettlement  framework  was  prepared  to  guide  screening  of  subproject  selection  and \ndocumentation of subproject sites for involuntary resettlement due diligence. The resettlement \nframework  describes  the  measures  required  to  ensure  that  potential  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts are identified, avoided, reduced, and mitigated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and the laws and regulations of Afghanistan. The resettlement \nframework covers subproject screening, categorization, and preparation of social safeguard due \ndiligence  reports  for  each  category  C  subproject.  The  resettlement  framework  and  social \nsafeguard due diligence reports on two representative subprojects were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite in July 2018.33 \n \n                                                \n30 http://fews.net/central-asia/afghanistan/food-security-outlook/october-2017 (accessed 17 July 2017). \n31 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, and Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n29.
