It  will  increase \nvalue addition for horticultural commodities produced in 11 provinces in the central, southern, and \neastern parts of Afghanistan.1 As such, the project will contribute to increasing the supply of fresh \nand processed fruit and vegetables, and expanding exports of high-value fruit, vegetables, and \nnuts in which the country has a comparative advantage.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nSector performance. Afghanistan is one of the least-developed countries in the world. In \n3. \n2016,  its  poverty  rate  was  55%,  while  44%  of  inhabitants  were  considered  food  insecure. 3 \nBetween 2011 and 2016, the average annual per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was $630, \nranking  Afghanistan  168th  of  the  183  countries  reported  by  the  World  Bank. 4 Agriculture  is \nAfghanistan\u2019s  major  source  of  livelihood,  employing  62.2%  of  the  national  workforce  of  10.9 \nmillion people in 2017 and contributing 21.9% of the national GDP, with sector value addition of \n$4.1 billion in 2016.5 Historically, the sector was a significant source of foreign exchange because \nof the country\u2019s  unique agro-climatic  conditions.  Of the  total  export  earnings  of $771 million  in \n2016, export earnings from agriculture were $375 million, accounting for 48.6%. Export earnings \nfrom fruit and vegetables alone amounted to $331 million (42.9% of total exports).6 \n \n4. \nWithin  the  agriculture  sector,  the  horticulture  subsector  has  been  a  major  contributor \nthrough  the  production  of  a  wide  array  of  crops,  unique  varieties,  and  an  extended  range  of \nmaturity  periods,  providing  a  strong  comparative  advantage  in  export  markets.  In  2016,  licit \nhorticulture crops were grown on 360,000 hectares (ha) that included 14% of the total irrigated \narea and generated $1.4 billion equivalent annually, representing 34% of agriculture GDP. Labor \nrequirements for production and harvesting are the equivalent of 200,000 full-time equivalent jobs \n\n                                                 \n1  Project  provinces  are  Bamyan,  Ghazni,  Kabul,  Khost,  Kunar,  Laghman,  Logar,  Nangahar,  Paktika,  Paktya,  and \nWardak.  Kandahar  has  great  potential  as  a  project  province  and  may  be  included  after  year  1  of  project \nimplementation  subject  to  a  review  of  the  security  situation,  demand  for  subproject  investment,  and  appropriate \nimplementation  arrangements.  These  provinces  were selected  based  on  production  area and  output  for  fruit  and \nvegetables. Together, these provinces account for 26% of the national planted area of fruit, 21% of the national area \nof vegetables, and 22% of the national horticulture production output. \n\n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017.

Many horticulture crops provide a good source of \nrevenue for commercial farmers compared with alternative crops to the extent that they are widely \npromoted by the government and development partners as an alternative to poppy cultivation. \n \nGrapes  generated  the  greatest  income  of  any  crop  with  nearly  $150  million  for  fresh \n5. \ngrapes and $280 million for raisins in 2016. Almonds generated $120 million, while pomegranates \ngenerated  $100  million  in  that  year.  About  one-third  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  horticulture  crops  are \nexported, primarily to India and Pakistan, although significant quantities of raisins are exported to \nthe Russian Federation, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, and central Asian countries. Vegetable \nproduction also contributes significantly to horticulture GDP (estimated at $475 million per annum) \nbut remains highly seasonal. During the off-season, the country relies on imported vegetables\u2014\nparticularly onions, potatoes, and tomatoes\u2014from neighboring India and Pakistan. \n \n6. \nBinding  constraints.  Growth  in  the  horticulture  subsector  is  constrained  by  a  large \nnumber of small-scale producers that are geographically scattered. On-farm productivity is low \nand  post-harvest  losses  are  high  because  of  (i)  limited  access  to  water  largely  because  of \ndilapidated irrigation infrastructure and lack of on-farm distribution and application systems; (ii) \nold  orchards  with  low-productivity  varieties;  (iii)  limited  access  to  quality  production  inputs, \nincluding planting material but also fertilizers and agro-chemicals for pest and disease control; \n(iv)  a  predominance  of  traditional  production  technologies;  (v)  lack  of  access  to  finance  to \nmodernize  production  systems  and  processing  for  value  addition;  (vi)  absence  of  national \ncertification and/or branding strategies for horticultural produce, particularly outside the traditional \nexport markets of India and Pakistan; and (vii) insecure land tenure, which discourages farmers \nto invest in on-farm facilities and land improvement. Post-harvest losses for fruit and vegetables \nare in the range of 30%\u201360% of total production.7 The main causes include (i) lack of precooling \nfacilities, cold storage, refrigerated transport, and packhouse facilities; (ii) inadequate processing \nfacilities; (iii) poor transportation facilities and high transportation costs; and (iv) a lack of farmers' \nknowledge of good post-harvest practices. \n \n7. \nThe banking subsector in Afghanistan has a narrow base with weak governance and low \nintermediation and outreach. In 2017, the subsector consisted of 15 banks with total assets of \n$4.0 billion, customer deposits of $3.6 billion, and a gross loan portfolio of less than $0.7 billion. \nCredit to the private sector is low\u2014just 4% of GDP\u2014and the loan\u2013asset ratio is below 15%. Only \n2%  of  enterprises  use  bank  loans  to  finance  investments  because  (i)  loan  interest  rates  are \nextremely  high  (12%\u201320%  per  annum);  and  (ii)  loans  are  mainly  short  term,  with  an  average \nmaturity of 10 months. While there is a high demand for medium- and long-term loans, banks are \nnot able to extend loans of the same terms because of their lack of equivalent medium- and long-\nterm  funding  sources,  and  access  to  finance  for  individuals  and  enterprises  is  constrained  by \nlimited branch networks. In this context, and given public mistrust of domestic banks since the \nKabul Bank collapse in 2010, project financing interventions through financial intermediation are \ncurrently not an appropriate choice. \n \n8. \nGrowth potential. Afghanistan currently exports some fruit and vegetables, yet there has \nbeen  increasing  dependence  on  seasonal  imports  of  both  fresh  and  processed  horticultural \nproduce.  Imports  result  from  inadequate  domestic  supplies  because  of  limited  in-country \nprocessing,  post-harvest  handling,  and  appropriate  storage  to  stabilize  sources  of  supply \nthroughout the year and ease seasonal shortages. Production gains can be achieved through a \n\n                                                 \n7  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Center for Alleviation of Poverty through \nSustainable  Agriculture.  2018.  Post-harvest  Losses  of  Vegetables  in  South  Asia.  http://uncapsa.org/?q=palawija-\narticles/post-harvest-losses-vegetables-south-asia (accessed 6 May 2018). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\freduction  in  post-harvest  handling  and  storage  losses  and  increased  production  output.  Total \nproduction could increase from 3.9 million tons per annum in 2017 to 5.0 million tons per annum \nby 2026. Together, these changes could lead to an annual GDP contribution of about $3.5 billion \nby 2026 (compared with $1.4 billion in 2016). This would add another 362,000 full-time equivalent \njobs by 2026\u2014around 267,000 in horticultural production and 95,000 in other economic activities \nalong the value chain. \n \n9. \nThe  domestic  demand  is  estimated  at  0.9  million  tons  for  fruit  and  1.4  million  tons  for \nvegetables.8 In 2017, Afghanistan produced 3.9 million tons of horticultural produce (1.5 million \ntons  of  fruit  and  2.4  million  tons  of  vegetables).  Of  the  surplus  of  1.6  million  tons  of  fruit  and \nvegetables, an estimated 0.5 million tons were exported and the balance of 1.1 million tons might \nhave  been  post-harvest  losses,  while  a  small  percentage  is  used  for  seeds.  Over  85%  of \nhorticultural produce is unprocessed, whether being marketed domestically or for export. \n \n10. \nGovernment  strategies.  The  key  development  strategy  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, \nIrrigation  and  Livestock  (MAIL)  is  that  the  National  Comprehensive  Agriculture  Development \nProgram 2016\u20132020 highlights horticulture value-chain development as one of its seven strategic \npillars.9 Under horticulture value-chain development pillar, the priorities are (i) expansion of the \nhorticultural  land  base;  (ii)  increase  in  crop  productivity;  (iii)  development  of  value  chains  for \nselected  crops,  where  the  country  has  a  high  comparative  advantage;  (iv)  infrastructure  and \nmarket development; (v) promotion of standardization and certification; (vi) support to the private \nsector, (vii) development of crop nurseries through adaption research; and (viii) expansion of the \narea under conservation agriculture. \n \nDevelopment  partners  have  contributed  to  agriculture  sector  development  with  the \n11. \nhorticulture  and  irrigation  subsectors  being  the  main  beneficiaries. 10  Ongoing  World  Bank-\nfinanced  projects  include  the  National  Horticulture  and  Livestock  Project,11 the  On-farm Water \nManagement Project,12 and the Afghanistan Agricultural Inputs Project,13 while the United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  financed  the  Commercial  Horticulture  and  Agricultural \nMarketing  Program 14 and  the  European  Union  financed  the  MAIL  Transition  Project, 15 each \naddressing various aspects in the horticulture subsector.

To enhance the intermediation function and efficiency of the banking subsector, \nin March 2018 the World Bank approved the $40 million Modernizing Afghan State-Owned Banks \nProject  to  help  (i)  strengthen  corporate  governance  of  state-owned  banks,  and  (ii)  support \ninstitutional  development  and  business  strategy  and  the  modernization  of  management \ninformation systems.19 \n \n12. \nThe project will support the National Comprehensive Agriculture Development Program \n2016\u20132020 (footnote 9) through both physical investments and capacity development to increase \nvalue addition along the horticulture value chain. It will complement and enhance the impacts of \npast and ongoing projects financed by ADB and development partners by promoting an integrated \nand  practical  approach  to  value  chain  development  in  high-impact  production  zones.  The \njudicious use of matching funds under the project will stimulate mobilization of private resources \nas  ABE  contributions  reduce  the  risks  associated  with  subproject  investments  and  promote \nsustainability. The project design adopts a sector modality because of the clear development plan \nfor  the  sector  and  MAIL\u2019s  experience  in  the  implementation  of  other  internationally  financed \nprojects  in  horticulture,  while  the  project  will  contribute  to  national  polices  in  respect  of  quality \ncertification  and  applied  research.  The  project  meets  the  sector  modality  criteria  as  (i)  the \ngovernment has a clear sector development plan to meet the priority development needs of the \nsector,  (ii)  MAIL  has  implemented  a  large  number  of similar  sector  projects  and  has  adequate \ninstitutional  capacity  to  implement  the  sector  development  plan,  and  (iii)  the  strategies  and \npolicies  applicable  to  the  sector  are  appropriate  and  will  be  improved  though  the  project\u2019s \napproaches to strengthening linkages between ABEs and producers. \n \n13. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  project  promotes  business  linkages  between \nABEs  and  farmers  in  high-impact  production  zones,  and  is  expected  to  create  significant \neconomic opportunities for agribusiness development both vertically and horizontally. The project \nreflects  lessons  from  past  and  ongoing  sector  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  development \npartners. Key lessons call for the need to increase the government\u2019s ownership, avoid setting up \nparallel management structures, set up realistic implementation plans, keep interventions simple \nyet  effective,  and  promote  market  linkages  in  a  holistic  manner  addressing  key  farm\u2013market \nconstraints. The project follows the fragile and conflict-affected states approach in that it uses (i) \na sector modality, which allows flexibility in subproject selection and implementation given security \nconcerns;  and  (ii)  a  streamlined  project  management  structure,  which  helps  long-term \nprogrammatic  sector  interventions.  The  project\u2019s  readiness  is  enhanced  by  using  advance \nrecruitment and financing taxes on eligible project expenditures.20 \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132021  which \n14. \nsupports  the  government\u2019s  strategic  priorities,  and  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations \nbusiness  plan,  2017\u20132019.21 The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  plan  for  agriculture \nand natural resources, 2015\u20132020 and ADB\u2019s water operational plan, 2011\u20132020. 22 \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n19 World Bank. 2018.

The project will have the following outcome: increased production and value \naddition of horticultural products. 23 \n \nC. \n \nOutput 1: Horticulture value chain infrastructure and facilities improved. Two groups \n16. \nof subprojects are envisaged for project financing. First, eligible subprojects for ABEs will include \n(i)  precooling  rooms  (static  and  mobile);  (ii)  packhouse,  sorting,  or  grading  buildings  and \nequipment;  (iii)  storage  (zero  energy,  cold  storage,  and  controlled  atmosphere)  facilities;  (iv) \nprocessing  equipment  and  machinery  to  expand  processing  capacity;  (v)  a  quality  control \naccredited  laboratory;  (vi)  introduction  of  hazard  analysis  and  critical  control  point  and  good \nmanufacturing practices into horticulture processing plants; and (vii) a tissue culture laboratory \n(potatoes,  clonal  rootstock,  and  micropropagation).  Second,  eligible  subprojects  for  affiliated \nfarmers will include (i) modern greenhouses; (ii) planting material (potatoes and onions, tomato \nand cucumber hybrid seeds, clonal rootstock, and high-density certified saplings); (iii) trellising \n(for grapes and high-density orchards); (iv) on-farm storage for onions and potatoes; (v) on-farm \nprocessing,  drying,  and  grading  equipment;  and  (vi)  on-farm  water  sources  and  distribution \nsystems (such as storage ponds, rainwater harvesting, and drip irrigation).24  \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  National  capacity  for  horticulture  export  expansion  developed.  Three \nareas have been identified for project support: (i) adaptive research to demonstrate the benefits \nfrom  introduced  varieties  and  modern  production  technologies  and  applying  these  under  local \nconditions, (ii) the introduction of internationally recognized standards and certification to provide \nquality  assurance  to  buyers,  and  (iii)  the  promotion  of  national  marketing  and/or  branding \nstrategies  for  uniquely  Afghan  horticultural  produce  so  as  to  establish  an  internationally \nrecognized brand with associated quality on higher-priced markets. This output will be achieved \nthrough  the  provision  of  resources  for  studies  and  institutional  development  combined  with \ntechnical expertise for branding in a competitive commercial and/or international environment. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $118.66  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).25 \n \n19. \nThe sector modality is proposed for the project as it facilitates identification and financing \nof high-value subprojects on a demand-driven basis during implementation. The government has \nrequested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $75.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) to help finance the project. The summary financing plan is in Table 2 and \nfurther detailed in the PAM (footnote 25).

Implementation support consultants (ISC) will be recruited to assist the PMU for the entire \nimplementation period. A nongovernment organization will be engaged as the facilitation partner \nto  assist  with  solicitation  and  consolidation  of  on-farm  subproject  proposals  and  facilitation  of \nbusiness linkages between producers and ABEs. A subproject evaluation committee comprising \nindependent membership from various government agencies and the private sector will be set up \nto  assess  the  merits  of  subprojects  based  on  the  guidelines  for  evaluation  of  subproject \ninvestment proposals (SIPs), and make recommendations regarding candidate subprojects. \n \n21. \nTwo  types  of  subprojects  envisaged  for  project  financing  are  ABE  subprojects  and  on-\nfarm subprojects. The subproject selection, appraisal, and approval will be undertaken with the \nfollowing steps: (i) identify subprojects and solicit SIPs through public awareness campaigns; (ii) \nscreen SIPs based on the eligibility criteria; (iii) prepare subproject investment reports (SIRs) with \ndue  diligence  on  technical,  social,  financial,  economic,  social  and  environmental  safeguards, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M);  (iv)  assess  SIRs  by \nsubproject evaluation committee based on the eligibility criteria and recommendations made to \naccept  or  reject  candidate  subprojects;  (v)  sign  subproject  agreements  by  MAIL\u2019s  delegated \nauthority and subproject owners if SIRs pass the evaluation; and (vi) procure goods, works, and \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fservices in accordance with terms and conditions of the subproject agreements. This subproject \nselection,  appraisal,  and  approval  process  will  ensure  that  only  subprojects  of  merit  and  high \nimpact will be selected for project grants, which will minimize risks of corruption and collusion. For \nABE subprojects, the project will promote private sector participation by requiring selected ABEs \nto contribute 50% of subproject costs and be responsible for subproject implementation under the \nguidance of the PMU and the ISC. ABEs will undertake the procurement on commercial practice \nto  ensure  that  procured items  are relevant  to the  ABEs\u2019  operational  needs  and  the  equipment \nand/or facilities are fully utilized and maintained. ABEs will be required to submit all invoices and \npayment evidences related to subproject costs in order to substantiate 50% of the project grant. \nIn this regard, financial management and funding risks will be minimized. For on-farm subprojects, \nthe  PMU  will  undertake  the  procurement  using  framework  agreements  based  on  demand  by \ngeography and type of goods, works, and services as consolidated by the facilitation partner. The \nentire subproject appraisal process and subsequent subproject implementation will be undertaken \nand/or  supervised  by  the  PMU  with  assistance  of  the  ISC  and  the  facilitation  partner.  The \nimplementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 25). \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nEstimated grant closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n\nArrangements \n1 January 2019\u201330 December 2024 \n30 December 2024 \n\n(i)  Executing agency \nMOF \n(ii)  Implementing agency  MAIL \n(iii)  Implementation units \n\nProcurement \n\nOne PMU in MAIL\u2019s head office (under CPMO), and four regional PIUs \nlocated in the provinces of Bamyan, Ghazni, Nangarhar, and Paktya. \nTotal staff will be 76 in PMU and 80 in PIUs. \nOCB \nFA \n\n$250,000 \n$18.0 million \n\nCPP \nRFQ \n\n$3.4 million \n$245,000 \n\n1 contract for vehicles for PMU \n18 contracts using framework \nagreements for on-farm subprojects \n49 contracts for on-farm subprojects \n6 contracts for PMU and PIU office \nequipment \n\nimplementation support consultants \n\nQCBS 90:10  1 contract (total 800 person-months) for \n\n$2.44 million \n\nthe facilitation partner \n10 contracts \n2 contracts (10 person-months) \n\n$1.3 million \nCQS \nICS \n$130,000 \nAdvance recruitment action for implementation support consultant will \nbe required.

To maintain infrastructure and \n22. \nequipment throughout its economic life, various design and implementation support measures are \nincluded. For ABE investments, full feasibility studies will be prepared that will include detailed \nengineering designs of planned works prior to appraisal by the subproject evaluation committee. \nThese will require international standards to be adopted in the design of subproject works and \nfacilities.  As  a  subproject  eligibility  criterion,  ABEs  are  required  to  demonstrate  and  commit \nadequate financial resources for O&M of buildings, equipment, and machinery to be financed by \nthe  project.  For  on-farm  interventions,  the  project  will  provide  capacity  building  to  subproject \nowners in O&M of installed facilities and equipment. \n \nB. \n \nProject  benefits  are  multifaceted  and  include  increased  value  addition  for  Afghan \n23. \nhorticultural produce. First, the introduction of improved equipment and cold storage facilities will \nreduce  losses  by  an  estimated  30%\u201350%,  adding  to  the  economic  benefit  from  the  project.27 \nSecond,  the  increased  availability  of  fruit  and  vegetables  will  minimize  imports  and  increase \nexports  and  foreign  reserves.  The  increased  supply  of  quality  produce  will  enhance \ncompetitiveness in international markets. Third, increased economic opportunities will be created \nfor  upstream  (input  suppliers)  and  downstream  (processors  and  market  intermediaries) \nstakeholders. The analysis of two representative subprojects indicates that the investments are \nfinancially  and  economically  viable.  The  calculated  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  these \nsubprojects are 19.3% and 19.5% as compared with the funding cost of 7.14%, and the economic \ninternal rates of return are 18.9% and 19.0%, well above the economic opportunity cost of capital \nof 9.0%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that both subproject cash flows are robust with respect \nto potentially adverse movements in revenue and cost streams.28 \n \nC. \n \nThe overall premitigation financial management, procurement and funding risk is classified \n24. \nsubstantial.  Assessments  have  identified  risks  related  to  the  country's  public  financial \nmanagement  system  in  the  areas  of  internal  control,  procurement  management,  financial \nreporting,  and  external  auditing.29 Action  plans  have  been  agreed  with  MAIL  to  strengthen  its \nfinancial management.

The project will benefit ABEs and their affiliated farmers in the project areas that \ninclude low-income and marginal farmers (with household landholdings of 1\u20132 ha). The project \nprovinces  (footnote  1)  belong  to  the  highest  food  insecurity  category,  ranging  from  \u201cstress\u201d  to \n                                                 \n27 The project may incur climate change mitigation benefits. However, since subproject financing is demand-driven, an \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nGovernance \n\ninventory of climate finance scale and associated benefits will be revisited during the project mid-term review.  \n\n28 Financial  and  Economic  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).

Incremental  household  income  and  jobs \ncreated, particularly for women in packing and processing premises, will significantly contribute \nto local poverty reduction. \n \n26. \nSocial  and  gender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. \nGender activities will be mainstreamed in the project.31 It will directly benefit ABEs and affiliated \nfarmers,  including  poor  households  within  the  project  areas,  through  increases  in  agricultural \nproduction  and  farm  incomes.  Improved  access  to  water-efficient  on-farm  distribution  and \napplication systems, quality planting material, modern production systems, on-farm greenhouses, \nand storage facilities will allow farmers to access higher off-season prices for perishable produce \nand reduce income inequality. Women subproject owners will be specifically targeted to ensure \nthat they participate equally in access to grant funding. Supply contract arrangements between \nABEs  and  affiliated farmers  will  be  developed,  taking  into  account the  special  requirements  of \nfarming households headed by women. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and \ninitial environmental examinations for two representative subprojects were disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite in July 2018. Site-specific environmental impacts may occur in each of these subprojects \nduring the construction and operation phase. Adequate mitigation measures are included and will \nbe implemented through environmental management plans. ADB conducted public consultations \nfor  the  representative  subprojects  in  May  2018.  The  review  framework  ensures  project \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  by  specifying  environmental \nsafeguards procedures required for subprojects prepared during implementation. Each subproject \nwill  be  screened  for  environmental  classification.  Subprojects  classified  category  A  will  not  be \neligible.  Category  B  subprojects  will  require  an  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an \nenvironmental  management  plan,  and  incorporation  of  environmental  management  plan \nmeasures  into  civil  works  contracts.  Category  C  subprojects  will  require  summaries  of \nenvironmental implications in their feasibility studies. Adequate resources have been allocated \nfor environmental safeguards preparation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting.32 \n \n28. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  Subproject  proposals  that  involve  land \nacquisition  or  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement  will  not  be  considered.  As  a  good  practice,  a \nresettlement  framework  was  prepared  to  guide  screening  of  subproject  selection  and \ndocumentation  of  subproject  sites  for  involuntary  resettlement  due  diligence.  The  resettlement \nframework  describes  the  measures  required  to  ensure  that  potential  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts are identified, avoided, reduced, and mitigated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  laws  and  regulations  of  Afghanistan.  The  resettlement \nframework covers subproject screening, categorization, and preparation of social safeguard due \ndiligence  reports  for  each  category  C  subproject.  The  resettlement  framework  and  social \nsafeguard due diligence reports on two representative subprojects were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite in July 2018.33 \n \n                                                 \n30 http://fews.net/central-asia/afghanistan/food-security-outlook/october-2017 (accessed 17 July 2017). \n31 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework, and Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n33 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C).
