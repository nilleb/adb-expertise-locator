It  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s strategies to make its cities more livable by providing better and more widespread \nwater services and reinforcing water security. The project will (i) construct new water transmission \ninfrastructure  from  the  existing  Ngamoeyeik  reservoir  to  the  existing  Nyaungnhapin  water \ntreatment  plant  (WTP),  including  an  intake  structure,  a  pumping  station,  and  a  bulk  water \nconveyance pipeline of about 34 kilometers (km) in length, to transfer about 818 million liters per \nday (MLD) of bulk water; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity of the Yangon City Development \nCommittee (YCDC) to operate and manage water services to reinforce the city\u2019s water supply. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  about  800,000  people.  While  the  project  was  envisioned  well \nbefore the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, it will make significant contributions to the \npandemic response by improving overall health and hygiene of the population of Yangon City.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMacroeconomic  context.  Myanmar  is  the  largest  country  in  mainland  Southeast  Asia \nwith an area of 676,577 square kilometers (km2)1 and a population of 54.05 million.2 It comprises \n15 states and regions with a total of 330 townships. About 30% of the population live in urban \nareas and the rest live in rural areas. In 2019, agriculture accounted for 21.3% of gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  value  added,  industry  contributed  38.0%,  and  services  40.7%.3  Urban  areas \ngenerate a disproportionate share of the value added, but there is a massive investment gap in \nthe development of water and other urban infrastructure (footnote 1). \n \n4. \nYangon Region comprises 45 townships with a population of about 7.36 million and an \narea  of  10,170  km2.  Yangon  City,  the  principal  economic  hub  of  Myanmar  and  the  capital  of \nYangon Region is made up of 33 townships and contains a population of about 5.20 million spread \nover an area of 895 km2. Yangon City\u2019s municipal services are managed by the YCDC.4 \n \n5. \nAs the country\u2019s largest city, Yangon represents about 10% of the national population and \n35%  of  the  country\u2019s  urban  population,  with  contribution  to  Myanmar\u2019s  GDP  at  about  23%.5 \nYangon City\u2019s population grew at 2.20% annually between 2014 and 2019, more than three times \nfaster  than  the  country\u2019s  total  annual  population  growth  of  0.67%  during  the  same  period \n(footnote 2). There is also a transitory population of about 400,000 living in and around the city\u2019s \nindustrial areas.6 \n \n6. \nSources of bulk water. The YCDC supplies about 932 MLD of water to its customers, \n90% of which is drawn from surface water sources. About 614 MLD of the total supply is from the \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2017.

Migration and Security Challenges in Yangon's Informal Settlements: \n\nThe Case of Hlaing Thayar Township. Copenhagen. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nNgamoeyeik reservoir, supplied through the Ngamoeyeik canal to the Nyaungnhapin WTP.7 In \nall,  the  Ngamoeyeik  reservoir  supplies  1,304  MLD  for  irrigation  purposes  and  614  MLD  for \ndrinking  water  purposes,  representing  a  combined  flow  of  1,918  MLD  after  accounting  for \nevaporation and seepage losses in the open and unlined canal. \n \n7. \nWater supply and scarcity. The YCDC serves all 33 townships of Yangon City, but in \npractice, each township\u2019s water supply is highly variable. With losses reported to be at least 60% \nof the total supply\u2014among the highest in Southeast Asia, less than half of the city\u2019s population \nreceive water through the YCDC\u2019s piped system.8 Those who receive service from the YCDC can \nonly expect an average water supply of 8 hours per day and experience frequent water supply \ninterruptions, with water pressure often only adequate late at night. Those without any service \nrely on private wells and/or water vendors, which cause added cost and inconvenience. However, \nthe heaviest burden is felt by the poor and vulnerable people and by women since inadequate \nprovision of potable water is common in areas where the poor live and they are obliged to spend \ntime to secure water for their basic needs.  \n \nWater  quality.  Aggravating  the  supply  constraints,  water  supplied  by  the  YCDC  is  not \n8. \nsuitable for drinking. About a third of the total YCDC piped water supply receives no treatment at \nall, among the highest in Southeast Asia. The remaining supply is not properly treated at all times. \nTreated  and  untreated  supplies  are  blended  in  the  distribution  network,  which  further  reduces \nwater quality to levels that pose a risk to human health.9 A very high percentage of water samples \nin Yangon City is found to be contaminated with thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms, with a potential \nto cause E. coli. Myanmar\u2019s poor health outcomes also highlight the urgency of improving urban \ninfrastructure, including for water supply. Between 2015 and 2020, Myanmar\u2019s mortality rate of \nchildren under 5 years of age was second highest in Southeast Asia, and the incidence of water \nborne diseases is quite high.10 \n \n9. \nWater  scarcity  and  impacts  on  personal  hygiene  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic. \nYangon City is subject to periods of water scarcity during the dry season. Given the strong water-\nsanitation-hygiene  linkage,  any  water  shortage  or  deterioration  in  water  quality  will  adversely \nimpact personal hygiene of Yangon City\u2019s communities, which could hamper efforts to battle the \nongoing  COVID-19  pandemic.  YCDC\u2019s  plan  to  enhance  water  security  and  water  quality  for \nYangon City is a practical response aligned with measures to arrest devastating health, social, \nand economic impacts of diseases including COVID-19.  \n \n\n \n\n7  The Nyaungnhapin WTP is Yangon City\u2019s only large-scale conventional WTP, while the other YCDC facilities are \nsmall-scale plants and stations. To address capacity and operational constraints of the existing Nyaungnhapin WTP, \nthe YCDC propose to refurbish and augment the WTP. This and other future projects by the YCDC will expand water \ndistribution coverage across Yangon City and will be supported by development partners. \n\n8  Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Immigration and Population. 2015. The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing \nCensus. Nay Pyi Taw. The 2014 Census showed that the water supply service coverage rate for Yangon City was \n35%. The YCDC has indicated that this level has increased to 40%\u201350% by early 2020, but datasets are not yet \navailable to substantiate this update. \n\n9  According to the Myanmar Living Conditions Survey, 2017 of the United Nations Development Programme, almost \n\n50% of Yangon City\u2019s population relied on bottled water for their drinking water needs.  \n\n10 Statista. \n\nrates \n\n2020. \n\nInfant \n\nmortality \n\nSoutheast \n\ncountry. \nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/590013/.  Only  about  9%  of  the  households  in  Yangon  City  have  access  to \nwastewater  management  services.  About  43%  of  households  have  septic  tanks,  and  the  others  discharge \nwastewater  into  local  drains  with  no  treatment,  creating  significant  odor  and  public  health  issues.  A  wastewater \ntreatment plant with capacity of 15 MLD constructed in 2005 currently receives only about 2.3 MLD of wastewater \nfrom the existing network (constructed in the 1880s). Septage collection is inadequate, because of an insufficient \nnumber of vacuum collection trucks. To address this lack of service by Yangon Region Government (YRG) and the \nYCDC, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will finance the Yangon Sewerage System Development \nProject. The JICA loan was signed in January 2020. \n\n2015-2020 \n\nAsia \n\nby \n\n\fGroundwater  overreliance.  By  2017,  Yangon  City  had  significant  industrial  activities, \n10. \nwhich placed further strain on the available water supply from the YCDC. As the YCDC is unable \nto fully serve industrial water customers, many factories use their own groundwater supply, which \ndepletes groundwater resources, causing subsidence.11 In areas where the YCDC\u2019s water service \nis inadequate or absent, household consumers also rely on groundwater from aquifers. \n \n11. \nImpacts  of  groundwater  depletion.  Yangon  City  is  situated  on  a  delta,  where  the \nexhaustion of groundwater is compounded by sea level rise. Saltwater intrusion in tube wells in \nareas  close  to  rivers  and  the  sea  is  widespread,  while  the  city\u2019s  geology,  primarily  meadow \nalluvium,  is  susceptible  to  sinking.12  This  increases  the  risk  of  subsidence  in  some  densely \npopulated  areas  and  inevitably  exposes  the  urban  poor,  who  live  in  dilapidated  housing  on \nmarginal, flood-prone land, to the greatest risk. Yangon City\u2019s dependence on groundwater must \nbe significantly reduced to avoid outright loss of dwindling groundwater supplies. \n \n12. \nConstraints in delivering bulk water to Yangon City. Bulk water from the Ngamoeyeik \nreservoir  to  Yangon  City\u2019s  Nyaungnhapin  WTP  is  currently  conveyed  through  the  36.3  km \nNgamoeyeik canal.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MOALI) owns the initial \n25.4 km of the canal and shares this section with the YCDC, and the YCDC owns the remaining \n10.9 km. MOALI provides water for irrigated agriculture for only 3 months of the year and performs \nmaintenance on the canal outside of this 3-month period. MOALI may also perform emergency \nmaintenance and repair works on the canal. Furthermore, as an open structure, the canal requires \nfrequent maintenance which can be accommodated only during extended periods with no water \nservice delivery. However, as the YCDC requires water 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, all year \nround,  MOALI  cannot  suspend  delivery  of  water  to  the  YCDC.  As  a  result,  necessary \nrefurbishments and repairs are deferred, or attempts are made to make repairs while the canal is \nin operation. The YCDC\u2019s dependency on MOALI for water transmission, while unavoidable in \nthe short-term due to the lack of any alternatives, prevents it from developing a sustainable, long-\nterm solution for ensuring reliable water supply to Yangon City.  \n \n13. \nNeed for secure and safe water transfer. The potential for intermittent bulk water supply \ncombined with a lack of direct operational control of the overall length of the Ngamoeyeik canal \nby the YCDC presents an unacceptable risk to the water security of Yangon City. The substantial \nwater loss due to evaporation and seepage in the open and unlined canal, coupled with ongoing \nbank  deterioration,  causes  significant  reduction  in  system  resilience.  Water  safety  cannot  be \nassured  if  the  open  canal  is  exposed  to  surface  water  runoff  including  from  industry,  which  is \nexpanding  to  areas  adjacent  to the  canal.  Unsafe  water  transferred to  the  WTP  will  stress the \ntreatment system and require higher treatment costs to supply potable water to Yangon City. \n \n14. \nClimate impacts. Projected climate change and temperature increases will lead to higher \nevaporation  rates.  More  frequent  and  stronger  cyclones  and  more  intense  precipitation  will \nincrease surface water runoff, exacerbating efforts to control pollution in the canal.13 As the YCDC \nestimates the city\u2019s water demand to be about 2,519 MLD by 2040, up from approximately 932 \nMLD in 2020, the overall resilience and robustness of the bulk water system will become even \nmore critical.  \n \n15. \nInstitutional arrangements. The YCDC is responsible for the delivery of water services \nin  Yangon  City.  Prior  to  2018,  the  YCDC\u2019s  Engineering  Department  (Water  and  Sanitation) \n(EDWS)  undertook  both  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  functions.  Under  the  Yangon  City \nMunicipal  Law  enacted  in  June  2018,  the  newly  created  Water  Resources  and  Water  Supply \n\n11 Government of the Netherlands. 2016.

Urban Infrastructure Improvement in Yangon City: Scoping Study. Manila. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nAuthority  (WRWSA)  has  been  designated  to  be  responsible  for  the  YCDC\u2019s  water  supply  and \nresources.14  The  transfer  of  water  supply  functions  from  the  EDWS  to  the  WRWSA  has  been \ncompleted.  However,  YCDC\u2019s  capacity  needs  to  be  enhanced  because  the  water  sector \nchallenges  facing  Yangon  City  require  the  YCDC  to manage  water resources  and  services  as \nefficiently  and  prudently as  possible.  Building  the  capacity  of the WRWSA  and  managing  new \ninstitutional arrangements is an ongoing process and is a precondition for the delivery of improved \nand expanded water services. \n \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  YCDC\u2019s  revenue  comprises  tax  (31%),  tariff  (8%),  and \n16. \nother  income  sources  (61%)  such  as  permits  and  licenses,  and  land  and  building  rental.  The \nYCDC receives no intergovernmental transfers, except a subsidy for capital investment. During \nFY2015-FY2019, the YCDC maintained an operating ratio of 0.5\u20130.6. However, forecasts show \nthat the operating ratio will cross 1.0 by 2030 because the growth rate of operating expenses will \nexceed  that  of  revenue by  a  considerable margin.  Hence,  it  is  critical to reinforce  the  revenue \nstream  with  efforts  by  both  the  YRG  and  the  YCDC  to  undertake  institutional  reforms \naccompanied by a well-regulated tariff system and prudent financial management practices. \n \n17. \nSector strategy. With support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), \nthe  Yangon  Region  Government  (YRG)  and  the  YCDC  developed  the  Strategic  Urban \nDevelopment Plan (SUDP) of Greater Yangon, which was approved by the Parliament of Yangon \nRegion in June 2015 and updated in 2018.15 The SUDP is the vision of the future structure of \nYangon Region, including for Yangon City, and for other urban sub centers, greenbelts, and new \ntowns. Building on this vision, the YCDC plans to expand reliable and safe water service to 86% \nof the Yangon City residents by 2040.16 \n \n18. \nAs identified in the SUDP, the YCDC proposes to (i) develop water resources and water \ntreatment  capacity;  (ii)  establish  effective  transmission  and  distribution  systems;  (iii)  improve \nwater  quality;  (iv)  reduce  water  losses;  (v)  improve  billing  and  collection;  and  (vi)  improve \ninstitutional and organizational capacity, and enhance human resources. Based on the SUDP, \nthe YCDC has commenced a series of projects, including the Yangon Water Supply Improvement \nProject in 2015 with a phase I loan of $222 million from JICA. This will be followed by additional \nsupport from JICA and other development partners. The phased projects identified by the SUDP \nwill  bring  additional  supply,  transfer,  treatment,  and  distribution  capacity  to  help  meet  Yangon \nCity\u2019s ambitious targets for water service coverage by 2040. \n \n19. \nThe  project  will  enhance  Yangon  City\u2019s  water  security,  achieving  benefits  for  all \nresidents.17  This  was  a  fundamental  requirement  before  the  emergence  of  COVID-19.  The \nproposed project now has far greater urgency and importance as an essential part of the response \nto  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  other  future  health  emergencies.  Access  to  safe  and  reliable \ndrinking  water  complements  access  to  adequate  sanitation  and  good  hygiene  practices. \nCombining  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  is  a  fundamental  building  block  in  delivering \nimproved  health  outcomes,  especially  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  and  leads  to  wider  socio-\neconomic  benefits  in  addition  to  its  impact  on  public  health.

The  government  has  placed  a  high-level  focus  on  the \ndevelopment  of  sustainable  cities  to  achieve  its  overarching  goal  of  inclusive  and  sustainable \neconomic  development.19  Equitable  access  to  water  and  sanitation  is  a  key  component  of  the \nMyanmar  Sustainable  Development  Plan,  which  also  includes  the  development  of  additional \nwater resources, enhanced management of water supply, and improved sanitation.20 The project \nsupports government initiatives to make its infrastructure climate resilient and energy efficient.21 \nThe project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2017\u20132021 and \ncountry operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 that identify urban development as a priority area, \nwith support for climate change responses and enhanced institutional capacity.22 \n \n22. \nDevelopment  coordination.  The  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  is \npreparing the feasibility study for the Hlawga Water Supply Project, which will include a new 205 \nMLD  WTP.  The  raw  water  for  this  AFD  project  may  be  supplied  via  the  new  bulk  water \ntransmission system to be constructed under the project. The 818 MLD of water envisaged to be \ntransferred under the project will supply 409 MLD to the existing Nyaungnhapin WTP. The YCDC \nis considering options to fully utilize the augmented water supply, including routing 205 MLD of \nthe remaining 409 MLD to the Hlawga WTP under the AFD project and allocating the balance of \n204 MLD to a future expansion of the Nyaungnhapin WTP. The project will also continue to build \nlinks  with  ongoing  JICA-supported  water  supply  and  wastewater  management  improvement \nprojects  and  programs  which  support  capacity  development  in  urban  management  and  water \n\n \n\n18 ADB.  2018.

There  is  no  active  conflict  in  Yangon  City  or  the  project  area. \nHowever, the project is designed with an understanding of the country context. The project will \nbenefit  all  communities  in  the  townships  where  the  YCDC  provides  piped  water  supply,  in  an \ninclusive and fair manner through access to secure water services. The project will minimize risks \nassociated  with  conflict  through  meaningful  stakeholder  participation,  including  civil  society \nengagement and an effective communication strategy. \n \nB. \n \nImpact  and  outcome.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  Yangon  City\u2019s \n24. \nurban resilience and livability enhanced.24 The project will have the following outcome: security of \nYangon City\u2019s water supply reinforced.25 \n \nOutput 1: Bulk water transmission system constructed. The project will finance the \n25. \nconstruction of new facilities to transfer about 818 MLD of water to Yangon City, including (i) an \nintake  structure  at  the  Ngamoeyeik  reservoir,  (ii)  an  online  pumping  station  900  meters  (m) \ndownstream of the intake structure, and (iii) a 34 km pipeline of 2.4 m diameter from Ngamoeyeik \nreservoir to the Nyaungnhapin WTP.26  These interventions will secure and expand the existing \nwater services and will complement the YCDC\u2019s strategic plan by increasing the supply of raw \nwater from the Ngamoeyeik reservoir to the Nyaungnhapin WTP by one third from 614 MLD to \n818 MLD. \n \n26. \nOutput  2:  Institutional  sustainability  strengthened.  The  project  will  strengthen  the \nYCDC\u2019s institutional sustainability to increase the reliability of its water services and by supporting \nits subsidiary water authority, the WRWSA. It will support capacity building of the YCDC in critical \nareas, such as water systems operational management and climate change responsiveness. The \nproject  will  prepare  a  wide-ranging  financial  sustainability  road  map  for  the  YCDC,  including \noptions for a new water tariff strategy. The project will also provide targeted support to build the \nYCDC\u2019s self-financing capacity to meet the growing demands on its water service. The project \nwill support the YCDC in optimizing its operating efficiency by expanding its metered water service \nand improving its collection efficiency and customer service. \n \n27. \nKey  lessons.  The  project  preparation  built  on  lessons  from  recent  project  design  and \nimplementation  experience.27  The  key  lessons  incorporated  in  the  project  include  (i) upfront \n\n \n\n23 In 2015, the YCDC commenced the JICA-financed Yangon Water Supply Improvement Project (phase I). Under the \nfollow-on phase II (commenced in 2017), the first tranche of $232 million will help expand the YCDC\u2019s water treatment \ncapacity and improve its distribution networks. The second tranche of the phase II loan will be disbursed from 2020 \nand the third tranche from 2023, for a total of $398 million. \n\n24 Government of Myanmar. 2016.

The  project  will  directly \ncomplement  the  YCDC\u2019s  SUDP  master  plan  for  the  Yangon  Region  (vision  for  2040)  by \nreinforcing  bulk  water  supply  to  Yangon  City  (paras.  17\u201318).  The  project  supports  the  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2017\u20132021, to improve access to basic infrastructure \nand  services,  accelerate  structural  and  institutional  reforms  in  key  sectors  and  provide  tailor-\nmade, innovative knowledge and technology solutions (para. 21). The project is also aligned with \nthe YCDC\u2019s phased approach in the water sector through various development partner-funded \nprojects including by AFD, JICA and World Bank (para. 22). The project will also help Myanmar \nmeet the relevant Sustainable Development Goals. \n \nADB\u2019s comparative advantage in driving sector reform will be central in the support offered \n29. \nby the project as the YCDC seeks to build capacity in the WRWSA. ADB will provide the YCDC \nwith targeted support in long-term planning and strengthening of the WRWSA. ADB will assist the \nYCDC by closing the large financing gap, which is a prerequisite for ensuring the city\u2019s long-term \nwater security. Adoption of information and communication technologies and other remote digital \nsystems will deliver benefits in control and systems management. In addition, the project will bring \ninternational  best  practice  on  efficient  operational  management  of  a  large-scale  bulk  water \nscheme using the emerging principles of smart water and big (cloud) data. Through the project, \nADB  will  support  transfer  of  best  practices  in  water  operations  to  other  cities  in  Myanmar  and \nspecifically under ADB\u2019s ongoing operations (footnote 27). \n \nD. \n \n30. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $196  million  (Table  2).

Several routes for the pipeline from the reservoir to \nthe WTP were investigated, including a canal route, a road route, a mixed road\u2013canal route, and \na  cross-country  route.  Based  on  a  comparative  assessment,  the  road  route  was  preferred \nbecause of its reliance on an established right-of-way (ROW); ease of construction, access, and \noperation and maintenance (O&M); lower safeguard impacts; and cost efficiency. The initial part \nof  the  ROW  is  in  favor  of  the  YCDC,  and  the  remaining  section  is  vested  in  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction.30  \n \n36. \nConstruction considerations. To minimize the width and depth of the trench, moderate \nthe social  and  environmental  impacts,  and  reduce the  initial  investment costs,  an  intermediate \npumping  station  is  proposed.  The  adoption  of  the  pumping  station  will  reduce  the  pipeline\u2019s \ninternal diameter by 0.5 m, from about 2.9 m to 2.4 m, and decrease the necessary excavation \ndepth by about 1.5 m.  \n \n37. \nSafe  working  under  COVID-19  conditions.  The  impact  of  the  COVID-19  disease  is \nevolving. The implementation of the project will be responsive and flexible in meeting emerging \nneeds and new best practice in construction and water utility management. The YCDC, the project \nmanagement consultant, and the contractor will incorporate emerging international construction \nbest  practice  on  implementation  methodologies  for  managing  COVID-19  risk,  vital  for  work  in \ndeep trench and other confined spaces where the risk of transmission is high. Such practices will \nalso consider the government\u2019s guidance on safe working in COVID-19 conditions. \n \n38. \nOperation  and  maintenance.  The  project\u2019s  bulk  water  transmission  system  will  be \noperated  using  a  combination  of  gravity  and  pumping  mains.  Treatment  of  the  water  will  be \nundertaken downstream of the system by the YCDC. On completion of the project, the YCDC will \nbe  responsible  for  O&M.  Support  will  be  provided  to  the  YCDC  during  implementation  of  the \nproject to develop operational guidelines to manage the system including the need for planned \n\n30 The YCDC has obtained permission from the Ministry of Construction to construct, operate, and maintain the project\u2019s \n\nfacilities within the Ministry of Construction\u2019s ROW. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nphysical  inspections  and/or related  work. In  accordance  with  water  industry  good  practice,  the \ndesign of the project will limit the need for physical inspections by the YCDC during O&M. The \nlessons learned from the project under COVID-19 conditions will be collated in an O&M manual \nto document best practices and synthesize approaches for O&M for future health emergencies.  \n \n39. \nClimate change considerations. The water balance study conducted with support from \nthe Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund confirmed that, under climate change conditions \nand  continued  urban  growth,  no  water  shortage  is  anticipated  at  the  Ngamoeyeik  reservoir \nbecause of the project. The project\u2019s water demand from the reservoir will have no adverse impact \non  MOALI  operations.31  The  pumping  station  has  been  designed  with  high-efficiency  pumps, \nwhich  will  minimize  power  consumption.  The  project  design  will  protect  project-related  key \nequipment  and  structures  which  may  be  vulnerable  to  potential  damage  from  erosion  and/or \nflooding. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic viability of the project. The \n40. \nresults of the economic cost\u2013benefit analysis show that the project is economically viable. The \neconomic net present value is MK19.2 billion ($12.7 million) based on a discount rate of 9%, and \nthe economic internal rate of return is 10%, which exceeds the economic opportunity cost of 9%. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic viability  would  increase  if  unquantifiable  economic  benefits from  better \nhealth of the population and improved environmental conditions are considered. \n \nC. \n \n41. \nThe project is nonrevenue-generating and the financial analysis indicated that the project \nis unlikely to be financially viable in the medium- to long-term under the current revenue stream. \nTo  ensure  financial  sustainability,  the  project  will  support  an  operation  efficiency  optimization \nprogram that includes expanding the metered water service, enhancing collection efficiency, and \nimproving customer service. The YRG has obliged the YCDC to explore all practical means to put \nitself on a path to financial sustainability using its powers to raise tariffs under the Yangon City \nMunicipal Law. Hence, the YCDC will engage in a phased, economically and socially acceptable \ntariff reform program, coupled with a long-term plan for service coverage expansion. A financial \nsustainability road map to be developed under the project will contain a new water tariff structure \ninformed  by  socioeconomic  survey  outcomes  and  JICA\u2019s  support  to  the  YCDC  on  financial \nmanagement. The YRG will guarantee budget transfers to the YCDC to cover any project related \nO&M shortfall.32 \n \nD. \n \nFinancial  management  assessment.  The  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is \n42. \nconsidered substantial because of the weak capacity of the YCDC\u2019s staff to manage ADB funds, \ndeficiencies  in  the  coverage  and  timeliness  of  external  project  audit,  structural  weakness  of \ninternal  audit  system,  suboptimal  record-keeping,  and  inconsistencies  because  of  a  lack  of  a \nrobust financial management information system. The project includes the following risk mitigation \nmeasures:  (i)  provision  of  focused  and  demand-driven  training  on  ADB  financial  management \nrequirements  and  loan  disbursement  procedures,  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  endorsement  of  the  terms  of \n\nSustainability \n\nGovernance \n\nadministered by ADB. \n\n \n\n31 Financed by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility and \n\n32 Yangon  Region  Parliament.  2018.  Yangon  City  Municipal  Law.  The  Yangon  City  Municipal  Law  establishes  the \ninstitutional relationship between the YCDC and the YRG and stipulates that the YCDC operates under the Yangon \nRegion\u2019s Budget Law, which is administered by the YRG. \n\n \n\n\freference  for  the  external  auditor  to  ensure  the  quality  of  external  audit  of  project  financial \nstatements, (iii) provision of a capacity-building program to strengthen the internal audit capacity, \nand (iv) adoption of a robust financial management information system. \n \nThe YCDC operates under Yangon Region\u2019s Budget Law, but raises its own revenues by \n43. \ncollecting fees, tariffs, and taxes in accordance with the Yangon City Municipal Law. At the end \nof each fiscal year, the YCDC is required to prepare annual financial statements in accordance \nwith  the  Myanmar  Accounting  Standards,  which  are  audited  by  the  Yangon  Region  auditor \ngeneral  in  accordance  with  the  Yangon  City  Municipal  Law  and  submitted  to  the  YRG  for \nconfirmation of its funds and operations by the YRG. The project will ensure that the YCDC and/or \nthe YRG make sufficient funds available for long-term O&M of the facilities constructed under the \nproject. \n \n44. \nProcurement capacity assessments. The procurement risk is rated high. The strategic \nprocurement planning assessed procurement risks and identified optimal procurement packages \nto mitigate such risks given the capacity constraints within the YCDC. Procurement is streamlined \nunder  two  main  packages\u2014a  consulting  contract  for  preparation  of  detailed  design  and \nconstruction  supervision  and  a  large  civil  works  contract  that  includes  capacity  building  of  the \nYCDC  in  O&M  of the  facility  after  completion.  The  single-responsibility  civil  works  contract  will \nhelp deliver value for money as it minimizes interfaces and organizational complexity, allowing for \nmore  efficient  delivery.  The  appointment  of  one  contractor  responsible  for  procurement  of  the \npipeline will further drive value for money by bringing economies of scale in the manufacturing of \nthe pipes. \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n45. \nwith  the  government,  the  YRG,  and  the  YCDC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE. \n \n46. \nPoverty targeting. The project is classified as a general intervention for poverty targeting \nbecause it will construct a bulk water transmission system to improve urban resilience. Improved \nservices will contribute to making the city more productive and increasing economic opportunities \nfor  people,  leading  to  poverty  reduction.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  800,000  people  in  the \nYCDC  service  area.  The  project\u2019s  civil  works  contract  will  give  people  in  the  project  area  an \nopportunity to work as part of the labor force, particularly in the numerous unskilled jobs. \n \n47. \nGender features. The project is categorized no gender elements. Due to the nature of the \nproject,  which  focuses  on  bulk  water  supply  infrastructure,  it  is  unlikely  to  directly  improve \nwomen\u2019s  access  to  services  and  opportunities.  However,  through  the  project,  the  YCDC  will \nensure  that  its  consultations,  communications,  and  customer  satisfaction  surveys  are  gender-\nsensitive.  The  YCDC  will  also  enhance  the  skills  of  female  staff  by  ensuring  high  levels  of \nrepresentation in project management, procurement, and financial management activities, and in \ncapacity  building  on  improving  water  management,  climate  change  responsiveness,  and \noperation of the project facilities. The project will not disadvantage women in any way and the \noutcome of the project is fully inclusive and everyone in society will benefit equally. \n \nF. \n \n48. \ncategories are as follows. \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nPoverty, Social and Gender \n\nSafeguards \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nEnvironment (category B). The project has been classified as category B, requiring an \n49. \ninitial environmental examination (IEE).33 The IEE report has been prepared in accordance with \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  Myanmar  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment  Procedure  (2015).  The  IEE  concluded  that  the  project  will  have  positive  benefits \nthrough  improvements  in  water  security  and  in  water  quality  at  the  Nyaungnhapin  WTP. \nAnticipated adverse impacts during construction are temporary and localized and will be mitigated \nand monitored through measures defined in the environmental management plan (EMP).34 The \nYCDC, through its project management unit, will be responsible for implementing and monitoring \nthe  EMP,  and  has  committed  to  provide  adequate  environmental  management  capacity. \nAssuming that measures in the EMP are effectively implemented, the project is not expected to \nhave a significant adverse environmental impact. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The  project  will  not  involve  acquisition  of  any \n50. \nprivately  owned  lands,  as  the  pipeline  will  be  constructed  using the  existing  ROW  held  by the \nMinistry of Construction and the YCDC. During project preparation, various encroachments were \nidentified  along  the  ROW.  Some  of  these  structures  will  be  affected  entirely  and  some  will  be \nimpacted  partially.  The  total  number  of  project-affected  households  is  226  with  918  affected \npersons. Of these affected households, 142 are considered vulnerable, and 99 of these 142 are \nconsidered  severely  affected.  All  142  affected  households  are  eligible  for  additional  financial \nassistance, will be supported under a livelihood and income restoration program, and will be given \npreference for project-related employment during construction. \n \n51. \nResettlement plan. The draft resettlement plan has been developed in accordance with \nnational  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  It  includes  provision  for \ncompensation  for  all  assets  at replacement value,  additional  assistance,  and resettlement  and \nrehabilitation measures for affected persons, including vulnerable households and those without \nlegal title to the land.35 The project will assist in relocating the permanently affected households \nalong the same ROW, where feasible, after due compensation.  \n \n52. \nThe draft resettlement plan was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 19 March 2020. The draft \nresettlement plan will be finalized, and the cost estimates will be updated, during detailed design. \nThe YCDC has limited experience and capacity to manage involuntary resettlement, and they will \nreceive training and other support.36 The YCDC will engage an external monitor to oversee the \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. A corrective action plan will be prepared to rectify any \nnoncompliance. \n \n53. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Ethnic  groups  represent  only  2%  of  the  surveyed \npopulation. The project will have no direct or indirect impacts on these ethnic households. These \nethnic households have migrated to Yangon City from other regions of Myanmar. Nonetheless, \nthe resettlement plan provides for additional assistance, so that any unforeseen impacts on ethnic \nhouseholds can be mitigated during detailed design. \n \n54. \nConsultation,  communication,  and  grievance  redress  mechanism.  Meaningful \nconsultations  with  affected  persons  have  been  undertaken  by  the  YCDC  during  project \npreparation, and this will continue during project implementation with the participation of affected \n\n \n\n33 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 During construction, there will be localized temporary adverse impacts caused by excavation, tunneling, and pipe-\nlaying works, including ground surface disturbance, increased dust and noise levels, occupational and community \nhealth and safety risks, temporary traffic disturbance, and spoil disposal. \n\n35 An indicative budget provision of $1.25 million has been made for implementation of the resettlement plan. \n36  Training  on  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  to  build  stakeholder  capacity  will  be  provided  by  the  project \n\nmanagement consultant. \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\npersons.  A  stakeholder  analysis,  participation  plan,  and  communication  strategy  have  been \nprepared  by  the  YCDC,  and  a  gender-inclusive  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been \ndeveloped to address concerns, complaints, and grievances during project implementation. \n \nG. \n \n55. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.37 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nThe YCDC and/or the YRG fail to secure \ntimely and legally enforceable \ncommitments from the relevant \nauthorities for on-demand water \nallocation, provision of power supplies, \nand access to right-of-way. \nThe YCDC has no experience with ADB \nprocurement procedures. \n\nThe YCDC\u2019s approach to compensation \npayment, support, and resettlement of \naffected persons leads to noncompliance \nwith ADB policies and procedures; and \ndelays in allocation of funds for \nimplementation of the resettlement plan \nlead to construction delay. \nThe YCDC\u2019s revenue is insufficient to \ncover the O&M of new infrastructure and \nrepay the loan through the YRG. Also, \nthe YRG\u2019s capacity for the YCDC budget \nsupport is not confirmed and, hence, \nfinancial arrangements may be \nunsustainable. \nThe YCDC staff has weak capacity to \nmanage project funds and comply with \nADB\u2019s financial reporting requirements.  \nPlacement of the Internal Audit Division \nunder the Budget and Accounts \nDepartment creates structural \nweaknesses in the YCDC\u2019s internal audit \nsystem. \nThe coverage and timeliness of the \nYangon Region auditor general\u2019s project \naudit are deficient. \nThe MS Excel-based accounting system \nin use in the YCDC leads to improper \nrecord-keeping and mistakes. \nCOVID-19 impacts adversely on the \ncontractor\u2019s workforce, subcontractors, \n\n \n\nThe assurances from the relevant authorities will be \nformalized as loan covenants, and ADB will assist the \nYCDC to the extent practicable in negotiations with the \nrelevant authorities. \n\nThe number of procurement packages will be minimized, \nand an open competitive bidding process will be adopted. \nThe project management consultant will include \nprocurement specialists experienced in ADB\u2019s procurement \nprocedures. Procurement training will be provided while \ndeveloping the strategy road map for the YCDC on \nplanning and operational management. \nADB has discussed its Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nrequirements with the YCDC, and the draft resettlement \nplan prepared complies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirement. ADB has sensitized the YCDC on \nthe requirements of resettlement costs as part of its \nresponsibilities. \n\nThe loan agreement includes the YRG\u2019s guarantee of \nbudget allocation, subsidy, fiscal transfer, or any other \nfinancial support to the YCDC to cover any shortfall. A \nsocioeconomic survey will inform the financial sustainability \nroad map for the YCDC, which will include \nrecommendations on the water tariff. \n\nDevelop a project-specific financial management manual \nfor the project management unit and provide financial \nmanagement training to YCDC staff. \nProvide a capacity-building program to strengthen the \ninternal audit function. \n\nADB-endorsed audit terms of reference, scope, and \nrequirement will be shared with the Yangon Region auditor \ngeneral in advance for the project financial statement audit. \nThe project will support the installation of financial \nmanagement information system software and training in \nits use. \nThe contractor will maintain vigilance in the management of \nCOVID-19 health risks in all siteworks to allow for a safe \n\n37 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fRisks \nsuppliers, consultants, government and \nADB staff, and general public \n(particularly vulnerable people). \n\nThe technical capability of the YCDC is \ninsufficient to operate and maintain the \nnew water supply facilities. \n\nMitigation Measures \nworking environment, including in adjacent areas used by \nthe general public.
