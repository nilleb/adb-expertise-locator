The project \nwill strengthen the rural health sector by providing newly established rural family polyclinics with \nmodern  equipment  and  health  workforce  development  to  expand  their  service  delivery.  The \nproject will be supported by tools to monitor the government\u2019s broader PHC reform efforts and \nwill  include  the  pilot  test  of  a  digital  health  management  information  system  (HMIS)  in  a  rural \nregion. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nCountry profile. Uzbekistan is a middle-income country of about 32 million people, almost \ntwo-thirds of whom live in rural areas. Uzbekistan\u2019s economy has grown 7.6% per year on average \nduring 2012\u20132016, which has resulted in an increase of per capita gross national income from \n$420 in 2003 to $2,220 in 20161 and a decline in the poverty rate from 14.1% in 2013 to about \n12.5% in 2016.2 Despite sustained high economic growth, rural\u2013urban disparities remain. Rural \nhousehold income in 2015 was 46.0% of the national average. In 2017, the government adopted \na  5-year  national  development  strategy,  which  sets  out  five  priority  areas:  (i)  governance  and \npublic  administration;  (ii)  rule  of  law  and  the  judicial  system;  (iii)  economic  development  and \nliberalization; (iv) social development; and (v) security, tolerance, and foreign policy.3 The strategy \nidentifies inclusive growth and continued economic diversification as key to its reform objectives. \n \n4. \nHealth sector policy and performance. When Uzbekistan declared its independence in \n1991,  its  health  system  needed  significant  restructure  and  reform  to  meet  existing  and  future \nhealth needs. It was centralized, aging, and hospital-dominated; and its workforce could not meet \nthe future needs of the population. It needed to transition to new forms of management, financing, \nand health care provision. \n \nUzbekistan recognized  these challenges  and  placed high  importance on sector  reform, \n5. \nstarting with PHC reform in 1999. Under the State Health System Reform Program, it improved \nand modernized health infrastructure, trained staff, and pilot-tested financing and management \nreforms  to  promote  innovation.  Substantial  investment  in  tertiary  care  resulted  in  the \nestablishment of multi-profile pediatric and regional hospitals, and the upgrade of district and 10 \nother specialized hospitals. With the help of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World \n\n                                                \n1  World  Bank  Open  Data.  Uzbekistan.  Gross  National  Income  per  Capita,  Atlas  Method  (current  US$) \n\nhttps://data.worldbank.org/country/uzbekistan (accessed 4 September 2017). \n\n2  World Bank. 2017. The World Bank in Uzbekistan: Country Snapshot. April 2017.  http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/ \n\n421341493272766409/Uzbekistan-Snapshot-April-2017.pdf. p. 3. \n\n3  Government of Uzbekistan. 2017. The Strategy of Action of the Republic of Uzbekistan in Five Priority Development \n\nAreas between 2017 and 2021. Presidential Decree No. PP-2857. Tashkent (7 February). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fBank,  reforms,  particularly  structural  and  financing,  have  continued  with  the  implicit  aim  of \nimproving accessibility, equity, and quality of care through health system strengthening.4 \n \n6. \nThe health indicators show significant and continuous improvement since 1991. In 1990\u2013\n2015, major improvements were seen in the maternal mortality ratio and the under-5 and infant \nmortality rates. During the period, the maternal mortality ratio fell from 66 to 36 per 100,000 live \nbirths; the mortality rate for children under 5 years declined from 48.2 to 15.1 per 1,000 live births; \nand the infant mortality rate dropped from 35.5 to 11.4 per 1,000 births.5 \n \n7. \nHowever, the health indicators for noncommunicable diseases (chronic ones like cancer \nand diabetes), especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD), show alarming trends with escalating \npremature  mortality  and  morbidity  rates. 6  CVD,  which  causes  premature  death  and  loss  of \nproductive life years, is estimated to cause more than 45% of all annual deaths worldwide7 and is \nthe leading cause of adult mortality in Uzbekistan.8 CVD-specific mortality rates for men (238 per \n1,000  people)  are  significantly  higher  than  those  for  women  (133  per  1,000  people)  largely \nbecause of CVD risk differences.9 To reduce risks and improve mortality rates, Uzbekistan needs \nto improve and bring PHC services closer to patients. \n \n8. \nHealth system financing. Public spending on health care marginally increased between \n2010 and 2014 both in absolute terms and in relative terms (as a proportion of total government \nexpenditure, gross domestic product, and per capita). Total health expenditure as a proportion of \ntotal public expenditure increased from 8.67% in 2010 to 10.74% in 2014. Health expenditure per \ncapita increased from $75.74 to $124.11 in real terms, indicating a commitment to strengthen the \nsector.10 In 2012, the country spent 5.9% of its gross domestic product on health. In the same \nyear, public financing sources (mostly raised through taxes) accounted for 53.1% of total health \nspending,  with  the  remainder  coming  mostly  in  the  form  of  out-of-pocket  expenditure. 11 \nUzbekistan funds secondary care on an input basis and is increasingly self-financing through user \nfees. PHC is funded predominantly through tax-based public financing, and, as laid down by policy, \nall citizens are entitled to a package of care, including services to cover chronic conditions.  The \nplanned  social  health  insurance  system  and  ongoing  PHC  reforms  will  help  improve  financial \nsustainability of the health system. 12 The private sector plays a small part in Uzbekistan\u2019s health \nsystem  and  is  unlikely  to provide  these  improved  services  because  of  the  low  rate  of revenue \nreturn. \n \n9. \nPrimary  health  service  delivery.  Inequalities  and  differences  in the  health  status  and \nability of the population to access health services are seen between people living in urban and \n                                                \n4  The national priority areas in health policy included the protection of maternal and child health, the prevention and \ncontrol of infectious diseases, the protection of the environment, and the strengthening of tertiary care services. \n\n5   Ministry of Health statistics, 2016. \n6  Global  Health  Data  Exchange.

Modern diagnostic equipment will help establish risk-based systems in Uzbekistan. \n9  Before menopause, women are significantly less vulnerable to heart disease than men. Post-menopause, however, \nthe mortality risk for female and male equalizes. Current equipment cannot detect microvascular heart disease, which \naccounts for most heart attacks of post-menopausal women. Modern diagnostic equipment will be able to detect it. \n\n10 World Bank. Health expenditure per capita (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator). \n11 M. Ahmedov et al. 2014.

Presidential \n\nDecree \u2116PP-2863. Tashkent (1 April). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\frural areas. The PHC segment still faces problems of service quality and availability in general, \nbut specifically in rural areas. In 2017, a presidential decree outlining a restructured health service \ndelivery  system  accelerated  progress  in  PHC  reform  efforts. 13 Before  the  decree,  PHC  was \nprovided through rural health points that offered very limited health care and diagnostic services, \nwhich led people, particularly those in rural communities, to seek health care from higher-level \nclinics or hospitals. These health facilities are typically far from their homes, and the cost of the \ncare they provide, both to the government and to the individual, is higher. The service optimization \nprocess of the Ministry of Health (MOH) will  consolidate PHC services and establish 793 rural \nfamily polyclinics. The optimization process aims to (i) increase the availability of a wider spectrum \nof  health  services  not  currently  available  to  rural  populations  and  (ii)  prevent  people  from \nbypassing PHC facilities for nonemergency care to reduce the overutilization of secondary and \ntertiary health facilities. \n \n10. \nRural family polyclinics. Rural family polyclinics will  provide improved health services \nthrough modern equipment and a well-trained health workforce, and will become a key component \nof  the  PHC  system.  Polyclinics  are  PHC  facilities  that  provide  general  and  specialist  health \nservices, including diagnosis, to people on an outpatient basis. They are independent of hospitals \nand ideally provide 60%\u221270% of the population\u2019s health needs. \n \n11. \nRural family polyclinics will be in every district of the country. Their site was determined \nby MOH and was based on a population analysis (about one clinic per 10,000 residents) and/or \nthe distance between clinics. In less populated districts, clinics obviously will service fewer people \nbut will be within reach. Decommissioned rural health points will be converted to housing for health \nstaff to attract staff to rural areas and allow longer operating hours. The project will not carry out \nany  civil  works  because  the  existing  clinics  are  in  sufficiently  good  order  to  use  the  modern \ndiagnostic equipment now, and all the equipment is portable. \n \n12. \nThe  project  will  support  government  efforts  to  improve  PHC  services  by  providing  key \nequipment  and  training  for  the  793  newly  established  rural  family  polyclinics.14 The  equipment \nthat  will  be  procured  under  the  project  is  not  currently  available  in  the  rural  PHC  system.  The \nequipment,  and  training  on  its  use,  will  increase  the  chances  of  overcoming  Uzbekistan\u2019s  key \nhealth  challenges,  particularly  those  relating  to  CVD,  antenatal  care,  and  disease  prevention. \nMatching an investment in equipment with training to increase the diagnostic and therapeutic skill \nof  PHC  staff  will  contribute  to  more  equitable  distribution  of the  health workforce,  increase  the \nquality  of  diagnosis  and  reduce  the  irrational  use  of  drugs,  reduce  inappropriate  hospital \nadmissions, and increase the availability of health services in rural areas. Improving diagnostic \nand therapeutic interventions significantly strengthens a country\u2019s health system. \n \n13. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 3 on universal health coverage (UHC)15 and SDG 5 on universal access \nto reproductive health.16 The project will promote SDG 3\u2019s clear focus on equity, including equity-\nfocused monitoring and evaluation, to help ensure that targets are being met and that no one is \nbeing left behind, and to contribute toward achieving SDG 5. A strong health system is needed to \nmeet  these  SDGs,  and  expanding  and  optimizing  the  scope  of  PHC  services  through \n\n                                                \n13 Government of Uzbekistan. 2017. Measures of Improving the Organization of Activities of Primary Medico-Sanitary \n\nCare Institutions in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Presidential Decree No. PP-2857. Tashkent (1 April). \n\n14 ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Electronic Healthcare Development Project (TA 9148-\n\nUZB, $800,000, approved on 5 August 2016). \n\n15 WHO defines UHC as all people receiving the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. \n16 SDG 5\u2019s indicator 5.6 is to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\finfrastructure or equipment investments also needs to be linked to a health system improvement \nframework.17 The project will apply the UHC monitoring framework of ADB and the World Health \nOrganization (WHO), which will provide an opportunity to monitor the performance of the health \nsystem and its reforms and to ensure that the investments will help achieve UHC in Uzbekistan.18 \nThis framework would not have been incorporated without ADB financing. MOH will be able to \nuse  the  results  provided  to  refine  policies  and  programs  and help  reduce  inequities  in  service \naccess, coverage, and health and well-being. \n \nLink  to  national  development  strategy  and  ADB  sector  priority.  The  project  aligns \n14. \nclosely with Uzbekistan\u2019s national goal of improved quality of life and better services and its health \nstrategic  plans. 19  It  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2016\u20132018  for \nUzbekistan20 and paves the way for a long-term programmatic approach consistent with ADB\u2019s \nhealth operations plan.21 \n \n15. \nADB experience and lessons learned. The project directly builds on the achievements \nand lessons learned from ADB\u2019s previous support for the health sector. In 2004, ADB approved \na sovereign  loan of  $40 million  for  the Woman and  Child Health  (WCH) Development  Project, \nwhich  demonstrated  the  \u201cimportance  of  (i)  strong  commitment  by  the  government,  (ii)  close \ncollaboration among development partners, and (iii) prompt response to changing client needs \nduring implementation. The leadership provided by MOH and the project coordinator was a key \nto the project\u2019s achievements. The project was not a stand-alone WCH but a part of broader health \nsector reforms. Strong collaboration among partners and responsiveness to actual needs was an \nimportant contributor to the success of the various programs.\u201d22 \n \nDevelopment  coordination.  Under  previous  health  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  the \n16. \nWorld  Bank,  MOH  established  a  joint  project  implementation  bureau  (JPIB)  and  development \npartner coordination mechanisms.23 Implementation of the project will be closely coordinated with \nthe projects of other development partners\u2014such as the third and fourth health projects of  the \nWorld  Bank,  which  are  also  procuring  equipment\u2014to  ensure  that  there  is  no  duplication  of \nprocurement. 24 In addition, the project team will work closely with WHO and the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to monitor the PHC reform and adapt the ADB\u2013WHO UHC monitoring \nframework for Uzbekistan. \n \n\n                                                \n17 A  health  system  needs  staff,  funds,  information,  supplies,  transport,  communications,  and  overall  guidance  and \n\ndirection to function. Strengthening health systems means addressing key constraints in each of these areas. \n\n18 ADB. 2016.

Preparation  is  underway  for  a  fourth  health  project  in  Uzbekistan, \nestimated at $92 million. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n \n17. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with the  following  impact:  level  of  hospitalization,  incidence,  and \ndisability of populations in service areas reduced (footnotes 3 and 13). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: availability25 of PHC services in rural areas expanded.26 \n \nC. \n \nOutput  1:  Health  services  in  family  polyclinics  in  rural  areas  strengthened.  This \n18. \noutput will provide equipment to each of the newly established family polyclinics. Each polyclinic \nwill receive the same set of equipment, which has been selected based on a needs assessment \nand health indications. The set of equipment will include (i) a digital diagnostic ultrasound unit for \nantenatal  care  or  noninvasive  examination  of  internal  organs  or  vessels;  (ii)  a  12-lead \nelectrocardiograph for noninvasive routine examination of the heart, which can identify underlying \nheart  conditions;  (iii)  an  ophthalmoscope  for  eye  examinations  and  an  otoscope  for  ear \nexaminations; (iv) surgical instruments for minor surgical procedures for conditions that can be \ntreated quickly and easily using only local anesthetic; (v) gynecology and midwifery instruments \nto  improve  birth  outcomes,  cancer  screening,  and  reproductive  health;  (vi)  a  dental  chair  and \nbasic dental equipment (vii) a home-visit bag and equipment for nurses to provide home patient \ncare;  (viii)  a  weighing  scale  with  height  measurement  for  physical  assessment;  and  (ix)  a \ncomputer  and  printer  to  facilitate  service  data  reporting.  The  project  will  make  sure  that  all \nprocured  equipment  will  be  registered  with  and  maintained  by  MOH\u2019s  National  Maintenance \nCenter, which opened in 2017. \n \nOutput  2:  Capacity  of  polyclinic  staff  enhanced.  This  output  will  provide  training  to \n19. \nabout 2,700 health technology operators, doctors, and nurses at family polyclinics to ensure their \ncompetence in using the equipment and to improve their diagnostic and therapeutic skills. This in \nturn  will  help  improve  the  quality  of  care,  and  public  trust  in  and  use  of  PHC  services;  and \nultimately  reduce  morbidity  and  mortality.  Under  this  output,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  medical  training \ninstitutions will be provided with the necessary training and equipment to institutionalize the skills \nof their health staff. \n \nOutput 3: PHC monitoring tools institutionalized. This output will provide monitoring \n20. \ntools to monitor and strengthen the performance of the country\u2019s health system. The project will \npilot-test a digital HMIS, which will incorporate clinic management, in  the rural region of Sirdaryo, \none of the country\u2019s 12 regions. The HMIS developed during the pilot could be readily incorporated \nin all regions in the future. MOH began a similar HMIS pilot in 24 urban PHC facilities in May 2017. \nExcept for the pilot rural region, monitoring in all other regions will use current paper-based data \ncollection and reporting mechanisms.

The assessment and health indicator \ndata  suggest  a  solid,  evidence-based \nthe  proposed  equipment.  The \nelectrocardiograph, for example, will help identify underlying heart conditions, which is the leading \ncause of adult mortality. MOH will be able to maintain the equipment, which is suitable for local \nconditions. Providing the equipment together with the training will provide an opportunity for the \n\nrationale \n\nfor \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nPHC  system  to  overcome  key  health  challenges  relating  to  CVD,  antenatal  care,  and  disease \nprevention; and strengthen the country\u2019s health system. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nEconomic.  The  project  will  assist  the  government  in  creating  strategic  and  long-term \nchanges to achieve healthy life expectancy and productivity in the country. The project will directly \nbenefit the rural population, particularly poor and vulnerable groups, including women and girls \nand the medical staff of 793 rural polyclinics. To reflect the true value of the US Dollars (USD), \neconomic benefits  and  costs  are  expressed  in  terms  of  Purchase Power  Parity  (PPP)  at  2017 \nbase rate, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were assumed at 3% of the total equipment \ncost,  and  the  number  of  disability-adjusted  life  years  (DALY)  was  improved  by  10%.30   These \nimprovements are reflected in the economic rate of return of 16.8% and a net present value of \n69.6 million, which indicate that the project is economically viable. \n \n29. \nFinancial. Financial analysis confirmed that the government has the adequate budgetary \nresources to fulfill its financial obligations under the project.31 The total annual project cost as a \nproportion of the government\u2019s total annual expenditure ranges from 0.02% in 2018 to 0.12% in \n2019,  before  decreasing  to  0.01%  in  2021.  As  a  proportion  of  the  government\u2019s  total  health \nexpenditure, the total annual project cost ranges from 0.26 to 0.06% over the same period. The \ntotal  project  cost  is  significantly  less  than  1.0%  of  total  government  health  expenditure.  The \nfinancial sustainability analysis indicated the government has sufficient capacity to cover annual \nO&M costs and debt service requirements beyond the implementation period. Spending on O&M \nis key to maximizing the life of the equipment  being purchased under the loan, and the risk of \nensuring  adequate  financing  for  O&M  needs  to  be  monitored  closely.  The  government  has  a \ndemonstrated  track  record  of  maintaining  the  medical  equipment  which  was  provided  under \nADB\u2019s  previous  health  project  and  have  recently  established  a  National  Maintenance  Center. \nThey have committed to providing post-warranty maintenance through this center and the budget \nallocation for it is outlined in ministerial orders. Except for the ultrasound machine, all equipment \nis considered robust and will require limited O&M over its life. \n \nC. \n \n30. \nThe  financial  management  risk  is  moderate  mainly  because  the  government  has  only \nrecently  introduced  an  internal  audit  system  and  new  measures  for  financial  control  and \naccounting. MOH has extensive experience in the administration of external development partner \nand  donor  funded  projects.  The  head  of  the  JPIB  staff  has  10  years  of  experience  with \ndevelopment partner and donor funded projects. The JPIB continues to coordinate World Bank \nprojects and will be the model for the structure and operations of the PIU for this project. MOH \nand  staff  from  the  States  Investment  Committee  all  have  experience  in  complying  with  ADB \nstandards  for  financial  management  and  procurement.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOH. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 27). \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n30 The DALY measures the overall disease burden, which is expressed as the number of years lost from poor health, \ndisability, or early death. One DALY is considered as one lost year of healthy life. The sum of these DALYs across \nthe  population  can  be  thought  of  as  a  measurement  of  the  gap  between  the  current  health  status  and  an  ideal \nsituation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability. \n\n31 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nD. \n \n31. \nUzbekistan faces complex public health challenges, including socioeconomic inequities, \nescalating health  care costs,  and a  changing  disease profile. Overall,  13.7%  of the  population \nlives below the national poverty line. Health improvements have multiplicative effects in reducing \npoverty,  improving  learning  and  productivity,  and  accelerating  economic  growth.  In  addition, \ninclusive growth, sustainable economic development, and national and regional health aims are \nimportant policy objectives that cannot be achieved without a healthy population, a strong health \nsystem, and reliable PHC services across the country.32 \n \n32. \nThe project has been classified gender equity as a theme because it will directly improve \naccess  of  women  and  girls  to  better  health  services. 33  Gender  is  a  significant  variable  for \nunderstanding the impact of disease and poor health. Women and girls have other health needs \nthan men and boys. Men and women also have different disease vulnerabilities and may have \ndifferent levels of access to or understanding of information on disease prevention and treatment. \nADB\u2019s  country  gender  assessment  for  Uzbekistan  identified  some  of  the  numerous  complex \ngender issues related to health. The paucity of sex-disaggregated data makes it difficult to analyze \ngender-differentiated patterns of access to health care and social protection measures, and acts \nas a critical impediment for targeted and gender-sensitive social policies and health services for \nthe poor.34 \n \nE. \n \n33. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \nclassification  is  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples.35 Environmental impacts during project implementation are expected to be minimal or \nnonexistent. Minimal health care waste may be generated by some of the equipment, but all rural \nfamily polyclinics already have health care waste facilities, policies, and protocols in place, as well \nas sterilization equipment  and  policies and  procedures to  manage  it.  Since  the  project  will  not \ncarry out any civil works, no involuntary resettlement is envisaged. The project will not have an \nimpact on indigenous peoples as defined in the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF. \n \n34. \nThe project\u2019s risk assessment did not identify risks that were rated high. Substantial risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.36 \n \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSafeguards \n\nTable 4: Summary of Substantial Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n3.1  Incomplete financial reporting and \nmonitoring. \nFinancial reporting of income and expenditure is \nnot produced automatically and cannot be easily \nverified for completeness and accuracy by MOH \nmanagement. \n\nMitigation Measures \nUnder new internal audit procedures and recently \nrevised accounting standards, the government has \nput in place specific financial reporting steps to \nensure accurate accounting.
