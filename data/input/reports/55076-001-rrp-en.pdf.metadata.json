(PAGG II, the fund) is a private equity fund established as a Cayman \nIslands exempted limited partnership with an expected size of $500 million. [This information has \nbeen removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, \npara. 17.2.(v)] \n \n3. \nPAGG  II  aims  to  provide  growth  capital  to  a  portfolio  of  10\u201315  companies  operating \nprimarily in the health care, financial services, education, and information technology (IT) sectors \nmainly in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 The investment is in line with the objectives of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to promote private sector development in the PRC, especially \nin  secondary  and  tertiary  markets  such  as  Yantai,  Nanjing,  and  Taizhou  where  equity  capital \navailability is limited, and accessing traditional bank financing without hard assets to pledge as \ncollateral  remains  challenging  for  growing  companies. 2 PAGG  II  is  expected  to  identify  and \nsupport promising and talented business leaders, thereby helping to foster a new generation of \nentrepreneurs  in  the  PRC.  Through  investments  in  IT-related  businesses,  the  fund  is  also \nexpected to promote innovation and technology adoption.3 In terms of value addition, ADB will \nhelp PAGGC to further enhance its environmental and social management system (ESMS) and \nincorporate gender-inclusive practices in its operations. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nDescription.  The  PAG  Group,  a  relatively  well-known  and  established  investment \nmanager  in  the  PRC,  employs  more  than  400  staff,  including  190  investment  professionals, \nacross  10  offices  in  Asia.  The  PAG  Group  manages  investments  across  three  distinct  asset \nclasses\u2014(i) private equity, (ii) real estate, and (iii) absolute returns\u2014each of which is managed \nby separate investment teams. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception \nto disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n5. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n6. \nInvestment identification. ADB first met with the PAG Group in 2016 when it was raising \nPAGG I. Since then, ADB has closely tracked PAGPE and PAGG I\u2019s performance through several \nfollow-up  meetings  and  due  diligence  sessions  with  managing  director  Kevin  Xu,  who  leads \nPAGGC. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n7. \nThrough the investment, ADB seeks to participate in high-growth opportunities in the PRC, \nparticularly  in  \u201cnew  economy\u201d  sectors  that  are  supported  by  secular  consumption  tailwinds. \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n1  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n2  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n3  A climate change target amount cannot be specified as this is an investment into a fund (as opposed to an investment \n\ninto a company) and the composition of the underlying investee companies is not yet known. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nCompanies operating in the new economy are focusing on innovation to update existing or build \nnew business models that improve the quality and accessibility of their products and services, \nincluding in the health care, financial services, and education sectors. The focus on new economy \ninvestments is consistent with the Government of the PRC\u2019s emphasis on policies to boost the \ngrowth of domestic innovative businesses and enhance local capabilities.4 [This information has \nbeen removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, \npara. 17.2.(v)] \n \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nB. \n \n8. \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess  to  Information  Policy,  para.  17.2.(v)]  PAGG  II  seeks  to  invest  in  a  portfolio  of  10\u201315 \ncompanies  primarily  through  equity  and  equity-like  instruments.

PAGG II will form an advisory committee representing PAGG II\u2019s \nlimited partners to be appointed by the general partner. ADB is expected to be represented on \nPAGG II\u2019s advisory committee, which will opine on matters related to certain potential conflicts of \ninterest, exercise its right to consent to certain matters in accordance with the provisions of the \nlimited partnership agreement, and act in a governance advisory role to the general partner and \nits advisor. \n \n\n4  J.

ADB will \nreview this information and follow-up with the general partner if more information or clarification is \nneeded. If the information received  from the general  partner raises issues that could impair the \nvalue of ADB\u2019s investment in PAGG II, ADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more \nfrequent and detailed reviews. \n \nD. \n \n23.  Gender. The general partner and PAGCC have committed to working with ADB to adopt \nmeasures  to  achieve  a  more  gender-equitable  workforce  at  PAGPE  and  the  fund\u2019s  portfolio \ncompanies. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to  disclosure in \nADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n24. \nEnvironmental, social, standards. ADB's participation will obligate the general partner \nto  ensure  that  PAGG  II's  investee  companies  comply  with  ADB's  environment  and  social \nsafeguard standards, and report on development indicators. \n \n25.  Governance  oversight.  ADB,  along  with  other  members  of  PAGG  II's  advisory \ncommittee, will also provide oversight on important governance matters including issues relating \nto conflicts of interest. \n \n26. \nCofinancing opportunities. PAGCC values ADB\u2019s ability to provide both debt and equity \nfinancing  directly  to  its  portfolio  companies  to  fund  growth  plans.

PAGG II is established; capital to support greater economic development in the \nPRC is invested; gender equality at the investee level is improved; and gender inclusiveness at \nthe PAGPE level is enhanced. \n \nB. \n \nConsistency with ADB strategy. The investment in PAGG II aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n36. \n2030  operational  priority  1  (addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities),  which \nmandates  ADB  to  undertake  efforts  to  contribute  to  the  overarching  goal  of  universal  health \ncoverage and to generate quality jobs to support inclusive growth for all.5 This engagement also \naccelerates progress in gender equality, contributing to Strategy 2030 operational priority 2. \n \n37. \nConsistency with country strategies. The investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2021\u20132025, which seeks to address key challenges in adapting \nto an aging society, increasing national and regional health security, promoting food safety and \nsecurity, and delivering quality social services through private sector solutions.6 \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n5  ADB.  2018.

ADB is seeking a right to be excused from contributing capital to any proposed portfolio \ncompany investment (i) that is categorized A across all ADB\u2019s SPS safeguard categories or (ii) \nthat ADB determines is not in accordance with the revised ESMS. The revised ESMS will also \ncontain  requirements,  as  applicable,  for  information  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected \npeople  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.
