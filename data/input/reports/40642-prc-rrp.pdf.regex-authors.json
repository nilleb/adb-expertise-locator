An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nAssessment  undertaken  for  each  of  the  investment  components  under  the \nProject.  The  summary  EIA  was  circulated  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors and uploaded on the website of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) on 14 August 2008. \n   \nProject Description  Wuzhou  city  is  a  medium-sized  city  in  the  Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous Region. Over centuries, Wuzhou has served as a \ngateway  city  and  regional  transportation  center  to  connect \nGuangxi  with  national  and  international  markets,  particularly \nthrough  river  transportation.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \ndevelopment  program,  Wuzhou  will  be  developed  into  a \nmultimode  regional  transportation  hub  through  domestically \nfunded ongoing transportation projects.  \n \nHowever, geological and geographic conditions constrain urban \ndevelopment  in  Wuzhou.  The  city  is  in  a  mountainous  region \ndivided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land \nis  lacking,  the  residents  tended  to  build  their  houses  in  the \nmarginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains \nalong  slopes  of  major  valleys.  The  mountains  in  Wuzhou  are \nmainly formed by loose earth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. \nAs such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters \n(known as geohazards) in the form of landslides, slope collapse, \nand mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely \npopulated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones. \n \nWith support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal \ngovernment  (WMG)  has  made  enormous  investments  to \nstrengthen the control of geological disasters, mainly by building \nand  rehabilitating  of  the  slope  protections  and  retaining  walls. \nHowever, such traditional control measures have not always been \neconomical  and  optimal  solutions.  Under  severe  weather \nconditions,  these  slope  protections  and  retaining  walls  can  be \nwashed away together with houses and other buildings. \n \n ", "ii   \nThe Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project will adopt a \nnew approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The \nbasic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is \na shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, \ngeological disasters are to be prevented through holistic urban \nplanning and integrated public investment. The combination of \nthese efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for \nlong-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in \nthe geohazard-prone valley to the newly developed geohazard-\nfree urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control \nto convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-\nfree land for urban redevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard \nforecasting  and  early  warning  capability  to  improve  the \neffectiveness of the city\u2019s geohazard management system. \n   \nRationale  Wuzhou is a less developed, medium-sized city in western PRC. \nThe  Project  will  help  the  city  deal  with  geohazards\u2013a  major \ndevelopment constraint\u2013and help free thousands of people from \nthe threat of geological disasters. The Project will introduce an \ninnovative  approach  to  address  the  geohazards  in  urban \ndevelopment. The Project is expected to play a demonstration role \nfor many other cities facing similar geological conditions in the \nPRC.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is sustained urban development and \nbetter living standards for the people in Wuzhou. The outcome of \nthe Project is a reduction in the geohazard threat to the life and \nproperty of the Wuzhou people and in the geohazard constraints \nto urban development. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $263.3 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.9 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Source  Amount  % of Total \n($ million equivalent) \nAsian Development Bank  100.0  38.0 \nWuzhou Municipal Government  82.5  31.3 \nChina Construction Bank  80.9  30.7 \n        Total  263.3a  100.0 \n  a Numbers may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n    \n  A loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe  provided  under  its  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility for US dollar \nloans, a commitment charge, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements.  \n \n ", "  iii\n  The ADB loan will finance 38% of the project cost. WMG will \ncofinance 31.3% of the Project cost, while China Construction \nBank will cofinance 30.7%. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will relend loan proceeds to the Guangxi Zhuang \nTerms  Autonomous  Region  government,  which  will  then  onlend  the \nproceeds to WMG. The loan will be relent to WMG on the same \nterms and conditions as those of the ADB loan, with WMG bearing \nthe foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks of the ADB \nloan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Wuzhou municipal government \n   \nImplementation  WMG has established a project leading group, chaired by the \nArrangements  executive  vice  mayor,  to  direct  the  Project  and  provide  policy \nguidance during project implementation. Under the project leading \ngroup, WMG has set up a project management office (PMO) to \nundertake and coordinate the day-to-day activities in connection \nwith  the  Project.  By  entering  into  an  undertaking  agreement, \nWMG  will  designate  Dongtai  State  Assets  Operations \nCorporation\u2014a  company  wholly  owned  by  the  WMG  that \nspecializes in urban construction\u2014to be the implementing agency. \nIt  will  carry  out  the  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project, \nincluding procuring goods and works under the Project. \n   \nProcurement  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding, \nnational competitive bidding, or shopping procedures will be used, \ndepending on the circumstances of each contract package. \n   \nConsulting Services  About 18 person-months of international consulting services and \n108  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be \nprovided under the Project to support the capacity development \nfor  WMG  in  (i)  geohazard  management,  and  (ii)  institutional \nstrengthening  for  project  implementation  and  management. \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit more than 486,000 urban residents \nBeneficiaries  of  Wuzhou  by  reducing  their  vulnerability  to  the  threat  of \ngeohazards,  and  by  addressing  the  geohazard  constraint  to \nsustainable urban development of the city. The Project has two \ninvestment  components  and  one  capacity  development  and \ninstitutional  strengthening  component.  Under  the  investment \ncomponent for Pingminchong valley geohazard resettlement and \n ", "iv   \nprevention, about 6,823 people or 1,816 households\u2014about 52% \nof  whom  are  low-income  families\u2014will  be  evacuated  from  the \ngeohazard-prone  valley  and  relocated  in  a  well-equipped \nresettlement community newly constructed under the Project in a \ngeohazard-free  urban  area.  This  component  will  significantly \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  of  these  residents  by  eliminating  a \nlasting threat to their lives and property.  \n \nThe investment component for Hongling road network and related \ninfrastructure will help Wuzhou meet its short- to medium-term \nurban expansion needs, which are induced by the construction \nand  operation  of  domestically  funded  ongoing  transportation \nprojects for railway, expressways, and river transportation. The \nroad  network  and  related  infrastructure,  once  completed,  will \nprovide the foundation for expanding the city into Hongling, a new \nurban  area  away  from  the  geohazard-prone  valleys.  As \nenvisaged, the urbanization of Hongling will (i) help the city meet \nits urban expansion requirement up to 2020; (ii) accommodate \n100,000  residents  settling  down  in  the  geohazard-free \ncommunities; and (iii) create thousands of new jobs, mainly in the \nservice sector.  \n \nThe  geohazard  forecasting  and  early  warning  system  to  be \nintroduced and established under the capacity development and \ninstitutional strengthening component will provide Wuzhou with a \nstronger geohazard management system. This will significantly \nenhance the city\u2019s capability to avoid geological disasters. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks. \nConventional engineering designs with proven records of reliable \nperformance will be adopted for construction of the resettlement \ncommunity and road network, and for installation of the related \nmunicipal infrastructure along the roads.  \n \nThe challenge of relocating a large quantity of households may \npose  a  risk  to  the  Project.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  detailed \nresettlement plans have been prepared for the two investment \ncomponents under the Project, strictly following ADB resettlement \nsafeguards  policy  and  participatory  consultation  procedures. \nSubstantial consulting inputs have been included in the capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening component to provide \nguidance and technical support for WMG. This will help ensure \nappropriate implementation of the resettlement plans following the \nADB resettlement safeguards policy requirements.  \n \nAnother risk might arise from inappropriate engineering design \nand/or  irresponsible  engineering  treatment  for  the  geohazard \nprevention measures to be undertaken by the Project. WMG has \nassured  that  all  the  engineering  design  and  treatment  for \ngeohazard  prevention  measures  will  strictly  follow  the  national \ndesign  and  engineering  standards  for  geohazard  control  and \n ", "  v\nprevention  works.  The  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening component also includes the provision of expertise \nin geohazard engineering safety to provide guidance and stronger \nquality control.  \n \nCompared with the threat of geohazards to the life and property of \npeople  in  Wuzhou,  and  their  constraint  on  the  development \nopportunities of the city, the integrated benefits and impacts of the \nProject are expected to outweigh the costs. The identified risks \nare manageable, given the mitigation measures provided. \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "106 o 00'E 111o  00'E\nGUANGXI WUZHOU URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nH U N A  N\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n26 o 00'N G U I Z H O U 26 o 00'N\nGuilin\nHechi\nYizhou\nLipu\nLiuzhou Guijiang \nY U N N A N Baise River\nG U A N G X I Xunjiang R.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project. \n \n2.  The Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help promote the \nurban development of Wuzhou city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region by addressing \none major development constraint\u2014geohazards in the form of landslide, slope collapse, and \nmud and debris flow.1 This report is based on the results of the loan processing missions, as \nwell as discussions with the central and local governments, relevant agencies, and community \norganizations.2 The design and monitoring framework of the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Since the PRC initiated economic reforms in 1978, sustained economic growth has been \naccompanied by rapid urbanization. The urban population increased from about 190 million or \n19.6% of total population in 1980 to more than 560 million or 42.9%, in 2005. Through the \nimplementation of the Five Year Plan (FYP) for 2006\u20132010, the PRC envisages a continuation \nof this urbanization process in a cautious yet steady manner.3 The aim is to establish a more \nbalanced economic structure under an integrated market system comprising metropolitans, city \nclusters, and small and medium-sized cities to serve as the national or regional growth centers \nto  promote  sustained  development  across  the  country.  The  World  Bank  estimated  that \nurbanization in the PRC could pass the 60% mark by 2020, with 200 million or more rural \npeople  joining  the  urban  population. 4  The  rapid  urbanization  requires  continued  public \ninvestment to support urban expansion, as well as to address the development constraints \nfaced by the cities in the PRC. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC 2008\u20132010 \nidentifies direct support for sound and sustainable urban development as one major operational \nfocus. 5  It  emphasizes  resolving  constraints  to  sustained  urban  development  or  urban \nenvironmental improvement in the smaller cities, particularly those in the less developed interior \nprovinces and autonomous regions. \n \n4.  As a continental country with mountains and mountainous lands accounting for 65% of \nits total land area, the PRC is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to geological \ndisasters. During 1995\u20132005, geological disasters, on average, killed 1,108 people and caused \ndirect economic losses of CNY5.9 billion each year. All the provinces and autonomous regions \nare affected by recurrent geological disasters, most commonly landslides, slope collapse, and \nmud and debris flow. Given the high concentration of human settlements and economic assets \n                                                 \n1  Geohazard is a term commonly used to describe many different geological phenomena, including earthquakes, \nslope collapse, landslide, and mud and debris flow. In the PRC, public interventions for the prevention and \nrehabilitation of earthquake-induced disasters are subject to a set of specialized laws and regulations. In this \nreport, the term geohazard covers only the geological phenomena of slope collapse, landslides, and mud and \ndebris flow, which are the most common geohazards in Wuzhou and many other cities under similar geological \nconditions in the PRC.    \n2  The Project was prepared with support of technical assistance approved in August 2007: ADB. 2007.

The Government has formulated the 11th five-year program for prevention and control of \ngeohazard (FYP-PCG) for 2006\u20132010, which establishes the goals and principles for combating \ngeohazards across the country.6 Following a review of the experiences and lessons from past \npublic interventions,  the  FYP-PCG  highlights the  principle  of  the  \u201cprevention  first\u201d  and  the \nimportance of incorporating the geohazard prevention into the overall development process. \nLike many other cities in less-developed mountainous areas of the PRC, Wuzhou suffers from \npermanent  exposure  to  frequent  geohazards.  By  working  with  ADB  on  the  Project,  the \nGovernment  is  seeking  knowledge  input  and  financial  support  to  address  one  common \nconstraint to sustained urban development. The Project, which is designed in line with the FYP-\nPCG, is expected to play a demonstration role for other cities under similar geological conditions \nin the PRC.  \n  \n6.  Wuzhou is a medium-sized city in the eastern part of Guangxi, one of the 12 less-\ndeveloped western provinces and autonomous regions that the Government is supporting under \nthe  National  Strategy  for  Development  of  the  West  (NSDW).  The  Wuzhou  municipal \ngovernment (WMG) has three urban districts, three rural counties, and one county and/or city \nunder its jurisdiction, covering a total of 12,588 square kilometers (km2) and with a population of \n3.11 million. For this Project, Wuzhou refers to the city proper, comprising the three urban \ndistricts only. Wuzhou has an urban population of 486,000 and a developed urban area of 50 \nkm2. The city is at the intersection of two major rivers\u2014Xunjiang River and Guijiang River, which \nare then merged into Xijiang River\u2014the upstream section of Zhujiang River (i.e., Pearl River) for \nthe Pearl River Delta\u2014one major growth engine of the PRC. Wuzhou has existed for more than \n2,000  years.  Over  centuries,  Wuzhou  has  served  as  a  gateway  city  and  a  regional \ntransportation hub connecting Guangxi with the national and international markets, particularly \nthrough river transportation.  \n \n7.  With support from the Government under the NSDW, Wuzhou has developed rapidly, \nmainly by strengthening its economic integration with the Pearl River Delta. From 2000 to 2005, \nWuzhou\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew on average 11.3% per year, compared with the \nnational average of 9.5%. The urban population of Wuzhou increased from 373,700 to 486,000, \nin that period, accompanied by an average increase in urban per capita disposable income of \n10.9% per year, compared with the national average of 10.6%.  \n \n8.  The 11th FYP for 2006\u20132010 envisages Wuzhou developing further into a regional \nmultimode transportation center to connect Guangxi with the Pearl River Delta through six \nongoing domestically funded major transport projects: three expressway projects, two railway \nprojects, and one river transport strengthening project. A significant urban expansion is required \nto accommodate these new infrastructure facilities, as well as to support their operations. The \nWuzhou  City  Development  Master  Plan  (2000\u20132020),  approved  by  the  Wuzhou  People\u2019s \nCongress,  envisages  the  city  to  have  a  developed  urban  area  of  80  km2  and  an  urban \npopulation of 800,000 by 2020. A strategic analysis of the challenges and opportunities for \nurban development in Wuzhou is in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Land and Resources. 2007. 11th Five Year Program for Prevention and Control of Geohazard.

The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big \nrivers. The city proper is on the north bank of the Xunjiang River, which is further divided by \nGuijiang River into the old urban center on the east side and a fast-growing new urban center \non the west side. The south bank of Xunjiang and/or Xijiang River7 has not been developed. \nBefore the development of the new urban area on the west side of the Guijiang River in the \n1980s, flat land available around the old urban center was limited. As a result, the residents \ntended to build their houses in the marginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the \nmountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose \nearth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological \ndisasters in the form of landslides, slope collapse, and mud and debris flows. Many of these \nvalleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones.  \n \n10.  With support from the central Government and autonomous region government, the \nWMG has made enormous investments to strengthen the control of geological disasters over \nthe past 50 years. Numerous engineering control projects have been implemented to stabilize \nthe mountain slopes by building and rehabilitating the slope protections and retaining walls. \nThese  measures  have  played  an  important  role  in  combating  geohazards.  However,  such \ntraditional control and prevention measures, particularly the repeated building of the slope \nprotections  and  retaining  walls,  have  not  always  been  economical  and  optimal  solutions. \nDespite the existence of concrete retaining walls, people living in the geohazard-prone valleys \nremain vulnerable to landslides. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and \nretaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings. On 8 June 2006, \na strong rainstorm hit Wuzhou, which triggered 181 landslides, 48 slope collapses, and 64 mud \nand debris flows. The geological disaster killed 12 people, wounded 26, and affected 21,673. It \nalso caused extensive damage to the city, including destroying 825 residential buildings with an \nestimated direct economic loss of CNY30 million. To strengthen urban sustainability and to \nprovide the people with safe and more secure living conditions, Wuzhou needs to adopt a new \napproach to combat geohazards more effectively.  \n \n11.  Based  on  the  experience  and  lessons  from  the  past,  and  taking  into  account \ninternational best practice, the WMG will adopt a new approach under the Project to combating \nthe geohazard concerns of the city. The basic principle of the new approach to geohazard \nmanagement is a shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, geological \ndisasters  are  to  be  prevented  through  holistic  urban  planning  and  integrated  public \ninterventions. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning \nfor long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone zone to \nthe  newly  developed  geohazard-free  urban  area,  (iii)  engineering measures  for  geohazard \ncontrol to convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into a geohazard-free land for urban \nredevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve \nthe effectiveness of the city\u2019s geohazard management system.  \n \n12.  Rationale. Wuzhou is a less-developed, medium-sized city in western PRC. The city \nhas reached a critical stage of urban development as it grows into a multimodal transportation \ncenter to further strengthen the economic integration of Guangxi and its neighboring western \nprovinces with the Pearl River Delta. The Project will help WMG address geohazards\u2014one \n                                                 \n7  The upper stream of the Xijiang River is called the Xunjiang before it meets the Guijiang River at the intersection in \nWuzhou. \n ", "4 \nmajor development constraint\u2014and help free thousands of people from the threat of geological \ndisasters. The Project is consistent with the ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for PRC, which \nspecifies that ADB will directly support sound and sustainable urban development with a focus \non relatively underdeveloped areas in western and northeastern PRC (footnote 5). Furthermore, \nthe Project will introduce an innovative approach to addressing geohazards. It is expected to \nplay a demonstration role for many other cities facing similar geological conditions in the less- \ndeveloped western part of the PRC.  \n \n13.  Policy Dialogue. One increasingly challenging task related to the rapid urbanization in \nthe PRC is satisfying the need for urban expansion need through properly designed land use \nmanagement, and well-compensated land acquisition and resettlement arrangements. In line \nwith the principle of achieving a harmonious society set forth for the 11th FYP, the Government \nhas introduced many new policy initiatives to strengthen land use management and to assist \nlocal governments in improving their management of land acquisition and resettlement. As \nWuzhou is a fast-growing city, the WMG has gained rich experience in handling land acquisition \nand  resettlement  for  urban  expansion  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  national  laws  and \nregulations. In Guangxi, Wuzhou is regarded as a city of best practice for land acquisition and \nresettlement. The Project has provided WMG with a good opportunity to learn from ADB the \nresettlement safeguard policies and requirements to further improve their work.  \n \n14.  The Project has two investment components, both involving relocation of people. Under \none component, the Project beneficiaries are to be moved out of a geohazard-prone valley and \nrelocated  in  a  geohazard-free  new  resettlement  community.  Under  the  other  component, \nproject-affected persons are to be relocated because of the construction of the road network \nand related infrastructure to promote the urban expansion into the geohazard-free area. The \nWMG,  recognizing  that  appropriate  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  the key  to  project \nsuccess, agreed that all land acquisition and resettlement under the Project\u2014including the \nrelocation  of  the  project  beneficiaries\u2014should  conform  strictly  to  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). Furthermore, the resettlement plan prepared for the road network \nconstruction  will  establish  the  same  resettlement  principles,  compensation  standards, \nconsultation procedures, and implementation plan for the lands and resettlements required for \nroad network construction and the neighboring urban lands to be developed with the road \nnetwork.  \n \n15.  During loan processing, ADB and WMG conducted a continual and extensive dialogue \non urban development strategy for Wuzhou, focusing on prioritizing and sequencing the planned \nurban development activities in accordance with the urban expansion needs of the city and the \nfinancing capability of WMG. Through a joint review of the urban development momentum, as \nwell as an in-depth assessment of economic and financial viability of the Project, WMG agreed \nto divide the proposed urban expansion plan into two phases. The first phase will prioritize \nsupport for the city expansion into a geohazard-free area on the northern bank of Xunjiang \nRiver. Urban expansion is continuing in this area because of the construction and operation of \nkey transport infrastructure, such as the long distance bus terminal and the railway station. \nDevelopment of the southern bank of the Xunjiang River, including building a new bridge across \nthe river and constructing the road network and related municipal infrastructure, could be started \nin the second phase, after adequate development of the northern bank. Instead of spreading \nlimited financial resources across all the planned urban development activities, the Project has \nincluded only the highest priority development activities planned for the city. Through such \ndialogue, the WMG has managed to plan the urban development through a well-coordinated \nsequence of phases, and keep the capital investment, physical construction, environmental \n ", "5 \nimpact, and land acquisition and resettlement requirement of the Project within its financing and \nproject management capability.  \n \n16.  Through  decades  of  combating  geological  disasters,  Wuzhou  has  developed  an \ninstitutionalized geohazard management system comprising the leadership of the WMG, the \ngeohazard emergency center of WMG, the meteorological station, district governments, and the \ncommunities and households in the geohazard-prone valleys. During the rainy season, almost \nall slopes in the geohazard-prone zone are closely monitored by designated households or \nindividuals through a community-based geohazard monitoring and alarming system. The system \nhas been effective in responding to emergencies. However, one shortcoming of the system is its \nlack of geohazard forecasting and early warning capability. Most of the geohazard events are \ndetected through mass observations conducted by communities and households alerted by \nmeteorological forecast and mobilized by rainfalls. On the advice of ADB, the WMG agreed to \nadd one new component to the Project\u2014the introduction and establishment of a geohazard \nforecasting and early warning system to strengthen the geohazard management of the city. A \nmore detailed assessment of geohazard management in Wuzhou is in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  External Assistance. ADB has supported urban development in the PRC (Appendix 4). \nIn support of the NSDW of the Government, ADB has also provided development assistance for \nGuangxi,  particularly  through  lending  for  investment  projects  in  transport  and  urban \ndevelopment.8 The Project will be the first urban development project prepared with support \nfrom  a  multilateral  development  bank  in  Wuzhou.  The  WMG  appreciated  the  international \nknowledge  and  experiences  that  ADB  brought  in  the  fields  of  urban  planning,  geohazard \nmanagement, and project design and management in addition to the financial support to be \nprovided for the Project. \n \n18.  Lessons.  ADB-financed  urban  development  and  urban  environmental  improvement \nprojects in the PRC generally perform well. Urban development requires an integrated and \nmultisector approach. In the PRC, urban development activities in a city are guided by a \ncomprehensive city development master plan prepared for a time frame of 15\u201320 years, which \nis updated from time to time as appropriate. Guided by such a city master plan, holistic urban \nplanning and integrated public investment may be effective instruments in strengthening urban \nsustainability, improving human settlement, and improving urban environment. However, within \nan approved city master plan, development activities still need to be carefully prioritized and \nsequenced in view of development momentum of the city, as well as the financing and project \nmanagement capability of the city government. Policy dialogue during loan processing has \nallowed for a continual optimization of the urban development program for Wuzhou to maximize \nits development impact.  \n \n19.  Land acquisition and resettlement is a challenge to many urban development projects \nthat may affect loan processing and implementation. Lessons from urban development projects \nin the PRC indicate that ADB\u2019s resettlement safeguard policy and operational requirements \nshould be introduced as a sample of international good practice to help the concerned municipal \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

This approach has facilitated a candid and constructive policy \ndialogue with WMG in preparing the resettlement plan for the Project in line with the \u201cpeople-\ncentered\u201d  principle  advocated  by  the  Government  and  in  conformity  with  ADB  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy.    \n \n20.  ADB evaluation studies have highlighted relevant lessons for loan processing including \nthe need to (i) encourage broad reforms, (ii) ensure counterpart funding for operation and \nmaintenance, (iii) consult the public and involved community in project design, (iv) address the \nresettlement issues at the early stage of processing, and (v) avoid start-up delays. These \nlessons have been considered in policy dialogue with the Government and the WMG, and are \nincorporated in the design of the proposed Project.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n21.  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  sustained  urban  development  and  higher  living \nstandards in Wuzhou. The impact will be measured by the achievement of sustained economic \ngrowth in the city, sustained growth of per capita income of city residents, steady urbanization, \nless vulnerability of the city to geohazards, and more effective geohazard management system. \nThe outcome of the Project will be a reduction in the geohazard threat to life and property of \npeople living in Wuzhou, and a reduction in the geohazard constraint on urban development. \nThe outcome will be measured by fewer households living in the geohazard-prone zone, more \ngeohazard-free lands for urban development, more urban road and municipal infrastructure \nfacilities, and stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n22.  The Project will have three major components generating the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Pingminchong  valley  geohazard  resettlement  and  prevention.  This \ncomponent will involve (a) building a resettlement community in Zaochong\u2014a \ngeohazard-free urban area, to be equipped with quality housing and municipal \ninfrastructure to accommodate about 6,823 people or 1,816 households to be \nevacuated from the geohazard-prone Pingminchong valley; and (b) undertaking \ngeohazard-control  engineering  measures  to  convert  the  evacuated \nPingminchong valley into geohazard-free lands with a total area of about 20 \nhectares (ha) for urban redevelopment. \n \n(ii)  Hongling road network and related infrastructure. This component will entail \nbuilding a comprehensive 36.2-kilometer urban road network together with the \nrelated  municipal  infrastructure,  including  drainage  pipelines,  sewers,  public \ngreen areas, lighting, and traffic management facilities, to promote and facilitate \nthe urban expansion into the geohazard-free Hongling\u2014a new urban area of \nabout 540 ha on the northern bank of Xunjiang between the newly constructed \nrailway station and the fully developed urban area. \n \n(iii)  Capacity development and institutional building. This component will involve \n(a)  developing  and  establishing  a  geographic  forecasting  and  early  warning \nsystem  that  is  compatible  with  a  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  to \n ", "7 \nstrengthen the geohazard management of the city, and (b) providing technical \nsupport,  including  relevant  training  in  urban  planning  and  geohazard \nmanagement for the WMG and the project implementing agency to strengthen \ntheir  capacity  to  meet  the  operational  requirements  of  the  Project  during \nimplementation.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  specialized  consulting \nservices under this component to improve public awareness of geohazards and \ngeohazard  management  through  the  existing  community-based  geohazard \nmonitoring and alarming system. \n \nC.  Special Features \n23.  Innovative  Approach  to  Geohazard  Prevention.  The  traditional  mechanism  for \ngeohazard  management  relies  entirely  on  budget  support  from  the  central  and  local \ngovernments. It does not have any self-financing capability. The Government\u2019s long lasting \nfinancial constraints have limited public interventions only to emergency response and post-\ndisaster  rehabilitation  by  providing  assistance  for  disaster  relief  and  rehabilitation  of  the \ndamaged retaining walls. The budgetary resources available determined and constrained the \nlevel of rehabilitation and protection. Under the Project, a new mechanism will be introduced to \nshift geohazard management from disaster rehabilitation to disaster avoidance and prevention, \nand to introduce a self-financing element into geohazard management through integrated urban \nplanning and well coordinated urban development. \n \n24.  Under the Pingminchong component, people living in this geohazard-prone valley will be \nevacuated and relocated to a newly built resettlement community in a geohazard-free urban \narea, freeing them from geohazard threat. In the evacuated Pingminchong valley, engineering \nmeasures will include (i) cutting the mountain slopes to a degree that is safe and free of \nlandslidea, (ii) filling up the valley into carefully designed terraces, and (iii) installing an effective \ndrainage system to divert the storm water and protect the treated terraces from erosion. These \nengineering measures will convert the geohazard-prone Pingminchong valley into a geohazard-\nfree land. The WMG will then auction off the treated land for urban redevelopment. The WMG \nplans to use the revenue from the sale, after deduction of the costs for geohazard control \ntreatment, to set up a revolving mechanism to finance future geohazard control and prevention \nprojects of the other geohazard-prone valleys in the city. In this connection, a special study was \nconducted on the land market in Wuzhou, which confirmed that all the land transactions for \nurban development in Wuzhou since 2003 have been conducted through transparent market \noperations in the form of a tender, auction, or public listing. Land reforms in PRC, particularly \nthe strengthening of the legal framework for land transactions, have provided an enabling \nenvironment for the proposed revolving financing mechanism.9 A detailed analysis of the land \nmarket for urban development in Wuzhou is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n25.  The revolving financing mechanism attempts to incorporate geohazard prevention into \noverall urban development through holistic urban planning and integrated public investments. \nThis approach is expected to prevent disasters, improve human settlements, and redevelop \nurban areas. This approach would not be possible without sizeable lending support from ADB to \ncomplement  the  WMG  investment  to  first  build  a  well-serviced  resettlement  community  to \nreceive the relocated households from the geohazard-threatened Pingminchong valley. \n \n                                                 \n9  The legal framework for land market development in the PRC has evolved over the past 20 years. It includes, \namong other things, the Amendment to the Constitution (1988), Enactment of the Property Rights Law (2007), and \nIssuance of the Decree on Transfer of Construction Land Use Rights through Tender, Auction and Listing (2007).  \n ", "8 \n26.  Geohazard  Forecasting  and  Early  Warning  System.  Based  on  an  existing \ncomputerized  GIS  for  land  resources  management  in  Wuzhou,  and  taking  into  account \ninternational best practice, the Project will help WMG (i) use information and communication \ntechnology  to  establish  a  centralized  GIS-compatible,  real-time  monitoring  and  reporting \nnetwork to supplement the existing community-based mass observation mechanism for the \ngeohazard-prone  zones  of  the  city;  (ii)  develop  a  computer-based  dynamic  geohazard \nsimulation and forecasting model, based on meteorological data and geohazard monitoring \ndata, to provide technical support for early warning service against geohazards; and (iii) provide \nan integrated decision-making system for geohazard monitoring, early warning, and emergency \nresponse to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the geohazard management system of \nthe  city.  This  will  be  one  of  the  first  such  systems  to  be  introduced  to  strengthen  urban \ngeohazard management in the PRC.   \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n27.  The project is estimated to cost $263.3 million, including taxes and duties of $4.9 million. \nTable 1 provides a summary of the project investment plan.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta\nA.

Financing Plan \n28.  The Government has requested a loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility for US dollar loans, a commitment charge, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government \nhas provided ADB with (i) its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n ", "9 \n \n29.  The ADB loan will finance 38% of the project cost, including the base cost, the financing \ncharges  during  implementation,  and  the  taxes  and  duties  associated  with  the  project \nexpenditures.10 As  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  Government,  for  the  subcomponent  of \nconstruct the resettlement community in Zaochong (para. 22), the ADB loan will be used to \nfinance the construction of basic public infrastructure only, including site preparation, roads, \nwater supply and sewage pipelines. Domestic counterpart funds will be used to finance the \nconstruction  of  the  housing  facilities.  The  WMG  has  obtained  a  commitment  from  China \nConstruction Bank (CCB) to provide a loan of $80.9 million to finance 30.7% of the project cost. \nThe  CCB  loan  will  have  a  term  of  10  years,  including  a  grace  period  equivalent  to  the \nimplementation period of the Project; it will be provided in the national currency at an interest \nrate of 7.83% per year. The WMG has provided a commitment letter to confirm (i) timely \nprovision of adequate counterpart funds totaling $82.5 million, or 31.3% of the project cost; and \n(ii) provision of additional counterpart funding to cover any funding shortfalls that may occur \nduring project implementation. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. Detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Totala    % \nAsian Development Bank  100.0    38.0 \nWuzhou Municipal Government  82.5    31.3 \nChina Construction Bank  80.9    30.7 \n       Total  263.3    100.0 \na Numbers may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n30.  The Borrower is the PRC. The Government will relend the loan proceeds to the Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region government (GZARG), which in turn will onlend the proceeds to \nthe WMG. The loan will be onlent to the WMG on the same terms and conditions as those of the \nADB loan, with the WMG bearing the foreign exchange and interest rate risks of the ADB loan. \nThe chart for flow of funds through relending arrangements within the government system is in \nAppendix 6.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n31.  The  WMG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project  leading  group  headed  by  the \nexecutive vice-mayor has been established to provide overall guidance and support for the \npreparation and implementation of the Project. Under the project leading group, the WMG has \nestablished a project management office (PMO) to undertake and coordinate the day-to-day \nactivities of the Project. By entering into an undertaking agreement, the WMG will designate \nDongtai State Assets Operations Corporation\u2014a company wholly owned by the WMG that \nspecializes in urban construction\u2014as the implementing agency (IA) to carry out the day-to-day \nimplementation of the Project, including procuring goods and works under the Project. The \nundertaking agreement will include the requirements and obligations in the Loan Agreement and \nProject  Agreement  applicable  to  the  IA.  The  chart  for  implementation  arrangements  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n                                                 \n10  Project-associated taxes and duties are estimated at $4.95 million, or about 1.9% of the total cost, which are not \nexcessively high yet a material part of the project costs.  \n ", "10 \n   \n2.  Implementation Period \n32.  The Project will be implemented over about 5 years from March 2009 to June 2014. The \ndetailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n33.  The procurement of goods and works financed under the loan will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts for goods estimated to exceed $1.0 million and contracts for works estimated to \nexceed $10.0 million will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. \nContracts for goods and for works estimated to cost the same or less than the ICB values, but \nmore than $100,000 will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures, in \naccordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), subject to modifications agreed \nupon with ADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be \nprocured using shopping procedures. For contracts to be procured through ICB procedures, \nprocurement  documents  including  invitations  for  bids,  invitations  for  prequalification,  draft \nprequalification documents, draft bidding documents, and prequalification and bid evaluation \nreports, are to be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval. For contracts to be procured \nthrough NCB procedures, the first draft English language version of the procurement documents \nshould be submitted for ADB review and approval regardless of the estimated contract amount. \nThe ADB-approved procurement documents should then be used as a model for all NCB \nprocurement financed by ADB for the Project, and need not be reviewed further. ADB will review \nthe bid evaluation report and award of contract on a post-review basis. For contracts to be \nprocured using shopping procedures, ADB will review the award of contracts on a post-review \nbasis. The procurement plan for the Project is in Appendix 9.  \n \n34.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  Dongtai  confirmed  that  the  IA  is  generally \ncapable  of conducting the  procurement  for  the  Project. However,  it  will  need  training  and \ntechnical  support  to  understand  and  become  familiar  with  ADB  policy  and  procedural \nrequirements set out in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The details of the capacity assessment \nare provided as part of the financial analysis appendix (Appendix 13). \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n35.  The Project will fund 18 person-months of international consulting services and 108 \nperson-months of national consulting services to support the capacity development of the WMG \nin (i) geohazard management, and (ii) institutional strengthening for project implementation and \nmanagement. The consultants will be recruited through one consulting firm to be selected in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), using the quality- and cost-based selection method at the quality-to-cost ratio of 80:20 \nwith full technical proposal procedures. Consulting services are required for (i) designing and \ndeveloping a GIS-compatible geohazard forecasting and early warning system; (ii) providing \nproject implementation and management support for PMO and IA; and (iii) conducting training \nfor capacity development of the WMG, particularly in urban development, project management, \nand geohazard management. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services is in \nAppendix 10. \n \n ", "11 \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n36.  To expedite project implementation, the WMG has requested for advance contracting for \nthe recruitment of consulting services, as well as for the procurement of goods and civil works. It \nalso asked for retroactive financing to cover eligible expenditures not exceeding $20 million, \nwhich equals 20% of the loan amount, incurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 \nmonths before the signing of the Loan Agreement. All advance contracting will be undertaken in \nconformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB \nmust approve the issuance of invitations to bid or to prequalify under advance contracting. \nContracts  proposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  The  Government,  GZARG,  and  WMG  have  been  advised  that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n  \n6.  Governance and Anticorruption Policy \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, GZARG, WMG, and the IA. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan covenants and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the GZARG, WMG, and the IA, and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. For \nthe Project, the GZARG and WMG will undertake the following anticorruption actions: \n \n(i)  to  involve  the  agencies  responsible  for  oversight  of  the  IA  in  bidding  and \nconstruction to enhance construction quality control and supervise effective work; \n(ii)  to introduce a dual-signing system in which the civil works contract winner also \nsigns an anticorruption contract with the employer; \n(iii)  to periodically inspect the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements; \n(iv)  to engage a project management consultant to support the PMO and the IA to \nensure  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency  in  project \nimplementation;  \n(v)  to consult with the concerned central Government agencies to update the local \nlaws  and  regulations  on  local  and  corporate  governance  and  anticorruption \nmeasures; and  \n(vi)  to disclose the information on contract awards on the project website of the WMG \nand in the audit report on the financial statements and project accounts following \nthe relevant laws and regulations of PRC. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n38.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate project \nimplementation  through  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds,  GZARG  will  establish an  imprest \naccount  promptly  after  loan  effectiveness  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nFinance Bureau of the GZARG will administer the imprest account. The initial amount to be \ndeposited in the imprest account will not exceed the estimated expenditures for the succeeding \n ", "12 \n6 months to be funded from the imprest account, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \nTo expedite flow of funds and simplify the documentation process, the ADB statement-of-\nexpenditure procedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of the imprest account, \nand for reimbursement of eligible expenditures not exceeding $200,000 per individual payment. \nThe payments in excess of the statement-of-expenditure ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, \nor replenished based on full supporting documentation. The civil works contracts under the \nProject will be paid using direct payment procedures for such expenditures. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n39.  As the IA, Dongtai will keep records to allow the identification of goods and services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds, following accounting principles and practices prescribed by the \nPRC  Accounting  Law.  The  law  requires  financial  statements  to  be  prepared  following \ninternationally recognized accounting standards. Dongtai will set up and maintain separate \nproject accounts and records. The financial statements of the project accounts and the annual \ncorporate financial statement for Dongtai will be subject to external audit by the Wuzhou Audit \nBureau, the Guangxi Audit Bureau, and the State Audit Administration. The audits will be carried \nout in accordance with the audit regulations of the PRC, and will meet ADB requirements. The \naudit reports should include a separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditures. Dongati\u2019s annual audited financial statements and audited project \naccounts will be submitted to ADB no later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year \nthroughout the implementation period.  \n \n40.  The WMG and Dongtai will submit reports and information to ADB concerning the use of \nthe loan proceeds, project implementation, and IA performance. These reports will include (i) \nquarterly progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; and (iii) a project \ncompletion report, which should be submitted not later than 3 months after the completion of the \nproject facilities. Through the preparation and submission of quarterly progress reports, the \nPMO will report the progress made, problems encountered during the period under review, \nsteps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the proposed program for the planned project \nimplementation activities, and progress expected in the following 6 months.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n41.  The project performance monitoring system (PPMS) indicators, their relevance, and \nmonitoring  practicalities  have  been  discussed  with  WMG  and  Dongtai  during  project \npreparation. The impact indicators, as specified in the design and monitoring framework, will \ninclude (i) GDP growth, (ii) urban population and per capita income, (iii) proportion of urban \nresidents living in geohazard-prone areas, and (iv) availability and reliability of the geohazard \nforecasting and early warning services. At the start of project implementation, the PMO and \nDongtai, with support from the project implementation consultant, will develop comprehensive \nPPMS procedures to generate data systematically on project outcome, inputs and outputs of \neach component, as well as the agreed-upon employment indicators, environmental monitoring \nindicators, and resettlement plan implementation indicators. These will be used to measure the \nproject impact, outcome, output, and compliance with ADB safeguard policy requirements. The \nPMO will (i) refine the PPMS framework, (ii) establish the baseline, (iii) confirm achievable \ntargets, (iv) finalize the monitoring and recording arrangements, and (v) establish data collection \nsystems and reporting procedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. In the design \nand development of the PPMS framework, special attention will be paid to the demonstration \neffect  of  the  Project,  which  should  enable  systematic  data  collection  and  analysis  for \ndissemination of the lessons and experiences to cities beyond Wuzhou. \n ", "13 \n \n10.  Project Review \n42.  ADB and the Government will review project implementation jointly at least once a year. \nIn addition, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive midterm review 2 years \nafter the start of project implementation. This midterm review will include a detailed evaluation of \nthe scope, implementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and \nprogress on the agenda for policy reform and capacity development measures. Feedback from \nthe PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n43.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  more  than  486,000  urban  residents  of  Wuzhou  by \nreducing  their  vulnerability  to  geohazard,  and  by  addressing  the  geohazard  constraint  to \nsustainable urban development of the city. Under the Pingminchong component, about 6,823 \npeople or 1,816 households, about 52% of whom are low-income families, will be evacuated \nfrom the geohazard-prone valley and relocated in a well-serviced resettlement community newly \nconstructed under the Project in a geohazard-free urban area. This component will significantly \nimprove the quality of life of these residents by eliminating a lasting threat to their life and \nproperty.  \n \n44.  The  Hongling  component  will  help  Wuzhou  meet  its  short-  to  medium-term  urban \nexpansion needs, which are induced by the construction and operation of transportation projects \nfor railway, expressway, and river transportation. The road network and related infrastructure, \nonce completed, will provide the foundation for the expansion of the city into Hongling, a new \nurban area away from the geohazard-prone valleys. As envisaged, the urbanization of the \nHongling  area  will  help  the  city  meet  its  urban  expansion  requirement  up  to  2020, \naccommodating 100,000 residents in the geohazard-free communities and creating thousands \nof new jobs, mainly in the service sector for the city.  \n \n45.  The geohazard forecasting and early warning system to be introduced and established \nunder the Project will provide Wuzhou with a stronger geohazard management system. This will \nallow for an early warning service against geohazard events, thus significantly enhancing the \ncity\u2019s capability to prevent geological disasters. \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n46.  Overall, the land acquisition and resettlement impact of the Project will be significant. \nResettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  each  of  the  investment  components:  (i)  the \nPingminchong geohazard resettlement and prevention, and (ii) the Hongling road network and \nrelated infrastructure. The implementation of the Project will affect two rural villages, two urban \nresident communities, one village administration office and one township, and two districts. \nPermanent land acquisition will affect 862 households or 3,856 persons (635 urban dwellers \nand 3,221 rural dwellers). The demolition of residential structures will affect 2,105 households or \n7,081 persons living in private houses under the administration of the resident and village \ncommittees. Further, 15 institutions, 16 enterprises, and seven shops with 1,751 persons will be \nrelocated because of nonresidential structure demolition. Project construction will permanently \n ", "14 \naffect about 2,393 mu (667 square meters) of state- and collective-owned land, of which 272 mu \n(11.37%) is classified as farmland; and 188,038.13 square meters (m2) of residential houses \nand 25,022.01 m2 of nonresidential structures of institutions, enterprises and shops (5,845 m2 \nused for residential purpose and 19,177.01 m2 for nonresidential purpose) will be demolished. In \naddition, some productive assets, ground attachments, and basic infrastructure and special \nfacilities will also be affected. Of the total affected population, 383 households or 1,091 persons \nare from vulnerable groups, including 161 households with residential area of less than 12 m2 \nper  capita,  118  households  headed  by  women,  32  households  with  disabled  persons,  42 \nhouseholds living under the minimum living guarantee (MLG), and 26 households with \u201cfive \nguarantees\u201d.11 Land acquisition or resettlement will not affect any ethnic minority households.  \n \n47.  Both  resettlement  plans  have  been  formulated  through  participatory  consultations \nfollowing the relevant laws and regulations of the PRC, and in conformity with ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy. For permanent acquisition of farmland, 30% of land compensation will be \npaid in cash to the affected villages and 70% of land compensation to the project-affected \npersons. The resettlement subsidy and compensation for standing crops will be fully paid to the \naffected  persons.  For  residential  houses  and  nonresidential  buildings  (i.e.,  institutions, \nenterprises, and shops) that are to be demolished, compensation will be paid to the owners, \nincluding those without house certificates. The payment will be made in cash according to the \nappraised value of the property. The households, institutions, enterprises, and shops that have \nto  relocate  will  also  receive  a  relocation  allowance.  Compensation  for  standing  crops, \nauxiliaries, and other assets will also be paid directly to the affected persons. Income losses \nresulting  from  reduced  production  and/or  sales  and  wages  caused  by  the  Project  will  be \ncompensated in cash.  \n \n48.  The resettlement strategy encompasses the replacement of housing, and the restoration \nof livelihoods and income. People who lose housing have two resettlement options\u2014to receive \nreplacement house at property rights exchange or cash compensation. The PMO, Dongtai, \nresettlement  offices,  and  the  concerned  district  governments  will  provide  the  necessary \nrelocation  assistance  during  resettlement  implementation.  The  measures  for  economic \nrehabilitation include (i) provision of jobs generated by the urban development projects, and the \nproject-related  jobs  during  the  project  construction  and  operation;  (ii)  development  of \nnonagricultural  production,  including  self-employed  secondary  and  tertiary  businesses;  (iii) \nprovision of technical training to the affected persons to increase their skills to be employed in \nother institutions, enterprises, and businesses; and (iv) provision of social insurance. Relocated \ninstitutions, enterprises, and shops will be provided with the compensation and resettlement \noptions. The same institutions, enterprises, and shops will reemploy the affected employees, \nand no job losses are expected. The special needs and expectations of vulnerable groups will \nreceive attention and assistance. The PMO and Dongtai will supervise implementation to ensure \nthese  vulnerable  persons  receive  adequate  compensation,  housing  arrangement,  special \nfunding and MLG, and assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes.  \n \n49.  The WMG envisages the Pingminchong component as a social improvement project in \nline  with  the  Government\u2019s  people-centered  principle  to  build  a  harmonious  society.  This \ncomponent is designed to help the people living in the geohazard-prone valley eliminate the \n                                                 \n11\nPRC's  social  assistance  system  includes  a  national  system  of  subsistence  allowances  through  the  \"five \nguarantees\"  household  subsistence  program.  Under  this  program,  infirm  and  childless  old  people  enjoy \ngovernment support for food, clothing, medical care, housing and burial expenses.  \n \n \n ", "15 \nthreat of geohazards and catch up with the higher living standards in other parts of the city. \nZaochong was selected as the location of the new resettlement community through comparative \nanalysis  of  alternatives  during  the  feasibility  study.  Apart  from  being  geohazard-free,  the \nZaochong site was chosen based on the following technical and socioeconomic considerations: \n(i) space available to accommodate the community development for a mixed, yet harmonized, \nneighborhood; (ii) geological condition and stability; (iii) proximity to existing and planned urban \ninfrastructure and social services; (iv) access to public transportation; and (v) proximity to the \nexisting  and  planned  commercial,  cultural  and  educational  establishments.  The  new \nresettlement community will provide quality housing with 150,000 m2 of floor space designed \nfollowing the national engineering and safety standards\u2014sufficient to accommodate all the \nrelocated residents from Pingminchong valley. The resettlement community will be constructed \nin accordance with the national standards, and will be equipped with a wide range of public \ninfrastructure and services, including ample public green space and parking lots; water supply, \ndrainage and sanitation system; lighting; and a community center and other community service \nfacilities. Compared with the facilities available in Pingminchong valley, the new resettlement \ncommunity  represents  a  substantial  improvement  in  living  conditions  for  the  people.  A \nhousehold survey conducted for loan processing showed that the families living in the valley are \neager to move out of the geohazard-prone area, and welcome the Project because it provides \nthem with the opportunity and means to free themselves from geohazard threats. \n \n50.  The resettlement palns and the resettlement information booklets have been prepared \nfor disclosure and distributed to the affected villages, communities, and persons. Aside from the \ngovernment  land  available  for  the  Project,  the  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  is  estimated  at  CNY476.7  million  including  contingencies.  A  summary  of  the \nresettlement plans is in Appendix 11; details are in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n2.  Poverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n \n51.  The  Project  will  support  the  achievement  of  the  NSDW  by  promoting  economic \ndevelopment in the western PRC. Of the 486,000 Wuzhou residents to benefit from the Project, \n20,410 (4.2%) live under the MLG. Ethnic minorities account for 2.4% of the city population. The \nsocial analysis concluded that they are socially and economically integrated with the majority \npopulation, and will not be subject to any adverse impacts of the Project. The detailed poverty \nand social assessment is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n52.  Relocation under the Pingminchong component will provide the Pingminchong valley \nresidents with an opportunity to free themselves of geohazard threats, improve their living \nconditions, and gain access to some essential municipal services, which could not be provided \nbecause of the high density of the low-quality housing structures built randomly in the valley. \nThe expansion of the urban area into the geohazard-free land, and the increase in permanent \njobs  through  the  urbanization  of  Hongling  area,  will  provide  better  accommodation  and \nlivelihood opportunities for the existing and incoming urban residents of Wuzhou. The continued \nurbanization of Wuzhou will also create new jobs that will need to be filled by migrant labors, \nmainly coming from the surrounding impoverished areas. \n \n53.  The  Project  will  create  2,260  person-years  of  direct  and  indirect  employment,  with \nestimated  earnings  totaling  CNY39  million,  during  the  construction  phase.  The  WMG  has \nassured ADB that vulnerable groups, including women, the poor and the ethnic minorities, will \nbe prioritized for these short-term jobs. Under this arrangement, an estimated 40% of the short-\nterm jobs will be filled by vulnerable groups (about 20% by women, about 20% by the poor and \nethnic minorities). Those temporarily employed in construction will benefit from the training and \n ", "16 \nexperience gained under the Project, enhancing their opportunities for employment in other \ninfrastructure projects. The WMG has agreed that assuring vulnerable groups of employment \nopportunities will be included as a project performance indicator to be closely monitored under \nPPMS. Vulnerable groups and affected persons also will be given priority for the mid- to long-\nterm jobs. \n \n54.  Under the Project, the contractors will be sensitized to the issue of maximizing benefits \nfor vulnerable groups. In particular, the contractors will be contractually required to prioritize \nvulnerable groups for jobs and training opportunities. The poverty reduction and social strategy \nis summarized in Appendix 12. \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects \n \n55.  The capacity development and institutional building component of the Project involves \nthe provision of consulting services only. These services are expected to improve environmental \nmanagement of the WMG, among other things. Major environmental impacts are expected from \nthe Pingminchong component and Hongling component. An environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) has been prepared for each of the two investment components. Both EIAs have been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  PRC,  and  have  been \napproved  by  the  concerned  environmental  protection  authorities.  The  two  investment \ncomponents were examined against the procedures and criteria specified in ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002), Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), and Environmental Guidelines for \nSelected  Infrastructure  Development  Projects. 12  Extensive  public  consultations  involving \nsurveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions were undertaken during \nproject  preparation.  The  summary  EIA  (SEIA),  including  an  associated  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), has been prepared. It was circulated to the Board of Directors and \nposted on the ADB website on 14 August 2008. The SEIA is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n56.  As highlighted in the SEIA, the Project will improve the living and working conditions for \nresidents of Wuzhou. It will also strengthen the sustainability of urban development in Wuzhou \nby  addressing  one  of  the  most  acute  development  constraints\u2014the  city\u2019s  vulnerability  to \ngeohazards.  Other  environmental  benefits  include  (i)  less  soil  erosion  and  dust  from  the \nexposed slopes; (ii) less clogging of drainage and siltation of waterways from mud and debris \nflows  and  eroded  soil;  (iii)  better  environmental  amenities  for  geohazard-threatened \ncommunities after resettlement or treatment and redevelopment; and (iv) an elevated road \nnetwork in Hongling area, which may also serve as flood escape routes in extreme weather. \n \n57.  Major  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project  include  air,  water,  and  noise  pollution  during \nconstruction. In general, these impacts are temporary and/or localized. Mitigation measures are \nprescribed in the SEIA and EMP under EIAs. The adverse environmental impacts associated \nwith the Project will be prevented, eliminated, or minimized to an acceptable level through the \nimplementation of the EMP under the SEIA and EIAs. The mitigation measures described in the \nEMP  will  be  updated  during  engineering  design,  and  will  be  continually  refined  during \nconstruction. Dongtai, the contractors, and the operating agencies will implement the EMP. The \nimplementation  will  be  closely  monitored  and  supervised  by  a  professionally  specialized \nenvironmental  monitoring  agency\u2014Wuzhou  Environmental  Monitoring  Center\u2014with  results \nreported regularly to the PMO, Wuzhou Environmental Protection Bureau, and ADB. A copy of \nthe EMP is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1993. Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects. Manila. \n ", "17 \nD.  Financial Aspects \n \n58.  The Project does not have a revenue generating component. Therefore, the financial \nanalysis concentrated on the assessment of the financial impact and management of the WMG \nand  Dongtai,  as  the  IA.  The  fiscal  impact  and  affordability  were  assessed  by  comparing \nidentified  financing  sources  with  the  annual  funds  required  for  capital  expenditures  during \nproject implementation, and for operation and maintenance and debt service during operation. \nDuring project implementation, the counterpart fund requirement is expected to peak in 2010 \nand 2011. It will reach a manageable level of about 6% of the WMG\u2019s current annual capital \nexpenditure  budget  in  those  years.  At  its  highest  level  in  2014,  projected  debt  service  is \nexpected  to  account  for  7.6%  of  operational  expenditures  of  the  WMG  before  gradually \ndeclining to 4.5% in 2019. This indicates an acceptable fiscal risk for the WMG, particularly in \nthe light of the sustained increase in revenues of the WMG. Since Dongtai will play the role of an \nagent to implement the Project on behalf of the WMG, the Project will have little impact on the \nfinancial  status  of  the  IA.  Assessment  of  the  financial  impact  on  the  WMG  and  Dongtai \nconfirmed that the Project will not affect the financial sustainability of either.  \n \n59.  The potential of the proposed revolving financing mechanism has been examined by \ncomparing  geohazard  resettlement  and  prevention  costs  and  the  revenues  that  could  be \ngenerated from auction of the treated lands. Assuming that urban land values in Wuzhou remain \nat the current level, revenue from the sales of the treated and geohazard-free land would enable \nthe WMG to fully recover the cost of geohazard resettlement and prevention with a net gain of \nabout CNY43.7 million. This surplus could be used as seed money to establish the revolving \nfinancing mechanism for future geohazard-mitigation projects of the other geohazard-prone \nvalleys of the city. \n \n60.  The financial management assessment concluded that the WMG and Dongtai have \nadequate  internal  financial  management  systems  and  enough  financial  management \nprofessionals to manage the Project. Since this will be the first time for the WMG and Dongtai to \nimplement a project funded by a multilateral development bank, intensive training will be needed \nto  help  them  understand  and  become  familiar  with  ADB  policy  and  project  management \nrequirements. Relevant training has been included in the capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening component of the Project. More details of financial performance and management \nassessment are summarized in Appendix 13. The detailed financial management assessment is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nE.  Economic Aspects \n \n61.  The economic analysis of the Project covers project justification, general parameters for \neconomic analysis, project cost and benefits, least-cost analysis, and distribution analysis. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for each of the investment components \nand for the Project as a whole. The economic rationale of the Project is solid. The Project will \nsupport the WMG in promoting urban development and combating geohazards in an integrated, \nwell-programmed, and cost-effective manner. The primary benefits of the Project include the \nfollowing:  (i)  avoidance  of  property  damage  and  deaths  caused  by  geohazards,  improved \nhousing  conditions  and  the  quality  of  life  for  the  geohazard-threatened  residents  of \nPingminchong  valley;  (ii)  increases  in  land  values  because  of  improvements  in  geological \ncondition  and  infrastructure;  (iii)  typical  benefits  arising  from  a  road  project  such  as  time \nsavings, fuel savings, vehicle operating cost savings, and accident cost reductions through \nprovision of municipal road infrastructure for the Hongling area; and (iv) faster GDP growth from \nimprovements in general infrastructure. The EIRR is 19.3% for Pingminchong component and \n ", "18 \n20.9% for Hongling component under the base case scenario. The EIRR for the Project as a \nwhole is 20.7%. All EIRRs are higher than the 12% economic opportunity cost of capital under \nvarious sensitivity analyses, including an increase in costs, a decrease in benefits, and a delay \nin implementation. A summary economic analysis is in Appendix 14. A detailed economic \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nF.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures  \n \n62.  The  Project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \ndesigns with proven records of reliable performance will be adopted for construction of the \nresettlement  community  and  road  network,  and  for  installation  of  the  related  municipal \ninfrastructure along the roads. Engineering measures to prevent geohazards will adopt the \nconventional technology with proven track records in Wuzhou. \n \n63.  The challenge of relocating a large quantity of households may pose a risk to the \nProject.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  detailed  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  two \ninvestment components under the Project, strictly following ADB resettlement safeguards policy \nand participatory consultation procedures. Substantial consulting inputs have been included in \nthe capacity development and institutional strengthening component to provide guidance and \ntechnical support for WMG and Dongtai. This will help ensure appropriate implementation of the \nresettlement plans following the ADB resettlement safeguard policy requirements.  \n \n64.  The implementation of the resettlement plans will be subject to internal monitoring by the \nWMG and external monitoring by an independent agency to be engaged at the start of project \nimplementation. The WMG will closely monitor and regularly report on land acquisition and \nresettlement  progress  through  its  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB.  In  addition,  the \nindependent monitoring agency will visit these investment components separately to (i) review \nresettlement progress and the general welfare of affected persons, (ii) recommend ways to \nresolve any issues or problems, (iii) provide advice to Dongtai and the local officials, and (iv) \nevaluate the resettlement plan implementation. The independent monitoring agency will be \nrequired to pay special attention to vulnerable groups including women and the poor, to assess \nwhether they have fully regained their standards of living. Such monitoring and evaluation \nreports  will  be  prepared  every  6  months  during  implementation,  and  annually  for  2  years \nconsecutively  after  the  completion  of  resettlement.  These  reports  will  be  submitted \nsimultaneously to ADB, the WMG, and Dongtai, and will be uploaded to the ADB website. \n \n65.  Another  risk  might  arise  from  inappropriate  engineering  design  and/or  irresponsible \nengineering  treatment  for  the  geohazard  prevention  measures  to  be  undertaken  for  the \nevacuated  Pingminchong  valley.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  WMG  has  provided  specific \nassurances that the engineering design and treatment of geohazard prevention measures will \nstrictly  follow  the  national  design  and  engineering  standards  for  geohazard  control  and \nprevention works. Under the capacity development and institutional strengthening component, \nexperts in geohazard engineering safety will provide guidance and quality control to ensure the \nquality  and  safety  of  the  geohazard  prevention  engineering  measures  undertaken  by  the \nProject.  \n \n66.  Compared with the threat of geohazards to the life and property of people in Wuzhou, \nand their constraint on the development opportunities of the city, the integrated benefits and \nimpacts of the Project are expected to outweigh the costs. The identified risks are manageable, \ngiven the mitigation measures provided. \n \n ", "19 \nV.  ASSURANCES \n67.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, the GZARG, and the WMG \nhave given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Provision  of  counterpart  fund.  The Government and WMG will ensure  (a) \ntimely provision of adequate counterpart financing as required in the financing \nplan of the Project, and (b) provision of additional counterpart funds to cover any \nshortfall of funds or cost overruns that may occur during project implementation.  \n  \n(ii)  Approvals of project land. The Project will be given all the land use approvals \nfrom the concerned authorities of the Government in a timely manner to ensure \ntimely implementation of the Project. \n \n(iii)  Implementation of resettlement plans. The Government and WMG will ensure \n(a) timely updating of the resettlement plans at the stage of engineering design \ntaking into account the results of detailed measurement surveys, (b) submitting \nthe updated resettlement plans for ADB concurrence prior to award of related \ncivil  works  contract,  and  (c)  disclose  the  updated  resettlement  plans  to  the \naffected persons. The Government and the WMG will further ensure that the \nresettlement plans will be implemented in strict conformity to ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy. \n \n(iv)  Resettlement arrangement. The Government and the WMG will ensure that (a) \nconstruction  of  the  resettlement  community  in  Zaozhuang  will  have  been \ncompleted  with  sufficient  quality  housing  facilities  and  functioning  municipal \ninfrastructure before relocating the households out of Pingminchong valley and \ndemolishing  their  current  houses,  (b)  the  project-affected  households  will  be \nprovided  a  replacement  housing  area  equivalent  to  their  current  housing \nconditions in their original place, and (c) cash option will be provided for those \nfamilies that may wish to settle in a community different from the resettlement \ncommunity constructed under the Project.     \n \n(v)  Employment opportunity for the vulnerable groups. The Government and the \nWMG will ensure that priority will be accorded to the vulnerable groups including \nthe women, the poor, and the ethnic minorities for the employment opportunities \ncreated under the Project. The achievement in providing employment for the \nvulnerable groups will be closely monitored as part of the PPMS.   \n \n(vi)  Implementation of environmental management plan. The Government and \nthe  WMG  will  ensure  (a)  timely  elaborating  and  updating  of  the  mitigation \nmeasures  included  in  EMP  during  engineering  design,  and  (b)  timely \nimplementation of the mitigation measures specified in EMP.  \n \n(vii)  Technical standards for geohazard control. The Government and the WMG \nwill ensure that the national regulations and technical standards for geohazard \ncontrol and prevention works will be adopted in the design and undertaking of the \nengineering treatment for geohazard control and prevention measures under the \nProject.  \n \n ", "20 \n(viii)  Monitoring mechanism for quality control. The Government and the WMG will \nensure that, with support of the project implementation consultants, a special \nmonitoring mechanism will be established to closely observe the slope stability of \nPingminchong valley throughout the project implementation period until 2 years \nafter project completion.   \n \n(ix)  Operation and maintenance of the geohazard forecasting and early warning \nsystem.  The  Government  and  the  WMG  will  ensure  that  the  geohazard \nforecasting and early warning system will be established and put in operation \nbefore the completion of Pingminchong geohazard resettlement and prevention \ncomponent.  The  Government  and  the  WMG  will  further  ensure  to  provide \nsufficient  full  time  professional  staff  and  financial  resources  to  support  the \noperation  and  maintenance  of  the  geohazard  forecasting  and  early  warning \nsystem to ensure its sustainable operation. \n \nVI.

History and Current Development Status of Wuzhou \n \n1.  Wuzhou city is on the east side of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, adjacent to \nGuangdong province. It has existed for more than 2,100 years. Under the local government \nsystem of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) \nhas jurisdiction over three urban districts (Wanxiu, Dieshan, and Changzhou), one county-city \n(Cenxi), and three rural counties (Cangwu, Mengshan, and Tengxian). The total area of Wuzhou \nis 12,588 square kilometres (km2), including an urban area is 1,097 km2 (8.7% of the total). By \nthe end of 2006, the total population under WMG administration was 3.08 million, including an \nurban population of 489,300 (15.9%). However, in general terms and in the context of the \nGuangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project, Wuzhou refers only to the city itself, comprising \nthe three urban districts and covering a developed urban area of 50 km2 with a population of \n486,000. \n \n2.  Wuzhou is at the junction of the Xijiang River and the Guijiang River. Xijiang is the \nupstream section of Zhujiang (i.e. the Pearl River), which links Guangxi with the Pearl River \nDelta\u2014a major growth engine of the PRC. Through these rivers, Wuzhou is connected to most \nof the important cities of Guangxi, including Nanning, Liuzhou, Guigang, and Guilin in the \nupstream  direction;  and  many  cities  of  national  and  international  significance,  including \nGuangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau, in the downstream direction. Because of its location and \neasy connection with the regional waterway system, Wuzhou used to have a very prominent \nposition in Guangxi. During the water transportation era up to 1980s, Wuzhou used to be the \nmost  important  gateway  city  of  southwestern  PRC,  connecting  Guangxi  and  surrounding \nprovinces with national and international markets. As a result of the water transport system, \nWuzhou became one of the earliest international port cities of Guangxi, with modern customs \nestablished in 1897.   \n \n3.  As the land transportation systems in the PRC developed rapidly, Wuzhou has lagged \nbehind other cities in Guangxi that have gained direct access to the railway system and/or the \nexpressway network. Wuzhou is connected only by highways and an irregular local airline \nservice, in addition to the century-old declining water transport system. Lack of direct access to \nrailway  system  and  the  expressway  network  has  prevented  Wuzhou\u2014once  a  regional \ntransportation hub\u2014from realizing its full potential. \n \n4.  In 2006, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Wuzhou was CNY27.1 billion, 14.2% \nhigher than in 2005. On a per capita basis, Wuzhou\u2019s GDP was CNY8,789 (about $1,000 at the \nexchange rate in 2006), less than half the national average of $2,036 for 2006. Primary sectors \nof the economy account for 19.7% of GDP, while secondary sectors account for 45% and \ntertiary sectors 35.3%. Despite the high growth rate, Wuzhou is still a less-developed city at the \nearly stage of urbanization.  \n \n5.  To ensure sustained urban development, Wuzhou first needs to improve and strengthen \nits  connectivity  to  national  and  international  markets  by  gaining  direct  access  to  the  fast \ndeveloping modern transport system of the PRC. With support from the central government and \nthe government of Guangxi, Wuzhou will benefit from six ongoing, domestically funded national \ntransport infrastructure projects, including (i) three expressway projects to link Wuzhou to the \nnational expressway system in three directions (to Guilin in the north, Nanning in the west, and \nGuangzhou in the east); (ii) two railway projects to connect Wuzhou with the national trunk \nrailroads both vertically (north-south) from Luoyang to Zhanjiang and horizontally (east-west) \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nfrom Guangzhou to Nanning; and (iii) one program to upgrade the water transport system of the \nXijiang-Zhujiang rivers. These important transportation projects will once again make Wuzhou \nan  important  regional  transportation  center  under  the  integrated  multimodal  transportation \nsystem  of  the  PRC.  In  particular,  Wuzhou  is  expected  to  become  a  regional  multimodal \ntransportation hub linking Qugangxi and surrounding provinces with the Pearl River Delta. \n \nB.   Special Challenges for Urban Development in Wuzhou \n \n6.  Sustained urban development in Wuzhou faces several challenges. In addition to the \nweak urban planning and financing capacity commonly found in many municipal governments in \nthe PRC, Wuzhou is constrained by its geographic location and geological conditions.  \n \n7.  Wuzhou is a mountainous city divided into three parts by two big rivers. The city proper, \nwhich is on the north bank of Xunjiang River and/or Xijiang River,1 is further divided by the \nGuijiang River into the old urban center on the east side and a fast-growing new urban center \non the west side. The south bank of Xunjiang and/or Xijiang River has not been developed.  \n \n8.  Before the development of the new urban area on the west side of Guijiang River in \n1980s, the old city proper was confined to a small developed parcel of urban land of about 2 \nkm2 on the northeast corner of the intersection between Guijiang River and Xijiang River. \nBecause of the increase in the urban population and the lack of appropriate urban planning, the \nresidential areas expanded into marginal lands up the mountain slopes along major valleys. \nMost of the houses in these valleys were simple structures randomly built with little planning. \nGradually, many of the major valleys became crowded with low-quality houses, many built \nadjacent to each other. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth formation, \neroded granite, and clastic rocks, making them highly vulnerable to geological disasters such as \nlandslides, slope collapses and mud and debris flow during the rainy season. Many of the \nheavily populated valleys are officially classified as geohazard-prone valley, with thousands of \nurban residents threatened by geological disasters. \n \n9.  The high density of low-quality housing and their vulnerability to geohazards in the major \nvalleys around the old urban center has left Wuzhou little choice but to expand the urban \nboundary into the geohazard-free areas across the rivers and outside the traditional urban \ncenter. The urban expansion is now guided under the Wuzhou Urban Development Master Plan \nfor 2002\u20132020, which was formulated by the WMG and approved by the Wuzhou People\u2019s \nCongress and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government. \n \nC.  Wuzhou Urban Development Master Plan  \n \n10.  Based on an examination of the challenges and development opportunities of Wuzhou, \nthe master plan has proposed as the overall goal making Wuzhou an export-oriented industrial \ncity in the east of Guangxi, and a transportation hub to connect Guangxi with the Pearl River \nDelta.  \n \n11.  Given the geographic and geological conditions, Wuzhou needs to be developed in \nclusters. As envisaged in the master urban development plan, Wuzhou would comprise \u201cone \ncentral city, one sub-city center, three county seats and five town axels.\u201d This is intended to \n                                                 \n1  The upstream section of the Xijiang River is called the Xunjiang River before meeting the Guijiang River at the \nintersection in Wuzhou. The Xijiang River is referred to either as the Xunjiang River or as Xijiang River, depending \non whether the specific segment is located upstream of the intersection or downstream of the intersection.  \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nmake use of the lands available on the west and southwest sides of the city that are close to the \ntraditional city proper, and to deploy the urban infrastructure cost-effectively.  \n \n12.  The long-term urban expansion in Wuzhou is generally moving south and west, under \nthe  established  land  use  principle  of  developing  the  south,  expanding  towards  the  west, \nupgrading the east, and controlling the north. Following this principle, the priorities are the \ndevelopment of new geohazard-free urban areas in Hongling and Sanlong in the west and in the \nCangwu County in the south, and upgrading the development of Changzhou Island of Xunjiang \nRiver  in  the  southwest.  To  realize  this  urban  development  concept,  the  transportation \nconnections among major clusters need to be constructed or enhanced.  \n \n13.  Under the master plan, the WMG envisaged the acceleration of urbanization and steady \ndevelopment of the city proper, as well as other urban areas in the county seats and smaller \ntowns. The population of Wuzhou overall was expected to reach 3.5 million by 2020, of which \nabout 50%\u201355% was to reside in the urbanized areas in Wuzhou city proper and other urban \ncenters under the jurisdiction of the WMG. Total developed urban lands was expected to grow \nto 67 km2 at the end of the 11th Five Year Plan in 2010, and then continue to grow up to 2020.   \n \n14.  From 2003 to 2005, the WMG accumulatively invested CNY3.5 billion to develop basic \nurban infrastructure. These include 28 kilometers (km) of urban roads, five bridges, more than \n100 lanes, and the lighting system of the city. Public investment in basic infrastructure has \ninduced substantial public or private investment to develop the service sector, as well as a large \nquantity of commercial facilities in the new urban areas and the newly constructed and well-\nserviced residential areas in the geohazard-free areas. \n \nD.  Development Potentials Assessment \n \n15.  During  loan  processing,  a  comprehensive  analysis  was  conducted  and  applied  the \n\u201cstrength, weakness, opportunity and threat\u201d approach to Wuzhou, which produced the following \nfindings: \n \n(i)  Strengths. The analysis identified the following strengths: (a) relatively short \ndistance to the major cities of the Pearl River Delta, including Guangzhou, Hong \nKong, and Macau; (b) rich historical and cultural resources; (c) adequate water \nsupply;  (d)  clean  environment;  (e)  forest  resources;  and  (f)  good  variety  of \nagricultural products. \n \n(ii)  Weaknesses.  The  analysis  identified  the  following  weaknesses:  (a)  lack  of \ndeveloped urban land for urban expansion, (b) vulnerability to geohazards, (c) \nlack of direct access to the integrated multimodal modern transportation system, \n(d) lack of natural endowment and advantage to develop a solid and specialized \nmanufacturing base as a backbone to support sustained industrialization, and (e) \nthe relatively weak institutional capability urban planning and municipal financing. \n \n(iii)  Opportunities. The analysis identified the following opportunities: (a) support \nfrom the central Government under the National Strategy for Development of the \nWest,  (b)  access  to  the  multimodal  transportation  system  provided  by  the \nongoing national infrastructure projects, (c) shift of the manufacturing industries \nfrom the coastal cities in the Pearl River Delta towards the low-cost cities in \ninland provinces and autonomous regions, (d) the new initiative of Guangxi to \npromote the Beibu Gulf Economic Development Zone, and (e) access to financial \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nsupport  and  international  knowledge  and  experiences  obtained  through \ncooperation with the Asian Development Bank. \n \n(iv)  Threats. The analysis identified the following threats: (a) geohazards, and (b) \nenvironmental impact that may arise from rapid urbanization and industrialization. \n \n16.  This analysis has confirmed the potential for sustained urban development of Wuzhou. \nIn view of the ongoing transportation infrastructure projects, and the location of the city at the \njunction of a number of important national expressways and railways, Wuzhou is expected to \ndevelop into an important multimodal regional transportation center upon completion of these \nprojects. Wuzhou\u2019s tertiary sector, particularly logistics services, is envisaged to grow rapidly. \n \n17.  After completion of these infrastructure projects, Wuzhou will be within a half-day travel \nby car or by passenger train of residents in most cities in the Peal River Delta and Beibu Gulf \nEconomic Zone. The clean and undisturbed natural environment and historical legacy of the city \ncan  provide  a  good  basis  for  development  of  tourism  and  recreation  service  to  support \nsustained urban development.   \n \n18.  As noted in the master plan, Wuzhou has good potential for industrial development. The \nmanufacturing sector needs to be developed selectively by establishing well-managed industrial \nparks  to  ensure  environmental  protection  and  environmental  sustainability  of  the  city,  as \nrequired in the master plan. Given the location of Wuzhou upstream of Xijiang River, these \nindustrial parks need to enforce strict entrance criteria to avoid discharging pollutants into \nXijiang River\u2014the water source for millions of people in downstream cities.  \n \n19.  In the context of environmental protection, the assessment highly commends the recent \nactions undertaken by the WMG to shut down polluting business in Wuzhou, including two coal-\nfired thermal power plants and 280 small paper mills. In addition, the WMG has installed \nautomatic pollution emission monitoring facilities for the 11 key polluting sources identified in the \ncity. \n \n20.  The assessment recommends prioritizing development activities envisaged under the \nmaster plan. The development of the north bank of the Xunjiang River and/or the Xijiang River, \nparticularly the Hongling area between the existing developed urban land and the railway station \nthat is under construction, should be the first priority. After completion of the railway station, the \nHongling area is expected to serve as the logistics base for the railway station and other \ntransport facilities in this geohazard-free urban area. \n \n21.  Geohazard concerns can be addressed as part of the urban development process by (i) \npromoting  urban  expansion  into  geohazard-free  areas,  (ii)  building  well-serviced  housing \nfacilities  in  the  geohazard-free  areas,  (iii)  moving  the  residents  from  the  geohazard-prone \nvalleys and relocating them into geohazard-free communities, and (iv) undertaking geohazard \ncontrol and prevention measures to convert the evacuated valley into geohazard-free land for \nurban redevelopment.   \n \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nGEOHAZARD MANAGEMENT IN WUZHOU \n \nA.  Geohazards in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n \n1.  In  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  geohazards  include  landslides,  slope \ncollapses, mud and debris flows, earth cracks, and land depressions that are either induced by \nnatural factors or human activities.1 \n \n2.  With complex geological and geographical formations and climate conditions, the PRC \nis among the countries that suffer most from a wide variety of large-scale and high-frequency \ngeohazards  that  are  widely  distributed.  All  provinces  except  for  Shanghai  are  affected  by \nlandslides, slope collapses, and mud and debris flows. The provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, \nChongqing, Guangxi, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shanxi, and Fujian \nare the worst hit. Geohazards between 1995 and 2005 left 1,108 people dead or missing, and \ncaused a direct economic loss of CNY5.9 billion on average each year. The worst year was \n1998, when the PRC suffered a direct economic loss of CNY15 billion (footnote 1). Official \nstatistics  show  that  more  than  102,800  geohazards  occurred  in  2006  across  the  country, \nincluding 2,041 in Guangxi, and caused a direct economic loss of CNY4.3 billion.2 \n \nB.  Achievements \n \n3.  The Government has tangibly strengthened geohazard management. For the 10th \nFive-Year Plan (2001-2005), the number of deaths as a result of geohazards decreased to \n4,278 from 6,621 during the 9th Five-Year Plan (1996-2000); and the direct economic loss fell to \nCNY21.1 billion from CNY31.8 billion. The major programs or projects of the Government are \nhighlighted in paras. 4\u20137. \n \n1.  Geohazard Surveys and Monitoring \n \n4.  Between 1999 and 2005, the Ministry of Land and Resources organized geohazard \nsurveys for the 700 most vulnerable counties and cities in the country. The surveys provided a \ngood understanding of the causes and distribution of geohazards which laid a solid foundation \nfor planning the geohazard prevention and control projects. Based on the surveys, geohazard \nmonitoring networks, comprising stations at more than 60,000 monitoring locations, have been \nestablished in the 700 most vulnerable counties and cities. Demonstration monitoring programs \nare being carried out in the pilot areas. \n \n2.  Geohazard Forecasting and Early Warning \n \n5.  Since  2003,  the  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  and  China  Meteorological \nAdministration began to integrate geohazard and weather forecast and early warning at the \nnational level. Similar work has been introduced in some provinces and cities. \n \n3.  Emergency Response System \n \n6.  After  the  State  Council  issued  the  national  action  plan  for  geohazard  emergency \nresponses on 14 May 2005, all the provinces and the vast majority of the geohazard-prone \ncounties and cites have formulated their own action plans. An emergency response system, \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Land and Resources. 2008. The 11th National FYP for Prevention and Control of Geohazard.

Regulatory Strengthening \n \n7.  In 2003, the State Council promulgated the Ordinance on Geohazard Prevention and \nControl, which took effect on 1 March 2004. The 29 geohazard-relevant provinces have also \nformulated local ordinances and management guidelines, thus setting up a legal framework to \ngovern geohazard prevention and control in the PRC. \n \nC.  Financing Support \n \n8.  The various levels of governments (central, provincial, county and city, and township) \nshare responsibility for financing geohazard prevention and control.3 The central Government \nhas instructed each level of government to set up a geohazard prevention and control fund \nwithin the government operating budget. The central Government will fund the cost of the \ngeohazard survey and assessment, and the establishment of the national geohazard monitoring \nand early warning system. Geohazard emergency response systems at the provincial and/or \nlower levels of government will be funded by the respective local governments. The provincial \nand local governments will fund the cost for resettlement of people threatened by geohazards \nand geological disaster rehabilitation and mitigation, while the central Government will provide \nsupport and subsidies for mitigation of large geohazards. If research on geohazard prevention \nand control has demonstration value, the project may apply for funding under the relevant \nnational  science  and  technology  development  programs.  Financing  support  by  local \ngovernments and enterprises is encouraged. \n \nD.  National 11th Five-Year Program for Prevention and Control of Geohazard \n \n9.  The 11th national five-year program for prevention and control of geohazard 2006\u2013\n2010 (FYP-PCG) established a number of principles, including (i) \u201cprevention-first\u201d and \u201chuman-\ncentered  principles\u201d,  (ii)  integrated  treatment  and  resettlement  approach,  (iii)  mass-based \nmonitoring  and  prevention  system  with  clearly  defined  roles  and  responsibilities,  and  (iv) \nstronger regulatory framework and introducing technological advancement. In particular, FYP-\nPCG calls for the resettlement of those under serious threat, and the establishment of an \nintegrated monitoring, forecasting, early warming, and emergency response system. The overall \ngoal is to reduce the geohazard-threatened population by 30% from the 2005 baseline by the \nend of the 11th FYP-PCG. \n \nE.  Geohazards in Wuzhou \n \n10.  Originating from a small plain at the intersection of two major rivers, Wuzhou is a \ntypical mountainous city and one of the most geohazard-prone areas in the Guangxi Zhuang \nAutonomous  Region.  Rapid  urban  expansion  has  significantly  increased  the  distribution, \nfrequency, and scale of geohazards, causing greater damage to people\u2019s lives and properties, \nto socioeconomic development, and to social stability. \n \n \n                                                 \n3  Government policy states that if a geohazard or disaster is triggered by a project, the project owner will be held \nresponsible for paying for the mitigation. Governments will be responsible for the prevention, control, and mitigation \nof geohazards and disasters caused by natural factors. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \n11.  Statistics show that the city is hit by several dozen landslides and slope collapses every \nyear. Between 2000 and 2005, many urban districts of Wuzhou experienced landslides and \nslope collapses. On 8 June 2006, an exceptionally strong rainstorm hit Wuzhou, triggering 181 \nlandslides,  48  slope  collapses,  and  64  mud  and  debris  flows.  The  geological  disasters \nthreatened the lives of 21,673 people and caused extensive damages, laving 12 dead, 26 \nwounded, and 825 residential buildings destroyed. The direct economic loss totaled about \nCNY30 million.  \n \n12.  A land use survey found that, because geohazard-free urban land is lacking, about 30 \nenterprises and organizations and 53,000 residents of Wuzhou inhabit urban districts classified \nas geohazard-prone zones. Private low-quality residential buildings account for 70% of the \nhousing  structures  in  these  geohazard-prone  zones.  These  buildings  were  constructed  in \nmultiple cascades on the mountain slopes. Because of the complex geographical conditions and \nhistory, most of the private residential buildings were randomly built adjacent to another on the \nslope of mountains without any planning or geohazard safety assessment. The living conditions \nof  the  people  in  these  geohazard-prone  areas  are  affected  by  lack  of  access  to  urban \ninfrastructure  services,  overcrowded  housing,  narrow  and  poor  road  connections,  sewage \ndischarge into open sewers, and wanton removal of earth and vegetation.  \n \n13.  The geohazards in Wuzhou are attributed to a number of factors, including topography, \nstructure  of  the  earth  surface,  vegetation,  and  rainfall.  Wuzhou  has  a  steep  and  ragged \ntopography. The surface is a thin layer of loose, porous earth on an impermeable rock base. \nThe trees on the slopes are large and will generate cracks on the surface of the slopes in strong \nwinds, adding more moisture to the loose surface material. A strong and long-lasting storm, \nwhen combined these factors, can trigger landslides in the geohazard-prone areas. \n \nF.  Wuzhou Municipal Government Response \n \n1.  Planning and Regulatory Development \n \n14.  In  line  with  national  policy,  the  Wuzhou  municipal  government  (WMG)  has \nstrengthened  planning  and  regulatory  development  for  geohazard  prevention  and  control. \nFollowing the proclamation by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government (GZARG) \nof the Circular on Strengthening Geohazard Prevention and Control,4 the WMG prepared and \nreleased the Short-Term Plan for Geohazard Prevention and Control in Urban Area of Wuzhou \n(2003\u20132005).  In  May  2006,  the  Wuzhou  Land  Resources  Bureau  (WLRB)  completed  the \nWuzhou Urban Geohazard Prevention and Control Master Plan. In October 2006, the WMG \nissued  the  Circular  on  Strengthening  Geohazard  Prevention  and  Control  for  Construction \nProjects.5 \n \n15.  At  the  same  time,  the  WMG  invested  substantial  human,  material  and  financial \nresources  in  improving  urban  planning  and  management,  and  strengthening  the  mitigation \nmeasures  to  help  the  communities  in  the  geohazard  valleys  to  cope  with  the  geohazard \nconcerns. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4 Gui Zheng Fa No. (2002) 205. \n5 Wu Zheng Fa No. (2006) 40. \n ", "Appendix 3      31 \n2.  Enhanced Institutional Capacity \n \n16.  The WMG has established leading groups to strengthen the geohazard management \nsystem  in  municipalities  and  districts,  with  well-defined  responsibilities  and  reporting \nrelationships. The WMG has also established a system of geohazard review, assessment, and \nreporting, including (i) the requirements for geohazard risk assessment for all construction \nprojects,  (ii)  an  accreditation  system  for  the  engineering  design  institutes  and  civil  works \ncontractors for undertaking geohazard prevention and control projects, (iii) geohazard early \nwarning  and  emergency  response  plan,  (iv)  disaster  reporting  system,  (v)  inspection  and \nassessment system for disaster impacts, and (vi) the special geohazard monitoring program for \nthe rainy season. \n \n3.  Improved Geohazard Surveys \n \n17.  Further to the geohazard survey that the GZARG commissioned for Wuzhou in the late \n1990s, the Government in 2003 conducted a geohazard survey with mapping at a 1:100,000 \nscale for Wuzhou. The outputs of the survey include (i) preliminary classification of geohazards \nbased on their causes and distribution patterns; (ii) delineation of the geohazard risks, and the \ngeohazard prevention  and  control  areas;  and  (iii)  a  geohazard  database.  The survey  was \nstrengthened  by  a  special  investigation  conducted  by  Guangxi  Geological  Environment \nMonitoring Station in partnership with the WLRB and the concerned district governments of \nWuzhou in the context of the 8 June 2006 disaster. \n \n4.  Strengthened Mitigation Measures \n \n18.  In 2004, the GZARG approved the feasibility study prepared by the WMG for a program \nto control the major geohazard-prone areas in the three urban districts of Wuzhou. In line with \nthe  approved  feasibility  study,  detailed  design  and  implementation  of  specific  mitigation \nengineering projects have been redirected at rehabilitation of 125 spots that were hit hard in the \n8 June 2006 disaster. The WMG has earmarked special funds for geohazard rehabilitation. \nCertified design institutes and contractors have been engaged to design and implement these \ngeohazard rehabilitation projects. In cooperation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the \nWMG has also formulated a new project to prevent and control geohazards in Wuzhou, which is \nexpected  to  prevent  geohazards  through  holistic  urban  planning  and  integrated  public \ninvestment with lending support from ADB.  \n \n5.  Community-Based Monitoring and Alarm System \n \n19.  Like many cities in the PRC, the WMG has established a community-based geohazard \nmonitoring and alarm system based on the experiences and actions of the local residents. The \nsystem consists of (i) the leadership of the WMG; (ii) the specialized geohazard monitoring and \nemergency response agencies of the WMG, such as the geohazard monitoring and emergency \ncenter at the WLRB; (iii) the meteorological monitoring station; (iv) district governments; (v) \ncommunity leaders at the geohazard-prone areas; and (vi) households living in the geohazard-\nprone areas. The system is alerted by weather forecasts and mobilized when it rains. Every \nslope  in  the  geohazard-prone  areas  is  closely  monitored  under  the  system  through  mass \nobservations to identify potential movements of slopes and buildings. Mandatory evacuation \nmay be declared to move the people out of the immediate danger to a temporary shelter until \nthe original sites are rehabilitated. The media, including newspapers, radio, and television, are \nwidely used to notify the public about geohazards, and educate the public about geohazard \nprevention  and  mitigation  methods.  Brochures  are  distributed  to  each  household  in  the \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \ngeohazard-prone  areas,  providing  detailed  instructions  on  the  evacuation  route  for  each \nhousehold,  emergency  reporting  mechanism,  emergency  response  and  coordination \nresponsibilities  within  the  system,  and  emergency  contact  numbers  and  information \ndissemination mechanisms.  \n \n6.  Increased Investment \n \n20.  Over the past few years, the WMG and the district governments have invested more \nthan CNY130 million in geohazard prevention and control projects at 138 sites identified as \nhazardous.  The  projects  have  included  cleaning  and  rehabilitating  the  drainage  systems, \nbuilding  slope  protection  and  retaining  walls,  and  carrying  out  geohazard  resettlement.  In \naddition,  about  CNY110  million  has  been  mobilized  from  commercial  sources  to  construct \nresidential housing facilities in the geohazard-free areas to accommodate 1,152 households \nrelocated from the geohazard-stricken areas. \n \nG.  Major Challenges \n \n21.  Despite increased funding from the WMG, the geohazard management system remains \nunderfunded. In many geohazard-prone areas in the city, thousands of urban residents live \nunder the direct threat of geohazard. Despite the obvious long-term benefits of prioritizing and \nstrengthening  geohazard  prevention  first,  limited  budgetary  resources  for  geohazard \nmanagement have to be allocated for immediate disaster relief and rehabilitation.  \n \n22.  Although  traditional  engineering  measures  to  prevent  and  control  geohazards\u2014\nconstruction of slope protection and retaining walls\u2014are effective in some cases, they are not \nalways the optimal way to address geohazard concerns. Heavy rains may wash away the \nconcrete slope protection and retaining walls together with the housing structures along the \nslopes, as was seen in the 8 June 2006 disaster.  \n \n23.  Wuzhou has many low-quality housing structures built on the mountain slopes in the \ngeohazard-prone areas, representing the city\u2019s highest vulnerability to geohazards. Most of the \nresidents in these geohazard-prone areas are from the low-income families, which are the least \ncapable of avoiding geohazards. They need public investment to help them catch up with the \ngeohazard-free and infrastructure-serviced living conditions available in other parts of the city.  \n \n24.  Because of the lack of knowledge on international best practice and inadequate funding, \na modern computer-based geohazard forecasting and early warning system, has not yet been \ndeveloped.  Such  a  system  could  effectively  supplement  the  community-based  geohazard \nmanagement system, enhancing geohazard prevention in Wuzhou. \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 4      33 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n    Date of  Amount \nNo.  Name  Approval  ($ million) \nA.

Full \nresettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  Pingminchong  component  and  the  Hongling \ncomponent. The primary objective of the resettlement plans are to ensure that the investment \ncomponents improve the standards of living of affected persons, or at least do not leave them \nworse off.   \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  In terms of resettlement impacts, the construction of the Project will affect two rural \nvillages,  two  urban  resident  communities,  and  one  village  administration  office  and/or  one \ntownship and two districts. Permanent land acquisition will affect 862 households or 3,856 \npersons (including 635 urban employees, and 3,221 rural people). The demolition of residential \nwill  affect  about  2,015  households  or  7,081  persons  living  in  private  houses  under  the \nadministration of the resident and village committees. Meanwhile, 15 institutions, 16 enterprises, \nand seven shops with 1,751 persons will be relocated because of nonstructural demolishment. \nProject  construction  will  permanently  affect  2,393  mu  (667  square  meters)  of  state-  and \ncollective-owned lands will be affected permanently, of which 272 mu (11.37%) is cultivated \nfarmland. In addition, 188,038.13 square meters (m2) of residential houses and 25,022.01 m2 of \nnonresidential structures of institutions, enterprises and shops (5,845 m2 used for residential \npurpose and 19,177.01 m2 for nonresidential purpose) will be demolished. In addition, some \nproductive assets, ground attachments, and basic infrastructure and special facilities will also be \naffected. Table A11 summarizes the land acquisition and resettlement impacts. Of the total \naffected population, 383 households or 1,091 persons are vulnerable groups, including 161 \nhouseholds with small residential area less than 12 m2 per capita 118 households headed by \nwomen, 32 households with the disabled, 42 households living under minimum living guarantee \n(MLG),  and  26  households  with  \u201cfive  guarantees.\u201d1 No  ethnic  minority  households  will  be \nadversely affected.  \n \n3.  To  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  local  officials  and  village \ncommittees and/or resident committees were consulted closely during the preliminary and final \nfeasibility study stages.  \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n4.  The resettlement plans comply with the laws and regulation on resettlement of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). The compensation for the permanent land loss is based on the \nLand Administration Law of PRC (amended 2004), the State Council Decision to deepen reform \n                                                 \n1 PRC's  social  assistance  system  includes  a  national  system  of  subsistence  allowances  through  the  \"five \nguarantees\"household subsistence program. Under this program, infirm and childless old people enjoy government \nsupport for food, clothing, medical care, housing and burial expenses. \n ", "48         Appendix 11 \nand  strictly  enforce  land  administration  (document  28,  November  2004),  and  the  circular \nconcerning certain  issues  regarding  strengthening  land  adjustment  and  control  (31  August \n2006). The house demolishment is based on the state and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous \nRegion urban housing demolishment administration regulations. Based on consultations with \nlocal governments and those affected, and in line with general practice in Guangxi Zhuang \nAutonomous Region and Wuzhou city, a set of compensation standards was adopted by the \nproject management office (PMO) and implementing agency (IA). The following resettlement \nprinciples have been established for the Project: \n \n(i)  Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized \nwhere feasible by developing and comparing a series of design alternatives. \n(ii)  All people residing, cultivating or making a living within the areas acquired for a \ncomponent  before  a  formally  recognized  cut-off  date  should  be  considered \naffected people who should receive compensation for all losses, including assets \nand livelihoods, regardless of land tenure and property right status, and should \nbe entitled to rehabilitation assistance. \n(iii)  Compensation and entitlements provided are based on replacement value, and \nthey must be adequate to allow those affected to at least maintain their pre-\nproject standard of living, with the prospect of improvement. \n(iv)  A  preferential  policy  will  be  established  for  vulnerable  groups  in  terms  of \ncompensation,  minimum  living  guarantee,  employment,  and  relocation \nassistance. \n(v)  All affected persons will be adequately informed on eligibility for compensation, \ncompensation standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project \ntiming. \n(vi)  Affected persons will be paid compensation in a timely manner. \n(vii)  No land acquisition, demolition, or dispossession of assets will take place before \npayment of compensation to affected persons. \n(viii)  Resettlement costs will be included as part of project costs. \n(ix)  Close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any \nproblems.  \n \nD.  Compensation, Income and Livelihood Restoration Scheme \n \n5.  For permanent land acquisition of farmland, 30% of land compensation will be paid in \ncash to the affected villages and 70% of land compensation to the affected persons. The \nresettlement subsidy and compensation for standing crops will be fully paid to the affected \npersons.  For  residential  houses  and  nonresidential  structures  (institutions,  enterprises  and \nshops) to be demolished, compensation will be paid to the owners, including those without \nhouse certificates. The payment will be made in cash according to the appraised value of the \nproperty. The households, institutions, enterprises, and shops that have to relocate will also \nreceive a relocation allowance. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries and other assets \nwill  also  be  paid  directly  to  the  affected  persons.  Income  losses  resulting  from  reduced \nproduction and/or sales, and wages caused by the Project will be compensated in cash. The \nresettlement  strategy  encompasses  the  replacement  of  housing,  and  the  restoration  of \nlivelihoods  and  income.  People  losing  housing  will  have  two  resettlement  options:  (i) \nreplacement house at property rights exchange or (ii) to receive cash compensation. The PMO, \nIA, resettlement offices, and local governments will provide necessary relocation assistance \nduring resettlement implementation. \n \n ", " Appendix 11       49 \n6.  Economic  rehabilitation  measures  include  (i)  provision  of  employment  opportunities \nduring project construction and operation; (ii) nonagricultural production, including development \nof self-employed secondary and tertiary businesses (i.e. clothing, grocery, transportation, cargo, \ncommunity service, repair, hairdressing salon, beauty salon, dry cleaner, entertainment, and \ncatering services); (iii) provision of technical training to affected persons to increase their skills \nto be employed in other institutions, enterprises and businesses; and (iv) provision of social \ninsurance. Relocated institutions, enterprises, and shops will be provided with the options of \ncompensation and resettlement. The same institutions, enterprises, and shops will reemploy the \naffected employees, and no job losses are expected. Attention and assistance will be given to \ntheir special needs and expectations of vulnerable groups. The PMO and the IA will supervise \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  these  vulnerable  persons  receive  adequate  compensation, \nhousing arrangement, special funding and MLG, and assistance to restore their living conditions \nand incomes. \n \nE.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance Procedures \n \n7.  In accordance with the PRC\u2019s national, provincial and municipal policies and regulations \nfor  land  acquisition,  house  demolition,  and  resettlement,  together  with  ADB  policies  and \nguidelines,  the  PMO  and  the  IA  have  conducted  public  consultations,  negotiation,  and \ninformation  disclosure  sessions  with  the  affected  people,  villages  and  district  governments \nduring the project preparation. During meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public \nconsultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  and \naffected people have participated in the planning and their concerns have been integrated into \nthe  resettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  information  booklets  were  distributed  to  affected \npersons in August 2008. The Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) and concerned district \ngovernments have implemented ADB\u2019s full disclosure policy for resettlement activities, including \n(i) distribution of the resettlement information booklets to the affected persons, and resident \ncommunity and village offices; and (ii) posting of the resettlement plans in Chinese at resident \ncommunity and village offices, as well as on the ADB website in English and Chinese, before \nappraisal and upon the approval and/or endorsement of WMG by the end of August 2008. The \nProject IA will establish project resettlement units for supervising implementation, continuing \npublic  consultation,  monitoring  resettlement  progress,  and  responding  to  grievances.  The \ngrievance  address  procedures  are  well  established,  and  explanations  are  included  in  the \nresettlement plans and information booklets. \n \nF.  Institutional Arrangement and Implementation Schedule \n \n8.  The PMO and IA will have around 20 full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and \nresettlement.  The  staff  from  each  component  resettlement  unit  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating the planning, implementation, financing, and monitoring of land acquisition and \nresettlement by working closely with village and resident officials, land resource bureau, house \ndemolishment administration office, and other organizations involved in the implementation of \nthe  resettlement  programs.  They  will  also  be  responsible  for  supervising  and  monitoring \nresettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  relocation  and  selection  of  new  housing  sites, \nrestoration  of  incomes,  provision  of  economic  rehabilitation  measures).  The  resettlement \nmonitor engaged by the PMO will organize a training program for the resettlement officers.  \n \n9.  Land acquisition and resettlement will precede the component construction schedules, \nwhich will occur between December 2008 and November 2012. Detailed measurement surveys \nwill be conducted in each village, residential community, institution, enterprise, and shop; and \nthe compensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with resident and village committees, \n ", "50         Appendix 11 \nhouseholds, institutions, enterprises, and shops. Based on these surveys, the resettlement \nplans will be updated and submitted to ADB for review and approval before the awarding of civil \ncontracts. All compensation and assistance will be delivered to the affected persons before civil \nworks  begin.  To  ensure  that  affected  persons  have  been  adequately  compensated  and \nrehabilitated, the WMG and IA will keep ADB informed of the progress in implementing the \nresettlement plans through quarterly progress reports until resettlement is completed; and will \nprepare resettlement completion reports. The PMO will engage an independent monitoring \nagency for semiannual monitoring and annual evaluation of land acquisition and resettlement \nuntil 2 years after land acquisition, resettlement implementation, and completion of resettlement. \n \nG.  Budget \n \n10.  The preliminary cost estimate for the land acquisition and resettlement program is about \nCNY476.7  million  in  2008  prices,  including  contingencies.  The  estimated  costs  include \ncompensation  for  permanent  land  acquisition,  demolition  of  residential  and  nonresidential \nhouses and auxiliaries, relocation allowance, basic infrastructure and special facilities, other \ncosts, land-related taxes, and contingencies. The resettlement costs for the Pingminchong \ncomponent accounts for about 46.4% of the total land acquisition and resettlement cost, while \nthe Hongling component accounts for about 53.6%. The land acquisition and resettlement costs, \nwhich will be financed by the WMG, are included in the project cost estimates. The Government \nwill provide counterpart budget for resettlement activities, including support where fund shortage \noccurs during resettlement implementation. \n \nH.  Monitoring and Supervision \n \n11.  Resettlement plan implementation will be monitored internally and externally. Monitoring \nmethodologies are specified in the resettlement plans. Internal supervision and monitoring will \nbe done by IA to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement plans. The PMO and \nIA have agreed to a set of supervision milestones with ADB to ensure timely and effective \nimplementation of resettlement activities. An independent monitoring agency under contract to \nthe PMO will carry out external monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation reports will \nbe  prepared  every  6  months  during  implementation  and  annually  for  2  years  after  the \ncompletion of resettlement. These reports will be submitted directly to ADB, the PMO, and the \nIAs, and will be uploaded to the ADB website.  \n \n ", " \nTable A11: Summary Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts  \nStructure Demolishment of \nResidential House Demolition \nEngineering Works  Permanent Land Acquisition  Institutions, Enterprises and \nof Individual Households \nProject  Shops  LAR Costs \nComponents  Township/  Total  Of which  Affected Households  (CNY million) \nAPs (No.)a  Total Area  Affected  Total Area Quantity  APsb \nDistrict  Admin.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nWuzhou is a less-developed, medium-sized city of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in western PRC, which is \ntargeted by the Government for support under the National Strategy for Development of the West (NSDW). The city is \nat a critical stage of urban development, with the goal of developing into a multimodal regional transportation center \nto strengthen the economic integration between Guangxi and its neighboring western provinces with the fast-growing \nPearl River Delta\u2014one major growth engine in PRC. The Project will help the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) \nin addressing its geohazards, which are a major development constraint. The Project will help free thousands of \npeople from the threat of geological disasters, promote sustained urban development, and improve the quality of life \nfor 486,000 residents. The Project, which will introduce an innovative approach to geohazard management, is \nenvisaged to play a demonstration role for many cities facing similar geological conditions in the PRC\u2014a country that \nsuffers losses of human life and economic property from geological disasters every year.  \n \nThe Project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy (CPS) 2008\u20132010 for \nthe PRC, which specifies that ADB will directly support sound and sustainable urban development with a focus on \nrelatively underdeveloped western and northeastern regions.a It also aims to make markets work more efficiently \nthrough (i) urban infrastructure development, (ii) promotion of environmental sustainability, and (iii) pro-poor equitable \nand inclusive growth. The Project will provide an enabling environment in Wuzhou for poverty reduction directly and \nindirectly by: \n \n(i)  reducing the geohazard threat on life and property and associated economic losses; \n(ii)  introducing and establishing a geohazard forecasting and early warning system to strengthen the existing \ncommunity-based geohazard monitoring and management system; \n(iii)  conducting  geohazard  prevention  and  control  measures  to  convert  geohazard-prone  areas  into \ngeohazard-free land for urban redevelopment; \n(iv)  providing roads and related basic infrastructure to promote and facilitate urban expansion away from \ngeohazard-prone areas;  \n(v)  increasing mobility and access for local populations to key basic services and destinations; \n(vi)  saving travel time, reducing vehicle operation costs, improving road safety and reducing traffic accidents; \n(vii)  increasing employment and income-generation opportunities from temporary job creation during the \nconstruction phase and permanent job creation during the operational phase;  \n(viii)  providing  basic  infrastructure  to  support  the  development  and  operation  of  the  city  as  a  regional \nmultimodal transportation center, thus creating new jobs and income generating opportunities;  \n(ix)  increasing the land and property values for local residents in the Project areas; and \n(x)  improving the living environment and quality of life for local residents, particularly for the poor, women, \nand other vulnerable groups who live in the geohazard-prone areas and are isolated from urban services \nfor historic reasons.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis             Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues \n \nWuzhou is a mountainous city originating on a small plain at the intersection of two major rivers. Geographic and \ngeological conditions severely constrain sustained development of Wuzhou. The mountains in Wuzhou are formed \nfrom loose earth that is highly vulnerable to geological disasters such as landslides, slope collapses, and mud and \ndebris flows. Because of the lack of infrastructure to support urban expansion into geohazard-free lands, the city \nused to be confined to a small urban center where many low-income families built houses on marginal lands on the \nmountain slopes along the major valleys around the old urban center. Many of these densely populated valleys are \nclassified as geohazard-prone areas of the city. \n \nThe Project will benefit more than 468,000 urban residents in Wuzhou, of which 4.2% (or 20,410 persons) are poor \nand living under the minimum living guarantee (MLG) at CNY195 per capita per month. The urban poor mostly \nconsist of people with job laid-offs or unemployment, sickness, disabled family members, elderly, and low education \nlevels. The social analysis showed that these poor are mainly living in the geohazard-prone valleys with poor \ninfrastructure facilities and community services, where the population is densely concentrated. The housing and living \n ", "Appendix 12         53        \nenvironment are poor because of a serious water and soil erosion problem, environmental pollution, and fumes from \nwastewater and garbage in the air, which make people sick. More seriously, they often suffer from the loss of human \nlife, and property damage and associated economic losses, because of geological disasters such as landslides, \nmountain collapses, and mud and debris flows. During the rainy season, they live in fear of a possible geohazards \nevent. The insufficient road network, and the resulting limited access to community services and facilities, adds to \ntheir isolation from urban development opportunities and their overall poverty situation. The poor living in the \ngeohazard-prone valleys are among the least capable of avoiding and coping with the geohazards. They rely on \npublic investment to help free them from the long-lasting geohazard threats and catch up with the safe and secure \nliving conditions that become available in the geohazard-free areas of the city. \n \nUnder the NSDW, the Government has made substantial investments in transport development around Wuzhou, \nincluding three expressways, two railways, and one updated river transportation system along the rivers flowing \nthrough the city. The aim of these investments is to strengthen the connectivity of Guangxi and the neighboring \nprovinces, through the gateway city of Wuzhou, with national and international markets. Wuzhou is at a critical stage \nas it develops into a regional multimodal transportation center for Guangxi and the neighboring provinces. To achieve \nthis development objective, Wuzhou needs to first address the geohazard constraint to ensure sustained urban \ndevelopment, which will benefit not only the residents of Wuzhou but the overall poverty reduction strategy for \nGuangxi and the neighboring western provinces supported under the NSDW. \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe Project will help Wuzhou address the geohazard constraint through holistic urban planning and integrated public \ninvestment. The Project will have three components: two investment components and one capacity development \ncomponent. Under the Pingminchong geohazard and resettlement component, the Project will build a well-serviced \nresettlement community in a geohazard-free area to receive about 6,823 people (or 1,816 households) to be \nevacuated from the geohazard-prone Pingminchong valley. Although these are beneficiaries of the Project, the \nGovernment has agreed that relocation under this component  will be arranged in accordance  with the ADB \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). A resettlement plan has been prepared for this component. \n \nUnder the other investment component for Hongling road network and related infrastructure, the Project will build a \ncomprehensive 36.2-kilometer urban road network together with related municipal infrastructure to promote and \nfacilitate the urban expansion into the geohazard-free Hongling\u2014a new urban area between the newly constructed \nrailway station and the fully developed urban area. A separate resettlement plan has been developed in accordance \nwith the ADB Involuntary Resettlement Policy, which will guide the resettlement under the Project not only for the \npeople to be affected by the road construction itself but also the people living in the neighboring urban lands to be \ndeveloped together with the road network. \n \nUnder the capacity development component, the Project will help the city to establish a geographic information \nsystem (GIS)-compatible geohazard forecasting and early warning system to supplement the existing mass-based \ngeohazard monitoring and early warning system in Wuzhou. Consulting services will also be provided to strengthen \nthe public awareness of geohazard risk and its management through appropriate education programs.  \n    \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Project will directly benefit more than 486,000 urban residents of Wuzhou. About 49% of the beneficiary \npopulation are women, 4.2% are classified as poor living under the MLG at CNY195 per month, and 2.4% are ethnic \nminorities scattered in the city. \n \nEmployment Benefits. The Project will create 2,260 person-years of direct short-term jobs during the project \nconstruction phase, and 570 direct long-term jobs during the operation phase. In addition, about 10,100 short- to \nmedium-term new jobs will be created upon the completion of the road network and related infrastructure in Hongling. \nMore jobs are also to be created in the logistics service in support of the operation of the railway station and other \ntransport infrastructure.  \n \nThe WMG has agreed that priority in filling jobs should be given to vulnerable groups including the poor, ethnic \nminorities, and women. Under this arrangement, an estimated 40% of short-term jobs during the construction phase \nwill be filled by vulnerable groups\u2014about 20% for the poor and ethnic minorities, and about 20% for women. This \nindicates total earnings of CNY15.6 million. The same arrangement will be adopted for the long-term jobs during the \noperation phase, representing a total earning of CNY7.0 million. ADB and the WMG have agreed that ensuring jobs \nfor the vulnerable groups will be included in the project design and monitoring framework (DMF) and closely \nmonitored under the project performance monitoring system (PPMS).  \n ", "54        Appendix 12        \n \nImprovement of Living Standards. Under the Project, 1,816 households (or 6,832 persons), about 52% of which \nare low-income families, will be moved out of the geohazard-prone Pingminchong valley. These families will be \nprovided with an opportunity to resettle in a safe, secure, and well-serviced resettlement community to be constructed \nunder the Project in a geohazard-free urban area. Development of the new urban area of Hongling will provide \nsufficient geohazard-free urban lands to accommodate about 100,000 residents. The road network and related \ninfrastructure built under the Project will increase their mobility and access to basic urban services for local \npopulations, and remove one major constraint to urban development. The geohazard forecasting and early warning \nsystem to be introduced under the Project is expected to improve the accuracy of the geohazard forecasting and \nearly warning service by 50% from the 2007 baseline, reducing significantly the risks to Wuzhou residents imposed \ngeohazards.  \n \nSupport Gender Inclusion. Social analysis showed that women are primarily responsible for cleaning up the \ncommunities and repairing the households after geohazard incidents. The Project will address these burdens. Gender \ninclusion is also secured and promoted through the priority accorded to women for jobs. \n \nEthnic Minorities. A small percentage of ethnic minorities (2.4%) are living throughout Wuzhou city. The social \nanalysis determined that they are socially and economically integrated with the majority population and will not be \nsubject to any adverse impacts of the Project, including land acquisition and resettlement. The Project will prioritize \nthem for jobs. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1. The Project was formulated using various participatory methods and approaches for the poverty and social impact \nassessment, including 500 respondents random sampling socioeconomic survey in the project areas, stakeholder \nconsultation workshops, meetings, seminars, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews on issues related \nto geohazard resettlement, geohazard prevention and control, and development of urban road network and related \ninfrastructure in Hongling. The development of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) involved two rounds of public consultation. The formulation of the two resettlement plans \ninvolved separate socioeconomic surveys, community meetings, opinion surveys, and specific impact studies. The \nEMP and resettlement plans have set out detailed ongoing public participation plans. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing      Consultation     Collaborative decision making     Empowerment \n \n3. Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?   Yes    No  \n \nProject documents publicly disclosed at the project management office (PMO) of the WMG and on the ADB website \ninclude the project information document, design and monitoring framework, resettlement plans, summary EIA, report \nand recommendation of the President, public sector legal agreement, project administration memorandum, and social \nand environmental monitoring reports. Information booklets outlining the resettlement plans will be distributed to each \naffected household, and disclosure meetings will be held. Copies of the booklets will be made available at the PMO \nand each affected village office. To enhance the geohazard preparedness and environmental benefits of the Project, \nspecialized consulting services will be provided under the Project to strengthen the geohazard and environmental \nawareness in communities through the existing mass-based geohazard monitoring and early warning system in \nWuzhou.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues: \n \nResults from the household survey and focus group discussion indicate that women are primarily responsible for \ncleaning up the community and the affected houses after geological disasters, as well as for taking care of the sick, \nwounded, and elders, and for household-related traveling and socializing activities.  \n \nThe Project will help reduce the energy, time, and efforts spent by women on these activities, allowing them to \nengage more actively in income-generating activities, family entertainment, or leisure. The poverty and social \nassessment indicates that women strongly support the Project across all of the components. Women have perceived \nthat the Project will improve their quality of life and create jobs and income opportunities for them. \n2.  Key Actions.  \n \n Gender plan       Other actions/measures     No action/measure \n \n ", "Appendix 12         55        \nA Government assurance has obtained that women will be prioritized for jobs and skills trainings to be provided under \nthe Project. Under this arrangement, about 20% of the jobs will be filled by women during the project construction and \noperation phases. At the beginning of employment, job training will be provided to vulnerable groups, including \nwomen. Core labor standards and HIV/AIDS awareness training are included for all contracts under the Project, as \nprovided in the loan assurances.  \nIII.

The Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project does not have a revenue-generating \ncomponent. The implementing agency for the Project will be Wuzhou Dongtai State Assets \nOperations Corporation on behalf of the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG). However, the \nWMG, as the Executing Agency of the Project, will be responsible for providing counterpart \nfunds through equity contributions and borrowing from China Construction Bank (CCB). The \nWMG will be the owner and operator of the facilities constructed under the Project and will be \nresponsible for debt servicing. Dongtai will manage the construction of the Project, including \nprocuring goods and works, and contracting consulting services.  \n \n2.  This appendix  \n(i)   reviews the past financial performance of the WMG together with the projections \nfor future revenue inflow to assess the impact of the Project on the finances of \nthe WMG and its ability to provide counterpart funds and to meet debt servicing \nobligations;  \n(ii)   assesses  the  financial  management  system  and  procurement  capability  of \nDongtai to implement and manage the Project; and  \n(iii)   analyzes  the  potential  and  feasibility  of  the  Project  to  establish  a  revolving \nfinancing mechanism for additional geohazard mitigation projects in Wuzhou.  \n \nB.  Wuzhou Municipal Government \n \n1.  Financial Performance \n3.  The  WMG  has  several  sources  of  revenue,  including  (i)  taxes  and  charges,  and \n(ii) transfers  from  the  central  Government  and  the  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Region \ngovernment  (GZARG)  in  the  form  of  budgetary  support  and/or  project  financing.  Taxation \nrepresents the largest form of overall revenue generated by the municipality, but much of this is \ncollected for the central Government. In line with the sustained economic growth, the local tax \nrevenues  retained  by  the  WMG  have  grown  from  about  CNY232.2  million  in  2002  to \nCNY474.0 million in 2007\u2014an average annual rate of 15.3% over 6 years.  \n \n4.  Apart from the local share of taxation, the WMG has revenues from the state-owned \nenterprises and from the fees collected for municipal services, including education levies. Land \nsales, another important source of income, have increased rapidly from CNY21.3 million in 2002 \nto CNY708.5 million in the first half of 2008. In addition, transfers the form of budgetary support \nfrom the central Government and GZARG has increased significantly from CNY169.3 million to \nCNY321.2 million in that same period. \n \n5.  At the same time, the central Government and/or GZARG have invested in programs \nand projects for implementation by the WMG. Funded directly by the central Government or \nGZARG, they are not regarded as discretionary, but nevertheless reflect financial inflows into \nthe municipality. These total inflows from the central Government and GZARG, which are nearly \nas large as the WMG\u2019s retained revenue, are an important source of finance, especially for \ndevelopment projects. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 13        57        \nTable A13.1: Wuzhou Municipal Government Summary of Main  \nRevenue and Expenditure Items (CNY million) \nItema  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  Average Annual Growth \nRevenues              % \nTotal WMG  554.2    744.9    979.1    983.5  1,028.3  1,227.9  17.2 \nTotal Central Government \nand GZARG  515.6    525.7    511.3    721.6    837.5  1,239.5  19.2 \nExpenditures               \nOperational Expenses  828.1    999.3  1,207.6    939.1  1,453.3  1,467.4  12.1 \nTotal Capital Works  183.0    522.4    547.5     653.4    871.6  1,252.6  46.9 \nTotal Expenditure  883.3  1,101.1  1,288.7  1,611.8  1,761.0  2,720.0  25.2 \nAnnual Surplus  48.8        59.3     110.5     112.6    104.8     120.0  19.7 \nGZARG = Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government, WMG = Wuzhou municipal government. \na  The revenue and expenditure items listed represent the largest flows.

The total expenditure of the WMG grew at 25.2% per year from 2002 to 2007, compared \nwith the growth in construction and development projects at 46.9% over the same period. This \nhas led to an increase in the share of capital works in the total expenditure, from 20.7% in 2002 \nto 46.2% in 2007. Despite the higher expenditure for capital works, the WMG has maintained a \nmodest surplus at about 5% of revenues over expenditures each year. \n \n2.  Financial Projections \n \n7.  The financial projections for the WMG assumed that the revenues and expenditures will \ngrow at 15%1 per year over the next 3 years (covering real and inflationary increases), generally \nin  line  with  its  past  performance,  before  gradually  slowing  to  8%  from  2015  onwards. \nOperational expenses are expected to grow at the historical high rate of 12% per year, while the \ncontinued rapid growth in capital works is expected to moderate by 2012. \n \nTable A13.2: Projections of Wuzhou Municipal Government Revenues and Expenditures \n(CNY million)  \nItem  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2015  2020 \n Growth (%)    15.0 15.0 15.0 12.0 12.0  8.0 8.0\nRevenues/Sources                 \nTotal WMG  1,227.9  1,410.6 1,621.1 1,863.7 1,973.0 2,096.5  2,521.7 3,498.4\nBudget Transfer  321.2  369.4 424.8 488.5 547.1 612.8  800.8 1,176.6\nSubtotal  1,549.1  1,780.0 2,045.9 2,352.2 2,520.1 2,709.3  3,322.5 4,675.0\nReserves used for projects  807.9  904.8 1,013.4 1,135.0 1,237.2 1,348.5  1,621.1 2,069.0\nCentral Government and \nGZARG for projects  483.0  670.0 746.4 830.8 914.7 1,031.0  1,123.7 1,042.0\nLess : WMG Surplus  120.0  174.0 199.9 229.9 246.3 264.8  324.7 456.9\nTotal  2,720.0  3,083.9 3,497.2 3,966.6 4,323.6 4,712.7  5,665.4 7,230.6\nExpenditures                  \nOperational   1,467.4  1,643.4 1,840.7 2,061.5 2,247.1 2,449.3  2,944.4 3,757.9\nCapital Works   1,252.6  1,440.5 1,656.6 1,905.1 2,076.5 2,263.4  2,720.9 3,472.7\nTotal Expenditure  2,720.0  3,083.9 3,497.2 3,966.6 4,323.6 4,712.7  5,665.4 7,230.6\nGZARG = Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region government, WMG = Wuzhou municipal government. \na  The revenue and expenditure items listed represent the largest flows.

Impact of Equity Contribution and Loan Repayments \n \n8.  Based on the estimated cost of the Project and the proposed financing plan, the WMG is \nexpected to make an equity contribution of CNY111.3 million per year from 2009 to 2013. This \nrepresents about 5.4% of the WMG\u2019s discretionary revenue in 2009, with a declining trend to \nabout 3.8% in 2013 in line with the continued growth in the WMG\u2019s retained revenues. In terms \nof the proportion in the capital expenditures of the WMG (Table A13.3), the equity contribution \nfor the Project will account for about 3.7% of the overall capital expenditures at the peak in \n2009. The WMG should be able to meet the counterpart funding requirements. \n \nTable A13.3: Wuzhou Municipal Government\u2014Impact of Equity Contributions \n(CNY million) \nItem  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013 \nEquity Contributions  111.3 111.3 111.3 111.3  111.3\nWuzhou Municipal Government \nIncome  2,045.9 2,352.2 2,520.1 2,709.3  2,901.3\nEquity/Income (%)  5.4 4.7 4.4 4.1  3.8\nCapital Expenditure  1,656.6 1,905.1 2,076.5 2,263.4  2,421.8\nEquity/Capital Expenditures (%)  6.7 5.8 5.4 4.9  3.8\nAnnual Surplus  199.9 229.9 246.3 264.8  283.5\nEquity/Surplus (%)  55.7 48.4 45.2 42.0  39.3\nSource: Wuzhou Municipal Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9.  Based on the provided lending terms of the loans from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and CCB, the WMG will need to make payments for both principal and interests on the \nloans from 2014 onwards. The debt servicing will start at the highest level of CNY211.6 million \nin 2014, and will gradually decline to CNY161.1 million by 2019. The debt service will represent \n6.8% of the WMG revenue in 2014, and will gradually decline to 3.7% in 2019. As a share of the \ntotal operational expenses of the WMG, which include its debt servicing obligations for all the \noutstanding loans and debt servicing requirement for the loans from ADB and CCB under the \nProject, the debt servicing obligations from the Project will represent 7.6% in 2014, declining to \n4.5% in 2019. These payments will represent about 69.5% of the surplus of the WMG in 2014. \nBased  on  these  analyses,  the  WMG  is  considered  capable  of  meeting  the  debt  service \nrequirements of the Project, without placing undue pressure on its other expenditures. \n \nTable A13.4: Wuzhou Municipal Government Impact of Interest and Principal Repayments  \n(CNY million) \nItem  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019 \nTotal Interest and Principal (Debt Service) 211.6 201.5 191.4 181.3  171.2  161.1\nWuzhou municipal government income  3114.1 3,322.5 3,549.4 3,796.3  4,065.0  4,357.2\nDebt Service/Income (%)  6.8 6.1 5.4 4.8  4.2  3.7\nOperational Expenses  2,804.2 2,944.4 3,091.6 3,246.2  3,408.5  3,579.0\nDebt Service/Expenses (%)  7.6 6.8 6.2 5.6  5.0  4.5\nAnnual Surplus  304.3 324.7 346.9 371.0  397.3  425.8\nDebt Service/Surplus (%)  69.5 61.1 55.2 48.9  43.1  37.8\nSource: Wuzhou Municipal Government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n10.

Dongtai State Assets Operations Corporation \n \n1.  Business Activities  \n \n11.  Dongtai  is  a  state-owned  enterprise,  wholly  owned  by  the  WMG.  Dongtai\u2019s  major \nbusinesses include (i) undertaking municipal development projects for the WMG; (ii) supervising \nand managing development projects; (iii) collecting rent for shops, markets, and offices on \nproperties that it owns; and (iv) conducting procurement for other government agencies. Dongtai \nis designated by the WMG as the implementing agency, which will be responsible for carrying \nout  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project,  including  procuring  goods  and  works,  and \ncontracting consulting services.  \n \n2.  Assessment of Financial Management and Procurement Capability \n \n12.  Following ADB guidelines for financial management assessment,2 an assessment was \nconducted for Dongtai, which showed that Dongtai has an adequate computerized financial \naccounting system and established financial management procedures to document, monitor, \nmanage, and report the flow of funds, operation transactions, and project physical progress.  \n \n13.  A similar assessment was conducted to assess the procurement capacity of Dongtai. \nThe  assessment  noted  that  Dongtai  has  a  procurement  department,  which  serves  as  a \ngovernment procurement center mainly for goods and equipment. The procurement department \nis equipped with proper office and equipment, including a computerized system for a staff of five \nprofessionals with experience to undertake public procurement following the Procurement Law \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n14.  However, Dongtai has no experience in implementing foreign-funded projects. As such, \nDongtai  will  need  specialized  training  and  technical  support,  particularly  in  policies  and \noperational and procedural requirements of ADB, to implement the Project. Given the capacity \ndevelopment  component  included  in  the  Project,  Dongtai  will  receive  technical  support  for \ncapacity development and institutional strengthening, which is considered sufficient to ensure a \nsmooth project implementation.  \n \nD.  Establishment of a Revolving Financing Mechanism for Geohazard Management \n \n15.  As a special benefit, the Project will use the surplus from the sale of the reengineered \nland, after deducting the redevelopment costs, to establish a revolving funding mechanism for \nfuture geohazard management projects in Wuzhou. Under the Pingminchong valley geohazard \nresettlement and prevention component, 19.27 hectares (ha) of geohazard-free urban land will \nbe developed. After deducting the allowance for public infrastructure, such as roads, footpaths, \nand reserves, a total area of 13.49 ha (or 202.3 mu), plus 50 mu of land on top of the \nPingminchong ridge, will become available for sale. At the estimated cost of CNY367 million for \nredevelopment and resettlement, the Project is expected to generate a surplus of CNY43.7 \nmillion if the land sale is at the current price of CNY1.6 million per mu for similar urban land in \nWuzhou. \n \n16.  Table A13.5 indicates that the amount of surplus is sensitive to the land sale price \nachieved. A land sale of at least CNY1.43 million per mu will ensure that the WMG will achieve \na surplus that could be applied towards establishment of the revolving funding mechanism for \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005.

Introduction \n \n1.  The economic analysis of the proposed Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project \ncovers  project  justification,  general  parameters  for  economic  analysis,  project  costs  and \nbenefits, least-cost analysis, and calculations of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The \nEIRR is calculated separately for each of the two investment components under the Project\u2014\nPingminchong  geohazard  resettlement  and  prevention  component  and  the  Hongling  road \nnetwork and related infrastructure component\u2014and for the Project as a whole. \n \nB.  Project Benefits \n \n2.  Pingminchong Component. The economic benefits of the Pingminchong component \nare derived from a comparison between \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d scenarios. The \nbenefits of the \u201cwith project\u201d scenario include (i) the avoidance of property damage and loss of \nlife loss because people were relocated out of the geohazard-prone valley, and the savings in \nthe maintenance cost for slope protection and retaining walls; and (ii) an increase in land values \nin Pingminchong because of the engineering treatment to be conducted under the Project for \ngeohazard prevention. The economic benefits for the Pingminchong component are estimated \nat CNY263 million, measured in net present value (NPV). \n  \n3.  The  Pingminchong  component  is  proposed  and  designed  as  a  social  development \nproject with an emphasis on improving the living conditions of the people who live in this poorly \nserviced  and  geohazard-prone  valley.  This  will  be  achieved  by  moving  the  geohazard-\nthreatened community out of the valley and relocating them in a well-serviced resettlement \ncommunity to be constructed at the geohazard-free urban area of Zaochong. Although the \nbenefits from better living conditions are not included in the calculation of EIRR, such benefits \nare estimated to facilitate a better understanding of the other benefits to be generated by the \nProject. Using the difference in rental prices between the housing in the geohazard-prone \nPingminchong  valley  and  those  in  a  resettlement  community  under  similar  socioeconomic, \ngeographic, and geological conditions such as Zaochong as a surrogate indicator, the benefits \nfrom better living standards are estimated at CNY275 million.  \n \n4.  Hongling  Component.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  Hongling  component  include \n(i) time savings, fuel savings, vehicle operating cost savings, and accident cost reductions \nthrough the provision of a systematic road network for the Hongling area; (ii) increases in land \nvalues because of the municipal infrastructure to be provided under the Project; and (iii) faster \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth because of the improvement in infrastructure. Since land \nvalue increases are conceptually included in the GDP spillover, they are not included in the \ncalculation of EIRR for this component.  \n \n5.  Using a rate of return at 26.7% established in the recent literature on economic analysis \nfor investments in road infrastructure in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the net benefits \nto  nonagricultural  GDP  from  the  Hongling  component  are  estimated  at  CNY2.17  billion, \nmeasured in NPV.  \n \n6.  Apart from the general economic benefits related to infrastructure development (para. 5), \nthe Hongling component will also bring in some itemized benefits, particularly by providing (i) \nbadly needed geohazard-free urban lands to accommodate continued urban expansion away \n ", "62      Appendix 14 \nfrom the geohazard-prone areas; and (ii) counterpart infrastructure in support of the operation of \nthe newly constructed railway station, which would not be able to start normal operation without \na properly developed surrounding urban area in Hongling. Although not included in the EIRR \ncalculation, these benefits are estimated to facilitate a better understanding of the other benefits \nto be generated by the Project. The impact of the railway station and related investment on local \nGDP,  which  is  calculated  separately  using  an  empirically  identified  relationship,  is \nconservatively estimated at CNY2.63 billion.  \n \nC.  General Parameters \n \n7.  The economic evaluation is based on 2008 prices. As cost estimates are provided at \n2008 prices, they do not require an adjustment for inflation. A shadow exchange rate factor of \n1.013 has been used to convert border prices to domestic economic prices. Similarly a shadow \nexchange rate of $1 = CNY7.01 is adopted to calculate the economic cost of the principal \ntradable items. \n \n8.  All the cost items are valued at domestic prices after deduction of taxes and duties, \nexcept for (i) unskilled labor, (ii) fuel, and (iii) the capital cost of vehicles. Unskilled labor is \nvalued at a shadow wage rate of 0.80 (i.e., 80% of the estimated wage rate on the Project). The \neconomic opportunity cost of capital at 12% per year is adopted as the social discount rate for \nthe economic evaluation.  \n \nD.  Economic Costs \n \n9.  The economic costs for the Pingminchong component include (i) the cost to build a well-\nserviced resettlement community at the geohazard-free urban area at Zaochong, (ii) the cost to \nrelocate the current households living in Pingminchong valley into the resettlement community \nat Zaochong, and (iii) the engineering treatment cost at the evacuated Pingminchong valley for \ngeohazard prevention. The economic costs for the Hongling component include (i) construction \ncosts, including land acquisition and resettlement; and (ii) operation and maintenance costs.  \n \nE.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n10.  Pingminchong  Component.  To  help  the  people  living  in  the  geohazard-prone \nPingminchong valley get rid of the long-lasting geohazard threat, an alternative analysis has \nbeen carried out between two general options of geohazard management: (i) strengthening the \ntraditional  approach  by  building  stronger  retaining  walls  against  geohazard  incidents,  or \n(ii) moving  the  geohazard-threatened  community  out  of  the  geohazard-prone  valley  and \nrelocating them to a well-serviced geohazard-free urban area. Experience has shown that the \ntraditional approach could not provide adequate protection for the residents in geohazard-prone \nvalleys  against  geological  disasters.  Despite  continually  building  and  rehabilitating  slope \nprotections and retaining walls over the past 50 years, Wuzhou experiences more than a dozen \nlandslides and slope collapses every year. In extreme weather, rainstorms wash away the \nconcrete  retaining  walls  together  with  housing  structures  built  on  the  mountains  slopes. \nResidents living in the geohazard-prone valleys experience several emergency evacuations with \nsevere interruption to their daily life and livelihood during the raining season from June to \nAugust each year.  \n \n11.  Compared with the low level of protection and high recurrent costs for maintenance and \nrehabilitation of slope protection and retaining walls under the traditional approach, relocation of \npeople out of the geohazard-prone valley is a more cost-effective approach to freeing people \n ", "Appendix 14       63        \nfrom the geohazard threat for good\u2014although it involves a larger one-time capital investment. \nFurthermore, under the Project, the evacuated Pingminchong valley will be converted into \ngeohazard-free land for urban redevelopment. The investment for Pingminchong component will \nnot only help people cope with geohazard incidents, it will also help Wuzhou to achieve the \ncombined goals of disaster avoidance and prevention, human settlement improvement, and \nurban redevelopment.   \n \n12.  Hongling Component. Given the geographic and geological conditions of Wuzhou, the \ncity has only two directions for a relatively large scale of urban expansion: (i) to the south across \nthe Xunjiang and/or Xijiang River, and (ii) to the west on the north bank of Xunjiang and/or \nXijiang River. Expansion first into the west along the northern bank is the least-cost approach \nbecause  of  (i) its  proximity  to  the  existing  urban  infrastructure  facilities  and  urban  service \nnetworks available, and (ii) the additional costs of building bridges to facilitate urban expansion \nacross the Xunjiang and/or Xijiang River.  \n \nF.  Calculation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n13.  The EIRR calculation takes into account only the main benefits from the two investment \ncomponents, but includes all the project-related costs. The EIRR for Pingminchong component \nis 19.3%, while the EIRR for the Hongling component is 20.9%.  \n \n14.  The EIRR for the Project as a whole is 20.7%. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for the \nEIRR of the Project as a whole. The analysis showed that the EIRR will decrease to (i) 19.1% in \nthe case of 10% cost overrun; (ii) 18.8% in the case of 10% decrease in the benefits; (iii) 18.1% \nif project implementation is delayed by 1 year; or (iv) 15.2% if all the adverse impacts of (i), (ii), \nand (iii) take place together. Table 14.1 shows the summary of the EIRR; Table 14.2 provides \nthe analysis under different scenarios.  \n \nTable A14.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rate of Return \nComponent  NPV (CNY million)  EIRR (%) \nHongling road networks  634  20.9 \nPingminchong hazard resettlement and prevention  69  19.3 \nWhole project   697  20.7 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nTable A14.2: Sensitivity Analysis of Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nfor the Whole Project \nChange in Variables  Change in Values  NPV (CNY million)  EIRR (%) \nBase Case   0  697   20.7 \n(i) Capital Cost Overrun   10%  600   19.1 \n(ii) Benefit Reduction   (10%)  521   18.8 \n(iii) Implementation Delay   1 year  530   18.1 \n(iv) Combination of i, ii, and iii     278  15.2 \n    ( ) = negative. \n  EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "64      Appendix 14 \nG.  Distribution Analysis and Poverty Reduction Impact  \n \n15.  A distribution analysis was conducted to assess the distribution of the benefits of the \nProject among the major stakeholders: (i) the Government and/or economy, (ii) laborers, and \n(iii) local households and/or consumers. \n \n16.  At  the  social  discount  rate  of  12%,  the  net  gain  of  the  Project  is  calculated  as \nCNY1,242.4 million, which is distributed among the major stakeholders in the following pattern: \n \n(i)   The Government: CNY355.6 million (28.6%).  \n(ii)   Laborers: CNY6.3 million (0.5%).  \n(iii)   Local  households  and/or  consumers:  CNY880.4  million  (70.9%).  Given  the \ndominance of civil works in the Project, a significant part of the net gain for \nlaborers will accrue to the unskilled laborers.  \n \n17.  The distribution analysis found that 13.4% of the net economic benefits from the Project \nwill accrue to the poor, who account for 4.2% of the urban population in Wuzhou. The analysis \nconcludes that the Project will play a significant role in promoting pro-poor economic growth.  \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081128095006+08'00'", "Author": "mpa", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "guangxi wuzhou urban development, guangxi wuzhou china, geohazard management system, prc urban development, china municipal infrastructure facilities, pingminchong valley geohazard, hongling road network, geographic information system, adb project 40642", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081217145353+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Loan: Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project"}, "author_page": " \n \nVice-President  C.
