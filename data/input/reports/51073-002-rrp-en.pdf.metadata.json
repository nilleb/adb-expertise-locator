Investment Program Summary\nThe investment project will finance the first of three prioritized corridors of the planned regional rapid transit system (RRTS)\nnetwork in India's National Capital Region (NCR). The Delhi-Meerut RRTS will pass through the densely populated sections of\nthe NCR, connecting Delhi to Meerut in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The 82-kilometer corridor will provide safe, reliable, and\nhigh-capacity commuter transit services between various locations along the corridor. The investment project will finance rail\ntrack, signaling, station buildings, and maintenance facilities. It will also support capacity and institutional development of the\nNational Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), a joint venture company of the Government of India and states of\nDelhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, that is mandated to implement the RRTS project across the NCR. A grant from\nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will promote improved mobility and economic opportunities for women and\ndifferently-abled groups along the corridor.\nImpact: Urban mobility in the National Capital Region improved\nOutcome: Efficiency, safety, social inclusiveness, and environmental sustainability of transport in the Delhi-Meerut RRTS\ncorridor improved\nOutputs: (i) Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor commissioned, (ii) Institutional capacity of the NCRTC strengthened,  and (iii) Mobility\nand economic opportunities of women and differently abled improved\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and National Capital Region Transport Corporation will\nbe the executing agencies.\nProject Readiness: Readiness is high as the complete scope to be financed by the MFF has been appraised by ADB.\nEnvironmental and social due diligence have been completed for the entire corridor. Geotechnical investigations have been\ndone and detailed design work is in progress. To minimize delays, preconstruction activities such as utility shifting for various\nsections of the corridor are ongoing. The COVID-19 pandemic has not affected the project implementation arrangements or cost\nestimate. The project implementation period of 7 years provides adequate cushion for some delays. Based on government\norders, guidelines and standard operating procedures have been developed and are being strictly implemented for resumption\nof regular works at various NCRTC site offices and construction sites. Strict compliance monitoring is to be ensured by chief\nproject managers.\n9.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Delhi\u2013Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System \nInvestment Project. The investment project will finance the first of three prioritized rail corridors of \nthe planned regional rapid transit system (RRTS) network in India\u2019s National Capital Region \n(NCR). The Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS will pass through the densely populated sections of the NCR, \nconnecting Delhi to Meerut in the state of Uttar Pradesh. It will provide safe, reliable, and high-\ncapacity commuter transit services along the corridor. The investment project is included in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for India.1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \n2.  Development problem. The NCR, covering an area of over 58,000 square kilometers \n(km), is a coordinated planning region encompassing Delhi and several districts surrounding it \nfrom the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The NCR and the associated NCR \nPlanning Board were created in 1985 to plan the development of the region and to evolve \nharmonized policies for the control of land use and infrastructure development. Prominent cities \nof the NCR include Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Meerut. Contributing nearly 8% \nof India\u2019s gross domestic product, the NCR\u2019s importance has grown with the country\u2019s economic \ngrowth. The NCR is the fastest-growing urban agglomeration in India, registering an average of \n33% decadal population growth since 1980. From 46 million in 2011, the NCR\u2019s population is \nincreasing rapidly and is projected to reach 64 million by 2021, with an urbanization rate of 71% \n(45 million).2 \n \n3.  The city of Delhi\u2014accounting for 37% of the total NCR population while only covering \n4.4% of the NCR area\u2014has been facing unprecedented growth as it acts as a powerful national \njob magnet, particularly for neighboring states. The large influx of migrants has led to extreme \ntraffic congestion, lack of space for development of essential basic infrastructure like water supply \nand sewerage, and lack of affordable housing. Congestion is estimated to cost $9.6 billion (about \n12% of Delhi\u2019s gross domestic product) annually in wasted fuel, reduced productivity, air pollution, \nand accidents.3 In 2017, 6,673 traffic accidents were recorded in Delhi\u20141,565 of which resulted \nin fatalities, the highest among cities in India with 1 million people or more. The growing traffic \nlevels have also contributed to worsening air pollution levels, making Delhi one of the most \npolluted cities in the world.4 \n \n4.  The unicentric development focus on Delhi, with a few satellite cities near Delhi emerging \nas business hubs, has prevented the NCR from realizing its true economic potential as it leaves \nother subregions to struggle.5 Eight districts in the NCR, covering nearly 15,000 square km, are \npart of Uttar Pradesh, which is one of the poorest states in the country with per capita incomes \nless than half the national average. In 2018, Uttar Pradesh registered the highest unemployment \nrate in urban areas, at nearly 16%. Women and differently abled people are often less well-placed \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

The incidence of unemployment among \nfemale graduates in the state (14.7%) is double the national average (7.3%), and 65% of the \nstate\u2019s differently abled population do not have work.6 Special attention needs to be given to \nimproving the safety and mobility of women and differently abled travelers to ensure that benefits \nof wider job opportunities and more controlled development of Delhi are shared across different \ngroups of the population. \n \n5.  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Plans for transport arteries to enhance \nregional connectivity have become critical for the inclusive and sustainable development of the \nNCR. This is further highlighted with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed Delhi\u2019s long-\nstanding migration problem. As the country went into lockdown, millions of migrant workers in \nDelhi and its satellite towns were left stranded without immediate jobs and incomes, in very basic \nconditions away from their families. Good regional connectivity will allow workers to live with their \nfamilies under better living conditions in other NCR towns, where the cost of living is lower and \nquality of life is better. Fast and comfortable commuting will bring about a paradigm shift in the \nway people travel and work in the NCR. The development of Delhi will be more controlled and \nregulated, relieving pressure on Delhi and leading to polycentric urban development in the NCR. \n \n6.  The NCR Regional Plan 2021 recommends integrating regional centers with each other \nand the capital through an integrated transport network to induce growth and development of \nsettlements in the NCR.7 Regional connectivity enhancement, through mass transport systems \nwhich are well-integrated with land use patterns, will facilitate the outward pull of people from \nDelhi. The Functional Plan on Transport, 2032 was then developed to detail the specific policies \nof the regional plan related to the transport sector.8 \n \n7.  Road map. The Functional Plan on Transport recommended an integrated multimodal \ntransport system to improve the mobility of both people and goods in the NCR. The plan \nspecifically includes a proposal for the construction of eight rail corridors to connect Delhi to other \ncities in the NCR with high-speed commuter trains under the RRTS. The government has \nprioritized three rail corridors for implementation. The first corridor will be the northeast Delhi\u2013\nMeerut corridor (82 km) connecting Delhi to Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Duhai, and Meerut in Uttar \nPradesh, one of the most densely populated sections in the NCR.9 While the national railway \nsystem connects these towns to central Delhi, most of the existing track capacity is dedicated to \nlong-distance express trains unable to serve commuters between Delhi and Meerut.10 The second \ncorridor (180 km) will be the Delhi\u2013Gurugram\u2013Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror\u2013Alwar corridor, \npassing through urbanized and industrialized areas of Haryana and Rajasthan, and connecting \nto Delhi airport.11 The third corridor (103 km) will connect Delhi to Panipat in the state of Haryana. \nAll three corridors will converge at the multimodal hub to be constructed at Sarai Kale Khan in \nDelhi. The three prioritized corridors will be integrated with the airport, eight Delhi Metro stations, \n \n6  R. Mamgain and S. Verick. 2017.

The scheduled travel \ntime from Delhi to Meerut by rail is, on average, 2 hours but the actual time may be 3\u20134 hours since the line is \nextremely congested and operating at more than 170% of design capacity. \n11 The Japan International Cooperation Agency, which has financed the Delhi Metro and other metro projects in India, \nis expected to finance this corridor. \n ", "3 \nthree interstate bus terminals, and two Indian Railways stations in the capital, apart from several \nother towns in the NCR. \n \n8.  Implementation of the RRTS gained impetus with the establishment of the National Capital \nRegion Transport Corporation (NCRTC), a joint venture company with equity investment of the \nGovernment of India (50%) and the states of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh (each \n12.5%). The NCRTC is mandated to implement the RRTS project across the four participating \nstates.12 The operations of these corridors are expected to be undertaken by a private sector \noperator engaged by the NCRTC. The NCRTC board of directors is fully authorized to make \ntechnical decisions and the corporation depends on the government principally for funding and \nland  acquisition.  This  arrangement  has  proven  to  be  very  effective  in  reducing  political \ninterference in other infrastructure projects in India. Apart from the construction and operation of \nthese corridors, the NCRTC will also assist state governments to implement transit-oriented \ndevelopment (TOD) and value capture financing (VCF) schemes that will provide additional \nrevenue streams to enhance the financial sustainability of such projects. Since the NCRTC is a \nrelatively new organization tasked with implementing these innovative and transformational \nrailway corridors, it will need considerable support for institutional and capacity building. \n \n9.  Policy framework. The development of rail-based mass transit systems is governed by \nthree main policies. The National Urban Transport Policy (2006) of the government encourages \nthe development of high-capacity public transport systems through special purpose vehicles and \noffers financial support either in the form of equity or one-time viability gap financing.13 \n \n10.  The National Transit Oriented Development Policy (2017) supports the development of \ndense, mixed-use developments around strategically located transit nodes, preferably within a 5\u2013\n10-minute walking distance. TOD focuses on creating development patterns that facilitate the use \nof public transit as a primary mode of transport.14 The proposed RRTS corridor will expand and \nintegrate new areas and trigger spatial and economic development. This will help achieve \nsustainable development in the NCR through integration of land use and transportation. Real \nestate development activity will increase as newer areas are developed and real estate valuations \nand  transactions  increase.  The  preparation  work  for  the  investment  project  has  identified \n\u201cinfluence zones\u201d of all the RRTS stations together with four \u201cspecial development areas.\u201d15 These \nare proposed to be earmarked as TOD zones in accordance with the TOD Policy, which envisages \nincreased land use density along the influence area of the corridor and at all selected transit \nstations. \n \n11.  The Metro Rail Policy (2017) emphasizes the benefits of mass rapid transit systems, \nparticularly in urban areas, and the state governments\u2019 commitment to provide required support \nto metro rail companies and agencies to ensure financial sustainability during operations. The \npolicy also mandates state governments to implement VCF. This is a mechanism for additional \nrevenue generation through the recovery of some or all of the additional value that is generated \nby public infrastructure.16 While the concept is still at a nascent stage in India, some of the mass \ntransit projects in different Indian states have successfully utilized at least one or two VCF \n \n12 The NCRTC was incorporated on 1 August 2013. \n13 Government of India, MOHUA. 2006.

Strategic  context.  Strengthening  urban  mass  transit  systems  and  increasing  the \nenvironmental sustainability of cities through the development of railways is well-recognized in \nIndia\u2019s transport and regional plans and in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for India.19 \nThe investment project is aligned with all three pillars of ADB\u2019s CPS on (i) boosting economic \ncompetitiveness by expanding infrastructure networks and corridor development, (ii) providing \ninclusive access to these infrastructure networks, and (iii) addressing climate change. The \ninvestment project fits well with the emphasis of ADB\u2019s CPS on transformative investments of a \nnational flagship nature to deliver total solutions to the country\u2019s burgeoning problems such as \nunorganized urbanization by adopting a cross-sector approach. ADB will support long-term urban \ndevelopment planning, which will ensure seamless travel between Delhi and other NCR cities and \nimprove links across the NCR. \n \n13.  Post-COVID-19. The investment project remains highly relevant in a post-COVID-19 \nstrategic context. Efforts are being made to restart the economy and to mitigate the adverse \nimpact of the lockdown, particularly on employment of the vulnerable population. Investing in \npublic  transit  infrastructure  will  create  employment  opportunities  during  construction  and \noperation and also generate demand and kickstart the economy through the growth of businesses, \nimproved  quality  of  living,  and  equitable  access  to  infrastructure.  India\u2019s  economic  survey \nestimates that an investment of \u20b91 in railways has a multiplier effect of \u20b95 in other sectors of the \neconomy. The RRTS has the ability to create demand in various allied sectors of the economy \nand to provide employment opportunities in the form of direct, indirect, and induced jobs. \n \n14.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nand explicitly focuses on key operational priorities (Table 1).20 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nKey Operational Priorities  Project Contributions \nAddressing remaining  Improving standards of living. The project will provide universal access to safe, \npoverty and reducing  reliable urban transport services that promote social inclusion and development \ninequalities  particularly for vulnerable groups by facilitating mobility and improving accessibility \nto centers of job opportunities. \nTackling climate change,  Reducing GHG emissions. The project will support climate change mitigation by \nbuilding climate and  encouraging commuters to shift from road-based public urban transport to the RRTS \ndisaster resilience, and  as a sustainable transport mode with lower GHG emissions. \nenhancing environmental  Ensuring climate and disaster resilience.

Lessons. The importance of intracity urban transit has been recognized worldwide, and \nlessons can be learned from extended urban agglomerations in Hong Kong, China; the Republic \nof  Korea;  Taipei,China;  and  Thailand,  where  train  systems  serve  as  the  main  transport \nbackbone.21 ADB\u2019s initial involvement in the urban transport subsector in India was to assist in \npolicy and strategy aspects in line with the National Urban Transport Policy. ADB has also \nsupported the development of the Guidelines and Toolkits for Urban Transport Development in \nMedium-Sized Cities in India; the Jaipur Metro Rail Line 1-Phase B Project, where it financed the \nextension of the first metro train line in Jaipur and drew up plans to build a second line for the \nnorth\u2013south corridor; and the Mumbai Metro Rail Systems Project to expand the metro network \nin India\u2019s financial capital.22 \n \n16.  Metro and railway projects financed by ADB in India have shown that the following are \nvital to delivering high-quality projects in a timely manner: (i) conducting advance planning and \ndetailed project preparation; (ii) ensuring that executing agencies have strong capacity for project \npreparation, procurement, and implementation; (iii) ensuring multimodal integration; and (iv) \nconsidering operation and maintenance (O&M) requirements at an early stage. These lessons \nhave been carefully incorporated. Additional training has been conducted to strengthen capacity \nin project preparation and procurement. Multimodal integration plans have been reviewed and \nnecessary elements to ensure intermodal interchanges have been incorporated in the station \ndesigns.23 Through ADB technical assistance (TA), a \u201cshadow operator\u201d has been appointed at \nan early stage to review operational plans and provide recommendations.24 \n \nIII.  THE INVESTMENT PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The investment project is aligned with the following impact: urban mobility in the NCR \nimproved (footnote 13). With a design speed of 180 km per hour and high-frequency operations \nof every 5\u201310 minutes, this 82-km corridor is expected to reduce the journey time from 3\u20134 hours \n \n21 International Experience from Regional Transit Systems (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n22 ADB. 2006.

The investment project will have the following outcome: efficiency, safety, social \ninclusiveness, and environmental sustainability of transport in the Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS corridor \nimproved.25 \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n18.  Output 1: Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS corridor commissioned. The investment project will help \nfinance the construction of the 82 km Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS corridor, including civil works, railway \ntracks, station buildings, multimodal hubs, maintenance depots, and traction and power supply.26 \nThe corridor will be built on elevated viaducts and will go underground (14 km) in heavily \npopulated areas. It will connect Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to Modipuram in Meerut.27 The viaduct \nwill be built along the central median of the national highway connecting Delhi to Meerut, wherever \nfeasible. The investment project also includes (i) construction of depots at Duhai and Modipuram \nfor the maintenance of rolling stock and fixed assets, and an operation control center and stabling \nyard at Jangpura; (ii) 24 stations integrating design features that are friendly to the elderly, women, \nchildren, and differently abled (EWCD), at least five of which are to be developed as major \nmultimodal hubs; 28 and (iii) closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed to monitor coaches \nand public areas of all stations, and pick-up and drop-off areas. \n \n19.  Output  2:  Institutional  capacity  of  the  National  Capital  Region  Transport \nCorporation strengthened. Although the NCRTC\u2019s scope as a special purpose vehicle is limited \nto implementing the RRTS, the large-scale nature of the investment project requires a high level \nof capacity in managing projects, contracts, and document flow, including financial reporting and \nauditing. The project will (i) develop an institutional strategy including an organizational, financial, \nand technology plan; (ii) develop training programs in project and contract management, financial \nmanagement, procurement, and safeguards; (iii) adopt a gender-friendly workplace policy; (iv) \nsupport the NCRTC in developing a TOD action plan and VCF instruments for enhancing financial \nsustainability;  and  (v)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  NCRTC  to  undertake  public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) initiatives. \n \n20.  Output 3: Mobility and economic opportunities of women and the differently abled \nimproved. The investment project will ensure that the RRTS improves urban mobility, and its \neconomic impacts will benefit women and the differently abled. The project will include (i) training; \n(ii) provision of mobility aids; (iii) safe mobility for EWCD; (iv) increased awareness on safe \nmobility, self-defense, and improved employability skills for selected female students along the \nRRTS corridor; and (v) provision of gender-inclusive, socially inclusive, and environmentally \nsustainable public toilets around RRTS stations. The project will also maximize the spillover \neffects of developing the RRTS and multimodal hubs, encouraging more women and differently \nabled people to engage in employment and other economic activities. \n \n21.  Finance-plus and value added by ADB assistance. The investment project provides a \nnew type of rail-based regional urban transport system in India, combining high speeds, widely \nspaced stations, and metro-like operations. ADB will assist the NCRTC in developing the first of \nthree prioritized corridors, which will have a substantial demonstration effect for future corridor \ndevelopment. ADB assistance will help develop innovative elements that require international \n \n25 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n26 ADB financing will not include rolling stock or the signaling and telecommunications system. \n27 About 20 km of the RRTS line from Partapur to Modipuram will be used to run the proposed Meerut Metro, originally \nplanned as a parallel line to the RRTS. This section will have six stations dedicated for Meerut Metro. \n28 Two stations are at-grade catering to depots. Major multimodal hubs are RRTS stations that will include easy \ninterchange to rail, metro, and bus stations for passengers. \n ", "7 \nexpertise, which will enhance and supplement the available skills of the executing agency. ADB \nsupport will also ensure that special attention is given to the following important areas: \n \n(i)  High-level technology. ADB will help develop the specifications for a modern \nsignaling technology based on the European Train Control System Level II with \nautomatic train operation functionality and platform screen door integration for the \nfirst time in India. It will also help implement the latest international best practice \nfor mitigating noise and vibration on the corridor. \n(ii)  Station design. ADB will assist in designing stations using building information \nmodeling. This follows an intelligent three-dimensional model-based process that \nwill help to more efficiently plan, design, construct, and manage stations.29 The \nstation designs will incorporate EWCD-inclusive features to provide universal \naccessibility. \n(iii)  Multimodal hubs and last-mile connectivity. The investment project will develop \nmultimodal hubs for smooth interchange with other transport modes. Multimodal \nintegration  will  be  provided  through  elevators,  walkways,  escalators,  and \nunderpasses, depending on the location, to ensure seamless connectivity to metro \nlines, bus terminals, or other transport modes. The project will also ensure last-\nmile connectivity through nonmotorized transport options as well as electric feeder \nbuses. \n(iv)  Transit-oriented development and value capture financing. ADB will support \nthe NCRTC to develop an action plan for TOD in areas around the RRTS stations. \nThe ADB TA will provide for a dedicated unit of experts to provide knowledge \nsupport and to help identify and apply VCF instruments (footnotes 18 and 29). \n(v)  Minimizing operational risks. ADB has engaged a shadow operator to review \nplans and designs to support decision-making, and to ensure efficiency and cost \neffectiveness (footnote 24). Appraisals by the shadow operator will help ensure \nthat the designs integrate long-term O&M requirements. \n \n22.  Replication  strategy.  This  is  the  first  corridor  of  this  nature,  and  the  successful \ndemonstration of the concept will help in the replication and scaling up of the RRTS network not \nonly in the NCR but also in other similar urban agglomerations in India and other countries in Asia \nand the Pacific. This includes the work related to TOD and VCF that is closely associated with \nthis project. To help in the process, a knowledge management system will be designed to ensure \nthat  (i)  specifications  for  the  technology  used  (signaling,  rolling  stock,  civil  structures)  are \nstandardized; (ii) procurement documents that were successfully used for contracts are made \navailable; (iii) all three-dimensional models encapsulating civil, mechanical, and electrical design \nelements are shared with interested agencies; and (iv) all processes related to TOD and VCF are \ndocumented. In addition, knowledge dissemination workshops funded through the ADB TA will \nbe organized for facilitating knowledge sharing and information exchange. \n \n23.  One ADB approach. ADB\u2019s South Asia Department is working with ADB\u2019s Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Thematic Group in the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership to support the NCRTC in \nidentifying the most appropriate PPP opportunities.30 The department is also coordinating with \n \n29 ADB. 2019.

Public\u2013private partnership initiatives. Capital-intensive projects such as the RRTS are \nimplemented as public services, and full cost recovery through user charges is not expected. The \nNCRTC is not operated as a commercial undertaking and is completely dependent on government \nfunding. Hence, it is proposed that a model will be followed whereby the government finances the \nassets using its own funds and development assistance, and then outsources service contracts. \nThis is the practice in most metros and new railway lines worldwide. The project will explore PPP \nin three major areas: (i) development of an operations contract through which the operations of \nthe corridors are expected to be undertaken by a private sector operator engaged by the NCRTC; \n(ii)  provision  of  logistics  services  to  accommodate  freight  traffic,  especially  perishable \ncommodities during the off-peak hours of passenger services (the service is likely to enhance \nsupply chain operations in the catchment area and unlock additional revenue potential for the \nRRTS); and (iii) procurement of a rolling stock contract that will include 15-year performance-\nbased maintenance obligations to improve asset quality and service levels. The payment to the \nrolling stock provider will be based on specified key performance indicators such as availability \nobligations and reliability. At least 30 train sets of six coaches each will be provided for the RRTS \nand 10 train sets of three coaches each for the Meerut Metro. \n \n25.  Use of multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \nachieve the outcome.31 The investment project will be financed by an MFF with four tranches \nadopting  the  time-slice  approach  for  large-scale  stand-alone  projects.  At  the  time  of  MFF \nprocessing, the design, procurement, and safeguards have been appraised for the entire MFF. \nDeveloping sustainable transport systems in Indian cities is a growing challenge and ADB\u2019s long-\nterm  involvement  through  an  MFF  can  provide  the  support  to  develop  infrastructure  and \ninstitutions that can deliver these new types of transformational urban transport projects. In line \nwith the Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s recommendations,32 the MFF (i) is aligned with \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  to  deliver  integrated  solutions  and  to  realize  its  transformational \ndevelopment potential (public sector financing will be effectively used to develop PPP and private \nsector opportunities); (ii) introduces several measures, such as advanced procurement, to ensure \nthat the MFF implementation schedule is realistic and all operations intended to be financed under \nthe MFF program are completed on time; and (iii) will enhance the learning from prior tranches \nby ensuring it is captured, applied, and documented explicitly when the approval of subsequent \ntranches is requested. \n \n26.  Scope of project 1. The investment project will finance civil works, rail track, station \nbuildings, and maintenance facilities. All contracts are expected to be awarded during project 1 \nimplementation.  Tranche  1  will  finance  the  first  slice  of  the  contract  packages  under  the \ninvestment project. It will also support various capacity building activities outlined in Output 2, and \ninitiatives to improve the mobility and economic opportunities of women and differently abled \npeople (Output 3). \n \nC.

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA) acting through the NCRTC will be \nthe  executing  agency  for  the  investment  project.  The  NCRTC  has  established  project \nmanagement offices in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Meerut, and Modinagar led by chief project managers \ndirectly responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the project. A general consultant has \nbeen engaged by the NCRTC using counterpart funds to support the executing agency in \nundertaking overall investment project management. Consultants, financed through TA grants \nfunded by ADB and the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund, will also support the \nNCRTC  (footnote  29).  Capacity-building  training  and  workshops  have  been  organized  to \nfamiliarize the NCRTC staff with ADB policies and procedures. Procurement (including consulting \nservices) to be financed by ADB will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to \ntime). For consultancies financed by ADB, recruitment will be carried out using quality- and cost-\nbased selection with a 90:10 ratio. ADB will review and partially administer procurement packages \n \n34Pursuant to an ADB Board of Directors blanket waiver of member country procurement eligibility restrictions, \n \nuniversal procurement will apply, whereby (i) ADB administers cofinancing resources for ordinary capital resources-\nfinanced resources or (ii) ordinary capital resources and a cofinancier\u2019s resources are used to jointly finance an \nindividual procurement package.

Project readiness and impact of COVID-19. Readiness is high as the complete scope \nto be financed by the MFF has been appraised by ADB. Environmental and social due diligence \nhave been completed for the entire corridor. Geotechnical investigations have been done and \ndetailed design work is in progress. To minimize delays, preconstruction activities such as utility \nshifting for various sections of the corridor are ongoing. The COVID-19 pandemic has not affected \nthe project implementation arrangements or cost estimate. The project implementation period of \n7 years provides adequate cushion for some delays. Based on government orders, guidelines \nand standard operating procedures have been developed and are being strictly implemented for \nresumption  of  regular  works  at  various  NCRTC  site  offices  and  construction  sites.  Strict \ncompliance monitoring is to be ensured by chief project managers. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n34.  The technical viability is sound, with use of proven technology. The technical designs and \nspecifications for most of the civil engineering works are based on Indian standards, which are \nwell proven and widely applied on Indian railways and other metro projects. For underground \nworks, design\u2013build contracts will be awarded to suitably qualified contractors having established \nexperience in construction of similar works and who will be required to engage experienced and \ncompetent designers for the design of works. The design of various works shall meet the relevant \nstandards for the seismic zone of the project area. The executing agency prepared project reports, \ndetailed  designs,  and  specifications.  As  per  the  specifications,  the  track  will  conform  to \ninternational railway standards, with the rolling stock being of modern design, light weight, of \nstainless steel or aluminum construction, and fitted with a regenerative braking system. Modern \nsignaling systems will be used that employ the European Train Control System Level II technology \nto enhance safety and efficiency. Platform screen doors will be installed to separate the station \n \n37 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nplatform from the train to prevent accidents. Climate change risks have been addressed in the \nproject  design  by  (i)  using  head-hardened,  continuous  welded  rail  and  concrete  lining \nunderground tunnels; (ii) raising underground station entrances to above surrounding ground \nlevels; (iii) raising viaduct levels across major rivers to prevent flooding of the tracks during heavy \nfloods; and (iv) installing rain water harvesting systems at various stations and at specified \nintervals along the elevated viaducts (footnote 36). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n35.  Economic  analysis.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines, and compared the project costs and benefits in with-project and \nwithout-project cases with economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as the decision criterion.38 The \nproject is expected to deliver significant benefits to society through savings in vehicle operating \ncosts and travel time for both public transport and road users. The project will also deliver social \nand economic benefits from reduced carbon dioxide emissions and air pollution, which have been \nquantified in the analysis. All the benefits are calculated in market price terms and converted to \neconomic prices using conversion factors as per the Appraisal Guidelines for Metro Rail Project \nProposals by the MOHUA.39 The EIRR for the RRTS is estimated to be 11.3%, with a net present \nvalue of over $977 million. The evaluation included a sensitivity analysis to investigate the \neconomic viability of the project assuming reduction in ridership and employment benefits. The \nEIRR was more than 9% under all scenarios, demonstrating that the investment project would \nremain economically viable given adverse changes in costs and benefits. The RRTS will also \ncontribute significantly to the NCR\u2019s economic growth by structuring land use and transport \npatterns. The project will directly and indirectly benefit the poor and vulnerable, and distribution \nanalysis shows the project will have a poverty impact ratio of 0.27. \n \n36.  Financial  sustainability.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines.40 It assessed the costs and earnings that would accrue because \nof the project using the discounted cash flow method and calculated the financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) over a period of 36 years, comprising 6 years of construction and 30 years of \noperations. All financial calculations are made in 2019 Indian rupees with no adjustment for \ninflation. The base value of the FIRR is 2.5%, which is higher than the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 2.4%. However, the FIRR is highly sensitive to project cost, ridership, and fare revenue \nassumptions. Any adverse change of about 10% in these assumptions will result in a lower FIRR \nthan the weighted average cost of capital. The evaluation assumes traffic at commencement of \noperations as 25% of the forecast, which is increased to forecast estimates in the fifth year after \ncommencement.  The  project  revenues  include  ticket  sales,  advertisements,  and  rentals  at \nstations. Earnings before interest, depreciation, tax, and amortization margin of the project \n(expressed as a percentage of revenue of the project) are about 19% in the first year of operation \nand increase thereafter. This implies that the project is expected to service its O&M obligations \non its own. The debt service coverage ratio is less than 1.0 during the first year of operation, \nrequiring an infusion of an estimated \u20b92.7 billion to meet the debt obligations to ADB, AIIB, and \nthe New Development Bank (interest).41 Any shortfalls in servicing the debt and O&M obligations \nof the project will be borne by the governments of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in the ratio of route\u2013\nkm falling in their respective states, as per the government sanction order and related memoranda \nof understanding (footnote 9). \n \n \n38 ADB. 2017.

The financial management assessment was prepared following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Financial Analysis and Evaluation, Financial Management Assessment, and \nrelated technical guidance notes.42 The NCRTC (i) has sound financial and accounting systems; \n(ii) adheres to procedures, manuals, policies, guidelines, and reporting frameworks prescribed by \nthe Comptroller and Auditor General of India; and (iii) has a robust internal control system with \ninternal audit outsourced to a firm of chartered accountants whose reports are presented to the \naudit committee of the NCRTC. The NCRTC prepares its entity-level financial statements in \ncompliance with the Indian Accounting Standards, with unqualified audit opinions. Measures \nidentified to strengthen financial management include (i) training the NCRTC staff on ADB \nfinancial management requirements, since the NCRTC is implementing an ADB-financed project \nfor the first time; and (ii) preparing and implementing a comprehensive financial management \nmanual.43 The overall financial management assessment risk is moderate, with appropriate risk \nmitigation measures in place. Details of risks and key mitigating measures are in the FAM. \n \n38.  Procurement. The NCRTC is a new agency and is not experienced with procurement and \nconsultant recruitment for ADB projects. Training and awareness workshops have been organized \nto familiarize the NCRTC staff with ADB policies and procedures. For this project, the use of the \nNational Informatics Center\u2019s e-procurement system has been approved to procure all major \npackages. Since July 2018, the NCRTC has been developing a procurement manual that is \naligned with the policies of the Government of India, and outlines detailed processes and \nprocedures to be adopted for all procurement. Advance contracting is being done to expedite \nproject implementation, and the NCRTC has successfully awarded several government-funded \ncontracts. Value for money is being implemented through strategic procurement planning and a \nrisk-managed approach by applying appropriate procurement methods, contract forms, and \nreview procedures. \n \n39.  The NCRTC shall generally adopt the guidelines of the Department of Public Enterprises, \nthe  Department  of  Economic  Affairs,  and  the  Central  Vigilance  Commission  to  strengthen \ncorporate governance and shall be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Integrity due diligence was \nconducted.44 No significant integrity risks were identified. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the NCRTC. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n40.  Poverty. Uttar Pradesh is among the few states in India which has a higher proportion of \nurban poverty (37%) than rural poverty (29%) (footnote 6). As major RRTS nodes in the state, \nGhaziabad, Meerut, and Modinagar are expected to benefit from the investment project through \nreduced travel time to Delhi, increased social mobility, and improved safety. The investment \nproject will contribute to economic growth and employment by enabling better access to income-\ngenerating opportunities and basic services such as health care and education. Reduced travel \ntime will alleviate disparity among urban, peri-urban, and rural areas of India\u2019s NCR. The fares \nwill be kept low (\u20b92 per km) to ensure affordability for even the low-income groups. There will be \na separate class coach with much higher fares to target the upper middle class and rich segments \nof the population, thereby enabling the provision of much lower fares for the poor. \n \n42 ADB. 2019.

The project is classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming. While there is limited data currently available on women\u2019s travel patterns and \nperceptions along the future RRTS corridors, focus group discussions with women reveal that \nthey are often discouraged from using public transport because of fears of harassment, lack of \nlast-mile connectivity, as well as inadequate hygiene facilities. Consultations with organizations \nworking with differently abled people also reveal that, in addition to inaccessible streets and \ntransport vehicles, the behavior of transport service providers is one of the biggest obstacles in \naccessing public transport. The gender equality and social inclusion action plan provides activities  \nintegrated within the project design, including (i) implementing gender-responsive and socially \ninclusive design features across all infrastructure; (ii) incorporating affirmative measures to \nenhance women\u2019s safe mobility, such as reserved coaches in RRTS trains; well-lit and CCTV-\nequipped coaches and public areas of all stations, and pick-up and drop-off areas; and patrolling \nby security guards in public areas; and (iii) pilot-testing modalities for improved mobility of women \nand the differently abled, including (a) improving employability and entrepreneurship opportunities \nfor 1,400 women; (b) providing mobility, visual, and hearing assistive aids to 1,000 differently \nabled people in the urban areas of Ghaziabad, Meerut, and Modinagar; and (c) conducting gender \nequality and social inclusion sensitization trainings with 200 drivers and conductors of feeder \nbuses to the RRTS. \n \n42.  Sexually transmitted infections and human trafficking. Sexually transmitted infections \n(STIs), including HIV, and human trafficking are risks in the project area. The influx of workers in \nthe project area during construction could create additional risks for STIs. The project will mitigate \nthese risks by providing STI awareness and prevention programs to construction workers, in line \nwith good practices adopted by the National AIDS Control Organization, as set out in the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  that  will  form  part  of  the  contractor\u2019s  obligations. \nLivelihood disruptions resulting from land acquisition and relocation may create additional human \ntrafficking risks, which will be addressed by a detailed livelihood restoration and improvement \nprogram set out in the resettlement plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n43.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nof project 1 are as follows.45 \n \n44.  Environment (category A). Most of the alignment will be built along the center of an \nexisting busy highway. Given the large scale of construction works involving the use of heavy \nequipment, health and safety risks are anticipated for the construction workers as well as existing \nroad users and residents living near the alignment. Other anticipated environmental issues \ninclude removal of trees; disturbance from construction-related noise and vibration; generation of \nlarge  quantities  of  waste,  including  excavated  material;  risks  of  health  and  communicable \ndiseases from large numbers of workers; and generation of dust, air, and water pollution. While \nmost risks are expected to be short-term and limited to the construction stage, the key long-term \nrisks are noise and vibration impacts on residents and structures located along the project \nalignment. The NCRTC prepared an environmental impact assessment (EIA) including an EMP \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The draft EIA was disclosed on 9 October \n2019.46 In addition to the EMP, the contractors are also required to follow safety, health, and \nenvironment guidelines for metro projects in India. Mitigation measures for all environmental risks \nidentified  for  the  project  have  been  addressed  through  design  measures  and  inclusion  of \n \n45 ADB.

The NCRTC \nheld consultations with key project stakeholders throughout the EIA preparation and these will be \ncontinued during project implementation. A grievance redress mechanism will be implemented \nunder the project to address complaints and grievances. To comply with the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirement for MFF investments, the NCRTC has prepared an environmental \nassessment and review framework. \n \n45.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project minimizes involuntary resettlement \nimpacts by using elevated tracks on the carriageway of existing roads. Nevertheless, about 138 \nhectares of private land and 32 hectares of government land will be required for 17 stations and \ntwo depots. It is estimated that 813 households (5,453 people) will be affected by physical \ndisplacement (81 households) and economic displacement (732 households) because of land \nacquisition  or  restrictions  on  land  use.  Out  of  the  total  project-affected  households,  571 \nhouseholds  (3,997  people)  will  experience  significant  impacts.  The  NCRTC  has  drafted  a \nresettlement plan and has consulted affected communities on proposed mitigation measures to \naddress involuntary resettlement impacts on titled and nontitled households. The resettlement \nplan has been prepared for the entire Delhi\u2013Meerut corridor based on resettlement surveys, social \nassessments, and consultations. The resettlement plan is in accordance with the Right to Fair \nCompensation  and  Transparency  in  Land  Acquisition,  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Act \n(2013); the direct purchase policies of the Delhi Development Authority (2014) and Uttar Pradesh \n(2015); and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The NCRTC has also prepared a resettlement \nframework to guide the assessment and mitigation of unanticipated involuntary resettlement \nimpacts of the MFF. \n \n46.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project alignment is generally in urban and peri-\nurban areas where scheduled tribes do not have cultural attachment to land, customary territories, \nand distinct livelihood systems. Hence, it will not affect indigenous peoples\u2019 communities within \nthe meaning of the ADB SPS. \n \n47.  The  NCRTC  will  have  a  social  and  environment  management  unit  for  the  overall \nmanagement of social and environmental safeguards under the investment project. An external \nmonitor both for environment and resettlement will be recruited by the NCRTC to conduct third-\nparty monitoring and to verify the reports submitted by the general consultants. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n48.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.47 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measure \nInexperience of  The executing agency is a newly established organization, but many of the NCRTC\u2019s officers \nthe executing  come from the Indian Railways as well as metro corporations across India, including the DMRC, \nagency  and, therefore, individually have sufficient experience in implementing railway and metro \nprojects. The NCRTC has also hired consultants, comprising leading multinational engineering \nfirms, to assist in ensuring high-quality project design and implementation. \nProcurement  All contracts to be financed by ADB will be procured following the ADB Procurement Policy \ndelays  (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas amended from time to time), with major packages subject to prior review by ADB. Many of the \nNCRTC officers involved in procurement activities are familiar with multilateral development bank \n(e.g., JICA) procurement guidelines that are similar to those of ADB. ADB has also conducted \nprocurement workshops for the NCRTC to enhance its understanding of ADB procurement \n \n47 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "16 \nRisks  Mitigation Measure \npolicy, guidelines, and standard bidding documents.

The government has also \nprovided assurances to ensure the financial sustainability of the project. In case of any shortfall \nin revenue and if the NCRTC is not able to service debt and operation and maintenance \nobligations of the project, then sufficient budget and timely releases of funds for operating the \nRRTS will be provided by the participating state governments, in accordance with the presidential \nsanction order. \nCOVID-19  The NCRTC has developed a standard operating procedure based on central government \npandemic  guidelines for resuming work safely after the COVID-19 lockdown.
