The Delhi-Meerut RRTS will pass through the densely populated sections of\nthe NCR, connecting Delhi to Meerut in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The 82-kilometer corridor will provide safe, reliable, and\nhigh-capacity commuter transit services between various locations along the corridor. The investment project will finance rail\ntrack, signaling, station buildings, and maintenance facilities. It will also support capacity and institutional development of the\nNational Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), a joint venture company of the Government of India and states of\nDelhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, that is mandated to implement the RRTS project across the NCR. A grant from\nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will promote improved mobility and economic opportunities for women and\ndifferently-abled groups along the corridor.\nImpact: Urban mobility in the National Capital Region improved\nOutcome: Efficiency, safety, social inclusiveness, and environmental sustainability of transport in the Delhi-Meerut RRTS\ncorridor improved\nOutputs: (i) Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor commissioned, (ii) Institutional capacity of the NCRTC strengthened,  and (iii) Mobility\nand economic opportunities of women and differently abled improved\n\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and National Capital Region Transport Corporation will\nbe the executing agencies.\n\nProject Readiness: Readiness is high as the complete scope to be financed by the MFF has been appraised by ADB.\nEnvironmental and social due diligence have been completed for the entire corridor. Geotechnical investigations have been\ndone and detailed design work is in progress. To minimize delays, preconstruction activities such as utility shifting for various\nsections of the corridor are ongoing. The COVID-19 pandemic has not affected the project implementation arrangements or cost\nestimate. The project implementation period of 7 years provides adequate cushion for some delays. Based on government\norders, guidelines and standard operating procedures have been developed and are being strictly implemented for resumption\nof regular works at various NCRTC site offices and construction sites. Strict compliance monitoring is to be ensured by chief\nproject managers.\n\n9. Milestones\nModality\nMultitranche financing facility\nTranche I\nTranche II\nTranche III\nTranche IV\n\n10.

The investment project will finance the first of three prioritized rail corridors of \nthe  planned  regional  rapid  transit  system  (RRTS)  network  in  India\u2019s  National  Capital  Region \n(NCR). The Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS will pass through the densely populated sections of the NCR, \nconnecting Delhi to Meerut in the state of Uttar Pradesh. It will provide safe, reliable, and high-\ncapacity commuter transit services along the corridor. The investment project is included in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for India.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE \n\n \n2. \nDevelopment  problem.  The  NCR,  covering  an  area  of  over  58,000  square  kilometers \n(km), is a coordinated planning region encompassing Delhi and several districts surrounding it \nfrom the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The NCR and the associated NCR \nPlanning  Board  were  created  in  1985  to  plan  the  development  of  the  region  and  to  evolve \nharmonized policies for the control of land use and infrastructure development. Prominent cities \nof the NCR include Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Meerut. Contributing nearly 8% \nof India\u2019s gross domestic product, the NCR\u2019s importance has grown with the country\u2019s economic \ngrowth. The NCR is the fastest-growing urban agglomeration in India, registering an average of \n33%  decadal  population  growth  since  1980.  From  46  million  in  2011,  the  NCR\u2019s  population  is \nincreasing rapidly and is projected to reach 64 million by 2021, with an urbanization rate of 71% \n(45 million).2 \n \n3. \nThe  city  of  Delhi\u2014accounting  for  37%  of  the  total  NCR  population  while  only  covering \n4.4% of the NCR area\u2014has been facing unprecedented growth as it acts as a powerful national \njob magnet, particularly for neighboring states. The large influx of migrants has led to extreme \ntraffic congestion, lack of space for development of essential basic infrastructure like water supply \nand sewerage, and lack of affordable housing. Congestion is estimated to cost $9.6 billion (about \n12% of Delhi\u2019s gross domestic product) annually in wasted fuel, reduced productivity, air pollution, \nand accidents.3 In 2017, 6,673 traffic accidents were recorded in Delhi\u20141,565 of which resulted \nin fatalities, the highest among cities in India with 1 million people or more. The growing traffic \nlevels  have  also  contributed  to  worsening  air  pollution  levels,  making  Delhi  one  of  the  most \npolluted cities in the world.4 \n \nThe unicentric development focus on Delhi, with a few satellite cities near Delhi emerging \n4. \nas business hubs, has prevented the NCR from realizing its true economic potential as it leaves \nother subregions to struggle.5 Eight districts in the NCR, covering nearly 15,000 square km, are \npart of Uttar Pradesh, which is one of the poorest states in the country with per capita incomes \nless than half the national average. In 2018, Uttar Pradesh registered the highest unemployment \nrate in urban areas, at nearly 16%. Women and differently abled people are often less well-placed \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2019.

The incidence of unemployment among \nfemale  graduates  in  the  state  (14.7%)  is  double  the  national  average  (7.3%),  and  65%  of  the \nstate\u2019s  differently  abled  population  do  not  have  work.6 Special  attention  needs  to  be  given  to \nimproving the safety and mobility of women and differently abled travelers to ensure that benefits \nof wider job opportunities and more controlled development of Delhi are shared across different \ngroups of the population. \n \n5. \nCoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic.  Plans  for  transport  arteries  to  enhance \nregional connectivity have become critical for the inclusive and sustainable development of the \nNCR. This is further highlighted with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed Delhi\u2019s long-\nstanding  migration  problem.  As  the  country  went  into  lockdown,  millions  of  migrant  workers  in \nDelhi and its satellite towns were left stranded without immediate jobs and incomes, in very basic \nconditions away from their families. Good regional connectivity will allow workers to live with their \nfamilies under better living conditions in other NCR towns, where the cost of living is lower and \nquality of life is better. Fast and comfortable commuting will bring about a paradigm shift in the \nway people travel and work in the NCR. The development of Delhi will be more controlled and \nregulated, relieving pressure on Delhi and leading to polycentric urban development in the NCR. \n \n6. \nThe NCR Regional Plan 2021 recommends integrating regional centers with each other \nand  the  capital  through  an  integrated  transport  network  to  induce  growth  and  development  of \nsettlements in the  NCR.7 Regional connectivity enhancement, through mass transport systems \nwhich  are  well-integrated  with  land  use  patterns,  will  facilitate  the  outward  pull  of  people  from \nDelhi. The Functional Plan on Transport, 2032 was then developed to detail the specific policies \nof the regional plan related to the transport sector.8 \n \n7. \nRoad  map.  The  Functional  Plan  on  Transport  recommended  an  integrated  multimodal \ntransport  system  to  improve  the  mobility  of  both  people  and  goods  in  the  NCR.  The  plan \nspecifically includes a proposal for the construction of eight rail corridors to connect Delhi to other \ncities  in  the  NCR  with  high-speed  commuter  trains  under  the  RRTS.  The  government  has \nprioritized three rail  corridors for  implementation.  The first corridor  will  be  the  northeast  Delhi\u2013\nMeerut corridor (82 km) connecting Delhi to Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Duhai, and Meerut in Uttar \nPradesh, one  of  the  most  densely  populated  sections  in  the  NCR.9 While  the  national  railway \nsystem connects these towns to central Delhi, most of the existing track capacity is dedicated to \nlong-distance express trains unable to serve commuters between Delhi and Meerut.10 The second \ncorridor (180 km) will be the Delhi\u2013Gurugram\u2013Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror\u2013Alwar corridor, \npassing through urbanized and industrialized areas of Haryana and Rajasthan, and connecting \nto Delhi airport.11 The third corridor (103 km) will connect Delhi to Panipat in the state of Haryana. \nAll three corridors will converge at the multimodal hub to be constructed at Sarai Kale Khan in \nDelhi. The three prioritized corridors will be integrated with the airport, eight Delhi Metro stations, \n\n \n\n6  R. Mamgain and S. Verick. 2017.

The scheduled travel \ntime  from  Delhi to  Meerut  by rail  is,  on  average,  2  hours  but  the actual  time may  be 3\u20134  hours  since  the line  is \nextremely congested and operating at more than 170% of design capacity. \n\n11 The Japan International Cooperation Agency, which has financed the Delhi Metro and other metro projects in India, \n\nis expected to finance this corridor. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fthree interstate bus terminals, and two Indian Railways stations in the capital, apart from several \nother towns in the NCR. \n \n8. \nImplementation of the RRTS gained impetus with the establishment of the National Capital \nRegion Transport Corporation (NCRTC), a joint venture company with equity investment of the \nGovernment of India (50%) and the states of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh (each \n12.5%). The NCRTC is mandated to implement the RRTS project across the four participating \nstates.12 The  operations  of  these  corridors  are  expected  to  be  undertaken  by  a  private  sector \noperator  engaged  by  the  NCRTC.  The  NCRTC  board  of  directors  is  fully  authorized  to  make \ntechnical decisions and the corporation depends on the government principally for funding and \nland  acquisition.  This  arrangement  has  proven  to  be  very  effective  in  reducing  political \ninterference in other infrastructure projects in India. Apart from the construction and operation of \nthese  corridors,  the  NCRTC  will  also  assist  state  governments  to  implement  transit-oriented \ndevelopment  (TOD)  and  value  capture  financing  (VCF)  schemes  that  will  provide  additional \nrevenue streams to enhance the financial sustainability of such projects. Since the NCRTC is a \nrelatively  new  organization  tasked  with  implementing  these  innovative  and  transformational \nrailway corridors, it will need considerable support for institutional and capacity building. \n \n9. \nPolicy framework. The development of rail-based mass transit systems is governed by \nthree main policies. The National Urban Transport Policy (2006) of the government encourages \nthe development of high-capacity public transport systems through special purpose vehicles and \noffers financial support either in the form of equity or one-time viability gap financing.13 \n \n10. \nThe  National  Transit Oriented  Development  Policy  (2017)  supports  the development  of \ndense, mixed-use developments around strategically located transit nodes, preferably within a 5\u2013\n10-minute walking distance. TOD focuses on creating development patterns that facilitate the use \nof public transit as a primary mode of transport.14 The proposed RRTS corridor will expand and \nintegrate  new  areas  and  trigger  spatial  and  economic  development.  This  will  help  achieve \nsustainable  development  in  the  NCR  through  integration  of  land  use  and  transportation.  Real \nestate development activity will increase as newer areas are developed and real estate valuations \nand  transactions  increase.  The  preparation  work  for  the  investment  project  has  identified \n\u201cinfluence zones\u201d of all the RRTS stations together with four \u201cspecial development areas.\u201d15 These \nare proposed to be earmarked as TOD zones in accordance with the TOD Policy, which envisages \nincreased  land  use  density  along  the  influence  area  of  the  corridor  and  at  all  selected  transit \nstations. \n \nThe  Metro  Rail  Policy  (2017)  emphasizes  the  benefits  of  mass  rapid  transit  systems, \n11. \nparticularly in urban areas, and the state governments\u2019 commitment to provide required support \nto  metro  rail  companies  and  agencies  to  ensure  financial  sustainability  during  operations.  The \npolicy also mandates state governments to implement VCF. This is a mechanism for additional \nrevenue generation through the recovery of some or all of the additional value that is generated \nby public infrastructure.16 While the concept is still at a nascent stage in India, some of the mass \ntransit  projects  in  different  Indian  states  have  successfully  utilized  at  least  one  or  two  VCF \n\n \n\n12 The NCRTC was incorporated on 1 August 2013. \n13 Government of India, MOHUA. 2006.

Strengthening  urban  mass  transit  systems  and  increasing  the \n12. \nenvironmental sustainability of cities through the development of railways is well-recognized in \nIndia\u2019s transport and regional plans and in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for India.19 \nThe  investment  project  is  aligned  with  all  three pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  CPS  on  (i)  boosting  economic \ncompetitiveness  by  expanding  infrastructure  networks  and  corridor  development,  (ii)  providing \ninclusive  access  to  these  infrastructure  networks,  and  (iii)  addressing  climate  change.  The \ninvestment project fits well with the emphasis of ADB\u2019s CPS on transformative investments of a \nnational flagship nature to deliver total solutions to the country\u2019s burgeoning problems such as \nunorganized urbanization by adopting a cross-sector approach. ADB will support long-term urban \ndevelopment planning, which will ensure seamless travel between Delhi and other NCR cities and \nimprove links across the NCR. \n \nPost-COVID-19.  The  investment  project  remains  highly  relevant  in  a  post-COVID-19 \n13. \nstrategic  context.  Efforts  are  being  made  to  restart  the  economy  and  to  mitigate  the  adverse \nimpact  of  the  lockdown,  particularly  on  employment  of  the  vulnerable  population.  Investing  in \npublic  transit  infrastructure  will  create  employment  opportunities  during  construction  and \noperation and also generate demand and kickstart the economy through the growth of businesses, \nimproved  quality  of  living,  and  equitable  access  to  infrastructure.  India\u2019s  economic  survey \nestimates that an investment of \u20b91 in railways has a multiplier effect of \u20b95 in other sectors of the \neconomy. The RRTS has the ability to create demand in various allied sectors of the economy \nand to provide employment opportunities in the form of direct, indirect, and induced jobs. \n \n14. \nand explicitly focuses on key operational priorities (Table 1).20 \n \n\nAlignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \n\nKey Operational Priorities \nAddressing remaining \npoverty and reducing \ninequalities \n\nTackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and \ndisaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental \nsustainability \n\nMaking cities more livable \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nProject Contributions \nImproving standards of living. The project will provide universal access to safe, \nreliable  urban  transport  services  that  promote  social  inclusion  and  development \nparticularly for vulnerable groups by facilitating mobility and improving accessibility \nto centers of job opportunities. \nReducing GHG emissions. The project will support climate change mitigation by \nencouraging commuters to shift from road-based public urban transport to the RRTS \nas a sustainable transport mode with lower GHG emissions. \nEnsuring climate and disaster resilience. The facility supports the implementation \nof  climate-  and  disaster-resilient  infrastructure,  with  designs  addressing  flooding \nrisks during high rainfall periods. \nProviding  integrated  solutions.  Through  improved  regional  connectivity,  the \nfacility will ease population pressure on Delhi and provide the necessary incentive \nfor other towns to develop sustainably. By supporting transit-oriented development, \nthe project will facilitate well-organized development of urban areas with systematic \nland  use  planning  and  incentives  to  promote  vertical  and  dense  development  of \nurban buildings, leading to an efficient and clean urban environment. \n\n \n\n17 The most commonly applied value capture instruments are additional stamp duty charges and increased floor area \n\n18 Transit-Oriented  Development  and  Value  Capture  Financing  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n19 ADB.  2017.

The importance of intracity urban transit has been recognized worldwide, and \nlessons can be learned from extended urban agglomerations in Hong Kong, China; the Republic \nof  Korea;  Taipei,China;  and  Thailand,  where  train  systems  serve  as  the  main  transport \nbackbone.21 ADB\u2019s initial involvement in the urban transport subsector in India was to assist in \npolicy  and  strategy  aspects  in  line  with  the  National  Urban  Transport  Policy.  ADB  has  also \nsupported the development of the Guidelines and Toolkits for Urban Transport Development in \nMedium-Sized Cities in India; the Jaipur Metro Rail Line 1-Phase B Project, where it financed the \nextension of the first metro train line in Jaipur and drew up plans to build a second line for the \nnorth\u2013south corridor; and the Mumbai Metro Rail Systems Project to expand the metro network \nin India\u2019s financial capital.22 \n \n16.  Metro and railway projects financed by ADB in India have shown that the following are \nvital to delivering high-quality projects in a timely manner: (i) conducting advance planning and \ndetailed project preparation; (ii) ensuring that executing agencies have strong capacity for project \npreparation,  procurement,  and  implementation;  (iii)  ensuring  multimodal  integration;  and  (iv) \nconsidering  operation  and maintenance (O&M) requirements  at  an  early stage.  These  lessons \nhave been carefully incorporated. Additional training has been conducted to strengthen capacity \nin  project  preparation  and  procurement. Multimodal  integration  plans  have  been  reviewed  and \nnecessary  elements  to  ensure  intermodal  interchanges  have  been  incorporated  in  the  station \ndesigns.23 Through ADB technical assistance (TA), a \u201cshadow operator\u201d has been appointed at \nan early stage to review operational plans and provide recommendations.24 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n17. \nThe  investment  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  urban  mobility  in  the  NCR \nimproved (footnote 13). With a design speed of 180 km per hour and high-frequency operations \nof every 5\u201310 minutes, this 82-km corridor is expected to reduce the journey time from 3\u20134 hours \n\n2). \n\n \n\n21 International Experience from Regional Transit Systems (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n22 ADB. 2006.

It will provide operational \nexpertise during the design and construction phases of the project. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nOutput  2: \n\nto about 1 hour. The investment project will have the following outcome: efficiency, safety, social \ninclusiveness, and environmental sustainability of transport in the Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS corridor \nimproved.25 \n \nB. \n \n18. \nOutput 1: Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS corridor commissioned. The investment project will help \nfinance the construction of the 82 km Delhi\u2013Meerut RRTS corridor, including civil works, railway \ntracks, station buildings, multimodal hubs, maintenance depots, and traction and power supply.26 \nThe  corridor  will  be  built  on  elevated  viaducts  and  will  go  underground  (14  km)  in  heavily \npopulated areas. It will connect Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to Modipuram in Meerut.27 The viaduct \nwill be built along the central median of the national highway connecting Delhi to Meerut, wherever \nfeasible. The investment project also includes (i) construction of depots at Duhai and Modipuram \nfor the maintenance of rolling stock and fixed assets, and an operation control center and stabling \nyard at Jangpura; (ii) 24 stations integrating design features that are friendly to the elderly, women, \nchildren,  and  differently  abled  (EWCD),  at  least  five  of  which  are  to  be  developed  as  major \nmultimodal hubs; 28 and (iii) closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed to monitor coaches \nand public areas of all stations, and pick-up and drop-off areas. \n \n19. \nInstitutional  capacity  of  the  National  Capital  Region  Transport \nCorporation strengthened. Although the NCRTC\u2019s scope as a special purpose vehicle is limited \nto implementing the RRTS, the large-scale nature of the investment project requires a high level \nof capacity in managing projects, contracts, and document flow, including financial reporting and \nauditing. The project will (i) develop an institutional strategy including an organizational, financial, \nand technology plan; (ii) develop training programs in project and contract management, financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  safeguards;  (iii)  adopt  a  gender-friendly  workplace  policy;  (iv) \nsupport the NCRTC in developing a TOD action plan and VCF instruments for enhancing financial \nsustainability;  and  (v)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  NCRTC  to  undertake  public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) initiatives. \n \n20. \nOutput 3: Mobility and economic opportunities of women and the differently abled \nimproved.  The  investment  project  will  ensure  that  the  RRTS  improves  urban  mobility,  and  its \neconomic impacts will benefit women and the differently abled. The project will include (i) training; \n(ii)  provision  of  mobility  aids;  (iii)  safe  mobility  for  EWCD;  (iv)  increased  awareness  on  safe \nmobility, self-defense, and improved employability skills for selected female students along the \nRRTS  corridor;  and  (v)  provision  of  gender-inclusive,  socially  inclusive,  and  environmentally \nsustainable  public  toilets  around  RRTS  stations.  The  project  will  also  maximize  the  spillover \neffects of developing the RRTS and multimodal hubs, encouraging more women and differently \nabled people to engage in employment and other economic activities. \n \nFinance-plus and value added by ADB assistance. The investment project provides a \n21. \nnew type of rail-based regional urban transport system in India, combining high speeds, widely \nspaced stations, and metro-like operations. ADB will assist the NCRTC in developing the first of \nthree prioritized corridors, which will have a substantial demonstration effect for future corridor \ndevelopment.  ADB  assistance  will  help  develop  innovative  elements  that  require  international \n\n \n\n25 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n26 ADB financing will not include rolling stock or the signaling and telecommunications system. \n27 About 20 km of the RRTS line from Partapur to Modipuram will be used to run the proposed Meerut Metro, originally \n\nplanned as a parallel line to the RRTS. This section will have six stations dedicated for Meerut Metro. \n\n28 Two  stations  are  at-grade  catering  to  depots.  Major  multimodal  hubs  are  RRTS  stations  that  will  include  easy \n\ninterchange to rail, metro, and bus stations for passengers. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fexpertise, which will enhance and supplement the available skills of the executing agency. ADB \nsupport will also ensure that special attention is given to the following important areas: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nHigh-level  technology.  ADB  will  help  develop  the  specifications  for  a  modern \nsignaling  technology  based  on  the  European  Train  Control  System  Level II  with \nautomatic train operation functionality and platform screen door integration for the \nfirst time in India. It will also help implement the latest international best practice \nfor mitigating noise and vibration on the corridor. \nStation  design.  ADB  will  assist  in  designing  stations  using  building  information \nmodeling. This follows an intelligent three-dimensional model-based process that \nwill  help  to  more  efficiently  plan,  design,  construct,  and  manage  stations.29 The \nstation  designs  will  incorporate  EWCD-inclusive  features  to  provide  universal \naccessibility. \n\n(iii)  Multimodal hubs and last-mile connectivity. The investment project will develop \nmultimodal hubs for smooth interchange with other transport modes. Multimodal \nintegration  will  be  provided  through  elevators,  walkways,  escalators,  and \nunderpasses, depending on the location, to ensure seamless connectivity to metro \nlines, bus terminals, or other transport modes. The project will also ensure last-\nmile connectivity through nonmotorized transport options as well as electric feeder \nbuses. \nTransit-oriented development and value capture financing. ADB will support \nthe NCRTC to develop an action plan for TOD in areas around the RRTS stations. \nThe  ADB  TA  will  provide  for  a  dedicated  unit  of  experts  to  provide  knowledge \nsupport and to help identify and apply VCF instruments (footnotes 18 and 29). \nMinimizing  operational  risks.  ADB  has  engaged  a  shadow  operator  to  review \nplans and designs to support decision-making, and to ensure efficiency and cost \neffectiveness  (footnote  24).  Appraisals  by  the  shadow  operator  will  help  ensure \nthat the designs integrate long-term O&M requirements. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n22. \nReplication  strategy.  This  is  the  first  corridor  of  this  nature,  and  the  successful \ndemonstration of the concept will help in the replication and scaling up of the RRTS network not \nonly in the NCR but also in other similar urban agglomerations in India and other countries in Asia \nand the Pacific. This includes the work related to TOD and VCF that is closely associated with \nthis project. To help in the process, a knowledge management system will be designed to ensure \nthat  (i)  specifications  for  the  technology  used  (signaling,  rolling  stock,  civil  structures)  are \nstandardized;  (ii)  procurement  documents  that  were  successfully  used  for  contracts  are  made \navailable; (iii) all three-dimensional models encapsulating civil, mechanical, and electrical design \nelements are shared with interested agencies; and (iv) all processes related to TOD and VCF are \ndocumented. In addition, knowledge dissemination workshops funded through the ADB TA will \nbe organized for facilitating knowledge sharing and information exchange. \n \n23. \nOne ADB approach. ADB\u2019s South Asia Department is working with ADB\u2019s Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Thematic Group in the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership to support the NCRTC in \nidentifying  the  most  appropriate  PPP  opportunities.30 The  department  is  also  coordinating  with \n\n \n\n29 ADB. 2019.

Building  information  modeling,  universal  access  design  features,  TOD,  and  VCF  instruments  are  being \nsupported by the cluster TA funded by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the ADB-administered \nUrban Financing Partnership Facility. Financing partners are the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of \nSwitzerland and the United Kingdom. \n\n30 Public\u2013Private Partnership Initiatives (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department to engage with the NCRTC in exploring additional \nnonsovereign lending, coinciding with the timing for the third tranche of the investment project. \n \n24. \nPublic\u2013private partnership initiatives. Capital-intensive projects such as the RRTS are \nimplemented as public services, and full cost recovery through user charges is not expected. The \nNCRTC is not operated as a commercial undertaking and is completely dependent on government \nfunding. Hence, it is proposed that a model will be followed whereby the government finances the \nassets using its own funds and development assistance, and then outsources service contracts. \nThis is the practice in most metros and new railway lines worldwide. The project will explore PPP \nin three major areas: (i) development of an operations contract through which the operations of \nthe corridors are expected to be undertaken by a private sector operator engaged by the NCRTC; \n(ii)  provision  of  logistics  services  to  accommodate  freight  traffic,  especially  perishable \ncommodities  during  the  off-peak  hours  of  passenger  services  (the  service  is  likely  to  enhance \nsupply  chain  operations  in  the  catchment  area  and  unlock  additional  revenue  potential  for  the \nRRTS);  and  (iii)  procurement  of  a  rolling  stock  contract  that  will  include  15-year  performance-\nbased maintenance obligations to improve asset quality and service levels. The payment to the \nrolling stock provider will be based on specified key performance indicators such as availability \nobligations and reliability. At least 30 train sets of six coaches each will be provided for the RRTS \nand 10 train sets of three coaches each for the Meerut Metro. \n \nUse of multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \n25. \nachieve  the  outcome.31 The  investment  project  will  be  financed  by  an  MFF  with  four  tranches \nadopting  the  time-slice  approach  for  large-scale  stand-alone  projects.  At  the  time  of  MFF \nprocessing, the design, procurement, and safeguards have been appraised for the entire MFF. \nDeveloping sustainable transport systems in Indian cities is a growing challenge and ADB\u2019s long-\nterm  involvement  through  an  MFF  can  provide  the  support  to  develop  infrastructure  and \ninstitutions that can deliver these new types of transformational urban transport projects. In line \nwith  the  Independent  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  recommendations,32 the  MFF  (i)  is  aligned  with \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  to  deliver  integrated  solutions  and  to  realize  its  transformational \ndevelopment potential (public sector financing will be effectively used to develop PPP and private \nsector opportunities); (ii) introduces several measures, such as advanced procurement, to ensure \nthat the MFF implementation schedule is realistic and all operations intended to be financed under \nthe MFF program are completed on time; and (iii) will enhance the learning from prior tranches \nby ensuring it is captured, applied, and documented explicitly when the approval of subsequent \ntranches is requested. \n \nScope  of  project  1.  The  investment  project  will  finance  civil  works,  rail  track,  station \n26. \nbuildings, and maintenance facilities. All contracts are expected to be awarded during project 1 \nimplementation.  Tranche  1  will  finance  the  first  slice  of  the  contract  packages  under  the \ninvestment project. It will also support various capacity building activities outlined in Output 2, and \ninitiatives  to  improve  the  mobility  and  economic  opportunities  of  women  and  differently  abled \npeople (Output 3). \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  $3,949.7  million.

Readiness is high as the complete scope \nto be financed by the MFF has been appraised by ADB. Environmental and social due diligence \nhave  been  completed  for  the  entire  corridor.  Geotechnical  investigations  have  been  done  and \ndetailed design work is in progress. To minimize delays, preconstruction activities such as utility \nshifting for various sections of the corridor are ongoing. The COVID-19 pandemic has not affected \nthe project implementation arrangements or cost estimate. The project implementation period of \n7  years  provides  adequate  cushion for  some  delays.  Based  on  government  orders,  guidelines \nand standard operating procedures have been developed and are being strictly implemented for \nresumption  of  regular  works  at  various  NCRTC  site  offices  and  construction  sites.  Strict \ncompliance monitoring is to be ensured by chief project managers. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n34. \nThe technical viability is sound, with use of proven technology. The technical designs and \nspecifications for most of the civil engineering works are based on Indian standards, which are \nwell  proven  and  widely  applied  on  Indian  railways  and  other  metro  projects.  For  underground \nworks, design\u2013build contracts will be awarded to suitably qualified contractors having established \nexperience in construction of similar works and who will be required to engage experienced and \ncompetent designers for the design of works. The design of various works shall meet the relevant \nstandards for the seismic zone of the project area. The executing agency prepared project reports, \ndetailed  designs,  and  specifications.  As  per  the  specifications,  the  track  will  conform  to \ninternational  railway  standards,  with  the  rolling  stock  being  of  modern  design,  light  weight,  of \nstainless steel or aluminum construction, and fitted with a regenerative braking system. Modern \nsignaling systems will be used that employ the European Train Control System Level II technology \nto enhance safety and efficiency. Platform screen doors will be installed to separate the station \n\n37 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nplatform from the train to prevent accidents. Climate change risks have been addressed in the \nproject  design  by  (i)  using  head-hardened,  continuous  welded  rail  and  concrete  lining \nunderground  tunnels;  (ii)  raising  underground  station  entrances  to  above  surrounding  ground \nlevels; (iii) raising viaduct levels across major rivers to prevent flooding of the tracks during heavy \nfloods;  and  (iv)  installing  rain  water  harvesting  systems  at  various  stations  and  at  specified \nintervals along the elevated viaducts (footnote 36). \n \nB. \n \n35. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines, and compared the project costs and benefits in with-project and \nwithout-project cases with economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as the decision criterion.38 The \nproject is expected to deliver significant benefits to society through savings in vehicle operating \ncosts and travel time for both public transport and road users. The project will also deliver social \nand economic benefits from reduced carbon dioxide emissions and air pollution, which have been \nquantified in the analysis. All the benefits are calculated in market price terms and converted to \neconomic prices using conversion factors as per the Appraisal Guidelines for Metro Rail Project \nProposals by the MOHUA.39 The EIRR for the RRTS is estimated to be 11.3%, with a net present \nvalue  of  over  $977  million.  The  evaluation  included  a  sensitivity  analysis  to  investigate  the \neconomic viability of the project assuming reduction in ridership and employment benefits. The \nEIRR was more than 9% under all scenarios, demonstrating that the investment project would \nremain  economically  viable  given  adverse  changes  in  costs  and  benefits.  The  RRTS  will  also \ncontribute  significantly  to  the  NCR\u2019s  economic  growth  by  structuring  land  use  and  transport \npatterns. The project will directly and indirectly benefit the poor and vulnerable, and distribution \nanalysis shows the project will have a poverty impact ratio of 0.27. \n \n36. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines.40 It assessed the costs and earnings that would accrue because \nof the project using the discounted cash flow method and calculated the financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR)  over  a  period  of  36  years,  comprising  6  years  of  construction  and  30  years  of \noperations.  All  financial  calculations  are  made  in  2019  Indian  rupees  with  no  adjustment  for \ninflation. The base value of the FIRR is 2.5%, which is higher than the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 2.4%. However, the FIRR is highly sensitive to project cost, ridership, and fare revenue \nassumptions. Any adverse change of about 10% in these assumptions will result in a lower FIRR \nthan the weighted average cost of capital. The evaluation assumes traffic at commencement of \noperations as 25% of the forecast, which is increased to forecast estimates in the fifth year after \ncommencement.  The  project  revenues  include  ticket  sales,  advertisements,  and  rentals  at \nstations.  Earnings  before  interest,  depreciation,  tax,  and  amortization  margin  of  the  project \n(expressed as a percentage of revenue of the project) are about 19% in the first year of operation \nand increase thereafter. This implies that the project is expected to service its O&M obligations \non  its  own.  The  debt  service  coverage  ratio  is  less  than  1.0  during  the  first  year  of  operation, \nrequiring an infusion of an estimated \u20b92.7 billion to meet the debt obligations to ADB, AIIB, and \nthe New Development Bank (interest).41 Any shortfalls in servicing the debt and O&M obligations \nof the project will be borne by the governments of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in the ratio of route\u2013\nkm falling in their respective states, as per the government sanction order and related memoranda \nof understanding (footnote 9). \n \n\n \n38 ADB. 2017.

The financial management assessment was prepared following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Financial Analysis and Evaluation, Financial Management Assessment, and \nrelated technical guidance notes.42 The NCRTC (i) has sound financial and accounting systems; \n(ii) adheres to procedures, manuals, policies, guidelines, and reporting frameworks prescribed by \nthe Comptroller and Auditor General of India; and (iii) has a robust internal control system with \ninternal audit outsourced to a firm of chartered accountants whose reports are presented to the \naudit  committee  of  the  NCRTC.  The  NCRTC  prepares  its  entity-level  financial  statements  in \ncompliance  with  the  Indian  Accounting  Standards,  with  unqualified  audit  opinions.  Measures \nidentified  to  strengthen  financial  management  include  (i)  training  the  NCRTC  staff  on  ADB \nfinancial management requirements, since the NCRTC is implementing an ADB-financed project \nfor  the  first  time;  and  (ii)  preparing  and  implementing  a  comprehensive  financial  management \nmanual.43 The overall financial management assessment risk is moderate, with appropriate risk \nmitigation measures in place. Details of risks and key mitigating measures are in the FAM. \n \nProcurement. The NCRTC is a new agency and is not experienced with procurement and \n38. \nconsultant recruitment for ADB projects. Training and awareness workshops have been organized \nto familiarize the NCRTC staff with ADB policies and procedures. For this project, the use of the \nNational  Informatics  Center\u2019s  e-procurement  system  has  been  approved  to  procure  all  major \npackages.  Since  July  2018,  the  NCRTC  has  been  developing  a  procurement  manual  that  is \naligned  with  the  policies  of  the  Government  of  India,  and  outlines  detailed  processes  and \nprocedures  to  be  adopted  for  all  procurement.  Advance  contracting  is  being  done  to  expedite \nproject implementation, and the NCRTC has successfully awarded several government-funded \ncontracts. Value for money is being implemented through strategic procurement planning and a \nrisk-managed  approach  by  applying  appropriate  procurement  methods,  contract  forms,  and \nreview procedures. \n \nThe NCRTC shall generally adopt the guidelines of the Department of Public Enterprises, \n39. \nthe  Department  of  Economic  Affairs,  and  the  Central  Vigilance  Commission  to  strengthen \ncorporate governance and shall be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Integrity due diligence was \nconducted.44 No significant integrity risks were identified. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with the  government and  the  NCRTC.  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM. \n \nD. \n \nPoverty. Uttar Pradesh is among the few states in India which has a higher proportion of \n40. \nurban poverty (37%) than rural poverty (29%) (footnote 6). As major RRTS nodes in the state, \nGhaziabad, Meerut, and Modinagar are expected to benefit from the investment project through \nreduced  travel  time  to  Delhi,  increased  social  mobility,  and  improved  safety.  The  investment \nproject will contribute to economic growth and employment by enabling better access to income-\ngenerating opportunities and basic services such as health care and education. Reduced travel \ntime will alleviate disparity among urban, peri-urban, and rural areas of India\u2019s NCR. The fares \nwill be kept low (\u20b92 per km) to ensure affordability for even the low-income groups. There will be \na separate class coach with much higher fares to target the upper middle class and rich segments \nof the population, thereby enabling the provision of much lower fares for the poor. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n42 ADB. 2019.

While  there  is  limited  data  currently  available  on  women\u2019s  travel  patterns  and \nperceptions  along  the  future  RRTS  corridors,  focus  group  discussions  with  women  reveal  that \nthey are often discouraged from using public transport because of fears of harassment, lack of \nlast-mile connectivity, as well as inadequate hygiene facilities. Consultations with organizations \nworking  with  differently  abled  people  also  reveal  that,  in  addition  to  inaccessible  streets  and \ntransport vehicles, the behavior of transport service providers is one of the biggest obstacles in \naccessing public transport. The gender equality and social inclusion action plan provides activities  \nintegrated  within  the  project  design,  including  (i)  implementing  gender-responsive  and  socially \ninclusive  design  features  across  all  infrastructure;  (ii)  incorporating  affirmative  measures  to \nenhance women\u2019s safe mobility, such as reserved coaches in RRTS trains; well-lit and CCTV-\nequipped coaches and public areas of all stations, and pick-up and drop-off areas; and patrolling \nby security guards in public areas; and (iii) pilot-testing modalities for improved mobility of women \nand the differently abled, including (a) improving employability and entrepreneurship opportunities \nfor  1,400  women;  (b)  providing  mobility,  visual,  and  hearing  assistive  aids  to  1,000  differently \nabled people in the urban areas of Ghaziabad, Meerut, and Modinagar; and (c) conducting gender \nequality  and  social  inclusion  sensitization  trainings  with  200  drivers  and  conductors  of  feeder \nbuses to the RRTS. \n \n42. \nSexually transmitted infections and human trafficking. Sexually transmitted infections \n(STIs), including HIV, and human trafficking are risks in the project area. The influx of workers in \nthe project area during construction could create additional risks for STIs. The project will mitigate \nthese risks by providing STI awareness and prevention programs to construction workers, in line \nwith  good  practices  adopted  by  the  National  AIDS  Control  Organization,  as  set  out  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  that  will  form  part  of  the  contractor\u2019s  obligations. \nLivelihood disruptions resulting from land acquisition and relocation may create additional human \ntrafficking  risks,  which  will  be  addressed  by  a  detailed  livelihood  restoration  and  improvement \nprogram set out in the resettlement plan. \n \nE. \n \n43. \nof project 1 are as follows.45 \n \n44. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  Most  of  the  alignment  will  be  built  along  the  center  of  an \nexisting  busy  highway. Given  the  large  scale  of  construction  works  involving  the  use  of  heavy \nequipment, health and safety risks are anticipated for the construction workers as well as existing \nroad  users  and  residents  living  near  the  alignment.  Other  anticipated  environmental  issues \ninclude removal of trees; disturbance from construction-related noise and vibration; generation of \nlarge  quantities  of  waste,  including  excavated  material;  risks  of  health  and  communicable \ndiseases from large numbers of workers; and generation of dust, air, and water pollution. While \nmost risks are expected to be short-term and limited to the construction stage, the key long-term \nrisks  are  noise  and  vibration  impacts  on  residents  and  structures  located  along  the  project \nalignment. The NCRTC prepared an environmental impact assessment (EIA) including an EMP \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The draft EIA was disclosed on 9 October \n2019.46 In  addition  to  the  EMP,  the  contractors  are  also  required  to  follow  safety,  health,  and \nenvironment guidelines for metro projects in India. Mitigation measures for all environmental risks \nidentified  for  the  project  have  been  addressed  through  design  measures  and  inclusion  of \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \n\nSafeguards \n\n45 ADB.

The NCRTC \nheld consultations with key project stakeholders throughout the EIA preparation and these will be \ncontinued during project implementation. A grievance redress mechanism will be implemented \nunder  the  project  to  address  complaints  and  grievances.  To  comply  with  the  ADB  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirement for MFF investments, the NCRTC has prepared an environmental \nassessment and review framework. \n \n45. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The project minimizes involuntary resettlement \nimpacts by using elevated tracks on the carriageway of existing roads. Nevertheless, about 138 \nhectares of private land and 32 hectares of government land will be required for 17 stations and \ntwo  depots.  It  is  estimated  that  813  households  (5,453  people)  will  be  affected  by  physical \ndisplacement  (81  households)  and  economic  displacement  (732  households)  because  of  land \nacquisition  or  restrictions  on  land  use.  Out  of  the  total  project-affected  households,  571 \nhouseholds  (3,997  people)  will  experience  significant  impacts.  The  NCRTC  has  drafted  a \nresettlement plan and has consulted affected communities on proposed mitigation measures to \naddress  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  on  titled  and  nontitled  households.  The  resettlement \nplan has been prepared for the entire Delhi\u2013Meerut corridor based on resettlement surveys, social \nassessments, and consultations. The resettlement plan is in accordance with the Right to Fair \nCompensation  and  Transparency  in  Land  Acquisition,  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Act \n(2013); the direct purchase policies of the Delhi Development Authority (2014) and Uttar Pradesh \n(2015); and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The NCRTC has also prepared a resettlement \nframework  to  guide  the  assessment  and  mitigation  of  unanticipated  involuntary  resettlement \nimpacts of the MFF. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project alignment is generally in urban and peri-\n46. \nurban areas where scheduled tribes do not have cultural attachment to land, customary territories, \nand distinct livelihood systems. Hence, it will not affect indigenous peoples\u2019 communities within \nthe meaning of the ADB SPS. \n \n47. \nThe  NCRTC  will  have  a  social  and  environment  management  unit  for  the  overall \nmanagement of social and environmental safeguards under the investment project. An external \nmonitor both for environment and resettlement will be recruited by the NCRTC to conduct third-\nparty monitoring and to verify the reports submitted by the general consultants. \n \nF. \n \n48. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.47 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nRisks \nInexperience of \nthe executing \nagency \n\nProcurement \ndelays \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measure \nThe executing agency is a newly established organization, but many of the NCRTC\u2019s officers \ncome from the Indian Railways as well as metro corporations across India, including the DMRC, \nand,  therefore,  individually  have  sufficient  experience  in  implementing  railway  and  metro \nprojects. The NCRTC has also hired consultants, comprising leading multinational engineering \nfirms, to assist in ensuring high-quality project design and implementation. \nAll  contracts  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas amended from time to time), with major packages subject to prior review by ADB. Many of the \nNCRTC officers involved in procurement activities are familiar with multilateral development bank \n(e.g., JICA) procurement guidelines that are similar to those of ADB. ADB has also conducted \nprocurement  workshops  for  the  NCRTC  to  enhance  its  understanding  of  ADB  procurement \n\n47 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nRisks \n\nFinancial \nsustainability \n\nCOVID-19 \npandemic \n\nMitigation Measure \npolicy,  guidelines,  and  standard  bidding  documents.
