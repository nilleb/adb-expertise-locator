It will involve upgrading state roads to a two-lane standard. Five year performance-\nbased maintenance of the project roads will ensure sustainability. The project will also support \nincreasing the institutional capacity of the State Highways Authority of Jharkhand (SHAJ) as an \nautonomous  road  development  agency  aiming  to  ensure  long-term  sustainable  development \nand maintenance of the state road network in Jharkhand. SHAJ will become the nodal agency \nfor promoting road safety in Jharkhand based on the road safety master plan to be developed \nunder the project. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nJharkhand was established on 15 November 2000 through bifurcation from Bihar state. It \nis  surrounded  by five states:  Bihar  in the  north, West  Bengal  in  the  east, Odisha  in the  south, \nand  Chhattisgarh  and  Uttar  Pradesh  in  the  west.  It  is  known  as  a  tribal  and  forest  state. \nJharkhand is endowed with about 40% of India\u2019s mineral resources and has the richest deposits \nof  coal  and  iron  ore  in  the  country.  Despite  this,  it  is  one  of  India\u2019s  poorest  states  with  about \n37%  of  its  33  million  population  living  below  the  state  poverty  line. 2 The  endowed  natural \nresources  have  not  efficiently  contributed  to  the  state\u2019s  development  due  to  poor  access  to \nthese areas and limited employment opportunities with the related industries. \n\n4. \nRoad  transport  is  the  dominant  mode  of  transport  in  Jharkhand.  The  state  has  about \n2,000  km  of  railways,  which  primarily  serve  interstate  traffic.  Air  transport  caters  only  to \ninterstate traffic. National Highway No. 2 (NH2) connects Delhi and Kolkata through Jharkhand. \nThe  state  highway  network  provides  connectivity  to  the  NH2  from  various  parts  of  the  state. \nOther categories of roads, including rural and forest roads, connect villages to the state highway \nnetwork.  However,  Jharkhand  does  not  have  an  adequate  road  network.  The  state  has  about \n60,689  km  of  roads,  of  which  rural  roads  represent  about  82%.  The  road  density  is  about  \n76 km/100 square kilometers, compared with the national average of 143 km. Jharkhand\u2019s main \nroad network3 is about 9,278 km; less than 40% meet the two-lane standard.4 About 40% of the \nmain  road  network  is  in  poor  condition.  This  constrains  mobility  between  areas  with  natural \nresources  and  industrial  and  economic  centers,  and  access  to  social  amenities  for  the \npopulation.  In  fact,  industries  are  concentrated  in  the  central  and  eastern  parts  of  the  state \nwhere access to the NH2 is easier, widening the income disparity within the state. \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013. Press Note on Poverty Estimates, 2011\u20132012. New Delhi. For \nfiscal year 2012, the national poverty line for rural areas is estimated at Rs816/capita/month and for urban areas \nRs1,000. Corresponding figures for Jharkhand state are Rs748/capita/month for rural areas and Rs974 for urban \nareas.  \n\n3   Jharkhand  Infrastructure  Development  Corporation.  2013.  Road  Prioritization  Study  cum  Vision  Document  for \nIdentification of Viable Road Sections to be developed in PPP Mode in the State of Jharkhand.  Ranchi. The main \nroad network comprises national highways, state highways, major district roads, and other roads developed by the \nRoad Construction Department of Jharkhand state. \n\n4   India\u2019s national target for 2021 is to ensure all national and state highways and 40% of major district roads are at \nleast  two  lanes.  This  means  about  6,000  km  of  Jharkhand\u2019s  main  road  network  should  be  at  least  two  lanes  by \n2021. Currently, less than 3,700 km meet the standard. \n\n\f \n\nTo  improve  mobility  and  achieve  equitable  development  across  the  state,  Jharkhand\u2019s \n5. \nRoad Construction Department (RCD) has set targets to increase road density by constructing \nnew state roads and improving conditions of the existing road network. An investment of about \n$2.5 billion is planned to develop and improve about 6,000 km during 2012\u20132017, including the \nconstruction of 79 bypasses and bridges. Aside from the budget for the continuing scheme from \nthe  previous  5-year  plan  period,  the  government  requires  a  budget  of  about  $1.6  billion  to \nachieve the target. \n\nTo  enhance  capacity  and  efficiency  in  improving  the  state  road  network,  the  state \n6. \ngovernment  has  created  three  autonomous  bodies:  State  Highways  Authority  of  Jharkhand \n(SHAJ),  Jharkhand  Accelerated  Road  Development  Company,  and  Jharkhand  State  Rural \nRoads  Development  Authority.  Jharkhand  Accelerated  Road  Development  Company  is  a \nspecial  purpose  vehicle,  a  joint  venture  between  the  state  government  and  a  private  firm, \nestablished  to  develop  1,500  lane-km  of  state  highways  on  a  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (annuity) \nbasis. The state government established Jharkhand State Rural Roads Development Authority \nas an autonomous single purpose agency to implement the 100% centrally sponsored rural road \nconnectivity program: Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (the national rural roads mission).  \n\n7. \nSHAJ,  established  in  2007  in  accordance  with  the  State  Highways  Authority  of \nJharkhand Act 2007, has the broadest responsibilities covering the development, maintenance, \nand management of any state roads entrusted by the state government. While the government \nenvisaged that SHAJ would become independent of government funding within 3 years after its \nestablishment, it still functions as a semi-autonomous body fully relying on government funding \nunder RCD. The institutional setup is still in progress with all key personnel deputed from RCD. \nSHAJ requires hands-on external support for institutional development. The functioning of SHAJ \nwith  a  sound  governance  structure  equipped  with  dedicated  and  technically  capable  staff  will \ncontribute to sustainable state road development, ensuring appropriate road maintenance with \nclear  accountability.  The  Jharkhand  government  intends  to  gradually  shift  the  responsibility  of \nstate  road  development  and  maintenance  to  SHAJ  from  RCD  as  SHAJ  strengthens  its \nimplementation capacity over time. \n\n8. \nAppropriate  road  maintenance  with  adequate  budget  allocation  is  critical  for  a \nsustainable state road network. The state government has implemented five state road projects \nfor  a  total  of  185  km,  all  under  a  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (annuity)  scheme,  which  include  15 \nyears  of  maintenance  by \nIt  envisages  promoting  performance-based \nmaintenance  contracts  to  ensure  appropriate  service  for  the  road  network.  The  maintenance \nbudget  allocation  is  prioritized  under  these  schemes  in  accordance  with  the  contractual \nrequirements. Mainstreaming these schemes will ensure sustainability of the road network. \n\nthe  contractor. \n\n9. \nRoad  safety  is  a  concern.  In  2012,  Jharkhand  had  2,119  road  accidents/10,000  km, \nabout  72%  higher  than  the  national  average  of  1,227. 5 Annual  fatality  rates  along  roads  in \nJharkhand  total  9/10,000  vehicles.  While  state  and  district  road  safety  councils  conduct  road \nsafety  awareness  campaigns  annually  in  accordance  with  national  government  initiatives  to \npromote road safety, no state initiatives address road safety, either for road engineering or road \nuser  awareness.  Currently,  road  safety  audits  are  not  mandatory  for  road  engineering  in \nJharkhand; a nodal agency should be designated to promote road safety.  \n\n                                                \n5   Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2014.

The road is in \nthe  northern  part  of  the  state  connecting  to  the  NH2.  All  civil  works  contracts  have  been \nawarded  and  the  construction  works  are  making  good  progress.  The  project  also  supports \nenhancing  the  skills  of  RCD  officials.  The  management  information  system  established  under \nthe project is operating and facilitates project management and planning in RCD. In addition to \nthe  standard  covenants,  the  ongoing  loan  includes  a  covenant  to  establish  a  dedicated  state \nroad fund. The Jharkhand State Road Development Fund Act was enacted in 2011, followed by \nthe Jharkhand State Road Development Fund Rules, 2012. Further, in February 2015, the state \ngovernment issued a notification in the official gazette setting the rate of local tax on fuel to be \nlevied and collected for the fund. \n\n11. \nThe  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  transport  operations  found  that \nADB\u2019s strategic selection and priority areas of its involvement in the sector were significant and \nappropriate  to  the  country\u2019s  needs.7 The  main  weaknesses  identified  are  poor  project  design \nand limited enforcement of safeguards. To overcome these weaknesses, the project has been \ndesigned to focus on improving executing agency performance in core functions, and providing \nassistance  during  project  preparation  and  implementation  to  address  issues  of  safeguard \ncompliance. \n\n12. \nThe project is consistent with the strategic objective set out in ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2013\u20132017 for India on development of the state road network in lagging states; and \nthe transport sector objective of increased, more efficient, and sustainable movement of people \nand goods.8 The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for \nIndia.9 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe impact will be improved mobility and accessibility. The outcome of the project will be \n\n13. \nimproved safety and efficiency of the road transport network in Jharkhand state. \n\n14. \nThe physical output of the project will be about 176 km of state roads reconstructed or \nrehabilitated.  The  nonphysical  output  will  be  institutional  capacity  of  SHAJ  improved  for  key \naspects  of  road  design,  project  implementation,  maintenance,  and  safeguards.  Performance-\nbased maintenance will be undertaken for 5 years after construction. An international standard \nroad  safety  master  plan  will  be  developed  for  SHAJ  to  act  as the  nodal  agency  for  promoting \nroad safety in Jharkhand. \n\n \n\n                                                \n6   ADB. 2009.

SHAJ will implement the project through its field offices at key locations, which \nwill be responsible for day-to-day project implementation and management, and will assign staff \nto work on the project. A full-time project manager will be assigned for each of the four contract \npackages.  The  project  managers  will  be  delegated  adequate  technical  and  administrative \nauthority  for  expeditious  project  implementation.  A  construction  supervision  consultant  (CSC) \nwill  be  recruited  as  the  engineer  for  the  construction  contracts.  A  project  management \nconsultant  (PMC)  will  be  recruited  for  the  capacity  development  of  SHAJ.  All  procurement  of \ngoods and works will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time). All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n19. \nthe project administration manual (footnote 11). \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \n(loan closing date) \nManagement \n\n(i)   Executing and \n\nimplementing agency \n\n(ii)   Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n \n\nRetroactive financing and \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nMarch 2015\u2013December 2019 \n31 December 2019 (30 June 2020)  \n\nState  Government  of  Jharkhand,  acting  through  the  State  Highways \nAuthority of Jharkhand \nThree project implementation units will be set up to implement four road \nconstruction packages at Dumka, Giridih, and Ranchi.

Based  on  this,  the  government  requested  retroactive  financing  for  all \nproject  components.  Up  to  20%  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing, \nprovided  that  expenditures  are  incurred  on  works,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  for  the \nproject  in accordance  with agreed procedures and  during the  12 months  before  the  signing of \nthe  loan  agreement.  The  government  and  SHAJ  were  informed  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n\nThe engineering designs were prepared to avoid or minimize land acquisition as well as \n21. \nsocial  and  environmental  impacts,  taking  road  safety  into  account,  and  minimizing  climate \nchange  risks.  In  addition,  advance  actions  have  been  undertaken  to  ensure  that  construction \ncan commence early. All of these measures have improved project readiness and will mitigate \nthe risk of implementation delays. Road safety audits were conducted for all project roads at the \npreparation  stage.  The  construction  supervision  consultant  will  conduct  road  safety  audits \nduring and after project implementation. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nEconomic evaluation. The evaluation followed the standard practice of comparing life-\ncycle road and user costs with and without the project, using the net present value with a 12% \ndiscount  rate  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criteria.  The  highway \ndevelopment  and  management  system  was  used  in  the  analysis,  focusing  on  transport  cost \nsavings. Value added from better transport links, resulting in new industries and employment, is \ncaptured through benefits from generated traffic. \n \n23. \nThe EIRR for the project roads is estimated as 16.9%. The sensitivity analysis indicates \nthat the  project  would remain economically  viable in the  event  of (i)  a 10%  increase in capital \ncost, (ii) a 10% reduction in benefits, and (iii) a 1-year delay in construction. The results show \nthe quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. All selected roads have \nan  EIRR  above  12%  for  all  sensitivity  tests.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  both  a  10%  increase  in \ncapital cost and a 10% reduction in benefits occur together, the EIRRs of the four project roads \nwould remain above the 12% benchmark. \n\n \n24. \nFinancial  sustainability.  Incremental  recurrent  costs  associated  with  the  project  are \nestimated to be 1.2% of the current road maintenance budget of the state government. Periodic \nmaintenance  costs  of  the  project  roads  are  estimated  as  0.7%  of  the  overall  RCD  budget  in \nFY2014.  Initial  5-year  maintenance  will  be  covered  under  the  performance-based  contract, \nwhich  is  budgeted  as  part  of  the  state  government\u2019s  counterpart  contribution.  Thus,  the  state \ngovernment will likely be able to allocate sufficient budget to SHAJ to maintain the project roads. \n  \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nInstitutional capacity. While the institutional setup of SHAJ is still in progress, RCD will \nfully  support  project  implementation  by  providing  key  personnel,  including  the  chief  executive \nofficer,  from  RCD  to  SHAJ  until  adequate  implementation  capacity  is  established.  The  state \ngovernment  envisages  strengthening  the  implementation  capacity  of  SHAJ  and  developing \nSHAJ  as a full  autonomous  body  as  envisioned  in the  State Highways  Authority  of  Jharkhand \nAct  2007  through  project  execution.  To  support  early  achievement  of  the  goal  and  ensure \nefficient project implementation, the project will provide hands-on support to SHAJ through the \nPMC to be recruited under the project for project implementation as well as overall institutional \ncapacity development. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  concludes  that  the \n26. \noverall  financial  management  risk  is  substantial  and  suggests  mitigation  measures.  Despite \nbeing set up in 2007, SHAJ is still in its early stages of institutional development. Financial and \n\n \n\n\faccounting  activities  are  being  conducted  with  minimal  staff.  Financial  management  practices \nrequire  strengthening,  including  the  development  of  a  management  information  system  and  an \ninternal  control  mechanism.  However,  experience  under  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  project \nindicates  that  fund  flow  arrangements  are  reliable  and  predictable.  With  the  PMC  support \nprovided to SHAJ, the financial management arrangements are expected to be adequate.  \n  \n27. \nProcurement.  RCD  has  experience  in  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment  for  an \nADB  project,  and  will  oversee  the  procurement  activities  of  SHAJ.  Goods  and  works  will  be \nprocured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  All  civil  works  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding. All consulting firms will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  with  a  quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 90:10. SHAJ has prepared the bid documents following the agreed form of master \nbidding  documents  and  commenced  procurement  of  all  four  civil  work  packages  as  advance \nactions.  The  procurement  plan  for  the  project  is  in  the  project  administration manual  (footnote \n11). \n\n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n28. \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  SHAJ.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n29. \nThe  project\u2019s  area  of  impact  can  be  characterized  by  a  predominance  of  traditional \nfarming  and  lack  of  adequate  road  connectivity,  resulting  in  limited  access  to  health  care, \neducation institutions, commercial facilities, and government development agencies. More than \n300  households  along  the  project  roads  were  surveyed;  they  indicated  that  the  poor  road \nconditions  prevent  safe  and  reliable  travel,  especially  at  night  and  during  poor  weather. \nCommunities  indicated  that  positive  benefits  will  include  (i)  improved  access  to  education  and \nhealth  facilities,  (ii)  better  public  and  private  transport  options,  and  (iii)  increased  job \nopportunities.  An  efficient  road  network  linking  villages,  towns,  and  cities  will  provide  stronger \nlinks between rural regions and urban hubs. Road development encourages other development \ninitiatives,  which  together  considerably  stimulate  economic  growth.  The  improvements  are \nexpected to significantly improve the socioeconomic situation and enhance poverty reduction in \nthe  beneficiary  districts  and  the  state  as  a  whole.  The  project  roads  cover  five  districts  where \napproximately  8.3  million  people  reside.  The  project  is  expected  to  generate  approximately \n105,000 person-months of employment. \n \n30. \nGender. Women in the project areas are mainly involved in household work, cultivation, \nand  other  farming  activities.  During  the  nine  women-only  focus  group  discussions  held  during \nproject preparation, women indicated that improved road conditions would provide better access \nto health services, higher education, economic opportunities, and social interactions. Mitigation \nand proactive key actions for the project include (i) constructing more than 60 bus-stop shelters, \n50  km  of  raised  sidewalks  in  urban  areas,  and  4  km  of  dedicated  bicycle  lanes,  which  will \nbenefit pedestrians, the elderly, women, and children; (ii) integrating road safety features for the \nelderly, women, children, and people with disabilities into road design such as proper signage, \nmarked crossings, and 4 km of road with solar-powered street lights; (iii) involving local women \nin  additional  compensatory  afforestation  where  at  least  20%  of  workers  engaged  are  women; \nand  (iv)  encouraging  civil  works  contractors  to  engage  women  workers  as  wage  laborers  and \nensuring  equal  pay  for  equal  work.  The  CSC  will  monitor  implementation.  At  the  institutional \nlevel,  the  PMC  will  integrate  socially  inclusive  practices  into  SHAJ  operations.  This  includes \nmainstreaming  gender  issues  into  operations  such  as  ensuring  a  woman-friendly  workplace. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nThe  PMC  will  also build capacity  of  SHAJ  staff to ensure  social  issues  such  as gender,  labor, \nhealth, and trafficking are considered and implemented during design and construction of future \nprojects. \n \nHIV/AIDS  and  trafficking.  Based  on  an  assessment  by  the  National  AIDS  Control \n31. \nOrganization of the  Ministry  of  Health  and Family Welfare  and the  State  AIDS  Prevention  and \nControl Society, the project area of impact is identified as having low prevalence  of HIV/AIDS. \nThe state government has set up the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit to provide more \ntargeted  interventions  to  high-risk  groups,  and  an  integrated  and  augmented  system  of \nprevention,  care,  support,  and  treatment  in  the  districts.  Existing  government  initiatives  and \nmitigating measures are in place to address all health and social risks and impacts associated \nwith  infrastructure  development  in  the  project  area.  Based  on  the  poverty  and  social \nassessment,  the  project  will  not  increase  HIV/AIDS  incidence  as  all  improved  roads  will  be \nalong  the  existing  corridor.  SHAJ  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  conduct  awareness \nprograms  on  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  and  child  labor  at  construction  camps  and \nworkplaces.  All  contracts  will  have  clauses  on  these  initiatives,  and  the  state  government  will \nmonitor  compliance  during  implementation.  In  project-affected  villages,  awareness-raising \nactivities will be conducted for HIV/AIDS, basic hygiene, and human trafficking. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  B  for  environment  in  accordance  with  ADB's \n32. \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement \nirreversible,  diverse,  or \n(2009).  Overall  no  significant, \nunprecedented environmental impacts are expected. Adequate right-of-way is available for most \nproject roads. The project area does not include any protected areas. Elephant crossings exist \nalong  three  of  the  four  project  roads.  While  the  incremental  impacts  from  the  project  are \nassessed as minimal, additional measures to facilitate elephant movement, improve their habitat, \nand  minimize  collisions  between  elephants  and  human  beings  are  included  in  the  project.  A \nconsolidated  initial  environmental  examination  report,  including  road-specific  environmental \nmanagement  plans  was  prepared  for  the  four  project  roads  in  accordance  with  the  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  and  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  Noise,  pollution,  and  safety  issues \nmay impact receptors adjacent to the roads during construction as well as during operation due \nto  the  increased  traffic.  Mitigation  measures  to  address  all  construction  and  operation-related \nimpacts are included in the road-specific environmental management plans, which form part of \nthe bidding documents as a mandatory requirement for the contractor. Meaningful consultations \nwere  conducted  during  project  preparation  and  concerns  of  the  affected  persons  and \nstakeholders  were  incorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental \nmanagement plans. The member (administration) of SHAJ will serve as the overall coordinator \nof  safeguards.  At  the  project  implementation  unit,  a  dedicated  safeguards  focal  person  will \noversee  implementation  of  safeguards  in  the  field.  The  CSC  will  include  an  environment \nspecialist  to  support  SHAJ  in  monitoring  environment  safeguards.  ADB  and  the  PMC  will \nconduct  an  initial  coordination  and  training  workshop  for  SHAJ  staff,  the  CSC,  and  the \ncontractors  during  the  preconstruction  stage.  Further  training  will  be  conducted  during \nconstruction as necessary. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  four  project  roads  are  designed  to \nminimize  the  need  for  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Four  resettlement  plans \nwere  prepared.  About  63  hectares  of  private  land  will  be  acquired  at  replacement  cost.  Some \n4,024 households will be affected, occupying 2,377 structures. A total of 3,056 households will \nexperience  physical  displacement,  and  1,203  households  will  experience  economic \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fdisplacement.  The  resettlement  plans  are  in  compliance  with  The  Right  to  Fair  Compensation \nand Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act (2013) and ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The displaced households will be entitled to compensation for the \nloss  of  land  and  structures  at  replacement  cost,  shifting  cost,  and  other  income  restoration \nassistance. Resettlement cost is estimated at about $27.3 million. SHAJ will appoint an overall \ncoordinator  of  safeguards.  At  the  project  implementation  unit,  a  dedicated  safeguard  focal \nperson  will  oversee  implementation  of  safeguards  in  the  field.  Experienced  nongovernment \norganizations  and  a  CSC  resettlement  specialist  will  support  implementation  of  involuntary \nresettlement and safeguard monitoring by SHAJ. The PMC will include a resettlement specialist \nto improve SHAJ capacity for social safeguards. \n \n34. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  categorized  C  for  indigenous  peoples,  as  \n307 indigenous  peoples\u2019  households  will  be  impacted  by  involuntary  resettlement. The  census \nfound that these households are not distinctive because they are integrated with the dominant \npopulation  of  the  project  area.  Tribal  groups  in  the  subproject  areas  freely  interact  with  the \noutside community. These groups have nuclear families and are open to new ideas like family \nplanning  and  formal  education.  Social  impact  assessments  confirm  that  the  socioeconomic \nimpacts  caused  by  the  four  project  roads  will  not  be  different  for  these  people  than  for  the \nremainder  of  the  population.  An in-depth analysis  of the magnitude  of  the  resettlement  impact \nthat will be experienced by indigenous peoples\u2019 households is included in a special chapter of \nthe  resettlement  plans.  Adequate  compensation  and  assistance  provisions  are  in  place.  The \nCSC will closely monitor implementation of project activities related to indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.12  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak public \nfinancial \nmanagement \n\nWeak safeguard \nimplementation \n\nUnsustainable \noperations  and \nmaintenance \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe PMC will  support strengthened financial management  operations  of  SHAJ  during \nproject implementation by (i) installing enterprise resource  planning  software \nintegrated  with financial management, and (ii) preparing a financial management \nmanual to reflect accounting policies and procedures and internal control mechanisms \ncommensurate with the size and scale of SHAJ. \nThe project roads were selected as having the minimum social and environmental \nimpacts through the PPTA process undertaking all engineering measures and \nconsultation. The CSC and PMC will provide support during project implementation. \nA 5-year performance-based maintenance contract will be procured covering the four \nproject roads. The PMC will support SHAJ in carrying out procurement for the contract, \nand support development of a road asset management system for SHAJ. The state \ngovernment has given assurance of the establishment of the state road development \nfund as an additional revenue source for SHAJ. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CSC = construction supervision consultant, PMC = project management consultant, \nPPTA = project preparatory technical assistance, SHAJ = State Highways Authority of Jharkhand. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n                                                \n12 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\n36. \nThe Government of India, the State Government of Jharkhand, and SHAJ have assured \nADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices, and disbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan \ndocuments. \n \nThe Government of India, the State Government of Jharkhand, and SHAJ have agreed \n37. \nwith  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement  and \nproject agreement. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n38. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000  to  India  for  the  Second  Jharkhand  State  Road  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n \n18 August 2015 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the project is aligned with: \n \nMobility and accessibility improved (Twelfth Five-Year Plan)a \n \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nand Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting  \n\nRisks \n\n \nPost-implementation \nmeasurement reports by \nSHAJ as approved by \nthe state government \n\n \nSecurity \nsituation in the \nstate \ndeteriorates. \n\nResults Chain \n\nOutcome \nSafety and \nefficiency of the \nroad transport \nnetwork in \nJharkhand state \nimproved \n\n \n\n \n\nBy 2019: \na.
