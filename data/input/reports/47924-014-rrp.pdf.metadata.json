Aggregate  technical  and commercial  (ATC)  losses  at  an  all-\nIndia level were 26.15% in FY2011,1 with some state distribution companies having ATC losses \nas high as 67.74%.2 Financially and operationally viable distribution entities are the foundation \nof  sustainable  power  sector  reform.  Efficiency  improvements  in  distribution  will  reduce  the \nelectricity  demand\u2013supply  gap  in  India  and  reduce  the  investment  required  in  the  upstream \nsector  of  electricity  generation.  In  spite  of  the  strong  development  rationale  for  intervention  in \nthe distribution sector, the participation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in this sector in \nIndia  has  been  limited.  In  2002,  Delhi  was  one  of  the  first  states  to  initiate  the  reform  of  its \nelectricity  distribution  business  by  privatizing  its  three  distribution  companies.  BRPL  is  one  of \nthe three privatized distribution companies in Delhi and is responsible for providing electricity to \nsouth and west Delhi. BRPL is the largest of the three distribution companies in Delhi in terms of \ncustomers served and units of electricity supplied.  \n \n3. \nFrom  initial  discussions  with  BRPL,  ADB  gathered  information  on  the  key  operational \nachievements of the company since 2002\u2014including a reduction in ATC losses from 48.1% in \nFY2002  to  17.3%3 in  FY2013,  and  achieving  a  bill  collection  rate  of  99.5%.  While  challenges \npersist  regarding  the  recovery  of  historical  receivables,  the  recent  record  of  the  independent \nregulator Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) in approving the required step-up in \ntariffs  suggests  political  will  to  ensure  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  private  distribution \ncompanies.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  help  the  company  implement  the  next  round  of  system \nimprovement  measures  to  reduce  ATC  losses  by  3.5%,  in  line  with  the  targets  stipulated  by \nDERC.  Lessons  from  this  financing  will  also  help  ADB  structure  funding  instruments  for  other \ndistribution companies in India and support the country\u2019s power sector reform programs. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design  \n\nBRPL\u2019s  capital  expenditure  plan  for  FY2014\u2013FY2015  will  improve,  expand,  and \n4. \nmodernize  the  company\u2019s  distribution  network  with  the  aim  of  increasing  reliable  electricity \nsupply to residential and commercial consumers in its service area. \n \nBRPL\u2019s  system  improvement  plan  targets  a  3.5%  reduction  in  ATC  losses  by  FY2016. \n5. \nThis  will  include  a  2.3%  reduction  in  technical  losses  and  a  1.2%  reduction  in  commercial \nlosses.  To  reduce  technical  losses,  the  plan  includes  subprojects  targeting  rehabilitation  of \nsubstations, augmentation or replacement of transformers, laying of extra high voltage cables, \n                                                 \n1 Government of India, Central Electricity Agency. 2013.

Commercial  losses  are  expected  to  be \ncurtailed  through  an  expanded  public  awareness  campaign  complemented  by  strict  vigilance \nand enforcement.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n6. \nBRPL  is  owned  51%  by  the  Reliance  ADA  Group  and  49%  by  Delhi  Power  Company \nLimited (DPCL). The majority of the shareholding of the Reliance ADA Group in BRPL is held by \nReliance  Infrastructure  Limited, 4  one  of  India\u2019s  largest  infrastructure  companies  with  total \nrevenues of Rs143.2 billion ($2.4 billion) for FY2013 and a market capitalization of Rs108 billion \n($1.7 billion) as of 15 October 2013. DPCL is 100% owned by the Government of Delhi. DPCL \nwas formed in 2002, when the Delhi power sector was restructured, with a view to holding the \ngovernment\u2019s shareholding in generation, transmission, and distribution companies in Delhi and \nto settle the liabilities of the former state electricity board. DPCL has a shareholding of 21.96% \nin  Indraprastha  Power  Generation  Company  Limited,  6.58%  in  Delhi  Transco  Limited,  and \n49.00%  in  each  of  three  privatized  electricity  distribution  companies  in  Delhi\u2014BRPL,  BSES \nYamuna Power Limited, and North Delhi Power Limited. DPCL is not involved in the day-to-day \noperations of BRPL.  \n \n7. \nBRPL distributes power to 1.82 million customers spread over 750 square kilometers in \nsouth  and  west  Delhi.  BRPL  has  a  diversified  customer  base.  As  of  March  2013,  domestic \ncustomers  (households)  accounted  for  54%  of  the  electricity  consumption,  commercial \ncustomers  (schools,  hospitals,  petrol  pumps,  etc.)  accounted  for  30%  of  the  electricity \nconsumption,  and  industrial  customers\u2014including  the  airport  and  the  metro\u2014  accounted  for \n16%  of  the  electricity  consumption.  Peak  demand  for  BRPL  in  FY2013  was  2,338 megawatts \n(MW). Total input energy was 11,226 gigawatt-hours (GWh). The total energy billed was 9,328 \nGWh  with  a  99.5%  bill  collection  rate,  resulting  in  ATC  losses  of  17.3%  in  FY2013.  It  is \nestimated that the ATC losses comprise technical losses of 13.3% and commercial losses and \npower theft of 4.0%.5 BRPL provides 24x7 electricity supply to its consumers, with an average \npower outage in its area of service of less than 3 minutes per day in 2013. \n \n8. \n \n9. \nRegulatory  assets. The electricity distribution business in Delhi is regulated by DERC \non  a  cost-plus  basis.  DERC  determines  the  retail  tariffs  to  ensure  recovery  of  BRPL\u2019s \nuncontrollable  costs,  reasonable  controllable  costs,  and  the  eligible  return  on  investment.  The \nrapid increase in prices of coal and other fossil fuels caused the power purchase cost of BRPL \nto  increase  by  92%  during  FY2008\u2013FY2013.  To  smooth  the  increase  in  retail  tariffs  to  the \nconsumer,  DERC  decided  to  spread  out  the  recovery  of  these  costs  over  subsequent  years, \nresulting in a revenue gap. DERC recognized this income receivable as a regulatory asset. On \n31  March  2013,  BRPL\u2019s  regulatory  assets  were  estimated  at  Rs66  billion.  To  prevent  a  future \nbuildup  of  regulatory  assets,  DERC  approved  and  notified  a  power  purchase  adjustment  cost \n(PPAC)  mechanism  in  July  2012  that  provides  for  a  quarterly  revision  in  retail  tariffs  to  reflect \nchanges in power purchase cost. The PPAC surcharge for BRPL was 3.0% in the third quarter \n(Q3) of FY2013 and 4.5% in Q4 FY2013. In addition to the PPAC, in July 2012 DERC approved \nand  notified  an  8%  surcharge  on  retail  tariffs  toward  the  recovery  of  accumulated  regulatory \nassets.  Pursuant  to  these  reforms,  recent  tariff  notifications  by  DERC  have  reflected  a  more \ncomplete  pass-through  of  costs  to  consumers.  Tariffs  have  been  increased  by  45%  during \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n                                                 \n4 Confidential information deleted.  \n5 Provisional data. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nFY2011\u2013FY2013.  DERC,  along  with  the  Government  of  Delhi,  is  drafting  a  regulatory  asset \nrecovery  plan  (RARP)  that  will  provide  for  the  amortization  of  historical  regulatory  assets  over \nthe next 5 to 7 years.  \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\nThe project is expected to improve the efficiency of the electricity distribution networks in \n10. \nthe country in order to provide reliable energy access to sustain the country\u2019s economic growth. \nImproved  performance  of  an  electricity  distribution  company  under  professional  private  sector \nownership will provide a showcase for further private sector investment in the sector.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n11. \nThe  project  will  provide  an  expanded  and  increasingly  efficient  supply  of  electricity  to \nresidents of south and west Delhi through adequate upgrading, repair, and maintenance of the \nexisting facilities as well as capacity expansion to accommodate growing demand. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n12.   Successful implementation of the project will rehabilitate and/or augment approximately \n486  distribution  transformers,  266  kilometers  (km)  of  11  kilovolt  (kV)  distribution  lines,  and  16 \nkm  of  extra  high  voltage  lines.  It  will  add  123  new  substations,  285  new  distribution \ntransformers, 221 km of new 11 kV distribution lines, and 21 km of new extra high voltage lines \nas well as additional equipment to improve the automated system for billing and settlements. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.6 Infrastructure development is one of \n13. \nthe  five  core  areas  under  Strategy  2020.  ADB  is  committed,  among  other  things,  to  promote \nenergy  efficiency  through  supply-side  measures  under  Strategy  2020.  The  India  country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 underlines the need for ADB to focus on expanding availability \nand  access  to  energy  by  reducing  losses  and  strengthening  infrastructure. 7  The  project  is \ntherefore fully aligned with the country partnership strategy. Moreover, the project supports the \nGovernment of India\u2019s policy reforms in the electricity distribution sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n14. \nThe  project  is  also  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  highlights  energy  efficiency \nimprovements in transmission and distribution systems.8 The policy proposes that ADB continue \nto  support  installation  of  modern  transmission  systems  to  transmit  electricity  efficiently  from \ngeneration facilities to consumers, including upgrading of existing systems to reduce technical \nlosses. In addition, the energy policy encourages the facilitation of private sector investments to \nimprove energy efficiency.  \n\n                                                 \n6 ADB.  2008.

As part of \nthe  privatization  process  in  2002,  BRPL  signed  a  25-year  license  agreement \nwith DERC for electricity distribution rights for south and west Delhi. \nThe  license  agreement  provides  BRPL  the  right  to  discontinue  supply  of \nelectricity to any consumer in response to nonpayment of the electricity bill and \nto pursue prosecution for theft of power or equipment. \n\nDERC  follows  a  multiyear  tariff  framework  in  determining  the  aggregate \nrevenue  requirement  for  BRPL.  Based  on  an  approved  capital  expenditure \nplan, DERC determines the retail tariff on a cost-plus basis to ensure a return \non equity of 16% to BRPL. Annual review of the tariff provides adjustments for \nuncontrollable  parameters  such  as  changes  in  power  purchase  cost.  Any \ndeviation resulting from a change in controllable parameters, such as operation \nand maintenance expenses or failure to achieve ATC loss reduction targets, is \non  account  of  BRPL.  If  actual  revenue  is  less  than  the  aggregate  revenue \nrequirement, the difference is recognized as a regulatory asset by DERC and \nprovision  for  the  recovery  of  such  regulatory  asset  is  provided  in  subsequent \ntariff revisions. \nDomestic, commercial, and industrial consumers are grouped into 12 different \ntariff  categories  based  on  the  connected  load.  For  each  category,  DERC \nspecifies the applicable tariff, which consists of a fixed charge plus a variable \nenergy  charge.  In  addition,  surcharges  apply  to  peak  hour  consumption  and \nrebates to off-peak consumption.   \n\nPerformance \nstandards \n\nDERC  specifies,  on  an  annual  basis,  performance  standards  for  the  quality \nand efficiency of power supply, reduction  in ATC losses, collection efficiency, \noperation and maintenance costs, and other system parameters. \n\nManagement \n\nBRPL\u2019s  board  of  directors  consists  of  eight  members,  nominated  equally  by \nReliance  Infrastructure  Limited  and  DPCL.  The  chairperson  is  nominated  by \nReliance Infrastructure Limited. Lalit Jalan, chief executive officer of Reliance \nInfrastructure  Limited,  is  currently  the  chairman  of  BRPL.  The  BRPL \nmanagement  team  is  led  by  its  chief  executive  officer,  Gopal  Saxena,  and \nconsists  of  experienced  and  technically  competent  professionals  from  the \nReliance ADA Group. \n\nImplementation period \n\nFY2014\u2013FY2016. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nAspects \nCapital expenditure \nplan \n\nPower purchase \nagreements \n\nArrangements \nBRPL  has  an  ongoing  capital  expenditure  plan  to  achieve  performance \nstandards  specified  by  DERC.  Prior  approval  from  DERC  is  needed  for  any \ncapital expenditure plan in excess of Rs2.5 million. \n\nBRPL  purchases  electricity  from  various  generation  companies  (mostly  from \nstate-owned  power  generation  companies)  under  long-term  power  purchase \nagreements. The power purchase price is determined by the governing central \nor state regulatory commission on a cost-plus basis.  \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nOperation  and  maintenance  is  done  by  BRPL\u2019s  own  staff.

The  proposed  $142  million  capital \nexpenditure will result in a 3.5% reduction in ATC losses, which will conserve 529 \nGWh  of  energy  per  annum  by  FY2016.  This  is  equivalent  to  the  annual  energy \noutput  of  a  242 MW  wind  power  plant,  which  would  require  an  investment  of \n$222 million; or a 302 MW solar photovoltaic power plant, which would require an \ninvestment  of  $385  million. 9 By  supporting  the  project,  ADB  will  spotlight  the \ncritical  importance  of  investments  aimed  at  improving  distribution  networks, \nwhich  are  more  productive  in  reducing  the  demand\u2013supply  gap  in  India  than \ninvestments in greenfield clean energy generation facilities.  \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  provide  much  needed  funding  to  BRPL  for \nsystem improvement. BRPL\u2019s existing, mainly public sector owned lenders have \n\n                                                 \n9  Using Central Electricity Regulatory Commission norms for the capital expenditure cost for wind (Rs57.5 million per \nMW)  and  solar  photovoltaic  (Rs80  million  per  MW)  and  a  capacity  factor  of  25%  for  wind  and  18%  for  solar \nphotovoltaic based on the performance of existing ADB Private Sector Operations Department projects in India. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n \n\n\f          \n6\n\n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n(iii) \n\nlimited  appetite  for  further  lending  to  the  sector  given  their  overall  power  sector \nexposure  limits.  ADB  assistance  will  ensure  that  BRPL  is  able  to  continue  its \nsystem improvement plans to reduce ATC losses. \nThe  borrower  will  establish  and  implement  a  new  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) requirements, thereby improving the company\u2019s environmental and social \npractices.  \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n22. \nRegulatory  asset  recovery  plan.  DERC  recently  implemented  the  quarterly  PPAC \nmechanism  and  an  8%  regulatory  asset  recovery  surcharge  which  helped  BRPL  achieve \nbreakeven in the quarter ending June 2013, after years of inadequate cost recovery. While this \nis a positive development, the approval of the RARP, which will ensure the recovery of historical \nregulatory assets, is still pending. The RARP is expected to be approved by January 2014.  \n \nRegulatory  risk.  DERC  has  been  in  existence  since  1999.  In  the  past  DERC  had  on \n23. \nfrequent occasions delayed providing tariff adjustments for increases in power purchase costs \nresulting  in  increases  to  BRPL\u2019s  financial  deficit  and  the  creation  of  large  regulatory  assets. \nHowever,  DERC  has  now  recognized  the  importance  of  timely  tariff  adjustments  to  ensure \ncomplete cost recovery and has been issuing regular tariff orders including the recent July 2013 \ntariff order approving a 5% increase in tariffs. Long term viability of BRPL heavily depends on \ncontinued adequacy of tariffs to recover costs. In addition to notifying tariff orders, DERC also \nsets the standard for quality, efficiency and reliability of the distribution network and approves all \ncapital  expenditure  programs.  If  the  regulator  reinterprets  existing  regulations  or  creates  new \nones  in  the  future,  this  could  increase  costs  or  reduce  revenues.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  the \nimportance of the privatization of the electricity distribution business in Delhi as a showcase for \nthe central government as it continues energy sector reforms across the country. \n \n24. \n \n25. \nPower  purchase  cost.  The price of electricity purchased by BRPL under its long-term \npower  purchase  agreements  is  not  fixed;  it  is  regulated  by  the  concerned  state  or  central \nelectricity  regulatory  commission.  In  the  past,  an  increase  in  power  purchase  cost  would  not \nautomatically  result  in  an  increase  in  tariff.  DERC  evaluated  the  merits  of  each  case  and  the \ntariff increase was effected in the next tariff revisions. This delay and timing mismatch between \nthe increase in power purchase cost and the increase in tariffs resulted in increased short-term \nborrowings  for  BRPL.  Recent  initiatives  such  as  the  PPAC  mechanism  provide  for  a  quarterly \nrevision in tariffs to reflect changes in power purchase costs. \n \n26. \n \n27. \nExecution  and  maintenance  risk. The feasibility of BRPL\u2019s investment plan has been \nassessed by ADB\u2019s external technical advisor. BRPL faces completion and execution risks but it \nis considered to have sufficient experience and technical capacity to undertake the investment \nplan.  The  technical  advisor  has  confirmed  that  the  proposed  investment  plan  and  BRPL\u2019s \nmaintenance  strategy  are  appropriate.  The  costs  of  the  proposed  investment  are  in  line  with \nmarket benchmarks.  \n \n28. \nDemand  risk.  BRPL  expects  demand  to  grow  by  5%  per  annum  during  the  next \n10 years. A reduction in demand could result in increased short-term sale of the excess power \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nprocured  by  BRPL  under  its  long-term  power  purchase  agreements.  The  multiyear  tariff  2012 \nregulations, along with the PPAC mechanism, allow for an adjustment in the tariff on account on \nany short-term sale of excess power. However, this adjustment is only quarterly, resulting in a \nshort  lag  in  recovery  in  case  of  a  loss  from  the  short-term  sale.  Nevertheless,  demand  risk  is \nexpected  to  be  low.  Rapid  urbanization  and  development  of  transportation  infrastructure  are \nexpected to be the key drivers of demand growth. \n \n29. \n \n30. \n \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n(iv) institutional  arrangements \n\n31. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the potential environmental and \nsocial  impacts  of  the  project  have  been  identified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize, \nmitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts will be incorporated in the safeguard reports \nand  plans.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  as  its  potential  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  are  site-specific,  reversible,  and  mostly  associated  with  construction \nactivities.  A  corporate  audit  on  current  operations  by  BRPL  and  implementation  of  BRPL\u2019s \nproposed investment has been conducted. The current environmental assessment practices are \nbased  on  national  requirements.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  audit,  BRPL  will  establish  and \nimplement a new ESMS to comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. The new \nESMS  will  include  (i)  BRPL\u2019s  environmental  and  social  policies,  (ii)  a  screening  and \ncategorization  procedure  for  its  activities,  (iii)  an  environmental  and  social  impacts  review \nprocedure, \nfor  environmental  and  social  assessment, \n(v) organizational  structure  and  staffing  for  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  and \n(vi) reporting  and  monitoring.  BRPL  commits  to  establish  its  ESMS  prior  to  the  first \ndisbursement  of  the  proposed  loan.  Initial  environmental  examinations  for  the  subprojects  will \nbe prepared in line with the ESMS and reviewed by ADB prior to the first disbursement. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \n32. \nindigenous  peoples.  The  proposed  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  entail  involuntary \nresettlement as the lands for substations and transformers are usually provided to BRPL on a \nlong-term  lease  basis  by  the  government  agencies.  The  laying  of  cables  is  not  expected  to \nresult in land acquisition or resettlement impacts as these are within the available right-of-way of \nthe  roads  or  lands  belonging  to  other  government  departments.  The  audit  confirmed  that \nBRPL\u2019s projects in the past have not involved any land acquisition. In the unlikely event of land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement, the required procedures for screening and preparation \nof  resettlement  plans  (in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement)  will  apply.  The \naudit  also  noted  that  there  are  no  indigenous  peoples  residing  in  the  subproject  locations  in \nsouth and west Delhi. Procedures and policy for screening and categorization of social risks and \nimpacts,  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  will  be  integrated  in  BRPL\u2019s \nESMS to comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n33. \nThe audit findings and corrective actions have been discussed and agreed with BRPL. \nBRPL\u2019s commitment to establish a new ESMS will be a condition for the proposed ADB funding. \nThe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  BRPL  to  manage  social,  environmental,  health, \nand  safety  impacts  of  the  project  are  deemed  adequate.  BRPL  is  also  committed  to  engage \nadequate  environmental  and  social  staff  and  arrange  periodic  corporate  and  site  level  training \n\n \n \n\n\f          \n8\n\nfor  them.  BRPL  will  strengthen  its  procedures  for  meaningful  consultation  and  information \ndisclosure,  a  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and  monitoring  and  reporting.  BRPL  will  prepare \naudit reports, and corrective action plans or environmental and social plans for existing facilities. \nBRPL will submit reports to ADB on the implementation status of the ESMS. \n \n34. \nOther social dimensions. The project is classified as having no gender elements. Apart \nfrom providing equal opportunities for women in employment, BRPL is committed to undertake \nthe following measures to improve its consumer services: (i) serving on priority (senior citizens \nand  women  with  children)  at  the  consumer  service  center;  (ii)  separate  queues  in  payment \ncollection centers for women and senior citizens; and (iii) employing women for bill distribution \nactivities.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  provisions  requiring \nBRPL  to  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  to  take  specific  measures  in  relation  to \ninternationally recognized core labor standards for the ADB-financed portion of the projects, in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n35. \nBRPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.    \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe  proposed  loans  are  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n36. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 10  the \n37. \nGovernment  of  India  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance to BRPL. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n38. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$80,000,000  (or  in  Indian  rupee  equivalent)  to  BSES  Rajdhani  Power  Limited  for  the  Delhi \nElectricity  Distribution  System  Improvement  Project  in  India  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set \nforth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n19 November 2013 \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1966.
