THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $40,000,000 (in Sri Lanka rupee [SLRe] equivalent) in John Keells Holdings \nPLC (JKH) for the John Keells Modern Retail Infrastructure Expansion Project in Sri Lanka. The \nreport also describes the proposed administration of an equity investment of up to $40,000,000 \n(in SLRe equivalent) to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private Infrastructure Fund1 (LEAP), \nand if the Board approves the proposed equity investment, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, approve the administration of the equity investment. Further, the report also \ndescribes  the  proposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the \nCanadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia (CFPS) for Building Capacity for Climate \nResilience and Organic Farming among Vegetable and Fruit Growers, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed equity investment, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The project, part of a multi-year, multi-business corporate capital expenditure program, \nwill support the expansion of modern retail infrastructure, including supermarkets and back-end \nsupply  chain  infrastructure  including  centralized  distribution  logistics  centers,  and  climate-\nresilience training for farmers. These actions will strengthen the market links for farmers and \nimprove access to better-quality food products for consumers. The project will also support gender \ninclusion. It is fully aligned with the Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s goals of creating jobs, enhancing \nincome levels, developing the rural economy, and creating a wide and strong middle class.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Sri Lanka has been facing significant fiscal challenges in recent \nyears.  Growth-slowing  shocks  such  as  droughts  in  2017,  a  constitutional  crisis  in  2018, \ncoordinated terror attacks in 2019, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 \nand 2021 weakened its economy. As a result, the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) \ncontracted by 3.6% in 2020, and unemployment rate rose from 4.8% in 2019 to 5.5% in 2020.3 \nForeign exchange earnings declined markedly and put pressure on the exchange rate and \nreserves. The fiscal deficit rose from 8.2% of GDP in 2019 to an estimated 12.5% in 2020 \n(footnote 3). The country is facing mounting public and external debt: government debt rose to \n101.0% of GDP in 2020, and significant debt repayments are coming up during 2022\u20132026.4 The \nstrained finances and reserves have prompted all major credit rating agencies to downgrade the \ncountry rating. Sri Lanka is rated CCC+ by S&P Global Ratings and Caa2 by Moody\u2019s Investors \nService. This has significantly affected the investment climate in the country.  \n \n4.  82% of Sri Lanka\u2019s total population resides in rural areas, and agriculture remains the \nbackbone of the economy. Almost half of poor rural people are small-scale farmers. Agriculture \nin Sri Lanka is plagued by issues such as fragmentation of land, unclear land rights, low levels of \nfarmers\u2019 knowledge and skills, and a limited focus on research and technology. This has led to \nlow land productivity and volatile production levels. Given its already high temperatures, complex \nhydrological regime, and exposure to extreme weather events, Sri Lanka is particularly vulnerable \n \n1  Japan International Cooperation Agency is the financing partner.  \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017.

Washington, DC. \n \n ", "2 \nto  climate  change.  Temperature  increases  are  likely  to  put  further downward  pressure  on \nagricultural yields, potentially having a negative impact on national and household food security.5  \n \n5.  COVID-19 and the recent sovereign fiscal issues also brought to the fore food insecurity \nissues. In May 2021, Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Finance placed strict restrictions on the import of \nfertilizers and agrochemicals, effective immediately.6 Although the government pledged to locally \nproduce 1 million tons of organic fertilizers annually to help reduce agrochemical use and support \nthe  country\u2019s move to organic  farming,  these capabilities  do  not  yet exist.  The  Sri  Lanka \nAgricultural Economics Association voiced concerns that the regulation\u2019s \u201cimmediate adverse \nimpacts on food security, farm incomes, foreign exchange earnings and rural poverty can be \ndetrimental to achieving the cherished long-term goals.\u201d7 \n \n6.  Owing to the budgetary targets of reducing the fiscal deficit and controlling the level of \nsovereign debt, it is difficult for the government to provide additional fiscal stimulus. Catalyzing \ndomestic private investment and attracting higher foreign direct investment are critical for the \nsustainable growth of Sri Lanka.8 \n \n7.  JKH, a 150-year-old group, is one of the largest listed companies in Sri Lanka and present \nin all major sectors of the economy: transportation, consumer foods, retail, leisure, property, \nfinancial services, and others such as information technology and agricultural plantations. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) identified JKH as a suitable candidate for support because of \n(i) the leading market position of its businesses, advanced technical and managerial capability, \nand satisfactory financial performance; (ii) its growth potential across business segments, and \n(iii) the ability to reach a large number of beneficiaries since it employs more than 20,000 people \nand engages with more than 8,000 farmers. \n \n8.  Project design. (Confidential information deleted).  \n \n9.  Improved modern retail infrastructure. The project aims to improve the food supply \nchain by (i) building and equipping a state-of-the-art distribution logistics center (Confidential \ninformation deleted); (ii) expanding modern food retail facilities (Confidential information deleted); \nand (iii) increasing the collection of fresh produce from farmers. (Confidential information deleted) \nThis will stem post-harvest losses in the value chain and give consumers greater access to safe \nand nutritive food. (Confidential information deleted). By adding supermarkets, JKH will extend its \nfarmer procurement network and the newly built assets will also increase its domestic purchases \nby 20%, create 1,500 new jobs (of which 700 will be for women), strengthen livelihoods and \nlivelihood options in rural areas, and boost annual tax payments to the government(Confidential \ninformation deleted).   \n \n10.  Improved food safety and climate resilience. Through the complementary TA, the \nproject will build the capacity of 2,000 fruit and vegetable farmers who supply produce to JKH\u2019s \nsupermarkets for (i) using best practice and technologies in climate-resilient and organic farming, \nadapted to the needs of the local context; and (ii) gaining functional financial literacy, including \n \n5  ADB and the World Bank Group. 2020.

This support will help farmers increase their incomes.  \n \n11.  Gender context. Women play an active part in the agriculture sector and the food value \nchain  but  have  unequal  access  to  skills,  extension  services,  and  markets.  Women  are \nconcentrated in low-productivity and low-income agriculture and in plantation businesses, in \nassembly-line jobs,  and  other  industries  with minimal  opportunities  for  promotion.9 Despite \npositive developments in health and education, gender inequality persists in the Sri Lankan labor \nmarket. Women\u2019s participation in the economy was only 37% in 2017, compared with 75% for \nmen.10 Many factors contribute to low women\u2019s labor force participation, including the lack of \naffordable and quality childcare services, disproportionate burden of household work on women, \nand some workplace cultures that are not supportive of women employees.11 \n \n12.  Investee. JKH is one of the largest listed companies in Sri Lanka (Confidential information \ndeleted). At the end of FY2021, its workforce totaled 20,092. JKH has a diversified presence \nacross almost all major sectors of the local economy.  \n \n13.   JKH\u2019s group-level board of directors comprises two executive and five independent \ndirectors. The board is responsible for supervising the overall management of the company and \nthe group, including providing direction and guidance on the formulation of sustainable, high-level \nstrategies; monitoring governance and compliance systems; and reviewing and approving major \nacquisitions, disposals, and capital expenditure. The board has five subcommittees: audit, human \nresources and compensation, nominations, related-party transaction review, and project risk \nassessment. The current chairman and chief executive officer is Krishan Balendra, who joined \nJKH in 2002 and is a seasoned lawyer and banker by training and experience. The group has a \nnumber of subsidiary companies with independent management bodies and boards of directors. \n \n14.  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence.12 JKH,  its  shareholders,  ultimate  beneficial \nowners, board members, and senior management do not appear to constitute a significant \nintegrity or reputational risk. ADB\u2019s review of JKH does not give ADB cause to believe that JKH \nis being used for money laundering, terrorism financing, tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud in \nSri Lanka. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n15.  Impact.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  local  enterprises \nstrengthened, food security ensured, and employment generated; and (ii) climate resilience of the \nagriculture  sector  improved  through  adoption  of  appropriate  adaptation  and  mitigation \nmeasures.13  \n \n16.  Outcome.  The  project\u2019s  expected  outcome  will  be  the  expansion  of  sustainable \ndistribution of quality consumer food products. \n \n17.  Outputs. The project\u2019s expected outputs will be: (i) company's capacities for retail and \ndistribution of consumer products expanded, (ii) local employment with enhanced gender equality \ngenerated, (iii) farmers' climate resiliency and financial literacy improved in a gender-sensitive \n \n9  ADB. 2015.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 203014 and four of its operational priorities: 1\u2014addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities (by improving the incomes of farmers and creating jobs); 2\u2014accelerating \nprogress  in  gender  equality  (by  promoting  gender  equality  through  a  gender  action  plan);             \n3\u2014enhancing  environmental  sustainability  (by  promoting  the  adoption  of  climate-smart \ntechnologies to ensure sustainable use of land and water resources); and 5\u2014promoting rural \ndevelopment and food security (by improving market connectivity, enhancing food safety, and \nincreasing food security).15 The project is also aligned with ADB's (i) Operational Plan for Private \nSector Operations, 2019\u20132024 (OP PSO),16 which calls for strengthening ADB\u2019s equity operations \nand rebuilding the portfolio, and mobilizing finance from third parties; and (ii) country partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 with Sri Lanka (footnote 2) because it strengthens agricultural infrastructure \nand commercialization and promotes private sector development. \n \n19.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith ADB's operational plan for priority 5, which focuses on \u201clooking for opportunities to make an \nimpact in the fast-growing branded food, modern retail, and e-commerce sectors driven by the \nemergence of the urban middle class\" (Operational Plans: Overview, para. 42). OP PSO also \nstates that \u201cgrowing the share of food brands and food retail in the portfolio is another priority as \ntransactions in this downstream subsector have the highest return on capital; the lowest level of \nrisks; and the potential to drive and structure upstream subsectors (e.g., on quality standards, \ntraceability) and impact a large number of farmers and consumers.\u201d (OP PSO, para. 43). The TA \nwill explore opportunities to build synergies with upcoming sovereign operations under the new \ncountry partnership strategy, in particular integrated rural development operations. \n \nD.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB's assistance will comprise: (i) an equity investment of up to $25,000,000 from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with the option to invest an additional amount of up to $15,000,000; \n(ii) an equity investment of up to $25,000,000 from LEAP, administered by ADB, also with the \noption to invest an additional amount of up to $15,000,000,17 and (iii) a $500,000 TA grant \nfinanced  by  CFPS  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility.  (Confidential \ninformation deleted)  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB assistance will add value on three fronts: \n(i)  Providing equity capital and mobilizing co-investment. ADB will provide equity \ncapital at a time when the investment climate in the country is challenging, and \nboth foreign and domestic liquidity is affected by the pandemic. ADB\u2019s investment \nwill  improve  investor  confidence  by  sending  a positive  signal to the market. \nNotably, ADB\u2019s investment will mobilize co-investment of up to $40,000,000 from \nJapan International Cooperation Agency through LEAP, (Confidential information \ndeleted). The proposed TA also mobilizes $500,000 in donor funds from CFPS for \nthe entire TA program. \n(ii)  Encouraging best-practice governance and safeguards standards. ADB will \npromote higher governance standards (Confidential information deleted). ADB will \npromote better safeguards practices (Confidential information deleted).

POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n33.  ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with its Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous \npeoples (category C).18 \n \n34.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. External consultants conducted an audit of \nJKH\u2019s existing corporate environmental and social management system (ESMS) and its policies \nand procedures; and also conducted environmental and social compliance audits of samples of \nsubproject sites within the business units that will utilize ADB financing. The environmental and \nsocial measures, and the institutional capacity and commitment of JKH to manage the project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n35.   (Confidential information deleted). \n \n36.  JKH purchases or rents land for its developments. Land renting is based on the willing \nlessor, willing lessee principle, wherein rent is determined based on negotiation and local market \nrates. The audit found no outstanding compensation issues, and no previous cases of eviction or \nresettlement  of  communities  because  of  land  purchased  or  leased  for  the  company's \ndevelopments. However, there are no established procedures for assessing and preparing the \nrequired  social  documents  in  case  of  a  subproject  expansion  or  unanticipated  involuntary \nresettlement impacts, such as those related to the displacement of informal land users, which \nwould trigger the Safeguard Policy Statement's Safeguard Requirement 2. The proposed ADB-\nfunded subprojects are not expected to affect the dignity directly or indirectly, human rights, \nlivelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples, or affect the territories or natural or cultural \nresources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as ancestral domain or assets. The \nenhanced ESMS will require appropriate screening and categorization procedures to ensure ADB \nfunds are not used on subprojects that involve Indigenous Peoples impacts.  \n \n37.  JKH has numerous environmental, health, safety, and social policies and procedures, both \nat corporate level and in its subsidiaries, to manage, monitor, and report on the environmental, \nhealth, safety, and social aspects of its operations. ADB\u2019s environmental and social due diligence \nof the project requires that JKH\u2019s ESMS be enhanced with respect to the business units and \nspecific investment activities that receive ADB financing, so as to meet the requirements of the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. (Confidential information deleted). \n \n38.  JKH will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list to ADB-financed activities in \nthe business units concerned, (ii) ensure that investments using ADB funds comply with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement and abide by national laws and regulations, and (iii) establish and \nmaintain a subsidiary-specific ESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement. The ESMS will set \nout  the  requirements,  as  applicable,  for  compliance  with  national  labor  laws  as  well  as \ninternationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001).  The ESMS will also contain requirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people following ADB requirements. JKH will report regularly to ADB \non (i) the nature of subprojects and their categorization, (ii) its compliance with the safeguard and \nsocial requirements, (iii) its compliance with applicable national and international laws and \n \n18 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n \n ", "7 \nstandards, and (iv) its progress in implementing environmental and social actions.19 Proposed \nenhancements to the ESMS will be completed prior to disbursement. \n \n39.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998),20 JKH took measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its \nbusiness activities.
