Rapid  urbanization,  coupled  with  population  growth,  has  led  to \nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) generation in Viet Nam increasing to unmanageable levels. During \n2004\u20132015, waste generation increased by about 78.2% from 15.6 million tons per year to about \n27.8 million tons per year. A significant portion of the waste collected is disposed of in landfills \nwithin  200\u2013500  meters  of  residential  areas.  Less  than  30%  of  those  sites  are  classified \nengineered or sanitary landfills. This poses a grave threat to public health in areas with high waste \ngeneration because of the contamination of ground and surface water from untreated leachate; \nemissions of airborne pollutants; and the spread of flies, mosquitoes, rodents, and dust. \n \n3. \nTo address the increasing problems of MSW management, the Government of Viet Nam \nissued several laws and regulations calling for an immediate attention to the management and \ndisposal  of  waste  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  Waste-to-energy  (WTE)  was \nrecognized as an effective method to reduce the waste volume by 90% and eliminate methane \n(CH4) emissions. WTE technologies use the waste heat from incineration to produce electricity \nand  heat.  By  replacing  fossil  fuel  combustion  and  avoiding  CH4,  WTE  technologies  reduce \ngreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and  mitigate  climate  change.  In  2014,  the  Prime  Minister \nissued  a  directive  to  encourage  private  sector  investments  in  WTE  projects\u2014to  manage  the \nincreasing  volume  of  solid  waste  and  help  address  the  country\u2019s  electricity  requirements.  The \ndirective includes a feed-in tariff (FIT) equivalent to $0.1005 per kilowatt-hour. \n  \n4. \nDespite  the  recent  policy  shift  in  favor  of WTE  and  the  increased  interest  of  municipal \ngovernments in clean technologies, market barriers still limit private sector participation in WTE. \nTo date, only one plant, supported by technical assistance funds and grants, has been built with \na capacity to treat 75 tons of industrial waste per day and a power generation capacity of 1.93 \nmegawatts (MW).1 Key bottlenecks include lack of an effective public\u2013private risk allocation and \nlack of access to long-term finance. \n \n5. \nThrough  ongoing  discussions  with  stakeholders,  the  project  team  identified  that  CEIL \npossess  a  desirable  business  model  that  can  leverage  its  operational  experience  with  clean \ntechnologies  to  pursue  new  ventures  in  municipal-level  PPP  projects  in  Viet  Nam,  which  are \nsmaller  than  the  central  government-led  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  projects  and  more \ndifficult  to  attract  private  sector  participation.  CEIL  can  effectively  burn  MSW  with  high  water \ncontent in Viet Nam without supplemental fuel (such as coal), and can enter into a municipal PPP \narrangement without a sovereign guarantee.  \n \n6. \nProject design. The project, through a portfolio approach, will support the construction \nand  operation  of  a  series  of WTE  plants  with  advanced  clean technologies,  including  flue  gas \nemission control to meet European Union (EU) standards, in multiple municipalities. Each WTE \n\n                                                \n1  Nam  Son  Waste  Treatment  Complex  in  Soc  Son  District,  Ha  Noi  developed  by  the  New  Energy  and  Industrial \n\nTechnology Development Organization of Japan. \n\n\f2 \n\nplant will treat MSW and supply electricity to the local grid. Each plant incinerates MSW, recovers \nwaste heat for power generation, purifies waste gas, and treats leachate. Under the project, CEIL \naims to develop and invest in WTE subprojects to treat 7,500 tons of MSW daily in Viet Nam. \nCEIL is developing subprojects in primary and secondary cities in the Mekong Delta and northern \nViet  Nam.  This  project  will  be  the  first  municipal  WTE  project  financed  entirely  by  the  private \nsector. \n \n7. \nBorrower.  Since  its  establishment  in  1993,  CEIL  has  become  a  leading  integrated \nenvironmental  protection  company  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Following  the \nGovernment of the PRC\u2019s policy to introduce private sector participation in the environment sector \nin  2003,  CEIL focused  on WTE,  wastewater management,  and  renewable energy  businesses. \nCEIL has distinguished itself from its peers by implementing higher environmental standards such \nas the EU2010 Standard.2 In recognition of CEIL\u2019s environmentally sustainable operations, it has \nrecently been included in the FTSE4 Good Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index3 \nbased on compliance with global standards on environment, social, and governance practices. \n \nOne  of the key  technical  challenges of WTE  in Viet  Nam  is  a  low  net  calorific  value  of \n8. \nMSW with high water content\u2014estimated at 3,600\u20137,900 kilojoules per kilogram, which is much \nlower  than  the  calorific  value  of  MSW  in  developed  countries  (8,400\u201317,000  kilojoules  per \nkilogram). CEIL has been addressing low calorific MSW in smaller cities and islands in the PRC \nthrough improved design and operational expertise.  \n \n9. \nAt  the  end  of  June  2017,  CEIL  had  32 WTE  subprojects  in  operation  with  a  combined \nprocessing  capacity  of  28,300  tons  per  day  and  generation  capacity  of  about  1,500  gigawatt-\nhours  a  year.  For  the  6  months  ended  in  June  2017,  CEIL  reported  consolidated  revenue  of \nHK$9.1 billion ($1.2 billion) and profit attributable to equity holders of HK$1.8 billion ($0.2 billion). \nThis represents an increase of 69% in revenue and 49% in profit attributable to equity holders \ncompared  with  the  same period  in 2016.  CEIL\u2019s  consolidated  total  assets  was HK$61.9  billion \n($7.9 billion) and consolidated total equity was HK$25.5 billion ($3.3 billion) at the end of June \n2017.  Listed  on  the  main  board  of  the  Hong  Kong  Stock  Exchange,  CEIL  has  a  market \ncapitalization as of 30 October 2017 of HK$48.7 billion ($6.2 billion). \n \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \n\n10. \nImpacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: increased use of solid waste \nfor power generation as part of the country\u2019s solid waste management strategy,4 and increased \nshare of biomass-based power plants, which include WTE facilities, to account for about 2.1% of \nthe country\u2019s total installed capacity by 2030.5 \n \nOutcome. The project will have the following outcome: MSW treated and energy produced \n11. \nfrom environmentally sustainable WTE plants in Viet Nam.6 By 2028, 2.5 million tons of MSW will \n\n                                                \n2  Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions (integrated pollution \n\nprevention and control). 24 November 2010. \n\n3  CEIL was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for two consecutive years (2016\u20132017). \n4  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  of  Viet  Nam.  2009.

The outputs will be the construction of WTE plants across Viet Nam; growth of \nlocal  economy;  and  generation  of  employment.  WTE  subprojects  will  be  developed  with  the \ncapacity to treat 7,500 tons of MSW per day; and an installed capacity of 110 MW of electricity by \n2022.  The  facilities  will  comply  with  ADB  safeguard  requirements  and  technical  and  financial \neligibility criteria. During the construction period (2018-2021), roughly $250 million of goods and \nservices will be procured from the local economy, and about 1,500 jobs created.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of \n13. \nStrategy  2020  outlined  10  strategic  priorities  of  ADB  operations  to  address  the  development \nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific. The project supports three of those priorities: (i) environment \nand  climate  change,  (ii)  infrastructure  development,  and  (iii)  private  sector  development  and \noperations.8 The project is the country\u2019s first PPP in municipal environmental infrastructure. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020 aims to foster inclusive and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth.  The  project  is  aligned  with  two  of  the  three  pillars  of  the \nstrategy: (i) increasing the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery, and (ii) improving \nenvironmental sustainability and climate change response. Under the strategy, ADB will increase \nthe  focus  on  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management,  including  through  PPP,  to  promote \ninclusive urbanization.9 \n \n15. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s energy policy, which encourages interventions designed to shift reliance on fossil fuel \nsources for energy to renewable forms of energy to slow down the growth of GHG emissions and \nhelp countries achieve energy self-sufficiency.10 The project will mitigate GHGs by replacing coal \nwith MSW in power generation and through the avoidance of CH4 from landfills. The project is \nalso  aligned  with  Viet Nam\u2019s  commitments  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on \nClimate Change, and will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of providing $6.0 billion per year in climate \nfinance by 2020. \n \n16. \nLessons from previous operations. The design of the project in Viet Nam took careful \nconsideration  of  the  experience  from  previous  WTE  projects.  ADB  supported  municipal  and \nagricultural  WTE  projects  in  the  PRC  in  2009  and  2012.11 ADB\u2019s  portfolio  approach  has  also \nfacilitated  the  financing  of  multiple  subprojects  too  small  to  be  financed  alone.  This  has \ncontributed  to  PPP  developments  in  municipal  environmental  infrastructure  and  has  mitigated \nGHG emissions effectively. The first project was rated as satisfactory based on four criteria: (i) its \n                                                \n7  A carbon footprint is measured based on tCO2e. This allows for the different GHGs (i.e., carbon dioxide, CH4, nitrous \noxide,  hydrofluorocarbons,  perfluorocarbons,  and  sulphur  hexafluoride)  to  be  compared  on  a  like-for-like  basis \nrelative to one unit of carbon dioxide. \n\n8  ADB. 2014.

The key issues that have impeded investments include \n(i)  transparency  in  regulations  and  implementation,  (ii)  risk  allocation  between  the  public  and \nprivate sectors, (iii) land use rights, (iv) cost-recovery tariffs, and (v) availability of long-term debt. \nWhile a new PPP law was issued in April 2015 to encourage private sector investments, private \nsector participation in infrastructure is still nascent. \n  \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\n18. \n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \nOperations arrangements \n\nRevenue structure \n\nArrangements \nDecree 59 outlines the general principles of MSW management to be adopted \nthroughout the country. The operation of WTE facilities are considered a solid waste \ndisposal activity that is covered by the decree. MSW management activities will be \nsupported by state budgets unless a separate financing is specifically provided for \nunder this decree. \nCircular 121 outlines the various fiscal and non-fiscal incentives available for \ninvestors engaged in MSW management activities. \nDecision 2149 sets the national targets for MSW management activities for the years \n2020 and 2025. \nDecision 31 provides for specific incentives for WTE projects to encourage \ninvestments in the sector. \nCEIL sets up subproject companies to construct, own, and operate WTE plant in \neach city. CEIL will control, manage, and provide management and operational \noversight to each subproject company as the largest shareholder. \nJanuary 2018\u2013December 2021 \n \nEach subproject will have two revenue streams. \nPower generation. Each subproject company will sell electricity to Vietnam Electricity \nunder a 20-year power purchase agreement. Power sold under the power purchase \nagreement will be paid at a feed-in tariff of D2,114 per kilowatt-hour (equivalent to \n$0.1005 per kilowatt-hour). The law provides for periodic adjustments for fluctuations \nin foreign exchange, though the mechanism for such adjustment needs to be \nclarified. Under the law, all power generated and delivered to the metering point by \nthe subproject companies will be taken by Vietnam Electricity. \nWaste treatment. Each subproject company will enter a service agreement with the \nauthorized local state agency for processing MSW.  Waste treatment fees will be \ndetermined, based either on a competitive bidding process to be conducted by the \nlocal government or through negotiations.  \n\n                                                \n12 ADB.  2015.

The direct loan will be provided \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n19. \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nThere is an increasing demand from the market for ADB to support decentralized PPPs to \n20. \ndeliver  much  needed  municipal  infrastructure  in  Viet  Nam.  The  project  is  designed  to  provide \nfinancing support for multiple WTE subprojects that are often too small, too costly to finance and \ntime-consuming for ADB or international banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. As one of the \nfirst municipal level PPPs, the project features a strong model for private sector participation. This \nencourages, with multi-faceted demonstration effects, the private sector to invest in WTE projects \nbeyond immediate project interventions. First, the project will support the transfer of technology \nand  technical  expertise  to  effectively  address  urban  waste  management  problems  effectively. \nSecond, it will encourage other private sector participants to invest in WTE projects using clean \ntechnologies. Third, the project will demonstrate a new mechanism to provide a long-term, reliable \nsolution  to  address  MSW  problems,  which  is  applicable  to  other  primary  and  secondary \nmunicipalities across Viet Nam. \n  \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n21. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  As  the  proposed  ADB  investment  is  not  earmarked  for  any  specific \nsubprojects,  the  requirement  for  general  corporate  finance  projects  will  apply.  A  qualified  and \nexperienced external expert conducted a corporate audit of CEIL\u2019s environmental, health, safety, \nand  social  policies,  procedures,  and  operations. The  audit recommended  corrective actions to \nensure that procedures and operations across all subproject business activities are adequate and \ncomply  with  national  laws,  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  other  social  requirements. \nFollowing  recommended  corrective  actions,  CEIL  will  update  its  corporate  environmental  and \nsocial  management  systems  satisfactory  to  ADB  such  that  it  is  applicable  to  the  company\u2019s \noperations  in  Viet  Nam  before  the  first  disbursement  for  the  financing  of  the  subprojects.  The \ninstitutional capacity and commitment of CEIL to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental \nimpacts are deemed adequate.  \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nThe  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts of  the  project  have been  identified  and \n22. \neffective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts can be \nwell mitigated as incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans to be prepared by CEIL to meet \nnational and international requirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. CEIL has proven \ncapacity  to  identify,  mitigate,  and  manage  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks \nassociated with its subprojects in the PRC; and will ensure this capacity is in place in Viet Nam. \nADB will ensure that CEIL employs rigorous subproject screening and categorization procedures \nto all identified subprojects to ensure that classification is in accordance with ADB categorization \nrequirements  and  processed  in  accordance  with  Safeguard  Requirements  1\u20133  before  ADB \nfunding.  CEIL  will  report  annually  to  ADB  on  its  subproject  portfolio  environmental  and  social \nmanagement systems\u2019 performance and semiannually for WTE subprojects as required. \n \nCEIL  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \n23. \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.15 CEIL  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  compliance  with  such  laws,  and  (ii)  the \nmeasures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nCEIL follows the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards16, and its \n24. \nannual  report \nits  subsidiaries.  CEIL\u2019s  2016 \nSustainability  Report  notes  that  males  dominate  the  energy  and  engineering  sector.  The \ncompany,  nevertheless,  pays  attention  to  equal  opportunity  in  employment  and  remuneration. \nCEIL safeguards rights enshrined in laws in the PRC that protect maternity and paternity leave, \nanti-discrimination, and unfair dismissal. About 24% of CEIL employees are women. In 2016, 14% \nof  senior  management  were  women  while  28%  of  middle  management  were  women.  The \nremuneration ratio between female and male employees at senior management level was 1.08, \nbut drops to 0.90 at middle management level. Women on average undertook 11.5 more hours \nof  training  per  year  than  men  in  2016.  CEIL\u2019s  performance  indicates  that  it  promotes  gender \nequality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  in  its  subsidiary  operations.  The  Human  Resources \nDepartment at the CEIL corporate level and at the subproject level in Viet Nam is responsible for \nensuring gender equality in operations. In Viet Nam, each subproject is required to follow the Law \non Gender Equality (No. 73/2006/QH11). \n \nB. \n\nincludes  gender-disaggregated  data \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nfrom \n\n25. \nCEIL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
