The buildup\nof  vulnerabilities  stemmed  from  excessive  reliance  on  bank\nfinancing, weak corporate and financial regulation, including poor\ncompliance  with  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  and\ninadequate  disclosure  of  financial  information.  These\ndevelopments are inevitable if enforcement and governance at\nthe regulator level are weak. Despite the fact that the Philippines\nwithstood the Asian financial crisis relatively well, its financial and\ncorporate structures continue to make it vulnerable to external\nshocks. This vulnerability stems from the uneven application of\ngood governance standards and lack of risk diversification in the\nfinancial  market.  Indeed,  the  Philippines  exhibits  a  very  high\ndependence on bank financing and has not been able to develop\nsufficient levels of financial intermediation through its nonbank\nsector.\nTo lay the foundation for a strong and robust financial sector, the\nGovernment  needs  to  launch  broad-based  financial  and\ncorporate  governance  reforms,  including  (i) strengthening  the\ngovernance  and  enforcement  capacity  of  the  regulators,\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Bangko Sentral\nng  Pilipinas  (BSP);  (ii)  modernizing  the  securities  market;\n(iii) introducing more transparency in market transactions; and\n(iv) encouraging  enforcement  of  rules  and  regulations.  These\nreforms are critical to meet the challenges of growing volatility\nfrom  a  weak  stock  exchange,  competitive  pressures  from\ntechnological innovation, as well as globalization and integration\nof financial markets.\nObjective and The  Program  will  support  the  process  of  capital  formation\nScope through improved corporate governance in the nonbank financial\nservices sector. The key components of Phase I are\n(i)  enhancing and strengthening the governance of\nSEC by (a) allowing SEC greater administrative,\noperational,  and  financial  autonomy;  and\n(b) enhancing  monitoring  and  enforcement\ncapacity;\n(ii)  modernizing  the  governance  and  regulatory", "iii\nstructure of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)\nby  (a)  developing  arrangements  for  PSE  to\nstrengthen  its  governance  during  the  transition\nperiod, (b) restructuring and demutualizing PSE;\n(c) enhancing self-regulatory organization (SRO)\nreporting,  and  (d) developing  arrangements  for\neffective regulation of PSE;\n(iii)  strengthening market oversight, compliance, and\nenforcement  by  (a)  developing  market\ngovernance,  (b)  strengthening  prudential\nregulation  of  nonbank  financial  institutions,\n(c) preventing misconduct and market abuse, and\n(d)  improving  financial  management  and\ngovernance by strengthening financial disclosure\nmonitoring; and\n(iv)  facilitating  diversification  and  innovation  in\ncorporate  financing  by  (a)  developing  a  policy,\nregulatory,  and  taxation  framework  for  the\ncorporate  bond  market;  and  (b) enhancing\ninstitutional  investors\u2019  participation  to  augment\nmarket liquidity.\nPhase II will consist of policy actions based on the Agenda for\nPhase II Dialogue. These actions, when agreed between the\nGovernment  and  ADB,  may  form  the  basis  of  future  ADB\nassistance to the Government in the nonbank financial sector.\nThe Agenda for Phase II Dialogue includes the following Core\nTopics\n(i)  implementing demutualization of PSE;\n(ii)  strengthening market regulation;\n(iii)  strengthening  market  governance  and\ncompliance; and\n(iv)  facilitating  diversification  and  innovation  in\ncorporate financing.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Category C\nAssessment\nThe ADB Loan\nLoan Amount A  loan  of  $75  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s\nand Terms (ADB\u2019s) ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s\nLIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee\nof 1.0 percent; and conversion options that may be exercised in\naccordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan", "iv\nRegulations, and ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines; and other terms\nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The loan\nclosing date is 31 December 2002.\nProgram Period The Phase I of the Program is three years (1998-2001). The loan\n            and Tranching will be released in one tranche, which will be made available\nupon loan effectiveness.\nExecuting The Department of Finance (DOF) will be the Executing Agency\nAgency for the NFG Program and SEC will be the Implementing Agency.\nSEC  will  set  up  a  coordinating  committee  headed  by  the\nChairperson  of  SEC  and  comprising  representatives  from\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Bureau of Treasury, DOF, National\nEconomic  and  Development  Authority,  PSE,  SEC,  and  the\nCapital Market Development Council that consists of members\nfrom  business  and  industry  associations.  ADB  will  also  be  a\nmember of this committee to oversee progress on Phase II of the\nreform program.\nProcurement The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange\ncosts of items produced and procured in ADB member countries\n(other  than  items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and\nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The\nGovernment  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports\nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the\nloans for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the\nuse  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s certification.\nCounterpart The  Government  will  utilize  local  currency  counterpart  funds\nFunds generated  by  the  loan  to  meet  program  expenditures  and\nassociated costs of reform and to help maintain current levels of\nsocial expenditures. The structural adjustment costs for Phase I\nstem from restructuring SEC, administrative reforms linked to\ncomputerization of SRO, monitoring systems in SEC and PSE,\nand demutualization costs already borne by SEC and PSE.\nTechnical Assistance The advisory TA of $1 million will strengthen market governance\nby developing (i) an effective SRO framework to address the\npotential  conflicts  of  interest  in  PSE\u2019s  newly  demutualized\nownership structure; (ii) SEC capacity to investigate and enforce\nmarket rules; (iii) an efficient management information system\nand staff training in the use of these systems; and (iv) accounting\nand auditing skills and standards. The TA will be financed from\nthe  Asian  Currency  Crisis  Support  Facility  funded  by  the\nGovernment of the Japan. It is estimated that about 22 person-\nmonths of international and 16 domestic consulting services will\nbe required.  All consultants will be engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  recruiting  domestic\nconsultants.", "v\nRisks and Safeguards The Program faces four major risks. First, the widening fiscal\ndeficit and growing nonperforming loans of the banking sector\ncould  disrupt  macroeconomic  stability  or  exacerbate  banking\nsector  fragility.  Recognizing  this,  the  new  Government  has\nindicated its resolve to adopt more fiscal dicpline and launch tax\nreforms to support macroeconomic stability. At the same time,\nthe Government is taking steps to deal with the weaknesses of\nthe banking sector.\nSecond, reforms in the nonbank financial sector PSE critically\ndepend  on  the  support  of  the  private  sector  including  the\nmembers  of  PSE.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  have  wider\nconsultations  to  evolve  consensus  among  the  different\nstakeholders  and  to  take  advance  actions  to  ensure  that\ndemutualization of PSE is realized.\nThird,  effective  Program  implementation  is  dependent  upon\ndeveloping  capacities  across  the  nonbank  financial  sector.\nIncreasing the skills of regulators, accountants, and auditors is\nnecessary if regulations and standards are to be enforced and\ncomplied  with.  The  Program  has  introduced  a  wide-ranging\ncapacity  building  element  in  the  TA  to  SEC.  In  addition,  the\nProgram supports the introduction of a more competitive salary\nstructure for SEC to retain qualified staff to mitigate this risk.\nFourth, reliance on enactment of legislation has proven to be\ndifficult  in  the  context  of  the  Philippines.  The  Program  has\nfocused on ensuring that current market regulations, if found\nsatisfactory,  are  adequately  enforced.  If  improvements  in\nregulations are required, alternatives to legislative action will be\nexplored through rules and administrative orders. In addition, up-\nfront compliance on all actions requiring legislation was required to\naddress possible delays in Program implementation.", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Nonbank Financial Governance (NFG) Program.\nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance for Strengthening Regulatory and\nMarket Governance, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority\ndelegated to me by the Board, shall approve the technical assistance.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The  Philippines  withstood  the  Asian  financial  crisis  well,  but  faced  renewed  and\nformidable  challenges  in  2000  as  economic  management  and  governance1  steadily\ndeteriorated. Economic decision making came to a virtual standstill in late 2000 following public\nscrutiny of corruption scandals in both the banking sector and capital markets. Growing political\nuncertainty combined with stock market vulnerabilities led to a sharp decline in the peso and\nstock market indices to historic lows, and triggered slippages in fiscal deficit targets. Attempts to\ncounteract the weakness in the exchange rate by monetary tightening led to high interest rates\nthat generated more economic instability and uncertainty.\n3. Nevertheless, the Philippines showed remarkable resilience in withstanding both the\nregional crisis of 1997 and the subsequent political turmoil that gripped the country throughout\n2000. The new millenium, however, brings with it renewed economic promises and prospects.\nSupported by people power, the country witnessed its second peaceful democratic transition\nfollowing the takeover by Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the office of the President\non 20 January 2001. Rebuilding investor and public confidence in the economic and political\nsystem has been at the forefront of the President\u2019s economic agenda. Recent political events\nhave  brought  some  degree  of  economic  and  financial  stability.  However,  stock  market\nvulnerabilities continue to reflect the underlying weakness in economic fundamentals, lack of\ninvestor confidence in a thin and weakly governed stock exchange, and the adverse effects of\nrecent exuberance and turmoil in the world stock markets.\n4. The primary challenge facing the new Government is to introduce effective economic\nand political governance and management. The new administration has been swift to recognize\nthe urgency of the task and has indicated its resolve to rebuild the economy by (i) instilling\nmacroeconomic discipline; (ii) developing strong and robust financial markets; (iii) refocusing on\npoverty reduction; and (iv) promoting a culture of rule of law, accountability, efficiency, and\nentrepreneurship.\n5. The medium-term economic framework of the Government integrates the objectives of\nthe Post-Program Monitoring agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) finalized in\nApril 2001. IMF had established a $1.4 billion standby credit facility under a Memorandum of\nEconomic and Financial Policies in 1998. The Government was able to draw over $1 billion on\nthis facility, but it waived the final tranche of approximately $336 million as it felt that it would not\nbe able to meet the fiscal targets and structural reform benchmarks agreed upon with IMF.\nCurrently, the Government is taking steps to curb the growth in the fiscal deficit within the Post-\nProgram Monitoring framework of IMF.\n6. Despite political disruptions, the new Government stated its commitment to stimulating\ngrowth by addressing long-term structural issues and constraints. This would, however, only be\n                                                          \n1  Governance refer to accountability, predictability, participation, and transparency.", "2\npossible if it is able to launch an effective strategy for resource mobilization in both the public and\nprivate sectors. On the public sector side, the fiscal distress has called for renewed attention to\nreforms in domestic taxation. However, the private sector will need to meet the bulk of resource\nrequirements  through  improved  financial  intermediation.  Recognizing  this,  the  Government\nlaunched several initiatives to support a stronger and more robust banking system and to broaden\nand deepen the capital markets since the onset of the crisis in late 1997. These measures have\nyielded mixed results.\n7. Today, the Philippines has one of the most independent central banks, Bangko Sentral ng\nPilipinas (BSP), in the region, and has developed an effective monetary management system.\nWith the support of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), BSP has led a complex\nand wide-scale bank-restructuring program over the past year. This has involved closure of one\nbank, merger of four of the larger banks into two banks, and merger of two smaller banks into the\ncountry\u2019s largest bank. In addition, the Philippine National Bank (PNB) required P10 billion liquidity\nassistance from the PDIC in 2000. To enhance the soundness of the banking system, BSP has\ntaken additional steps to (i) limit a bank\u2019s transactional capacity; (ii) require regular reporting of\ndelinquent and restructured loans; (iii) introduce higher statutory capital and bad loan provisioning;\nand (iv) require bank disclosure on interest rates, nonperforming loans (NPLs), and higher quality\nreporting standards, etc.\n8. The  financial  markets  were  buffeted  by  the  sharp  withdrawal  of  capital  from  the\nPhilippines,  the  subsequent  peso  depreciation,  and  the  BW  Resources2  scandal  involving\nallegations of stock price manipulation by a number of brokers, followed by allegations of\npolitical interference in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations. These\ndevelopments  created  an  atmosphere  that  eroded  both  investor  confidence  and  the  gains\nachieved in financial markets in the mid-1990s. Market capitalization went from the 1996 precrisis\nlevel of P2,122 billion to P1,251 billion in 1997 before recovering to P2,578 billion by end-2000.\n9. It is against this backdrop that the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nagreed  to  broaden  and  deepen  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector,\ncomplementing and building on the reforms initiated under the Capital Market Development\nProgram (CMDP) loan in 1995.3 The proposed NFG Program will support broader and deeper\nreforms in the nonbank financial sector. With this objective, ADB approved TA4 to the nonbank\nfinancial sector in 1999. This TA complemented bilateral assistance primarily from the  United\nStates Agency for International Development (USAID).\n10. The  proposed  NFG  Program  was  formulated  based  on  (i)  lessons  learned  from\nimplementing the CMDP, (ii) economic and sector work launched between 1998 and 2000,\n(iii) the findings and recommendations of the ADB TA (footnote 4), and (iv) the consensus in\nboth ADB and the Government on the need to enhance financial market governance. Extensive\npolicy dialogue has been maintained with the Government over the past two years. ADB fielded\na Reconnaissance Mission in August 1999 and a Fact-Finding Mission5 in October 2000 to\nreach an understanding with the Government on the objectives and scope of the proposed\nProgram. The development policy letter, the policy matrix, and the agenda for Phase II dialogue\nof the NFG Program are in Appendix 1. The program framework is in Appendix 2.\n                                                          \n2  This company was renamed Fairmont Holdings, Inc. in 2000.\n3 Loan 1363-PHI: Capital Market Development Program, for $150 million, approved on 22 August 1995.\n4  TA 3245-PHI: Nonbank Financial Sector Development, for $2 million, approved on 25 August 1999.\n5  The  Mission  comprised  N.  Chakwin,  Mission  Leader,  Senior  Financial  Economist;  A.  Malmstrom,  Financial\nEconomist; and E. Chen, Young Professional.", "3\nIII. THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA. Government Development Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n11. The Government\u2019s economic strategy and plans, articulated in the revised New Medium-\nTerm  Philippine  Development  Plan:  2001-2004,  advocate  adoption  of  a  sustainable\ndevelopment path anchored by economic growth with social equity. Stated objectives include\nreducing  the  incidence  of  poverty,  improving  employment  rates,  and  stabilizing  prices.  To\nachieve these goals, a development program was launched to raise basic social indicators,\nimprove access to basic services, and increase agricultural productivity and diversification.\nComplementing these efforts, the Government aims to establish a globally competitive industry\nsector  based  on  further  trade  liberalization,  and  enhanced  technology  in  the  industrial\nenvironment.6 Adherence to a fiscal stabilization program is critical to allow for adequate growth\nin public investment and to avoid crowding out the private sector. Concurrently, the Government\nneeds to revive private savings and investments by strengthening and diversifying the financial\nintermediation process and by promoting the expansion of equity and debt markets.\n12. The Government adopted a broad-ranging privatization program starting in 1992. The\nobjective was to generate revenue, stimulate capital markets, and introduce greater economic\nefficiency. Privatization proceeds fell significantly short of the P22 billion target in 2000. To\ngenerate resources, the Department of Finance (DOF) issued PROgress bonds in August 2000.\nThese  bonds  allowed  investors  to  swap  the  bonds  for  shares  of  companies,  or  the  cash\nequivalent of state assets being privatized. The 5-year bonds have a fixed coupon rate of 13.9\npercent per annum payable every quarter. Among the state corporations in which shares are\nbeing auctioned are Manila Electric Co. (Meralco), the Philippines National Construction Corp,\nthe Philippines National Oil Co. \u2013 Energy Development Corp., IBC Channel 13, Food Terminal,\nInc., Philippine Postal Corp., and the Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Corp. In addition, ADB is\nassisting in privatizing the National Power Corporation. The proceeds from the privatization\nprogram will generate revenues to ease budgetary pressures (para. 22).\n13. Economic recovery was notable in early 2000 after a significant slowdown in real gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth during 1997 and 1998. The impact of the regional financial\ncrisis was compounded by a decline in agricultural production because of drought conditions\naccompanying El Ni\u00f1o and later the typhoons related to the La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon. To mitigate\nthe shock, the Government adopted measures to improve liquidity management, stabilize the\npeso,  and  strengthen  the  financial  system.  Supporting  the  drive  toward  better  economic\nmanagement, the Government enacted critical pieces of legislation during 2000:\n(i)  Securities Regulation Code (SRC), which elevates the role and power of SEC\u2013\nconsistent  with  the  proposed    Program\u2013in  overseeing  and  regulating  market\nactivity;\n(ii)  General Banking Act, which includes provisions to align rules and regulations\nwith international standards and guidelines;\n(iii)  Retail Trade Liberalization Act, which permits foreign ownership of local retail\nstores, with capital of more than $2.5 million; and\n(iv)  Electronic  Commerce  Act,  which  provides  a  legal  foundation  for  electronic\ntransactions  and  introduces  penalties  for  computer  hacking  and  piracy.\nImplementing guidelines are being drafted with a view to incorporating guidelines\nfor securities transactions and electronic banking.\n                                                          \n6  TA 3345-PHI: Strengthen Export Competitiveness, for $1 million, approved on 17 December 1999.", "4\n14. In addition, the Government plans to (i) strengthen fiscal management by launching tax\nreforms and confining public expenditure, and (ii) stabilize prices, interest rates, and the peso.\nThe banking sector, restructured in the early 1990s, initially appeared to weather the Asian\nfinancial  crisis  relatively  well.  However,  persistent  economic  instability  has  resulted  in\ndeterioration in asset and portfolio quality, and stagnation in new lending and credit growth. The\nGovernment and BSP have taken a number of steps to encourage bank consolidation, raise\nminimum capital and provisioning requirements, and introduce a moratorium on bank branching\nand upgrading of licenses. Mergers have occurred or been announced between the PCI Bank\nand Equitable Banking Corporation, and Bank of the Philippine Islands and Far East Bank and\nTrust Company; and acquisition of Asian Bank and Philbanking Corporation by Global Bank, a\nsubsidiary of Metrobank.\n15. BSP has started a program to improve internal systems and procedures, and strengthen\nbanking  supervision  practices.  Under  the  new  program,  BSP  introduced  a  systemic  failure\ncontingency  plan,  issued  further  guidelines  for  prompt  corrective  action,  stepped  up  on-site\ninspections, and improved coordination between BSP and PDIC in resolving distressed banks. In\naddition, BSP is now monitoring bank groups on a consolidated basis and has strengthened early\nwarning systems to detect banking weaknesses. SEC and BSP are working on a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (MOU) to improve the monitoring of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), which\nare affiliates or subsidiaries of banks. Steps are under way to implement the new real time gross\nsettlement  (RTGS)  system,  which  will  facilitate  central  bank  clearing  and  settlement  of  all\npayments. The RTGS system will support a true delivery versus payment system and thereby\nreduce risks in payment, clearing, and settlement. The final tests for the RTGS system are\nexpected to be completed and the system to be fully on-line by the end of 2001.\n16. The most far-reaching reform in the banking sector is the enactment of the General\nBanking  Act  2000.  This  law  (i)  mandates  banks  to  meet  capital  adequacy  in  line  with\ninternational standards; (ii) allows foreign ownership of a local bank to be raised from 30 percent\nto 40 percent of the voting stock, and under certain conditions, up to a maximum of 100 percent;\n(iii) authorizes  BSP  to  conduct  regular  investigations  to  determine  whether  a  bank  or  its\naffiliates, are conducting business in an unsound manner; and (iv) restores the power of the\nMonetary Board to remove or suspend directors and officers involved in misconduct.\nB.  Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n17. A combination of factors affected economic performance in the Philippines during 2000.\nThe most significant were the persistent political uncertainty, weak economic management, and\nregional vulnerabilities. Despite these disruptions, economic recovery continued as real GDP\ngrew by 4.2 percent in 2000 compared with 3.7 percent in 1999. Economic growth in 2000 was\nsupported by agricultural growth, boosted by favorable weather conditions, and a 5.6 percent\nrise in manufacturing. The industry sector, however, has remained sluggish due to a slowdown\nin construction.\n18. The manufacturing sector continues to be plagued by weakening corporate profitability\n(declining by 25-40 percent in 2000) as a result of higher interest rates, import and energy costs,\nand lower demand. Philippine companies with foreign currency obligations have been facing\nsteadily higher principal and interest payments in peso terms. These costs have hit company\nearnings and contributed to declines in the debt service capacity of corporations. As a result of the\nrise in operating costs and debt obligations, a number of companies filed requests with SEC for", "5\nrelief from debt service obligations in 1999 and 2000. In addition, many companies postponed\nnew projects, thus constraining industrial production and contributing to growth of unemployment.\n19. The unemployment rate in the Philippines has averaged over 10 percent from 1999 to\n2000. This is 2-3 times the rate in other countries of the Association of South East Asian\nNations  (ASEAN)  during  the  same  period.  Although  the  unemployment  rate  reached  11.2\npercent in 2000, employment generation was strong during the 1990s relative to neighboring\nASEAN countries. However, job creation has not been fast enough to absorb labor and reduce\nunemployment, as the labor force continues to grow by about 2.5 percent annually. Rising\nproductivity and stable manufacturing employment levels indicate that there has been little labor\nshedding as a result of the crisis and lingering economic problems. Maintaining higher growth\nlevels, and keeping pace with the population growth will be pivotal to reducing unemployment in\na long-term sustainable manner.\n20. Performance in the real sector was overshadowed by the growing fiscal distress in 2000,\nas the national budget deficit reached P136 billion (3.9 percent of gross national product [GNP])\n\u2013 more than double the IMF target of P62.5 billion (1.8 percent of GNP). Budgetary pressures\ncontinued throughout the year as tax revenues fell short of budget requirements. The budgetary\nshortfall was attributed to a weak tax base,7 poor collection systems and procedures, and the\nGovernment\u2019s inability to realize the proceeds from the stalled privatization program (para. 12).8\nPublic spending was to some extent tightened. Total revenue/GNP fell by 3.3 from 1996 to\n2000, while public spending/GNP rose by 0.4 over this period. To meet the budgetary financing\ngap, the Government borrowed from the domestic and overseas markets and drew down funds\nfrom the standby credit facility under an IMF program outlined in a 1998 Memorandum of\nEconomic  and  Financial  Policies.  Budgetary  pressures  continued  to  make  monetary\nmanagement difficult as Government borrowings rose to 5.7 percent of GDP and induced\ninterest rate pressures. The addition of new Government contingent liabilities indicates that debt\nservice levels equivalent to 31 percent of budgetary expenditures will remain a Government\nconcern.\n21. The external current account surplus grew to $9 billion in 2000. This represents a 23\npercent growth over the 1999 level and can principally be attributed to export growth, led by\nelectronics (approximately 58 percent of exports). Additional factors include the slowdown in\nimports  and  weak  domestic  demand.  Despite  the  buildup  of  the  external  current  account\nsurplus, the balance of payments position in 2000 was in deficit on an aggregate basis due to\nthe capital account. A primary factor was the reemergence of a net outflow of portfolio equity\ninvestments ($335 million)9 slightly lower than the 1997 crisis-related outflows ($406 million).\nNet foreign direct investment was more stable recovering to $2.1 billion, 10 percent higher than\n1999 levels. By year-end, it was evident that Government access to credit from multilateral and\nbilateral sources, as well as recourse to commercial credit had dwindled significantly during the\nyear.\n22. Banking  sector  problems  have  also  compounded  difficulties  in  sustaining  economic\nrecovery. Domestic commercial banks continued to weaken, as growth of bank deposits and\ncredit declined. Banking sector NPLs more than doubled from 7.4 percent in 1998 to almost 20\n                                                          \n7  Tax collection efficiency declined from 17 percent in 1997 to under 14 percent in 2000.\n8 Almost 24 percent of the slippage in the budget deficit in 2000 occurred because of the nonrealization of\nprivatization proceeds.\n9 In 1996, portfolio equity investment was close to $2 billion.", "6\npercent in 2001.10 The steady decline in bank asset quality is attributable to a variety of factors:\n(i) interest pressures, (ii) more stringent reclassification of loans in the newly merged banks, and\n(iii) a slowdown in asset growth. In addition, the Government\u2019s plan to privatize PNB11 has been\ndelayed. This delay in restructuring PNB has resulted in deposit withdrawals and continuing\ngrowth in NPLs. To avert a crisis, the Government intervened to support the deteriorating\nbalance sheet. Government support has involved liquidity assistance of P10 billion from PDIC\nand a P15 billion loan from BSP to purchase NPLs from PNB. The assistance constitutes the\nlargest bailout in Philippines banking history and was provided as PNB represents 7 percent of\nbanking sector assets. To reduce NPLs, the Government is considering a number of proposals,\namong them transferring NPLs to an asset management company or banks swapping debt for\nequity in corporations.\n23. In the wake of the global slowdown, the Philippines like other regional economies is\nexperiencing slower-than-expected growth. Investor confidence has not yet been restored and\nthe peso has remained below P50=$1. As of October 2001, the central bank borrowing and\nlending rates have been reduced to 8.75 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Real GDP is\nprojected to grow by 2.5-3.0 percent in 2001, given the lingering domestic uncertainties, weak\nexternal environment, and structural issues facing the economy. The main domestic challenge\nfacing the Philippines is how to stop the deterioration in public finances and keep budgetary\npressures within manageable limits. The Government budget for 2001 projects a deficit of around\n4.0 percent. The fall in revenues over the past four years, together with peso depreciation, have\nincreased public sector debt to almost 66 percent of GNP. While keeping control on the budget\ndeficit, the Government plans to pursue a tight monetary policy to bring down the inflation rate.\nWith  the  July  year-on-year  inflation  rate  reaching  6.8  percent  (the  year-end  level  for  2000),\nmaintaining price stability may prove challenging in the second half of the year.\n24. Strengthening the banking sector is critical, given that the NPLs of some domestic banks\nhave surpassed BSP\u2019s expected peak of 19-20 percent. Given the stress in the sector and the\ninterest  and  exchange  rate  environment,  commercial  banks  have  maintained  high  capital\nadequacy ratios averaging over 15 percent.12 In addition, a few episodes over the past year of\nruns on bank deposit resulted in large withdrawals from several banks, indicating wavering\ndepositor confidence in the banking system. Authorities were able to quickly contain the systemic\nrisks posed by these withdrawals through a combination of liquidity support and new capital\ninjections  by  existing  owners.  However,  there  is  some  risk  that  weak  banks  might  require\nadditional liquidity support and thereby complicate monetary policy.\n25. The external sector is becoming more vulnerable, with the value of exports for the first\neight months of 2001 declining by 13 percent. This follows growth of 9 percent in 2000 and 19\npercent in 1999. This is especially important in the context of the Philippines where there is a high\ndependence on markets in the United States and Japan. Despite the rise in capital outflows, the\nPhilippines does not face significant debt servicing pressures in the near future. Debt service\npayments are projected at 17 percent of exports of goods and services in 2001; reserves cover\n260 percent of short-term debt (or 4.2 months of imports); and the rollover risk for interbank credit\n                                                          \n10The international banks nonperforming loans have remained steady at about 3 percent while those of domestic\nbanks have continued to grow , averaging over 25 percent, and those of the Philippine National bank (PNB) over\n30 percent.\n11This was a condition for disbursing the remaining tranches of the World Bank: Banking Sector Reform Loan, of\n$300 million, approved in 1998. The loan was cancelled because the rehabilitation of PNB will require a longer time\nand more sustained effort than were originally anticipated.\n12 The capital adequacy ratio of two universal banks (one was PNB) has dipped below the statutory norm of\n10 percent since end-2000 (although both have been above 8 percent).", "7\nlines appears limited, given that net foreign liabilities of private commercial banks have declined\nfrom $6 billion in 1997 to $3.5 billion in 2000. Finally, the Government\u2019s commitment to improve\nthe business climate was affirmed as it recently enacted the anti-money laundering law in line with\nthe Financial Action Task Force 40 recommendations.\nIV. THE SECTOR\nA. Background and Recent Performance\n1.  Overview of the Nonbank Financial Sector\n26. The nonbank financial sector is a major source of savings and supplier of funds to the\nprivate sector. NBFIs provide a wide range of financial services: lending, investing, or placement\nof equity and debt instruments. Almost 70 percent of nonbank financial sector assets are\ngenerated from contractual savings institutions and 30 percent from investment houses handling\nunderwriting  and  money  market  operations,  financing  companies  engaged  in  lending  and\nleasing activities, and independent fund managers managing mutual funds.13 The nonbank\nfinancial sector includes securities brokers and dealers, financing companies, and investment\nhouses (Table 1). NBFIs act in the capacity of a fiduciary managing the money of clients\nthrough  investment  companies  (mutual  funds)  and  pre-need  companies.  The  assets  of\nnumerous (over 6,000) neighborhood lending investors and pawnshops account for less than\n1 percent of financial sector assets. As many of these small businesses are affiliated with banks\nor financing companies, it is anticipated that they will face pressures to merge or liquidate\nassets. The SEC has already started to issue rules to consolidate lending investors.\nTable 1:  Selected Nonbank Financial Sector Participants\n(1998-2000)\nTotal Assets\nType of Entity Number\n(P million)\nSecurities Brokers/Dealers 168 113,297a\nInvestment Houses 37 37,924a\n    With Quasi Bank License 7 32,935a\nMutual Fund Managers 20 6,129\n    Stock Funds 6 1,516\n    Balanced Funds 10 1,703\n    Bond Funds 4 2,909\nFinancing companies 177 55,352\n    With Quasi Bank License 7 13,720\nPre-need Companies 52 130,303\n                  a Based on audited financial statements.\n    Sources:  Securities and Exchange Commission and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.\n                                                          \n13 At present, the country has over 7,000 nonbank financial institutions.", "8\n2. Regulatory Framework\n27. SEC  regulates  the  capital  market,  and  licenses  and  supervises  self-regulatory\norganizations  (SROs)14  including  Philippine  Stock  Exchange  (PSE),  the  Philippine  Central\nDepository, Inc. (PCDI), and the Securities Clearing Corporation of the Philippines (SCCP).\nSEC also oversees company registration and the conduct of market participants. BSP is also\ninvolved in supervising capital markets to the extent that bank subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nas investment houses and securities firms, operate in the capital market.\n28. Established in 1936, SEC derives its mandate, powers, and broad authority to regulate\nand supervise corporations, investment firms, and the securities industry from SRC, Presidential\nDecree 902-A, the Corporation Code, Investment Houses Law, the Investment Company Act,\nand the Financing Company Act and other statutes (Appendix 3).15 Supported by these laws,\nSEC serves as a collegial body with a governing board consisting of a full-time chairperson that\nis  the  chief  executive,  and  four  commissioners  who  coordinate  line  responsibilities.  The\nmembers of the Commission, appointed by the President of the Philippines for a seven-year\nterm, decide regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement matters on the basis of majority vote.\n29. BSP  supervises  all  nonbank  services  offered  by  banks  and  quasi  banks  (QB)16\nsubsidiaries and affiliates and other NBFIs authorized to engage in QB functions and other\nfiduciary investment management operations. Since many NBFIs regulated by SEC are the\nsubsidiaries or affiliates of banks, BSP and SEC need to develop more effective coordination in\nregulating and supervising of the nonbank financial sector.\n3. Market Institutions\na. The Stock Exchange\n30. The securities industry in the Philippines began with the opening of the Manila Stock\nExchange in 1927 and later the Makati Stock Exchange in 1963. The Philippine securities\nmarket was the most active in Asia until the 1970s, but witnessed a setback subsequently due\nto political and economic problems. In 1994, the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges were\nunified into the PSE (Appendix 4) to achieve uniform pricing of stocks and eliminate arbitrage. In\nthe process, PSE\u2019s two trading floors were linked electronically, enabling brokers and traders to\nexecute orders and clear transactions within the day.\n31. PSE is owned by its broker members, each of whom buys a seat entitling him/her to one\nvote at general meetings and to participate in its functions, services, and activities. A PSE seat\nis currently valued at P25 million, down from P80 million in 1996. A 15-member board of\ngovernors  has  traditionally  overseen  PSE  whose  administration  is  managed  by  the  PSE\npresident  who  is  concurrently  chief  executive  officer.  Two  board  members,  including  the\npresident, were required to be independent directors. Three additional independent directors\njoined the board in 1998 as a condition for obtaining a SRO license for PSE.\n32. In the three years prior to the Asian financial crisis, PSE was able to raise, on the\naverage, P35 billion in new capital through issues of equity securities. Despite a slowdown from\n                                                          \n14 An SRO is an industry organization developed to enforce fair, ethical, and efficient practices on the industry. Its\npowers and responsibilities are complementary to the oversight regulator.\n15 Appendix 5 contains the rules and regulations governing the nonbank financial sector.\n16 A quasi bank license entitles a financial intermediary to borrow funds from more than 20 lenders at any time, for\nrelending or related investment activity. BSP is no longer granting quasi bank licenses.", "9\n1993 to 1994 due to the Mexican crisis, PSE\u2019s market capitalization grew steadily and reached\nover P2 trillion in 1996. The secondary equities market was also active: in 1996 it ranked fifth in\nterms of turnover compared with its regional comparators and the stock index increased steadily\nover the six-year period up to end-June 1997.\nTable 2: Selected Stock Market Indicators\nItem 1997 1998 1999 2000\nCapitalization (billion pesos)a 1,251 1,374 1,938 2,578\n      (% gross domestic product) (51.6) (51.3) (64.7) (77.6)\nPhilippines Composite Index 1,869 1,969 2,143 1,495\n      (Peso, % change previous period) (-41.1) (5.4) (8.8) (-30.3)\n      ($, % change previous period) (-61.2) (8.3) (5.1) (-43.7)\nAverage daily trading volume 7.8 1.2 3.8 2.6\n       (million shares)\nNumber of listed companies 221 221 226 230\n       a  All indicators are for end of period.\n       Source: Philippines Stock Exchange.\n33. The regional financial crisis hit PSE substantially (Table 2). Prices of shares of Philippine\ncompanies listed on PSE fell significantly in 1997. The falling stock market and resultant heavy\nselling of Philippine equity securities by foreign investors induced exchange rate pressures and\naffected the foreign currency positions of financial institutions in the Philippines. The PSE\nComposite Index declined 45.8 percent in peso terms from 3,448 on 3 February 1997 to 1,870\non 29 December 1997, and continued to fall during most of 1998, reaching an historic low of\n1,082 on 11 September 1998. After partial recovery in late 1999 and early 2000, the PSE\nComposite Index continued to be quite volatile, declining to 1,534 on 30 June 2000. Stock\nmarket indicators steadily declined:\n(i)   Initial public offerings (IPOs) fell from P1 billion in 1998 to P756 million in 1999, and\nP560 million in 2000; and\n(ii)   Market  capitalization  increased  steadily  through  the  1990s,  peaking  in  1996  at\nP2,122 billion. In 1997, market capitalization fell to P1,251 billion but recovered in\nlate 2000 to P2,578 billion based on seven new listings, including the P9 billion IPO\nof  Sunlife  Financial  Services,  Inc.,  of  Canada  and  an  P8.5  billion  offering  of\nPhilippines Deposit Receipts by Global Telecom.\n34. PSE market capitalization is characterized by a high degree of concentration. The top 10\ncompanies account for about 60 percent of market capitalization and the top 50 companies for\nover 90 percent. The remaining 180 companies are not regularly traded and, often, no current\nprice  quotes  exist  for  their  stocks.  The  Ayala  Group  of  companies  dominates  the  market\naccounting for about 20 percent of the market capitalization.\n35. PSE operates two electronically linked exchange floors: Makati and Pasig (para. 30).\nSince November 1995, it has operated a single order-book using US MakTrade software to\nadopt the Unified Trading System. The system is considered efficient and transparent. PSE\nprovides  a  computerized,  exchange-based  trading  market  in  domestic  ordinary  shares,\npreferred shares, bonds, and warrants. The exchange trades 9:30 to 12:00 noon five days a\nweek. Equities are by far the most actively traded instruments. The turnover was P659 billion\nend-2000, close to the 1996 level.", "10\nb. Securities Clearing Corporation of the Philippines\n36. SCCP is a privately owned corporation authorized by SEC in 1998 to provide clearance\nand settlement services for trades executed on the PSE. SCCP is capitalized at P175 million,\nP50 million paid-up and P125 million callable capital. PSE owns 51 percent of SCCP shares\nand the remaining 49 percent are held by three Philippine commercial banks. Two of these\nbanks are designated as settlement banks.\n37. SCCP provides trade matching and confirmation, trade netting, settlement instructions,\nand a settlement guarantee for its members. The clearinghouse within PSE matches trades on\ntrade day plus 1 (T+1) based on data downloaded from the unified trading system. Broker\nconfirmations  are  recorded  on  T+2  based  on  returns  from  brokers  to  the  clearinghouse.\nDisputed trades are resolved through amendment of trade details, buying in, unwinding, or other\narrangements. Trades are netted on T+3 and brokers, the central depository, and the two\nsettlement banks are notified by the clearinghouse of the net cash and securities position for\npayment or transfer. On T+3 the settlement banks book the necessary credits and debits in the\ncash settlement accounts of the brokers, and the brokers execute transfers of securities through\ntransfer agents or directly to PCDI.\nc.  Philippine Central Depository, Inc.\n38. SEC granted PCDI a license in December 1996. PCDI services the securities industry by\nproviding securities safekeeping services and book entry settlement of trade. PCDI is a provider\nof  information  services  to  SCCP,  and  supports  the  needs  of  SCCP  in  carrying  out  its\nresponsibilities for securities transfers and cash settlement. The PCDI system links PSE and\nSCCP,  brokers,  custodians,  and  settlement  banks  together  under  one  information  and\naccounting system. PSE and the Bankers Association of the Philippines each own 32 percent,\nthe  Financial  Executives  Institute  of  the  Philippines  and  the  Development  Bank  of  the\nPhilippines each own another 10 percent. Industry associations own the remainder of PCDI.\n4. Key Market Participants\na.  Brokers and Dealers\n39. There are currently 184 securities brokers and dealers registered with SEC: of that\nnumber, 147 are active and 37 inactive. Of the active members, 120 are corporate members (of\nwhich 10 are subsidiaries or affiliates of banks) and 27 are individuals; 21 are foreign and 126\nlocal. The assets of securities brokers and dealers grew from P4.8 billion to P11.6 billion from 1992\nto 1996; however, the size and business of the securities industry remain small and volatile as\nprices of PSE-listed companies fell during the crisis period. The falling stock market and resultant\nheavy selling of Philippines equity securities by foreign investors exacerbated exchange rate\npressures and affected the foreign currency positions and value of inventories of financial\ninstitutions in the Philippines. At PSE, the top 20 securities brokers and dealers account for about\n90 percent of the business and most of the largest firms are foreign owned. However, the small\nstock brokerage firms whose volume and value of business are low have dominated the PSE\nboard of directors, carrying disproportionate influence in managing and administering PSE.", "11\nb.  Investment Houses\n40. At present, there are 44 investment houses;17 7 of them have QB licenses. Investment\nhouses are licensed by BSP; however, they register with SEC in order to perform their main\nfunction of underwriting. Over a five-year period ending in 1998, the assets of investment houses\ngrew from P10 billion to P56 billion and stagnated at around this level due to the slowdown in\nunderwriting and related capital market activities. Of the seven universal banks, four conduct\nunderwriting activities through an investment house subsidiary or affiliate and three underwrite\ndirectly. This raises questions of what policies and procedures are in place to segregate bank\nassets and mitigate the underwriting risk. Even if banks are licensed as underwriters they must\nestablish separate subsidiaries for the purpose of functioning as a PSE member securities broker-\ndealer. Hence, the three universal banks that do not have independent underwriting subsidiaries\nare not entitled to PSE membership. In addition to universal banks that play a role in underwriting,\nthere are 38 commercial banks some of which may engage in underwriting and stock brokering\nthrough subsidiaries and affiliates. At present, there are 10 subsidiaries or affiliates of commercial\nbanks that have PSE membership.\nc.  Financing Companies\n41. Financing companies provide loans, mortgages, financial leases, and other forms of\ncredit. There are 177 financing companies with 228 branch offices. Seven financing companies\nhave  QB  licenses  and  are  allowed  to  borrow  funds  by  issuing  negotiable  money  market\ninstruments such as commercial papers. Of the 170 financing companies without a QB license,\n19 are the subsidiaries or affiliates of commercial banks and 5 companies have dual licenses to\noperate as a finance company and an investment house. Assets of financing companies grew\nfrom P28.8 billion to P55.3 billion over 1992-2000. Non-QB financing companies contributed to\nthis growth and accounted for 80 percent of the total financing companies assets, while QB\nfinancing companies assets stagnated at P8.7 billion as they faced difficulties raising funding\nfrom markets and their bank affiliates.\n5. Nonbank Fiduciaries\na. Mutual Funds\n42. The Philippines permits two classes of investment companies: (i) open-end funds (i.e.,\nmutual funds) set up to continually offer new shares to the public, and (ii) closed-end funds that\noffer only a fixed number of shares determined at the time of the IPO. Closed-end funds are not\nredeemable at the option of the shareholder but rather trade like any other listed stock, with the\nprice determined on the basis of supply and demand. Of the 20 mutual open-ended funds in the\ncountry, 6 are stock funds, 10 balanced funds, and 4 bond funds. Two mutual funds are sponsored\nby banks and accounted for about one third of the industry\u2019s net assets of P3.3 billion as of end-\n2000.\n                                                          \n17 The larger investment houses act as underwriters and dealers in private money market instruments, government debt,\nlisted equity securities, and private placement of debt and equity instruments. Under SEC regulations, PSE members\nmay act as sales agents in the distribution of securities on behalf of universal banks or investment houses that\nunderwrite securities.", "12\nb.  Pre-Need Plans\n43. The pre-need industry is the country\u2019s predominant collective investment vehicle with\nover 200,000 sales agents throughout the Philippines. The industry has raised cumulative\nassets exceeding P130 billion as of end-1999. Pre-need plans have evolved from a financing\nadjunct of the funeral industry (memorial, burial, and cremation), to pension and education\nplans. The industry has moved from open-ended hedges against inflation to \u201cfixed value\u201d plans.\nTotal sales amounted to P31.1 billion in 1999 and P36.1 billion in 2000, or an increase of 16\npercent. Under the authority of the SRC, SEC will continue to regulate pre-need plans. The Pre-\nNeed Code legislation that will upgrade the supervision and reporting requirements of pre-need\ncompanies is pending in Congress.\n6.  The Accounting and Auditing Profession\n44. The Philippines maintains an elaborate legal, regulatory, and institutional framework to\noversee the development and practice of the accounting and auditing professions. The Revised\nAccountancy Law of 1975 governs accounting and auditing professional standards, and the\nProfessional  Regulation  Commission  (PRC)  regulates  over  40  professions,  including  the\naccountancy  profession.  PRC  is  under  the  administrative  supervision  of  the  Civil  Service\nCommission,  an  independent  agency  reporting  to  the  Office  of  the  President.  PRC  is\nresponsible for formulating policies, rules, and regulations for professional practices including\nsetting the minimum requirements for certified public accountants (CPA). In collaboration with\nthe  professional  regulatory  board  for  accounting,  the  Board  of  Accountancy  (BOA),  PRC\nconducts license examinations and periodic inspections to ensure enforcement and compliance\nwith  professional  standards.  PRC  also  issues  and  renews  licenses  for  professionals,\ninvestigates  and  adjudicates  complaints  and  cases  against  professionals,  and  supervises\naccredited  professional  organizations  such  as  the  Philippines  Institute  of  Certified  Public\nAccountants (PICPA). PRC and BOA are now positioning themselves to improve monitoring and\nenforcement of the quality and integrity of professional ethics, education, and standards, and to\nproactively participate in negotiations and implementation of the ASEAN Framework Agreement\non Services, and the World Trade Organization-General Agreement on Trade in Services.\na. Board of Accounting\n45. BOA comprises seven members who are nominated by PICPA and appointed by the\nPresident. In accordance with the Revised Accountancy Law of 1975 and subject to PRC\napproval, BOA is responsible for supervising and monitoring accountancy practices, developing\nrules  and  regulations,  setting  professional  and  ethical  standards,  administering  the  CPA\nexamination, and issuing CPA certificates. BOA also investigates violations of the Revised\nAccountancy of Law 1975 and, after due process, may suspend, revoke, or reissue registration\ncertificates. BOA\u2019s key mandates are to (i) improve the curriculum for accountancy education\nand the CPA examination system, (ii) revise the accountancy code of ethics and regulations for\nforeign  professionals,  and  (iii)    resolve  outstanding  legal  cases  and  obtain  International\nStandards Organization certification.\n46. To achieve these objectives, BOA implemented a coordinated work program with PICPA\nand  other  concerned  bodies  on  revising  the  accountancy  code  of  ethics,  enhancing  the\naccountancy curriculum, and developing programs that reflect technological advances in the\naccounting profession. The process of reviewing the Accountancy Law of 1975 and the Code of\nEthics for possible amendments is continuing.", "13\nb. Professional Integration\n47. PRC  accredited  PICPA  in  1973  as  the  association  responsible  for  integrating  all\nPhilippine CPAs by registering them as PICPA members. PRC has thus far registered 103,340\nCPAs as of December 2000, but not all are active (i.e. fee-paying) members of PICPA. In 1999,\nPICPA launched a push for compulsory CPA membership in PICPA. CPAs who were not PICPA\nmembers were given until 31 July 2000 to renew their respective registration certificates or face\nits cancellation. Under PICPA rules, all persons whose names appear in PRC\u2019s CPA Register\nshould be members of PICPA. On this basis, failure to maintain membership in PICPA can be\nsufficient cause for PRC to revoke CPA\u2019s registration certificate. PICPA further prepared a bill,\nrecently presented to Congress, that requires compulsory membership of professionals in their\nrespective accredited professional organizations.\nB. Constraints and Issues\n1. Weakness in SEC Structure and Governance\n48. SEC has a broad and strategic mandate to regulate the securities market. It is, however,\nsubject to oversight from DOF. Its rules and decisions can be subject to challenges in the\ncourts. It lacks financial autonomy, which impacts on its flexibility to meet this mandate. SEC\nfinancing remains a major obstacle to effective market regulation and enforcement. Fees and\ncharges collected by SEC (close to P1 billion in 1998) go to the Government\u2019s general revenue\nbudget. SEC is then given a budget allocation of around P140 million with salaries tied to the\ncivil service scale. The resource constraints have limited SEC\u2019s ability to modernize its internal\nsystems and controls and to function as an effective regulator of the securities market.\n49. Under the 1982 Revised Securities Act, SEC lacked a clear legal mandate and the\nhuman and financial resources to fully exercise its oversight powers and authorities over the\ncapital  market.  The  organizational  structure  of  SEC  was  restricted  and  outdated,  and\nencouraged overlapping administration and undersupervision of the securities markets. For\ninstance,  three  departments  handle  surveillance,  investigations,  and  enforcement  but  lack\neffective coordination among them. The Prosecutions and Enforcement Department took limited\nenforcement  actions,  while  the  Brokers  and  Exchanges  Department,  which  grants  broker\nlicenses, was overseeing license cancellations or suspensions. The Money Market Operations\nDepartment, which monitored investment houses, also would initiate investigations. Besides\nlegal impediments to reorganization, there was no legal protection for SEC staff acting to\ndischarge their regulatory functions and powers as regulators. SEC governance standards were\nconsiderably  short  of  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO)\nObjectives  and  Principles  for  a  securities  regulator.18  Restructuring  the  organization,\nintroducing information technology, and developing human resource capacity are critical for\nSEC to improve its market regulation.\n50. Despite organizational shortcomings under the Revised Securities Act, SEC started\ndrafting the rules for an effective regulatory framework for PSE to function as an SEC SRO.\nSEC needs to develop an MOU with PSE on specific aspects of market monitoring, particularly\nafter PSE is demutualized. However, under the CMDP, PSE transformed its legal and regulatory\nframework  to  operate  as  an  SRO,  but  there  were  no  effective  implementing  rules  and\nregulations (IRR) for the SRO. PSE has not fully developed its capacity to act as a frontline\nregulator  for  brokers,  dealers,  and  the  exchange  and  as  an  effective  supervisor  for  listed\n                                                          \n18 The full text of all IOSCO documents is available on its web site, www.IOSCO.org.", "14\ncompanies\u2019 compliance with PSE regulations and other rules. In addition, SEC has not been\neffective in its market oversight role of PSE. SEC continued to operate and regulate PSE as its\nstaff continued to exercise direct statutory and administrative controls rather than focus on\nbroad  market  monitoring  oversight.  In  implementing  the  full  disclosure  rules  and  SRO\nframework,  SEC  then  developed  an  overly  technical  and  backward-looking  approach  that\nprevented sufficient flexibility, and limited the creative development and nurturing PSE\u2019s SRO\nresponsibilities. Both PSE and SEC were unclear as to how SROs functioned, including the\nways  regulatory  and  oversight  responsibilities  would  be  shared.  In  view  of  these  issues,\neffective implementation of PSE\u2019s SRO status has been problematic. The SRO structure has\ncreated legal issues and contributed to a high degree of uncertainty about SEC\u2019s mandate to\nenforce SRO rules and led to disputes between SEC and PSE.\n51. SEC needs to reexamine its policy on PSE self-regulation. It needs to develop and\npublish a policy statement setting out oversight objectives and how SEC proposes to achieve\nthem. In addition, SEC needs to build its staff skills in market surveillance and enforcement.\nPrior to reorganization, almost 65 percent of SEC staff were involved in company registration,\nwhile  the  remainder  focused  on  SEC\u2019s  core  activities  of  prudential  regulation  of  financial\nservices institutions under its jurisdiction and market conduct in the securities industry. The SEC\nculture needs to change so that the majority of staff resources are directly involved in SEC core\nactivities while the remainder of the staff, about 20 percent, focus on company registration. To\nachieve this outcome SEC needs to take advantage of recent developments in information\ntechnology, and upgrade its monitoring and investigation capacity to allow it to analyze data\nsets in a relational and predictive way. Current record keeping and filing is not sufficient for\nadequate market regulation.\n2. Weak PSE Governance and Regulation\n52. The Philippines has been steadily increasing public ownership of companies through\nprivate and institutional investment and privatization of state-owned enterprises since the 1990s\n(para.  12),  and  it  has  facilitated  growth  in  the  equities  market.  However,  the  standards  of\ncorporate governance  still  remain  weak.  Under  the  CMDP,  PSE  introduced  three  additional\nindependent directors (para. 30) on the board of PSE to strengthen governance, and supported\nthe introduction of self-regulation.\n53. PSE  was  established  as  a  limited-liability  company  that  concentrated  on  providing\nservices  and  minimizing  costs  for  its  members,  rather  than  being  profit  driven.  Operating\nsurpluses of PSE have been used to cover losses from any unlikely system failures, or directed\ntoward  improving  systems  and  facilities,  market  development,  and  public  awareness  and\ninvestor  education.  PSE\u2019s  cooperative  governance  structure,  where  each  member  in  the\nmutually owned company is accorded an equal vote regardless of market share or volume of\nbusiness on PSE (para. 30), once served it well. It has, however, become more of a hindrance\nthan a benefit. PSE governance and its ability to implement policies and regulation is affected\nby the dominance of the smaller brokers and dealers who are overrepresented on PSE\u2019s board\nof directors.19 These smaller brokers have prevented listed companies and large players from\nhaving reasonable representation in market development and policy issues. The top 20 brokers\naccounting for 90 percent of business conducted on PSE (para. 39) have been trying to create a\nmore professional culture at PSE. The large brokers are seeking improvements in market\nquality and integrity, better rules, and better enforcement. While the smaller brokers prefer more\nlax  supervision,  large  brokers  have  supported  close  monitoring  of  market  trading,  strict\n                                                          \n19 PCR: PHI 21223: Capital Market Development Program, August 2000.", "15\nsupervision of capital adequacy rules, and implementation of delivery-versus-payment (DVP) in\nthe settlement system. Small brokers see these new systems, procedures, and regulations as\nunnecessary costs and often as impediments to profitable trading. Effective implementation of\nthese systems and procedures are required for PSE to become a member of the Federation\nInternationale  des  Bourses  de  Valeurs  (FIBV).20  Without  FIBV  accreditation,  foreign  and\ninstitutional investment would be severely restricted.\n54. SEC granted PSE a license to undertake self-regulation in 1998 (para. 27). However,\nimplementation of the SRO structure has been difficult as SEC and PSE failed to agree on\ncoregulation with shared responsibilities between the market regulator and the SRO. PSE\u2019s\nSRO privileges were suspended in March 2000 due to PSE\u2019s failure to maintain a satisfactory\ncompliance and enforcement department for direct supervision and monitoring of brokers and\ndealers. PSE regained its SRO status in late 2000 when it reconstituted its compliance and\nenforcement division and guaranteed SEC that it will strengthen its market monitoring systems.\nMore  work  needs  to  be  done  to  ensure  that  the  SRO  framework  is  fully  understood  and\noperates  as  an  efficient  and  cooperative  system.  An  additional  problem  to  effective  rule\nenforcement is PSE\u2019s listing and disclosure group and the compliance and surveillance group\nwho do not have operational procedures for rule enforcement. As a result, the processes and\ndecision-rules  are  not  uniformly  applied,  leading  to  inconsistency  and  uncertainty  and\nopportunities for market manipulation.\n3. Inadequate Compliance by Market Participants and Weak Enforcement by\nSEC\n55. Financial  reporting  and  market  transactions  in  the  Philippines  lack  consistency  in\nregulatory compliance, enforcement, and transparency. As a result, financial intermediaries\nperforming the same functions are regulated and supervised under different standards. Market\nparticipants take advantage of the application of different standards and engage in regulatory\narbitrage and market abuse. One of the major issues is the dichotomy between the regulation\nand supervision of the nonbank financial sector. While SEC regulates the nonbank financial\nsector,  some  NBFIs  are  supervised  by  BSP  (para.  29).  This  structure  has  evolved  as\ncommercial banks expanded their operations to handle securities functions and businesses\nthrough subsidiaries or affiliates, and universal banks were licensed to underwrite securities.\nBSP\u2019s role in supervising the underwriting activity of universal and commercial banks and SEC\u2019s\nrole  in  the  rest  of  the  securities  market  have  created  regulatory  fragmentation  and\nsegmentation. Both agencies have different priorities as reflected in their respective policies,\nrules and regulations, and record keeping and reporting requirements for their institutions.\nSimilar financial activities are regulated under different standards, resulting in uncertainties with\nrespect to compliance, regulatory costs, and protection of the public. To address this problem,\nsome regulators around the world have moved from an institutional to a functional approach\ntoward  regulation.  Under  this  framework  similar  activities  and  products  are  regulated  and\nsupervised uniformly, even where regulation or supervision is provided by different institutions.\nSEC and BSP need to join efforts to provide more unified oversight and supervision of NBFIs\nand to ensure effective compliance with market rules and regulations.\n56. Under the fragmented regulatory structure, NBFIs have not followed full and fair disclosure\nprinciples; company annual reports are incomplete, and the quality of information does not meet\n                                                          \n20 FIBV, or the International Federation of Stock Exchanges, is the trade organization for regulated securities and\nderivative markets worldwide. It promotes the professional business development of financial markets, at national\nand international levels.", "16\nSEC reporting standards.21 Lack of compliance with financial reporting rules and regulations and\nwith disclosure of significant subsidiaries or affiliates reflects SEC\u2019s weak monitoring system. An\ninsufficient level of market transparency and disclosure of company financial information has\naffected the efficiency and development of the capital markets in the Philippines. SEC does not\nhave sufficient capacity in accounting and auditing, and monitoring off-market transactions; as a\nresult, activities such as block trades have been inadequately regulated.\n57. While PSE rules provide for block sales to be reported to the market, both compliance\nand  the  level  of  disclosure  are  often  deficient.  Block  trades  have  been  abused  by  some\ninvestors and have led to the recent allegations of unfair pricing, market manipulation, and\nabuse. The conduct of block trades in listed securities is permissible in many equity markets. It\nis  recognized  that  permitting  ownership  in  large  parcels  of  shares  reduces  the  average\ntransaction cost of selling shares. However, since block sales are conducted in minimum sizes\nand its sales are outside the regular market of continuous bids and offers, these transactions\ntend  to  be  nontransparent.  More  efficient  mechanisms  are  required  to  ensure  that  price\ninformation from block trades is transferred to the market in a timely manner. The new provision\nin the tender offer rules effectively addresses the lack of pricing transparency of block sales by\nrequiring wider dissemination of price information to the market. The new SEC rule also sets\nparameters to protect minority stock holders. Each block sale is now recorded by SEC.\n58. This lack of transparency and enforcement manifested itself in a series of stock market\nscandals.  In  addition  to  the  stock  manipulation  and  insider-trading  allegation  of  the  BW\nResources stock in early 2000, there have been price manipulation charges against brokers\ninvolved  in  trading  the  Reynolds  Philippines  Corp.  stock.  Mismanagement  in  Urbancorp\nInvestment, Inc, and its parent company Urban Bank has also been noted. While the Reynolds\nPhilippines  Corp.  price  rigging  allegations  resulted  in  minor  fines  to  several  brokers,  the\ninvestment house irregularities resulted in a run on Urban Bank deposits. BSP closed Urban\nBank  and  SEC  suspended  the  investment  house  license  of  Urbancorp  Investment,  Inc.\nNegotiations are under way for rehabilitating both the bank and investment house.\n4. Lack of Diversification of Corporate Financing\n59. Financial leveraging by corporations in the Philippines has been comparatively lower\nthan in other East Asian economies. Lack of diversification in corporate financing, however,\nremains a problem since capital markets are thin, with little liquidity and depth. The limited\ndiversity of financial instruments provides weak prospects for financing options and innovation.\nWhile there are 230 listed companies on PSE, so far only one corporate bond has been issued,\ntwo companies have issued warrants, and one company has a preferred stock listing. Corporate\nbonds and asset-backed securities each account for less than 1 percent of the outstanding\nvalue of all listed securities. Of the total securities registered with SEC, about 80 percent are\ncommon stock, while short- and medium-term commercial paper account for about 12 percent.\nMedium-term, variable rate, commercial paper with maturities up to five years is issued in lieu of\nfixed-term corporate bonds.\n60. The money and debt market (Appendix 5) comprised (i) government securities including\ntreasury bills (T-bills) with tenures of 91, 182, and 364; days and bonds and notes of longer\ntenure  that  are  auctioned;  and  (ii)  interbank  call  loans,  promissory  notes,  repurchase\nagreements (repos), and commercial paper. The Government has been successful in launching\n                                                          \n21 Recent surveys of the annual reports of 16 listed Philippine holding companies revealed that 75 percent of the\ncompanies did not present summarized information regarding the financial position of significant subsidiaries in 1997.", "17\nfixed rate issues with a maturity of as long as 20 years. With respect to private issues, some\ncorporations  have  launched  commercial  paper  issues  of  longer  maturity.  The  insurance\nindustry, the Social Security System, and Government Services Insurance System participate in\nthe Government treasury auctions. Debt securities issues are mostly absorbed by commercial\nbanks either for their own account or to finance short-term placements.\n61. The main obstacle to debt market development is the high transaction costs, including\nthe documentary stamp tax (DST). While the DST on secondary trading has directly contributed\nto slow development of the secondary market, lack of liquidity, no market makers, and thin\nvolumes have resulted in little interest by investors. Another constraint has been inadequate\nmarket  infrastructure  for  registration,  clearance,  and  settlement,  as  well  as  investment\nlimitations on institutional investors.\n62. The issue of market liquidity is tied to the ability of an investor or market maker to fund\ninventory to buy and sell securities. In general for a bank, broker, or investment bank, equity\ninventory may be financed through (i) repos, or (ii) securities borrowing and lending activities.\nFully collateralized repos (usually by Government securities) are securities that are normally\nexempt  from  reserve  requirements,  excessive  capital  charges,  or  burdensome  transaction\ntaxes, and are considered a cost-effective way for dealers and market makers to finance their\ninventories of Government and private securities. However, in the Philippines repos are classified\nas bank deposit substitutes; therefore, banks are required to hold reserves against their inventory.\nIn addition, securities borrowing and lending are presently not allowed. As a result of these\nrestrictions, the market is illiquid as there are no market makers who can at all times provide bid\nand offer prices for securities. If debt markets are to fully develop, the Government needs to\naddress taxation and market liquidity concerns, including identifying prudentially sound ways of\nfostering liquidity.\n5. Fragile Market Infrastructure\n63. Under the CMDP loan, ADB supported the development of a clearing and settlement\nsystem  and  the  establishment  of  a  central  depository  institution  (paras.  36-38).  These\ninstitutions provide the basic infrastructure needed to create a modern market trading system\n(Appendix 6). SCCP is the equity clearing and settlement agency, and PCDI is the depository\ninstitution. SCCP, operating under a temporary license from SEC, is supported by an electronic\ndata processing system, which is shared and owned by PCDI. It is the responsibility of SCCP to\nexecute DVP settlement, maintain and administer a Clearing and Trade Guarantee Fund, and\nundertake system risk monitoring and management.\n64. The smaller brokers and dealers have shown resistance to the implementation of DVP\nas it eliminates the \u201cfloat\u201d time between buying a security and transferring the money from a\nbroker or dealer\u2019s account. Under DVP, simultaneous transfer eliminates the risk of nondelivery\nof security or nonpayment of funds for a transaction. The real risk of nondelivery is broader\nmarket failure triggered by the unwinding of linked trades. SCCP, responsible for executing\nDVP,  has  encountered  difficulty  in  meeting  its  objectives  because  of  its  ownership  and\ngovernance structure and delays in development of the RTGS systems. Since July 2000, PSE\nwith its majority shareholding has effectively taken control of SCCP, installing one of its own\nmembers as head of the institution.\n65. Under  SEC  licensing  requirements,  SCCP  is  required  to  establish  and  maintain  a\nClearing and Trade Guarantee Fund. At present, PSE maintains a trust fund\u2013currently about\nP186 million\u2013 for this purpose. A common rule of thumb is that such funds should be 5 percent", "18\nof  daily  unsettled  trades.  Given  the  sharp  decline  in  the  stock  market,  this  fund  appears\nadequate. However, when the market returns to precrisis levels, additional funds will be required\nto cover the risk of the higher volume of trades.\n66. PCDI provides securities registration and safekeeping services through a book entry\nsystem, and gives SCCP information for clearing and cash settlement of trades. PCDI links\nPSE, SCCP, brokers, custodians, and settlement banks together under one information and\naccounting system. PSE has mandated that all trades executed on PSE be settled through PCDI.\nCurrently, SCCP and PCDI operations are limited to the equity market. Furthermore, provisions in\nSRC for uncertified securities have potentially created uncertainties regarding the future role of\nPCDI. SRC defines the role of stock transfer agents (in place of PCDI) and commercial banks (in\nplace of SCCP) to allow them to assume some of the functions of the present clearance and\nsettlement and depository system. While it is unclear how these provisions will be implemented, it\nwould be unusual for commercial banks to assume the risk exposure of equity clearing and\nsettlement. However, with the imminent demutualization of PSE, issues concerning the clearing,\nsettlement, and depository systems need to be explored with SEC and PSE.\n6. Low-Quality Financial Reporting\n67. The establishment, implementation, compliance, and enforcement of best practices in\naccounting  and  auditing,  corporate  governance,  and  securities  markets  standards  are\nrecommended means of enhancing transparency and information flows in emerging markets.\nGuidelines as developed by international standard setters will help the Philippines encourage\nhigh quality accounting and reporting arrangements consistent with international standards.\n68. The  weak  monitoring  of  financial  statements  by  SEC  (para.  56)  is  compounded  by\nreporting  requirements  of  the  Philippine  Accounting  Standards  Council,  which  prescribes\nstatements of financial accounting standards that are not consistent with international accounting\nstandards (IAS). The accounting profession has adopted a wide range of policy choices for\npreparing financial statements; the quality of financial reporting for investors has therefore been\naffected.\nFigure 1: Perceived Quality of Financial Accounting Systemsa\n10\ns\nm\nste 9\ny\nS\ng \nntin 8\nu\no\nc\nc\nA 7\nal \nci\nn\na\nFin 6\nof \ny \nalit 5\nu\nQ\n4 I\nMalaysia Thailand Philippines Indonesia\na \nSaudagaran,  Ahahrokh  and  Joselito  Diga.  2000.

Adopting  IAS  will  (i)  reduce  the  costs  and  efforts  associated  with  standard  setting,\n(ii) improve the credibility of Philippine financial reporting, (iii) provide access to a greater range of\ntraining materials, (iv) make Philippine CPA skills more transferable on the international market,\nand (v) align Philippine financial reporting standards with international standards and practices.\nWhere an IAS does not address a certain country-specific arrangement, then specific national\naccounting standards can be adopted for country-specific financial arrangements.\n70. Besides  accounting,  there  has  been  weak  monitoring  of  compliance  with  standard\nauditing  practices.  Philippine  auditing  practices  differ  substantially  from  international  and\nregional guidelines and norms in four areas: (i) auditor appointment and dismissal, (ii) auditor\nindependence, (iii) audit reporting procedures, and (iv) exposure of auditors to liability.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector and Aid Agency Coordination\n71. IMF provided a two-year standby credit to the Government of the Philippines, equivalent\nto SDR1,021 million (about $1,371 million) to support the government\u2019s economic program from\n1998-1999. The program addressed the dual goals of supporting Government liquidity during\nthe Asian crisis while creating the conditions for sustained growth over the medium term. The\nstandby program, scheduled for completion in June 2000, was extended until December 2000.\nThis  standby  arrangement  was  allowed  to  lapse;  however,  the  Government  consented  to\nregular  IMF  consultations  to  review  the  medium-term  economic  framework  and  the  broad\ndirection of structural reform under a post-program monitoring agreement.\n72. Within this overall context, both the World Bank and ADB have been pursuing structural\nadjustment programs in the financial sector. The World Bank has supported banking sector\nrestructuring and reforms, while ADB has focused on capital market growth and development.\nThe World Bank\u2019s Banking System Reform Project22 ($300 million) was co-financed by Japan\nBank for International Cooperation (43.8 billion yen). This operation focused on strengthening\nbanking regulation and supervision as well as developing a resolution framework for troubled\nbanks and encouraging banking sector restructuring. Although the Government and World Bank\ndecided to cancel the project in May 2001, banking sector reform is continuing. The World Bank\nhas also conducted economic and sector work in the areas of pension reform, housing finance,\nand enterprise restructuring. Appendix 7 gives a detailed list of reforms implemented under this\nloan.\n73. ADB involvement in the capital markets started with reforms under the CMDP. The\nCMDP focused on (i) consolidating the two stock exchanges, (ii) encouraging transparency and\naccountability through increased public disclosure of financial information, and (iii) building\ncapacity and market confidence. Although the Government was in compliance with the core\nconditions of the CMDP loan, compliance with a number of other conditions tied to the release\nof  the  second  tranche  was  delayed  with  the  enactment  of  SRC.  Although  ADB  and  the\nGovernment agreed to cancel the second tranche,23 the CMDP was successfully completed\nfollowing the passage of SRC in July 2000. ADB approved TA for $2 million in 1999 (footnote 4)\nto (i) restructure SEC, (ii) build the capacity of SEC staff, and (iii) strengthen the management\ninformation system (MIS).\n                                                          \n22The World Bank: Banking System Reform, Report No. P7235-PH, approved in November 1998.\n23  IN.88-00: Capital Market Development Program Cancellation of Second Tranche, April 2000.", "20\n74. In addition to international financial institutions\u2019 initiatives, USAID approved a large TA24\nto (i) support enhancing the professionalization of PSE and a review of the business operations\nof the clearing and settlement system, (ii) draft the IRR for the SRC, and (iii) support the\nregulatory  reform  of  the  pre-need  and  investment  advisory  industries.  The  Canadian\nInternational Development Agency supported the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation25\nand BSP in capacity building for supervision, and assisted SEC in drafting revisions of the\nInvestment Company Act. The Australian Agency for International Development through its\nPhilippine-Australian Governance Facility, provided advisory assistance to PSE for developing\nits demutualization plan.\n75. With  assistance  from  IMF,  USAID,  and  World  Bank,  the  Government  has  been\ndeveloping legislation that will amend taxation laws to rationalize the DST and other taxes that\nhave hampered financial sector transactions. ADB\u2019s support for the nonbank financial sector\ncomplements and reinforces these aid agencies\u2019 efforts to reform the financial sector.\nD.  ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1.  Country Strategy\n76. ADB\u2019s country operational strategy, which was revised in 1998, conforms closely to the\nGovernment\u2019s  new  development  priorities  outlined  under  the  new  Medium-Term  Philippine\nDevelopment Plan approved in 2001 (para. 6). The strategy places increased importance on\npoverty reduction, social development, and improved governance. In particular, the strategy\nenvisages ADB\u2019s assistance program to concentrate on promoting equitable growth, better\nprovision of basic social services such as health care and basic education, management and\nprotection of the environment, and policies and programs to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure,\nwith emphasis on greater private sector participation. Through its sector focus, the strategy also\naddresses issues relevant to the currency turmoil, including capital market development.\n77. The immediate challenge of economic management is to restore public confidence in the\neconomy, while addressing the weaknesses in some of the economic fundamentals. ADB has\nidentified four economic management priorities for the Philippines: (i) restoring fiscal credibility,\n(ii) strengthening governance, (iii) improving the savings rate, and (iv) containing population\ngrowth. To reflect these priorities, ADB has been changing the sector mix of its operational\nprogram, moving away from traditional infrastructure project financing, to support broad-based\ngovernance reforms, policy and institutional reforms in the agriculture and power sectors, and\ndevelopment  of  basic  health,  education,  and  other  social  services.  Within  the  area  of\ngovernance,  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  and  programs  have  focused  on  improving  the\ntransparency of public expenditures, preventing corruption, accelerating privatization and the\nrestructuring of public sector utilities and other entities, decentralizing national government\nentities, and encouraging greater private sector participation. To broaden and deepen these\ngovernance initiatives, ADB\u2019s strategy has emphasized strengthening governance of financial\nmarkets\u2013a fundamental goal of the proposed Program.\n                                                          \n24The  USAID  project:  Accelerating  Growth,  Investment,  and  Liberalization  with  Equity  (AGILE)  provided\napproximately $27.7 million from June 1998 to September 2001 for multisector assistance that covers financial\nsector, trade and industry.\n25 ADB is also implementing TA 2971-PHI: Institutional Capacity Building of the Philippine Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, for $742,000, approved on 31 December 1997.", "21\n2.  Sector Strategy\n78. As seen in the recent Asian crisis, an economy that becomes more open and integrated\nwith the global economy will be more vulnerable to external economic shocks, particularly if it\nexhibits high dependence on banks and has a weak regulatory framework for the financial\nsector.26 This underscores the need for developing strategies that can support broadening and\ndiversifying the industry and financial sectors to allow for better risk mitigation and management.\nIn addition, the Philippines needs to actively pursue reforms in the finance, corporate, trade and\ninvestment sectors if it is to remain competitive in the region.\n79. To support the Philippines in these areas, the ADB\u2019s sector strategy envisages a twofold\napproach involving support for (i) financial sector reforms, with particular focus on nonbank\nfinancial sector development; and (ii) industry and trade development with a focus on fostering\ngreater competitiveness, including development of small and medium-size enterprises. In the\nfinancial sector, the primary emphasis of ADB\u2019s sector strategy has been to help develop and\ndiversify  the  nonbank  financial  sector  to  enable  it  to  provide  long-term  funding  and  risk\ndiversification avenues.  To promote the development of the nonbank financial sector, ADB has\nemphasized restoring investor confidence by strengthening governance of the financial and\ncorporate sectors at the regulator and market participant levels. To achieve this objective,\nADB\u2019s  policy  work  has  emphasized  strengthening  the  powers  of  SEC  and  its  governance\nstructure  to  effectively  enforce  market  regulations  and  conduct  proper  market  surveillance.\nSimultaneously, emphasis is placed on improving governance by promoting greater transparency\nand disclosure in financial reporting, use of international accounting and auditing standards, and\npromoting impartial policy, regulation, and enforcement across institutions and markets. Appendix\n8 gives the key reforms undertaken by the Government over the past 10 years.\nV. THE PROGRAM\nA. Rationale\n80. The Asian crisis has highlighted the risks associated with vulnerable financial structures\nin a financially integrated world. The buildup of vulnerabilities stemmed from excessive reliance\non bank financing, poor corporate and financial regulations and governance, including poor\ncompliance with accounting and auditing standards, and inadequate disclosure. Governance\nand enforcement have been weak at the regulator, financial institutions, and corporate levels.\nThe crisis has also revealed the risks of family and relationship-based corporate and financial\nstructures. While the Philippines managed to avert the more serious effects of the Asian crisis,\nthese same features also characterize its corporate and financial structures.\n81. Like other countries in the region, corporations in the Philippines rely heavily on bank-\nbased  financing.  Businesses  are  dominated  by  groups  of  companies  controlled  by  a  few\nshareholders, often members of the same family. High ownership concentration is typically both\na result and a cause of weak corporate governance. Less than a quarter of the country\u2019s largest\ncompanies are listed on PSE, and of these, two thirds or more of the stock is usually in the\nhands  of  the  controlling  group.  Consequently,  minority  or  \u201coutside\u201d  shareholders  are  not\ninvolved in corporate decisions and small shareholders are bypassed because of the small\n\u201cpublic float\u201d offered by companies. This contributes to thin illiquid markets, volatile share prices,\n                                                          \n26 Duncan, R. and S. Pollard. A Conceptual Framework for Designing a Country Poverty Reduction Strategy.\nDelivered at the Asia and Pacific Forum on Poverty: Reforming Polices and Institutions for Poverty Reduction,\nManila, 5-9 February 2001.", "22\nand the potential for price manipulation by the large controlling group. The end result is that the\nrelative scarcity of publicly traded shares limits overall access to capital market financing for a\nbroad range of companies. Hence, companies have come to rely on bank financing, often from\nan affiliated bank or other related intermediary. While related party loans are guided by limits to\ndirectors,  officers,  shareholders,  or  related  interests,  intercorporate  and  intragroup  lending\nraises issues of possible expropriation of capital that may eventually hurt the soundness of\nfinancial intermediaries. In this structure the incentives to improve governance and disclosure,\nat either financial institution or corporate level, are limited.\n82. To  rationalize  the  incentive  framework,  the  Government  will  develop  systems  and\nprocedures to increase the efficiency of corporate financing while strengthening corporate internal\ncontrols and improving standards of accounting, auditing, and financial reporting systems. In\naddition, effective rule enforcement will be placed at the top of the reform agenda.\n83. Under the Program, the Philippines has started to lay the foundations for a strong and\nrobust financial sector and institutions. The key pillars of the Program are (i) strengthening the\ngovernance and enforcement capacity of the regulators, SEC and BSP; (ii) modernizing the\nsecurities  market;  (iii)  introducing  more  transparency  in  the  market;  and  (iv)  encouraging\nenforcement of rules and regulations. These reforms are critical to meet the challenges of a\ngrowing  volatility  from  a  weak  stock  exchange,  competitive  pressures  from  technological\ninnovation, as well as globalization and integration of financial markets.\nB. Objective and Scope\n84.     The Program will support the process of capital formation through improved corporate\ngovernance in the nonbank financial sector. The key components of the Program are\n(i)  enhancing  and  strengthening  the  governance  of  SEC  by  (a)  allowing  SEC\ngreater administrative, operational, and financial autonomy; and (b) enhancing\nmonitoring and enforcement capacity;\n(ii)  modernizing the governance and regulatory structure of PSE by (a) developing\narrangements for PSE to strengthen its governance during the transition period,\n(b) restructuring  and  demutualizing  PSE,  (c)  enhancing  SRO  reporting,  and\n(d) developing arrangements for effective regulation of PSE;\n(iii)  strengthening market oversight, compliance, and enforcement by (a) developing\nmarket  governance,  (b)  strengthening  prudential  regulation  of  NBFIs,\n(c) preventing  misconduct  and  market  abuse,  and  (d)  improving  financial\nmanagement and governance by strengthening financial disclosure monitoring;\nand\n(iv)  facilitating diversification and innovation of corporate financing by (a) developing\na policy, regulatory, and taxation framework for the corporate bond market; and\n(b) enhancing institutional investors\u2019 participation to augment market liquidity.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n85. Building on ADB\u2019s extensive economic and sector work and policy dialogue over the last\ndecade, the NFG Program provides a long-term approach and perspective for reforms in the\nnonbank financial sector. To capture this long-term perspective effectively, the NFG Program\nhas been developed in two phases.", "23\n(i) Phase  I,  from  1998  to  2001,  focused  on  guiding  the  transformation  of  the\nregulator (SEC) and the stock exchange (PSE). SEC is now empowered to deal\nmore effectively with market governance, regulation, and enforcement. PSE has\ntaken the initial steps toward adopting new corporate governance standards and\nbusiness practices. To support these institutions in the implementation of their\nregulatory  responsibilities,  Phase  I  supported  the  strengthening  of  market\nregulations, increasing the transparency of market transactions, and encouraging\ngreater compliance with rules and regulations. Simultaneously, Phase I reforms\nalso  promoted  an  environment  that  will  encourage  the  development  of  new\nfinancing options and structures.\n(ii) Phase II, 2002-2004, aims to broaden and deepen the policy framework and\nactions implemented under Phase I.  These reforms will draw on the technical\nwork sponsored by ADB under TA (para. 123-125), the results of the Financial\nSector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted jointly by IMF and the World\nBank, and the extensive economic and sector work conducted by ADB. ADB has\nbeen participating in the Review of Standards and Codes with the World Bank in\nthree  areas:  accounting  and  auditing,  corporate  governance,  and  corporate\ninsolvency. The core topics of Phase II include (a) implementing demutualization\nof  PSE;    (b)  strengthening  market  regulation;  (c) strengthening  market\ngovernance and compliance; and (d) facilitating diversification and innovation in\ncorporate financing. These four themes will be the basis for continuing the policy\ndialogue  on  Phase  II  and  critical  to  support  greater  SEC  effectiveness  and\nsustained reform in the nonbank financial services sector. The Government will\naugment this reform agenda, drawing on the recommendations of the FSAP,\nwhich  will  assess  economic  and  financial  sector  vulnerabilities  and  identify\npriority issues and constraints facing different segments of the financial sector\nand their interrelationships.\n86. Phase I consists of the 35 policy actions described in the policy matrix (Appendix 1).\nPhase II will follow the Agenda for Phase II Dialogue described in Appendix 1.\n1. Phase I of the NFG Program\na. Enhance and Strengthen SEC Governance\n87. SEC has undergone a number of changes throughout the 1990s. The first major effort to\nstrengthen SEC was supported under the CMDP loan. Policy actions under this loan supported the\ninitial steps to reorient the operations and systems within SEC from company registration and\nmonitoring to capital market regulation. However, SEC was unable to fully adopt an effective\nregulatory culture as its structure, systems, and procedures were constrained under the Revised\nSecurities Act. Recent scandals (para. 8) in the securities market forced the Government to take\nswift action and initiate deeper reforms. As part of Phase I, the Government enacted the SRC in\nJuly 2000. Under the SRC, articles in the Revised Securities Act, which prohibited SEC from\nrestructuring its operations, were removed. SEC is now empowered to reorganize, streamline its\nstructure and operations, self-finance, rationalize its staff incentive structure and upgrade its human\nresources, and oversee the SRO and the securities industry. These key amendments to the SRC\nsupported SEC restructuring and reorganization. With support of ADB TA, SEC prepared its\nrestructuring  plan,  adopted  the  new  organizational  structure,  assessed  its  staffing  and  skills\nrequirements, and developed new job descriptions.", "24\n88. The reorganization plan was developed in line with the IOSCO Objectives and Principles\nof  Securities  Regulation. IOSCO  principles  advocate  establishing  an  appropriate  balance\nbetween  independence  and  accountability,  clear  regulatory  objectives,  and  ensuring  the\nresources to meet those objectives. Although SEC is still under the administrative authority of\nDOF, it has gained greater autonomy under the SRC. SEC can retain part of the funds that it\nraises and has been empowered to issue rules, impose sanctions, and regulate the securities\nmarket.\n89. SEC established a reorganization committee headed by the chairperson and comprising\nthe  commissioners  and  department  directors  of  SEC.  Supported  by  TA  (footnote  4),  the\ncommittee recommended a full reorganization of SEC including the establishment of a new set\nof  core  operating  departments:  market  regulation,  corporation  finance,  enforcement,  and\ncompliance  and  inspection.  In  addition,  specific  support  departments/offices/divisions  were\ncreated, including the Office of the General Counsel, General Accountant, and an Investor\nInformation and Publication Division. The restructuring plan includes a new salary structure for\nSEC staff comparable with that for BSP and other government financial institutions.\n90. The Economic Coordinating Council endorsed a separation package for redundant staff\nas part of the restructuring plan. The retrenchment was voluntary and it was agreed that about\nhalf  of  the  staff  would  no  longer  be  required  in  the  new  organization.  After  the  new  job\ndescriptions and skill requirements were developed, staff applied for the newly posted positions.\nA job placement service was established at SEC to assist the transition of interested staff to\nother Government agencies. Given the fair separation package and the transparent processes\ndeveloped, staff retrenchment was accomplished with little disruption and loss of morale at\nSEC. Ultimately, 300 of 700 staff took the early retirement or a separation package costing\napproximately $6 million.27\n91. Following agreement on the structure, core departments, and work flow within SEC, a\nstaffing plan with job descriptions and skill requirements was developed. Salary scales of SEC\nwere aligned with other comparable government agencies to attract and keep high-quality staff.\nSupporting the organizational restructuring, ADB TA developed a full-scale training program for\nnewly recruited and retained staff to familiarize them with the SRC provisions and its IRR. The\nstaff were trained using newly developed manuals on reporting rules for brokers and dealers,\ninvestigation  practices  for  compliance  and  enforcement,  and  SRO  and  company  reporting\nrequirements.\n92. In line with the Program, the Enforcement Department of SEC was entrusted with full\npowers to enforce and laws and regulations ensure compliance of all market participants. SEC\nfurther  established  processes  for  investigating  potential  legal  infractions  and  taking  action\nagainst market participants, issuers, and individuals that breach SRC and SEC regulations.\nb. Modernize Governance and Regulatory Structure of PSE\n93. Phase I supported the initial steps toward a major transformation of PSE to improve\ngovernance, and increase efficiency and compliance with rules and regulations. The Program\nsupported restructuring PSE\u2019s board of governors to include a majority of independent directors\n                                                          \n27 The voluntary retirement package was developed based on years of service in addition to the usual civil services\nallowances for pension. Additional restructuring costs noted in para. 118 (i) include the cost of higher salaries, new\ninformation technology, and communication systems; the development and maintenance of a web site, public\ninformation office; and increased building and system security.", "25\nwho represent the broader interests of the market. Of the 15 members on the board, PSE\ninducted 5 new representatives, bringing the nonmember representation to 8, including the PSE\npresident. These nonmember directors were selected from academia, law firms, and industry\nand represent and protect the interests of investors and the general public.\n94. In line with the program objectives, PSE conducted a study to examine the feasibility of\nconverting the stock exchange from a mutual, or member-owned and -governed entity into a for-\nprofit,  shareholder-owned  corporation.  The  study,  completed  in  April  2001,  recommended\nsuitable  options  for  the  privatization,  or  demutualization,  of  PSE  based  on  its  business\nprospects, and a plan for a governance and regulatory framework within the SRO framework.\nProvisions in the SRC created some of the parameters for PSE demutualization. For example,\nunder the SRC no shareholder in the demutualized exchange can hold more than 5 percent of\nshares and no group control over 20 percent unless SEC determines otherwise. This provision will\nensure a diverse ownership structure for PSE. PSE has already taken the first step in the process\nby issuing 20 percent of PSE shares to its members. PSE is holding the remaining 80 percent for\neither direct placement with interested investors or eventual self-listing on the PSE.\nc.  Strengthen Market Oversight, Compliance, and Enforcement\n95. Restoring investor confidence is a top priority of the Government. Phase I supported the\nimplementation of higher standards of market oversight and transparency. Greater transparency\nand accountability were developed by introducing stricter reporting requirements for the SRO.\nThis complied with the IRR developed to support the SRC provisions. SEC now has to review and\nmonitor SRO reports regularly for timeliness and accuracy. In addition, the SRO should notify\nSEC of any investigation of a broker or stock being initiated by the SRO, at the same time that it\nnotifies the PSE board of governors.\n96. The Program supports increased transparency in securities market trading. This includes\nmore effective and fuller disclosure of information that may impact on share prices. All listed\ncompanies are now required to have two, or 20 percent, independent members on their Board\nof Directors. The independent directors represent the public and minority shareholders\u2019 interests\nand bring greater transparency and facilitate disclosure of company information to the public. To\nimprove the efficiency and transparency of the pricing of equity stocks, the dissemination of\nprice information from block sales was improved through increased market disclosure and stock\noffer requirements on block sales of stock. SEC also adopted rules for stronger beneficial\nownership disclosure, including establishing a subregistry with the beneficial owner names listed\nunder the stockbroker accounts at PDCI. SEC created an Office of General Accountant to\nimprove the quality of information disclosed to the market; encourage greater transparency,\npublic awareness, and dissemination of its own rules and regulations on its web site; and\nopened a public information office.\n97. The IRR for the SRC addressed prudential concerns by requiring brokers and dealers to\nmaintain adequate capital reserves in line with international standards. In addition, rules defining\nthe requirements for market makers, the segregation of stockbrokers and dealers, and shorter\nsettlement periods for all SEC fines and penalties were introduced under Phase I.\n98. To fight fraud, manipulation, and deception in connection with the purchase and sale of\nsecurities whether in PSE transactions or outside the exchange, Phase I supported provisions in\nthe  SRC  to  broaden  SEC\u2019s  enforcement  powers.  New  standards  and  procedures  were\nintroduced  for  improved  market  monitoring  and  enforcement.  In  addition  to  establishing  a\nseparate department for compliance and enforcement, securities regulators are now protected", "26\nfrom prosecution when they act in good faith and within the legal powers conferred on SEC.  In-\nhouse training programs were developed to build capacity and keep investigators up-to-date on\nmarket activity.\nd. Facilitate Diversification and Innovation in Corporate Financing\n99. There is a relatively active market in listed stocks; however, the market for corporate\ndebt and other financial instruments is largely illiquid because of policy, regulatory, and taxation\nconstraints. An adequate supply of equity and diversified debt products increases financing\noptions and its risk management alternatives at the level of both financial institutions and\ncorporations.  Phase  I  supported  Government  initiatives  to  improve  the  environment  for\ncorporate financing. A high-level working group comprising regulators and market participants\nsuch as BSP, SEC, Bankers Association of the Philippines, Investment House Association of\nthe  Philippines,  and  other  resource  people  developed  a  manual  on  debt  origination  and\nunderwriting.  SEC  has  already  discussed  the  system  modifications  required  for  more\ntransparent information through a subregistry system at the PCDI.\n100. In addition, Phase I supported the liberalization of the insurance company investment\ncode to allow greater participation of insurance companies in the market and improve risk\nmanagement  of  funds  while  providing  greater  market  liquidity.  Phase  I  also  supported\nexpanding the possibilities of financing for market intermediaries and enhancing the role of\nsophisticated  investors  in  line  with  international  practice.  This  involves  allowing  financing\ncompanies and investment houses greater flexibility in meeting their funding requirements.\n101. Phase I supported the thorough review of the PCDI systems and procedures, including\nthe  present  certificate  processing  systems,  business  plan;  an  analysis  of  the  current\ninfrastructure and feasibility for corporate debt registry and trading; compliance with G-3028 and\nInternational Systems Security Association recommendations; and staff training requirements.\n2. Phase II of the NFG Program\na. Implement Demutualization of PSE\n102. Part of the efforts to restore investor confidence in the Philippines securities market will\nbe demutualizing and privatizing PSE. This process has already started with the distribution of\nPSE  shares  to  the  members  (para.  94),  but  further  efforts  are  needed  to  improve  PSE\ngovernance. Governance reform is instrumental to the future successful development of the\ncapital market in the Philippines. The goal of demutualization is to facilitate PSE\u2019s ability to\nrespond to market changes, reduce transaction costs, augment resources for investment in\nnewer technology to replace the outdated internal systems and trading platforms, and institute\nmore professional management practices. Given these changes, the SRO framework will need\nto be strengthened.\n103. SEC will work closely with PSE to ensure PSE\u2019s smooth and effective transition from a\nnonprofit to a fully privatized, or demutualized, company. The transition involves distributing\nPSE shares to create a broad, diverse ownership structure. In this process, SEC and PSE will\n                                                          \n28The Group of Thirty, established in 1978, is a private, nonprofit, international body composed of very senior\nrepresentatives of the private and public sectors and academia. It aims to deepen understanding of international\neconomic and financial issues, to explore the international repercussions of decisions taken in the public and\nprivate sectors, and to examine the choices available to market practitioners and policymakers.", "27\nneed to work together to evolve satisfactory governance and regulatory arrangements in line\nwith  good  international  practices.  Full  implementation  of  PSE  demutualization  will  address\ngovernance concerns, increase the efficiency and transparency of market transactions, and\nimprove  compliance  with  regulations.  These  measures  are  expected  to  boost  investor\nconfidence and investment in the market.\n104. In addition, there will be a need to enhance market monitoring and surveillance and\nensure the transparency of the trading mechanism. Under Phase II, ADB will continue to work\nwith PSE and SEC to ensure sound market regulatory practices in line with the demutualized\nstructure of PSE. Ultimately, demutualization will lead to greater efficiency, cost savings, and a\nstock exchange more transparently managed in line with international best practices and sound\ncorporate governance standards.\nb. Strengthen Market Regulation\n105. SEC is expected to develop greater capacity to enforce legislation and regulations and\nmonitor  financial  reporting  of  market  participants;  it  will  require  enhanced  systems,  skills\nupgrading, and standards training in accounting and auditing. SEC is expected to support more\nin-house capacity building and training of its staff in the use of information technology and\nmanagement  systems  to  increase  staff  efficiency.  Specifically  designed  training  modules\ndeveloped under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers: Financial\nRegulators Training Initiative will be introduced.29 Activity has already started to address some\nof the regulatory issues in the nonbank financial sector with an MOU between SEC and BSP.\nMOUs are planned for SEC and PSE, and SEC and the institutions that regulate the accounting\nprofession.\n106. In addition, SEC will take the lead in developing a strategy to deal with the direction of\nregulation of the nonbank financial sector in the Philippines. The policy framework must have a\nclear focus on raising regulatory effectiveness. One of the key requirements in meeting this\nobjective is a consistent approach to regulating markets and market conduct. SEC is responsible\nfor the prudential soundness of a subset of financial institutions including investment houses,\nfinancing companies, and the pre-need industry and mutual funds. It is also fully responsible for\nmarket conduct issues across the securities market. There are a number of regulatory models in\nthe world, each with advantages. The Philippines needs to adopt a consistent approach to market\nregulation and should develop a strategy that will address these issues and recommend policy\nmeasures  to  strengthen  nonbank  financial  markets.  The  results  of  the  FSAP  may  provide\nadditional insight into the concerns and vulnerabilities and inter-relationships in the financial\nsector.\nc. Strengthen Market Governance and Compliance\n107. Under Phase II, the Government is committed to improving financial management and\ngovernance by strengthening financial disclosure and monitoring. SEC will upgrade its capacity to\nimprove both the quality and quantity of financial information disseminated to the public. This will\ninvolve introducing SEC procedures for routine checking of financial statements and audited\nreports and instituting a penalty system for auditing firms that do not qualify audit opinions or\nwhere financial disclosure information is inaccurate or incomplete.\n                                                          \n29The ADB web site has a list of activities conducted under this initiative.", "28\n108. The Government will support the review of the Revised Accountancy Law of 1975. After\nthe  review,  amendments  will  be  prepared  to  reflect  improved  governance  and  financial\nmanagement  standards.  The  amendments  will  refine  arrangements  accounting  for  setting\nstandards in the Philippines. Additional amendments will be prepared to improve transparency\nand accountability in the auditing profession. The professional accounting bodies are supporting\nthe adoption of IAS as agreed to by Government as a signatory to the IOSCO Objectives and\nPrinciples of Securities Regulation. Additional actions will be taken by Government to introduce\nIAS, enhance accounting standard setting, increase the accountability of professionals, and\nstrengthen monitoring and compliance with auditing practices.\n109. An equally important area is clearance and settlement and the depository infrastructure\nfor  the  securities  market.  Systems  and  procedures  need  to  be  established  such  that  the\noperations of clearance and settlement and the depository are transparent, efficient, and in line\nwith international guidelines. Developing cost-efficient and transparent infrastructure for trading,\nclearance and settlement, depository and registry functions is critical for international market\nrecognition and investor confidence. In addition, steps need to be taken to develop a scripless\ntrading environment in accord with Group-30 recommendations. Specifications for corporate\nbond trading and registry functions are already under way. The Government is committed to\nmaintaining international standards for clearing and settlement and recognizes that any changes\nto the present market infrastructure will be based on international standards and in accordance\nwith the best interests of market development.\nd. Facilitate Diversification and Innovation in Corporate Financing\n110. The Government is supporting private sector efforts to improve financing alternatives for\nthe corporate sector. Phase II will support the private sector in its efforts to develop a bond\nmarket exchange that will include corporate debt instruments. It is anticipated that this market\nwill give companies greater access to long-term corporate financing. Greater efforts are also\nneeded  to  eliminate  tax  policy  distortions  and  create  an  enabling  environment  for  trading\ncorporate debt instruments. The Government will seek to rationalize the tax and regulatory\nstructures on secondary trading of debt market instruments such that it will be economically\nviable  and  a  liquid  debt  market  will  be  possible.  The  corporate  debt  market  needs  to  be\nrevitalized by introducing regulations for corporate debt trading, upgrading market infrastructure\nfor a corporate debt registry, and rationalizing the tax system including the elimination of DST\non secondary trading.\nD.  Social and Environmental Issues\n111. Appendix 9 gives the poverty impact assessment. The policy actions under the Program\nare fully consistent with the three components of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, namely, pro-\npoor  sustainable  economic  growth,  good  governance,  and  social  development.30  Pro-poor\nsustainable economic growth is to be achieved through the Program\u2019s focus on measures to\nincrease investor confidence and restore the flow of much-needed investment capital to the\nPhilippines. The Program will strengthen market governance by improving the regulation of\ncompetitive markets, restructuring the stock exchange allowing it to operate more efficiently,\nand improving the quality and quantity of reported and audited financial statements. In addition,\nthe  Program  aims  to  rationalize  distortions  in  the  tax  policy.  These  measures  will  expand\neconomic opportunities by reversing policies that often protected and assisted large and influential\n                                                          \n30 Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of The Asian Development Bank,\napproved on 9 November 1999.", "29\nfirms  or  business  groups.  The  Program  will  contribute  to  income  generation  and  higher\nemployment. PSE restructuring will allow it to provide special services for small and medium-size\nenterprises to source capital from the stock market. Access to longer-term equity capital has been\na major constraint for small and medium-size enterprises.31\n112. The Program will not have any direct and immediate environmental impacts. The likely\nenvironmental  impacts  are  indirect  and  long-term,  and  most  are  positive  (environmentally\nbeneficial). Evaluation of the potential indirect environmental impacts of the policy matrix is in\nAppendix 10.\nVI. THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA.  Amount of Loan and Source of Funds\n113. The Republic of the Philippines has requested a loan of $75 million from ADB's ordinary\ncapital resources to help finance the Program.  The loan will have a 15-year term, including a\ngrace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank\noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a\nfront-end fee of 1.0 percent (the fee will be capitalized in the loan); conversion options that may\nbe exercised in accordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations,\nand  ADB's  Conversion  Guidelines;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan\nAgreement.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  reasons  for  the  Republic  of  the\nPhilippines' decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these\nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Republic of the\nPhilippines' own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or\nadvice of ADB.\n114. The size of the program loan was determined keeping in view the (i) estimated short- to\nmedium-term costs of the reform program (in fiscal or balance-of-payment terms or both),\n(ii) strength of the reform package, and (iii) relative importance of the sector.\n115. Total adjustment costs incurred under Phase I are estimated at about $55 million during\nthe program period. They consist of\n(i)  SEC  restructuring  costs  (about  $15  million)  including  $6  million  for  staff\nretirement program;\n(ii)  costs of administrative reforms linked to the computerization and reorganization\nof SRO monitoring systems in PSE and SEC, and the continuing cost of higher\nsalaries at SEC (about $25 million); and\n(iii)  demutualization costs already borne by SEC and PSE, including the costs of\ndeveloping business plans, restructuring staffing at the exchange, development\nof new procedures for the SRO, development of new infrastructure for clearing\nand settlement, and SEC-related costs for increased staffing and developing a\nnew regulatory framework for the demutualized exchange ($15 million).\n116. The Program will play a key role in restoring investor confidence in the Philippines and\nattracting  foreign  investment.  A  secure  investor  framework  includes  maintaining  a  well-\nfunctioning  stock  exchange  with  good  governance  principles,  and  a  transparent  regulatory\nframework applying international standards. The impact of weak investor confidence can be\n                                                          \n31 TA 3345 (footnote 6) is helping the development of small and medium-size enterprises sector issues.", "30\nseen directly in lost foreign investment. Over the past two years, foreign investment levels in the\nPhilippines were less than one third of the 1997 levels and largely attributed to low investor\nconfidence resulting from weak governance in the financial markets.\nB.  Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n117. The  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines,  and  the  interest  rate  will  be\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility and with an amortization period\nof 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years. The loan closing date is 31 December 2002.\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n118. DOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  NFG  program  and  SEC  will  be  the\nImplementing Agency. SEC will set up a coordinating committee headed by the chairperson of\nSEC and comprising representatives from BSP, Bureau of Treasury, DOF, National Economic\nand Development Authority, PSE, SEC, and the Capital Market Development Council that\ncomprises members from business and industry associations. ADB will also be a member of this\ncommittee to oversee progress in Phase II of the reform program.\nD.  Procurement and Disbursement\n119. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced\nand procured in ADB member countries (other than the items specified in the list of ineligible\nitems [Appendix 11] and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The\nGovernment  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s\nprojected disbursements under the loan for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the\nuse of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.\nE. Counterpart Funds\n120. The Government will utilize the local currency counterpart funds generated by the NFG\nloan to meet program expenditures and associated costs of reform and to help maintain current\nlevels of social expenditures.\nF. Monitoring and Tranching\n121. The single tranche for Phase I is justified because of the\n(i) substantive up-front compliance with 35 policy actions. These actions constitute\na holistic Phase I component of the NFG Program focusing on the key issues of\nempowerment and reorganization of SEC, fundamental corporate governance\nreforms of PSE, and initiating steps to enhance the transparency of market\nintermediaries and strengthening prudential regulation;\n(ii) evolving  nature  of  Phase  II.   ADB  and  the  Government  have  agreed  on  the\nAgenda for Phase II Dialogue and direction of the Program, but specific policy\nactions and the timetable for implementing Phase II will be developed by the\nGovernment  in  collaboration  with  ADB,  incorporating   the  results  of  additional\neconomic and sector work being sponsored by ADB and the completion of the\nFSAP;", "31\n(iii) uncertain global and regional financial market environment, which enhances the\npotential  risks  of  financial  contagion  and  requires  flexibility  in  designing  and\nprioritizing policy reforms in light of emerging developments and requirements;\n(iv) complexities of the PSE demutualization process, which requires more lead time\nto ensure an adequate buildup of investor confidence for a possible IPO for PSE;\nand\n(v) assessment of the capacities of the existing Implementing Agencies, which need\nsupport of the TA to implement the next phase of the Program.\n122. The loan amount of $75 million will be released upon loan effectiveness. The conditions\nfor release include 35 policy actions with which the Government has fully complied. An agenda\nfor Phase II dialogue has been developed in collaboration with the Government to ensure\nsustainability and enhancement of reform efforts. The Government and ADB will jointly monitor\nthe implementation of Phase II through semiannual reviews. These reviews, conducted with the\ncoordinating committee, will assess the direction and pace of Phase II. To assist ADB reviews,\nthe Government will provide relevant information through regular reporting on progress and\nimpact of the policy reforms.\nVII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n123. The objective of the TA (Appendix 12) is to strengthen market governance by focusing\non analytical and institutional support for the development of\n(i) an effective SRO framework to address the potential conflicts of interest in PSE\u2019s\nnewly demutualized ownership structure;\n(ii) SEC\u2019s capacity to investigate and enforce market regulations;\n(iii) an efficient MIS and staff training to effectively use the system; and\n(iv) skills and standards in accounting and auditing.\n124. The TA is estimated to cost $1.43 million equivalent, of which $0.84 is the foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $0.59  million  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance\n$1 million equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $0.16 million equivalent of\nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis\nSupport Facility, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $0.43\nmillion equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and workshops. Appendix 13\npresents the detailed cost estimates and financing plan.\n125. SEC will be the Executing Agency. The TA will be implemented over a 12-month period\nstarting January 2002 and ending in December 2002. It is estimated that the TA will require\n38 person-months  of  consulting  support:  22  from  international  consultants  and  16  from\ndomestic. All consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\nVIII. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Benefits\n126. ADB\u2019s long-standing support for capital market development, now expanded to cover the\nnonbank financial sector, is expected to assist the Philippines in developing vibrant, competitive,", "32\nand well-functioning financial markets. The Program\u2019s focus on strengthening the governance of\nfinancial markets is expected to have wide-ranging and sustained benefits. The primary benefits\nof the Program are promoting financial market stability and restoring investor confidence. These\nobjectives will be addressed through the implementation of reforms with the potential to broaden\nand  diversify  the  markets  and  support  capital  formation  by  encouraging  foreign  investor\nparticipation  in  the  domestic  markets.  Asset  diversification  away  from  the  banking  sector,\nespecially given the current level of banking stress, will support more resilient domestic markets\nable to withstand exogenous shocks and currency contagion. Effectively dealing with financial\ncrises will help the economy protect vulnerable groups, which fall below poverty lines during a\ncrisis, as currency depreciation triggers unemployment and impacts disproportionately on lower\nincome levels.\n127. Another principal benefit of the Program is restoring investor confidence in the markets\nas  SEC  emerges  as  a  strong  regulator  with  highly  skilled  professional  staff.  Efficient  and\nresilient financial and corporate sectors tend to be characterized by good governance. The\nAsian financial crisis revealed gaps in governance among regulators, financial institutions, and\ncorporations. Developing market surveillance capacities at SEC will provide greater insight into\nmarket  transactions  and  allow  regulators  to  track  market  abuse  and  fraudulent  activities.\nPenalties on market abuse will act as a deterrent to market manipulation and insider trading,\nwhich together have resulted in significant losses to investors. Better monitoring and reporting\nthrough a well-developed MIS will also improve SEC\u2019s ability to make public the details on\nsecurities markets transactions and activities, and help investors feel more confident about the\nquality of market information.\n128. Transforming PSE into a demutualized exchange will help PSE to remain competitive\nwith  modern  infrastructure  and  new  governance  and  regulatory  structures,  and  improve\nperformance and confidence in the exchange. Large companies are turning to Singapore and\nHong Kong, China, rather than listing domestically. A modern, professional, and well-regulated\nexchange is likely to provide better prospects for companies to meet their financing needs, while\nprotecting the interest of minority investors in the listed companies.\n129. Developing market infrastructure by upgrading systems and procedures for posttrade\nprocessing will help increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs, and enhance market\ntransparency and stability. One of the benefits of a better market infrastructure will be the\nestablishment of a facility for the clearance and settlement and registry of corporate debt\ninstruments. The corporate debt market is expected to provide much-needed capital to the\ncorporate sector, while at the same time supporting financing and risk diversity.\n130. Lastly, the Program will address one of the major deficiencies in the Philippines, poor\nfinancial accounting and auditing standards. As one of the cornerstones of governance, high-\nquality accounting and auditing practices provide the basis for establishing market integrity and\ncredibility. Without professional standards in these areas, a disclosure-based regulatory system\ncannot protect the interests of the public. The Program\u2019s emphasis on implementing IAS supports\nfull and fair disclosure policies and is part of ADB\u2019s efforts to implement international standards.\nB.  Risks\n131. The Program faces four major risks. First, macroeconomic stability and a sound banking\nsystem are prerequisites for the development of capital markets and affiliated institutions. With\nthe widening fiscal deficit and growing NPLs of the banking sector, macroeconomic stability\ncould  be  disrupted  or  banking  sector  fragility  may  worsen.  Recognizing  this,  the  new", "33\nGovernment has indicated its resolve to adopt more fiscal discipline and launch tax reforms to\nsupport macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the Government is taking steps to deal with\nthe weaknesses in the banking sector.\n132. Second, the effective implementation of the fundamental reforms of PSE and segments\nof the nonbank financial sector depends critically on the support of the private sector including\nthe members of PSE and other market intermediaries and participants. In the past, vested\ninterests and small brokers resisted change and stalled market reforms of PSE. In the design of\nthe Program, efforts were made for wider consultations to develop a consensus approach\namong  the  stakeholders.  More  significantly,  the  Program  incorporates  advance  actions  in\nspecific areas where there is likely to be resistance, such as the demutualization of PSE. One\ncritical  advance  action  in  Phase  I  is  the  development  and  approval  by  PSE  of  the\ndemutualization  plan.  To  foster  better  understanding  of  the  demutualization  process  and\ndisseminate  information  among  market  participants  on  the  governance  and  regulatory\nimplications  of  demutualization,  ADB  held  a  workshop  on  this  topic  in  August  2001.  The\nworkshop was well attended with good participation from Philippine stakeholders.\n133. Third, the effective implementation of the Program is contingent on developing capacities\nacross SEC, PSE, and in the area of financial management. Increasing the skills of regulators,\naccountants, and auditors is necessary if regulations and standards are to be enforced and levels\nof compliance increased. It is difficult for public sector institutions to attract and retain staff with the\ndesired skills and experience. The Program supports SEC adopting salary structures in line with\nBSP and Social Security System. In addition, SEC has been able rationalize its staffing levels and\nhire new better qualified professionals. ADB through its TA (footnote 4) and support from the\nAPEC  Finance  Ministers:  Financial  Regulators  Training  Initiative,  is  training  staff  to  develop\ncapacities in different technical areas. This training is being institutionalized through the newly\nestablished Human Resources department.\n134. Finally, one of the lessons learned from the CMDP was to avoid excessive reliance on\nthe enactment of legislation that may make the implementation of policy actions unpredictable.\nThe Program has focused on ensuring that current market regulations, if found satisfactory, are\nadequately enforced. The Program is all front loaded, including the enactment of legislation to\nensure  up  front  compliance  and  timely  implementation.  If  improvements  in  regulations  are\nrequired, alternatives to legislative action have been explored through rules and administrative\norders.\n135. In addition to the four risks noted, program loans to the Philippines have recently come\nunder scrutiny due to delays in implementing four pending programs.32 It should, however, be\nnoted that the performance of the Philippines on program loans has previously been credible. In\ntotal, the ADB has approved nine program loans to the Philippines. Four are ongoing and five\nhave been completed. The program performance audit reports rated two of the completed\nprogram  loans33  generally  successful,  with  the  tranches  released  in  a  timely  manner  and\nreforms well implemented.\n                                                          \n32 Loan 1662-PHI: Power Sector Restructuring Program, for $300 million, approved on 16 December 1998; Loan\n1663-PHI: Metro Manila Air Quality Improvement Sector Development Program, for $200 million, approved on 16\nDecember 1998; Loan 1739-PHI: Grains Sector Development Program, for $100 million, approved on 24 April\n2000; and Loan 1745-PHI: Pasig River Environmental Management and Rehabilitation Sector Development\nProgram, for $100 million, approved on 20 July 2000.\n33 PPA: PHI 17152: Fisheries Sector Program, December 1999; and PPA: PHI 0680: Agricultural Inputs Program,\nDecember 1987.", "34\n136. The remaining three completed program loans34 have been rated partially successful as\nthe Government complied with all loan tranche release conditions, but experienced delays in\nprogram implementation due to lack of familiarity with ADB procurement procedures, shifting\npriorities among stakeholders, and policy actions related to the enactment of legislation.\n137. More specifically, progress in implementing policy reforms in the four pending program\nloans  (footnote  35)  has  been  delayed  because  of  reforms  tied  to  the  enactment  of  new\nlegislation. The Government has made significant efforts to support all of the relevant legislation\nin Congress by identifying the legislation tied to ADB programs as priority legislation. These\nprograms are expected to be completed despite some delays.\n138. Under Phase I of the NFG Program, the Government enacted the SRC, with the SEC\ndeveloping the IRR for the law. The risk of delays in Phase I was mitigated by early enactment\nof legislation. Phase II will require up-front compliance with policy actions. Therefore, the risk of\ndelays in this Program is limited.\nIX. ASSURANCES\n139. The Government has assured ADB that (i) the policies adopted and actions taken prior to\nthe date of the Loan Agreement, as described in the development policy letter, will continue in effect\nfor the duration of the Program; and (ii) the Government, in collaboration with ADB, shall develop\npolicy actions based on the Agenda for Phase II Dialogue to carry forward Phase II of the NFG\nProgram. These actions, when agreed between the Government and ADB, may form the basis of\nfuture ADB assistance to the Government in the nonbank financial sector.\nX.  RECOMMENDATION\n140.

To support the implementation of these policy goals, the\nGovernment is focusing on strengthening macroeconomic management. The budget deficit is\nbeing kept under control through tax reforms and rationalization of public spending and policies\nare being pursued to help maintain stability in interest rates, prices, and the exchange rate. The\nGovernment is adopting more aggressive policies to promote private investment and private\nsavings. A major component of this is to develop a more robust and diversified financial system\nby promoting development of the nonbank financial services sector that has lagged behind the\ngrowth of the banking sector.\nDevelopment  of  nonbank  financial  services  sector  will  help  private  sector  meet  its\ngrowing long-term investment requirements, reduce excessive reliance on banking financing,\nand provide an alternate source of funding and varied financial instruments. This will assist the\ncorporate sector in its efforts to improve risk mitigation and management. The Government has\nlaunched a Nonbank Financial Governance (NFG) Program, which aims to restore investor\nconfidence  by  strengthening  the  governance  of  the  financial  and  corporate  sectors  at  the\nregulator and market participant levels. The Government has implemented Phase I of the NFG\nProgram from 1998 to 2001 and is now gearing itself to carry out Phase II over the next three\nyears. The reforms under the NFG Program will help mobilize the country\u2019s long-term funding\nrequirements and assist in restoring investor confidence.\nThe centerpiece of the NFG Program - Phase I, was the restructuring of the Securities\nand  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  This  was  achieved  as  a  result  of  the  Government\u2019s\nenactment of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) in July 2000. The SRC empowered the\nSEC and strengthened its governance structure to effectively enforce market regulations. The\nSRC  contains  provisions  that  facilitated  greater  administrative,  operational,  and  financial\nflexibility that strengthened the governance of SEC.\nIn addition, Phase I supported modernization of the governance and regulatory structure\nof  the  Philippine  Stock  Exchange  (PSE);  strengthening  market  oversight,  compliance  and\nenforcement; and measures to facilitate diversification and innovation in corporate financing.\nThe Government has made progress in modernizing the governance of PSE. PSE\u2019s\nBoard  of  Directors  (BOD)  is  now  more  in  line  with  international  standards  after  being\nreconstituted to include a 51 percent majority of independent directors from academia, law\nfirms, and industry. These independent directors represent and protect the interests of investors\nand the general public. In addition, the Government has required PSE to change its ownership\nstructure under the SRC. The previous mutual ownership structure had become outdated and\nno longer effectively served the needs of the public and the exchange members. The change", "     Appendix 1, page 2\n37\nfrom a mutual, nonprofit company, to a private stockholder-based structure should improve the\nefficiency and transparency of market transactions. The initial step in this process included the\ndistribution of 20 percent of PSE shares to the stockbrokers.\nThe Government has also made progress in implementing greater governance in the\nmarket by increasing transparency, better disclosure and enforcement procedures. Under SRC\nregulations, all listed companies are now required to have two, or 20 percent, independent\nmembers on their BOD. The SEC has also created an Office of General Accountant to improve\nthe quality of information disclosed to the market and encouraged greater transparency, public\nawareness, and dissemination of its own rules regulations on its web site and opened a public\ninformation office. SEC has also adopted rules for stronger beneficial ownership disclosure\nrequirements and has enhanced market monitoring by establishing a separate department for\ncompliance and enforcement, indemnification of securities regulators, and developing in-house\ntraining capacity to keep investigators up-to-date on market activity. The implementing rules and\nregulations for the SRC have addressed prudential concerns by requiring brokers and dealers to\nmaintain adequate capital reserves in line with international standards.\nUnder Phase I, the Government has also taken steps to improve the environment for\ncorporate financing. A high-level working group developed a manual on debt origination and\nunderwriting. Resolutions have been adopted to liberalize investment guidelines to allow greater\nparticipation of insurance companies, which enhanced market liquidity. Discussions with the\nPhilippine Central Depository, Inc., are under way for system modifications to provide more\ntransparent information through a sub-registry system; and for it to act as the registrar and\ncustodian for a corporate bond exchange.\nThe Government is committed to Phase II of the NFG Program that will build on and\ndeepen the reforms initiated under Phase I.  The Main emphasis of the Phase II reforms will be\nto:\n(i)   Carry  forward  and  complete  the  process  of  PSE  demutualization.    To\nachieve this, SEC will work closely with PSE to ensure a smooth and effective\ntransition of PSE from a nonprofit to a fully privatized, or demutualized, company.\nThe transition includes a distribution of PSE shares to create a broad, diverse\nownership structure. In this process, SEC and PSE will need to work together to\nevolve satisfactory governance and regulatory arrangements in line with good\ninternational practices. Full and effective implementation of demutualization of\nPSE will address governance concerns, increase the efficiency and transparency\nof market transactions, and improve compliance with regulations. It is expected\nthat these measures will boost investor confidence and investment in the market.\n(ii)   Strengthen market regulation. The SEC is expected to strengthen its capacity\nto enforce legislation and regulations, and monitor financial reporting of market\nparticipants. This will require enhanced systems, skills upgrading, and training in\naccounting and auditing standards. SEC will further enhance its enforcement and\nmarket surveillance capacities and improve regulation and supervision of the\nnonbank  financial  sector.  To  facilitate  this  process,  SEC  is  committed  to\nsupporting more in-house capacity building and training of its staff in the use of\nmore  information  technology  and  management  systems  to  increase  staff\nefficiency. SEC will also develop a strategy to deal with the future policy direction\nof regulation of the nonbank financial sector. Activity has already been started to\naddress some of the regulatory issues in the nonbank financial sector with an\nMOU between SEC and BSP, and MOUs planned for SEC and PSE, and SEC\nand the accounting profession.", "     Appendix 1, page 3\n38\n(iii)   Strengthen  market  governance  and  compliance.  The  Government  is\ncommitted to improving financial management and governance by strengthening\nfinancial  disclosure  and  monitoring.  The  professional  accounting  bodies  are\nsupporting the adoption of international accounting standards as agreed to by\nGovernment as a signatory to the IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities\nRegulation.  Development  of  cost-efficient  and  transparent  infrastructure  for\ntrading, clearance and settlement, depository and registry functions is critical for\ninternational market recognition and investor confidence. The Government is\ncommitted to maintaining international standards for clearing and settlement and\nrecognizes that any changes to the present market infrastructure will be based\non international standards and in accordance with the best interests of market\ndevelopment. Steps need to be taken to develop a scripless trading environment\nin accord with Group-30 recommendations. Specifications for corporate bond\ntrading and registry functions are already under way.\n(iv)   Facilitate  diversification  and  innovation  in  corporate  financing.  The\nGovernment  is  committed  to  supporting  private  sector  efforts  to  improve\nfinancing  alternatives  for  the  corporate  sector.  It  is  anticipated  that  broader\naccess of companies to long-term corporate financing will support longer-term\ngrowth. Greater efforts are also needed to eliminate tax policy distortions and\ncreate an enabling environment for trading corporate debt instruments.\nSubstantial technical assistance has been sought from the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) to strengthen market governance by (i) strengthening SEC\u2019s role in setting and enforcing\naccounting  and  auditing  standards  and  practices  in  line  with  international  standards;\n(ii) developing  the  self-regulatory  organization  (SRO)  framework  for  the  securities  market;\n(iii) strengthening  SEC\u2019s  capacity  to  investigate  and  enforce  market  regulations;  and\n(iv) enhancing management information systems to augment SEC\u2019s capacity to investigate and\nenforce market regulations.\nThe Government has effectively implemented Phase I of the NFG Program with advisory\nsupport from ADB and is committed to pursue Phase II of the Program. The Government of the\nPhilippines requests a Nonbank Financial Governance Program loan of $75 million and the\nassociated technical assistance grant for Strengthening Regulatory and Market Governance.\nThe Government will use the proceeds of the loan to meet the costs of structural adjustment of\nthe NFG Program.\n4 October 2001", "POLICY MATRIX FOR THE\nNONBANK FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE PROGRAM (PHASE I)\nProgram Objective: To support the process of capital formation through improved corporate governance in the nonbank financial sector.

The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) began operations in 1994 when the Manila and\nMakati Stock Exchanges merged. The Manila Stock Exchange had been in operation since\n1927, while the Makati Stock Exchange opened in 1963. There are two trading floors, but these\nare electronically linked and thus operate as one floor. The two floors will be physically merged\nwhen the PSE moves to a new location in 2004.\n2. PSE is a member-owned exchange, where each member has one vote at general\nmeetings. It is a not-for-profit organization and all profits are reinvested in the exchange. At the\nend of 2000, the exchange had 148 domestic and 36 foreign broker members. The exchange is\ngoverned by a 15-member board that has a majority of nonmembers since September 2000\n(Figure A6).\n3. On 29 June 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted PSE self-\nregulatory status. As a self-regulatory organization (SRO), PSE is responsible for the frontline\nregulation of member firms and their trading. To gain SRO status, PSE had to establish a\ncompliance and surveillance department. At the beginning of each year, PSE must submit an\nannual member audit plan to SEC, and each month reports of audits must be sent to SEC as\nwell as a consolidated report on capital adequacy compliance by members. PSE lost its SRO\nstatus in April 2000 following the resignation of the staff in the compliance and surveillance\ndepartment  in  conjunction  with  an  insider  trading  case.  The  SRO  status  was  restored  in\nSeptember 2000 when PSE again complied with the requirements for a SRO.\n4. Most issues listed on the PSE are common stocks. These can be either Class A or Class\nB. Filipinos can own both classes, while foreigners can only buy Class B stocks. Preferred\nstocks can also be issued. These differ from common stocks in that preference is given to the\nholders of this stock over the holders of common stocks.\n5. Trading is a fully automated auction market where buy and sell orders are prioritized by\nprice and time. The broker, dealer, or sales representative must indicate whether the order is for\nthe firm\u2019s own account or for a client. Furthermore, it must be clear whether the order is for a\ndomestic or foreign firm or client. Clearing and settlement are done by commercial banks in\nconjunction  with  the  Philippine  Central  Depository,  Inc.  Stock  certificates  are  immobilized\nthrough a book entry system, and settlement is done at T+4.\n6. The fees for trading include brokers commission of a maximum 1.5 percent of the total\ntransaction cost. In addition, transfer agents charge a transfer fee of P100 per stock, and value-\nadded tax is added to this fee. A documentary stamp tax of P1.5 for every P200 par value of the\nstock transferred is levied. Sales of listed stocks is also subject to a transaction tax of 0.5\npercent of the value of the transaction in lieu of a capital gains tax.\n7. From 1991 to 2000, the number of listed companies increased from 161 to 230 (Table\nA6). Market capitalization in 1991 was P297.7 billion, which increased to a peak of P2,121.8\nbillion by 1996 before the Asian financial crisis began. At the end of 2000, market capitalization\nstood at P2,577.69 billion, thanks to the listing of two large insurance companies, Manulife and\nSunlife. The share volume in billions of pesos grew from an average of 39.4 in 1991 to 659 in\n2000. The turnover ratio increased from 17.2 percent in 1991 to 31.1 percent in 1998, and 83.88\npercent in 1999.", "Appendix 4, page 2\n54\n8. The composite index rose from 1,151.9 at the end of 1991 to 3,170.6 in 1996. After a\nrebound in 1999, the index fell considerably in 2000, following poor regional prospects and in\nresponse to political uncertainty in the Philippines. By the end of 2000, the index stood at\n1,494.50.\n9. It is estimated that the top 20 brokers account for about 90 percent of turnover, while the\n4 top brokers alone account for 25 percent of turnover. Many of the small brokers account for\nless than 1 percent of turnover. As a result of the current ownership structure with one vote per\nmember, the large brokers have to gain the support of small brokers to implement any changes\nat the exchange. This situation is about to change as PSE is mandated by law to demutualize\nby September 2001. It is yet to be determined how the demutualized PSE will be structured, but\nit will be a profit-oriented organization with more dispersed ownership, and where the ownership\nshare determines the number of votes. Hence, the balance of power is likely to shift from small\nowners to large active owners. Demutualization will also affect SEC\u2019s oversight function, and\nrules and regulations may have to be revised to suit a demutualized exchange.\nTable A4: Philippine Stock Exchange\nPSE Market\nListed Share Volume Turnover\nYear Composite capitalization\nCompanies (billion pesos) Ratio (%)\nIndex (billion pesos)\n1991 161 1,151.9 297.7 39.4 17.2\n1992 170 1,256.2 391.2 77.0 22.4\n1993 180 3,196.1 1,088.8 182.2 24.6\n1994 189 2,785.8 1,386.5 364.3 29.4\n1995 205 2,594.2 1,545.7 379.0 25.8\n1996 216 3,170.6 2,121.8 668.8 36.5\n1997 221 1,869.2 1,251.3 586.2 34.8\n1998 222 1,968.8 1,373.7 408.7 31.1\n1999 223 2,142.9 1,937.7 948.0 83.8\n2000 230 1,494.5 2,577.7 659.0 56.5\nSource: Philippine Stock Exchange.", "Appendix 4, page 3\n55\nFigure A4:  Philippine Stock Exchange Organization Chart\nCommittees Board of Members\nGovernors\nPresident\nCEO\nSenior Vice President\nChief Operating\nOfficer\nVice President Vice President Asst.

Government Debt Securities\n1. Government debt securities are either short-term treasury bills (T-bills), with maturities\nshorter than one year, or treasury bonds with maturities over one year. T-bills have tenors of 91,\n182, or 364 days. T-bills with shorter tenors are called Cash Management Bills. Treasury bonds\nhave 2-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year or 20-year maturity. One 20-year bond was issued in April\n1997 and one 25-year bond in November 2000.\n2. T-bills are auctioned every Monday, and bonds every second and fourth Tuesday of the\nmonth. The amount and maturities to be auctioned are announced to dealers three working\ndays  before  the  auction.  It  is  done  electronically  through  the  Bridge  Information  System.\nGovernment securities eligible dealers (GSEDs) key in their bids before 1 pm on the day of the\nauction. The seven-member auction committee then reviews the bids and decides on awards.\nThe interest rate is essentially market-determined.\n3. The auction committee is made up of the secretary of the Department of Finance (DOF),\ntreasurer,  2  deputy  treasurers,  assistant  secretary  from  DOF,  Securities  and  Exchange\nCommission (SEC) chairman, and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) representative. The result\nis relayed back to the dealers through the automated debt auction processing system (ADAPS).\n4. The dealers can make a maximum of seven competitive bids and one noncompetitive\nbid per tenor. A competitive bid is a tender to buy an amount of securities at a yield rate per\nannum that a GSED believes will wrest an award for the GSED by outbidding other dealers. A\nnoncompetitive bid is a tender to buy a specified amount of Government securities without\nindicating any yield rate. The rate for non-competitive bids will be the weighted average yield\nrate  of  the  competitive  bids  awarded  at  the  same  auction.  Sixty  percent  are  awarded  to\ncompetitive bids and 40 percent to noncompetitive.\n5. Auction awards are downloaded into the RoSS system (Registry of Scripless Securities)\nto register ownership. From the RoSS system, a trade report for settlement goes to BSP for\ncash settlements, and statement of securities goes to dealers.\n6. There  are  45  accredited  dealers.  The  requirements  to  become  a  dealer  include\nP100 million unimpaired capital and surplus account, meet all ratios prescribed for the industry,\nand be electronically linked to ADAPS and RoSS. Settlement in RoSS at the Bureau of Treasury\nis real time, while cash settlement is done at BSP, T+1.\n7. The outstanding amount of government securities at the end of 1999 amounted to P986.7\nbillion. During 1999 a total of 239.3 billion pesos of government securities were issued. This figure\nincludes 91-, 182- and 364-day T-bills, and bonds with maturities of 2, 5, 7, and 10 years.\n8. Interest rates on 91-day bills have come down from an average of 10.19 percent in\n1999, to an average of 8.9 percent during the first three quarters of 2000 (Figure A7).\n9. Under the Small Investors Program, small denominations of treasury bonds with a five-\nyear maturity and minimum face value of P5,000 were issued. The first issued in July 1999\namounted to P11.65 billion and the second in October 1999 to P18.6 billion. There are plans for\nlisting and trading these bonds to make them a retail product, but the plans have yet to be\nimplemented.", "Appendix 5, page 2\n57\nB. Corporate Debt Securities\n10. The corporate debt market consists of commercial papers and bonds. A majority of the\nshareholders  must  approve  bond  issues,  whereas  only  board  approval  is  required  for\ncommercial papers with less than seven years maturity. For commercial papers with longer\nmaturity, two thirds of shareholders approval is needed.\n11. Short-term commercial papers have dominated the market since they are cheaper than\nshort-term bank loans, as reserve requirements are not extended to short-term papers. Long-\nterm papers have become more common in the past few years due to stabilizing inflation. The\naverage long-term tenor is 5-7 years. Until 1994, there was little interest in the debt market from\ncorporations.\n12. SEC requires credit ratings for corporate issues, bonds as well as commercial paper.\nInterest rates on commercial papers are usually based on T-bills plus a spread determined by\nperceived risk.\n13. The secondary market in debt securities is largely inactive. There is no formalized listing\nand trading for debt securities. The PSE has developed listing rules for debt securities and SEC\nhas approved these, but listing and trading have yet to take place.\nFigure A5:  Interest Rates on Treasury Bills (January 1999-June 2001)\n18\n16\n14\n12 91-day\n10\n182-day\n8\n6 364-day\n4\n2\n0\nn l n l n\na r u t a r u t a r\nJ p J c J p J c J p\n  A O   A O   A\n9 0 1\n9 0 0\n9 0 0\n1 2 2\n  Source: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.", "Appendix 6, page 1\n58\nDEPOSITORY AND CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT\nA. The Philippine Central Depository, Inc.\n1. The 1998 G-301 recommendations require each country to have an effective and fully\ndeveloped central securities depository. In the Philippines, the Philippine Central Depository,\nInc. (PCDI) was granted an operating license by the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) in December 1996 and commenced operations on 10 January  1997 (Table A8.1).\nSecurities held at the PCDI are actually \u201cimmobilized\u201d through the use of large, consolidated\nshare certificates. These certificates are referred to as \u201cjumbos\u201d by the PCDI (an average 5,215\ncertificates went to the jumbo inventory in 2000). PCDI provides safe custody and securities\nsettlement services for both debt and equity securities. Securities are lodged with PCDI and\nregistered in the name of the PCDI Nominee Corporation as trustee.\n2. Settlement  of  transactions  is  effected  through  debits  and  credits  on  the  securities\naccounts of participants maintained by PCDI. The computerized book-entry system known as\nBES is currently adopted by PCDI to achieve the book entry transfers between buyers and\nsellers. PCDI currently handles the securities being actively traded on the Philippine Stock\nExchange  (PSE).  PCDI  also  provides  nominee  services  for  distribution  of  information  and\nbenefit entitlements to participants, and bureau services through which participants make use of\nthe computer facilities of PCDI for the back-office administration.\n3. The securities that are eligible in the book-entry system of PCDI are equity securities\n(stocks listed in PSE) and debt securities (treasury bills and treasury bonds). However, PCDI\ncurrently has only equities on deposit. The system does have the capability to handle debt\nsecurities when the market is ready for such a service.\nB. The Securities Clearing Corporation of the Philippines\n4. The  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  of  the  Philippines  (SCCP)  is  a  privately  owned\ncorporation (Table A6.1). SEC authorized SCCP in 1998 to provide clearance and settlement\nservices for trades executed on the PSE. The functions and services SCCP provides include\nimplementing delivery-versus-payment (DVP), clearing and settling PSE trades, maintaining and\nadministrating of the Clearing and Trade Guarantee Fund, and risk monitoring and management.\n5. SCCP acts with three agencies to effect delivery of the securities and cash elements to\nthe trading counterparties as specified in the trade contracts: (i) PSE \u2013 provides direct primary\ninput of trade contracts as an electronic feed from PSE\u2019s information system; (ii) PCDI \u2013\nperforms the book-entry transfer of securities from the seller to the buyer; (iii) settlement bank \u2013\nperforms the physical transfer of cash from the buyer to the seller.\n6. The clearing and settlement process is supported by an electronic data processing\nsystem  called  FINTRACS,  which  is  a  joint  venture  with  PCDI.  SCCP  guarantees  a  DVP\nsettlement and has adopted a trade-for-trade settlement system for all the eligible trades.\n                                                          \n1  The Group of Thirty, established in 1978, is a private, nonprofit, international body composed of very senior\nrepresentatives of the private and public sectors and academia.

Delivery versus payment (DVP) represents the simultaneous exchange of securities (the\ndeliver side) and cash value (payment) to settle a transaction. DVP features the concept of a\nsafe and efficient settlement system. This concept is also one of the G30 recommendations.  As\nthe term DVP itself implies, the concept contains two major parts: the delivery part and the\npayment part. The delivery part refers to the delivery of securities from a seller to a buyer, the\npayment part is the delivery of funds from the buyer to the seller. If there is a time lag between\nthese two parts, one of the transaction\u2019s counterparties will be exposed to the risk of the other\nparty to complete delivery. Therefore, the goal of a sound DVP is to achieve a simultaneous\nexchange of securities and payment.\n8. To achieve a DVP with high security and efficiency, two aspects of the transaction need\nto be considered. The settlement mechanism\u2019s ability to move securities and funds positions at\nthe same time is the first concern. The second is the quality of the payment that is exchanged.\nThe exchanging security position by depositories is comparatively simple because depository\ncontrols the securities as well as the participant records, and is, thus, free to apply debits and\ncredits to these accounts as necessary.  However, the payment system is difficult to control.\nThat is because both the clearing and settlement organizations (and their participants) may\nhave access to a payment system for processing the required exchange of funds, but neither\ncontrols a market\u2019s payment system.  Therefore, the goal is to ensure that both payment and\nsettlement of security position are \u201cgood.\u201d Nevertheless, due to the dynamics between the\nclearing  and  settlement  organizations  and  the  payment  system,  this  goal  is  not  always\nreachable.  The  diverse  characteristics  of  the  market\u2019s  payment  system  result  in  various\npossibilities for achieving DVP.\n9. The report from the Committee on Payment and Settlement System gives three broad\nstructural approaches to achieving DVP:\n(i) Model 1 - Simultaneous finality of securities transfer and cash transfer. Examples\nof model 1 systems include Euroclaer, Fedwire, and Cedel. This model is best in\nterms of risk control.\n(ii) Model 2 - Final transfer of securities prior to final cash transfer but against\nguarantee by reliable banks. An example of this is the Central Gilts Office in the\nUnited Kingdom.\n(iii) Model 3 - Provisional transfer of securities becomes final when final cash transfer\nis made. If the cash is not paid, the securities credit will be reversed. Finality is\nconditional  on  information  as  to  the  availability  of  funds  for  purposes  of\nsettlement.\nTable A6.2:  Chronology of the Implementation of DVP in PCDI and SCCP\nTimetable Progress of Implementation\nJanuary 1997 PCDI began operations (for securities settlement).\nDecember 1998 SCCP was given provisional license, DVP Model 2 was implemented \u2013\ngross settlement for securities and net settlement for cash.\nJuly 2000 Modified Model 2 was implemented with advance deposit of securities to\nSCCP escrow account and advance deposit of cash.\nDVP = delivery-versus-payment, PCDI = Philippine Central Depository, Inc., SCCP = Securities Clearing Corporation\nof the Philippines.\nSource: Corporate Planning and Development Department, PCDI.", "Appendix 6, page 4\n61\nD. Credit Accommodations to SCCP\u2019s DVP Implementation\n10. SCCP started implementing DVP or trade-for-trade settlement on 7 December 1998\n(Table A6.2). However, PSE directed SCCP, by virtue of its majority ownership and controlling\ninterest, to deviate from the prescribed manner of settlement. SCCP was mandated to incorporate\nvarious accommodations to its DVP implementation for broker members on a \u201ctrial run\u201d basis: (i) if\nbrokers deliver securities on T+3, they get paid at 9:00 am on T+4 when under approved SCCP\nrules they should be paid at 1:00 pm on T+4; (ii) brokers are given the privilege of drawing as\nearly as 9:00 am their Net Due Broker amount or P5 million (whichever is less) prior to the\ndelivery of the corresponding securities on T+4 at 11:00 am.\n11. The credit accommodations greatly affected the fundamental principles of DVP trade-for-\ntrade settlement. While the system strives to ensure a simultaneous exchange of cash for\nsecurities and vice-versa, the conditions imposed by PSE, which SCCP had no other choice but\nto  accept,  injected  elements  of  risk,  thereby  making  it  ineffective.  Thus,  the  two  credit\naccommodations negated the DVP principle. Therefore, SCCP was directed by an SEC order to\nimmediately stop extending credit accommodation to its participants and to strictly implement\nthe DVP settlement. These credit accommodations were removed from SCCP on 30 June 1999.\nE. Recommendations of G30 and 1995 ISSA Amendments\n12.

Major changes occurred in the financial sector over the last 10 years as a result of\nGovernment and market initiatives to strengthen financial sector management, while at the\nsame time liberalizing the sector\u2019s operations. Significant policy measures relating to Asian\nDevelopment Bank operations include the following:\n(i)  1992.  The  Capital  Market  Development  Council  was  established,  comprising\nboth  Government  and  private  sector  practitioners.  Its  task  is  to  recommend\nproposals  for  capital  market  development  in  an  integrated  and  consistent\nmanner,  and  implement  consequential  changes  in  Government  policy.  The\nCapital Market Development Council, along with the Capital Market Coordination\nCouncil composed of Government and representatives, which was set up in\n1993,  fully  endorsed  to  the  National  Economic  Development  Authority  and\nDepartment of Finance the capital market reform agenda contained in the Capital\nMarket Development Program.\n(ii)  1993. The central bank was restructured into Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP),\nallowing for more focus on and improvement of monetary management. This led\nto lower inflation (18.7 percent in 1991 to around 9 percent average during 1994-\n1996) and lower interest rates.\n(iii)  1994. Unification of the Manila and Makati stock exchanges into the Philippine\nStock  Exchange  (PSE).  This  led  to  a  rapidly  increasing  stock  market\ncapitalization until the crisis.\n(iv)  1995. The banking system was opened to foreign competitors through legislation\npassed in 1994 and in 1995. Ten foreign banks were licensed to open full service\nbranches.\n(v)  1995. BSP raised the minimum capital requirements for licensed commercial\nbanks and adopted the Basle Committee norms on capital adequacy and income\nrecognition.\n(vi)  1995-1996. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shifted its regulatory\nphilosophy from a merit-based approach to full disclosure and enforcement.\n(vii)  1996.  Philippine  Central  Depository,  Inc.  (PCDI)  and  Securities  Clearing\nCorporation  of  the  Philippines  (SCCP)  were  established.  PCDI  was  fully\noperational by the end of 1996, and SCCP by the end of 1998.\n(viii)  1995-1996. Amended laws and regulations governing financial, capital market\nand other related activities to liberalize the markets were presented to Congress\n(Securities Regulation and Enforcement Act, Revised Investment Company Act,\nCorporation Code, Financing Company Act, and Investment Houses Law).\n(ix)  1998. Regulatory responsibilities were realigned along more functional lines such\nas giving SEC jurisdiction over all investment houses and finance companies not\naffiliated with banks.", "Appendix 8, page 2\n66\n(x)  1998.

The Securities Regulation Code was enacted, providing the foundation for\ndeeper changes in capital market regulation.", "Appendix 9, page 1\n67\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n1. Taken as a whole, the Nonbank Financial Governance (NFG) Program is poor-neutral in\ndirect  impact  and  indirectly  pro-poor  in  supporting  the  three  components  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor sustainable economic growth, good\ngovernance, and social development.1 Pro-poor sustainable economic growth is to be achieved\nthrough the Program\u2019s focus on measures to increase investor confidence and restore the flow\nmuch-needed investment capital to the Philippines. This, in turn, will provide employment for\nyoung  school  leavers  who  comprise  30  percent  of  the  labor  force  but  50  percent  of  the\nunemployed. Revitalizing the moribund labor market provides income-generating opportunities\nfor the underemployed raising real wages of the working poor. The Program will strengthen\nmarket governance by improving regulation of competitive markets, restructuring the stock\nexchange and allowing it to operate more efficiently; and through improved transparency of the\nquality and quantity of reported and audited financial statements. In addition, the Program\nsupports the rationalization of distortions related to taxation policy. These measures will expand\neconomic opportunities by reversing policies that often provided protection and assistance to\nlarge and influential firms or business groups. The Program also supports the third pillar of the\npoverty reduction strategy of social development. Providing basic services such as water supply\nand sanitation requires investment with long-term payback horizons. The development of social\nprotection  programs  such  as  pensions  and  other  insurance  schemes  require  long-term\ninvestment opportunities. A competitive capital market supports the expansion of basic social\nservices and the system of social protection with private sector resources by matching the need\nfor long-term money to the need for long-term investment opportunities.\n2. The  Program  supports  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  2001-2004\n(MTPDP)  underscores  the  importance  of  macroeconomic  stability  for  broad-based  growth,\ncomprehensive  development,  and  governance  as  \u201ccrucial  for  success  in  the  fight  against\npoverty  and  high  unemployment.\u201d2  Although  significant  measures  have  been  passed  to\nstrengthen  the  regulatory  framework  for  capital  market  development,  the  chapter\nmacroeconomic stability cites the need for continued reform to develop the capital market and\nimprove  corporate  governance  to  increase  domestic  savings  for  higher  investment  without\nrunning into balance of payment and external debt problems. The MTPDP recognizes that the\nescape from poverty hinges on \u201cagricultural modernization and  rural industrialization,\u201d3 which in\nturn will depend on a vibrant small and medium-size enterprise (SME) sector supported by\nappropriate policies and access to financing.4 Appropriate policies for sustainable development\ninclude those supporting a favorable business environment.5\n3. The slowdown in growth contributed to the moribund state of the labor market. During\n2000, unemployment reached record highs from already high levels earlier. One fifth of the labor\nforce was underemployed, while real wages stagnated However, the failure of the labor market\nalso contributed to low growth. The direct causes lie with macroeconomic, industrial, and labor\nmarket policies; while indirect causes include access to financial markets, especially for SMEs\nthat would be direct beneficiaries of the Program.\n4.

Between 1997 and 2000, the proportion of households below the poverty line increased\nfrom 31.8 to 34.2 percent, and those with incomes below the food threshold6 increased from\n16.2 percent to 16.8 percent. Increased prudential standards and greater efforts to increase\ncompliance, and enforcement with rules and regulations lead to a more robust system, thereby\nreducing  its  vulnerability  to  external  shock    as  does  greater  reliance  on  domestic  capital\nmarkets.\n5. Fiscal realities constrain the expansion of basic public services. For example, one fifth of\nthe population lacks access to safe water and one fourth lacks access to electricity.  These and\nother public service investment areas with long-term financing needs such as schools, public\nhealth  centers,  feeder  ports,  and  farm-to-market  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  municipal\ngovernments with limited local resources. Access to a well developed bond market will enable\nmunicipal governments to promote access of the poor to public goods and increase their\nproductivity.  Expansion  of  the  system  for  social  protection  is  constrained  by  the  need  for\nefficient and less risky alternatives to banks in providing long term funds. Strengthening the\ncapacity of institutional investors deepens the security markets and enables the expansion of\nthe social protection system and the provision of basic public infrastructure.\n6. The Program addresses the requirements of the major actors in the capital market,\nwhich taken as a whole enable a well-regulated and efficient capital market. The only negative\nimpact in the Program results from the streamlining of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Three hundred of SEC\u2019s staff have voluntarily accepted a severance package that is\nabove the legal requirements. They were relatively young and skilled and unlikely to find undue\ndifficulties in locating other employment within the sector.  A poverty impact matrix is shown for\nthe combined Program as each component of the program contributes to the same outcome.\nTable A9: Poverty Impact of the Program\nChannel Indirect Macro Non-Poor\nLabor Increased access to capital Increased accountability and More investment funds flow\nmarkets leads to increased clarification of fiduciary into sectors, industries, and\nemployment opportunities responsibilities reduce the countries with transparent\nfor the skilled poor and possibility for market and efficient markets.

The Program will not have any direct and immediate environmental impacts. The likely\nenvironmental impacts are indirect and long-term, and most them are positive (environmentally\nbeneficial).
