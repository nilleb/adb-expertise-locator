The  buildup\nof  vulnerabilities  stemmed  from  excessive  reliance  on  bank\nfinancing, weak corporate and financial regulation, including poor\ncompliance  with  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  and\ninformation.  These\ninadequate \ndevelopments  are  inevitable  if  enforcement  and  governance  at\nthe regulator level are weak. Despite the fact that the Philippines\nwithstood the Asian financial crisis relatively well, its financial and\ncorporate  structures  continue  to  make  it  vulnerable  to  external\nshocks.  This  vulnerability  stems  from  the  uneven  application  of\ngood governance standards and lack of risk diversification in the\nfinancial  market.  Indeed,  the  Philippines  exhibits  a  very  high\ndependence on bank financing and has not been able to develop\nsufficient  levels  of  financial  intermediation  through  its  nonbank\nsector.\n\nto \n\nlaunch  broad-based \n\nTo lay the foundation for a strong and robust financial sector, the\nGovernment  needs \nfinancial  and\ncorporate  governance  reforms,  including  (i) strengthening  the\ngovernance  and  enforcement  capacity  of \nregulators,\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Bangko Sentral\nng  Pilipinas  (BSP);  (ii)  modernizing  the  securities  market;\n(iii) introducing  more  transparency  in  market  transactions;  and\n(iv) encouraging  enforcement  of  rules  and  regulations.  These\nreforms  are  critical  to  meet  the  challenges  of  growing  volatility\nfrom  a  weak  stock  exchange,  competitive  pressures  from\ntechnological innovation, as well as globalization and integration\nof financial markets.\n\nthe \n\nObjective and\nScope\n\nThe  Program  will  support  the  process  of  capital  formation\nthrough improved corporate governance in the nonbank financial\nservices sector. The key components of Phase I are\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nenhancing  and  strengthening  the  governance  of\nSEC  by  (a)  allowing  SEC  greater  administrative,\nfinancial  autonomy;  and\noperational,  and \nenforcement\n(b) enhancing  monitoring \ncapacity;\nmodernizing \n\nthe  governance  and \n\nregulatory\n\nand \n\n\fiii\n\nby \n(b) \n\nfor  PSE \n\nstructure of the Philippine Stock Exchange  (PSE)\nby  (a)  developing  arrangements \nto\nstrengthen  its  governance  during  the  transition\nperiod,  (b) restructuring  and  demutualizing  PSE;\n(c)  enhancing  self-regulatory  organization  (SRO)\nreporting,  and  (d) developing  arrangements  for\neffective regulation of PSE;\nstrengthening  market  oversight,  compliance,  and\ndeveloping  market\nenforcement \nprudential\ngovernance, \nregulation  of  nonbank \ninstitutions,\n(c) preventing misconduct and market abuse, and\n(d) \nand\ngovernance  by  strengthening  financial  disclosure\nmonitoring; and\nfacilitating  diversification  and \nin\ncorporate  financing  by  (a)  developing  a  policy,\nregulatory,  and \nfor \nthe\n(b) enhancing\ncorporate  bond  market;  and \ninstitutional  investors\u2019  participation  to  augment\nmarket liquidity.\n\n(a) \nstrengthening \nfinancial \n\nfinancial  management \n\nframework \n\ninnovation \n\nimproving \n\ntaxation \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nPhase  II  will  consist  of  policy  actions  based  on  the  Agenda  for\nPhase  II  Dialogue.  These  actions,  when  agreed  between  the\nGovernment  and  ADB,  may  form  the  basis  of  future  ADB\nassistance  to  the  Government  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector.\nThe  Agenda  for  Phase  II  Dialogue  includes  the  following  Core\nTopics\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nimplementing demutualization of PSE;\nstrengthening market regulation;\nstrengthening \ncompliance; and\nfacilitating  diversification  and \ncorporate financing.\n\nmarket \n\ngovernance \n\nand\n\ninnovation \n\nin\n\nClassification\n\nEconomic growth\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory C\n\nThe ADB Loan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nA  loan  of  $75  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s\n(ADB\u2019s) ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s\nLIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a\ncommitment  charge  of  0.75  percent  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee\nof 1.0 percent; and conversion options that may be exercised in\naccordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan\n\nlending \n\n\fiv\n\nRegulations, and ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines; and other terms\nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  The  loan\nclosing date is 31 December 2002.\n\nProgram Period\n\n            and Tranching\n\nThe Phase I of the Program is three years (1998-2001). The loan\nwill  be  released  in  one  tranche,  which  will  be  made  available\nupon loan effectiveness.\n\nExecuting\nAgency\n\nProcurement\n\nCounterpart\nFunds\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nThe Department of Finance (DOF) will be the Executing Agency\nfor the NFG Program and SEC will be the Implementing Agency.\nSEC  will  set  up  a  coordinating  committee  headed  by  the\nChairperson  of  SEC  and  comprising  representatives \nfrom\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Bureau of Treasury, DOF, National\nEconomic  and  Development  Authority,  PSE,  SEC,  and  the\nCapital  Market  Development  Council  that  consists  of  members\nfrom  business  and  industry  associations.  ADB  will  also  be  a\nmember of this committee to oversee progress on Phase II of the\nreform program.\n\nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange\ncosts of items produced and procured in ADB member countries\n(other  than  items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and\nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The\nGovernment  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports\nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the\nloans  for  the  given  period.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the\nuse  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s certification.\n\nThe  Government  will  utilize  local  currency  counterpart  funds\ngenerated  by  the  loan  to  meet  program  expenditures  and\nassociated costs of reform and to help maintain current levels of\nsocial expenditures.  The structural adjustment costs for Phase I\nstem  from  restructuring  SEC,  administrative  reforms  linked  to\ncomputerization  of  SRO,  monitoring  systems  in  SEC  and  PSE,\nand demutualization costs already borne by SEC and PSE.\n\nThe advisory TA of $1 million will strengthen market governance\nby  developing  (i)  an  effective  SRO  framework  to  address  the\npotential  conflicts  of  interest  in  PSE\u2019s  newly  demutualized\nownership structure; (ii) SEC capacity to investigate and enforce\nmarket  rules;  (iii)  an  efficient  management  information  system\nand staff training in the use of these systems; and (iv) accounting\nand  auditing  skills  and  standards.  The  TA  will  be  financed  from\nthe  Asian  Currency  Crisis  Support  Facility  funded  by  the\nGovernment  of  the  Japan.  It  is  estimated  that  about  22  person-\nmonths of international and 16 domestic consulting services will\nbe required.  All consultants will be engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory \nfor  recruiting  domestic\nconsultants.\n\nto  ADB \n\n\fv\n\nRisks and Safeguards\n\nThe  Program  faces  four  major  risks.  First,  the  widening  fiscal\ndeficit  and  growing  nonperforming  loans  of  the  banking  sector\ncould  disrupt  macroeconomic  stability  or  exacerbate  banking\nsector  fragility.  Recognizing  this,  the  new  Government  has\nindicated its resolve to adopt more fiscal dicpline and launch tax\nreforms  to  support  macroeconomic  stability.  At  the  same  time,\nthe  Government  is  taking  steps  to  deal  with  the  weaknesses  of\nthe banking sector.\n\nSecond,  reforms  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector  PSE  critically\ndepend  on  the  support  of  the  private  sector  including  the\nmembers  of  PSE.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  have  wider\nconsultations \nto  evolve  consensus  among \nthe  different\nstakeholders  and  to  take  advance  actions  to  ensure  that\ndemutualization of PSE is realized.\n\nThird,  effective  Program  implementation  is  dependent  upon\ndeveloping  capacities  across  the  nonbank  financial  sector.\nIncreasing  the  skills  of  regulators,  accountants,  and  auditors  is\nnecessary  if  regulations  and  standards  are  to  be  enforced  and\ncomplied  with.  The  Program  has  introduced  a  wide-ranging\ncapacity  building  element  in  the  TA  to  SEC.  In  addition,  the\nProgram  supports  the  introduction  of  a  more  competitive  salary\nstructure for SEC to retain qualified staff to mitigate this risk.\n\nFourth,  reliance  on  enactment  of  legislation  has  proven  to  be\ndifficult  in  the  context  of  the  Philippines.  The  Program  has\nfocused  on  ensuring  that  current  market  regulations,  if  found\nsatisfactory,  are  adequately  enforced. \nin\nregulations  are  required,  alternatives  to  legislative  action  will  be\nexplored through rules and administrative orders. In addition, up-\nfront compliance on all actions requiring legislation was required to\naddress possible delays in Program implementation.\n\nimprovements \n\nIf \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\nloan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Nonbank Financial Governance (NFG) Program.\nThe  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  for  Strengthening  Regulatory  and\nMarket Governance, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority\ndelegated to me by the Board, shall approve the technical assistance.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe  Philippines  withstood  the  Asian  financial  crisis  well,  but  faced  renewed  and\n2.\nin  2000  as  economic  management  and  governance1  steadily\nformidable  challenges \ndeteriorated. Economic decision making came to a virtual standstill in late 2000 following public\nscrutiny of corruption scandals in both the banking sector and capital markets. Growing political\nuncertainty  combined  with  stock  market  vulnerabilities  led  to  a  sharp  decline  in  the  peso  and\nstock market indices to historic lows, and triggered slippages in fiscal deficit targets. Attempts to\ncounteract the weakness in the exchange rate by monetary tightening led to high interest rates\nthat generated more economic instability and uncertainty.\n\n3.\nNevertheless,  the  Philippines  showed  remarkable  resilience  in  withstanding  both  the\nregional crisis of 1997 and the subsequent political turmoil that gripped the country throughout\n2000. The new millenium, however, brings with it renewed economic promises and prospects.\nSupported  by  people  power,  the  country  witnessed  its  second  peaceful  democratic  transition\nfollowing the takeover by Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the office of the President\non  20  January  2001.  Rebuilding  investor  and  public  confidence  in  the  economic  and  political\nsystem  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  the  President\u2019s  economic  agenda.  Recent  political  events\nhave  brought  some  degree  of  economic  and  financial  stability.  However,  stock  market\nvulnerabilities  continue  to  reflect  the  underlying  weakness  in  economic  fundamentals,  lack  of\ninvestor confidence in a thin and weakly governed stock exchange, and the adverse effects of\nrecent exuberance and turmoil in the world stock markets.\n\n4.\nThe  primary  challenge  facing  the  new  Government  is  to  introduce  effective  economic\nand political governance and management. The new administration has been swift to recognize\nthe  urgency  of  the  task  and  has  indicated  its  resolve  to  rebuild  the  economy  by  (i)  instilling\nmacroeconomic discipline; (ii) developing strong and robust financial markets; (iii) refocusing on\npoverty  reduction;  and  (iv)  promoting  a  culture  of  rule  of  law,  accountability,  efficiency,  and\nentrepreneurship.\n\n5.\nThe  medium-term  economic  framework  of  the  Government  integrates  the  objectives  of\nthe Post-Program Monitoring agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) finalized in\nApril  2001.  IMF  had  established  a  $1.4  billion  standby  credit  facility  under  a  Memorandum  of\nEconomic and Financial Policies in 1998. The Government was able to draw over $1 billion on\nthis facility, but it waived the final tranche of approximately $336 million as it felt that it would not\nbe  able  to  meet  the  fiscal  targets  and  structural  reform  benchmarks  agreed  upon  with  IMF.\nCurrently, the Government is taking steps to curb the growth in the fiscal deficit within the Post-\nProgram Monitoring framework of IMF.\n\n6.\nDespite  political  disruptions,  the  new  Government  stated  its  commitment  to  stimulating\ngrowth  by  addressing  long-term  structural  issues  and  constraints.  This  would,  however,  only  be\n\n                                                          \n1  Governance refer to accountability, predictability, participation, and transparency.\n\n\f2\n\npossible if it is able to launch an effective strategy for resource mobilization in both the public and\nprivate  sectors.  On  the  public  sector  side,  the  fiscal  distress  has  called  for  renewed  attention  to\nreforms  in  domestic  taxation.  However,  the  private  sector  will  need  to  meet  the  bulk  of  resource\nrequirements  through  improved  financial  intermediation.  Recognizing  this,  the  Government\nlaunched several initiatives to support a stronger and more robust banking system and to broaden\nand deepen the capital markets since the onset of the crisis in late 1997. These measures have\nyielded mixed results.\n\nToday, the Philippines has one of the most independent central banks, Bangko Sentral ng\n7.\nPilipinas  (BSP),  in  the  region,  and  has  developed  an  effective  monetary  management  system.\nWith the support of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), BSP has led a complex\nand wide-scale bank-restructuring program over the past year. This has involved closure of one\nbank, merger of four of the larger banks into two banks, and merger of two smaller banks into the\ncountry\u2019s largest bank. In addition, the Philippine National Bank (PNB) required P10 billion liquidity\nassistance from the PDIC in 2000. To enhance the soundness of the banking system, BSP has\ntaken  additional  steps  to  (i) limit  a  bank\u2019s  transactional  capacity;  (ii) require  regular  reporting  of\ndelinquent and restructured loans; (iii) introduce higher statutory capital and bad loan provisioning;\nand (iv) require bank disclosure on interest rates, nonperforming loans (NPLs), and higher quality\nreporting standards, etc.\n\nThe  financial  markets  were  buffeted  by  the  sharp  withdrawal  of  capital  from  the\n8.\nPhilippines,  the  subsequent  peso  depreciation,  and  the  BW  Resources2  scandal  involving\nallegations  of  stock  price  manipulation  by  a  number  of  brokers,  followed  by  allegations  of\npolitical  interference  in  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  investigations.  These\ndevelopments  created  an  atmosphere  that  eroded  both  investor  confidence  and  the  gains\nachieved in financial markets in the mid-1990s. Market capitalization went from the 1996 precrisis\nlevel of P2,122 billion to P1,251 billion in 1997 before recovering to P2,578 billion by end-2000.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\n9.\nagreed  to  broaden  and  deepen  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector,\ncomplementing  and  building  on  the  reforms  initiated  under  the  Capital  Market  Development\nProgram (CMDP) loan in 1995.3 The proposed NFG Program will support broader and deeper\nreforms in the nonbank financial sector. With this objective, ADB approved TA4 to the nonbank\nfinancial sector in 1999. This TA complemented bilateral assistance primarily from the  United\nStates Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nThe  proposed  NFG  Program  was  formulated  based  on  (i)  lessons  learned  from\n10.\nimplementing  the  CMDP,  (ii)  economic  and  sector  work  launched  between  1998  and  2000,\n(iii) the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  ADB  TA  (footnote  4),  and  (iv)  the  consensus  in\nboth ADB and the Government on the need to enhance financial market governance. Extensive\npolicy dialogue has been maintained with the Government over the past two years. ADB fielded\na  Reconnaissance  Mission  in  August  1999  and  a  Fact-Finding  Mission5  in  October  2000  to\nreach  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives  and  scope  of  the  proposed\nProgram. The development policy letter, the policy matrix, and the agenda for Phase II dialogue\nof the NFG Program are in Appendix 1. The program framework is in Appendix 2.\n\n                                                          \n2  This company was renamed Fairmont Holdings, Inc. in 2000.\n3 Loan 1363-PHI: Capital Market Development Program, for $150 million, approved on 22 August 1995.\n4  TA 3245-PHI: Nonbank Financial Sector Development, for $2 million, approved on 25 August 1999.\n5  The  Mission  comprised  N.  Chakwin,  Mission  Leader,  Senior  Financial  Economist;  A.  Malmstrom,  Financial\n\nEconomist; and E. Chen, Young Professional.\n\n\f3\n\nIII.\n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\n\nA.\n\nGovernment Development Objectives, Strategy, and Plans\n\nThe Government\u2019s economic strategy and plans, articulated in the revised New Medium-\n11.\nTerm  Philippine  Development  Plan:  2001-2004,  advocate  adoption  of  a  sustainable\ndevelopment  path  anchored  by  economic  growth  with  social  equity.  Stated  objectives  include\nreducing  the  incidence  of  poverty,  improving  employment  rates,  and  stabilizing  prices.  To\nachieve  these  goals,  a  development  program  was  launched  to  raise  basic  social  indicators,\nimprove  access  to  basic  services,  and  increase  agricultural  productivity  and  diversification.\nComplementing these efforts, the Government aims to establish a globally competitive industry\nsector  based  on  further  trade  liberalization,  and  enhanced  technology  in  the  industrial\nenvironment.6 Adherence to a fiscal stabilization program is critical to allow for adequate growth\nin public investment and to avoid crowding out the private sector. Concurrently, the Government\nneeds to revive private savings and investments by strengthening and diversifying the financial\nintermediation process and by promoting the expansion of equity and debt markets.\n\n12.\nThe  Government  adopted  a  broad-ranging  privatization  program  starting  in  1992.  The\nobjective  was  to  generate  revenue,  stimulate  capital  markets,  and  introduce  greater  economic\nefficiency.  Privatization  proceeds  fell  significantly  short  of  the  P22  billion  target  in  2000.  To\ngenerate resources, the Department of Finance (DOF) issued PROgress bonds in August 2000.\nThese  bonds  allowed  investors  to  swap  the  bonds  for  shares  of  companies,  or  the  cash\nequivalent of state assets being privatized. The 5-year bonds have a fixed coupon rate of 13.9\npercent  per  annum  payable  every  quarter.  Among  the  state  corporations  in  which  shares  are\nbeing auctioned are Manila Electric Co. (Meralco), the Philippines National Construction Corp,\nthe Philippines National Oil Co. \u2013 Energy Development Corp., IBC Channel 13, Food Terminal,\nInc.,  Philippine  Postal  Corp.,  and  the  Philippine  Phosphate  Fertilizer  Corp.  In  addition,  ADB  is\nassisting  in  privatizing  the  National  Power  Corporation.  The  proceeds  from  the  privatization\nprogram will generate revenues to ease budgetary pressures (para. 22).\n\n13.\nEconomic recovery was notable in early 2000 after a significant slowdown in real gross\ndomestic  product  (GDP)  growth  during  1997  and  1998.  The  impact  of  the  regional  financial\ncrisis  was  compounded  by  a  decline  in  agricultural  production  because  of  drought  conditions\naccompanying El Ni\u00f1o and later the typhoons related to the La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon. To mitigate\nthe  shock,  the  Government  adopted  measures  to  improve  liquidity  management,  stabilize  the\npeso,  and  strengthen  the  financial  system.  Supporting  the  drive  toward  better  economic\nmanagement, the Government enacted critical pieces of legislation during 2000:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSecurities  Regulation  Code  (SRC),  which  elevates  the  role  and  power  of  SEC\u2013\nconsistent  with  the  proposed    Program\u2013in  overseeing  and  regulating  market\nactivity;\nGeneral  Banking  Act,  which  includes  provisions  to  align  rules  and  regulations\nwith international standards and guidelines;\nRetail  Trade  Liberalization  Act,  which  permits  foreign  ownership  of  local  retail\nstores, with capital of more than $2.5 million; and\nElectronic  Commerce  Act,  which  provides  a  legal  foundation  for  electronic\ntransactions  and \nfor  computer  hacking  and  piracy.\nImplementing guidelines are being drafted with a view to incorporating guidelines\nfor securities transactions and electronic banking.\n\nintroduces  penalties \n\n                                                          \n6  TA 3345-PHI: Strengthen Export Competitiveness, for $1 million, approved on 17 December 1999.\n\n\f4\n\n14.\nIn addition, the Government plans to (i) strengthen fiscal management by launching tax\nreforms and confining public expenditure, and (ii) stabilize prices, interest rates, and the peso.\nThe  banking  sector,  restructured  in  the  early  1990s,  initially  appeared  to  weather  the  Asian\nfinancial  crisis  relatively  well.  However,  persistent  economic  instability  has  resulted  in\ndeterioration in asset and portfolio quality, and stagnation in new lending and credit growth. The\nGovernment  and  BSP  have  taken  a  number  of  steps  to  encourage  bank  consolidation,  raise\nminimum capital and provisioning requirements, and introduce a moratorium on bank branching\nand upgrading of licenses. Mergers have occurred or been announced between the PCI Bank\nand Equitable Banking Corporation, and Bank of the Philippine Islands and Far East Bank and\nTrust Company; and acquisition of Asian Bank and Philbanking Corporation by Global Bank, a\nsubsidiary of Metrobank.\n\n15.\nBSP has started a program to improve internal systems and procedures, and strengthen\nbanking  supervision  practices.  Under  the  new  program,  BSP  introduced  a  systemic  failure\ncontingency  plan,  issued  further  guidelines  for  prompt  corrective  action,  stepped  up  on-site\ninspections, and improved coordination between BSP and PDIC in resolving distressed banks. In\naddition, BSP is now monitoring bank groups on a consolidated basis and has strengthened early\nwarning systems to detect banking weaknesses. SEC and BSP are working on a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (MOU) to improve the monitoring of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), which\nare affiliates or subsidiaries of banks. Steps are under way to implement the new real time gross\nsettlement  (RTGS)  system,  which  will  facilitate  central  bank  clearing  and  settlement  of  all\npayments.  The  RTGS  system  will  support  a  true  delivery  versus  payment  system  and  thereby\nreduce  risks  in  payment,  clearing,  and  settlement.  The  final  tests  for  the  RTGS  system  are\nexpected to be completed and the system to be fully on-line by the end of 2001.\n\n16.\nThe  most  far-reaching  reform  in  the  banking  sector  is  the  enactment  of  the  General\nBanking  Act  2000.  This  law  (i)  mandates  banks  to  meet  capital  adequacy  in  line  with\ninternational standards; (ii) allows foreign ownership of a local bank to be raised from 30 percent\nto 40 percent of the voting stock, and under certain conditions, up to a maximum of 100 percent;\n(iii) authorizes  BSP  to  conduct  regular  investigations  to  determine  whether  a  bank  or  its\naffiliates,  are  conducting  business  in  an  unsound  manner;  and  (iv)  restores  the  power  of  the\nMonetary Board to remove or suspend directors and officers involved in misconduct.\n\nB. \n\nRecent Economic Performance and Prospects\n\nA combination of factors affected economic performance in the Philippines during 2000.\n17.\nThe most significant were the persistent political uncertainty, weak economic management, and\nregional  vulnerabilities.  Despite  these  disruptions,  economic  recovery  continued  as  real  GDP\ngrew by 4.2 percent in 2000 compared with 3.7 percent in 1999. Economic growth in 2000 was\nsupported  by  agricultural  growth,  boosted  by  favorable  weather  conditions,  and  a  5.6  percent\nrise in manufacturing. The industry sector, however, has remained sluggish due to a slowdown\nin construction.\n\nThe  manufacturing  sector  continues  to  be  plagued  by  weakening  corporate  profitability\n18.\n(declining by 25-40 percent in 2000) as a result of higher interest rates, import and energy costs,\nand  lower  demand.  Philippine  companies  with  foreign  currency  obligations  have  been  facing\nsteadily  higher  principal  and  interest  payments  in  peso  terms.  These  costs  have  hit  company\nearnings and contributed to declines in the debt service capacity of corporations. As a result of the\nrise in operating costs and debt obligations, a number of companies filed requests with SEC for\n\n\f5\n\nrelief  from  debt  service  obligations  in  1999  and  2000.  In  addition,  many  companies  postponed\nnew projects, thus constraining industrial production and contributing to growth of unemployment.\n\n19.\nThe  unemployment  rate  in  the  Philippines  has  averaged  over  10  percent  from  1999  to\n2000.  This  is  2-3  times  the  rate  in  other  countries  of  the  Association  of  South  East  Asian\nNations  (ASEAN)  during  the  same  period.  Although  the  unemployment  rate  reached  11.2\npercent  in  2000,  employment  generation  was  strong  during  the  1990s  relative  to  neighboring\nASEAN countries. However, job creation has not been fast enough to absorb labor and reduce\nunemployment,  as  the  labor  force  continues  to  grow  by  about  2.5  percent  annually.  Rising\nproductivity and stable manufacturing employment levels indicate that there has been little labor\nshedding as a result of the crisis and lingering economic problems. Maintaining higher growth\nlevels, and keeping pace with the population growth will be pivotal to reducing unemployment in\na long-term sustainable manner.\n\n20.\nPerformance in the real sector was overshadowed by the growing fiscal distress in 2000,\nas the national budget deficit reached P136 billion (3.9 percent of gross national product [GNP])\n\u2013 more than double the IMF target of P62.5 billion (1.8 percent of GNP). Budgetary pressures\ncontinued throughout the year as tax revenues fell short of budget requirements. The budgetary\nshortfall  was  attributed  to  a  weak  tax  base,7  poor  collection  systems  and  procedures,  and  the\nGovernment\u2019s inability to realize the proceeds from the stalled privatization program (para. 12).8\nPublic  spending  was  to  some  extent  tightened.  Total  revenue/GNP  fell  by  3.3  from  1996  to\n2000, while public spending/GNP rose by 0.4 over this period. To meet the budgetary financing\ngap, the Government borrowed from the domestic and overseas markets and drew down funds\nfrom  the  standby  credit  facility  under  an  IMF  program  outlined  in  a  1998  Memorandum  of\nto  make  monetary\nEconomic  and  Financial  Policies.  Budgetary  pressures  continued \nmanagement  difficult  as  Government  borrowings  rose  to  5.7  percent  of  GDP  and  induced\ninterest rate pressures. The addition of new Government contingent liabilities indicates that debt\nservice  levels  equivalent  to  31  percent  of  budgetary  expenditures  will  remain  a  Government\nconcern.\n\n21.\nThe  external  current  account  surplus  grew  to  $9  billion  in  2000.  This  represents  a  23\npercent  growth  over  the  1999  level  and  can  principally  be  attributed  to  export  growth,  led  by\nelectronics  (approximately  58  percent  of  exports).  Additional  factors  include  the  slowdown  in\nimports  and  weak  domestic  demand.  Despite  the  buildup  of  the  external  current  account\nsurplus, the balance of payments position in 2000 was in deficit on an aggregate basis due to\nthe  capital  account.  A  primary  factor  was  the  reemergence  of  a  net  outflow  of  portfolio  equity\ninvestments  ($335  million)9  slightly  lower  than  the  1997  crisis-related  outflows  ($406  million).\nNet foreign direct investment was more stable recovering to $2.1 billion, 10 percent higher than\n1999 levels. By year-end, it was evident that Government access to credit from multilateral and\nbilateral sources, as well as recourse to commercial credit had dwindled significantly during the\nyear.\n\n22.\nBanking  sector  problems  have  also  compounded  difficulties  in  sustaining  economic\nrecovery.  Domestic  commercial  banks  continued  to  weaken,  as  growth  of  bank  deposits  and\ncredit declined. Banking sector NPLs more than doubled from 7.4 percent in 1998 to almost 20\n\n                                                          \n7  Tax collection efficiency declined from 17 percent in 1997 to under 14 percent in 2000.\n8  Almost  24  percent  of  the  slippage  in  the  budget  deficit  in  2000  occurred  because  of  the  nonrealization  of\n\nprivatization proceeds.\n\n9 In 1996, portfolio equity investment was close to $2 billion.\n\n\f6\n\npercent in 2001.10 The steady decline in bank asset quality is attributable to a variety of factors:\n(i) interest pressures, (ii) more stringent reclassification of loans in the newly merged banks, and\n(iii) a slowdown in asset growth. In addition, the Government\u2019s plan to privatize PNB11 has been\ndelayed.  This  delay  in  restructuring  PNB  has  resulted  in  deposit  withdrawals  and  continuing\ngrowth  in  NPLs.  To  avert  a  crisis,  the  Government  intervened  to  support  the  deteriorating\nbalance  sheet.  Government  support  has  involved  liquidity  assistance  of  P10  billion  from  PDIC\nand  a  P15  billion  loan  from  BSP  to  purchase  NPLs  from  PNB.  The  assistance  constitutes  the\nlargest bailout in Philippines banking history and was provided as PNB represents 7 percent of\nbanking sector assets. To reduce NPLs, the Government is considering a number of proposals,\namong them transferring NPLs to an asset management company or banks swapping debt for\nequity in corporations.\n\nIn  the  wake  of  the  global  slowdown,  the  Philippines  like  other  regional  economies  is\n23.\nexperiencing slower-than-expected growth. Investor confidence has not yet been restored and\nthe  peso  has  remained  below  P50=$1.  As  of  October  2001,  the  central  bank  borrowing  and\nlending  rates  have  been  reduced  to  8.75  percent  and  11  percent,  respectively.  Real  GDP  is\nprojected  to  grow  by  2.5-3.0  percent  in  2001,  given  the  lingering  domestic  uncertainties,  weak\nexternal  environment,  and  structural  issues  facing  the  economy.  The  main  domestic  challenge\nfacing  the  Philippines  is  how  to  stop  the  deterioration  in  public  finances  and  keep  budgetary\npressures within manageable limits. The Government budget for 2001 projects a deficit of around\n4.0 percent. The fall in revenues over the past four years, together with peso depreciation, have\nincreased  public  sector  debt  to  almost  66  percent  of  GNP.  While  keeping  control  on  the  budget\ndeficit,  the  Government  plans  to  pursue  a  tight  monetary  policy  to  bring  down  the  inflation  rate.\nWith  the  July  year-on-year  inflation  rate  reaching  6.8  percent  (the  year-end  level  for  2000),\nmaintaining price stability may prove challenging in the second half of the year.\n\n24.\nStrengthening the banking sector is critical, given that the NPLs of some domestic banks\nhave surpassed BSP\u2019s expected peak of 19-20 percent. Given the stress in the sector and the\ninterest  and  exchange  rate  environment,  commercial  banks  have  maintained  high  capital\nadequacy ratios averaging over 15 percent.12 In addition, a few episodes over the past year of\nruns  on  bank  deposit  resulted  in  large  withdrawals  from  several  banks,  indicating  wavering\ndepositor confidence in the banking system. Authorities were able to quickly contain the systemic\nrisks  posed  by  these  withdrawals  through  a  combination  of  liquidity  support  and  new  capital\ninjections  by  existing  owners.  However,  there  is  some  risk  that  weak  banks  might  require\nadditional liquidity support and thereby complicate monetary policy.\n\nThe  external  sector  is  becoming  more  vulnerable,  with  the  value  of  exports  for  the  first\n25.\neight  months  of  2001  declining  by  13  percent.  This  follows  growth  of  9  percent  in  2000  and  19\npercent in 1999. This is especially important in the context of the Philippines where there is a high\ndependence on markets in the United States and Japan. Despite the rise in capital outflows, the\nPhilippines  does  not  face  significant  debt  servicing  pressures  in  the  near  future.  Debt  service\npayments are projected at 17 percent of exports of goods and services in 2001; reserves cover\n260 percent of short-term debt (or 4.2 months of imports); and the rollover risk for interbank credit\n\n                                                          \n10 The  international  banks  nonperforming  loans  have  remained  steady  at  about  3  percent  while  those  of  domestic\nbanks have continued to grow , averaging over 25 percent, and those of the Philippine National bank (PNB) over\n30 percent.\n\n11 This  was  a  condition  for  disbursing  the  remaining  tranches  of  the  World  Bank:  Banking Sector Reform Loan,  of\n$300 million, approved in 1998. The loan was cancelled because the rehabilitation of PNB will require a longer time\nand more sustained effort than were originally anticipated.\n\n12  The  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  two  universal  banks  (one  was  PNB)  has  dipped  below  the  statutory  norm  of\n\n10 percent since end-2000 (although both have been above 8 percent).\n\n\f7\n\nlines appears limited, given that net foreign liabilities of private commercial banks have declined\nfrom $6 billion in 1997 to $3.5 billion in 2000. Finally, the Government\u2019s commitment to improve\nthe business climate was affirmed as it recently enacted the anti-money laundering law in line with\nthe Financial Action Task Force 40 recommendations.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE SECTOR\n\nA.\n\nBackground and Recent Performance\n\n1. \n\nOverview of the Nonbank Financial Sector\n\n26.\nThe nonbank financial sector is a major source of savings and supplier of funds to the\nprivate sector. NBFIs provide a wide range of financial services: lending, investing, or placement\nof  equity  and  debt  instruments.  Almost  70  percent  of  nonbank  financial  sector  assets  are\ngenerated from contractual savings institutions and 30 percent from investment houses handling\nunderwriting  and  money  market  operations,  financing  companies  engaged  in  lending  and\nleasing  activities,  and  independent  fund  managers  managing  mutual  funds.13  The  nonbank\nfinancial  sector  includes  securities  brokers  and  dealers,  financing  companies,  and  investment\nhouses  (Table  1).  NBFIs  act  in  the  capacity  of  a  fiduciary  managing  the  money  of  clients\nthrough  investment  companies  (mutual  funds)  and  pre-need  companies.  The  assets  of\nnumerous  (over  6,000)  neighborhood  lending  investors  and  pawnshops  account  for  less  than\n1 percent of financial sector assets. As many of these small businesses are affiliated with banks\nor  financing  companies,  it  is  anticipated  that  they  will  face  pressures  to  merge  or  liquidate\nassets. The SEC has already started to issue rules to consolidate lending investors.\n\nTable 1:  Selected Nonbank Financial Sector Participants\n(1998-2000)\n\nType of Entity\n\nNumber\n\nSecurities Brokers/Dealers\n\nInvestment Houses\n\n    With Quasi Bank License\n\nMutual Fund Managers\n\n    Stock Funds\n\n    Balanced Funds\n\n    Bond Funds\n\nFinancing companies\n\n    With Quasi Bank License\n\nPre-need Companies\n\nTotal Assets\n(P million)\n113,297a\n37,924a\n32,935a\n\n6,129\n\n1,516\n\n1,703\n\n2,909\n\n55,352\n\n13,720\n\n130,303\n\n168\n\n37\n\n7\n\n20\n\n6\n\n10\n\n4\n\n177\n\n7\n\n52\n\n                  a Based on audited financial statements.\n\n    Sources:  Securities and Exchange Commission and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.\n\n                                                          \n13 At present, the country has over 7,000 nonbank financial institutions.\n\n\f8\n\n2.\n\nRegulatory Framework\n\n27.\nSEC  regulates  the  capital  market,  and  licenses  and  supervises  self-regulatory\norganizations  (SROs)14  including  Philippine  Stock  Exchange  (PSE),  the  Philippine  Central\nDepository,  Inc.  (PCDI),  and  the  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  of  the  Philippines  (SCCP).\nSEC  also  oversees  company  registration  and  the  conduct  of  market  participants.  BSP  is  also\ninvolved in supervising capital markets to the extent that bank subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nas investment houses and securities firms, operate in the capital market.\n\n28.\nEstablished in 1936, SEC derives its mandate, powers, and broad authority to regulate\nand supervise corporations, investment firms, and the securities industry from SRC, Presidential\nDecree  902-A,  the  Corporation  Code,  Investment  Houses  Law,  the  Investment  Company  Act,\nand  the  Financing  Company  Act  and  other  statutes  (Appendix  3).15  Supported  by  these  laws,\nSEC serves as a collegial body with a governing board consisting of a full-time chairperson that\nis  the  chief  executive,  and  four  commissioners  who  coordinate  line  responsibilities.  The\nmembers  of  the  Commission,  appointed  by  the  President  of  the  Philippines  for  a  seven-year\nterm, decide regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement matters on the basis of majority vote.\n\nBSP  supervises  all  nonbank  services  offered  by  banks  and  quasi  banks  (QB)16\n29.\nsubsidiaries  and  affiliates  and  other  NBFIs  authorized  to  engage  in  QB  functions  and  other\nfiduciary  investment  management  operations.  Since  many  NBFIs  regulated  by  SEC  are  the\nsubsidiaries or affiliates of banks, BSP and SEC need to develop more effective coordination in\nregulating and supervising of the nonbank financial sector.\n\n3.\n\nMarket Institutions\n\na.\n\nThe Stock Exchange\n\nThe  securities  industry  in  the  Philippines  began  with  the  opening  of  the  Manila  Stock\n30.\nExchange  in  1927  and  later  the  Makati  Stock  Exchange  in  1963.  The  Philippine  securities\nmarket was the most active in Asia until the 1970s, but witnessed a setback subsequently due\nto  political  and  economic  problems.  In  1994,  the  Manila  and  Makati  Stock  Exchanges  were\nunified into the PSE (Appendix 4) to achieve uniform pricing of stocks and eliminate arbitrage. In\nthe process, PSE\u2019s two trading floors were linked electronically, enabling brokers and traders to\nexecute orders and clear transactions within the day.\n\nPSE is owned by its broker members, each of whom buys a seat entitling him/her to one\n31.\nvote at general meetings and to participate in its functions, services, and activities. A PSE seat\nis  currently  valued  at  P25  million,  down  from  P80  million  in  1996.  A  15-member  board  of\ngovernors  has  traditionally  overseen  PSE  whose  administration  is  managed  by  the  PSE\npresident  who  is  concurrently  chief  executive  officer.  Two  board  members,  including  the\npresident,  were  required  to  be  independent  directors.  Three  additional  independent  directors\njoined the board in 1998 as a condition for obtaining a SRO license for PSE.\n\nIn  the  three  years  prior  to  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  PSE  was  able  to  raise,  on  the\n32.\naverage, P35 billion in new capital through issues of equity securities. Despite a slowdown from\n                                                          \n14  An  SRO  is  an  industry  organization  developed  to  enforce  fair,  ethical,  and  efficient  practices  on  the  industry.  Its\n\npowers and responsibilities are complementary to the oversight regulator.\n\n15 Appendix 5 contains the rules and regulations governing the nonbank financial sector.\n16 A quasi bank license entitles a financial intermediary to borrow funds from more than 20 lenders at any time, for\n\nrelending or related investment activity. BSP is no longer granting quasi bank licenses.\n\n\f9\n\n1993 to 1994 due to the Mexican crisis, PSE\u2019s market capitalization grew steadily and reached\nover P2 trillion in 1996. The secondary equities market was also active: in 1996 it ranked fifth in\nterms of turnover compared with its regional comparators and the stock index increased steadily\nover the six-year period up to end-June 1997.\n\nTable 2: Selected Stock Market Indicators\n\nItem\nCapitalization (billion pesos)a\n      (% gross domestic product)\nPhilippines Composite Index\n      (Peso, % change previous period)\n      ($, % change previous period)\nAverage daily trading volume\n       (million shares)\nNumber of listed companies\n       a  All indicators are for end of period.\n       Source: Philippines Stock Exchange.\n\n1997\n1,251\n(51.6)\n1,869\n(-41.1)\n(-61.2)\n7.8\n\n1998\n1,374\n(51.3)\n1,969\n(5.4)\n(8.3)\n1.2\n\n221\n\n221\n\n1999\n1,938\n(64.7)\n2,143\n(8.8)\n(5.1)\n3.8\n\n226\n\n2000\n2,578\n(77.6)\n1,495\n(-30.3)\n(-43.7)\n2.6\n\n230\n\n33.\nThe regional financial crisis hit PSE substantially (Table 2). Prices of shares of Philippine\ncompanies listed on PSE fell significantly in 1997. The falling stock market and resultant heavy\nselling of Philippine equity securities by foreign investors induced exchange rate pressures and\naffected  the  foreign  currency  positions  of  financial  institutions  in  the  Philippines.  The  PSE\nComposite Index declined 45.8 percent in peso terms from 3,448 on 3 February 1997 to 1,870\non  29  December  1997,  and  continued  to  fall  during  most  of  1998,  reaching  an  historic  low  of\n1,082  on  11  September  1998.  After  partial  recovery  in  late  1999  and  early  2000,  the  PSE\nComposite  Index  continued  to  be  quite  volatile,  declining  to  1,534  on  30 June  2000.  Stock\nmarket indicators steadily declined:\n\n (i) \n\nInitial public offerings (IPOs) fell from P1 billion in 1998 to P756 million in 1999, and\nP560 million in 2000; and\n\n \n\n(ii)  Market  capitalization  increased  steadily  through  the  1990s,  peaking  in  1996  at\nP2,122  billion.  In  1997,  market  capitalization  fell  to  P1,251  billion  but  recovered  in\nlate 2000 to P2,578 billion based on seven new listings, including the P9 billion IPO\nof  Sunlife  Financial  Services,  Inc.,  of  Canada  and  an  P8.5  billion  offering  of\nPhilippines Deposit Receipts by Global Telecom.\n\n34.\nPSE market capitalization is characterized by a high degree of concentration. The top 10\ncompanies account for about 60 percent of market capitalization and the top 50 companies for\nover 90 percent. The remaining 180 companies are not regularly traded and, often, no current\nprice  quotes  exist  for  their  stocks.  The  Ayala  Group  of  companies  dominates  the  market\naccounting for about 20 percent of the market capitalization.\n\nPSE  operates  two  electronically  linked  exchange  floors:  Makati  and  Pasig  (para.  30).\n35.\nSince  November  1995,  it  has  operated  a  single  order-book  using  US  MakTrade  software  to\nadopt  the  Unified  Trading  System.  The  system  is  considered  efficient  and  transparent.  PSE\nprovides  a  computerized,  exchange-based  trading  market  in  domestic  ordinary  shares,\npreferred  shares,  bonds,  and  warrants.  The  exchange  trades  9:30  to  12:00  noon  five  days  a\nweek.  Equities  are  by  far  the  most  actively  traded  instruments.  The  turnover  was  P659  billion\nend-2000, close to the 1996 level.\n\n\f10\n\nb.\n\nSecurities Clearing Corporation of the Philippines\n\n36.\nSCCP is a privately owned corporation authorized by SEC in 1998 to provide clearance\nand settlement services for trades executed on the PSE. SCCP is capitalized at P175  million,\nP50  million  paid-up  and  P125  million  callable  capital.  PSE  owns  51  percent  of  SCCP  shares\nand  the  remaining  49  percent  are  held  by  three  Philippine  commercial  banks.  Two  of  these\nbanks are designated as settlement banks.\n\nSCCP  provides  trade  matching  and  confirmation,  trade  netting,  settlement  instructions,\n37.\nand a settlement guarantee for its members. The clearinghouse within PSE matches trades on\ntrade  day  plus  1  (T+1)  based  on  data  downloaded  from  the  unified  trading  system.  Broker\nconfirmations  are  recorded  on  T+2  based  on  returns  from  brokers  to  the  clearinghouse.\nDisputed trades are resolved through amendment of trade details, buying in, unwinding, or other\narrangements.  Trades  are  netted  on  T+3  and  brokers,  the  central  depository,  and  the  two\nsettlement  banks  are  notified  by  the  clearinghouse  of  the  net  cash  and  securities  position  for\npayment or transfer. On T+3 the settlement banks book the necessary credits and debits in the\ncash settlement accounts of the brokers, and the brokers execute transfers of securities through\ntransfer agents or directly to PCDI.\n\nc. \n\nPhilippine Central Depository, Inc.\n\n38.\nSEC granted PCDI a license in December 1996. PCDI services the securities industry by\nproviding securities safekeeping services and book entry settlement of trade. PCDI is a provider\nof  information  services  to  SCCP,  and  supports  the  needs  of  SCCP  in  carrying  out  its\nresponsibilities  for  securities  transfers  and  cash  settlement.  The  PCDI  system  links  PSE  and\nSCCP,  brokers,  custodians,  and  settlement  banks  together  under  one  information  and\naccounting system. PSE and the Bankers Association of the Philippines each own 32 percent,\nthe  Financial  Executives  Institute  of  the  Philippines  and  the  Development  Bank  of  the\nPhilippines each own another 10 percent. Industry associations own the remainder of PCDI.\n\n4.\n\nKey Market Participants\n\na. \n\nBrokers and Dealers\n\n39.\nThere  are  currently  184  securities  brokers  and  dealers  registered  with  SEC:  of  that\nnumber, 147 are active and 37 inactive. Of the active members, 120 are corporate members (of\nwhich 10 are subsidiaries or affiliates of banks) and 27 are individuals; 21 are foreign and 126\nlocal. The assets of securities brokers and dealers grew from P4.8 billion to P11.6 billion from 1992\nto  1996;  however,  the  size  and  business  of  the  securities  industry  remain  small  and  volatile  as\nprices of PSE-listed companies fell during the crisis period. The falling stock market and resultant\nheavy  selling  of  Philippines  equity  securities  by  foreign  investors  exacerbated  exchange  rate\npressures  and  affected  the  foreign  currency  positions  and  value  of  inventories  of  financial\ninstitutions in the Philippines. At PSE, the top 20 securities brokers and dealers account for about\n90  percent  of  the  business  and  most  of  the  largest  firms  are  foreign  owned.  However,  the  small\nstock  brokerage  firms  whose  volume  and  value  of  business  are  low  have  dominated  the  PSE\nboard of directors, carrying disproportionate influence in managing and administering PSE.\n\n\f11\n\nb. \n\nInvestment Houses\n\nAt  present,  there  are  44  investment  houses;17  7  of  them  have  QB  licenses.  Investment\n40.\nhouses  are  licensed  by  BSP;  however,  they  register  with  SEC  in  order  to  perform  their  main\nfunction of underwriting. Over a five-year period ending in 1998, the assets of investment houses\ngrew from P10 billion to P56 billion and stagnated at around this level due to the slowdown in\nunderwriting  and  related  capital  market  activities.  Of  the  seven  universal  banks,  four  conduct\nunderwriting  activities  through  an  investment  house  subsidiary  or  affiliate  and  three  underwrite\ndirectly. This raises questions of what policies and procedures are in place to segregate bank\nassets  and  mitigate  the  underwriting  risk.  Even if banks are licensed as underwriters they must\nestablish separate subsidiaries for the purpose of functioning as a PSE member securities broker-\ndealer. Hence, the three universal banks that do not have independent underwriting subsidiaries\nare not entitled to PSE membership. In addition to universal banks that play a role in underwriting,\nthere  are  38  commercial  banks  some  of  which  may  engage  in  underwriting  and  stock  brokering\nthrough subsidiaries and affiliates. At present, there are 10 subsidiaries or affiliates of commercial\nbanks that have PSE membership.\n\nc. \n\nFinancing Companies\n\n41.\nFinancing  companies  provide  loans,  mortgages,  financial  leases,  and  other  forms  of\ncredit. There are 177 financing companies with 228 branch offices. Seven financing companies\nhave  QB  licenses  and  are  allowed  to  borrow  funds  by  issuing  negotiable  money  market\ninstruments such as commercial papers. Of the 170 financing companies without a QB license,\n19 are the subsidiaries or affiliates of commercial banks and 5 companies have dual licenses to\noperate as a finance company and an investment house. Assets of financing companies grew\nfrom P28.8 billion to P55.3 billion over 1992-2000. Non-QB financing companies contributed to\nthis  growth  and  accounted  for  80  percent  of  the  total  financing  companies  assets,  while  QB\nfinancing  companies  assets  stagnated  at  P8.7  billion  as  they  faced  difficulties  raising  funding\nfrom markets and their bank affiliates.\n\n5.\n\nNonbank Fiduciaries\n\na.\n\nMutual Funds\n\n42.\nThe  Philippines  permits  two  classes  of  investment  companies:  (i)  open-end  funds  (i.e.,\nmutual  funds)  set  up  to  continually  offer  new  shares  to  the  public,  and  (ii)  closed-end  funds  that\noffer only a fixed number of shares determined at the time of the IPO. Closed-end funds are not\nredeemable  at  the  option  of  the  shareholder  but  rather  trade  like  any  other  listed  stock,  with  the\nprice determined on the basis of supply and demand. Of the 20 mutual open-ended funds in the\ncountry, 6 are stock funds, 10 balanced funds, and 4 bond funds. Two mutual funds are sponsored\nby banks and accounted for about one third of the industry\u2019s net assets of P3.3 billion as of end-\n2000.\n\n                                                          \n17 The larger investment houses act as underwriters and dealers in private money market instruments, government debt,\nlisted equity securities, and private placement of debt and equity instruments. Under SEC regulations, PSE members\nmay  act  as  sales  agents  in  the  distribution  of  securities  on  behalf  of  universal  banks  or  investment  houses  that\nunderwrite securities.\n\n\f12\n\nb. \n\nPre-Need Plans\n\n43.\nThe  pre-need  industry  is  the  country\u2019s  predominant  collective  investment  vehicle  with\nover  200,000  sales  agents  throughout  the  Philippines.  The  industry  has  raised  cumulative\nassets  exceeding  P130  billion  as  of  end-1999.  Pre-need  plans  have  evolved  from  a  financing\nadjunct  of  the  funeral  industry  (memorial,  burial,  and  cremation),  to  pension  and  education\nplans. The industry has moved from open-ended hedges against inflation to \u201cfixed value\u201d plans.\nTotal  sales  amounted  to  P31.1  billion  in  1999  and  P36.1  billion  in  2000,  or  an  increase  of  16\npercent. Under the authority of the SRC, SEC will continue to regulate pre-need plans. The Pre-\nNeed Code legislation that will upgrade the supervision and reporting requirements of pre-need\ncompanies is pending in Congress.\n\n6. \n\nThe Accounting and Auditing Profession\n\n44.\nThe  Philippines  maintains  an  elaborate  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  to\noversee the development and practice of the accounting and auditing professions. The Revised\nAccountancy  Law  of  1975  governs  accounting  and  auditing  professional  standards,  and  the\nProfessional  Regulation  Commission  (PRC)  regulates  over  40  professions,  including  the\naccountancy  profession.  PRC  is  under  the  administrative  supervision  of  the  Civil  Service\nCommission,  an  independent  agency  reporting  to  the  Office  of  the  President.  PRC  is\nresponsible  for  formulating  policies,  rules,  and  regulations  for  professional  practices  including\nsetting  the  minimum  requirements  for  certified  public  accountants  (CPA).  In  collaboration  with\nthe  professional  regulatory  board  for  accounting,  the  Board  of  Accountancy  (BOA),  PRC\nconducts license examinations and periodic inspections to ensure enforcement and compliance\nwith  professional  standards.  PRC  also  issues  and  renews  licenses  for  professionals,\ninvestigates  and  adjudicates  complaints  and  cases  against  professionals,  and  supervises\naccredited  professional  organizations  such  as  the  Philippines  Institute  of  Certified  Public\nAccountants (PICPA). PRC and BOA are now positioning themselves to improve monitoring and\nenforcement of the quality and integrity of professional ethics, education, and standards, and to\nproactively participate in negotiations and implementation of the ASEAN Framework Agreement\non Services, and the World Trade Organization-General Agreement on Trade in Services.\n\na.\n\nBoard of Accounting\n\n45.\nBOA  comprises  seven  members  who  are  nominated  by  PICPA  and  appointed  by  the\nPresident.  In  accordance  with  the  Revised  Accountancy  Law  of  1975  and  subject  to  PRC\napproval, BOA is responsible for supervising and monitoring accountancy practices, developing\nrules  and  regulations,  setting  professional  and  ethical  standards,  administering  the  CPA\nexamination,  and  issuing  CPA  certificates.  BOA  also  investigates  violations  of  the  Revised\nAccountancy of Law 1975 and, after due process, may suspend, revoke, or reissue registration\ncertificates.  BOA\u2019s  key  mandates  are  to  (i)  improve  the  curriculum  for  accountancy  education\nand the CPA examination system, (ii) revise the accountancy code of ethics and regulations for\nforeign  professionals,  and  (iii)    resolve  outstanding  legal  cases  and  obtain  International\nStandards Organization certification.\n\n46.\nTo achieve these objectives, BOA implemented a coordinated work program with PICPA\nand  other  concerned  bodies  on  revising  the  accountancy  code  of  ethics,  enhancing  the\naccountancy  curriculum,  and  developing  programs  that  reflect  technological  advances  in  the\naccounting profession. The process of reviewing the Accountancy Law of 1975 and the Code of\nEthics for possible amendments is continuing.\n\n\f13\n\nb.\n\nProfessional Integration\n\n47.\nPRC  accredited  PICPA  in  1973  as  the  association  responsible  for  integrating  all\nPhilippine CPAs by registering them as PICPA members. PRC has thus far registered 103,340\nCPAs as of December 2000, but not all are active (i.e. fee-paying) members of PICPA. In 1999,\nPICPA launched a push for compulsory CPA membership in PICPA. CPAs who were not PICPA\nmembers were given until 31 July 2000 to renew their respective registration certificates or face\nits cancellation. Under PICPA rules, all persons whose names appear in PRC\u2019s CPA Register\nshould be members of PICPA. On this basis, failure to maintain membership in PICPA can be\nsufficient cause for PRC to revoke CPA\u2019s registration certificate. PICPA further prepared a bill,\nrecently presented to Congress, that requires compulsory membership of professionals in their\nrespective accredited professional organizations.\n\nB.\n\nConstraints and Issues\n\n1.\n\nWeakness in SEC Structure and Governance\n\n48.\nSEC has a broad and strategic mandate to regulate the securities market. It is, however,\nsubject  to  oversight  from  DOF.  Its  rules  and  decisions  can  be  subject  to  challenges  in  the\ncourts.  It  lacks  financial  autonomy,  which  impacts  on  its  flexibility  to  meet  this  mandate.  SEC\nfinancing  remains  a  major  obstacle  to  effective  market  regulation  and  enforcement.  Fees  and\ncharges collected by SEC (close to P1 billion in 1998) go to the Government\u2019s general revenue\nbudget.  SEC  is then given  a budget  allocation of around P140  million  with  salaries  tied  to  the\ncivil service scale. The resource constraints have limited SEC\u2019s ability to modernize its internal\nsystems and controls and to function as an effective regulator of the securities market.\n\n49.\nUnder  the  1982  Revised  Securities  Act,  SEC  lacked  a  clear  legal  mandate  and  the\nhuman  and  financial  resources  to  fully  exercise  its  oversight  powers  and  authorities  over  the\ncapital  market.  The  organizational  structure  of  SEC  was  restricted  and  outdated,  and\nencouraged  overlapping  administration  and  undersupervision  of  the  securities  markets.  For\ninstance,  three  departments  handle  surveillance,  investigations,  and  enforcement  but  lack\neffective coordination among them. The Prosecutions and Enforcement Department took limited\nenforcement  actions,  while  the  Brokers  and  Exchanges  Department,  which  grants  broker\nlicenses, was overseeing license cancellations or suspensions. The Money Market Operations\nDepartment,  which  monitored  investment  houses,  also  would  initiate  investigations.  Besides\nlegal  impediments  to  reorganization,  there  was  no  legal  protection  for  SEC  staff  acting  to\ndischarge their regulatory functions and powers as regulators. SEC governance standards were\nconsiderably  short  of  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO)\nthe  organization,\nObjectives  and  Principles \nintroducing  information  technology,  and  developing  human  resource  capacity  are  critical  for\nSEC to improve its market regulation.\n\nfor  a  securities  regulator.18  Restructuring \n\n50.\nDespite  organizational  shortcomings  under  the  Revised  Securities  Act,  SEC  started\ndrafting  the  rules  for  an  effective  regulatory  framework  for  PSE  to  function  as  an  SEC  SRO.\nSEC needs to develop an MOU with PSE on specific aspects of market monitoring, particularly\nafter PSE is demutualized. However, under the CMDP, PSE transformed its legal and regulatory\nframework  to  operate  as  an  SRO,  but  there  were  no  effective  implementing  rules  and\nregulations  (IRR)  for  the  SRO.  PSE  has  not  fully  developed  its  capacity  to  act  as  a  frontline\nregulator  for  brokers,  dealers,  and  the  exchange  and  as  an  effective  supervisor  for  listed\n\n                                                          \n18 The full text of all IOSCO documents is available on its web site, www.IOSCO.org.\n\n\f14\n\ncompanies\u2019  compliance  with  PSE  regulations  and  other  rules.  In  addition,  SEC  has  not  been\neffective in its market oversight role of PSE. SEC continued to operate and regulate PSE as its\nstaff  continued  to  exercise  direct  statutory  and  administrative  controls  rather  than  focus  on\nbroad  market  monitoring  oversight.  In  implementing  the  full  disclosure  rules  and  SRO\nframework,  SEC  then  developed  an  overly  technical  and  backward-looking  approach  that\nprevented  sufficient  flexibility,  and  limited  the  creative  development  and  nurturing  PSE\u2019s  SRO\nresponsibilities.  Both  PSE  and  SEC  were  unclear  as  to  how  SROs  functioned,  including  the\nways  regulatory  and  oversight  responsibilities  would  be  shared.  In  view  of  these  issues,\neffective  implementation  of  PSE\u2019s  SRO  status  has  been  problematic.  The  SRO  structure  has\ncreated  legal  issues  and  contributed  to  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty  about  SEC\u2019s  mandate  to\nenforce SRO rules and led to disputes between SEC and PSE.\n\nSEC  needs  to  reexamine  its  policy  on  PSE  self-regulation.  It  needs  to  develop  and\n51.\npublish  a  policy  statement  setting  out  oversight  objectives  and  how  SEC  proposes  to  achieve\nthem.  In  addition,  SEC  needs  to  build  its  staff  skills  in  market  surveillance  and  enforcement.\nPrior to reorganization, almost 65 percent of SEC staff were involved in company registration,\nwhile  the  remainder  focused  on  SEC\u2019s  core  activities  of  prudential  regulation  of  financial\nservices institutions under its jurisdiction and market conduct in the securities industry. The SEC\nculture needs to change so that the majority of staff resources are directly involved in SEC core\nactivities while the remainder of the staff, about 20 percent, focus on company registration. To\nachieve  this  outcome  SEC  needs  to  take  advantage  of  recent  developments  in  information\ntechnology,  and  upgrade  its  monitoring  and  investigation  capacity  to  allow  it  to  analyze  data\nsets  in  a  relational  and  predictive  way.  Current  record  keeping  and  filing  is  not  sufficient  for\nadequate market regulation.\n\n2.\n\nWeak PSE Governance and Regulation\n\n52.\nThe  Philippines  has  been  steadily  increasing  public  ownership  of  companies  through\nprivate and institutional investment and privatization of state-owned enterprises since the  1990s\n(para.  12),  and  it  has  facilitated  growth  in  the  equities  market.  However,  the  standards  of\ncorporate  governance  still  remain  weak.  Under  the  CMDP,  PSE  introduced  three  additional\nindependent directors (para. 30) on the board of PSE to strengthen governance, and supported\nthe introduction of self-regulation.\n\n53.\nPSE  was  established  as  a  limited-liability  company  that  concentrated  on  providing\nservices  and  minimizing  costs  for  its  members,  rather  than  being  profit  driven.  Operating\nsurpluses of PSE have been used to cover losses from any unlikely system failures, or directed\ntoward  improving  systems  and  facilities,  market  development,  and  public  awareness  and\ninvestor  education.  PSE\u2019s  cooperative  governance  structure,  where  each  member  in  the\nmutually  owned  company  is  accorded  an  equal  vote  regardless  of  market  share  or  volume  of\nbusiness on PSE (para. 30), once served it well. It has, however, become more of a hindrance\nthan a benefit. PSE governance and its ability to implement policies and regulation is affected\nby the dominance of the smaller brokers and dealers who are overrepresented on PSE\u2019s board\nof  directors.19  These  smaller  brokers  have  prevented  listed  companies  and  large  players  from\nhaving reasonable representation in market development and policy issues. The top 20 brokers\naccounting for 90 percent of business conducted on PSE (para. 39) have been trying to create a\nmore  professional  culture  at  PSE.  The  large  brokers  are  seeking  improvements  in  market\nquality and integrity, better rules, and better enforcement. While the smaller brokers prefer more\nlax  supervision,  large  brokers  have  supported  close  monitoring  of  market  trading,  strict\n\n                                                          \n19 PCR: PHI 21223: Capital Market Development Program, August 2000.\n\n\f15\n\nsupervision of capital adequacy rules, and implementation of delivery-versus-payment (DVP) in\nthe settlement system. Small brokers see these new systems, procedures, and regulations as\nunnecessary  costs  and  often  as  impediments  to  profitable  trading.  Effective  implementation  of\nthese  systems  and  procedures  are  required  for  PSE  to  become  a  member  of  the  Federation\nInternationale  des  Bourses  de  Valeurs  (FIBV).20  Without  FIBV  accreditation,  foreign  and\ninstitutional investment would be severely restricted.\n\n54.\nSEC  granted  PSE  a  license  to  undertake  self-regulation  in  1998  (para.  27).  However,\nimplementation  of  the  SRO  structure  has  been  difficult  as  SEC  and  PSE  failed  to  agree  on\ncoregulation  with  shared  responsibilities  between  the  market  regulator  and  the  SRO.  PSE\u2019s\nSRO privileges were suspended in March 2000 due to PSE\u2019s failure to maintain a satisfactory\ncompliance  and  enforcement  department  for  direct  supervision  and  monitoring  of  brokers  and\ndealers.  PSE  regained  its  SRO  status  in  late  2000  when  it  reconstituted  its  compliance  and\nenforcement division and guaranteed SEC that it will strengthen its market monitoring systems.\nMore  work  needs  to  be  done  to  ensure  that  the  SRO  framework  is  fully  understood  and\noperates  as  an  efficient  and  cooperative  system.  An  additional  problem  to  effective  rule\nenforcement  is  PSE\u2019s  listing  and  disclosure  group  and  the  compliance  and  surveillance  group\nwho  do  not  have  operational  procedures  for  rule  enforcement.  As  a  result,  the  processes  and\ndecision-rules  are  not  uniformly  applied,  leading  to  inconsistency  and  uncertainty  and\nopportunities for market manipulation.\n\n3.\n\nInadequate  Compliance  by  Market  Participants  and  Weak  Enforcement  by\nSEC\n\nFinancial  reporting  and  market  transactions  in  the  Philippines  lack  consistency  in\n55.\nregulatory  compliance,  enforcement,  and  transparency.  As  a  result,  financial  intermediaries\nperforming the same functions are regulated and supervised under different standards. Market\nparticipants  take  advantage  of  the  application  of  different  standards  and  engage  in  regulatory\narbitrage and market abuse. One of the major issues is the dichotomy between the regulation\nand  supervision  of  the  nonbank  financial  sector.  While  SEC  regulates  the  nonbank  financial\nsector,  some  NBFIs  are  supervised  by  BSP  (para.  29).  This  structure  has  evolved  as\ncommercial  banks  expanded  their  operations  to  handle  securities  functions  and  businesses\nthrough  subsidiaries  or  affiliates,  and  universal  banks  were  licensed  to  underwrite  securities.\nBSP\u2019s role in supervising the underwriting activity of universal and commercial banks and SEC\u2019s\nrole  in  the  rest  of  the  securities  market  have  created  regulatory  fragmentation  and\nsegmentation.  Both  agencies  have  different  priorities  as  reflected  in  their  respective  policies,\nrules  and  regulations,  and  record  keeping  and  reporting  requirements  for  their  institutions.\nSimilar financial activities are regulated under different standards, resulting in uncertainties with\nrespect to compliance, regulatory costs, and protection of the public. To address this problem,\nsome  regulators  around  the  world  have  moved  from  an  institutional  to  a  functional  approach\ntoward  regulation.  Under  this  framework  similar  activities  and  products  are  regulated  and\nsupervised uniformly, even where regulation or supervision is provided by different institutions.\nSEC and BSP need to  join efforts  to provide more unified oversight and supervision of NBFIs\nand to ensure effective compliance with market rules and regulations.\n\n56.\nUnder the fragmented regulatory structure, NBFIs have not followed full and fair disclosure\nprinciples; company annual reports are incomplete, and the quality of information does not meet\n\n                                                          \n20  FIBV,  or  the  International  Federation  of  Stock  Exchanges,  is  the  trade  organization  for  regulated  securities  and\nderivative markets worldwide. It promotes the professional business development of financial markets, at national\nand international levels.\n\n\f16\n\nSEC reporting standards.21 Lack of compliance with financial reporting rules and regulations and\nwith disclosure of significant subsidiaries or affiliates reflects SEC\u2019s weak monitoring system. An\ninsufficient  level  of  market  transparency  and  disclosure  of  company  financial  information  has\naffected the efficiency and development of the capital markets in the Philippines. SEC does not\nhave sufficient capacity in accounting and auditing, and monitoring off-market transactions; as a\nresult, activities such as block trades have been inadequately regulated.\n\n57. While PSE rules provide for block sales to be reported to the market, both compliance\nand  the  level  of  disclosure  are  often  deficient.  Block  trades  have  been  abused  by  some\ninvestors  and  have  led  to  the  recent  allegations  of  unfair  pricing,  market  manipulation,  and\nabuse. The conduct of block trades in listed securities is permissible in many equity markets. It\nis  recognized  that  permitting  ownership  in  large  parcels  of  shares  reduces  the  average\ntransaction cost of selling shares. However, since block sales are conducted in minimum sizes\nand  its  sales  are  outside  the  regular  market  of  continuous  bids  and  offers,  these  transactions\ntend  to  be  nontransparent.  More  efficient  mechanisms  are  required  to  ensure  that  price\ninformation from block trades is transferred to the market in a timely manner. The new provision\nin the tender offer rules effectively addresses the lack of pricing transparency of block sales by\nrequiring  wider  dissemination  of  price  information  to  the  market.  The  new  SEC  rule  also  sets\nparameters to protect minority stock holders. Each block sale is now recorded by SEC.\n\nThis lack of transparency and enforcement manifested itself in a series of stock market\n58.\nscandals.  In  addition  to  the  stock  manipulation  and  insider-trading  allegation  of  the  BW\nResources  stock  in  early  2000,  there  have  been  price  manipulation  charges  against  brokers\ninvolved  in  trading  the  Reynolds  Philippines  Corp.  stock.  Mismanagement  in  Urbancorp\nInvestment, Inc, and its parent company Urban Bank has also been noted. While the Reynolds\nPhilippines  Corp.  price  rigging  allegations  resulted  in  minor  fines  to  several  brokers,  the\ninvestment  house  irregularities  resulted  in  a  run  on  Urban  Bank  deposits.  BSP  closed  Urban\nBank  and  SEC  suspended  the  investment  house  license  of  Urbancorp  Investment,  Inc.\nNegotiations are under way for rehabilitating both the bank and investment house.\n\n4.\n\nLack of Diversification of Corporate Financing\n\nFinancial  leveraging  by  corporations  in  the  Philippines  has  been  comparatively  lower\n59.\nthan  in  other  East  Asian  economies.  Lack  of  diversification  in  corporate  financing,  however,\nremains  a  problem  since  capital  markets  are  thin,  with  little  liquidity  and  depth.  The  limited\ndiversity of financial instruments provides weak prospects for financing options and innovation.\nWhile there are 230 listed companies on PSE, so far only one corporate bond has been issued,\ntwo companies have issued warrants, and one company has a preferred stock listing. Corporate\nbonds  and  asset-backed  securities  each  account  for  less  than  1  percent  of  the  outstanding\nvalue  of  all  listed  securities.  Of  the  total  securities  registered  with  SEC,  about  80  percent  are\ncommon stock, while short- and medium-term commercial paper account for about 12 percent.\nMedium-term, variable rate, commercial paper with maturities up to five years is issued in lieu of\nfixed-term corporate bonds.\n\nThe money and debt market (Appendix 5) comprised (i) government securities including\n60.\ntreasury  bills  (T-bills)  with  tenures  of  91,  182,  and  364;  days  and  bonds  and  notes  of  longer\ntenure  that  are  auctioned;  and  (ii)  interbank  call  loans,  promissory  notes,  repurchase\nagreements (repos), and commercial paper. The Government has been successful in launching\n\n                                                          \n21  Recent  surveys  of  the  annual  reports  of  16  listed  Philippine  holding  companies  revealed  that  75  percent  of  the\ncompanies did not present summarized information regarding the financial position of significant subsidiaries in 1997.\n\n\f17\n\nfixed  rate  issues  with  a  maturity  of  as  long  as  20  years.  With  respect  to  private  issues,  some\ncorporations  have  launched  commercial  paper  issues  of  longer  maturity.  The  insurance\nindustry, the Social Security System, and Government Services Insurance System participate in\nthe  Government  treasury  auctions.  Debt  securities  issues  are  mostly  absorbed  by  commercial\nbanks either for their own account or to finance short-term placements.\n\n61.\nThe  main  obstacle  to  debt  market  development  is  the  high  transaction  costs,  including\nthe documentary stamp tax (DST). While the DST on secondary trading has directly contributed\nto  slow  development  of  the  secondary  market,  lack  of  liquidity,  no  market  makers,  and  thin\nvolumes  have  resulted  in  little  interest  by  investors.  Another  constraint  has  been  inadequate\nmarket  infrastructure  for  registration,  clearance,  and  settlement,  as  well  as  investment\nlimitations on institutional investors.\n\n62.\nThe issue of market liquidity is tied to the ability of an investor or market maker to fund\ninventory  to  buy  and  sell  securities.  In  general  for  a  bank,  broker,  or  investment  bank,  equity\ninventory  may  be  financed  through  (i)  repos,  or  (ii)  securities  borrowing  and  lending  activities.\nFully  collateralized  repos  (usually  by  Government  securities)  are  securities  that  are  normally\nexempt  from  reserve  requirements,  excessive  capital  charges,  or  burdensome  transaction\ntaxes, and are considered a cost-effective way for dealers and market makers to finance their\ninventories of Government and private securities. However, in the Philippines repos are classified\nas bank deposit substitutes; therefore, banks are required to hold reserves against their inventory.\nIn  addition,  securities  borrowing  and  lending  are  presently  not  allowed.  As  a  result  of  these\nrestrictions, the market is illiquid as there are no market makers who can at all times provide bid\nand  offer  prices  for  securities.  If  debt  markets  are  to  fully  develop,  the  Government  needs  to\naddress  taxation  and  market  liquidity  concerns,  including  identifying  prudentially  sound  ways  of\nfostering liquidity.\n\n5.\n\nFragile Market Infrastructure\n\n63.\nUnder  the  CMDP  loan,  ADB  supported  the  development  of  a  clearing  and  settlement\nsystem  and  the  establishment  of  a  central  depository  institution  (paras.  36-38).  These\ninstitutions  provide  the  basic  infrastructure  needed  to  create  a  modern  market  trading  system\n(Appendix 6). SCCP is the equity clearing and settlement agency, and PCDI is the depository\ninstitution. SCCP, operating under a temporary license from SEC, is supported by an electronic\ndata processing system, which is shared and owned by PCDI. It is the responsibility of SCCP to\nexecute DVP settlement, maintain and administer a Clearing and Trade Guarantee Fund, and\nundertake system risk monitoring and management.\n\n64.\nThe smaller brokers and dealers have shown resistance to the implementation of DVP\nas  it  eliminates  the  \u201cfloat\u201d  time  between  buying  a  security  and  transferring  the  money  from  a\nbroker or dealer\u2019s account. Under DVP, simultaneous transfer eliminates the risk of nondelivery\nof  security  or  nonpayment  of  funds  for  a  transaction.  The  real  risk  of  nondelivery  is  broader\nmarket  failure  triggered  by  the  unwinding  of  linked  trades.  SCCP,  responsible  for  executing\nDVP,  has  encountered  difficulty  in  meeting  its  objectives  because  of  its  ownership  and\ngovernance structure and delays in development of the RTGS systems. Since July 2000, PSE\nwith  its  majority  shareholding  has  effectively  taken  control  of  SCCP,  installing  one  of  its  own\nmembers as head of the institution.\n\nUnder  SEC  licensing  requirements,  SCCP  is  required  to  establish  and  maintain  a\n65.\nClearing  and  Trade  Guarantee  Fund.  At  present,  PSE  maintains  a  trust  fund\u2013currently  about\nP186 million\u2013 for this purpose. A common rule of thumb is that such funds should be 5 percent\n\n\f18\n\nof  daily  unsettled  trades.  Given  the  sharp  decline  in  the  stock  market,  this  fund  appears\nadequate. However, when the market returns to precrisis levels, additional funds will be required\nto cover the risk of the higher volume of trades.\n\nPCDI  provides  securities  registration  and  safekeeping  services  through  a  book  entry\n66.\nsystem,  and  gives  SCCP  information  for  clearing  and  cash  settlement  of  trades.  PCDI  links\nPSE,  SCCP,  brokers,  custodians,  and  settlement  banks  together  under  one  information  and\naccounting system. PSE has mandated that all trades executed on PSE be settled through PCDI.\nCurrently, SCCP and PCDI operations are limited to the equity market. Furthermore, provisions in\nSRC  for  uncertified  securities  have  potentially  created  uncertainties  regarding  the  future  role  of\nPCDI. SRC defines the role of stock transfer agents (in place of PCDI) and commercial banks (in\nplace  of  SCCP)  to  allow  them  to  assume  some  of  the  functions  of  the  present  clearance  and\nsettlement and depository system. While it is unclear how these provisions will be implemented, it\nwould  be  unusual  for  commercial  banks  to  assume  the  risk  exposure  of  equity  clearing  and\nsettlement. However, with the imminent demutualization of PSE, issues concerning the clearing,\nsettlement, and depository systems need to be explored with SEC and PSE.\n\n6.\n\nLow-Quality Financial Reporting\n\n67.\nThe  establishment,  implementation,  compliance,  and  enforcement  of  best  practices  in\naccounting  and  auditing,  corporate  governance,  and  securities  markets  standards  are\nrecommended  means  of  enhancing  transparency  and  information  flows  in  emerging  markets.\nGuidelines  as  developed  by  international  standard  setters  will  help  the  Philippines  encourage\nhigh quality accounting and reporting arrangements consistent with international standards.\n\n68.\nThe  weak  monitoring  of  financial  statements  by  SEC  (para.  56)  is  compounded  by\nreporting  requirements  of  the  Philippine  Accounting  Standards  Council,  which  prescribes\nstatements of financial accounting standards that are not consistent with international accounting\nstandards  (IAS).  The  accounting  profession  has  adopted  a  wide  range  of  policy  choices  for\npreparing  financial  statements;  the quality of financial reporting for investors has therefore been\naffected.\n\nFigure 1: Perceived Quality of Financial Accounting Systemsa\n\ns\nm\ne\n\nt\ns\ny\nS\n\n \ng\nn\n\ni\nt\nn\nu\no\nc\nc\nA\n\n \nl\n\na\n\ni\n\nc\nn\na\nn\n\ni\n\nF\n\n \nf\no\n \ny\nt\ni\nl\n\na\nu\nQ\n\n1 0\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\na \n\nM a la y s ia\n\nT h a ila n d\n\nP h ilip p in e s\n\nI\nI n d o n e s ia\n\nSaudagaran,  Ahahrokh  and  Joselito  Diga.  2000.

The quality is rated from\n1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).\n\n\f19\n\nAdopting  IAS  will  (i)  reduce  the  costs  and  efforts  associated  with  standard  setting,\n69.\n(ii) improve the credibility of Philippine financial reporting, (iii) provide access to a greater range of\ntraining materials, (iv) make Philippine CPA skills more transferable on the international market,\nand  (v) align  Philippine  financial  reporting  standards  with  international  standards  and  practices.\nWhere  an  IAS  does  not  address  a  certain  country-specific  arrangement,  then  specific  national\naccounting standards can be adopted for country-specific financial arrangements.\n\n70.\nBesides  accounting,  there  has  been  weak  monitoring  of  compliance  with  standard\nauditing  practices.  Philippine  auditing  practices  differ  substantially  from  international  and\nregional  guidelines  and  norms  in  four  areas:  (i)  auditor  appointment  and  dismissal,  (ii)  auditor\nindependence, (iii) audit reporting procedures, and (iv) exposure of auditors to liability.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector and Aid Agency Coordination\n\n71.\nIMF provided a two-year standby credit to the Government of the Philippines, equivalent\nto SDR1,021 million (about $1,371 million) to support the government\u2019s economic program from\n1998-1999.  The  program  addressed  the  dual  goals  of  supporting  Government  liquidity  during\nthe Asian crisis while creating the conditions for sustained growth over the medium term. The\nstandby program, scheduled for completion in June 2000, was extended until December 2000.\nThis  standby  arrangement  was  allowed  to  lapse;  however,  the  Government  consented  to\nregular  IMF  consultations  to  review  the  medium-term  economic  framework  and  the  broad\ndirection of structural reform under a post-program monitoring agreement.\n\n72. Within this overall context, both the World Bank and ADB have been pursuing structural\nadjustment  programs  in  the  financial  sector.  The  World  Bank  has  supported  banking  sector\nrestructuring and reforms, while ADB has focused on capital market growth and development.\nThe  World  Bank\u2019s  Banking  System  Reform  Project22  ($300  million)  was  co-financed  by  Japan\nBank  for  International  Cooperation  (43.8  billion  yen).  This  operation  focused  on  strengthening\nbanking  regulation  and  supervision  as  well  as  developing  a  resolution  framework  for  troubled\nbanks and encouraging banking sector restructuring. Although the Government and World Bank\ndecided to cancel the project in May 2001, banking sector reform is continuing. The World Bank\nhas also conducted economic and sector work in the areas of pension reform, housing finance,\nand enterprise restructuring. Appendix 7 gives a detailed list of reforms implemented under this\nloan.\n\n73.\nADB  involvement  in  the  capital  markets  started  with  reforms  under  the  CMDP.  The\nCMDP focused on (i) consolidating the two stock exchanges, (ii) encouraging transparency and\naccountability  through  increased  public  disclosure  of  financial  information,  and  (iii)  building\ncapacity  and  market  confidence.  Although  the  Government  was  in  compliance  with  the  core\nconditions of the CMDP loan, compliance with a number of other conditions tied to the release\nof  the  second  tranche  was  delayed  with  the  enactment  of  SRC.  Although  ADB  and  the\nGovernment  agreed  to  cancel  the  second  tranche,23  the  CMDP  was  successfully  completed\nfollowing the passage of SRC in July 2000. ADB approved TA for $2 million in 1999 (footnote 4)\nto (i) restructure SEC, (ii) build the capacity of SEC staff, and (iii) strengthen the management\ninformation system (MIS).\n\n                                                          \n22 The World Bank: Banking System Reform, Report No. P7235-PH, approved in November 1998.\n23  IN.88-00: Capital Market Development Program Cancellation of Second Tranche, April 2000.\n\n\f20\n\nIn addition to international financial institutions\u2019 initiatives, USAID approved a large TA24\n74.\nto (i) support enhancing the professionalization of PSE and a review of the business operations\nof  the  clearing  and  settlement  system,  (ii)  draft  the  IRR  for  the  SRC,  and  (iii) support  the\nregulatory  reform  of  the  pre-need  and  investment  advisory  industries.  The  Canadian\nInternational  Development  Agency  supported  the  Philippine  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation25\nand  BSP  in  capacity  building  for  supervision,  and  assisted  SEC  in  drafting  revisions  of  the\nInvestment  Company  Act.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  through  its\nPhilippine-Australian  Governance  Facility,  provided  advisory  assistance  to  PSE  for  developing\nits demutualization plan.\n\n75. With  assistance  from  IMF,  USAID,  and  World  Bank,  the  Government  has  been\ndeveloping legislation that will amend taxation laws to rationalize the DST and other taxes that\nhave  hampered  financial  sector  transactions.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  nonbank  financial  sector\ncomplements and reinforces these aid agencies\u2019 efforts to reform the financial sector.\n\nD. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy\n\n76.\nADB\u2019s country operational strategy, which was revised in 1998, conforms closely to the\nGovernment\u2019s  new  development  priorities  outlined  under  the  new  Medium-Term  Philippine\nDevelopment  Plan  approved  in  2001  (para.  6).  The  strategy  places  increased  importance  on\npoverty  reduction,  social  development,  and  improved  governance.  In  particular,  the  strategy\nenvisages  ADB\u2019s  assistance  program  to  concentrate  on  promoting  equitable  growth,  better\nprovision  of  basic  social  services  such  as  health  care  and  basic  education,  management  and\nprotection of the environment, and policies and programs to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure,\nwith emphasis on greater private sector participation. Through its sector focus, the strategy also\naddresses issues relevant to the currency turmoil, including capital market development.\n\n77.\nThe immediate challenge of economic management is to restore public confidence in the\neconomy, while addressing the weaknesses in some of the economic fundamentals. ADB has\nidentified four economic management priorities for the Philippines: (i) restoring fiscal credibility,\n(ii)  strengthening  governance,  (iii)  improving  the  savings  rate,  and  (iv)  containing  population\ngrowth.  To  reflect  these  priorities,  ADB  has  been  changing  the  sector  mix  of  its  operational\nprogram, moving away from traditional infrastructure project financing, to support broad-based\ngovernance  reforms,  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  agriculture  and  power  sectors,  and\ndevelopment  of  basic  health,  education,  and  other  social  services.  Within  the  area  of\ngovernance,  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  and  programs  have  focused  on  improving  the\ntransparency  of  public  expenditures,  preventing  corruption,  accelerating  privatization  and  the\nrestructuring  of  public  sector  utilities  and  other  entities,  decentralizing  national  government\nentities,  and  encouraging  greater  private  sector  participation.  To  broaden  and  deepen  these\ngovernance  initiatives,  ADB\u2019s  strategy  has  emphasized  strengthening  governance  of  financial\nmarkets\u2013a fundamental goal of the proposed Program.\n\n                                                          \n24 The  USAID  project:  Accelerating  Growth, \n\nInvestment,  and  Liberalization  with  Equity  (AGILE)  provided\napproximately  $27.7  million  from  June  1998  to  September  2001  for  multisector  assistance  that  covers  financial\nsector, trade and industry.\n\n25  ADB  is  also  implementing  TA  2971-PHI:  Institutional Capacity Building of the Philippine Deposit Insurance\n\nCorporation, for $742,000, approved on 31 December 1997.\n\n\f21\n\n2. \n\nSector Strategy\n\n78.\nAs seen in the recent Asian crisis, an economy that becomes more open and integrated\nwith  the  global  economy  will  be  more  vulnerable  to  external  economic  shocks,  particularly  if  it\nexhibits  high  dependence  on  banks  and  has  a  weak  regulatory  framework  for  the  financial\nsector.26 This underscores the need for developing strategies that can support broadening and\ndiversifying the industry and financial sectors to allow for better risk mitigation and management.\nIn addition, the Philippines needs to actively pursue reforms in the finance, corporate, trade and\ninvestment sectors if it is to remain competitive in the region.\n\n79.\nTo support the Philippines in these areas, the ADB\u2019s sector strategy envisages a twofold\napproach  involving  support  for  (i)  financial  sector  reforms,  with  particular  focus  on  nonbank\nfinancial sector development; and (ii) industry and trade development with a focus on fostering\ngreater  competitiveness,  including  development  of  small  and  medium-size  enterprises.  In  the\nfinancial sector, the primary emphasis of ADB\u2019s sector strategy has been to help develop and\ndiversify  the  nonbank  financial  sector  to  enable  it  to  provide  long-term  funding  and  risk\ndiversification avenues.  To promote the development of the nonbank financial sector, ADB has\nemphasized  restoring  investor  confidence  by  strengthening  governance  of  the  financial  and\ncorporate  sectors  at  the  regulator  and  market  participant  levels.  To  achieve  this  objective,\nADB\u2019s  policy  work  has  emphasized  strengthening  the  powers  of  SEC  and  its  governance\nstructure  to  effectively  enforce  market  regulations  and  conduct  proper  market  surveillance.\nSimultaneously, emphasis is placed on improving governance by promoting greater transparency\nand disclosure in financial reporting, use of international accounting and auditing standards, and\npromoting impartial policy, regulation, and enforcement across institutions and markets. Appendix\n8 gives the key reforms undertaken by the Government over the past 10 years.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nV.\n\nTHE PROGRAM\n\n80.\nThe Asian crisis has highlighted the risks associated with vulnerable financial structures\nin a financially integrated world. The buildup of vulnerabilities stemmed from excessive reliance\non  bank  financing,  poor  corporate  and  financial  regulations  and  governance,  including  poor\ncompliance  with  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  and  inadequate  disclosure.  Governance\nand  enforcement  have  been  weak  at  the  regulator,  financial  institutions,  and  corporate  levels.\nThe  crisis  has  also  revealed  the  risks  of  family  and  relationship-based  corporate  and  financial\nstructures. While the Philippines managed to avert the more serious effects of the Asian crisis,\nthese same features also characterize its corporate and financial structures.\n\n81.\nLike  other  countries  in  the  region,  corporations  in  the  Philippines  rely  heavily  on  bank-\nbased  financing.  Businesses  are  dominated  by  groups  of  companies  controlled  by  a  few\nshareholders, often members of the same family. High ownership concentration is typically both\na result and a cause of weak corporate governance. Less than a quarter of the country\u2019s largest\ncompanies  are  listed  on  PSE,  and  of  these,  two  thirds  or  more  of  the  stock  is  usually  in  the\nhands  of  the  controlling  group.  Consequently,  minority  or  \u201coutside\u201d  shareholders  are  not\ninvolved  in  corporate  decisions  and  small  shareholders  are  bypassed  because  of  the  small\n\u201cpublic float\u201d offered by companies. This contributes to thin illiquid markets, volatile share prices,\n\n                                                          \n26  Duncan,  R.  and  S.  Pollard.  A  Conceptual  Framework  for  Designing  a  Country  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy.\nDelivered  at  the  Asia  and  Pacific  Forum  on  Poverty:  Reforming  Polices  and  Institutions  for  Poverty  Reduction,\nManila, 5-9 February 2001.\n\n\f22\n\nand the potential for price manipulation by the large controlling group. The end result is that the\nrelative scarcity of publicly traded shares limits overall access to capital market financing for a\nbroad range of companies. Hence, companies have come to rely on bank financing, often from\nan affiliated bank or other related intermediary. While related party loans are guided by limits to\ndirectors,  officers,  shareholders,  or  related  interests,  intercorporate  and  intragroup  lending\nraises  issues  of  possible  expropriation  of  capital  that  may  eventually  hurt  the  soundness  of\nfinancial intermediaries. In this structure the incentives to improve governance and disclosure,\nat either financial institution or corporate level, are limited.\n\n82.\nTo  rationalize  the  incentive  framework,  the  Government  will  develop  systems  and\nprocedures to increase the efficiency of corporate financing while strengthening corporate internal\ncontrols  and  improving  standards  of  accounting,  auditing,  and  financial  reporting  systems.  In\naddition, effective rule enforcement will be placed at the top of the reform agenda.\n\n83.\nUnder the Program,  the Philippines has started to lay the foundations for a strong and\nrobust financial sector and institutions. The key pillars of the Program are (i) strengthening the\ngovernance  and  enforcement  capacity  of  the  regulators,  SEC  and  BSP;  (ii)  modernizing  the\nsecurities  market;  (iii)  introducing  more  transparency  in  the  market;  and  (iv)  encouraging\nenforcement  of  rules  and  regulations.  These  reforms  are  critical  to  meet  the  challenges  of  a\ngrowing  volatility  from  a  weak  stock  exchange,  competitive  pressures  from  technological\ninnovation, as well as globalization and integration of financial markets.\n\nB.\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n The Program will support the process of capital formation through improved corporate\n\n84.   \ngovernance in the nonbank financial sector. The key components of the Program are\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nenhancing  and  strengthening  the  governance  of  SEC  by  (a)  allowing  SEC\ngreater  administrative,  operational,  and  financial  autonomy;  and  (b)  enhancing\nmonitoring and enforcement capacity;\nmodernizing  the  governance  and  regulatory  structure  of  PSE  by  (a)  developing\narrangements for PSE to strengthen its governance during the transition period,\n(b) restructuring  and  demutualizing  PSE,  (c)  enhancing  SRO  reporting,  and\n(d) developing arrangements for effective regulation of PSE;\nstrengthening market oversight, compliance, and enforcement by (a) developing\nmarket  governance, \nregulation  of  NBFIs,\n(b)  strengthening  prudential \n(c) preventing  misconduct  and  market  abuse,  and  (d)  improving  financial\nmanagement  and  governance  by  strengthening  financial  disclosure  monitoring;\nand\nfacilitating diversification and innovation of corporate financing by (a) developing\na policy, regulatory, and taxation framework for the corporate bond market; and\n(b) enhancing institutional investors\u2019 participation to augment market liquidity.\n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\n85.\nBuilding on ADB\u2019s extensive economic and sector work and policy dialogue over the last\ndecade,  the  NFG  Program  provides  a  long-term  approach  and  perspective  for  reforms  in  the\nnonbank  financial  sector.  To  capture  this  long-term  perspective  effectively,  the  NFG  Program\nhas been developed in two phases.\n\n\f23\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nPhase  I,  from  1998  to  2001,  focused  on  guiding  the  transformation  of  the\nregulator (SEC) and the stock exchange (PSE). SEC is now empowered to deal\nmore effectively with market governance, regulation, and enforcement. PSE has\ntaken the initial steps toward adopting new corporate governance standards and\nbusiness  practices.  To  support  these  institutions  in  the  implementation  of  their\nregulatory  responsibilities,  Phase  I  supported  the  strengthening  of  market\nregulations, increasing the transparency of market transactions, and encouraging\ngreater  compliance  with  rules  and  regulations.  Simultaneously,  Phase  I  reforms\nalso  promoted  an  environment  that  will  encourage  the  development  of  new\nfinancing options and structures.\n\nPhase  II,  2002-2004,  aims  to  broaden  and  deepen  the  policy  framework  and\nactions  implemented  under  Phase  I.    These  reforms  will  draw  on  the  technical\nwork  sponsored  by  ADB  under  TA  (para.  123-125),  the  results  of  the  Financial\nSector  Assessment  Program  (FSAP)  conducted  jointly  by  IMF  and  the  World\nBank, and the extensive economic and sector work conducted by ADB. ADB has\nbeen participating in the Review of Standards and Codes with the World Bank in\nthree  areas:  accounting  and  auditing,  corporate  governance,  and  corporate\ninsolvency. The core topics of Phase II include (a) implementing demutualization\nof  PSE; \n  (b)  strengthening  market  regulation;  (c) strengthening  market\ngovernance and compliance; and (d) facilitating diversification and innovation in\ncorporate financing. These four themes will be the basis for continuing the policy\ndialogue  on  Phase  II  and  critical  to  support  greater  SEC  effectiveness  and\nsustained  reform  in  the  nonbank  financial  services  sector.  The  Government  will\naugment  this  reform  agenda,  drawing  on  the  recommendations  of  the  FSAP,\nwhich  will  assess  economic  and  financial  sector  vulnerabilities  and  identify\npriority  issues  and  constraints  facing  different  segments  of  the  financial  sector\nand their interrelationships.\n\nPhase  I  consists  of  the  35  policy  actions  described  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  1).\n\n86.\nPhase II will follow the Agenda for Phase II Dialogue described in Appendix 1.\n\n1.\n\nPhase I of the NFG Program\n\na.\n\nEnhance and Strengthen SEC Governance\n\nSEC has undergone a number of changes throughout the 1990s. The first major effort to\n87.\nstrengthen SEC was supported under the CMDP loan. Policy actions under this loan supported the\ninitial  steps  to  reorient  the  operations  and  systems  within  SEC  from  company  registration  and\nmonitoring  to  capital  market  regulation.  However,  SEC  was  unable  to  fully  adopt  an  effective\nregulatory culture as its structure, systems, and procedures were constrained under the Revised\nSecurities Act. Recent scandals (para. 8) in the securities market forced the Government to take\nswift action and initiate deeper reforms. As part of Phase I, the Government enacted the SRC in\nJuly  2000.  Under  the  SRC,  articles  in  the  Revised  Securities  Act,  which  prohibited  SEC  from\nrestructuring its operations, were removed. SEC is now empowered to reorganize, streamline its\nstructure and operations, self-finance, rationalize its staff incentive structure and upgrade its human\nresources, and oversee the SRO and the securities industry. These key amendments to the SRC\nsupported  SEC  restructuring  and  reorganization.  With  support  of  ADB  TA,  SEC  prepared  its\nrestructuring  plan,  adopted  the  new  organizational  structure,  assessed  its  staffing  and  skills\nrequirements, and developed new job descriptions.\n\n\f24\n\nThe reorganization plan was developed in line with the IOSCO Objectives and Principles\n88.\nof  Securities  Regulation.  IOSCO  principles  advocate  establishing  an  appropriate  balance\nbetween  independence  and  accountability,  clear  regulatory  objectives,  and  ensuring  the\nresources  to  meet  those  objectives.  Although  SEC  is  still  under  the  administrative  authority  of\nDOF, it has gained greater autonomy under the SRC. SEC can retain part of the funds that it\nraises and has been empowered to issue rules, impose sanctions, and regulate the securities\nmarket.\n\nSEC established a reorganization committee headed by the chairperson and comprising\n89.\nthe  commissioners  and  department  directors  of  SEC.  Supported  by  TA  (footnote  4),  the\ncommittee recommended a full reorganization of SEC including the establishment of a new set\nof  core  operating  departments:  market  regulation,  corporation  finance,  enforcement,  and\ncompliance  and  inspection.  In  addition,  specific  support  departments/offices/divisions  were\ncreated,  including  the  Office  of  the  General  Counsel,  General  Accountant,  and  an  Investor\nInformation and Publication Division. The restructuring plan includes a new salary structure for\nSEC staff comparable with that for BSP and other government financial institutions.\n\n90.\nThe Economic Coordinating Council endorsed a separation package for redundant staff\nas part of the restructuring plan. The retrenchment was voluntary and it was agreed that about\nhalf  of  the  staff  would  no  longer  be  required  in  the  new  organization.  After  the  new  job\ndescriptions and skill requirements were developed, staff applied for the newly posted positions.\nA  job  placement  service  was  established  at  SEC  to  assist  the  transition  of  interested  staff  to\nother Government agencies. Given the fair separation package and the transparent processes\ndeveloped,  staff  retrenchment  was  accomplished  with  little  disruption  and  loss  of  morale  at\nSEC.  Ultimately,  300  of  700  staff  took  the  early  retirement  or  a  separation  package  costing\napproximately $6 million.27\n\n91.\nFollowing  agreement  on  the  structure,  core  departments,  and  work  flow  within  SEC,  a\nstaffing plan with job descriptions and skill requirements was developed. Salary scales of SEC\nwere aligned with other comparable government agencies to attract and keep high-quality staff.\nSupporting the organizational restructuring, ADB TA developed a full-scale training program for\nnewly recruited and retained staff to familiarize them with the SRC provisions and its IRR. The\nstaff  were  trained  using  newly  developed  manuals  on  reporting  rules  for  brokers  and  dealers,\ninvestigation  practices  for  compliance  and  enforcement,  and  SRO  and  company  reporting\nrequirements.\n\nIn  line  with  the  Program,  the  Enforcement  Department  of  SEC  was  entrusted  with  full\n92.\npowers to enforce and laws and regulations ensure compliance of all market participants. SEC\nfurther  established  processes  for  investigating  potential  legal  infractions  and  taking  action\nagainst market participants, issuers, and individuals that breach SRC and SEC regulations.\n\nb.\n\nModernize Governance and Regulatory Structure of PSE\n\n93.\nPhase  I  supported  the  initial  steps  toward  a  major  transformation  of  PSE  to  improve\ngovernance,  and  increase  efficiency  and  compliance  with  rules  and  regulations.  The  Program\nsupported restructuring PSE\u2019s board of governors to include a majority of independent directors\n\n                                                          \n27 The voluntary retirement package was developed based on years of service in addition to the usual civil services\nallowances for pension. Additional restructuring costs noted in para. 118 (i) include the cost of higher salaries, new\ninformation  technology,  and  communication  systems;  the  development  and  maintenance  of  a  web  site,  public\ninformation office; and increased building and system security.\n\n\f25\n\nwho  represent  the  broader  interests  of  the  market.  Of  the  15  members  on  the  board,  PSE\ninducted 5 new representatives, bringing the nonmember representation to 8, including the PSE\npresident.  These  nonmember  directors  were  selected  from  academia,  law  firms,  and  industry\nand represent and protect the interests of investors and the general public.\n\n94.\nIn line with the program objectives, PSE conducted a study to examine the feasibility of\nconverting the stock exchange from a mutual, or member-owned and -governed entity into a for-\nprofit,  shareholder-owned  corporation.  The  study,  completed  in  April  2001,  recommended\nsuitable  options  for  the  privatization,  or  demutualization,  of  PSE  based  on  its  business\nprospects,  and  a  plan  for  a  governance  and  regulatory  framework  within  the  SRO  framework.\nProvisions in the SRC created some of the parameters for PSE demutualization. For example,\nunder  the  SRC  no  shareholder  in  the  demutualized  exchange  can  hold  more  than  5  percent  of\nshares and no group control over 20 percent unless SEC determines otherwise. This provision will\nensure a diverse ownership structure for PSE. PSE has already taken the first step in the process\nby issuing 20 percent of PSE shares to its members. PSE is holding the remaining 80 percent for\neither direct placement with interested investors or eventual self-listing on the PSE.\n\nc. \n\nStrengthen Market Oversight, Compliance, and Enforcement\n\nRestoring investor confidence is a top priority of the Government. Phase I supported the\n95.\nimplementation of higher standards of market oversight and transparency. Greater transparency\nand  accountability  were  developed  by  introducing  stricter  reporting  requirements  for  the  SRO.\nThis complied with the IRR developed to support the SRC provisions. SEC now has to review and\nmonitor  SRO  reports  regularly  for  timeliness  and  accuracy.  In  addition,  the  SRO  should  notify\nSEC of any investigation of a broker or stock being initiated by the SRO, at the same time that it\nnotifies the PSE board of governors.\n\n96.\nThe Program supports increased transparency in securities market trading. This includes\nmore  effective  and  fuller  disclosure  of  information  that  may  impact  on  share  prices.  All  listed\ncompanies are now required to have two, or 20 percent, independent members on their Board\nof Directors. The independent directors represent the public and minority shareholders\u2019 interests\nand bring greater transparency and facilitate disclosure of company information to the public. To\nimprove  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of  the  pricing  of  equity  stocks,  the  dissemination  of\nprice information from block sales was improved through increased market disclosure and stock\noffer  requirements  on  block  sales  of  stock.  SEC  also  adopted  rules  for  stronger  beneficial\nownership disclosure, including establishing a subregistry with the beneficial owner names listed\nunder  the  stockbroker  accounts  at  PDCI.  SEC  created  an  Office  of  General  Accountant  to\nimprove  the  quality  of  information  disclosed  to  the  market;  encourage  greater  transparency,\npublic  awareness,  and  dissemination  of  its  own  rules  and  regulations  on  its  web  site;  and\nopened a public information office.\n\n97.\nThe IRR for the SRC addressed prudential concerns by requiring brokers and dealers to\nmaintain adequate capital reserves in line with international standards. In addition, rules defining\nthe requirements for market makers, the segregation of stockbrokers and dealers, and shorter\nsettlement periods for all SEC fines and penalties were introduced under Phase I.\n\n98.\nTo fight fraud, manipulation, and deception in connection with the purchase and sale of\nsecurities whether in PSE transactions or outside the exchange, Phase I supported provisions in\nthe  SRC  to  broaden  SEC\u2019s  enforcement  powers.  New  standards  and  procedures  were\nintroduced  for  improved  market  monitoring  and  enforcement.  In  addition  to  establishing  a\nseparate department for compliance and enforcement, securities regulators are now protected\n\n\f26\n\nfrom prosecution when they act in good faith and within the legal powers conferred on SEC.  In-\nhouse training programs were developed to build capacity and keep investigators up-to-date on\nmarket activity.\n\nd.\n\nFacilitate Diversification and Innovation in Corporate Financing\n\n99.\nThere  is  a  relatively  active  market  in  listed  stocks;  however,  the  market  for  corporate\ndebt and other financial instruments is largely illiquid because of policy, regulatory, and taxation\nconstraints.  An  adequate  supply  of  equity  and  diversified  debt  products  increases  financing\noptions  and  its  risk  management  alternatives  at  the  level  of  both  financial  institutions  and\ncorporations.  Phase  I  supported  Government  initiatives  to  improve  the  environment  for\ncorporate  financing.  A  high-level  working  group  comprising  regulators  and  market  participants\nsuch  as  BSP,  SEC,  Bankers  Association  of  the  Philippines,  Investment  House  Association  of\nthe  Philippines,  and  other  resource  people  developed  a  manual  on  debt  origination  and\nunderwriting.  SEC  has  already  discussed  the  system  modifications  required  for  more\ntransparent information through a subregistry system at the PCDI.\n\n100.\nIn  addition,  Phase  I  supported  the  liberalization  of  the  insurance  company  investment\ncode  to  allow  greater  participation  of  insurance  companies  in  the  market  and  improve  risk\nmanagement  of  funds  while  providing  greater  market  liquidity.  Phase  I  also  supported\nexpanding  the  possibilities  of  financing  for  market  intermediaries  and  enhancing  the  role  of\nsophisticated  investors  in  line  with  international  practice.  This  involves  allowing  financing\ncompanies and investment houses greater flexibility in meeting their funding requirements.\n\n101. Phase I supported the thorough review of the PCDI systems and procedures, including\nthe  present  certificate  processing  systems,  business  plan;  an  analysis  of  the  current\ninfrastructure and feasibility for corporate debt registry and trading; compliance with G-3028 and\nInternational Systems Security Association recommendations; and staff training requirements.\n\n2.\n\nPhase II of the NFG Program\n\na.\n\nImplement Demutualization of PSE\n\n102. Part of the efforts to restore investor confidence in the Philippines securities market will\nbe demutualizing and privatizing PSE. This process has already started with the distribution of\nPSE  shares  to  the  members  (para.  94),  but  further  efforts  are  needed  to  improve  PSE\ngovernance.  Governance  reform  is  instrumental  to  the  future  successful  development  of  the\ncapital  market  in  the  Philippines.  The  goal  of  demutualization  is  to  facilitate  PSE\u2019s  ability  to\nrespond  to  market  changes,  reduce  transaction  costs,  augment  resources  for  investment  in\nnewer technology to replace the outdated internal systems and trading platforms, and institute\nmore professional management practices. Given these changes, the SRO framework will need\nto be strengthened.\n\n103. SEC will work closely with PSE to ensure PSE\u2019s smooth and effective transition from a\nnonprofit  to  a  fully  privatized,  or  demutualized,  company.  The  transition  involves  distributing\nPSE shares to create a broad, diverse ownership structure. In this process, SEC and PSE will\n\n                                                          \n28 The  Group  of  Thirty,  established  in  1978,  is  a  private,  nonprofit,  international  body  composed  of  very  senior\nrepresentatives of the private and public sectors and academia.  It aims to deepen understanding of international\neconomic  and  financial  issues,  to  explore  the  international  repercussions  of  decisions  taken  in  the  public  and\nprivate sectors, and to examine the choices available to market practitioners and policymakers.\n\n\f27\n\nneed  to  work  together  to  evolve  satisfactory  governance  and  regulatory  arrangements  in  line\nwith  good  international  practices.  Full  implementation  of  PSE  demutualization  will  address\ngovernance  concerns,  increase  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of  market  transactions,  and\nimprove  compliance  with  regulations.  These  measures  are  expected  to  boost  investor\nconfidence and investment in the market.\n\n104.\nIn  addition,  there  will  be  a  need  to  enhance  market  monitoring  and  surveillance  and\nensure the transparency of the trading mechanism. Under Phase II, ADB will continue to work\nwith  PSE  and  SEC  to  ensure  sound  market  regulatory  practices  in  line  with  the  demutualized\nstructure of PSE. Ultimately, demutualization will lead to greater efficiency, cost savings, and a\nstock exchange more transparently managed in line with international best practices and sound\ncorporate governance standards.\n\nb.\n\nStrengthen Market Regulation\n\n105. SEC is expected to develop greater capacity to enforce legislation and regulations and\nmonitor  financial  reporting  of  market  participants;  it  will  require  enhanced  systems,  skills\nupgrading, and standards training in accounting and auditing. SEC is expected to support more\nin-house  capacity  building  and  training  of  its  staff  in  the  use  of  information  technology  and\nmanagement  systems  to  increase  staff  efficiency.  Specifically  designed  training  modules\ndeveloped  under  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  Finance  Ministers:  Financial\nRegulators Training Initiative will be introduced.29 Activity has already started to address some\nof the regulatory issues in the nonbank financial sector with an MOU between SEC and BSP.\nMOUs are planned for SEC and PSE, and SEC and the institutions that regulate the accounting\nprofession.\n\n106.\nIn  addition,  SEC  will  take  the  lead  in  developing  a  strategy  to  deal  with  the  direction  of\nregulation of the nonbank financial sector in the Philippines. The policy framework must have a\nclear  focus  on  raising  regulatory  effectiveness.  One  of  the  key  requirements  in  meeting  this\nobjective is a consistent approach to regulating markets and market conduct. SEC is responsible\nfor  the  prudential  soundness  of  a  subset  of  financial  institutions  including  investment  houses,\nfinancing companies, and the pre-need industry and mutual funds. It is also fully responsible for\nmarket conduct issues across the securities market. There are a number of regulatory models in\nthe world, each with advantages. The Philippines needs to adopt a consistent approach to market\nregulation  and  should  develop  a  strategy  that  will  address  these  issues  and  recommend  policy\nmeasures  to  strengthen  nonbank  financial  markets.  The  results  of  the  FSAP  may  provide\nadditional  insight  into  the  concerns  and  vulnerabilities  and  inter-relationships  in  the  financial\nsector.\n\nc.\n\nStrengthen Market Governance and Compliance\n\n107. Under  Phase  II,  the  Government  is  committed  to  improving  financial  management  and\ngovernance by strengthening financial disclosure and monitoring. SEC will upgrade its capacity to\nimprove both the quality and quantity of financial information disseminated to the public. This will\ninvolve  introducing  SEC  procedures  for  routine  checking  of  financial  statements  and  audited\nreports  and  instituting  a  penalty  system  for  auditing  firms  that  do  not  qualify  audit  opinions  or\nwhere financial disclosure information is inaccurate or incomplete.\n\n                                                          \n29 The ADB web site has a list of activities conducted under this initiative.\n\n\f28\n\nThe Government will support the review of the Revised Accountancy Law of 1975. After\n108.\nthe  review,  amendments  will  be  prepared  to  reflect  improved  governance  and  financial\nmanagement  standards.  The  amendments  will  refine  arrangements  accounting  for  setting\nstandards in the Philippines. Additional amendments will be prepared to improve transparency\nand accountability in the auditing profession. The professional accounting bodies are supporting\nthe adoption of IAS as agreed to by Government as a signatory to the IOSCO Objectives and\nPrinciples of Securities Regulation. Additional actions will be taken by Government to introduce\nIAS,  enhance  accounting  standard  setting,  increase  the  accountability  of  professionals,  and\nstrengthen monitoring and compliance with auditing practices.\n\n109. An equally important area is clearance and settlement and the depository infrastructure\nfor  the  securities  market.  Systems  and  procedures  need  to  be  established  such  that  the\noperations  of  clearance  and  settlement  and  the  depository  are  transparent,  efficient,  and  in  line\nwith international guidelines. Developing cost-efficient and transparent infrastructure for trading,\nclearance  and  settlement,  depository  and  registry  functions  is  critical  for  international  market\nrecognition and investor confidence. In addition, steps need to be taken to develop a scripless\ntrading  environment  in  accord  with  Group-30  recommendations.  Specifications  for  corporate\nbond  trading  and  registry  functions  are  already  under  way.  The  Government  is  committed  to\nmaintaining international standards for clearing and settlement and recognizes that any changes\nto the present market infrastructure will be based on international standards and in accordance\nwith the best interests of market development.\n\nd.\n\nFacilitate Diversification and Innovation in Corporate Financing\n\nThe Government is supporting private sector efforts to improve financing alternatives for\n110.\nthe  corporate  sector.  Phase  II  will  support  the  private  sector  in  its  efforts  to  develop  a  bond\nmarket exchange that will include corporate debt instruments. It is anticipated that this market\nwill  give  companies  greater  access  to  long-term  corporate  financing.  Greater  efforts  are  also\nneeded  to  eliminate  tax  policy  distortions  and  create  an  enabling  environment  for  trading\ncorporate  debt  instruments.  The  Government  will  seek  to  rationalize  the  tax  and  regulatory\nstructures  on  secondary  trading  of  debt  market  instruments  such  that  it  will  be  economically\nviable  and  a  liquid  debt  market  will  be  possible.  The  corporate  debt  market  needs  to  be\nrevitalized by introducing regulations for corporate debt trading, upgrading market infrastructure\nfor a corporate debt registry, and rationalizing the tax system including the elimination of DST\non secondary trading.\n\nD. \n\nSocial and Environmental Issues\n\n111. Appendix 9 gives the poverty impact assessment. The policy actions under the Program\nare fully consistent with the three components of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, namely, pro-\npoor  sustainable  economic  growth,  good  governance,  and  social  development.30  Pro-poor\nsustainable  economic  growth  is  to  be  achieved  through  the  Program\u2019s  focus  on  measures  to\nincrease  investor  confidence  and  restore  the  flow  of  much-needed  investment  capital  to  the\nPhilippines.  The  Program  will  strengthen  market  governance  by  improving  the  regulation  of\ncompetitive  markets,  restructuring  the  stock  exchange  allowing  it  to  operate  more  efficiently,\nand  improving the quality and quantity of reported and audited financial statements. In addition,\nthe  Program  aims  to  rationalize  distortions  in  the  tax  policy.  These  measures  will  expand\neconomic opportunities by reversing policies that often protected and assisted large and influential\n\n                                                          \n30  Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of The Asian Development Bank,\n\napproved on 9 November 1999.\n\n\f29\n\nfirms  or  business  groups.  The  Program  will  contribute  to  income  generation  and  higher\nemployment. PSE restructuring will allow it to provide special services for small and medium-size\nenterprises to source capital from the stock market. Access to longer-term equity capital has been\na major constraint for small and medium-size enterprises.31\n\n112.\nThe Program will not have any direct and immediate environmental impacts. The likely\nenvironmental  impacts  are  indirect  and  long-term,  and  most  are  positive  (environmentally\nbeneficial).  Evaluation  of  the  potential  indirect  environmental  impacts  of  the  policy  matrix  is  in\nAppendix 10.\n\nA. \n\nAmount of Loan and Source of Funds\n\nVI.\n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN\n\n113.\nThe Republic of the Philippines has requested a loan of $75 million from ADB's ordinary\ncapital resources to help finance the Program.  The loan will have a 15-year term, including a\ngrace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank\noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a\nfront-end fee of 1.0 percent (the fee will be capitalized in the loan); conversion options that may\nbe exercised in accordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations,\nand  ADB's  Conversion  Guidelines;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan\nAgreement.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  reasons  for  the  Republic  of  the\nPhilippines' decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these\nterms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  the  Republic  of  the\nPhilippines'  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or\nadvice of ADB.\n\n114.\nThe size of the program loan was determined keeping in view the (i) estimated short- to\nmedium-term  costs  of  the  reform  program  (in  fiscal  or  balance-of-payment  terms  or  both),\n(ii) strength of the reform package, and (iii) relative importance of the sector.\n\nTotal adjustment costs incurred under Phase I are estimated at about $55 million during\n\n115.\nthe program period. They consist of\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSEC  restructuring  costs  (about  $15  million)  including  $6  million  for  staff\nretirement program;\ncosts of administrative reforms linked to the computerization and reorganization\nof SRO monitoring systems in PSE and SEC, and the continuing cost of higher\nsalaries at SEC (about $25 million); and\ndemutualization  costs  already  borne  by  SEC  and  PSE,  including  the  costs  of\ndeveloping  business  plans,  restructuring  staffing  at  the  exchange,  development\nof  new  procedures  for  the  SRO,  development  of  new  infrastructure  for  clearing\nand  settlement,  and  SEC-related  costs  for  increased  staffing  and  developing  a\nnew regulatory framework for the demutualized exchange ($15 million).\n\n116.\nThe Program will play a key role in restoring investor confidence in the Philippines and\nattracting  foreign  investment.  A  secure  investor  framework  includes  maintaining  a  well-\nfunctioning  stock  exchange  with  good  governance  principles,  and  a  transparent  regulatory\nframework  applying  international  standards.  The  impact  of  weak  investor  confidence  can  be\n\n                                                          \n31 TA 3345 (footnote 6) is helping the development of small and medium-size enterprises sector issues.\n\n\f30\n\nseen directly in lost foreign investment. Over the past two years, foreign investment levels in the\nPhilippines  were  less  than  one  third  of  the  1997  levels  and  largely  attributed  to  low  investor\nconfidence resulting from weak governance in the financial markets.\n\nB. \n\nInterest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n\n117.\nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines,  and  the  interest  rate  will  be\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility and with an amortization period\nof 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years. The loan closing date is 31 December 2002.\n\nC.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n118. DOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  NFG  program  and  SEC  will  be  the\nImplementing Agency. SEC will set up a coordinating committee headed by the chairperson of\nSEC and comprising representatives from BSP, Bureau of Treasury, DOF, National Economic\nand  Development  Authority,  PSE,  SEC,  and  the  Capital  Market  Development  Council  that\ncomprises members from business and industry associations. ADB will also be a member of this\ncommittee to oversee progress in Phase II of the reform program.\n\nD. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement\n\n119.\nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced\nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  (other  than  the  items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible\nitems  [Appendix  11]  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources).  The\nGovernment  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s\nprojected disbursements under the loan for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the\nuse of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.\n\nE.\n\nCounterpart Funds\n\n120.\nThe Government will utilize the local currency counterpart funds generated by the NFG\nloan to meet program expenditures and associated costs of reform and to help maintain current\nlevels of social expenditures.\n\nF.\n\nMonitoring and Tranching\n\n121.\n\nThe single tranche for Phase I is justified because of the\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nsubstantive up-front compliance with 35 policy actions. These actions constitute\na holistic Phase I component of the NFG Program focusing on the key issues of\nempowerment  and  reorganization  of  SEC,  fundamental  corporate  governance\nreforms  of  PSE,  and  initiating  steps  to  enhance  the  transparency  of  market\nintermediaries and strengthening prudential regulation;\n\nevolving  nature  of  Phase  II.   ADB  and  the  Government  have  agreed  on  the\nAgenda  for  Phase  II  Dialogue  and  direction  of  the  Program,  but  specific  policy\nactions  and  the  timetable  for  implementing  Phase  II  will  be  developed  by  the\nGovernment  in  collaboration  with  ADB,  incorporating   the  results  of  additional\neconomic  and  sector  work  being  sponsored  by  ADB  and  the  completion  of  the\nFSAP;\n\n\f31\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nuncertain global and regional financial market environment, which enhances the\npotential  risks  of  financial  contagion  and  requires  flexibility  in  designing  and\nprioritizing policy reforms in light of emerging developments and requirements;\n\ncomplexities of the PSE demutualization process, which requires more lead time\nto ensure an adequate buildup of investor confidence for a possible IPO for PSE;\nand\n\nassessment of the capacities of the existing Implementing Agencies, which need\nsupport of the TA to implement the next phase of the Program.\n\n122.\nThe loan amount of $75 million will be released upon loan effectiveness. The conditions\nfor release include 35 policy actions with which the Government has fully complied. An agenda\nfor  Phase  II  dialogue  has  been  developed  in  collaboration  with  the  Government  to  ensure\nsustainability and enhancement of reform efforts. The Government and ADB will jointly monitor\nthe implementation of Phase II through semiannual reviews. These reviews, conducted with the\ncoordinating committee, will assess the direction and pace of Phase II. To assist ADB reviews,\nthe  Government  will  provide  relevant  information  through  regular  reporting  on  progress  and\nimpact of the policy reforms.\n\nVII.\n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\nThe objective of the TA (Appendix 12) is to strengthen market governance by focusing\n\n123.\non analytical and institutional support for the development of\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nan effective SRO framework to address the potential conflicts of interest in PSE\u2019s\nnewly demutualized ownership structure;\nSEC\u2019s capacity to investigate and enforce market regulations;\nan efficient MIS and staff training to effectively use the system; and\nskills and standards in accounting and auditing.\n\n124.\nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.43  million  equivalent,  of  which  $0.84  is  the  foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $0.59  million  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance\n$1 million  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $0.16 million  equivalent  of\nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis\nSupport  Facility,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  provide  $0.43\nmillion  equivalent  to  finance  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  workshops.  Appendix  13\npresents the detailed cost estimates and financing plan.\n\n125. SEC will be the Executing Agency. The TA will be implemented over a 12-month period\nstarting  January  2002  and  ending  in  December  2002.  It  is  estimated  that  the  TA  will  require\n38 person-months  of  consulting  support:  22  from  international  consultants  and  16  from\ndomestic.  All  consultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB.\n\nVIII.\n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\n\nA.\n\nBenefits\n\n126. ADB\u2019s long-standing support for capital market development, now expanded to cover the\nnonbank financial sector, is expected to assist the Philippines in developing vibrant, competitive,\n\n\f32\n\nand well-functioning financial markets. The Program\u2019s focus on strengthening the governance of\nfinancial markets is expected to have wide-ranging and sustained benefits. The primary benefits\nof the Program are promoting financial market stability and restoring investor confidence. These\nobjectives will be addressed through the implementation of reforms with the potential to broaden\nand  diversify  the  markets  and  support  capital  formation  by  encouraging  foreign  investor\nparticipation  in  the  domestic  markets.  Asset  diversification  away  from  the  banking  sector,\nespecially given the current level of banking stress, will support more resilient domestic markets\nable  to  withstand  exogenous  shocks  and  currency  contagion.  Effectively  dealing  with  financial\ncrises will help the economy protect vulnerable groups, which fall below poverty lines during a\ncrisis, as currency depreciation triggers unemployment and impacts disproportionately on lower\nincome levels.\n\n127. Another principal benefit of the Program is restoring investor confidence in the markets\nas  SEC  emerges  as  a  strong  regulator  with  highly  skilled  professional  staff.  Efficient  and\nresilient  financial  and  corporate  sectors  tend  to  be  characterized  by  good  governance.  The\nAsian financial crisis revealed gaps in governance among regulators, financial institutions, and\ncorporations. Developing market surveillance capacities at SEC will provide greater insight into\nmarket  transactions  and  allow  regulators  to  track  market  abuse  and  fraudulent  activities.\nPenalties  on  market  abuse  will  act  as  a  deterrent  to  market  manipulation  and  insider  trading,\nwhich together have resulted in significant losses to investors. Better monitoring and reporting\nthrough  a  well-developed  MIS  will  also  improve  SEC\u2019s  ability  to  make  public  the  details  on\nsecurities markets transactions and activities, and help investors feel more confident about the\nquality of market information.\n\nTransforming  PSE  into  a  demutualized  exchange  will  help  PSE  to  remain  competitive\n128.\nwith  modern  infrastructure  and  new  governance  and  regulatory  structures,  and  improve\nperformance  and  confidence  in  the  exchange.  Large  companies  are  turning  to  Singapore  and\nHong Kong, China, rather than listing domestically. A modern, professional, and well-regulated\nexchange is likely to provide better prospects for companies to meet their financing needs, while\nprotecting the interest of minority investors in the listed companies.\n\n129. Developing  market  infrastructure  by  upgrading  systems  and  procedures  for  posttrade\nprocessing  will  help  increase  efficiency  and  reduce  transaction  costs,  and  enhance  market\ntransparency  and  stability.  One  of  the  benefits  of  a  better  market  infrastructure  will  be  the\nestablishment  of  a  facility  for  the  clearance  and  settlement  and  registry  of  corporate  debt\ninstruments.  The  corporate  debt  market  is  expected  to  provide  much-needed  capital  to  the\ncorporate sector, while at the same time supporting financing and risk diversity.\n\n130.\nLastly,  the  Program  will  address  one  of  the  major  deficiencies  in  the  Philippines,  poor\nfinancial  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  As  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  governance,  high-\nquality  accounting  and  auditing  practices  provide  the  basis  for  establishing  market  integrity  and\ncredibility.  Without  professional  standards  in  these  areas,  a  disclosure-based  regulatory  system\ncannot protect the interests of the public. The Program\u2019s emphasis on implementing IAS supports\nfull and fair disclosure policies and is part of ADB\u2019s efforts to implement international standards.\n\nB. \n\nRisks\n\n131.\nThe Program faces four major risks. First, macroeconomic stability and a sound banking\nsystem are prerequisites for the development of capital markets and affiliated institutions. With\nthe  widening  fiscal  deficit  and  growing  NPLs  of  the  banking  sector,  macroeconomic  stability\ncould  be  disrupted  or  banking  sector  fragility  may  worsen.  Recognizing  this,  the  new\n\n\f33\n\nGovernment has indicated its resolve to adopt more fiscal discipline and launch tax reforms to\nsupport macroeconomic stability. At the same time, the Government is taking steps to deal with\nthe weaknesses in the banking sector.\n\n132. Second, the effective implementation of the fundamental reforms of PSE and segments\nof the nonbank financial sector depends critically on the support of the private sector including\nthe  members  of  PSE  and  other  market  intermediaries  and  participants.  In  the  past,  vested\ninterests and small brokers resisted change and stalled market reforms of PSE. In the design of\nthe  Program,  efforts  were  made  for  wider  consultations  to  develop  a  consensus  approach\namong  the  stakeholders.  More  significantly,  the  Program  incorporates  advance  actions  in\nspecific areas where there is likely to be resistance, such as the demutualization of PSE. One\ncritical  advance  action  in  Phase  I  is  the  development  and  approval  by  PSE  of  the\ndemutualization  plan.  To  foster  better  understanding  of  the  demutualization  process  and\ndisseminate  information  among  market  participants  on  the  governance  and  regulatory\nimplications  of  demutualization,  ADB  held  a  workshop  on  this  topic  in  August  2001.  The\nworkshop was well attended with good participation from Philippine stakeholders.\n\n133.\nThird, the effective implementation of the Program is contingent on developing capacities\nacross  SEC,  PSE,  and  in  the  area  of  financial  management.  Increasing  the  skills  of  regulators,\naccountants, and auditors is necessary if regulations and standards are to be enforced and levels\nof compliance increased. It is difficult for public sector institutions to attract and retain staff with the\ndesired skills and experience. The Program supports SEC adopting salary structures in line with\nBSP and Social Security System. In addition, SEC has been able rationalize its staffing levels and\nhire  new  better  qualified  professionals.  ADB  through  its  TA  (footnote  4)  and  support  from  the\nAPEC  Finance  Ministers:  Financial  Regulators  Training  Initiative,  is  training  staff  to  develop\ncapacities  in  different  technical  areas.  This  training  is  being  institutionalized  through  the  newly\nestablished Human Resources department.\n\nFinally, one of the lessons learned from the CMDP was to avoid excessive reliance on\n134.\nthe enactment of legislation that may make the implementation of policy actions unpredictable.\nThe Program has focused on ensuring that current market regulations, if found satisfactory, are\nadequately  enforced.  The  Program  is  all  front  loaded,  including  the  enactment  of  legislation  to\nensure  up  front  compliance  and  timely  implementation.  If  improvements  in  regulations  are\nrequired,  alternatives  to  legislative  action  have  been  explored  through  rules  and  administrative\norders.\n\nIn addition to the four risks noted, program loans to the Philippines have recently come\n135.\nunder  scrutiny  due  to  delays  in  implementing  four  pending  programs.32  It  should,  however,  be\nnoted that the performance of the Philippines on program loans has previously been credible. In\ntotal, the ADB has approved nine program loans to the Philippines. Four are ongoing and five\nhave  been  completed.  The  program  performance  audit  reports  rated  two  of  the  completed\nprogram  loans33  generally  successful,  with  the  tranches  released  in  a  timely  manner  and\nreforms well implemented.\n\n                                                          \n32  Loan  1662-PHI:  Power Sector Restructuring Program,  for  $300  million,  approved  on  16  December  1998;  Loan\n1663-PHI: Metro Manila Air Quality Improvement Sector Development Program, for $200 million, approved on 16\nDecember  1998;  Loan  1739-PHI:  Grains Sector Development Program,  for  $100  million,  approved  on  24  April\n2000;  and  Loan  1745-PHI:  Pasig  River  Environmental Management  and  Rehabilitation  Sector  Development\nProgram, for $100 million, approved on 20 July 2000.\n\n33  PPA:  PHI  17152: Fisheries Sector Program,  December  1999;  and  PPA:  PHI  0680: Agricultural Inputs Program,\n\nDecember 1987.\n\n\f34\n\nThe remaining three completed program loans34 have been rated partially successful as\n136.\nthe  Government  complied  with  all  loan  tranche  release  conditions,  but  experienced  delays  in\nprogram  implementation  due  to  lack  of  familiarity  with  ADB  procurement  procedures,  shifting\npriorities among stakeholders, and policy actions related to the enactment of legislation.\n\n137. More specifically, progress in implementing policy reforms in the four pending program\nloans  (footnote  35)  has  been  delayed  because  of  reforms  tied  to  the  enactment  of  new\nlegislation. The Government has made significant efforts to support all of the relevant legislation\nin  Congress  by  identifying  the  legislation  tied  to  ADB  programs  as  priority  legislation.  These\nprograms are expected to be completed despite some delays.\n\n138. Under  Phase  I  of  the  NFG  Program,  the  Government  enacted  the  SRC,  with  the  SEC\ndeveloping the IRR for the law. The risk of delays in Phase I was mitigated by early enactment\nof legislation. Phase II will require up-front compliance with policy actions. Therefore, the risk of\ndelays in this Program is limited.\n\nIX.\n\nASSURANCES\n\n139.\nThe  Government has assured ADB that (i) the policies adopted and actions taken prior to\nthe date of the Loan Agreement, as described in the development policy letter, will continue in effect\nfor the duration of the Program; and (ii) the Government, in collaboration with ADB, shall develop\npolicy  actions  based  on  the  Agenda  for  Phase  II  Dialogue  to  carry  forward  Phase  II  of  the  NFG\nProgram. These actions, when agreed between the Government and ADB, may form the basis of\nfuture ADB assistance to the Government in the nonbank financial sector.\n\nX. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n140.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $75,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  the\nPhilippines  for  the  Nonbank  Financial  Governance  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based loan facility,\nan  amortization  period  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  such  other  terms\nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan\nAgreement presented to the Board.\n\n            \n\nTADAO CHINO\n    President\n\nOctober 2001\n\n                                                          \n34  PCR:  PHI:  299:  Forestry Sector Program,  November  1994;  PCR:  PHI:  21223,  Capital Market Development\n\nProgram, August 2000, and PPA: PHI: 1046: Road and Road Transport Sector Program Loan, February 1995.\n\n\f35\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nDevelopment Policy Letter, Policy Matrix, and\nAgenda for Phase II Dialogue for the Nonbank\nFinancial Governance Program\n\nProgram Framework\n\nMain Acts and Regulations Governing Nonbank\nFinancial Institutions\n\nPhilippine Stock Exchange\n\nThe Debt Market in the Philippines\n\nDepository and Clearing and Settlement\n\nBanking Sector Reforms\n\nSignificant Financial Sector Reforms\n\nPoverty Impact Assessment\n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment\n\nIneligible Items\n\nOutline Terms of Reference for Consultants\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan for the Technical\nAssistance\n\n36\n\n47\n\n52\n\n53\n\n56\n\n58\n\n63\n\n65\n\n67\n\n70\n\n71\n\n72\n\n75\n\n2, 10\n\n2, 10\n\n8, 28\n\n8, 30\n\n16, 60\n\n17, 63\n\n19, 72\n\n21, 79\n\n28, 111\n\n29, 112\n\n30, 119\n\n31, 123\n\n31, 124\n\n\f    \n\n36\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER\n\nMr. Tadao Chino\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\nManila, Philippines\n\nDear President Chino:\n\nThe  Government  of  the  Philippines  is  committed  to  promoting  sustainable  economic\ngrowth  and  enhancing  social  equity.  To  support  the  implementation  of  these  policy  goals,  the\nGovernment  is  focusing  on  strengthening  macroeconomic  management.  The  budget  deficit  is\nbeing kept under control through tax reforms and rationalization of public spending and policies\nare being pursued to help maintain stability in interest rates, prices, and the exchange rate. The\nGovernment  is  adopting  more  aggressive  policies  to  promote  private  investment  and  private\nsavings. A major component of this is to develop a more robust and diversified financial system\nby promoting development of the nonbank financial services sector that has lagged behind the\ngrowth of the banking sector.\n\nDevelopment  of  nonbank  financial  services  sector  will  help  private  sector  meet  its\ngrowing  long-term  investment  requirements,  reduce  excessive  reliance  on  banking  financing,\nand provide an alternate source of funding and varied financial instruments. This will assist the\ncorporate sector in its efforts to improve risk mitigation and management. The Government has\nlaunched  a  Nonbank  Financial  Governance  (NFG)  Program,  which  aims  to  restore  investor\nconfidence  by  strengthening  the  governance  of  the  financial  and  corporate  sectors  at  the\nregulator and market participant levels. The Government has implemented Phase I of the NFG\nProgram from 1998 to 2001 and is now gearing itself to carry out Phase II over the next three\nyears.  The  reforms  under  the  NFG  Program  will  help  mobilize  the  country\u2019s  long-term  funding\nrequirements and assist in restoring investor confidence.\n\nThe centerpiece of the NFG Program - Phase I, was the restructuring of the Securities\nand  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  This  was  achieved  as  a  result  of  the  Government\u2019s\nenactment  of  the  Securities  Regulation  Code  (SRC)  in  July  2000.  The  SRC  empowered  the\nSEC  and  strengthened  its  governance  structure  to  effectively  enforce  market  regulations.  The\nSRC  contains  provisions  that  facilitated  greater  administrative,  operational,  and  financial\nflexibility that strengthened the governance of SEC.\n\nIn addition, Phase I supported modernization of the governance and regulatory structure\nof  the  Philippine  Stock  Exchange  (PSE);  strengthening  market  oversight,  compliance  and\nenforcement; and measures to facilitate diversification and innovation in corporate financing.\n\nThe  Government  has  made  progress  in  modernizing  the  governance  of  PSE.  PSE\u2019s\nBoard  of  Directors  (BOD)  is  now  more  in  line  with  international  standards  after  being\nreconstituted  to  include  a  51  percent  majority  of  independent  directors  from  academia,  law\nfirms, and industry. These independent directors represent and protect the interests of investors\nand the general public. In addition, the Government has required PSE to change its ownership\nstructure  under  the  SRC.  The  previous  mutual  ownership  structure  had  become  outdated  and\nno  longer  effectively  served  the  needs  of  the  public  and  the  exchange  members.  The  change\n\n\f    \n\n37\n\nAppendix 1, page 2\n\nfrom a mutual, nonprofit company, to a private stockholder-based structure should improve the\nefficiency and transparency of market transactions. The initial step in this process included the\ndistribution of 20 percent of PSE shares to the stockbrokers.\n\nThe  Government  has  also  made  progress  in  implementing  greater  governance  in  the\nmarket by increasing transparency, better disclosure and enforcement procedures. Under SRC\nregulations,  all  listed  companies  are  now  required  to  have  two,  or  20  percent,  independent\nmembers on their BOD. The SEC has also created an Office of General Accountant to improve\nthe quality of information disclosed to the market and encouraged greater transparency, public\nawareness, and dissemination of its own rules regulations on its web site and opened a public\ninformation  office.  SEC  has  also  adopted  rules  for  stronger  beneficial  ownership  disclosure\nrequirements  and  has  enhanced  market  monitoring  by  establishing  a  separate  department  for\ncompliance and enforcement, indemnification of securities regulators, and developing in-house\ntraining capacity to keep investigators up-to-date on market activity. The implementing rules and\nregulations for the SRC have addressed prudential concerns by requiring brokers and dealers to\nmaintain adequate capital reserves in line with international standards.\n\nUnder  Phase  I,  the  Government  has  also  taken  steps  to  improve  the  environment  for\ncorporate  financing.  A  high-level  working  group  developed  a  manual  on  debt  origination  and\nunderwriting. Resolutions have been adopted to liberalize investment guidelines to allow greater\nparticipation  of  insurance  companies,  which  enhanced  market  liquidity.  Discussions  with  the\nPhilippine  Central  Depository,  Inc.,  are  under  way  for  system  modifications  to  provide  more\ntransparent  information  through  a  sub-registry  system;  and  for  it  to  act  as  the  registrar  and\ncustodian for a corporate bond exchange.\n\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  Phase  II  of  the  NFG  Program  that  will  build  on  and\ndeepen the reforms initiated under Phase I.  The Main emphasis of the Phase II reforms will be\nto:\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\nCarry  forward  and  complete  the  process  of  PSE  demutualization.    To\nachieve  this,  SEC  will  work  closely  with  PSE  to  ensure  a  smooth  and  effective\ntransition of PSE from a nonprofit to a fully privatized, or demutualized, company.\nThe  transition  includes  a  distribution  of  PSE  shares  to  create  a  broad,  diverse\nownership structure. In this process, SEC and PSE will need to work together to\nevolve  satisfactory  governance  and  regulatory  arrangements  in  line  with  good\ninternational  practices.  Full  and  effective  implementation  of  demutualization  of\nPSE will address governance concerns, increase the efficiency and transparency\nof  market  transactions,  and  improve  compliance  with  regulations.  It  is  expected\nthat these measures will boost investor confidence and investment in the market.\n\nStrengthen market regulation. The SEC is expected to strengthen its capacity\nto  enforce  legislation  and  regulations,  and  monitor  financial  reporting  of  market\nparticipants. This will require enhanced systems, skills upgrading, and training in\naccounting and auditing standards. SEC will further enhance its enforcement and\nmarket  surveillance  capacities  and  improve  regulation  and  supervision  of  the\nnonbank  financial  sector.  To  facilitate  this  process,  SEC  is  committed  to\nsupporting more in-house capacity building and training of its staff in the use of\nmore  information  technology  and  management  systems  to  increase  staff\nefficiency. SEC will also develop a strategy to deal with the future policy direction\nof regulation of the nonbank financial sector. Activity has already been started to\naddress  some  of  the  regulatory  issues  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector  with  an\nMOU between SEC  and BSP, and MOUs planned for SEC and PSE, and SEC\nand the accounting profession.\n\n\f(iii) \n \n\n(iv) \n \n\n    \n\n38\n\nAppendix 1, page 3\n\nStrengthen  market  governance  and  compliance.  The  Government \nis\ncommitted to improving financial management and governance by strengthening\nfinancial  disclosure  and  monitoring.  The  professional  accounting  bodies  are\nsupporting  the  adoption  of  international  accounting  standards  as  agreed  to  by\nGovernment as a signatory to the IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities\nRegulation.  Development  of  cost-efficient  and  transparent  infrastructure  for\ntrading, clearance and settlement, depository and registry functions is critical for\ninternational  market  recognition  and  investor  confidence.  The  Government  is\ncommitted to maintaining international standards for clearing and settlement and\nrecognizes  that  any  changes  to  the  present  market  infrastructure  will  be  based\non  international  standards  and  in  accordance  with  the  best  interests  of  market\ndevelopment. Steps need to be taken to develop a scripless trading environment\nin  accord  with  Group-30  recommendations.  Specifications  for  corporate  bond\ntrading and registry functions are already under way.\n\nFacilitate  diversification  and \nin  corporate  financing.  The\ninnovation \nGovernment  is  committed  to  supporting  private  sector  efforts  to  improve\nfinancing  alternatives  for  the  corporate  sector.  It  is  anticipated  that  broader\naccess  of  companies  to  long-term  corporate  financing  will  support  longer-term\ngrowth.  Greater  efforts  are  also  needed  to  eliminate  tax  policy  distortions  and\ncreate an enabling environment for trading corporate debt instruments.\n\nSubstantial  technical  assistance  has  been  sought  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) to strengthen market governance by (i) strengthening SEC\u2019s role in setting and enforcing\naccounting  and  auditing  standards  and  practices  in  line  with  international  standards;\n(ii) developing  the  self-regulatory  organization  (SRO)  framework  for  the  securities  market;\n(iii) strengthening  SEC\u2019s  capacity \ninvestigate  and  enforce  market  regulations;  and\n(iv) enhancing management information systems to augment SEC\u2019s capacity to investigate and\nenforce market regulations.\n\nto \n\nThe Government has effectively implemented Phase I of the NFG Program with advisory\nsupport from ADB and is committed to pursue Phase II of the Program. The Government of the\nPhilippines  requests  a  Nonbank  Financial  Governance  Program  loan  of  $75  million  and  the\nassociated  technical  assistance  grant  for  Strengthening  Regulatory  and  Market  Governance.\nThe Government will use the proceeds of the loan to meet the costs of structural adjustment of\nthe NFG Program.\n\n4 October 2001\n\n\fPOLICY MATRIX FOR THE\nNONBANK FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE PROGRAM (PHASE I)\n\nProgram  Objective:  To  support  the  process  of  capital  formation  through  improved  corporate  governance  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector.

The  Manila  Stock  Exchange  had  been  in  operation  since\n1927, while the Makati Stock Exchange opened in 1963. There are two trading floors, but these\nare electronically linked and thus operate as one floor. The two floors will be physically merged\nwhen the PSE moves to a new location in 2004.\n\nPSE  is  a  member-owned  exchange,  where  each  member  has  one  vote  at  general\n2.\nmeetings. It is a not-for-profit organization and all profits are reinvested in the exchange. At the\nend of 2000, the exchange had 148 domestic and 36 foreign broker members. The exchange is\ngoverned  by  a  15-member  board  that  has  a  majority  of  nonmembers  since  September  2000\n(Figure A6).\n\n3.\nOn  29  June  1998,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  granted  PSE  self-\nregulatory  status.  As  a  self-regulatory  organization  (SRO),  PSE  is  responsible  for  the  frontline\nregulation  of  member  firms  and  their  trading.  To  gain  SRO  status,  PSE  had  to  establish  a\ncompliance  and  surveillance  department.  At  the  beginning  of  each  year,  PSE  must  submit  an\nannual member audit plan to SEC, and each month reports of audits must be sent to SEC as\nwell  as  a  consolidated  report  on  capital  adequacy  compliance  by  members.  PSE  lost  its  SRO\nstatus  in  April  2000  following  the  resignation  of  the  staff  in  the  compliance  and  surveillance\ndepartment  in  conjunction  with  an  insider  trading  case.  The  SRO  status  was  restored  in\nSeptember 2000 when PSE again complied with the requirements for a SRO.\n\nMost issues listed on the PSE are common stocks. These can be either Class A or Class\n4.\nB.  Filipinos  can  own  both  classes,  while  foreigners  can  only  buy  Class  B  stocks.  Preferred\nstocks can also be issued. These differ from common stocks in that preference is given to the\nholders of this stock over the holders of common stocks.\n\n5.\nTrading is a fully automated auction market where buy and sell orders are prioritized by\nprice and time. The broker, dealer, or sales representative must indicate whether the order is for\nthe firm\u2019s own account or for a client. Furthermore, it must be clear whether the order is for a\ndomestic  or  foreign  firm  or  client.  Clearing  and  settlement  are  done  by  commercial  banks  in\nconjunction  with  the  Philippine  Central  Depository,  Inc.  Stock  certificates  are  immobilized\nthrough a book entry system, and settlement is done at T+4.\n\nThe fees for trading include brokers commission of a maximum 1.5 percent of the total\n6.\ntransaction cost. In addition, transfer agents charge a transfer fee of P100 per stock, and value-\nadded tax is added to this fee. A documentary stamp tax of P1.5 for every P200 par value of the\nstock  transferred  is  levied.  Sales  of  listed  stocks  is  also  subject  to  a  transaction  tax  of  0.5\npercent of the value of the transaction in lieu of a capital gains tax.\n\n7.\nFrom 1991 to 2000, the number of listed companies increased from 161 to 230 (Table\nA6).  Market  capitalization  in  1991  was  P297.7  billion,  which  increased  to  a  peak  of  P2,121.8\nbillion by 1996 before the Asian financial crisis began. At the end of 2000, market capitalization\nstood at P2,577.69 billion, thanks to the listing of two large insurance companies, Manulife and\nSunlife. The share volume in billions of pesos grew from an average of 39.4 in 1991 to 659 in\n2000. The turnover ratio increased from 17.2 percent in 1991 to 31.1 percent in 1998, and 83.88\npercent in 1999.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nThe  composite  index  rose  from  1,151.9  at  the  end  of  1991  to  3,170.6  in  1996.  After  a\n8.\nrebound  in  1999,  the  index  fell  considerably  in  2000,  following  poor  regional  prospects  and  in\nresponse  to  political  uncertainty  in  the  Philippines.  By  the  end  of  2000,  the  index  stood  at\n1,494.50.\n\n9.\nIt is estimated that the top 20 brokers account for about 90 percent of turnover, while the\n4 top brokers alone account for 25 percent of turnover. Many of the small brokers account for\nless than 1 percent of turnover. As a result of the current ownership structure with one vote per\nmember, the large brokers have to gain the support of small brokers to implement any changes\nat the exchange. This situation is about to change as PSE is mandated by law to demutualize\nby September 2001. It is yet to be determined how the demutualized PSE will be structured, but\nit will be a profit-oriented organization with more dispersed ownership, and where the ownership\nshare determines the number of votes. Hence, the balance of power is likely to shift from small\nowners  to  large  active  owners.  Demutualization  will  also  affect  SEC\u2019s  oversight  function,  and\nrules and regulations may have to be revised to suit a demutualized exchange.\n\nListed\nCompanies\n\nShare Volume\n(billion pesos)\n\nTurnover\nRatio (%)\n\nTable A4: Philippine Stock Exchange\n\nPSE\nComposite\nIndex\n1,151.9\n1,256.2\n3,196.1\n2,785.8\n2,594.2\n3,170.6\n1,869.2\n1,968.8\n2,142.9\n1,494.5\n\nMarket\ncapitalization\n(billion pesos)\n297.7\n391.2\n1,088.8\n1,386.5\n1,545.7\n2,121.8\n1,251.3\n1,373.7\n1,937.7\n2,577.7\n\n39.4\n77.0\n182.2\n364.3\n379.0\n668.8\n586.2\n408.7\n948.0\n659.0\n\n161\n170\n180\n189\n205\n216\n221\n222\n223\n230\n\n17.2\n22.4\n24.6\n29.4\n25.8\n36.5\n34.8\n31.1\n83.8\n56.5\n\nYear\n\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n\nSource: Philippine Stock Exchange.\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\nFigure A4:  Philippine Stock Exchange Organization Chart\n\nCommittees\n\nMembers\n\nBoard of\nGovernors\n\nPresident\nCEO\n\nSenior Vice President\nChief Operating\nOfficer\n\nVice President\nListing &  Disclosure\n(Vacant)\n\nVice President\nCompliance and\nSurveillance\n\nAsst.

T-bills have tenors of 91,\n182, or 364 days. T-bills with shorter tenors are called Cash Management Bills. Treasury bonds\nhave 2-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year or 20-year maturity. One 20-year bond was issued in April\n1997 and one 25-year bond in November 2000.\n\n2.\nT-bills are auctioned every Monday, and bonds every second and fourth Tuesday of the\nmonth.  The  amount  and  maturities  to  be  auctioned  are  announced  to  dealers  three  working\ndays  before  the  auction.  It  is  done  electronically  through  the  Bridge  Information  System.\nGovernment securities eligible dealers (GSEDs) key in their bids before 1 pm on the day of the\nauction. The seven-member auction committee then reviews the bids and decides on awards.\nThe interest rate is essentially market-determined.\n\n3.\nThe auction committee is made up of the secretary of the Department of Finance (DOF),\ntreasurer,  2  deputy  treasurers,  assistant  secretary  from  DOF,  Securities  and  Exchange\nCommission (SEC) chairman, and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) representative. The result\nis relayed back to the dealers through the automated debt auction processing system (ADAPS).\n\n4.\nThe  dealers  can  make  a  maximum  of  seven  competitive  bids  and  one  noncompetitive\nbid  per  tenor.  A  competitive  bid  is  a  tender  to  buy  an  amount  of  securities  at  a  yield  rate  per\nannum that a GSED believes will wrest an award for the GSED by outbidding other dealers. A\nnoncompetitive  bid  is  a  tender  to  buy  a  specified  amount  of  Government  securities  without\nindicating  any  yield  rate.  The  rate  for  non-competitive  bids  will  be  the  weighted  average  yield\nrate  of  the  competitive  bids  awarded  at  the  same  auction.  Sixty  percent  are  awarded  to\ncompetitive bids and 40 percent to noncompetitive.\n\n5.\nAuction awards are downloaded into the RoSS system (Registry of Scripless Securities)\nto  register  ownership.  From  the  RoSS  system,  a  trade  report  for  settlement  goes  to  BSP  for\ncash settlements, and statement of securities goes to dealers.\n\n6.\nThere  are  45  accredited  dealers.  The  requirements  to  become  a  dealer  include\nP100 million unimpaired capital and surplus account, meet all ratios prescribed for the industry,\nand be electronically linked to ADAPS and RoSS. Settlement in RoSS at the Bureau of Treasury\nis real time, while cash settlement is done at BSP, T+1.\n\n7.\nThe outstanding amount of government securities at the end of 1999 amounted to P986.7\nbillion. During 1999 a total of 239.3 billion pesos of government securities were issued. This figure\nincludes 91-, 182- and 364-day T-bills, and bonds with maturities of 2, 5, 7, and 10 years.\n\nInterest  rates  on  91-day  bills  have  come  down  from  an  average  of  10.19  percent  in\n\n8.\n1999, to an average of 8.9 percent during the first three quarters of 2000 (Figure A7).\n\n9.\nUnder  the  Small  Investors  Program,  small  denominations  of  treasury  bonds  with  a  five-\nyear  maturity  and  minimum  face  value  of  P5,000  were  issued.  The  first  issued  in  July  1999\namounted to P11.65 billion and the second in October 1999 to P18.6 billion. There are plans for\nlisting  and  trading  these  bonds  to  make  them  a  retail  product,  but  the  plans  have  yet  to  be\nimplemented.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nB.\n\nCorporate Debt Securities\n\n10.\nThe corporate debt market consists of commercial papers and bonds. A majority of the\nshareholders  must  approve  bond  issues,  whereas  only  board  approval  is  required  for\ncommercial  papers  with  less  than  seven  years  maturity.  For  commercial  papers  with  longer\nmaturity, two thirds of shareholders approval is needed.\n\n11.\nShort-term commercial papers have dominated the market since they are cheaper than\nshort-term  bank  loans,  as  reserve  requirements  are  not  extended  to  short-term  papers.  Long-\nterm papers have become more common in the past few years due to stabilizing inflation. The\naverage long-term tenor is 5-7 years. Until 1994, there was little interest in the debt market from\ncorporations.\n\n12.\nSEC  requires  credit  ratings  for  corporate  issues,  bonds  as  well  as  commercial  paper.\nInterest rates on commercial papers are usually based on T-bills plus a spread determined by\nperceived risk.\n\n13.\nThe secondary market in debt securities is largely inactive. There is no formalized listing\nand trading for debt securities. The PSE has developed listing rules for debt securities and SEC\nhas approved these, but listing and trading have yet to take place.\n\nFigure A5:  Interest Rates on Treasury Bills (January 1999-June 2001)\n\n18\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\nA p r\n\nJ u l\n\n1 9 9 9   J a n\n\nO c t\n\n2 0 0 0   J a n\n\nA p r\n\nJ u l\n\nA p r\n\nO c t\n\n2 0 0 1   J a n\n\n  Source: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.\n\n91-day\n182-day\n364-day\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nDEPOSITORY AND CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT\n\nA.\n\nThe Philippine Central Depository, Inc.\n\nThe  1998  G-301  recommendations  require  each  country  to  have  an  effective  and  fully\n1.\ndeveloped  central  securities  depository.  In  the  Philippines,  the  Philippine  Central  Depository,\nInc.  (PCDI)  was  granted  an  operating  license  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission\n(SEC)  in  December  1996  and  commenced  operations  on  10  January    1997  (Table  A8.1).\nSecurities  held  at  the  PCDI  are  actually  \u201cimmobilized\u201d  through  the  use  of  large,  consolidated\nshare certificates. These certificates are referred to as \u201cjumbos\u201d by the PCDI (an average 5,215\ncertificates  went  to  the  jumbo  inventory  in  2000).  PCDI  provides  safe  custody  and  securities\nsettlement  services  for  both  debt  and  equity  securities.  Securities  are  lodged  with  PCDI  and\nregistered in the name of the PCDI Nominee Corporation as trustee.\n\n2.\nSettlement  of  transactions  is  effected  through  debits  and  credits  on  the  securities\naccounts  of  participants  maintained  by  PCDI.  The  computerized  book-entry  system  known  as\nBES  is  currently  adopted  by  PCDI  to  achieve  the  book  entry  transfers  between  buyers  and\nsellers.  PCDI  currently  handles  the  securities  being  actively  traded  on  the  Philippine  Stock\nExchange  (PSE).  PCDI  also  provides  nominee  services  for  distribution  of  information  and\nbenefit entitlements to participants, and bureau services through which participants make use of\nthe computer facilities of PCDI for the back-office administration.\n\n3.\nThe  securities  that  are  eligible  in  the  book-entry  system  of  PCDI  are  equity  securities\n(stocks  listed  in  PSE)  and  debt  securities  (treasury  bills  and  treasury  bonds).  However,  PCDI\ncurrently  has  only  equities  on  deposit.  The  system  does  have  the  capability  to  handle  debt\nsecurities when the market is ready for such a service.\n\nB.\n\nThe Securities Clearing Corporation of the Philippines\n\n4.\nThe  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  of  the  Philippines  (SCCP)  is  a  privately  owned\ncorporation  (Table  A6.1).  SEC  authorized  SCCP  in  1998  to  provide  clearance  and  settlement\nservices  for  trades  executed  on  the  PSE.  The  functions  and  services  SCCP  provides  include\nimplementing delivery-versus-payment (DVP), clearing and settling PSE trades, maintaining and\nadministrating of the Clearing and Trade Guarantee Fund, and risk monitoring and management.\n\n5.\nSCCP acts with three agencies to effect delivery of the securities and cash elements to\nthe trading counterparties as specified in the trade contracts: (i) PSE \u2013 provides direct primary\ninput  of  trade  contracts  as  an  electronic  feed  from  PSE\u2019s  information  system;  (ii)  PCDI  \u2013\nperforms the book-entry transfer of securities from the seller to the buyer; (iii) settlement bank \u2013\nperforms the physical transfer of cash from the buyer to the seller.\n\n6.\nThe  clearing  and  settlement  process  is  supported  by  an  electronic  data  processing\nsystem  called  FINTRACS,  which  is  a  joint  venture  with  PCDI.  SCCP  guarantees  a  DVP\nsettlement and has adopted a trade-for-trade settlement system for all the eligible trades.\n\n                                                          \n1  The  Group  of  Thirty,  established  in  1978,  is  a  private,  nonprofit,  international  body  composed  of  very  senior\nrepresentatives of the private and public sectors and academia.  It aims to deepen understanding of international\neconomic  and  financial  issues,  to  explore  the  international  repercussions  of  decisions  taken  in  the  public  and\nprivate sectors, and to examine the choices available to market practitioners and policymakers.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nTable A6.1: Overview of the Depository and Clearing & Settlement House\n\nOwnership\n\nEligible\nParticipants\n\nAuthority\n\nFunctions of\noperation\n\nThe Philippine Central Depository\nInc. (PCDI)\nPCDI is a private sector company with\npublic sector representation.

(5%).\n\nThe Securities Clearing Corporation of\nthe Philippines (SCCP)\n\nSCCP is a privately owned institution\norganized as a clearance and settlement\nagency for the eligible trades executed in\nthe PSE. PSE holds 51% of the shares, with\nthe remaining 49% held by Philippine\ncommercial banks.\n\nPCDI participants include the member\nbrokers of PSE, custodian banks,\ninsurance companies, registrars,\nbanks, social security and other\ngovernment institutional investors.\n\nSCCP participants include member brokers\nof PSE, settlement banks, and PCDI.\nSmaller members resisted the introduction\nof this system as it eliminates the time\nbetween rate of a security is sold and its\ndelivery.\n\nThe Revised Securities Act prohibits\nany person from providing settlement\nservices unless authorized by SEC to\ndo so. PCDI received its authorization\nas a depository and securities\nsettlement organization in 1996; the\nPCDI Rules were written in 1997 and\nwere approved by SEC.

DVP  features  the  concept  of  a\nsafe and efficient settlement system. This concept is also one of the G30 recommendations.  As\nthe  term  DVP  itself  implies,  the  concept  contains  two  major  parts:  the  delivery  part  and  the\npayment part. The delivery part refers to the delivery of securities from a seller to a buyer, the\npayment part is the delivery of funds from the buyer to the seller. If there is a time lag between\nthese two parts, one of the transaction\u2019s counterparties will be exposed to the risk of the other\nparty  to  complete  delivery.  Therefore,  the  goal  of  a  sound  DVP  is  to  achieve  a  simultaneous\nexchange of securities and payment.\n\nTo achieve a DVP with high security and efficiency, two aspects of the transaction need\n8.\nto be considered. The settlement mechanism\u2019s ability to move securities and funds positions at\nthe same time is the first concern. The second is the quality of the payment that is exchanged.\nThe  exchanging  security  position  by  depositories  is  comparatively  simple  because  depository\ncontrols the securities as well as the participant records, and is, thus, free to apply debits and\ncredits  to  these  accounts  as  necessary.    However,  the  payment  system  is  difficult  to  control.\nThat  is  because  both  the  clearing  and  settlement  organizations  (and  their  participants)  may\nhave  access  to  a  payment  system  for  processing  the  required  exchange  of  funds,  but  neither\ncontrols  a  market\u2019s  payment  system.    Therefore,  the  goal  is  to  ensure  that  both  payment  and\nsettlement  of  security  position  are  \u201cgood.\u201d  Nevertheless,  due  to  the  dynamics  between  the\nclearing  and  settlement  organizations  and  the  payment  system,  this  goal  is  not  always\nreachable.  The  diverse  characteristics  of  the  market\u2019s  payment  system  result  in  various\npossibilities for achieving DVP.\n\nThe  report  from  the  Committee  on  Payment  and  Settlement  System  gives  three  broad\n\n9.\nstructural approaches to achieving DVP:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nModel 1 - Simultaneous finality of securities transfer and cash transfer. Examples\nof model 1 systems include Euroclaer, Fedwire, and Cedel. This model is best in\nterms of risk control.\nModel  2  -  Final  transfer  of  securities  prior  to  final  cash  transfer  but  against\nguarantee by reliable banks. An example of this is the Central Gilts Office in the\nUnited Kingdom.\nModel 3 - Provisional transfer of securities becomes final when final cash transfer\nis made. If the cash is not paid, the securities credit will be reversed. Finality is\nconditional  on  information  as  to  the  availability  of  funds  for  purposes  of\nsettlement.\n\nTable A6.2:  Chronology of the Implementation of DVP in PCDI and SCCP\n\nTimetable\nPCDI began operations (for securities settlement).\nJanuary 1997\nDecember 1998 SCCP was given provisional license, DVP Model 2 was implemented \u2013\n\nProgress of Implementation\n\nJuly 2000\n\ngross settlement for securities and net settlement for cash.\nModified Model 2 was implemented with advance deposit of securities to\nSCCP escrow account and advance deposit of cash.\n\nDVP = delivery-versus-payment, PCDI = Philippine Central Depository, Inc., SCCP = Securities Clearing Corporation\nof the Philippines.\nSource: Corporate Planning and Development Department, PCDI.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\nD.\n\nCredit Accommodations to SCCP\u2019s DVP Implementation\n\n10.\nSCCP  started  implementing  DVP  or  trade-for-trade  settlement  on  7 December  1998\n(Table  A6.2).  However,  PSE  directed  SCCP,  by  virtue  of  its  majority  ownership  and  controlling\ninterest, to deviate from the prescribed manner of settlement. SCCP was mandated to incorporate\nvarious accommodations to its DVP implementation for broker members on a \u201ctrial run\u201d basis: (i) if\nbrokers deliver securities on T+3, they get paid at 9:00 am on T+4 when under approved SCCP\nrules  they  should  be  paid  at  1:00  pm  on  T+4;  (ii)  brokers  are  given  the  privilege  of  drawing  as\nearly  as  9:00  am  their  Net  Due  Broker  amount  or  P5  million  (whichever  is  less)  prior  to  the\ndelivery of the corresponding securities on T+4 at 11:00 am.\n\n11.\nThe credit accommodations greatly affected the fundamental principles of DVP trade-for-\ntrade  settlement.  While  the  system  strives  to  ensure  a  simultaneous  exchange  of  cash  for\nsecurities and vice-versa, the conditions imposed by PSE, which SCCP had no other choice but\nto  accept,  injected  elements  of  risk,  thereby  making  it  ineffective.  Thus,  the  two  credit\naccommodations negated the DVP principle. Therefore, SCCP was directed by an SEC order to\nimmediately  stop  extending  credit  accommodation  to  its  participants  and  to  strictly  implement\nthe DVP settlement. These credit accommodations were removed from SCCP on 30 June 1999.\n\nE.\n\nRecommendations of G30 and 1995 ISSA Amendments\n\nTable  A6.3  summarizes  PCDI\u2019s  compliance  with  the  G30  recommendations  and\n\n12.\namendments to ISSA.\n\nTable A6.3:  Compliance of PCDI to Recommendations\n\nRecommendation\n\nImplemented?\n\nPlanned?\n\n1.1  All comparisons of trades between direct market\n\nparticipants (i.e. brokers, broker/\ndealers and other exchange members) should be\naccomplished by T+0.\n\n1.2  Matched trades should be linked to the settlement   system.\n2.

Significant  policy  measures  relating  to  Asian\nDevelopment Bank operations include the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n1992.  The  Capital  Market  Development  Council  was  established,  comprising\nboth  Government  and  private  sector  practitioners.  Its  task  is  to  recommend\nproposals  for  capital  market  development  in  an  integrated  and  consistent\nmanner,  and  implement  consequential  changes  in  Government  policy.  The\nCapital Market Development Council, along with the Capital Market Coordination\nCouncil  composed  of  Government  and  representatives,  which  was  set  up  in\n1993,  fully  endorsed  to  the  National  Economic  Development  Authority  and\nDepartment of Finance the capital market reform agenda contained in the Capital\nMarket Development Program.\n\n1993. The central bank was restructured into Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP),\nallowing for more focus on and improvement of monetary management. This led\nto lower inflation (18.7 percent in 1991 to around 9 percent average during 1994-\n1996) and lower interest rates.\n\n1994.  Unification  of  the  Manila  and  Makati  stock  exchanges  into  the  Philippine\nStock  Exchange  (PSE).  This \nincreasing  stock  market\ncapitalization until the crisis.\n\nto  a  rapidly \n\nled \n\n1995.  The  banking  system  was  opened  to  foreign  competitors  through  legislation\npassed  in  1994  and  in  1995.  Ten  foreign  banks  were  licensed  to  open  full  service\nbranches.\n\n1995.  BSP  raised  the  minimum  capital  requirements  for  licensed  commercial\nbanks and adopted the Basle Committee norms on capital adequacy and income\nrecognition.\n\n1995-1996.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  shifted  its  regulatory\nphilosophy from a merit-based approach to full disclosure and enforcement.\n\n1996.  Philippine  Central  Depository,  Inc.  (PCDI)  and  Securities  Clearing\nCorporation  of  the  Philippines  (SCCP)  were  established.  PCDI  was  fully\noperational by the end of 1996, and SCCP by the end of 1998.\n\n1995-1996.  Amended  laws  and  regulations  governing  financial,  capital  market\nand other related activities to liberalize the markets were presented to Congress\n(Securities Regulation and Enforcement Act, Revised Investment Company Act,\nCorporation Code, Financing Company Act, and Investment Houses Law).\n\n(ix) \n\n1998. Regulatory responsibilities were realigned along more functional lines such\nas giving SEC jurisdiction over all investment houses and finance companies not\naffiliated with banks.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n1998. SEC granted a self-regulatory organization license to PSE after PSE met\nthe  Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs (FIBV) criteria and received\naccredited FIBV status.\n\n1999.  BSP  and  SEC  agreed  to  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  undertake\ninformation sharing in areas of overlapping jurisdiction.\n\n2000. The Securities Regulation Code was enacted, providing the foundation for\ndeeper changes in capital market regulation.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\n1.\nTaken as a whole, the Nonbank Financial Governance (NFG) Program is poor-neutral in\ndirect  impact  and  indirectly  pro-poor  in  supporting  the  three  components  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy:  pro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth,  good\ngovernance, and social development.1 Pro-poor sustainable economic growth is to be achieved\nthrough the Program\u2019s focus on measures to increase investor confidence and restore the flow\nmuch-needed  investment  capital  to  the  Philippines.  This,  in  turn,  will  provide  employment  for\nyoung  school  leavers  who  comprise  30  percent  of  the  labor  force  but  50  percent  of  the\nunemployed.  Revitalizing  the  moribund  labor  market  provides  income-generating  opportunities\nfor  the  underemployed  raising  real  wages  of  the  working  poor.  The  Program  will  strengthen\nmarket  governance  by  improving  regulation  of  competitive  markets,  restructuring  the  stock\nexchange and allowing it to operate more efficiently; and through improved transparency of the\nquality  and  quantity  of  reported  and  audited  financial  statements.  In  addition,  the  Program\nsupports the rationalization of distortions related to taxation policy. These measures will expand\neconomic  opportunities  by  reversing  policies  that  often  provided  protection  and  assistance  to\nlarge and influential firms or business groups. The Program also supports the third pillar of the\npoverty reduction strategy of social development. Providing basic services such as water supply\nand sanitation requires investment with long-term payback horizons. The development of social\nprotection  programs  such  as  pensions  and  other  insurance  schemes  require  long-term\ninvestment  opportunities.  A  competitive  capital  market  supports  the  expansion  of  basic  social\nservices and the system of social protection with private sector resources by matching the need\nfor long-term money to the need for long-term investment opportunities.\n\nthe \n\nregulatory \n\nThe  Program  supports  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  2001-2004\n2.\n(MTPDP)  underscores  the  importance  of  macroeconomic  stability  for  broad-based  growth,\ncomprehensive  development,  and  governance  as  \u201ccrucial  for  success  in  the  fight  against\npoverty  and  high  unemployment.\u201d2  Although  significant  measures  have  been  passed  to\nthe  chapter\nstrengthen \nmacroeconomic stability cites the need for continued reform to develop the capital market and\nimprove  corporate  governance  to  increase  domestic  savings  for  higher  investment  without\nrunning into balance of payment and external debt problems. The MTPDP recognizes that the\nescape from poverty hinges on \u201cagricultural modernization and  rural industrialization,\u201d3 which in\nturn  will  depend  on  a  vibrant  small  and  medium-size  enterprise  (SME)  sector  supported  by\nappropriate policies and access to financing.4 Appropriate policies for sustainable development\ninclude those supporting a favorable business environment.5\n\nfor  capital  market  development, \n\nframework \n\n3.\nThe  slowdown  in  growth  contributed  to  the  moribund  state  of  the  labor  market.  During\n2000, unemployment reached record highs from already high levels earlier. One fifth of the labor\nforce was underemployed, while real wages stagnated However, the failure of the labor market\nalso contributed to low growth. The direct causes lie with macroeconomic, industrial, and labor\nmarket policies; while indirect causes include access to financial markets, especially for SMEs\nthat would be direct beneficiaries of the Program.\n\nPrice shock and inflation has a greater impact on the poor than on the non-poor.  The\n4.\nAsian  crisis  took  its  toll  by  increasing  the  proportion  of  the  poor  and  increasing  the  depth  of\n\n                  \n\n1  Asian Development Bank. 1999.

Between 1997 and 2000, the proportion of households below the poverty line increased\nfrom  31.8  to  34.2  percent,  and  those  with  incomes  below  the  food  threshold6  increased  from\n16.2  percent  to  16.8  percent.  Increased  prudential  standards  and  greater  efforts  to  increase\ncompliance, and enforcement with rules and regulations lead to a more robust system, thereby\nreducing  its  vulnerability  to  external  shock    as  does  greater  reliance  on  domestic  capital\nmarkets.\n\n5.\nFiscal realities constrain the expansion of basic public services. For example, one fifth of\nthe population lacks access to safe water and one fourth lacks access to electricity.  These and\nother  public  service  investment  areas  with  long-term  financing  needs  such  as  schools,  public\nhealth  centers,  feeder  ports,  and  farm-to-market  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  municipal\ngovernments with limited local resources. Access to a well developed bond market will enable\nmunicipal  governments  to  promote  access  of  the  poor  to  public  goods  and  increase  their\nproductivity.  Expansion  of  the  system  for  social  protection  is  constrained  by  the  need  for\nefficient  and  less  risky  alternatives  to  banks  in  providing  long  term  funds.  Strengthening  the\ncapacity  of  institutional  investors  deepens  the  security  markets  and  enables  the  expansion  of\nthe social protection system and the provision of basic public infrastructure.\n\n6.\nThe  Program  addresses  the  requirements  of  the  major  actors  in  the  capital  market,\nwhich taken as a whole enable a well-regulated and efficient capital market. The only negative\nimpact in the Program results from the streamlining of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC).  Three  hundred  of  SEC\u2019s  staff  have  voluntarily  accepted  a  severance  package  that  is\nabove the legal requirements. They were relatively young and skilled and unlikely to find undue\ndifficulties in locating other employment within the sector.  A poverty impact matrix is shown for\nthe combined Program as each component of the program contributes to the same outcome.\n\nChannel\nLabor\n\nTable A9: Poverty Impact of the Program\n\nIndirect\nIncreased access to capital\nmarkets leads to increased\nemployment opportunities\nfor the skilled poor and\nincreased opportunities for\nincome generation for the\nunskilled poor\n\nJob creation revitalizes\nlabor markets and can lead\nto increased real wages for\nthe working poor.\n\nMacro\nIncreased accountability and\nclarification of fiduciary\nresponsibilities reduce the\npossibility for market\nmanipulation, fraud, and\nabuse. The cost of these\nfinancial crimes has a direct\nimpact on business\nconfidence, future\ninvestment, and\nconsequently to labor\nabsorption.\n\nNon-Poor\nMore investment funds flow\ninto sectors, industries, and\ncountries with transparent\nand efficient markets. The\npotential impact on labor is\ndirectly correlated to\nactivity in the economy.\nTherefore, the greater the\nbusiness confidence, the\nhigher the potential for\nlabor absorption.\n\nAccess for the\nmarkets and\nservices\n\nMore stable and\npredictable funding of\ncontractual saving\nschemes reduced\nvulnerability to poverty for\nthe working poor.\n\nGreater investor confidence\nleads to greater capital\nformation increasing pool of\nfunds for short term and\nlonger term investment\n\nStability of the funding\ninsurance sector liabilities\nprovides a sounder basis\nfor greater returns in the\ninsurance sector, including\nlife insurance.\n\n6    The  poverty  line  composes  a  food  threshold  plus  and  allowance  for  nonfood  needs  such  as  clothing,  shelter,\n\n                  \n\nlighting, education, and health.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nNon-Poor\n\nEnhanced disclosure and\nmore accurate financial\nreporting in the market\nincluding collective\ninvestment schemes such\nas the pre-need industry\nwill protect the smaller\ninvestors.\n\nMacro\nIncreased transparency and\nstability in financial markets\nincreases the opportunities\nfor local government, pension\nplans, and insurance\nschemes matches the need\nfor long term investment and\nlong term savings\ninstruments,\n\nIn turn, this enables\nexpansion of the provision of\npublic services to the poor\nand improves the reliability of\nthe social protection system\n\nIncreased prudential\nstandards and greater efforts\nto increase compliance and\nenforcement with rules and\nregulations lead to a more\nrobust system, thereby\nreducing its vulnerability to\nexternal shock and price\nswings\n\nChannel\n\nIndirect\n\nSustained expansion of\nSMEs leads to an improved\ntax base from business and\npersonal income, enabling\nincreased provision of\nbasic services for the poor.\n\nCapital market\ndevelopment leads to\nalternative sources and\nmore competitive of finance\nfor SMEs leading to lower\nproduction costs and more\ncompetitive prices\n\nPrices\n\nNarrative\n\nNet Impact\n\nThe direct impact  of the Program is poor-neutral. The indirect impact is pro-poor.\n\nThe  actions  taken  under  the  Program  will  lead  to  an  efficient  capital  market  where\ninvestors  are  informed  and  protected.  This  will  diversify  the  range  of  financial\ninstruments  available  to  the  public  and  private  sector,  reducing  vulnerability  to  the\nbanking sector and buffering from external shock. Increased access to financial markets\nby SMEs creates employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor and increased\nopportunities  for  small  businesses.  Increased  transparency  and  stability  in  financial\nmarkets  increase  the  opportunities  for  local  government,  pension  plans,  and  insurance\nschemes matches the need for long term investment and long term savings instruments.\nThis enables expansion of the provision of public services to the poor and improves the\nreliability of the social protection system.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 10\n\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n\n1.\nThe Program will not have any direct and immediate environmental impacts. The likely\nenvironmental impacts are indirect and long-term, and most them are positive (environmentally\nbeneficial).  In  general,  improved  governance  in  the  nonbank  financial  sector  will  improve\nregulation  of  competitive  markets,  increase  transparency,  and  promote  good  enterprise\ngovernance.  This,  in  turn,  will  optimize  efficiency  in  the  use  of  resources,  including\nenvironmental  resources.  However,  such  optimization  requires  an  appropriate  environmental\nregulatory framework and enforcement.\n\nPolicy Actions\n\nPotential Environmental Impacts\n\nI.
