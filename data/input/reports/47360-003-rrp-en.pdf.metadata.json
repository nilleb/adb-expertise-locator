THE PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the additional financing of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \nProvincial Roads Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.   The proposed additional financing will expand the scope of the current project to include \nwidening the chronically congested and unsafe Mardan\u2013Swabi road from a two-lane single \ncarriageway into a four-lane divided highway for 42 kilometers (km) of its total length of 53.9 km \nin  the  province  of  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  provincial \nCommunication  and  Works  Department  (CWD)  through  the  development  of  a  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa road network master plan and training programs. 2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s economy is largely driven by strong growth in domestic consumption, recovery \nin agricultural production, and a marginal recovery in foreign direct investments. However, it is \nconstrained  by  an  inefficient  transport  system  with  poor  levels  of  service.  Road  transport \ndominates Pakistan's transport system, accounting for almost 96% of freight traffic in ton-km and \n92% of passenger traffic in passenger-km. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is even more reliant on road \ntransport.  \n \n4.  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has the third-largest provincial economy in Pakistan. Despite major \nchallenges such as waging war on terrorism (with huge spending on law and order), confronting \npower load shedding, and having the highest population growth rate, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \nrecorded the highest economic growth rate in the country. Outperforming the other four provinces \nin 2013\u20132017, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa registered an average growth of 5.1% against a national \naverage of 4.5% for the same period.3 The growth rate could have been higher if road transport \nconnectivity had been better, especially between major cities, because it would have reduced the \ntransport cost of products and improved transport efficiency. \n \n5.  The existing provincial roads are much below the desired standard both in terms of length \nand pavement condition. Of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's total road network of 15,102 km, 1,878 km is \nclassified as provincial roads. These play a vital role in the economic development of the province \nby  connecting  district  centers  to  the  national  highway  network  and  the  provincial  capital, \nPeshawar, with commercial centers, district headquarters, and market towns. Provincial roads \nsupport intraprovincial trade and commerce as well as access to health, education, and other \npublic services; and reduce poverty by creating jobs and business opportunities. \n \n6.  The damaging effects of heavy axle loads, vulnerability to natural disasters, and limited \nfinancial resources for road maintenance are putting tremendous strain on the road network in \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa. Its performance is fast deteriorating because of high traffic accident rates, \nreduced pavement life, increased vehicle operating costs, and, crucially, a backlog in road \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Roads Improvement Project. Manila. \n2  ADB provided transaction technical assistance for preparing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Roads Improvement \nProject (TA 9194-PAK). \n3  H. Pasha. 2018. Growth and Inequality in Pakistan Volume-I. Islamabad. \n ", "2   \nmaintenance and rehabilitation. In fact, only 27% of the provincial roads maintained by the \nPakhtunkhwa Highways Authority (PKHA) are in fair to good condition; the rest is in poor condition. \n \n7.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a loan of $140.0 million, including a \nconcessional loan of $18.5 million, on 28 November 2017 for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial \nRoad Improvement Project to rehabilitate eight key road sections of provincial roads over a total \nlength of 214 km, and improve transport efficiency and road safety. In May 2018, the Government \nof Khyber Pakhtunkhwa requested additional financing to dualize most of the existing two-lane \nroad  between  Mardan  and  Swabi.4 Although  most  of  that  section  is  in  fair  condition,  the \ndualization serves to efficiently and effectively accommodate an increase in goods vehicles: \ntrucks carrying locally quarried stone and other construction materials, and trucks and tractor-\ntrailers carrying agricultural and forestry products.  \n \n8.  The Mardan\u2013Swabi road runs for 53.9 km through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's agricultural \nheartland between the Indus and Kabul rivers. It connects Mardan, the second-largest city in \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Swabi, a college city and the capital of the fourth most populated \ndistrict in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The road is a two-lane single carriageway with urbanized sections \n(strip development) and suffers from chronic traffic congestion and unsafe operating conditions. \nThe current mix of fast- and slow-moving traffic, dominated by motorcycles and rickshaws, \nimposes constraints on speed and increases the risk of collisions. The average daily traffic \nbetween Mardan and Swabi is about 7,000 vehicles (excluding motorcycles and rickshaws), of \nwhich about 15% are heavy trucks, and traffic has been growing at an average 3.4% annually. \nThe highway supports various agricultural, industrial, commercial, and educational activities. Most \nnotable from a traffic generation point of view are the Premier Sugar Mill and Distillery in Mardan; \nseveral textile and edible-oil mills; quarries; public universities, Mishal Medical Complex, and \nnumerous private colleges and academies; a police training school; Shewa Adda Camp for \ninternally  displaced  persons;  and  markets  that  serve  the  surrounding  rural  areas.  Nearby \nRashakai, on the M-1 motorway, was dubbed the \u201cTechnology City\u201d and is expected to develop \ninto a high-tech industrial zone as part of the China\u2212Pakistan Economic Corridor initiative.5 \nHowever, traffic surveys along the Mardan\u2013Swabi road clearly indicate that the current peak traffic \nvolumes already exceed the road's capacity. Accordingly, the proposed dualization of 42 km of \nthe road into a dual-carriageway, four-lane highway has high public investment priority.  \n \n9.  Current project. The current loan is performing satisfactorily, and its implementation is at \nan  advanced  stage.  ADB  and  the Government  of  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  and  PKHA  as  an \nimplementing agency signed the project agreements on 14 March 2018 and declared them \neffective on 24 September 2018, with a closing date of 30 June 2023. The current project is rated \non track to deliver its expected outputs and meet its intended outcome, with contract awards \ntotaling $90.36 million (64% of the total loan amount) and disbursement of $6.7 million (5% of the \ntotal loan amount) as of 12 November 2018. In July 2018, the project director of PKHA signed all \nnine civil works contracts, along with the construction supervision consultant contract. The \nsupervision consultant and the civil works contractors have been mobilized, and construction \n                                                \n4  The dualization of the Mardan\u2212Swabi road was part of the original scope of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial \nRoads Improvement Project approved in 2017. However, the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa decided to \nremove it from the original scope and include it in a separate project to be financed by another development partner. \nLater on, the provincial government changed its plan again and requested ADB to add the dualization back to the \nproject scope. However, when the request was made, ADB\u2019s due diligence was almost completed and a scope \nchange at such a late stage would have delayed the entire project processing. The Government of Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa, reluctant to delay construction works for the originally scoped Mardan\u2013Swabi road, opted to take the \nadditional financing route for its dualization.  \n5  ADB recognizes this member as the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n ", "  3 \n \n  \nworks  are  on  schedule.  PKHA  has  been  implementing  the  resettlement  plan  and  the \nenvironmental management plan without major issues. PKHA has also established a grievance \nredress mechanism, and no unresolved grievances or complaints currently exist. The recruitment \nof the road asset management consultant and procurement of maintenance equipment are \nongoing. PKHA will procure two performance-based contracts financed by the government to \nsupport sustainable road maintenance covering 104 km.  \n \n10.  Proposed  additional  financing.  The  provincial  government  is  seeking  additional \nfinancing to widen the 42 km road section between Mardan and Swabi. The additional financing \nwill further strengthen the capacity of the CWD by supporting the government to develop a Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa road network master plan for the next 20 years, and by building a central laboratory \nfor the PKHA and providing training to CWD staff. \n \n11.  Suitability  of  additional  financing.  The  proposed  additional  financing  meets  the \neligibility criteria because the overall project is (i) technically feasible, economically viable, and \nfinancially  sound  based  on  the  due  diligence;  (ii)  accorded  high  priority  by  the  provincial \ngovernment  as  reflected  in  its  annual  development  plan;  (iii)  consistent  with  the  transport \ndevelopment objectives of the current project, as it will enhance the outcome and outputs of the \ncurrent project; and (iv) consistent with the country partnership strategy, 2015\u22122019 for Pakistan, \nwhich aims to improve physical connectivity and enhance regional integration.6 Given the strong \nlink with the current project in terms of design and implementation arrangements, the additional \nfinancing will offer substantial efficiency gains in project processing and help meet the overall \nproject outcome in a timely manner.  \n \n12.  Value added by ADB assistance. Under the additional financing, ADB will support the \nprovincial government in developing a 20-year Khyber Pakhtunkhwa road network master plan. \nThis is in addition to initiatives financed by the current project, such as piloting performance-based \nroad  maintenance,  enhancing  the  road  asset  management  system,  and  strengthening  the \ncapacity of the CWD. Despite the large quantum of road investments in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \nsince 2000s, some investments have fallen short of achieving the expected outcomes because \nof unprecedented changes in the structure and composition of the provincial economy. The \nmaster plan will assess (i) the status and condition of the overall transport system, including all \nmodes; (ii) the characteristics of transport demand and supply; (iii) the current and projected road \ntraffic demand, reflecting trends in economic growth and regional and subregional trade, as well \nas the transport modal split; and (iv) the spatial distribution, serviceability, and condition of road \ninfrastructure. The master plan will identify the physical gaps and capacity constraints in Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa\u2019s road network relative to current and future traffic demand, as well as the policy \nand institutional improvements needed to satisfy the mobility and logistics requirements of a \nmodern economy. The development of a road network master plan under the additional financing \nwill strengthen the overall capacity of the CWD\uf8e7from road planning to construction, to operation, \nto maintenance. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n13.  The current project is aligned with the following impact: an efficient and integrated \ntransportation network established (Pakistan Vision 2025).7 The current project will have the \nfollowing outcome: efficiency and safety along key sections of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2015.

The additional financing will reinforce the overall aggregate impact of the \ncurrent project, and the overall project outcome will remain the same. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The additional financing will expand the scope of the current project outputs as follows: \n \n15.  Output 1: Provincial road rehabilitated. The output will rehabilitate 42 km of the \nprovincial road between Mardan and Swabi by upgrading it to four lanes and to provincial road \nstandards with tolling and better road safety measures, and by adding climate resilience features \nto withstand damage and disruption from natural disasters. \n  \n16.  Output 2: The CWD\u2019s institutional capacity for road management strengthened. The \noutput will further strengthen the CWD\u2019s institutional capacity by building a central laboratory for \nthe PKHA and developing a Khyber Pakhtunkhwa road network master plan. The master plan will \nbe fully gender-responsive.8 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.

DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The additional financing project has no technical challenges. A national design consulting \nfirm engaged by the CWD prepared its detailed design. It will widen the existing two-lane Mardan\u2013\n                                                \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  7 \n \n  \nSwabi road into a four-lane divided highway on both sides of the existing carriageway along the \nexisting alignment, maximizing the use of existing pavement. New Jersey barriers or an open \nmedian will separate the two-way traffic with improved intersection design and U-turns to eliminate \npotential collisions and other safety hazards. Service roads are provided to segregate the non-\nmotorized traffic when space is allowed. The detailed design also includes construction of: (i) 11 \nfootbridges and two underpasses to provide safer crossing for pedestrians, (ii) a dedicated lane \nfor slow-moving traffic to segregate fast-moving traffic to improve the road safety when space is \nallowed, and (iii) a covered side drain and lighting in urban sections. The detailed design \nconsultant conducted a road safety audit and incorporated most of the advice either in the final \ndesign or to be included during construction stage. The design, especially for bridges, culverts \nand drainage facilities, considers the impact of climate change and natural disasters such as \nfloods. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  Economic.  The  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  additional  financing  project  is \neconomically viable with an economic internal rate of return of 10%, and a net present value of \n$11.5 million at a 9% discount rate. Economic benefits from the project comprise reduced routine \nand periodic maintenance costs for the road agency, and savings in vehicle operating costs and \ntravel time after dualization. The economic viability is robust against increases in capital costs as \nwell as a reduction in benefits. The economic analysis does not include road safety benefits, which \nwill accrue from road safety improvement features. Sensitivity tests revealed that the project is \nrobust against all major parameters, including increases in capital costs and reductions in forecast \ntraffic. \n \n26.  Financial. A review of the financial position of the PKHA indicates that the province should \nbe able to allocate sufficient funds for road maintenance to ensure that the project road can be \nsustained.  The current road maintenance budget is less than 10% of the total PKHA budget and \nis funded from a combination of its own revenues and allocations from the provincial government.  \nIn previous years, whenever the length of roads to be maintained under the PKHA budget \nincreased, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increased the maintenance budget.  \n \n27.  The PKHA undertook a program analysis using Highway Development and Management \nModel 4, which suggests that the network could be maintained in good condition under an \nunconstrained budget scenario of PRs3.00 billion per year, as opposed to the budget allocation \nof PRs1.05 billion for 2017\u22122018, which would result in average road conditions remaining poor. \nThe PKHA is committed to increasing the budget allocation and raises some of its revenues from \ntolls, but the number of sites is limited, so it is heavily dependent on money allocated from the \nprovincial budget. The introduction of tolls on roads that have been upgraded will assist in \nensuring that the roads can be properly maintained in the future. Tolling the project road at rates \ncurrently applicable to national highways will generate enough revenue to pay for incremental \nroutine and periodic maintenance. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  ADB  assessed  the  PKHA\u2019s  capacity for  procurement  and financial  management  as \nessential part of project implementation and found it to be sufficient for managing the procurement, \nfinancial, and implementation tasks, including maintaining the accounting systems, financial \ncontrols, and audit arrangements. The PKHA\u2019s financial management risk is substantial prior to \nmitigation measures. The project team defined an action plan with mitigation measures in the \nfinancial management section of the PAM. The PKHA is experienced and familiar with ADB\u2019s \n ", "8   \nprocurement and consultant recruitment procedures from successfully procuring nine civil works \ncontracts and one consultant contract under the current project. ADB will conduct further training \non strengthening the grievance redress mechanism for matters of procurement, accountability, \nand contract management during project implementation. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PKHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  The project team conducted public consultations with the communities along the proposed \n42 km Mardan\u2013Swabi road project. An analysis of key stakeholder perceptions and concerns \nabout the additional financing project shows positive feedback and no major adverse social \nimpacts. The main direct beneficiaries of the project will be agricultural traders, freight forwarders, \ntransporters, commuters, and those living and working along the project road sections. Indirect \nbeneficiaries include large segments of the population who will gain from more employment \nopportunities in trade and transport and ready access to markets and resources in the province. \nThe local population will benefit from job creation during construction and operation of the \nadditional financing project. The project has been categorized some gender elements because \nwomen will benefit from better access to basic social services such as health, education, and \nsocial  networking  facilities.  To  enhance  road  users\u2019  convenience  and  comfort,  PKHA  will \nincorporate road safety features in the engineering designs, which will help reduce accidents and \nfatalities along Mardan\u2013Swabi road. In addition, PKHA will include the following key gender \nactions during implementation: (i) road safety measures such as footbridges near schools, \nhospitals, and other areas frequently visited by women and children; (ii) roadside bus shelters for \nwomen  passengers;  (iii)  capacity  building for women  staff  at  the  CWD;  and (iv) additional \nassistance to households headed by women as part of the resettlement plan, if necessary. The \nadditional financing will also include the development of a Khyber Pakhtunkhwa road network \nmaster plan which will be fully gender-responsive (footnote 8). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Environment (category B). The design consultant engaged by the PKHA prepared an \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  IEE  anticipates  environmental \nimpacts during construction to be predominantly site-specific and temporary. Among them are \npotential traffic disruptions; limited access to adjoining properties; noise, vibration, and air quality \nimpacts on sensitive receptors; utility relocation; logging of roadside trees, and impacts related to \noccupational and community health and safety. During operation, the additional financing project \nwill likely have impacts related to higher noise and air pollution levels, as well as community health \nand safety. It can also cause community severance while additional lanes and the median are \nbeing built. The consultant designed adequate mitigation measures and will implement them \nthrough the EMP. PKHA will ensure community cohesion and road safety through the project \ndesign, including \u201ctraffic calming\u201d.10 Since the PKHA\u2019s environmental safeguard capacity is still \nweak,  the  EMP  will  include  capacity  building  and  training  of  PIU  staff  in  environmental \nmanagement. An environment specialist under the construction supervision consulting firm will \nsupport the PIU in ensuring effective EMP implementation by contractors. The consultant held \n                                                \n10 Traffic calming uses physical design and other measures to improve safety for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists. It \naims to encourage safer, more responsible driving and potentially reduce traffic flow. \n ", "  9 \n \n  \npublic consultations in the project area in December 2017. The project team disclosed the draft \nIEE and the EMP on ADB's website on 19 October 2018. \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The additional financing project will undertake \nthe proposed road dualization work within the existing right of way, with widths varying from 25 to \n32 meters. About 38 structures (owned by 38 families) are expected to be impacted partially. The \nimpacts are limited to the sunroof sheds of 8 commercial structures, boundary walls of 4 \nresidential structures, and 26 mobile vendors who will need to move away from the formation \nwidth (within right of way). Additionally, government departments will need to relocate 3,116 wood \nand forest trees, 24 bus stop sheds, and 558 telephone and electricity poles. The impacts are \ndeemed insignificant, however, because no affected person or family will be physically displaced \nfrom housing and/or lose 10% or more of their income-generating resources. Therefore, the \nproject is classified category B for involuntary resettlement. The PKHA has prepared a draft \nresettlement plan in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), which was disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website on 10 September 2018.  \n \n33.  The PIU will implement the resettlement plan through its environment and social unit \n(ESU). A deputy director will serve as ESU\u2019s head, supported by the social safeguards specialist \nof the construction supervision firm. The specialist will assist ESU in updating, implementing, and \nmonitoring  the  resettlement  plan.  PKHA  has  established  a  functioning  grievance  redress \nmechanism, headed by the project director, besides setting up four grievance redress committees \nin built-up areas. PIU will prepare the internal monitoring reports semiannually. A qualified and \nexperienced external monitoring expert, acceptable to ADB, will verify these internal monitoring \nreports, identify issues, and recommend corrective measures, if needed. All monitoring reports \nwill be disclosed on the ADB website.  \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The additional financing project does not involve any \ndistinct ethnic minority community in the project areas, so it does not trigger requirements on \nindigenous peoples under the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \n35.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.11 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe government\u2019s continuously  ADB will maintain its policy dialogue with the Government of \ninsufficient budget for the road  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa about increasing the annual budget for \ntransport sector and unbalanced  road maintenance.
