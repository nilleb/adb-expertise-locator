However, it is \nconstrained  by  an  inefficient  transport  system  with  poor  levels  of  service.  Road  transport \ndominates Pakistan's transport system, accounting for almost 96% of freight traffic in ton-km and \n92%  of  passenger  traffic  in  passenger-km.  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  is  even  more  reliant  on  road \ntransport.  \n \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa has the third-largest provincial economy in Pakistan. Despite major \n4. \nchallenges such as waging war on terrorism (with huge spending on law and order), confronting \npower  load  shedding,  and  having  the  highest  population  growth  rate,  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa \nrecorded the highest economic growth rate in the country. Outperforming the other four provinces \nin  2013\u20132017,  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  registered  an  average  growth  of  5.1%  against  a  national \naverage of 4.5% for the same period. 3 The growth rate could have been higher if road transport \nconnectivity had been better, especially between major cities, because it would have reduced the \ntransport cost of products and improved transport efficiency. \n\n \n5. \nThe existing provincial roads are much below the desired standard both in terms of length \nand pavement condition. Of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's total road network of 15,102 km, 1,878 km is \nclassified as provincial roads. These play a vital role in the economic development of the province \nby  connecting  district  centers  to  the  national  highway  network  and  the  provincial  capital, \nPeshawar,  with  commercial  centers,  district  headquarters,  and  market  towns.  Provincial  roads \nsupport  intraprovincial  trade  and  commerce  as  well  as  access  to  health,  education,  and  other \npublic services; and reduce poverty by creating jobs and business opportunities. \n\n \n6. \nThe damaging effects of heavy axle loads, vulnerability to natural disasters, and limited \nfinancial resources for road maintenance are putting tremendous strain on the road network in \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa. Its performance is fast deteriorating because of high traffic accident rates, \nreduced  pavement  life,  increased  vehicle  operating  costs,  and,  crucially,  a  backlog  in  road \n\n                                                \n1   ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the Islamic \n\nRepublic of Pakistan for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Roads Improvement Project. Manila. \n\n2  ADB provided transaction technical assistance for preparing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Roads Improvement \n\nProject (TA 9194-PAK). \n\n3   H. Pasha. 2018. Growth and Inequality in Pakistan Volume-I. Islamabad. \n\n \n\n\fmaintenance  and  rehabilitation.  In  fact,  only  27%  of  the  provincial  roads  maintained  by  the \nPakhtunkhwa Highways Authority (PKHA) are in fair to good condition; the rest is in poor condition. \n \n7. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  loan  of  $140.0  million,  including  a \nconcessional loan of $18.5 million, on 28 November 2017 for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial \nRoad Improvement Project to rehabilitate eight key road sections of provincial roads over a total \nlength of 214 km, and improve transport efficiency and road safety. In May 2018, the Government \nof Khyber Pakhtunkhwa requested additional financing to dualize most of the existing two-lane \nroad  between  Mardan  and  Swabi. 4  Although  most  of  that  section  is  in  fair  condition,  the \ndualization  serves  to  efficiently  and  effectively  accommodate  an  increase  in  goods  vehicles: \ntrucks  carrying  locally  quarried  stone  and  other  construction  materials,  and  trucks  and  tractor-\ntrailers carrying agricultural and forestry products.  \n\n \n8. \nThe  Mardan\u2013Swabi  road  runs  for  53.9  km  through  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa's  agricultural \nheartland  between  the  Indus  and  Kabul  rivers.  It  connects  Mardan,  the  second-largest  city  in \nKhyber  Pakhtunkhwa,  and  Swabi,  a  college  city  and  the  capital  of  the  fourth  most  populated \ndistrict in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The road is a two-lane single carriageway with urbanized sections \n(strip development) and suffers from chronic traffic congestion and unsafe operating conditions. \nThe  current  mix  of  fast-  and  slow-moving  traffic,  dominated  by  motorcycles  and  rickshaws, \nimposes  constraints  on  speed  and  increases  the  risk  of  collisions.  The  average  daily  traffic \nbetween Mardan and Swabi is about 7,000 vehicles (excluding motorcycles and rickshaws), of \nwhich about 15% are heavy trucks, and traffic has been growing at an average 3.4% annually. \nThe highway supports various agricultural, industrial, commercial, and educational activities. Most \nnotable from a traffic generation point of view are the Premier Sugar Mill and Distillery in Mardan; \nseveral  textile  and  edible-oil  mills;  quarries;  public  universities,  Mishal  Medical  Complex,  and \nnumerous  private  colleges  and  academies;  a  police  training  school;  Shewa  Adda  Camp  for \ninternally  displaced  persons;  and  markets  that  serve  the  surrounding  rural  areas.  Nearby \nRashakai, on the M-1 motorway, was dubbed the \u201cTechnology City\u201d and is expected to develop \ninto  a  high-tech  industrial  zone  as  part  of  the  China\u2212Pakistan  Economic  Corridor  initiative. 5 \nHowever, traffic surveys along the Mardan\u2013Swabi road clearly indicate that the current peak traffic \nvolumes already exceed the road's capacity. Accordingly, the proposed dualization of 42 km of \nthe road into a dual-carriageway, four-lane highway has high public investment priority.  \n\n \n9. \nCurrent project. The current loan is performing satisfactorily, and its implementation is at \nan  advanced  stage.  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  and  PKHA  as  an \nimplementing  agency  signed  the  project  agreements  on  14  March  2018  and  declared  them \neffective on 24 September 2018, with a closing date of 30 June 2023. The current project is rated \non  track  to  deliver  its  expected  outputs  and  meet  its  intended  outcome,  with  contract  awards \ntotaling $90.36 million (64% of the total loan amount) and disbursement of $6.7 million (5% of the \ntotal loan amount) as of 12 November 2018. In July 2018, the project director of PKHA signed all \nnine  civil  works  contracts,  along  with  the  construction  supervision  consultant  contract.  The \nsupervision  consultant  and  the  civil  works  contractors  have  been  mobilized,  and  construction \n\n                                                \n4   The  dualization  of  the  Mardan\u2212Swabi  road  was  part  of  the  original  scope  of  the  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  Provincial \nRoads  Improvement  Project  approved  in  2017.  However,  the  Government  of  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  decided  to \nremove it from the original scope and include it in a separate project to be financed by another development partner. \nLater on, the provincial government changed its plan again and requested ADB to add the dualization back to the \nproject  scope.  However,  when  the  request  was  made,  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  was  almost  completed  and  a  scope \nchange  at  such  a  late  stage  would  have  delayed  the  entire  project  processing.  The  Government  of  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa, reluctant to delay construction works for the originally scoped Mardan\u2013Swabi road, opted to take the \nadditional financing route for its dualization.  \n\n5   ADB recognizes this member as the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n2   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n  \nworks  are  on  schedule.  PKHA  has  been  implementing  the  resettlement  plan  and  the \nenvironmental management plan without major issues. PKHA has also established a grievance \nredress mechanism, and no unresolved grievances or complaints currently exist. The recruitment \nof  the  road  asset  management  consultant  and  procurement  of  maintenance  equipment  are \nongoing.  PKHA  will  procure  two  performance-based  contracts  financed  by  the  government  to \nsupport sustainable road maintenance covering 104 km.  \n\n \n10. \nProposed  additional  financing.  The  provincial  government  is  seeking  additional \nfinancing to widen the 42 km road section between Mardan and Swabi. The additional financing \nwill further strengthen the capacity of the CWD by supporting the government to develop a Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa road network master plan for the next 20 years, and by building a central laboratory \nfor the PKHA and providing training to CWD staff. \n \n11. \nSuitability  of  additional  financing.  The  proposed  additional  financing  meets  the \neligibility criteria because the overall project is (i) technically feasible, economically viable, and \nfinancially  sound  based  on  the  due  diligence;  (ii)  accorded  high  priority  by  the  provincial \ngovernment  as  reflected  in  its  annual  development  plan;  (iii)  consistent  with  the  transport \ndevelopment objectives of the current project, as it will enhance the outcome and outputs of the \ncurrent project; and (iv) consistent with the country partnership strategy, 2015\u22122019 for Pakistan, \nwhich aims to improve physical connectivity and enhance regional integration. 6 Given the strong \nlink with the current project in terms of design and implementation arrangements, the additional \nfinancing  will  offer  substantial  efficiency  gains  in  project  processing  and  help  meet  the  overall \nproject outcome in a timely manner.  \n\n \nValue added by ADB assistance. Under the additional financing, ADB will support the \n12. \nprovincial government in developing a 20-year Khyber Pakhtunkhwa road network master plan. \nThis is in addition to initiatives financed by the current project, such as piloting performance-based \nroad  maintenance,  enhancing  the  road  asset  management  system,  and  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  the  CWD.  Despite  the  large  quantum  of  road  investments  in  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa \nsince 2000s, some investments have fallen short of achieving the expected outcomes because \nof  unprecedented  changes  in  the  structure  and  composition  of  the  provincial  economy.  The \nmaster plan will assess (i) the status and condition of the overall transport system, including all \nmodes; (ii) the characteristics of transport demand and supply; (iii) the current and projected road \ntraffic demand, reflecting trends in economic growth and regional and subregional trade, as well \nas the transport modal split; and (iv) the spatial distribution, serviceability, and condition of road \ninfrastructure. The master plan will identify the physical gaps and capacity constraints in Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa\u2019s road network relative to current and future traffic demand, as well as the policy \nand  institutional  improvements  needed  to  satisfy  the  mobility  and  logistics  requirements  of  a \nmodern economy. The development of a road network master plan under the additional financing \nwill strengthen the overall capacity of the CWD\uf8e7from road planning to construction, to operation, \nto maintenance. \n \nImpact and Outcome  \n\nB. \n \n13. \nThe  current  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  an  efficient  and  integrated \ntransportation  network  established  (Pakistan  Vision  2025). 7 The  current  project  will  have  the \nfollowing outcome: efficiency and safety along key sections of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial \n\n                                                \n6   ADB. 2015.

The additional financing will reinforce the overall aggregate impact of the \ncurrent project, and the overall project outcome will remain the same. \n \nC. \n \n14. \n \n15. \nOutput  1:  Provincial  road  rehabilitated.  The  output  will  rehabilitate  42  km  of  the \nprovincial road between Mardan and Swabi by upgrading it to four lanes and to provincial road \nstandards with tolling and better road safety measures, and by adding climate resilience features \nto withstand damage and disruption from natural disasters. \n  \nOutput 2: The CWD\u2019s institutional capacity for road management strengthened. The \n16. \noutput will further strengthen the CWD\u2019s institutional capacity by building a central laboratory for \nthe PKHA and developing a Khyber Pakhtunkhwa road network master plan. The master plan will \nbe fully gender-responsive. 8 \n\n \nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe overall project is estimated to cost $249 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Overall Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nCurrent \nAmounta \n\nAdditional \nFinancingb \n\nTotal \n\nA.

A national design consulting \n24. \nfirm engaged by the CWD prepared its detailed design. It will widen the existing two-lane Mardan\u2013\n                                                \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n  \nSwabi road into a four-lane divided highway on both sides of the existing carriageway along the \nexisting  alignment,  maximizing  the  use  of  existing  pavement.  New  Jersey  barriers  or  an  open \nmedian will separate the two-way traffic with improved intersection design and U-turns to eliminate \npotential collisions and other safety hazards. Service roads are provided to segregate the non-\nmotorized traffic when space is allowed. The detailed design also includes construction of: (i) 11 \nfootbridges and two underpasses to provide safer crossing for pedestrians, (ii) a dedicated lane \nfor slow-moving traffic to segregate fast-moving traffic to improve the road safety when space is \nallowed,  and  (iii)  a  covered  side  drain  and  lighting  in  urban  sections.  The  detailed  design \nconsultant conducted a road safety audit and incorporated most of the advice either in the final \ndesign or to be included during construction stage. The design, especially for bridges, culverts \nand  drainage  facilities,  considers  the  impact  of  climate  change  and  natural  disasters  such  as \nfloods. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nEconomic.  The  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  additional  financing  project  is \neconomically viable with an economic internal rate of return of 10%, and a net present value of \n$11.5 million at a 9% discount rate. Economic benefits from the project comprise reduced routine \nand periodic maintenance costs for the road agency, and savings in vehicle operating costs and \ntravel time after dualization. The economic viability is robust against increases in capital costs as \nwell as a reduction in benefits. The economic analysis does not include road safety benefits, which \nwill accrue from road safety improvement features. Sensitivity tests revealed that the project is \nrobust against all major parameters, including increases in capital costs and reductions in forecast \ntraffic. \n \n26. \nFinancial. A review of the financial position of the PKHA indicates that the province should \nbe able to allocate sufficient funds for road maintenance to ensure that the project road can be \nsustained.  The current road maintenance budget is less than 10% of the total PKHA budget and \nis funded from a combination of its own revenues and allocations from the provincial government.  \nIn  previous  years,  whenever  the  length  of  roads  to  be  maintained  under  the  PKHA  budget \nincreased, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increased the maintenance budget.  \n\n \nThe PKHA undertook a program analysis using Highway Development and Management \n27. \nModel  4,  which  suggests  that  the  network  could  be  maintained  in  good  condition  under  an \nunconstrained budget scenario of PRs3.00 billion per year, as opposed to the budget allocation \nof PRs1.05 billion for 2017\u22122018, which would result in average road conditions remaining poor. \nThe PKHA is committed to increasing the budget allocation and raises some of its revenues from \ntolls, but the number of sites is limited, so it is heavily dependent on money allocated from the \nprovincial  budget.  The  introduction  of  tolls  on  roads  that  have  been  upgraded  will  assist  in \nensuring that the roads can be properly maintained in the future. Tolling the project road at rates \ncurrently  applicable  to  national  highways  will  generate  enough  revenue  to  pay  for  incremental \nroutine and periodic maintenance. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n \n28. \nADB  assessed  the  PKHA\u2019s  capacity  for  procurement  and  financial  management  as \nessential part of project implementation and found it to be sufficient for managing the procurement, \nfinancial,  and  implementation  tasks,  including  maintaining  the  accounting  systems,  financial \ncontrols, and audit arrangements. The PKHA\u2019s financial management risk is substantial prior to \nmitigation  measures.  The  project  team  defined  an  action  plan  with  mitigation  measures  in  the \nfinancial  management  section  of  the  PAM.  The  PKHA  is  experienced  and  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \n\n \n\n\fprocurement and consultant recruitment procedures from successfully procuring nine civil works \ncontracts and one consultant contract under the current project. ADB will conduct further training \non strengthening the grievance redress mechanism for matters of procurement, accountability, \nand contract management during project implementation. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PKHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n \n30. \nThe project team conducted public consultations with the communities along the proposed \n42  km  Mardan\u2013Swabi  road  project.  An  analysis  of  key  stakeholder  perceptions  and  concerns \nabout  the  additional  financing  project  shows  positive  feedback  and  no  major  adverse  social \nimpacts. The main direct beneficiaries of the project will be agricultural traders, freight forwarders, \ntransporters, commuters, and those living and working along the project road sections. Indirect \nbeneficiaries  include  large  segments  of  the  population  who  will  gain  from  more  employment \nopportunities in trade and transport and ready access to markets and resources in the province. \nThe  local  population  will  benefit  from  job  creation  during  construction  and  operation  of  the \nadditional financing project. The project has been categorized some gender elements because \nwomen  will  benefit  from  better  access  to  basic  social  services  such  as  health,  education,  and \nsocial  networking  facilities.  To  enhance  road  users\u2019  convenience  and  comfort,  PKHA  will \nincorporate road safety features in the engineering designs, which will help reduce accidents and \nfatalities  along  Mardan\u2013Swabi  road.  In  addition,  PKHA  will  include  the  following  key  gender \nactions  during  implementation:  (i)  road  safety  measures  such  as  footbridges  near  schools, \nhospitals, and other areas frequently visited by women and children; (ii) roadside bus shelters for \nwomen  passengers;  (iii)  capacity  building  for  women  staff  at  the  CWD;  and  (iv) additional \nassistance to households headed by women as part of the resettlement plan, if necessary. The \nadditional  financing  will  also  include  the  development  of  a  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  road  network \nmaster plan which will be fully gender-responsive (footnote 8). \n \nE. \n \n31. \nEnvironment (category B). The design consultant engaged by the PKHA prepared an \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  IEE  anticipates  environmental \nimpacts  during construction  to  be  predominantly  site-specific  and temporary.  Among  them  are \npotential traffic disruptions; limited access to adjoining properties; noise, vibration, and air quality \nimpacts on sensitive receptors; utility relocation; logging of roadside trees, and impacts related to \noccupational and community health and safety. During operation, the additional financing project \nwill likely have impacts related to higher noise and air pollution levels, as well as community health \nand safety. It can also cause community severance while additional lanes and the median are \nbeing  built.  The  consultant  designed  adequate  mitigation  measures  and  will  implement  them \nthrough  the  EMP.  PKHA  will  ensure  community  cohesion  and  road  safety  through  the  project \ndesign, including \u201ctraffic calming\u201d. 10 Since the PKHA\u2019s environmental safeguard capacity is still \nweak,  the  EMP  will  include  capacity  building  and  training  of  PIU  staff  in  environmental \nmanagement. An environment specialist under the construction supervision consulting firm will \nsupport the PIU in ensuring effective EMP implementation by contractors. The consultant held \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n10 Traffic calming uses physical design and other measures to improve safety for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists. It \n\naims to encourage safer, more responsible driving and potentially reduce traffic flow. \n\n8   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n \n  \npublic consultations in the project area in December 2017. The project team disclosed the draft \nIEE and the EMP on ADB's website on 19 October 2018. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The additional financing project will undertake \nthe proposed road dualization work within the existing right of way, with widths varying from 25 to \n32 meters. About 38 structures (owned by 38 families) are expected to be impacted partially. The \nimpacts  are  limited  to  the  sunroof  sheds  of  8  commercial  structures,  boundary  walls  of  4 \nresidential  structures,  and  26  mobile  vendors  who  will  need  to  move  away  from  the  formation \nwidth (within right of way). Additionally, government departments will need to relocate 3,116 wood \nand forest trees, 24 bus stop sheds, and 558 telephone and electricity poles. The impacts are \ndeemed insignificant, however, because no affected person or family will be physically displaced \nfrom  housing  and/or  lose  10%  or  more  of  their  income-generating  resources.  Therefore,  the \nproject  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The  PKHA  has  prepared  a  draft \nresettlement plan in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), which was disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website on 10 September 2018.  \n \nThe  PIU  will  implement  the  resettlement  plan  through  its  environment  and  social  unit \n33. \n(ESU). A deputy director will serve as ESU\u2019s head, supported by the social safeguards specialist \nof the construction supervision firm. The specialist will assist ESU in updating, implementing, and \nmonitoring  the  resettlement  plan.  PKHA  has  established  a  functioning  grievance  redress \nmechanism, headed by the project director, besides setting up four grievance redress committees \nin built-up areas. PIU will prepare the internal monitoring reports semiannually. A qualified and \nexperienced external monitoring expert, acceptable to ADB, will verify these internal monitoring \nreports, identify issues, and recommend corrective measures, if needed. All monitoring reports \nwill be disclosed on the ADB website.  \n \n34. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The additional financing project does not involve any \ndistinct  ethnic  minority  community  in  the  project  areas,  so  it  does  not  trigger  requirements  on \nindigenous peoples under the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF. \n \n35. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. 11 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe government\u2019s continuously \ninsufficient budget for the road \ntransport sector and unbalanced \npublic investments in favor of road \nconstruction rather than road \nmaintenance result in the \nunsustainability of road maintenance. \n\nThe government may not approve the \npreparation of the Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa road network master \nplan because of budget constraints.  \n\nADB will maintain its policy dialogue with the Government of \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa about increasing the annual budget for \nroad maintenance. The target will be linked with the outcomes \nof RAMS which will be improved and upgraded under the \nexisting project. Tolling is considered for some road sections of \nthe overall project to increase the revenue of the PKHA. A PBM \npilot under the current project will explore ensuring ways to \ncommit maintenance fund on contractual term. \nThe steering committee approved to finance the development \nof the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa road network master plan with the \nprovincial budget. It was agreed that any future ADB funded \nprojects will be based on the master plan to give incentive to \nthe provincial government. \n\n                                                \n11 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fADB = Asian Development Bank, PBM = performance-based maintenance, PKHA = Pakhtunkhwa Highways Authority, \nRAMS = road asset management system. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n \n36. \nThe  Government  of  Pakistan,  the  Government  of  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa,  and  the  PKHA \nhave  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  additional  financing  project  shall  conform  to  all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents.
