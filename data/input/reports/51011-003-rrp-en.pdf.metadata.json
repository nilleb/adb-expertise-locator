THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Skills and Employability Enhancement Project. The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for \nInformation and Communication Technology (JFICT) for the project and if the Board approves \nthe proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration  of  the grant.  The  project  aims  to promote  inclusive  growth  in Tajikistan  by \nimproving  the vocational, technical and soft skills and employability of youth  (ages 15\u201329), \nwomen, and labor migrants. It will  support  (i) the construction  of migration  service centers \n(MSCs) to provide more comprehensive services to labor migrants; (ii) the construction of model \n\u2018Job Centers\u2019 that will provide market-responsive training and employment services for youth and \nwomen; and (iii) the capacity development of migration and employment agencies. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Economic development and poverty reduction. Following the end of the civil war in \n1997, political stability and foreign aid led to growth in gross domestic product (GDP) at 7.0% \nbeing among the highest in the Central Asia region during 2000\u20132017.1 Nominal GDP per capita \nfluctuated at about $800 during 2016\u22122018. Recent changes, including re-opening borders with \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and Uzbekistan, and increasing trade with Afghanistan, have \nopened a window of opportunity  to enhance regional  integration and provide Tajikistan  with \naccess to wider markets.2 Economic growth has, however, not been inclusive or sustainable. \nBoth household incomes and socio-economic conditions of the poorest quantile show that the \nfruits of recent growth  have  not been  widely shared  among the people  of  Tajikistan.3 The \nreduction in poverty in the country that has taken place can be largely attributed to the catch-up \ngrowth during 2000\u20132010, while subsequent growth has had only a small impact on poverty. \nBetween 2015 and 2018, the Tajik economy expanded by more than 20.0% in real terms, but \nthe poverty headcount ratio fell by less than two percentage  points.4 Tajikistan is still highly \nremittance dependent and a low-income country, ranking 148th in terms of GDP per capita5 and \n125th  on the United  Nations'  Human Development Index.6 There  is substantial variation  in \npoverty across the regions. In 2018, the poverty rate was 37.8% in the Districts of Republican \nSubordination7 and 37.7% in the Khatlon Region, versus 19.9% in Dushanbe City.8 The poverty \nand social conditions have significantly worsened in Tajikistan due to the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) crisis. The project is highly relevant to the current needs of Tajik labors and will help \nthe fragile economy in rural Tajikistan to recover after the pandemic has subsided.  \n \n \n1  World  Bank.  2019.

The  COVID-19  impact  in  Tajikistan.  The  World  Health  Organization  declared  \nCOVID-19  a global  pandemic  on 11 March  2020.  To prevent the spread  of the  virus,  the \nGovernment of Tajikistan (the government) imposed strict border controls on 28 February 2020, \nprohibiting entry of individuals from high-risk countries. The government announced the first \ncases of COVID-19 on 30 April 2020. The pandemic has affected both domestic and destination \nlabor markets for migrants from Tajikistan. As a result of the pandemic,  real GDP growth is \npredicted  to  be  only  1.0%  in  2020.9 The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  estimates  that \nremittances to Tajikistan will be reduced by at least 35% for 2020, due to the combined effects \nof the global COVID-19 pandemic and lower oil prices. The project will help unemployed workers \nand returning migrants to acquire skills and find jobs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \n4.  Labor market constraints. Tajikistan\u2019s labor market faces several legacy challenges \nincluding: (i) lagging industrial transformation; (ii) low labor productivity and labor mismatch; and \n(iii) limited job opportunities.  While agriculture accounts  for only 25.5%  of GDP, the sector \nprovides  57.7%  of  jobs,  most  of  which  are  unpaid  and  seasonal.  In  the  2019  Global \nCompetitiveness Index, Tajikistan was ranked 104th out of 141 countries.10 Low competitiveness \nis partly due to limited access to information and communications technology (ICT). In 2017, only \n28.2% of the population used the internet and 70.5% used a mobile phone. According to the \n2018 Labor Force Survey, 50.2% of employed adults performed work that did not correspond to \ntheir level of acquired skills, indicating a major mismatch in the labor market. Real GDP grew by \nmore than 7.0% per year during 2003\u20132018, but employment expanded by only 2.1% annually. \nMany young workers continue to enter the labor market each year given that 55.0% of the \npopulation is younger than 25 years of age. Tajikistan\u2019s economy could benefit from these young \nworkers if they were well trained, and jobs were available.   \n \n5.  Youth and women marginalized. Youth and women are among the disadvantaged in \nTajikistan, particularly those in rural areas where job opportunities, average wages, and social \nservices are limited. As indicated in the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2030,11 the major \ndeterminant of poverty in Tajikistan is lack of access to productive employment. Youth tend to \nface barriers to finding jobs as they lack the skills and experience required by employers. To help \nyouth find productive employment, the government and development partners have invested in \nformal technical and vocational education and training (TVET), which is typically longer than one \nyear. However, the youth unemployment rate in 2019 remained high at 21%12 and about 30% of \nyouth were not in education, employment or training (NEET).13 Some unemployed youth leave \nthe country in search of jobs, while other out-of-school youth remain in the country, but are unable \nto access affordable skills training, and become unemployed or under-employed in the domestic \nlabor market. Labor market opportunities for women are even more limited. The female labor \nforce participation rate was only 32.6% in 2016. Female youth have always maintained higher \nNEET rates than male youth, and it reached about 52% in 2013. Poor families do not send their \ndaughters for training because of financial and cultural constraints. There are compelling needs \nthat justify promoting youth and female skills development.14  \n \n \n9  International Monetary Fund. 2020. World Economy Outlook 2020.

About 500,000 Tajik \ncitizens migrate each year, mostly to the Russian Federation. Remittances from labor migrants \nare equivalent to about a third of the country\u2019s GDP. The largest group of migrants (45.4%) are \nyouth aged 15\u201329, and more than 85.0% of migrants are from poor rural areas. Tajik migrants \nmainly find low-paying and temporary jobs in destination countries, typically in construction and \ntransport. Currently, there are only four pre-departure migration centers operating in the country, \nbut no post-return services are available. Budget limitations and a lack of technical experts who \ncan  deal  with  the  multi-dimensional  challenges  faced  by  labor  migrants  have  limited  the \navailability of pre-departure services. The lack of pre-departure orientation has led most migrants \nto  leave  the  country  without  fundamental  knowledge  about  migration,  exposing  them  to \nexploitation and abuse.15 Migrants tend to have limited financial and ICT knowledge, both of \nwhich are important for safe remittance and increased access to information on labor security. \nLong-term migration often results in family separation and increases the number of single-parent \nfamilies in poverty. The psycho-social problems faced by migrants have not been addressed by \nthe existing pre-departure migration centers.  \n \n7.  The  economic  recession  and  legislative changes  in migrant  policies  in the Russian \nFederation have resulted in 263,000 Tajik migrant workers being banned from the country as of \n2019.16 The COVID-19 pandemic in the Russian Federation and other destination countries will \ndrastically  increase  the  number  of migrants  returning  to  Tajikistan.17 The  2018  migration \nhousehold survey showed that about 50% of returning migrants were not able to find employment \nupon their  return.18 Youth migrants  who  have  been  banned  from  returning  to the  Russian \nFederation and who cannot find domestic employment are one of the most vulnerable groups in \nTajikistan. It is therefore important to (i) help returning migrants use the advanced vocational \nskills they acquired through  their employment  in more developed  countries; and (ii) provide \ninformation and support on how to reintegrate into society either by finding a job or by starting a \nbusiness. \n \n8.  Inequitable access to and low relevance of public employment services. In 2017, \nTajikistan\u2019s Public Employment Services registered only about 20% of all unemployed. Most did not \nregister with the service agency for various reasons, including a lack of awareness or perception of \npoor services provided and the unattractive nature of jobs offered. There is only limited labor market \ninformation, job counselling and job matching support for job seekers. The lack of computer-based \njob matching  services  and trained  job  counsellors  result  in long  periods  of job  searches, \nparticularly for young workers who lack work experience. Females with children have even more \nrestricted  access to skills training  because  external child-care  services are not available in \nculturally conventional rural areas.   \n   \n9.  Many TVET schools do not offer accommodation or transportation services. The Ministry of \nLabour, Migration and Employment (MOLME) is responsible for initial vocational education and \ntraining (IVET) schools, which offer full-time vocational education at secondary education level, but \nit is underfunded. In 2018, 15.90% of total government expenditure went to education, but only \n \n15 Japan International Cooperation Agency Research Institute. 2019.

MOLME also operates 35 adult learning centers (ALCs) where the principal \ntarget groups are vulnerable youth and women. However, these are in dilapidated facilities and \ntraining  programs  offered in these  ALCs have  outdated curricula  that do  not focus  on the \ncompetencies required for the most in-demand occupations. Research indicates that soft skills \nare  crucial  for  improving  employability  and  different  soft  skills  are  needed  for  different \noccupations  and  job  levels.  However,  the  value of  soft  skills  in the  workplace  is  not fully \nrecognized in Tajikistan and no structured soft skills training programs exist. While ICT skills are \nimperative for many modern occupations, the quality of ICT training in this area is poor because \nof the lack of qualified ICT teachers who can easily find better paying ICT-related jobs outside \nALCs. ALCs are tasked with certifying the undocumented skills of returning migrants, but the lack \nof  established  assessment  methods  means  that  ALC  certificates  have  little  effect  on \nemployability.  \n \n10.  Weak planning and management capacity for migration and employment services. \nTajikistan  lacks  an  internationally  standardized  job  classification  system  and labor  market \ndatabase in which labor data is collected and published at regular intervals, using the same \nmethods and codes. Tajikistan uses the National Classification of Occupations (NCO) based on \nthe International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO-88), which is outdated and \nunsuitable for classifying existing occupations. In 2008, the International Labour Organization \n(ILO) released the International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008 (ISCO-08) which \nmany countries have now adopted to build their policy planning and administration for human \nresource  development. 19  As  a  result,  the  qualifications  of  Tajik  migrants  under  its  \nISCO-88-based NCO no longer match the occupation classifications in overseas labor markets \nwhere the jobs are classified based on ISCO-08. Tajik engineers and teachers can often only low-\npaid, unskilled jobs in destination countries, partly because their qualifications are not recognized. \n \n11.  The limited availability of reliable labor data makes it difficult to monitor and detect distortions \nin the labor market, make knowledge-based decisions regarding needed interventions, and design \nand deliver training programs that are responsive to the labor market. As such, MOLME has faced \ndifficulty in planning skills training for major industries. For instance, the government has identified \ntourism as a priority sector with high job creation potential, but labor information on the sector is \nscarce. The tourism satellite account for government data has not been established20 and the \nrequired occupations, number of workers, and skill levels are not available. IVET schools and ALCs \nseldom  conduct  tracer  surveys  of  graduates  because  they  lack  tracking  mechanisms  and \nresources, making it difficult to examine the benefits and effectiveness of training programs. Low \npublic awareness of migration and employment services results in limited utilization of the labor \nmarket portal under MOLME. About 60.0% of job seekers in Tajikistan found employment through \nfriends and relatives, while only 5.8% found jobs using the portal.  \n \n12.  National  Development  Strategy  2030.  The  NDS  has  three  strategic  objectives:  \n(i) reduction of vulnerability in future development; (ii) more efficient use of natural resources; \nand (iii) innovation through the integration of new development into the country\u2019s social and \neconomic mainstreams. To achieve its objectives, the NDS acknowledges the importance of \nexpansion of productive employment and proposes the following actions to improve employment \noutcomes: (i) develop the network for professional skills development considering the needs of \nwomen, youth and vulnerable segments of the population; (ii) diversify foreign labor migration \n \n19 K.G.

ADB assistance to the sector and lessons. Tajikistan\u2019s first skills development project, \nthe Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project, was approved by \nADB in 2015.21 It supports  initial and  secondary  TVET  by  introducing   competency-based \ntraining, training vocational teachers, upgrading facilities and equipment of vocational lyceums \nand colleges, and conducting a market responsive and inclusive training survey. Lessons learned \nfrom the TVET project include: (i) there is a significant need for quality short-term training for out-\nof-school youth; (ii) improvement is needed in employability as well as skills; (iii) labor market \ndata collection and job classification systems should be strengthened; and (iv) more targeted \nsupport should be provided to address the demand- and supply-side constraints for girls and \nwomen in the skills sector. \n \n14.  Alignment with the ADB country strategy and Strategy 2030. The project aligns with \nADB\u2019s country strategy for Tajikistan to develop skills and continue to support education, TVET, \nand  employment. 22  It  supports  three  ADB  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities:  \n(i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by (a) promoting social inclusion and \ndevelopment by providing incentives for disadvantaged youth and women to attend job center \ntraining, (b) improving education and training through improving the quality and relevance of \ntraining at Job Centers and MSCs, and (c) by ensuring social protection for those in need by \nreducing the risks associated with labor migration; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality \nby encouraging  women\u2019s  capacity  development  and  knowledge  of job availability;  and  (iii) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity by increasing the capacity of migration and \nemployment service agencies.23  \n \n15.  Development  partners  coordination.  ADB  is  Tajikistan\u2019s  major  partner  for  TVET \ndevelopment helping the government introduce the new competency-based training approach to \nthe TVET sector. The United States Agency for International Development and the UNICEF \nfocus  on  basic  education,  and  the  World  Bank  on  higher  education.  Opportunities  for \ncollaboration have been and will be explored through regular information sharing and dialogue \namong development partners active in youth employment, including the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization  of  the  United  Nations,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the \nInternational Labour Organization, and the International Organization for Migration. \n \nB.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n17.  Output 1: More inclusive and targeted migration support provided. To reduce the \nrisks of migration for youth and help them find better jobs, the project will establish and equip \nthree new MSCs that will provide (i) a new pre-departure orientation program; (ii) a new pre-\nemployment program; (iii) a new ICT literacy program; (iv) a pilot for behavioral change initiatives \nfor migrants and migrant families; and (v) job counselling services for returning migrant workers. \nThe new MSCs will be constructed in Khujand, Bokhtar and Vose, where a large number of youth \nmigrate to find employment, but where no pre-departure service centers are available.25 The \nMSCs will offer one-stop service centers to departing and returning migrants. Migrants will be \nregistered in the database of the centers. The migration orientation program, short language \ntraining, and entry-level skills training will help migrants find better jobs and safer living conditions \nin the destination  countries. The centers will also provide financial literacy training for safe \nremittance transmission and ICT training for easier access to social welfare information. The \nproject will train migration counsellors who will provide pilot family counselling  for improved \nfinancial  planning  and  reintegration.  Returning  migrants  will  also  be  assisted  in  finding \nemployment  and information on entrepreneurship  and available micro-financing in case they \nwish to start micro and small businesses using their remittance savings.  \n \n18.  Output 2: Access to and relevance of public employment services enhanced. To \nprovide better service to youth and female jobs seekers, the project will establish and equip three \nnew model Job Centers that will provide (i) enhanced comprehensive employment  services, \nincluding skills training; (ii) childcare centers and a pilot stipend program for female job seekers; \n(iii) a pilot program of new and more focused soft skills training; (iv) job counselling services to \nmatch interests and skills to potential jobs; and (v) ICT skills training programs for selected \nsectors. Job Centers with dormitories will be built and equipped in Dushanbe for tourism, in \nRogun for energy, and in Dangara for agriculture. The sites for the Job Centers were selected \nbased on an assessment of the potential for local labor market needs. Job Centers will provide \nskills training for selected occupations in the three above-mentioned targeted sectors identified \nthrough consultations with line ministries and industrial associations. The new training programs \nwill be designed for a shorter period than conventional training for disadvantaged groups who \ncannot afford the cost or time for full-time TVET programs. Training programs will be developed \nbased on the competency-based training approach and training materials that were piloted under \nthe TVET project where private sector will participate in the training verification process. To \nencourage women to participate in training, free childcare services and stipends will be provided \nto female trainees. The project will pilot a new soft skills training targeting conscientiousness and \nagreeableness.26 Job  counselling  will be provided  using  updated  ICT equipment  and  new \naptitude testing software.  \n \n19.  Output  3:    Planning  and  management  of  migration  and  employment  services \nstrengthened. To provide better service to youth and female job seekers and migrant youth \nworkers the project will (i) develop the new NCO based on ISCO-08 and help apply the NCO  to \nthe training certifications and labor market surveys; (ii) pilot a skills and employment survey for \nthe tourism sector; (iii) expand the labor market portal under MOLME and undertake client job \ncenter tracking surveys; (iv) provide training for MOLME and migration and employment agency \n \n24 For this project, youth is defined as the labor force population aged 15\u201329. The Labor Force Surveys of Tajikistan \nprovide statistics for the 15\u201319, 20\u201324, and 25\u201329 age categories.   \n25 The Dushanbe Job Center will serve as the 4th Migration Service Center. \n26 D.

The  NCO  based on  ISCO-08  will help  improve  the \nrecognition of skills qualifications of Tajik job seekers in the regional labor market. The tourism \nsurvey will estimate the employment size for occupations, needs for further development of skills, \nand areas of employment growth in the sector. Experience during this pilot will enable MOLME \nto undertake similar surveys for other sectors. The project will improve the coverage and data \naccuracy of the existing labor market portal. A large-scale tracer study of the beneficiaries of Job \nCenters will assess the project impact. An awareness campaign will be organized to promote \nMOLME\u2019s migration and employment services. Since training participants will be certified by the \nState Institute ALC in Dushanbe, the project will provide training to selected ALCs to strengthen \nthe certification capacity. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n20.  The project is built upon the lessons learned from the TVET project, and ADB\u2019s long \ninvolvement in the skills development sector. The design of the project scope was based on the \nfindings of ADB-funded knowledge products.27 The key and innovative features of the project \ninclude (i) a timely response to the COVID-19  with the anticipated synergy and complementarity \nwith other ADB-supported government projects on COVID-19 mitigation;28 (ii) the first large-scale \nemployment project in Tajikistan targeting the youth outside TVET system; (iii) promoting ICT, \nwhich is one of the most critical competencies needed for employment in the Industry 4.0 era; \nand (iv) directly contributing to human capital development of Tajikistan that will help promote \ninvestments from private sector.   \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The project is estimated to cost $34.65 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).29 The \ngovernment  has  requested  a  grant  not exceeding  $30  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The government has also \nrequested a grant of $1.5 million from the JFICT.  \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem      Amount  \nA. Base Costs   \n   1.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  Project organization  structure.  MOLME  will be the project executing  agency. The \nproject administration group (PAG), to be established under MOLME based on the TVET project \nPAG, will be the implementing agency. The PAG manager will monitor and guide day-to-day \nimplementation. Key PAG staff to be financed by the project will be selected following competitive \nprocedures. PAG will procure goods, equipment, civil works, and consultants financed by ADB \nand JFICT. An inter-ministerial steering committee will be set up to provide overall guidance on \nproject  implementation.  The implementation  arrangements  are summarized  in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2020\u2013September 2026  \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2026 \nEstimated grant closing date  31 March 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Inter-ministerial Steering Committee  \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOLME \n(iii)  Key implementing  PAG under MOLME  \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  PAG \nProcurement  OCB Works \u2013  3 contracts  $11.14 million  \n(internationally advertised)  \nOCB Works \u2013 (nationally  3 contracts  $2.87 million  \nadvertised) \nGoods \u2013 OCB (nationally  21 contracts  $4.62 million \nadvertised) \nRFQ, Goods   2 contracts  $0.11 million \n ", "9 \nAspects  Arrangements \nConsulting services   Individual Consultant  3 person-months, international;  $2.94 million  \nSelection    7,268 person months, national  \nQuality and Cost Based  22 person-months, international;  $1.63 million  \nSelection method   290 person months, national  \n  Fixed Budget Selection  5 person-months, international;  $0.67 million \n156 person months, national \n  Consultant\u2019s Qualification  6 person-months, international;  $0.71 million \nSelection  305 person-months, national  \n  Least Cost Selection   Lump Sum  $0.10 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  (i) Advance contracting action with retroactive financing: PAG staff (key staff); and \nadvance contracting   (ii) Advance contracting action without retroactive financing: (a) Detailed Design \nfor Civil Works Consultant, (b) Individual consultants, (c) Project Implementation \nSupport Consultants, and (d) PAG vehicles. \nDisbursement   The  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed  arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MOLME = Ministry of Labour, Migration and Employment, OCB = open competitive \nbidding, PAG = project administration group, RFQ = request for quotation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED GRANT ASSISTANCE \n \n24.  A grant is proposed to be requested from the JFICT to support the activities related to \nICT under the project. The major outputs of the grant are: (i) ICT skills and knowledge improved; \n(ii) ICT equipment provided; and (iii) labor market database and systems strengthened. The \nJFICT grant will partly finance: (i) the consultants and Job Center staff who will develop and \ndeliver ICT training; (ii) provision of ICT equipment to the labor market portal and software for \njob counselling; and (iii) the consultants and PAG staff who will provide capacity development of \npublic migration and employment services.  \n \n25.  Grant  activities  are  estimated  to  cost  $1.65  million.  This  excludes  the  cost  of \nadministrative budget support and will be financed by a grant from JFICT of $1.5 million and a \ncounterpart contribution of $0.15 million. The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform  of  tax  exemptions  and  other  in-kind  contributions  for  the  grant.  The  grant  will  be \nadministered by ADB and implemented with MOLME as the executing agency and the PAG as \nthe implementing agency.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  Economic analysis.30  The project will strengthen the capacity and skills of migrant and \ndomestic workers to improve their employability and wages. This is especially important now as \nTajikistan  is expected  to  see an  increase  in  unemployment  and  loss  of jobs  due  to  the  \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The project will help to re-skill affected workers and cushion Tajikistan \nfrom the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on human capital. The MSCs will serve an incremental \nnumber of about 9,328 migrant workers annually or about 191,228 migrant workers during 2024\u2013\n2044, who are projected to generate about $4.38 billion in incremental remittances. The project \nwill also increase the number of Job Center graduates who are expected to realize an annual \nwage that will be 10.0% higher than the minimum wage in the targeted sectors. The \u201cwith\u201d and \n \n30 The economic analysis followed ADB guidelines, i.e., ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects \n(as amended from time to time). Manila. \n ", "10 \n\u201cwithout\u201d  training employment  rates31 are assumed  at 55.0%  and  40.0%,  respectively.  The \nproject  will produce an additional  36,506  Job  Center  graduates,  of  whom  22,425  will  find \nemployment and generate about $369 million in income earnings during 2024\u20132044. The project \nis expected to realize an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 11.5%, at a discount rate of \n9.0% and will generate a net present value of $12.8 million over the life of the project. It is also \nassessed to be resilient to changes as the EIRR remains at economically viable levels even with \nsignificant changes in project costs, the number of migrant workers availing of migration services, \nand the number of Job Center graduates.  \n \n27.  Financial analysis. The fiscal impact and sustainability analysis on the government\u2019s \nability to provide counterpart funds, recurrent and maintenance costs was undertaken. The costs \nof  tax  exemptions  and  social  taxes  are less  than  0.1%  of the government\u2019s  total  annual \nexpenditure.  The additional recurrent and investment costs to operate the Job Centers  and \nMSCs beyond the project implementation  period will be low (a maximum of 0.06% of total \ngovernment  expenditure  in  fiscal  year  2033).  The  analysis  confirms  that  this  is a fiscally \nsustainable investment. \n \nB.  Sustainability \n \n28.   Economic sustainability. The government is committed to implementing an effective, \ncontinuing program to improve the quality and delivery of TVET to allow more skilled laborers to \nparticipate in domestic and foreign labor markets. A relevant and market-oriented TVET system \nwill,  in  turn,  increase  skilled  workers\u2019  income-generating  capacity  and  encourage  migrant \nworkers  to  continue  and  increase remittances  to their families  in Tajikistan. The  economic \nbenefits generated will ensure the project\u2019s long-term sustainability and contribute to sustaining \nthe country\u2019s economic growth and current development trends. \n \n29.  Continuation of the project centers after project completion. The government has \ncommitted to continue to operate and maintain the Job Centers and MSCs that were developed \nunder the project after project completion. This is confirmed as part of the project assurances \nand covenants.   \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  Financial  management  and  procurement.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk is substantial mainly due to weaknesses in the current accounting manual, \nannual budgeting, internal auditing and controls over the accounting software.  Measures to \nmitigate the risks include strengthening the accounting manual, earlier submission of annual \nbudgets, including the project in the annual plan of the MOLME Internal Audit Department, and \nimproving  accounting  software  controls. Agency  and project  procurement  risk assessments \nconcluded that the procurement risk rating is low for PAG. The procurement capacity of the PAG \nin the ongoing TVET project is assessed to be high and the key TVET project PAG staff will \ncontinue to implement the project. Measures to mitigate risks include: (i) all parties involved in \nprocurement must sign a statement of ethics and a declaration of no potential conflict of interest \nin any  procurement  activity;  and  (ii) a standard  statement  of ethics  will be  included  as a \nrequirement in bid documents. The procurement plan will be updated regularly, and proposed \nchanges will require ADB approval. ADB will handle for oversight and monitoring, including the \ninitial procurement plan and any subsequent changes. \n \n31 Employment rates are defined as the percentage of Job Center beneficiaries who find a job within one year of \nfinishing the training.  \n ", "11 \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government  and the MOLME. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  Poverty and  social. The  project has  a strong  pro-poor focus  as the major  project \nbeneficiaries are the most vulnerable groups in Tajikistan. The project will also help the rural \npoor affected by COVID-19. In the past, migrants often went abroad without proper registration \nin the social welfare system in Tajikistan and this has prevented returning migrants from receiving \npublic support from the government.  Pre-departure orientation will register migrants  prior to \ndeparture,  to  help  minimize  the  risks  and  maximize  the  benefits  of  labor  migration.  The \nconstruction  of  the  MSCs  and  Job  Centers  might  create  about  7,200  person-months  of \nemployment.  The  project  prepared  a  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  that  includes \nmeasures to manage social impacts and enhance the distribution of project benefits. \n \n33.  Gender. The project is classified as gender equity theme as it directly tackles inequality \nof opportunity for women in access to training. Significant incentives, including childcare services \nand stipends will be provided, to help girls and single mothers (particularly in non-traditional \noccupations),32 get better access to training. Surveys33 indicate that skills training in the energy \nsector is particularly recommended for women as the average wage of energy sector jobs is high \nand a gender wage gap in the energy sector is relatively small. The project will provide safe \naccommodation and transportation services to access Job Centers that will mostly benefit female \ntrainees.  The  introduction  of  ISCO-08  defining  housekeepers  and  childcare  takers  as \n\u201coccupations\u201d will help the government and families, including women, recognize the economic \ncontribution of women to households from unpaid domestic work. Under the TVET project, the \ngender coordinators have been networked nationwide and those experts will play a key role in \nthe implementation of the project\u2019s gender action plan.   \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),34 the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n35.  Environment (category B). MOLME prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government  environmental \nregulations.  The  project will  result  in site-specific  environmental  impacts mainly  during  the \nconstruction phase, related to noise, dust, occupational and community health and safety. These \ncan  be  readily  mitigated  through  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan \nprepared as part of the IEE study. The IEE study was disclosed on the ADB website on 18 March \n2020.  MOLME  and  ADB  agreed  to  closely  monitor  environmental  impacts  during  project \nimplementation and PAG will submit the monitoring reports regularly.  \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A social due diligence report was developed for \nall six civil works sites. The draft social safeguards impact assessment identified that five out of \nsix sites proposed for MSCs and Job Centers will be located on unoccupied government land \n \n32 Al Jazeera English. \u201cTajikistan\u2019s missing men\u201d.

A draft land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) \nwas developed and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. PAG, with support from its consultants, will \nupdate the LARP, following detailed design and will monitor and report on its implementation. \nFull LARP implementation is a condition for handing over of the site for civil works. \n \n37.
