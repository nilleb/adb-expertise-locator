The  report \nalso  describes  the  proposed  administration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for \nInformation  and  Communication  Technology  (JFICT)  for  the  project  and  if the  Board  approves \nthe  proposed  grant,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration  of  the  grant.  The  project  aims  to  promote  inclusive  growth  in  Tajikistan  by \nimproving  the  vocational,  technical  and  soft  skills  and  employability  of  youth  (ages  15\u201329), \nwomen,  and  labor  migrants.  It  will  support  (i)  the  construction  of  migration  service  centers \n(MSCs) to provide more comprehensive  services to labor migrants; (ii) the construction of model \n\u2018Job Centers\u2019 that will provide market-responsive  training and employment services for youth and \nwomen; and (iii) the capacity development  of migration and employment  agencies. \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nEconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction.  Following  the  end  of the  civil  war  in \n1997,  political  stability  and  foreign  aid led  to  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  at 7.0% \nbeing among the highest in the Central Asia region during 2000\u20132017.1  Nominal GDP per capita \nfluctuated  at about $800 during 2016\u22122018. Recent changes, including  re-opening borders  with \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Uzbekistan,  and  increasing  trade  with  Afghanistan,  have \nopened  a  window  of  opportunity  to  enhance  regional  integration  and  provide  Tajikistan  with \naccess  to  wider  markets.2  Economic  growth  has,  however,  not  been  inclusive  or  sustainable. \nBoth  household  incomes  and  socio-economic  conditions  of  the  poorest  quantile  show  that  the \nfruits  of  recent  growth  have  not  been  widely  shared  among  the  people  of  Tajikistan. 3  The \nreduction  in poverty in the country  that has taken place can be largely attributed  to the catch-up \ngrowth  during  2000\u20132010,  while  subsequent  growth  has  had  only  a  small  impact  on  poverty. \nBetween  2015  and  2018,  the  Tajik  economy  expanded  by  more  than  20.0%  in  real  terms,  but \nthe  poverty  headcount  ratio  fell  by  less  than  two  percentage  points.4 Tajikistan  is  still  highly \nremittance dependent  and a low-income country, ranking 148th in terms of GDP per capita5 and \n125th  on  the  United  Nations'  Human  Development  Index. 6  There  is  substantial  variation  in \npoverty  across  the  regions.  In  2018,  the  poverty  rate  was 37.8%  in the  Districts  of  Republican \nSubordination7  and 37.7% in the Khatlon Region, versus 19.9% in Dushanbe  City.8 The poverty \nand  social  conditions  have  significantly  worsened  in Tajikistan  due  to  the  coronavirus  disease \n(COVID-19) crisis. The project is highly relevant to the current needs of Tajik labors and will help \nthe fragile economy in rural Tajikistan  to recover after the pandemic has subsided.  \n \n\n \n\n1  World  Bank.  2019.

Dushanbe.   \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  COVID-19 \n\nimpact  in  Tajikistan.  The  World  Health  Organization  declared  \n3. \nCOVID-19  a  global  pandemic  on  11  March  2020.  To  prevent  the  spread  of  the  virus,  the \nGovernment  of Tajikistan (the government)  imposed strict border controls on 28 February 2020, \nprohibiting  entry  of  individuals  from  high-risk  countries.  The  government  announced  the  first \ncases of COVID-19 on 30 April 2020. The pandemic has affected both domestic and destination \nlabor  markets  for  migrants  from  Tajikistan.  As  a  result  of  the  pandemic,  real  GDP  growth  is \npredicted  to  be  only  1.0%  in  2020. 9  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  estimates  that \nremittances  to Tajikistan  will  be reduced by at least  35% for 2020,  due to the combined  effects \nof the global COVID-19 pandemic and lower oil prices. The project will help unemployed workers \nand returning migrants to acquire skills and find jobs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n \n4. \nLabor  market  constraints.  Tajikistan\u2019s  labor  market  faces  several  legacy  challenges \nincluding: (i) lagging industrial transformation;  (ii) low labor productivity  and labor mismatch;  and \n(iii)  limited  job  opportunities.  While  agriculture  accounts  for  only  25.5%  of  GDP,  the  sector \nprovides  57.7%  of  jobs,  most  of  which  are  unpaid  and  seasonal.  In  the  2019  Global \nCompetitiveness Index, Tajikistan was ranked 104th out of 141 countries.10 Low competitiveness \nis partly due to limited access to information and communications  technology (ICT). In 2017, only \n28.2%  of  the  population  used  the  internet  and  70.5%  used  a  mobile  phone.  According  to  the \n2018 Labor Force Survey, 50.2% of employed adults performed  work that did not correspond  to \ntheir level of acquired  skills, indicating  a major mismatch  in the labor market. Real GDP grew by \nmore than 7.0% per year during 2003\u20132018,  but employment  expanded  by only 2.1% annually. \nMany  young  workers  continue  to  enter  the  labor  market  each  year  given  that  55.0%  of  the \npopulation is younger than 25 years of age. Tajikistan\u2019s economy could benefit from these young \nworkers if they were well trained, and jobs were available.    \n \n5. \nYouth  and  women  marginalized.  Youth  and  women  are  among  the  disadvantaged  in \nTajikistan,  particularly  those  in  rural areas  where  job  opportunities,  average  wages,  and social \nservices are limited. As indicated in the National Development  Strategy (NDS) 2030,11 the major \ndeterminant  of poverty  in Tajikistan  is lack  of access  to productive  employment.  Youth  tend  to \nface barriers to finding jobs as they lack the skills and experience required by employers. To help \nyouth find productive  employment,  the government  and  development  partners  have invested  in \nformal technical and vocational  education and training (TVET), which is typically longer than one \nyear. However,  the youth unemployment  rate in 2019 remained high at 21%12 and about 30% of \nyouth  were not  in education,  employment  or  training  (NEET).13 Some  unemployed  youth leave \nthe country in search of jobs, while other out-of-school youth remain in the country, but are unable \nto access affordable skills training, and become unemployed  or under-employed  in the domestic \nlabor  market.  Labor  market  opportunities  for  women  are  even  more  limited.  The  female  labor \nforce  participation  rate  was only  32.6%  in  2016.  Female  youth  have  always  maintained  higher \nNEET rates than male youth, and it reached  about 52% in 2013. Poor families  do not send their \ndaughters  for training  because of financial  and cultural constraints.  There are compelling  needs \nthat justify promoting youth and female skills development.14   \n \n\n \n\n9   International  Monetary Fund.  2020.  World Economy Outlook 2020.

Washington,  D.C. \n\n\fLimited  support  for  labor  migrants  and  returning  migrants.  About  500,000  Tajik \n6. \ncitizens  migrate each  year, mostly  to the Russian  Federation.  Remittances  from  labor migrants \nare equivalent  to about a third  of the country\u2019s  GDP. The largest group  of migrants  (45.4%)  are \nyouth  aged  15\u201329,  and more  than  85.0%  of migrants  are from  poor  rural areas. Tajik  migrants \nmainly find low-paying  and temporary  jobs in destination  countries, typically  in construction  and \ntransport. Currently, there are only four pre-departure  migration centers operating in the country, \nbut no post-return  services are available.  Budget limitations  and a lack of technical experts  who \ncan  deal  with  the  multi-dimensional  challenges  faced  by  labor  migrants  have  limited  the \navailability of pre-departure services. The lack of pre-departure orientation has led most migrants \nto  leave  the  country  without  fundamental  knowledge  about  migration,  exposing  them  to \nexploitation  and  abuse.15 Migrants  tend  to  have  limited  financial  and  ICT  knowledge,  both  of \nwhich  are important  for safe  remittance  and increased  access  to information  on labor  security. \nLong-term migration often results in family separation and increases the number of single-parent \nfamilies in poverty. The psycho-social  problems  faced by migrants  have not been addressed  by \nthe existing pre-departure  migration centers.   \n \nThe  economic  recession  and  legislative  changes  in  migrant  policies  in  the  Russian \n7. \nFederation  have resulted in 263,000  Tajik migrant workers being banned  from the country as of \n2019.16 The COVID-19 pandemic  in the Russian  Federation  and other destination  countries  will \ndrastically  increase  the  number  of  migrants  returning  to  Tajikistan. 17  The  2018  migration \nhousehold survey showed that about 50% of returning migrants were not able to find employment \nupon  their  return. 18  Youth  migrants  who  have  been  banned  from  returning  to  the  Russian \nFederation  and who cannot find domestic  employment  are one of the most vulnerable  groups in \nTajikistan.  It  is  therefore  important  to  (i)  help  returning  migrants  use  the  advanced  vocational \nskills  they  acquired  through  their  employment  in  more  developed  countries;  and  (ii)  provide \ninformation  and support  on how to reintegrate  into society either by finding a job or by starting a \nbusiness. \n \nInequitable  access  to  and  low  relevance  of  public  employment  services.  In  2017, \n8. \nTajikistan\u2019s Public Employment Services registered only about 20% of all unemployed. Most did not \nregister with the service agency for various reasons, including a lack of awareness or perception of \npoor services provided and the unattractive nature of jobs offered. There is only limited labor market \ninformation, job counselling and job matching support for job seekers. The lack of computer-based \njob  matching  services  and  trained  job  counsellors  result  in  long  periods  of  job  searches, \nparticularly for young workers who lack work experience. Females with children have even more \nrestricted  access  to  skills  training  because  external  child-care  services  are  not  available  in \nculturally conventional  rural areas.   \n \n \n9. \nMany TVET schools do not offer accommodation or transportation services. The Ministry of \nLabour,  Migration and  Employment  (MOLME)  is  responsible for  initial  vocational education  and \ntraining (IVET) schools, which offer full-time vocational education at secondary education level, but \nit  is underfunded. In  2018,  15.90%  of total  government expenditure went  to  education, but  only \n\n15 Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  Research  Institute.  2019.

International \n\nJournal of Work Organisation  and  Emotion.9(1)  pp.63-68.  Geneva. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n0.26% went to IVET. MOLME also operates 35 adult learning centers (ALCs) where the principal \ntarget groups  are  vulnerable youth and  women.  However,  these are  in  dilapidated facilities and \ntraining  programs  offered  in  these  ALCs  have  outdated  curricula  that  do  not  focus  on  the \ncompetencies  required  for the  most  in-demand  occupations.  Research  indicates  that soft skills \nare  crucial  for  improving  employability  and  different  soft  skills  are  needed  for  different \noccupations  and  job  levels.  However,  the  value  of  soft  skills  in  the  workplace  is  not  fully \nrecognized in Tajikistan and no structured  soft skills training programs  exist. While ICT skills are \nimperative for many modern occupations,  the quality of ICT training in this area is poor because \nof the  lack of  qualified  ICT  teachers  who  can easily  find  better  paying  ICT-related  jobs  outside \nALCs. ALCs are tasked with certifying the undocumented skills of returning migrants, but the lack \nof  established  assessment  methods  means  that  ALC  certificates  have  little  effect  on \nemployability.   \n \n10.  Weak planning and management  capacity for migration and employment  services. \nTajikistan  lacks  an  internationally  standardized  job  classification  system  and  labor  market \ndatabase  in  which  labor  data  is  collected  and  published  at  regular  intervals,  using  the  same \nmethods  and codes. Tajikistan uses the National Classification of Occupations (NCO) based on \nthe International Standard  Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO-88),  which is outdated and \nunsuitable  for  classifying  existing  occupations.  In  2008,  the  International  Labour  Organization \n(ILO)  released  the  International  Standard  Classification  of  Occupations  2008  (ISCO-08)  which \nmany  countries  have  now  adopted  to  build  their  policy  planning  and  administration  for  human \nresource  development. 19  As  a  result, \nits  \nISCO-88-based  NCO  no longer  match  the occupation  classifications  in overseas  labor  markets \nwhere the jobs are classified based on ISCO-08. Tajik engineers and teachers can often only low-\npaid, unskilled jobs in destination countries, partly because their qualifications are not recognized. \n \n11. \nThe limited availability of reliable labor data makes it difficult to monitor and detect distortions \nin the labor market, make knowledge-based decisions regarding needed interventions, and design \nand deliver training programs that are responsive to the labor market. As such, MOLME has faced \ndifficulty in planning skills training for major industries. For instance, the government has identified \ntourism as a priority sector with high job creation potential, but labor information on  the sector is \nscarce.  The  tourism  satellite  account  for  government  data  has  not  been  established 20 and  the \nrequired occupations, number of workers, and skill levels are not available. IVET schools and ALCs \nseldom  conduct  tracer  surveys  of  graduates  because  they  lack  tracking  mechanisms  and \nresources, making it difficult to examine the benefits and effectiveness of training programs. Low \npublic awareness  of migration and employment  services results  in limited  utilization of the labor \nmarket portal under MOLME. About 60.0% of job seekers in Tajikistan found employment through \nfriends and relatives, while only 5.8% found jobs using the portal.  \n \nNational  Development  Strategy  2030.  The  NDS  has  three  strategic  objectives:  \n12. \n(i)  reduction  of  vulnerability  in  future  development;  (ii)  more  efficient  use  of  natural  resources; \nand  (iii)  innovation  through  the  integration  of  new  development  into  the  country\u2019s  social  and \neconomic  mainstreams.  To  achieve  its  objectives,  the  NDS  acknowledges  the  importance  of \nexpansion of productive employment and proposes the following actions to improve employment \noutcomes:  (i) develop  the network  for professional  skills development  considering  the needs  of \nwomen,  youth  and  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population;  (ii)  diversify  foreign  labor  migration \n\nthe  qualifications  of  Tajik  migrants  under \n\n \n\n19  K.G.

Tajikistan\u2019s first skills development project, \nthe  Strengthening  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  Project,  was  approved  by \nADB  in  2015. 21  It  supports  initial  and  secondary  TVET  by  introducing    competency-based \ntraining,  training  vocational  teachers,  upgrading  facilities  and equipment  of vocational  lyceums \nand colleges, and conducting a market responsive and inclusive training survey. Lessons learned \nfrom the TVET project include: (i) there is a significant need for quality short-term training for out-\nof-school  youth;  (ii)  improvement  is  needed  in  employability  as  well  as  skills;  (iii)  labor  market \ndata  collection  and  job  classification  systems  should  be  strengthened;  and  (iv)  more  targeted \nsupport  should  be  provided  to  address  the  demand-  and  supply-side  constraints  for  girls  and \nwomen in the skills sector. \n \nAlignment  with the ADB country strategy  and Strategy  2030. The project  aligns with \n14. \nADB\u2019s country strategy for Tajikistan to develop  skills and continue to support education, TVET, \nand  employment. 22   It  supports \nthree  ADB  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities:  \n(i) addressing  remaining  poverty and reducing inequalities  by (a) promoting social inclusion  and \ndevelopment  by  providing  incentives  for  disadvantaged  youth  and women  to attend  job center \ntraining,  (b)  improving  education  and  training  through  improving  the  quality  and  relevance  of \ntraining  at  Job  Centers  and  MSCs,  and  (c)  by  ensuring  social  protection  for  those  in  need  by \nreducing  the  risks  associated  with  labor  migration;  (ii) accelerating  progress  in gender  equality \nby  encouraging  women\u2019s  capacity  development  and  knowledge  of  job  availability;  and  (iii) \nstrengthening  governance  and institutional  capacity by increasing  the capacity of migration  and \nemployment  service agencies.23  \n \nDevelopment  partners  coordination.

The design and monitoring  framework  is in Appendix  1. \n \n17. \nOutput  1: More  inclusive  and  targeted  migration  support  provided.  To  reduce  the \nrisks  of  migration  for youth  and  help  them  find  better  jobs,  the  project  will  establish  and  equip \nthree  new  MSCs  that  will  provide  (i)  a  new  pre-departure  orientation  program;  (ii)  a  new  pre-\nemployment program; (iii) a new ICT literacy program; (iv) a pilot for behavioral change initiatives \nfor migrants and migrant families; and (v) job counselling  services for returning migrant workers. \nThe new MSCs will be constructed in Khujand, Bokhtar and Vose, where a large number of youth \nmigrate  to  find  employment,  but  where  no  pre-departure  service  centers  are  available.25  The \nMSCs  will  offer  one-stop  service  centers  to departing  and  returning  migrants.  Migrants  will  be \nregistered  in  the  database  of  the  centers.  The  migration  orientation  program,  short  language \ntraining, and entry-level skills training will help migrants find better jobs and safer living conditions \nin  the  destination  countries.  The  centers  will  also  provide  financial  literacy  training  for  safe \nremittance  transmission  and  ICT  training  for  easier  access  to  social  welfare  information.  The \nproject  will  train  migration  counsellors  who  will  provide  pilot  family  counselling  for  improved \nfinancial  planning  and  reintegration.  Returning  migrants  will  also  be  assisted  in  finding \nemployment  and  information  on  entrepreneurship  and  available  micro-financing  in  case  they \nwish to start micro and small businesses  using their remittance savings.   \n \nOutput  2:  Access  to  and  relevance  of  public  employment  services  enhanced.  To \n18. \nprovide better service to youth and female jobs seekers, the project will establish and equip three \nnew  model  Job  Centers  that  will  provide  (i)  enhanced  comprehensive  employment  services, \nincluding skills training; (ii) childcare  centers and a pilot stipend program for female job seekers; \n(iii) a pilot program  of new  and more  focused  soft skills training;  (iv) job  counselling  services  to \nmatch  interests  and  skills  to  potential  jobs;  and  (v)  ICT  skills  training  programs  for  selected \nsectors.  Job  Centers  with  dormitories  will  be  built  and  equipped  in  Dushanbe  for  tourism,  in \nRogun  for energy,  and in  Dangara  for agriculture.  The  sites for  the Job  Centers  were  selected \nbased  on an assessment  of the potential  for local  labor market  needs. Job Centers  will provide \nskills training  for selected  occupations  in the  three above-mentioned  targeted  sectors  identified \nthrough consultations  with line ministries and industrial associations. The new training programs \nwill  be  designed  for  a  shorter  period  than  conventional  training  for disadvantaged  groups  who \ncannot afford the cost or time for full-time TVET programs.  Training programs  will be developed \nbased on the competency-based  training approach and training materials that were piloted under \nthe  TVET  project  where  private  sector  will  participate  in  the  training  verification  process.  To \nencourage women to participate in training, free childcare services and stipends will be provided \nto female trainees. The project will pilot a new soft skills training targeting conscientiousness  and \nagreeableness. 26   Job  counselling  will  be  provided  using  updated  ICT  equipment  and  new \naptitude testing software.   \n \nOutput  3:    Planning  and  management  of  migration  and  employment  services \n19. \nstrengthened.  To  provide  better  service  to  youth  and  female  job  seekers  and  migrant  youth \nworkers the project will (i) develop the new NCO based on ISCO-08 and help apply the NCO  to \nthe training  certifications  and  labor market  surveys;  (ii) pilot a skills and  employment  survey  for \nthe  tourism  sector;  (iii) expand  the labor  market  portal  under  MOLME  and undertake  client  job \ncenter tracking surveys; (iv) provide training for MOLME and migration and employment  agency \n\n \n\n24 For this  project,  youth is defined  as the  labor force population  aged  15\u201329.  The Labor  Force Surveys of Tajikistan \n\nprovide statistics  for the 15\u201319,  20\u201324,  and 25\u201329  age categories.    \n\n25 The Dushanbe  Job Center will serve as the 4th Migration  Service Center. \n26 D.

The  NCO  based  on  ISCO-08  will  help  improve  the \nrecognition  of skills  qualifications  of Tajik job seekers  in the regional  labor  market.  The tourism \nsurvey will estimate the employment size for occupations, needs for further development of skills, \nand areas  of employment  growth  in the  sector. Experience  during  this pilot will enable  MOLME \nto  undertake  similar  surveys  for  other  sectors.  The  project  will  improve  the  coverage  and  data \naccuracy of the existing labor market portal. A large-scale tracer study of the beneficiaries of Job \nCenters  will  assess  the  project  impact.  An  awareness  campaign  will  be  organized  to  promote \nMOLME\u2019s migration  and employment  services. Since training participants  will be certified by the \nState Institute ALC in Dushanbe,  the project will provide training to selected ALCs to strengthen \nthe certification capacity. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nThe  project  is  built  upon  the  lessons  learned  from  the  TVET  project,  and  ADB\u2019s  long \ninvolvement  in the skills development  sector. The design of the project  scope was based on the \nfindings  of  ADB-funded  knowledge  products.27 The  key  and  innovative  features  of  the  project \ninclude (i) a timely response to the COVID-19  with the anticipated synergy and complementarity \nwith other ADB-supported government projects on COVID-19 mitigation;28 (ii) the first large-scale \nemployment  project  in  Tajikistan  targeting  the  youth  outside  TVET  system;  (iii)  promoting  ICT, \nwhich  is one  of the  most  critical  competencies  needed  for  employment  in the  Industry  4.0  era; \nand  (iv)  directly  contributing  to human  capital  development  of  Tajikistan  that  will  help  promote \ninvestments  from private sector.   \n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $34.65  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \nexpenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  in  the  project  administration  manual  (PAM).29 The \ngovernment  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $30  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  project.

The major outputs of the grant are: (i) ICT skills and knowledge  improved; \n(ii)  ICT  equipment  provided;  and  (iii)  labor  market  database  and  systems  strengthened.  The \nJFICT  grant  will  partly  finance:  (i)  the  consultants  and  Job  Center  staff  who  will  develop  and \ndeliver  ICT  training;  (ii) provision  of  ICT equipment  to  the  labor  market  portal  and  software  for \njob counselling;  and (iii) the consultants and PAG staff who will provide capacity development  of \npublic migration and employment  services.  \n \nGrant  activities  are  estimated  to  cost  $1.65  million.  This  excludes  the  cost  of \n25. \nadministrative  budget  support  and will  be financed  by  a grant from  JFICT  of $1.5  million  and a \ncounterpart  contribution of $0.15 million. The government will provide counterpart support  in the \nform  of  tax  exemptions  and  other  in-kind  contributions  for  the  grant.  The  grant  will  be \nadministered  by ADB  and implemented  with  MOLME as the  executing  agency and the  PAG as \nthe implementing  agency.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic  and Financial  Viability \n\n \nA. \n \nEconomic  analysis.30  The project will strengthen the capacity and skills of migrant and \n26. \ndomestic workers  to improve their employability  and wages. This is especially  important now as \nTajikistan  is  expected  to  see  an  increase  in  unemployment  and  loss  of  jobs  due  to  the  \nCOVID-19  pandemic.  The  project  will  help  to  re-skill  affected  workers  and  cushion  Tajikistan \nfrom the detrimental  effects of COVID-19 on human capital. The MSCs will serve an incremental \nnumber of about 9,328 migrant workers annually or about 191,228 migrant workers during 2024\u2013\n2044, who are projected  to generate  about $4.38 billion  in incremental  remittances.  The project \nwill  also  increase  the  number  of  Job  Center  graduates who are  expected  to  realize  an  annual \nwage  that will be 10.0%  higher  than the minimum  wage  in the targeted  sectors.  The \u201cwith\u201d  and \n\n30 The economic analysis  followed ADB guidelines,  i.e.,  ADB. 2017. Guidelines  for the Economic Analysis of Projects \n\n(as amended  from time to time).  Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nSustainability \n\n\u201cwithout\u201d  training  employment  rates 31  are  assumed  at  55.0%  and  40.0%,  respectively.  The \nproject  will  produce  an  additional  36,506  Job  Center  graduates,  of  whom  22,425  will  find \nemployment  and generate about $369 million in income earnings during 2024\u20132044. The project \nis expected to  realize an economic internal rate of  return (EIRR) of 11.5%, at  a discount rate of \n9.0% and  will generate a net present  value of $12.8 million over  the life of the project. It is  also \nassessed to be resilient to changes as the EIRR remains at economically viable levels even with \nsignificant changes in project costs, the number of migrant workers availing of migration services, \nand the number of Job Center  graduates.  \n \n27. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  fiscal  impact  and  sustainability  analysis  on  the  government\u2019s \nability to provide counterpart funds, recurrent and maintenance costs was undertaken.  The costs \nof  tax  exemptions  and  social  taxes  are  less  than  0.1%  of  the  government\u2019s  total  annual \nexpenditure.  The  additional  recurrent  and  investment  costs  to  operate  the  Job  Centers  and \nMSCs  beyond  the  project  implementation  period  will  be  low  (a  maximum  of  0.06%  of  total \ngovernment  expenditure  in  fiscal  year  2033).  The  analysis  confirms  that  this  is  a  fiscally \nsustainable  investment. \n \nB. \n \n28. \n Economic  sustainability.  The government  is committed  to  implementing  an effective, \ncontinuing  program to improve the quality and delivery of TVET to allow more skilled laborers to \nparticipate  in domestic and foreign labor markets. A relevant and market-oriented  TVET system \nwill,  in  turn,  increase  skilled  workers\u2019  income-generating  capacity  and  encourage  migrant \nworkers  to  continue  and  increase  remittances  to  their  families  in  Tajikistan.  The  economic \nbenefits  generated will ensure  the project\u2019s long-term  sustainability  and contribute  to sustaining \nthe country\u2019s economic  growth and current development  trends. \n \n29. \nContinuation  of  the  project  centers  after  project  completion.  The  government  has \ncommitted  to continue to operate and maintain the Job Centers and MSCs that were developed \nunder  the  project  after  project  completion.  This  is confirmed  as  part  of  the  project  assurances \nand covenants.   \n \nC. \n \n30. \nFinancial  management  and  procurement.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement  risk  is  substantial  mainly  due  to  weaknesses  in  the  current  accounting  manual, \nannual  budgeting,  internal  auditing  and  controls  over  the  accounting  software.  Measures  to \nmitigate  the  risks  include  strengthening  the  accounting  manual,  earlier  submission  of  annual \nbudgets,  including  the project in the annual  plan of the MOLME Internal  Audit Department,  and \nimproving  accounting  software  controls.  Agency  and  project  procurement  risk  assessments \nconcluded that the procurement  risk rating is low for PAG. The procurement  capacity of the PAG \nin  the  ongoing  TVET  project  is  assessed  to  be  high  and  the  key  TVET  project  PAG  staff  will \ncontinue  to  implement  the  project.  Measures  to mitigate  risks include:  (i) all parties  involved  in \nprocurement  must sign a statement  of ethics and a declaration  of no potential conflict of interest \nin  any  procurement  activity;  and  (ii)  a  standard  statement  of  ethics  will  be  included  as  a \nrequirement  in  bid  documents.  The  procurement  plan  will be  updated  regularly,  and  proposed \nchanges  will require  ADB approval.  ADB  will handle  for oversight  and monitoring,  including  the \ninitial procurement  plan and any subsequent  changes. \n\nGovernance \n\n31 Employment  rates  are  defined  as  the  percentage  of Job  Center  beneficiaries  who  find  a  job  within  one  year  of \n\n \n\nfinishing  the training.   \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social,  and Gender \n\n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption  Policy. ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy (1998, as amended  to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOLME.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements  and supplementary  measures  are described  in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n32. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  project  has  a  strong  pro-poor  focus  as  the  major  project \nbeneficiaries  are  the  most  vulnerable  groups  in  Tajikistan.  The  project  will  also  help  the  rural \npoor affected  by COVID-19.  In the past, migrants  often went  abroad without  proper  registration \nin the social welfare system in Tajikistan and this has prevented returning migrants from receiving \npublic  support  from  the  government.  Pre-departure  orientation  will  register  migrants  prior  to \ndeparture,  to  help  minimize  the  risks  and  maximize  the  benefits  of  labor  migration.  The \nconstruction  of  the  MSCs  and  Job  Centers  might  create  about  7,200  person-months  of \nemployment.  The  project  prepared  a  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  that  includes \nmeasures  to manage social impacts and enhance  the distribution  of project benefits. \n \n33. \nGender.  The project is classified  as gender  equity theme as it directly tackles  inequality \nof opportunity for women in access to training. Significant incentives, including childcare services \nand  stipends  will  be  provided,  to  help  girls  and  single  mothers  (particularly  in  non-traditional \noccupations),32  get better access  to training.  Surveys33 indicate  that skills training  in the energy \nsector is particularly recommended for women as the average wage of energy sector jobs is high \nand  a  gender  wage  gap  in  the  energy  sector  is  relatively  small.  The  project  will  provide  safe \naccommodation and transportation services to access Job Centers that will mostly benefit female \ntrainees.  The  introduction  of  ISCO-08  defining  housekeepers  and  childcare  takers  as \n\u201coccupations\u201d  will help the government  and families,  including  women,  recognize  the economic \ncontribution  of women  to households  from  unpaid  domestic  work.  Under the  TVET  project,  the \ngender  coordinators  have  been networked  nationwide  and  those  experts  will play  a key role  in \nthe implementation  of the project\u2019s gender action plan.   \n \nE. \n \n34. \ncategories  are as follows. \n \n35. \nEnvironment (category B). MOLME prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  government  environmental \nregulations.  The  project  will  result  in  site-specific  environmental  impacts  mainly  during  the \nconstruction phase, related to noise, dust, occupational and community health and safety. These \ncan  be  readily  mitigated  through  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan \nprepared as part of the IEE study. The IEE study was disclosed on the ADB website on 18 March \n2020.  MOLME  and  ADB  agreed  to  closely  monitor  environmental  impacts  during  project \nimplementation  and PAG will submit the monitoring  reports regularly.  \n \nInvoluntary resettlement  (category B).
