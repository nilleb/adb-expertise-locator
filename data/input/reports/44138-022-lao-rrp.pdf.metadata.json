The  project  will  target  areas  of  good  agricultural  potential  with \nexisting  irrigation  schemes.  It  aims  to  regenerate,  replace,  and  upgrade  underdeveloped  or \noutdated agriculture infrastructure, including irrigation and rural access infrastructure.4 This will \nenhance agriculture productivity (and incomes) in some of the country\u2019s poorest districts. It will \nsupport  capacity  development,  at  the  farm  level,  to  manage  and  use  the  agriculture \ninfrastructure  efficiently  and  effectively  to  optimize  agricultural  outputs.  It  will  stimulate  rural \ndevelopment, sustainable agriculture practices, and trade.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nInvestments in EWEC\u2019s physical infrastructure, supported by  Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  financed  projects,  are  creating  opportunities  for  trade  and  economic \ndevelopment.5 The GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program focuses on connectivity, \ncompetitiveness,  and  community\u2014both  local  and  community  of  nations.  In  preparation for  the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  Economic  Community  in  2015,  the  Ayeyawady\u2013Chao \nPhraya\u2013Mekong  Economic  Cooperation  Strategy  has  prioritized  cooperation in rice  production \nand  food  security,  underpinned  by  improved  infrastructure.6  At  the  Ayeyawady\u2013Chao  Phraya\u2013\nMekong  Economic  Cooperation  Strategy  summit  in  March  2013,  the  Lao  PDR  and  Thailand \nagreed to reduce  import\u2013export  tariffs for  agriculture-related  inputs  and  produce,  and facilitate \ntrade and contract farming for the Lao PDR.7 The Project will contribute to these GMS initiatives \nby  improving  access  for  all  people  in  the  project  areas  to  EWEC  markets  and  economic \nopportunities, including those of neighboring countries.

Manila; and ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Implementing the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Core Agriculture Support Project (Phase 2). Manila. \n\n6   Members of the Ayeyawady\u2013Chao Phraya\u2013Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy are Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \n\nMyanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. ADB is providing assistance to the strategy. \n\n7   A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Lao PDR and Thai Prime Ministers on 15 March 2013. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nproject areas will be increased by enabling participating communities to respond to market pull \nfrom  the  EWEC  by  (i)  increasing  the  intensity  and  diversity  of  agricultural  production;  (ii) \nproviding quicker and safer access to markets, social services, and employment opportunities; \nand (iii) reducing the costs of agricultural inputs, marketing, and post-harvest losses. \n \n4. \nThe  Lao  PDR  has  had  an  annual  rice  deficit,  estimated  at  100,000 t  in  2012. \nReducing this deficit is a national priority and upgrading agriculture infrastructure will provide the \nfoundation for doing so. Improved irrigation will enable increased yields in the rainy season as a \nresult  of  supplementary  irrigation  and  an  expansion  of  dry  season  cultivation.8  Irrigation \nimprovements  will  also  help  overcome  long  dry  season  droughts  and  overall  foster  climate \nchange adaptation. Irrigation integrated with rural access improvements will lead to increases in \nincome  from  both  on-  and  off-farm  employment;  expand  income  generation  opportunities, \nespecially  for  women;  improve  access  to  markets,  schools,  and  hospitals;  and  increase  food \navailability.  Associated  capacity  building  measures  will  focus  on  water  users  groups  (WUGs) \nand/or water users associations (WUAs) that are already established, with varying capacities, in \nmost of the functioning irrigation schemes.9 They are responsible for operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of the existing irrigation schemes, and often are doing well keeping old, poorly designed \nand constructed schemes functioning. The project will assist WUGs and WUAs to manage the \nimproved infrastructure and use it to realize market-based optimal agricultural production.   \n \nThe  provinces  of  Savannakhet  and  Saravane  account  for  33%  of  the  total  rice \n5. \nproduced in the Lao PDR (917,000 tons [t]).10 They have a combined population of 1,150,000 \nwith  an  average  poverty  rate  of  36%.  Savannakhet  has  the  highest  population  of  the  five \nsouthern provinces, and the highest number of poor districts.11 They have a combined reported \narea  of  about  312,300  hectares  (ha)  under  cultivation,  but  less  than  10%  of  this  area  has \nirrigated dry season production. Crop yields are below potential, and farming generally remains \nat  semi-subsistence  levels  with  little  diversification.12  Currently,  poor  quality  and  inadequate \ncoverage of irrigation constrains agriculture production\u2014especially in the dry season\u2014resulting \nin limited areas being planted and low yields, a limited variety of produce, with high production, \ntransport, and marketing costs, and hence lower farm incomes.  \n \n6. \nThe project is consistent with the government\u2019s sector development objectives as \npresented in its Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015, Strategy for \nAgricultural  Development  2020,  and  Agricultural  Master  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  which  promote  the \nexpansion of market-oriented agricultural production in an environmentally sensitive manner. It \nwill be a key component in the government\u2019s new Southern Rural Development Program.13 The \nproject is in line with ADB\u2019s GMS  Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program, supporting the \nthrust to strengthen infrastructure and agriculture, as well as the priority to develop the EWEC. \nProject objectives are consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for  the Lao PDR and \nits  focus  on  agriculture  infrastructure  as  a  means  of  promoting  pro-poor,  sustainable  growth \n\n                                                \n8 Supplementary irrigation reduces crop stress during dry periods of the rainy season. \n9   WUGs are informal groupings of farmers within an irrigation scheme. WUAs are associations with legal standing \nand  status  that  can  enter  into  contracts  and  undertake  commercial  activities.  One  of  the  institutional  challenges \nwithin the project area is to convert WUGs to WUAs and to improve the functioning of existing WUAs. \n\n10  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Food Programme. 2011.

Other  lessons  include  the  need  to  (i)  prescreen \nsubprojects  to  identify  viable  ones  with  minimal  safeguard  issues;  (ii)  limit  the  geographic \ncoverage  to  obtain  a  balance  between  capital  investments  and  overhead  costs,  and  contain \nimplementation weaknesses to a manageable level; (iii) maintain a confined scope of activities \nto  those  that  can  be  readily  carried  out  within  local  capacities;  (iv)  carefully  prepare  the \nprocurement plan to optimize the contract size, number, and methodology; and (v) take advance \nactions  to  ensure  competent  project  staff  are  trained,  and  accelerate  procurement  and \nconsultant recruitment. \n \n8. \nIn  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  (MAF)  and  participating \nprovinces,  27  candidate  subprojects  from  the  Provincial  Socio-Economic  Development  Plans \nwere screened for inclusion and were found to meet preliminary technical, financial, economic, \nenvironment,  and  social  eligibility  criteria.19  Subproject  feasibility  studies  were  carried  out  on \nthree  representative  subprojects,  with  positive  results,  indicating  substantial  increases  in  farm \nincomes from higher production and increased employment.20 The remaining subprojects have \nbeen  prioritized  and  will  be  subject  to  full  feasibility  studies  during  implementation.  Available \nfunding suggests that 25 subprojects will be implemented using ADB loan proceeds.  \n \n\n                                                \n14  ADB. 2012.

The  Lao  PDR  has  its  Strategy  for  Agricultural  Development  to  2020  to  meet  the  priority \ndevelopment  needs  of  the  sector.  It  has  the  institutional  capacity  to  implement  this  sector  development  plan, \nfollowing experience in five previous sector development projects financed  by ADB. The policies applicable to the \nagriculture sector are appropriate and will be improved through the proposed project, in particular those relating to \nO&M of agriculture infrastructure by WUGs and WUAs.  \n\n20 The subprojects were Beungxe and Phanomxy in Savannakhet and Vapy Neau in Saravane.   \n\n   3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe  project  has  two  technical  innovations  that  highlight  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  to \n9. \nthe sector by contributing to the ongoing sector policy dialogue on water resource management \nand  irrigation  sustainability:  (i)  an  8-year  project  duration  in  light  of  sector  implementation \nconstraints  to  enable  intensive  and  extensive  WUG  and  WUA  capacity  development  after \ncompletion  of  civil  works,  and  (ii)  integration  of  soil  and  water  conservation  measures through \nbioengineering techniques into agriculture infrastructure design. This will improve the stability of \nthe  infrastructure,  and  soil  quality,  as  many  soils  in  the  project  area  are  depleted  of  nutrients \nand are easily erodible. An implementation innovation is the provision of start-up consultants to \nsupport  project  implementation  activities  while  the  loan  implementation  consultants  are \nrecruited, thus avoiding implementation delays. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  expected  impact  of the  project  will  be  increased  household incomes  in  the  project \n\n10. \nareas. The expected outcome will be increased agricultural productivity in the project areas.  \n\nThe project will have three outputs: (i) improved agriculture infrastructure, with activities \n11. \ncarried  out  by  implementing  subprojects,  including  (a)  civil  works  to  improve  irrigation \ninfrastructure  in 25  schemes,  (b)  constructing  low  volume  rural  roads  that  support the mobility \nand transport needs of the population in and around the irrigation schemes, and (c) generating \nemployment during civil works that benefits local people including women and ethnic groups; (ii) \nincreased  capacity  of  farmers  to  manage  and  use  agriculture  infrastructure  efficiently,  with \nactivities in all subprojects including (a) establishing and implementing agriculture infrastructure \nmanagement and operation plans, (b) preparing and implementing WUG and WUA agricultural \ndevelopment plans, and (c) strengthening WUGs to graduate to WUAs; and (iii) efficient project \nmanagement  by  meeting \nfor  successfully  (a) operating  a  national  project \nmanagement  office  (NPMO)  and  two  provincial  project  management  offices  (PPMOs);  (b) \nrecruiting  and  fielding  consultants  for  project  start-up,  implementation,  benefit,  and  safeguard \nmonitoring;  and  (c)  completing  subproject  feasibility  studies  and  construction  works.

MAF will be the executing agency with responsibility for overall \nproject coordination and management. MAF will establish an NPMO, which will be responsible \nfor  overall  coordination  and  project  delivery,  including  reporting  on  project  progress  to  the \nexecuting  agency  and  ADB,  and  technical  support  for  subproject  design  and  approval.  The \ntechnical support will include preparation of subproject investment reports and detailed designs, \nrecruitment of consultants, procurement of civil works, and subproject implementation, including \nconstruction supervision. The provincial governments of Savannakhet and Saravane will be the \nimplementation \nproject \ncoordination  in  each  province.  Each  provincial  government  will  delegate  responsibility  for \nprovincial  level  project  implementation  activities  to  the  respective  Provincial  Agriculture  and \nForestry  Office  (PAFO).  The  PAFOs  will  be  responsible  for  reporting  to  the  provincial  vice-\ngovernor and the NPMO. Each PAFO  will establish a PPMO. The PPMOs will provide day-to-\nday project support for implementation of the subprojects. They will facilitate input from relevant \nprovincial  line  departments  for  the  subproject  design  and  implementation.  The  PPMOs  will  be \nmanaged by a provincial project manager from the PAFO and one full-time deputy manager.  \n \n17. \nSubproject implementation support will be provided by the PPMO with the assistance of \nthe  district  coordination  office  (DCO),  which  will  ensure  that  during  subproject  preparation \nconsultation actions are carried out with provincial and district stakeholder agencies and village \nauthorities.  Meetings  will  be  arranged  with  male  and  female  farmers,  village  leaders,  poor \nhouseholds, WUGs, and private small-scale traders and buyers, to identify their constraints and \ncapacity and to understand irrigation and mobility and transport issues. During implementation, \nDCOs will ensure communication and awareness to enable participation and access to project \nbenefits,  including  capacity  building  and  training,  access  to  employment  opportunities,  and \ncommunity participation at village level in agriculture infrastructure planning and development.  \n \n18. \nCapacity building activities aimed at improved O&M and agriculture practices will begin \nduring  the  feasibility  study  period,  with  strong  input  from  the  PAFOs  and  DCOs.  Subprojects \nfound feasible will be prepared to detailed design level and, after bidding, constructed under the \nsupervision of the NPMO, the PPMO, and the DCO. Subprojects will be implemented in three \nphases:  (i)  implementation  of  the three  representative subprojects  prepared  during  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance,  (ii)  the  next  10  priority  subprojects,  and  (iii)  about \n12 subprojects subject to remaining funds. This is to ensure that sufficient funds will be available \nfor  the  top  priorities  in  case  of  cost  overruns.  Loan  implementation  consultants  will  carry  out \nsubproject \nloan \nimplementation consultants will assist the NPMO to ensure that appropriate technical standards \nare  incorporated  in  the  design,  the  costs  reflect  realistic  market  estimates,  and  the  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards requirements of ADB and the government are met.  \n\nfeasibility  studies  and  social  and  economic  safeguards  studies.  The \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe technology involved for most subprojects is straightforward and within the capacities \n19. \nof engineers and contractors available in the Lao PDR. Works will entail mainly upgrading and \nrepair  of  existing  structures  and  facilities.  The  irrigation  systems  to  be  upgraded  are  mainly \npumped irrigation schemes, but also include a few small to medium-sized reservoirs and run-of-\nriver  diversion  weirs.  For  the  pumped  schemes,  improvement  will  primarily  entail  the \nreplacement  of  worn  out  pumping  systems  and  the  improvement  and  repair  of  canals.  For \ngravity  systems, repair  or  replacement  of the  headworks  will  usually  be  necessary,  as  well  as \ncanal improvements. Access roads will be constructed of concrete to provide all-weather service \n\n \n\n\fand  reduced  maintenance  costs.  This  technology  is  labor-intensive  and  will  increase \nemployment  opportunities  during  construction.  It  is  also  appropriate  since  many  areas  flood \nduring  the  rainy  season  and  concrete  can  withstand  submergence  for  extended  periods.  The \nproject  will  strengthen  the WUGs  and WUAs  to ensure  that  upgraded  systems  continue to be \noperational  and  produce  profitable  crops.  Experience  under  completed  projects  indicates  that \nenhanced  operational  funding  and  guidance  from  specialized  consultants  can  significantly \nimprove  O&M  as  well  as  cropping  patterns.  Capacity  building  technical  assistance  for \nSupporting Decentralized Rural Infrastructure Development will also contribute to strengthening \nthe WUGs and WUAs.24 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nA number of direct and indirect benefits will accrue from the project. Some of the direct \n20. \nbenefits  are  improved  rice  and  vegetable  crop  yields  together  with  increased  cropping \nintensities, reduced transit time, off-season and off-farm employment opportunities (particularly \nfor women), access to markets and market information, strengthening and promotion of WUGs. \nThese  benefits  will  translate  into  an  overall  improvement  in  the  standard  of  living.  In  addition, \nincreased access to health care services, nutrition, and children\u2019s education are some indirect \nbenefits  that  will  accrue  from  the  project.  Investment  costs  associated  with  these  benefits \ninclude  agriculture \ninfrastructure,  extension  services,  capacity  building,  and  project \nmanagement.  The  distributional  analysis  confirms  significant  benefits  to  the  poor.  Analysis  of \nthe  representative  subprojects  indicates  that  the  productivity  of  both  wet  and  dry  season  rice \nand vegetable crops will improve significantly. Average rice yields are expected to increase from \n3.0 t/ha to 4.5 t/ha while annual cropping intensity is expected to increase from 140% to 180%. \nThis will significantly contribute to reducing the national annual deficit by approximately 38,000 t. \nThe estimated average annual income per household will increase from $1,375 to $3,030. The \nfinancial  analysis  indicates  that  the  O&M  costs  of  the  improved  assets  are  affordable.  The \nestimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  representative  subprojects  are  16%\u201324% \nbased on quantifiable benefits. The sensitivity analyses are attractive and robust as none of the \nrisk factors appear to place the investments in immediate jeopardy. These economic returns are \nused  as  a  proxy  to  assess  the  overall  economic  viability  of  the  project.25  Subprojects  with  an \neconomic internal rate of return above 12%, as indicated in feasibility studies, will be eligible for \nproject financing. \n \nC.  \n\nGovernance \n\n21. \nThe  main  governance  issues  are  expected  to  arise  during  procurement  and  with \nmanagement  of  the  project\u2019s  finances.  MAF  has  considerable  experience  in  procuring  civil \nworks  and  goods  and  services  under  ADB  projects.  All  procurement  and  recruitment  of \nconsultants to be financed by the loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). A financial management assessment indicates that MAF \nis capable of undertaking financial management of the project.26 MAF will ensure that the NPMO \nand  PPMOs  maintain  adequate  financial  records.  Consolidated  project  financial  statements \nshould  be  prepared  and  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  A \nnational financial management specialist has been included in the project as an individual loan \n\n                                                \n24  ADB.  2012.

The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nAnalysis of declines in poverty rates since 1998 show that the greatest gains have been \n23. \nmade where there  are  improved  links to markets,  with poverty  persisting  in more  remote rural \nareas without road access. Combined provincial average poverty rates are 36%, and 10%\u201320% \nin  the  representative  subprojects,  with  women  generally  poorer  than  men.  Agriculture \ncontributes  70%\u201390%  to  rural  household  incomes.  Investments  in  irrigation  rehabilitation  will \nimprove  the  incomes  and  food  security  of  households  and,  through  associated  investments, \nprovide  opportunities  for  women  and  men  to  access  relevant  capacity  building  activities.  The \ncivil  works  will  generate  at  least  $8  million  in  labor  wages  and  thereafter  households  in  the \nrepresentative  subprojects  are  predicted  to  gain  an  average  of  57\u201383  days  of  employment \nannually from increased farm labor demand.27 \n \n24. \nThe  impact  for  women  is  potentially  greater  than  for  men,  considering  the  significantly \ngreater  labor  inputs  they  provide  in  cropping,  water  collection,  and  marketing  of  agricultural \nproduce. The project\u2019s gender classification is effective gender mainstreaming (category 2). To \nensure that benefits accrue to women, a gender action plan has been prepared for the project.28 \nWomen, including women\u2019s groups and the Lao Women\u2019s Union, as well as PAFO and DAFO \nSubcommittee  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  members,  will  be  consulted  on  agriculture \ninfrastructure design. This will include separate meetings for women, held at appropriate times \nand using language and cultural sensitivity that allow women to participate. Contractors will be \nencouraged  to  employ  women  in  civil  works,  and  men  and  women  will  receive  equal  pay  for \nwork of equal type. Participation of women in WUGs will be promoted. To improve safety along \nroads  to  be  upgraded,  funds  have  been  provided  for  road  safety  information  campaigns.  In \naddition,  awareness  campaigns  on  HIV/AIDS  will  be  carried  out  in  the  subproject  areas.  The \nsafety  campaigns  and  systems  will  be  developed  to  ensure  the  needs  of  vulnerable  groups \n(including children and women) are addressed. \n  \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment  (category  B).  Subprojects  are  mainly  limited  to  the  rehabilitation  of \n25. \nexisting  infrastructure,  and  the  screening  process  has  eliminated  subprojects  with  potentially \nsignificant negative environmental impacts. This was confirmed during detailed analyses of the \nthree  representative  subprojects.  However,  some  minor  negative  environmental  effects  may \noccur  during  the  construction  process.  To  strengthen  MAF\u2019s  capacity,  additional  training  for \nNPMO  safeguard  staff  and  PPMOs  is  included  in  the  project  costs.  The  environmental \nassessment  and  review \nfor  environmental \nthe \nmanagement are included in the PAM to guide the government to carry out an appropriate level \nof  environmental  assessment  and  to  take  corresponding  measures  to  deal  with  potential \n                                                \n27 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nlist  of  responsibilities \n\nframework  and \n\n \n\n\fenvironmental impacts.29 The paving of roads will reduce dust, which has negative impacts on \nhuman and livestock health, crops, and safety. Measures to improve climate change resilience \ninclude stabilizing local environments by integrating soil and water conservation measures into \nsubproject  design.  Improved  irrigation  efficiency  and  sustainable  agricultural  practices  will \nreduce stresses on water and land resources. \n \n26. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  No  significant  resettlement  impacts  are \nexpected  because  the  majority  of  agriculture  infrastructure  will  be  improved  along  existing \nrights-of-way  and  will  at  most  require  the  provision  of  compensation  for  roadside  trees,  crops \nand/or  small  structures,  with  possibly  a  small  amount  of  land  acquisition.  Category  A \nsubprojects  were  eliminated  during  screening.  It  will  be  necessary  to  document  the  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  status  of  each  subproject  during  the  preparation  of  feasibility \nstudies.  The  government  and  ADB  have  agreed  on  a  resettlement  framework  along  with \nprocedures, resources, and responsibilities for preparing resettlement plans outlined in the PAM \nfor  potential  category  B  subprojects.30  Resettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  the  three \nrepresentative subprojects with no land acquisition needed. Any required resettlement plans will \nbe  submitted  and  approved  by  ADB  before  the  selected  subprojects  are  implemented. \nCompensation,  allowances,  operation,  and  administration  costs,  surveys,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  will  be  financed  from  loan  proceeds.  An  adequate  budget  for  resettlement  plan \npreparation  and  implementation  will  be  allocated  accordingly  as  well  as  provision  of \nresettlement specialists.  \n \n27. \nEthnic groups (category B): The population in the project area is predominantly Lao-\nThai, with Mon-Khmer groups generally found in the uplands of Saravane. Project activities will \nnot  cause  involuntary  changes  in  the  ethnic  groups\u2019  farming  and  livelihoods  system  or  their \ncultural  practice  and  ancestral  domains.31  Any  possible  negative  impact,  such  as  loss  of \ntemporary crops and livelihoods, will be avoided if possible or will be compensated accordingly. \nImpacts on ethnic groups in these areas are expected to be overwhelmingly positive since the \nsubprojects  will  be  aimed  at  overall  economic  and  social  improvement  of  the  total  population. \nSpecific  measures  to  deal  with  potential  negative  impacts  and  to  encourage  participation  and \ncontribution  of  ethnic  groups  based  on  their  unique  social  and  cultural  characteristics  require \ncustomized  approaches  and  interventions.  In  the  general  design  of  some  subprojects,  there \nmay  be  opportunities  for  ethnic  groups  to  participate  in  and/or  benefit  from  the  subproject \nactivities.  An  ethnic  group  planning  framework  agreed  upon  by  the  government  and  ADB  has \nbeen prepared to address this situation.32 It will guide the preparation of an ethnic group plan for \npotential category B subprojects based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). ADB will \napprove the ethnic group plans before the subproject is implemented.  \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 \n \n \n\n                                                \n29 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n31  \u201cEthnic  group\u201d  is  the  government\u2019s  preferred  term  for  indigenous  people,  Constitution  of  The  Lao  People's \n\n32  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning  Framework:  Ethnic  Group  Planning  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\nDemocratic Republic, 2003, article 8. \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n   9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nFinancial and Economic: \nFluctuations in commodity prices \nmay affect the financial and \neconomic viability of investments.  \nSustainability: Insufficient O&M \nleading to premature asset \ndeterioration. \n\nClimate: Severe weather events \naffecting implementation and \ndamaging completed agriculture \ninfrastructure. \nGovernance: Weak financial \nmanagement and procurement \ncapacity is an endemic problem in \nthe civil service, resulting from \nlimited number of skilled staff and \nrapid turnover. \nTechnical Capacity: Limited \nimplementation capacities at the \nprovincial level to meet all ADB and \nproject requirements. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nSignificant investments in agricultural extension support at farm level will \nenable diversification of cropping patterns and optimize yields. With increased \nyields and diversification to higher value crops, the financial impact on \nindividual households is strongly positive.  \nA component has been included in the project aimed directly at upgrading \nfarmers\u2019 technical knowledge and improving crop production and cropping \npatterns so that financial returns are at a level sufficient to fund O&M costs. \nFinancial analyses indicate that, with more farmers growing more and higher \nvalue crops, funding O&M will be within their financial capacity. Provision has \nbeen made for the O&M funding to be gradually transferred to WUG or WUA. \nImplementation schedules will be timed according to seasonal considerations. \nInfrastructure to be upgraded or provided will be robustly designed expressly \nto survive flooding and long-term submergence. Soil and water conservation \nmeasures are included in the design.  \nThe project will provide the full-time input of national financial and \nprocurement consultants. They will provide training to project staff; oversee \nfinancial management, disbursement, and procurement activities; and ensure \nadequate reporting to ADB. To discourage corrupt practices, implementation \nprocedures encourage maximum transparency\u2014including consultation with \nand monitoring by intended beneficiaries \nImplementation functions will only be devolved to provincial and district levels \nwhere capacity exists.
