The report also describes a proposed technical assistance (TA) for Improving Corporate \nGovernance  and  Enhancing  Institutional  Capacity  of  Environmental  and  Social  Management, \nand if the Board approves the proposed equity investment and loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  Sanchuan  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the \nequity investment and loan to finance its portfolio of small hydropower plants (HPPs) in the PRC. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nThe Power Sector \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n2. \nThe PRC has achieved and sustained rapid economic growth, averaging about 9.7% a \nyear from 1980 to 2007. The economy continues to benefit from the comparative advantage of \nlower labor costs, higher productivity levels, and easier global movement of goods and services. \nCompared  with  2000,  the  economy  is  expected  to  double  in  size  by  2010  and  quadruple  by \n2020.  With  a  population  of  1.3  billion,  the  PRC\u2019s  per  capita  electricity  consumption  is  low, \nestimated  at  2,150  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  in  2006.  By  comparison,  the  ratios  in  developed \ncountries are typically 4\u20137 times higher, and the world average is nearly double at 4,200 kWh. \nThe rapid pace of economic growth and low per capita electricity consumption have created a \nstrong demand for electricity. \n \n\n2. \n\nPower Demand and Supply \n\n3. \nThe  fast  pace  of  economic  growth  and  the  expansion  of  energy-intensive  industries, \nsuch as steel, aluminum, and cement, have driven electricity demand. Electricity demand grew \n14%  in  2007  dominated  by  the  industry,  which  accounted  for  more  than  75%  of  total  power \nconsumption. Residential consumption accounted for about 11% of the total, while commercial \nconsumption accounted for 8%; agriculture accounted for the smallest portion of demand at 4%. \nPower consumption has grown by an average of 13% annually over the past 6 years. Demand \nis expected to continue to grow 11%\u201314% annually for the next 3\u20135 years.  \n \n4. \nThe PRC\u2019s installed power generation capacity grew from 1.85 gigawatts (GW) in 1949 \nto 713.3 GW in 2007, an average annual growth rate of 10.8%. Since 2002, installed capacity \nhas  increased  at  an  annual  rate  of  at  least  13%,  including  14.4%  in  2007.  The  PRC  has \ninstalled more than 275 GW in the past 3 years. The Government plans to build an additional \n500 GW over the next 15 years, pushing installed capacity to an estimated 1,150\u20131300 GW by \n2020.  \n \n5. \nDespite  this  accelerated  capacity  addition,  the  PRC  has  faced  power  shortages  since \n2002.  However,  the  shortages  are  being  eased\u2014six  provinces  experienced  severe  power \nshortages in 2006 compared with 25 provinces in 2005. At the end of 2007, a balance between \nsupply  and  demand  in  the  country  was  generally  achieved.  However,  various  sources \nsuggested  that,  without  investment  beyond  what  the  Government  is  planning,  another \nnationwide power shortage may occur between 2010 and 2020 because of (i) rapid economic \n\n \n\n\fgrowth, (ii) the geographic separation of its coal and water resources and load demand centers, \nand (iii) the mismatch between economic growth and power construction cycles. Therefore, it is \nimportant  to  increase  private  sector  participation  and  mobilize  private  sector  investment  in  the \nsector.   \n \n\n3. \n\nEnergy Mix and Environmental Impact \n\n6. \nAt  the  end  of  2007,  thermal  power  still  accounted  for  78%  of  the  energy  generated, \nfollowed by hydropower at 20%, nuclear at 1.2%, and wind power at less than 0.6%. In spite of \nefforts to diversify the mix of fuels, the PRC is unlikely to reduce its dependence on coal in the \nnear  future.  The  dominance  of  coal  has  produced  a  number  of  problems,  especially \nenvironmental ones such as poor air quality. The PRC is now the world\u2019s largest coal producer \nand consumer. Production of raw coal more than doubled from 1 billion tons (t) in 2000 to 2.18 \nbillion t in 2005, when the PRC accounted for more than 37% of global production. The electric \npower sector is the largest consumer of coal; it consumed about 54% of the coal produced in \n2005,  which  has  resulted  in  50%  of  the  country\u2019s  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  emissions,  80%  of \nnitrogen  oxide  (NOX)  emissions,  and  26%  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  Acid  rain  caused \nprimarily  by  SO2  and  NOx  falls  on  one-third  of  the  country.  In  2005,  of  the  PRC\u2019s  342  major \ncities, only 128 met the acceptable air quality standards (national class II air quality standards). \nA combination of coal combustion and desertification causes poor air quality. \n \n\n4. \n\nSector Development and Policy Framework \n\n7. \nSince  April  2002,  with  the  implementation  of  a  power  sector  reform  plan,  the  PRC\u2019s \npower  sector  has  changed  substantially.  The  role  of  the  market  in  developing,  operating,  and \neffectively  regulating  the  power  sector  has  been  promoted.  The  reforms  have  included  the \nintroduction of competition for efficiency improvements, reduction of costs, implementation of a \nmarket-based pricing mechanism, optimal resource allocation, nationwide grid connection, and \nseparation of government and commercial functions.  \n \n8. \nDuring  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP),  significant  progress  was  made:  (i)  the  State \nPower  Corporation,  the  sole  government  entity  responsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  of  electricity,  was  broken  up;  (ii)  generation  operations  were  separated  from \ntransmission;  (iii)  the  generation  assets  of  State  Power  were  divided  into  five  independent \ngeneration  companies;  and  (iv)  two  grid  companies,  State  Power  Grid  Company  and  South \nPRC  Power  Grid  Company,  were  formed.  The  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  was \nestablished  in  October  2002  to  introduce  competitive  markets  for  power  generation.  Regional \nwholesale  power  markets  are  being  piloted  in  the  northeast,  central,  eastern,  and  southern \nregions.  \n \nSector reforms are expected to continue and intensify in the 11th FYP. However, in line \n9. \nwith  the  plan\u2019s  priority on  rural  development,  sector  policies  have  been  aligned  to  (i)  minimize \nany  imbalance  between  urban  and  rural  electricity  services,  (ii)  achieve  uniform  urban\u2013rural \ntariffs,  and  (iii)  improve the  provision  of  electricity  to  unserved  rural  areas.  The  11th  FYP  also \nhighlights the strategic significance of diversifying energy supply by providing more renewable \nenergy,  including  small  hydropower,  wind,  solar,  geothermal  power,  and  bioenergy.  The \nobjectives for renewable energy development during the 11th FYP include (i) speeding up the \nexploitation  and  utilization  of  renewable  energy,  (ii)  increasing  the  proportion  of  renewable \nenergy in the total energy consumption, (iii) solving the fuel shortage for rural populations that  \ndo  not  have  access  to  electricity,  (iv)  promoting  the  development  of  renewable  energy \ntechnology and industry, and (v) advancing the research and industrialization level of renewable \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\ntechnology.  The  PRC\u2019s  goal  is  to  increase  renewable  energy\u2019s  share  of  total  energy \nconsumption to 10% by 2010 and 15% by 2020. \n \n10. \nThe  Government  has  offered  preferential  policies  that  strongly  support  small-scale \nhydropower,  and  has  included  small  HPPs  in  its  rural  electrification  plans.  These  policies \ninclude  preferential  taxes,  soft  loans  and  grants,  the  promotion  of  private  sector  investment  in \nsmall  HPPs,  and  the  protection  of  supply  areas  and  private  property.  The  Government  also \nrecently implemented additional policies to encourage the development of renewable energies, \nsuch as requiring grids to purchase all the electricity output of small HPPs. \n \n\n5. \n\nTariff \n\nThe retail and power plant output tariffs in the PRC are regulated. They are fixed by the \n11. \nprice  bureau  according  to  the  guidance  issued  by  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (NDRC). In the case of power plants, they are announced at the beginning of the \nyear for units starting their commercial operations during that year. The generators connected to \nthe  grid  sell  their  energy  and  are  paid  according  to  many  factors,  such  as  age  of  the  plant, \nreasonable  rates  of  return,  and  total  costs  of  the  plant.  Usually  once  every  1\u20132  years,  NDRC \nadjusts  the  tariffs\u2014so  far  only  upwards\u2014based  on  various  factors,  including  supply  and \ndemand, and fuel costs.  \n \n12. \nIn  the  ongoing  sector  reform,  retail  tariffs  are  being  unbundled  into  generation,  and \ntransmission and distribution tariffs. The principles of full cost recovery and adequate return on \ninvestment  have  been  embedded  in  the  sector  tariff  formulation  for  more  than  a  decade  and \nhave  been  applied  consistently.  The  power  tariff  reforms  are  encouraging  greater  use  of \nrenewable energies, including wind, solar, small hydropower, and bioenergy. Although no new \ntake-or-pay  contract  in  the  power  sector  has  been  signed  for  almost  a  decade,  under  the \nrenewable energy law passed in 2005, all energy generated from renewable sources must be \npurchased by the grid companies. \n \n\n6. \n\nConstraints on Private Sector Participation \n\nThe majority of the PRC\u2019s water resources are in the mountainous areas in the west and \n13. \nsouthwest  regions,  which  have  the  most  underdeveloped  economies  in  the  country.  The \nmunicipal and provincial governments have responsibility and are keen to develop hydropower \nprojects.  However,  public  funding  for  hydropower  projects  is  limited,  mainly  because  the \nmunicipal  and  provincial  governments  (i)  have  small  financial  budgets  and  large  overall \ninfrastructure needs, (ii) have little access to multilateral or other external financing sources, and \n(iii) may not be able to meet the government\u2019s counterpart funding requirements. Moreover, the \ninvestment, construction, and operation of HPPs require special knowledge and sector-specific \nexperience that most local governments lack. \n \n14. \nPrivate  sector  participation,  accompanied  by  funding  and  experience,  is  needed  to \ndevelop the hydropower sector in the PRC, especially in the western region. However, private \ninvestors have targeted large hydropower projects developed by major publicly listed companies. \nAlthough  the  Government  has  encouraged  private  sector  participation  in  small  hydropower \ndevelopment,  private  funding  sources  have  not  shown  much  interest  because  of  (i)  the \nsophisticated  technical  requirements,  (ii)  high  transaction  costs,  and  (iii)  unfavorable  financing \nmarket.  \n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nSetting  up  the  complicated  funding  structures  for  small  hydropower  projects  carries \n15. \nrelatively high transaction costs. Traditional funding structures usually require a high proportion \nof  equity  investment  and/or  recourse  to  a  strong  parent  company.  Local  investors  and/or \noperators  are  typically  relatively  new  and  have  limited  financial  resources,  restricting  their \ncapacity  to  develop  a  large  number  of  projects.  Moreover,  long-term  private  sector  financing, \nwhich is desperately needed in the small hydropower sector, is nearly nonexistent, limiting local \nprivate sector participation and restricting mobilization of resources for the sector. Consequently, \ndedicated and qualified local sponsors of small hydropower development need to be prioritized, \nespecially those who are willing to develop in the western region. This can be achieved through \nequity  investment  and  long-term  debt\u2014ADB  has  extensive  experience  in  this  and  similar \nsectors\u2014which will in turn mobilize other financing. \n \nB. \n\nADB Operations, Strategy, and Sector Policy \n\n(i) \n\n(Strategy  2020): \n\nframework  2008\u20132020 \n\ninclusive  economic  growth, \n\n16. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  the  PRC  has  four  strategic  pillars:  (i) inclusive  growth  and \nbalanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability,  (iii)  regional \ncooperation  and  public  goods,  and  (iv)  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  development.1 \nThis is consistent with the three strategic development agendas highlighted in ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic \n(ii) \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  (iii)  regional  integration. 2 In  the  PRC,  ADB  aims  to \nachieve a better development balance between rural and urban areas, and between coastal and \ninland  regions.  The  emphasis  on  infrastructure  projects  in  rural  areas  and  less-developed \ncentral and western regions has increased.  \n \nThe  PRC  has  been  steadily  transforming  itself  into  a  market  economy,  which  has \n17. \nbecome  the  driving  force  for  economic  growth  and  job  creation.  In  addition  to  providing  policy \nadvice  to  the  Government  on  private  sector  development,  ADB  offers  project-based  financial \nassistance.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the  PRC  have  focused  on  infrastructure  and \nenergy, finance, and environmental improvements. In infrastructure and energy, ADB prioritizes \npioneering  projects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to  encourage  private \nsector  participation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and  improve  corporate  governance.  As \nagreed upon with the Government, ADB private sector operations will identify and support viable \nprojects  located  in  the  less-developed  central  and  western  regions,  and  will  explore  the \npossibility of using proceeds of yuan-denominated bonds for lending to local borrowers.  \n \n18. \nIn  its  1995  Energy  Policy,  ADB  emphasized  the  need  to  accelerate  the  application  of \nrenewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  in  its  developing  member  countries  (DMCs). 3 This \nemphasis  was  strengthened  in  the  Energy  Policy  Review  of  2000;4 a  further  review  in  2006 \nresulted  in  a  2007  draft  document,  which  is  being  finalized,  that  outlines  ADB\u2019s  new  energy \nstrategy.  This  draft  strategy\u2014which  is  aligned  with  Strategy  2020\u2014aims  to  meet  energy \ndemand in a sustainable way, provide energy access for all, and support energy sector reform \nand governance.  \n \n19. \nFor a number of years, ADB has promoted clean energy initiatives to minimize adverse \nlocal  and  regional  impacts  of  climate  change,  and  has  emphasized  the  acceleration  of  the \nwidespread  application  of  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  in  its  DMCs.

As  part  of  the \nCMI,  the  Asia  Pacific  Carbon  Fund 5 will  provide  up-front  funding  against  the  purchase  of  an \nestimated  25%\u201350%  of  future  carbon  credits  expected  from  projects.  In  addition,  the  initiative \nwill  provide  grants  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  eligible  projects.  The  CMI  was \ncreated as a mechanism to boost the viability of alternative clean energy sources in developing \ncountries, while also assisting developed countries in meeting their Kyoto Protocol commitments \nfor cutting greenhouse gas emissions. It is an effective tool for addressing energy security and \nclimate change\u2014two of the most pressing global issues today. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n20. \nThe Project, which provides for an equity investment, loan, and technical assistance by \nADB,  will  support  the  expansion  and  capital  expenditure  plan  of  Zhejiang  Zhongda  Sanchuan \nHydropower  Development  Co.,  Ltd.  (ZDSC)  to  build,  rehabilitate,  expand,  upgrade,  privatize, \nand/or  operate  small  HPPs.  Most  of  these  are  in  the  relatively  underdeveloped  central  and \nwestern regions of the PRC. The Project aims to enhance the development of small, emission-\nfree  HPPs,  which  have  limited  environmental  impacts  and  generate  the  most  affordable \nrenewable  energy, \nthrough  private  sector  participation.  These  plants  would  combat \nenvironmental degradation and the threat of climate change by reducing the country\u2019s reliance \non  coal  for  energy  generation.  The  Project  also  will  support  regional  economic  growth  and \nequitable  economic  development  of  the  country  by  transferring  proven  technology  and \nsuccessful experience of the private sector from the relatively developed coastal region to the \nrelatively  underdeveloped  central  and  western  regions  for  the  development  of  hydropower \nresources in a sustainable manner.  \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nHolding Company \n\n21. \nZDSC,  together  with  ADB,  IFC,  and  other  investors,  will  establish  Sanchuan,  a  new \nholding company in Yunnan Province, to focus on the development of small HPPs in central and \nwestern PRC. In the next 3\u20134 years, before its planned initial public offering (IPO), Sanchuan is \nprojecting  to  add  about  300  MW  of  capacity  through  (i)  privatization  of  small  HPPs  owned  by \nlocal  governments,  (ii)  acquisition  of  partly  completed  small  HPPs  that  are  facing  financial \nand/or technical constraints, and (iii) development of small greenfield HPPs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSmall Hydropower Plants \n\n22. \nThe  relevant  local  government  grants  each  small  HPP  a  specific  hydropower \ndevelopment  right  for  an  unlimited  period.  The  feasibility  study,  environmental  impact \nassessment, and project design are prepared by the project sponsor and approved by the local \ngovernment.  Each  HPP  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  granted  approvals,  subject  to \ngovernment  inspections  during  construction  and  operation  on  various  aspects,  including \nenvironment, safety, quality, and sanitation.  \n\n                                                 \n5   Contributors:  the  governments  of  Belgium,  Finland,  Luxembourg,  Portugal,  Spain,  and  Sweden;  and  the  Climate \n\nChange Foundation. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n23. \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  FI  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003) and will adopt an environmental management system (EMS) following ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). The corporate EMS will be developed under TA from ADB following \nthe  indicative  EMS  guidelines  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  Identified  subprojects \nwill be classified as A or B based on a screening process that will determine the significance of \npotential  environmental  damage.  An  environmental  assessment  process, \nincluding  an \nenvironmental  management  plan,  will  be  followed  and  implemented  for  the  subprojects \ncomplying with both national and ADB safeguards requirements; operational or partly completed \nsubprojects will be audited.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n24. \nDue diligence was conducted on the social safeguards of ZDSC\u2019s current operations. As \nsome  of  the  HPPs  visited  entailed  significant  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  the  Project  is  \ncategorized as A in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). None of the \nHPPs  visited  affected  any  ethnic  minorities.  However,  since  Sanchuan  is  likely  to  expand  its \noperations  in  Yunnan  Province  where  there  are  many  ethnic  minority  groups,  the  Project  is \ncategorized  as  A/B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  The \nenvironmental and social safeguards assessment due diligence report is Appendix 5. \n \n25. \nIn  the  event  that  Sanchuan\u2019s  small  HPPs  affect  ethnic  minorities  and  involve \nresettlement, Sanchuan will ensure that the appropriate resettlement plan and/or ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan are prepared and implemented following the agreed upon social safeguards \nframework (Supplementary Appendix B) and in accordance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policy \nrequirements. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n26. \nThe Project will be an important catalyst for economic growth in the PRC, particularly in \nthe  less-developed  rural  areas  and  central  and  western  regions.  All  the  existing  and  future \nHPPs  under  the  Project  are  in  the  poor,  remote  rural  areas.  As  such,  project  activities  during \nconstruction  and  operation  will  provide  jobs  and  other  significant  direct  benefit  to  the  local \ncommunities. Further, the acquisition and completion of the partly completed small HPPs facing \nfinancial and/or technical constraints will utilize the idle assets, eliminating a major bottleneck in \nthe economic development of central and western PRC.  \n \n27. \nHPPs will increase electricity supply through clean energy production, which will benefit \nmost the people living in the neighboring rural areas. Relying on large coal-fired power plants to \nprovide  electricity  to  rural  areas  through  an  extensive  transmission  network  is  too  costly  and \ninefficient  because  of  the  substantial  losses  during  transmission.  This  is  why  retail  electricity \ntariffs  in  the  rural  areas  are  expensive  compared  to  other  areas,  which  constrains  the \ndevelopment of the local economy. By locating power plants close to the end users, prices can \nbe  substantially  reduced  and  efficiency  increased\u2014the  main  reasons  why  the  Government \nstrongly  promotes  small  HPPs  in  the  rural  electrification  program.  About  50%  of  the  rural \npopulation relies on small HPPs for reliable, affordable electricity. The Project will contribute to \nan increase in this percentage. The Project will also provide significant additional tax revenue to \n\n\f7 \n\nthe  local  governments,  which  may  be  used  for  economic  development  programs.  Hydropower \ndevelopment is likely to increase the flood control capacity of the related river basins, which will \nstrongly benefit the agricultural development. \n \nThe Project will have significant environmental benefits in terms of air pollution avoided \n28. \nfrom  coal-fired  plants  that  would  otherwise  be  used  to  generate  power.  The  average  annual \navoided emissions were estimated at 670 t of total suspended particulate, 5,400 t of SO2, 4,000 \nt of NOx, and more than 1 million t of carbon dioxide. On completion of the capital expenditures \nin 2011, the Project will have avoided about 2.8 million t of coal use per year of operation.  \n \n29. \nThe Project will promote private sector participation in small hydropower development in \nthe  PRC,  aiming  to  increase  the  amount  of  available  private  capital  in  the  sector,  which  is  a \npriority for improving the country\u2019s energy mix. ZDSC, a local private sector developer based in \na  relatively  advanced  coastal  region,  will  transfer  its  assets,  financial  resources,  successful \nexperience,  and  good  practice  to  the  less-developed  Yunnan  Province  in  central  and  western \nPRC  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  private  sector  development  of  the  small  HPPs  will  free  up \nlocal government resources and provide additional tax revenues, which may be used for other \nvital social and health expenditures. \n \n30. \nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  development  of  local  capital  markets \nthrough its use of funds raised locally. If the Project is implemented, and subject to Government \napproval,  ADB  may  issue  another  yuan-denominated  bond  (panda  bond)  to  fund  the  Project. \nThis would help the Government to improve the bond market in the PRC. The proposed loan in \ntranche B will catalyze the participation by international commercial banks, which rely heavily on \nthe anchor position of ADB and IFC in the Project. Further, ADB and IFC will catalyze the first \nconcessionary  loan  to  be  approved  by  the  newly  established  China  CDM  Fund,  which  is \nadministered  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  Project  establishes  an  excellent  platform  for  the \npartnership  of  ADB,  IFC,  Government,  local  governments,  local  and  international  commercial \nbanks, and international private equity investors.  \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\nThe development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \n31. \ndevelopment,  business success,  and  economic  sustainability,  according  to  the  implementation \nguidelines  contained  in  Good-Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations.6 Sanchuan  will  be  in  a  position  to  comfortably  fund  the  construction,  privatization, \nexpansion, and rehabilitation of small HPPs in the PRC, mainly in the central and western rural \nareas.  This  will  increase  the  supply  of  electricity  and  avoid  the  pollution  that  would  otherwise \nhave been generated by coal-fired plants. The increase in electricity supply from its HPPs will \nlead  to  higher  revenue  and  reinforce  Sanchuan\u2019s  financial  sustainability  and  continuous \noperations.  On  a  broader  level,  the  development  effectiveness  will  be  reflected  in  the  higher \ncapacity and better environment in the PRC. The impact of this can be observed by assessing \nthe general supply in the power sector and the air quality in the PRC.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6   Multilateral  Development  Banks  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group.  2001.

ZDSC has been seeking strategic investors to enable the company \nto  continue  to  grow  in  the  rapidly  expanding  sector.  ADB  is  expected  to  assist  Sanchuan  in \nenhancing  its  corporate  governance  and  improving  its  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem.  ADB\u2019s  equity  investment  will  help  Sanchuan  secure  the  confidence  of  international \ninvestors  and  attract  more  funds  to  continue  expanding  in  the  small  hydropower  sector  in  the \nPRC. \n \n34. \nThe  proposed  equity  investment  will  be  documented  appropriately  and  all  contractual \nand financial arrangements should be satisfactory to ADB. The disbursement will be subject to \ncomprehensive  conditions  precedent,  including  all  necessary  governmental,  creditor,  and \nshareholder approvals and consents. \n \nB. \n\nLoan \n\nThe proposed ADB loan will have two tranches: tranche A, funded by ADB; and tranche \n\n35. \nB, funded by commercial banks. \n \nTranche  A  is  for  up  to  CNY400  million.  Tranche  A  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR \n36. \nwithout  government  guarantee,  and  will  be  funded  from  the  proceeds  of  yuan-denominated \nbonds issued by ADB.8 Tranche A will have an interest rate to be determined in accordance with \nprocedures  applicable  to  ADB  local  currency  loans,  as  well  as  a  commitment  fee  and  a  front-\nend fee to be approved by ADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee.  \n \n37. \nTranche  B,  for  up  to  $120  million,  will  be  funded  by  international  commercial  banks \nunder  terms  and  conditions  to  be  mutually  agreed  upon  between  Sanchuan  and  the \nparticipating commercial banks, with the concurrence of ADB. ADB will charge an arrangement \nfee  and  annual  administration  fee,  to  be  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Pricing  and  Credit  Enhancement \nCommittee in accordance with ADB's credit enhancement operations policies. \n \nThe proposed loan will be documented in a loan agreement, which will contain standard \n38. \nterms  and  conditions  that  apply  to  loans  to  private  sector  borrowers  without  government \nguarantee. The terms of the loan will include financial and operational covenants and reporting \nrequirements. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB  may  structure  the  proposed  equity  investment  through  an  offshore  special  purpose  company  to  be  set  up \n\ntogether with other investors. This is in line with international practice.  \n\n8   The disbursement in yuan will be subject to ADB\u2019s funding availability. If ADB is unable to procure sufficient yuan to \n\nfund tranche A, Sanchuan can request ADB to disburse the entire or a portion of tranche A in US dollars. \n\n\f9 \n\nC. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\nLike  most  rapidly  expanding  private  companies  in  the  PRC,  ZDSC  has  satisfactory \n39. \ntechnical  and  management  skills.  However,  its  major  weaknesses  include  (i)  poor  corporate \ngovernance, and (ii) a lack of institutional capacity for environmental and social management.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImpact, Outcome, Methodology, and Key Activities \n\n40. \nThe  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  substantial  improvement  of  Sanchuan\u2019s  corporate \ngovernance and institutional capacity of environmental and social management. It is agreed and \nwill be documented that after the TA is implemented, Sanchuan will offer free support, including \nseminars  and  workshops,  to  other  renewable  energy  companies  in  the  PRC  on  corporate \ngovernance and environmental and social management. Therefore, the impact of the TA is the \nenhancement  of  the  standards  for  corporate  governance  and  environmental  and  social \nmanagement of the entire sector. \n \n41. \nThe outputs of the TA will be (i) a set of corporate policies, procedures, and guidelines \non both corporate governance and environmental and social safeguard system; and (ii) a well-\ndesigned  and  established  corporate  structure  to  implement  the  policies.  Through  needs \nassessment,  training,  capacity  building,  and  an  awareness  campaign,  the  TA  will  offer  a \ncomprehensive  capacity  building  package.  After  TA  implementation,  the  outputs  should  be \nreplicable, with easy modification, by other similar companies for the benefit the entire sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n42. \nThe  TA  will  cost  the  equivalent  of  $800,000,  of  which  ADB  will  finance  $700,000  on  a \ngrant basis through the TA funding program. Sanchuan will finance the remainder, equivalent to \n$100,000, \nfacilities, \ncounterpart  staff,  and  data  collection  for  the  TA.  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n\nincluding  office  accommodation  and \n\nin-kind  contributions, \n\nthrough \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangement  \n\n43. \nADB,  as  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  TA,  will  be  responsible  for  all  technical \nimplementation issues. ADB and Sanchuan will form a TA task force comprising representatives \nat appropriate levels from ADB, Sanchuan, and the consultants to be hired. The task force will \nmeet  regularly  to  assess  the  needs,  followed  by  capacity  building  modules.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 15 months from the date its services start. \n \n44. \nThe  TA  will  be  carried  out  by  international  and  domestic  consultants  to  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  To  assist  the  international  consultants,  the  national  consultants  will  quickly  become \nfamiliar with their tasks by reviewing relevant reports, analytical data, policies, and regulations, \nas well as translating documents into English. The outline terms of reference for consultants are \nin  Appendix  7.  To \nthe \nadministration  process,  a  part  of  the  team  or  the  whole  team  of  international  or  national \nconsultants could be recruited through consulting firms. \n \n\nthe  selection  process  and  consequently  streamline \n\nfacilitate \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nD. \n\nJustification  \n\n45. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the  Project  is  justified  based  on  its  development  impacts  and \ndemonstration effects. It will support the Government\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies. ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n \n\nThe Project will support the energy policy in the Government\u2019s 11th FYP, which \nprioritizes  the  development  of  renewable  energy  projects  in  an  environmentally \nand  socially  responsible  manner  for  the  purpose  of  optimizing  the  country\u2019s \nenergy mix, enhancing energy security, and protecting the environment.  \n\nThe Project is also in line with the Government\u2019s Western Region Development \nStrategy,  which  aims  to  enhance  economic  development  and  reduce  poverty  in \nwestern  PRC\u2014the  key  theme  of  the  11th  FYP.  The  strategy  aims  to  reduce \ndevelopment disparities between the western and coastal regions.   \n\nThe Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy in the PRC and the \npartnership  in  the  energy  sectors  between  ADB  and  PRC.  The  Project  could \nbecome a model for utilizing the experience, technology, and financial resources \nof a private sector developer from a relatively developed area (Zhejiang Province \nin the Yangtze delta) to support the economic development  in the remote, poor \nrural areas in the underdeveloped central and western PRC. It is fully in line with \nADB\u2019s  primary  goal  in  the  PRC,  which  is  to  promote  pro-poor  equitable  and \ninclusive growth. In the energy sector of the PRC, ADB is (a) assisting the poor \nand less-developed central and western regions, (b) promoting the development \nof clean energy, and (c) increasing interregional power transmission capacity and \nimproving power system efficiency. \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy  initiative  to  accelerate  the \napplication of renewable energy and energy efficiency in DMCs. The small HPPs \ncan  form  part  of  a  country\u2019s  least-cost  energy  development  plan;  and  their \nenvironmental  and  social  effects,  if  any,  can  be  managed  satisfactorily  in \naccordance with established ADB policies.  \n\nThe  Project  will  help  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  by  using \nclean  energy,  which  is  one  major  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  program  on  clean  energy \nand  the  environment  and  its  associated  CMI.  ADB\u2019s  technical  support  facility \nunder the CMI is assisting Sanchuan to process new CDM projects and generate \nmore carbon credit and will continue to do so.  \n\nThe  Project  reflects  the  energy  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the \nPRC. In the infrastructure and energy sectors, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects \nwith  innovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and \nimprove  corporate \ngovernance.  The  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  optimize  Sanchuan\u2019s  capital \nstructure  and  mobilize  long-term  commercial  finance,  which  is  currently  not \navailable to the private sector, for the small hydropower sector. \n\nfinance  small-  and  medium-scale \nto \nThe  Project  will  demonstrate  how \nhydropower projects in the PRC. As a multi-project facility, the Project will enable \nADB to extend its reach to smaller HPPs that would be difficult to assist directly, \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nwhile  leveraging  the  experience  and  know-how  of  a  local  developer.  The \npresence  of  ADB  and  IFC  will  also  assure  all  project  participants,  including \ninvestors,  financiers,  and  local  governments,  that  the  Project  and  associated \nsmall HPPs are financially, environmentally, and socially sound and sustainable \nin the long run. \n\n \nE. \n\nAnticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism  \n\nZDSC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the \n46. \nCombating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003). Consistent with \nits  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require \nSanchuan  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering \nactivities, or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities.  The  loan  and  equity  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  Sanchuan  will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n47. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nSanchuan.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.  ADB  will  enter \ninto finance documents acceptable to ADB following the approval of the proposed financing by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n48. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  equity  investment  and  loan  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\nthe  equity  investment  in  Sanchuan  Clean  Energy  Development  Company, \nLimited  for  an  amount  up  to  $25,000,000  to  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources;
