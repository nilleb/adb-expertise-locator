Traffic volume will \ndouble within 7\u20138 years. Development of transport infrastructure, \nespecially the expressway network, is essential to achieve rapid \neconomic growth. The TA Loan Project will assist the Government \nand  VEC  in  preparing  the  following  high-priority  expressway \nprojects: (i) the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway, to be linked \nwith  the  existing  Nanning\u2013Youyiguan  Expressway  in  Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC); (ii) the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway, to be \nlinked with the planned Fangcheng\u2013Dongxing Expressway in the \nGZAR;  and  (iii)  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressway,  to \nstrengthen connectivity in the southern suburbs of Ho Chi Minh \nCity  (HCMC).  These  expressways  are  all  part  of  the  GMS \neconomic corridors identified in the GMS transport sector strategy \nstudy endorsed by the GMS governments in May 2006.  \n   ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  Through  implementation  of  the  TA  Loan  Project,  the  three \nexpressway  projects  will  be  designed  and  prepared  for \ninvestment. The expressways will promote the efficient movement \nof goods and people between northeastern Viet Nam and GZAR, \nand  within  the  greater  HCMC  area.  Ultimately,  the  TA  Loan \nProject  will  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  growth  and \nenhanced economic exchange between Viet Nam and the PRC, \nand  promote  socioeconomic  development  in  the  project-\ninfluenced areas. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The TA Loan Project is estimated to cost $30.8 million equivalent, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.3 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Amount  % of \nSource  ($ million)  Total \nAsian Development Bank  26.0  84 \nVietnam Expressway Corporation  4.8    16 \nTotal  30.8  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amounts and  A loan equivalent to $26 million in special drawing rights will be \nLending Terms  provided from the Special Funds resources of ADB. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years and an \ninterest rate of 3.15% per annum during the life of the loan period, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of Viet Nam will be the Borrower for the ADB \nTerms  loan. The entire loan proceeds will be relent to the VEC, as the \nExecuting Agency, on terms acceptable to ADB, and at ADB\u2019s \ninterest rate applicable to the loans, plus a relending fee pursuant \nto the Borrower\u2019s regulations. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Vietnam Expressway Corporation \n   \nImplementation  VEC will have overall responsibility for project implementation, \nArrangements  and will establish a new project implementation unit no. 3 (PIU3) \nto  manage  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  PIU3  will  have \nresponsibility  for  day-to-day  project  implementation,  and  will \ncoordinate with the people\u2019s committees of the project cities (Ha \nNoi and HCMC) and provinces (Bac Ninh, Bac Giang, Lang Son, \nHai Phong, Quang Ninh, Long An, and Dong Nai) in determining \nexpressway alignments, and preparing and implementing the land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  activities  and  the  livelihood \ndevelopment and income restoration programs. \n   ", "  iii\nConsulting Services  For  each  expressway  project,  the  following  four  kinds  of \nconsulting  services  will  be  undertaken:  (i)  project  feasibility \nconsulting services, to be funded by the associated TA grants, will \nprepare  engineering,  economic,  financial,  social,  and \nenvironmental  feasibility  studies;  (ii)  project  design  consulting \nservices, to be funded by the TA loan, will (a) prepare detailed \ndesigns, (b) update resettlement plans, EMDPs (or EMSAs), EIAs \nand EMPs based on the detailed designs, and (c) assist in the \nprocurement  of  civil  works  and  the  implementation  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement;  (iii)  detailed  design  appraisal \nconsulting services, to be funded by the TA loan, will review the \ndetailed designs and project cost estimates in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s internal procedures; and (iv) external resettlement \nmonitoring consulting services, to be funded by the TA loan.  \n \nADB  will  recruit  international  consulting  firms  for  the  project \nfeasibility study, using quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) \nprocedures, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The economy of Viet Nam has been growing rapidly, with gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowing at an average annual rate of 7.5% from 2001 to 2005, and expected accelerated growth \nof 10% annually up to 2010. Traffic volume will double within 7\u20138 years. Development of \ntransport  infrastructure,  especially  the  expressway  network,  is  essential  to  achieve  rapid \neconomic  growth.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  funding  to  assist  the \nGovernment in preparing an expressway master plan for the national expressway system.1 The \nplan identifies a logical national network with a total length of about 5,000 kilometers (km). \nBased on economic and financial viability, priority is given to the expressway network with high \ncapacity  that  will  connect  key  economic  and  industrial  zones,  large  urban  centers,  and \ninternational  borders.  In  the  expressway  master  plan,  construction  of  about  2,000  km \nexpressway will have commenced by 2015, and 500 km of expressway will be open to public \ntraffic by 2015. \n \n3.  Out of the priority expressway network, the Government of Viet Nam has requested ADB \nto consider financing the construction of (i) the Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway (about 120 km) \nand the Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway (about 120 km) in the northern region (Map 1), which \nare  key  sections  of  the  GMS  eastern  corridor  linking  Viet  Nam  and  Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous Region (GZAR) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); and (ii) the Ben Luc\u2013\nLong Thanh Expressway (about 60 km) in the south of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) (Map 2), \nwhich is a key section of the GMS southern corridor which links Viet Nam, Cambodia, and \nThailand, and intersects with the GMS eastern corridor (Map 3). This TA Loan Project, with \nassociated TA grants, will prepare the three expressway projects. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. The regional dimension of the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha \nLong\u2013Mong Cai Expressways is summarized in Appendix 2. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  The GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway is proposed to be constructed parallel to \nNational Highway No.1 (NH1), which was upgraded under the ADB-assisted Second Road \nImprovement Project,2 as well as to the single-track railway in northern Viet Nam leading to \n(cid:31)F\nGZAR. The distance between Ha Noi and the border town of Huu Nghi in Lang Son province is \nabout 130 km. The GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway forms part of the GMS eastern corridor, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Expressway Network Development \nPlan Project. Manila (TA 4695-VIE).  \n2  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Road Improvement Project. Manila (Loan 1487-VIE). ", "2 \nwhich was identified under the GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study (TSSS)3 as one of nine \n(cid:31)F\ntransport corridors, and runs from Nanning in GZAR to Ha Noi. Along the proposed expressway \nroute in Bac Ninh and Bac Giang provinces, traffic is considerable, while in Lang Son province it \nis relatively low. It currently takes 3 hours to drive from Ha Noi to Huu Nghi. Cross-border trade \nbetween GZAR and Viet Nam has been expanding at about 4% per year. However, the volume \nof cargo transported by trucks peaked in 2003 and has since been declining. This is due to \ncumbersome  border  crossing  formalities  and  the  absence  of  exchange  of  traffic  rights \narrangements between the PRC and Viet Nam, which results in time-consuming and costly \ntransshipment at the border checkpoints. The proposed expressway, which will link with the \nADB-assisted  expressway  from  Nanning  (the  capital  of  GZAR)  to  the  border  town  of \nYouyiguan,4 combined with streamlining of cross-border operations, is expected to boost cross-\n(cid:31)F\nborder trade between Viet Nam and GZAR. It is important to reasonably forecast the traffic \ndemand growth, reflecting the economic growth in the area and potential modal shift from \nmotorcycles to passenger cars in Viet Nam, as well as the expansion of trade between Viet \nNam and GZAR. There is only one daily passenger train, as passenger traffic appears to have \nshifted to the improved NH1. On average, eight freight trains run per week, transporting mainly \nheavy materials and products such as ore and steel. It is less likely, therefore, that there will be \na modal shift arising from the construction of the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway.  \n \n5.  The existing NH18 runs along the northern coast from Ha Long to Mong Cai, through \nMong Duong. It is identified as a priority GMS transport project under the TSSS. The distance \nbetween Ha Long and Mong Cai is about 200 km. NH18 has four lanes in city areas and two \nlanes in other places. The road is generally in good condition, except for a 10\u201320 km section \nfrom Mong Cai, which is in poor condition. It currently takes 6 hours to drive from Ha Long to \nMong Cai. NH18 is being used as a heavy freight route, with an estimated 500 truck-trailers \ncarrying 40-foot maritime containers using it each day. Hai Phong port in northern Viet Nam \nserves as a gateway for the PRC in importing goods from other Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) countries. The containers arrive at Hai Phong port and are immediately \ntransported to GZAR. The geometric alignment of NH18 is within acceptable standards, but \ncurve radius and lane width are considered too sharp and narrow for truck-trailers; many traffic \naccidents occur on this road. It has many short bridges with a load limit of 13 tons, and these \nbridges are damaged by truck-trailers carrying 40-foot maritime containers. NH18 is also being \nused as a tourism route. Passenger bus services have been developed, but there is no railway \nservice. In this regard, a new expressway of acceptable design standards should be considered \nin order to reduce travel time and transport costs, improve road safety in the influence area of \nNH18, promote tourism, and maintain the road assets of NH18. The use of NH18 as a long-term \nfreight route, however, remains uncertain, as three major ports in GZAR are being expanded by \nthe GZAR authority. Therefore it is important to carefully carry out transport and trade analyses, \nsurvey  related  infrastructure  development  in  the  influence  area,  and  conduct  traffic  flow \nassessments between Viet Nam and GZAR along this route.  \n \n6.  The Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway will be a southern link of the HCMC\u2019s outer ring \nexpressway as well as a short link of the north\u2013south expressway in Viet Nam, and will be \nconnected to the planned HCMC\u2013Vung Tau Expressway. The expressway forms part of the \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector Strategy Study, Manila (TA \n6195-REG).  Objective  of  the  GMS  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study  is  to  establish  a  well-built,  seamless, \nmultimodal subregional transport network that will contribute significantly to fully connecting the GMS. It was \nendorsed by the GMS governments in May 2007.    \n4  ADB. 2001.

The project was \ncompleted on 31 January 2008. \n ", "3 \nGMS southern economic corridor route from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, HCMC, and Vung Tau, \nas well as the GMS eastern economic corridor from Nanning to Ha Noi and HCMC. In the \nsouthern area of HCMC, east\u2013west traffic is restricted due to lack of river crossing facilities, \nforcing vehicles into the center of HCMC. Modal shift from motorcycles to passenger cars has \nalready been substantial in the project area. Construction of HCMC ring roads to establish \nconnectivity with neighboring cities by expressway links is considered a high priority by the \nGovernment.  In  this  regard,  the  proposed  expressway  will  have  significant  impacts  on \nsocioeconomic activities in the cities and towns around HCMC, and also will improve traffic \nproblems  in  the  center  of  HCMC  by  diverting  the  through  traffic  to  the  expressway.  The \nexpressway will be used as freight route to and from the HCMC river port. The Nha Be and \nLong Tau rivers in the project area are used as navigation channels for large cargo ships \naccessing the HCMC river port. Two bridges or tunnels need to be constructed across the \nrivers. If bridges are selected, these will have to be long-spanned bridges with a 50\u201360 meter \n(m) navigational clearance. The Mekong Delta area contains major agricultural fields which are \ncapable of rice triple-cropping. Industrial parks, such as in food processing, are being developed \nin the project area. The proposed expressway will be used as a freight route to transport food \nproduced in the Mekong Delta to the rest of the country by land and maritime transport.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Appendix 3 provides an analysis of the road subsector. Goals in the sector road map set \nout in 2006 are being achieved. Major issues in the road subsector are insufficient highway \ncapacity and high accident rates. In parallel with economic growth and income increase, traffic \ndemand for roads and traffic volume on roads has rapidly increased. For example, on NH1 \nbetween Ha Noi, Lang Son, and Huu Nghi (the border with the PRC), average annual traffic \ngrowth of 87% was recorded on the section between Ha Noi and Cao Beng; growth of 21% was \nrecorded on the section between Bac Giang and Lang Son; and growth of 37% was recorded on the \nsection between Lang Son and Huu Nghi, from April 2001 to July 2003.5 Road fatalities and \n(cid:31)F\ninjuries in Viet Nam rapidly increased in the late 1990s, although this increase stopped in 2002, \nand the number of injuries from traffic accidents has substantially dropped since then. However, \nthe number of fatalities from traffic accidents remains high, at 12,000\u201313,000 per year during \n2003\u20132007. The traffic accident rate for access-controlled highways is much lower than that for \naccess-free  roads.  The  development  of  high-design-standard  expressways  is  expected  to \nimprove road safety. Expressway network development will address these issues efficiently. \n \n8.  The GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway will be connected with the existing Nanning\u2013\nYouyiguan Expressway in GZAR at the Huu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan border. The GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong \nCai Expressway will be connected with the planned Fangcheng\u2013Dongxing Expressway in GZAR \nat the Mong Cai\u2013Dongxing border. The demand for international freight traffic along these \ncorridors is  high.  However,  the  current  slow  and cumbersome  border  crossing  operations, \nincluding the need for transshipment between Vietnamese and Chinese trucks at these borders, \nare bottlenecks to international trade. It takes at least 3 days to forward cargo from Nanning to \nHa Noi by truck. Transport facilitation measures provided for under the GMS cross-border \ntransport agreement (CBTA), which has been ratified by the governments of Viet Nam and the \nPRC, will help remove these impediments and further boost two-way trade between Viet Nam \nand GZAR.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

The socioeconomic development plan of the Government of Viet Nam6 recognizes the \n(cid:31)F\nimportance  of  regional  cooperation  and  integration  in  the  attainment  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  and  Viet  Nam\u2019s  development  goals.  Border  provinces  are  among  the \npoorest areas in the country, and, as such, their development is significantly influenced by Viet \nNam\u2019s  neighbors,  i.e.,  Cambodia,  the  PRC,  and  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic. \nIntraregional trade and investments have also played an important role in accelerating the pace \nof  economic  growth  in  Viet  Nam.  Viet  Nam  has  been  actively  participating  in  regional \ncooperation  and  integration  initiatives.

ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n11.  In  its  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020),11 ADB  focuses  its \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\noperation  on  infrastructure,  and  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  ADB  invests  in \ninfrastructure  to  improve  transport  and  communication  connectivity  within  and  between \ndeveloping member  countries,  and  in  addition  to  building  physical  assets,  ADB  intends  to \n(i) build  developing  member  countries\u2019  capacity  for  better  infrastructure  management,  (ii) \npromote  institutional  and  policy  reforms  that  enhance  the  operational  efficiency  and \nsustainability of infrastructure projects, and (iii) support logistical systems to increase trade and \ninvestment  by  building  on  basic  infrastructure  strengths  and  developing  opportunities  from \npolicy and institutional reforms. Also, under the strategy, ADB promotes a larger role for the \nprivate sector in financing infrastructure, either as a project sponsor or an institutional bond or \n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2005.

Available: http://www.acmecs.org \n8  Development Triangle Initiative is a high-priority, multisectoral initiative to promote further economic cooperation \nand reduce poverty in border areas of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam where the \npoverty density is higher. The Prime Ministers of the three countries confirmed their commitment for the initiative in \nJanuary 2002.  \n9  The initiative is a regional development plan between PRC and Viet Nam that jointly develops two economic \ncorridors (i.e., Kunming\u2013Ha Noi and Nanning\u2013Ha Noi) between the two countries. \n10 The Forum, which was held in Beihai, Guangxi, PRC on 30 July 2008, represented the newest opportunity for \nsubregional cooperation in East Asia. The specific focus was on promoting subregional cooperation in the Pan-\nBeibu Gulf, covering Southern coastal provinces of PRC, Viet Nam and the oceanic countries of the ASEAN \nincluding Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. Promoting trade and investment and \nbuilding infrastructure connectivity were identified as initial priorities. \n11 ADB. 2008.

ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) 2007\u20132010 for Viet Nam12 aims to help the \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  reduce  poverty  to  10%\u201311%  by  2010,  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s socioeconomic development plan (footnote 6), through (i) pro-poor business-led \neconomic growth, (ii) social equity and balanced development, and (iii) environmental protection \nand management. The CSP emphasizes the creation of an enabling environment for private \nsector operations and improvement of links between the public and private sectors. It also \npromotes  good  governance  in  its  operations  and  places  a  high  priority  on  contributing  to \nregional  cooperation.  The  CSP  recognizes  the  need  for  accelerated  improvements  in \ninfrastructure, particularly energy and transportation, and in human resource development in \nlight of the expected strong expansion of the Vietnamese economy. The proposed TA Loan \nProject and associated TA grants are in line with the strategic priorities of the Viet Nam CSP, \nand were included in the 2008 programs of lending products and nonlending products and \nservices during the country programming confirmation mission in January 2008. \n \n13.  Greater synergy between the socioeconomic development plan and the GMS economic \ncooperation program is an operational thrust of the CSP for Viet Nam. The GMS program\u2019s \nstrategic priorities of enhancing connectivity, improving competitiveness, and promoting a sense \nof  community  (the  \"3Cs\")  are  expected  to  continue  serving  as  the  framework  for  regional \ncooperation activities in Viet Nam. ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and program for the \nGMS13 aims to help achieve the GMS vision of an integrated, harmonious, and prosperous \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nsubregion through the pursuit of the 3Cs, and the proposed GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha \nLong\u2013Mong  Cai  expressway  projects  will  help  achieve  this.  The  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son \nExpressway Project is a key section of the GMS eastern corridor, which is one of nine corridors \nidentified under the GMS TSSS (Map 2). The GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project \nforms part of the Nanning\u2013Dongxing\u2013Mong Cai\u2013Ha Long\u2013Ha Noi road corridor, which is a \npriority  GMS  project  identified  under  the  TSSS.  Both  corridors  were  identified  by  GZAR \nauthorities as priority cross-border road links when GZAR became part of the GMS in early \n2005. \n \n  3.  Lessons  \n \n14.  Expressway  projects  requiring  a  substantial  amount  of  investment  involve  a  long \npreconstruction  phase  in  order  to  undertake  a  technical  feasibility  study,  the  alignment \ndetermination  process,  detailed  designs  of  expressways  and  their  associated  facilities, \nprocurement,  social  and  environmental  safeguard  planning  and  implementation,  financial \narrangements,  and  consultation  with  project  stakeholders.  ADB  has  provided  project \npreparatory TA to carry out a project technical feasibility study, and started processing TA and \ninvestment loans for the project after the project technical feasibility was confirmed. For the \nGMS Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway Project,14 the prefeasibility study started in 2003 under an ADB-\n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nfinanced TA grant. After the prefeasibility was confirmed, the project detailed design study\u2014\nincluding  economic  and  financial  assessment,  detailed  designs,  social  and  environmental \nsafeguard plans, and procurement assistance\u2014was implemented from 2005 to 2007 under the \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2006.

Attaching project preparatory TA for project feasibility \nto  the  TA  Loan  Project  for  project  detailed  design  is  an  effective  way  to  shorten  the \npreconstruction phase.  \n \n15.  Alignment and locations of expressways, interchanges, and their associated facilities are \na major concern for project provinces and districts as well as people living in the project area. \nCost for the civil works, the number of project-affected households, the area of residential and \nagricultural land  to  be  acquired,  and  environmental  impacts  depend  upon  the  expressway \nalignment. For the GMS Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway Project, MOT held meetings with project \nprovincial governments on the highway alignment in order to start preparing the detailed design \nand resettlement plan. However, changes in the alignment were often requested by the project \nprovinces. This resulted in a prolonged detailed design study and an increase in the consulting \nservices cost. Consultation with project stakeholders by MOT in the early stage is required to \nfacilitate the alignment determination process.  \n \n  4.  External Assistance \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s interventions in the modern expressway and highway subsector started in 2005 \n(Appendix 4), when it provided technical assistance for developing a modern expressway and \nhighway network. The TA for the Expressway Network Development Plan Project (footnote 1) \n(cid:31)H\nprovided (i) a business plan setting out an institutional, organizational, and financial structure \nthat would allow VEC to successfully implement the expressway program; (ii) a long-term \nmaster  plan  for  the  expressway  network,  including  a  detailed  plan  for  expressways  to  be \ndeveloped during 2006\u20132015; and (iii) a detailed economic and financial viability assessment of \npriority expressway links, as well as a financing plan for these links. Moreover, loans for the Noi \nBai\u2013Lao  Cai  Highway  TA  Project  (footnote  15)  and  the  HCMC\u2013Long  Thanh\u2013Dau  Giay \nExpressway TA Project16 provide for (i) detailed engineering designs, (ii) detailed economic and \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nfinancial studies, (iii) detailed social and environmental studies, (iv) procurement assistance for \ncivil works, and (v) VEC\u2019s capacity development. Investment loans for the GMS Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai \nHighway Project (footnote 14) were approved in 2007. With other development partners, ADB \ncontinues to technically and financially support expressway network development in Viet Nam. \nThe Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the World Bank are planning to \nfinancially assist construction of expressways in the central and southern regions of Viet Nam. \nFurthermore,  private  sector  funds  have  been  used  for  construction  of  urban  expressways \ntogether with residential area development along the expressways.   \n \n17.  The ADB TA project (footnote 1) identified the following issues with VEC that must be \n(cid:31)H\naddressed: (i) strengthening of the organizational structure, (ii) development of a legal and \nregulatory  framework,  (iii)  staff  training,  and  (iv)  development  of  a  financial  and  asset \nmanagement system (Appendix 3). ADB is supporting capacity building and strengthening of \nVEC in order to facilitate the change from an SOE to an independent infrastructure provider \nunder the HCMC\u2013Long Thanh\u2013Dau Giay Expressway TA Project (footnote 16). The expected \noutputs will include (i) preparation of a revised organizational structure, (ii) identification of legal \nand  regulatory  constraints  to  VEC,  (iii)  training  needs  assessment,  (iv)  capacity  building \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2005.

The World Bank has provided a PPP study17 to assist MOT in formulating a strategy for \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ndevelopment  of  PPPs  in  the  road  sector,  which  includes  (i)  identifying  an  institutional \narrangement for management and regulation of PPPs; (ii) preparing a policy framework for \nprivate sector participation in toll roads; and (iii) through training and hands-on assistance, \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  MOT  and  VEC  in  development  and  management  of  PPP \noperations. The study has developed several PPP contracting models for different levels of \nprivate sector participation. The PPP contracting models for the lower level of private sector \nparticipation  are  contract-out  and  concession  of  the  operation  and  maintenance  works  of \nexpressways. The PPP contracting models for the higher level of private sector participation are \nexpressway construction and operation by public\u2013private joint companies, and expressway \nbuild\u2013operate\u2013transfer  concession  by  private  companies.  The  decision  support  model  for \nselection of the appropriate PPP model has been developed based on the ability to apply user \ntolls, the size and scope of the project, the extent of required risk transfer to the private sector, \nand the bankability of the project. The World Bank intends to use PPPs for its future expressway \nprojects.  This  financing  modality  will  be  studied,  among  others,  for  the  three  expressway \nprojects. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The  ensuing  expressway  projects  will  construct  (i)  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son \nExpressway  (about  120  km),  which  will  be  connected  to  the  existing  Nanning\u2013Youyiguan \nExpressway in GZAR; (ii) the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway (about 120 km), which will \nbe connected to the existing Nanning\u2013Fangcheng Expressway and the Fangcheng\u2013Dongxing \nhighway in GZAR; and (iii) the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway (about 60 km), which will form \npart of the outer ring road of the HCMC urban expressway, and be an access link with the \nplanned HCMC\u2013Vung Tau Expressway. The outcome of the TA Loan Project is the design of \nthe ensuing expressway projects agreed to by the Government of Viet Nam, VEC, ADB, and \ncofinanciers. \n \n20.  The expected impact of the TA Loan Project is the achievement of efficient movement of \ngoods and people between northeastern Viet Nam and GZAR, and within the greater HCMC \narea, through construction of the three expressways. International and local traffic will be able to \nuse an efficient, safe, and reliable express route from Ha Noi to the border with the PRC \nthrough  the  completion  of  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  GMS  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai \nexpressways. Connectivity of cities and towns around HCMC will be improved and the cost and \ntravel times for the movement of passengers and goods in and around HCMC will be reduced \nthrough completion of the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway. Ultimately, the TA Loan Project \nwill contribute to sustainable economic growth and enhanced economic exchange between Viet \nNam and the PRC, and promote socioeconomic development in the project-influenced areas. \n \nB.  Outputs \n21.  The  associated  TA  projects  will  undertake  technical  feasibility  studies  for  the  three \nexpressways. Outputs from the TA Loan Project will include completion of preconstruction \n                                                 \n17  World Bank. 2008.

Cost for land acquisition and resettlement will not be funded from the TA Loan Project. \nThe ensuing loans are tentatively planned for ADB Board approval as follows: for the Ben Luc\u2013\nLong Thanh Expressway Project in 2010, for the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway Project in \n2011, and for the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project in 2012.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n22.  Proposed  TA  for  preparing  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai \nexpressway projects, and proposed TA for preparing the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway \nProject will be attached to the TA Loan Project. These associated TA projects will carry out \ntechnical feasibility studies for the three expressways. Based on the draft final report on the \ntechnical feasibility study for each expressway project, the Government of Viet Nam, VEC, and \nADB will confirm whether the technical feasibility of each expressway project is satisfactory as a \ncondition to the commencement of detailed engineering studies under the TA Loan Project. The \nensuing investment loans for construction of the three expressways will be processed by using \noutputs of the associated TA projects and the TA Loan Project. \n \n23.  The project costs for construction of the three expressways are estimated at between \n$800 million and $1 billion each. Given the large financing requirements, cofinancing for each of \nthe projects will be explored. To date, JBIC has agreed in principle to cofinance the Ben Luc\u2013\nLong  Thanh  Expressway  Project,  and  the  Korea  Eximbank  has  expressed  interest  in \ncofinancing the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway Project. Cofinanciers for the GMS Ha \nLong\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project need to be identified. Private sector financing possibilities \nsupported by ADB guarantees will be explored, possibly building on ongoing study by the World \nBank on PPPs in the Viet Nam road sector (footnote 17). \n(cid:31)H\n \n24.  A memorandum of understanding between Viet Nam and the PRC was signed in March \n2008 by vice-ministers of transport of the two countries to include the Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son corridor \nand the Huu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan border crossings in the scope of the GMS CBTA. The CBTA is a \nmultilateral  instrument  for  the  facilitation  of  cross-border  transport  of  goods  and  people. \nFormulated under the auspices of a series of ADB technical assistance projects, the CBTA \nprovides a practical approach to streamlining regulations and reducing nonphysical barriers in \nthe GMS. It covers key aspects of cross-border transport facilitation in one document, including \n(i) single-stop single-window customs inspection; (ii) cross-border movement of persons (i.e., \nvisas  for  persons  engaged  in  transport  operations);  (iii)  transit  traffic  regimes,  including \nexemptions  from  physical  customs  inspection,  bond  deposit,  escort,  and  agriculture  and \nveterinary inspection; (iv) requirements that road vehicles will have to meet to be eligible for \ncross-border traffic status; (v) exchange of commercial traffic rights; and (vi) infrastructure, \nincluding road and bridge design standards, road signs, and signals. When the CBTA between \nthe  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  enters  into  force,  i.e.,  when  both  governments  ratify  the  CBTA\u2019s \nimplementing guidelines, key transport facilitation provisions mentioned above will have to be \nimplemented, and the current exchange of traffic rights arrangements that is limited to the \nborder areas will have to be expanded to cover the entire Nanning\u2013Ha Noi corridor. \n \n ", "9 \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n25.  The TA Loan Project is estimated to cost $30.8 million equivalent, including local taxes \n(Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are in Appendix 5. \nADB will finance the base cost for the consulting services, and will not finance compensation \nand allowances for the project-affected persons. All financing charges are to be capitalized. \nVEC  will  finance  all  local  taxes  imposed  on  the  consulting  services.  The  local  taxes  are \nestimated at approximately 20% of the base cost, consisting of 10% for value-added taxes, 5% \nfor corporate income taxes, and approximately 5% for personal income taxes.

The Government has requested a loan equivalent to $26.0 million from the Special \nFunds resources of ADB to help finance the TA Loan Project. The loan will be denominated in \nspecial drawing rights with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \ncharge of 3.15% per annum during the life of the loan, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements.  \n \n27.  The ADB loan will finance 84% of the total project cost (Table 2). The remaining cost \n($4.8 million) will be financed by VEC. The Borrower of ADB\u2019s loan will be the Government of \nViet Nam. The entire loan proceeds will be relent. VEC will borrow the loans from the Ministry of \nFinance through subsidiary loan agreements, on terms acceptable to ADB and at ADB\u2019s interest \nrate applicable to the loans, plus a relending fee pursuant to the borrower\u2019s regulations. \n \n28.  An additional $1.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program \nto undertake TA for preparing the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai expressway \nprojects (para. 41), and another additional $1.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, to undertake TA for preparing the \n ", "10 \nBen Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project (para. 42).

VEC will have overall \nresponsibility for project implementation and formal correspondence with the line ministries, Ha \nNoi  City,  HCMC,  provincial  governments,  and  ADB.  VEC  will  set  up  a  new  project \nimplementation unit no. 3 (PIU3) for the TA Loan Project, which will comprise a qualified project \ndirector  and  suitable  staff.  The  PIU3  will  have  responsibility  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation. To enhance knowledge sharing and improve job efficiency, PIU3 will coordinate \nwith other VEC staff in the Business Planning Department, Technical Department (including \nenvironmental unit and social and resettlement unit), Finance and Accounting Department, as \nwell as the existing project implementing units of other projects. VEC will engage and direct the \nwork of consultants for (i) the project design including (a) detailed design study and its related \nstudies,  (b)  update  of  the  resettlement  plans,  EMDPs  (or  EMSAs),  EIAs,  and  EMPs,  (c) \nassistance  in  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works,  and  (d)  implementation  of  the  land \nacquisition and resettlement; (ii) appraisal of the detailed designs; and (iii) external monitoring of \nthe land acquisition and resettlement activities.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n30.  The TA Loan Project will be implemented over 4.5 years for commencement in January \n2009 and completion in June 2013. The overall implementation schedule for the TA Loan \nProject is presented in Appendix 6. The ensuing investment loans are tentatively programmed \nfor ADB Board approval as follows: for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project in 2010, \nfor the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway Project in 2011, and for the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong \nCai Expressway Project  in 2012.  \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n31.  For each expressway project, four types of consulting services will be carried out before \nand  during  processing  of  the  ensuing  investment  loan.  First,  project  feasibility  consulting \nservices to be funded by the associated TA grants will prepare engineering, economic, financial, \nsocial, and environmental feasibility studies. Second, project design consulting services to be \nfunded by the TA loan will (i) prepare detailed designs; (ii) update resettlement plans, EMDPs \n(or EMSAs), EIAs, and EMPs based on the detailed designs; and (iii) assist in the procurement \nof  civil  works  and  the  implementation  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Third,  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s internal procedures, detailed design appraisal consulting \nservices to be funded by the TA loan will review the detailed designs and project cost estimates \n ", "11 \nprepared by the project design consulting services. Fourth, external resettlement monitoring \nconsulting services to be funded by the TA loan will monitor land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities. \n \n32.

VEC  will  undertake  three  consulting  services  for  each  of  the  three \nexpressways under the TA Loan Project: (i) the project design study, (ii) the detailed design \nappraisal  study;  and  (iii)  the  external  resettlement  monitoring.  All  consulting  firms  will  be \nselected in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n(i)  VEC will recruit international consulting firms for the project design study following \nthe QCBS procedure. The quality\u2013cost ratio is 80:20. The outline of the consulting \nservices for the project design study is in Appendix 10. The project design study will \n(a) undertake detailed engineering designs for the expressways and their associated \nfacilities; (b) update resettlement plans, EMDPs (or EMSAs), EIAs, and EMPs, taking \ninto  account  detailed  engineering  designs;  (c)  prepare  bidding  documents  for \nprocurement of goods and civil works and assist VEC in undertaking procurement of \nthe goods and civil works; and (d) assist in the implementation of the resettlement \nplans prior to commencement of civil works. The consulting services contract period \nwill last 13 months from November 2009 to November 2010 for the Ben Luc\u2013Long \nThanh Expressway, last for 13 months from April 2010 to April 2011 for the GMS Ha \nNoi\u2013Lang Son Expressway, and last for 14 months from April 2011 to May 2012 for \nthe GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway. It is envisaged that about 422 person-\nmonths of international experts and about 1,030 person-months of national experts \nwill be required for the project design study of the three expressways. \n(ii)  VEC will select international consulting firms for the detailed design appraisal study. \nThe QCBS procedure will be used for the consulting services, cost of which is \nestimated at $200,000 or higher, and the quality\u2013cost ratio is 80:20. The consultants\u2019 \nqualifications selection (CQS) procedure will be used for the consulting services, cost \nof which is estimated below $200,000. The outline of the consulting services for the \ndetailed design appraisal study is in Appendix 11. Prior to procurement of the civil \nworks,  the  detailed  design  appraisal  study  will  review  detailed  designs  of  the \nexpressways and their associated facilities and cost estimates for the projects in line \nwith the Government\u2019s regulations. A period of 2 months is required to appraise the \ndetailed designs for each expressway. The consulting services contract period will \nstart in September 2010 for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway, start in February \n2011 for the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway, and start in March 2012 for the \nGMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway. It is envisaged that about 30 person-months \n ", "12 \nof international experts and about 42 person-months of national experts will be \nrequired for the detailed design appraisal study for the three expressway projects.  \n(iii)  VEC will also recruit national consulting firms to undertake the external resettlement \nmonitoring. The QCBS procedure will be used for the consulting services, cost of \nwhich is estimated at $200,000 or higher, and the quality\u2013cost ratio is 80:20. The \nCQS procedure will be used for the consulting services, cost of which is estimated \nbelow $200,000. The terms of reference for the external resettlement monitoring \nconsulting  services  will  be  developed  in  the  resettlement  plans,  which  will  be \nprepared under the project feasibility study. \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  VEC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and the project- \nrelated records and accounts of all consultants and other service providers. \n \n35.  To ensure transparency and good governance, VEC will publicly disclose on its website \ninformation on how loan proceeds are being used. For each procurement contract, VEC will \ndisclose (i) the list of participating consultants, (ii) the name of the winning consultant, (iii) basic \ndetails on consultant selection procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract awarded, \n(v) the list of goods and/or services purchased, and (vi) the intended and actual utilization of \nloan proceeds under each contract. VEC will also disclose details of resettlement reports on its \nwebsite, which will be updated within 2 weeks of each contract being awarded. Also, VEC will \nsubmit quarterly internal and external resettlement monitoring reports to ADB. The resettlement \nreports will be uploaded onto VEC\u2019s website within 2 weeks of their submission. Moreover, the \nGovernment will ensure that all of VEC\u2019s project staff are fully aware of, and comply with, the \nGovernment\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  procedures,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  procedures \nfor implementation, procurement, use of consultants, disbursement, reporting, monitoring, and \nprevention of fraud and corruption. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n36.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed directly to the consultants based on \nan approved contract under the direct payment procedure.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n37.  VEC will maintain separate financial records and accounts adequate to identify financing \nresources received and project expenditure, including consulting services and the local taxes \nimposed on the consulting services financed out of the loan proceeds and local funds. The loan \naccounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound \nauditing standards by an auditor acceptable to ADB. VEC will submit annual audited reports and \nrelated financial statements to ADB within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. The audit \n ", "13 \nopinion will include (i) a detailed description of the source of funds and expenditures made, \n(ii) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal controls systems with respect to \nproject expenditure and other financial transactions in order to ensure safe custody of project-\nfinanced assets, and (iii) confirmation of compliance with loan covenants. \n \n38.  PIU3, on behalf of VEC, will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress \nof  project  implementation.  It  will  monitor  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation schedule, and will keep ADB informed through quarterly progress reports of any \nsignificant deviations from the schedule. The quarterly reports will summarize information in \ndetailed  project  reports,  including  basic  data  related  to  the  Project,  utilization  of  funds, \nachievement of immediate development objectives, implementation progress, environmental \nmanagement and monitoring, land acquisition and resettlement progress, compliance with loan \ncovenants, and major issues and problems. Within 3 months of completion of the Project, VEC \nthrough PIU3 will submit through VEC a project completion report to ADB, which will provide a \ndetailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs,  performance  of  the  consultants,  the \nperformance indicators, social impacts, and such other details as may be requested by ADB. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n39.  VEC, assisted by the project feasibility and design consultants, will establish baseline \ndata for the performance indicators and targets for evaluating project performance in relation to \nimpacts, outcomes, and outputs of the expressway projects. The performance indicators and \ntargets will be again measured 6 months and 3 years after completion of the construction of \neach expressway, and compared to the baseline data to identify the project benefits.  \n \n8.  Project Review \n40.  Regular reviews will be carried out semiannually so that ADB fact-finding and appraisal \nmissions for processing of the ensuing investment loans can utilize outputs of the consulting \nservices,  and  approval  of  the  ensuing  investment  loans  in  the  programmed  year  may  be \nensured. A project completion review mission will be fielded about 1 year after completion of the \nTA Loan Project. There will also be special reviews as required to address issues that arise \nduring project implementation. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n41.  Proposed TA of $1.5 million for preparing the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013\nMong Cai expressway projects, to be funded on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund, is attached to the TA Loan Project. A summary of the proposed TA is provided in \nAppendix 7. These expressways will be important routes connecting the northern region of Viet \nNam with GZAR in the PRC. The TA will therefore give special emphasis to cross-border \naspects, including transport and trade facilitation, competitiveness and complementarities of \nfreight transportation from a multimodal perspective, and development of cross-border tourism \nbetween northern Viet Nam and GZAR. The TA will determine the general alignment of the \nGMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway, taking engineering difficulty, construction cost, economic \nimpacts, and social and environmental impacts into consideration. The engineering, economic, \nfinancial, social, and environmental studies will be carried out based on the general alignment. \nAn EIA, EMP, resettlement plan, and EMDP (or EMSA) for construction of the GMS Ha Noi\u2013\nLang Son Expressway will be prepared. The TA will also undertake a prefeasibility study on the \nGMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project in order to assess its economic and financial \nviability. \n ", "14 \n42.  Proposed TA of $1.5 million for preparing the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project, \nto be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, \nwill be attached to the TA Loan Project. A summary of the proposed TA is provided in Appendix \n8.  The  TA  scope  covers  a  feasibility  study  for  the  whole  outer  ring  of  the  HCMC  Urban \nExpressway and access to the HCMC\u2013Vung Tau Expressway, as the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh \nExpressway is an important link of these expressways. The engineering, economic, financial, \nsocial, and environmental studies will be carried out based on the planned alignment. An EIA, \nEMP, resettlement plan, and EMDP (or EMSA) for construction of the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh \nExpressway will be prepared. Two bridges, or river tunnels, need to be constructed across the \nNha Be and Long Tau rivers. These rivers are used as navigation channels for large cargo ships \naccessing the HCMC river port. Therefore, if bridges are selected, long-spanned bridges with \n50\u201360 m navigational clearance will be needed. An engineering study to determine the river \ncrossing structures is included in the scope. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n43.  This project preparatory TA package, combining the project feasibility study and project \ndesign study, will help the Government and VEC ensure economic and financial viability of the \nlarge-scale  infrastructure  projects,  and  mitigate  social  and  environmental  risks  caused  by \nimplementation of the projects. Moreover, compared to the standard processing scheme, which \nprovides a TA loan for project design study after TA for the project feasibility study is completed, \nthe physical works would be able to commence more than 1 year earlier. In Viet Nam, project \nexecuting agencies cannot start consultant recruitment actions before the project loans are \napproved.  Under  this  project  preparatory  TA  package,  ADB  will  take  advance  contracting \nactions for the consulting services on the project feasibility study to be funded by the associated \nTA grants, and VEC will start consultant recruitment for the project design study to be funded by \nthe TA loan after ADB approves the TA Loan Project with the associated TA grants.  \n \n44.  The main risk for the TA Loan Project is implementation delay caused by project internal \nand external factors. The consultant selection process is a potential cause for implementation \ndelay. VEC will start selection of the consultant for the project design study immediately after \napproval of the TA Loan Project. The decision-making process on the expressway alignments is \nanother potential cause for implementation delay. The consultants for the project feasibility \nstudy will propose expressway alignments based on engineering difficulty, construction cost, \nand social and environmental impacts. MOT and VEC will have consultation meetings on the \nexpressway  alignments  with  representatives  from  the  project  provinces,  districts,  and \ncommunes. The general alignment should be determined before the detailed design study \nstarts. \n \n45.  Social. Since the TA Loan Project is a project preparatory TA for the expressway \nprojects, it will not cause any adverse social impacts. The resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpact categories for the TA Loan Project are classified as category C. However, construction of \nthe  expressways  (under  the  ensuing  project  loans)  will  require  significant  involuntary \nresettlement, including relocation of houses and loss of agricultural and residential land. The \ngeneral expressway alignments will be provided under the associated TA projects, paying \nattention  to  potential  negative  social  impacts.  The  associated  TA  projects  will  prepare  a \nresettlement plan, and an EMDP (or an EMSA) for each expressway project, and the TA Loan \nProject will assist VEC in updating these (based on the detailed design of the expressways) and \nimplementing the updated plans. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the TA \nLoan Project is provided in Appendix 12. \n \n ", "15 \n46.  Environment. Since the TA Loan Project is project preparatory TA for the expressway \nprojects, it will not cause any adverse environmental impacts. The environmental category for \nthe TA Loan Project is classified as category C. The environmental impacts will be mitigated by \nthe careful determination of expressway alignments under the associated TA projects and the \nTA Loan Project by avoiding environmentally sensitive areas, and developing environmentally \nfriendly highway designs. The associated TA grants will prepare an EIA and an EMP for each \nexpressway project, and the TA Loan Project will update these based on the detailed designs of \nthe expressways. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n47.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  VEC  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Borrower will cause VEC to ensure that the detailed design study services and \nother services to be provided under the TA Loan Project for any of the expressways \ndo not commence until the feasibility study conducted under the associated TA \nprojects for the relevant expressway has been completed to the satisfaction of the \nGovernment, VEC, and ADB.  \n(ii)  The Borrower will ensure that VEC updates the EIAs, including the EMPs, taking into \naccount the detailed engineering design for the expressways in accordance with the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).

The Borrower will also ensure that \n(a)  specific  provisions  are  included  in  the  civil  works  and  consulting  services \ncontracts for the implementation of the EMPs and their monitoring, and (b) budget \nallowances are made for the implementation of these provisions. \n(iii)  The Borrower will ensure that VEC updates the resettlement plans and the EMDPs \nor EMSAs, as may be applicable, for the construction of the expressways and related \nfacilities and activities in accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and \ntaking into account the final detailed engineering designs. The Borrower will further \nensure that VEC submits the updated resettlement plans and EMDPs or EMSAs to \nADB for approval, and that the updated resettlement plans and EMDPs or EMSAs \nare disclosed to the affected persons prior to submission to ADB. \n(iv)  The Borrower will ensure that (a) affected persons are compensated at replacement \ncost and assisted before they are displaced from their houses, land, and assets; and \n(b) that no affected persons are displaced until suitable alternative land within the \nsame or a neighboring commune has been allocated to them or compensation has \nbeen paid that is sufficient to purchase suitable alternative land within the same or a \nneighboring commune. \n(v)  If, at any time after a resettlement plan has been approved or updated, significant \nrealignment of any part of the expressway is required, the Borrower will revise and \nupdate that resettlement plan to take into account the realignment. The updated \nresettlement plan will be updated in accordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement \n ", "16 \nPolicy  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to  commencement  of  any  land \nacquisition activities for the realigned part of the relevant expressway. Significant \nrealignment  occurs  when  the  previously  approved  alignment  is  moved  entirely \noutside the construction corridor of the previous design by a distance greater than \n100 meters, or the impact of the realignment increases the number of affected \npersons by more than 10%. \n(vi)  The Borrower will ensure that VEC contracts an external monitoring agency (EMA) \nfor independent monitoring and evaluation of resettlement activities and that the \nEMA\u2019s monitoring reports be uploaded onto VEC\u2019s website. The Borrower will ensure \nthat VEC submits copies of the EMA\u2019s monitoring reports to ADB every quarter until \nresettlement and income restoration programs are complete. \n(vii)  During the TA loan project implementation, VEC will have in place sound financial \nmanagement,  financial  reporting,  internal  controls,  and  internal  auditing  systems \nacceptable to ADB. \n(viii)  The Borrower will take all actions which will be necessary to enable VEC to perform \nits obligations under the Project Agreement, and will not take or permit any action \nwhich would interfere with the performance of such obligations. \n(ix)  The Borrower will exercise its rights under the subsidiary agreements in such a \nmanner as to protect the interests of the Borrower and ADB and accomplish the \npurpose of the loan. No rights or obligations under the subsidiary loan agreement will \nbe assigned, amended, abrogated, or waived without the prior concurrence of ADB. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n48.  In addition to the standard conditions for loan effectiveness, the following are conditions \nfor loan effectiveness that are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  VEC will have established a PIU3 for the TA Loan Project headed by a qualified \ndirector and suitably staffed. \n(ii)  The subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and VEC will have been \nexecuted and be binding on the parties. \n(iii)  The Government will have approved TA letters for preparing the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang \nSon and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai expressway projects, and for preparing the Ben Luc\u2013\nLong Thanh Expressway Project. \n \nVII.   RECOMMENDATION \n49.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16,616,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son, GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai, \nand  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh  Expressways  Technical  Assistance  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 3.15% per annum during the life of the \nloan; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n    President \n \n1 October 2008 \n ", "  Appendix 1  17 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nEfficient movement of goods  \u2022 Completion of the Ben Luc\u2013 \u2022 ADB\u2019s surveys on travel  \u2022 Transport projects \nand people between  Long Thanh Expressway by  times and costs of  related to the three \nnortheastern Viet Nam and  2013, the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang  transport between Ha Noi  expressways are \nGZAR, and within the  Son Expressway by 2014,  and Nanning, and  completed on time \ngreater HCMC area, through  and the GMS Ha Long\u2013 between Ha Long and  \u2022 Stakeholders, \nconstruction of the three  Mong Cai Expressway by  Nanning  including project-\nexpressways  2015  \u2022 Trade and tourism  affected households, \n  \u2022 Travel time and costs  statistical yearbooks of  do not oppose the \nreduced by at least 50% for  Viet Nam and GZAR, and  expressway projects \nHa Noi\u2013Nanning and Ha  border trade and tourism  \u2022 VEC has adequate \nLong\u2013Nanning, and by 80%  data at the Huu Nghi\u2013 capacity in managing \nfor east\u2013west traffic in the  Youyiguan and Mong Cai\u2013 the construction of the \nsouthern HCMC area  Dongxing border crossings  expressway projects \n\u2022 Border crossing time  \u2022 Traffic accident reports  \u2022 Key provisions of the \nreduced at Huu Nghi\u2013 issued by the national  GMS CBTA related to \nYouyiguan for cargo by 90%  government and the  facilitation of frontier \nand goods by 50%; and at  project provinces  crossing formalities \nMong Cai\u2013Dongxing for  \u2022 ADB\u2019s surveys on traffic  and the exchange of \ncargo and goods by 50%  volume, travel time,  traffic rights \n\u2022 Traffic accidents reduced by  origin\u2013destination of trips  arrangements are \n20% on the Ha Noi\u2013Lang  in the HCMC area  implemented between \nSon route and by 80% on  the PRC and Viet \nthe Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai route  Nam \n\u2022 By 2016, cross-border trade   \nand tourism between Viet \nNam and GZAR increased \nby at least 50% \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nDesigns of the three  \u2022 Agreement on project  \u2022 Project review missions  \u2022 Government priorities \nexpressway projects agreed  designs for the Ben Luc\u2013 and country programming  and agreements on \nby the Government of Viet  Long Thanh Expressway by  missions  projects\u2019 designs \nNam, VEC, ADB, and  2010, the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang  \u2022 Meetings with the  remain the same \ncofinanciers  Son Expressway by 2011,  Government of Viet Nam,  \u2022 Funding sources for \nand the GMS Ha Long\u2013 VEC, and cofinanciers  the three expressway \nMong Cai Expressway by    projects are identified \n2012    \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.

Overview \n \n1.  The  Third  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Summit  in  Vientiane  in  March  2008 \nreaffirmed the importance of strengthening infrastructure connectivity among the GMS countries \nin achieving the GMS vision of an integrated, harmonious, and prosperous subregion. In their \njoint declaration, the heads of governments of the six GMS countries called for accelerating the \nconstruction and improvement of the remaining sections of GMS corridors, and expanding the \ncorridor network through multimodal linkages. They endorsed the Vientiane Plan of Action for \nGMS Development (2008\u20132012), which includes the high-priority projects and programs in the \nnine sectors of GMS cooperation. Items under the Vientiane Plan of Action in the transport \nsector were derived from the GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study (TSSS, see Box A2) and \nagreed by the GMS Transport Forum. The GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai \nexpressway projects are included in the Vientiane Plan of Action. The two expressway projects \nare also high-priority initiatives under the Two Corridors\u2013One Economic Ring initiative1 and the \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nPan-Beibu Gulf Cooperation Forum.2 \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nBox A2: Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector Strategy (2006\u20132015) \nThe GMS Transport Sector Strategy was formulated under the auspices of Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional \ntechnical assistance, and endorsed by the six GMS governments in May 2006. It provides a subregional framework \nthat is implemented through individual national transport strategies and action plans in the six GMS countries. These \nstrategies and action plans are supported to varying degrees with sector policy statements, strategies, objectives, \npriorities, and individual project analyses. Although there are many regional and subregional cooperation groupings \ninvolved in transport in GMS countries, the GMS transport sector strategy is endorsed at the highest levels of \nleadership in the six governments. This has provided the GMS with a leading role in coordinating and implementing \npriority subregional projects and initiatives. \nFormulation of the GMS transport sector strategy for the period to 2015 took account of the need for the following: \n(i)   sectoral focus that identifies factors critical to intraregional and transit trade and improved competitiveness (e.g., \nmissing links in the transport network and critical common needs such as maintenance, logistics, and multimodal \nintegration) and that are complementary to interregional and global trade;  \n(ii)  a comprehensive inter-sectoral strategy that identifies major socioeconomic trends and developments, and \ndetermines  and  prioritizes  transport  initiatives  that  respond  to  these  needs;  and  that  is  a  subset  of  a \ncomprehensive  GMS  development  plan,  and  encompasses  country  and  regional  transport  and  related \ndevelopment strategies; and \n(iii)  goal setting and a results-oriented management plan that identifies key goals of economic integration and \nregional cooperation for 2015 and beyond, and sets performance indicators and prioritizes GMS transport \ninitiatives to best realize these goals, e.g., the GMS as a \u201cgrowth bridge\u201d between the PRC and India, capitalizing \non the strategic location of the GMS, and the realization of Millennium Development Goals.  \nThe GMS Transport Sector Strategy identified five overarching goals for transport: (i) to exploit synergies in the GMS \ntransport system; (ii) to move towards an open market for transport services; (iii) to facilitate economic efficiency to \nreduce transport costs; (iv) to complete the GMS network and improve links with South Asia; and (v) to encourage \nmulti-modalism. \nSource: ADB. 2007.

Trade between Viet Nam and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region \n \n3.  The PRC is an important trade counterpart of Viet Nam. Table A2.1 shows the value of \nexports and imports of Viet Nam in the first 11 months of 2007. The PRC is the largest source of \nimports of Viet Nam based on value, and the third largest destination of Viet Nam\u2019s exports. Viet \nNam\u2019s total two-way trade with the PRC is estimated to have reached $15 billion in 2007. Viet \nNam exports rubber (24.8% of the total amount), coal (19.9%), crude oil (7.6%), wood product \n(5.2%), and computers, electrical goods, and components (3.5%) to the PRC, and imports steel \n(18.4%), machinery equipment and parts (18.1%), fertilizer (4.6%), computers, electrical goods, \nand components (4.2%), and petroleum (4.2%) from the PRC. \n \nTable A2.1: Exports and Imports of Viet Nam in the First 11 Months of 2007 \n($ million) \nExports    Imports \nUnited States  9,171  People\u2019s Republic of China  10,751 \nJapan  5,415  Singapore  6,608 \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China   2,981  Taipei,China  6,119 \nAustralia  2,898  Japan  5,404 \nSingapore  1,953  Republic of Korea  4,680 \nWorld Total  43,695  World Total  54,483 \nSource: General Department of Custom. \n \n4.  As shown in Table A2.2, total exports from GZAR to Viet Nam rose from $454 million to \n$1.4 billion during the 3 years from 2004 to 2007, and imports rose from almost $300 million to \nover $950 million during the same period. In total, the GZAR\u2013Viet Nam trade value increased to \n$2.4 billion in 2007, which accounted for 16% of the value of two-way trade between the PRC \nand Viet Nam. Border trade is estimated to account for $1.5 billion of the total two-way trade \nbetween GZAR and Viet Nam.  \n \n                                                 \n3    ADB.  2006.

Major seaports are located in Hai Phong in Viet Nam, and Fangcheng, Qinzhou, and \nBeihai in GZAR. There are four class I highways border ports at Mong Cai\u2013Dongxing, Huu \nNghi\u2013Youyiguan, Phuc Hoa\u2013Shuikou, and Hang Pao\u2013Long Ban, and one railway border port at \nHuu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan. Items transported from GZAR to Viet Nam are steel, chemical industrial \nproducts, and metal products; items transported from Viet Nam to GZAR are iron ore, minerals, \nand coal. Ocean transport is a major transport mode between Viet Nam and GZAR in terms of \ncargo volume, and it accounts for about 58% of the total volume. The share of road transport is \n33%  and  of  railway  transport  9%.  GZAR  mostly  exports  fruit,  textiles,  medicines,  garlic, \nelectronics, mung beans, and construction materials to Viet Nam through land transport routes. \nIts imports from Viet Nam include rubber, starch, fresh longan, iron ore, coal, cashews, and \ndried litchi.  \n \n6.  Border  trade,  which  has  increased  steadily  in  recent  years,  has  helped  stimulate \nsocioeconomic development in the border areas. Food processing companies in GZAR have \nlarge demand for cassava. They can provide expertise in terms of agricultural technology to Viet \nNam, and contract farming arrangements with Viet Nam are being established. There are \ncontracted sugar plantations in Viet Nam, the outputs of which are transported back to GZAR. \nAgroprocessing areas for flour and cornstarch are found in Viet Nam. Chongzou City in GZAR \nat the border with Viet Nam is famous for producing high-quality sugar. GZAR is in talks with \nViet Nam to establish contract farming arrangements for Chinese herb plantations. GZAR can \nhelp in improving the access of less-developed areas in northeastern Viet Nam to private \ncapital, agricultural and industrial technology, and managerial and entrepreneurial skills.  \n \n7.  GZAR, which permanently hosts an expo between the PRC and the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Nanning, is a gateway for PRC\u2013ASEAN trade, which is \n ", "22  Appendix 2 \nexpected to expand rapidly with the implementation of the PRC\u2013ASEAN free trade agreement.4 \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nFor the ninth year in a row, ASEAN was the top trading partner of GZAR, with total two-way \ntrade reaching almost $3 billion in 2007. The low standard of infrastructure in neighboring \ncountries has been cited by GZAR authorities as a key constraint in further increasing trade and \ntourism between these countries and GZAR. A logistics park has been established in Pingxiang, \nGZAR, which included the establishment of e-ports that will provide a platform to enhance \nefficiency in customs clearing operations. Viet Nam and GZAR have agreed to establish a \ncross-border cooperation zone and industrial park at the Pingxiang\u2013Lang Son border area. \n \nC.  Cross-Border Road and Railway Infrastructure between Viet Nam and Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region \n \n8.  GZAR has two of the three trunk highways connecting the PRC with Viet Nam. One \nhighway is from Nanning to Ha Noi via Pingxiang and Lang Son, a distance of 419 kilometers \n(km). The distance from the border to Lang Son is 18 km and to Ha Noi 130 km. A four-lane \nexpressway from Nanning to Youyiguan, partly financed by an ADB loan,5 was opened to traffic \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nin December 2005, and will connect to the proposed Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway. Another \nhighway connects Nanning to Ha Noi via Dongxing and Mong Cai, a distance of 538 km. A six-\nlane  expressway  from  Nanning  to  the  seaports  of  Fangcheng,  Quinzhou,  and  Beihai  was \ncompleted in 1997. A four-lane class I highway from Fangcheng to Dongxing was opened to \ntraffic at the end of 2005. A new four-lane Fangcheng\u2013Dongxing expressway, which will be \nconnected to the proposed Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway, will be completed in 2011.  \n \n9.  Cross-border highway traffic in the last 3 years is set out in Table A2.3. The number of \ncross-border passengers reached 4.4 million in 2007, with an average compounded annual \ngrowth rate of 7.7%. Highway freight transport volume, after a sharp rise in 2003, continued to \ndecline. Statistics on cross-border passenger and freight traffic handled in GZAR are set out in \nTable A2.4. Currently, GZAR has four class I border-crossing highway ports and seven class II \nhighway ports. Among the four class I highway ports in GZAR, Dongxing highway port took \nabout 84% of total cross-border passengers in 2007, and Pingxiang and Dongxing highway \nports account for 62% of the total cross-border freight volume.   \n \n                                                 \n4  ASEAN. 2007.

Railway freight transport between \nGZAR and Viet Nam has recorded a sharp increase since 2000. In 2007, major commodities \nexported to Viet Nam by rail included steel materials, chemical products, and metal products. \nSteel materials amounted to 0.3 million t with an annual increase of 130.0%, chemical products \n0.1 million t with an annual increase of 44.5%, and metal products 0.07 million t with an annual \nincrease of 12.7%.

While road transport still has a larger share than railway transport, the volume and share \nof railway transport has been increasing. This indicates that the trading volume of bulky cargos \nsuch as steel materials, chemical products, and metal products has been expanding. It is \nunlikely that these bulk cargos will be diverted to road transport. Road transport remains a \ndominant transport mode for time-sensitive cargos such as fresh vegetable, fruits, seafood, \nprocessed food (chilled and refrigerated), everyday items, consumer electronics, machine parts, \nand other manufactured goods. It is observed that the decrease in freight volume by road \ntransport is related to slow customs control and necessary transshipment at the borders.  \n \n \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nD.  Tourism Development \n \n12.  Tourism in Guangxi grew rapidly in 2007, with the number of tourists in GZAR increasing \nby 11.5% to 85.5 million domestic tourists and by 25.4% to 2 million international tourists per \nyear from 2006. Total income from tourism expanded by 20% in 2007, reaching CNY44.6 billion \n($6.6 billion), equivalent to 7% of GDP in GZAR. Viet Nam is a key contributor to the rapid \ngrowth of international tourism for GZAR. There are partnerships between Viet Nam and GZAR \nto mutually promote tourism. In 2007, tourist numbers from Viet Nam were 231,800, or an \nannual  increase  of  19.3%.  The  daily  international  passenger  traffic  at  the  border  gate  in \nDongxing is about 10,000, of which tourists amounted to 3,000. The remaining 7,000 persons \ncrossing the Dongxing\u2013Mong Cai border are engaged in cross-border trade. \n \n13.  In 2007, 559,000 Chinese tourists visited Viet Nam\u2014an annual increase of 8.2%. The \nWorld Heritage Site of Ha Long Bay in Viet Nam is a popular destination among Chinese \ntourists.  The  Quang  Ninh  provincial  government  prepared  a  master  plan  for  economic \ndevelopment, which targets revenues from tourism to reach D3 trillion ($188 million) by 2010 \nand D5 trillion ($313 million) by 2020. To achieve this, the provincial government is planning to \ndevelop four tourism areas, which include Ha Long Bay and Van Don island. Van Don island is \none the poorest areas in the province, but has abundant mangroves and beautiful scenery. The \nproposed GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway is planned to traverse Van Don island, and an \ninternational airport will be constructed on the island to help encourage ecotourism in the area. \n \nE.  Cross-Border Transport Facilitation in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n \n14.  The  GMS  governments  have  recognized  that  providing  subregional  physical \ninfrastructure is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for increased connectivity among the \nsix GMS countries. Mitigating nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and \npeople is important to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and maximize the economic benefits of \nimproved subregional transport infrastructure. Nonphysical barriers impeding the free movement \nof  vehicles,  goods,  and  people  across  international  borders  in  the  subregion  include \n(i) restrictions  on  the  entry  of  motor  vehicles,  often  causing  costly  and  time-consuming \ntransshipment;  (ii)  different  standards  pertaining  to  vehicle  size,  weight,  and  safety \nrequirements,  and  driver  qualifications;  (iii)  inconsistent  and  difficult  formalities  related  to \ncustoms procedures, inspections, clearances, and assessment of duties; (iv) restrictive visa \nrequirements;  and  (v)  inadequate  border  crossing  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Bilateral \nagreements on cross-border movement exist between many GMS members. These agreements, \nhowever,  only  partly  address  critical  cross-border  facilitation  issues,  and  hinder  transit \nmovement  of  vehicles,  goods,  and  people  to  third  countries.  In  addition,  the  bilateral \nagreements existing among pairs of GMS countries are not necessarily consistent with each \nother and run the risk of having gaps and overlaps, thereby making transport facilitation even \nmore difficult. Therefore, a multilateral framework to facilitate the cross-border movement of \ngoods and people on a subregion-wide and consistent basis is necessary to allow for both \ninterstate and transit traffic. \n \n15.  To mitigate nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and people in \nthe  GMS,  the  six  countries  have  negotiated,  signed,  and  ratified  a  cross-border  transport \nagreement (CBTA). The GMS CBTA is a multilateral instrument for the facilitation of cross-\nborder transport of goods and people. Formulated under the auspices of a series of ADB \ntechnical  assistance  projects,  the  CBTA  provides  a  practical  approach  to  streamlining \nregulations and reducing nonphysical barriers in the GMS. It incorporates the principles of \nbilateral or multilateral actions, and flexibility in recognition of differences in procedures in each \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nof the GMS countries. The implementing guidelines of the CBTA have all been signed, and are \nexpected to be ratified in 2008. Full implementation of the CBTA is expected to commence in \n2010.  \n \n16.   The CBTA covers all the relevant aspects of cross-border transport facilitation in one \ndocument. These include (i) single-stop single-window customs inspection; (ii) cross-border \nmovement of persons (i.e., visas for persons engaged in transport operations); (iii) transit traffic \nregimes, including exemptions from physical customs inspection, bond deposit, escort, and \nagriculture and veterinary inspection; (iv) requirements that road vehicles will have to meet to be \neligible  for  cross-border  traffic  status;  (v)  exchange  of  commercial  traffic  rights;  and  (vi) \ninfrastructure, including road and bridge design standards, road signs, and signals. The CBTA \nwill apply to selected and mutually agreed upon routes and points of entry and exit in the \nsignatory countries. A memorandum of understanding between Viet Nam and the PRC was \nsigned in March 2008 by vice-ministers of transport of the two countries to include the Ha Noi\u2013\nLang Son corridor and the Huu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan border crossings in the scope of the CBTA. \n \n17.   A  bilateral  road  transport  agreement  between  Viet  Nam  and  the  PRC  is  in  effect \nbetween the two countries, but its scope limits access for trucks in one country to only the \nborder areas of the other country. Likewise, the costs incurred and time to clear the border \ncheckpoint account for a significant portion of the total transport cost and time. When the CBTA \nenters into force between the PRC and Viet Nam, i.e., when both governments ratify the CBTA\u2019s \nimplementing  guidelines,  key  transport  facilitation  provisions  mentioned  above  will  be \nimplemented, and the current exchange of traffic rights arrangements that is limited to the \nborder areas will be expanded to cover the entire Nanning\u2013Ha Noi corridor. \n \n \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \nROAD SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Road Asset and Road Traffic Conditions \n \n1.  The total length of Viet Nam\u2019s road system is approximately 210,000 kilometers (km), \nincluding 17,300 km of national roads, 17,450 km of provincial roads, 36,400 km of district roads, \n7,000 km of urban roads, and 131,500 km of rural roads. Out of the national road length, 83.5% \nis paved. National roads are the country\u2019s most important lifelines, but in 2004 only 44.8% of the \ntotal length was in good condition. The national road system is mainly of two-lane construction. \n \n2.  The economy of Viet Nam has been growing rapidly, with gross domestic product (GDP) \nrising at an average annual rate of 7.5% during 2001\u20132005, and it is expected to grow at an \naverage annual rate of 10% up to 2010. Development of transport infrastructure is essential to \nachieve the rapid economic growth. Table A3.1 shows the transport sector road map. The shift \nfrom motorcycles to passenger cars is happening in urban areas. When the shift happens \nnationwide, the national road system as it stands will not be able to accommodate traffic \ndemand. Thus, construction of expressway networks throughout the country should start as \nsoon as possible.  \n \nTable A3.1: Viet Nam Transport Sector Road Map \n \nIndicators  2006  2010  2015  2020 \nA.

Expressway Master Plan \n \n3.  In general, car ownership rapidly increases when GDP per capita is approaching $1,000. \nAccording to the China Statistical Yearbook,1 the ratio of car ownership to the total population \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nwas 0.86% in 1995, when GDP per capita was $1,040, and reached 2.42% in 2005 when GDP \nper capita was $3,160. Car ownership almost tripled in proportion to growth of GDP per capita \nduring the 10-year period. It is estimated that GDP per capita in Viet Nam will exceed $1,000 in \n2010 and a rapid increase in car ownership will then be seen in Viet Nam. \n \n4.  Road traffic is concentrated on national roads and around major urban centers. Rising \nlevels of motorization are a major challenge to transport planners and policy makers, especially \nin large urban areas and on primary intercity roads. The Government has started to undertake \ndevelopment of high-quality highways, designed for operating speeds which exceed current \nnational-road levels\u2014i.e., expressways. On the basis of preliminary economic and financial \nappraisals and rationalization, the expressway construction programs shown in Table A3.2 were \n                                                 \n1 China Statistics Bureau. 2008.

By 2015, construction of about 2,000 km expressways will have commenced in the \nnorthern region around Ha Noi, the southern region around Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and in \nthe central region of Viet Nam, and 500 km of expressway will be opened to public traffic.   \n \nTable A3.2: Expressway Network Development Plan \n \nLength  Estimated Cost \nTerm \n(km)  ($ million) \nShort term (2006\u20132015)  1,968  11,556 \nMedium term (2016\u20132025)     875     5,238 \nLong term (2026\u2013onwards)  1,969  10,804 \nTotal  4,812  27,598 \nNote: Estimated cost is based on 2007 prices. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC.  Vietnam Expressway Corporation \n \n5.  The  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC)  was  established  in  October  2004  to \ndevelop expressways in Viet Nam. It is a fully state-owned enterprise (SOE) under the Ministry \nof Transport (MOT). VEC\u2019s headquarters are in Ha Noi and there is a single branch office in \nHCMC. VEC\u2019s charter capital is D1,000 billion (about $62 million). The Ministry of Finance has \nreleased D50 billion to VEC but the remaining capital has been provided in-kind by granting \nVEC toll collection rights for the Cau Gie and Phu Dong toll plazas for 10 years, starting 1 \nJanuary  2005.  By  31  December  2005,  VEC\u2019s  total  funds  were  D281.4  billion,  of  which \nD152.4 billion had been released by the Ministry of Finance\u2014in addition to the D50 billion \nallocation provided on the establishment of VEC\u2014and a further D79 billion from toll collection \nrevenues.    \n \n6.  Article 4 of VEC\u2019s charter sets out the following areas in which VEC is to operate: \n \n(i)  investment  in  expressway  construction,  management,  maintenance,  and \norganizing toll collection on national expressways; \n(ii)  investment in construction of other transport infrastructure by different modalities; \n(iii)  provision and operation of roadside facilities along expressways, such as rest \nhouses, restaurants, filling stations, advertisements, and provision of construction \nmaterials; \n(iv)  transport  engineering  consultancy,  including  studying  national  expressway \nnetwork development, preparing prefeasibility studies and feasibility studies, and \ndesigning and supervising transport infrastructure construction works; and \n(v)  development of roadside facilities adjacent to expressways. \n \nThe immediate objective for VEC was to prepare an expressway master plan and complete \npreparations for the construction of new expressways based on the expressway master plan. \nVEC also has to identify and employ a large number of technically qualified staff to implement \nits activities. \n \n7.  Under Asian Development Bank-funded technical assistance (TA) project,2 a review was \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nundertaken  of  (i)  government  policies,  laws,  regulations,  decrees,  circulars,  and  charters \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2005.

This study identified a number \nof issues that must be addressed, these issues are presented below. \n \n1.  Organizational Structure \n \n8.  VEC was established with an organizational structure intended for the start-up phase. As \nof  January  2007,  VEC  was  implementing  two  construction  projects  and  had  management \nsystems in place for these. However, present tolling operations are limited to two toll plazas; it \ndoes not have any expressway operating and maintenance contracts in place; it is not providing \nany additional support activities to expressways, such as roadside facilities; and processes to \nenable public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) have not been put in place. Further, VEC has limited \ncapacity to manage the social and environmental impacts of the expressways. To administer \nthe proposed expressway programs, VEC needs to expand its capacity to enable it to manage a \nnumber of large, complex projects and to take on new activities in terms of additional skills. \nVEC was established as a fully owned SOE under MOT, however the Law on State Enterprises \nrequires all SOEs to be converted into a company operating under the Law on Enterprises \nbefore 2010. These demands require revision of the organizational structure. With funding from \nADB,  an  expressway  network  development  plan  report  was  prepared  that  recommends \nrevisions to the organizational framework, but these recommendations need to be refined for \nimplementation. \n \n9.  VEC has established a project management team to manage implementation of the \nADB-funded Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway Project.3 VEC is strengthening the environmental unit \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nand the social and resettlement unit within its technical department to provide overall guidance \non environmental, social and resettlement matters, coordinating closely with MOT and the local \nauthorities. The project management team, comprising a headquarters office in Ha Noi and four \nfield offices in Vinh Phuc, Phu Tho, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai provinces, has responsibility for day-\nto-day  project  implementation.  The  field  offices  coordinate  with  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees  and  district  people\u2019s  committees  on  civil  works,  environmental  management, \nimplementation of the land acquisition and resettlement activities, and livelihood development \nand income restoration program. \n \n2.  Legal and Regulatory Framework \n \n10.  The TA project undertook a review of legal and regulatory documents that apply to \nexpressways. This study identified a number of issues that need to be addressed either through \nclarifications to existing laws or regulations or through new laws or regulations. Of particular \nconcern is Circular 90, covering toll regimes for roads. As presently formulated, this circular is \nvery restrictive in terms of ceilings on toll rates, which may have consequences for the financial \nviability of some expressways. The TA also recommended how this circular could be revised to \naccommodate more flexible toll arrangements. \n \n11.  There is a need to improve the legal and regulatory environment for private sector \ninvestment in the transport sector. Although there is a generic PPP law, this is not tailored to the \nspecific requirements of road sector PPPs. Further, existing road sector laws do not provide a \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

Manila (Loan 2391-VIE and Loan 2392-VIE). \n ", "  Appendix 3  29 \ncomprehensive framework for PPPs. Initiating and attracting private investor interest to road \nsector PPPs depends on a comprehensive policy; such a policy is absent in Viet Nam. The \nWorld Bank-funded study on PPP in the road sector4 is presently in progress. This study \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nobjective is to assist MOT to formulate a strategy for development of the road sector with PPPs, \nand the preparation of a policy framework for private sector participation in toll roads. \n \n3.  Training Needs \n \n12.  As of August 2006, VEC employed 96 staff, most of whom (79%) have university or \npostgraduate degrees in transport-related subjects. Given that VEC is a new organization, \nmany staff require training to fully engage in their roles and responsibilities. VEC plans to train \nstaff in the future through technical courses on financial management and engineering design, \nmaking  use  of  courses  at  both  domestic  and  overseas  universities  and  colleges.  The \nExpressway Network Development Plan TA undertook an initial assessment of training needs, \nbut the proposed program needs to be completed once work on the revised organizational \nstructure has been completed. \n \n4.  Financial and Asset Management Systems \n \n13.  VEC is currently operating using standard accounting software to record all financial \ntransactions. However, a financial management system is needed to allow data to be accessed \nand analyzed to meet needs other than formal financial reporting. The Expressway Network \nDevelopment Plan TA also identified a need for an asset management system. \n \nD.  Traffic Accidents and Road Safety \n \n14.  Fatalities and injuries rapidly increased in the late 1990s. This increase stopped in 2002, \nand the number of traffic accident injuries has substantially declined since then. However, traffic \naccident fatalities are still 12,000\u201313,000 per year from 2003 to 2007. Construction of high-\nquality design standard highways is effective in improving road safety. Improvement of National \nHighway  No. 1  (NH1)  started  in  1994  and  completed  in  2006  under  official  development \nassistance projects5 funded by ADB and other development partners. NH1 generally has a four-\n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nlane  access-controlled  structure  in  urban  and  suburban  areas  and  two-lane  access-free \nstructure in rural areas. Table A3.3 shows traffic accident data on NH1 during the period from \n2003 to 2006, in which the highway improvement was completed in many sections of NH1. It \nwas found that the number of traffic accidents has reduced drastically, from 399 in 2003 to 68 in \n2006, and the number of fatalities and injuries in 2006 was one-fifth of 2003 levels.  \n \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2008.

Cost and Time Required for Cross-Border Operation \n \n15.   Estimates of the transport costs and time for a shipment of one full truckload of steel \nweighing  30  tons  from  Nanning  to  Ha  Noi  were  made  under  an  ADB-assisted  logistics \ndevelopment study for the GMS north\u2013south economic corridor.6 Travel time from Nanning to \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nHa  Noi  was  37  hours  in  2000,  and  19  hours  in  2006,  when  the  Nanning\u2013Youyiguang \nExpressway was open to the public traffic, and is expected to be 8 hours in 2015 when the GMS \ncross-border transport agreement (CBTA) is fully implemented. Table A3.4 shows that the costs \nof crossing the border accounted for 48% of total transport costs in 2006, and that the time it \ntook to clear the border checkpoints accounts for 37% of the total transport time of 19 hours. It \nalso shows the potential reduction in costs and time for border crossing clearance if the CBTA is \nimplemented  along  the  Nanning\u2013Ha  Noi  corridor.  Figures  A3.1  and  A3.2  are  graphic \nrepresentations of the actual (2000 and 2006) and simulated (2015) transport costs and time in \ntraversing the Nanning\u2013Ha Noi corridor. \n \nTable A3.4: Cost and Time Breakdown for Nanning\u2013Ha Noi Transport \n \nTransport Cost  Transport Time \nTransport  Travel  Port/Border  Transport  Port/Border \nCost  Cost  and Transit  Time  Travel Time  Crossing \nYear  ($/ton)  (%)  Fees (%)  (hours)  (%)  Time (%) \n2000  37  51  49  37  64  36 \n2006  27  52  48  19  63  37 \n2015    9  72  28    8  87  13 \nSource:  ADB.  2007.

Transport and trade companies in Nanning have many complaints about long clearance \ntimes, including customs clearance and waiting time for cargo transshipment with unloading and \nloading on the Vietnamese side. One of the logistics companies mentioned that at least 3 days \nis required to transport cargo from Nanning to Ha Noi, although the travel time from Nanning to \nHa Noi without the cross-border procedure is estimated at only 5 hours. It is estimated that more \nthan 2 days are spent for clearances and transshipment at the border. The transport and trade \ncompanies in Nanning have a strong desire for cross-border facilitation and transshipment \nfacilities for unloading and loading in Viet Nam to be developed as soon as possible. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007.

During  the  Country  Programming  Confirmation  Mission  for  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) 2008 program for Viet Nam in Ha Noi in January 2008, the Government of Viet \nNam requested ADB for technical assistance (TA) for the preparation of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai  expressway  projects.  In  the \nmemorandum of understanding between the Government of Viet Nam and ADB, it was agreed \nthat the TA would be included in the ADB nonlending program for 2008. A mission visited Viet \nNam on 17\u201329 April 2008 and held initial discussions with the Government on the proposed TA. \nAgreements were reached on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and outline terms of reference for the TA consultants.1  \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n \nB.  Issues \n \n2.  The GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway is proposed to be constructed parallel to \nNational  Highway  (NH)  1,  which  was  upgraded  under  the  ADB-assisted  Second  Road \nImprovement Project,2 as well as to the single-track railway in northern Viet Nam leading to the \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR). It forms part of the GMS Eastern Corridor (Map \n2), which was identified under the GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study (TSSS)3 as one of \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nnine transport corridors, which runs from Nanning in GZAR to Ha Noi. Along the proposed \nexpressway route, in Bac Ninh and Bac Giang provinces traffic is considerable, while in Lang \nSon province it is low. It currently takes 3 hours to drive from Ha Noi to the border town of Dong \nDang  in  Lang  Son  province.  Cross-border  trade  between  GZAR  and  Viet  Nam  has  been \nexpanding at about 4% per year. However, cargo transported by trucks peaked in 2003 and has \nbeen declining since then. It is observed that the decrease in truck freight is related to slow \ncustoms control and necessary transshipment at the borders. On both sides of the border posts, \nmany trucks stand by for customs clearance of cargos. This expressway, which will link with the \nADB-assisted  expressway  from  Nanning,  the  capital  of  GZAR,  to  the  border  town  of \nYouyiguan,4 combined with streamlining of cross-border operations, is expected to boost cross-\n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nborder trade between Viet Nam and GZAR. There is only one passenger train that operates \ndaily, as passenger traffic appears to have shifted to the improved NH1. On average, eight \nfreight trains run per week, transporting mainly heavy materials and products such as ore and \nsteel. It is less likely, therefore, that there will be a modal shift arising from the construction of \nthe GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway.  \n \n3.  NH18 runs along the northern coast from Ha Long to Mong Cai, through Mong Duong. It \nis identified as a priority GMS transport project under the TSSS. The distance between Ha Long \nand Mong Cai is about 200 km. NH18 has four lanes in city areas and two lanes in other places \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 May 2008. \n2  ADB. 1996.

The objective of the GMS transport sector strategy study is to establish a well-built, seamless, multimodal \nsubregional transport network that will contribute significantly to fully connecting the GMS. It was endorsed by the \nGMS governments in May 2007.  \n4  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Guangxi Road Development Project. Manila (Loan 1851-PRC). The project was \ncompleted on 31 January 2008. \n ", "38  Appendix 7 \nand is generally in good condition, except for a 10\u201320 km section from Mong Cai, which is in \npoor condition. NH18 is being used as a heavy freight route, with an estimated 500 truck-trailers \ndaily carrying 40-foot maritime containers. The containers arrive at Hai Phong port in northern \nViet Nam and are immediately transported to GZAR. Passenger bus services are available, but \nthere is no railway service. The geometric alignment of NH18 is within acceptable standards, \nbut curve radius and lane widths are considered too sharp and narrow for truck-trailers. The \nroad has high traffic accident rates. It also has many short bridges, which have a load limit of 13 \ntons (t) and are unable to support truck-trailers carrying 40-foot maritime containers. In this \nregard,  a  new  highway  of  acceptable  design  standards  should  be  considered  in  order  to \nimprove road safety in the influence area of NH18, as well as to maintain the road assets of \nNH18. The use of NH18 as a long-term freight route, however, remains uncertain, and, as such, \nit  is  important  to  carry  out  transport  and  trade  analyses,  survey  related  infrastructure \ndevelopment in the influence area, and carry out traffic flow assessment between Viet Nam and \nGZAR along this highway.  \n \n4.  A key constraint to the efficient transnational movement of goods and people between \nViet Nam and GZAR is nonphysical and nontariff barriers that are caused by the lack of \nharmonized  and  streamlined  rules  and  regulations  for  cross-border  traffic.  These  include \n(i) restrictions  on  the  entry  of  motor  vehicles,  often  causing  costly  and  time-consuming \ntransshipment;  (ii)  different  standards  pertaining  to  vehicle  size,  weight,  and  safety \nrequirements,  and  driver  qualifications;  (iii)  inconsistent  and  difficult  formalities  related  to \ncustoms procedures, inspections, clearances, and assessment of duties; (iv) restrictive visa \nrequirements; and (v) inadequate border crossing infrastructure and facilities. A bilateral road \ntransport agreement between Viet Nam and the PRC is in effect between the two countries, but \nits scope limits access for trucks in one country to only the border areas of the other country. \nLikewise,  the  costs  incurred  and  time  taken  to  clear  the  border  checkpoint  account  for  a \nsignificant portion of the total transport cost and time. Estimates of the transport costs and time \nfor a shipment of one full truckload of steel weighing 30 t from Nanning to Ha Noi were made \nunder  an  ADB-assisted  logistics  development  study  for  the  GMS  north\u2013south  economic \ncorridor.5 They showed that the costs of crossing the border account for 48% of total transport \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\ncosts of about $27/t, and that the time it takes to clear the border checkpoints accounts for 37% \nof the total transport time of 19 hours.  \n \n5.  To mitigate nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and people in \nthe  GMS,  the  six  countries  have  negotiated,  signed,  and  ratified  a  cross-border  transport \nagreement (CBTA). The implementing guidelines of the CBTA have all been signed, and are \nexpected to be ratified in 2008. A memorandum of understanding between Viet Nam and the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) was signed in March 2008 by vice-ministers of transport of \nthe two countries to include the Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son corridor and the Huu Nghi\u2013Youyiguan border \ncrossings in the scope of the CBTA. When the CBTA between Viet Nam and the PRC enters \ninto force, i.e., when both governments ratify the CBTA\u2019s implementing guidelines, key transport \nfacilitation provisions of the CBTA will be implemented, and the scope of the existing bilateral \nroad transport agreement will be expanded to cover the entire Ha Noi\u2013Nanning corridor.  \n \n6.  Both expressway projects are likely to have significant adverse environmental impact \nthat is sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented, and affects an area broader than the sites or \nfacilities where the physical works will be carried out. An environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) for each project will be prepared. Both expressway projects will require a large amount of \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.

A full resettlement plan for each project will be prepared. For \nthe GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway Project, ethnic minority groups account for a large part \nof the population in the project area. In Lang Son province, ethnic minority people account for \n86% of the population, and in Bac Giang province they account for 12%. Ethnic minority people \nare likely to be affected by the Project because of land acquisition and resettlement. For the \nGMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project, the major ethnic groups account for 95% of the \npopulation in Quang Ninh province, and the percentage of the ethnic minority people is low. \nHowever, in some of the mountainous districts crossed by the different project options, the \npercentage of ethnic minority people is much higher (75% in Ba Che and 42% in Tien Yen). If \nimpacts on the ethnic minorities living in the project areas are significant, an ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan (EMDP) will be prepared to address the concerns of the ethnic minorities. \nThe two expressway projects will increase the inter-border traffic between the PRC and Viet \nNam, which could also increase the risk of the spread of HIV as well as the risk of human \ntrafficking. \n \n7.  The Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) was established in October 2004, as a \nstate-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Transport (MOT), with responsibility for planning, \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  expressway  network  in  the  country.  In \naccordance  with  the  expressway  master  plan,  VEC  is  implementing  several  expressway \nprojects so that the total length of expressways open to the public traffic may reach 500 km by \n2015.  Also,  VEC  is  expected  to  transform  from  a  state-owned  enterprise  to  a  financially \nautonomous infrastructure provider. ADB provides its loan funds for expressway construction \nand has also been supporting VEC\u2019s capacity building on expressway planning, legal and \nregulatory framework, corporate financing management, business development plans, project \nimplementation  management,  safeguard  planning  and  implementation,  operation  and \nmaintenance of expressways, asset management, and private sector involvement. \n \nC.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The expected impact of the TA is efficient transnational movement of goods and people \nbetween Viet Nam and GZAR through the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai \nexpressway projects. Together with a network of expressways linking Ha Noi and Kunming, and \nKunming and Nanning, the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressways will \ncomplete an \u201ceconomic triangle\u201d connecting key development centers in Viet Nam and the PRC. \nThis economic triangle in the northeastern part of the GMS will support the GMS program\u2019s \nstrategic objectives of enhanced connectivity, competitiveness, and community in the GMS. \n \n9.  Together with detailed design studies to be carried out under the associated TA loan \nproject,  the  TA  will  result  in  the  identification  of  economically,  technically,  socially,  and \nenvironmentally feasible expressway projects that will link northeastern Viet Nam with GZAR, \nwhich will be agreed by the Government of Viet Nam, VEC, and ADB. Under the TA, technical \nfeasibility  analyses  and  assessments  will  be  carried  out,  including  (i)  expressway  general \nalignment, (ii) cost-effective project design, (iii) evaluation of economic feasibility and financial \nviability, and (iv) social and environmental viability for the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013\nMong Cai expressway projects.  \n \nD.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Given the strong regional dimensions of the two expressway projects, the TA will give \nspecial  emphasis  to  cross-border  aspects,  including  transport  and  trade  facilitation, \ncompetitiveness and complementarities of freight transportation from a multimodal perspective, \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \nand development of cross-border tourism between northern Viet Nam and GZAR. The TA will \nundertake a feasibility study on the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway Project. The general \nalignment of the expressway will be determined, taking appropriate consideration of social and \nenvironmental impacts and cost-effectiveness. The engineering, economic, financial, social, and \nenvironmental studies will be carried out based on the general alignment. The TA will also \nundertake a prefeasibility study on the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project to assess \nits economic and financial viability. \n \n11.  The expected outputs of the TA will include rationale (sector performance, problems, \nand opportunities), design and monitoring frameworks (impact, outcome, outputs, and inputs), \nspecific features, cost estimates, benefits and impacts, assumptions and risks, economic and \nfinancial feasibility assessment, environmental impact assessments, resettlement plans, EMDPs \nor ethnic minority specific actions (EMSAs), gender action plans, and HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking prevention programs for the two expressway projects. The consulting services will be \nundertaken  so  that  processing  of  the  investment  loan  for  the  GMS  Ha  Noi\u2013Lang  Son \nExpressway Project may be completed by 2011, and processing of the investment loan for the \nGMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project may be completed by 2012.  \n \nE.

In the memorandum of understanding between the Government of \nViet Nam and ADB, it was agreed that the TA would be included in the ADB nonlending \nprogram for 2008. A mission visited Viet Nam on 17\u201329 April 2008 and held initial discussions \nwith the Government on the proposed TA. Agreements were reached on the impact, outcome, \noutputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of \nreference for the TA consultants.1  \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\n \nB.  Issues \n \n2.  Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the largest city in Viet Nam and the country\u2019s economic \nhub, with a population (including both the permanent and the transient population) forecast to \ngrow by 2.1% yearly from the current 7.9 million to 10.3 million by 2020. The volume of trade \nthrough HCMC\u2019s port grew by more than 15% in value in 2006. With economic growth expected \nto continue in the medium term, and households earning higher incomes, many more families \nwill be able to buy cars and the number of journeys undertaken will significantly increase. \nAlready, the roads within and around HCMC are becoming heavily congested, travel speeds are \ndropping, and transport costs are rising. There is an urgent need to provide relief to the city \nroads connecting the center of HCMC and the port area with the suburbs to the city, and, farther \nout, to the roads leading north from the city to central and northern Viet Nam. In the southern \narea of HCMC, east\u2013west traffic is restricted due to lack of bridges and tunnels across the Nha \nBe River and its tributary streams in the Mekong Delta. Goods and people are forced to travel \nby way of the center of HCMC, and this raises concerns about traffic levels in the city center. \n \n3.  As part of development planning for HCMC, several master plans have been prepared to \ndeal with the needs of specific sectors. A transport master plan was prepared in 2004, with \nassistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency.2 This plan was later consolidated \n(cid:31)(cid:31)F\nwith a second master plan prepared by the People\u2019s Committee of Ho Chi Minh City and work \ndone  by  the  Ministry  of  Transport\u2019s  Technical  Engineering  and  Design  Institute.  This \nconsolidated transport master plan, approved by the Government in January 2007, sets out a \n$26 billion investment program up to 2020. The Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh section is included in the \nprogram. \n \n4.  The 60-km Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway will be a southern link of the outer ring of \nHCMC urban expressway as well as a short link of the north\u2013south expressway in Viet Nam. It \nwill be connected to the planned HCMC\u2013Vung Tau Expressway, which forms part of the GMS \nsouthern economic corridor route from Bangkok to Phnom Penh, HCMC, and Vung Tau. Due to \nthe lack of river bridges and tunnels in the southern area of HCMC, the proposed expressway \nwill have significant impacts on socioeconomic activities in the cities and towns around HCMC. \nThe proposed feasibility study will cover the whole outer ring expressway of HCMC, as well as \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 May 2008. \n2  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2004.

Two  bridges,  or  river  tunnels,  need  to  be \nconstructed across the Nha Be and Long Tau rivers, which are used as navigation channels for \nlarge cargo ships accessing the HCMC river port. If bridges are selected, these will have to be \nlong-spanned, cable-suspension bridges with a 50\u201360 meter (m) navigational clearance. \n \n5.  The Project is located north of the Can Gio protected area. The Can Gio mangrove \necosystem  has  been  recognized  as  an  international  biosphere  reserve  by  United  Nations \nEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2000. Even if the proposed \nalignment is outside of the protected area, wetlands with mangroves could be present along the \nalignment. Terrestrial ecology field surveys will be conducted with a focus on species presence, \ndistribution,  and  condition  in  mangrove  ecosystems.  The  proposed  expressway  will  link  to \nProvincial Road 15 (currently being rehabilitated), which goes through the Can Gio mangrove \nforest. Linkage with the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway is expected to increase the number \nof visitors in the protected area and lead to high pressure on land development in this area. The \neastern part of the expressway crosses lowland terrain with an altitude of 0\u20131 m. This area is a \nsunken, low delta with alum soil, and could be inundated by tidal movements. The Project is \nlikely  to  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impact  that  is  sensitive,  diverse,  or \nunprecedented, and affects an area broader than the sites or facilities where the physical works \nwill be carried out.  \n \nC.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The expected impact of the TA is efficient movement of goods and people in the greater \nHCMC area through the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway. The expressway will strengthen \nconnectivity in the cities and towns around HCMC, and will provide an efficient, safe, and \nreliable express route in HCMC and its outskirt areas. It will also help reduce road traffic \nconcerns in the greater HCMC area, such as traffic congestion, accidents, and noise and air \npollution. \n \n7.  Together with detailed design studies to be carried out under the associated TA Loan \nProject, the TA will result in the identification of an economically, technically, socially, and \nenvironmentally feasible expressway project, which will be agreed by the Government of Viet \nNam, the Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC), and ADB. Under the TA, technical feasibility \nanalyses and assessments will be carried out, including (i) expressway alignment, (ii) cost-\neffective project design, (iii) evaluation of economic feasibility and financial viability, and (iv) \nsocial and environmental viability for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project. The TA will \nalso help strengthen the capacity of VEC as the executing agency for the ensuing expressway \nprojects. \n \nD.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA scope covers technical feasibility study for the whole outer ring of the HCMC \nurban expressway, and access to the HCMC\u2013Vung Tau Expressway. General alignment of the \nBen Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway will be determined, taking into consideration social and \nenvironmental impacts and cost-effectiveness. The engineering, economic, financial, social, and \nenvironmental studies will be carried out based on the general alignment. Moreover, two bridges \nor river tunnels need to be constructed across the Nha Be and Long Tau rivers. These rivers are \nused  as  navigation  channels  for  large  cargo  ships  accessing  the  HCMC  river  port.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nViet Nam\u2019s record in poverty reduction has been impressive in the last decade. The proportion of the population below the \npoverty line has declined from around 59% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The proposed target for the Five-Year Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (2006\u20132010) is to reduce poor households to 15%\u201316% by 2010. While significant in terms of magnitude, \nprogress in poverty reduction remains fragile, with a significant number of \u201cnear poor\u201d clustered just above the poverty line. \nSustained development requires modernization and improvement of physical infrastructure and associated services. \n \nExpressways are intended to serve long-distance traffic. They do not necessarily benefit local communities directly, but \naddress poverty in areas around the expressway indirectly by facilitating continued economic growth. The proposed three \nexpressways are crossing areas with very different rates and types of poverty.  \n \nHowever, improved transport infrastructure is critical for sustained rapid economic growth and overall poverty reduction, and \ncan contribute to regionally balanced and equitable economic growth by stimulating agriculture production, increasing access \nto employment opportunities, and facilitating better access to social services.  \n \nAccording to the Vietnam Poverty Update Report 2006,a considerable investment in infrastructure is widely believed to have \ncontributed to raising people\u2019s welfare and to reducing poverty. The lack of infrastructure is recognized as a major reason for \nthe high rate of poverty in the rural and remote isolated localities, and good efforts have been made in this area to promote \nmore inclusive development in Viet Nam, rather than leaving part of the population disconnected from the mainstream of \neconomic growth. Improved road connectivity under the proposed Project might contribute to poor people\u2019s ability to benefit \nfrom economic growth in the long run. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nConsiderable progress has been made in reducing poverty in Viet Nam. According to the Vietnam Poverty Update Report \n2006, the largest improvement was in the northeast region, including Lang Son and Quang Ninh provinces (crossed by the \nGMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Song and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressways) where the incidence of poverty fell from 86% in 1993 to 29% \nin 2004, a reduction of 57 percentage points over 11 years. There was similarly rapid poverty reduction in the Red River Delta \nregion, including Bac Giang Province (the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway), where the incidence of poverty fell by 51 \npercentage points during the same period, from 63% in 1993 to 12% in 2004. In the southeast region, including Ho Chi Minh \nCity and Dong Nai Province (the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway) the incidence of poverty fell by 32 percentage points \nbetween 1993 and 2004. By 2004, poverty in the southeast region was only 5%. \n \nHowever, some pockets of poverty can be found along the northern projects in rural and mountainous areas. In Bac Giang \nprovince (Lang Giang, Viet Yen, and Yen Dung districts), the incidence of poverty is between 16% and 23.5%. In Lang Son \nprovince (Huu Lung, Cao Loc, and Chi Lang districts), the incidence of poverty is between 18% and 27%. In Quang Ninh \nprovince (Hai Ha, Dam Ha, and Tien Yen districts), the incidence of poverty is above 20%; while in the mountainous Ba Che \ndistrict, half of the population is living below the poverty line. For the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway, all the districts \ncrossed have an incidence of poverty below 10%. \n \nIt is important to note that the road network has been considerably improved in all the project areas during the last 10 years.  \n \nBetween Ha Noi and Lang Son, National Highway No.1 (NH1) has been improved in 2001 under an ADB-financed project.b \nNH1 follows mainly a new alignment. The new NH1 has reduced the travel time from the border to Ha Noi from 5.5 hours to \n2.5 hours. In addition, the rural road component of the project was designed to improve 600 kilometers (km) of selected \nprovincial and district roads, in particular in Bac Giang and Lang Son provinces. Therefore, the proposed Project will have \nlimited impact on poverty reduction in Bac Giang and Lang Son provinces in comparison with the impacts, due to the \nrehabilitation of NH1 and the improvement of rural roads.  \n \nIn Quang Ninh province, National Highway No.18 (NH18) from Cam Pha to Mong Cai has also been rehabilitated. However, \nNH18 is in constant need of repairs due to heavy vehicle traffic and also suffers from poor design standards imposed by the \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \ntopography of the area through which it passes. According to the Government\u2019s prefeasibility study,c the three proposed \nalignment options will have positive impacts on poverty reduction, especially in the poor mountainous districts (Ba Che and \nTien Yen districts in particular). The linking of these districts to the future expressway should be carefully studied during the \nTA Loan Project, whatever the alignment option chosen.  \n \nFor the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project, the project area is already served by a good highway and even \nexpressway network. In addition, the incidence of poverty is under 10% in all the districts crossed by the proposed \nexpressway. Given the generally low rates of poverty in the project area, the proposed project will have very limited impact on \npoverty reduction in the project locations. The improvement of infrastructure will increase investment, growth of industry, and \ncommerce in the project provinces. Through this economic growth, it is anticipated that employment opportunities of the poor \nin the project provinces could be increased. \n \n2. Design Features.  \nThe expressways will have auxiliary facilities, such as bus stops and service areas (michi-no-eki), that the local people living \nalong the expressways could use. The project design study will include site selection and detailed designs of these facilities. \nOther  opportunities  for  pro-poor  design,  such  as  employment  generation  during  constriction,  will  be  explored  during \nimplementation of the TA Loan Project. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nProfile of the Beneficiaries \nFor a major highway project, there are no beneficiaries specifically targeted at the community level. The project is for the \nbenefit of the wider society through the contacts, goods, services, and mobility which it provides. Its social and economic \nimpacts, furthermore, are diffuse and cannot always be anticipated or controlled. As indicated above, the three project areas \n(in particular GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressways) benefit now from good rural road, highway, \nand expressway networks, which have considerably improved the living standards of the local population.  \n \nFor the three expressway projects, benefits will be found mainly at the regional and national levels, rather than the local level, \nexcept in Quang Ninh province where the proposed GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway will contribute to the development \nof some remote areas.  \n \nThe profile of beneficiaries for the three expressway projects is currently unknown; it will depend upon the option chosen for \nthe different projects. The profile of primary and secondary beneficiaries, poor and vulnerable groups, and their needs, \ndemands, constraints, and capacity will have to be identified during the implementation of the TA Loan Project. The \nsocioeconomic profile of the population disaggregated by ethnicity and gender in the project area will be prepared as well as \nthe social impact analysis along with the resettlement impact.   \n  \nEthnic Minorities \nThe presence of various ethnic minority groups is one of the main characteristics, especially for the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son \nExpressway Project, and, to a lesser extent, for the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project. For the Ben Luc\u2013Long \nThanh Expressway Project, few ethnic minorities are present. \n \nEthnic minority groups account for a large part of the population in the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway Project area. The \nthree main ethnic groups present in the project area are the Nung, the Tay, and the Kinh (major ethnicity in Viet Nam). In \nLang Son province, ethnic minority groups account for 86% of the population, and in Bac Giang province, they account for \n26%. In Lang Son province, the Nung account for 43% of the total population, the Tay 36%, and the Kinh 17%. Due to the \nlarge majority of ethnic minorities in the project area, ethnic minorities are found everywhere (urban areas, valleys, and \nmountains). The Kinh, however, are concentrated on the plains and in urban areas. Ethnic minorities are involved in all \neconomic activities in the project area, and along the project corridor; there is no economic difference between Kinh and non-\nKinh.  \nFor the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway Project, the major ethnic groups, the Kinh account for 95% of the population in \nQuang Ninh province, and the percentage of the ethnic minority groups is only 5%. However in some of the districts crossed \nby the different project options, the percentage of ethnic minority groups is much higher. The mountainous Ba Che district has \nby far the highest percentage (nearly 75%) of its population belonging to ethnic minority groups. Tien Yen district has also a \nhigh percentage (42%) of population belonging to ethnic minority groups. This district is crossed by the three options. Poverty \nis also more prevalent among ethnic minority groups than the Kinh majority. For the whole province, the incidence of poverty \nis 7.2% among the entire population but reaches 28.5% among the ethnic minority population.  \nFew ethnic minority groups are present in the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project area where they represent less than \n ", "    Appendix 12       57     \n1% of the population of the affected districts. In addition, the Hoa, the main ethnic group present in the project area, usually \nhave a better living standard than that of other ethnic minorities.  \nDuring the implementation of the TA Loan Project, the resettlement and other related impacts of the Project will be assessed \nfor the three expressways. Accordingly, the ethnic minority development plan or ethnic minority specific actions will be \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nAffected Persons \nAccording to the Government\u2019s prefeasibility studies, the proposed projects involve the construction of four to six lanes for the \nGMS  Ha Noi\u2013Lang  Son  and  Ha  Long\u2013Mong  Cai  Expressways  and  up  to  eight  lanes  for  the  Ben  Luc\u2013Long  Thanh \nExpressway. The total lengths will be about 120 km for the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway and the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong \nCai Expressway and about 60 km for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway.  \nTherefore, the three expressway projects will require considerable land acquisition: around 250 hectares (ha) of mainly \nagricultural and forestry land for the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway; 290\u2013320 ha of mainly forestry and aquaculture \nponds for the GMS Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai Expressway, according to the option chosen; and 710 ha of mainly agricultural and \naquaculture ponds for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway. Residential land will also be affected in all projects. \nThe number of affected households is currently unknown but is expected to be higher than 1,000 for each of the three \nexpressway projects. For the three expressway projects, resettlement should be under category A, and a full resettlement \nplan will have to be conducted for each project. \n \nHIV/AIDS \nThe GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai expressway projects will increase the inter-border traffic between the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) and Viet Nam, which could also increase the risk of the spread of HIV. As in border areas \nbetween  many  countries,  AIDS  prevention  and  control  is  challenging,  in  part  due  to  high  mobility.  According  to  a \nnongovernment organization (NGO) report,d Lang Son province is reported to have one of the highest rates of HIV prevalence \n(1.4%) in the country after Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). The risk of HIV transmission in the border \nareas of Lang Son province is likely to remain high in the coming years because HIV transmission occurs not only among the \ncommercial sex workers and intravenous drug users but also among clients and the general population. Quang Ninh province \nhas the third-highest number of people living with AIDS in the country.  \n \nThe situation for the Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway Project is different. Even if HCMC has the highest HIV rate in the \ncountry, the two districts belonging to HCMC which are crossed by the expressway are rural districts with slow urbanization \nand industrialization and with few AIDS cases. This expressway will also not create new pathway for diseases as it is mainly a \nring road around HCMC. \n \nHuman Trafficking \nLang Son and Mong Cai are two important gateways for human trafficking (especially women) between Viet Nam and the \nPRC. According to a survey by Save the Children UK and the Youth Research Institute,e poverty was the major factor leading \nto human trafficking, as persons seeking opportunities for higher-paying work outside of their home provinces are vulnerable \nto being deceived into trafficking situations. Other factors contributing to the problem include lack of education and low \nawareness among women of the dangers. Many victims of trafficking were single women who legitimately wished to get \nmarried, while many Chinese men are bachelors seeking wives. The GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son and Ha Long\u2013Mong Cai \nExpressways will increase the inter-border traffic between the PRC and Viet Nam. An awareness campaign should be \nconducted among the population. NGOs such as Save the Children UK should be associated with this campaign. \n \nThe Ben Luc\u2013Long Thanh Expressway is quite a distance from the border area; however, the economic growth as a result of \nthe expressway will increase migration in the project area. The migrant laborer may face risk of human trafficking.  \n \nThe social analysis will include the risks of the spread of HIV and potential increase in human trafficking for all the three \nexpressways projects. Assessment of HIV and human trafficking will include (i) the current prevalence of HIV in the project \narea; (ii) the type and level of vulnerability of the population along the proposed expressway to HIV (disaggregated by gender, \nethnicity, age, type of occupation, mobility, etc.); (iii) current human trafficking situation and the potential increase in human \ntrafficking as well as increase in migration in and out of the project areas; (iii) review of provincial plans and activities on \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking; (iv) review of existing programs of donors and nongovernment organizations on HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking; (vi) recommendations for activities related to provincial plans and links with other development \npartners\u2019 programs for preventing and mitigating the impacts; and (vii) assessment of the capacity-building training needs of \nrelevant agencies for anti-HIV/AIDS. An HIV/AIDS awareness and human trafficking prevention program in the construction \nsites and the towns and villages along the expressways will be prepared for the investment loans. \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe consultation and participation process and the stakeholder analysis for each expressway project will be undertaken \nduring the implementation stage of the TA Loan Project. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nThe general alignments of the three expressways will be proposed through initial engineering, social, and environmental \nsurveys made by consultants to be engaged under the associated TA projects. The Ministry of Transport and the Vietnam \nExpressway Corporation will have consultation meetings on the general alignments with the project stakeholders including \nrepresentatives from the project provinces, districts, and communes. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nAccording to the Vietnam Country Gender Assessment,f Viet Nam holds a reputation throughout the region for relative gender \nequality and has been able to close gender gaps in areas such as education, access to health care, and some aspects of \nemployment. Where the benefits are not reaching all, gender equality issues are often amplified by factors such as age, \nethnicity, and regional differences, especially between rural and urban areas. \n \nThe socioeconomic profile will be disaggregated by gender, as well as social and resettlement-related impact on men and \nwomen will be analyzed. The HIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention program will have specific focus on women. There \ncould be risk of human trafficking of women and children as part of increased migration because of economic growth in the \nproject provinces. Gender analysis will be part of the social assessment, and it will be done for each expressway project \nduring implementation stage of the TA Loan Project. Focused initiatives may be needed in the three project areas to target \npoor women, and vulnerable women groups and geographic areas. \n \n2.  Key Actions.
