The project will ensure new or more reliable water \nsupply  to  about  1.23  million  urban  and  rural  inhabitants  of  Chaonan  District  by  integrating \nurban\u2013rural  water  supply  systems  and  reducing  water  losses.  It  will  also  support  watershed \nmanagement  through  reforestation,  pollution  prevention  and  water  quality  monitoring,  public \nawareness building, and institutional capacity development.2 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nChaonan  District  is  a  county-level  administrative  division  of  Shantou  Municipality  in \n3. \nGuangdong Province. About 30 kilometers away from the Shantou City center, Chaonan District \nhas  a  population  of  about  1.33  million  spreading  over  about  600  square  kilometers,  of  which \n1.13 million or about 85% are rural residents. Chaonan District, which administers 232 villages in \n11 towns, is a plain with hills in the northeast and coastlines in the east. Annual rainfall averages \nabout  1,830  millimeters.  The  total  annual  water  resources  of  the  district  are  about  580  million \ncubic meters (mcm), equivalent to only about 450 cubic meters (m3) per capita per year, which is \ninternationally  considered  as  absolute  water  scarcity.3 There  are  about  70  small  and  medium-\nsized  reservoirs  in  the  district  with  a  total  storage  capacity  of  about  224  mcm,  of  which  eight \nreservoirs  along  the  three  river  systems  (Jinxi,  Longxi,  and  Qiufeng)  are  the  district\u2019s  dominant \nwater sources, contributing about 180 mcm. \n\nGuangdong Province has achieved remarkable growth since 1980 and it is now one of \n4. \nthe  most  developed  provinces  in  the  PRC,  accounting  for  over  11%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  2011  gross \ndomestic  product.  However,  Guangdong  faces  a  serious  challenge  of  poverty  and  rising \ninequality, representing a microcosm of the PRC. More than 18% of its rural residents lived on \nless than $2/day in 2007, and two-thirds of those who lived in poverty were found in the eastern \nand  western  regions,  where  Chaonan  District  is.4 Due  to  its  large  rural  population  and  less-\ndeveloped  industry  and  services,  the  district\u2019s  economy  and  fiscal  revenue  fall  far  behind  the \ndeveloped  regions  in  Guangdong  and  even  below  the  national  average.  Its  per  capita  gross \ndomestic product in 2011 was only CNY16,379, which was about 32% of the provincial average \nof CNY50,807; or about 46% of the national average of CNY35,198. The per capita annual net \nincome of rural households in 2011 was CNY5,076, which was about half the provincial average \nof CNY9,372, or 72% of the national average of CNY6,977.  \n \n5. \nInadequate  and  unsafe  water  supply.  Chaonan  District  faces  a  great  challenge  of \nensuring  water  security  for  its  social  and  economic  development  due  to  (i)  lack  of  adequate \nwater  treatment  and  supply  facilities,  (ii)  weak  institutional  capacity  for  managing  water \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  Guangdong  Chaonan \n\nWater Resources Protection and Conservation Demonstration Project (TA 8112-PRC).  \n\n3  Hydrologists typically assess scarcity by looking at the population\u2013water equation. An area is experiencing water \nstress  when  annual  water  availability  drops  below  1,700  m3/person. When  annual  water  availability  drops  below \n1,000 m3/person, the population faces water scarcity; and below 500 m3 absolute water scarcity. \n\n4  World Bank. 2011.  Reducing Inequality for Shared Growth in China: Strategy and Policy Options for Guangdong \n\nProvince. Washington, DC. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nresources and providing water services, and (iii) water pollution in rivers and other water bodies \naround  the  towns  and  villages  in  the  plain  area.  Current  water  supply  capacity,  including  the \nthree major water supply systems of Jinxi, Longxi, and Qiufeng, is about 135,000 m3/day, which \nis far from meeting both the current and future demand for domestic and industrial uses in the \ndistrict. Water  demand  is  estimated to reach  288,800  m3/day  by  2020 and  331,423 m3/day  by \n2025. The current water supply systems serve about 70% of the district population, but cannot \nguarantee 7-day, 24-hour services. The three water supply systems are independent from each \nother  and  cannot  supplement  each  other  if  one  system  is  facing  water  shortage.  Due  to  low \ntechnical standards, aging of the pipes, and lack of maintenance, nonrevenue water (NRW) of \nthe  current  district  supply  systems  are  as  high  as  50%  (40%  leakage,  10%  nonpayment), \nresulting in serious water and energy losses, high water tariffs, and limited service coverage.5 \n\nMoreover,  about  429,600  residents  (32%  of  the  population)  do  not  have  access  to  tap \n6. \nwater.  Some  residents  are  still  using  wells  as  direct  source  for  cooking  and  drinking  without \nappropriate  treatment,  which  has  caused  serious  health  problems  due  to  the  high  fluoride \ncontent in the groundwater. Such unreliable and inequitable water supply has affected economic \ndevelopment and people\u2019s living standards in Chaonan District. \n\nWater pollution. The water quality in the reservoirs is generally good (class II)6 but soil \n7. \nerosion occurs in some catchment areas and eutrophication risk7 is increasing, especially in the \nQiufeng reservoir, due to nonpoint source pollution8 from agricultural practices in the watershed. \nLian  River,  which  originates  from  Puning  Municipality  and  flows  through  Chaonan  District,  is \nseriously polluted. The water quality of most Lian River sections is below class V, and cannot be \nused for irrigation or landscaping. In 2011, the total domestic wastewater discharge amounted \nto 22.6 mcm, and total industrial discharge reached 19.2 mcm, primarily from textile and dyeing \nfactories in the district. Inadequate wastewater treatment capacity and rural sanitation networks \nare  also  concerns.  Currently,  less  than  50%  of  the  district\u2019s  wastewater  is  treated  and  only \nabout 20% of rural wastewater is connected to the district\u2019s sewerage system. \n\nWeak  institutional  capacity.  The  district  lacks  adequate  institutional  capacity  and  a \n8. \nwater  supply  master  plan  for  integrated  water  resources  management.  The  Chaonan  district \ngovernment  (CDG)  established  the  Chaonan  Water  Supply  Company  (CWSC)  in  2012  to \noperate and maintain the district\u2019s several independently operated water supply plants (WSPs) \nand the pipe networks. However, CWSC has limited control over water distribution to and tariffs \nfor end users because ownership of the distribution pipes belongs to individual towns or villages. \nCWSC supplies water through these towns and/or villages to end users, and charges the towns \nor  villages  instead  of  directly  charging  the  end  users.  Such  an  arrangement  has  resulted  in \nhigher overall cost, low efficiency, inadequate maintenance, and unfair and high tariffs. CWSC \nneeds to be entrusted with overall responsibility over the water supply system, and empowered \nwith  qualified  professionals  to  provide  better  services  to  its  clients.  There  is  also  a  need  to \nstrengthen  the  district\u2019s  overall  water  resources  management  capacity,  and  to  increase  public \nawareness on water resources protection and environmental improvement. This is to ensure the \nsustainability of water supply and thus the economic development of the district. \n\n                                                \n5   Nonrevenue water refers to water that has been produced and is \u201clost\u201d before it reaches the customer. \n6  The  PRC\u2019s  national  standard  defines  five  water  quality  classes:  class  I  for  headwaters  and  natural  reserves; \nclass II for first-class drinking water sources and habitats of rare species; class III for second-class drinking water \nsources, aquaculture, and swimming; class IV for water sources for industrial use,  and recreational use that does \nnot involve direct human contact with water; and class V for water sources for agricultural use and landscaping.   \n7   Eutrophication  refers  to  excessive  richness  of nutrients  in  a  lake  or  other  body  of  water,  frequently  due  to  runoff \n\nfrom the land, which causes a dense growth of plant life and death of animal life from lack of oxygen. \n\n8  Nonpoint source pollution refers to diffuse pollution caused by sediment, nutrients, organic, and toxic substances \n\noriginating from land-use activities, which are carried to lakes and streams by surface runoff. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nGovernment  efforts  and  opportunities  for  Asian  Development  Bank support. The \n9. \nprovincial,  municipal,  and  district  governments  have  been  increasing  their  investments  in  the \ndistrict\u2019s  water  resources  management,  and  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities. \nConservation  zones  were  established  around  the  district\u2019s  three  major  reservoirs  to  protect \nwater from pollution. The reservoirs were rehabilitated to their designed function and full-storage \ncapacity. The governments are also restoring the severely polluted Lian River. Two wastewater \ntreatment plants, with a total treatment capacity of 60,000 m3/day, have been in operation since \nDecember  2010.  In  2013,  CDG  approved  its  wastewater  treatment  plan,  2013\u20132020,  which \naims to expand the two wastewater treatment plants to their design capacity of 130,000 m3/day \nand  to  construct  three  additional  wastewater  treatment  plants  and  associated  sewerage  and \nsanitation  networks  by  2020  to  cope  with  increasing  wastewater  volumes.9 To  implement  and \ncoordinate  these  activities,  the  district  needs  an  integrated  approach  to  water  resources \nmanagement and construction of water supply infrastructure for both urban and rural residents. \nIt needs external support to help (i) ensure equitable water supply and thus equitable urban and \nrural  development,  (ii)  improve  the  district\u2019s  water  resources  management  and  CWSC\u2019s \nperformance, and (iii) promote water conservation and step up water security for both urban and \nrural  residents.  During  project  preparation,  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation  in  the \nproject  were  explored  but  found  to  be  limited  due  to  the  fragmented  ownership  of  the  current \nwater supply pipe networks in the district.  \n\nThe project is consistent with the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 of the Government \n10. \nof  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (government),  which  aims  to  build  a  harmonious  and \nmoderately  prosperous  society  through  livelihood  improvement,  equitable  urbanization  and \ncoordinated  urban\u2013rural  development,  and  balanced  regional  and  environmentally  sustainable \ngrowth. 10  The  project  supports  the  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for increasing water use efficiency and rural water supply coverage, \nand  promoting  integrated  water  resources  management. 11 The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC, which supports the government\u2019s goal of \nbuilding  a  harmonious  society  by  focusing  on  three  strategic  pillars  of  inclusive  growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional cooperation and integration.12 The twelfth five-\nyear plans for Guangdong Province and Shantou Municipality also focus on building a resource-\noriented  and  environment-friendly  society  to  increase  water  use  efficiency,  improve  the \nenvironment, reduce regional development gaps, and improve people\u2019s living environment. The \nproject  also  conforms  to  the  Guangdong  Provincial  Water  Resources  Development  and \nProtection  Master  Plan,  which  emphasizes  that  water  resources  will  be  developed,  used,  and \nmanaged in a coordinated and sustainable way.13 \n\n11. \n Lessons.  The  project  design  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  experiences  and  lessons  from  previous \nprojects  and  knowledge  generated  from  policy-oriented  studies  on  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement, water supply, wastewater treatment, urban and rural development, and flood and \nwetland management in the PRC and other countries. Major lessons from those earlier projects \nand  incorporated  in  the  current  project  design  are  (i)  an  integrated  approach  of  structural  and \nnonstructural measures to water resources management; (ii) wide community participation and \nincreased  public  awareness  for  environmental  improvement;  (iii)  adequate  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  with  sustainable  financial  sources  based  on  a  realistic  and  enforceable \n                                                \n9  Chaonan District Government. 2013.

The  project  is  expected  to  demonstrate  the \n12. \nfollowing  innovations  that  can  be  replicated  in  other  regions  of  Guangdong  Province  and  the \nPRC:  (i)  an  integrated  approach  to  water  resources  management,  (ii)  inclusive  water  supply \nservices and integration of urban and rural water supply systems, (iii) strengthened operational \nperformance of the water utility, and (iv) institutional and tariff reforms. \n\n13. \nIntegrated  approach  to  water  resources  management.  The  project  will  not  only \nsupport  structural  measures  to  build  water  supply  facilities,  but  also  support  nonstructural \nmeasures  to  improve  watershed  management  and  protect  water  sources  from  pollution.  The \nnonstructural  measures  include  reforestation  in  upstream  catchment  areas,  a  pollution \nprevention  study,  environmental  awareness  building  and  education,  solid  waste  treatment  in \nrural villages, institutional strengthening and capacity development for water resources planning, \nand  support  for  the  establishment  of  a  water  quality  monitoring  center  and  a  three-prevention \n(flood, drought, and typhoon) management center. The project will also support NRW reduction \nfrom  the  current  50%  to  25%  by  project  completion.  In  addition,  extensive  environmental  and \nsocial due diligence was conducted, including assessment of potential climate change impacts \nand  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  water  supply  facilities,  and  the  assessment  of  social  risks  and \npromotion of community participation. \n \n14. \nInclusive  water  supply  services  and  integration  of  urban  and  rural  water  supply \nsystems. The project will cover the majority of Chaonan District and provide better water supply \nservices  to  both  urban  and  rural  residents  in  the  district  by  adopting  unified  service  standards \nand  water  tariffs.  Water  demand  projections  and  the  design  of  the  water  supply  system  have \nfactored  in  future  urbanization  requirements.  The  project  will  also  improve  responses  to \ndroughts and the reliability of water supply by integrating the three major supply systems of the \ndistrict  so  they  can  supplement  each  other  when  one  system  encounters  problems.  Such  an \ninclusive integration is ADB\u2019s value addition to inclusive and balanced development, and applies \nto future urbanization and regional integration of Guangdong Province and other regions in the \nPRC.  This model can be replicated in many similar rural and small-town water supply systems \nin the PRC to improve services and efficiency. \n \n15. \nStrengthened operational performance. The project will strengthen CWSC, the major \nimplementing agency and the operator of the water supply system under the project. The project \nwill  upgrade  the  skills  of  operational  staff,  improve  operational  performance  and  viability, \nestablish water quality monitoring and control centers, and reduce operating losses. The current \nwater  supply  systems\u2019  NRW  is  particularly  high,  and  an  assessment  was  carried  out  during \nproject  preparation  to  determine  improvement  measures.  The  project  incorporates  such \nmeasures to reduce NRW with an agreed target. \n  \n16. \nInstitutional  and  tariff  reforms.  The  project  will  support  the  executing  agency\u2019s \ninstitutional  and  tariff  reforms  by  (i)  streamlining  institutional  arrangements  for  water  supply \nservices in the district, which means removing involvement of towns and villages to allow CWSC \nto collect tariffs directly from end users; (ii) making services equitable to all and affordable to the \npoor  according  to  local  conditions;  (iii)  strengthening  tariff-setting  mechanisms  through  public \nhearings;  and  (iv)  increasing  industrial  tariffs  and  improving  CWSC\u2019s  performance  to  recover \ncosts. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe impact of the project will be better health and quality of life in Chaonan District.

Technical feasibility was \nassessed  to  be  adequate  after  detailed  examination  of  the  project\u2019s  compatibility  with  local \nconditions,  including  projections  of  water  resources  balance  and  demand\u2013supply  relationship. \nAlternative  technical  options  identified  the  most  suitable  WSP  locations  and  water  treatment \nsystems  in terms of  economic  and  safeguards  aspects. The  processes  selected for  water  and \nsludge treatment are appropriate for O&M and are in accordance with the technical capacity of \nthe  local  implementing  agencies.  To  ensure  adequate  skills,  the  project  will  finance  capacity \nbuilding such as (i) training under the capacity development output to ensure sustainable O&M \nof project facilities, (ii) preparation of a water resources protection and development action plan, \nand (iii) strengthening of the capacity for water management by financing a water supply control \ncenter  and  a  three-prevention  management  center.  Installation  of  water  meters  and  NRW \nreduction are closely coordinated with the proposed water tariff reforms. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n27. \nThe project economic analysis used with- and without-project scenarios following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997).  The  project\u2019s  economic  costs  were \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nderived from the investment and O&M costs. The project\u2019s economic benefit was derived from \nwillingness-to-pay estimation based on the survey conducted in the project area. The economic \nnet present value was CNY146.8 million and the economic internal rate of return was estimated \nat  15.1%,  which  confirmed  the  economic  viability  of  the  project.  Sensitivity  analysis  further \nconfirmed  robustness  of  the  economic  viability  by  showing  economic  viability  in  four  adverse \nscenarios:  10%  reduction  in  benefits,  10%  increase  in  investment  cost,  10%  increase  in  O&M \ncost, and 1-year delay in project implementation. \n\nThe  financial  analysis  confirmed  the  financial  viability  of  the  revenue-generating  output \n28. \n(i.e.,  improved  water  supply  infrastructure)  and  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  nonrevenue-\ngenerating outputs. For the revenue-generating output, the financial internal rate of return  was \nestimated at 4.4%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 2.9% and confirmed \nthe  financial  viability  of  the  output.  Sensitivity  analysis  further  showed  that  the  project  is \nsensitive  to  a  revenue  reduction  and  an  investment  cost  increase.  The  financial  analysis  also \nexamined  financial  sustainability  of  nonrevenue-generating  outputs  and  confirmed  that  CDG, \nthe end borrower of the ADB loan, has sufficient financial capacity to provide counterpart funds \nand  shoulder  recurrent  costs,  and  principal  and  financing  charges,  for  the  nonrevenue-\ngenerating outputs. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe  procurement  capacity  assessment  indicated  that  (i)  CDG  and  the  implementing \n29. \nagencies  have  the  necessary  technical  and  human  resources  to  undertake  procurement  of \nconsulting  services,  goods,  and  works;  and  (ii)  monitoring  and  internal  controls  regarding \nprocurement are generally in place. The financial management assessment indicated that (i) the \nChaonan Finance Bureau has adequate and qualified staff for operating and administering the \nproject account and (ii) its internal control and audit  will be mitigated through capacity building \nand close monitoring during project implementation. However, the assessments also found that \nCDG  and  its  implementing  agencies  have  limited  knowledge  and  experience  with  ADB  or \ndevelopment  partners. The  project  will  provide  necessary  technical  assistance  and training  on \nADB  procedures  and  requirements  for  financial  management,  procurement,  disbursement, \nsafeguards, and monitoring and evaluation. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n30. \nwith the government and CDG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nThe project will directly benefit 1.23 million people in the plain areas of Chaonan District \nby  improving  urban  and  rural  water  supply  services,  providing  safe  drinking  water,  and \npromoting  sustainable  protection  of  water  and  environment.  The  direct  beneficiaries  include \nabout 76,500 members of low-income households. The project is expected to create about 655 \nfull-time employment opportunities during implementation. Most of them will be provided to local \npeople,  including  the  local  poor.  The  project  includes  measures,  detailed  in  the  social  action \nplan, to ensure participation of beneficiary communities. \n\n32. \nGender.  A  gender  analysis  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation.  The  project  is \ncategorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  contains  design  features  to  help  advance \ngender equality. The project will bring gender benefits to women, and a gender action plan was \nprepared to ensure women\u2019s participation and employment benefits. The gender action plan has \nset  numerical  targets for  minimal female  participation  in the  labor force, training  activities,  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\npublic  awareness  activities.  CDG  will  implement  the  measures,  monitor  impacts,  and  provide \nADB with sex-disaggregated data on employment and participation. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \n33. \nenvironmental examination and an environmental management plan (EMP) were prepared, and \nare consistent with the requirements set out in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \ninitial  environmental  examination  incorporates  the  results  of  the  domestic  environmental \nassessment  report  approved  by  the  Shantou  Municipality  Environmental  Protection  Bureau. \nConsultations  to  raise  public  awareness  of  the  project  and  receive  stakeholders'  inputs  were \nconducted  with  communities  and \nlocal  government  agencies.  The  conclusions  and \nrecommendations of assessments and consultations were integrated in the project design. The \ninitial  environmental  examination  and  EMP  were  disclosed  on  ADB  website  on  25  October \n2013.  CDG  will  be  responsible  for  EMP  implementation,  including  monitoring,  mitigation, \nreporting,  and  corrective  actions  or  measures.  The  project  management  office  will  have  final \nresponsibility  for  handling  any  disputes  in  the  grievance  redress  mechanism.  The  institutional \ncapacity of the implementing agencies to enforce the EMP is weak, and the project will include a \ncapacity  development  program to ensure compliance with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. \nImplementation of the EMP, including capacity development programs, is expected to prevent or \nminimize potential impacts.  \n\n34. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  achieve  environmental  benefits,  including  water  quality \nimprovement, better water supply services to a large majority of residents in Chaonan District, \nclimate  change  adaptation,  reduced  water  and  energy  losses,  and  better  health  by  alleviating \ndrinking  water  endemics.  No  major  adverse  impacts  were  identified.  Potential  construction \nimpacts  include  air,  noise,  and  water  pollution;  fugitive  dust;  soil  erosion  and  contamination; \nsolid  waste  disposal;  interference  with  traffic  and  municipal  facilities;  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement; and occupational and community health and safety. Potential operational impacts \ninclude noise and energy use of the WSP pumps, occupational health and safety during WSP \noperation,  and  the  need  to  maintain  protection  efforts  at  the  three  reservoirs  to  minimize \nnonpoint source pollution from agriculture and rubbish dumping by local communities. A water \nbalance assessment was conducted, and potential environment-related livelihood impacts were \nassessed. No irrigated land will be reduced, and water allocated for environment will remain the \nsame as the current level. No environment-related livelihood impacts are anticipated. \n\n35. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. The project will \nrequire permanent land acquisition of 5.3 ha of village collective land for the construction of the \nthree WSPs,  including farmland,  orchard  land,  construction  land,  wasteland,  and  water  ponds. \nIn all, 15 persons from two households renting 3.0 ha of collective land are affected directly by \nthe  permanent  land  acquisition.  Use  of  the  remaining  2.3  ha  of  affected  collective  village  land \nwill  have  only  indirect  impacts.  In  addition,  total  temporary  land  occupation  for  laying  the \npipelines,  access  road,  storing  construction  materials,  and  other  requirements  will  be  about \n151.4 ha, including 53.5 ha of state-owned land and 97.9 ha of collective land. The project will \nnot  trigger  any  house  or  building  demolition.  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared,  which  is \nconsistent with the requirements set out in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy  Statement. The budget for \nland  acquisition  is  included  in  the  project.  When  final  design  becomes  available,  the \nresettlement plan will be updated in consultation with the affected villages and submitted to ADB \nfor  approval.  No  land  acquisition  will  be  undertaken  before  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  final \nresettlement plan. The resettlement plan was disclosed on ADB website on 25 October 2013.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36. \nThe  project  has  some  potential  environmental,  institutional,  governance,  and  financial \nrisks.  The  project  provides  adequate  measures  to  mitigate  these  risks,  and  the  integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.17 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe tariff reform plan is not \ntimely or not fully implemented. \n\nInadequate wastewater \ntreatment capacity as a result \nof increased water supply \ncapacity \n\nMitigating Measures \nCDG  has  committed  strongly  to  support  the  realization  of  CWSC\u2019s \ndirect  charge  to  end  users.  The  project  will  provide  training  and \ncapacity  development  to  CDG  and  CWSC  for  implementing  the \ninstitutional and water tariff reforms.
