An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  completed  and \nthe  summary  was  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \nBoard of Directors on 4 January 2008. \n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nProject Description  The  Chongqing\u2013Lichuan  Railway  (CLR)  Development  Project  is  a \npriority  project  included  in  the  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (11FYP)  of  the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  (Government).  The  Project  is  located  in  the \ncentral  part  of  Chongqing  municipality  and  the  northwestern  part  of \nHubei  province,  a  relatively  poor  area,  and  is  designed  to  promote \nsustainable  economic  growth  by  constructing  259  kilometers  (km)  of \nrailway  line  from  Chongqing  to  Lichuan  in  Hubei  province.  The  Project \nwill  (i)  develop  an  efficient,  safe,  affordable,  and  environmentally \nsustainable  railway  transport  system  in  the  region;  and  (ii)  help  create \nmore employment and income-generating opportunities, thus benefiting \npoor residents.  \n \nThe  Project  reflects  ADB\u2019s  railway  sector  operational  strategy  for  the \nPRC,  which  includes  reducing  railway  network  constraints  to  promote \nsustainable economic growth in poor areas not served by railways. The \ncomponents have been formulated in line with the Ministry of Railway\u2019s \n(MOR\u2019s) 2004 railway development plan and its 11FYP (2006\u20132010). \n \nCLR  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  western  development  strategy  to \nprovide  less-developed  regions  with  better  infrastructure  to  facilitate \neconomic  growth,  thereby  giving  people  more  opportunities  to  improve \ntheir living standards. The interior regions of the PRC have not benefited \nas  much  from  economic  growth  and  reforms  as  the  east  coast;  in  fact, \nthe  gap  between  economic  and  social  development  has  increased. \nTransport  constraints  and  high \nfactors \ncontributing to regional economic disparities, and two of the constraints \npreventing  the  western  region  from  capitalizing  on  its  comparative \nadvantages. \n \nCLR  is  part  of  the  shortest  east\u2013west  corridor  linking  Shanghai, \nQingdao, Wuhan, Yichang, and other major cities and ports in the east \nto Chongqing and Chengdu in the west. The proposed alignment for the \nCLR  is  369  km  shorter  than  the  existing  route  between  Shanghai  and \nChengdu.  Traversing  Hubei  province,  and  Chongqing  municipality,  the \nproposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Yichang\u2013\nLichuan  in  the  east,  Chongqing\u2013Huaihua  railway  in  the  center,  the \nproposed  Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing  and  Xi\u2019an\u2013Chongqing  main  lines  in  the \nnorth, Chongqing\u2013Chengdu in the west. \n\nlogistics  costs  are \n\ntwo \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  MOR \n\n \n\n \n\nCLR,  a  joint-venture  railway  between  the  MOR  and  the  Chongqing \nmunicipal  government,  will  have  substantial  managerial  and  financial \nautonomy.  The  Project  will  help  change  railway  enterprises  from  cost \ncenters  in  a  planned  economy  to  profit  centers  in  an  increasingly \ncompetitive transport market.  \n \nThe Project will help increase standards of living and reduce poverty in \nthe  project  area  by  removing  a  transport  constraint  on  sustainable \neconomic growth, and improve safety and reliability by introducing new \nand  modern  technology.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the  provision  of \nefficient,  affordable,  environment-friendly,  and  energy-efficient  railway \ntransportation in unserved, less developed areas, creating the conditions \nnecessary  for  developing  local  resources  and  generating  employment \nand income-enhancing opportunities. \n \nProject preparation was participatory. Extensive consultations were held \nwith  all  the  main  stakeholders\u2014various  affected  people,  potential \nbeneficiaries,  village  leaders,  women\u2019s  groups,  local  ethnic  minority \nbureaus, and local governments in the project area. Household surveys \nwere  carried  out  and  participatory  workshops  were  organized  in  the \nproject area to elicit and gain an understanding of public opinion about \nthe  Project  and  provide  inputs  to  the  social  and  environmental \nassessments. \n \nThe  Project  comprises  (i)  the  construction  of  259  km  of  double-track, \nelectrified,  standard-gauge  Class  I  railway  from  Chongqing  to  Lichuan; \n(ii) the construction of eight new railway stations complete with facilities; \n(iii) safety  initiatives,  including  the  provision  of  modern  technology  and \nthe  provision  of  signaling, \nequipment \ncommunication,  and  management  information  systems;  (v)  training  in \nthe use and maintenance of modern equipment; (vi) consulting services \nfor  construction  supervision,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  marketing \nand business development; and (vii) institutional strengthening. The key \ninputs  needed  for  project  implementation  are  civil  works,  equipment, \nconsultants, and MOR and project company staff. \n \nThe total cost of the Project is $3,071.11 million.  \n\nfor  enhancing  safety;  (iv) \n\n \nA  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a term of 26 years including a grace \nperiod  of  6 years,  an  interest  rate  determined  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15%, and other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. \n \nUntil 30 June 2015 \n \n \n31 December 2014 \n\n\f \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n\nthe \n\nto  strengthen \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years. The Foreign Capital and \nTechnical Import Center (FCTIC), under MOR, will coordinate the tasks \nof  the  project  management  office  and  be  responsible  for  procurement, \nwithdrawals, and reporting to ADB. The project company will construct, \nmanage,  and  operate  the  CLR,  and  develop  and  implement  adequate \nand  transparent  business  development  mechanisms,  and  accounting \nand reporting systems.  \n \nMOR  will  procure  ADB-financed  components  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts  for  goods  valued  at  $1  million  or  more  will  be  procured \nthrough international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts valued at less \nthan  $1 million  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding \n(NCB),  according  to  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  (1999)  and \nsubject  to  clarifications  agreed  on  with  ADB.  Packages  valued  below \n$100,000, procurement will follow the shopping procedure.  \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  8  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices \ninstitutional,  marketing,  and  business \ndevelopment  functions  of  the  project  company.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (80%  technical  and \n20%  financial)  and  simplified  technical  proposal,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). MOR will hire and finance the services of national consultants for \nproject  design,  construction  supervision,  construction  quality  control, \nenvironmental supervision, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation \nof  the  safeguard  aspects  of  the  Project  according  to  government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i)  provide  the  shortest  land  route  between  Lichuan, \nFuling, and Chongqing\u2014key economic centers of Chongqing and Hubei \nprovince\u2014and enable railway users to benefit from lower transport costs \nand shorter travel distances and times; (ii) improve the environment and \nreduce  pollution; \nfuel \nconsumption and enhance energy efficiency, enabling the PRC to save \nvaluable \nthe  corridor\u2019s  capacity, \nbenefiting consumers and producers of goods and services through the \nprovision  of  timely  and  efficient  transport  services  and  lower  logistics \ncosts;  (vi) generate  direct  and  indirect  employment  in  the  project \ninfluence area, and create jobs and income-earning opportunities (many \nlocal unskilled laborers will be hired for the construction and operation of \nthe railway); (vii) provide access to broader markets to an area that now \nlacks adequate cost-efficient transportation services; and (viii) stimulate \nlocal development through small-business opportunities, tourism, railway \nto \nstation  area  development,  and  other \nmaximize benefits to local areas. \n \nThe  major  project  beneficiaries  will  be  (i)  the  Government,  which  will \nimproved  safety; \nreduced  energy  bill  and \nbenefit \n(ii) passengers,  including  tourists,  who  will  benefit  from  affordable, \nfaster,  and  safer  trips;  (iii) freight  users,  who  will  benefit  from  more \naffordable,  faster,  and  safer  trips  when  they  switch  from  the  existing \nroad;  (iv) local  residents,  who  will  benefit  from  the  lower  prices  of \n\ninfrastructure  elements, \n\nforeign  exchange;  (v) \n\nrailway  safety; \n\n(iii) enhance \n\nincrease \n\nreduce \n\nfrom \n\n(iv) \n\nthe \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n\n \n\nfor \n\nto  a \n\ntransport \n\nlocal  area  development  and \n\ncommodities  and  services  transported  by  the  project  railway;  (v) local \nlabor  involved  in  construction  work  and  the  supply  of  materials  during \nimplementation,  and  loading/unloading  during  the  railway\u2019s  operation; \n(vi) local farmers, who will be able to sell their products at market prices \nwithout  paying  a  high  margin \nintermediary; \n(vii) manufacturers and traders, who can increase production capacity or \nestablish businesses, and will transport their goods and services by the \nrailway;  and  (viii) local  governments,  which  will  benefit  from  the \nincreased  opportunity \nincreased \nrevenues. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 5.5 million people living in the project area. \nThe poverty and social assessment looked at seven counties or districts. \nTwo  counties  are  designated  national  or  provincial  poverty  counties. \nThere  are  681  poverty  villages  and  about  590,000  people  are  poor. \nAbout 65% of the beneficiaries live in rural areas, and 16.4% are poor, \nwith  an  annual  net  income  per  capita  of  less  than  CNY900.  The  links \nbetween  poverty,  difficult  topography,  and  poor  transport  systems  are \napparent  in  the  project  area  for  the  proposed  CLR.  Poverty  is  often \ncaused  by  geographic  remoteness  and  isolation,  limited  transport \naccess, high transport costs, and poor access to market information, as \nwell as limited access to health, education, and other social services. \n \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  the  creation  of  additional  employment  and \nincome-generating  opportunities.  About  119,000  person-years  of  work \nwill  be created  during  construction. This  will  provide  direct employment \nopportunities  to  over  59,500  poor  people,  including  women  and  ethnic \nminorities.  Railway  station  area  development  will  increase  incomes  in \nlocal  communities  and  help  generate  local  revenues.  The  Project  will \nfacilitate  the  development  of  small  businesses,  local  industry,  and \ntourism, and thus help generate additional opportunities in the future for \nlocal  people.  Consultations  with  local  people  in  the  project  area \nindicated their strong support for the Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  5.48% \nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  exceeds  the  2.80%  weighted  average \ncost  of  capital.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at \n16.7%.  \n \nThe  increased  tax  revenues  generated  by  the  economic  development \ninduced by the Project will help finance improved social service facilities \nand basic infrastructure. \n \nThe  railway  will  be  constructed  in  mountainous  and  difficult  terrain, \nwhich  presents  a  significant  technical  challenge.  The  associated \nphysical risks during implementation include delays, cost overruns, risks \nto worker health and safety, and environmental impact. These potential \nrisks  have  been  assessed  and  mitigating  measures  based  on  lessons \nlearned from other railroad projects in the PRC have been provided.  \n \nResettlement  will  cause  the  relocation  of  about  5,314  people.  The \nrailway  alignment  was  selected \nto  minimize  resettlement,  where \npossible.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  preferential  treatment  for \n\n\f \n\nv\n \n\nemployment  during  construction,  supply  of  local  materials,  allocation  of \ncommercial  space  near  railway  stations,  and  job  training.  Resettlement \nwill  be  implemented  by  local  governments  and  closely  monitored  and \nsupervised.  These  measures  will  mitigate  the  potential  social  risks \nassociated with resettlement. \n \nIntermodal  competition  between  railways  and  roads  will  create  market \nrisks  for  the  project  railway.  However,  the  existing  road  is  already \ncongested and the capacity constraint is expected to worsen. Surveys of \npassengers  and  freight  shippers  found  that  the  railway  would  have \nseveral  advantages  over  other  transport  modes:  lower  fares,  shorter \ntravel \nincreasing  commercial \norientation of the joint-venture railway will help to lessen the risks posed \nby intermodal competition. \n\ntimes,  safety,  and  punctuality.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nFrom 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, to 2007, the PRC \nexperienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth,  which  resulted  in  a  correspondingly  rapid \nincrease  in  demand  for  transportation.  Passenger  transport  grew  by  9%  yearly  and  freight \ntransport by 7.6%. The railway is the principal mode of freight transport in the PRC. In 2006, the \nmodal split for freight ton-kilometers (km) was 47.5% for railways, 27.9% for inland waterways \nand sea-to-shore shipping, 21.1% for roads, 3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. That \nsame year, road traffic accounted for 52.8% of total passenger-kilometers, railways for 34.5%, \ncivil aviation for 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways for 0.4%.  \n \n3. \nThe railway is the primary mode of transport for long-distance and bulk transport. At the \nend of 2007, the PRC\u2019s railway system of 78,000 km comprised 63,600 km of national railways \nand 14,400 km of joint-venture and local railways. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) operates the \nstate-owned  national  railway  as  an  integrated  system.  The  joint-venture  and  local  railways, \ncomprising regional lines within provincial boundaries, are constructed under the sponsorship of \nprovincial governments or MOR to serve local needs and provide interconnection to the national \nrailway  network.  The  railway  network,  despite  its  large  size,  does  not  adequately  cover  the \ncountry\u2019s population and land area.1 \n \nPRC\u2019s  railways  have  the  highest  freight  transport  density  in  the  world  and  the \n4. \nsecond-highest passenger transport density after Japan\u2019s. Locomotive turnover is the highest in \nthe world. From 1978 to 2007, railway freight increased yearly by 5.28%, from 535 billion ton-km \nto  2,380 billion ton-km,  and  passenger  traffic  by  6.74%,  from  109 billion  passenger-km  to \n722 billion passenger-km. For passenger trips, the average railway journey increased from 134 \nkm in 1978 to 532 km in 2007; in comparison, the average road journey lengthened from 35 km \nto 55 km over the same period. For freight, the average journey in 2007 was 757 km for railway \nand  65  km  for  road.  Despite  such  growth  rates,  railway  capacity  has  lagged  behind  demand \nbecause  of  system  constraints  (Appendix  2).  Given  the  railways\u2019  important  role  in  providing \neconomic  transportation,  these  constraints,  if  not  removed,  will  continue  to  thwart  efficient \neconomic  growth.  The  Government\u2019s  aggressive  plan  for  improving  railways  includes  network \nexpansion and construction in underserved areas. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \n5. \nThe railway development policy of the Government of the PRC (Government) is directed \nat (i) removing constraints and expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint-\nventure  local  railways  to  promote  the  development  of  local  economies,  (iii)  improving  the \nefficiency and safety of the existing system by using new technology and modern management \n\n                                                 \n1  The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one-third that of India and one-tenth that of Japan. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ntools  in  planning  and  operation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing \nand  commercialization  of  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase \nautonomy and accountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure \nand related services.  \n \n6. \nIn 2004, the State Council approved a new railway development plan for the period up to \n2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network to 100,000 km. Increasing train speed is a \nmajor goal. Priority will be given to developing railways in unserved areas and regions that now \nlack transport and are still less developed. The route network length will increase by 16,000 km \nin the western region of the PRC, to reach a network length of 40,000 km by 2020. To improve \noperational  efficiency,  MOR  has  begun  separating  passenger  and  freight  trains  on  key  rail \ncorridors.2  \n \n7. \nThe  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (11FYP)  (2006\u20132010)  continues  to  emphasize  railway \ndevelopment,  and  seeks  to  speed  up  railway  construction.  The  plan  envisages  (i)  the \nconstruction of 17,000 km of new lines, and (ii) the double-tracking and electrification of 45% of \nthe network length. The plan seeks to (i) build a dedicated passenger railway network through \nthe construction of 7,000 km of passenger dedicated lines by 2010; (ii) develop coal transport \ncorridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the \npoor  western  region  (to  34,000  km);  (iv)  build  international  corridors  at  the  southwest  and \nnorthwest  borders;  and  (v)  develop  a  nationwide  intermodal  container  network.  A  total \ninvestment  of  CNY1.5  trillion\u2014CNY1.25  trillion  for  construction  and  CNY250  billion  for  rolling \nstock\u2014is  planned  in  the  11FYP,  of  which  a  total  of  CNY465.2  billion  has  been  spent  in  2006 \nand 2007 (Appendix 3). \n \n\n2. \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n\n \n8. \nThe  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  railway  sector  involves \nhelping  (i) expand  the  railway  system  by  constructing  new  lines  in  unserved,  less-developed \nareas; (ii) modernize railways, enhance safety, and increase the capacity to improve efficiency \non  key  routes  of  the  national  railway  system;  (iii)  commercialize  railway  operations  to  sustain \nefficient  operations;  (iv)  promote  energy  conservation  and  environmental  sustainability;  and \n(v) increase railway competitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform. At \nthe heart of the strategy is the development of railways in poor, less-developed inland provinces \nto  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty. 3 ADB  has  provided  15  loans \ntotaling  over  $3.0  billion  to  finance  the  construction  of  about  1,921  km  of  eight  provincial \nrailways  operated  by  joint  ventures  with  MOR,  and  5,541  km  of  new  railway  lines  under  six \nnational railway projects, and a sector-wide intervention to improve safety on the PRC railway \nnetwork. ADB assistance to the sector has evolved from financing civil works on local railways \nto  supporting  major  national  corridors  with  much  less  financing  but  with  safety,  management \ninformation  system,  environmental,  and  other  technological  improvements  (Appendix  4).  The \nProject,  designed  to  promote  economic  growth  by  providing  safe  and  reliable  railway \ntransportation  in  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas  of  Chongqing  municipality  and \nHubei province, is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and the ADB strategy. \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB  is  financing  the  first  passenger-dedicated  corridor  under  another  loan.

The conclusion was that completed railway projects supported \ngeneral economic growth in the region and led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway \nstations. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\nPolicy Dialogue. Policy dialogue has been a feature of ADB\u2019s assistance to the railway \n9. \nsector  and  has  effectively  complemented  the  lending  operations.  Since  1989,  14  technical \nassistance (TA) initiatives totaling $6.6 million have been provided for institutional development \nfor dedicated passenger lines and local railways, tariff and organizational studies for the Jing\u2013\nJiu  railway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and  business  operations,  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment,  human  resource  development,  and  improvement  of  financial  management  and \naccounting systems. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR is centered on (i) poverty reduction as the \noverarching  objective  of  ADB  operations,  (ii)  full  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies, \n(iii) energy conservation and environmental sustainability, (iv) railway safety, (v) sector reforms, \n(vi)  marketing  and  business  development,  (vii) private  sector  participation  and  nongovernment \nfinancing, and (viii) regional cooperation. The railway development plan defines the major goals \nfor  the  PRC  railways  up  to  2020,  and  is  in  broad  agreement  with  ADB\u2019s  strategic  agenda. \nMOR\u2019s  proposed  reform  agenda  for  this  plan  seeks  to  (i)  study  and  learn  from  the  best \ninternational  practices  worldwide,  (ii)  separate  core  operations  from  noncore  transportation \nbusinesses,  (iii) rationalize  and  reduce  staff,  (iv) reform  the  railway  investment  and  financing \nsystem, and (v) establish specialized transportation companies. \n \n10.  MOR  is  taking  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  using  a  new \nmanagement  concept\u2014the  asset  operating  liability  system\u2014it  entered  into  management \ncontracts with railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The contracts \nhelped  improve  operational  and  financial  performance;  this  approach  was  subsequently \nextended to all railway administrations. The separation of core and noncore businesses is a key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation  business  was  reduced  from  1.89  million  in  1997  to  1.41  million  in  2006.  In  the \nnoncore  transportation  business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested.  To  provide  jobs  for  redundant  staff,  by  the  end  of  2006  MOR  had  set  up \n3,625 diversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business) employing more \nthan  321,544  staff  to  supply  equipment,  goods,  and  services  to  the  railway  industry.  In  1998, \nMOR initiated a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. \nIn 2005, it completed the transfer of 822 primary and middle schools, 46 vocational schools, and \n181 nursery schools, and 260 hospitals and medical units to local governments. One hundred \nbranch lines comprising 7,800 km were separated to improve productivity and reduce operating \nlosses.  (The  reform  agenda  matrix  is  in  Appendix  5.  Supplementary  Appendix  A  contains  a \nchronology of railway reforms.) \n \n11. \nPoverty Reduction. The strategic purpose of ADB\u2019s involvement in the railway sector is \nto create the conditions for sustainable economic growth to help improve living standards. The \nProject,  located  in  an  unserved  area,  has  the  potential  for  economic  growth,  once  improved, \ncost-effective transport access is provided. Identifying ways of enhancing the poverty reduction \nimpact  has  been  an  integral  part  of  project  planning  and  design.  Specific  features  include \n(i) providing employment during construction and operation of the CLR on a preferential basis to \npoor workers, including women;4 (ii) using locally produced materials (e.g., sand, stone, cement) \nthat  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and  economy;  (iii) providing  for  railway  station  area \ndevelopment;  (iv)  providing  station  access  roads  and  construction  access  roads;  and\n\n                                                 \n4  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the proportion of the poor in unskilled labor was 41% on the average and \n64% during peak construction. (ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors \non a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project. Manila.)  \n\n \n\n\f(v) supporting  the  poverty  reduction  programs  of  local  governments.5 The  Project  will  finance \nconstruction access roads to be handed over to the local villages after the construction. Local \ngovernments  have  a  5-year  plan  for  improving  the  road  network  and  transport  services  in  the \nproject area concurrently with the Project. These roads will reach all of the province-designated \npoverty villages. The Project and the local road development will increase the welfare gains for \nthe poor, including women, and help spread project benefits to the poverty villages.  \n \n12. \nEnergy  Conservation  and  Environmental  Sustainability.  Since  2006,  an  important \nelement of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR has been the enhancement of energy conservation \nand  environmental  sustainability.  The  11FYP  also \nidentifies  energy  conservation  and \nenvironmental sustainability as the two important areas of sustainable development and seeks \nplans and actions to achieve this. The ADB dialogue emphasizes the need to create awareness \nof  these  two  issues  through  such  means  as  including  energy  savings  and  environmental \nimprovements,  among  other  factors,  in  the  performance  evaluation  of  railway  administrations \nand  other  entities.  The  dialogue  encourages  the  use  of  energy-efficient  technologies  and \nenvironmental  improvements  in  railway  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  ADB  will \nassist MOR in drawing up a strategy for making the PRC railways more energy-efficient.6 Fuel-\nefficient  locomotives,  double-stack  container  trains,  \u201cgreen  corridors,\u201d  environment-friendly \nwaste  disposal  and  station  design,  and  fuel-efficient,  environment-friendly  maintenance \nequipment  are  part  of the  project  design.  This area  is  of  mutual  interest  to  other  development \npartners  like  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau \n(KfW), and the World Bank, and ADB has maintained close coordination with them. \n \n13. \nEnhancing  Safety. Safety is an integral part of a competitive, high-quality, and reliable \ntransportation system for people and goods. As PRC railways have modernized, introduced new \nconcepts  and  technologies,  and  increased  speeds,  the  safety  needs  have  changed.  MOR\u2019s \n11FYP recognizes this important aspect and seeks to attract foreign technology and know-how \nto meet these needs. ADB, for its part, emphasizes in its policy dialogue with MOR the need for \noperational  reforms  for  the  rail  network,  including  safety  improvements  in  construction, \noperation,  and  maintenance.  MOR  and  ADB  support  the  objective  of  safety  and  security  on \nPRC railways through the introduction of modern technologies, policy development, legislation, \nmonitoring  and  enforcement,  and  outreach  activities  (Appendix  6).  Since  2003,  ADB  has \nsupported investments in railway safety as part of ADB financing. ADB has initiated dialogue on \nadopting a sector-wide approach, rather than a project-based approach, to safety. A sector-wide \napproach is consistent with the network approach adopted for train operations in the PRC and \nhelps  in  providing  economies  of  scale,  and  better  management  of  emergencies,  preventive \nmaintenance,  and  accidents.  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  the  safety  and  transportation \ndepartments  of  MOR  to  develop  a  comprehensive  plan  for  the  institutional,  investment,  and \ntraining  needs  for  safety  in  PRC  railways  and  is  providing  a  TA  grant  of  $500,000  to  help  in \ndeveloping an emergency management system.7 In 2007, ADB approved a $100 million loan for \nenhancing safety on the PRC railway network.8  \n                                                 \n5  After some completed projects it was reported that about 40% of the poor at appraisal had been raised above the \npoverty line. In the case of the Hefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project, 41% of the poor were raised above the poverty line. \n(ADB. 1993. Report and Recommendation  of the President to the Board of Directors  on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Hefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project. Manila.) \n\n6  An  application  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  a  technical  assistance  under  the  Clean \nEnergy  Fund  for  PRC:  Preparing  the  Railway  Sector  Energy  Efficiency  Strategy  was  approved  on  29  February \n2008. \n\n7  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\nSector  Reforms.  ADB  is  supporting  the  institutional  reform  of  the  railway  sector  to \n14. \nseparate government and enterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing \nthe  competitiveness  of  the  railways.  ADB  has  actively  pursued  (i)  the  separation  of  the  core \ntransport business from the noncore transport business, (ii) the segmentation of passenger and \nfreight services, and (iii) the strengthening of the recently corporatized specialized transportation \ncompanies.  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR,  three  large  companies  handling \ncontainers,  special  goods,  and  express  parcel  have  been  set  up. 9  The  setting  up  of \npassenger-dedicated corridors with a separate institutional structure is a key ADB intervention.10 \nADB is assisting in the development of the institutional, marketing, business development, and \ntechnical standards for such initiatives.11  \n \n15. \nRationalization  of  staff  and  reduction  of  transportation  and  non-transportation  staff  is \nalso being pursued. On 18 March 2005, under a major restructuring exercise, MOR abolished \n41 subrailway administration bureaus, thereby removing one tier of railway management. By the \nend of 2006, the number of stations and sections had been reduced from 1,500 to 695. In the \nprocess, the staff was reduced by 22,000, operations were rationalized, productivity improved, \nand  efficiency  increased.  Recent  ADB  interventions  have  supported  operational  reforms  and \nemphasized  railway  safety,  including  the  introduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology,  faster \nspeeds,  dedicated  passenger  and  freight  lines,  a  modern  dispatch  control  system,  and \nhigh-quality  information  systems  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the \nWorld Trade Organization has intensified competition among different modes of transport, and \nthe  structure  of  transport  demand  is  likely  to  change.12 An  ADB  advisory  TA  for  policy  reform \nsupport  to  MOR13 analyzed  (i)  the  conflicting  roles  of  meeting  social  obligations  and  making \nprofits,  (ii)  increasing  modal  competition,  (iii) the  impact  of  fast  urbanization  and  economic \ndevelopment, and (iv) demand for better services. As a lead development partner in the sector, \nADB maintains close coordination with AFD, KfW, and the World Bank; and has developed with \nthese institutions a common approach to reforms and assistance (Appendix 3).  \n \n16.  Marketing  and  Business  Development.  As  the  PRC  progresses  to  a  market-driven \neconomy,  the  railways  will  need  to  compete  on  the  basis  of  price  and  service  quality  for \ndemand-based transportation services. New marketing and business development initiatives are \nneeded  for  both  freight  and  passenger  services  to  be  competitive.  In  past  projects,  ADB \nsupported project-specific studies to create marketing and business development opportunities, \nincluding  skills  and  knowledge  needed  for  market-oriented  operation,  and  awareness  of \nprofitable operations. The Project will continue these initiatives through a capacity development \nprogram for the project company. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  These  companies  are  the  China  Railway  Container  Transport  Company,  the  China  Railway  Express  Parcel \nCompany, and the China Railway Special Goods Company. The start-up process is ongoing. ADB and MOR have \nagreed on the separation of container businesses as part of the ADB-financed Yichang\u2013Wanzhou Railway Project. \n(ADB. 2003.

ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  encourages  increased  private \n17. \nsector  participation  in  the  railway  sector.  ADB  is  assisting  MOR  with  a  study  to  examine \nopportunities  for  diversified  financing  sources,  increased  private  sector  involvement,  and  the \npossibility  of  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  the  PRC  railways  sector.  In  2005  and  2006,  the \nState Council and MOR issued guidelines to facilitate reforms in the investment and financing \nsystem, which seek to reduce the threshold of the investment, encourage the private sector to \ninvest, and welcome strategic investors in railway financing.14 Strategic and private investors15 \nare  participating  in  the  project  equity  of  the  ADB-financed  Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei  Railway  Project \n(2006).  In  2006,  initial  public  offerings  for  Guangshen  Railway  Company16 and  Daqin  Railway \nCompany  were  made,  and  were  heavily  oversubscribed.  In  2007,  the  China  Railway  Tielong \nContainer  Logistics  Company  made  an  additional  public  offering  of  80  million  shares  for \nCNY700 million. \n \n18. \nUnder the Project, Chongqing province is exploring the possibility of diversified financing \nsources for CLR, including the private sector. A corporate entity has been set up to construct, \noperate, and manage CLR. Activities such as consulting services for construction supervision, \ntesting,  construction  contracts,  track  maintenance,  commercial  activities,  industrial  sidings, \nloading  and  unloading,  and  other  logistical  facilities  will  be  outsourced  through  open \ncompetition,  and  private  sector  involvement  will  be  encouraged  in  the  development  of  station \nfacilities,  local  tourism,  and  real  estate.  Extra-large  container  terminals  will  be  established  at \nChongqing  and  Wuhan  to  facilitate  the  participation  of  shipping  lines  and  freight  forwarders  in \nthe  business  of  rail-transported  containers.  All  of  these  actions  will  enhance  opportunities  for \nprivate sector participation. \n \n \n \nThe evaluation17 of ADB\u2019s assistance for the transport sector in the PRC concluded that \n19. \nADB\u2019s  program  for  railways  is  successful  and  that  its  strategic  priorities  for  the  subsector\u2014 \ncentered on building railways with modern technologies\u2014are well-aligned with the PRC\u2019s needs \nto  increase  railway  capacity  and  reduce  the  persistent  gap  between  demand  and  supply  as \nquickly  and  efficiently  as  possible.  ADB\u2019s  priority  of  improving  efficiency  and  commercial \norientation, and its emphasis on restructuring and reforming policy, is well-matched to evolving \ninstitutional reforms in railways.  \n \n20. \nThe  evaluation  and  experience  from  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  railway \nprojects  in  the  PRC  shows  strong  commitment  and  satisfactory  capabilities  of  executing \nagencies  for  project  implementation  (Appendix  7).  The  speed  of  implementation  has  generally \nexceeded  expectations  at  appraisal,  and  agencies  have  generally  complied  with  loan \ncovenants.

Of  the  15  ADB-supported  railway  projects,  10  have  been  completed  and  5  are \nunder implementation.18 \n \n21. \nPrevious  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  the \nprojects\u2019 influence areas. Their main impact is as follows: (i) new railway lines in less-developed \nregions  stimulated  economic  development,  resulting  in  higher  growth  rates  of  gross  domestic \nproduct  and  rural  incomes  compared  with  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario; 19  (ii) construction \nactivities  generated  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  employment  of  poor  workers,  including \nwomen,  who  would  otherwise  have  remained  unemployed  or  underemployed; 20 (iii)  service \nroads built for construction activities opened up and benefited rural communities in inaccessible \nareas;  (iv)  domestic  resource  mobilization  improved,  providing  additional  resources  for  social \nprograms 21  and  generating  employment;  (v)  supply  and  transportation  of  local  materials \nimproved;  (vi)  improved  and  lower-cost  transport  resulted  in  lower  prices  of  agricultural  inputs \n(such as fertilizers), which stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more income to farmers, \nincreased  the  mobility  of  rural  residents,  and  allowed  access  to  more  markets,  employment \nopportunities,  and  social  services  beyond  the  immediate  communities;  (vii)  counties  provided \nwith  new  railway  access  recorded  higher  gross  domestic  product  growth  rates  than  other \ncounties;  (viii)  the  investment  environment  improved,  and  secondary  and  tertiary  industries, \nwhich  generated  employment,  developed  rapidly;22 (ix)  the  consequent  shift  in  the  structure  of \nemployment  from  low-productivity  agriculture  to  higher-productivity  agro-processing  and  light \nindustry increased employment opportunities for women, whose incomes and social status then \nimproved;23 (x)  tourism  developed  as  railway  travel  became  more  affordable  and  convenient; \nand  (xi)  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures  were  taken  under  the  projects  in \naccordance  with  the  environmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs)  for  the  projects.

Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased yearly by 18.5%, from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 \nin 1998, compared with 10.3% in 1985\u20131992 (before the Project). \n\n20  The first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway generated a total of about 7.5 million person-days \nof employment; 4.1 million person-days, or about 55%, went to local poor people, who were thereby raised above \nthe poverty line. \n\n21  The  financial  revenue  of  10  poverty  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  that  are  traversed  by  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway \nincreased  from  CNY0.5  billion  in  1993  to  CNY1.4  billion  in  1998\u2014an  annual  increase  of  22.7%  compared  with \n12.3% in 1985\u20131992, before the construction of the railway. \n\n22  The  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway  facilitated  the  setting  up  of  many  resource-  and  agriculture-based  industries  in  Xingfeng \ncounty of Jiangxi province\u2014from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project completion. The number of businesses grew \nfrom 8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons employed in these businesses increased from \n18,484 in  1992  to  52,153  in  1998\u2014an  annual  increase  of  23%.  In  the  same  county,  the  number  of  people  living \nbelow the poverty line was reduced by 62%, from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998. \n\n23 Beneficial  income  and  social  impact,  particularly  on  women,  was  noted  in  the  influence  areas  of  the  Yaogu\u2013\n\nMaoming Railway and Guang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan Railway. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nsubstantially,  living  standards  have  improved,  and  poverty  has  been  reduced.  These  lessons \nlearned and experiences gained were considered in the design of the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nRationale \n\n22. \nThe  project  rationale  reflects  (i)  network  development;  (ii) capacity  enhancement; \n(iii) safety  enhancement;  (iv) support  for  the  PRC  railway  development  plan  and  the  western \nregion development strategy; and (v) promotion of pro-poor economic growth along the railway \nline and in the region, thereby reducing poverty. The Project will pursue the operational reforms, \nincluding  emphasis  on  safety  and  the  introduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology,  faster \nspeeds,  double-stack  container  operation  under  an  electrified  line,  modern  dispatch  control \nsystems, and high-quality information systems on the railway network. \n \n23. \nThe proposed CLR is part of the shortest east\u2013west corridor linking Shanghai, Qingdao, \nWuhan, Yichang, and other major cities and ports in the east to Chongqing and Chengdu in the \nwest.  The  proposed  alignment  for  the  CLR  is  369  km  shorter  than  the  existing  route  between \nShanghai and Chengdu. Traversing Hubei province, and Chongqing municipality, the proposed \nrailway  line  will  connect  with  Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Yichang\u2013Lichuan  in  the  east,  Chongqing\u2013\nHuaihua railway in the center, the proposed Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing24 and Xi\u2019an\u2013Chongqing main \nlines in the north, Chongqing\u2013Chengdu in the west, and Chongqing\u2013Kunming in the south. \n \n24. \nThe  project area  for  Chongqing\u2013Lichuan  is  largely  mountainous,  with  abundant  natural \nreserves  of  coal,  natural  gas,  nonferrous  materials,  and  famous  tourist  sites.  But  despite  the \nabundant  natural  resources,  many  people  are  poor  and  the  economic  growth  necessary  to \nreduce rural poverty has failed to materialize because of inadequate transport services and high \ncosts.  Local  governments  and  people  living  in  the  project  area  see  the  railway  as  a  key \ninvestment  for  addressing  this  problem.  The  development  of  the  railway  line  and  associated \ndevelopments are expected to stimulate industrial and natural resources development, promote \ntourism and related industries, generate employment and increase living standards, and help to \nreduce  poverty.  The  Project  is  a  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  program  for  the  integrated \ndevelopment  of  transportation  facilities,  which  includes  the  project  railway,  the  upgrading  of \nhighways, and the construction of link and access roads to the hinterland. Other infrastructure, \nsuch  as  water  supply  and  investment  to  improve  education  and  health  care  facilities,  are  also \nplanned. The railway will play an important role in facilitating the development and integration of \nthis poor and underdeveloped region. \n \nCLR  will  be  a  joint-venture  railway  owned  and  operated  by  MOR  and  the  Chongqing \n25. \nmunicipal  government.  Joint-venture  railways,  which  account  for  9,517  km  (2007)  of  the  PRC \nsystem,  have  substantial  managerial  and  financial  autonomy,  including  the  freedom  to  set \ntariffs, which are several times higher than those of the national network. Freight and passenger \ntraffic on joint-venture railways have grown faster than on national railways. Between 1996 and \n2007, passenger traffic grew from 2.2 billon passenger-km to 31.5 billion passenger-km (or by \n28%  yearly,  compared  with  7%  on  the  national  railway  network),  and  freight  traffic  rose  from \n12.3  billion  ton-km  to  155.2  billion  ton-km  (or  by  26.5%  yearly,  compared  with  5%  on  the \nnational railway network). Joint-venture railways are more efficient, employing only 8\u201310 people \nper km, compared with about 25 people per km for national railways. The project company will \nemploy 8\u201310 people per km. \n \n\n                                                 \n24 The proposed loan for PRC: Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing Railway Development Project was circulated for consideration by \n\nADB for Board approval on 18 November 2008.  \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\nThe Project is a key intervention in the railway sector, with many technical, operational, \n26. \nsafety,  economic,  and  financial  benefits.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  transportation  costs \nsignificantly  compared  to  existing  bus  and  truck  fares  thereby  providing  a  cheaper  and  more \naffordable mode of transport. ADB financing is playing a catalytic role in financing this project. \nCLR will introduce double-stack container operation, under an electrified track. This will increase \nthe  throughput  and  carrying  capacity,  reduce  the  land  requirement,  and  reduce  the  energy \nconsumption and emission per ton-km\u2014all of which will lead to a more affordable, faster, cheap, \nsafe, energy-efficient, and more environment-friendly mode of transport in the region. Running \nconventional trains and double-stack container trains under a common track is a technological \nchallenge  that  will  need  higher  axle-loads,  adjusted  tunnel  and  bridge  dimensions,  and  new \ntechnologies for power transfer from overhead electric traction to adapt to the increased height \ndifference between conventional trains and the double-stack container trains. A corporate entity \nhas been set up to construct, operate, and manage the CLR, and that it will help enhance the \nfinancial viability and private sector participation. ADB is assisting in institutional, marketing, and \nbusiness development for the project company. The agreed tariffs are affordable and financially \nviable. When complete, the Project will provide a shorter link to the west, releasing capacity on \nthe existing railway lines.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n27. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  an  improved  transport  system  in  the  Shanghai\u2013\nChengdu  corridor  that  supports  socioeconomic  development  and  the  western  development \nstrategy. This will be achieved through the provision of efficient, affordable, environment-friendly \nand  energy-efficient  railway  transportation  in  unserved,  less-developed  areas,  creating  the \nconditions  necessary  for  developing  local  resources  and  generating  employment  and  income-\nenhancing opportunities.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n28. \nThe  Project  comprises  (i)  the  construction  of  259  km  of  double-track,  electrified, \nstandard-gauge  Class  I  railway  from  Chongqing  to  Lichuan;  (ii)  the  construction  of  eight  new \nrailway stations complete with facilities; (iii) safety initiatives, including the provision of modern \ntechnology  and  equipment  to  enhance  safety;  (iv)  the  provision  of  signaling,  communication, \nand  management  information  systems;  (v)  training  in  the  use  and  maintenance  of  modern \nequipment; (vi) consulting services for construction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and \nmarketing  and  business  development;  and  (vii)  institutional  strengthening.  The  key  inputs \nneeded  for  project  implementation  are  civil  works,  equipment,  consultants,  MOR,  and  project \ncompany  staff  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  B  for  characteristics  of  the  Chongqing\u2013Lichuan \nRailway).  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nEnergy  Benefits. Railways are a more energy-efficient and environment-friendly mode \n29. \nof  transport  than  road  transport\u20146\u201310  times  more  efficient,  by  some  estimates.  The  rolling \nresistance of a steel wheel on a rail is much less than that of rubber tires on a pavement. The \nUnited  States  Department  of  Energy  has  estimated 25  the  energy  intensity  of  rail  freight  at \n345 British  thermal  units  (BTU)  per  ton-mile  and  road  freight  at  3,476  BTU  per  ton-mile.  This \n\n                                                 \n25 US Department of Energy. 2006. Transportation Energy Data Book, Edition 26. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nindicates that rail is about 10 times as energy-efficient as truck transport\u2014an estimate similar to \nthat  made  by  Canadian  researchers.26 According  to  the  International  Energy  Agency  report27 \nand  fuel  data  from  the  China  Statistical  Yearbook  2006,28 the  diverted  traffic  from  road  to  rail, \nand from existing rail to CLR, will result in a benefit (on account of reduced fuel consumption) of \nCNY204 million per year from 2014.  \n \n30. \nEnvironment Benefits. There is a direct relationship between energy consumption and \nemission  of  harmful  pollutants,  and  rail  transport  emits  far  fewer  harmful  elements  compared \nwith road. These emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, sulfur \noxides, and suspended particles. At the specific fuel usage and emission rates for the PRC, the \ndiversion of traffic from road to rail will reduce CO2 emissions by 137,000 tons by 2014, and this \nfigure is projected to rise to 207,000 tons by 2020 and 424,000 by 2033 (cumulative savings of \n5.1  million  tons  from  2014\u20132033).  The  reductions  will  result  in  an  annual  benefit  of  CNY17 \nmillion by 2014, increasing to CNY53 million by 2033. \n \n31. \nIntermodal  Transport  or  Container  Transport.  The  Project  will  promote  railway  and \nmultimodal  transport  of  goods  in  the  region  by  introducing  double-stack  container  operation \nunder an electrified track, which will reduce land use, increase carrying capacity by 60% on the \nsame  track,  improve  energy  and  environment  efficiency  by  40%\u201360%,  and  move  cargo  more \nsafely and efficiently. MOR will construct two extra-large container terminals at Chongqing and \nWuhan  to  (i)  attract  high-value  traffic  on  the  railways;  (ii)  promote  intermodal  traffic;  and \n(iii) encourage  private  sector  shippers  and  freight  forwarders  to  use  the  facility  for  export  and \nimport of cargo to other parts of the PRC, and ports in the east and Yunnan in the south. The \nconstruction of these container terminals will be financed by MOR and completed by 2010. \n \n32. \nCorporate  Governance. ADB\u2019s policy reform agenda in the railway sector emphasizes \nMOR restructuring, commercial operations, support for the autonomous management of railway \noperations,  human  resources  development,  and \nfinancial  management  and \naccounting  systems.  The  setting  up  of  the  joint-venture  railways  is  a  key  ADB  intervention. \nUnder  the  Project,  a  corporate  entity  has  been  set  up  and  its  capacity  development  will  be \nsupported.  ADB-financed  consulting  services  will  assist  in  strengthening  the  institutional, \nmarketing, and business development functions of the project company. \n \n33. \nOpportunities  for  the  Private  Sector.  The  project  company  will  outsource  activities \nsuch  as  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  testing,  construction  contracts,  track \nmaintenance,  and  industrial  sidings  by  open  competition.  Private  sector  initiatives  such  as \nonboard  train  services  (including  catering,  cleaning,  and  loading  and  unloading  at  railway \nstations) will be promoted. Station space will be developed and rented out by open competition, \nand industrial sidings, hotels, restaurants, and other logistic facilities will be encouraged in the \nvicinity of stations. \n \n34. \nReforms.  ADB  has  engaged  MOR  in  dialogue  to  enhance  policy  reform  during  the \nproject processing, and this will continue. Equity participation by the Chongqing municipality and \nthe setting up of a corporate entity to construct, operate, and manage the Project are significant \nsteps to be taken. The possibility of diversified financing sources has also been explored. The \nChina  Construction  Bank  (CCB)  has  already  committed  itself  to  providing  financing.

Extensive  consultations,  including \n35. \nsurveys, have involved about 7,300 people\u2014local villagers, tourists, businesspersons, transport \nusers,  and \nin \n(i) understanding  public  opinion  about  the  proposed  railway;  (ii) conducting  the  environmental, \neconomic, and social assessments; (iii) planning the resettlement; and (iv) identifying the roles \nof  the  various  stakeholders.  Leading  groups  have  been  formed  in  the  prefectures  with  the \nparticipation of relevant government agencies, including poverty reduction offices; the All-China \nWomen\u2019s Federation; and health, civil affairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus. The local governments \nhave  given  their  assurances  that  the  consultation  process  will  be  continued  to  finalize  the \nproject  design  and \nlivelihood, \nrehabilitation, and environmental management measures. \n \nSmall-Business  Development  Opportunities.  The  Project  includes  eight  railway \n36. \nstations,  which  will  be  connected  to  villages,  townships,  and  counties  by  roads  and  other \ntransport networks. These stations and the station access roads, and other link roads, will help \nin  the  development  of  small  businesses  and  commercial  activities,  including  the  setting  up  of \nsmall  shops,  kiosks,  local  handicraft  shops,  and  areas  where  local  people  can  sell  local  fruits \nand agro-products. The local governments will ensure that the railway stations and surrounding \nareas  are  developed  with  local  communities  to  promote  local  businesses,  income-generating \nactivities,  and  other  opportunities  that  can  benefit  all  communities,  especially  the  poor  and \nwomen,  and  they  have  agreed  to  provide  entrepreneurial  training  and  start-up  capital \n(microfinance)  for  small  businesses  to  local  people.  The  Project  will  also  support  tourism \ndevelopment \nlocal \ngovernments have been successful in providing support to the communities (including the poor) \nto promote tourism businesses such as village homestays and handicrafts. The provincial and \nlocal  governments  have  agreed  to  increase  such  support  by  reallocating  some  of  the  tax \nrevenue increase from the Project. \n \nComplementary  Development  Initiatives.  ADB  held  extensive  discussions  with  the \n37. \nChongqing  and  Hubei  provincial  and  local  governments  about  providing  road  access,  good \ndrinking  water,  and  telephone  connectivity  to  all  the  poverty  villages  along  the  alignment,  to \nenhance development impact in the project area. The provincial and local governments agreed \nto provide for these in the 11FYP. The local governments agreed, in principle, to provide road \naccess to 93 villages, drinking water to 656 villages, and telephone connections to 57 villages \nby the end of 2014. ADB also dialogued with local governments on the possibility of reallocating \npart  of  the  construction  tax  revenue  (3.4%  of  the  value  of  the  civil  works  contract)  to \ndevelopment programs in the project area. The local governments agreed to reallocate part of \nthe tax revenue to relevant agencies for that purpose. \n \nD. \n \n38. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $3,071.11 million.  The  project  investment \nplan is summarized in Table 1 and its details can be found in Appendix 9. The cost estimates \nare  based  on  quantities  derived  from  preliminary  engineering  designs and  unit  rates  reflecting \nmarket  prices  for  goods  and  materials,  and  include  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and environmental monitoring. \n\nin  Chongqing  and  Hubei,  both \n\ntourist  destinations.

The loan will have a term of 26 years, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined according to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15%, conversion options that may be \nexercised according to ADB\u2019s loan regulations and conversion guidelines, and other terms and \nconditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons \nfor  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  according  to  these  terms \nand  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nADB will finance selected contract packages to be procured under the ADB loan; these \n40. \nrelate,  among  others, \ntraction;  signaling, \ncommunication, and other equipment; and international consulting services. CCB and MOR will \nfinance the remaining foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost will be financed by MOR \nand the Chongqing municipal government (CMG), and cofinanced through a loan from the CCB. \nCCB has appraised the Project and has provided a commitment letter to MOR. The CCB loan is \nrepayable over 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at a lending rate currently at 6.6% \nper  year.  CMG  will  finance  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs;  this  will  be  its  equity \ncontribution.  MOR  and  CMG  have  made  budgetary  provisions  for  the  counterpart  funds.

MOR will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project implementation. The \nForeign Capital and Technical Import Center (FCTIC), under MOR, will coordinate the tasks of \nthe project management office and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, and reporting \nto  ADB.  A  project  company  (a  limited-liability  company  under  the  PRC  Company  Law),  with \nheadquarters  at  Chongqing  has  been  set  up,  which  will  implement  the  Project.  The  project \ncompany  will  (i)  assist  in  the  construction  of  the  project  railway  and  manage  and  operate  the \nproject railway after its construction; and (ii) develop and implement adequate and transparent \nbusiness  development  mechanisms,  and  accounting  and  reporting  systems.  The  project \ncompany  is  headed  by  a  director  general  and  assisted  by  an  adequate  number  of  suitably \nqualified professional staff with experience in railway engineering, financial, and administrative \nmatters,  and  in  the  implementation  of  projects  financed  by  international  financial  institutions. \nThe  company  has  set  up  on-site  construction  management  offices  along  the  project  route.  To \ndevelop the project management, business development, and marketing capacity of the project \ncompany, assistance will be provided through project-financed consulting services.  \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n42. \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years. Civil works for CLR will start in May 2009 \nand will be completed in 5 years. Trial operations will start in January 2014 and will go on for a \nyear before commercial operations begin (Appendix 10). \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \n43. \namended from time to time). ADB will finance the procurement of materials and equipment as \ndescribed in the procurement plan (Appendix 11). Contracts valued at $1 million or more will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Contracts valued at less than $1 million will \nbe procured through international competitive bidding or national competitive bidding, according \nto the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999) and subject to clarifications agreed on with ADB. \nBelow  $100,000,  procurement  will  follow  the  shopping  procedure.  MOR  will  select  tendering \ncompanies  on  a  competitive  basis  to  handle  international  bidding.  The  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all documents and \ncontracts during the bidding for, and implementation of, the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nThe  Government  will  engage  and  finance  the  services  of  qualified  national  consultants \nfor  (i)  detailed  project  design;  (ii)  the  preparation  of  technical  specifications;  (iii)  construction \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nthe \n\n(iv)  construction  quality  assurance; \n\nthe  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \nimpact  assessment,  evaluation  of  poverty \n\n(v)  environmental  supervision  and \nresettlement  plan;  and \nreduction,  and  project \n\nsupervision; \nmanagement; \n(vi) \n(vii) socioeconomic \nperformance monitoring. \n \n45. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  8  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  to  strengthen  the  institutional,  marketing,  and  business  development  functions  of  the \nproject company. The terms of reference for the international consultants\u2014to be recruited through \nquality- and  cost-based  selection  (80%  technical  and  20%  financial)  and  simplified  technical \nproposal,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time)\u2014are in Appendix 12. The provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included \nin all invitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n5. \n\n46. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy has been explained to, and discussed with the Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  though  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts  of  MOR,  the  project  company,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n47. \nIn  relation  to  the  Project,  MOR  will  ensure  that  (i)  a  supervisory  body  is  established  to \nprevent undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources are made available \nfor its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the supervision division of MOR is \nlocated in offices involved in the bidding, construction, and other operational activities under the \nProject; and (iii) periodic inspections of the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements  are  carried  out.  MOR  and  the  project  company  shall  also  initiate  liaison  meetings \nwith  the  prosecutor\u2019s  office,  as  needed,  to  discuss  any  warnings  about,  or  information  on, \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n48. \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large contracts, \ndirect  payment,  reimbursement,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used.  If  the  Government \ninitially  funds  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  followed.  To \nfacilitate  disbursements,  MOR  has  requested  the  creation  of  an  imprest  account29 after  loan \neffectiveness.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  either  the  estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. To expedite \nfunds flow and simplify documentation, the statement-of-expenditures procedure will be used for \nthe  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures  not  exceeding  $200,000  per  individual  payment.  The  reimbursement,  liquidation, \nor replenishment of payments in excess of the statement-of-expenditures ceiling will require full \nsupporting documentation. The financial assessment questionnaire indicates that the Project will \nhave  an  adequate  financial  management  system  in  place.  The  funds  from  ADB  loan  will  flow \n\n                                                 \n29 Imprest accounts are used in three ongoing loans in the PRC. Their utilization performance is satisfactory. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n \n\ndirectly  to  MOR,  the  EA,  who  will  be  responsible  for  disbursements  for  the  contract  packages \nfinanced by ADB (details in Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49. \nThe MOR and the project company will maintain separate accounts for the Project and \nhave  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  an  external  auditor \naccording  to  auditing  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  MOR  and  the  project  company,  through \nMOR, will submit to ADB, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of \nsuch audited project accounts and financial statements and auditor\u2019s reports, all in English. The \naudit of such financial statements will include, as part of the auditor\u2019s report, (i) an assessment \nof the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with respect to project expenditures \nand other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment of compliance with loan covenants and ADB \nrequirements  for  project  management,  (iii)  an  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  statement-of-\nexpenditures  procedure,  and  (iv)  an  opinion  on  the  use  of  an  imprest  account.  The  project \ncompany,  through  MOR,  will  also  submit  its  audited  financial  statements  covering  income \nstatements,  balance  sheets,  and  cash  flow  statements  during  the  first  3  years  of  commercial \noperations of  the  project  railway, within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  To  ensure \nthat  effective  internal  control  systems  and  checks  and  balances  are  put  in  place,  the  project \ncompany will establish an internal audit unit within the company. The unit will independently test \nfinancial  transactions  to  ensure  the  safe  custody  of  the  project-financed  assets,  and  report \ndirectly to the project company\u2019s board of directors. \n \n50. \nThe  project company  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of \nproject implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports through MOR. Within 3 months \nof completion, MOR will submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51.  MOR has agreed to a set of indicators for evaluating the performance of the Project in \nrelation to its impact, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. The indicators, to be reviewed at the \nstart  of  project  implementation,  comprise  (i)  economic  development  and  socioeconomic \nindicators, (ii) transport costs and time for passenger and freight services, (iii) transport services \nand  transport  charges,  (iv)  accident  rates,  (v)  financial  sustainability,  (vi)  county  and  sample \nvillage  incomes,  (vii) access  to  social  services,  and  (viii)  jobs  created  in  construction  and \nmaintenance.  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  MOR  and  the  project  company  will \nestablish  baseline  and  target  values  for  the  indicators.  The  indicators  will  be  measured  at \nproject  inception,  completion,  and  3  years  later,  and  compared  with  the  baseline.  Where \nrelevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender  (Appendix  13).  MOR  will  recruit  qualified \nconsultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help  establish  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem,  and  train  the  project  company  staff  in  its  use.  The  main  sources  of  data  are \n(i) government  sources  (secondary  data),  (ii) a  household  socioeconomic  sample  survey,  and \n(iii) participatory rapid appraisal. MOR will submit to ADB a report summarizing the key findings \nof monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n52. \nADB,  MOR,  and  the  project  company  will  carry  out  periodic  reviews,  as  well  as  a \nmidterm review, of the Project, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, \nenvironmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  resettlement,  economic,  financial,  and  other  relevant \naspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. \n\n \n\n\fThe  review  will  examine  progress  in  sector  reforms,  policy  development,  resettlement, \nenvironment, poverty impact, and compliance with covenants in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n53. \nThe  project  benefits  and  impact  have  been  assessed,  along  with  the  potential  risks \nassociated with the Project. The combined benefits and impact will outweigh the costs, and net \nbenefits will accrue to the project area. \n \nA. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n54. \nThe  traffic  forecast  is  based  on  forecasts  prepared  by  the  Second  Survey  and  Design \nInstitute  and  the  assessment  of  TA  consultants  after  considering  expected  economic  growth, \npopulation  increase,  tourism  development  potential, local government  development  plans,  and \nmarket  surveys.  The  passenger  volume  on  the  CLR  is  forecast  to  grow  from  8.38 billion \npassenger-km  in  2014  to  25.78  billion  passenger-km  in  2033,  for  an  average  growth  rate  of \n6.4% yearly. The freight traffic on the CLR corridor is forecast, on the basis of similar factors, to \nincrease  from  about  7.16 billion  ton-km  in  2014  to  20.13  billion  ton-km  in  2033,  or  by  5.9% \nyearly.  The  projected  volumes  can  be  accommodated  by  the  CLR  and  justify  project \nconstruction. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n55. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated through a comparison of the \nwith- and without-project situations, using constant 2008 economic prices. The CLR will reduce \nthe  cost  of  transport  to  and  from  the  poor  parts  of  Chongqing  and  Hubei  province.  The \neconomic  costs  include  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  costs,  and  the  value  of \nagricultural production from land lost permanently. The economic benefits include (i) operating \ncost  savings  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic;  (ii)  time  saved  as  a  result  of  the  diversion  of \npassenger  traffic  from  buses  trucks,  and  other  rail  lines;  (iii)  transport  benefits  generated; \n(iv) tourism benefits; (v) road infrastructure and maintenance costs avoided; (vi) shipper savings \nresulting  from  increased  railway  competition;  (vii)  road  accidents  avoided;  (viii)  reduced \npollution; (ix) energy savings; and (x) national productivity benefits. The project EIRR is 16.7%, \nindicating that the Project is economically viable (Appendix 14). Sensitivity analysis confirms the \nrobustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key  variables,  such  as  a  20% \nreduction  in  benefits,  do  not  significantly  affect  economic  viability.  The  civil  works  cost  would \nhave to increase by 60.0% over the estimate for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. \nFreight  benefits  would  have  to  fall  by  44.0%  and  passenger  benefits  by  936.8%.  Given  the \nexperience  in  the  PRC  railway  sector,  variations  of  such  magnitude  are  unlikely.  Project  risks \nwere  quantified  through  the  statistical  method,  i.e.,  by  considering  the  possible  value  for  key \nvariables and the probability of their occurrence. The result shows minimal probability of EIRR \nfalling  below  12%.  Distribution  analysis,  undertaken  by  determining  the  project  effects  for \nvarious  beneficiaries,  indicates  that  a  large  portion  of  net  benefits  will  accrue  to  project  users \nand the economy. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Benefits \n\n56. \nFinancial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  project  company,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Financial  Analysis  and  Management  of  Projects  (2005),  to  assess  the \nfinancial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  railway.  The  projected  financial  statements  indicate \nthat  financial  revenues  will  be  sufficient  to  cover  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  income \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n \n\ntaxes, and debt service, and to provide a reasonable rate of return. The financial evaluation was \nundertaken in real terms, using constant 2008 prices. The project cost estimates and financial \nprojections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects \nof foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental costs and benefits were \nderived under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return, after tax, \nis 5.48%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also after tax, of \n2.80%.  The  Project  is  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses \nindicate that the financial internal rate of return for the Project is robust under most conditions. \n \n57. \nConsolidated  financial  statements  for  the  project  company  have  been  prepared. \nAccording to the consultant\u2019s estimates, the project company is projected to have a sound and \nsustainable financial performance over the operating period (Appendix 15). Financial ratios have \nbeen discussed and covenanted. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Assessment \n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  ADB  environmental  category  A.  An  EIA,  prepared  by  the \n58. \nSecond Survey and Design Institute for the Project, was approved by the State Environmental \nProtection  Administration  on  24  March  2008.  MOR  has  endorsed  the  summary  environmental \nimpact assessment, which was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and uploaded to the ADB \nwebsite on 4 January 2008.  \n \n59. \nThe  potential  adverse  environmental  impact  of  the  Project  includes  (i)  noise  and \nvibration  impact  on  nearby  residents,  (ii)  soil  erosion  from  cut  and  fill  activities,  (iii)  impact  on \nsurface water quality of adjacent waterways, and (iv) impact on public health and safety. \n \n60. \nThe EIA concluded that the adverse environmental impact can be successfully mitigated \nthrough best practices and appropriate technologies. The implementation of the environmental \nmanagement,  mitigation,  and  monitoring  programs  included  in  the  EIA  will  ensure  compliance \nwith  ADB  and  government  environmental  guidelines  and  procedures.  Internal  and  external \nmonitoring and audits will be conducted to ensure that standards and regulations are followed. \nAn independent monitoring agency will be hired to carry out external monitoring and evaluation \nwork during implementation. \n \nE. \n\nImpact on Poverty \n\nThe  railway  will  traverse  seven  districts  and  counties  in  the  eastern  part  of  Chongqing \n61. \ncity and one county in the western part of Hubei province; two of these are designated national \nor  provincial  poverty  counties.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  5.5  million  people  in  the  project \narea;  of  these,  3.6  million  (65%)  are  in  the  countryside  and  include  590,000  poor  people \n(16.4%) with a net income per capita of less than CNY900 in 2005. There are 681 designated \npoverty  villages,  many  of  which  lack  access  to  potable  water.  Poverty  is  concentrated  in  the \nthree  counties  (Fengdu,  Shizhu  and  Lichuan)  farthest  from  Chongqing,  which  are  isolated  by \nmountains  and  poor  transport  facilities.  The  links  between  poverty,  topography,  and  poor \ntransport systems are apparent in the project area. Poverty in this area is caused by (i) adverse \nenvironmental and weather conditions and limited farmland (e.g., mountains, water scarcity, and \nsoil  erosion);  (ii) geographical  remoteness  and  isolation,  and  high  transport  costs;  (iii)  limited \naccess to credit for rural enterprises; (iv) lack of access to good social and health-care facilities; \nand  (v)  high  cost  of  middle-  and  higher-level  education.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 16. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nDuring  construction,  about  119,000  person-years  of  work  will  be  created  for  unskilled \n62. \nlaborers; of this total 50% or more (59,500 person-years with total wages of CNY446 million) will \nbe  targeted  at  the  poor.  The  use  of  locally  produced  materials  for  railway  construction  will \ngenerate  an  additional  22,000  person-years  of  work  for  unskilled  laborers,  with  total  wages  of \nCNY165.5 million. The construction tax revenue will be reallocated to counties and used for a \nrange of poverty reduction and social activities. Priority will be given to women, people affected \nby  resettlement,  ethnic  minorities,  and  other  vulnerable  people.  Once  the  new  railway  starts \noperation in 2014, an estimated 3,530 direct and indirect jobs will be created with total wages of \nCNY35.3 million annually. The project\u2019s eight new railway stations will be connected to the road \nnetwork accessible by all villages, including the poor, and will create various jobs, thus helping \ndistribute the benefits in the project area. There will be enough space in and around the stations \nfor local area development, and local governments will support the poor, women, ethnic groups, \nand other vulnerable people in setting up shop and selling local specialties and other goods and \nservices. The new railway will provide significantly cheaper and more affordable transportation \ncompared  to  roads.  All  of  this  direct  and  indirect  impact  will  provide  opportunities  for  poor \nfamilies  to  (i) move  away  from  unsustainable,  mountainous  farmlands;  (ii)  provide  a  cheaper \nmode  of  travel;  (iii)  have  better  access  to  markets,  and  advanced  educational  and  health \nfacilities,  especially  for women;  and  (iv)  build  a  sustainable future  in  new  centers  of  economic \nactivity. \n \nF. \n\nResettlement Impact \n\n63. \nThe  project  railway  alignment  will  affect  29  townships  and  84  villages  as  it  passes \nthrough  the  seven districts  and  counties  that  compose  the  project  area.  An  estimated \n711 hectares of land will be permanently acquired; about 62.3% of this is now under cultivation \nand  the  rest  (37.1%)  is  predominately  forestland.  Since  the  railway  will  require  only  a  narrow \ncorridor, the average loss of land per household is estimated to be 15%; this means that about \n35,000  persons  will  be  partially  affected.  The  Project  will  temporarily  occupy  an  estimated \n674 hectares during construction. Also, 391,000 square meters of structures will be demolished; \nof  these,  86%  will  be  residential  structures,  and  5,314  persons  will  therefore  have  to  be \nrelocated. The summary resettlement plan is shown in Appendix 17. \n \n64.  MOR,  in  consultation  with  the  provincial  and  local  governments,  has  prepared  a \nresettlement plan based on the feasibility study, surveys in 48 affected villages, 337 household \nsurveys,  local  government  statistics,  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and \naffected  households.  The  impact  is  spread  thinly  over  a  long,  narrow  corridor. 30  Local \ngovernment  land  administration  bureaus,  in  conjunction  with  railway  construction  support \noffices, will be responsible for implementing resettlement; many activities will be carried out by \ntownship  officials  and  village  committees.  The  estimated  resettlement  cost  is  $69.93 million, \nexcluding contingencies. The Chongqing municipal government will fund the entire cost of land \nacquisition and resettlement, as an equity contribution to the Project. The resettlement budget \nwill  be  adjusted  to  conform  to  the  actual  measurement  of  physical  losses,  market  prices,  and \nfinal  compensation  rates.  Affected  people  have  been  consulted  about  the  likely  impact  during \nthe  feasibility  and  preliminary  design  stages.  Resettlement  information  booklets,  in  the  local \nlanguage,  have  been  distributed  to  the  affected  villages.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been \nendorsed by MOR and uploaded to the ADB website on 4 September 2007. MOR will submit an \nupdated resettlement plan to ADB by 15 December 2008. MOR and municipal land acquisition \n\n                                                 \n30 Land use for railways is much less compared with that of a highway of equivalent capacity (a 16-lane highway is \n\nrequired to equal the cargo-carrying capacity of a double-track railway).   \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\nand resettlement offices, in collaboration with the county resettlement offices, will be responsible \nfor internal supervision and monitoring.  \n \n65. \nThe  project  area  includes  792,000  people  with  ethnic  minority  nationalities,  which \nrepresent 14.4% of the project area\u2019s population. The main ethnic group in the project area, the \nTujia,  has  been  integrated  with  the  Han  for  nearly  200  years  and  shares  the  same \nsocioeconomic  conditions,  as  investigations  showed,  and  there  have  been  a  large  number  of \nintermarriages. An estimated 200 Tujia households will be relocated and about 1,000 will have \npartial loss of farmland. Since some of the affected minority villages are poor, the resettlement \nplan  specifically  provides  for  livelihood  training,  employment  in  construction,  access  to  rural \ncredit,  assistance  with  house  construction,  and  social  security.  The  Project  includes  a  social \ndevelopment  action  plan  (SDAP)  to  enhance  the  benefits  to  poor  or  vulnerable  people  in  the \nproject area. Tujia minorities are a target group in the SDAP (Appendix 18). \n \nG. \n\nSocial and Gender Aspects \n\nThe  Project  will  generate  job  opportunities  (skilled  and  unskilled)  for  the  poor,  ethnic \n66. \nminorities,  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  which  will  help  develop  their  job  skills. \nSufficient  areas  for  income-generating  activities  will  be  designated  in  and  around  the  station \nareas.  Through  several  ongoing  programs  along  the  alignment,  the  All-China  Women\u2019s \nFederation  will  specifically  address  the  needs  of  women  and  children.  The  federation  will \noperate even more actively in the project area so that women are able to take full advantage of \nadditional work and income opportunities facilitated by the Project to build businesses that help \nsustain  their  families.  The  expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  will  help  generate \nadditional long-term employment opportunities for both men and women. Afforestation activities \nwill provide additional employment opportunities for women relatively close to their homes. \n \n67. \nThe  construction  and  operation  of  the  railway  could  have  an  impact  on  the  spread  of \nHIV/AIDS and/or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) because of the large number of workers \nduring  construction.  The  project  area  has  much  smaller  numbers  of  HIV/AIDS-infected  people \nthan  other  parts  of  the  PRC,  according  to  discussions  with  local  health  bureaus.  Local \ngovernments have an active public information program for HIV/AIDS awareness, including the \ndistribution of leaflets and posters, and radio and television programs. The health departments \nin these provinces have carried out awareness programs, HIV/AIDS/STIs voluntary counseling \nand testing, and prevention programs; these will be stepped up and monitored closely. During \nthe construction period, the county governments along the alignment will raise public awareness \namong workers and communities. MOR has experience in ensuring that contractors implement \nawareness  and  prevention  programs.  Medical  clinics  have  been  established  in  the  area  of \nconstruction camps, and HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns and preventive measures for workers \nand communities have been organized. These measures have effectively managed the potential \nrisks of HIV/AIDS/STI transmission and other diseases, and will be applied to the Project.  \n \n68. \nAn  SDAP  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  local  governments  to  enhance  the \nproject  benefits;  ensure  that  adverse  impact  is  avoided  or  mitigated;  and  increase  economic \ndevelopment benefits to the poor, women, Tujia people, and the vulnerable in an equitable and \nsustainable manner (Appendix 18). The SDAP will (i) enhance job opportunities for local people; \n(ii)  provide  training  and  vocational  programs  for  the  poor,  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  the \nvulnerable;  (iii)  support  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  programs;  (iv)  support  income \nrecovery  programs  for  people  affected  by  resettlement;  (v)  provide  awareness  and  prevention \nprograms  for  safety  during  construction  and  operation;  and  (vi)  promote  local  economic \ndevelopment.  The  plan  will  be  implemented  with  the  participation  of  relevant  government \n\n \n\n\fagencies  at  the  local  level\u2014including  poverty  alleviation  offices,  the  All-China  Women\u2019s \nFederation, and health, civil affairs, labor, and ethnic affairs bureaus. Leading groups have been \nformed to continue the process of consultation and coordination among various agencies during \nimplementation. \n \nH. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n69. \nThe  Project  has  been  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  In  view  of  the  experience \nwith  previous  railway  projects,  traffic  demand  has  been  estimated  conservatively.  Sensitivity \ntests indicate that economic circumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the \nProject to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay \nthe  realization  of  benefits.  MOR  has  successfully  built  railway  lines,  such  as  the  Ganzhou\u2013\nLongyan, Hefei\u2013Xi\u2019an, and Jing\u2013Jiu railways. Government, MOR, CMG support for the Project \nand  its  preparation  contributes  to  reducing  the  potential  risk  of  implementation  delays. \nEnvironmental risks will be mitigated by the  measures in the environmental management plan \n(EMP) and will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \n70. \nIntermodal competition among railways and roads will create market risks for the project \nrailway. However, the existing road is already congested and capacity constraints are expected \nto worsen. Traffic surveys indicate that the railway has several advantages: lower fares, shorter \ntravel times, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of the joint-venture \nrailway will help lower the risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific  Assurances.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has \n\n71. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nReform  measures.

Despite government efforts to increase the country\u2019s transport capacity, \n1. \nserious  constraints  and  bottlenecks  remain,  especially  in  the  road  and  railway  sectors.  By  the \nend  of  2007,  the  PRC\u2019s  railway  system  of  78,000 kilometers  (km)  comprised  63,600  km  of \nnational railways and 14,400 km of joint venture and local railways.  From 1978, when economic \nreforms were first introduced, to 2007, the PRC experienced sustained rapid economic growth. \nThis  resulted  in  a  correspondingly  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  transportation.  Passenger \ntransport grew by 9% yearly and freight transport by 7.6% yearly during the period. Railways are \nthe  principal  mode  of  freight  transport  in  the  PRC,  accounting  for  47.5%  of  total  freight  ton-\nkilometers (ton-km) in 2006, followed by 27.9% for inland waterways and sea-to-shore shipping, \n21.1%  for  roads,  3.3%  for  pipelines,  and  0.2%  for  civil  aviation.  Road  traffic  accounted  for \n52.8%  of  total  passenger-kilometers  (pass-km),  followed  by  railways  with  34.5%,  civil  aviation \nwith 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%.  \n \n2. \nRecent  Developments.  To  minimize  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  increased  its \ninvestment  in  transport  infrastructure  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  and  the \n11th Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010).  Investment  in  transport  infrastructure  as  a  share  of  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  more  than  doubled  in  the  last  decade.  The  PRC  had  invested \nCNY308 billion  in  capital  construction  to  build  6,458  km  of  new  lines,  provide  3,275 km  of \ndouble lines, and electrify 6,259 km of tracks in the 10th Five-Year Plan. A World Bank study1 \nindicates  that  total  transport  investment  should  increase  to  at  least  3.8%  of  GDP  to  avoid  the \neconomic costs associated with transport constraints. The Government continues to accord high \npriority to transport infrastructure investments to meet the increase in transport demand. \n \nFuture  Development  Priorities  and  Outlook. Substantial investments in the road and \n3. \nrailway  sectors  from  both  domestic  and  international  financing  sources,  including  the  private \nsector, are envisaged in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). The plan continues to emphasize \nrailway  development,  and  seeks  to  accelerate  railway  construction.  It  envisages  (i) the \nconstruction of 17,000 km of new lines, and (ii) the double-tracking and electrification of 45% of \nthe  network  length.  The  plan  seeks  to  (i)  build  a  dedicated  passenger  railway  network  by \nconstructing  7,000  km  of  passenger-dedicated  lines  by  2010;  (ii)  develop  coal  transport \ncorridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the \npoor  western  region  (to  34,000  km);  (iv)  build  international  corridors  at  the  southwest  and \nnorthwest  borders;  and  (v)  develop  a  nationwide  intermodal  container  network.  A  total \ninvestment  of  CNY1.5  trillion  (CNY1.25  trillion  for  construction  and  CNY250  billion  for  rolling \nstock) is planned in the 11th Five-Year Plan, of which a total of CNY465.2 billion has been spent \nin 2006 and 2007. \n \n4. \nIn 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \nplan  seeks  to  expand  the  railway  network  from  74,000 km  in  2004  to  100,000 km  by  2020. \nIncreasing train speed is a major goal.2 Priority will be given to developing railways in unserved \nareas  and  regions  that  lack  transport  and  have  remained  less  developed.  The  route  network \nlength will be increased by 16,000 km to reach 40,000 km in the western region of the PRC by \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998.

Washington, DC (Report \n\nNo. 1595-CHA Transport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office).  \n\n2  By April 2007, train speed had been increased to over 160 kilometers per hour (km/h) on 14,000 km, and 200\u2013250 \n\nkm/h on 6,000 km of railway lines. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nAsian Development Bank Experience \n\n2020.  The  plan  also  calls  for  separating  passenger  and  freight  traffic  in  heavily  trafficked \ncorridors and for developing 12,000 km of passenger-dedicated corridors by 2020. \n \n5. \nOther  Development  Partner  Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  provided  \u00a5578 billion  for  15  railway  projects  to \nexpand  rail  transport  capacity,  particularly  in  major  coal  transport  corridors.  It  has  also  financed \nthe development of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, \nthe World Bank has provided 12 loans totaling $2.9 billion for 11 national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project (Appendix 4). ADB introduced Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement in 2004 \nto  the  PRC  railway  and  it  has  provided  2  loans  for  about  $140  million  (Euro  113  million)  for \nnetwork  expansion.  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  has  provided  4  loans  for  Euro  484  million \nsince 2005. Austria has provided a loan of Euro 35 million in 2006 and Spain provided a loan for \nEuro  78  million  in  2005.  US  Export  Import  Bank  has  provided  two  loans  of  $300  million  for \nprocurement of track equipment since 2003.    \n \nB. \n \n6. \nAssistance  to  the  Sector.  ADB  is  the  lead  lender  and  has  focused  on  improving \ninfrastructure in less-developed and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and \nreduce poverty. Since 1989, ADB has provided 15 loans totaling over $3.0 billion to help finance \nthe construction of 1,921 km of new railway lines under eight local railway projects, 5,541 km of \nnew railway lines under six national railway projects, and a sector-wide intervention to enhance \nsafety  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  These  projects  have  introduced  modern  technology  and \nimproved  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation  through  institutional  and  structural  reforms.  ADB \nhas  also  provided  14 technical  assistance  initiatives  totaling  about  $6.6 million  to  promote  the \ncommercial  operation  of  railways,  establish  corporate  governance,  achieve  cost  recovery,  and \nimprove railway management (Appendix 4).  \n \nEvaluation of Assistance. The evaluation3 of ADB assistance to the transport sector in \n7. \nthe PRC concluded that ADB\u2019s program for railways was a success. The evaluation noted that \nin  the  railway  subsector  ADB  strategic  priorities  were  well-aligned  with  the  PRC\u2019s  needs.  Its \noverall  focus  on  building  railways  using  modern  technologies  addressed  needs  to  increase \nrailway  capacity  and  reduce  the  persistent  gap  between  supply  and  demand  as  quickly  and \nefficiently  as  possible.  The  priority  given  by  ADB  to  improving  efficiency  and  commercial \norientation, and its emphasis on restructuring and reforming policy was well matched to evolving \ninstitutional reforms in railways. Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway \nprojects  in  the  PRC  shows  strong  commitment  and  generally  satisfactory  capabilities  of  the \nexecuting  agencies  for  project  implementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  has  often \nexceeded expectation at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies have generally complied \nwith the loan covenants. Resettlement and environmental management have been carried out \nsatisfactorily.  Audited  financial  statements  have  been  submitted  on  time,  and  the  audited \nfinancial statements have been found to be generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 15 railway projects, \n10 are complete, and 5 are under implementation. The projects highlight the need to (i) ensure \nthat the executing agency established for project processing and implementation has adequate \ncapacity;  (ii) prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  (iii) review  constraints  on  traffic  throughout  the \nnetwork,  and  the  impact  on  project  viability  of  existing  and  planned  railway  lines  and  other \ntransportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2007.

The railway projects have contributed \nto a dramatic transformation of local economies. Per capita rural incomes in project areas have \nsubstantially  increased.  Living  standards  have  gone  up  and  poverty  has  been  reduced.  The \nproject  performance  audit  report 4  for  the  ADB-financed  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway  project  in  the  PRC \nconcluded that the project was successful and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC. \n \nStrategy  and  Priorities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  has  three  broad \n8. \nobjectives:  (i) improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to \nreduce  poverty,  and  (iii) protect  the  environment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  the  development  of  efficient  and  integrated \ntransport networks to meet the needs of a growing market economy and contribute to reducing \npoverty through investment targeting poorer areas, coupled with policy and institutional reforms. \nBecause  of  the  importance  of  railway  transport  for  the  development  of  the  national  economy, \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  is  focused  on  (i) expanding  the  railway  system  by \nconstructing new lines in unserved areas that are less developed and poor, (ii) modernizing and \nincreasing  the  capacity  to  improve  transport  efficiency  on  key  routes  of  the  national  railway \nsystem,  (iii) commercializing  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations,  (iv)  promoting \nenergy \nrailway \ncompetitiveness in the transport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \nPoverty  Reduction. To heighten the poverty reduction impact of transport investments, \n9. \nADB  pays  particular  attention \nin \nless-developed  and  poor  regions  where  new  lines  will  stimulate  economic  development, \n(ii) encouraging the maximization of employment of poor people during project construction and \noperation, (iii) supplying local materials that meet the requirements of quality and economy from \npoor  villages,  and  (iv) providing  station  access  roads  and  link  roads  to  widen  the  reach  of \nproject benefits to poor interior areas. \n \nGovernance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \n10. \nsector \nthe \nis  contributing \ncommercialization  of  operations,  the  increased  management  autonomy  of  railway  operations, \nhuman  resource  development,  and  improvements  in  financial  management  and  accounting \nsystems. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR emphasizes the need for operational reforms for the \nrail  network,  including  enhancing  safety  in  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  ADB \nsupports the safety and security objective on PRC railways through the introduction of modern \ntechnologies, policy development, legislation, monitoring, and outreach activities (Appendix 6). \n \n11. \nPrivate  Sector  Development.  The  PRC\u2019s  large  infrastructure  needs  require  local \ngovernments  to  shift  from  traditional  financing  modes  to  the  capital  markets.  In  the  railway \nsector,  a  wider  role  for  the  private  sector  is  envisaged.  MOR  has  taken  steps  to  create  the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment and private sector sources. Possible areas include the construction of industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12. \nRegional  Cooperation.  The  PRC  is  an  active  participant  in  three  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  through  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  province;  (ii) the \nCentral  Asian  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  initiative,  through  the  Xinjiang \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR), \n\n(i) locating  ADB-financed  projects \n\nthe  restructuring  of \n\nissues: \n\nfour \n\nto \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2002.

The  improvement  of \ncross-border  trade  regimes  is  a  common  feature  of  these  initiatives.  Since  these  programs \ninvolve the poorer areas of the PRC, expanding regional markets and options could help reduce \npoverty.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  and  CAREC  programs  are  developing  strategies  for \ncooperation  in  transport,  of  which  railway  is  an  important  subsector.  Steps  are  being  taken  to \ndevelop an institutional framework to facilitate the implementation of regional transport projects, \ne.g., Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC railway development and the Pan-Asian railway project \n(Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD. \n \n13.  Monitoring  Targets,  Indicators,  Modality,  and  Processes.  The Government monitors \nand  evaluates  sector  performance  annually;  ADB  reviews  this  through  the  process  of  the \ncountry  partnership strategy.  Indicators  for  evaluating  sector  performance  include  (i) economic \ndevelopment  and  poverty  indicators  for  the  western  region;  (ii) transport  density  in  relation  to \nland  area  and  population;  (iii) public  and  private  investment  in  railways;  (iv) transport  demand \nfor freight and passengers with modal split data; (v) level of user charges (railway construction \nsurcharges,  etc.);  and  (vi) cross-border  traffic  volumes  with  the  Central  Asian  republics,  the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \n\nTable A3: Railway Sector Road Map \n\nIncreasing capacity in key routes \n\n1.

\nsystem transferable to other \n\nMajor Accomplishments and Lessons Learned \nThe project was classified as unsuccessful because of a \nshortfall in traffic and resulting low economic internal rate \nof return, poor institutional setup, and operational \nconstraints on the adjacent locally funded section.a The \npost-evaluation highlighted the need to (i) have a fully \nfunctional and committed EA responsible for both \nconstruction and operation at the project planning stage, \n(ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts, and (iii) ensure \nadequate institutional setup. However, since \npost-evaluation, the operating performance has improved \nsubstantially because of new management and some \nphysical improvements.  \nPart 1 of the TA assisted the EA with construction \nmanagement. Part 2 helped address the areas of concern \nfor improving operation. However, this assistance was not \nsufficient to overcome problems associated with this \nproject. \n\nThe PCR concluded that the project was successful.b \nTraffic exceeded forecasts, and commercial operations \nwere successful. There was rapid economic growth and \nsubstantial social changes resulted in the project area \nafter project completion. Jobs created in tertiary industry \nhelped women improve their social status. The EA was \nrestructured into a joint-stock company. An important \nlesson was to ensure appropriate capital adequacy for \nsuch projects, as 100% debt financing is not financially \nsustainable. \nThe TA supported the establishment of a market-oriented \nand profit-conscious management. The organizational \nstructure was rationalized, corporate profitability \nobjectives were established, and associated management \npolicies were implemented. Computerization aided \nmanagement and financial decision making. \nThe TA helped identify railway projects for the \ndevelopment of unserved areas. Some have been built. \n\nThe PCR rated the project successful.c Commercial \noperation started 1 year ahead of schedule. Traffic and \nrevenues exceeded forecasts. The railway had a \nsubstantial socioeconomic impact.d Incomes and living \nstandards in the project area were raised and poverty was \nreduced after project completion. Employment creation in \nthe service industry increased opportunities for women. \nDebt servicing problems resulting from 100% debt \nfinancing were addressed by financial restructuring. The \nsuccessful financial performance allowed the Guang\u2013\nMei\u2013Shan Railway Company to raise $510 million through \nan initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange \nin 1996.  \nFinance and marketing functions were strengthened, and \ncomputer applications developed to improve management \ninformation systems. The TA helped establish the EA as a \ncommercial entity, focusing on corporate and \norganizational reform, commercial operation, and \neffective information flow.

The lessons learned were: \n(i) undercapitalization led to high, short-term debt \nfinancing; (ii) traffic forecasts need to be prepared \nconsidering alternative routes; and (iii) tariffs should \nconsider those on alternative railways. Since 2003, the \ntraffic has increased substantially.  \nThe TA helped the railway company improve commercial \norientation and knowledge of market-oriented businesses. \nThe railway company was assisted in forecasting financial \nperformance in 1999\u20132003. The EA was helped in \nassessing the year-2000 readiness of the project facilities \nand taking remedial measures. \n \nThe PCR and PPAR concluded that the project was \nsuccessful.f MOR acquired modern technology and \nimplemented organizational and tariff reforms that \nimproved efficiency. The project helped stimulate \neconomic growth in the project area, particularly in the \npoverty counties in Jiangxi province. Per capita income \nincreased substantially and poverty incidence fell. This \nproject also highlighted the need to forecast freight traffic \nmore accurately than it did. \nThe TA concluded that (i) a separate entity for \ncommercial operation of the JJR is not desirable as it \nwould place the JJR at a competitive disadvantage, and \n(ii) the operation should be integrated with the national \nnetwork. The proposal for a higher tariff for the north\u2013\nsouth corridor, including the JJR, was put into effect.  \nThe PCR concluded that the project was successfulg and \nresulted in rapid economic growth that has significantly \nbenefited people living in the project area. \n\nThe TA identified excessive staffing, undercapitalization, \nand underutilization of assets as problems of local \nrailways in Sichuan. Organizational commitment to meet \ncustomer needs was lacking. An action plan to develop \nthe required business environment is under \nimplementation. \n\nThe PCR concluded that the project was successfulh and \nresulted in rapid economic growth that has significantly \nbenefited people living in the project area. \n\nThe study made recommendations for the efficient \ncommercial operation of Shaanxi Xiyan Railway Company \nand SLRC, including the corporatization of SLRC. Other \nareas covered included management information \nsystems, traffic costing, and tariffs. Implementation of the \naction plan developed under the TA is in progress.  \n \nThe PCR concluded that the project was highly \nsuccessful.i The project helped stimulate economic \ngrowth in the project area, particularly in the poverty \ncounties.

The \ntraffic  forecast  was  based  on  a  two-tier  analysis:  (i)  national  transport  demand  based  on \nhistorical  trends  correlating  socioeconomic  parameters,  such  as  gross  domestic  product  and \npropensity  to  travel  or  ship  or  demand  for  railway  transport;  (ii)  national  and  regional  railway \ntraffic  demand  based  on  commodity-specific  analysis  for  major  commodities  currently  using \nother  railway  lines,  roads,  and  inland  waterways.\nTraffic  projections  considered  expected \neconomic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism  development  potential,  local  government \ndevelopment plans, market surveys, and assessments of technical assistance consultants and \nAsian Development Bank missions. The freight volume on the CLR is forecast to increase from \nabout 7.16 billion ton-kilometers (ton-km) in 2014 to 20.13 billion ton-km in 2033, for an average \nannual  growth  rate  of  5.9%.\nPassenger  traffic  is  forecast  to  grow  from  8.38  billion  passenger-\nkilometers  (passenger-km)  in  2014  to  25.78  billion  passenger-km  in  2033,  for  an  average \nannual  growth  rate  of  6.4%  (Table  A14.1).  Traffic  forecasts  are  considered  reasonable,  given \nthat (i) the CLR is an important link along the Chengdu\u2013Chongqing\u2013Shanghai transport corridor, \nconnecting  western  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  with  the  east,  as  well  as  serving  as  a \ngateway to the PRC\u2013Eurasian rail network for intermodal transport; (ii) railways in the PRC have \nexperienced high annual traffic growth with recent rates higher than the assumed growth rates \nfor  freight  and  passenger  traffic;  (iii)  the  existing  parallel  road  within  the  project  corridor  is \ncongested  in  some  areas,  making  road  transport  expensive  and  hazardous;  and  (iv)  the \ndistance saved by routing traffic through CLR compared with other railway lines is up to 369 km \nin  origin\u2013destination  pairs  involving  long-distance  movement  between  eastern  and  western \nPRC.  \n \nB.  \n\nEconomic Evaluation  \n\n \n\n2. \nAnalysis  of  Alternatives.  As  part  of  the  economic  analysis,  possible  alternative \ninterventions were considered, to meet the growing transport demand in the project area as part \nof  the  national  and  provincial  transport  network  plan.  Various  options,  in  terms  of  transport \nmodes,  alignments,  and  technical  designs,  were  reviewed.  While  enhancing  the  existing  road \ncapacity  may  be  an  option  to  partly  meet  the  increasing  demand,  it  will  not  completely  satisfy \nthe various kinds of traffic, particularly bulk cargo such as coal over long distances to meet the \nneeds  of  a  growing  economy.  Aside  from  the  higher  initial  cost,  increased  land  requirements, \nhigh  air  pollution,  fuel  consumption,  and  user  costs  make  the  road  alternative  less  viable. \nMultiple alignment alternatives were subsequently evaluated for four line sections, considering \ngeologic  and  topographic  conditions,  terrain,  the  results  of  consultations  with  community \nrepresentatives,  cost  estimates,  relative  impact  on  the  environment  and  resettlement,  and  the \nobjective of integration with the national and local transport network. The technical design was \nproposed  after  consideration  of  the  national  railway  network,  consistency  in  the  standards  of \ncontiguous sections at each end of the project railway, and forecast traffic.  \n \n3. \nCost.  The  economic  evaluation  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios,  using  constant  2008  economic  prices.  Under  the  without-project  scenario  it  is \nassumed  that  the  diverted  traffic  (27.3  million  tons  and  26.1  million  passengers  by  2014) \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nestimated  under  the  with-project  scenario  would  continue  moving  by  road  and  by  existing \nrailway lines. Furthermore, the generated traffic estimated under the with-project scenario (3.79 \nmillion  tons  and  16.41  million  passengers  by  2014)  would  not  materialize  under  the \nwithout-project  scenario.  The  project  benefits  and  cost  were  revalued  in  economic  prices  by \nseparating the cost items into tradable materials and equipment, non-tradable materials, labor, \nand land. The prices were expressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow \nexchange  rate  factor  of  1.01  for  foreign  exchange  effects.  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.67 \nwas used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for \nskilled labor since no clear surplus of skilled workers exists.  \n \n4. \nBenefits.  Economic  benefits  include  (i)  user  cost  savings  for  freight  and  passenger \ntraffic;  (ii)  time  savings for  diverted passenger and  freight  traffic  from  buses,  trucks,  and  other \nrail  lines;  (iii)  generated  passenger  and  freight  transport  benefits;  (iv)  tourism  benefits; \n(v) avoided  road  infrastructure  and  maintenance  costs;  (vi)  shipper  savings  due  to  increased \nrailway  competition;  (vii)  avoided  road  accidents;  (viii)  pollution  reduction  benefits;  (ix)  energy \nsavings; and (x) national productivity benefits.  \n \n5. \nFor passenger traffic diverted from road (3.38 million passengers in 2014), the user cost \nsaving  (CNY53.74  million  by  2014)  is  the  difference  in  the  passenger  economic  fare  between \nroad  and  rail  transport  (CNY0.0003  per  passenger-km).  For  passenger  traffic  diverted  from \nother railway lines (22.72 million passengers by 2014), the user cost savings (CNY7.78 million \nby 2014) is the difference of route distance applied to the economic cost of rail passenger travel \n(CNY0.051  per  passenger-km).  For  generated  passenger  traffic  (both  local  and  interline)  the \npassenger-km estimate (2.46 billion by 2014) is multiplied by one-half of the average economic \ncost savings (CNY0.0004 per passenger-km). Passenger traffic time savings (CNY2.21 million \nby 2014) are computed only for diverted traffic.  \n \n6. \nFor freight traffic diverted from trucks (6.24 million tons by 2014), the economic benefit \n(CNY272.84 million by 2014) is the difference in shipper economic costs between truck and rail \ntransport  (CNY0.193  per  ton-km).  For  traffic  diverted  from  other  PRC  railways  routes  to  CLR, \nthe benefit is the rail-diverted ton-km (4.84 billion by 2014) applied to the same economic rate of \nrail  transport  (CNY0.0364  per  ton-km).  For  freight  traffic  diverted  from  inland  waterways  (1.29 \nmillion  tons  by  2014),  the  economic  benefit  (CNY0.24  million  by  2014)  is  the  difference  in \nshipper  economic  costs  between  inland  waterway  and  rail  transport  (CNY0.0007  per  ton-km). \nFor generated freight traffic benefits (CNY1,425.9 million by 2014) an adjusted economic value \nadded ranging from CNY565 per ton for non-containerized bulk cargo to CNY4,406 per ton for \ncontainerized cargo was computed on the basis of the current financial value, non-tax elements, \nshadow exchange rate factor, percentage of value added, percentage of net taxes, depreciation, \nand operating surplus for each commodity. The adjusted economic values per ton represent the \nnet  economic  value,  i.e.,  the  value  of  output  at  economic  prices  less  the  costs  of  production \n(sum of all intermediate input costs, including wages, and annualized investment costs). Similar \nto passenger traffic, freight traffic time savings (CNY0.34 million by 2014) are computed only for \ndiverted traffic. \n \nTourism  benefits  (CNY74.26  million  by  2014)  assume  that  15%  of  generated  interline \n7. \npassenger traffic growth (0.86 million by 2014) is attributable to CLR, which will generate a net \neconomic  value  of  CNY95  per  tourist,  representing  16.9%  of  the  value  added  in  the  tourism \nsector accounting for the value of output at economic prices less the cost of production (sum of \nall  intermediate  input  costs,  wages,  and  annualized  investment  costs).  To  eliminate  double \ncounting, a downward adjustment of 15% of generated traffic benefits is made, reducing these \nbenefits by the same proportion as the percentage of tourists in projected interline passengers.  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n47\n\n \n\n8. \nThe  construction  of  CLR  will  help  avoid  some  costs  that  would  not  be  possible  in  the \nabsence  of  CLR.  The  economic  analysis  estimated  four  such  cases  of  cost  avoidance: \n(i) avoided  highway  investment  costs  (initial  investment  of  CNY191.21  million  by  2014,  with \nannual  incremental  investments  ranging  from  CNY6.68  million  by  2014  to  CNY9.04  million  by \n2033  to  accommodate  the  increased  traffic  every  year);  (ii)  avoided  highway  routine  and \nperiodic  maintenance  costs  (CNY13.99  million  by  2014,  increasing  to  CNY31.81  million  by \n2033);  (iii)  avoided  truck  shipping  charges  to  freight  shippers  due  to  increased  competition \nbrought  about  by  CLR  (CNY207.59  million  by  2014,  increasing  to  CNY524.57  by  2033);  and \n(iv) avoided road accident costs (CNY110.43 million by 2014, increasing to CNY251.11 million \nby 2033).  \n \n9. \nEnergy  and  pollution  benefits  have  also  been  estimated  for  the  Project.  With  the \ndiversion  of  freight  and  passengers  from  road  to  rail,  there  will  be  benefits  due  to  reduced \npollution  from  trucks,  buses,  and  cars  as  well  as  less  energy  used  by  the  transport  sector. \nRecent  research  by  the  International  Energy  Agency  was  used  as  a  basis  for  computing  the \nnumber  of  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  per  traffic  unit  for  road  and  rail  for  the  PRC.  These \nsavings for rail compared with road were found to be 25.4 tons of CO2 per million passenger-km \nand  24  tons  of  CO2  per  million  ton-km.  Under  the  provisions  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  certified \nemission reductions are currently valued in the PRC at $16 per ton of carbon dioxide. This value \nhas  been  included  in  the  benefit  stream  (CNY32.18  million  by  2014,  increasing  to  CNY96.93 \nmillion by 2033). In addition, the savings of reduced total fuel consumption (CNY204.0 million by \n2014; CNY605.03 million by 2033) as a result of the diversion of traffic from both road and rail to \nCLR has been computed and included in the benefit stream. Unit operating costs for both road \nand rail transport have been adjusted to exclude fuel costs in order to eliminate double counting \nof this benefit.  \n\n10. \nConclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 16.7% (Table \nA14.3).  Benefits  from  the  freight  traffic,  including  generated  benefits,  are  the  major  economic \nbenefit  (approximately  55%),  with  passenger  benefits  contributing  about  3.3%  and  other \nbenefits  making  up  the  remaining  balance.  Sensitivity  analysis  tested  10  scenarios  to  assess \nthe  robustness  of  the  results  of  the  economic  analysis  (Table  A14.4).  The  initial  capital  cost \nwould have to be more than 60.0% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff \nrate  of  12%.  Considering  the  experience  of  Asian  Development  Bank-financed  projects  in  the \nrailway  sector,  this  switching  value  is  unlikely  to  occur.  The  freight  benefits  would  have  to \ndecrease  more  than  44%  to  make  the  Project  economically  nonviable.  A  1-year  delay  in \ncompletion does not affect economic viability. Combinations of adverse effects of benefits and \ncosts were also tested. The results showed that the Project would maintain its economic viability \nunder plausible scenarios of variability. \n \n11. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  extended  to  quantify  project  risk  and  distribute  project  net \nbenefits among stakeholders. The risk analysis considered the distribution of possible values for \nkey variables, including capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, passenger traffic, and \nfreight  traffic,  and  the  probability  with  which  they  may  occur.  The  results  show  that  the \nprobability  of  an  EIRR  falling  below  12%  would  be  0.8%.  Distribution  analysis  examined  how \nproject  net  benefits  would  be  distributed  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  project \nbeneficiaries, such as passengers, freight shippers, labor, government, and the economy (Table \nA14.2).  At  62.3%  freight  shippers  would  be  the largest  beneficiary  group,  followed  by  national \nand local economy at 17.0%, national and local government at 15.2%, passengers at 3.9%, and \nlabor at 1.6%.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.1: Traffic Forecast \n\nItem \n\n     2014 \n\n    2021 \n\n   2033 \n\nFreight Total Tons \n\n Diverted Tons (million) \n\n

statements of the proposed Chongqing\u2013Lichuan Railway Project \n1. \n(the Project) were prepared in current terms for 2009\u20132033. Construction will be completed by \nend-2014;  the  trial  operation  will  follow  for  one  year;  and  the  full  commercial  operation  will \ncommence  in  2015.  The  cost  estimates  are  presented  in  current  terms.  As  required  in  the \nfinancial management guidelines physical contingencies (at the weighted average rate of 5.6%) \nand price contingencies1 had been provided.  \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Projections  \n\n2. \nA  set  of  tariffs  was  devised  for  freight  and  passenger  transport  service,  based  on  full \ncost recovery plus an adequate return on equity. Operating revenues from tariffs are projected \nbased on forecast of future traffic and a base average tariff rate of CNY0.103 per ton-kilometer \nfor 2014 inclusive of Railway Construction Fund collections, which averages CNY0.033 per ton-\nkilometer.  The  freight  tariff  is  assumed  to  increase  at  a  rate  of  1%  annually  with  tariff \nadjustments  taking  place  every  five  years.  Similar  to  the  freight  tariff,  passenger  fares  are \nassumed to increase in current terms once every 5 years at an annual rate of 1%. Passenger \ntariff ranges from CNY0.10 per passenger-km for local fast trains to CNY0.20 per passenger-km \nfor transit very fast trains in 2014 with a weighted average rate of CNY0.158 per passenger-km \nfor all passenger traffic. Other revenues, including loading and unloading, warehouse storage, \nparcel service in the train stations, amount to 4.5% of combined freight and passenger revenue.   \n\n3.  \nAnnual  incremental  operating  costs  are  estimated  as  follows:  (i)  fixed  cost  excluding \ndepreciation CNY0.326 million per route-kilometer in 2014 escalating at an average rate of 2.2% \nper year in current terms; (ii) passenger variable cost in 2014 of CNY0.035 per passenger-km \nexcluding  dry  lease  of  rolling  stock,  increasing  to  CNY0.037  per  passenger-km  in  2033; \n(iii) freight  variable  cost  in  2014  of  CNY0.029  per  ton-km  excluding  dry  lease  of  rolling  stock, \nincreasing to CNY0.033 per ton-km in 2033; (iv) estimated cost of dry lease of rolling stock2 is \nCNY10.60  per  train-km  for  passenger  trains  and  CNY7.89  per  train-km  for  freight  trains;  and \n(v) other  non-operating  expenses  are  assumed  at  CNY0.0025  per  traffic  unit  (ton-km  plus \npassenger-km).  All  incremental  operating  costs  are  projected  to  increase  annually  in  line  with \ninflation rates.  \n\nPeriodic  track-laying  maintenance  and  infrastructure  rehabilitation  will  be  required  after \n4. \neach  7  years  of  operation  at  a  cost  of  CNY3.05  million  per  route-km;  electric  power  and \ncatenary  will  be  replaced  after  15  years  of  operation  at  a  cost  of  CNY1,096.7  million,  and \nsignaling  and  communications,  safety  and  other  equipment  will  be  replaced  after  20  years  of \noperation at a cost of CNY832.5 million.  \n\n5. \nThe accounts receivable turnover period is assumed at 2 months of the annual revenue \nand  1  month  of  the  total  working  expenses  for  accounts  payable.  The  project  company  will \n\n                                                 \n1  Local  inflation  rate 5% for 2009 and thereafter; foreign inflation rate 0.7% for 2009, 1.4% in  2010, 0.4% in  2011, \n\nand 0.5% per year thereafter. \n\n2  Rolling stock consists of a fleet of freight and passenger trains, which will not be specifically assigned to the CLR. \nMOR  will  separately  finance  the  procurement  of  rolling  stock  and  charge  a  fee  based  on  train-kilometer  (km)  to \nCLR  and  other  railways.  The  per-km  rate  will  be  based  on  dry-lease  terms  and  will  include  depreciation  charges \n(20-year economic life with 4% scrap value) and 8% return on investment. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n51\n\nemploy  3,700  employees  in  2014.  The  average  annual  wages  and  fringe  benefits  in  2014  are \nCNY30,000 per employee escalating at 3% per year.   \n\n6. \nDepreciation is calculated on a straight line method with an average life of 65 years for \nthe main railway structure, 10 years for track, 45 years for buildings, 15 years for electric power \nand  traction,  and  20  years  for  signaling  and  communications  and  safety  and  other  equipment \nand facilities. Applicable business taxes at an average rate of 3.24% are charged on revenue. \nCorporate  income  tax  at  33%  is  paid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes,  depreciation \nand interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward.   \n\n7. \nThe  Project  will  be  funded  50%  by  equity  (70%  and  30%,  respectively  by  Ministry  of \nRailways  and  Chongqing  Municipal  Government)  and  50%  by  long-term  loans.  The  China \nConstruction  Bank  (CCB)  loan  (CNY10.00  billion  bearing  interest  at  6.6%  per  year)  will  be \nrepayable over 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. The ADB loan $150 million (CNY1.08 \nbillion)  will  have  a  26-year  term  including  a  6-year  grace  period,  and  be  a  US  dollar  London \ninterbank offered rate-based loan with a 0.15% commitment fee. Projected financial statements \nare presented in Table A15.1 to Table A15.3 The projected financial statements indicate that the \nforecast  revenue  under  the  base  assumptions  are  sufficient  to  cover  annual  recurrent  costs, \ndepreciation, debt repayments on the ADB and CCB loans, and generate reasonable profits.  \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Analysis   \n\n8. \nFollowing  are  the  major  assumptions  used  for  calculation  of  a  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (FIRR):  (i)  all  calculations  are  based  on  2008  prices,  covering  2009\u20132033;  (ii)  capital \ncosts include all incremental capital expenditures related to construction and equipment for the \nrailway,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  operating  costs \ninclude  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  project  railway,  but  exclude \ndepreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) the residual value equal to one-half of the net \nbook value of capital investment.   \n\n9. \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after-tax,  in  real  terms  was \ncalculated  using  estimated  capital  mix  and  cost  of  funds.  Costs  have  been  considered  as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 5-year London interbank offered rate fixed swap rate plus a provision \nfor  ADB\u2019s  spread  of  0.2%  is  used  for  ADB  debt;  (ii)  the  estimated  interest  rate  of  6.6%  per \nannum is used for the CCB loan; and (iii) the opportunity cost of equity capital was assumed to \nbe 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted to reflect the impact of income tax of 33%. The nominal \ncost is converted to the real cost by applying domestic and international long-term inflation rates \nfor local currency and foreign exchange denominated debt, respectively.   \n\n10. \nThe FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 5.48% (Table A15.4), which \ncompares  favorably  with  the  WACC,  computed  at  an  after-tax  basis  at  2.80%.  The  Project  is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate conditions causing \nthe Project's viability to fall below the WACC are unlikely to occur. The switching values show \nthat the financial viability of the project is not altered within a realistic range of variation in key \nparameter  estimates.  The  sensitivity  of  the  Project's  financial  indicators  to  cost  and  revenue \nvariations is shown in Table A15.5.  \n\n \n\n\fItem \n\n2014   2015   2016   2017   2018   2019  2020  \n\n2021

\n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n   No \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nBetter  railway  transport  will  enable  poverty  reduction  through  improved  access  to  markets,  employment,  advanced \neducation and medical facilities, new knowledge and information, families working or studying in other regions, and other \nsocial and economic services, and facilitate economic development and job creation. Improved access to markets opens \nup  opportunities  for  expansion  of  locally  produced  goods  and  services.  Incoming  passengers  and  tourists  generate \nadditional demand for locally produced goods and services.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                            Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nMany  villages  located  toward  the  eastern  half  of  the  alignment  have  been  relatively  isolated  from  these  developments, \nand these are  where the very poor live. The links between poverty, topography, and transport systems are apparent in \nthe project impact area. The main causes of poverty in the project areas are (i) natural calamity, (ii) lack of infrastructure, \n(iii)  very  limited  and  unsustainable  source  of  livelihood,  (vi)  uneven  economic  development,  and  (v)  poor  health.  The \nProject  will benefit about 5.5 million people in the project area; 3.6 million are in the countryside, and 590,000 of these \n(16.4%)  are  poor.  There  are  681  designated  poverty  villages  in  the  project  impact  area\u201431.6%  of  all  villages  in  the \narea\u2014and they are largely concentrated in the four poorest counties. About 14% of the people in the project impact area \nare  ethnic  minorities,  almost  all  of  them  living  in  the  Shizhu\u2013Tujia  Autonomous  County  and  the  neighboring  Lichuan \ncounty. \n \nAbout 119,000 unskilled person-years of work will be created during the construction of the railway. Half of the unskilled \nwork, with total wages of CNY0.89 billion, will be targeted at the poor. Priority will be given to women, people affected by \nresettlement, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable people. In addition, during the construction, 44,142 person-years of \nlocal unskilled jobs in the provision of construction materials will be created, with total wages of CNY0.4 billion; half of this \ntotal will be targeted at the poor. When the new railway starts to operate in 2014, about 3,530 jobs involving working for \nChongqing\u2013Lichuan  Railway  will  be  created.  The  local  governments  are  responsible  for  providing  social  services  and \npoverty  reduction  funds  for  county  poverty  alleviation  planning;  their  programs  will  be  augmented  by  the  railway \nconstruction tax revenues.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  railway  stations  will  create  various  jobs,  and  help  distribute  the  benefits  to  local  people.  There  will  be \nsufficient  space  in  and  around  the  stations  for  local  area  development,  and  the  poor,  women,  ethnic  groups,  and  other \nvulnerable people will be supported by local governments in setting up shop and selling local specialties and other goods \nand services. The jobs created by the generated freight will total 34,909 jobs by 2014. Increased tourism will result in the \ncreation of 1,003 jobs by 2014. Directly as well as indirectly, therefore, the Project will improve conditions in support of the \nPRC\u2019s strategy of micro-urbanization for poor families to (i) encourage them to move out of unsustainable, mountainous, \nand isolated farmlands; (ii) give them better access to markets, and advanced educational and health facilities especially \nfor pregnant women; and (iii) allow them to build a sustainable future in new centers of economic activity. The Project will \ncomplement  the  poverty  reduction  activities  of  the  local  governments,  such  as  assisting  the  poor  with  urban  migration, \nrelocation, employment, local economic development, farmer-based rural tourism, agricultural product development, and \nhealth  and  physical  infrastructure  and  natural  resources  improvement.  These  concerted  efforts  will  promote  further \nprogress toward the Millennium Development Goals in the project areas, especially Goals 1 and 3\u20137. \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes                 \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nVarious public consultation and participation activities for the Project have been carried out, including 48 village surveys \nand over 1,700 household surveys. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) and project planners have had formal and informal \nconsultations with local communities and government agencies through meetings, surveys, household interviews, written \ncommunications,  and  workshops.  Local  governments  and  communities  will  be  responsible  for  organizing  local  labor  for \nthe  construction.  The  station  area  developments  will  encourage  participation,  to  the  benefit  of  the  poor,  women,  ethnic \nminorities,  and  other  vulnerable  people.  Among  the  issues  discussed  was  the  selection  of  the  line,  route  and  sand  and \nstone supply.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nLocal people\u2019s participation will be essential for improving their opportunities to benefit from the Project. Local groups and \nrelevant government agencies will continue to be involved in the consultation and participation process, especially during \nthe  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan,  and  the  resettlement  plan.  Railway \nconstruction support offices have been set up in each project county, and they will have copies of all relevant documents. \nDuring construction and operation, they will serve as key coordinating points to enhance the participation of stakeholders, \nincluding  the  poor,  women,  ethnic  groups,  and  other  vulnerable  people.  Leading  groups  have  been  formed  at  the  local \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n57 \n\ngovernment  level;  these  include  development  and  reform  commissions;  finance,  land  and  resources,  environment \nprotection,  industry  and  tourism,  and  poverty  reduction  offices;  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation  (ACWF);  and  health, \nlabor,  civil  affairs,  and  ethnic  affairs  groups.  These  leading  groups  will  continue  the  process  of  consultation  and \nparticipation  and  coordinate  activities  by  various  agencies  to  ensure  local  benefits.  A  social  development  action  plan \n(SDAP) has been prepared  and endorsed  by MOR and the local governments. It  will  be implemented and monitored to \nensure the participation of local people in project activities and benefits. \n\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nDuring  project  preparation,  analyses  of  gender-disaggregated  data  and  discussions  with  representatives  of  the  ACWF \nindicated that women will need some assistance to fully benefit from the Project. Data collected for the poverty and social \nassessment  and  the  resettlement  plan  indicate  the  following:  (i)  women  primarily  engage  in  agricultural  activities;  and \n(ii) male  members  from  poor  households  tend  to  travel  farther  for  migrant  labor  opportunities  than  non-poor  males, \nleaving  behind  a  high  percentage  of  households  headed  by  women.  The  construction  of  the  railway  would  create \nopportunities  for  local  area  development,  and  many  of  the  service  sector  jobs,  especially  in  the  tourism  sector,  seek \nwomen  employees.  The  ACWF  will  provide  business  management  and  financial  assistance  to  women  interested  in \nsetting up small businesses that serve the construction crews and the growing tourist sector.  In addition, as women will \nhave  a  greater  exposure  to  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS/STIs  and  human  trafficking,  the  mitigation  measures  will  pay  special \nattention to women.  \n \nPoverty  and  social  enhancement  measures  have  been  built  into  the  project  design,  and  special  mitigation  or \nenhancement actions have been included in the resettlement plan and SDAP. For example, members of the community \nwill collectively decide where schools will be relocated. Women, especially female heads of households, will be consulted \nas  schools  provide  an  informal  source  of  day  care  for  their  children.  Poor  women  heads  of  households  will  receive \nassistance so that their children can remain in school, freeing the women\u2019s time during the day to work.  Widows will be \neligible  for  special  assistance,  if  necessary,  during  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Women  will  be  given  priority  in \nproject-generated employment during the construction and operation of the railway. The rise in female participation in the \nlabor force and tourism market will increase women\u2019s net income, thus improving family welfare, and raising the status of \nwomen. \n \nHas an output been prepared?                    \n\n    Yes (see SDAP) \n\n   No \n\nE.

The  resettlement  plan  has \nbeen endorsed by MOR and relevant local governments. \nThe  proposed  railway  will  provide  cheaper,  safer,  and  faster \ntransport along a key east\u2013west connection. Passenger tariffs \nwill be about one half of current bus fares, and freight tariffs \nwill be about one ninth of current road tariffs.  \nRailway \ngenerate \nconsiderable direct and indirect employment for the poor. The \npoor,  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups  will  be  given \npriority in these employment opportunities.  \n14% of the people in the project area are Tujia and some will \nbe  affected  by  resettlement.  Special  measures  for  the \nminorities  are  addressed  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  the \nSDAP. \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention: \nThe  local  health,  civil  affairs,  labor,  and  other  relevant \nagencies  will  coordinate  with  the  construction  contractors  in \ndelivering  HIV/AIDS/STIs  and  human  trafficking  prevention \ninformation,  voluntary  counseling  and  testing,  condoms,  HIV \ntesting  kits,  and  STI  treatment  packages,  and  strictly  follow \nthe  PRC\u2019s  relevant  laws  and  regulations  on  prevention  of \ndiseases.  The  provincial  governments  have  an  active \nHIV/AIDS awareness and prevention program and MOR has \nexperience in this area. This risk will be monitored under the \nSDAP and environmental management and monitoring plan.  \n\nPlan \nRequired \n Full \n Short \n None  \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\nan \n\nduring \n\noccupy \n\ntemporarily \n\n674 hectares \n\nconstruction.  Also, \n\n \n1. \nThe project railway alignment is 259.3 kilometers (km) long and will cross 29 townships \nand 84 villages in the seven districts or counties of Chongqing municipality and Hubei province. \nThe resettlement plan addresses the permanent and temporary impact of the railway alignment, \nstation  sites,  station  access  roads,  and  related  construction  activities.  An  estimated \n711 hectares of land will be permanently acquired; of this, 62.3% is farmland (10.4% paddy land, \n41.7%  cultivated  dryland,  10.2%  garden  plots),  37.1  %  is  forestland,  and  0.6%  is  land  put  to \nother  use.  Given  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  standard  for  impact  assessment,  the \nequivalent of 5,283 people would theoretically lose all their farmland and agricultural livelihoods. \nSince the alignment is a narrow strip of land, most of the affected persons will lose only a small \npart  of  their  landholding.  From  experience,  the  average  loss  is  estimated  at  15%;  this  means \nthat  the  number  of  partially  affected  people  would  be  in  the  order  of  35,000,  and  that  those \nlosing  more  than  10%  would  be  about  14,000.  The  accurate  number  of  those  affected  will  be \navailable  after  the  detailed  measurement  surveys  along  the  approved  alignment.  The  Project \nwill \nestimated \n391,000 square meters  of  structures\u201486%  residential  structures,  and  14%  factory  and \ninstitutional  structures\u2014will  be  demolished.  The  demolition  of  1,715  houses  will  require  the \nrelocation  of  5,314 persons.  Land  acquisition  and  house  demolition  impact  will  be  reduced  by \naligning the railway and stations away from the most densely populated areas (by constructing \nbridges and tunnels, which account for 83%), after consultations with communities.  \n \n2. \nThe  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  in  conjunction  with  local  governments,  prepared  the \nresettlement  plan.  It  is  based  on:  the  feasibility  study;  village  surveys  of  48  affected  villages; \n337 additional  household  surveys;  and  consultations  with  provincial,  prefecture,  and  local \nofficials, village leaders, and affected households. The resettlement objective is to ensure that \ncompensation  and  entitlements  provided  to  affected  persons  are  adequate  for  at  least \nmaintaining their \u201cwithout-project\u201d standard of living, with prospects of improvement\u2014in line with \nthe PRC Land Administration Law, 2004, and the Asian Development  Bank (ADB)  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n3. \nThe resettlement plan stipulates eligibility and entitlement provisions for affected people. \nPermanent land losses will be compensated by cash payments. Each rural village will use the \nland  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidy  for  income  restoration.  The  main  strategies  for \nincome restoration include improvement of irrigation systems, development of animal husbandry \nand cash crops, small-business development, and migration to urban centers for employment. \nCompensation for temporary land loss will be paid directly to the people affected to offset any \nincome  loss;  the  land  will  also  be  restored  by  the  contractor  to  its  original  state  after  use. \nCompensation  for  rural  housing  losses  will  be  paid  directly  to  those  affected  at  replacement \ncost,  free  of  demolition  expenses  and  salvaged  materials.  The  displaced  rural  houses  will  be \nrebuilt within the existing village or integrated with the suburban development plan. Better road \naccess and provision of site leveling, water supply, electricity, telephone, and cable facilities will \nbe provided. Urban households, factories, schools and other institutions, and enterprises will be \npaid compensation for relocation and reconstruction based on market rates determined through \nnegotiations.  Urban  households  can  select  new  housing,  which  is  widely  available.  Most \nfactories  will  only  suffer  partial  impact  and  continue  operations  at  the  same  site.  For  factories \nrequired to relocate, each owner will prepare a relocation plan, which includes the restoration of \nlivelihood and incomes for all workers. Schools and other institutions will be rebuilt according to \nthe plans of local government, to ensure that service levels are maintained or improved. \n \n4. \nThe  resettlement  impact  of  the  railway  project  is  spread  thinly  over  a  long,  narrow \ncorridor.  Investigations  showed  that  income  loss  from  land  acquisition  will  be  less  severe \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n59 \n\nbecause this corridor is developing rapidly and at least 70% of net income for more than half of \nrural  households  comes  from  nonagricultural  employment  and  small  businesses.  Special \nassistance will be provided to any seriously affected villages and groups, especially vulnerable \nhouseholds  that  include  the  poor,  widows,  and  disabled  persons.  Ethnic  minorities  (primarily \nTujia) account for 14% of the project beneficiaries and less than 10% of affected persons. Some \nof Tujia households have successfully transitioned into the PRC\u2019s economy, while others have \nremained  poor,  albeit  with  improved  living  conditions.  Where  they  are  poor,  this  is  due  to  the \nlimited  resources  available  in  the  area  to  all  residents  and  inability  to  take  advantage  of \nopportunities.  Special  measures  are  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  to  ensure  that  they  are \nadequately rehabilitated and that their living standards improve.  \n \n5. \nLocal  government  land  administration  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nresettlement;  many  activities  will  be  carried  out  by  township  officials  and  village  committees. \nMOR  and  the  local  governments  have  extensive  experience,  and  they  integrate  resettlement \nwith  project  implementation  through  railway  construction  support  offices,  which  have  already \nbeen  set  up.  Local  government  will  provide  training  to  local  officials  who  will  be  involved  in \nimplementation.  The  training  will  focus  on  ADB  requirements,  as  specified  in  the  resettlement \nplan, and new domestic procedures. Affected persons have been informed and consulted about \nthe  project  impact  and  resettlement  policies  and  entitlements  at  various  stages.  Resettlement \ninformation  booklets  have  been  distributed  to  affected  villages.  Affected  households  will \ncontinue to be consulted and are encouraged to participate in resettlement activities, including \nthe  detailed  measurement  survey,  location  of  underpasses,  new  housing  sites,  and  grievance \nredress. \n \nAffected  households  will  receive  training  and  skills  development  assistance  that  will \n6. \nfacilitate  income-generating  activities.  Other  assistance,  such  as  preferential  hiring  of  affected \npersons  by  construction  companies  and  access  to  credit,  will  also  be  provided.  Local  poverty \nalleviation  programs  provide  a  valuable  source  of  additional  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups \nand  they  will  be  targeted  during  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  In  addition,  the \nprovinces  have  established  programs  that  directly  benefit  affected  villages  and  persons. \nChongqing has a very active village development program that provides infrastructure and funds \nfor rural enterprise development that will be doubled during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.  \n \n7. \nThe  total  resettlement  cost  for  the  Project  is  CNY541.35  million,  including  taxes  and \ncontingencies.  The  Chongqing  municipal  government  will  finance  the  resettlement  cost  for  its \nsection  of  the  railway  and  MOR  will  finance  the  section  in  Lichuan.  Both  have  guaranteed  to \nsupplement  the  resettlement  budget,  as  may  prove  necessary,  to  meet  any  shortfall.  An \nimplementation  schedule  based  on  MOR\u2019s  project  construction  timetable  has  been  prepared. \nLand acquisition and housing demolition for the railway component would commence in the first \nquarter of 2009, and the work on new stations would start much later. The Project is expected to \nbe completed in 2014. \n \n8. \nMOR,  through  the  project  company,  and  the  local  governments,  through  the  railway \nconstruction  support  offices,  will  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  of \ncompensation  payments,  house  rebuilding  and  relocation,  land  redistribution,  and  grievance \nredress.  MOR  and  the  local  governments  have  extensive  experience  in  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  and  this  experience  is  expected  to  facilitate  resettlement  implementation  for  the \nProject.  MOR  will  prepare  progress  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  each  quarter,  until \nresettlement  is  completed.  MOR  will  then  prepare  a  resettlement  completion  report  for \nsubmission to ADB. In addition, MOR will contract an independent monitor to carry out external \nmonitoring and evaluation. The tasks include (i) conducting a baseline survey; (ii) reviewing and \nverifying the compensation payments, status of land acquisition, and compensation payments; \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n(iii)  assessing  grievance  redress  procedures,  and  the  affected  persons\u2019  opinions  and  level  of \nsatisfaction;  (iv) assessing  the  restoration  of  affected  persons\u2019  livelihood,  incomes,  and  living \nconditions; and (v) compiling the lessons learned for future resettlement planning. The external \nmonitor  will  prepare  monitoring  reports  for  submission  to  MOR  and  ADB  every  6 months  until \nthe completion of the resettlement activities; thereafter, annual evaluation investigations will be \nconducted  for  at  least  2  years  and  reported  to  MOR  and  ADB.
