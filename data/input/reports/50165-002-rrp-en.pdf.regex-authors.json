THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Phuentsholing Township \nDevelopment Project (the project). \n \n2.  The project will construct river walls and raise ground levels to protect Phuentsholing city \nand new township from floods and riverbank erosion. It will also develop common infrastructure \non about 66 hectares (ha) of new urban land to enable the safe and sustainable expansion of \nhuman settlements and commercial activities. Finally, it will support capacity development to \nimprove flood risk management and the delivery of urban services.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bhutan, which is located entirely within the Himalayan mountain range, is increasingly \nexperiencing water-induced disasters such as landslides, floods, and flash floods. Major cities \nsuch as Thimphu, Phuentsholing, and Paro are encroaching on scarce agricultural land and \nunsafe  terrain,  including  steep  hillsides  and  floodplains.  This  situation,  coupled  with  rapid \nurbanization, is making it extremely difficult for Bhutan to achieve its vision of balanced and \nenvironmentally sustainable development. \n \n4.  An important focus of Bhutan\u2019s development strategy is the potential of growth centers in \nthe south near the Indian border to boost export-oriented industrial development. The advantages \nof these centers compared to others elsewhere in the country include better access to transport, \ncheaper  wage  labor  from  India,  access  to  cheaper  raw  materials,  and  an  abundant  and \ninexpensive power supply.2 Under its Economic Development Policy, 2010, Bhutan is prioritizing \ninfrastructure investments and improved connectivity to stimulate the development of these \ncenters as economic hubs for trade, transport, storage, and manufacturing.3 However, the centers \nare constrained by a dearth of adequate and suitable land for development. \n \n5.  Bhutan\u2019s Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2014\u20132018 identified Phuentsholing as a regional \ngrowth center that can be safely expanded through the construction of flood protection works and \nplanned urbanization.4 Located on two major trade corridors developed under the South Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation framework, Phuentsholing handles over 80% of Bhutan\u2019s \ntrade, and is the country\u2019s largest commercial and industrial hub and main trading gateway with \nIndia. Phuentsholing is also Bhutan\u2019s second most populous city, with 25,000 residents, and is \nanticipated to grow by 5% per year subject to land availability. Due to housing constraints in \nPhuentsholing, many Bhutanese people reside on the Indian side of the border in Jaigaon.5  \n \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the Amochhu Land \nDevelopment and Township Project (TA 9140-BHU), of which the Phuentsholing Township Development Project will \ndevelop the first 66 ha of 460 ha that are ultimately planned. The government requested the project\u2019s name be \nchanged to Phuentsholing Township Development Project following loan negotiations.  \n2  ADB. 2013.

Phuentsholing receives more inward migration from rural areas than any other city in Bhutan.  \n ", "2 \n \n6.  Land scarcity is a key growth constraint for Phuentsholing, which is physically confined by \nsteep and unstable Himalayan foothills, the Amochhu River, and international borders. The city is \nsignificantly exposed to precipitation- and earthquake-triggered landslides, which have a high \nmortality rate, and has also been significantly impacted by flood damage and riverbank erosion \nover the past 25 years. Flash floods triggered by monsoon rains are also occurring more \nfrequently due to dense development, the loss of natural ground cover, and climate change.6 \nSince 2002, the Government of Bhutan has been working to mitigate Phuentsholing\u2019s land \nconstraints and exposure to geophysical and flood hazards by constructing flood and erosion \ndefenses along the left and right banks of the Amochhu River, and expanding the city away from \nthe mountain slopes to areas of flat riparian land suitable for residential, commercial, institutional, \nand recreational uses.7  \n \n7.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported Phuentsholing\u2019s development through \n(i) the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Road Connectivity Project;8 (ii) various \nurban infrastructure initiatives under three separate investment projects;9 and (iii) a transport, \ntrade facilitation, and logistics project.10 These investments aim to enhance trade, productivity, \nand connectivity in the region, but do not address land and housing constraints or quality of life. \nThe project will complement and leverage these investments to provide an incubator for economic \ngrowth. Specifically, it will develop about 66 ha of vacant riparian land immediately adjacent to \nthe existing city along the left bank of the Amochhu River, based on the Amochhu Development \nMaster Plan.11 The project will also (i) construct river walls and common urban infrastructure, \n(ii) raise land, (iii) install a flood early warning system, (iv) implement a flood management plan, \nand (v) help the government prepare subsequent phases of development. \n \n8.  Beyond infrastructure investments, the project will help Bhutan improve its urban land \nmanagement and municipal service delivery. Like many other local governments, which are \nsimilarly  under-resourced,  the  Phuentsholing  municipality  currently  lacks  the  capacity  to \nimplement and operate the project. Therefore, the project will help the municipal government build \nthis capacity. Meanwhile, the government has entrusted the project\u2019s development and operation \nto Druk Holding and Investments Limited (DHI), a fully government-owned enterprise responsible \nfor  Bhutan\u2019s  strategic  income-generating  entities,  and  its  subsidiary  the  Construction \nDevelopment Corporation Limited (CDCL).12 Under this project, DHI and the CDCL are applying \n                                                \n6  The most devastating event in recent history was Cyclone Alia, which caused loss of land and infrastructure when it \noccurred in 2009. \n7  Government of Bhutan. 2004.

Amochhu Development Master Plan. Thimphu. The master plan is aligned with \nthe Phuentsholing Structure Plan 2013\u20132028. \n12  This includes the Bhutan Power Corporation Limited, Bhutan Telecom Limited, the Druk Green Power Corporation \nLimited, and the CDCL, among others. \n ", "3 \na new greenfield development and management modality by integrating the construction of river \ndefenses, building plots, and common urban infrastructure, as well as establishing a ring-fenced \ncorporate entity to deliver sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M). The project will also \nbuild the capacity of both the new township office and Phuentsholing municipality to ensure that \ncoordination and high service standards are achieved.  \n \n9.  The project is expected to provide opportunities for investment, create jobs, and relieve \nexisting  housing  pressures.  Integrated  planning  and  infrastructure,  and  strengthening  DHI \ninstitutionally will ensure the sustainability of investments in a climate- and disaster-resilient \ntownship. The project\u2019s commercial approach, support for investor outreach, and strong focus on \nO&M will ensure the new township\u2019s financial and operational sustainability. Moreover, expanding \nthe municipality\u2019s tax base will help it finance its own investments and operations.  \n \n10.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from disaster risk reduction initiatives \nand recent greenfield urban development projects within Bhutan and the South Asian region. \nLessons  are  incorporated  primarily  from  (i)  ADB\u2019s  recently  completed  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment project, which supported the planned southern expansion of Thimphu through a \nparticipatory process; and (ii) riverfront development projects in India, such as Naya Raipur \n(Chhattisgarh), Sabarmati (Ahmedabad), and Lavasa (Maharashtra). Most notably, the project \nwill incorporate the following lessons: (i) construct strong flood and erosion defenses that account \nfor climate change projections, install  flood early warning systems, and establish community-\nbased flood management procedures; (ii) phase capital expenditure in line with planned growth \ninstead of completing all components upfront, and develop land incrementally; and (iii) ensure a \nrobust  institutional  arrangement  for  O&M,  including  the  application  of  build\u2013operate  works \npackages. Positive lessons from other projects in Bhutan (footnote 9) have been applied to the \nproject\u2019s urban components, such as the successful expansion of Thimphu to accommodate an \nadditional 19,000 people (about 16% of the city\u2019s population) in livable urban environments \nwithout encroaching into hazardous areas. \n \n11.  Value added by ADB\u2019s assistance. During preparation, ADB has helped the government \nincorporate in the township master plan integrated urban planning principles that address the \nsocial,  economic,  environmental,  and  physical  aspects  of  the  new  township.  During \nimplementation,  ADB  will  (i)  streamline  coordination  between  the  new  township  and \nPhuentsholing municipality to enhance service delivery, connectivity, and linkages with the \nexisting city and ongoing and future multisector ADB projects; (ii) develop a sustainable and \neffective model for township management; (iii) ensure sustainability by embedding the project \nwithin longer term strategic plans for the wider economic area; and (iv) ensure that strong \nmarketing machinery is in place to attract investors. The project will improve the capacity and \ncompetitiveness of the Phuentsholing urban area and complement the efforts of the ADB-\nsupported South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program, which has enabled greater \nconnectivity and facilitated trade between Bhutan and other countries in the region. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  balanced  and  sustainable \ndevelopment of human settlements ensured (footnote 4); and (ii) smart growth principles applied \nin planning and development to promote Phuentsholing\u2019s cultural and social vibrancy (footnote 5). \nThe project will have the following outcome: Phuentsholing\u2019s urban area protected from floods \nand expanded with improved amenities and services.13 \n                                                \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Flood and erosion protection measures installed. The riverbank protection \nworks  will  protect  Phuentsholing  from  flooding  and  erosion.  Specifically,  the  project  will \n(i) construct 4 kilometers of erosion-resilient river walls to protect against a 100-year probable \nflood, (ii) raise ground levels behind the new walls to reclaim at least 66 ha of flood-protected land \nfor urban development, and (iii) establish and operationalize a flood early warning system and \nflood management plan in consultation with the community. \n \n14.  Output 2: Municipal infrastructure constructed. The project will provide serviced plots \nof land by constructing common urban infrastructure comprising (i) about 10 kilometers of roads \nwith footpaths, landscaping, and streetlights, which are planned in consultation with women; \n(ii) modern  drinking  water  supply  and  distribution  systems,  and  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment systems that service the new township and adjoining areas; (iii) a resource recovery \nsystem for managing solid waste in both the new and old townships; and (iv) power distribution \nand telecommunication systems throughout the new township. The plots will be leased to \nresidential and commercial investors as prescribed by the Amochhu Development Master Plan, \nwhich emphasizes principles of sustainable urban design such as maximum walkability, greenery, \nand open spaces. \n \n15.  Output 3: Township management systems installed. The project will (i) establish asset \nmanagement systems, (ii) build the capacity of township staff to ensure sustainable and effective \nurban management, and (iii) initiate investor promotion activities. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  Riverbank protection and embankment works. The river walls were designed following \na thorough evaluation of hydrologic, hydraulic, and sediment transport conditions to assess \nprobable flood levels, the projected impact of climate change, sedimentation, and scour. Two \nwidely accepted methods\u2014flood frequency analysis and synthetic unit hydrograph analysis\u2014\nwere used to derive the design flood estimate for the Amochhu River at Phuentsholing. Flood \nevents were simulated using one- and two-dimensional computer models, with sensitivity testing \nof various parameters to confirm the designs. Physical modelling of the ultimate development \nscenario will be undertaken during project implementation. The walls have a 100-year flood \ndesign standard and 1-meter freeboard between the design flood levels and building platform \nlevels. This is a normal standard of protection for urban areas adjacent to major rivers. The impact \nof climate change on future flood magnitudes may reduce the freeboard by up to 33%, which is \nacceptable. Cross-drainage structures have been designed to convey 50-year floods from local \ncatchments, including an allowance for climate change. The foundation design of the walls \naccounts for scour, and any accumulation of sedimentation will be managed during O&M. \nAdditional erosion control measures, such as installation of spurs, will be considered using the \nphysical model. A flood early warning system and management plan will be established under the \nproject to ensure residents\u2019 safety during all flood events. \n \n22.  Urban planning and municipal infrastructure. An urban master plan and development \ncontrol regulations was prepared for the new urban area and is consistent with the project\u2019s vision \nand appropriate for the country\u2019s context. The plan and regulations will ensure that the new \ntownship is livable, vibrant, inclusive, affordable, sustainable, and safe. The plan and regulations \nalso guided the design of common urban infrastructure to be installed under the project, including \nlocal roads, drainage, footpaths, parks, treated water supply and distribution systems, sewerage \ncollection  and  treatment  systems,  telecommunication  facilities,  and  electricity  distribution \nsystems. The works contract for constructing the common urban infrastructure will include 5 years \nof O&M to augment the CDCL\u2019s capacity to operate the new township while transferring skills. \nThe designs incorporate hard and soft linkages with the existing city. For example, the water \nsupply and sewerage treatment systems will service existing built up areas adjacent to the new \ntownship, solid waste management facilities will be shared, and traffic management studies are \nplanned to mitigate or avoid traffic congestion. \n \n23.  Sustainable township management systems. The project will establish a township \nmanagement office within the project area and will strengthen the CDCL\u2019s ability to manage, \n ", "7 \noperate, and maintain the new township effectively and sustainably. This includes installing \nsupervisory control and data acquisition technology to operate the water supply and sanitation \nfacilities,  and  introducing  modern  asset  management,  customer  service,  and  financial \nmanagement  systems.  The  project  will  also  help  market  the  new  township  to  potential \ninternational  and  national  commercial  investors,  and  provide  transaction  advisory  services. \nCapacity-building activities will benefit both new township and Phuentsholing municipality staff. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic  analysis.  Increased  land  value  accounts  for  about  76%  of  total  project \nbenefits, with reduced flood damage to infrastructure and increased benefits from water and \npower supply accounting for the remaining 24%. Given several uncertainties related to the project, \na risk modeling framework was used to estimate the value of the project benefits. The economic \nanalysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with a mean economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) of 11.3%. The project\u2019s economic feasibility is not sensitive to unfavorable changes \nin investment costs and economic benefits; the EIRR only drops below the economic opportunity \ncost of capital of 9% if investment costs increase by 30% or benefits decrease by 22%. The \nproject\u2019s EIRR is far less sensitive to changes in management and O&M costs. The poverty impact \nratio was estimated at 5.2%. It is assumed that occupants of residential housing\u2014including social \nhousing reserved for the poor\u2014will value the new land they occupy at higher lease rates than \nwould be payable to the government, primarily because the quality of urban infrastructure and \nservices will be much better than can be found elsewhere in Bhutan. \n \n25.  Financial analysis. The project\u2019s financial sustainability was assessed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005). The project\u2019s \ncash inflows mainly comprise revenues generated from the lease of newly developed land, which \nthe government will promote to investors with new financial and regulatory incentives. Revenue \nwill also include water supply, wastewater treatment, and solid waste management service \ncharges. Although the project will not fully recover its capital costs, it will generate enough \ncashflow to pay for O&M and its debt service obligations, since a portion of the capital costs is \ngrant-financed. Expected financial internal rate of return of 4.3% is slightly lower than the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 4.5%, mainly due to the opportunity cost of ADB grants. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  Financial management. A financial management assessment of DHI and the CDCL was \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of \nProjects.15 The project\u2019s overall risk assessment is low. The CDCL will assign a suitably qualified \nfull-time project accountant to be trained in ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures. Further, the Royal \nAudit  Authority  of  Bhutan,  an  independent  and  nonpartisan  institution  authorized  to  audit \ngovernment agencies, will audit the CDCL\u2019s financial statements annually in accordance with \ninternational  auditing  standards.  An  integrity  due  diligence  of  DHI  and  the  CDCL  yielded \nsatisfactory results. \n \n27.  Procurement. The procurement of goods and works will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), and all consultants will be recruited following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nA procurement capacity assessment concluded that the project\u2019s overall procurement risk is \n                                                \n15  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "8 \nmoderate.16 Procurement specialists will help the CDCL prepare and evaluate bids. Funds will be \nallocated under the project to provide procurement training to the implementing agency and local \ncontractors. \n \n28.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, DHI, and the CDCL. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  14).  The  Anti-Corruption \nCommission of Bhutan, the constitutional anticorruption agency, is empowered to investigate any \nproject irregularities. The CDCL will follow government rules and procedures for all expenses and \nrevenue items, and will establish both a project website to ensure transparency and a system for \nhandling complaints related to contracts and procurement. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  The  erosion  and  annual  flooding  experienced  by  the  existing  municipality \ndisproportionately affects the poor, who lack the resources to cope and recover quickly. By \naddressing this problem, the project is expected to boost the economy, create more and better \nemployment opportunities in the longer term, and help alleviate poverty. Moreover, adding \nhousing stock to the new township will relieve pressure in the existing municipality by making \nhousing more affordable. Therefore, the project will directly benefit vulnerable local inhabitants in \nseveral ways. The second project output includes the development of recreation areas, pedestrian \nsafety features such as streetlights, public toilets, road markings, ramps, and footpaths. Women \nand  women\u2019s  organizations  will  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  public  planning  meetings \nassociated with the project, especially those related to the development of municipal infrastructure \nand the flood early warning system. The civil works contracts will include labor provisions to \nensure  that  women  and  men  receive  equal  pay  for  equal  work,  and  that  HIV  awareness \ncampaigns are conducted for laborers and local communities. A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy has been prepared.17 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.18 \n \n31.  Environment  (category  A).  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  significant \nenvironmental impact. However, due to its location on Bhutan\u2019s border with India and upstream \nof  India\u2019s  Jadalpara  National  Park,  the  project  has  been  classified  as  category  A  for  the \nenvironment, and an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study was prepared.19 The EIA\u2019s \nscope covers the full extent of the government\u2019s ultimate plan to develop 460 ha of new urban \nland along both banks of the Amochhu River under their Amochhu Land Development and \nTownship Project, although the current project area is limited to 66 ha on the left bank. The EIA \nfound that most impacts occur during construction due to river bed levelling, the transportation of \nconstruction materials and equipment, and the construction of urban facilities. These impacts are \ntemporary, local, and reversible. Mitigation measures have been proposed, and an environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) has been prepared and will be strictly implemented throughout the \nconstruction period. Nonetheless, the project may impact aquatic ecology due to river bed \n                                                \n16  Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n19 The EIA has also been prepared in accordance with Bhutan\u2019s Environmental Assessment Act 2000. \n ", "9 \nlevelling during construction and operation. The EMP includes a mitigation measure to avoid \nspecies disruption by maintaining some natural river flows during the river bed levelling activities; \nif environmental monitoring finds a decline in any important fish species, replenishment will be \nundertaken. The EIA also confirmed that elephants occasionally roam along the right bank. The \nproject will finance a more detailed study of elephant behavior and movement patterns to develop \nappropriate mitigation measures to reduce impacts on their habitat if the right bank is eventually \ndeveloped. During the EIA\u2019s preparation, two public consultations were carried out and the study \nfindings were disclosed. The EIA report was disclosed through ADB\u2019s website on 29 May 2017.20 \n \n32.  The implementing agency has adequate capacity to manage the potential impacts. The \nenvironmental officer will be responsible for addressing overall environmental concerns related to \nthe project. The project implementation unit will oversee the overall implementation of the EIA\u2019s \nrecommendations and the EMP, and will be assisted by the environment specialist under the \nproject implementation consultants. The contractors will have an environment and safeguard \nspecialist who will manage environmental impacts related to construction. The project will also \nengage an external monitoring expert to monitor compliance with environmental safeguards \nindependently. The project grievance redress mechanism will be used to resolve complaints in a \ntimely and systematic manner. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). As the entire 66 ha \narea to be developed for flood defenses and the new township is under government control, no \nhouseholds face resettlement, and no private structures will be affected. A poverty and social \nassessment found no indigenous people, as described in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, \nliving near or affected by the project. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n34.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nLower than expected demand for  The grant financing will be on-granted to DHI, and favorable \nleasable land  on-lending terms will apply to the loan financing amount. \nThese measures will enable DHI to offer competitive lease \nrates.
