In  Bangladesh,  growth  in  primary \neducation  since  the  1990s\u2212gross  enrollment  rate  increased  from  63%  in  1995  to  108%  in \n2010\u2212has  resulted  in  a  rapid  expansion  of  the  number  of  secondary  schools,  teachers,  and \nenrollment  and  completion  rates.  Enrollment  in  secondary  education  has  increased  by  more \nthan  150%  since  1990. The number  of  secondary  education  institutions  almost  doubled  in  the \nsame period. In 2010, Bangladesh had 19,040 secondary schools (up from 18,500 in 2005) with \na  total  enrollment  of  7.9  million  (53%  girls),  and  8,146  madrasahs  (religious  schools)  with  an \nenrollment of 1.7 million (57% girls). The gross enrollment rate was 47% (49% for girls) in 2010 \nup from  43% (47% for girls)  in  2005.  Dropout  rates have declined from  81%  in  2005 (83% for \ngirls)  to  57%  (54%  for  girls)  in  2010  for  secondary  grades  6\u201310.  The  pass  rates  for  the \nsecondary school certificate have increased from 53% in 2005 to 78% in 2010; and from 59% in \n2005  to  72%  in  2010  for  the  higher  secondary  school  certificate.  These  achievements  have \nbeen  possible  due  to  sustained  support  from  successive  governments  through  stipend \nprograms,  curriculum  improvements,  teacher  development  and,  more  recently,  a  focus  on \nstudent performance. \n \nThe  percentage  of  untrained  teachers  has  declined from  60%  in 2004 to  33%  in 2010, \n4. \nwhich is still high. The proportion of female teachers has increased gradually from 20% in 2005 \nto  23%  in  2010.  The  government  policy  that  at  least  20%  of  teachers  in  rural  schools  and  at \nleast 40% in urban schools should be female supported an increase in the number of schools \nwith female teachers. With the growth in the number of secondary institutions, the government\u2019s \nadministrative and supervisory capacity has been stretched, and it is now inadequate to fulfill its \nresponsibilities  effectively.  The  government  recognizes  the  need  to  strengthen  effective \nmonitoring  and  supervision  of  teacher  training  institutions  and  teachers  in  the  classrooms  to \ndeliver quality education at all levels. \n\n \n5. \nContinuing  investment  in  teacher  development  is  essential  as  international  research \nshows  that  a  common  feature  of  all  successful  education  systems  is  a  clear  focus  on  teacher \nquality.  While  Bangladesh  has  made  significant  progress  in  providing  access  to  secondary \neducation  and  has  achieved  gender  parity  up  to  grade  10,  the  quality  of  teaching,  and  hence \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2004.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fstudent learning, continues to be a major concern. Students who complete secondary education \nare unprepared to enter the workforce in higher job categories or continue to tertiary education. \nPoor  and  disadvantaged  students  are  the  most  affected  since  they  have  limited  choice  of \nschools,  cannot  afford  additional  tuition,  and  usually  come  from  a  social  background  that \nattaches  limited  value  to  education.  Girls'  enrollment  has  improved  significantly,  but  their \nperformance and retention deteriorate particularly after grade 9. In some areas, more girls are in \nschools  than  boys,  which  will  require  measures  to  ensure  that  boys  attend  and  complete \nsecondary education. \n\n \n6. \nA major constraint to the provision of quality secondary education in Bangladesh is the \nshortage  of  qualified  and  trained  secondary  school  teachers.  Overall  coordination  and \ninstitutional  links  between  teacher  training  and  oversight  institutions  are  weak.  Teaching  as  a \ncareer is not valued and there are no incentives to reward teaching effort and excellence. Lack \nof  motivation  and  absenteeism  among  teachers  are  widespread  although  improving.  The \nproblem is exacerbated by a lack of teacher and head teacher competency standards, on which \nto  build  a  quality  teacher  training  system.  Also,  teachers  do  not  necessarily  apply  the  modern \nstudent  centered  teaching  skills  acquired  during  training  in  the  classroom.  This  is  due  to  a \nmultitude  of  transfer  obstacles  (overcrowded  classes,  lack  of  incentives,  lack  of  appropriate \nteaching and learning materials, poor supervision, etc.), which are difficult to overcome.  \n  \nTQI-I has contributed to the training of more than 220,000 secondary teachers through \n7. \nthe  adoption  of  policy  reforms,  the  introduction  of  continuous  professional  development  (CPD) \nprograms,  the  strengthening  of  teacher  training  institutions,  and  the  development  of  a  pool  of \nteacher trainers. TQI-I has targeted classroom teaching and learning through a CPD approach, \nwhich includes supporting and monitoring the usage of student centered teaching approaches. \nAn  initial  assessment  by  TQI-I  found  that  TQI-I  training  had  made  a  significant  impact  on  the \nclassroom  performance  of  the  observed  teachers  in  more  than  70%  of  the  schools.  The \nassessment  measured  the  usage  of  student  centered  teaching  skills  as  instructed  during  the \nCPD.  With  the  support  of  TQI-I,  the  Nongovernment  Teachers  Registration  and  Certification \nAuthority  (NTRCA)  was  established  by  law  to  institute  a  common  set  of  quality  standards  for \nregistering eligible teachers and recruiting them through school management committees. The \ngovernment  also  established  the  National  Teacher  Education  Council  (NTEC)  to  common \nstandards  for  teacher  training  providers.  However,  the  NTEC  has  not  become  fully  functional. \nThe curriculum and textbooks are undergoing major revisions to move away from rote learning \nand  into creative thinking  and  practical  work  skills. With  these  efforts,  progress is  being made \ntoward developing and fully implementing an integrated teacher quality assurance system.  \n \n8. \nTQI-II  draws  on  the  following  lessons  from  TQI-I  and  the  country  assistance  program \nevaluation: 4  (i)  changing  classroom  practices  and  teacher  behavior  requires  reinforcement \nthrough  CPD  instead  of  ad  hoc  one-off  training;  (ii)  pre-service  teacher  education  should \nin  approved  teacher \nemphasize  subject  knowledge  with  skills  in  pedagogy  anchored \ncompetencies; (iii) in-service training should contribute to teacher qualification requirements for \nregistration; (iv) effective teacher training requires strong coordination and shared commitment \namong  central,  field,  and  school  stakeholders;  (v)  head  teachers  should  serve  as  instructional \nleaders  to  monitor,  mentor,  and  motivate  teachers  to  apply  new  knowledge  and  skills  to \ntransform  teaching  and  learning  in  the  classroom;  (vi)  initial  efforts  to  establish  an  integrated \nteacher  training  system  should  be  sustained  with  adequate  expertise  and  budget;  and  (vii) \nproject-based  support  from  development  partners  should  be  harmonized  and  aligned  with  the \ncountry system and policy priorities.  \n\n                                                \n4   Asian Development Bank. 2009.

These  features  and  innovations  are  building  on  the \nachievements and identified gaps of TQI-I.5  \n \n10.  With  the  approval  by  Parliament  of  the  NEP  in  2010,  the  government  embarked  on  a \nprogram  of  comprehensive  reform  to  strengthen  equitable  access,  quality,  and  relevance  of \neducation  in  Bangladesh.  In  2011,  a  new  phase  of  the  primary  education  reform  program \nstarted,  with  the  Asian Development  Bank (ADB)  as  one of  the key  partners. TQI-I  and TQI-II \nare core building blocks in strengthening the quality of secondary education as envisaged in the \nNEP.  ADB  is  also  supporting  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  to  develop  a  road  map  to \nimplement the NEP, with a focus on developing a sector-wide approach in secondary education, \nin  consultation  with  development  partners.  While  only  a  few  development  partners  (ADB,  the \nCanadian International Development Agency, the Department for International Development of \nthe  United  Kingdom, the  United  Nations Children\u2019s  Fund  [UNICEF],  and  the World Bank,  etc.) \nare currently involved in secondary education, more are likely to join. A sector-wide approach is \nbeing  discussed  to  strengthen  overall  coordination  and  leadership  of  the  government  in \npartnership with the private sector and civil society. TQI-II is in line with the Country Partnership \nStrategy,  2011\u20132015  and  the  Sixth Five  Year  Plan;  both emphasize improving  the quality  and \nrelevance of education and the skills shortage.6   \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  of  TQI-II  is  improved  learning  outcomes  in  secondary  education.  The \noutcome is a strengthened, integrated, and more inclusive secondary teacher education system.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\nfour  outputs:  (i)  strengthened \n\nThe  outcome  will  be  achieved \n\n12. \nteacher \nthrough \ndevelopment  and  institutional  and  organizational  capacity;  (ii)  enhanced  teacher  training \nprograms and delivery systems (pre-service, in-service including CPD); (iii) targeted support for \ninclusive education; and (iv) quality project management.  \n \nOutput 1: Strengthened teacher development and institutional and organizational \n13. \ncapacity.  The  project  will  support  the  NTEC,  NTRCA,  training  providers 7 ,  and  DSHE  in \ndeveloping  an  integrated  quality  assurance  system  of  setting  and  implementing  national \nstandard  competencies  for  teachers  and  head  teachers  in  order  to  improve  the  quality  of \nsecondary education teachers. This output will be achieved through the following four activities:  \n\n                                                \n5   TQI-I Achievements, Gaps and Issues, and Implications for TQI-II (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n6   ADB. 2011.

Roles and responsibilities for \nsetting  standard  competencies for teachers  and minimum  standards for  training \nproviders,  registering  teachers  and  maintaining  registration,  aligning  teacher \ntraining programs with the competencies, and monitoring classroom performance \nwill  be  articulated.  A  1-year  costed  action  plan  will  be  prepared  to  implement \ninstitutional and organizational reforms. A study to propose an attractive teacher \ncareer path will be undertaken. \nThe capacity of the DSHE to use evidence-based planning and management to \ndevelop and monitor teacher quality will be strengthened. \nSchool-level  leadership  will  be  strengthened  to  monitor  and  mentor  teachers\u2019 \nclassroom  performance.  Head  teachers  will  be  trained  to  become  instructional \nleaders. \nPartnership arrangements with government, public and private training providers, \nand  information  technology  companies  will  strengthen  teacher  education  and \nteaching  practice.  The  results  orientation  of  the  existing  innovation  and \ndevelopment  funding  mechanisms  will  be  further  strengthened  to  improve  the \nquality of training, teaching, and learning in secondary education. \n\n \n14. \nOutput  2:  Enhanced  teacher  training  programs  and  delivery  systems. The project \nwill  enhance  pre-service  education  and  in-service  training  (short-term  certificate  training  to \nprepare teachers to attain registration and CPD to upgrade teachers\u2019 knowledge and skills). All \ntraining  programs  will  be  aligned  with  the  standard  competencies  for  teachers  and  head \nteachers  to  ensure  synergy  from  different  training  programs  within  an  integrated  teacher \ndevelopment framework. This output will be achieved through five activities:  \n\nA  modernized  and  integrated  pre-service  teacher  education  program  will  be \nimplemented. A bachelor\u2019s degree program (3- or 4-year program) on a technical \nsubject will be closely linked with a 1-year pedagogical training program. This will \nbe  achieved  through  establishing  partnerships  between  universities  and  TTCs. \nThe completion of both programs will lead to a bachelor\u2019s degree of education or \na  master\u2019s  degree  of  education.    The  current  1-year  pedagogical  training \nprogram will be revised based on the standard competencies for teachers. \nTeachers  will  be  assisted  to  attain  registration  and  formal  qualification  by \nproviding  short-term  certificate  training  programs  and  adopting  recognition  of \nprior learning schemes that will credit teachers for previous training.  \nTeachers  will  be  assisted  to  update  knowledge  and  skills  for  maintaining \nregistration through CPD. CPD programs will be developed under the project with \na special focus on computer-aided learning in the classroom.  \nComputer-aided teaching and learning will be piloted in 27 selected schools and \nTTCs  covering the  nine zones  (administrative  divisions  for  secondary  education \nmanagement). \nThe  capacity  of  teacher  training  providers  will  be  strengthened  by  establishing \ntraining \nincluding  public  and \nnongovernment schools, in areas that do not have any teacher training facilities. \nThis capacity will also be enhanced by  providing additional resources to eligible \ntraining providers, and by developing centers of excellence at selected TTCs for \nteaching English, mathematics, and science. \n\nin  51  cluster  center  schools, \n\nfacilities \n\n  \nOutput  3:  Targeted  support  for  inclusive  education.  The  project  will  support \n15. \nincreasing  the  proportion  of  female  teachers  and  female  members  of  school  management \ncommittees,  and  will  target  disadvantaged  areas  with  low  student  performance.

This output will be \nachieved through three main activities:  \n\nInclusiveness  of  education  will  be  further  strengthened  by  developing  a  new \ntraining policy, engaging civil society in advocacy, and targeting remedial classes \nin disadvantaged areas where student performance is lagging.  \nParticipation of female teachers and teachers from disadvantaged groups will be \nincreased  by  targeting  scholarships  to  attract  female  teachers  and  by  providing \nincentive  packages  to  teachers,  especially  women,  to  seek  appointments  in \ndisadvantaged areas.  \nProportion  of  female  members  in  school  management  committees  will  be \nincreased  to  25%  by  running  advocacy  campaigns  and  providing  capacity \nbuilding training.  \n\n \n16. \nOutput 4: Quality project management. The project will improve project management, \nwith  a  focus  on  financial  management  to  mitigate  risks  associated  with  organizing  a  large \nvolume  of  training  sessions.  Monitoring  and  reporting  will  be  strengthened  with  a  focus  on \nteacher performance. This output will be achieved through two activities:  \n\nThe  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  strengthened  to  implement \nenhanced  financial  management  procedures,  especially  for  training  sessions  in \nthe  field,  provide  efficient  support  to  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  and \nproject  implementation  committee  (PIC),  mobilize  partnership  and  ensure \neffective  working  arrangement  for  consultants.  The  MOE  will  ensure  timely \nmobilization of PMU staff with appropriate expertise.  \nStronger  monitoring  and  reporting  will  be  ensured  by  the  DSHE  preparing  an \nthe  Bangladesh  Bureau  of \nannual \nEducational \nInformation  and  Statistics  undertaking  a  biennial  census  of \nsecondary  education  teachers,  and  the  PMU  preparing  regular  analytical \nmonitoring and evaluation reports focusing on teacher performance.       \n\nteacher  performance  review \n\nreport, \n\n \nD. \n\n17. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $85.0 million equivalent (Table 1).  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \nA.

The economic viability of the project has been assessed based on \nthe  benefits  and  costs  associated  with  TQI-II.  The  benefits  include  improved  teacher  quality, \nand  a  reduction  in  internal  inefficiency  of  education.  The  priced  economic  benefits  include  (i) \ndirect  benefit  for  teachers  in  terms  of  increased  productivity  and  wages,  (ii)  improved  internal \nefficiency  for  reducing  system  wastage  caused  by  dropouts  and  repetition,  and  (iii)  improved \nexternal efficiency for students with increased employability and higher wages (enhanced value \nfor money). The three major streams of economic costs are (i) the direct project cost; (ii) indirect \nproject-related  costs  including  replacement  and  or  upgrading  of  capital  investments,  such  as \ncomputer  and  laboratory  equipment,  and  additional  operational  and  maintenance  costs \ngenerated  by  new  infrastructure  beyond  the  project  period  to  sustain the  project  benefits;  and \n(iii) costs to cover salary increases for newly trained teachers. The project is estimated to yield a \nnet present value of $64.5 million. The economic internal rate of return associated with this net \npresent value is estimated at 22.7%, assuming a discount rate of 12%. This suggests that TQI-II \nwill be a sound investment.9 \n \n                                                \n9   Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nFiscal  sustainability.  The  financial  affordability  and  sustainability  of  the  project  is \n24. \nanalyzed  based  on  the  medium-term  budgetary  framework  in  the  National  Strategy  for \nAccelerated  Poverty  Reduction  II,  2009\u20132012  and  the  Sixth  Five  Year  Plan  (footnote  6).  The \nTQI-II allocation ranges from 3% to 8% of secondary education expenditure during the project \nperiod.  While  the  government  is  committed  to  allocate  the  required  budget  for  teacher \ndevelopment,  government  funds  would  be  inadequate  to  meet  training  needs  without  ADB \ncontribution.  Developing  an  integrated  teacher  development  system  will  require  sustained \ninvestments.  The  long-term  sustainability  of  TQI-II  will  depend  on  two  factors:  (i)  the  ability  of \nthe  government  to  allocate  adequate  budget  for  teacher  development  over  time,  and  (ii) \nimprovements  in  efficiency  and  quality.  Given  the  positive  outlook  for  gross  domestic  product \ngrowth and the NEP\u2019s call for major reforms, allocations to the education sector are expected to \nincrease and secondary education will receive more resources.  \n  \nB. \n  \n25. \nRigorous  financial  due  diligence  work  was  carried  out  by  reviewing  the  arrangements \nunder  the  ongoing  TQI-I.  Based  on  this  analysis  the  following  measures  are  incorporated  to \nimprove  governance:  (i)  provision  of  adequate  relevant  staff  in  the  PMU;  (ii)  inclusion  of \ntechnical  experts  on  the  PIC  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of  technical  aspects  of \nproposed reforms, including aligning all types of teacher training with teacher and head teacher \nstandard competencies; (iii) introduction of partnership arrangements for quality assurance; (iv) \nstrengthening  school-level  leadership  by  institutionalizing  monitoring  of  teachers\u2019  classroom \nperformance  with  DSHE  oversight  to  ensure  accountability;  and  (v)  emphasis  on  advocacy \ncampaigns for creating awareness, applying transparent criteria and procedures for selection of \npartner institutions and training programs, and disclosure of information on the project website. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \nthe  government,  MOE,  and  DSHE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 8). \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThere  is  a  growing  consensus  among  government,  nongovernment  organizations,  and \nprofessionals that inclusion of marginalized groups in mainstream schooling is the only way to \nprovide  means  for  education  and  learning  for  all  children.  Despite  rapid  growth  in  secondary \nenrollment,  around  57%  of  the  students  drop  out.  This  rate  is  much  higher  for  students  from \npoor  and  disadvantaged  groups.  These  students  are  most  affected  since  they  have  limited \neducational options. Building on the TQI-I experience, TQI-II will focus on (i) providing remedial \nclasses  in  the  most  lagging  upazilas,  where  student  performance  in  secondary  and  higher \nsecondary  school  certificates  is  low;  (ii)  establishing  training  facilities  in  51  cluster  center \nschools  in  districts  that  do  not  have  facilities to  train  teachers  to  serve  disadvantaged  groups; \nand (iii) piloting computer aided teaching and learning in 27 schools and TTCs to reduce poverty \nby enhancing access to better quality education. \n \n27. \nGender  and  development.  Bangladesh  has  achieved  gender  parity  in  secondary \neducation  enrollment  and  retention.  The  proportion  of  female  teachers  in  secondary  schools \nalso  shows  an  increasing  trend.  The  provision  of  two  female  members  on  the  school \nmanagement  committees  has  created  a  positive  environment  for  recruitment  and  retention  of \nfemale teachers. The project includes (i) undertaking mass awareness programs to encourage \nand attract women to the teaching profession; (ii) raising general awareness with emphasis on \nthe  positive  accomplishments  and  successes  of  female  teachers;  (iii)  structuring  incentive \npackages, especially for remote and rural areas, to motivate female teachers to join and remain \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\f         9 \n \n\nin the teaching profession; and (iv) introducing mechanisms to increase the proportion of female \nmembers on school management committees (from 15.7% to 25% in 2016). The gender action \nplan  prepared  and  implemented  under  TQI-I  has  been  updated  to  (i)  help  upazilas  and \nsecondary  education  institutions  in  rural  areas  achieve  the  target  of  at  least  20%  female \nteachers;  and  (ii)  enhance  the  proportion  of  female  members  on  school  management \ncommittees to at least 25%.10 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment  (category  C).  TQI-II  will  support  construction  of  training  facilities  in  51 \ncluster  center  schools.  The  project  has  adequate  arrangements  for  site  selection,  design, \nconstruction, operations, maintenance, and compliance measures, and is not expected to create \nany  significant  or  long-term  adverse  environmental  impact.  An environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared,  and  the  subprojects  for  construction  of  training \nfacilities  and  other  civil  works  will  be  identified  after  the  Board  approval.  The  EARF  has \nadequate  provisions  to  respond  to  any  environmental  issue  that  may  arise  during  TQI-II \nimplementation.  The  borrower  also  has  shown  interest  in  adopting  environmental  safeguards \nand  compliance  measures,  along  with  strengthening  institutional  capacity  and  committing  to \nmanage  environmental  risks  and  fully  implement  the  EARF.  The  DSHE  will  prepare  and \ndisclose  semi-annual  monitoring  reports  that  describe  progress  with  implementation  of  the \nEARF, and compliance issues and corrective actions, if any. \n   \n29. \nResettlement (category C). Social safeguard issues are not expected to arise since no \nmajor construction is anticipated. The proposed construction of training venues in cluster center \nschools  is  limited  to  the  extension  of  small  structures  within  the  existing  school  premises. \nSubprojects for the construction of teaching facilities will be identified after the Board approval. \nTherefore, a resettlement framework has been prepared for the project, to ensure that any issue \nthat  may  invoke  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  policy  would  be  adequately  addressed.  The \nborrower  has  also  demonstrated  adequate  institutional  capacity,  and  commitment  to  manage \nsocial risks and properly implement the resettlement framework. \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Three  districts\u2014Bandarban,  Khagrachari,  and \nRangamati, in Chittagong Hill Tracts\u2014are home to the largest proportion of the country\u2019s small \nethnic communities. The rest are dispersed and generally live in isolated settlements among the \nmainstream  population.  Under  TQI-II,  one  outreach  center  established  under  TQI-I  will  be \nstrengthened and two cluster center schools will be established to serve the target population. \nThe subprojects for construction of teaching facilities will be identified after the Board approval. \nA  small  ethnic  communities  planning  framework  has  been  developed  for  the  project,  which \ndefines  possible  mitigating  measures.11 The  borrower  has  also  shown  adequate  institutional \ncapacity and commitment to manage the social risks and to comply with information disclosure \nand consultation requirements through implementation of the framework. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nAmong  the  key  project  implementation  risks  and  mitigating  measures,  four  are \n31. \nsummarized  here.  First,  sufficient  budget  allocations  must  be  provided  to  sustain  continuous \nprofessional development activities after the project ends. Since these training programs should \nbe provided regularly to reinforce changes in teaching and learning practices, the continuation \n\n                                                \n10  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  The planning framework is in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nof follow-up training is crucial under the government\u2019s revenue budget. Second, teacher training \nmust  be made  more responsive to  quality  improvements  and labor  market  needs. This  will  be \naddressed  by  implementing  teacher  and  head  teacher  competencies,  with  head  teachers \nmentoring  teachers  and  monitoring  teachers\u2019  classroom  performance.  The  project  also \nproposes  partnering  with  selected  universities  to  make  training  providers  more  relevant  and \nresponsive. Third, increased in-service teacher training is likely to disrupt regular classes since \nparticipating teachers may be out of class without proper arrangements for substitute teachers. \nTQI-II  proposes  to  conduct  all  training  programs  during  holidays  or  periods  when  classroom \nactivities are least likely to be affected (after exams, or at the beginning of the academic year). \nFinally, fiduciary risks associated with training  sessions conducted in the field will be mitigated \nby  enhancing  financial  management,  reducing  advances  for  training,  ensuring  quarterly \nreconciliation  between  bank  statements  and  expenditure  reporting  from  each  training  venue, \nand introducing a system of sample verification of training participants. In addition, to strengthen \nchecks and balances no single agency will be made responsible for both teacher nomination for \ntraining  programs  and  reporting  participation  of  teachers  in  training.  Selection  of  teachers  for \ntraining  will  be  done  from  an  enhanced  and  up-to-date  education  management  information \nsystem. \n  \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe government, MOE, and DSHE have assured ADB that implementation of the project \n32. \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.  The  government,  MOE,  and  DSHE \nhave  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement.  \n \n33. \nTo  ensure  funds  are  used  for  their  intended  purpose,  the  government  and  ADB  will \nagree  on  the  detailed  eligibility  criteria,  selection  process,  and  disbursement  procedures  for \ntraining  activities,  partnership  grants,  grants  for  innovation  and  development,  and  teacher \nincentive packages before withdrawals can be made for these expenditures. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n34. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR45,120,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second \nTeaching  Quality  Improvement  in  Secondary  Education  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  with  an  interest  charge  at the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during the grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n8 March 2012\n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1        11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \nNational examination results \n(annual) \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\nAssumption \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \n\nImproved \nlearning \noutcomes in \nsecondary \neducation  \n\n \n\nOutcome \n\nStrengthened, \nintegrated, and \nmore inclusive \nsecondary \nteacher \neducation \nsystem  \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\nRange between secondary school \ncertificate examination pass rate of \ntop 10% and bottom 10% upazilas : \n10% by 2020 (2010 baseline: 24.3%) \n(m/f) \n\nRange between higher secondary \nschool certificate examination pass \nrate between top 10% and bottom \n10% of upazilas :15% by 2020 (2010 \nbaseline: 30.3%) (m/f) \n\nPercentage of teachers showing use \nof teaching competencies in the \nclassroom by 2017 (m/f)a  \n\nPercentage of incumbent secondary \nteachers meeting NEP qualification \nrequirements: 90% by 2017 for all \nteachers and for female teachers \n(2010 baseline: 66.5% for all \nteachers, 70.3 % for female teachers)  \n\nNational examination results \n(annual) \n\nImpact study TQI-I 2012 \n(baseline) \n\nAssumptions \n\nAnnual teacher \nperformance report \n\nAnnual teacher \nperformance report  \n\nNEP implemented, \nleading to formal \nregistration of all teachers \nto monitor if NEP \nqualification and other \napplicable requirements \nare met by all teachers  by \n2017 \n\nGovernment and key \nstakeholders support \npartnership between \nTTCs and universities to \nmake teacher training \nmore responsive  \n\nGovernment provides \nstrong support for gender \nequity and pro-poor \ntargeted investments \n\nGovernment increases \nfinancing to \ninstitutionalize and \nsustain improvements in \nteacher quality \n\n \n\nApproved one year action \nplan \n\nAssumptions \n\nPercentage of new secondary \nteacher recruits meeting NEP \nqualification requirements: 100% by \n2017 (m/f) a  \n\nAnnual teacher \nperformance report  \n\nNCTRA data base \n\nPercentage of schools meeting \nfemale teachers target (20% in rural \nschools, 40% in urban schools): \n100% by 2017 (2010 Baseline: 43%)  \n\nAnnual teacher \nperformance report \n\nPercentage of female teachers: 28% \nby 2017 (2010 baseline: 23%)  \n\nAnnual teacher \nperformance report \n\nOutputs \n\n1.
