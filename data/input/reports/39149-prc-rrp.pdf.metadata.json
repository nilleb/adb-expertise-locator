An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  completed;  the \nsummary was circulated to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board \nand made public through the ADB website on 9 April 2007.  \n \n\nroad \n\n(iii) improving \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nProject Description  The Project is located in western Guangxi, one of the poorest areas in \nthe PRC. With a per capita gross domestic product that is 63% of the \nnational  average,  Guangxi  ranks  27th  among  the  31 administrative \nareas.  The  Project  is  designed  to  promote  pro-poor  sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  western  Guangxi,  preparing  it  to  cope  with  an \nincreasingly important role in regional cooperation and trading with Viet \nNam.  The  Project  will  provide  an  integrated  road  transport  network  in \nwestern  Guangxi  by  (i)  constructing  the  177  kilometer  (km)  Longlin\u2013\nBaise  expressway;  (ii)  upgrading  the  associated  1,060  km  of  local \nroads; \ntransport  services  by  constructing \n50 township  bus  stations  and  implementing  passenger  bus  route \nlicensing  reforms;  (iv)  improving  road  maintenance  by  implementing \nrural  road  maintenance  policy  reform;  and  (v)  improving  corporate \ngovernance  and  strengthening \ninstitutional  capacity  by  providing \nconsulting services, equipment, and training. \n \nUnderdeveloped  roads  and  transport  services  are  major  causes  of \npoverty in Guangxi. Rural poverty incidence is 30% in the project area, \nparticularly  in  the  border  area  with  Viet  Nam.  Existing  transport \ninfrastructure is currently being used to saturation levels, creating high \ntransport costs for producers and consumers. This transport bottleneck \nneeds  to  be  removed  to  facilitate  the  movement  of  goods  and  people \nbetween  rural  and  urban  areas  and  between  interior  and  coastal \nprovinces. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  an  important  national  transport  network  by \nbuilding  a  section  from  Baise  to  Longlin  (Guizhou  border)  of  the \nKunming  (Yunnan)\u2013Shantou  (Guangdong)  corridor,  one  of  the  high \npriority  east\u2013west  corridors  in  the  PRC.  It  will  connect  the  poor  and \nisolated  interior  provinces  (Guizhou,  Yunnan,  Sichuan)  and  the  city  of \nChongqing to the nearest seaports in Guangxi (Beihai, Fangcheng, and \nQinzhou) and Guangdong (Map 2). \n \nThe Project is one of the high priority projects identified by the Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Transport  Sector  Strategy,  which  was \nendorsed by the six GMS governments at the 11th meeting of the GMS \nTransport  Forum  in  Vientiane,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  in \n2006.  The  Project  will  provide  the  missing  link  in  the  Kunming\u2013\n\n \n\n\f \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan \n\nFinancing Plan  \n \n\nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\niv \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nNanning\u2013Hanoi section of the GMS economic corridor. The Project will \n(i) improve border roads and transport services for trade activities, and \n(ii) provide facilities and equipment to meet expected demand for freight \ntransshipment  and  storage  at  the  border  crossing  point  in  Pingxiang \n(international land port with Viet Nam). It will link Nanning and Kunming, \nthe two major growth centers in the western PRC to Hanoi (Viet Nam), \nsupporting  the  strategic  thrust  of  strengthening  connectivity  and \nfacilitating cross-border movement and tourism with Viet Nam (Map 1).  \n \nThe Project will contribute to pro-poor sustainable economic growth in \nwestern  Guangxi  and  northern  Viet  Nam.  This  will  be  achieved  by \ndeveloping  an  efficient,  safe,  and  environment-friendly  regional \ntransport  system  to  promote  trade  in,  and  through,  western  Guangxi \nand reduce trade barriers with Viet Nam. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $1,566  million \nequivalent.  Of  the  $300  million  ADB  loan,  $40.26  million  will  finance \nincluding  rural  roads  ($28.6  million), \nnonexpressway  components \ntownship  bus  stations  ($1.4  million),  border-trade  logistics  center \n($10 million), rural transport service demonstration project ($0.16 million), \nand a rural road maintenance study ($0.1 million). \n \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nChina Bank of Communications  \nMinistry of Communications \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional \nPeople\u2019s Government \n\nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n   Amount \n300.0 \n550.0 \n170.0 \n\n546.0 \n\n1,566.0 \n\n % \n19.0 \n35.0 \n11.0 \n\n35.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n \nA  loan  of  $300,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.35% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. \n \nThe  PRC  Government  will  make  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  available  to \nthe  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Regional  People\u2019s  Government \n(GRG), and further to the Guangxi Communications Department (GCD) \nwith the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan \nwith GCD bearing the exchange rate and interest rate variation risk. On \nimplementation  of  the  GCD  restructuring  plan,  and  incorporation  of \nGuangxi  Communications \nInvestment  and  Construction  Group \nCompany Limited (GCIG), GCD will onlend the loan proceeds to GCIG, \nwith  GCIG  then  bearing  the  exchange  rate  and  interest  rate  variation \nrisk. All relending and onlending under the Project will be on the same \nfinancial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 April 2013 \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \n \n31 October 2012 \n \nThe  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  established  within  GCD  will  be \nresponsible for overall implementation of the Project.  \n \nGuangxi Communications Department  \n \nGoods  and  works  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Contracts and mode of procurement envisaged under \nthe  Project  are  indicated  in  the  procurement  plan.  ADB  approved \nadvance  contracting  on  26 February  2007  and  retroactive  financing  for \neligible expenditures not exceeding $30 million on 4 April 2007.  \n \n\n(ii) \n\nrural \n\n \nConsulting Services  The ADB loan will finance 45 person-months of international consulting \nservices  for  supervising  construction;  providing  advice  on  structural \nengineering,  pavement,  road  safety,  road  transport  services,  and \ncorporate  governance;  and \nformulating  a  capacity  development \nprogram.  The  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nThe Project will also finance national consulting services for the (i)  rural \ntransport  services  demonstration  project,  and \nroad \nmaintenance policy reform study, each at an estimated cost of no more \nthan  $100,000.  The  required  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  In \naddition, GCD will engage and finance 7,700 person-months of national \nconsulting services. All national consultants, not financed by ADB, will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB. \n \nThe expressway forms part of the Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi section of \nthe  GMS  economic  corridor,  which  is  a  major  artery  for  the  regional \ntransport  network  connecting  with  national  and  regional  roads.  It  will \nhave a significant, positive impact on the economic development of the \nregion. \n \nThe expressway will reduce travel time by at least 3 hours and shorten \nthe  travel  distance  between  Baise  and  Longlin  by  34  km.  Improved \nlocal roads will link villages to the road network and border areas with \nViet Nam, and hence to the national and regional economy. Improved \nrural  transport  services  will  link  rural  households  with  the  wider \neconomy.  A  developed  and  efficient  transport  network  will  integrate \npoor  isolated  regions  with  the  centers  of  economic  growth.  The \neconomic internal rate of return for the Project is 17.5%. The financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  4.5%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real  weighted \naverage cost of capital. The Project will directly benefit about 2.3 million \npeople in Baise, of whom 87% live in rural areas and 30% of these live \non  less  than  $1  per  person  per  day.  The  Project  will  also  benefit \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n\f240 million  people  indirectly  in  the  southwestern  region  of  the  PRC. \nMore  broadly,  the  Project  will  benefit  the  three  poor  northeastern \nprovinces  in  Viet  Nam  adjacent  to  Guangxi  with  a  total  population  of \n2.3 million. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  road  users  (e.g.,  passengers,  traders, \ntransport providers, and bus and truck operators), as well as labor, the \nlocal  economy,  and  the  private  sector.  The  Project  will  help  reduce \ntraffic accidents, vehicle emissions, and traffic noise in the corridor. The \nProject  will  also  boost  tourism.  Rural  households  are  also  important \nbeneficiaries,  and  will  benefit  from  increased  incomes  through  better \naccess  to  roads,  transport  services,  markets,  off-farm  opportunities, \nand better access to trade services. The Project will create 18.6 million \nperson-days of local employment amounting to CNY318 million in wage \npayments  during  construction,  and  another  CNY20  million  of  wage \npayments  expected  to  go  to  the  local  communities  annually  after  start \nof  project  operation.  A  total  of  18,500  local  people  are  likely  to  gain \nemployment  and  skills  training  throughout  the  Project.  The  ability  and \nskills  of  local  communities  will  be  greatly  enhanced.  The  improved \nregional  transport  system  will  enhance  the  local  investment  climate  to \nattract  more  investment  to  the  region  and  act  as  a  catalyst  for  future \ninvestment.  \n \nThe  Project  is  formulated  to  reduce  technical,  economic,  financial, \nsafety,  and  social  risks.  The  main  technical  risks  are  associated  with \nthe  construction  of  tunnels  and  bridges.  Project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  consultants  have  reviewed  the  proposed  design  and \nconstruction methods and found them in order. During implementation, \nthe  bidding  system  will  focus  on  contractors\u2019  financial  and  technical \ncapabilities in handling similar complex works. Monitoring and contract \nmanagement  information  systems  will  be  set  up  to  quickly  identify \ntechnical  and  environmental  problems  and  correct \nthem.  The \ncontractors  will  be  required  to  strictly  enforce  work  safety  rules  and \nmeasures.  GCD  has  experience  and  has  performed  satisfactorily  in \ninternationally financed projects. \n \nThe  financial  risk  associated  with  construction  and  operation  of  the \nexpressway will depend on traffic volume, capital cost, and toll rates. To \nmitigate  the  financial  risks,  GCD  will  build  up  a  commercial  business \nenvironment  for  expressway  operations,  the  Project  will  receive \nsubstantial injections of equity from central and provincial governments, \nand a market-oriented toll structure will be adopted. The Project has no \nmajor environmental, resettlement, or HIV/AIDS infection risks; and has \nmitigation  and  monitoring  mechanisms  in  place.  GCD  demonstrated \nsignificant ownership in preparing the resettlement plan, environmental \nimpact assessment, and ethnic minorities development plan. \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nvi \n\n

recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Western Guangxi Roads Development Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  PRC  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction \nsince the late 1970s. However, its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is still modest, and \nabout  135  million  people  living  on  less  than  $1  day  consumption  line  (more  than  10%  of  the \nglobal poor).1 Moreover, the distribution of income is highly imbalanced between eastern coastal \nand  interior  provinces  and  between  urban  and  rural  areas.  Poverty  is  more  widespread  in  the \nwestern region. Infrastructure constraints and lack of access to consumer markets are the main \ncauses  of  the  region\u2019s  high  incidence  of  poverty.  Thus,  developing  economic  infrastructure  in \nkey  corridors,  including  seaport  links  and  trade  corridors  connecting  the  western  and  coastal \nregions, is essential to promote trade and reduce regional development disparities in the long run. \n \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) is one of the five autonomous regions  \n3. \n(equivalent to a province) in the PRC. Guangxi has highlands in the northwest and lowlands in \nthe southeast, and mountains on three sides. Since Guangxi is the only western province with a \ncoastline,  it  assumes  a  very  important  role  in  the  Western  Region  Development  Program. \nGuangxi borders Guangdong province in the east, Hunan and Guizhou provinces in the north, \nYunnan in the west, and Viet Nam in the south. Hence, it provides a strategic link between the \nresource-based economies in the western PRC and the trade-oriented economies in the eastern \nPRC. The proposed Project forms an integral part of the east\u2013west trade corridor connecting the \nsouthwest  hinterland  provinces  with  coastal  provinces.  Together,  the  five  provinces  (Guizhou, \nYunnan, Guangxi, Chongqing city,2 and Sichuan) have a population of about 240 million, about \n19% of the country\u2019s total. Support for developing the proposed corridor will extend the benefits \nof increased accessibility to the west region, where average incomes are the lowest in the PRC. \n \n4. \nLike  other  parts  of  the  PRC,  Guangxi\u2019s  economy  has  grown  rapidly.  Nevertheless, \nGuangxi still lags the coastal provinces and the country as a whole. With a per capita GDP of \nCNY8,788 in 2005 (63% of the national average), Guangxi ranks 27th of 31 administrative areas. \nGuangxi\u2019s  per  capita  GDP  is  only  about  one  third  of  Guangdong  province.  The  lack  of  an \nefficient and effective transport system is an important constraint for the sustainable growth of \nGuangxi. Although road density by area or by population is comparable to the national average, \nroad  density  by  area  (2.61  kilometers  [km]  per  1,000  square  km)  is  only  40%  of  Guangdong \nprovince;  and  class-II  and  above  roads  comprise  13%  of  all  roads,  or  half  of  Guangdong \nprovince. Guangxi has a 1,595 km coastline. Given its geographic location, transport corridors in \nGuangxi need to be developed into the western region and within Guangxi. \n \nDeveloping  markets  becomes  more  important  as  the  PRC  becomes  more  open \n5. \neconomically. The openness ratio, measured as the ratio of foreign trade to GDP, reached 60% \nin  2005  from  31%  in  1991.  Coastal  provinces benefit  from  much  greater  shares  of  investment \nand  foreign  trade  than  inland  provinces.  Guangdong  accounted  for  30%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  foreign \ntrade in 2005. The southwestern region, including Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Chongqing, and \n\n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 2006. China Country Partnership Strategy (2006\u20132010). Washington. \n2   One of four provincial-level municipalities in the PRC. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nSichuan, accounted for 0.10% to 0.56%. While the western region accounts for over 28% of the \ncountry\u2019s population, it accounts for only 3.2% of total foreign trade; it has yet to benefit from the \ntrade-led  growth.  Since  the  use  of  transport  infrastructure  is  essential  to  any  trade-oriented \neconomy, the western region needs to improve its infrastructure to attract investment to develop \nenterprises  that  take  advantage  of  abundant  raw  materials  and  relatively  low  labor  costs.  If \nwestern provinces are to have an important share of the country\u2019s total trade, access to these \nprovinces must improve, and constraints on the transport of trade overcome. \n \nMore  than  90%  of  the  poor  in  the  PRC  live  in  rural  areas.  Roads  usually  are  the  only \n6. \nmode of transport that can help the poor reach markets and services. Recognizing the role of \nrural  roads  in  reducing  poverty,  the  Government  has  accelerated  rural  road  improvement  to \nclose the development gap between urban and rural areas.3 During the 10th Five-Year Program \n(FYP)  2001\u20132005,  investment  in  rural  roads  totaled  CNY418  billion,  three  times  that  in  the \nprevious 5 years. By 2010, all villages will have road access, and all townships will have paved \nroads.  Paved  roads  will  link  all  eastern  villages,  88%  of  central  villages,  and  50%  of  western \nvillages. To achieve this, the indicative plan prepared by the Ministry of Communications (MOC), \nenvisages  investment  in  rural  roads  to  reach  about  CNY800 billion  (about  $100 billion)  from \n2006  to  2010.  Of  this,  MOC  will  provide  CNY140 billion,  representing  17.5%  of  the  total \ninvestment; the provinces and domestic and foreign loans will finance the remainder. \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n \nDespite  rapid  economic  growth,  the  PRC  has  suffered  from  imbalanced  growth  among \n7. \nthe  provinces.  In  2005,  the  GDP  per  capita  of  the  western  provinces  was  about  half  of  the \nnational average and only one third of that in the eastern coastal region. The road network still \ndoes  not  provide  adequate  access  to  the  poorer  inland  region;  vast  distances  and  difficult \nmountainous  terrain  isolate  it  from  local,  regional,  and  national  markets.  Most  exports  and \nimports  reach  major  markets  through  other  provinces,  meaning  that  regional  transport \ndevelopment is an important determinant of growth and development. \n \nGuangxi  has  made  significant  progress  in  poverty  reduction  since  1990s  as  a  result  of \n8. \neconomic  growth  and  concentrated  development  efforts.  Nevertheless,  it  remains  one  of  the \nmost  underdeveloped  regions  in  the  PRC.  Currently,  Guangxi  has  28  national  designated \npoverty  counties,  accounting  for  4.7%  of  total  national  poverty  counties  in  the  PRC.  The \n28 counties  have  4,060 identified  poverty  stricken  villages  with  an  average  net  per  capita \nincome  of  CNY1,586.  These  villages  account  for  28.4%  of  the  total  administrative  villages  in \nGuangxi. Twenty-one additional counties are provincial designated poverty counties. Almost all \nborder counties in Guangxi are poverty counties and among the poorest poverty counties in the \nPRC.  Three  provinces  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  northeast  region  are  adjacent  to  Guangxi:  Quang  Ninh, \nLang  Son,  and  Cao  Bang,  with  a  population  of  2.3  million  in  2005,  2.8  %  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  total. \nThey are the poorest in Viet Nam (Map 2). Improvement of border roads in border counties will \nstimulate cross-border trade and consequent employment opportunities for the poor living along \nthe border area with Viet Nam. The problem and constraints analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n9. \nInadequate  infrastructure  is  the  main  reason  for  the  project  area\u2019s  high  incidence  of \npoverty. The project area includes one district and seven counties in Baise,4 of which seven are \n\n                                                 \n3   In 2005, the annual per capita net income of rural households was CNY3,255 ($402), while the annual per capita \ndisposable income of urban households was CNY10,493 ($1,306), three times more than that of rural households. \n\n4   Baise is a prefecture-level city that includes an urban district, 11 counties, and one autonomous county. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nnational  designated  poverty  counties  (Map  3). 5 About  30%  of  rural  residents  are  poor  and \npoverty incidence exceeds 40% in four counties. Furthermore, due to mountainous terrain, most \nof  the  rural  population  is  scattered  in  13,710  sub-villages  that  lack  basic  infrastructure, \nespecially roads. In Baise, 592 administrative villages are not served by an all-weather road and \n3,844 natural  villages  have  no  road  access.  Without  the  minimum  of  accessibility,  they  are \nunable  to  integrate  into  the  market  economy,  their  income  level  will  remain  low,  and  their \neconomic  growth  will  not  be  achievable  or  sustainable.  The  counties  with  the  greatest \naccessibility  problems  also  have  limited  financial  resources,  and  therefore  need  the  most \nsupport for rural road development from national and provincial governments as well as ADB. \n \n10. \nBetween  1995  and  2005,  road  freight  in  Guangxi  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of \n6.1%  and  passenger  traffic  grew  by  9.3%.  The  increased  traffic  is  reflected  in  main  corridors, \nincluding national highway (NH) 324. NH324, which runs parallel to the project expressway, is \nmainly  class-III  roads  with  insufficient  shoulders,  very  poor  alignment,  and  limited  capacity. \nBetween  1995  and  2005,  NH324  traffic  increased  by  an  average  12.7%  per  annum.  The \naverage travel speed is about 40 km per hour. Traffic congestion is growing and will exceed the \nroad\u2019s  capacity  by  2012;  several  sections  are  already  approaching  their  capacity.  The  road  is \ndangerous  as  it  has  many  side  frictions  due  to  the  high  incidence  of  slow-moving  traffic  and \nsubstantial ribbon development on most of its length. When completed, the project expressway \nwill  help  to  ease  severe  congestion  and  traffic  accidents,  and  improve  traffic-induced  air \npollution in the project corridor. \n \n11. \nPoor  roads  have  also  led  to  inadequate  and  costly  transport  services.  In  Baise, \n580 administrative villages and 3,564 natural villages have no direct access to formal licensed \nbus services as bus operators are unwilling to use bad roads because of high costs and danger. \nTransport  demand  is  usually  met  by  various  informal  transport  services  such  as  motorized \ntricycles,  dual-purpose  pickups,  and  agricultural  tractors.  During  the  10th  FYP,  Guangxi \nCommunications Department (GCD) formulated plans to provide organized bus services to rural \nareas. In general, formal bus services are of better quality, but suffer from low rates of vehicle \nutilization because of poor roads, low demand, inefficient scheduling of vehicles, and rigid bus \nroute licensing system. This results in relatively high unit costs. The project preparation survey \nindicates  that  40%\u201360%  of  households  are  not  satisfied with  the  quality  of  services  in  Longlin \nand Xinlin counties. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\n \nThe  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP,  2006\u20132010,  focuses  on  balanced,  equitable,  and \n12. \nsustainable  development,  with  a  strong  emphasis  on  rural  and  western  region  development. \nThe  Government  pledges  to  increase  farmers\u2019  incomes,  improve  infrastructure,  and  enhance \npublic services in the countryside. Road development is a high priority as an effective means of \npromoting  economic  growth  and  reducing  poverty.  To  reduce  regional  disparities,  the \nGovernment aims to link the western region with central and eastern regions, provide western \nregion  access  to  trade  outlets  at  sea  and  land  ports,  and  promote  regional  cooperation  with \nneighboring countries. \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  PRC  road  sector  gives  high  priority  to  removing  infrastructure \nconstraints and supporting policy and institutional reforms. ADB supports (i) building roads that \nconnect  major  growth  centers,  and  improving  access  in  the  western  and  central  regions; \n(ii) integrating the network so that the national trunk highway system is supported by a system \n\n                                                 \n5   The  project  area  is  defined  as  Youjiang  district,  Longlin  and  Tianlin  counties  on  the  line  of  the  expressway,  and \n\nXilin, Leye, Linguyn, Tianyang, Jiangxi counties on the line of the local roads, all in Baise (Map 3). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\nof  local  roads,  particularly  those  that  provide  access  to  poor  areas;  (iii) promoting  road  safety \nand  reducing  vehicle  emissions;  (iv)  strengthening  corporatization  and  commercialization  of \nexpressway  organizations;  (v)  adopting  appropriate  pricing  policies  to  ensure  optimum  use  of \nroad  transport  capacity;  and  (vi)  using  alternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including \nprivate  sector  participation.  ADB  assistance  for  roads  targets  the  poor  western  provinces  and \nregional  economic  corridors.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  development  priorities \nand  ADB\u2019s  strategy.  The  road  sector  policy  reform  matrix  is  in  Appendix  3  and  road  sector \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \n \n14. \nThe expressway from Baise to Longlin (border with Guizhou) is an important section of \nthe  Kunming  (Yunnan)  to  Shantou  (Guangdong)  national  high-priority  east\u2013west  corridor.  The \nproject  expressway  also  forms  part  of  the  Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi  section  of  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) economic corridor (Map 1).6 This road corridor not only supports the \nGMS Economic Cooperation Program, but also the Two Corridors-One Ring7 initiative between \nthe  governments  of  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam,  which  started  in  July  2005.  Opening  up  the \ntransport  corridor  will  strengthen  connectivity  and  facilitate  cross-border  movement  of  goods \nand tourism, thereby promoting economic growth and reducing regional disparities.8  \n \nCross-border  economic  cooperation  is  especially  important  for  the  poor  regions  in \n15. \nGuangxi and Viet Nam as many are border areas. The value of cross-border trade amounted to \n$1,049 million (exports $386 million and imports $663 million) in 2006. About 85% of the exports \nand  77%  of  the  imports  are  traded  by  private  enterprises  and  individuals.  The  area  has \n11 crossing  points  (four  class-I  land  ports  and  seven  class-II  land  ports)  and  28 small  border \ntrade markets along Guangxi\u2019s 637 km border with Viet Nam. The four class-I ports\u2014Dongxing, \nPingxiang, Shuikou, and Longbang\u2014are by far the most important. While cross-border trade is \nminor  in  the  overall  context  of  the  PRC,  the  existence  of  a  border  port  is  crucial  to  local \ncommunities for both Guangxi and Viet Nam, and future regional border trade. The Project will \nupgrade  rural  roads  and  build  township  bus  stations  to  improve  the  access  of  Jingxi  (border \ncounty)  to  its  nearest  crossing  point  at  Longbang  (national  class-I  land  port),  Yuexu  (class-II \nland port) and small-scale trade markets. \n \n16. \nEighty  percent  of  Guangxi\u2019s  population  of  49  million  is  rural.  The  climate  is  subtropical \nmonsoon. Although agriculture features strongly in the economy, primary industry is decreasing \nas a proportion of GDP. In 2000, primary industry accounted for 26% of Guangxi\u2019s GDP but by \n2005, this had fallen to 22%. Secondary industry accounted for 37% of GDP in 2005, the same \nas in 2000. Tertiary industry is leading growth in GDP, accounting for 41% in 2005 as compared \nwith  only  37%  in  2000.  The  orientation  of  Guangxi\u2019s  economic  structure  is  conducive  to  the \ngeneration  of  major  trade  flows.  Improved  transport  infrastructure  will  improve  the  investment \nclimate,  increase  the  production  and  export  of  mineral  products,  reduce  the  transport  cost  for \ncash crops, and promote tourism. \n \n17. \nExternal assistance to the PRC road sector has come mainly from ADB, Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation,  and  World  Bank.  Since  1991,  ADB  has  extended  34 loans  totaling \n\n                                                 \n6  The GMS comprises Cambodia, Guangxi, and Yunnan of the PRC, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  With  ADB  assistance,  the  six  member  countries  launched  the  GMS  Program  in  1992. \nGuangxi joined the GMS Program in 2004. \n\n7  Two  corridors  represent  Nanning\u2013Hanoi  (Viet  Nam)  and  Kunming\u2013Hanoi  corridors.  One  Ring  means  Economic \n\nBelt around Beibu Gulf (Gulf of Tonkin).   \n\n8  The GMS Program does not include Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, and the city of Chongqing, which are likely to have \nsignificant trading relationships with GMS countries including Viet Nam. They will benefit from the project corridor. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\n$6.9 billion to finance 4,589 km of expressways and 9,321 km of associated local road networks. \nProject  completion  reports  prepared  for  18  road  projects  conclude  that  17 were  highly  or \ngenerally  successful  and  1  partly  successful.9 ADB  has  also  supplied  62 technical  assistance \n(TA) projects totaling $34 million to the road sector. The advisory TA projects have addressed \npolicy  and  institutional  issues,  including  highway  planning,  road  safety,  socioeconomic \nassessment,  transport  pricing,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial  resources.  The \nWorld Bank has provided about $7.1 billion and Japan Bank for International Cooperation about \n\u00a5219  billion  to  finance  road  investments  (Appendix  4).  ADB  coordinates  with  both  these \norganizations to ensure that each major development partner focuses on different corridors, and \ninformation related to policy advice is shared across the development community. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons \n\n \nThe  evaluation  of  ADB  assistance  for  roads  and  railways  in  the  PRC10 concludes  that \n18. \n(i) ADB\u2019s program for roads was successful overall, and (ii) ADB has potential to formulate new \nfocus  and  priorities  to  continue  playing  a  significant  role  in  the  road  sector.  The  evaluation \nrecommends  that  transport  services  is  a  useful  area  for  ADB  support  since  transport  service \nefficiency is an important factor in determining the benefits of transport improvements to users, \nparticularly the poor. A proactive approach is being taken in this area. Guangxi was selected as \none of the case study provinces in the ADB TA Sustainable Rural Transport Service.11 The TA \nreviewed the current issues in the provision of rural road transport services and recommended a \nnumber of reforms to help establish more demand-responsive services between townships and \nnearby  villages.  The  proposed  reforms  of  rural  transport  services  will  be  demonstrated  and \ntested by a pilot demonstration project (estimated to cost $160,000 and to be financed by ADB) \nin Baise to ensure that the reforms are workable before introducing the reforms throughout the \ncountry. \n \n19. \nGCD has successfully implemented four externally financed road projects without major \nproblems.12 While  the  overall  performance  of  road  projects  is  satisfactory,  several  identified \nissues are reflected in the design of the proposed Project and are discussed in paras. 20\u201322. \n \n20. \nPlanning  and  design  of  interchanges,  and  administrative  and  service  facilities  merit \nrigorous examination and review before contracts are awarded.13 To ensure good quality at the \ndesign stage, (i) the preliminary designs were started early and reviewed carefully by national \nand provincial road engineers; (ii) site investigation was more comprehensive at the preliminary \ndesign stage; and (iii) close site supervision of international and national supervising consultants \nwill be undertaken to ensure quality and timely scheduling and completion of work. \n \n\n                                                 \n9  The partly successful rating is mainly due to inadequate safety facilities and enforcement. Remedial actions were \ntaken  to  rectify  the  issues.  The  Project  was  rated  as  satisfactory  in  the  project  performance  audit  report  after \nremedial measures were taken. \n\n10  ADB.  2007.

Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Service. \n\n12  The Fangcheng Port Project (includes a 48 km highway), Guangxi Roads Development Project (approved in 2001), \nand  Guangxi  Roads  Development  II  Project  (approved  in  2004)  financed  by  ADB,  and  the  Guangxi  Highway \nProject financed by the World Bank (main highway opened to traffic in September 2004). \n\n13  Under the 2001 Guangxi Roads Development Project, one toll plaza  was found to be incorrectly located and the \ndesign  of  the  non-ADB  financed  portion  was  inconsistent  with  traffic  demand.  The  additional  works  required  to \nrectify the noted deficiencies resulted in additional cost and prolonged project implementation. It also contributed to \nthe lower than expected traffic on the expressway (opened to traffic in December 2005). \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nTraffic  demand  forecasts  for  expressways  in  Guangxi  need  to  be  improved.  The  lower \n21. \ntraffic volume on the Guangxi Roads Development Project (Guangxi I)14 during the first year of \noperation was due to overoptimistic estimates of future GDP growth in the counties traversed by \nthe  expressway15 and  slower  than  expected  implementation  of  agreements  related  to  border \ntrade with Viet Nam. For the proposed Project, this should not be a problem as the majority of \ntraffic is established, long-distance, through traffic. Given the completion of the contiguous ADB-\nfinanced  Guangxi  Roads  Development  II  Project  (Guangxi  II)  expressway  from  Nanning  to \nBaise  by  2008,16 the  diversion  to  the  project  expressway  from  the  existing  NH324  for  long \ndistance  traffic  is  expected  to  be  immediate.  However,  the  forecast  traffic  volumes  on  the \nexpressway  have  conservatively  assumed  a  ramp  up17 in  traffic  diversion  volumes  in  the  first \nfew years of operation. \n \nInstitutional  and  corporatization  plans  need  to  be  closely  aligned  with  that  of  the \n22. \ngovernment, in terms of capacity and time frames. In the past, difficulties were experienced in \nimplementing  the  corporatization  agenda  for  Guangxi  I  due  to  inadequate  regional  readiness. \nEventually in 2005, Guangxi Southwest Expressway Company Limited (SWEC) was formed to \noperate  roads  constructed  under  Guangxi  I  and  II.  GCD  has  also  realized  that  instead  of \nadopting  a  piecemeal  approach  to  corporatization,  a  more  efficient  approach  is  to  consolidate \nnot  only  operation,  but  also  construction  of  the  expressways  in  Guangxi  under  a  single \ncorporate entity, which can then access financial markets for raising additional capital. GCD has \ninitiated a restructuring plan (para. 23). Given the progress achieved, the private sector is also \nshowing interest in GCD\u2019s restructuring agenda. The Project, therefore, works within Guangxi\u2019s \nown corporatization plans, and streamlines the direction and process. \n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nPioneering \n\n \n23. \nInstitutional  Arrangements.  Within  GCD,  Guangxi  Communications \nInfrastructure  Administration  Bureau  (GIAB)  constructs  expressways  in  Guangxi,  and  Guangxi \nExpressway  Administration  Bureau  (GEAB)  provides  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Prior \nADB-financed projects led to the creation of SWEC in 2005. SWEC is responsible for operation \nof  roads  under  both  Guangxi  I  and  Guangxi  II  projects.  The  dialogue  on  institutional \narrangements with GCD during project preparation helped raise awareness of the importance of \ndeveloping an integrated corporatization approach. GCD has now constituted a working group \nto  develop  a  restructuring  plan  to  establish  Guangxi  Communications  Investment  and \nConstruction Group Company Limited (GCIG). GCIG will be structured to consolidate both GIAB \nand  GEAB,  either  as  operating  divisions  or  subsidiaries.  GCIG  will  also  take  over  SWEC \noperations  of,  and  thereby  assume  complete  responsibility  for  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance  of  the  project  expressway  and  other  expressways  in  Guangxi.  GCD  agreed  to \ncomplete its analysis and prepare a restructuring plan for consolidation of relevant expressway \noperations  of  GIAB,  GEAB,  and  SWEC  in  GCIG  by  31  October  2007.  GCD  will  implement  its \nrestructuring plan, and incorporate and commercialize GCIG by 30 June 2008. The integrated \napproach will help to build a strong GCIG to effectively build, manage, and utilize assets; and \nprovide  efficient  services  for  road  users.  An  institutional  road  map  and  action  plan  for  GCIG \nagreed with GCD is set out in Appendix 5. \n \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB.  2001.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Guangxi Roads Development II Project. Manila. \n\n17  Ramp-up is the propensity for some traffic not to immediately transfer from the existing road to the expressway as \n\nits benefits are not immediately known to all who would benefit from diversion. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nfrom \n\nthe  existing  government  bureaus \n\nPromoting  Corporate  Governance.  Consolidation  of  construction  and  operation  of \n24. \nexpressways \ninto  a  separate  corporate  entity \nincorporated under the new Company Law of the PRC (effective 1 January 2006) is a first step \nin promoting corporate governance. The new Company Law includes provisions for disclosure \nof  interest  by  directors,  representation  of  employees  on  the  board  of  directors,  external  audit, \nand constitution of a board of supervisors to have general oversight over the board of directors. \nA corporate development plan will be developed by 31 March 2008 to set additional standards \nfor corporate governance, management, financial reporting, and human resource development \nin GCIG. A comprehensive institutional development and training program will be implemented \nin close coordination with various divisions in GCD. Additionally, GCD and GCIG will enter into \nconcession agreement/s to ensure that GCIG has autonomy in construction and operation of the \nhighways;  and  assumes  responsibility  for  meeting  all  agreed  financial,  engineering,  technical, \nenvironmental, and O&M standards. \n \n25. \nFacilitating  Private  Sector  Participation  (PSP).  In  the  PRC,  the  private  sector  has \nbeen  involved  in  the  road  sector  through  cooperative  joint  ventures,  build-operate-transfer \nprojects,  and  other  forms  of  securitization.  In  Guangxi,  PSP  has  mostly  been  used  for \nexpressways connecting larger cities, e.g., the transfer of operation rights of part of the Guilin\u2013\nLiuzhou expressway to a joint venture between GCD and a Hong Kong investment bank. GCD's \n11th FYP aims at introducing more PSP. GCD will explore various options with potential private \ninvestors  in  close  consultation  with  ADB  to  ensure  that  project  implementation  progresses \nsmoothly.  In  addition,  6  months  prior  to  the  opening  of  the  project  expressway,  GCIG  will \nanalyze  the  feasibility  of  tapping  financial  markets  for  future  road  sector  investments,  and \npossible PSP in O&M of the project expressway. Therefore, establishment of GCIG will facilitate \nPSP in the road sector in Guangxi on a strategic basis. \n \n26. \nImproving Rural Transport Services. Despite good progress in providing rural transport \nservices  connecting  townships  with  counties,  some  villages  still  do  not  have  roads  and  bus \nservices. In the project area, passenger bus productivity (the average daily kilometers driven per \npassenger bus) is very low (30 km/day on average for small buses). This reflects low demand, \npoor roads, inefficient scheduling of vehicles, and inability to rotate buses onto other routes. Unit \ncosts  are  consequently  high.  Therefore,  the  first  priority  will  be  to  increase  passenger  bus \nproductivity. A system of regional licenses that eases the requirement that buses and drivers be \nrestricted  to  fixed  routes  will  result  in  increasing  productivity  and  lower  unit  costs.  Under  the \nProject, GCD agreed to implement bus route licensing reforms between townships and nearby \nvillages  in  Baise.  Implementing  the  reforms  will  allow  operators  flexibility  in  customizing  their \nroutes, schedules, and services in line with passenger needs, and use their vehicles and drivers \nmore  efficiently.  Ultimately  these  lower  costs  should  enable  lower  fares  in  terms  of  quality  of \nservice provided. The proposed reforms will be tested by a rural transport reform demonstration \nproject. Experience from the demonstration project will be replicated in other areas. Appendix 6 \nprovides a discussion of rural transport services and policy reform in Guangxi. \n \n27. \nEnhancing Road Safety. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC including Guangxi. \nThe Project will address road safety by (i) focusing on black-spot analysis and treatments, and \nenhancing  road  signage  along  the  project  local  roads;  and  (ii) enforcing  stringent  controls  on \nspeeding  and  vehicle  overloading,  and  (iii)  conducting  road  safety  audit.  Traffic  police  in  the \nregion  will  enforce  traffic  laws  including  stringent  speed  management,  enhancing  vehicle \ninspection and driver license systems, deterring unacceptable road-user behavior, and providing \ntargeting \n24-hour  hotline  service.  The  police  also  will  conduct  education  campaigns \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\ncommunities  through  lectures  and  publicity  materials  developed  under  the  ADB  Road  Safety \nImprovement TA (Appendix 7).18 \n \n28. \nIntroducing  Weight-Based  Tolls. To control overloaded vehicles, GCD will implement \nweight-based  tolling  for  all  expressways  and  parallel  toll  highways  by  the  end  of  2007.  The \nprinciple  behind  weight-based  tolling  is  that  goods-carrying  vehicles  pay  a  rate  per  ton-km \nbased on the weight class of the vehicle plus a penalty rate per excess tonnage. Experiences \ngained  in  other  provinces  show  that  this  is  an  effective  way  to  manage  overloaded  vehicles  if \ncomplemented with effective control measures. For example, after introducing the weight-based \ntolls, overloaded vehicles were reduced from 40% to 17% in Shandong province, and from 65% \nto 13% in Anhui province (Appendix 7). \n \nControlling  Vehicle  Emissions.  The  Government  has  taken  several  steps  to  control \n29. \nemissions:  imposing  regulations  on  the  automobile  industry,  requiring  an  annual  vehicle  test, \nand  improving  the  vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  program.  The  new  measures  also  set \nemission  and  fuel  efficiency  targets,  and  offer  tax  incentives  for  manufacturers  of  more \nenvironment-friendly cars. Guangxi follows national vehicle emission control strategies including \nenforcing national emission standards for new vehicles, improvement of conventional fuels and \nalternative  or  cleaner  fuels,  vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  programs,  and  retirement  of \nobsolete polluting vehicles. The strategic vehicle emission reduction plan is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n6. \n\nRationale for ADB Support \n\n \n30. \nConstraints and Opportunities. Rural poverty incidence is very high in the project area \n(Map 3). Roads and transport services are underdeveloped, which is a major cause of poverty. \nExisting  transport  infrastructure  is  currently  being  used  to  saturation  levels,  creating  high \ntransport costs for producers and consumers. This transport bottleneck needs to be removed to \nfacilitate  moving  goods  and  people  between  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  between  interior  and \ncoastal provinces. At the national level, the Project will connect interior provinces, now poor and \nisolated, to the nearest seaports in Guangxi and Guangdong. At the regional level, the Project is \none of the high priority projects identified under the GMS Transport Sector Strategy,19 endorsed \nby the six GMS governments at the 11th meeting of the GMS Transport Forum in Vientiane, Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic in March 2006. It is also included in the Strategy for the Closer \nIntegration  of  Guangxi  into  the  GMS,  and  GMS  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program \nUpdate (2007\u20132009).20 The Project will provide the missing link in the Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi \ntransport corridor, which will support the GMS strategic thrust for strengthening connectivity and \nfacilitating cross-border trade and tourism with Viet Nam (Map 1). \n  \n31. \nProject  Alternatives  Considered.  Considering  the  existing  and  future  socioeconomic \nconditions in the western region of the PRC, trade, economic development, poverty, volume and \ncomposition  of  traffic  on  the  corridor,  and  capacity  of  the  existing  transport  infrastructure,  the \nproposed  alignment  was  selected  as  the  most  cost-effective  and  appropriate  way  to  improve \ntransport.  The  alternative  of  improving  existing  roads  was  investigated  and  rejected  as  being \nneither  technically  viable  nor  cost-effective  in  the  long  run.  Also,  technical  alternatives  to \nconstruct class-I or class-II highways were discussed and rejected. Four alternative expressway \nalignments  were  also  studied.  The  proposed  alignment  has  obvious  advantages  and  was \ntherefore  selected.  Appendix  9  summarizes  the  project  alternatives  considered.  Local  roads \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Road Safety Improvement. Manila. \n19  ADB. 2007.

In  addition  to  financing,  ADB\u2019s  involvement  will  contribute  to \n(i) integrated  corporate  development  strategy  and  sound  corporate  governance  for  the  project \nexpressway, (ii) continued strengthening of road management practices, and (iii) management \nof sector externalities (safety, environment, and social dimensions). ADB also contributed to the \nintegrated design of the Project by working closely with GCD on the selection of local roads that \nwill link into the national high-priority corridor and poor minority villages. Upgrading of the project \nborder  road  will  be  linked  with  measures  to  promote  cross-border  trade,  which  will  improve \naccess for rural communities and small-scale traders in a much more cohesive way to provide \nan  integrated  transport  solution  to  transport  needs.  Most  importantly,  ADB\u2019s  involvement \naccelerates  institutional  and  policy  reforms  to  improve  corporate  governance,  road  transport \nservices, and road maintenance practices. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n33. \nThe Project will contribute to pro-poor sustainable economic growth in western Guangxi \nand northern Viet Nam. This will be achieved by developing an efficient, safe, and environment-\nfriendly  regional  transport  system  to  promote  trade  in,  and  through,  western  Guangxi  and \nreduce trade barriers with Viet Nam. \n \nB. \n \n34. \n \n\nThe project outputs will be derived from the following components: \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nComponent  A.  (a)  Construction  of  177  km,  access-controlled  toll  expressway \nfrom  Baise  to  Longlin  (Guizhou  border);  and  (b)  installation  of  facilities  and \nequipment at the Wantong Logistics Center at Pingxiang, on the main Nanning\u2013\nHanoi corridor. \nComponent  B.  Upgrading  of  1,060  km  of  local  roads  in  Baise  comprising \n(a) 3 priority border road sections totaling 50 km, (b) 3 priority rural road sections \ntotaling 260 km, and (c) village access roads totaling 750 km. \nComponent  C. (a) Construction of 2 border area bus stations at Longbang and \nYuexu,  and  48  township  bus  stations  in  Baise,  and  (b)  implementation  of  the \npassenger bus route licensing reform in Baise. \nComponent D. Implement rural road maintenance policy reform in Baise. \nComponent  E.  Improve  corporate  governance  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity by providing consulting services, equipment, and training. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \nC. \n \nBorder-Road Improvement for Trade Activities. This includes upgrading three border-\n35. \nroad  sections  totaling  50  km:  (i)  the  Jingxi\u2013Longbang  road  is  an  important  link  integrating  the \ntransport system and the planned development of the land ports in Longbang and Yuexu; and \n(ii)  two  border  access  roads,  one  accessing  a  border  livestock  market  and  a  planned  border \n\u201ctrading  street,\u201d  and  the  other  providing  improved  access  to  a  new  border  facility  and  freight \nstation. The improvements will facilitate access to border ports to stimulate border trade, create \nemployment  opportunities,  and  increase  regional  cooperation  with  Viet  Nam.  The  border  road \nupgrading  will  serve  strategic  border  development  projects  that  are  expected  to  result  in  a \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nsignificant increase in trade and traffic. By lowering transport costs and improving the transport \nlinks to the Viet Nam border at Pingxiang, Longbang, and Yuexu, the Project will spur economic \nactivity  and  interregional  and  international  trade,  helping  reduce  poverty  over  a  wide  region, \nincluding on both sides of the border. The ADB loan will provide $13.2 million to finance border-\nroad improvements for trade activities (Appendixes 10 and 11). \n \n36. \nRural  Road  Improvement  for  Network  Integration.  This  comprises  three  rural  road \nsections  totaling  260  km  linking  to  expressway  interchanges  and  thereby  integrating  the \nexpressway to the local road network and rural areas. It will help spread the benefits to the poor \nand minorities, who are mainly farmers and dependent on local road networks to reach markets. \nBetter  connections  between  the  expressway  and  rural  roads  will  enable  more  agricultural \nproducts  to  reach  markets  and  allow  farmers  to  upgrade  their  farming  practices.  As  reliable \ntransport  to  markets  becomes  more  readily  available,  cash  crop  farming  in  remote  or  isolated \nareas  will  be  stimulated  and  access  to  off-farm  employment  opportunities  will  be  broadened. \nFresh  and  high-value-to-weight  agriculture  products  will  be  made  profitable  to  market  due  to \nlower transport cost. The ADB loan will provide $12.4 million to finance rural road improvement \nfor network integration (Appendix 10). \n \n37. \nVillage Road Improvement for Poverty Reduction. The primary objective of the village \nroad  improvement  is  poverty  reduction.  Under  the  recently  completed  World  Bank  financed \nSouthwest  Poverty  Reduction  Project,  Guangxi  Poverty  Alleviation  and  Development  Office \n(GPAO) learned that (i) improving rural infrastructure was a powerful and fast-acting measure to \nimprove  well-being  and  poverty,  and  (ii)  utilizing  an  integrated  approach  is  very  effective  for \naddressing severe poverty. A major innovation, led by GPAO under the World Bank project, was \nsupport for village access roads. The improved access roads had important synergistic effects \non other project activities (for example, with road access, schools and heath clinic construction \nwas made much easier and materials such as chemical fertilizer for agricultural activities were \nmore  easily  transported  to  the  area).  The  project  preparatory  interviews  observed  that  poor \nhouseholds  were  extremely  supportive  of  projects  implemented  by  GPAO.  Working  in \ncollaboration with GPAO, the Project will provide $3 million to rehabilitate 750 km of 4,000 km of \nrural  roads  in  the  project  area  following  the  village  roads  implementation  framework  (VRIF) \nagreed  upon  with  GCD.  The  VRIF,  as  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B,  integrates  a \nresettlement  framework;  environmental  framework;  and  technical,  procurement,  and  financial \nmanagement framework.  \n \n38. \nRural  Transport  Services.  To  improve  the  availability,  efficiency,  and  affordability  of \nrural passenger services, the Project includes a component to help GCD achieve the 11th FYP \nstrategy  of  improving  the  accessibility  of  isolated  rural  and  border  communities.  It  will \n(i) construct  48  class-V  township  bus  stations  in  Baise  and  two  class-III  border  stations  at \nLongbang  and  Yuexu;  and  (ii) implement  passenger  bus  route  licensing  reforms  to  allow \noperators the flexibility to customize their routes, schedules, and services to increase demand, \nraise productivity, lower costs, and more closely meet the needs of rural communities. The ADB \nloan will provide $1.56 million to finance the rural transport services component. Together with an \nexisting rural bus services tax deduction scheme,21 these will help expand the network of formal \nbus services and spread the benefits of improved accessibility that will be brought about by the \nProject\u2019s expressway and local road components (Appendix 6). \n \n\n                                                 \n21  It  applies  only  to  buses  with  at  least  20%  of  their  route  on  roads  of  class  IV  or  lower.  They  receive  a  30%\u201350% \nreduction (depending on vehicle size and the proportion of the route on rural roads) in the road maintenance fee, \npassenger surcharge, transport management fee, and flood control and security fee; and a 50% reduction in city \nconstruction tax, transport facilities maintenance fee, and vehicle safety inspection fee. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nEnergy Efficiency and Reduced Vehicle Emissions. By July 2010, before the project \n39. \nroad opens, Guangxi is expected to have adopted stricter emission standards for both new and \nused vehicles. The Project will significantly contribute to control of vehicle emissions because it \noffers  better  road  roughness  value,  lower  congestion,  and more  efficient  operation.  In  the  first \nyear  of  the  expressway  operation,  fuel  savings  are  expected  to  be  more  than  11,000  tons  oil \nequivalent,  or  25%  lower  than  without  the  Project.  This  will  result  in  the  reduction  of  pollutant \nemissions  of  39,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  5,100 tons  of  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  and \n1,200  tons  of  hydrocarbon  in  2012.  The  direct  benefit  of  the  increased  capacity  on  the  new \nexpressway  and  the  improved  traffic  flow  on  NH324  will  result  in  a  total  reduction  of  CO2  by \n4.7 million ton over the 20-year forecast period. Guangxi Environmental Protection Bureau will \nmonitor emissions on project roads (Appendix 8). \n \nRegional  Cooperation.  Discussions  are  under  way  between  the  governments  of  the \n40. \nPRC  and  Viet  Nam  to  expand  the  existing  bilateral  road  transport  agreement  on  exchange  of \ntraffic  rights  along  the  Nanning\u2013Hanoi  corridor.  This  corridor  is  part  of  the  GMS  transport \ncorridors  identified  under  the  GMS  Transport  Sector  Strategy  (Supplementary  Appendix C). \nAgreement  on  this  is  expected  by  31  December  2007.  To  meet  expected  demand  for  freight \ntransshipment  and  storage,  the  Project  will  provide  facilities  and  equipment  at  the  Wantong \nLogistics  Center  at  Pingxiang  on  the  main  Nanning\u2013Hanoi  corridor.  Based  on  the  user  need \nsurveys, a list of trade logistics facilities and equipment was selected and agreed with GCD, of \nwhich ADB will finance $10 million to help reduce transshipment costs and delays to multimodal \ntransport flows in Pingxiang. In addition, the project expressway will improve regional linkages \nfor long-distance traffic; the project border roads will substantially reduce travel times and costs \nfor  road  freight  and  passengers;  and  the  passenger  bus  stations  and  bus  route  licensing \nreforms  will  improve  the  availability,  efficiency,  and  quality  of  road  passenger  services \n(Appendix 11). \n \n41. \nRural Road Maintenance. Adequate maintenance is crucial to ensure the sustainability \nof  rural  roads.  Building  on  the  new  national  policy  for  funding  and  managing  rural  road \nmaintenance  announced  by  the  State  Council  in  2005,  GCD\u2019s  2006  rural  road  maintenance \npolicy reform is to be introduced in three trial cities. GCD will also implement the reform in Baise. \nImplementation  of  the  policy  reform  will  help  ensure  improved  funding,  a  systematic  and \npreventive approach, and more local privatization. The Project will help increase attention to the \nneeds  of  rural  road  maintenance  by  local  government  officials,  and  increase  skills  needed  by \nlocal road authorities and communities to carry out road maintenance. GCD agreed to conduct a \nstudy  on  rural  road  maintenance  estimated  at  $100,000  to  be  financed  by  the  loan \n(Appendix 12). \n \n42. \nEnvironmental  Institutional  Capacity.  Paving  of  the  Tianlin\u2013Leye  road  will  eliminate \nthe dust that plagues roadside communities for 6\u20137 months of the year. People living along the \nroad  will  benefit  greatly  from  this  air  quality  improvement.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the \nmanagement capability of the Cenwanglaoshan Nature Reserve Management Organization by \nproviding  financing  of  up  to  CNY890,000  for  capacity  building,  monitoring,  and  supervision  in \naccordance  with  the  approved  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA).  The  Project  will  also \nsupport ecosystem monitoring focused along the road. This will be a valuable contribution to the \nfuture protection of Guangxi\u2019s biodiversity, and will introduce better nature reserve management \nand operation methods to the Cenwanglaoshan Nature Reserve Management Organization. \n \nD. \n \n43. \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 13. \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,566  million,  including  taxes  (Table  1). \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nItem \nA.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The ADB loan will finance 19% of the total project cost. The \nremaining  cost  will  be  financed  by  MOC;  Guangxi  Zhuang  Autonomous  Regional  People\u2019s \nGovernment  (GRG);  and  cofinancing  through  a  loan  from  China  Bank  of  Communications, \nwhich has appraised the Project and provided a commitment letter to GCD (Table 2). MOC and \nGRG  have  made  budgetary  provisions  for  the  counterpart  funds.  The  PRC  Government  will \nmake the ADB loan proceeds available to GRG, which will relend to GCD, with GCD bearing the \nexchange rate and interest rate variation risk. On implementation of the GCD restructuring plan \nand incorporation of GCIG, GCD will onlend the loan proceeds to GCIG. GCIG will then bear the \nexchange rate and interest rate variation risk. All relending and onlending under the Project will \nbe on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nChina Bank of Communications \nMinistry of Communications \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional \nPeople\u2019s Government \nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n        Amount \n300.0 \n550.0 \n170.0 \n546.0 \n\n1,566.0 \n\n  \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n\n     Percent \n\n19 \n35 \n11 \n35 \n\n100 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\nimplementation  of \n\n \nGCD will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project implementation. Within \n45. \nGCD, the project activities will be coordinated by three bureaus\u2014GIAB (GCIG after June 2008), \nGuangxi Highway Administration Bureau (GHAB), and Guangxi Transport Administration Bureau \n(GTAB)\u2014the implementing agencies. The Project Management Office (PMO) established within \nGCD will be responsible for overall project implementation. The PMO is led by a deputy director \ngeneral, five deputy chiefs (three directors from GIAB, GHAB, GTAB, and two directors in GCD). \nUnder the overall direction of the PMO, three sub-PMOs have been identified to be responsible \nfor \nthe  expressway  under \nfollowing  components:  (i) GIAB, \ncomponent A(a);  (ii) GHAB  for  local  road  improvement  and  maintenance  under  components  B \nand  D;  and  (iii)  GTAB  for  transport  service  improvement  under  component  C.  GCD,  through \nPMO,  will  directly  implement  the  cross-border  trade  facility  under  component  A(b),  and \ncorporate  governance  under  component  E.  GCIG,  after  its  incorporation,  will  take  over \nimplementation  of  component  A(a)  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  its  concession  agreement. \nThe PMO will coordinate and oversee project implementation, submit progress and audit reports \nto  ADB,  and  organize  ADB  supervision  missions.  Organization  charts  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nThe Project will be implemented over about 5 years, from October 2007 to October 2012. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n46. \nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 14. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \n47. \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  expressway  works  will  be  divided  into  13  packages,  10  of \nwhich will be financed by ADB and procured under international competitive bidding procedures. \nAll  pavement  and  equipment  packages  will  be  financed  by  ADB  and  procured  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  All  other  packages,  including  connector  roads, \ntraffic safety and management facilities, landscaping works, buildings, and ancillary facilities will \nbe financed by the Government and procured under government bidding procedures acceptable \nto ADB. Local road sections and the two border bus stations financed by ADB will be procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Tendering  and \nBidding Law (1999), subject to clarifications to the law that have been agreed with ADB for the \npurposes  of  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  All  village  access  roads  and  48 class-V  township \nbus stations financed by ADB will be procured through shopping procedures. Various thresholds \nfor procurement and the contract packages are set out in the procurement plan in Appendix 15. \nThe  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be \nincluded in all documents and contracts related to project bidding and implementation. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n48. \nThe Project will finance 45 person-months of international consulting services, including \n27 person-months  for  the  team  leader  of  the  international  consultants;  and  3  person-months \neach  for  the  following  specialists:  (i)  bridge,  (ii)  tunnel,  (iii)  road  pavement,  (iv)  road  safety, \n(v) restructuring  and  corporate  governance,  and  (vi)  road  passenger  transport.  The  road \npassenger  transport  specialist  will  be  directly  recruited  from  the  international  consultant \nengaged  for  the  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Service  TA  (footnote  11)  to  provide  necessary \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nadvisory  inputs  for  the  rural  transport  services  demonstration  project.  All  other  international \nconsultants will be selected and engaged based on a full technical proposal using the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Project will also provide $100,000 each \nto finance (i) a rural transport services demonstration project, based on the recommendations of \nthe  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Services  TA  (footnote  11),  and  (ii)  a  rural  road  maintenance \npolicy reform study. The two TAs will be undertaken by the national consulting firms. Given the \nvery  small  contract  values  and  the  intensive  relevant  experience  of  the  two  national  firms22 \nproposed  by  GCD  in  the  areas  of  the  studies,  these  firms  will  be  selected  using  the  single-\nsource  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  In \naddition,  GCD  will  engage  and  entirely  finance  7,700  person-months  of  national  consultants. \nThe national consultants, not financed by ADB, will be recruited in accordance with government \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  chief  supervision  engineer  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nproject  supervision,  assisted  by  two  deputies,  one  of  whom  will  be  the  team  leader  of  the \ninternational  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nADB  approved  advance  contracting  on  26  February  2007; \n\n \n49. \nthe \nprequalification  of  contractors,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract  awards.  The  advance \ncontracting  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  ADB  also \napproved the requested retroactive financing for eligible expenditures not exceeding $30 million \nincurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan \nagreement.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\nincludes \n\nthis \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n50. \nAll disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Since  most  payments  will  be \nmade for large contracts, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to withdraw \nthe  loan  funds.  If  the  government  funds  are  used  first  for  eligible  expenditures,  ADB's \nreimbursement procedure will be used. To expedite funds flow and simplify the documentation \nprocess, Guangxi Finance Department may establish an imprest account as required by GCD \nafter  loan  effectiveness.  Disbursement  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an \nappropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest \naccount  will  be  set  as  either  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the \nloan  account,  whichever  is  lower.  The  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for \nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  into  the  imprest \naccount  in  respect  of  individual  payments  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $200,000  in \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the Borrower and ADB. \n \n \n \n51. \nGCD  and  GCIG,  after  its  incorporation  and  commercialization  in  accordance  with  the \nterms  of  the  restructuring  plan,  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  related \nfinancial  statements,  and  will  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  appropriate \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n7. \n\n                                                 \n22  Institute  of  Comprehensive  Transportation  of  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  and  Southwest \n\nJiaotong University.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nindependent  auditors,  whose  qualifications, \nauditing  standards  consistently  applied  by \nexperience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. GCD and GCIG will submit to ADB \nwithin  6 months  of  the  end  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project \naccounts and financial statements, and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, in both English and \nChinese.  A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  statement  of  expenditures  and  the  imprest \naccount,  if  any,  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  auditor\u2019s  report.  During  project  implementation, \nGCD and GCIG will submit quarterly progress reports. GCD and GCIG will provide ADB with a \ncompletion report within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n \n \n52. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  local  and  central  governments.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency, GIAB, GCIG, GHAB, GTAB, \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. \n \n53. \nGCD and GCIG will ensure, during the project implementation, that (i) officials from the \nDiscipline  and  Inspection  Bureau  will  monitor  bidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii) an \ninternal audit unit will be established in GCIG; (iii) a two-contract system will be adopted where \nthe winner of a civil works contract will also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; \n(iv)  periodic  inspection  of  contractors  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  fund  withdrawal  and \nsettlement procedures are followed, and (v) the status of procurements and awards of contracts \nwill  be  published  on  GCD\u2019s  website  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  GCD \nand GCIG will initiate liaison meetings with the Prosecutor's Office, as needed, to discuss any \nwarnings about, or information on, any corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices.  \n \n \n \n54. \nThe  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  indicators,  their  relevance,  and \nmonitoring  practicalities  were  confirmed  and  agreed  with  GCD  during  project  preparation. \nBaseline  socioeconomic  and  trade  indicators  are  in  Appendix  16.  The  key  indicators  and \nassumptions  outlined  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  and  monitoring  of \nsocioeconomic  and  poverty  impacts  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  will  form  the  core  data \nrequired  for  this  assessment.  GCD  will  measure  the  indicators  and  report  the  key  findings  to \nADB on project inception, during the mid-term review, at completion, and for 3 years thereafter. \nGCD will recruit a capable local institute to provide 20 person-months for surveys, analysis, and \nreporting. The terms of reference are included in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n \n \n55. \nTwo years after the Project starts, GCD, GCIG, and ADB will carry out a midterm review \nof the Project, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, \nsocial, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may \nhave an impact on the project\u2019s performance and its continuing viability. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nProject Review \n\n10. \n\n9. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nThe existing national highway is congested and carries high traffic volume. The Project \n56. \nwill  increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity  to  meet  transport  demand  and  will  significantly  reduce \ntransport costs and travel times. The expressway will reduce the trip length between Baise and \nthe  Guizhou  border  by  34  km  and  result  in  time  savings  of  at  least  3  hours.  Traffic  on  the \nexpressway is forecast to grow from an average 6,330 passenger car units per day in 2012 to \nan average of 30,500  per day in 2032. To reflect experience in previous projects, the opening \ntraffic projection considers the \u201cramp-up\u201d effect (footnote 17) on expressways immediately after \nopening (Appendix 17). \n \nB. \n \n57. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing \nscenarios with and without the Project. The project\u2019s economic costs reflect (i) the capital cost \nfor  construction  including  physical  contingencies,  land  acquisition,  and  resettlement;  (ii) O&M \ncosts,  which  include  replacing  depreciated  equipment  and  periodic  maintenance;  and \n(iii) environmental monitoring costs. The economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating \ncosts  as  a  result  of  reduced  road  length,  and  improved  traffic  and  road  conditions;  (ii) time \nsavings  for  road  users;  (iii) savings  in  road  accident  costs  as  a  result  of  fewer  accidents;  and \n(iv) benefits from generated traffic. The Project is economically viable. The EIRR for the whole \nProject is 17.5%. The EIRR is 17.1% for the expressway, 21.7% for the local road network, and \n29.2% for the rural transport service component. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of \nthe project\u2019s economic viability (Appendix 18 and Supplementary Appendix G). \n \nC. \n \nThe proposed toll rates23 for the project expressway are considered reasonable to attract \n58. \nsufficient  traffic  to  meet  the  criteria  for  the  economic  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return. \nFinancial projections have been prepared in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005).  Projected  financial  statements  indicate  that  its \ninternal financial revenues will be sufficient to cover O&M costs and debt service from the sixth \nyear of full operation. The expressway financial internal rate of return is estimated at about 4.5% \nafter  taxes\u2014better  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  3.3%,  also  net  of  taxes. \nSensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  robust  under  adverse \nconditions.  The  Project  is  considered  to  be  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Financial \nmanagement  assessment  found  that  the  Project  meets  the  minimum  financial  management \nrequirements  and  can  provide  accurate  and  timely  information  on  its  status  in  the  reporting \nformat agreed with ADB (Appendix 19 and Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nD. \n \nSocioeconomic  Profile.  The  Project  is  located  in  a  poor  rural  area  predominantly \n59. \ninhabited by ethnic minorities. The Project will benefit 2.3 million people in Baise, of whom 87% \nlive in rural areas and 30% of these live on less than $1 per person per day.24 The project area \n                                                 \n23  The  proposed  toll  rates  are  CNY0.40\u2013CNY1.68  per  vehicle-km.  Under  the  Guangxi  provincial  \u201cgreen  passage\u201d \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\nregulations, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempt from tolls. \n\n24 Per Baise Poverty Alleviation Office, 138,416 absolutely  poor people live below  CNY668 per capita per  year and \n468,445  poor  people  live  below  CNY924  per  capita  per  year.  In  total,  606,861  live  well  below  the  international \npoverty line of $1 per person per day (using purchasing power parity and measured in terms of consumption). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nhas 1,184 administrative villages, of which 54% are classified as poverty villages. Rural poverty \nis  due  to  remote  and  isolated  locations,  low  education  and  technical  skills,  disease,  and \ndisability. Of the small urban population (13% of total), 11% are considered poor; urban poverty \nis primarily due to unemployment, old age, or disability. \n \n60. \nSocial  Benefits.  The  construction  of  the  expressway  will  shorten  travel  distance  and \ntravel  time,  and  relieve  traffic  congestion  on  NH324,  which  is  the  only  main  road  for  local \nresidents. Transportation improvements will promote local production of higher-value cash crops. \nUpgrading of 310 km of local roads will benefit 412,000 people, of which 30% are poor and 80% \nare ethnic minorities. Many rural villages still have poor access and may not benefit directly from \nthe Project. The results of the analysis in Guangxi II show that the average agricultural income \nin  villages  served  by  gravel  roads  was  35%  higher  than  those  for  villages  served  by  tracks, \nreflecting greater sales of agricultural produce made possible with better access to markets. For \nthis reason, GCD has agreed to (i) construct 50 township bus stations and (ii) upgrade 750 km \nof village roads, which will benefit 200\u2013400 poverty villages and 250,000 people, of which 50% \nare poor and 90% are ethnic minorities (Appendix 20). \n \n61. \nJob  and  Skill  Training  Benefits. In addition to improved transport, the construction of \nthe  expressway  and  rural  roads  will  provide  significant  employment  and  skill  training  benefits. \nApproximately  53.1  million  person-days  will  be  required  for  expressway  construction;  70%  of \nthis labor is expected to be unskilled. At least 50% of the unskilled work will be sourced locally. \nThus,  about  18.6  million  person-days  of  local  employment  amounting  to  CNY318 million  in \nwages  will  benefit  local  communities.  About  70%  of  landscaping  work  and  supplying  daily \nnecessities  can  employ  women.  In  total,  18,500  local  residents  will  gain  employment  and  skill \ntraining during project implementation.  \n \n62. \nControl  and  Mitigation  of  Epidemic  Diseases.  To  address  the  risks  of  spreading \nHIV/AIDS  and  other  communicable  diseases,  implementation  of  the  following  measures  is \nrequired:  (i) health  screening  of  contract  and  migrant  workers  and  locally  hired  workers  for \nHIV/AIDS and other transmissible diseases (malaria and tuberculosis), (ii) awareness programs \nfor  construction  workers  and  local  communities,  (iii)  monitoring  of  workers  and  possible  cases \nduring construction; and (iv) a targeted awareness campaign at the start of expressway operation. \nInformation  will  be  also  provided  in  bus  stations,  service  areas,  and  border  crossings.  The \nmonitoring  will  be  implemented  by  the  Baise  Center  for  Disease  Control.  Guangxi  Health \nDepartment  has  been  allocating  additional  funds  to  Baise  to  address  their  increasing  needs. \nHealth, awareness, screening, and treatment requirements are stipulated in the standard contract \nbidding document, and compliance will be monitored regularly. The regional technical assistance, \nFighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific,25 will assist in developing and implementing effective \nmeasures for HIV/AIDS prevention in road transport in Guangxi and Yunnan. \n \nEthnic  Minorities  Development  Plan  (EMDP).  Ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area \n63. \nmake  up  80.3%  of  the  total  population  and  comprise  87.7%  of  the  absolute  poor.  Ethnic \nminorities will be one of the primary beneficiaries of the Project. Some smaller groups such as \nthe Miao and Yao (6.7% and 5.3% of total, respectively) live in very isolated mountain areas and \ntend  to  be  the  poorest.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  target  the  Miao  and  Yao  for  enhancement \nmeasures,  including  provision  of  village  roads,  improved  bus  service,  skill  training,  and \nmicrocredit. Enhancement measures are specified in the EMDP; priority will be given to women \nto enhance direct and indirect project benefits and ensure protection against social risks such as \nHIV/AIDS. GCD will take the lead in assisting the concerned local agencies in implementing the \nEMDP with the support of Guangxi Ethnic Affairs Commission and its local offices (Appendix 21). \n\n                                                 \n25  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Management Plan \n\nSmall Business Development. The Project will promote small business development in \n64. \ntwo aspects: (i) tourism and (ii) agricultural product trading. The Project will have direct impacts \nby  reducing  travel  times  and  transport  cost,  improving  rural  roads  that  serve  tourist  sites,  and \nconstructing  two  class-III  bus  stations  in  Jingxi  county,  which  will  enhance  small  business \ntrading near the border crossings (such as the livestock market in Naxi). Local governments will \nsupport  small  business  development  in  the  project  area  by  providing  financial  resources  for \nsmall business. The construction tax revenue to be collected by local governments is estimated \nat CNY240 million (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nBeneficiary  Participation. More than 5,000 people were interviewed  during the public \n65. \nopinion  surveys,  social  and  environmental  assessments,  and \nresettlement  planning \n(Supplementary  Appendix  J).  Overall,  local  residents  show  strong  support  for  the  Project  and \nwelcomed  the  opportunity  to  express  their  views.  According  to  local  residents,  the  greatest \nbenefit  will  be  increased  economic  development  in  the  area  resulting  in  increased  income \nsources  and  more  job  opportunities.  Farmers  have  a  keen  understanding  of  the  direct  link \nbetween transport costs and farm profit margins, and expect lower freight costs and improved \naccess to benefit them directly. People also place emphasis on a cleaner environment with less \ndust, and easier and faster transport in general. Residents also state that improved roads would \nprovide better access for children traveling to schools and improve road safety. The consultation \nand  participation  process,  including  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  women,  has  influenced  the \nproject design and alignment, and the formulation of the environment management plan (EMP), \nresettlement plans, and EMDP. \n \nE. \n \n66. \nADB  classifies  the  Project  as  environment  category  A.  The  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  for  the  expressway  was  prepared  by  GCD  and  approved  by  the  State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration in October 2006. GCD prepared EIAs for Tianlin\u2013Leye \nand  Napo\u2013Dingye  local  roads;  these  were  approved  by  Guangxi  Environmental  Protection \nBureau in March 2007. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) were prepared for other local \nroads. For the bus stations and village roads, the sites and road sections will be selected during \nproject implementation. Environmental assessment review procedures were prepared as part of \nthe village road implementation framework (VRIF) (para. 37) and agreed with GCD. A summary \nEIA  for  the  Project  was  endorsed  by  GCD,  circulated  to  the  ADB  Board,  and  made  public \nthrough  ADB\u2019s  website  on  9  April  2007.  The  EIAs,  IEEs,  and  summary  EIA  assess  the \nenvironmental  impact  of  the  selected  alignments  of  the  expressway,  local  roads,  and  bus \nstations; and prescribe environmental protection and mitigation measures costing $23 million. To \nensure  that  all  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  are  mitigated,  GCD  will \nimplement  the  EMP  as  specified  in  the  EIAs,  IEEs,  and  summary  EIA.  The  EMP  will  be \nincorporated in the bidding documents and contracts for civil works. \n \nF. \n \n67. \nThis  is  an  involuntary  resettlement  category  A  project.  GCD  has  prepared  draft \nresettlement  plans  for  the  expressway  and  for  the  six  local  roads.  For  the  bus  stations  and \nvillage  roads,  the  sites  or  road  sections  will  be  identified  during  project  implementation,  a \nresettlement  policy  framework  and  procedural  guidelines  were  prepared  as  part  of  the  VRIF. \nResettlement information booklets were distributed to affected villages in March 2007. Based on \nthe Chinese standard for impact assessment, the equivalent of 6,030 people would lose all their \nland  and  agricultural  livelihoods.  Since  the  expressway  will  actually  cross  many  parcels  of \nscattered farmland, the average loss of land per household is estimated at 20%, which means \nthat about 30,150 people would be partially affected. About 1,568 households will be relocated. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nBorrower Commitment, and Ownership \n\nLocal  government  will  implement  resettlement  with  supervision  by  GCD.  In  addition,  an \nindependent  agency  will  be  contracted  by  GCD  to  carry  out  the  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation. For land compensation, the expressway will apply national standards and the local \nroads  will  apply  provincial  regulations.  GCD  will  finance  the  cost  of  resettlement  for  the \nexpressway component. Local government will finance resettlement for other components with \npartial subsidy from GCD (Appendix 22). \n \nG. \n \n68. \nCentral and provincial governments strongly support the Project, particularly the regional \nimpact, integrated design, participatory approach, and policy and instructional reform initiatives. \nOverall,  the  project  preparatory  team  met  more  than  1,500  local  residents  during  consultation \nmeetings  and  field  surveys.  GCD,  local  governments,  and  residents  express  tremendous \nsupport  and  emphasize  the  need  for  the  Project;  and  they  participated  in  the  project \nidentification  and  planning  process.  Current  government  program  (such  as  comprehensive \nvillage poverty reduction program) in the project area will be ongoing throughout the life of the \nProject.  Specific  objectives  of  the  government  program  include  improvements  to  living \nconditions  of  rural  poor  through  improved  rural  infrastructure,  training,  micro  credit,  access  to \ndrinking water, increased arable land, improved housing, and biogas facilities. The government \nprogram  will  complement  activities  undertaken  by  the  Project,  which  provides  an  integrated \napproach for addressing poverty. \n \nH. \n \nThe  project  design  has  considered  potential  technical,  financial,  and  social  risks.  The \n69. \nmain  technical  risks  are  associated  with  the  design  and  construction  of  many  bridges  and \ntunnels.  To  minimize  technical  risks,  (i) the  Project  will  be  implemented  by  experienced  staff; \n(ii) preliminary  design  will  focus  on  detailed  geotechnical  investigations;  (iii)  international \nconsultants  will  help  prepare  a  risk  management  plan;  (iv)  the  bidding  system  will  focus  on \nfinancial  and  technical  capabilities  of  contractors  in  handling  similar  works;  (v)  a  contract \nmanagement information system will help identify technical problems and implement corrective \nmeasures on time; and (vi) given the safety hazards associated with bridge and tunnel works, \nthe contractors will be required to strictly enforce working safety rules and measures. To control \nthe financial risks, the Project will (i) strengthen contract management, (ii) inject more equity into \nthe Project, (iii) introduce a market-based approach to formulating tolls and regularly reviewing \ntoll  rates  to  ensure  cost  recovery,  and  (iv)  build  a  business  environment  to  generate  nontoll \nrevenues.  Social  issues  include  resettlement  and  HIV/AIDS  infection.  Appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures are in place in the resettlement plans and EMDP. GCD demonstrated high ownership \nin preparing and committing to implement these action plans. \n \n\nRisks \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, GRG, and GCD have given the \n\n \n70. \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n71. \nGCIG.

Poverty impact \n\nActions Taken by ADB and the \nGovernment \nPromoting pro-poor equitable and \ninclusive growth has been ADB\u2019s \nprimary goal in the PRC. Projects \nfinanced by the ADB in the PRC \ncountry strategy and program are \nfocused in poorer central and \nwestern regions. \n\nThe geography of \nPeople\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) poses \ngreat obstacles to \nproviding basic road \naccess throughout the \ncountry, particularly in \ninner and low-income \nprovinces.  \n \n\n2.  Rural road \n\ndevelopment \n\nRural roads are \nlargely in poor \ncondition.  \n \n\nA rural road development strategy \nis being formulated under the Rural \nRoad Development Strategy \ntechnical assistance (TA) \n\n2\n8\n \n\n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\nTo enhance development impact, the \nproject scope includes (i) components on \nrural roads and rural transport services for \npoor areas, and (ii) implementation of \npolicy reforms for rural road services and \nrural road maintenance. The Project \nfacilitates negotiation between the PRC \nand Viet Nam on cross-border transport \nagreement to promote regional \ncooperation and poverty reduction in \nwestern Guangxi and northern Viet Nam.  \n\nThe 11th Five-Year Program \n( FYP) of Guangxi \nCommunications \nDepartment (GCD) \nemphasizes new \ncountryside development \nand support for rural \ninfrastructure development. \n\nTo reduce time and cost to access \neconomic opportunities and social \nservices in the rural area, the Project \nincludes upgrading 1,060 kilometers (km) \nof local roads comprising (i) three border \nroads totaling 50 km, (ii) three priority rural \nroad totaling 260 km; and (iii) village \naccess roads totaling 750 km.  \n\nGCD set a 2010 target: \npaved road will reach all \ntownships and 50% of \nvillages in Guangxi. GCD \nplans to invest \nCNY14.9 billion to upgrade \n50,022 km of rural roads \nfrom 2006 to 2010.  \n\n3.  Rural road \ntransport \nservices \n\n4.  Road design \n\nstandards and \nconstruction \nquality \n\nLow vehicle \nutilization, high \noperating costs, and \ninefficient bus routes \nbecause of restrictive \nregulations. \n\nHighway design \nstandards are not \nalways adequate for \nvehicle mix and road \nconditions. \n \n\nMOC concurs with the rural road \ntransport services reforms \nproposed under the Sustainable \nRural Transport Services TA. \n\nTo increase rural mobility, the Project \nincludes (i) construction of 50 township \nbus stations; and (ii) implementation of \npassenger bus route licensing reform.  \n\nAssistance in developing the \nprevious standards, including \ntransport efficiency, road safety, \nand environmental considerations, \nunder the Review of Highway \nDesign Standards TA. New design \nstandards of the Ministry of \nCommunications were applied in \n2004. \n\nTo ensure engineering standards more \nclosely fit the travel demand and pattern \non the project roads, alternative analysis \nwas conducted for all project roads. For \nexample, for Tianlin\u2013Leye local road, the \noption of upgrading the road along the \nexisting road alignment was selected as \nthe preferred option, which includes \npaving and shoulder protection, slope \nstabilization, and drainage improvement; \nall will be done without removal of trees \nand vegetation, excavation, and no side \ncasting of materials. \n\nThe proposed reforms of \nSustainable Rural Transport \nServices TA will be \ndemonstrated and tested by \nthe pilot demonstration \nproject in the project area. \n\nFor Tianlin-Leye local road, \nGuangxi Environment \nProtection Bureau approved \na separate environmental \nimpact assessment. \nGuangxi Forestry \nDepartment conducted an \nindependent review. GCD \nwill ensure that these \nmitigation measures are \nimplemented and adhered \nto.  \n\n \n\n5.  Road safety \n\nPoor safety design, \nlack of sufficient \nattention to safety, \nand inadequate  \n\nAssistance is being provided to \nimprove safety and efficiency of \nroad transport operations and  \n\nThe Project will address safety issues by \n(i) increasing public awareness of road \nsafety; (ii) conducting safety audits and \n\nRoad accidents in 2006 \nshow improvement over \n2005.

By then, vehicle \nemissions will be reduced by \n30%. \n\nSix months prior to the \nopening of the expressway, \nGCD will submit to ADB for \nreview the proposed toll \nstructure and rates. After \nthat, the toll rates will be \nreviewed annually.  \n\nGCIG will be established by \n30 June 2008.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVehicle testing and monitoring \nwere promoted under the regional \nTA: Action Plans for Reducing \nVehicle Emissions. \n\nThe Project will contribute to reduced \nvehicle emissions because it offers better \nroad roughness value, lower congestion, \nand more efficient operation. \n\nThe toll diversion manual was \ndisseminated under the \nChongqing\u2013Guizhou Expressway \nTA in 2000. The manual will be \nupdated by December 2008. \n\nImpact of the proposed toll charges under \nthe Project was reviewed to satisfy the \ncriteria: (i) cost recovery, and (ii) do not \ndeter potential users and compromise \neconomic objectives.  \n\n\u2022  Assistance was provided \n\nthrough the Corporatization, \nLeasing, and Securitization in \nthe Road Sector TA. \n\n\u2022  Guangxi Southwest Expressway \n\nExpressway operations will be separated \nfrom Guangxi government function by \ncreating Guangxi Communications \nInvestment and Construction Group \nCompany Limited (GCIG). \n\nCompany Limited was \nestablished in 2005 to be \nresponsible for the operation of \nGuangxi I and Guangxi II.  \n\nPrivate sector financing of road \ninfrastructure investment accounts \nfor 10% of PRC\u2019s total commitment \nto road sector since 1980s. ADB-\nfinanced Northeast Expressway \nCompany and Changyong \nExpressway Corporation were \nsecuritized as part of stock listing \nsince 1999.  \n\nGuangxi is actively encouraging private \nsector participation (PSP) in the road \nsector, making use of both build-operate-\ntransfer and cooperative joint venture \narrangement.  \n \n\nGuilin\u2013Liuzhu expressway \nwas formed as a joint-\nventure between GCD and a \nHong Kong Investment \nBank.

Within GCD, GIAB constructs, and GEAB operates and maintains expressways \nin Guangxi. SWEC was created on 20 July 2005 to operate and maintain the roads under ADB\u2019s \nGuangxi  Roads  Development  Project  (Guangxi  I)  and  Guangxi  Roads  Development  Project  II \n(Guangxi  II).  GCD  now  proposes  to  restructure  and  consolidate  the  expressway  operations  of \nGIAB,  GEAB,  and  SWEC  into  a  new  company\u2014GCIG\u2014either  as  operating  divisions  or \nsubsidiaries  of  GCIG.  GCD  will  complete  its  analysis  and  prepare  a  restructuring  plan  by \n31 October  2007,  and  a  corporate  development  plan  for  GCIG  by  31  March  2008. Thereafter, \nGCD  will  implement  the  restructuring  plan  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  and  incorporate  and \ncommercialize GCIG by 30 June 2008. \n \n2. \nScope  of  Business.  The  primary  objective  of  GCIG  will  be  to  construct,  develop, \nmaintain,  and  operate  the  project  expressway  and  other  expressways,  and  select  class-I  and \nclass-II highways in Guangxi. GCIG will (i) have the right to collect tolls from users of the roads, \nin accordance with the terms and conditions of each concession granted to it; (ii) be authorized \n\n8. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34  \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nto  retain  toll  and  nontoll  revenue  in  the  business;  and  maintain  full  financial  accounts  of  its \nassets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses; and (iii) have the right to engage in developing and \noperating other infrastructure projects such as toll roads, bridges, tunnels, and ancillary facilities, \nincluding property development along the toll roads in Guangxi and elsewhere in the PRC. \n \n3. \nCapitalization.  GCIG  will  be  incorporated  with  an  initial  equity  capital  of  CNY3  billion. \nGCIG  will  initially  be  registered  as  a  solely  state-owned  company,  and  will  explore  possible \ncapital contributions from private investors, and on receipt of which, will convert itself into a joint \nstock company under the Company Law of the PRC. At least 6 months prior to the opening of \nthe  expressway,  GCIG  will  analyze  the  feasibility  of  accessing  financing  from  the  financial \nmarkets for future road sector investments, and possible private sector participation in O&M of \nthe project expressway; and report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n4. \nCorporate  Governance. GCIG will have a board of directors with a minimum of 5 and \nmaximum of 19 directors. The board will have at least one director representing the employees, \nwho will be democratically elected in a general meeting of employee representatives. On receipt \nof  any  private  sector  investment,  GCIG  will  modify  its  articles  of  association  to  permit \nappointment of independent directors and directors representing other investors. \n \n5. \nThe  board  of  directors  will  be  responsible,  inter  alia,  for  determining  the  operation, \ninvestment,  and  financing  plans;  annual  budgets;  appointment  of  a  manager  for  day-to-day \noperations;  and  developing  administrative  and  management  policies.  A  chairperson  and  a \ndeputy  chairperson  will  be  appointed  from  the  members  of  the  board  and  will  not  hold  a \nconcurrent  post  in  any  other  limited  liability  company,  joint  stock  company,  or  economic \norganization. \n \n6. \nGCIG  will  also  have  a  board  of  at  least  5  supervisors,  of  whom  employee \nrepresentatives will account for at least one third. The board of supervisors will have the right to \nscrutinize the financial affairs of the company; supervise the directors and senior managers; and \neven  require  their  removal  in  the  event  of  violation  of  any  law,  administrative  regulation,  or \narticles of association. \n \n7. \nwith the National Audit Law and the Company Law of the PRC. \n \n8. \nCorporate  Development  Plan. A corporate development plan will be formulated to set \nstandards  for  corporate  governance,  management,  financial  reporting,  and  human  resource \ndevelopment in GCIG by 31 March 2008. Comprehensive institutional development and training \nprograms  will  be  implemented  under  the  Project.  This  plan  will  involve  (i)  establishment  of  a \nmanagement structure and adoption of good corporate governance measures, (ii) organizational \nand  resource  development,  (iii)  creation  of  financial  and  administrative  systems,  and \n(iv) preparation of short- and long-term strategic business plans. \n \n9. \nConcession  Agreements.  GCD  will  enter  into  concession  agreements  with  GCIG  for \nthe  project  expressway  and  other  expressways  in  Guangxi.  Such  agreements  will  ensure  that \nGCIG  (i)  bears  the  responsibility  for  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  project \nexpressway  and  other  expressways  in  accordance  with  the  engineering,  technical,  social \nsafeguards  including  environmental,  and  highway  operation  and  maintenance  standards; \n(ii) complies with the required financial requirements, including the agreed financial performance \nratios; (iii) performs all other obligations in the ADB loan and project agreements to the extent \napplicable  to  it;  and  (iv)  enjoys  autonomy  in  construction,  operating,  and  maintaining  of  the \nproject expressways. \n\nGCIG will appoint an external auditor to annually audit its financial reports in accordance \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nRURAL TRANSPORT SERVICES AND POLICY REFORM \n\nThe Rural Transport System in Guangxi \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nRationale. The project\u2019s transport services component comprises a program of building \nbus  stations  and  introducing  associated  bus  route  improvements  through  licensing  reforms. \nTogether with the expressway and rural road improvements, it will help establish an integrated \nrural  transport  service  network  and  raise  the  accessibility  of  the  areas  served.  Cheaper,  more \nfrequent, more reliable, and safer transport services will improve access to jobs and education, \nand health and welfare services; raise incomes from the sale of produce; increase the range of \ngoods  and  services  available  locally;  and  improve  access  to  information  on  prices  and \nmarketing opportunities. As well as encouraging these service improvements, the bus stations \nwill themselves offer employment opportunities, create a market for small-scale traders (of food, \ndrinks,  etc.)  and  businesses  (e.g.,  vehicle  maintenance  and  repair),  improve  access  to \ninformation by public telephone, and provide better amenities for passengers. \n \nTransport Services. In Guangxi, formal passenger services in rural areas are mostly by \n2. \n6\u20138-seat minibuses or 15\u201320-seat buses. They are licensed to stop only at designated places \nand stations, but few towns and none of the villages have stations, even simple stops. Where no \nformal services are available, the informal sector plays an important role, especially on poorer \nquality  roads,  but  their safety  standards  are  deficient  and  they  are  often  more  expensive  than \nformal  services.  Generally,  bus  services  are  good  along  routes  between  county  and  township \ncenters, but do not exist between villages and are rare between villages and townships. Overall, \nin  2005,  all  townships  had  a  formal  service,  but  580  administrative  villages  and  3,654 natural \nvillages in the project area did not have a formal service. \n \n3. \nRegulatory  Framework. Guangxi Transport Administration Bureau (GTAB) is the main \nagency  involved  in  road  transport  administration  in  Guangxi.  The  bureau  is  responsible  for \nregulating the road transport industry by licensing intercity bus services.1 County communications \nbureaus  are  responsible  for  the  regulation  of  road  transport  within  provinces.  Licensing \nconditions for bus services, routes, and stations are restrictive, requiring buses and drivers to be \nconfined to their authorized routes and schedules to be fixed by station operators. While freight \ntariffs  are  fully  deregulated,  passenger  fares  are  allowed  to  vary  within  narrow  bands  around \nguideline rates set by Guangxi Communications Department (GCD). \n \n4. \nTransport  Demand  and  Users\u2019  Needs.  Most  trips  in  rural  areas  are  to  buy  and  sell \nproduce and for work. The average household in the project area makes 22 trips per annum to \ntheir  nearest  township  and  only  4  to  their  nearest  county  center;  the  poor  travel  much  less. \nWhere  formal  services,  which  charge  CNY0.10\u2013CNY0.20  per  kilometer  (km),  are  unavailable, \nfares on informal services are expensive: as much as CNY0.40\u2013CNY0.50 per km. Consequently, \nhalf of all trips by poor households are on foot (bicycles are unsuited to the mountainous terrain), \neven over distances of up to 14 km. On average, transport accounts for 4%\u20138% of household \nexpenses. For poor villages and those with poor road access, the proportion is much higher. To \nhelp reduce costs and encourage expansion of services, Guangxi discounts selected fees and \ntaxes  for  buses  that  have  at  least  20%  of  their  route  on  roads  of  class  IV  or  lower.  Some \n6,798  buses benefited from this in 2006. \n \n5. \nIssues and Priorities for Improvement. Bus productivity in the project area is very low: \n170  km  per  day  on  average  for  medium-sized  buses  and  less  than  30  km  per  day  for  small \nbuses,  according  to  official  statistics.  This  reflects  low  demand,  poor  roads,  and  inefficient \nscheduling of vehicles; in turn a function of long waiting times at stations and inability to rotate \n\n                                                 \n1   City bus services are the responsibility of the regional agencies of the Ministry of Construction. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36  \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nRural Transport Services Component \n\nbuses onto other routes. Unit costs are consequently high. In addition to extending the network \nof formal services into villages, the cost of rural services needs to be lowered by raising vehicle \nand  driver  productivity  and  providing  users  with  more  frequent  services  and  a  wider  range  of \nchoices.  Safety  needs  to  be  increased  by  bringing  more  of  the  network  under  the  control  of \nsafety regulations. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nTownship  Bus  Stations.  The  Project  will  support  the  construction  of  48  class-V  and \n2 class-III township bus stations (Map 3). The main criteria include that the new station will (i) be \nin accordance with GCD\u2019s 11th Five-Year Program; (ii) help develop bus services in areas also \nbenefiting  from  the  Project\u2019s  expressway  and  rural  road  components,  i.e.,  contribute  to  an \nintegrated solution to the needs of communities in the project area; (iii) help improve access to \npoorer  villages  and  townships  in  the  project  area;  and  (iv)  serve  as  a  focus  for  bus  services \noperating  between  townships  and  surrounding  villages.  The  layout  and  design  of  the  bus \nstations  will  not  be  standardized  but  vary  with  local  circumstances,  provided  that  they  comply \nwith a basic set of functional principles. \n \n7. \nEach  bus  station  will  provide  ancillary  facilities  for  small-scale  businesses  where \nappropriate after consultations with local communities and potential operators. The two class-III \nstations  are  in  Longbang  and  Yuexu  to  help  facilitate  cross-border  trade  and  development  of \nlocal businesses and employment. The locations of both are near the center of town and closely \nintegrated with planned border trade markets and freight interchange facilities. The component \nis projected to cost CNY27.6 million ($3.6 million), of which $1.4 million will be financed by the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  (Table  A6).  The  remaining  cost  will  be  financed  by  the \nMinistry  of  Communications,  local  governments,  and/or  the  private  sector.  Each  will  be \nmanaged  by  bus  or  station  operators  following  tender.  The  investors  selected  by  competitive \nbidding will have the opportunity to include additional commercial facilities within the design.  \n \n\nTable A6: Estimated Cost of Rural Bus Stations  \n\n \nStandard \nClass V \nClass III \nTotal \n\n \nNo. \n48 \n  2 \n50 \n\nUnit Cost \n(CNY million) \n0.5 \n1.8 \n \n\nCost \n(CNY million) \n\n24 \n3.6 \n27.6 \n\nCost \n($ million) \n3.1 \n0.5 \n3.6 \n\nADB Financing \n(%) \n40 \n40 \n\nTotal ADB Financing \n($ million) \n1.20 \n0.20 \n1.40 \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, No. = number. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n8. \nBus  Route  Licensing  Reform.  The  Ministry  of  Communications  issued  the  Road \nPassenger  Transport  and  Terminal  Regulation  in  August  2005  allowing  the  communications \nbureaus  some  flexibility  in  issuing  regional  rather  than  fixed-route  licenses  for  rural  services. \nHowever, the following restrictions remain: (i) specific buses are designated for licensed routes, \nthereby  restricting  their  use  on  other  routes  (thus  limiting  opportunities  for  improved  utilization \nthrough  inter-working);  (ii)  licensed  routes  must  have  one  end  in  a  terminal  (thus  limiting  the \nextension  of  services  into  rural  areas  with  no  terminals);  and  (iii)  licensing  of  bus  routes  on \nunclassified roads where many of the isolated poor live is restricted.  \n \n9. \nADB  has  had  extensive  dialogue  on  how  to  improve  the  performance  of  transport \nservices  in  the  project  area.  Guangxi  was  selected  as  one  of  the  case  study  provinces  in  the \nSustainable Rural Transport Services technical assistance (TA) in 2006.2 The TA reviewed the \ncurrent  issues  in  providing  rural  road  transport  services  and  recommended  reforms  to  help \nestablish more demand-responsive services between townships and nearby villages.

This will allow some flexibility for operators to adjust their services in \nline with passenger needs and use their vehicles and drivers more productively. \n \n10. \nPilot  Demonstration  Project. The proposed reforms of rural transport services will be \ndemonstrated and tested by means of a pilot demonstration project in Baise to ensure that they \nare  workable  before  an  attempt  is  made  to  introduce  the  reforms  throughout  the  country.  The \npilot  project  involves  establishing  a  township-based  bus  cooperative  or  rural  bus  company \nbased  at  a  township  within  the  city.  The  bus  company  or  cooperative  will  hold  a  license  for \nvillage  bus  routes  with  freedom  to  select  bus  sizes  and  allocate  buses  to  routes  according  to \ndemand, with clear incentives to optimize bus utilization.

The \ncommunications bureau will be responsible for its day-to-day management. Overall direction will \nbe  given  by  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  director  of  Guangxi  Transport  Administration \nBureau.  Under  the  pilot  project,  a  network  of  county-based  routes  extending  to  the  villages \nbeyond a given township will be replaced by a village bus service based in the township. The \nholder of the township-based village bus route licenses will be a local company or cooperative \nformed  by  local  bus  or  minibus  owners.  The  pilot  project  will  help  formulate  this  group,  and \nprovide training for new operators in basic management techniques, bus service planning and \noperations, and safety.

According to official statistics, in 2006 the country recorded 378,781 traffic accidents \nwith  89,455  fatalities;  the  number  of  deaths  might  have  been  greater  if  unrecorded  accidents \nwere  included.  At  3  recorded  deaths  per  1,000  vehicles,  the  PRC\u2019s  accident  rate  is  high  by \ninternational standards; Guangxi records 6 deaths per 1,000 vehicles. In response, the Ministry \nof  Public  Security\u2019s  Road  Safety  Action  Plan  is  to  facilitate  implementation  of  the  2004  Road \nSafety  Law  by  improving  vehicle  safety,  driver  training,  and  traffic  management.  The  accident \nrates have started to fall. In 2006. Guangxi reported 8,895 road accidents, 3,016 fatalities, and \n11,336 injuries, down from 17%, 14%, and 10% in 2005. \n \nLike other provinces in the PRC, Guangxi Public Security Bureau (GPSB) and Guangxi \n2. \nCommunications Department (GCD) are the main institutions involved in road safety. GPSB is \nresponsible  for  vehicle  testing  and  licensing,  driver  training  and  testing,  law  enforcement  and \neducation,  treatment,  and  collection  of  accident  data.  GCD  is  responsible  for  design, \nconstruction,  and  maintenance  of  highways;  as  well  as  installation  and  maintenance  of  road \ntraffic  signs  and  markings.  The  safety  work  is  coordinated  between  GPSB  and  GCD,  but \ncooperation  between  GPSB  and  GCD  is  not  strong  and  needs  strengthening.  The  Project  will \nhelp  share  road  safety  information;  identify  the  relationship  between  accidents  and  road \nconditions;  as  well  as  improve  detection,  education,  and  enforcement.  GPSB  will  conduct \neducation campaigns targeting communities through lectures and publicity materials developed \nunder the Asian Development Bank Road Safety Improvement technical assistance.1 \n \n\nBox A7: Road Safety Improvement Program \n\n \n\u2022  Signs and Markings. Speed limit signs will be placed at 0.2 kilometer (km) after the end of each interchange \nentry  taper,  with  repeaters  on  the  main  expressway  at  approximately  20  km  intervals  and  proposed  for  all \ntunnels.  Signage  warns  of  tiredness,  drunk  driving,  and  rear-end  collisions;  and  indicates  the  safe  driving \ndistance between vehicles. The use of thermoplastic paint is recommended for road markings and reflected \nroad studs are to be mounted along the centerline of the road as well as at the carriageway edges to reduce \nwandering of vehicles at night. Variable message signs will be used on the expressway. \n\n \n\u2022  Controlling  Overloading  of  Vehicles.  This  is  essential  to  reduce  pavement  damage  and  increase  road \nsafety because of (i) higher demands on vehicle braking systems, chassis strength, and flexibility; (ii) vehicle \nstability  when  rounding  curves;  and  (iii)  steering  difficulties  resulting  from  heavy  rear-end  loads.  To  control \noverloading,  in  coordination  with  Guangxi  Public  Security  Bureau,  Guangxi  Communications  Department \n(GCD)  will  implement  weight-based  tolling  for  all  expressways  and  parallel  toll  highways  by  31  December \n2007. \n\n \n\u2022  Black-Spot  Treatment  Pilot  Program.  Systematic  black-spot  analysis  and  treatments  have  proved  to \neffectively improve road safety. GCD agrees to carry out a special black-spot program under the Project. A \nspecial  black-spot  group  will  be  established  in  Guangxi  and  trained  under  the  Project  by  an  international \nconsultant for about 1.5 months during the first year of project implementation. They will fix the black spots \nidentified  along  national  highway  (NH)  324.  During  the  second  year,  the  consultants  will  return  for  a  half \nmonth to make sure the group can identify and analyze black spots, and carry out work in control sites along \nNH324; and provide guidance as needed. After completion of the pilot program, the black-spot work will be \ncontinued as a part of GCD\u2019s normal regular traffic safety maintenance work. The personnel who participated \nin  the  pilot  black-sport  work  will  be  responsible  for  training  the  relevant  personnel  in  city  and  county \ncommunication bureaus. \n\n \n\u2022  Road  Safety  Audit.  The  following  areas  need  particular  attention  to  achieve  road  safety  improvement  in \nGuangxi,  e.g.,  safety  in  work  zones,  safety  audit  procedures  for  improved  road  management,  speed \nmonitoring  and  control,  tunnel  construction  and  operation,  truck  and  bus  safety,  and  control  of  overloaded \nvehicles. The Project will conduct road safety audit reviews and make recommendations in these areas. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

Major vehicle emission are carbon monoxide (CO), \ncarbon  dioxide  (CO2),  hydrocarbon  (HC),  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx),  sulfur  oxides  (SOx),  and \nsuspended particulate matters (SPM). CO, HC, NOx, SOx, and SPM cause local air pollution and \nhealth issues, and CO2 increases global warming and causes climate change. Improvement of \ntraffic efficiency and vehicle quality could decrease all vehicle emissions. The major pollutants \nto  be  measured  to  by  the  Project  are  CO,  CO2,  HC,  SOx,  NOx,  and  SPM.  The  amount  of \nreduction of CO, CO2, HC, and NOx at project level were assessed. \n \nA. \n \nReduction  of  NOx,  HC,  CO,  and  CO2  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  case  with  and \n2. \nwithout the Project. Without the Project, traffic will continue to use the existing road, which will \nbe  more  congested,  engines  will  consume  more  fuel  and  produce  more  pollutants  by \ndecelerating,  accelerating,  and  driving  at  very  slow  speed.  With  the  Project,  traffic  will  benefit \nfrom shorter distance, optimal alignment, and less congestion. Vehicles will operate efficiently at \nhigh speed without stop-and-go, which will result in lower fuel consumption and less emission of \npollutants. The estimation of vehicle emissions is based on the relationship of fuel consumption, \nemission of pollutants, and vehicle average speed.  \n \n3. \nFor  the  first  operating  year,  fuel  conservation  for  passenger  and  freight  vehicles  in  the \ncorridor  is  estimated  to  be  more  than  11,000  tons  oil  equivalent  (toe)  with  a  total  saving  of \n982,000 toe over the 20-year forecast period, or 25% lower than without the Project. In addition, \nit will result in the reduction of pollutants emission of 39,000 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2), with a \ntotal  reduction  of  CO2  by  4.7  million  tons  over  the  20-year  forecast  period.  Guangxi \nEnvironmental Protection Board will monitor emissions on project roads (Table A8.1). \n \n\nTable A8.1: Estimated Vehicle Emission Reduction in the Project Corridor  \n(ton oil equivalent) \n\nItem \nFuel Savings \nReduced CO2 Emission \n\n2012 \n11,000  \n39,000  \n\n2032 \n89,000  \n450,000  \n\n2012\u20132032 \n982,000  \n4,700,000  \n\nSources: Guangxi Environmental Protection Bureau and Guangxi Public Security Bureau. \n\n \n \n4. \nGuangxi  Province  adheres  to  national  vehicle  emission  control  strategies  including \n(i) enforcing  national  emission  standards  for  new  vehicles;  (ii)  improving  conventional  fuels; \n(iii) legislating  the  use  of  alternative  or  cleaner  fuels;  (iv)  increasing  vehicle  inspection  and \nmaintenance  programs;  and  (v)  using  the  national  regulated  requirement  for  the  retirement  of \nobsolete polluting vehicles. Table A8.2 provides an integrated plan developed to help agencies \nreduce vehicle emissions in Guangxi and the project area. \n \nVehicle  emission  enforcement  administration  for  operating  vehicles  requires  good \n5. \ncoordination  among  agencies:  Guangxi  Environmental  Protection  Bureau  and  Guangxi  Public \nSecurity  Bureau.  But  these  agencies  have  little  dialog  on  this  issue.  The  Project  will  catalyze \nsuch  cooperation.  The  two  bureaus  will  provide  checkpoints  for  vehicle  emissions  in \nstrategically planned locations. For example, two checkpoints will be established on the Tainlin\u2013\nLeye local road. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nTable A8.2: Strategic Vehicle Emission Reduction Plan: Targets and Expected Outputs \n\n \nProposed Action \n\n \nTarget \n1.

Most of the alignment is \nmountainous with altitudes of 100\u2013800 meters (m) and natural gradient of over 20 degrees. The \nexpressway will be a 177 kilometer (km), four-lane access-controlled tollway from Baise to the \nborder  with  Guizhou  province  in  Longlin  county,  which  is  one  of  the  high  priority  east\u2013west \ncorridors  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  The  expressway  connects  at  the  south  with  the \nNanning\u2013Baise Expressway and at the north with the planned Guizhou\u2013Kunming expressway in \nXingyi  city.  It  will  go  through  the  Youjiang  district  of  Baise,  Tianlin,  and  Longlin  counties.  The \nfollowing paragraphs describe the alternatives considered. \n \n2. \nDo-Nothing  Alternative.  The  do-nothing  option  would  require  traffic  to  use,  as  at \npresent, the existing road, national highway 324. This highway is already operating at close to \ncapacity  and  would  require  substantial  upgrading,  first  to  a  divided  class-II  standard  to  carry \nprojected normal growth traffic, and then by 2022 to class-I or expressway standard. Upgrading \nthe existing road would require significant realignment to provide adequate capacity and reduce \nroadside friction, especially in the northern section, and require the upgrading of many bridges \nand  tunnels.  The  tunnels  and  bridges  would  have  to  be  constructed  to  class-I  or  expressway \nstandard  initially  to  prevent  major  expensive  upgrading  later.  The  combined  cost  of  initial  and \nlater upgrading of the road could well approach the cost of the new expressway, while providing \nan  inferior  alignment  but  involving  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  decreased \nsafety, and less total capacity. For this reason, the do-nothing option is not recommended. \n \n3. \nRoad Class Analysis. The option of constructing a road of lower technical class instead \nof  the  project  expressway  was  considered  but  rejected  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  The  only \nroad  classes  with  the  capacity  to  carry  traffic  up  to  2022  are  four-lane  expressway  or  class-I \nhighway.  (ii)  The  major  difference  between  the  expressway  and  class-I  highway  according  to \nMinistry of Communications (MOC) design standard is that class-I highway may be only partly \nthe \naccess-controlled  whereas  an  expressway  must  be \nconstruction costs differ only in the number and  types of access control by overpass or grade \nseparation, which accounts for about 3%\u20135% of the total cost. (iii) Reducing access control and \ngrade separation reduces capacity and safety. \n \n4. \nRoad  Capacity  and  Service.  In  accordance  with  the  new  MOC  highway  design \nstandard,  the  road  capacity  for  design  speed  of  80  km/hour  is  25,000\u201345,000  passenger  car \nunits (pcu) per day, and for 100 km/hour 35,000\u201350,000 pcu per day under ideal conditions.1 As \nfor the capacity for the project expressway, the following adjustment factors need to taken into \nconsideration:  (i)  lane  width  and/or  lateral  clearance  restriction;  (ii)  the  presence  of  heavy \nvehicles  in  the  traffic  steam;  (iii)  the  development  environment  and  type  of  multilane  highway, \nand  (iv)  driver  population.  In  addition,  level  of  service  is  an  important  factor  as  it  has  a  close \nrelation with road capacity. Following the standard set by MOC, the expressway service should \nreach class II (equivalent to United States class C) at the end of the forecast year.  \n \n5. \nTwo design speeds were adopted taking into account the topographical and geological \ncondition and traffic volume for the main expressway, namely: 80 km/hour from Guizhou border \nkm 0 to km 114, and 100 km/hour for km 114 to km 177 (Baise). The traffic projection for the \nfirst section is 30,000 average annual daily traffic (AADT) passenger car units and for the latter \n\nfully  access-controlled.  Thus, \n\n                                                 \n1   Ideal conditions include: (i) level terrain, (ii) 3.75 m lane widths, (iii) a minimum of 0.75 lateral clearance between \n\nthe edge of travel lanes and obstructions at the roadside, (iv) 2.75 m hard road shoulder, (v) passenger cars only in \nthe traffic stream, and (vi) a divided highway cross section. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nsection  32,000;  both  are  within  the  range  of  class-II  to  class-III  service  under  different  design \nspeed at the end of the projection year (Table A9). \n \n\nTable A9: Road Capacity and Level of Service \n\nDesign Speed  \nLevel of Service \nV/C (MOC standard) \nMSF(MOC standard) \nSF \nAADT \n\n100 kilometers/hour \nLOS III \n0.86 \n1,800 \n2,802  \n40,325  \n\n     LOS IV \n1 \n2,100 \n3,268  \n49,522  \n\n       LOS II \n0.67 \n1,400 \n2,179  \n31,034  \n\n80 kilometers/hour \n\nLOS II \n0.6 \n1,200 \n1,868  \n26,601  \n\n      LOS III \n0.75 \n1,500 \n2,335  \n33,605  \n\n     LOS IV \n1 \n2,000 \n3,113 \n47,164 \n\nAADT=  annual  average  daily  traffic,  LOS  =  level  of  service,  MSF  =  maximum  service  flow  rate  (pcu/hour/lane),       \npcu = passenger car unit, SF = service flow rate under the prevailing roadway and traffic condition in pcu per hour, \nV/C = volume/capacity. \nSources: Guangxi Communications Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6. \nAlignment Alternatives. The recommended expressway alignments were selected after \nin-depth analysis of four schemes based on developing local economies, coordinating with the \nhighway network; avoiding areas with complex geological conditions; and minimizing social and \nenvironmental  impacts,  and  agriculture  land  acquisition.  The  technical  features  of  the  project \nexpressway are described in Box A9. \n \n\nBox A9: Technical Features of the Project Expressway \n\n \nTechnical  Standards.  Two  technical  standards  were  adopted  due  to  complex  topographic  and \ngeologic conditions along the route: (i) km 0 to km 114, the design speed is 80 km/hour and subgrade \nwidth 24.5 m; (ii) km 114 to km 177, the design speed is 100 km/hour and subgrade width 26 m. \n \nStructures.  The  expressway  includes  (i)  214  bridges  with  total  length  of  about  64  km  (36%  of  total \nlength); and (ii) 11 unidirectional, 4-lane tunnels with total length of about 7 km (4% of total length). \n \nPavement.  Asphalt  concrete  pavement  is  recommended  except  for  tunnels  and  toll  plazas  where \ncement concrete will be utilized, with an 18-centimeter (cm) asphalt surface, a 60 cm cement stabilized \nbase and subbase, and a 15 cm graded aggregate subgrade capping layer. This pavement thickness \nshould be adequate to withstand the high proportion of heavy vehicles in the traffic flow. \n \nInterchanges  and  Facilities.  The  expressway  has  10  interchanges  over  177  km;  spacing  is  a \nminimum  of  9  km  and  a  maximum  of  30  km;  four  service  areas  provide  facilities  for  refueling  and \nvehicle  repair;  restaurants;  three  rest  areas  for  parking  and  resting;  nine  toll  stations  at  interchange \nramps; and one mainline toll station at the border with Guizhou. Electrical and mechanical equipment \nfor tolling, traffic monitoring, and telecommunications will be installed. \n \nConnector  Roads.  The  Project  includes  the  improvement  of  seven  class-II  connecting  roads  with  a \ntotal length of 27 km. They will link the expressway interchanges to Longlin (22.1 km), Bianya (0.9 km), \nShali (1.5 km), Juizhou (0.8 km), Bantao (0.35 km), Xiatang (0.45 km), and Baise (0.65 km) thereby \nintegrating the expressway to major towns and local highway network. \n \nConstruction  Supervision.  A  joint  international-national  team  will  supervise  implementation. \nInternational  experts  will  assist  the  chief  supervision  officer  and  support  national  firms  in  managing, \nsupervising, and monitoring project contracts. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n43 \n\nLOCAL ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM \n\n \n1. \nObjective.  The  main  objective  of  the  Local  Road  Improvement  Program  is  to  help \nreduce  poverty  in  the  project  area  by  providing  and  improving  all-weather  access  to  the  rural \npopulation. Under this program, the Project will rehabilitate and upgrade 1,060 kilometers (km) \nof local roads in seven counties and Youjiang district of Baise. The program will result in lower \ntransport costs (for people and goods), and provide all-year access to the affected communities. \nFurthermore,  this  should  improve  access  of  rural  people  to  social  services  such  as  education \nand  health.  In  addition,  the  provision  of  such  access  will  increase  employment  opportunities, \nparticularly during construction and for ongoing maintenance. \n \n2. \nPoverty and Isolation. The program addresses the lack of basic access in remote and \npoor  counties  in  the  project  area.  Of  the  1,184  villages  in  the  project  area,  633  (54%)  are \ndesignated  as  poor,  and  592  (50%)  of  these  have  no  basic  road  access.  Various  surveys \nconducted  during  project  preparation  provide  evidence  that  poverty  is  more  pervasive  in \n\u201cunconnected\u201d areas, that is areas with no or unreliable motorized access. For example, in Leye \ncounty,  where  48%  of  the  residents  are  living  below  the  poverty  line,  65%  are  without  basic \naccess (Table A10.1). \n \n\nTable A10.1: Lack of Basic Road Access in the Project Area \n\nYoujiang  Tianyang \n\nJingxi  Lingyun  Leye  Tianlin  Longlin  Xilin  Total \n55 \n633 \n93  1,184 \n\n106 \n179 \n\n168 \n291 \n\n67 \n110 \n\n97 \n165 \n\n52 \n86 \n\nCounty \nPoverty Villages \nNumber of Villages \n% of Poverty Villages  \n(Average) \n% of Poverty \nIncidence (Average) \n% of Without Basic \nAccess (Average) \n\n \n\n38 \n108 \n\n35 \n\n20.0 \n\n29.0 \n\n50 \n152 \n\n33 \n\n58 \n\n61 \n\n60 \n\n59 \n\n59 \n\n59 \n\n20.0 \n\n22.0 \n\n41.0 \n\n48.0 \n\n42.0 \n\n27.0 \n\n55.0 \n\n53 \n\n34 \n\n51 \n\n \n\n70.0 \n\n57.0 \n\n24.0 \n\n65.0 \n\n61.0 \n\n56.0 \n\n47.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSources: Guangxi and Baise poverty alleviation and development offices, and Guangxi Communications Department. \n \n3. \nLocal  Road  Improvement  Program.  The  program  consists  of  three  subcomponents \n(Table  A10.2):  (i) border  road  improvement  for  trade  activities  to  finance  three  priority  border \nroad sections totaling 50 km, (ii) rural road improvement for network integration to finance three \npriority  rural  road  sections  totaling  260  km,  and  (iii)  village  road  improvement  for  poverty \nreduction to finance village access roads totaling 750 km. \n \n\nTable A10.2: Summary of the Local Road Improvement Program \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nNo. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n \n\n \n\n \nProject Name \nJingxi\u2013Longbanga \nNaxi\u2013Bordera \nYuexu\u2013Bordera \nNapo\u2013Dingyeb \nTianlin\u2013Leyeb \nDe\u2019e\u2013Shalib \nVillage Roadsc \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nCurrent \nRoad Class \nClass IV \nUnclassified \nUnclassified \nClass IV \nUnclassified \nUnclassified \nEarth track \n \n\n \n\nAfter Upgrading Road Class \n(km) \n\n \n  Subtotal \n\nClass \nIII \n\n \nCost \n(CNY \nIV  million) \n235.0 \n7.4 \n7.0 \n296.0 \n170.8 \n48.2 \n97.5 \n862.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n37 \n29 \n\n \n \n \n \n80 \n77 \n  750 \n66  907 \n\n \n \nCost  \n($ million) \n30.3 \n1.0 \n0.9 \n38.1 \n22.0 \n6.2 \n12.6 \n111.1 \n\n \nADB \nShare  \n($ million) \n11.7 \n0.8 \n0.7 \n4.8 \n5.7 \n1.9 \n3.0 \n28.60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n47 \n1.4 \n1.6 \n37 \n117 \n106 \n750 \n1,060 \n\n \n\nII \n47 \n1.4 \n1.6 \n37 \n \n \n \n87 \n\n \n\nkm = kilometer. \na  Border road improvement for trade activities \nb   Rural roads improvement for network integration. \nc  Village roads improvement for poverty reduction. \nSources: Guangxi Communications Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nIntegrated  Poverty  Reduction  Efforts.  Guangxi  has  gained  useful  experiences  under \n4. \nthe  recently  completed  Southwest  Poverty  Reduction  Project  financed  by  the  World  Bank.  It \nshows that the best means of assisting poor is to take an integrated approach to helping areas \nexperiencing severe poverty. ADB has been improving on previous interventions by introducing \na  participatory  approach  to  project  design,  and  addressing  a  range  of  problems  in  the  project \narea  by  working  in  collaboration  with  Guangxi  Poverty  Alleviation  and  Development  Office \nthroughout  design  and  implementation.  The  local  road  maximizes  the  benefits  of  the \nexpressway  component  of  the  Project,  i.e.,  to  provide  improved  links  to  the  expressway,  and \nhelps  maximize  the  beneficial  impact  of  the  Project  as  a  whole  on  people  in  poverty  in  the \nproject  area.  Thus,  the  two  components  of  the  Project\u2014expressway  and  local  roads\u2014act \ntogether to reduce poverty. The expressway reduces costs and improves access to the markets \nalong the corridor; the rural road improvements help spread the associated economic and social \nbenefits to the most remote and disadvantaged (Box A10). \n \n\nBox A10: Poverty Reduction Impacts of the Local Roads \n\n \nDe\u2019e\u2013Shali  Road  (106  km).  This  road  starts  from  the  Shali  expressway  interchange  and  retains  the  existing \nalignment  up  to  the  Xilin\u2013Longlin  border.  The  area  is  mainly  mountainous  with  elevations  ranging  from  700  to \n1,600 meters and road conditions are very poor. In Longlin, the road travels through five towns and serves over \n50  villages  with  a  population  of  more  than  100,000,  26%  of  whom  are  poor.  Guangxi  Poverty  Alleviation  and \nDevelopment Office  (GPAO) is assisting farmers to diversify into high-value produce such as tobacco. The main \nconcern of villagers is the road condition, the problems it causes for transporting crops, and its impact on higher \nprices  paid  for  agricultural  inputs.  In  Dalan  village,  where  the  main  crop  of  tobacco  must  be  transported  to  the \ntobacco company station at Longhuo, the road condition is too poor for truck transport so tractors, animal carts, or \nthe village minibus must be used to transport the crop. From 10 to 15 tractor loads equal one truck load. The road \nis too bad to transport pigs to market so they must be sold to an intermediary at a lower price. Road conditions \ncause  too  much  spoilage  to  exploit  surplus  fruit  and  vegetable  production.  The  improved  road  will  also  provide \nalternate  access  to  Xilin  and  Longlin  county  towns  and  surrounding  area,  thus  improving  the  overall  transport \nsystem.  \n \nTianlin\u2013Leye  Road  (117  km). In addition to connecting the two counties of Tianlin and Leye, the road provides \naccess to six towns and 64 villages. Tianlin has a population of over 240,000 of which 42% are poor. The ethnic \nminority population is 175,000, of which 45% are poor. Leye has a population of 157,000; the poverty rate is 48%, \nwith  11%  designated  as  absolute  poor.  Given  the  considerable  agricultural  activities  along  the  road,  local \nresidents depend on the road to move products from fields to distant towns. The road is very dusty in summer and \nimpassible in the rainy season because of the clay bound macadam pavement and poor drainage system. In its \npresent condition, the road results in unhealthy air quality as well as unsafe driving conditions due to the extreme \ndust, and landslide and mud conditions. Road accidents are frequent and serious (41 traffic accidents on this road \nsection  in  2005).  More  than  80%  of  Tianlin  county\u2019s  rice  is  grown  by  villages  in  this  area  and  GPAO  is \nencouraging  farmers  to  diversify  into  high-value  fruit  products  as  well  as  mulberries,  and  is  providing  intensive \ntraining for silkworm production. The area produces many high-value specialty items such as persimmons, prickly \nash, bamboo, oil seed, tea oil, chestnuts, and ginger along with other high quality vegetables. The improved road \nwill  (i)  reach  the  isolated  Leye  communities  that  are  quite  distant  from  the  main  road  network  and  where  road \nconditions  are  very  poor,  (ii)  reduce  traffic  accidents  along  the  road,  and  (iii)  eliminate  the  dust  that  plagues \nroadside communities for 6\u20137 months of the year. \n \nVillage  Access  Roads  (750  km).  The  Project  includes  upgrading  of  750  km  of  village  access  roads  to  poor \nnatural villages mainly in mountainous areas. In general, these villages are served only by rough tracks, which are \nusable only by foot and animal traffic, and so the current level of accessibility and mobility of villagers is very low. \nShortage of natural village access roads has made daily trips to school and health care facilities difficult. Access \nto  health  services  is  a  serious  concern.  In  Tianlin,  farmers  from  a  village  without  basic  roads  told  the  story  of \ncarrying a sick man for 3 days in an attempt to get him to hospital but he died along the route. The results of the \nsurveys show that poor people in the project area recognize isolation as a major contributor to their poverty and \nmarginalization. Providing village access roads is considered essential to promote rural development, to increase \nuptake of human development services (educational and health), to facilitate inclusion of different ethnic and other \ngroups, to improve employment opportunities, and to stimulate growth for poverty reduction. It will allow villagers \nmotorized transport access to markets, reducing costs and allowing changes to cropping patterns. Village access \nroads will integrate the targeted efforts by GPAO and adopt a more demand-driven approach: road sections will \nbe chosen in the course of project implementation.  \n \nSources: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n45 \n\nREGIONAL COOPERATION AND CROSS-BORDER TRADE \n\nOverview \n\n \nA. \n \nGuangxi\u2019s Trade with Viet Nam. Trade between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \n1. \nand Viet Nam increased from $8.2 billion in 2005 to $9.9 billion by 2006, i.e., 21%. The PRC is \nViet Nam\u2019s second-largest trading partner; excluding Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, \nit  accounted  for  12.6%  of  trade  in  2005.  Small-scale  border  trade  between  Viet  Nam  and \nGuangxi, within administrative districts on both sides and no more than 20 km from the border, \ngrew by 50% to $1 billion in 2006. Three provinces in Viet Nam\u2019s northeast region are adjacent \nto Guangxi\u2014Quang Ninh, Lang Son, and Cao Bang, with a population of 2.33 million in 2005\u2014\nare among the poorest in Viet Nam. Support for developing cross-border trade will contribute to \npro-poor economic growth in western Guangxi and northern Viet Nam. \n \n2. \nRegional  Cooperation.  Regional  cooperation  is  strongly  supported  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  2006  strategy  for  regional  economic  cooperation  and  integration,1 \nand  strategy  and  program  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  which  includes  goals  of \nfacilitating cross-border movements and tourism, and integrating markets to promote economic \nefficiency  and  private  sector  development.  The  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  cooperate  under  GMS \ninitiatives; Guangxi joined the GMS in 2004. The GMS strategic framework for action on trade \nfacilitation  and  investment  covers  four  key  activities:  customs  procedures,  inspection  and \nquarantine  measures,  trade  logistics,  and  mobility  of  people.  The  GMS  countries  are \nimplementing  provisions  of  the  Cross  Border  Transport  Agreement  to  simplify  and  harmonize \ncross-border transport procedures and promote integrated logistics. \n \n3. \nBorder Trading Ports. Four main crossings of Guangxi\u2019s 637 km border with Viet Nam \nare  at  Dongxing,  Pingxiang,  Shuikou,  and  Longbang,  all  national  class-I  land  ports  through \nwhich  international  transport  is  authorized.  In  addition,  there  are  seven  class-II  land  ports,  as \nwell  as  25  border  trade  markets.  Regional  trade  through  Youyiguan  will  benefit  from  the \nproject\u2019s  improved  expressway  connections  to/from  Yunnan,  Guizhou,  and  areas  further  west \nand north and associated facilities. Two of the others, Longbang (class I) and Yuexu (class-II), \nwill  benefit  from  upgraded  rural  roads  upgraded,  which  will  establish  good-quality  links  to  the \nproject  expressway  via  Jingxi,  Debao,  Tianyang,  and  Baise;  and  serve  border  trade  flows \nto/from  Guangxi,  Guizhou,  Yunnan,  and  beyond.  Passenger  services  to/from  Longbang  and \nYuexu will be improved by a program of bus stations and bus route reforms.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nAside from providing the missing link in the Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi transport corridor, \nthe Project includes components with strong GMS dimensions, i.e., (i) provision of facilities and \nequipment  to  meet  expected  demands  for  freight  transshipment  and  storage  at  the  Wantong \nLogistics  Center  in  Pingxiang  (para.  5),  (ii)  border  road  improvement  for  trade  activities \n(Box A11);  and  (iii)   bus  station  (para.  6)  and  pilot  bus  route  licensing  improvements \n(Appendix 6), which will improve the efficiency and quality of bus services. \n \n5. \nTrade Facilitation at Pingxiang. Discussions are under way between the governments \nof  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  to  expand  the  existing  bilateral  road  transport  agreement  on \nexchanges  of  traffic  rights  along  the  Nanning\u2013Hanoi  corridor.  Agreement  is  expected  by \n31 December 2007. The opening of the Wantong Logistics Center in October 2006 at Pingxiang \nprovided  a  major  impetus  to  cross-border  trade  along  the  Nanning\u2013Hanoi  corridor,  one  of  the \n\nProject Components \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nBox A11: Border Roads Improvement for Trade Activities \n\n \nJingxi-Longbang  Road.  Along  Jingxi  county\u2019s  152 km  border  with  Viet  Nam  are  Longbang  class-I  land  port; \nYuexu class-II port; and four border markets in Longbang, Yuexu,  Xinxing, and Mengma. The current poor and \nlow capacity of the existing Jingxi\u2013Longbang road cannot meet the demands of the increasing traffic, both local \nand cross-border. The road upgrading is to serve traffic using the land ports and border markets. It will integrate \nthe  transport  system  in  the  area  with  planned  development  of  the  land  port.  Improved  access  to  international \ntrade  at  Longbang  and  Yuexu  will  pass  on  the  benefits  of  reduced  travel  costs  on  the  expressway  to  poor \ncounties in the project area, simulate border trade, and create employment opportunities. \n \nNaxi (Longbang) Border Market  Access  Road. The road section near Longbang passes through Naxi village, \nthe site of Guangxi\u2019s only livestock border market, trading some 300 head of cattle, horses, goats, and pigs each \nday, mostly benefiting small-scale producers. Jingxi has plans to expand this facility, almost doubling its capacity. \nIn  addition,  some  1,000 small-scale  traders  cross  the  border  every  day,  trading  agricultural  produce,  utensils, \npoultry,  livestock,  fruit,  timber,  etc.  with  people  from  adjacent  Vietnamese  townships.  Jingxi  has  approval  for  a \nplan  to  develop  a  border  trade  street  at  the  Naxi  border,  to  provide  improved  facilities  for  traders  and  help \ngenerate  local  employment.  The  Project  is  expected  to  increase  annual  border  trade  by  CNY100  million,  raise \nCNY10 million per annum in taxes and tariffs, and increase local incomes by CNY5 million. Thus upgrading of this \nroad is crucial to local development. \n \nYuexu Border Access Road. The road is located at a class-II land port opposite Pobiao port in Viet Nam. Trade \nis  mostly  in  cement,  animal  feed,  manganese,  herbs,  and  foodstuffs.  An  estimated  50,000  people  cross  the \nborder each year, mostly small-scale traders exchanging agricultural goods, foodstuffs, and consumer products. \nThis  will  increase  substantially  when  the  planned  new  border  freight  station  is  constructed  and  the  Vietnamese \nfinish  upgrading  their  road  to  Trung  Khanh.  The  road  will  serve  small-scale  cross-border  traffic  and  the  new \ntransshipment facility to be constructed behind the present border post. \n\nkey  GMS  economic  corridors.  Two  project  preparation  surveys  were  carried  out  in  Youyiguan \nand  Longbang  in  September  2006  to  collect  concerns  and  suggestions  of  potential  users  of \nborder  trade  facilities.  Based  on  the  user  need  surveys,  a  list  of  trade  logistics  facilities  and \nequipment  was  selected  and  agreed  with  Guangxi  Communication  Department. 2  ADB  will \nfinance the total cost of equipment and transport information system estimated at $10 million. It \nwill facilitate efficient transshipment throughput at the Logistics Center, lowering handling costs \nand reducing transshipment delays for goods crossing the border. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6. \nBus  Stations.  To  facilitate  cross-border  trade,  the  Project  includes  two  class-II  bus \nstations at Longbang and Yuexu, which currently do not have formal bus stations. Buses stop at \nthe roadside, interrupting traffic and market activities and posing a safety risk. At Longbang, at \nthe end of the route, buses have difficulty turning for their return journey and have no off-street \nspace  to  wait  for  passengers.  The  proposed  location  of  Longbang  bus  station  is  close  to  the \ncenter  of  town,  near  the  existing  border  crossing  and  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations Free Trade Area (AFTA) being developed to handle export traffic. The proposed Yuexu \nbus  station  is  adjacent  to  Yuexu  town  center  and  will  be  integrated  with  a  major  freight \ntransshipment facility and border trade market. Experience in Guangxi has been that transport \nservices respond to road improvements, with bus operators taking advantage of better access \nto  areas  of  potential  demand.  This  is  expected  to  result  in  more  trade  and  investment,  better \ninformation on market opportunities, and higher incomes for the poor. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2   The Youyiguan survey (included both Chinese and Vietnamese) showed a significant demand for improved cargo-\nhandling  facilities  (72%),  truck  major  repairs  (54%),  and  warehousing  (50%).  Interest  in  parking  facilities  (46%), \nopen  storage  (41%),  and  temperature-controlled  storage  (21%)  was  high.  Equipment  with  higher  capacity  (35% \nover 15 tons, 55% over 20 tons) was preferred over those of less than 15 tons (10%). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47 \n\nRURAL ROAD MAINTENANCE POLICY REFORM \n\n \n1. \nExisting  Situation.  Adequate  and  timely  maintenance  is  important  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of rural roads. In Guangxi, county communication bureaus are responsible for rural \nroads maintenance, and the quality of rural roads is periodically monitored by city and provincial \nhighway administration bureau. In Baise, county roads in good condition account for 62% of the \ntotal county road network, and there is an urgent need to upgrade rural roads and improve the \nmaintenance.  Main  issues  associated  with  rural  road  maintenance  are:  (i)  poor  road  quality; \n(ii) insufficient  funding,  (iii)  inadequate  planning,  (iv) limited  implementation  capacity,  and \n(v) lack of market-oriented approach and framework.  \n \n2. \nRural  Road  Maintenance  Policy  Reform.  In  line  with  its  \"people  first\"  development \nstrategy and the desire to create a socially harmonious society, the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC)  Government  has  taken  several  actions.  In  2005,  the  PRC  State  Council  launched  the \nPolicy Reform for Rural Road Maintenance. In December 2006, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous \nRegional People\u2019s Government (GRG) issued a rural road maintenance reform, which is being \nintroduced  in  three  trial  cities  in  Guangxi  (Box  A12).  Experience  from  the  trial  cities  will  be \nreplicated in other areas.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEighty percent of the road maintenance fee collected from motorized vehicles by local governments after \ndeductions (such as collection costs, traffic police, and water conservancy construction fund) should be used \nfor road maintenance. \nBy 2010, 100% of the road maintenance fee collected from motorized vehicles by local governments after \ndeductions should be used for road maintenance. \nImpose a minimum level of funding for major road maintenance. \nThe allocation will not be lower than CNY7,000 per kilometer (km) per annum for county roads, CNY3,500 per \nkm per annum for township roads, and CNY1,000 per km per annum for village roads. \nImpose minimum funding for routine road maintenance. \nThe allocation will not be lower than CNY5,000 per km per annum for county roads, CNY2,500 per km per \nannum for township roads, and CNY1,000 per km per annum for village roads. \nIntroduce a market-oriented mechanism. \n\n \n\u2022  Demarcate responsibilities with county governments. \nCounty governments are the main administrators for rural road maintenance. \n \n \nLocal governments should manage the fund, and ensure proper maintenance of rural roads. \n\u2022  Stipulate a specific ratio of the road maintenance fee collected for road maintenance. \n\nBox A12: Guangxi Rural Road Maintenance Policy Reform \n\n\u2022 \n \n\n\u2022 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2022 \n \nSource: Guangxi Communication Department. \n\n \n \n \n3. \nImprove Rural Road Maintenance in Baise. To ensure the sustainability of the project, \nGCD agreed to implement the rural road maintenance policy reform in Baise. GCD will ensure a \nreasonable share (at least 80%) of the total revenue of the road maintenance fee is allocated for \nroad  maintenance  and  rehabilitation.  GCD  will  be  in  charge  of  (i)  operationalizing  rural  road \nmaintenance  funding  policy  reform;  (ii) developing  the  rural  road  information  system  and \neffectively  using  it  for  maintenance,  planning,  and  operations;  (iii)  adjusting  its  organization \nstructures  and  training  programs  to  devote  more  resources  to  rural  maintenance,  and \n(iv) increasing  competitive  and  market-based  procurement  of  maintenance  services  through \ncontractual schemes drawing on the capacity of private sector contractor.  \n \n4. \nRoad  Inventory  and  Condition  Databank.  GCD  conducted  a  regional  road  inventory \nand  condition  survey  in  2006  using  relevant  data  collection  requirements  developed  by  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nMinistry  of  Communications.  The  survey  identified  about  20,000  rural  unclassified  roads  in \nGuangxi.  All  of  the  data  and  information  will  be  inputted  in  the  road  condition  databank  being \ndeveloped  by  GCD.  At  present,  fund  allocation  for  prioritizing  maintenance  work  is  still  being \ndone manually, with emphasis given to national and provincial highways and other emergency \nneeds. GCD will design a maintenance cost and fund allocation model and integrate it with the \nroad condition databank. Rural road management and administration will be strengthened and \nregularly assessed by this model. \n \nRural  Road  Maintenance  Study.  ADB  held  an  in-depth  dialogue  during  project \n5. \npreparation  that  led  to  a  good  understanding  of  rural  road  maintenance  issues  and  of  how  to \naddress them. The Project will support GCD initiatives to implement policy reform by identifying \nand  test  market-based  mechanism  and  technologies  that  offer  possibilities  for  improving  the \nquality and efficiency of road maintenance. To achieve this objective, a rural road maintenance \nstudy will be conducted under the Project to develop an effective maintenance mechanism and \nregulations. Guangxi Highway Administration Bureau (GHAB) will be responsible for the study, \nwhich will be supported by $100,000 of the ADB loan. The study will review road maintenance \nissues in Guangxi and focus on the following areas (paras. 6\u20139). \n \n6. \nEffective  Maintenance  Mechanism. Surveys will be carried out to review current road \nmaintenance practice and identify needs for improvement based on international and domestic \nexperience.  The  review  will  focus  on  funding  and  its  source,  institutional  arrangement,  new \ntechnologies  in  maintenance,  maintenance  standards,  road  condition  survey  and  assessment, \nshort- and medium-term maintenance program, budgeting, and market-based procurement and \nactivities.  Based  on  the  output  of  the  review,  experiences  relating  to  market-based  effective \nmechanisms and new technologies will be analyzed and tested under the study. The study will \nprepare an action plan for wide-scale implementation of good practices and modalities. \n \n7. \nRural  Road  Maintenance  Handbook.  To  provide  practical  guidance  for  crew  leaders \nand workers, a rural road maintenance handbook will be developed. It will make use of current \navailable  handbooks  (both  international  and  domestic  practice)  and  maintenance  codes;  and \nincorporate  more  information  on  labor,  application  of  necessary  equipment,  appropriate  data \ncollection, treatment for various defects, and development of human resource management and \nsafety  at  work.  The  handbook  will  cover  the  maintenance  activities  for  paved  and  unpaved \nroads, road facilities and drainage, and environment and work zone safety issues. \n \n8. \nRoad Inventory and Condition Databank. The study will review the road inventory and \ncondition databank prepared by GCD to identify the current status and application situation. The \nreview  may  include  (i)  inventory  data;  (ii)  condition  data;  (iii)  data  collection  and  update; \n(iv) funding,  institution,  equipment,  and  staff  to  maintain  the  databank;  (v) function  and \napplication of the databank; and (vi) the function and attributes of the digital road network. The \nstudy will recommend improvements and actions plans to utilize the databank more effectively. \n \n9. \nRelevant  Training.  At  least  300  persons-months  of  training  and  dissemination  of \ninformation will be included in the study, which may include the use of the handbook, concept of \nlife-cycle cost, and the benefit of market-oriented implementation mechanism. The attendees of \ntraining  session  will  be  relevant  subnetwork  managers,  county  and  township  authorities,  crew \nleaders, local communities, and contractors. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES BY FINANCIER\n($ million)\n\nCost\n\nADB\n\nChina Bank of \nCommunications \n\n% of Cost \nCategoryb\n\n$a\n\n$\n\n% of Cost \nCategory\n\nGovernment \n\n% of Cost \nCategory\n\nItem   \n\nA.\n\nBase Cost c\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5\n6.\n\nEarthwork\nPavement\nStructures\nTunnels\nInterchanges\nBuildings and Facilities\n\nSubtotal Expressway Civil Works\n\nEnvironmental Protection \nEquipment d\nLand and Resettlement\n\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.

This  corridor  starts \nfrom  Shantou  in  Guangdong  province  goes  through  Liuzhou,  Hechi,  Baise,  and  Longlin  in \nGuangxi  province,  then  passes  through  Xingyi  in  Guizhou  province  before  heading  west  to \nKunming.  It  will  help  reduce  imbalanced  development  between  western  and  eastern  regions. \nThe Project is also one of the sections of the proposed Guangxi regional expressway network. \nConnected  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  Guangxi  Roads  Development  II \nProject  (Nanning\u2013Baise  expressway),  it  will  provide  the  shortest  route  to  seaports  and  the \nborder  between  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  Viet  Nam  for  inland  southwest \nprovinces in the PRC such as Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan. \n \n2. \nIn Guizhou, the expressway will connect the planned expressway from Banba (Guangxi \nborder)  to  Jiangdi  (126  kilometers  [km];  the  prefeasibility  study  was  already  approved  and \nconstruction will start in 2007; completion is targeted for 2012). In Yunnan, it will connect from \nJiangdi to Kunming, total 260 km (Kunming\u2013Yiliang\u2013Shilin opened to traffic in 2003, and Shilin\u2013\nZhaokua\u2013Jiangdi  opened  to  traffic  in  2006).  The  ADB-financed  Nanning  (Tanluo)\u2013Baise \nexpressway will be opened to traffic in 30 June 2008; the Nanning to Youyiguan and Youyiguan \nto  Hanoi  sections  are  functioning  well.  By  2012,  the  Kunming\u2013Nanning\u2013Hanoi  section  of  the \nGreater Mekong Subregion Corridor will be completed. \n \n3. \nThe project expressway will be built parallel to the existing national highway (NH) 324, a \nmajor  class-III  road.  The  pavement  condition  of  most  of  road  is  poor  due  to  the  many  heavy \nloaded trucks that travel its length. Much of the highway is in mountainous country and has tight \ncurves and steep grades resulting in low speeds and high safety risks. The estimated motorized \ntraffic in 2006 is about 3,854\u20138,369 passenger car units (pcu) per day by section. The current \ntraffic  may  reach  the  road\u2019s  designed  capacity  before  2012,  the  proposed  opening  year, \nthroughout most of its length. Compared with the existing NH324, the project expressway will be \napproximately 34 km shorter and offer a time savings of at least 3 hours. \n \n4. \nEstimated  traffic  on  the  project  road  is  based  on  routine  traffic  counts  and  the \ncomprehensive origin and destination surveys carried out in May 2004 (calibrated and updated \nduring October 2006 by project preparatory technical assistance consultants) at seven selected \nobservation stations on the NH324 and other roads under the feasibility study. A traffic demand \nmodel  was  made  on  the  basis  of  a  conventional  growth  model.  Traffic  demand  was  projected \nseparately for passenger and freight vehicles for 2012, 2022, and 2032 from the base year of \norigin and destination matrix and demand elasticities of 1.0 and 0.9. The average traffic growth \nrates  in  the  project  corridor  are  estimated  to  be  9%  per  year  during  2006\u20132012,  6%  per  year \nduring 2012\u20132022, and 5% per year during 2022\u20132032. \n \n5. \nThe  traffic  forecasts  allow  for  potential  generated  and  diverted  traffic  as  a  result  of \n(i)   additional  traffic  generated  by  the  Project  because  of  the  lower  cost  of  expressway  travel; \n(ii) traffic diverted to the rail network because of rail capacity enhancement and some low value \nbulk  freight  transport  (e.g.,  coal)  with  the  same  origin  and  destination  as  the  highway;  and \n(iii) potential  diverted  traffic  from  other  road  networks  as  a  result  of  the  increased  capacity \nprovided  by  the  expressway.  Generated  traffic  was  estimated  using  price  elasticities  of  minus \n0.3  for  passenger  traffic  and  minus  0.2  for  freight  traffic,  and  is  anticipated  to  be  11.2%  of \nnormal  passenger  traffic  and  9.1%  of  normal  freight  traffic.  The  traffic  projection  also  takes \naccount of nonmodeled local intrazone traffic on the road network. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n55 \n\nTraffic was assigned between every pair of traffic zones. Vehicles moving from one zone \n6. \nto another make a choice of link paths based on their perceptions of generalized travel costs, a \nfunction of travel time, distance, and associated toll cost, affected by road conditions and traffic \ncongestion.  The  diverted  traffic  from  existing  roads  was  calculated  using  ADB\u2019s  toll  diversion \nmodel. The results of the analysis indicate that an average of 53% of vehicles may be diverted \nto  the  expressway  in  2012.  The  traffic  diversion  rate  is  expected  to  increase  to  88%  by  2022 \nand stabilize thereafter. \n \nRamp-up  has  been  a  factor  on  several  expressways  opened  recently.  Ramp-up  is  the \n7. \npropensity for some traffic not to immediately transfer from the existing road to the expressway. \nIt often takes a few years for the full potential of expressway traffic to be realized. To estimate \nthis effect, the assumptions, based on the data for the Liuzhou\u2013Yizhou expressway, were made \nas follow: 60%, 75%, and 90% of the expected flow for 2012, 2013, and 2014. \n \n8. \nThe  resulting  traffic  projection,  by  sections,  is  summarized  in  Table  A17.  The  forecast \ntraffic volume on the expressway is expected to grow from an average of 6,330 pcu in 2012 to \nan  average  of  18,800  pcu  in  2022,  an  11.5%  average  annual  growth  rate.  It  will  then  grow \nslowly at 5% per annum thereafter to reach an average of 30,500 pcu in 2032. \n \n\nTable A17: Average Annual Daily Traffic on Project Expressway by Sections \n(passenger car unit) \n\nJiuzhou\u2013\nLuchen \n\nLuchen\u2013\nTianlin \n\nYongle\n\u2013Baise \n\nBaise\u2013\nSitang \n\nWeighted \nAverage \n\n \n\nYear \n\nBorder\n\u2013Weile \n\nWeile\u2013\nJiuzhou \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3,854 \n6,509 \n11,799 \n19,148 \n\n5,587 \n9,486 \n17,291 \n28,061 \n \n\n \nA.

The  project  expressway  will  shorten \n\n \n1. \nGeneral. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project, as the indicator of \neconomic  analysis,  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  situation  with  and  without  the  Project. \nWithout the Project, traffic will continue to use the existing road network, national highway (NH) \n324,  which  will  be  more  congested  and  expensive  to  maintain  due  to  rapidly  increasing  traffic \nvolume, causing delays and resulting in increased travel time, vehicle operating cost (VOC and \nroad accidents. With the Project, traffic will benefit from faster, cheaper, and safer travel due to \nrapid reduction of congestion along the corridor. Some additional trips will be generated as the \neconomy  responds  to  lower  transport  costs  and  better  services.  Some  traffic  will  be  diverted \nfrom other road networks in the corridor. \n \nAssumptions.  The  economic  analysis  incorporates  5  years  of  implementation  and \n2. \n20 years  of  operation.  Economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  2007  prices,  expressed  in \nCNY  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.013  for \nforeign  exchange  effects.  Unskilled  labor  is  valued  using  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of \n0.7 considering the low productivity and unemployment in the area. The economic costs of the \nexpressway  include  (i)  the  capital  costs,  including  physical  contingency,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  costs;  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) for the expressway, including the costs of replacing depreciated equipment \nand  periodic  maintenance.  The  economic  benefits  include  (i)  savings  in  VOC  resulting  from \nreduced  travel  distance  and  improved  road  conditions;  (ii)  savings  in  the  value  of  passenger \ntime  tied  up  in  transit;  (iii) savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents;  (iv)  benefits  to  generated \ntraffic; and (v) savings in capital and O&M costs for NH324. \n \n3. \nthe  route  by \n34 kilometers (km). The calculations of VOC savings allow for differences in roughness, terrain, \nspeed,  and  congestion;  and  also  for  a  changing  vehicle  mix  for  both  passenger  and  freight \nvehicles, and improvements in vehicle performance. The typical economic VOCs are shown in \nTable A18.1. Travel time savings are valued for passengers in vehicles only, as the time of crew \nmembers  is  valued  in  the  VOC.  They  are  valued  at  25%\u201375%  of  the  average  wage  of \npassengers on the project expressway. The values used per person-hour are CNY5.47 for car \npassengers and CNY1.04 for bus passengers. The economic costs of accidents are estimated \nin terms of direct property damage and forgone income on the basis of national data for 2005. \nThe  average  economic  cost  of  an  accident  is  estimated  at  CNY108,800  on  expressways, \nCNY93,000  on  class-II  roads,  and  CNY70,000  on  class-III  roads.  The  benefits  of  generated \ntraffic are estimated at half the VOC and time savings of normal traffic as a proxy for willingness \nto pay. In addition, savings in capital and O&M costs for NH324 are calculated on the basis of \nmaintaining a volume-to-capacity ratio of 1.0 without the Project. The EIRR for the expressway \ncomponent is estimated at 17.1%, indicating that the Project is economically viable, with a net \npresent value of CNY4,206 million. \n \n4. \nRural Road Component. The rural roads for upgrading under the Project were chosen \nbased  on  the  effect  on  overall  road  network  efficiency  and  benefit-cost  analysis,  economic \ndevelopment  potential,  and  population  density.  The  rural  road  costs  include  capital  costs  and \nO&M  costs.  The  principal  benefits  of  the  local  road  improvement  are  identified  as  (i)  VOC \nsavings (Table A18.1), (ii) benefits to generated traffic, and (iii) savings in O&M costs. The rural \nroads have a combined EIRR of 21.7% per annum with net present value of CNY504.3 million. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n57 \n\nTable A18.1: Estimated Economic Vehicle Operating Cost, 2012 \n(CNY per km, 2006 prices) \n\nVehicle \nCar \nMedium-Sized Bus \nSmall Truck \nMedium-Sized Truck \nHeavy Truck \nArticulated Truck \n\nExisting Road \n1.45 \n2.34 \n1.63 \n2.40 \n2.49 \n3.39 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Guangxi Communications Department staff. \n\nExpressway \n1.26 \n2.01 \n1.29 \n1.83 \n2.06 \n2.74 \n\n \n5. \nRural Transport Service Component. The combination of rural bus stations and route \nlicensing changes will benefit passengers through (i) time savings resulting from more frequent \nand  reliable  services  and  quicker  bus  turnaround  at  terminals,  (ii)  lower  fares  reflecting \noperators\u2019  cost  savings,  (iii)  reduced  safety  risk,  (iv)  improved  amenities  at  terminals,  and \n(v) increased  travel  in  response  to  lower  transport  costs  and  travel  times.  Bus  operators  will \nbenefit  by  lower  unit  VOC  with  higher  productivity  and  fleet  savings  resulting  from  the  same \ndemand being met by fewer buses. For a typical station and associated routes, bus turnaround \ntimes  and  average  passenger  waiting  times  at  terminals  are  estimated  to  fall  by  70%,  the \nnumber of buses to decrease by a third, bus utilization (km/day) to increase by 75%, average \nheadways and passenger waiting times at the roadside to fall 14%, time per passenger round \ntrip to decrease by 30%, and unit bus operating costs to decrease by 18%. For the typical rural \nterminal costing CNY0.5 million, the EIRR is as high as 29.2%. Passenger time savings account \nfor  37%  of  discounted  benefits,  operators\u2019  savings  due  to  a  smaller  fleet  20%,  and  direct \nsavings in VOC 44 %; benefits to generated traffic are negligible. \n \nThe  Whole  Project.  The  Project  as  a  whole  generates  an  estimated  EIRR  of  17.5% \n6. \n(Table A18.2). The EIRR is 17.1% for the expressway, 21.7% for the rural roads, and 29.2% for \nbus  stations.  The  VOC  savings  from  the  expressway  are  the  major  economic  benefit  (75%) \nfollowed by passenger time savings (8%). Avoided accident costs, savings to generated traffic, \nand other benefits are all relatively small. The benefits of the rural roads and bus stations, while \nimportant to the communities concerned, account for 10.3% of the total benefits. The results of \nsensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability (Table A18.3). The \ncapital cost would have to be 76% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall to the cutoff rate of \n12%. Considering the experience of ADB in the People\u2019s Republic of China, such an increase in \ncapital cost is unlikely. A distribution analysis was conducted to determine the project effects for \nvarious beneficiaries, including road users, labor, and government.

The toll charges are assumed \nto  increase  once  every  5  years  to  keep  up  with  inflation.  Under  the  current  Guangxi  \u201cgreen \npassage\u201d regulations, to reduce the burden for the poor, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural \nproduce  or  livestock  are  exempted  from  tolls.  Local  communities  benefit  from  the  exemption. \nTen percent of such vehicles are assumed to be exempted from tolls. Other income (from fuel \nsales, rental income) amounts to 3% of toll revenue. \n \n\nTable A19.1: Base Year Tolls at 2007 Prices (CNY per vehicle-km) \n\nA \n\nVehicle Class \nPassenger vehicles  \u22647 seats  8\u201319 seats  20\u201339 seats  \u2014 \nGoods vehicles \nToll rate in CNY \n\n5\u201310 tons \n\n2\u20135 tons \n\n\u22642 tons \n\nC \n\nB \n\nD1 \n\nD2 \n\nE \n\n\u2265 40 seats  \u2014 \n\n10\u201315 tons, TEU  \u2014 \n\n>15 ton, 2 TEU \n\n1.6 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.44 \n\n1.68 \n\n0.40 \n\n0.8 \nTEU = twenty-foot equivalent unit containers, 2 TEU = 40-foot containers. \nSources: Guangxi Communication Department and Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n3. \nAnnual  incremental  O&M  costs  are  calculated based  on  the  following estimates:  (i)  toll \noperation  cost  totaling  CNY8.53  million  in  2012  (320 employees  and  other  administration \nexpenses);  (ii) routine  maintenance  costs  at  CNY200,000/kilometer  (km)  per  annum  in  2007 \nprices  to  increase  in  line  with  traffic  flows  using  an  elasticity  of  0.1;  (iii) tunnel  O&M  costs  at \nCNY5.3 million in 2012 using 2007 prices; and (iv) periodic maintenance cost required in 2022 \nat  a  cost  of  CNY1.5  million/km  in  2007  prices.  All  incremental  O&M  costs  are  projected  to \nincrease annually in line with domestic inflation rates. \n \n4. \nThe project funding is based on 46% equity or grants, 54% long-term loans. The China \nBank of Communications loan will be repayable over 25 years, including a 5-year grace period. \nThe  terms  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  are  assumed  as  25-year  maturity, \nincluding  a  5-year  grace  period,  US  dollar  London  interbank  offered  rate,  with  a  0.35% \ncommitment  fee.  Applicable  business  taxes  at  a  rate  of  5.6%  are  charged  on  revenue. \nCorporate  income  tax  at  33%  is  paid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes,  depreciation \nand  interest  charges,  operating  expenses,  and  any  prior  year  losses  carried  forward.  Despite \nthe  low  profitability,  the  forecast  revenue  under  the  base  assumptions  is  sufficient  to  cover \nannual recurrent costs, depreciation, and debt repayments from the expressway operation from \nthe sixth year of full operation. Projected financial statements are in Table A19.2. \n \n5. \nBased on this projection, the project expressway could achieve (i) a debt-equity ratio of \nnot more than 65:35; (ii) a working ratio (annual O&M cost, but excluding periodic maintenance \ncost, to revenue) of not more than 15%; and (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than \n1.2 from the sixth year of its full operation. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe  major  assumptions  used  for  calculating  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR) \nare (i) all calculations are made in 2007 prices, covering 2007 to 2031; (ii) capital costs include \nall  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  the  construction  and  equipment  for  the \nexpressway,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  O&M  costs \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 19 \n\nfor  domestic  and \n\ninternational  average \n\ninclude  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but  exclude \ndepreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from tolls used in financial \nprojections are adjusted to 2007 prices; and (v) the residual value equal to undepreciated value \nof capital investment is included as a benefit of the FIRR calculation. \n \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  after-tax,  in  real  terms  was  calculated \n7. \nusing  an  estimated  capital  mix  and  cost  of  funds.  Costs  are  considered  as  follows:  (i)  the \napplicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is used for ADB \ndebt, (ii) the estimated interest costs of 6.16% per annum are used for domestic loan funds, and \n(iii) cost of equity is assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted to reflect the impact of \nincome tax of 33%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost of debt by applying \ndomestic  and \nforeign  currency \ninflation  rates \ndenominated  debt,  respectively.  The  FIRR  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  is  4.5%.  This \ncompares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  at  an  after-tax \nbasis, of 3.3% (Table A19.3). The Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \nThe  sensitivity  of  the  project's  financial  indicators  to  cost  and  revenue  variations  is  shown  in \nTable A19.4. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  toll  rate  needs  to  satisfy  two  criteria:  (i)  generates  enough  revenue  to  obtain  a \nhigher  financial  return  on  investment,  and  (ii)  does  not  deter  potential  users  and  compromise \neconomic  objectives.  These  criteria  can  be  contradictory.  The  analysis  for  this  Project  shows \nthat  the  overall  average  revenue  from  tolls  will  be  about  CNY0.70  per  passenger  car  unit \n(pcu)/km in 2012, which should generate sufficient funds to service the loan while at the same \ntime involving little sacrifice of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The sensitivity test for \nthe  toll  rate,  taking  into  account  traffic  elasticity  to  tolls,  shows  that  even  at  a  toll  of \nCNY0.88/pcu/km  the  FIRR  would  reach  4.7%  but  the  EIRR  would  remain  in  an  acceptable \nrange  (16%).  Beyond  the  toll  rate  of  CNY0.88/pcu/km,  the  EIRR  would  fall  rapidly  while  the \nFIRR  levels  off.  Beyond  the  toll  rate  of  CNY1.05/pcu/km,  both  the  EIRR  and  FIRR  fall  rapidly \n(Figure A19). \n \n\nImpact of Toll Rate \n\n \n\nFigure A19: Sensitivity of EIRR, FIRR, WACC, to the Toll Rate\n\nC\nC\nA\nW\nd\nn\na\n \n,\n\n \n\nR\nR\nF\n\nI\n\n \n,\n\nR\nR\nE\n\nI\n\n20.0%\n\n18.0%\n\n16.0%\n\n14.0%\n\n12.0%\n\n10.0%\n\n8.0%\n\n6.0%\n\n4.0%\n\n2.0%\n\n0.0%\n\nEIRR\nFIRR Post Business Tax\nFIRR Post All Tax\nWACC\n\n0.35\n\n0.53\n\n0.70\n\n0.88\n\n1.05\n\n1.23\n\n1.40\n\nToll Rate (CNY/pcu-km)\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A19.2: Projected Financial Statements \n(CNY million) \n\nIncome Statement \n  Toll revenue \n  Nontoll revenue \n \n\nInterest income on cash \nbalances \n\n  Less: Taxes on turnover \nTotal revenue \nTotal operating expenses \n  Depreciation charge \n \n\nInterest charges: long- \nterm debt \nInterest charges: short -\nterm debt \n\n \n\n  Corporate income \n\n(profit) tax \n\nPosttax operating \nprofit/(loss) \n\n  2019 \n \n\n   2020 \n \n\n    2007 \n \n\n   2008 \n \n\n   2009 \n \n\n   2010 \n \n\n    2011 \n \n\n    2012 \n \n\n     2013 \n \n\n     2014 \n \n\n   2018 \n \n809.9 \n27.0 \n \n0.3 \n46.9 \n790.4 \n67.9 \n316.7 \n \n307.5 \n \n84.4 \n \n0.0 \n \n13.9 \n \n \n42.5 \n\n  2017 \n \n706.6 \n23.6 \n \n0.3 \n40.9 \n689.6 \n58.0 \n316.7 \n \n324.8 \n \n81.0 \n \n0.0 \n \n(91.0) \n \n \n17.0 \n\n   2015 \n \n446.9 \n14.9 \n \n0.2 \n25.9 \n436.2 \n46.4 \n316.7 \n \n356.4 \n \n54.3 \n \n0.0 \n \n(337.7) \n \n \n13.0 \n\n  2016 \n \n513.2 \n17.1 \n \n0.3 \n29.7 \n500.9 \n52.0 \n316.7 \n \n341.1 \n \n68.8 \n \n0.0 \n \n(277.8) \n \n \n14.5 \n\n30.9 \n \n0.8 \n53.7 \n\n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n \n0.0 \n\n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n \n0.0 \n\n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n \n0.0 \n\n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n \n0.0 \n\n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n0 \n \n \n2.6 \n\n78.5 \n316.7 \n \n289.2 \n \n84.4 \n \n0.0 \n \n137.6 \n \n \n173.5 \n\n221.3 \n7.4 \n \n0.1 \n12.8 \n215.9 \n10.4 \n316.7 \n \n397.5 \n \n0.1 \n \n0.0 \n \n(508.9) \n \n \n2.8 \n\n338.8 \n11.3 \n \n0.1 \n19.6 \n330.6 \n11.1 \n316.7 \n \n384.6 \n \n21.3 \n \n0.0 \n \n(403.2) \n \n \n10.3 \n\n389.1 \n13.0 \n \n0.2 \n22.5 \n379.8 \n41.1 \n316.7 \n \n370.9 \n \n38.0 \n \n0.0 \n \n(387.1) \n \n \n11.6 \n\n928.4  1,064.1 \n35.5 \n \n3.5 \n61.6 \n906.4  1,041.5 \n89.9 \n316.7 \n \n269.8 \n \n84.4 \n \n0.0 \n \n280.7 \n \n \n428.3 \n1,101.4  3,096.8  5,613.3  8,418.0  11,079.9  10,763.2  10,446.4  10,129.7  9,812.9  9,496.2  9,179.4  8,862.7  8,546.0  8,229.2 \n1,101.4  3,096.8  5,613.3  8,418.0  11,082.5  10,766.0  10,456.7  10,141.3  9,825.9  9,510.7  9,196.4  8,905.2  8,719.5  8,657.5 \n \n \n1,047.2  1,326.4  1,561.1  1,626.3  1,626.9  1,627.5  1,628.3 \n733.2 \n5,909.3  5,652.5  5,380.4  5,091.9  4,786.2  4,462.1  4,118.7  \n6,151.7 \n3,184.8  2,847.0  2,569.3  2,478.3  2,492.2  2,629.8  2,910.5 \n3,571.8 \n \n10,456.7 \n \n \n320.0  \n322.0  \n \n \n \n0.0 \n634.5 \n0.0 \n634.5 \n10.3 \n \n0.5 \n59 \n3 \n\n \n410.6 \n6,380.3 \n3,975.1 \n \n10,766.0 \n \n \n206.7 \n406.9 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n613.4 \n0.0 \n613.4 \n2.8 \n \n0.3 \n59 \n5 \n\n \n2.6 \n6,596.0 \n4,483.9 \n \n11,082.5 \n \n \n0.0 \n2,664.5 \n \n \n \n2,661.9 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n2,661.9 \n2.6 \n \n\n \n10,141.3 \n \n \n339.2 \n313.4 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n651.3 \n0.0 \n651.3 \n11.6 \n \n0.6 \n58 \n11 \n\n  \n8,657.5 \n \n \n952.4  \n0.0  \n \n \n \n0.0 \n697.6 \n0.0 \n697.6 \n 428.3 \n \n1.6 \n48 \n9 \n\n \n8,719.5 \n \n \n828.6 \n0.0 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n697.6 \n0.0 \n697.6 \n173.5 \n \n1.4 \n51 \n9 \n\n \n8,905.2 \n \n \n723.1 \n0.0 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n697.6 \n0.0 \n697.6 \n42.5 \n \n1.2 \n54 \n9 \n\n \n9,196.4 \n \n \n632. \n64.2 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n694.3 \n0.0 \n694.3 \n17.0 \n \n1.0 \n55 \n8 \n\n \n9,510.7 \n \n \n449.3 \n234.3 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n682.1 \n0.0 \n682.1 \n14.5 \n \n0.7 \n57 \n10 \n\n \n9,825.9 \n \n \n390.1 \n278.9 \n \n \n \n0.0 \n667.6 \n0.0 \n667.6 \n13.0 \n \n0.6 \n58 \n11 \n\n \n \n \n2,516.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n \n \n \n1,995.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n \n \n \n1,101.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n \n1,101.4 \n \n \n0.0  \n\n \n3,096.8 \n \n \n0.0  \n\n \n5,613.3 \n \n \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n \n\u2014 \n65 \n\u2014 \n\n0.0 \n \n\u2014 \n65 \n\u2014 \n\n\u2014\n63 \n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n61 \n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n60 \n\u2014\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB.

The trend is expected to continue during the 11th Five-Year Program. \n \n\nTable A19.6: Funding for Road Maintenance in Guangxi, 2001\u20132005 \n     2004 \n59,111.0 \n2.3 \n1,398.2 \n\n     2003 \n57,807.0 \n3.9 \n1,253.8 \n\n     2000 \n52,910.0 \n \n782.6 \n\n54,752.0 \n3.5 \n1,057.4 \n\n55,653.0 \n1.6 \n1,186.2 \n\n      2002 \n\n      2001 \n\n    2005 \n61,404.0 \n3.9 \n1,700.0 \n\n \n \n608.8 \n \n78.0 \n11.5 \n\n  \n\n35.0 \n \n655.6 \n8.0 \n62.0 \n12.0 \n\n \n4.0 \n\n12.0 \n \n753.3 \n15.0 \n64.0 \n13.5 \n\n \n13.0 \n\n6.0 \n \n929.0 \n23.0 \n74.0 \n16.1 \n\n \n19.0 \n\n12.0 \n \n1,138.4 \n23.0 \n81.0 \n19.3 \n\n \n20.0 \n\n22.0 \n \n1,190.3 \n5.0 \n70.0 \n19.4 \n\n \n1.0 \n\nkm = kilometer. \nSources: Guangxi Communications Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n.\n\n(CNY million) \n\nIndicator \n1.

Using  the  international  poverty  line  of \n$1/day  consumption  poverty  line,  the  country  still  has  about  135  million  poor.  The  PRC\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Program \nplaces  a  strong  emphasis  on  rural  development  with  a  pledge  to  increase  farmers\u2019  incomes  and  enhance  public \nservices in the countryside. \n \nThe  country  program  and  strategy  update  for  the  PRC  (2007\u20132008)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  seeks  to \npromote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty through transport sector in ADB operations in the PRC. This \nProject directly contributes to these objectives by improving road transport efficiency and improving the access of rural \nvillages to income-generating opportunities and social services. More poor villages will have improved connectivity as a \nresult of expressway, rural road, and transport service improvements, which will help create the conditions necessary \nfor developing local resources and generating employment to raise living standards. \n \nThe ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and program update for the Greater Mekong Subregion (2007\u20132009) support \nharmonizing cross-border trade and improving transport infrastructure. The Project will directly contribute through road \nimprovements  and  bus  stations  near  the  border  with  Viet  Nam.  This  will  promote  regional  cooperation  by  improving \ncross-border trade, transport services, and livelihoods of the poor living in the border area.  \n \nThe  Project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy,  which  focuses  on  aligning  ADB  operations  with  a \ncountry\u2019s  own  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  fostering  of  partnerships.  Accordingly,  the  project\u2019s  social  and  poverty \ninterventions were prepared in the context of Guangxi\u2019s poverty reduction and development plans. \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe project area covers one district and seven counties. It has a population of 2.3 million  with a poverty rate of 30% \nand 7% of residents live in absolute poverty. Ethnic minorities comprise 80% of the population; 36% are poor. The road \nimprovements  will  lead  to  lower  transport  costs,  improved  transport  services,  improved  access  to  markets  and  social \nservices,  increased  competitiveness,  expansion  of  economic  opportunities,  diversification  of  rural  livelihoods,  and \npoverty reduction. Farmers will benefit from reduced transport costs, better access to markets, increased opportunities \nfor  diversification,  and  increased  competition  for  their  products  leading  to  increased  incomes.  This  will  promote \ndiversification and significantly enhance the impact of local development programs on farmer\u2019s incomes and community \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  increase  economic  development  in  the  area  and  the  growth  of  off-farm  income \nopportunities including jobs during implementation. The rural transport services improvements will help establish better \ntransport  services  providing  improved  efficiency  and  affordability,  thereby  increasing  services  to  poor  villages.  The \nimproved rural transport network will provide better access to jobs, markets, health care, schools, and other services; \nand  will  increase  the  range  of  goods  and  services  available  in  the  community.  The  Project  will  also  facilitate  cross-\nborder trade, much of which is undertaken by small-scale traders, many of who are women. The improved roads and \nmore open border between the PRC and Viet Nam will also help to boost tourism development. \n \nC. \nParticipation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nProject surveys and community participatory consultations were carried out in preparing the poverty and social strategy \nwith  priority  given  to  rural  areas,  especially  poverty-stricken  villages  and  ethnic  minority  villages.  This  provided  an \nunderstanding of the concerns and constraints facing farmers and gave villagers the opportunity to express transport-\nrelated concerns and opinions of both positive and negative impacts arising from the Project. In total, 979 households in \nthe  project  area  were  surveyed.  According  to  local  residents,  the  greatest  benefits  will  be  increased  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  area  resulting  in  increased  income  sources  and  more  job  opportunities.  Farmers  had  a  keen \nunderstanding of the direct link between transport costs and farm profit margins and expected lower freight costs and \nimproved access to benefit them directly.  People also placed a good degree of  emphasis on a cleaner environment  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n  Yes  \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 20 \n\n65 \n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\nwith less dust and easier and faster transport. Residents also stated improved roads  would provide better access for \nchildren traveling to schools and improve road safety.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe  resettlement  plans  and  the  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  include  plans  for  consultation  and \nparticipation  during  implementation.  For  example,  before  the  alignment  was  finalized,  local  government  officials  and \nvillagers  will  be  consulted  to  minimize  losses  of  high-quality  arable  land  and  structures.  Township  governments  and \ncommunity organizations will be directly involved in the implementation of the resettlement plans and EMDP. \n \nD. \nGender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nRural women participate actively in agricultural production in the project area; this, together with child care, care of the \nelderly,  animal  care,  and  household  chores,  results  in  heavy  workloads  for  women.  Local  programs  to  improve  rural \nhousehold living conditions, such as biogas systems and sanitation and drinking water facilities, have brought benefits \nto women, particularly to poor women in mountain communities. Nevertheless, female illiteracy is considerably higher \nthan male illiteracy and women\u2019s health situation, especially in mountain communities, is poor. \n \nThe Project will benefit women significantly and not have an adverse impact on women or children. They will benefit \nfrom  easier  transport,  time  savings,  and  improved  access  to  medical  facilities  and  other  social  facilities;  and  from  a \ngeneral improvement in the quality of life. Women will benefit from greater access to information, jobs, and increased \nopportunities for selling and buying goods at markets. The participation strategy will give priority to women for benefits \nand protection against social risk; special gender measures are included in the EMDP and resettlement plans. Gender \ndisaggregated indicators will be monitored by the project performance management system. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\nResettlement plans were formulated for the expressway and local \nroad components that will ensure adequate compensation for \naffected people.

Social  risks  arising \nfrom  the  Project  were  identified  and  mitigating  measures  are \nrequired  under  the  loan  agreement.  An  EMDP  was  prepared \ncontaining  adequate  provisions  for  special  mitigation  measures  as \nwell as measures to enhance project benefits. \nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  measures  for  the  control  of  HIV/AIDS \nand other transmissible diseases are undertaken as specified in the \nEMDP  and  contract  documents.  These  measures  will  include \nawareness,  screening,  and  treatment  for  the  control  of  HIV/AIDS, \nsexually \ntyphoid; \nencephalitis; malaria; and tuberculosis during construction activities \namong  construction  workers  and  the  local  population.

A  resettlement  policy  framework  and  procedural \nguidelines  address  the  750 km  of  village  roads  and  50  township  bus  stations.  The  location  of \ntowns where bus stations will be built is known, but sites have not yet been decided. The village \nroads  will  be  selected  during  implementation.  Prior  to  commencement  of  land  acquisition  and \nhouse  demolition,  Guangxi  Communications  Department  (GCD)  will  update  all  resettlement \nplans  based  on  a  detailed  measurement  survey  and  submit  them  to  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) for approval.  \n \nThe  proposed  expressway  and  its  connector  roads  will  affect  10  townships  and \n2. \n35 administrative  villages  in  Longlin  and  Tianlin  counties,  and  Youjiang  district  of  Baise.  The \npreliminary  design  estimates  that  1,475  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  acquired,  of  which  about \n38% is farmland (comprising 12.6% paddy fields, 13.3% dry land, and 12.1% orchards), 42.5% \nforestland, 13% wasteland, and 6.5% other. Based on the standard of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) for impact assessment, the equivalent of 3,990 residents would lose all their land \nand agricultural livelihoods. Since the expressway will actually cross many parcels of scattered \nfarmland, the average loss of land per household is estimated at 20%, which means 19,950  will \nbe  partially  affected.  Another  245  ha  of  land  is  estimated  to  be  occupied  temporarily  during \nconstruction.  Also,  140,400  square  meters  (m2)  of  houses  will  be  demolished,  necessitating \nrelocation  of  1,390  rural  households  involving  4,000  people.  The  six  local  roads  will  require \n283 ha of land, which partially affects 10,200 people; 178 households will be relocated. \n \n3. \nThe resettlement objective is to ensure equal or better income and living standards, so it \nwill be implemented in accordance with the PRC Land Administration Law (2004), State Council \nDocument  No. 28, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement  Policy (1995). GCD agreed that (i) for \nthe  expressway,  Guangxi  Communications  Infrastructure  Administration  Bureau  will  apply  the \nnational standard for land compensation, which requires a minimum of 16 times annual average \noutput value; (ii) for the three local roads, Guangxi Highway Administration Bureau will apply the \nland  compensation  standards  based  on  Document  No.  39  issued  by  Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous Regional People\u2019s Government; and (iii) for the village roads, the ownership of the \nroads  and  lands  will  be  retained  by  the  relevant  village  collective.  The  land  compensation \nstandards used for all components are sufficient to meet replacement cost. The relevant village \ncommittees will ensure that those affected will be compensated through the provision of reserve \nland,  land  readjustment,  cash  payment,  or  payment-in-kind.  For  demolished  structures, \nreplacement value will be based on compensation rates in Baise. Those losing housing will be \nable to acquire new housing sites within their existing group or village, and close to a road. All \nsites  will  be  provided  with  water  supply,  electricity,  telephone  and  television  cable,  where \navailable.  The  relocated  families  will  receive  moving  allowances  and  temporary  housing \nallowances. \n \n4. \nDetailed  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  plans  for  seriously  affected  villages  will  be \ndeveloped and included in the updated resettlement plan for the expressway component. Based \non consultations, most people affected prefer to get cash compensation directly to be used to \nexpand businesses, improve animal husbandry, plant cash crops and trees, and provide income \nsecurity until they find outside work. New employment and income generation opportunities will \narise  during  construction  and  after  the  expressway  is  completed.  Expressway  contractors  will \ngive priority to affected households in the allocation of unskilled jobs during construction. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 22 \n\n69 \n\nResettlement  will  be  implemented  by  local  governments  with  supervision  by  GCD  to \n5. \nensure compliance with the approved resettlement plans. For the expressway component, the \nResettlement  Division  within  the  Longlin\u2013Baise  Expressway  Construction  headquarters  will  be \ndirectly  responsible  for  coordinating  the  planning,  supervision,  financing,  and  reporting  of \nresettlement for the expressway and connector roads. A resettlement leading group and office \nwas  established  in  Baise  on  20  October  2006.  Offices  will  also  be  set  up  in  all  the  relevant \ncounties,  and  staff  assigned  in  all  affected  townships  and  villages  to  implement  resettlement. \nFor economically vulnerable people, including elderly living alone, disabled, households headed \nby  women,  and  poverty  households,  the  Project  will  provide  additional  training  and  physical \nsupport. For these measures, GCD has agreed to a budget of 1% of basic resettlement fees. \n \n6. \nThe 2004 Land Law requires disclosure and consultation with people affected. Affected \nvillages  were  notified  about  the  key  elements  of  the  resettlement  plans  during  meetings  and \ninterviews. Information was disclosed through newspapers to all those affected in March 2007. \nDuring detailed resettlement planning, further notifications and consultations will discuss specific \nimpacts and how they will be addressed. In case of grievance, all complaints will be processed \nbased on the resettlement plans on Grievance and Redress. \n \n7. \nThe requirements for internal and external monitoring and evaluation are included in the \nresettlement  plans.  GCD  will  engage  a  qualified  domestic  monitor  to  carry  out  independent \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  monitor  will  conduct  a  baseline  survey  prior  to  resettlement, \nsemiannual  investigations  during  resettlement,  and  annual  survey  updates  for  2  years  after \ncompletion of resettlement; and will provide ADB  and GCD with copies of the reports. For the \nexpressway component, an internal monitoring and reporting system will be established in the \nResettlement  Division  of  the  Longlin\u2013Baise  Expressway  Construction  headquarters  and  report \nto ADB on the progress of land acquisition and resettlement through quarterly progress reports \nand a resettlement completion report. A summary of the resettlement audit will be provided to \nADB prior to the project completion review mission. For the other project components, internal \nmonitoring will be done by GCD and the land and resources bureaus; progress will be reported \nto ADB every 6 months. \n \n8. \nThe resettlement budget for the expressway is estimated at CNY600 million, for 6 local \nroads  at  CNY90  million;  and  for  other  components  at  CNY10  million.  Costs  include \ncompensation  for  land,  housing,  other  assets,  moving  allowances,  assistance  for  vulnerable \ngroups,  infrastructure,  administration,  taxes,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  contingencies. \nGCD will supplement the resettlement budget, as necessary, to meet any shortfall that emerges. \n \n9. \nThe  land  acquisition  and  housing  demolition  for  the  expressway  component  will \ncommence by September 2007. For the local roads and bus stations, some implementation will \ncommence in 2007; village road construction will commence in 2008. \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 June 2007) \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.1314 \nCNY7.6132 \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", " \n", " \n", "The  exchange  rate  of  the  yuan  is  determined  under  a  floating  exchange  rate  system.
