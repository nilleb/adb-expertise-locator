After decades of isolation, Myanmar remains one of the \npoorest  and  least-connected  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  lack  of  investment  in  ICT \ninfrastructure was apparent in the low penetration level of telecommunication services\u2014in 2013, \nonly  7  in  100  persons  had  access  to  a  mobile  phone,  0.5  in  100  had  fixed-line  telephone \naccess,  and  0.7  in  100  had  a  broadband  internet  subscription.  Due  to  lack  of  investment  and \ncompetition, the cost of having a mobile connection was prohibitively expensive for the average \ncitizen, and coverage was biased toward larger cities even though the majority of the population \nlives  in  rural  areas.  A  digital  gender  gap  also  exists  in  terms  of  basic  access  and  usage  of \nmobile  phone  and  internet  services.  This  disparity  denies  women  the  significant  benefits  and \nopportunities from participating in today\u2019s global information society. As part of its wide-ranging \nreforms, the Government of Myanmar has prioritized the availability, affordability, and quality of \nbasic ICT infrastructure throughout the country  to support inclusive socioeconomic growth and \npoverty reduction. \n \n3. \nWith assistance from the World Bank Group, the government has undertaken significant \nICT  reforms  such  as  organizational  restructuring  of  the  incumbent  operator  and  regulator, \nintroduction  of  competition,  and  opening-up  of  the  sector  to  foreign  investment.  In  February \n2014,  following  one  of  the  most  competitive  international  tenders  with  over  90  applicants,  the \ngovernment  awarded  a  telecom  operating  and  associated  spectrum  license  to  both  Qatar\u2019s \nOoredoo  Group  and  Norway\u2019s  Telenor  Group.2 The  licenses  were  awarded  based  on  several \nfactors  such  as  the  bidder\u2019s  technical  and  financial  capability  of  rolling  out  a  telecom  network \nacross the country under a tight time frame, and its commitment to offer affordable prices to the \npopulation. The ambitious targets under the licenses have been set to expand universal access \nto  over  90%  of  the  population,  which  will  result  in  an  estimated  35  million  people  in  Myanmar \nconnecting through mobile services for the very first time. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Telenor Group is one of two international telecom operators in Myanmar.   \n\n\f2 \n \n\nADB and the International Finance Corporation identified the opportunity to help fund the \n4. \nsubstantial  ICT  infrastructure  costs  required  to  build  Ooredoo\u2019s  nationwide  telecom  network. \nMultilateral support is needed given the capital-intensive nature of building a greenfield telecom \nnetwork  and  the  lack  of international  banks  willing  to  lend  into  Myanmar  at  this  time.  Through \nthe B loan program, ADB will also lead in catalyzing commercial cofinancing during Ooredoo\u2019s \nrollout phase.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  project  consists  of \n\nrolling  out  an  advanced \n\nthird-generation 3  mobile \n5. \ntelecommunication network across the country. The rollout has already begun in several major \ncities  and  townships,  and  Ooredoo  officially  launched  its  services  in  August  2014  as  the  first \ninternational  operator to begin  commercial  operations. With the third generation,  Myanmar  will \nleapfrog  several  generations  of mobile  technology  by  ensuring greater speed  and  capacity  for \ndata  transfer  and  thus  enabling  mobile  broadband  internet,  e-mail,  and  enriched  mobile \napplications in addition to conventional voice and text services. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIn addition, Ooredoo will also develop several mobile applications for banking, agriculture, and \nhealth, which will enhance access to basic services for the people of Myanmar. The project will \nbe  developed  under  a  15-year  operating  and  associated  spectrum  license  on  a  build\u2013own\u2013\noperate  basis  that  authorizes  Ooredoo  to  provide  a  full  range  of  fixed  and  mobile  telecom \nservices  nationwide.  To supplement  the  nationwide  network  rollout,  ADB  has  also  designed  a \nTA  project  to  help  the  borrower  and  other  industry  stakeholders  reduce  reliance  on  diesel \ngeneration  by  adopting  renewable  energy  technologies  for  telecom  towers  and  thereby  avoid \ncarbon emissions. \n \n\n3. \n\n[Ooredoo QSC] and Borrower \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nThe  Ooredoo  Group  is  a  leading  international  communications  company  delivering  mobile, \nfixed,  and  broadband  internet  services  to  a  customer  base  of  more  than  107  million  people \nacross 15 countries in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.4 The shares of [Ooredoo QSC] \nare  listed  on  the  Qatar  Exchange  and  the  Abu  Dhabi  Securities  Exchange,  and  the  [Ooredoo \nQSC]  was  named  Best  Mobile  Operator  of  the  Year  at  the  World  Communication  Awards  in \n2013. \n \n7. \n[Ooredoo  QSC]  has  distinguished  itself from  other global  telecom  operators  through  its \ncommitment to reducing the digital gender divide across its global operations. It  is a partner of \nthe  World  Economic  Forum\u2019s  Gender  Parity  Programme,  a  member  of  the  Groupe  Sp\u00e9ciale \nMobile  Association\u2019s5 Connected Women  Programme,  and  works  closely  with  the  Cherie  Blair \nFoundation  for  Women.  In  addition,  the  company\u2019s  chairman  is  a  member  of  the  World  Bank \nGroup  Advisory  Council  on  Gender  and  Development,  a  major  global  body  dedicated  to \npromoting gender equality around the world. \n                                                \n3  Better known as 3G \n4  Ooredoo Group has a presence in markets such as Algeria, Indonesia, Iraq, Kuwait, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \n\nRepublic, the Maldives, Oman, Palestine, the Philippines, Qatar, and Tunisia. \n\n5   Better known as GSMA \n\n\f3 \n\n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n9. \nImpact.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  increase  access  to  quality  telecommunication \nservices,  and  develop  the  required  ICT  infrastructure  in  Myanmar  that  will  facilitate  inclusive \ngrowth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  project  will  specifically  advance  inclusive  sustainable \ndevelopment  by  promoting  the  use  of  ICT  in  support  of  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment.  In  today\u2019s global  information  society,  women  are  coming online  later  and  more \nslowly  than  men,  and  are  therefore  missing  out  on  the  substantial  new  digital  opportunities \narising from mobile and internet access. ICT gender gaps go beyond basic access. Women are \ngiven fewer opportunities for ICT skills training, are offered proportionally less-senior and lower-\npaying  ICT  jobs  and  fewer  business  opportunities,  and  online  gender  content  is  lacking.  The \nproject  aims  to  reduce  the  gender  gap  by  increasing  basic  access,  promotion,  training, \nemployment, health services, and greater online content for women (footnote 1).6 \n \n10. \nOutcome.  The  project's  outcome  is  provision  of  affordable  mobile  telecommunication \nservices  improved  and  gender  inclusiveness  increased,  with  targets  set  for  women\u2019s  access, \nemployment, and business opportunities. \n \n11. \nnationwide, \ntelecommunications network extended; (ii) developing and making available to end users mobile \napplications \n(including  maternal),  banking,  and  agriculture  services;  and \n(iii) supporting and delivering conferences and an ICT community group that reduce the digital \ngender gap. \n \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nthird-generation, \n\nOutputs.

A new \nTelecommunication Law was passed in October 2013 and fulfills the basic \nelements of a liberalized telecommunications regulatory framework set out by \nthe World Trade Organization. The state-owned telecom operator, Myanmar \nPost and Telecommunications, will be restructured into a commercial entity \nand privatized. The project will be developed under an initial 15-year operating \nand associated spectrum license on a build\u2013own\u2013operate basis. \nThe project will be managed by Ooredoo Group, a leading international \ntelecommunications company that delivers mobile, fixed, and broadband \ninternet services to a customer base of 107 million across 15 countries in Asia, \nthe Middle East, and North Africa. \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nPoor electricity supply and transmission infrastructure is a huge challenge for \na telecom network that needs to operate 24 hours a day throughout the year. \nThe country has an electrification rate of less than 30%, one of the lowest in \nAsia, and in rural areas only 16% of the population has access to the electrical \ngrid. Telecom operators heavily depend on diesel generators at their tower \nsites for running core network equipment. This exposes them to fuel price \nvolatility and logistical transport issues, and causes greenhouse gas \nemissions. To mitigate the risk and associated emissions, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank is proposing technical assistance to help the borrower and \nother industry stakeholders reduce reliance on diesel generation by adopting \nrenewable energy technologies.  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nThe borrower will report key performance indicators, including output and \noutcome indicators. \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \n\nNetwork rollout \n\nEnergy supply \n\nRevenue structure \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ooredoo Myanmar Limited. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n19. \nThe assistance also includes TA of up to $1 million from the Canadian Climate Fund for \nthe Private Sector in Asia under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, administered \nby  ADB.

The  assistance  will \nprovide tangible transfer of technology, knowledge, and skills to Myanmar and help the country \novercome cost hurdles and risks associated with deploying renewable energy technologies.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  presence  of  strong international  private  sector  companies  such  as  Ooredoo  in  the \n20. \ntelecommunications  sector  will  have  a  transformational  impact  because  it  will  ensure  sound \ndevelopment  of  the  sector,  provide  significant  opportunities  in  associated  areas  and  sectors \n(e.g.,  finance  and  energy),  and  be  an  important  driver  for  continued  reform  in  support  of  the \nfundamental socioeconomic transformation the country is undertaking. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  will  support  the  government\u2019s  reforms  and  the  country\u2019s  overall \ntransformation  to  a  more  liberalized  economy  by  providing  financial  support  to  one  of  the  first \nprivate  telecom  operators  in  the  country.  Multilateral  support  is  needed  given  the  capital-\nintensive  nature  of  building  a  greenfield  telecom  network  and  the  lack  of  international  banks \nwilling to lend into Myanmar at this time. \n \nADB will provide a perspective on many issues and challenges associated with building \n22. \na network in Myanmar, e.g., weak environmental and social regulation, lack of physical transport \ninfrastructure,  shortage  of  electricity  supply  and  transmission,  and  insufficient  skills  and \ninstitutional capacity. \n \n23. \nThrough its B loan product, ADB\u2019s assistance will help catalyze international commercial \nbank financing for the network rollout that otherwise would not be available due to the perceived \npolitical risks and limitations of investing in Myanmar. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s  TA  will  help  build  the  capacity  of  private  and  public  sector  stakeholders  to \nimplement green power solutions for telecom towers in rural Myanmar, helping overcome one of \nthe major barriers to the network rollout while avoiding significant greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nC. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD. \n \n31. \nCurrently, telecom operators depend heavily on diesel generators at most telecom tower \nsites  in  Myanmar  for  running  core  network  equipment.  These  diesel  generators  consume  an \nestimated 25 million liters of diesel annually, and this is expected to increase to 116 million liters \nby  2017,  which  represents  over  300,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions. 11 The  Capacity \nDevelopment  TA  for  renewable  energy  associated  with  the  proposed  project  will  tackle  this \nissue by helping build the capacity of private and public sector stakeholders to adopt renewable \nenergy solutions at tower sites to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry.
