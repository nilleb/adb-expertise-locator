The project will support Gui\u2019an in developing an \nintelligent transport system (ITS) and sustainable transport infrastructure.1 This will make public \ntransportation  in  Gui\u2019an  a  preferred  mode  of  travel\u2014averting  congestion,  improving  transport \nsafety, and making the city livable. This, in turn, will attract private sector investment and talented \nprofessionals.  Sustainable  green  transport  will  establish  Gui\u2019an  as  a  low-carbon  city.  This \ninnovative project is expected to play a demonstrative role in the Yangtze River Economic Belt \n(YREB) and beyond. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\nStrategic context. The YREB is one of the PRC\u2019s three key economic growth engines. \n2. \nIts nine provinces and two specially administered municipalities account for more than 40% of the \npopulation, 40% of freshwater resources, and about 45% of the country\u2019s economic output. While \nthe  YREB  has  benefited  from  extensive  development  since  the  late  1980s,  particularly  in  the \neastern delta area, economic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin \nlags  that  of  the  coastal  areas  and  is  below  its  potential.  These  parts  of  the  YREB  still  face \nsignificant development challenges as a result of (i) increasing pollution and pressure on natural \nresources;  (ii)  slow  transformation  into  green  development  and  economic  diversification; \n(iii) limited  integration  of  waterways,  ports,  and  intermodal  logistics;  and  (iv)  weak  institutional \ncoordination  for  strategic  planning.  The  YREB  faces  a  growing  imbalance  between  economic \nachievement  and  environmental  quality.  To  manage  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  the \nPRC formulated the YREB development plan, 2016\u20132030, which prioritizes ecological protection \nand the promotion of green development as the guiding principle for the YREB\u2019s future growth.2 \nInclusive green development aims to (i) shift from a traditional, subsector approach to a cross-\ncutting,  integrated  approach\u2014leading  to  a  sustainable  development  model;  (ii)  solve  the \nchallenges of rapid urbanization; and (iii) serve as a guide to socioeconomic development. \n  \n3. \nGuizhou, in the southwest PRC, is part of the YREB but has slow economic growth. In \n2017, it had one of the lowest gross domestic products per capita in the PRC, at CNY37,956 or \n63.6% of the PRC average (CNY59,660), and its poverty rate of 7.75% was more than double the \nnational rate (3.10%). Some 46% of its population of 35.8 million is urban.   \n \n4. \nThe State Council of the PRC established Gui\u2019an New District (Gui\u2019an) as a new city in \nJanuary 2014, with the objective of making it the economic development driver of Guizhou and  \nsurrounding  provinces.  The  key  strategies  for  Gui\u2019an  are  to  develop  a  high-level  technology \ninnovation hub to attract talent and private business; encourage innovation and high-technology \nindustrial development; and conserve the natural environment to ensure a healthy green city and \nfoster ecotourism.3 This is in line with the PRC\u2019s new urban development strategy in its 13th five-\nyear plan, which places increasing importance on innovation, eco-friendly policies, and people-\n\n                                                \n1  Intelligent  Transport  Systems  are  applications  that  combine  leading-edge  information  and  communications \ntechnologies used in transportation which help relieve congestion, reduce pollution and increase safety. Sustainable \ntransport  infrastructure  is  defined  as  transport  infrastructure  that  provides  mobility  that  is  accessible,  safe, \nenvironment-friendly, and affordable for the present and future generations. \n\n2  Government of the PRC. 2016.

Guiyang. \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n \n\ncentered development and urbanization.4 To be able to meet these key strategies, Gui\u2019an has to \nbe livable, with transport playing a crucial role in its development. \n \n5. \nGui\u2019an\u2019s planned development area spreads over 1,795 square kilometers. Its population \nis 0.73 million (2016 estimate) and is expected to reach 2.30 million in 2030. Gui\u2019an is growing \nexponentially,  with  gross  domestic  product  expected  to  increase  by  about  58%  annually  from \nCNY17 billion in 2015 to CNY150 billion in 2020, targeting 11% agriculture, 56% industry, and \n33% service sector development, reflecting the government\u2019s focus on urbanization. \n \nChallenges. Within  Gui\u2019an\u2019s  planned  development  area  is  Gui\u2019an  Direct  Administrative \n6. \nDistrict  (GDAD),  the  project  area.  GDAD  covers  470  square  kilometers  and  forms  the  core  of \nGui\u2019an. It is designed to have four distinct economic zones (city center, technology, universities, \nand  tourism)  with  a  population  of  330,000  in  2017  that  is  set  to  double  by  2020  and  reach \n1.4 million  by  2030  (footnote  3).  Public  transport  in  GDAD  is  still  in  its  initial  stages  of \ndevelopment.  There  is  heavy  reliance  on  private  modes  of  transport  and  the  share  of  public \ntransport is only 10%. Since the opening of the first bus route in July 2014, only a total of nine bus \nroutes have been in operation. Bus services are unreliable with passenger waiting times of about \n30 to 45 minutes. Road incidents are also high (1,430 crashes in 2018) relative to the exisiting \npopulation. \n \nWithout  transport  system  integration  and  communication,  GDAD  will  experience \n7. \ninadequate  transport  connectivity,  including  suboptimal  road  infrastructure  planning  and  traffic \nsignaling, traffic bottlenecks, and congestion. A lack of integrated public transport infrastructure \nand systems leads to poorly planned timetables and overcrowding. Consequently, users become \nfrustrated with their experience of public transportation and choose other options such as private \nvehicles, resulting in lower ridership in public transportation. The resulting inefficiencies reduce \nmobility within the urban environment; hinder the ability to attract residents, tourists, and private \nsector investments; and constrain overall economic growth. \n \n8. \nRapid  economic  and  population  growth  and  urbanization  have  strained  the  delivery  of \nbasic  services  and  transportation  systems  in  cities.  This  has  resulted  in  overcrowded  road \nnetworks, poor traffic management, a high rate of traffic incidents, and parking difficulties. Poor \nand inadequate provision of public transport and its associated facilities has led to mobility and \nconnectivity  problems  for  citizens,  especially  the  underprivileged.  Traffic  congestion  has \ncontributed to deterioration of the air quality and higher fuel consumption and carbon emissions. \nThe PRC has recognized the need for balancing urban development strategies with measures to \naddress the transport problems that arise in cities, particularly in the western region. Overcoming \nthese issues will require improving urban development and transport systems and processes.  \n\n \n9. \nAs a new urban core, GDAD has the opportunity to chart a development path building on \nlessons learned in other cities, focusing from the start on economic growth and urbanization that \nis people-centered, integrated, environment-friendly, and innovative. To establish a sustainable \ntransport  system  and  minimize  key  mobility-related  challenges, an  integrated transport  system \ncharacterized  by  high  public  transport  utilization  is  required.  The  development  of  an  ITS  that \nconnects all modes of transport, facilitates travel demand management measures, and provides \na  seamless  public  transport  experience,  particularly  to  users  switching  between  modes,  is  the \nfoundation  of  sustainable  mobility.  It  is  also  a  key  pillar  in  sustainable  urbanization  and  the \ncreation  of  more  livable  cities.  Without  active  forward  planning  and  technological  innovation, \n\n                                                \n4  Government  of  the  PRC.  2015.  The  13th  Five-Year  Plan  for  Economic  and  Social  Development  of  the  People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of China, 2016\u20132020. Beijing. \n\n\f3 \n\nGDAD\u2019s targets of a public transport modal share of 60% and a green transport modal share of \n80% by 2030 will be difficult to achieve.5 \n \n10. \nProposed solutions. Technology plays a crucial role in developing sustainable transport \nnetworks and systems. Intellignet transport systems (ITSs) can connect transport networks across \nmodes, improving efficiency, coordination, and safety. They use information and communication \ntechnology in vehicles and transport infrastructure to collect, manage, and distribute information \nto  improve  transport  outcomes.  ITSs  use  a  range  of  technologies  that  provide  information  to \nenable  services  such  as  coordinated  incident  and  emergency  response  systems;  and \nmanagement  of  parking,  public  transport,  bicycle  sharing  systems,  and  freight.  ITSs  can \naccelerate better and faster development of surface transportation and reduce accidents by about \n7%. 6  To  ensure  that  the  introduction  of  the  ITS  results  in  more  inclusive,  gender-sensitive \ntransport  solutions,  the  project  team  used  human-centered  design  (HCD)  methodology\u2014an \ninnovation that aims to make products and systems user-friendly by focusing on the users and \ntheir needs, and by applying human factors. \n \nThese  ITS  services  provide  various  users  and  operators  with  critical  information  for \n11. \ndecision making, enabling safer and more coordinated use of transport networks, and optimizing \ninfrastructure utilization. One key ITS service is traffic demand management, which harnesses \ntraffic and user data to determine transport demand and redistribute users over time or to alternate \nroutes.  This  enables  people  and  freight  to  move  easier,  reducing  congestion  and  emissions, \nimproving the quality of the urban environment, and encouraging economic growth. \n \n12. \nDeveloping  a  sustainable  transport  system  includes  the  improved  use  of  public \ntransportation,  and  provision  and  use  of  clean  energy  public  transport  modes  such  as  electric \nbuses, which are proven to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and local emissions in cities. Electric \nbuses reduce GHG emissions by 30%\u201340% and do not contribute to local nitrogen oxides and \nemissions from particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Cities could reduce \ntheir GHG emissions in turn by 8%\u201312%. The implementation of electric buses in a system will \nimprove the overall mobility and sustainability of the urban transport system and compound the \npositive impact of the technology.7    \n \nITS technologies and services can be complemented by advances in vehicle technology \n13. \nsuch  as  intelligent  connected  vehicles,8 electric  vehicles,  and  electric  buses,  to  provide  more \nenvironment-friendly  and  efficient  transport  services.  The  adoption  of  these  high-level \ntechnologies  and  their  integration  into  the  urban  fabric  is  crucial  for  the  development  of \nsustainable  urban  transport  systems.  Up-front  planning  and  design  of  an  efficient,  integrated \nurban transport system in new cities\u2014incorporating the needs of its users\u2014is crucial to avoid the \nproblems  of  historic, car-centric  transport  systems  and  achieve  the  vision  of  a livable  city  with \nsustainable economic growth.  \n \n14. \nValue added by ADB assistance. Under Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB),  the  project  will  focus  on  two  of  the  seven  operational  priorities:  (i)  making  cities  more \nlivable; and (ii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability.9 ADB  will  help  GDAD  explore  new  and  existing  technologies  and \n\n                                                \n5  Green  transport  is the use  of transport modes  that  do  not  negatively impact  the  environment  and  that use  clean \nenergy.  The  modal  share  by  2030  is  envisaged  to  be  25%  walking,  5.0%  bicycle,  27.5%  bus,  22.5%  train,  and \n20.0% car and/or motorcycle. \n\n6  ADB. 2016.

Manila.  \n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\napproaches  to  urbanization  that  encourage  integrated,  safe,  green,  and  inclusive  urban \ndevelopment and make cities more livable. ADB will add value by introducing an ITS in new urban \ndevelopment through new technologies and best practices in project design and implementation, \nincluding  international  expertise  at  the  forefront  of  ITS  development,  an  intelligent  connected \nvehicle system (ICVS), and clean transport technology.  ADB\u2019s involvement provides access to \ninternational best practice in HCD. ADB provides a platform to transfer knowledge in sustainable, \ninclusive, and participatory urban transport planning, design, and operation to other regions. The \nexperience and knowledge gained from such an innovative project can also be replicated in other \ncities in and outside the PRC.10  \n \n15. \nDuring  project  preparation,  the  project  team  gathered  extensive  user  and  stakeholder \nfeedback  to  identify  innovation  opportunities  on  the  ITS,  buses,  and  bus  stations  using  HCD \nmethodology.  The  HCD  research  also  guided  the  design  of  communication  and  participation \nmechanisms.11 The  communication  strategy  focuses  on  integrating  stakeholder  inputs  into  the \nplanning and implementation of the ITS and transport infrastructure so that road users, including \nunderrepresented groups, can participate in providing solutions to key accessibility and mobility \nissues. The project will launch behavior change communication campaigns to increase patronage \nfor  public  buses  and other green  transport modes. The social  development  and gender  action \nplan contributes to narrowing the digital divide in GDAD.12  \n \nADB\u2019s participation will create an enabling environment that will ensure opportunities for \n16. \nprivate  sector  participation  by  (i)  creating  a  livable  city  to  attract  and  retain  workers;  (ii) \nstrengthening  the  transport  backbone  so  the  private  sector  can  invest  in  additional  auxiliary \nservices,  such  as car-sharing  or  wayfinding  applications;  and (iii) facilitating  a  high-technology \nworkforce to provide a qualified labor pool thereby attracting private sector investments.  \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: economic activity and livability improved \n17. \n(footnote 3).

This data will be stored, managed, \nand maintained in the big data service center. Different management systems for different transport modes (buses, \ntaxis, bicycles, passenger cars, and freight vehicles), parking, and law enforcement will be created. Data from these \nmanagement  systems  will  flow  to  the  multimodal  transportation  systems  management  and  operations  center  to \nanalyze and manage different services. The integrated traffic operations, and security and emergency management \nsystem  will  monitor  real  time  multi-modal  operations  by  a  platform  that  includes  software  and  computer  network \nsystems, and communications technologies. \n\n\f19. \nOutput  2:  Sustainable  transport  infrastructure  built.  To  promote  maximum  public \ntransportation use in new urban development, the transport system must be flexible and enable \nusers to switch safely and seamlessly between modes, including walking, cycling, buses, trains, \nand cars:  \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nbuild  20  bus  stations,  including  six  hub stations,  11  terminal  stations,  and  three \nbus  depots\u2014this  infrastructure  will  work  together  with  ITS  elements  to  optimize \ninfrastructure and overall urban mobility; \npurchase 200 clean energy buses to increase the bus route coverage and reduce \nemissions from public transport services;  \nbuild a regional network of 21 electric charging stations for both private and public \nvehicles to encourage green vehicles and reduce emissions; \nconstruct  a  network  of  about  8.16  kilometers  of  new  urban  roads  in  the  core  of \nGDAD as part of the transport network backbone\u2014these roads will provide access \nto key existing north\u2013south and east\u2013west trunk roads and will be equipped with \nITS equipment; and   \nset up an ICVS demonstration zone for research and development of ICVS and \nassociated technologies, including the application of information technology in the \ntransport  infrastructure,  auxiliary  equipment,  and  data  center  platform  in  the \ndesignated area.16 \n\n \nOutput  3:  Smart  transport  capacity  strengthened.  The  project  includes  capacity \n20. \nstrengthening  activities  to  ensure  a  relevant  and  up-to-date  ITS  and  consider  clean  transport \ntechnology at the design, implementation, and operation phases. The capacity of the Government \nof Gui\u2019an New District (GGAND) will be strengthened by applying communication and stakeholder \nengagement approaches. This will ensure that the ITS and infrastructure design and services are \ninclusive,  gender-responsive,  safe,  and  sustainable;  and  that  transport  users  are  motivated \nthrough  behavior  change  communication  campaigns  to  choose  green  transport  modes.

The project team conducted feasibility studies for the \n26. \nITS,  public  transport,  and  sustainable  infrastructure  components.  The  studies  included  the \nadoption  of  advanced  technologies  for  (i)  transport  and  data  communication  provision,  (ii)  the \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of electric buses, and (iii) charging systems. The project team \nselected suitable ITS design and engineering solutions considering costs, climate, environmental \nand  social  impacts,  and  O&M  capacities.  Preliminary  designs  of  the  data  center  and  ITS \ncomponents comply with the ITS conceptual design and data and communications standards in the \nPRC. Electric bus specifications and bus depot configuration adhere to international and domestic \nstandards. The project team prepared a generic testing guideline and an ICVS safety framework \nbased on the currently available ICVS technologies and commonly used testing scenarios. HCD \nfeatures  are  incorporated  in  the  integrated  bus  information  system  and  bus  station  designs. \nMoreover, the project team designed programs to build smart transport capacity based on needs \nassessments, social surveys, and institutional analyses.   \n \nB. \n \n27. \nEconomic analysis. The project team assessed the economic viability of the overall project \nand  the  main  subcomponents  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines. 18  The  overall  project  is \neconomically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 16.8%. Economic benefits \nof  the  project  include  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  time  savings,  safety  benefits,  and \nemissions reduction. The project will also generate unquantifiable wider economic benefits such as \nimproved connectivity and poverty reduction. A sensitivity analysis of potential cost overruns and \nbenefit reductions demonstrates that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust.19 \n \n28. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  project  team  conducted  a  financial  analysis  to  establish  the \nproject\u2019s  financial  viability  and  sustainability. 20  For  the  three  revenue-generating  subprojects \n(charging stations, bus hubs, and electic buses), ADB based the financial viability assessment on \nthe comparison between the projected financial internal rate of return  and the weighted average \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n18 ADB.  2017.

The project team assessed the charging station subproject as financially viable, as \nits projected financial internal rate of return exceeds the weighted average cost of capital. For the \nbus hubs and electric buses, government subsidies will be needed to service the O&M costs during \noperations. The financial sustainability assessment indicates that the GGAND has enough funds to \nsupport  the  counterpart  funding  requirements,  provided  that  the  national  and  provincial \ngovernments continue providing budget subsidies. However, reliance on these subsidies presents \na risk to the project\u2019s financial sustainability. \n \nC. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate  mainly  because \n29. \n(i) the executing agency is unfamiliar with ADB\u2019s financial management policy and procedures, \nand (ii) the PMO lacks financial management staff. The executing agency needs to strengthen its \nfinancial management capacity by establishing a new financial management unit under the PMO, \nwith adequate and experienced financial staff who are well trained in ADB\u2019s financial management \npolicy and procedures. The project team will conduct training activities at regular intervals during \nthe  processing  and  implementation  stages.  The  project  team  incorporated  the  mitigation \nmeasures agreed with the GGAND into the project design and will monitor these measures during \nproject implementation, as specified in the PAM. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender  \n\n \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  The  project  team  conducted  an  assessment  of  the \n30. \nproject  procurement  risk,  subject  to  the  procurement  capacity  of  the  executing  agency,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.  The  procurement  risk  of  the  project  is  assessed  medium \nbefore  mitigation  measures.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  GGAND.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n31. \nThe  project  will  introduce  efficient,  affordable,  and  user-friendly  public  transport  into  an \nurbanizing but still predominantly rural area\u2014enabling economic development and averting future \ncongestion and pollution. The project\u2019s direct beneficiaries will include women and the poor. The \nITS will be an enabler for GDAD\u2019s vision to become a technology hub that offers high quality of life, \nattracting  entrepreneurial  talent  from  across  the  PRC.  In  the  long  term,  the  project  will  benefit \nGDAD\u2019s residents and businesses by ensuring high-quality and affordable mobility in a livable city. \nThe project also targets at least 30% women to be employed in new skilled jobs such as ticketing, \nbus driving, and maintenance. \n \n32. \nProject preparation relied on extensive consultations with residents\u2014including women, former \nfarmers, and the elderly\u2014using HCD methods. These consultations resulted in proposals for gender- \nand disability-sensitive bus and station design, which will be developed in the detailed design. The \ncapacity strengthening component aims to narrow the digital divide in GDAD by (i) running inclusion-\nfocused hackathons to develop ITS applications and services related to traffic safety, green mobility, \ngender, and disability inclusion; and (ii) motivate school-aged girls to consider careers in the fields of \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics by participating in ITS coding camps. The project \nteam developed a communication strategy to support the project\u2019s behavior change and inclusive \nparticipation aims. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nE. \n \n33. \ncategories are as follows.21 \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  team  prepared  an  initial  environmental \n34. \nexamination (IEE), including an environmental management plan (EMP), in accordance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The project area and its vicinity do not involve any environmentally \nsensitive  areas  or  physical  cultural  heritage.  Potential  negative  environmental  impacts  during \nconstruction  are  short-term  and  localized;  and  are  associated  with  fugitive  dust,  construction \nnoise,  wastewater,  solid  waste,  disruption  of  traffic,  and  risks  to  occupational  and  community \nhealth  and  safety.  Potential  negative  environmental  impacts  during  operation  include  noise, \nwaste, and wastewater at bus depots, hubs and stations, traffic noise, and emission induced from \nprojects  roads;  hazardous  materials  from  bus  service  areas;  and  end  of  life-cycle  buses  and \nbatteries  that  require  replacement.  The  EMP  describes  mitigation  measures,  monitoring \nrequirements, and institutional responsibilities for ensuring adequate environmental management \nthroughout  the  project\u2019s  construction  and  operation.  The  project  team  will  handle  potential \nenvironmental  complaints  or  disputes  in  accordance  with  the  grievance  redress  mechanism \nestablished  for  the  project.  The  executing  agency  committed  to  implement  the  agreed  EMP,  as \nreflected  in  the  PAM  and  loan  covenants.  The  IEE  disclosed  relevant  project  information  and \ndocuments to the affected people and conducted meaningful public consultation in accordance with \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement. The project team will conduct continuous reassessment of impact \nareas and consultations throughout project implementation. \n \nThe project team conducted a climate risk and vulnerability assessment and concluded \n35. \nthat the highest risk that climate change poses to the project is higher flood peak flows resulting \nfrom increased intensity of storm events. To address this risk, the project team augmented the \nintensity  of  design  storms  by  10%  in  designing  the  road  systems  and  sizing  drainage \npipes/channels.  The  detailed  design team  will  also consider the  potential  effects  of  increased \nstorm  peak  flows  caused  by  climate  change  in  setting  the  locations  of  important  facilities  and \nwater-proofing project components, including electrical equipment. \n \nThe project team adopted a two-phased approach for the ICVS demonstration testing as \n36. \nreflected in the project agreement. During project processing, the first phase, the project team \nprepared  a  generic  testing  guideline  and  an  ICVS  safety  framework  based  on  the  currently \navailable  ICVS  technology  and  a  commonly  used  ICVS  testing  plan  scenario.  During  project \nimplementation, the second phase, the team will engage ICVS experts to guide, review, and provide \nrecommendations on the detailed design, testing plan scenarios, and safety management plan.  \n \n(category  B).  The  project  will  occupy  698.57  mu \n37. \n(46.57 hectares [ha]) of land for bus stations and charging stations, of which 481.96 mu (32.13 ha) \nis previously acquired state-owned land and 216.61 mu (14.44 ha) is rural collective land that needs \nto be acquired. The land acquisition will not impact any residential units.22 A total of 161 households \nwith 697 persons will be affected marginally by land acquisition, since agriculture accounts for less \nthan  2%  of  household  income.  The  average  land  loss  rate  is  about  6%  of  the  total  land  and \nnonsignificant in nature. A resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared and disclosed. The PMO will \nensure that compensation is paid in cash before acquisition and taking physical possession of the \nland.  The  project  aims  to  provide  skilled  and  unskilled  job  opportunities  for  local  people  during \nproject construction and operation. Affected households will be given priority for such employment. \nThe  PMO  will  appoint  a  dedicated  resettlement  officer  to  handle  resettlement  planning  and \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement \n\n                                                \n21 ADB.
