An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was  also \nprepared  to  guide  the  environmental  assessment  of  further \nsubprojects.  \n   \nSector Investment  The proposed Orissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water \nProgram  Management Investment Program will enhance the productivity, \nwater use efficiency, and sustainability of the existing major and \nmedium-sized irrigation schemes and community-based minor lift \nirrigation systems in the four northern river basins and a part of \nthe Mahanadi River Delta in Orissa state. The selected schemes \nare suffering from poor performance in irrigated agriculture due to \ninefficient operation, system deterioration, and limited integration \nwith  agriculture  support  services  and  marketing  systems.  The \nInvestment Program will include (i) water user association (WUA) \nempowerment,  (ii)  renovation  and  extension  of  irrigation  and \nassociated infrastructure including field channels, (iii) agriculture \nand related support services including livelihood enhancement of \nthe  poor,  and  (iv)  progressive  transfer  of  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) to WUAs. The Investment Program will also \nstrengthen  the  institutional  basis  for  participatory  irrigation \nmanagement (PIM) and integrated water resources management \n(IWRM) with management reforms and capacity strengthening of \nrelevant institutions.  \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  will  finance  projects \nFacility  under the Investment Program, provided the Government of India \nand the Orissa state government comply with the assurances to \nADB and the constituent projects are in line with those assurances \nand with the criteria set out in the framework financing agreement \n(FFA).  \n \nADB will provide loans to finance projects under the MFF as soon \nas  the  projects  are  ready  for  financing  upon  submission  of \nsatisfactory  related  periodic  financing  request.  Each  loan  will ", "ii   \nconstitute  a  tranche  and  may  carry  terms  different  from  the \nfinancing terms of previous or later loans. The choice of financing \nterms will depend on the project and ADB\u2019s financing policies at \nthe time the loan is documented in a legal document. Tranches \nmay be provided in sequence or simultaneously, and may overlap.\n \nThe projects corresponding to individual tranches may comprise \nindividual subprojects, their subcomponents, and/or other physical \nand nonphysical components of the Investment Program that are \npackaged based on procurement and/or implementation years.  \n   \nRationale  Despite  India\u2019s  rapid  overall  economic  growth,  development  in \nagriculture and related rural nonfarm sectors has been stagnant, \nand the sector is making a slow transformation to more intensive \nand high-value production and processing systems. Bottlenecks in \nboth rural and urban water resources are also increasingly seen \nas a major constraint to economic growth. In this context, irrigation \nis drawing major attention because of its high share (84%) of total \nwater use, as well as its crucial importance for agriculture and \nrural  growth.  A  significant  part  of  the  existing  irrigation \ninfrastructure remains underutilized, with low water-use efficiency \nand insufficient O&M. The Government of India is promoting state \nsector reforms through its National Water Policy (NWP) 1987 and \n2002, which advocates PIM and IWRM to promote and sustain \nmore efficient water use.  \n \nOrissa  is  one  of  the  poorest  states  in  India.  Despite  recent \nacceleration of its annual economic growth rates, disparity against \nthe national average is still widening. Agriculture is the backbone \nof the economy and is the central focus of the strategy of the \nOrissa state government (OSG) to reduce rural poverty. In this \ncontext, the low performance of existing irrigation infrastructure \nseriously  constrains  agricultural  productivity  and  diversification. \nWhile 45% of agricultural land is equipped with irrigation facilities, \nover 30% of this area hardly receives any irrigation and the rest \nhas irregular water supply due to poor system design, inefficient \noperation, lack of field channels, limited accountability in system \nmanagement to farmers, and insufficient maintenance. Following \nthe NWP, the OSG is prioritizing the improved performance of \nexisting infrastructure in partnership with WUAs as the fastest and \nmost  cost-effective  way  to  expand  reliable  irrigation  and  as  a \npathway to intensified, high-value agriculture.  \n \nTo support the process, the OSG has progressively developed the \npolicy, planning, and institutional basis for the irrigation and water \nresources  sector  since  the  late  1990s.  Specific  steps  taken \ninclude (i) promulgation of the State Water Policy and State Water \nPlan adopting PIM and IWRM principles, (ii) establishment of a \nlegal  framework  for  WUAs,  (iii)  substantial  increases  in  water \ntariffs and O&M financing, and (iv) capacity strengthening of the \nDepartment of Water Resources (DOWR). In line with this, the ", "  iii\nOSG  initiated  formation  of  WUAs,  renovation  of  irrigation \ninfrastructure, and progressive transfer of the O&M responsibility \nto WUAs. So far, WUA formation has reached 40% of the total \ncommand  areas  under  public  irrigation  systems.  The  overall \nimpacts of the process are positive, particularly where WUAs are \nsufficiently  strengthened  and  provided  with  well-functioning \ninfrastructure,  although  capacity  development  of  WUAs  and \nDOWR requires long-term support and partnership.    \n \nThe OSG also initiated comprehensive economic reforms in the \nearly 2000s, aiming at inclusive growth with stronger public sector \naccountability  and  community  and  private  sector  participation. \nWithin this context, the OSG is keen to further advance PIM in the \nremaining schemes, and to incorporate the lessons learned so far, \nas  well  as  the  best  practices  from  other  Asian  countries  and \nIndian states to attain higher impacts in terms of productivity and \nsustainability. The Investment Program is designed to meet this \nneed,  with  an  improved  institutional  basis  including  enhanced \nDOWR accountability to WUAs, further refinement of the WUA \nlegal framework, and steps towards sustainable O&M financing \nand IWRM. Investment program delivery and governance will also \nbe upgraded to ensure sufficient WUA empowerment up front, \ninfrastructure quality, integration with the agriculture value chain \nand support systems, and sound provider\u2013recipient relations for \nO&M. Prepared as part of the investment plan to put PIM into \noperation  statewide,  the  Investment  Program  will  support  the \nrealization of sound sector operations from the OSG initiative.   \n \nThe MFF modality is most suitable for the Investment Program. \nBuilding on the progressively developed policy and institutional \nbasis,  the  MFF  provides  an  opportunity  for  (i)  flexibility  in \ninvestment decision making based on subproject readiness, in \nparticular  ensuring  sound  progress  in  planning  and  WUA \ninstitutional building; (ii) higher implementation quality, reflecting \nlessons learned and progressive and incremental improvement of \nthe institutional basis during the program period; (iii) longer-term \nprogram engagement allowing sufficient monitoring of the critical \ninstitutional  development  process;  and  (iv)  wider  program \ncoverage that allows more significant sector impacts under the \nproposed Investment Program.  \n \n   \n ", "iv   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the Investment Program is enhanced rural \neconomic growth and reduced poverty in the selected river basins, \nand  institutionalization  of  effective  mechanisms  to  put  into \noperation PIM-based agricultural growth.  \n \nThe  expected  outcome  is  enhanced  productivity,  water-use \nefficiency, and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the selected \nexisting schemes in the river basins, and improved performance \nof irrigation service delivery and water resources management \nwith empowered WUAs progressively taking over O&M roles.  \n   \nProgram Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Investment Program is estimated at \n$268.8 million, including taxes and duties of $11.1 million.  \n   \n       \nFinancing Plan \nAmount  Share  \nSource   \n($ million)  (%) \nADB  188.2  70   \nOrissa State Government  73.4  27   \nBeneficiaries a  7.2  3   \nTotal  268.8  100   \n a  Contribution in cash or in kind       \n   \nFinancing Amount and  A  facility  of  up  to  $188.2  million  from  the  ordinary  capital \nTerms  resources of ADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The Government of \nIndia will cause the OSG to use the proceeds of each tranche for \nthe  expenditures  of  the  Investment  Program,  according  to  the \nconditions set forth in the FFA and the legal agreements for each \ntranche.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of India will provide the loan proceeds in local \nTerms  currency  to  the  OSG  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as \nreceived from ADB. The OSG will bear the foreign exchange risk \non the loan.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The Investment Program resources will tentatively be available in \nfour (or more if needed) tranches until September 2017 (the last \nperiodic  financing  request  is  expected  to  be  submitted  by  31 \nMarch 2015).   \n   \nEstimated Program  March 2017 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Water Resources, Orissa \n   \nImplementation  Program  implementation  will  institutionalize  effective  program \nArrangements  delivery mechanisms for planning, implementing, and sustaining \nirrigated agriculture development with PIM within the regular and \nimproved  setup  of  the  DOWR,  with  outsourcing  to  the  private \nsector  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  A ", "  v\nmultidisciplinary  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be \nestablished in the new PIM and Command Area Development \n(CAD) directorate of the DOWR to manage overall Investment \nProgram implementation. Day-to-day implementation will be done \nthrough  subproject  implementation  offices  (SIOs)  set  up  in \nDOWR\u2019s  field  offices  with  multidisciplinary  staff,  under  the \nguidance and coordination of the district development committee \nchaired by the district collector. WUAs will have a major role in the \nprocess by endorsing implementation plans, monitoring program \ndelivery,  and  executing  minor  civil  works.  Regular  SIO\u2013WUA \nmeetings will be institutionalized as a major forum for decision \nmaking.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement financed from the ADB loans under the MFF will \nconform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Civil works contracts of at least $10 million will \nbe  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  and  those \ncosting less than $10 million will be under national competitive \nbidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to ADB. Single-stage, two-\nenvelope bidding with post qualification will be adopted for all \nNCB  and  ICB  contracts  under  the  Investment  Program. \nSpecialized and small community works costing less than $10,000 \nmay be directly contracted with the concerned WUAs. \n \nFor the procurement of goods and related services, ICB will be \nused for contracts of at least $1 million and NCB for contracts of \nless than $1 million. For contracts valued at less than $100,000 \nADB\u2019s shopping procedures may be followed.   \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  hired  for  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building, project management, design and construction \nmonitoring,  and  benefit  monitoring.  Agencies  or  institutions, \nincluding established registered NGOs, will also be engaged for \nparticipatory planning, WUA strengthening, minor work execution \nby WUAs, agriculture and livelihood programs, and facilitation and \nmonitoring of resettlement plans. All consultants and NGOs will be \nengaged  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n   \nInvestment Program  The Investment Program will directly improve the incomes and \nBenefits and  livelihoods of about 1.7 million people by raising the performance \nBeneficiaries  of 215,000 hectares (ha) within the command area of existing \nirrigation schemes. The main benefits are increased agriculture \nproduction\u2014brought about by reliable water supply, particularly in \nareas with little or no access to irrigation, through renovation of \nthe  existing  infrastructure  and  improved  reservoir  and  canal \noperation\u2014along  with  increased  labor  opportunities,  better \nnutrition, increased incomes, and lowered poverty. The economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  five  major  and  medium-sized \nschemes is between 19% and 23%, whereas the EIRRs of the two \nsample minor lift schemes are 30% and 38%. At the state level, \n ", "vi   \nthe Investment Program will improve irrigation service delivery to \nattain  maximum  sustainable  benefits  through  renovating \ninfrastructure  and  installing  PIM  systems,  along  with  improved \nsector governance with associated institutional actions.  \n \nBetween 22% and 69% of the population in the five major and \nmedium-sized irrigation subprojects fall below the poverty line, but \nare generally higher than the national average. Most of those \npeople live on less than $1 a day. The social and gender strategy \nwill enhance the participation of the poor in WUAs, linking them to \nexisting poverty reduction programs of the OSG with delivery of \ntargeted  support  under  the  Investment  Program  as  required, \nenhancing the role of women in project institutions and WUAs, \nand  strengthening  the  capacities  of  the  DOWR  in  addressing \ngender development issues in promoting PIM.       \n \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Investment Program has a few risks that could adversely \naffect  its  effectiveness  and  sustainability,  including  (i)  O&M \nsustainability;  (ii)  implementation  of  reform  principles  with \nleadership; and (iii) implementation risk. To mitigate the risk of \nO&M  sustainability,  the  OSG  has  committed  to  continued \ncompliance  with  the  directions  of  the  Government\u2019s  Finance \nCommission on the O&M fund allocation and associated revisions \nof  tariff  structures.  This  is  accompanied  by  (i)  progressive \nstrengthening  of  DOWR  capacities  and  accountability  and  of \nWUAs  to  establish self-sustaining O&M  management  systems, \nand (ii) establishment of a sound asset performance management \ninformation  system.  To  ensure  adequate  levels  of  reform \nprinciples operation, sequential steps have been specified in the \nsector road map and implementation arrangements to ensure this \ndoes happen at sector and Investment Program levels. The risk of \nimplementation  delay  is  addressed  through  the  early \nimplementation  of  start-up  activities  including  staff  assignment \nand training, advance recruitment of consultants and NGOs, and \nadvance procurement of key infrastructure works, which has been \nsubstantially  advanced  through  separate  technical  assistance \nprovided for this purpose. Resources for timely implementation \nsupport have also been incorporated. Similar advance actions will \nbe pursued prior to the processing of the subsequent projects, \nwith refinement of Investment Program design and diversion of \nresources if needed.  \n \nTechnical Assistance  The  Multi-donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility will provide a technical assistance grant in the \namount  of  $250,000  equivalent  to  support  the  OSG  to  initiate \nsteps to introduce integrated water resources management at the \nstate and the selected river basin levels.

I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Orissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and \nWater Management Investment Program (the Investment Program).1 The report also describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Development of Integrated Water Resources \nManagement in Orissa to be provided by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility (MTFWFPF),2 and if the Board approves the proposed MFF, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  National  Context  of  Rural  Economy  and  Water  Resources.  India has seen rapid \neconomic growth since the late 1990s and achieved a per capita income of $588 in 2005. \nHowever, many people still remain poor; among the total population of 1.1 billion, 35% were living \non less than $1 a day, and 80% on less than $2 a day, mostly in rural areas,3 causing growing \nconcern about the urban\u2013rural divide. The growth rate of agriculture (accounting for 25% of gross \ndomestic product [GDP] but 58% of employment) slowed recently to just 1.8% per annum during \n2002\u20132005. Crop production stagnated with less than 1% growth, even though Indian yields are \nmuch lower than those in other developing countries.4 While diversification is progressing with the \nshare of horticulture and livestock reaching 21% and agriculture reaching 29% of GDP, growth in \nthese subsectors also decelerated to less than 4% despite high potential. Growth of the rural \nnonfarm sector, now larger than agriculture as a share of GDP, is also strongly correlated with \nagriculture performance. In view of the wide regional disparity in productivity and overall self-\nsufficiency in cereal crops, the growth strategy of the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP), 2007\u20132012, \nenvisages a multipronged approach in response to diverse agro-climatic conditions, aiming at \ndiversification  to  high-value  agriculture  in  areas  endowed  with  better  climate  and  marketing \nconditions, while intensifying food crops in less advantaged areas.  \n3.  In India, bottlenecks in water resources are increasingly seen as a major threat to \neconomic growth. Per capita availability of water is rapidly declining and is one third of the level \nit was at independence. Water stress is increasing in many river basins, while water quality is \ndeteriorating. In this context, more efficient irrigation has become crucial for both accelerating \nrural growth and conserving water resources. Irrigation is essential to agriculture and accounts \nfor 84% of total water use. Despite this, a significant part of the existing infrastructure (20% of \n57 million hectares [ha] developed for surface water irrigation) remains unutilized due to low \nwater-use efficiency and inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M). Management capacity \nof the state water agencies is a constraint in terms of the quality of service delivery and farmer \nparticipation. A sound regulatory framework for efficient inter-sector water management is in the \ninitial  stage  of  implementation.5 The  Government  is  promoting  state  reforms  through  the \nNational  Water  Policy  (NWP)  of  1987  and  2002,  which  advocates  participatory  irrigation \nmanagement (PIM) in partnership with water user associations (WUAs), and integrated water \n                                                 \n1  Project preparatory technical assistance  was provided under ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n2  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway. \n3  The country\u2019s urban\u2013rural population ratio was 29:71 in 2006.  \n4  The average rice yield is half that of Indonesia and Viet Nam.  \n5  Improving the management of existing irrigation infrastructure is critical to reduce the burden on India\u2019s limited \nwater resources amidst the increasing demand for food and other water uses, and increasing financial, social, and \nenvironmental costs and time required to develop new water storage facilities. \n \n \n ", "2 \nresources  management  (IWRM). 6  Several  states  have  introduced  improved  institutional \nframeworks, but implementation progress varies across the country.  \n4.  Status in Orissa. Orissa remains one of India\u2019s poorest states, with a per capita income \nof Rs16,300 (70% of the national average) and 46% of the population (about 39 million) living \nbelow the poverty line in 2005. Disparity against the national average is widening, although the \nannual economic growth rate accelerated to over 7% in 2006\u20132007. About 85% of the state\u2019s \npoor live in rural areas. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, accounting for 33% of state \ndomestic product and employing over 60% of total labor; despite this, productivity remains low. \nThe value of agriculture output per hectare is 78% of the national average due to low yields and \ncropping intensity.  Diversification  also  lags  behind,  with  food  crops accounting for  75%  of \ncropped area against the national average of 67%. Key constraints are (i) limited physical \ncapital, including irrigation and other rural infrastructure; (ii) limited access to and use of modern \ninputs  and  financial  services;  (iii)  a  low  technology  base;  (iv)  small  landholdings  (with  an \naverage size of 1.3 ha); (v) a lack of effective local institutions and links from input delivery to \noutput marketing; and (vi) limited effectiveness of public research and extension systems. \n5.  Orissa  is  endowed  with  relatively  high  rainfall,  with  an  annual  average  of  1,500 \nmillimeters. Despite this, irrigation is a critical input for agriculture throughout the year, as \n80% of the annual rainfall occurs in the June\u2013September period in an erratic pattern. The \nstate has a net sown area of 6.0 million ha. So far, 2.69 million ha of net irrigation potential \nhas been created, comprising 1.24 million ha in major and medium-sized schemes, 0.50 \nmillion ha in minor flow schemes, 0.39 million ha in lift schemes, and 0.57 million ha in other \nmodalities  including  groundwater  irrigation.  An  additional  0.47  million  ha  of  potential \nirrigated  area  is  being  created.  However,  the  actual  area  with  irrigation  remains  at  a \nmaximum of 70% of the designed area. This is due to (i) infrastructure deterioration caused \nby insufficient maintenance; (ii) lack of water control structures, inefficient system operation, \nand lack of accountability of facility operators to farmers, all leading to high levels of loss; \n(iii) lack of farmer participation in O&M; and (iv) lack of field channels to distribute water \nacross farm plots.7 Productivity in irrigated agriculture is also constrained due to limited \nintegration  with  input  delivery,  agriculture  support  services,  and  output  marketing,  with \nlimited coordination among the line departments.  \n6.  With  regard  to  overall  water  resources  management  (as  against  irrigation  service \ndelivery), competition among bulk water users and environmental requirements within a basin \nare gradually becoming issues.8 This calls for (i) further developing water resources through \nwater  storage,  (ii)  improving  the  water-use  efficiency  of  existing  systems  in  particular  for \nirrigation, and (iii) introducing effective institutional mechanisms for regulatory and other water \nmanagement functions on the basis of river basins from an IWRM perspective.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Agriculture and Support Systems. In its Vision 2020 and the 11th FYP, the Orissa \nstate government (OSG) envisions accelerating economic growth to 9% per year and reducing \npoverty by 15% during 2008\u20132012. Building on the comprehensive economic reforms pursued \n                                                 \n6  PIM promotes establishing WUAs and progressively transferring O&M responsibilities (presently held by irrigation \ndepartments) to WUAs, while enhancing the departmental accountability to WUAs with institutional reforms. \n7  Efficient water distribution in the dry season is a particular challenge requiring stronger management to efficiently \nallocate the limited amount of available water among farmers. Moreover, limited efforts have been made to \npromote conjunctive use of groundwater irrigation within the irrigation schemes.  \n8  In 2001, irrigation accounted for 93% of surface water use, followed by domestic (4%) and industry (3%). With the \nannounced large foreign direct investments in the industry sector, inter-sector allocation and coordination in water \nuse is an emerging issue, despite overall abundance of water except during the very lean period.    \n ", "3 \nsince  early  2000s,  key  priorities  include  (i)  improving  agriculture  productivity  and  market \norientation with PIM and the formation of farmer groups, (ii) expanding rural nonfarm business \nopportunities, and (iii) enabling broad-based industrial growth. These priorities will be supported \nby reforms in the enabling environment for private sector entry and improved fiscal and financial \nmanagement and public sector accountability. In this context, the OSG amended the Agriculture \nProduce Marketing Act in April 2006, which has opened ways for private investments in storage \nand marketing facilities and contract farming. The OSG also endorsed the State Agriculture \nPolicy  in  2008,  which  aims  at  commercially  oriented  agriculture,  with  emphasis  on  crop \ndiversification and marketing reforms. This policy promotes participatory and comprehensive \nplanning  at  district  and  lower  levels,  based  on  which  support  will  be  delivered  through \ncoordination by line departments, private providers, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n8.  Despite the improving policy environment, dynamic market-oriented responses are still \nat  an  early  stage.  While  the  availability  of  fertilizer  improved  after  deregulation  of  private \ndistribution, its use remains half the national average, leading to declining soil fertility in large \nareas. Availability and use of improved seeds also remains a constraint, meeting only 25% of \nthe annual replacement needs for food grains. Formal rural credit reaches up to 60% of farm \nhouseholds, but the remainder requires other solutions, such as a group guarantee approach.9 \nAgriculture extension suffers from lack of outreach, calling for improved accountability of public \nextension workers and increased use of private providers and information technology. In output \nmarketing, despite the rapidly expanding transport network,10 marketing chains are fragmented \nwith information dissymmetry, requiring collective approaches and leadership to form value-\nchain networks. In general, local conditions are highly varied. Some areas have progressed \ntowards intensive crop production and diversification, particularly with irrigation and good market \nconnectivity, while subsistence-oriented cropping also prevails in large areas. These conditions \ncall for (i) careful planning of the most suitable production systems for the locality, (ii) concerted \nefforts to facilitate input delivery and output marketing, and (iii) strategic provision of support \nservices. Farmer organizations also need strengthening so that they can drive the process.  \n9.  Irrigation  Infrastructure  and  Management  System.  In  OSG\u2019s  development \nstrategy, development and sound management of irrigation infrastructure in partnership with \nWUAs is recognized as a pathway to productive and high-value agriculture, and poverty \nreduction.  Accordingly,  following  the  NWP  1987  and  2002,  the  OSG  has  progressively \nimproved the policy and institutional framework with the assistance of external financiers, \nincluding  the  World  Bank  and  the  European  Union.  The  specific  reforms  include  (i) \npromulgating the State Water Policy in 1994, which embodies the principles of PIM; (ii) \nadopting the State Water Plan in 2004 to provide a prioritized investment framework; (iii) \nestablishing a legal framework for WUAs with the enactment of the Pani Panchayat Act \n2002;  (iv)  substantially  increasing  the  irrigation  tariff  and  O&M  fund  allocation;  and \n(v) strengthening  the  capacities  of  the  Department  of  Water  Resources  (DOWR)  for \nparticipatory skills and infrastructure development and management.  \n10.  Following this framework, the process of WUA formation, infrastructure improvement, \nand transfer of minor facilities to WUAs was initiated. While all externally assisted projects were \ncompleted by 2005 with a combined coverage of 0.4 million ha of net irrigated area (NIA), the \nOSG maintained the drive and the area under WUA transfer of minor facilities reached 0.9 \nmillion ha by mid-2007. However, this transformation process remains incomplete and needs \n                                                 \n9  OSG has initiated steps to reform its cooperatives credit system with the support of an ADB program loan (ADB. \n2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to India for Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring and Development Program. Manila) as its \nparticipating states.   \n10 OSG is extending all-weather road to unserved habitations with a population of 1,000 or more through a national \nprogram assisted by ADB (ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on \na Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to India for Rural Roads Sector II Investment Program. Manila).  \n ", "4 \ngreater momentum and farmer enthusiasm so that the reform can fully achieve sound sector \noperations. To this end, sufficient institutional development of WUAs and further strengthening \nof the DOWR remain critical.11 Specifically, WUAs need to be empowered as equal partners of \nthe  DOWR,  while  the  DOWR  needs  to  be  transformed  from  an  implementer  of  irrigation \nconstruction  to  an  accountable  service  provider.  An  equally  critical  issue  is  that  existing \ninfrastructure needs not only rehabilitation but also modernization, with clear operational rules \nfor efficient water distribution12 before WUAs can take over O&M. This calls for well-sequenced \ninterventions for participatory planning and WUA strengthening, facility renovation, agricultural \nsupport, and institutionalization of self-sustaining O&M. Opportunities also exist to develop \nWUAs into a platform to drive agricultural development by forming effective links to input supply, \ntechnical support, and marketing. Similarly, the institutional basis for PIM needs to be further \nadvanced, along with the framework for IWRM that needs to guide improved service delivery.  \n11.  Investment  Plan  for  Irrigation  Scheme  Modernization.  In  line  with  the  above \ninitiatives,  the  OSG\u2019s  State  Water  Plan  has  prioritized  improving  the  productivity  and \nsustainability  of  existing  underutilized  irrigation  infrastructure  by  adopting  PIM  with  WUA \ndevelopment as the critical step towards attaining sustainable water resources management. A \nspecific investment plan of $660 million (Appendix 2, Table A2.1) has been prepared by the \nDOWR as a priority program for the 11th FYP. The proposed Investment Program has been \nformulated to implement this plan, covering major and medium-sized irrigation schemes and \nminor lift schemes in the four northern river basins and a part of the Mahanadi River Delta. The \nremaining schemes are implemented with the support of the Government and other external \nfinanciers.13 The Investment Program aims to intensify and diversify agriculture with a focus on \nhigh-value crops. It will also support participatory and integrated basin planning and relevant \ninstitutional development towards IWRM, following the framework of the State Water Plan.  \n12.  Policy and Institutional Development Actions. To support the implementation of the \nInvestment  Plan,  the  OSG  has  taken  initiatives  to  further  improve  policy,  planning,  and \ninstitutional frameworks. First, the revised State Water Policy was adopted in 2007, reaffirming \nthe OSG\u2019s resolve to pursue PIM with full O&M cost recovery by users while initiating specific \nsteps to introduce IWRM. Second, the DOWR is establishing a specialized multidisciplinary \ndirectorate for PIM, with actions developed to improve its business processes and capacities as \na multidisciplinary service-oriented agency. Third, the OSG has taken steps to enhance O&M \nfund allocation complying with the Government\u2019s 12th Finance Commission, and is revising \nwater tariffs for the industry sector to meet the increased allocation. The OSG will also improve \nits management system and take steps to improve cost recovery rates, such as introducing \ndirect links between tariff collection (by the Revenue Department) and fund allocation (by the \nDOWR). Fourth, the OSG is refining the existing WUA legal framework for longer-term tenure, \ninstitutional  continuity,  and  better  representation  of  farmers  in  head,  middle,  and  tail-end \nreaches of irrigation canal systems, as well as women. Finally, following the revised State Water \nPolicy,  the  OSG  is  initiating  consultative  steps  towards  establishing  appropriate  IWRM \ninstitutions and instruments, such as a regulatory commission or authority for water tariff setting \nand water allocation, as well as a pilot river basin organization. (The sector road map and \ninvestment plan are shown in Appendix 2.)  \n                                                 \n11  WUAs are legally authorized to undertake irrigation O&M by receiving funds from DOWR (in return for water tariff \npaid) and collecting fees from members. They may also extend their activities to collective agriculture development \nas a noncommercial undertaking. However, most WUAs remain at an early stage of development with limited \nfinancial and physical assets. The progress is also constrained due to limited support funds being made available.  \n12  Including the provision of (i) sufficient water control structures, appropriately sized outlets, and measuring devices; \nand (ii) equipment, communication systems, and supporting software to support the operational plan. Establishing \nagreed water distribution rules and adopting necessary adjustments after initial operations are also critical.     \n13  A statewide community tank rehabilitation project has been prepared with World Bank assistance.  \n ", "5 \n13.  Lessons Identified. The Investment Program has been prepared with the exploration \nand incorporation of best practices and lessons learned from other Indian states and countries \nof Asia.14 While the performance of PIM projects in India including Orissa is generally deemed \nsuccessful, key lessons include (i) a conducive policy and institutional framework with political \nsupport is essential to improve and sustain irrigation embedding PIM; (ii) sustainable O&M with \nuser financing should be pursued with specific actions to improve the management systems; (iii) \nDOWR\u2019s commitment and capacities to establish PIM and to become a service-oriented agency \nshould  be  deepened  with  appropriate  incentives;  (iv)  stringent  planning  is  needed  to  tap \nmaximum growth potentials with links to input delivery, technical support, and output marketing; \n(v) WUAs need to be developed early in the project cycle with clear targets and continuous \nsupport;  (vi)  critical  attention  is  needed  to  deliver  quality  infrastructure  and  set  up  sound \noperational rules; (vii) field channels should be pursued as an integral part of the program; (viii) \nWUAs are generally willing to expand their tasks beyond irrigation O&M to facilitate collective \nagricultural development; (ix) an effective interagency coordination mechanism should be in \nplace with the involvement of district heads; and (x) with due capacity development, NGOs and \nprivate providers can be used for program delivery such as WUA strengthening and agriculture \nextension. (External assistance and lessons learned are shown in Appendixes 3 and 4.) \n14.  ADB\u2019s Strategy. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for India 2003\u2013200615 expanded \nADB\u2019s operations in agriculture, irrigation, and rural infrastructure as its most important feature \nto address the country\u2019s rural poverty problems and looming water crisis. This was followed by \nsector studies to accumulate a sector knowledgebase and disseminate best practices and \nlessons (footnote 14), based on which opportunities for supporting PIM were identified as a \npriority area of ADB support, given the country\u2019s vast sector needs, both for finance and transfer \nof best practices. The new draft country partnership strategy for India (2008\u20132012) envisages \nenhanced ADB roles in rural infrastructure development for irrigation, water resources, and rural \nmarket  and  transport  infrastructure.  This  follows  the  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP  that  places \nemphasis  on  addressing  the  regional  and  rural\u2013urban  disparities.  Within  this  context,  the \nInvestment Program is needed to institutionalize PIM and to improve irrigation infrastructure, \nthereby promoting intensive and high-value irrigated agriculture in Orissa. With a primary focus \non irrigation infrastructure and its management system, it is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Long-\nterm Strategic Framework,16 Water for All Policy,17 and Water Financing Program 2006\u20132010.18  \n15.  Multitranche  Financing  Facility.  ADB\u2019s  MFF  modality  is  most  appropriate  for  the \nInvestment Program. Building on the progressively developed policy and institutional bases, an \nMFF provides an opportunity for high implementation quality while reflecting further lessons in \nthe implementation design and pursuing further improvement of the institutional basis. These \ncan be undertaken at the time of processing subsequent loans. It also allows flexibility in \ninvestment decision making based on subproject readiness. Higher incentives will be provided \nto the concerned parties to ensure sufficient implementation performance. The MFF also allows \na longer-term partnership with sufficient monitoring of critical institutional development process \nwith  continued  dialogue.  Its  progressive  commitment  structure  also  facilitates  wider  area \ncoverage in the Investment Program design, and hence more significant sector impacts.  \n                                                 \n14  ADB undertook studies on (i) international and Indian best practices on PIM and IWRM, (ii) minor tank irrigation \nsystems in India, (iii) the Government\u2019s priority programs in the irrigation sector, and (iv) agribusiness development. \nIn the meantime, a loan for Chhattisgarh to support minor irrigation infrastructure renovation with PIM was \napproved in 2005, for which project preparatory TA outputs and initial implementation experience were explored.   \n15 ADB. 2003.

Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of the Investment Program will be enhanced rural economic growth and \nreduced poverty in the existing irrigation system areas within four northern river basins and a \npart of the Mahanadi River Delta, and institutionalization of PIM-based agricultural growth. The \noutcome  will  be  enhanced  productivity,  water  use  efficiency,  sustainability  of  irrigated \nagriculture,  and  improved  performance  of  irrigation  service  delivery  and  water  resources \nmanagement with empowered WUAs progressively taking over O&M roles.   \nB.  Outputs \n1.  Part A: Productive and Sustainable Irrigated Agriculture Management \nSystems  \n17.  This component will establish productive and sustainable irrigation systems through \nWUA  strengthening,  renovation  of  irrigation  and  associated  infrastructure,  agriculture  and \nlivelihood support services, and O&M support. The Investment Program will cover six major and \nnine medium-sized existing and low-performing irrigation schemes (having a NIA of 185,000 \nha), and about 1,400 existing community-based minor lift irrigation (MLI) schemes (having a NIA \nof 30,000 ha).19 The following subcomponents are provided, aligned in a step-by-step process \nof implementation. In principle, substantial WUA strengthening and participatory planning will be \npursued up front with performance targets set and achieved before infrastructure is provided.   \na.  Participatory Planning and Water User Association Empowerment  \n18.  Participatory Scheme Planning. Following the planning documents prepared under the \npreceding technical assistance (footnote 1), the Investment Program will support participatory \nfeasibility studies including subproject implementation plans (SIPs) for the irrigation schemes in \nconsultation with the WUAs. The SIP will stipulate specific programs and output targets for the \nscheme while meeting any safeguards requirements. All subprojects will be appraised and \ncleared by the OSG, the Government of India, and ADB prior to their inclusion in the periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) of the MFF tranche.20  \n19.  WUA Micro Planning. For major and medium-sized schemes, the planning process has \ntwo tiers: scheme planning (completed prior to the PFR), and WUA micro planning. The former \nwill provide an overall framework for the scheme, including the main infrastructure, whereas the \nlatter will detail WUA implementation plans for minor infrastructure, command area development \n(CAD), agriculture, livelihood, and O&M. A multidisciplinary team including NGO staff and local \nfacilitators will be designated to prepare the plan with individual WUAs.  \n20.  WUA  Strengthening  and  Empowerment.  The  Investment  Program  will  strengthen \nWUAs to manage planning, construction, and O&M as an equal partner of the DOWR. WUAs \nwill  undertake  effective  organizational,  operational,  resource  mobilization,  and  networking \nfunctions as a platform to advance the development of irrigated agriculture. Specific targets will \nbe set and achieved, including membership enrollment of more than 70% of farmers, election \nand formation of an executive committee and subcommittees, and implementation of routine \nO&M. Upon achieving the targets, implementation of the micro plan activities will be started. \n                                                 \n19 It will also include other major and medium-sized schemes that are functional but require WUA strengthening and \nminor facility refinement, and minor creek irrigation schemes, covering an additional 20,000 ha. \n20 Excluding the MLI schemes where subprojects are implemented in a process-type approach.  \n ", "7 \n    b.  Irrigation and Associated Infrastructure Development \n21.  Irrigation and Associated Infrastructure. The Investment Program will renovate and \nextend infrastructure21\u2014including repair of reservoirs, renovation of head and cross regulators, \ncanals, and ancillary facilities; and minor drainage works\u2014along with the community-based \nminor lift irrigation facilities. For major and medium-sized schemes, main facilities requiring early \ncompletion to ensure timely delivery of benefits across the command area are implemented \nfollowing the SIPs,22 whereas other facilities are implemented upon achievement of the WUA \ndevelopment targets. Scheme renovation will upgrade the system with sufficient water control \nstructures  and  adequately  sized  outlets  to  support  improved  distribution  efficiency. \nCommunications equipment and software will be provided to ensure sound operation at the \nscheme and individual WUA levels. During the process, WUAs will be made aware of seasonal \nwater  entitlements  with  the  provision  of  measuring  devices  to  monitor  and  coordinate  the \ndelivery of the set discharges. Construction quality will be monitored by the WUAs. WUAs will \nalso be involved in the implementation of the minor works within their constituencies.  \n22.  Command Area Development and Conjunctive Use. The Investment Program will \nemphasize the placing of field channel systems and the strengthening of WUA capacities for on-\nfarm  water  management  as  essential  conditions  to  attain  high  water-use  efficiency  and \nintensification and diversification of cropping. Specific plans will be laid out in the micro plan. \nThe concerned WUAs will implement the minor CAD facilities. With the use of field channel \nsystems,  conjunctive  use  of  groundwater  will  be  promoted  for  dry  season  cropping,  with \ngroundwater surveys, information campaigns for private investments in groundwater irrigation, \nand provision of pilot wells targeted to marginal farmer groups in the canal tail end areas.23   \n    c.  Agriculture and Allied Sector Support, and Livelihood Enhancement \n23.  Agriculture  and  Horticulture  Development.  The  Investment  Program  will  support \nagriculture and horticulture development with WUA capacity development as a platform to plan, \ncoordinate, and arrange for the program implementation. Specific programs will be prepared in \nconformity with the existing district agricultural plans and stipulated in the WUA micro plans. \nThis subcomponent will cover (i) production systems including farmer field schools for crop \nintensification and diversification, soil nutrient management, seed multiplication, and integrated \npest management; and (ii) formation of links with input suppliers and marketing chains with \nmarket intelligence, such as catalogues for existing organizations and their programs.24 New \ntechnologies and approaches (e.g., system of rice intensification, participatory variety selection, \nand  farmer  producer  companies)  will  be  introduced  and  expanded  upon  demonstration  of \npositive impacts. Participatory technology development of other innovations (e.g., aerobic rice \nand rice\u2013fish integrated farming) will also be implemented in partnership with local research \nagencies. These will be delivered by the resource persons of the line departments, the private \nsector,  or  NGOs  arranged  through  the  implementation  team.  WUAs  will  sustain  activities \nthrough their trained extensionists who will form regular links with the relevant institutions.25  \n                                                 \n21  All schemes need to renovate the existing infrastructure, except for one major scheme, Mahanadi Chitropala Island \nIrrigation (MCII) scheme, which will expand the existing canal system to create an additional 6,000 ha of irrigated \narea to complete its original scope.  \n22  That is, in parallel to the WUA micro planning and strengthening process.  \n23  CAD will be primarily implemented through existing government programs, whereas provision under the Investment \nProgram will also be kept for support where government programs are not readily made available. \n24 Resources for existing state and other programs will be sought prior to accessing Investment Program funding.   \n25  Demonstration works will be undertaken with a focus on the land plots of marginal farmers.  \n ", "8 \n24.  Livelihood  Enhancement  Support.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  support  the \nformation  of  links  between  the  vulnerable  groups  within  the  WUA  area  and  the  existing \nprograms for poverty reduction, such as forming self-help groups and facilitating delivery of rural \ncredit and training for income generation. While primary efforts will be made to deliver the \nagriculture and horticulture support services to these vulnerable groups, provisions targeted for \nskills  development  of  these  groups\u2014such  as  fisheries,  fodder  planting  along  the  water \nchannels, livestock, organic fertilizer production, group cultivation through leasing of land, and \ncommunity-based participatory works26\u2014are also included in the Investment Program. \n    d.  Sustainable Operation and Maintenance System \n25.  Minor Facilities. The Investment Program will institutionalize sustainable O&M for the \nirrigation schemes. At present, the facilities are classified into those managed jointly by the \nDOWR and WUAs (project committees at main canal level, and distributary committees at \nsecondary canal level), and minor facilities for which O&M is transferred to WUAs. Under the \nInvestment Program, WUA capacities to sustain minor facilities will be set up first. This will be \nattained by forming water management subcommittees and preparing the O&M plans during the \nmicro plan stage, and engaging subcommittees in implementing the works. Upon completion of \nthe civil works, training will be provided to (i) prepare and implement operational plans; and \n(ii) undertake joint walk-throughs of canals to identify and plan maintenance works. For major \nand medium-sized schemes, WUAs will implement the maintenance plan with grants provided \nby the DOWR. If grants are insufficient, WUAs will mobilize funds from their members. As to the \nminor lift schemes, WUAs will mobilize all resources from members to implement the plan.27  \n26.  Main  and  Secondary  Facilities.  At  the  higher  levels  of  major  and  medium-sized \nschemes, participatory joint management systems will be established between the DOWR and \nthe WUA committees, which will jointly prepare and implement system operational plans on a \nseasonal basis. Maintenance plans will also be prepared through joint canal walk-throughs and \nthe demands from lower-tier WUAs, and implemented with the allocated funds from the DOWR. \nGuidelines for O&M performance monitoring, planning, and fund allocation will be established to \nguide the process, along with a scheme-wise management information system (MIS). Over the \nyears, the Investment Program will pursue further O&M transfer of these larger facilities to the \nWUAs, leaving the role of the DOWR in these schemes to bulk water delivery.  \n2.  Part B: Institutional Strengthening and Project Management \n27.  This component comprises (i) institutional strengthening for PIM and IWRM, and (ii) \nInvestment Program management. Necessary hardware and software (civil works for office \nrefurbishment and extension, vehicles and equipment, consultants, and incremental operational \ncosts) will be provided to support these activities.28  \n    a.  Institutional Strengthening \n28.  Participatory Irrigation Management. This subcomponent will establish self-sustaining \nmechanisms for developing and delivering accountable irrigation services with the strengthening \nof the relevant institutions. Specifically, this will include (i) putting into operation the new PIM-\n                                                 \n26 A separate program to develop WUA capacities to enhance the livelihoods of the poor is also being prepared for \npossible Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction funding.  \n27 Responsibilities for fee collection have also been transferred to minor lift WUAs, who are also responsible for all \nrepairs and future replacement of assets. They will also establish and build up a reserve fund to meet the purpose. \n28A capacity-development plan applied to the relevant institutions has been prepared (Supplementary Appendix B). \n ", "9 \nCAD directorate of the DOWR; (ii) establishing upgraded O&M guidelines and the MIS for \nscheme O&M performance monitoring and planning; (iii) operationalizing a third-party internal \ntechnical auditing using externally hired experts; (iv) developing and delivering training for staff \nand WUAs;29 (v) undertaking information, education, and communication campaigns for PIM; \n(vi) advising on implementing the institutional actions specified in the road map (Appendix 2); \nand (vii) setting up staff incentive and performance evaluation systems to internalize PIM. \nOverall performance and achievements will be measured through WUA satisfaction surveys at \nthe subproject level. The Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI) will be strengthened \nwith reforms with (i) upgrading of training programs, (ii) developing up-to-date knowledge base \nlearning from best practices; and (iii) twinning with a reputed international institute.30  \n29.  Integrated Water Resources Management. In accordance with the road map, this \nsubcomponent will support (i) studies to assess appropriate IWRM functions and institutional \narrangements for setting up a commission for water tariff fixation and other regulatory functions \nsuch as water allocation and entitlement; (ii) preparation of multisector river basin plans with \nestablishment of participatory river basin organizations, initially in the Baitarani River basin as a \npilot; (iii) strengthening of the hydrological database and decision support systems; and (iv) staff \ntraining on IWRM, basin planning, and associated analytical methodologies.  \n    b.  Project Management  \n30.  This  subcomponent  will  operate  the  program  management  system  through  a \nmultidisciplinary project management unit (PMU) and subproject implementation offices (SIOs) \ncomprising the OSG and outsourced experts, consultants, and NGOs. The Investment Program \nwill be implemented with a participatory decision-making system with WUAs. The WUAs are \ntrained to jointly make decisions with SIOs on the subproject planning, implementation, and \nO&M, based on which specific works will be implemented by the responsible organizations, and \nmonitored by the WUAs. This will be supported by (i) the project-specific MIS and quality control \nsystem that ensures due recording and reporting at SIO on institutional, physical, financial and \nother progress against the set targets specified in the SIPs; and (ii) regular PMU\u2013SIO review \nmeetings. This subcomponent will also support the consulting services for preparing further \nschemes for the subsequent tranches, and implementation performance review.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n31.  The Investment Program will introduce effective irrigation service delivery to enhance \nefficiency, productivity, and sustainability in water use by implementing key policy principles, \nfurthering reforms for improved sector governance, and by incorporating the following lessons:  \n(i)  The Investment Program will implement the key principles of the NWP 2002 and \nState Water Policy 2007, in particular by making PIM fully operational in the low-\nperforming irrigation schemes, with associated institutional reforms owned by the \nOSG, which are in line with ADB\u2019s Water Policy (footnote 17).  \n(ii)  Its  components  are  designed  consistently  with  step-by-step  implementation \nprocedures  to  establish  PIM-based  productive  agriculture,  incorporating  best \npractices collected through national and international studies (Appendix 4).   \n                                                 \n29The  specific  training  subjects  include  participatory  planning,  WUA  development,  design  and  construction \nmanagement, quality control, O&M, PIM, resettlement, environmental management, and support services. \n30 WALMI is an autonomous training and research institute for PIM and IWRM under the DOWR. Subject to the \nimplementation of the reforms for higher autonomy and staff quality, WALMI will provide necessary technical and \ninstitutional backup and training support for PIM and IWRM. The Investment Program will consider providing a \ncorpus fund in its subsequent loan by establishing an arrangement acceptable to ADB.  \n ", "10 \n(iii)  In  contrast  to  conventional  projects,  the  program  has  a  specific  focus  on \nextending field channel networks (to convert field-to-field flood irrigation into a \nmore  efficient  plot-to-plot  irrigation  through  channel  turn-outs)  and  promoting \nconjunctive use of groundwater, as essential elements for improving water-use \nefficiency, crop intensification, and diversification.  \n(iv)  It will empower WUAs to progressively take on O&M and implementation roles, \nwith their capacity developed to facilitate links and bargaining power in input \ndelivery,  technology  extension,  and  product  marketing  to  achieve  productive \nagriculture.  \n(v)  The efforts of institutionalizing PIM is ongoing as a national priority, yet the \nprocess  is  still  at  an  intermediate  stage  and  needs  to  be  strengthened  by \nincorporating lessons. The MFF modality allows flexibility to refine the process, \nand is suited to pursue the agenda with progressively improved arrangements. \nD.  Program Investment and Financing Plan \n32.

To finance the investment, the Government has requested financing of up to $188.2 \nmillion  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  through  the  MFF  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nMainstreaming  the  Multitranche  Financing  Facility31 approved  in  July  2008.  The  MFF  may \nextend four (or more if needed) loans (or Projects) to implement the Investment Program, \nsubject to the submission of the related PFR by the Government and the signing of the related \nloan agreements. The Government has entered into a framework financing agreement (FFA) \nwith ADB in the form attached, which satisfies the requirements set forth in the said policy \n(footnote 31). All of the provisions of the ordinary loan regulations applicable to the London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  made  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources, dated 1 July 2001, would apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2008.

Project 1. In line with the FFA, the Government has submitted the first PFR in the format \nattached. Project 1 is estimated to cost the equivalent of $67.5 million (Table 3). This includes \ntaxes and duties of $3.3 million equivalent to be financed by the Government. It will cover the \ninfrastructure of one major and three medium-sized schemes32 appraised prior to the PFR \nsubmission,  and  650  minor  lift  schemes  through  a  process  approach.  It  will  also  cover \nnonphysical  subcomponents  of  the  Investment  Program  for  the  first  2  years  of  its \nimplementation. A loan of $47.2 million has been requested under the first PFR from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to cover part of the cost of Project 1. The ADB loan will have a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 7 years, with interest rate to be determined according to \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other \nterms and conditions as agreed in the FFA, and the loan and project agreements.33 Detailed \ncost estimates and a financing plan for Project 1 are also shown in Appendix 5.   \nTable 3: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan for Project 1 ($ million) \nProject Components ADB OSG WUAs Total\nI.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Investment Program Management34 \n35.  Organization  and  Management.  The  DOWR  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the \nInvestment  Program.  A  state  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  agriculture  production \ncommissioner or an officer not below the rank of secretary has been set up for policy guidance \nand interdepartmental coordination. Its implementation institutionalizes effective mechanisms to \nplan,  improve,  and  manage  irrigation  systems  through  the  DOWR\u2019s  regular  setup,  with \noutsourcing  to  the  private  sector  and  NGOs.  The  DOWR  has  established  a  permanent \nmultidisciplinary PIM-CAD directorate to monitor, guide, implement, and coordinate PIM and \nrelated integrated development services for the entire state. A PMU has been established in the \ndirectorate with the assignment of a full-time program director with the rank of chief engineer. \nThe PMU has a multidisciplinary structure comprising staff from the DOWR, line departments, \nand  those  recruited  from  the  market, 35  and  is  assisted  by  consultants  for  institutional \nstrengthening and project management (ISPM). The organization structure is in Appendix 6.  \n36.  In  Investment  Program  implementation,  the  PMU  will  (i)  prepare  an  overall \nimplementation plan and annual project budget; (ii) coordinate with other departments; (iii) guide \nthe  feasibility  studies  and  endorse  subproject  appraisal  reports  including  safeguards \ndocuments;  (iv)  monitor  and  guide  the  activities  of  the  SIOs  on  subproject  planning, \nimplementation, and O&M; (v) manage and guide safeguards action plans and implementation; \n(vi) monitor project progress and evaluate project benefits and social and environmental impacts \nwith the MIS; (vii) arrange necessary training programs for staff and other providers; (viii) \nmanage  procurement,  consulting  and  NGO  services,  and  loan  disbursement;  (ix) maintain \nfinancial accounts; and (x) prepare periodic implementation progress reports.  \n37.  To implement a total of 15 major and medium-sized schemes, 12 SIOs will be set up in \nthe existing DOWR field offices enhanced with cells for WUA support and CAD. Each SIO will \nbe headed by a subproject manager with the rank of superintending engineer (or executive \nengineer for medium-sized schemes). It will be assisted by an NGO team led by a team \ncoordinator  and  including  mobile  NGO  support  service  teams  (comprising  experts  on \ninstitutional development, water management, and agriculture) and locally engaged community \norganizers. The SIOs will (i) prepare an annual work plan endorsed by the PMU; (ii) establish \nand operate (a) coordination systems through a district coordination committee headed by a \ndistrict  head,  (b)  a  participatory  decision-making  with  WUAs  on  subproject  implementation \nmatters, and (c) reporting systems on physical, institutional, and other progress and impacts; (iii) \nprovide inputs to subproject planning and design processes; (iv) undertake WUA strengthening \nand micro planning; (v) implement safeguards actions following the relevant plans;36 (vi) execute \ncivil works; (vii) coordinate and/or implement support services for agriculture and livelihoods; \n(viii) manage subproject O&M in collaboration with WUAs while ensuring the capacities and \nresources for the latter; and (ix) arrange training programs for staff, NGOs, and WUAs.  \n38.  For  implementing  community-based  minor  lift  schemes,  the  PMU  will  have  a  lift \nirrigation cell comprising an engineer in lift irrigation, an economist, and three mobile planning teams \n                                                 \n34  Implementation arrangements have drawn lessons from the models followed in Orissa, other Indian states, and \nAsian countries, and incorporated necessary improvements such as sufficiency in WUA institutional support, \nsoundness in process management and quality control, and effective use of outsourcing.  \n35 Including project planning, design, lift irrigation, implementation, quality control, WUA mobilization, agriculture and \nallied sectors, economics, environment, resettlement and rehabilitation, and vulnerable groups.  \n36  The deputy subproject manager will be assigned as chief officer for environmental management, resettlement, and \nvulnerable peoples to undertake the required tasks through the designated SIO staff.  \n ", "13 \nincluding a lift irrigation engineer and an agricultural specialist. They will be entrusted with \nprocurement of equipment and goods, and subproject feasibility studies. At the field level, up to \nfour mobile SIOs will be set up, comprising a PIM specialist (assigned as subproject manager), \nirrigation engineer, agriculture engineer, work inspector, and monitoring and evaluation officer. \nThe lift irrigation cell and SIO staff are primarily engaged from a local firm as implementation \nconsultants, who will also be associated with local NGOs to mobilize field facilitators to support \ninstitution building and coordination for program delivery on the ground.  \n39.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Implementation Procedure. All subprojects to be \nincluded under the Investment Program will meet the selection criteria shown in Appendix 7, \nincluding  (i)  water  availability;  (ii)  technical,  social,  institutional,  and  economic  feasibility; \n(iii) insignificant  social  and  environmental  impacts;  (iv)  compliance  with  safeguards \nrequirements;  (v)  endorsement  by  WUAs  including  the  set  beneficiary  contribution \nrequirements; and (vi) proposal clearance by the Government as applicable. Implementation \nprocedures for individual subprojects are outlined in Appendix 8.  \n40.  Investment  Program  Management.  The  five  major  and  medium-sized  subprojects \nproposed for project 1 were studied under the TA (footnote 1) and appraised by the OSG, the \nGovernment, and ADB, along with two sample minor lift irrigation schemes. The PMU, with the \nsupport of the ISPM consultants, will prepare further subprojects proposed for the subsequent \nprojects. At that time the PMU will also assess the implementation progress and performance of \nthe ongoing project(s). This will cover the policy and institutional actions, progress in achieving \nthe  capacity  development  and  other  targets,  lessons,  and  compliance  in  safeguards \nmanagement.  On  the  basis  of  these,  specific  measures  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of \ninterventions will be identified for incorporation into the subsequent project. ADB will provide \nadvice to the OSG and the Government while the work is being carried out. After ADB appraisal, \nthe Government will submit a PFR of the project, together with the appraisal reports of new \nsubprojects and the Investment Program performance assessment report.  \n41.  Sustainable O&M. In Orissa, water tariffs are collected by the Revenue Department and \nallocated to individual schemes and WUAs by the DOWR from OSG funds, except for minor lift \nschemes, where responsibility for fee collection is given to WUAs. The OSG has a policy of full \nmaintenance funding with user financing, including (i) allocating O&M funds complying with the \nGovernment\u2019s Finance Commission, and (ii) recovering the cost through tariffs levied to users. \nHowever, there are still gaps. Regarding fund allocation, while the OSG has adopted the 12th \nFinance Commission report and raised the allocation to Rs600/ha from Rs450/ha in FY2005, \nthe funds available to DOWR for works (Rs300/ha) is less than the norm (Rs480/ha) due to the \nhigher establishment cost of the DOWR. As to cost recovery, efforts to increase water tariffs for \nindustries is in progress to fully meet the increase of allocation in FY2005.37 However, actual \ncollection for irrigation remains at about 50% of the requirements, due to large gaps between \nthe irrigated areas claimed by the DOWR and certified by the Revenue Department (40%), and \nshortfalls  in  collection  in  the  certified  areas  (10%).  This  reflects  the  poor  performance  of \nirrigation water delivery. There is no link between the tariffs collected and funds allocated to \nindividual schemes at present, thereby providing WUAs little incentives for higher payments.  \n42.   To sustain O&M, the OSG is committed to revising funds allocation following future \nFinance Commission reports, and increasing water tariffs including irrigation (with the progress \nof the present efforts to enhance system productivity and farmer incomes with PIM). The DOWR \nis also rationalizing the nontechnical field staff (taking the bulk  of establishment  costs) with \n                                                 \n37  Irrigation tariff rates in Orissa are generally at par with other Indian states, whereas industrial rates are lower than \nthe national average, based on which the OSG is now pursuing the tariff increase in industries.  \n ", "14 \nnatural attrition. In the context of the Investment Program, the DOWR will (i) establish a sound \nMIS for O&M monitoring and planning, (ii) introduce a needs- and performance-based allocation \nsystem, (iii) operationalize participatory decision making for fund allocation of O&M in each \nscheme,  and  (iv)  ensure  WUAs  address  any  shortfalls  through  their  own  cash  or  labor \ncontribution. To reduce the shortfalls in cost recovery, the DOWR will (i) enhance the certified \nirrigated areas with improved irrigation, (ii) involve WUAs in the collection process, and (iii) \nintroduce direct links between the O&M funds allocated and the water tariffs submitted. An \nappropriate regulatory mechanism for the fixing of water tariffs will also be assessed.  \n2.  Implementation Period \n43.  The Investment Program will be implemented over 8 years with four provisional projects \n(Appendix 9) from April 2009 to March 2017, with funds utilized up to September 2017. Project 1 \ncomprises mainly consulting and NGO services, equipment, and civil works for two major and \nthree medium-sized irrigation schemes, and about 650 minor lift irrigation schemes. These \nsubprojects  were  selected  based  on  implementation  readiness  and  their  representative \ncharacter.38 The ISPM support will continue over the entire period, and emphasis is placed on \nachieving the progressive reform milestones as set forth in the sector road map (Appendix 2).  \n3.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n44.  Procurement. Procurement to be financed from the ADB loans under the MFF will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). International competitive bidding (ICB) will be followed for civil work contracts costing \n$10 million or more. Civil works contracts costing less than $10 million will be procured through \nnational competitive bidding (NCB). ADB standard bidding documents with post-qualification \nunder the two-envelope system will be adopted. In addition, small community works costing less \nthan $10,000 may be directly contracted with the concerned WUA that has participated in the \nplanning and design and will take over O&M.39 In procuring goods and related services, ICB \nprocedures will be used if the estimated cost is at least $1 million and NCB procedures if the \ncost is between $0.1 million and $1 million, and shopping if the estimated contract amount is \nless than $0.1 million. The detailed procurement plan for Project 1 is shown in Appendix 10.  \n45.  Consulting Services. The Investment Program provides for the following consultancy \nservices: (i) ISPM consultancy including program administration (including the institutionalization \nof the PIM process and steps for IWRM, and monitoring and evaluation) and subsequent Project \npreparation (including safeguards aspects) (158 person-months of international and 738 person-\nmonths  of  national  consultants);  and  (ii)  implementation  support  consultancy  for  minor  lift \nirrigation schemes (1,080 person-months of national consultants). NGOs will be engaged to \nsupport WUA strengthening, and to facilitate land acquisition and resettlement. The PMU will \nselect and engage the consultants and NGOs using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures. In addition, NGOs, independent agencies, institutions, and resource persons will be \nhired for monitoring and program delivery activities such as training. WALMI will be engaged \nthrough direct contracting to undertake specialized training and action research for PIM and \n                                                 \n38 The major and medium-sized subprojects will be implemented over 6 years (except for O&M that extends to year \n8).They are also divided into three tranches, broadly comprising (i) WUA strengthening (phase 1) and civil works \ncanal systems; (ii) WUA strengthening (phase 2) and remaining minor works such as command area development, \nagriculture, and O&M support; and (iii) all remaining activities. The division into separate phases will facilitate the \nincorporation of findings and lessons based on the performance evaluation of the preceding phase.  \n39 This will contribute to stronger ownership by the WUA to take over O&M. In addition, the community participation \nmodality will also be undertaken for civil works and procurement of goods and services valued less than $10,000 \nduring the first project as a pilot, with procedures and arrangements acceptable to ADB.  \n ", "15 \nIWRM.40 All consultants, NGOs, other institutions, and resource persons will be hired following \nthe ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).41  \n46.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. The Government has requested \nadvance contracting for consultant and NGO engagement and for procurement of goods and \ncivil works, and retroactive financing under the MFF. ADB Management has agreed to seek \nBoard approval for retroactive financing provided that the total eligible expenditure under such \nfinancing will not exceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loans, and must have \nbeen incurred not more than 12 months before the signing of the relevant legal agreements. \nThe  Government  has  been  informed  that  the  approval  of  advance  action  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance the relevant projects under the Investment Program. \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n47.  Disbursement of loan proceeds under the MFF will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Each loan under the MFF will \nhave its own imprest account in the Reserve Bank of India. The state, through the DOWR, may \nestablish a second-generation imprest account (SGIA) for each loan in a current account with a \ncommercial bank. The DOWR will be responsible for administering and managing the imprest \naccount and the SGIA will be equivalent to 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the \nrelevant  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  Individual  payments  under  the  statement  of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedure will be $100,000. \n5.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n48.  The  Government  and  OSG  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, implementation of the Investment Program shall adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy. ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Investment Program. In this \nregard,  investigation  of  government  officials,  if  any,  would  be  requested  by  ADB  to  be \nundertaken  by  the  Government.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n49.  Good governance is an essential element for ensuring and sustaining the intended \nbenefits  from  irrigation  infrastructure  renovation  with  PIM.  In  this  context,  ADB  has  also \nassessed the financial management system of the DOWR.42 The Investment Program has \nincorporated  measures  for  ensuring  accountability  and  transparency,  with  a  pursuit  of \nparticipatory management of processes and outputs with quality control mechanisms (Appendix \n8, Table A8). Specifically, subprojects are prepared by setting out clear input and output targets \nin SIPs and WUA micro plans, and progressively implemented by confirming that the set targets \nare achieved at each stage, including up-front strengthening of WUAs. WUAs are empowered to \nparticipate in all decision making, such as endorsing micro plans and periodic work plans. \nProgram expenditures including the civil work scope, quantity, cost, and contractors will be  \n                                                 \n40  WALMI is an autonomous body under the DOWR and a sole agency designated for in-house training for OSG staff, \nproviders, and WUAs on PIM and associated research. Their engagement is critical to permanently institute PIM.     \n41 Outline terms of reference for the consultancy services and NGOs are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n42  Shown in Supplementary Appendix F. \n ", "16 \nposted at the subproject sites, which will be monitored by trained WUA members and quality \nmonitors of the consultants. With awareness campaigns, grievance reporting and redressal \nmechanisms will be operated through grievance officers. In addition, the DOWR will (i) annually \nundertake, through its internal audit wing, full financial audit of SIOs and the PMU, inspecting all \nfinancial  transactions;  and  (ii)  establish  an  internal  third-party  technical  audit  mechanism \nthrough DOWR\u2019s newly created quality control cell, with the support of the ISPM consultants.    \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n50.  The DOWR, through the PMU, will establish and maintain separate records for works, \ngoods, and services financed out of loan proceeds. The DOWR will also maintain separate \nproject accounts according to generally acceptable accounting principles for all expenditures \nincurred under the MFF and the Projects, whether out of loan proceeds or other sources. The \nDOWR  will  record  in  a  transparent  manner  all  funds  received  from  the  OSG,  ADB,  and \nbeneficiaries.  Detailed  consolidated  annual  project  accounts  as  maintained  by  the  DOWR \nthrough the PMU will be audited by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and \nterms of reference are acceptable to ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the \nend of the fiscal year. The annual audit report will include the audit of the imprest account, the \nSGIA, and the SOE procedure, and will include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan \nproceeds, the operation of the SGIA, and compliance with SOE procedures and loan covenants. \nThe DOWR has been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy regarding the delayed submission of audits \nand the requirements for a satisfactory and acceptable audit of accounts.  \n7.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  The DOWR will establish an investment program and road map performance monitoring \nsystem acceptable to ADB within 3 months of the effectiveness of the first loan. The system will \nfirst  select  a  set  of  results-based  performance  monitoring  indicators  relating  to  physical \nimplementation,  institutional  development,  and  socioeconomic  and  other  conditions \n(disaggregated into gender and other social classes), including those set out in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). The DOWR will establish baseline data within 6 months of \nthe date the first Project takes effect. Following that, the DOWR will conduct annual surveys \nthrough the consultants and NGOs, and update the OSG and ADB on the progress against \neach indicator. The DOWR will also provide the Government and ADB with quarterly progress \nreports in the format to be attached with the MFF administration memorandum, within 30 days \nof the end of each quarter. The report will cover the indicators as specified in the performance \nmonitoring  system,  and  recommendations  for  enhancing  the  effectiveness  of  the \nimplementation. The monitoring report will also be used for shaping the subprojects to be \ndeveloped for succeeding PFRs and loan tranches. Prior to submitting individual PFRs, a report \nwill also be prepared to review program progress and performance (para. 40). A further detailed \nstudy will be conducted prior to the midterm review. Within 3 months of physical completion of \nany loan under the MFF, the OSG will submit to ADB a project completion report. Within 3 \nmonths of the completion of the MFF, the OSG will submit to ADB a program completion report. \n8.  Investment Program Review \n52.  The  Investment  Program\u2019s  performance  will  be  reviewed  monthly  at  the  field  level \nthrough regular SIO\u2013WUA meetings where the progress of field activities will be assessed, and \nwork plans for the subsequent period decided. The PMU will also organize PMU\u2013SIO review \nmeetings, which will be reflected in the quarterly progress reports. At the country level, progress \nis to be reviewed by tripartite project review meetings chaired by the Government and attended  \n \n ", "17 \nby the DOWR and ADB. ADB will undertake Investment Program review twice a year, covering \nthe  performance  of  the  DOWR  and  other  institutions,  loan  covenants,  and  physical  and \nnonphysical progress of implementation. Prior to the submission of individual PFRs, a detailed \nreview  of  the  Investment  Program  performance  will  also  be  undertaken.  A comprehensive \nmidterm review will be done in year 4 (possibly coinciding with the review of the draft PFR for \nthe third project) to evaluate the progress of road map actions, performance of the Investment \nProgram institutions, and of all process and output indicators, and future implementation plans. \n9.  Project Readiness \n53.  In response to the need for seamlessly taking the remaining preparatory steps and to \nlaunch Investment Program activities after the completion of the project preparatory TA,  a \ncomponent TA project under a TA cluster was provided to the OSG from September 2007 to \nJune 2008. 43 It supported (i) initiating steps for institutional reform actions for PIM and IWRM in \nthe road map; (ii) establishment of PIM\u2013CAD directorate, the PMU, and SIOs; (iii) preparation of \ntraining materials and staff training; (iv) preparation of implementation manuals; (v) feasibility \nstudies of subprojects for the second PFR; (vi) pre-construction activities for the subprojects \nincluded in project 1; and (vii) advance recruitment of consultants and NGOs.  \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n54.  A TA for institutional strengthening for IWRM will be provided in combination to the \nInvestment Program. To be provided as a part of the subcomponent for promoting IWRM (para \n29), it aims to support OSG to initiate specific steps towards establishing and operationalizing \nIWRM at state and selected river basin levels44 with stakeholder consultation and awareness, \nand capacity building of the concerned organizations. The total TA cost is $313,000. MTFWFPF \nwill finance $250,000 of the TA cost on a grant basis to be administered by ADB. OSG will \nfinance the remaining cost of $63,000 (in-kind support).45  \nV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Impacts \n55.  The Investment Program will renovate and extend 185,000 ha of major and medium-\nsized irrigation systems and 30,000 ha of community-based minor lift irrigation systems, which \nare  currently  low-performing,  potentially  benefiting  about  1.7  million  people.  The  main \nquantifiable benefits will be the increased agriculture production brought about by reliable water \nsupply and expansion of irrigated areas in the kharif (monsoon), rabi (winter), and summer \nseasons through renovated irrigation infrastructure and improved operations of the reservoirs \nand water distribution networks including field channels. The generated increased labor demand \nwill  particularly  benefit  the  poor.  Major  quantifiable  benefits  are  shown  in  Appendix  1. \nNonquantifiable benefits include the operation of sound irrigation service delivery systems with \nPIM, improved sector governance pursued through progressive institutional reform actions, and \nfollow-on impacts on nonfarm sectors associated with increased agriculture production.  \n56.  Economic and financial impacts were analyzed for two major schemes (in the Mahanadi \nRiver Delta), three medium-sized schemes, and two sample minor lift systems (in the northern  \n                                                 \n43 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for Project Processing and Capacity Development. Manila. The TA was \nfinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom and administered by ADB. The total cost of the component TA \nwas $1.875 million, of which $1.5 million was financed by the Government of the United Kingdom.   \n44 Including a pilot river basin organization in the Baitarani River basin.  \n45  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 January 2008. The detailed \nactivities, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and financing plan are available as Supplementary \nAppendix G. \n ", "18 \nbasins), which are included in the first PFR (summarized in Appendix 11).46 All have year-round \nirrigation opportunities. Cropping intensities will increase from 165% to 173% for the major \nrenovation scheme and from 128% to 183% for the major extension scheme, by 20%\u201335% for \nmedium-sized schemes from the present level (125%\u2013150%), and up to 220%\u2013230% for minor \nlift schemes through full operation of the pumps. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR), \nestimated by incorporating the yield increase and modest crop diversification observed in similar \ninterventions, is 18.8% for the major extension scheme, 19.7%\u201322.7% for major and medium-\nsized renovation schemes, and 30.1% and 38.2% for the two minor lift schemes. Sensitivity \nanalyses to test the impacts of a range of risks, including adverse changes in investment costs, \noutput prices, and yields, showed that project returns are generally robust. The greatest risk \nappears to be reduction of crop prices, but even in this case a drop of 31% in the price of non-\ncereals will still produce an EIRR of 12% in the subproject with the lowest EIRR. \n57.  The OSG will bear most of the investment costs in line with the State Water Policy 2007, \nwhile seeking farmer contributions of 5% of the cost of minor facilities to be managed by WUAs, \n10% for CAD, and 20% for minor lift works. For O&M, the OSG collects the set water tariff for \nthe major and medium-sized schemes and allocates funds to individual schemes, while O&M \nincluding fee collection is also transferred to the WUAs for minor lift schemes. The investment \ncontribution remains at about 6%\u201315% of incremental income for major and medium-sized \nschemes and 25%\u201335% for minor lift schemes, whereas the O&M contribution will be at 3%\u20136% \nof incremental income for major and medium schemes and 9%\u201317% for minor lift schemes.  \nB.  Households and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n58.  The  Investment  Program  will  have  positive  poverty  reduction  impacts  on  income, \nemployment, and food security, particularly for marginal farmers (those having less than 1 ha of \nland). The poverty ratio in the scheme areas is highly variable: 22% for major renovation \nschemes,  37%  for  the  major  extension  scheme  (i.e.,  presently  non-irrigated)  areas  of  the \nMahanadi River Delta, 35%\u201369% for the three medium-sized schemes, and 6% and 40% for the \ntwo sample minor lift scheme areas.47 Anticipated increases in incomes for marginal farmers are \nin the ranges of 45% and 95% for the major renovation and major extension schemes, 60%\u2013\n80% for the medium-sized schemes, and 70% and 105% for the two minor lift schemes. The \nbenefit will be higher for presently non-irrigated areas, where the incidence of poverty is higher \ncompared with the areas with higher, albeit unreliable, irrigation access.  \nC.  Social and Gender Development Strategy \n59.  The Investment Program will primarily focus on the modernization of existing irrigation \nschemes.  As  such,  it  will  have  beneficial  social  impacts  for  the  general  population. \nNevertheless, it is erroneous to assume that physical improvement will induce the DOWR and \nWUAs  to  manage  the  infrastructure  efficiently  and  equitably.  The  Investment  Program  will \ntherefore place strategic emphasis on beneficiary participation with due attention to the diversity \nof their interests and possible vulnerability (e.g., farmers in the tail-end reaches of the canals) \nunder the framework of the WUAs. The strategy has four levels, including (i) policy measures to \nequalize opportunities and access, including the refinement of the WUA Act to support equal \nrepresentation of head, middle, and tail reach farmers and increased participation of vulnerable \ngroups including women; (ii) WUA capacity enhancement to ensure sound governance including \nparticipatory decision making and equal water distribution; (iii) specific actions and programs \n                                                 \n46  Details are shown in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n47 The low level of poverty in one of the lift schemes is related to its close vicinity to a national highway and urban \nareas, and diversification of high-value crops with a pump providing irrigation in part of the command area.   \n ", "19 \ntargeting vulnerable groups including women in order to establish links to the existing poverty \nreduction programs (such as self-help groups); and (iv) compliance with social safeguards \nmeasures. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n60.  The Investment Program\u2019s gender action plan48 includes (i) creating a staff position in \nthe DOWR PIM\u2013CAD directorate to look after social and vulnerable groups; (ii) developing \ntraining programs for program staff to enhance gender participation; (iii) increasing women \nengaged as field implementation team members (towards 20% of total), with increased female \nstaff in the DOWR; (iv) promoting women representatives elected to WUAs  (preferably towards \n33% of total) following the WUA Act being revised; (v) establishing links with the Department of \nWomen and Child Development; (vi) forming women's groups and delivering programs in the \nWUA; and (vii) undertaking gender-disaggregated surveying and monitoring.  \nD.  Indigenous Peoples \n61.  Orissa has a relatively high indigenous population (22%) compared with other states. \nHigher concentration is seen in inland districts including those covered under the Investment \nProgram.  An  approved  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  will  be  the  basis  for \ndeveloping  indigenous  peoples  development  plans  for  schemes  having  project  impacts  on \naffected indigenous people.49 Regarding the schemes studied for the first PFR, three medium-\nsized  schemes  were  found  to  have  high  indigenous  populations  at  23%,  26%,  and  63%. \nIndigenous peoples specific actions were prepared for them to benefit from the positive impacts \nand  to  avoid  adverse  impacts,  if  any.50 The  specific  actions  include  (i)  promoting  due \nrepresentation  of  indigenous  peoples  in  the  concerned  WUAs;  (ii)  undertaking  separate \ninformation campaigns and needs assessment, and ensuring that their interests are met in the \nWUA development and program delivery process; (iii) forming indigenous people's groups within \nthe WUAs and empowering them by establishing links to the existing OSG programs and \nsupporting specific activities under the Investment Program; and (iv) developing WUA capacities \nto address the needs of indigenous farmers.   \nE.  Resettlement  \n62.  The  Investment  Program  will  only  involve  the  renovation  of  the  existing  irrigation \ninfrastructure, except for the Mahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation (MCII) scheme (footnote 21) \nwhere the irrigation system will be expanded with minor canals. For the subprojects appraised, \nonly the MCII scheme involves strip land acquisition; the existing right-of-way is sufficient to \nundertake renovation works with no encroachment in all other schemes. For the purpose of the \nInvestment Program, a resettlement framework (RF) has been prepared and agreed following \nthe Government\u2019s and OSG\u2019s laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995).51 Under the RF, all affected persons (APs) will be entitled to compensation for land \nacquired and lost assets at their replacement cost. They will also be assisted in improving, or at \nleast restoring, their pre-intervention income and livelihood standards, and productive capacity. \nThe  PMU  will  supervise  resettlement  plan  (RP)  preparation  and  implementation  by  the \nconcerned SIO with the support of the ISPM consultants, and with a supporting NGO for RP \nimplementation. The RPs as prepared for individual PFRs, as well as those for finalization with \ndetailed designs, will be sent to ADB for approval. Before implementing an RP, an independent  \n                                                 \n48 Available as Supplementary Appendix J. \n49 Indigenous peoples development framework is in Supplementary Appendix K. \n50 Indigenous peoples specific actions are in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n51  A resettlement plan for the MCII scheme is being prepared, following closely RF. The scope for the MCII scheme \nunder project 1 includes only the pre-construction works, including WUA formation, micro planning, and finalization \nand implementation of the resettlement plan. Civil works will be done in project 2.  \n ", "20 \nmonitoring and evaluation agency will also be engaged to assess performance and impacts. \nThe provisional cost estimates for resettlement is about $4.7 million. Appendix 13 presents a \nsummary RF. 52  \n \nF.  Environmental Impacts \n63.  During  the  project  preparatory  TA,  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were \nprepared  for  the  seven  subprojects  proposed  for  the  first  PFR,  which  were  classified  as \nenvironmental category B, along with an environmental assessment and review framework \n(EARF), following existing environmental laws and regulations of the Government, OSG, and \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Overall, the Investment Program will have positive impacts \non the environment, including improved water availability and water-use efficiency, increased \nagricultural  production,  and  an  institutional  system  of  PIM  to  distribute  water  efficiently. \nInstitutional  strengthening  for  IWRM  will  deliver  further  benefits  through  development  of  a \nframework for improved water resources and environmental management. Potential negative \nimpacts include (i) increased competition in water use within the subprojects and with other \nwater uses,53 (ii) deterioration of water quality due to agriculture intensification, and (iii) impacts \nduring construction of infrastructure. These are mitigated by (i) sufficient consultation to develop \noperational plans agreeable to all the WUAs, (ii) use of effective coordination mechanisms \namong the water users at times of drought, (iii) introducing integrated pest management and \neffective  soil  nutrient  management,  and  (iv)  ensuring  safe  and  environmentally  sound \nconstruction practices. Environmental capacity development for the Investment Program will be \nsupported by having an environmental cell in the PIM\u2013CAD directorate of the DOWR, which will \nbe strengthened by the ISPM consultants. For future subprojects, IEEs or environmental impact \nassessments, if required, will be prepared following the EARF and included in the subproject \nappraisal report, with due public consultation and information disclosure. Summary IEEs for the \nsubprojects proposed for the first PFR are in Appendix 14.54  \nG.  Risks \n64.  There  are  several  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  effective  implementation  and \nsustainable benefits, for which mitigation measures have been included. Refinement of program \ndesign and diversion of resources will be considered, if needed, under the subsequent PFRs.  \n65.  O&M Sustainability. The sustainability of the improved irrigation infrastructure would \ncritically depend on (i) the commitment and actions by the DOWR to properly manage and \nmaintain the system, (ii) sufficient O&M funds allocation by the OSG, and (iii) the WUA\u2019s \ncapacity to progressively take over O&M responsibility from the minor canal level to larger \nfacilities. There is a risk that system performance may deteriorate with inferior performance of \nany of these parties. To mitigate the risk, the Investment Program implementation must ensure \n(i) progressive strengthening of DOWR capacities with improved field staff accountability to \nWUAs; (ii) the OSG\u2019s continuation of its full maintenance funding policy and natural attrition of \nthe DOWR\u2019s nontechnical staff, with increased water tariff collection through improved system \nperformance and WUA motivation; and (iii) sound WUA development with identification of strong \nlocal leadership, farmer enrollment, and establishment of self-sustaining O&M systems with \nresource mobilization. These are included as key components and related institutional actions.  \n                                                 \n52 The RF and due diligence reports for other subprojects under project 1 are in Supplementary Appendixes M and N. \n53 For major and medium-sized schemes, water balance was assessed to reconfirm the overall water availability with \nthe updated hydrological data. \n54 The EARF and IEEs are in Supplementary Appendixes O and P. \n ", "21 \n66.  Operationalization of Reform Frameworks. There is strong political and administrative \nleadership to advance the PIM reform process in Orissa at present, as reflected in the latest \nState Water Policy 2007, DOWR reforms to establish a PIM\u2013CAD directorate in the DOWR, and \nimprovements to the WUA legal basis, which provide sound policy frameworks. However, there \nis a risk of insufficient implementation of these frameworks, which will depend on continued \npolitical will, strong leadership of DOWR management, qualified and dedicated program staff \nassignments, and overall staff support for the initiatives. To mitigate the risks, key sequential \nsteps to implement the frameworks have been detailed in the sector road map and included as \nassurances. At the subproject level, operational arrangements have been developed to ensure \nWUA-driven planning, design, implementation, and O&M. Capacity-development programs will \nsupport continuous facilitation and learning, along with the staff incentive systems to reward \nwell-performing staff in terms of better service delivery to WUAs. \n67.  Implementation Risk. Timely initiation and implementation of the Investment Program, \nquality of outputs, and adherence to ADB operating policies and procedures also remain at \nrisk.55 To mitigate the risk of start-up delay, a component TA project was provided (para. 53) to \nsupport the early establishment of program organizations with training, advance recruitment of \nconsultants and NGOs, and advanced procurement of civil works. Implementation delay and \nquality of output risk will be mitigated by addressing the key causes, including (i) advance land \nacquisition, efficient contract packaging, and advance procurement; (ii) sufficient training for the \nprogram staff in contract administration, supervision of civil works and other programs such as \nWUA  strengthening;  and  (iii)  adequate  resource  allocation  for  outsourcing  pre-construction \nactivities and for consulting services for work supervision and training. Safeguards risks are \nmitigated with the relevant frameworks and plans prepared under project preparatory TA, as \nwell as the support for addressing the safeguards issues included in the ISPM consultancy. \nADB will also assist these processes through regular review and supervision missions.  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n68.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, the OSG, and the DOWR have \ngiven  the  following  assurances.  These  have  been  incorporated  into  the  FFA  and  will  be \nincorporated into the individual loan agreements as applicable, subject to any amendment to be \nmutually agreed on by the Government of India, OSG, and ADB. \n(i)  The OSG will implement all policy and institutional actions as specified in Table \nA2.2 of Appendix 2 and stipulated as the sector road map in the FFA, including \nactions to  implement  State  Water  Policy  2007,  and  State  Water  Plan  2004; \norganizational reforms and strengthening of DOWR and associated institutions; \nrefinement  of  Pani  Panchayat  Act  2002;  progress  in  irrigation  management \ntransfer; sustainable O&M; and steps towards operationalizing IWRM.  \n(ii)  The OSG will ensure compliance with the specific measures for implementation \nquality assurance as stipulated in the FFA (Schedule 3) and para. 49.  \n(iii)  The  OSG  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  meet  the  selection  criteria  and \nimplementation arrangements and procedures as specified in the FFA and in \nAppendixes 7 and 8, while assuring their timely and efficient implementation with \nsufficient strengthening of the WUAs to take over minor facility O&M.   \n(iv)  The OSG will ensure that the Investment Program is implemented in compliance \nwith the existing environmental laws and regulations of the Government, OSG, \n                                                 \n55 The implementation completion report of the Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project (assisted by the World \nBank  and  implemented  during  1996\u20132004)  also  noted,  despite  an  overall  successful  rating,  administrative \nconstraints and lengthy processes for procurement and contract management.   \n ", "22 \nand ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and environmental assessment and review \nframework (EARF: Supplementary Appendix O). To this effect, the Government, \nOSG,  and  DOWR  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  PMU  will  prepare  an  IEE  or \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  report  as  required,  including  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  with  a  budget  identifying  the  cost  of  its \nimplementation, in consultation with stakeholders for each subproject following \nthe EARF, and submit the same to ADB, with the EIA or IEE for B-sensitive \nsubprojects to be subject to ADB\u2019s concurrence and to the 120-day requirement \nfor  public  disclosure  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy;  (b) all  environmental \nclearances required by all laws, acts, and regulations are obtained prior to the \ncommencement  of  civil  works  for  the  relevant  subproject;  (c) all  mitigation \nmeasures  identified  in  the  IEEs  and  EIAs  prepared  for  the  subprojects,  as \napplicable, are incorporated in the subproject design, and are implemented; (d) if \nthere are any changes in the scope of subproject facilities during the detailed \ndesign or implementation stage that has an impact on the IEE or EIA carried out, \nthen additional environmental assessment will be carried out and DOWR will take \nprior concurrence of ADB before further implementation; and (e) DOWR will \nsubmit  semiannual  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental management plans and measures under the IEE or EIA, and the \nenvironmental monitoring carried out as a regular part of project implementation, \nfor  review  and  disclosure  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy (2005).  \n(v)  The  OSG  will  undertake  the  Investment  Program  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s and OSG\u2019s laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995), and the approved resettlement framework (RF: Supplementary \nAppendix M). If land acquisition is required or any other resettlement impact is \nenvisaged in any proposed subproject, the Government, OSG, and DOWR will \nensure  that  (a)  PMU  prepares  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  that  subproject \nfollowing  the  RF  and  submits  it  to  ADB  for  approval  after  discussing  its \nresettlement information with APs; (b) all APs are compensated in accordance \nwith the approved RP before the commencement of the civil works; (c) if any \nmodification is identified during detailed design and implementation, OSG and \nDOWR  will  modify  the  RP  and  will  seek  ADB  approval  before  further  RP \nimplementation; (d) the PMU will ensure that grievance redress mechanisms are \nin place to assist APs in resolving their complaints in a timely manner; (e) DOWR \nwill make available all necessary funds in a timely manner so that RPs are \nimplemented and full reimbursement for acquired assets is made to the APs well \nin  advance  so  as  to  provide  them  sufficient  time  to  make  alternative \narrangements; (f) the PMU will submit the quarterly progress and completion \nreports on land acquisition and resettlement to ADB; (g) an independent agency \nwill  be  engaged  by  DOWR  to  undertake  external  monitoring  of  the \nimplementation of the RP that will also submit the reports semiannually to DOWR \nand ADB; and (h) relevant information including the RPs, progress reports, and \nindependent review reports will be disclosed, including on the ADB website, \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.  \n(vi)  In  case  any  significant  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  identified  in  any \nsubprojects,  the  Government,  the  OSG,  and  DOWR  will  ensure  that  an \nindigenous peoples development plan or specific actions in favor of them are \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and the \napproved indigenous peoples development framework (Supplementary Appendix \nK), and the same is further (a) approved by  ADB before award of the related civil \n \n ", "23 \n  works contract, and (b) implemented before the commencement of the civil works \ncontract of the relevant section of the subproject. Any update of the same due to \ndetailed designs or during implementation, progress and independent review \nreporting,  and  disclosure  will  follow  the  same  requirements  as  involuntary \nresettlement. \n(vii)  At the time of each PFR preparation, the Government and OSG will review the \nstatus of compliance with the safeguards plan and frameworks, and submit the \nreview report to ADB, together with the other required safeguard documents \nrelevant to the subproject included in the tranche being processed.    \n(viii)  The  Government  and  OSG  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contracts  under  the \nInvestment Program will follow all applicable labor laws of the Government and \nthe OSG and that these further include provisions to the effect that contractors \n(i) carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for labor and disseminate information \nat worksites as part of health and safety measures for those employed during \nconstruction;  and  (ii)  follow  and  implement  all  statutory  provisions  on  labor \n(including not employing or using children as labor, equal pay for equal work), \nhealth, safety, welfare, sanitation, and working conditions.

Sector Development Strategies and Partnership Opportunities1 \n1.  Policy Framework. The Orissa state government\u2019s (OSG\u2019s) Vision 2020 and 11th Five-\nYear Plan (2007\u20132012) envisage accelerating the annual growth rate to 9% and reducing poverty \nby 15% by 2012. Building on the comprehensive economic reforms pursued since early 2000s, the \n11th FYP set out key strategic pillars comprising (i) improving agricultural productivity and market \norientation by forming farmer groups and promoting participatory irrigation, (ii) expanding rural \nnonfarm business opportunities, (iii) enabling broad-based industrial growth, and (iv) reforming fiscal \nand  financial  management  with  public  sector  accountability.  Development  and  sound \nmanagement of irrigation infrastructure with water user associations (WUAs) is prioritized as a \npathway to productive and high-value agriculture, and poverty reduction in rural areas. To this end, \nthe OSG has progressively improved its policy and institutional basis for the irrigation and water \nresources sector since the 1990s. A new State Water Policy, revised from the 1994 policy, was \ndeclared in March 2007, reconfirming the principles of participatory irrigation management (PIM) and \nintegrated water resources management (IWRM), and full recovery of operation and maintenance \n(O&M) costs from users. The 2007 policy also called for expeditious completion of WUA formation and \ntransfer of O&M. It has further set out specific tasks towards making IWRM operational.  \n2.  Institutional Arrangements. The key public institutions associated with irrigated agriculture \ninclude (i) the Department of Water Resources (DOWR); (ii) the departments of agriculture, horticulture, \nand fisheries and animal husbandry; and (iii) local government village, subdistrict, and district institutions. \nFor the purpose of holistic water resources management, the OSG has established the State Water \nResources Board chaired by the chief secretary as the apex body for policy formulation, inter-sector water \nplanning, and allocation, to which the Water Planning Organization of the DOWR serves as secretariat. In \ngeneral, the concerned departments have requisite technical capacities but are constrained by (i) limited \noperational finance due to high overhead costs; (ii) insufficient incentives and capacity to implement \nirrigated agriculture works using participatory processes; (iii) need for better coordination among line \ndepartments, local government institutions, and WUAs; (iv) deficient O&M due to shortages of funds and \nhigh staff costs; and (v) need for greater accountability to service recipients.  \n3.  State Water Plan. The OSG completed the State Water Plan in 2004. It provides a basic \nframework to pursue the necessary interventions to meet the needs of diverse water users while \nmaintaining the integrity of the environment, with broad basin plans up to 2051. Key priorities include \n(i) reviving the investments in irrigation including improved efficiency of existing systems and creating \nnew systems; (ii) ensuring safe drinking water and waste disposal in rural and urban areas giving \nfinancial  autonomy  to  their  management  bodies;  (iii)  reducing  the  gaps  between  environmental \nregulations and practices; and (iv) enhancing O&M sustainability through levying of reasonable water \ncharges. Overall, the plan provides a solid initial basis from which to pursue integrated water sector \nplanning and investment. However, it largely remains a qualitative strategic framework, calling for \nquantitative and analytical investment planning with stakeholder participation starting at the individual \nbasin level.  \n4.  Legal  Framework  of  Participatory  Irrigation  Management.  The  OSG  enacted  the  Pani \nPanchayat Act in 2002 and framed the Pani Panchayat Rules in 2003. They provide a legal basis for WUA \nestablishment and progressive transfer of O&M responsibilities to WUAs by delegating minor facilities to \nthem. It outlines arrangements whereby the WUAs would undertake necessary works from grant funds \n                                                 \n1  See paras. 2\u20136 of the main text for the key sector performance and issues.   \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n    \nreceived from the DOWR and from collection of fees from their members.2 While they provide a \nsatisfactory framework for promoting PIM, the initial experience has led to the recognition of the need \nfor improvements in several areas. The present 3-year tenure of elected representatives is too short \nfor institution-building and continuity, and could be extended with tenure overlap. Better representation \nis needed by users of head, middle, and tail-end reaches of the canals among office bearers. Stronger \nWUA involvement is needed in planning and implementation of main system maintenance, and \nstronger participation of women and other vulnerable groups.  \n5.  Agriculture  Sector  Policy  and  Strategic  Framework.  In  line  with  its  market-oriented \neconomic reform principles, the OSG amended the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act in 2006. This \ncreated opportunities for private investment in storage and marketing facilities, and contract farming. \nThe OSG also declared State Agriculture Policy in 2008. It aims at more commercially oriented \nagriculture, and promotes participatory planning at local levels to be implemented with the private sector \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Despite this improving policy environment, agricultural \nproductivity remains low, with farmers beginning to respond to the new policies but facing constraints, \nincluding (i) low use of fertilizer (30% of the recommended level) despite the recent deregulation of \nprivate distribution, (ii) limited availability and use of improved seeds (seed replacement of only 6% \nagainst the 25% recommended), (iii) limited outreach of rural credit (40% of farm households have no \naccess to formal credit, calling for other solutions such as group-based approaches), (iv) limited \neffectiveness of extension services (calling for improved accountability of field extension workers and \nuse of private providers), and (v) the fragmented marketing chain and information asymmetry. In \ngeneral, local conditions vary considerably, with some areas progressing in crop intensification and \ndiversification, particularly where they have irrigation and ready access to markets. Strategically, these \nconditions call for careful planning of the most suitable production systems for the locality, and \nconcerted efforts to facilitate delivery of inputs and marketing of outputs, as well as support services.  \n6.  Water User Association Formation and Operation and Maintenance Transfer. In the \nlate 1990s, the process of forming WUAs was initiated with assistance from the World Bank for \nmajor and medium-sized schemes,3 the European Union (EU) for minor tank schemes,4 and the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW for minor lift schemes,5 following the foregoing institutional \nframework. Following completion of these projects, the OSG has continued the process of forming \nWUAs. As of July 2007, WUAs have been formed for 1.25 million hectares (ha) of the state\u2019s net \nirrigated area of 2.7 million ha, and O&M has been transferred to WUAs on 0.92 million ha. This \nprocess has received strong political support and is further buttressed by the OSG\u2019s most recent \neconomic reform programs.  \n7.  The overall response and impacts of the process are positive, with strong enthusiasm by \nWUAs, particularly where sufficient motivation and facilitation was provided along with sound \nirrigation infrastructure. However, recent progress has been slower, mainly because continuous \ninstitutional development support could not be provided to the WUAs. In general, experience in \nPIM in India suggests that long-term support is needed for WUAs to become vibrant institutions \nwith financial sustainability. Moreover, much of the irrigation infrastructure has deteriorated and \ncannot  function  as  desired,  posing  significant  difficulties  for  orderly  water  distribution.  Other \nlessons include the following: (i) WUAs need to be developed up-front in the project cycle, with full \nparticipation in the decision-making process; (ii) critical attention is needed to deliver quality \n                                                 \n2  For the minor lift schemes, the Pani Panchayat Act exempts WUAs from water rates and authorizes them to carry \nout necessary O&M works by collecting fees from members. In other schemes, water rates are collected by the \nRevenue Department, and WUAs are provided with grants from the DOWR. \n3  Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project, approved in 1995 for $290 million, covering 315,000 hectares (ha).  \n4  Orissa Minor Irrigation Project, implemented in 1995\u20132005 for \u20ac10.7 million, covering 9,600 ha.  \n5  DFID provided Rs385 million and KfW Rs994 million, covering a total of about 60,000 ha. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \ninfrastructure and sound operational rules need to be agreed to with the WUAs; (iii) limited \nattention has been provided to field channel networks, which should be pursued as an integral \npart of interventions for efficient water use; (iv) WUAs are willing to expand their scope beyond \nirrigation to pursue agriculture development, which could be facilitated; (v) effective mechanisms \nof planning and delivering agriculture support systems are needed; and (vi) NGOs and private \nproviders can be effectively utilized, but this requires capacity development.  \n8.  Department of Water Resources. In the DOWR, there is significant organizational support \nfor PIM and technical capacities to design and implement irrigation infrastructure. However, their \ncapacity to establish PIM systems needs further strengthening. Specifically, the DOWR still remains \nan engineering agency with high establishment costs and an aging staff structure. At the field level, \nsound  provider\u2013recipient  relationships  between  the  DOWR  and  WUAs  that  would  support \naccountable service delivery by the DOWR commensurate with water tariff payments by WUAs are \nstill developing. To this end, the DOWR needs to enhance its service orientation with a clearer \nmission statement and performance management. Their multidisciplinary managerial skills need to \nbe enhanced, as well as capacities of sound infrastructure operation. Support systems for PIM need \nstrengthening  with  more  effective  institutional  arrangements  to  develop  viable  WUAs  while \npromoting  productive  agriculture.  Finally,  the  DOWR  needs  to  strengthen  its  management \ninformation system (MIS) to more effectively monitor, plan, and implement O&M. \n9.  Operation and Maintenance Framework and Arrangements. To foster PIM, the OSG \nhas taken steps to move towards sustainable O&M. Specifically, the OSG has been allocating O&M \nfunds following the Government\u2019s Finance Commission reports. Allocations were increased from \nRs450/hectare (ha) to Rs600/ha for major and medium-sized schemes in FY2006 following the 12th \nFinance Commission report. On the revenue side, the irrigation water tariff was increased by 150% \nin 2002 (to a level at par with the national average) to recover O&M costs. The OSG is in the \nprocess  of raising industrial  water tariff  to  meet  the  recent  rise in  allocation.  However,  O&M \nsustainability  is  constrained  due  to  the  high  establishment  cost  of  the  DOWR  (Rs260/ha  as \ncompared with the norm of Rs120/ha). Cost recovery also remains at about 50% in FY2006, due to \nthe large gap (about 40%) between the irrigated areas claimed by the DOWR and those certified by \nthe Revenue Department, and the underachievement of the collection targets (by about 10%). \nEfforts are needed to reduce the gaps by improving the reliability of irrigation with better system \nperformance, and motivating farmers to pay water tariffs. The present system of collecting the water \ntariff by the Revenue Department and allocation of O&M funds to WUAs by the DOWR with no link \nbetween the two also poses a constraint that must be addressed.  \n10.  Integrated  Water  Resources  Managment.  In  parallel  with  pursuing  productive  and \nsustainable irrigated agriculture through PIM, the OSG is also taking steps towards further making \nIWRM operational. The specific agendas have been set out under the State Water Policy 2007, and \ninclude  (i)  preparing  multisector  river  basin  plans  with  participatory  river  basin  organizations, \n(ii) strengthening databases, and (iii) setting up a regulatory authority to set water tariff rates. These \ninitiatives are timely and need to be transformed into actions and operation with suitable institutional \nbacking.  \nB.  External Assistance to the Irrigated Agriculture Sector \n11.  In the irrigated agriculture sector, the World Bank has been the most dominant external \nfinancier for India, with provision of 22 investment projects for a total funding of $4.4 billion in \n10 states since 1986, including one completed project for Orissa (footnote 3). Major studies were \nundertaken in 1991 and 1998 with the Government of India, which defined directions for key \npolicy, institutional, and investment reforms for the sector. Over the years, World Bank assistance \nhas  moved  from  project  to  state  sector  loans  to  develop  and  sustain  water  resources \ninfrastructure  and  its  management  with  critical  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  The  ongoing \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \n    \nportfolio  (eight  projects  in  six  states)  pursues  institutional  reforms  of  the  state  irrigation \ndepartments towards greater accountability, decentralization with WUA participation, O&M cost \nrecovery, and progress towards establishment of regulatory frameworks to support IWRM.6 The \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  is  the  second  largest  financier  and  has \nincreased sector operation in recent years, with four loans in four states for $700 million, \nincluding one in Orissa. JBIC\u2019s assistance is also focusing on effective physical improvement in \ncombination  with  capacity  building  of  the  state  irrigation  departments.  Other  key  partners \ninclude the EU (financing about $110 million for minor irrigation schemes), Canada, and DFID, \nwhich have also focused on institutional strengthening of WUAs with minor scheme renovation.  \n12.  In Orissa, the projects assisted by four external funding agencies cited in para. 6 were \nimplemented from the mid-1990s and completed by 2005. Among these, the Water Sector \nRestructuring Project assisted by the World Bank has been instrumental in setting out and \nproceeding with the relevant sector reforms. At present, the JBIC-assisted Rengali Irrigation \nProject, a major new irrigation scheme, is the only externally assisted project in the sector, \nwhereas the World Bank is processing the Community Tank Irrigation Project, for approval in \n2008, to renovate the minor irrigation systems in the entire state with PIM. In agriculture and \nnatural resources sector, DFID is assisting a comprehensive livelihoods project in western \nOrissa that is providing a range of valuable models for community based natural resources \nmanagement. ADB is also assisting the expansion of rural road networks and reforms of the \ncooperatives credit system that provide a basis for irrigated agriculture development.7  \nC.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy  \n13.  ADB\u2019s overall strategic direction in India is to assist the country in promoting efficient and \nsustainable economic growth to increase employment opportunities and reduce poverty. While \nADB\u2019s sector operation started only recently in 2001, the country strategy and program for India \n(2003\u20132006)8 expanded  the  operational  area  to  include  agriculture  and  rural  infrastructure \nincluding irrigation as its most important feature to address the country\u2019s chronic rural poverty \nproblems and looming water crisis. Accordingly, a number of sector studies were undertaken to \naccumulate knowledge and disseminate the best practices and lessons learned in India and \nother  Asian  countries.  A  loan  to  support  minor  irrigation  system  renovation  with  PIM  in \nChhattisgarh was approved in 2005, and its implementation is accelerating with increasing state \nownership.9 The  new  draft  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132012)  further  envisages  an \nenhanced ADB role in rural infrastructure, including irrigation, water resources management, \nrural markets, and transport facilities. This is in consideration of (i) the high priorities accorded \nby the Government and the stakeholders, (ii) vast country sector needs in terms of finance, and \n(iii) the prospects for transferring the best practices and lessons learned from ADB\u2019s sector \noperations in other Asian countries. The operational focus on water management is also in line \nwith ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) and Water Financing \nProgram 2006\u20132010.10 \n14.  Within this framework, the assistance strategy for irrigation and the water resources \nsector envisages gradual extension of ADB operations in India with a selective focus on the \nstates willing to pursue critical investments with requisite policy and institutional reforms, with a \n                                                 \n6  Despite high lending, the external funding compared with the overall sector budgets in India is deemed small, and \nthe country assistance evaluation by the World Bank in 2002 indicated the need for higher selectivity of states in \nterms of reform ownership and orientation, and closer collaboration with other development partners.  \n7  See footnotes 9 and 10 in the main text.    \n8  ADB. 2003.

Manila.  \n10  See footnote 16 and 18 in the main text. \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nlong-term  partnership  with  ADB,  and  following  ADB\u2019s  water  policy.11The  specific  reform \nmeasures will be set out in a policy framework to pursue sustainable service delivery, IWRM, \nand other key policy principles with policy dialogues. Recognizing that institutional development \nis a long-term process requiring continued dialogue, assistance will be selectively focused on \nthe  most  critical  agendas  in  line  with  the  specific  contexts  and  needs  of  the  state,  with \nsequenced capacity building and investments, in collaboration with other development partners. \nImproving deteriorated irrigation infrastructure while institutionalizing PIM will be accorded high \npriority in an effort to promote productive and high-value agriculture in rural areas dominated by \nsmallholders, while strengthening the capacities of (i) local WUAs to progressively take over the \nmanagement of the infrastructure, and (ii) state irrigation agencies as accountable bulk water \nservice providers. Based on the best practices and lessons learned, ADB assistance will pursue \ninstitutionalizing  comprehensive  planning  and  stringent  process  management  to  put  PIM \nprinciples into sound sector operation. There will be an emphasis on early capacity development \nof WUAs, following which infrastructure and other support services are provided. Assistance will \nalso emphasize capacity development of, and incentives for, all agencies involved. Gaining local \nexperience and reflecting this in the further improved implementation arrangements is also an \nimportant  part  of  the  strategy.  WUAs  will  also  be  promoted  to  facilitate  local  agriculture \ndevelopment and poverty reduction, linking with existing or project-specific self-help schemes. \nD.  Sector Road Map and Investment Program \n15.  In  line  with  the  foregoing  partnership  opportunities,  the  road  map  and  investment \nprogram for the Orissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Investment \nProgram have been prepared to assist the OSG in completing the establishment of WUAs, \nrenovating infrastructure, and transferring the O&M of minor facilities. In general, critical actions \nare to be taken up front, and then followed by incremental steps during the program period. The \nroad map also envisages supporting further steps for management transfer of higher-level \nfacilities while putting IWRM into operation. It is built on initiatives that the OSG has proposed or \nhas already taken, and on consultation held during the program preparatory stage.  \n16.  Vision,  Goals,  and  Principles.  The  road  map  and  investment  program  envision \nimproving irrigation service delivery with WUA empowerment to enhance the productivity and \nsustainability of irrigated agriculture, thereby contributing to rural poverty reduction. Specific \ngoals include (i) enhancing productivity and incomes by realizing the full development potential \nof irrigation infrastructure, (ii) setting up sustainable management systems, (iii) improving the \nlivelihood of the poor, and (iv) putting into operation effective processes and mechanisms based \non a sound policy and institutional framework. Implementation will be guided by the principles of \n(i)  informed  participatory  decision  making  by  stakeholders,  (ii)  coordinated  and  integrated \norganizational links at all stages, (iii) accountability and transparency, (iv) effectiveness to be \nmonitored based on clearly defined result targets, (v) efficiency pursued with sound step-by-step \nprocess management, and (vi) a knowledge-driven approach with flexibility for adjustments.      \n17.  Institutional Strengthening of the DOWR. The roles and capacities of the DOWR are \nmost critical for the implementation of the Investment Program. The following are envisaged:  \n(i)  The DOWR has established a permanent directorate for PIM and command area \ndevelopment (CAD) with three divisions: (a) WUA institutional support, (b) O&M \nof transferred facilities, and (c) CAD. Its leadership has been appointed from \nqualified multidisciplinary staff. The existing technical set-up of the DOWR is also \nrealigned into directorates for irrigation service delivery and IWRM. \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003. Water for All: The Water Policy of the ADB. Manila (adopted in 2001).  \n ", "  Appendix 2  33 \n    \n(ii)  To reduce establishment costs, the DOWR has adopted the rationalization of its \nnontechnical field staff through natural attrition without new recruitment. In the \nmeantime, those field staff will also be trained and placed under the WUA to \nprovide services for better accountability.  \n(iii)  To ensure that PIM-based accountable service delivery systems are embedded, \nthe  DOWR  has  initiated  a  change-management  process  to  formulate  an \ninstitutional vision, strategy, and action plan for staff management. This will be \nreflected in staff instructions and performance evaluation systems. A capacity-\ndevelopment plan will be expanded to include new requirements.    \n(iv)  The DOWR will strengthen its quality control systems with the establishment of \n(a) a work process for participation of WUAs in construction quality monitoring of \nDOWR-engaged  contractors  and  for  executing  minor  works,  and  (b)  quality \ncontrol cell to undertake third-party testing and internal technical auditing. \n(v)  Finally,  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  Water  and  Land  Management \nInstitute as a state training and research institute, it has been reorganized with \nimproved representation of relevant stakeholders, and stronger autonomy.  \n18.  Legal Framework of PIM. To address the present constraint in WUA establishment and \nmanagement, the OSG will revise the Pani Panchayat Act 2002 and Rules 2003, with specific \nimprovements including (i) longer tenure of elected members (6 years) with overlap of two \nseparate terms at 3-year intervals; (ii) equal representation of farmers from head, middle, and \ntail-end reaches of the canals as office bearers; and (iii) promotion of women elected members \n(towards 33%). In the context of the investment program, the OSG will also (i) establish and \nimplement  clear  operational  rules  specifying  WUAs\u2019  water  entitlements,  (ii)  participation  of \nWUAs  and  higher-level  committees  in  the  decision  making  of  scheme-wide  maintenance \nplanning and implementation, (iii) set up and operate district coordination committees headed by \ndistrict  collectors  to  meet  the  WUAs\u2019  development  concerns,  and  (iv)  promote  livelihood \nenhancement of other vulnerable people within the WUA framework. Upon sound demonstration \nof these functions, their inclusion in the legal framework will be further pursued.  \n \n19.  Sustainable O&M Financing.12 The road map includes several short- to medium-term \nmeasures to ensure sustainable O&M. For overall macro planning, the OSG will (i) maintain the \npolicy  of  providing  O&M  funds  following  the  Government\u2019s  Finance  Commission  reports \n(completed in the context of the 12th Finance Commission); and (ii) maintain the full O&M cost \nrecovery policy by revising irrigation, industrial, and other water tariffs following the changes in \nthe O&M allocation. To reduce the burden of establishment costs in the allocated O&M fund, the \nDOWR is also to maintain the present natural attrition of its field nontechnical staff. For the \npurpose of reducing the immediate shortfalls between O&M allocation and revenue, the OSG \nwill (i) strengthen the MIS for O&M performance monitoring and planning, (ii) reduce the gap \nbetween irrigated areas recorded by the DOWR and certified by the Revenue Department \nthrough joint verification with WUAs, (iii) improve the revenue record database to monitor WUA \nperformance, and (iv) establish guidelines for O&M fund allocation with a clear performance-\nbased  criteria  (i.e.,  a  link  between  the  tariff  collected  and  funds  allocated).  To  ensure \nsustainable O&M at the scheme level, the DOWR will introduce a system of (i) jointly deciding \non the O&M plan with WUAs, (ii) providing additional available funds to WUAs for the facilities \nrequiring higher maintenance, and (iii) ensuring WUAs mobilize their own resources in case \nfunds from the DOWR cannot meet the requirements.  \n                                                 \n12 These measures are applicable to major and medium-sized schemes. For minor schemes, all responsibility for \nO&M, including fund collection and work execution, is envisaged to be transferred to the WUAs. \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n20.  Irrigation Management Transfer. The OSG is in the process of establishing WUAs for \nall public irrigation schemes by 2008. To strengthen statewide awareness and support for PIM, \nthe DOWR has prepared an information, education, and communication strategy, and will put \nthe  strategy  into  operation  within  2008.  As  the  first  step  of  this  process,  the  OSG  has \nannounced 2008 as the \u201cyear of irrigation.\u201d The WUA establishment process is accompanied by \nthe transfer of the responsibility for minor facility O&M to WUAs with necessary infrastructure \nrenovation for ready O&M management by WUAs. Upon completion of this process, further \ntransfer of O&M responsibility of higher-level canals is also envisaged in the longer term.  \n21.  IWRM. Along with pursuing the above-mentioned steps to improve irrigation service \ndelivery, the road map envisages step-by-step progress in introducing IWRM following the \nactions specified in the State Water Policy 2007. Specifically, the OSG will (i) assess and define \nappropriate  IWRM  functions  and  institutional  arrangements  for  setting  up  an  authority  or \ncommission for fixing water tariffs and other regulatory functions including water allocation and \nentitlement  and  environmental  management,  and  put  them  into  operation;  (ii)  prepare \nmultisector river basin plans while establishing participatory river basin organizations; and (iii) \nstrengthen the database and decision support systems for the concerned river basins. The \nprocess will be guided by the State Water Resources Board with stakeholder participation.   \n22.  OSG\u2019s Investment Plan and the Investment Program. In accordance with the road \nmap,  a  specific  investment  plan  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  existing \nunderutilized irrigation infrastructure based on PIM and WUA development (as summarized in \nTable A2.1 below) has been prepared and included by the DOWR and the OSG as a priority \nprogram  for  the  11th  FYP  (2007\u20132012).  The  investment  program  has  been  formulated  to \nimplement the investment plan, covering major, medium-sized, and minor (lift) schemes in the \nfour northern basins, and priority major schemes in the Mahanadi River Delta. The remaining \nschemes are to be implemented with the support of the Government and external financiers.  \nTable A2.1: Investment Plan for Irrigation Infrastructure in Orissa \nRegion/Basin\nItem Total\nNorthern Mahanadi Southern\nNumber of basins 4 1 6 11\nGeographical area 43,800 km2 65,600 km2 41,013 km2 150,400 km2\nNet Irrigated Area (NIA: '000 ha) 481.0 940.1 417.3 1838.4\nModernization Requirement\n   NIA for Major and Medium ('000 ha) 205.0 114.2 121.6 440.8\n   NIA for Minor (lift: '000 ha) 30.0 50.0 20.0 100.0\n   NIA for Minor (flow: '000 ha) 50.6\n   Investment Need(cid:31)(except minor flow)  $270 million $185 million $86 million $541 million\n   Investment Need(cid:31)(minor flow) $123 million\n   Total Investment Need $664 million\nOngoing New Schemes\n   NIA ('000 ha) 233.9 145.4 141.2 520.5\n   Investment Requirement $718 million $284 million $76 million $1,078 million\nProposed New Schemes\n   NIA ('000 ha) 198 578 220 996\n= Orissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Investment Program, \nincluding priority scheme modernization in the Mahanadi delta\nSource: Department of Water Resources, Orissa state government.   \n \n23.

Selection  Criteria.  Under  the  Orissa  Integrated  Irrigated  Agriculture  and  Water \nManagement Investment Program (the Investment Program), the following criteria will apply in \nselecting subprojects intended for financing under the Investment Program.  \n(i)  The subprojects will be located within Brahmani, Baitarani, Burhabalanga, and \nSubernarekha river basins, and a part of the Mahanadi River Delta area.  \n(ii)  The subprojects will involve rehabilitation, extension, and modernization of the \nexisting irrigation and associated infrastructure. Subprojects will either be major \n(having a command area of over 10,000 hectares [ha]), medium-sized (between \n1,000 ha and 10,000 ha), or very minor community-based lift (between 10 ha and \n50 ha) irrigation schemes.1 \n(iii)  For each subproject, a participatory feasibility study and support due diligence will \nhave been prepared, covering technical design, economic and financial viability, \ninstitutional arrangements, social assessments including social safeguards plans \nas applicable, environmental analysis, and an implementation plan. \n(iv)  All necessary central and state government approvals will be in place. \n(v)  For individual subproject feasibility assessments, the following criteria will apply: \n(a)  technical feasibility, with insignificant technical risks that would undermine \nefficacy, economic return, safety, or sustainability;  \n(b)  reliable water availability and quality, with insignificant negative impact on \nthe other users of the same source or the ecosystem downstream; \n(c)  financial and economic viability with an economic internal rate of return of \nover 12% with robustness under sensitivity and risk analysis; \n(d)  marginal farmers (less than 1 ha landholding) constituting more than 50%; \n(e)  social and environmental soundness with insignificant negative impacts; \n(f)  fulfillment of safeguards requirements (involuntary resettlement, indigenous \npeoples, and environment) of the Government and ADB, and efforts to \nminimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  the  planning  and  design \nprocess; and \n(g)  concurrence of the concerned water user associations (WUAs) on the basic \ndesign, including farmer contribution (in cash or in kind) for minor facilities \n(5%),  command  area  development  works  (10%),  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the minor facilities within the WUA boundary.  \n(vi)  For minor lift irrigation schemes, the following criteria will also apply:   \n(a)  operational status being either operational by the WUA or nonoperational in \nless than 5 years due to the causes addressed through rehabilitation; \n(b)  technical and socioeconomic soundness and sustainability with flat land \ntopography (less than 5% slope), vicinity to reliable power supply (within 3 \nkilometers), and little risk of riverbank erosion or sand casting due to floods; \n(c)  WUA members\u2019 agreement to assume full responsibility of O&M including \npayment  for  power  supply  and  all  major  repair  and  future  asset \nreplacement,  with  power  agreement  with  electric  supply  company  and \nbeneficiary  contribution  (in  cash  or  in  kind)  equivalent  to  20%  of  the \n                                                 \n1  The investment program will also accommodate as a pilot a small number of minor (less than 1,000 ha) creek \nirrigation schemes, which will also follow the same criteria.   \n ", "48  Appendix 7 \ninvestment costs, and additional amount as reserve funds to prepare for \nfuture asset replacement;  \n(d)  sound O&M plan developed to fully irrigate the command area; \n(e)  the subproject cost of less than Rs36,000/ha of net irrigated area; and \n(f)  relatively equal land distribution, with less than 70% of net irrigated area \noperated by the largest 20% of operators.   \n2.  Procedures.  For the purpose of the first periodic financing request (PFR) under the \ninvestment program, an appraisal process has been undertaken for two major (Taladanda and \nMahanadi  Chitropala  island  irrigation)  and  three  medium-sized  (Gohira,  Remal,  and  Sunei) \nschemes, along with the two sample subprojects for community-based minor lift irrigation.2    \n \n3.  For all irrigation schemes to be proposed for inclusion in the subsequent PFRs, each \nsubproject will be processed in accordance with the following procedures:  \n(i)  Feasibility studies will be conducted by the executing agency (EA) including its cost \nestimates. The EA will also prepare an initial poverty and social assessment and fill out \nchecklists  for  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and  environment;  and \nsubmit the same to ADB for review and categorization.  \n(ii)  Based on the categorization and the feasibility studies, the EA will prepare the draft \nappraisal  reports  for  all  subprojects  to  be  considered  under  the  respective  PFRs \nfollowing  the  selection  criteria,  together  with  required  attachments,  i.e.,  draft \nresettlement  plan  (RP),3 draft  indigenous  peoples  development  plan,  and  draft \nenvironmental assessment.4 \n(i)  During the above process, the EA, with the assistance of the institutional strengthening \nand project management consultants, will also assess the progress and performance \nof the implementation of the preceding loans under the Investment Program, with \nnecessary actions to enhance their effectiveness. ADB will closely engage with the EA \nwhile the work is being carried out. \n(iii)  If a proposed subproject is not likely to satisfy the eligibility criteria and/or the agreed \nprocedures, ADB will advise the EA to either (a) modify the subproject proposal in a \nmanner that will make it eligible, or (b) reject the subproject. In the latter case, the EA \nmay propose a replacement subproject under the loan.  \n(iv)  Upon  completing  the  feasibility  assessments  of  the  concerned  subprojects  and \nprogress  and  performance  review  of  the  preceding  loans  under  the  Investment \nProgram, the EA will submit the same with a PFR to ADB for approval. The EA will \nensure  that  the  necessary  approvals  of  the  Government  of  India  or  Orissa  state \ngovernment have been obtained prior to submission of the PFR. \n                                                 \n2  About 650 subprojects are envisaged to be implemented for minor lift irrigation schemes under the first loan. For \nthese subprojects, the executing agency (EA) will conduct feasibility studies and prepare the appraisal reports \nfollowing the selection criteria together with required attachments, i.e., draft resettlement plan, draft indigenous \npeoples development plan, and draft environmental assessment, if required, and submit the same to ADB for \napproval. Once it has been established that the appraisal reports have achieved a desired level of quality, these will \nbe submitted to ADB for information, except for those appraisal reports that have safeguards documents requiring \nprior approval by ADB. \n3  The EA will translate the RP into the local language and disclose it to the affected people and incorporate the results \nof the consultation. The final RP will also be disclosed on the ADB website and the website of the EA. \n4  If any of the subprojects are categorized as environmental category A or B sensitive in any subsequent loan, \ncompliance is required with the 120-day advance disclosure rule. The summary environmental impact assessment or \nsummary initial environmental examination must be circulated to the ADB Board of Directors and made available to \nthe general public 120 days before the PFR is submitted to ADB. \n ", "  Appendix 8  49 \nSUBPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE AND ARRANGEMENTS \nFigure A8: Implementation Procedure \nFeasibility Studies and Subproject Implementation Plan Preparation  \nConfirmation of Candidate Subproject Selection      Feasibility Studies and Subproject Implementation Plan  \n(ii)  Existing major, medium, or MLI scheme in the set  (i)  Field confirmation of the issues on the left \ngeographical area requiring renovation   (ii)  Initial formulation of ad hoc WUA   \n(iii) Technical feasibility with insignificant risks  (iii)  Data collection on physical, socioeconomic, and \n(iv) Reliable water availability, insignificant negative  institutional setting \nimpacts on downstream users and ecosystems   (iv)  Problem assessment on agriculture, infrastructure, and \n(v)  EIRR greater than 12%, robustness against risks  irrigation and water management \n(vi) Marginal and small farmers constituting more than  (v)  Inventory of existing and planned programs \n50% beneficiary households and land areas   (vi)  Participatory rapid rural appraisal at village \n(vii) No major environmental issues  (vii)  Identification of priority investment requirements focusing \n(viii) No major social and land-related issues  on water and associated interventions \n(ix) Beneficiaries support overall subproject concept,  (viii) Feasibility studies of identified interventions \nand agree on contribution for 5% of minor works,  (ix)  Formulation of SIP specifying input and output targets \n10% of CAD, and 20% of MLI works  (x)  Associated safeguard and other assessments \n  (xi)  Presentation of feasibility study and SIP and endorsement \n  by WUA \nApproval of Feasibility Studies and Inclusion in the \nMFF Subprojects (through PFR) \n \n(See footnote 1  for main facilities requiring early implementation) \n \nWUA Micro Plan (Major and Medium-Sized    WUA Beneficiary Mobilization \nSchemes)1 \nWUA Micro Plan Preparation    During Micro Plan Preparation \n(i)  WUA working group established to work with SIP \n(i)  WUA institutional development plan prepared, with \nteam for micro plan preparation \nfull land and household records  \n(ii)  Information campaign on the project and its \n(ii)  Infrastructure development plan (including CAD \nrequirements \nlayouts and conjunctive use promotion), and water \n(iii)  Endorsement of draft micro plan by WUA \nmanagement improvement plan \n(iii)  Agriculture and livelihood enhancement plan,  After Micro Plan Approval \nprepared for synergy with other ongoing programs  (i)  Start implementing WUA institutional development \n(iv)  Environmental and social safeguards plans (as  plan with facilitation by NGOs \nrequired)  (ii)  Membership enrollment over 70% \n(v)  Endorsement of draft WUA micro plan by WUA  (iii)  Election, and executive and subcommittee formation \nApproval by SIO with support of the  (iv)  Participate in and endorse detailed design and \nconsultants   beneficiary contribution targets \n(v)  Achievement of set beneficiary contribution targets \n \nFull achievements of the targets in (ii)\u2013(v) \nconfirmed by SIO  \n \n \n \nWUA Implementation Agreement Signing \nImplementation agreement to stipulate schedules, programs, and responsibilities \nof the concerned organizations to implement the micro plans\u2014to be signed by \nheads of SIO and WUAs \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Implementation will be based on the canal units constituting individual WUAs.

Objective \n \n1.   The economic and financial analysis assessed the two major and three medium-sized \nirrigation schemes, and the two sample community-based minor lift irrigation (MLI) schemes, \nwhich are to be included in the first multitranche financing facility (MFF) loan for the Orissa \nIntegrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Investment Program. All are existing \nschemes, with one major scheme1 to extend the branch and minor canal systems to compete its \nincomplete scope, while the rest are to renovate the existing irrigation infrastructure.2 The analysis \nhas  focused  on  (i)  affordability  and  sustainability,  and  (ii) economic  feasibility.  For  each \nsubproject,  the  capacity  of  individual  farm  households  to  bear  the  additional  on-farm  costs \nassociated  with  the  project  was  assessed.  The  beneficial  impacts  of  rehabilitated  irrigation \nschemes and all nonengineering support including agricultural extension on crop profitability are \nweighed against the capital costs and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Given that the \nremaining subprojects under the Investment Program are all to renovate existing infrastructure, \nthe results can be both representative and indicative of the remaining sites.  \n \nB.  Approach and Major Assumptions \n \n2.  To assess the expected direct benefits of the subprojects, quantifiable effects are valued \nby comparing the with-program and without-program scenarios. The input\u2013output coefficient of \nfarm production\u2014including cropping patterns and yields, fertilizer use, and labor costs\u2014was \nestimated  based  on  farm  surveys  in  the  subproject  areas  and  cross-checked  with  the  data \nreported in completed irrigated agriculture projects in Orissa.3 All subprojects were assumed to \nhave an economic life of 25 years and to achieve the full benefits in the third year after civil work \ncompletion. The investment costs were estimated based on the basic design data.4 All overhead \ncosts including consulting services, training, and administration were included in the analysis. The \nanalysis  uses  a  domestic  price  numeraire,  and  economic  prices  for  traded  inputs  and \ncommodities (rice and wheat with export parity, and fertilizers with import parity prices) were \nbased on World Bank commodity price projections. The prices of other crops and farm inputs \nwere derived based on the market prices in the subproject areas in June 2007. A standard \nconversion factor of 0.90 and shadow wage rate of 0.75 were used.  \nC.  Estimated Benefits \n \n3.  Increased Crop Production. Crop production is expected to increase both in terms of \nquantity and value as a result of scheme renovation, because of expanded command area,  \nincreased yields, and changes in cropping patterns and intensities. Low reliability of water is a \n                                                 \n1  Mahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation (MCII) subproject in the Mahanadi River Delta (12,360 hectares [ha], of which \n5,940 ha are new). \n2  Taladanda subproject (Mahanadi Delta, 32,630 ha), Gohira subproject (Brahmani basin, 8,300 ha), Remal subproject \n(Baitarani basin, 4,310 ha), Sunei subproject (Burhabalanga basin, 10,000 ha), Jalhda minor lift irrigation subproject \n(Subernarekha basin, 20 ha), and Parimukundapur MLI subproject (Brahmani basin, 40 ha).  \n3  While the Investment Program aims to achieve high potential yield levels with integration with command area \ndevelopment and agriculture extension and other services, conservative estimates were adopted in terms of the \nassumed changes in input use and yields that are comparable to those observed in other irrigation projects (having \nless command area development [CAD] and agriculture support services provided) for the purpose of the analyses.  \n4  O&M cost has adopted the figure cited in the Government\u2019s 12th Finance Commission (December 2004), and \npresent level of water tariff for households financial analysis for major and medium-sized schemes, plus data \nobtained for O&M requirement of CAD works. For MLI schemes, actual requirements including electricity fees and \ndepreciation costs, were calculated on a case-by-case basis.    \n ", "  Appendix 11  57 \nmajor factor constraining the productivity of the irrigation systems both in monsoon and dry \nseasons, which is associated with deteriorated infrastructure and inefficient canal operation. An \nimproved canal network with installation of field channel systems will increase the distribution \nefficiency, thereby enabling the expansion of the irrigated area. In reservoir-based medium-sized \nschemes, the dry-season command area can be increased by improving reservoir operational \npractices. Crop yields are also expected to increase because of (i) more reliable water supply (via \nimproved canal and operation systems), (ii) increased use of modern inputs (induced by stable \nand assured water supply), and (iii) provision of extension and other support services. Crop \ndiversification  is  also  expected  to  be  facilitated  through  (i)  introduction  of  field  channels  (to \ndistribute  water  efficiently  to  the  tail  ends  without  resorting  to  plot-to-plot  flooding  irrigation \nconstraining the crop choice), and (ii) intensification of staple crops (that will increase the food \nself-sufficiency of marginal farmers motivating the adoption of high-value crops). WUA members \nwill also be motivated to grow water-saving crops in the dry season.  \n \n4.  Nonquantifiable  Benefits.  The  project  will  also  generate  nonquantifiable  benefits, \nincluding  (i)  an  improved  planning  system  with  comprehensive  implementation  plans; \n(ii) strengthened WUAs to undertake O&M of at least minor facilities and serve as local agriculture \ndevelopment facilitators for input supply, technical support, and collective marketing; and (iii) \nimproved irrigation and related service-delivery mechanism with transparent and accountable \ngovernance through WUAs. Benefits derived from strengthening policy, planning, and institutional \nframework  for  participatory  irrigation  management  (PIM)  and  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM) will also have wider impacts at state and field levels.5 \nD.  Assessment of Financial Returns \n5.  Farm budget analysis was conducted for typical farm households in the subproject areas, \ndifferentiating fully or partly irrigated and nonirrigated areas, and marginal, small, and medium to \nlarge farm households.6 The gains in farm net income as a result of the project are compared with \nthe farmers\u2019 share of investment costs (Table A11). The annual gains with the project exceed the \none-time investment costs for all categories of farm households. The annual net gain with the \nInvestment  Program  (Rs10,000\u2013Rs11,200/ha  for  major  and  medium  scheme  renovation, \nRs20,000/ha for major extension, and Rs15,000\u2013Rs20,000/ha for MLI renovation) represents a \n50%\u201398% increase in annual income for major and medium scheme renovation, 109% for major \nextension, and 64%\u2013108% for MLI renovation on average. The expected increase is higher for \ncurrently nonirrigated or deprived areas, and reduces their income difference with the irrigated \nareas.  \n \n6.  Two Major Schemes in the Mahanadi River Delta. The first MFF tranche will include \none major scheme for extension (Mahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation [MCII]; footnote 1) and \nanother for rehabilitation (Taladanda; footnote 2). The MCII scheme will provide irrigation to 5,940 \nha of presently nonirrigated land (except some 5% irrigated with groundwater), and the Taladanda \nscheme will provide irrigation to its original command area of 32,700 ha. The areas are mostly \ncultivated with paddy in the monsoon, although irrigation is not provided in the MCII area and \nreaches only 65% of the command area in Taladanda with limited reliability due to deteriorated \ninfrastructure and limited water control structures, field channels, and communications systems. \nCropping is limited to 28% of the area in the MCII area and 65% in Taladanda in the dry season, \nmainly due to the limited water availability. It is well-diversified, with non-cereal crops accounting \n                                                 \n5  Economic analysis has not taken into account impacts associated with canal maintenance roads and bridges to \nreduce transport time, as well as follow-on impacts on the nonfarm sector derived from increased crop production.  \n6  Marginal farm are defined as those of less than 1.0 ha, small farms are 1.0\u20132.0 ha, and medium to large farms are \ngreater than 2.0 ha.  \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \nfor 54% of the cropped area in the MCII area and 41% in Taladanda. The area under high-value \ncrops (vegetables, groundnuts, and sugar cane) is also relatively high, reaching 53% of the \ncropped area in the MCII area and 30% in Taladanda. In crop production, limited use of improved \ncereal seeds (as well as their availability) and fertilizer are issues (due partly to the unreliability of \nwater), along with limited contacts with agriculture extension workers. On the other hand, the \nareas have good and close connectivity with key urban centers (the state capital and nearby city \nwith a combined population of 1.4 million) through state and national road networks to sell the \nmarket surplus.7 The Investment Program will generate several benefits. First, reliable water \nsupply, provided through canal and field channel systems, will lead to paddy yield increases in the \nmonsoon season, particularly in the currently nonirrigated or deprived areas. Second, irrigation \nwill also be provided in the dry season, increasing the percentage of cropped area from 28% to \n83% in the MCII area and from 65% to 73% in Taladanda, with yield increase associated with \nmore reliable irrigation.8 The dry-season cropping is assumed to have a similar cropping pattern \nthat prevails at present with marginal increases of high-value crops. The area will have a large \nmarket surplus of all crops.  \n7.  Three Reservoir-Based Medium-Sized Schemes. The three schemes (footnote 2) have \nsimilar characteristics, having a storage reservoir (constructed by the mid-1980s) that can provide \nirrigation over a part of the command area during the dry season.9 All aim at restoring the design \ncommand areas with fully assured irrigation for 8,300 ha for Gohira, 4,310 ha for Remal, and \n10,000 ha for Sunei. Paddy remains the predominant crop in the monsoon, and irrigation reaches \nabout 66% of the command area in Gohira with limited reliability, and 63% in Remal and Sunei. \nKey constraints include the deteriorated infrastructure (particularly severe in Remal and Sunei), \nand  limited  water  control  structures  and  virtual  nonexistence  of  field  channels.  As  a  result, \nreservoir  water  is  generally  overdrawn  in  the  monsoon,  reducing  the  scope  of  dry-season \nirrigation, for which present cultivation remains at 50% in Gohira, 30% in Remal, and 26% in \nSunei, all with partial or no irrigation. Diversification in the dry season is varied, with non-cereal \ncrops accounting for 45% in Gohira, 15% in Sunei, and only 2% in Remal. The low figures in the \nlatter  two  schemes  are  due  to  the  large  areas  devoted  to  pulse,  which  is  cropped  without \nirrigation. High-value crops are cultivated in 17% of the cropped area in Gohira, and 15% in \nSunei. Productivity is constrained by limited use of improved seeds and fertilizer, availability of \nwhich is also an issue, along with limited contacts with agriculture extension workers.10 The \nInvestment Program will enhance the reliability of irrigation in the monsoon season, thereby \nincreasing the paddy yields. In the dry season, renovation of irrigation infrastructure, placement of \nfield channels, and improved reservoir and system operation will expand the irrigated area to 70% \nof the command area in Gohira, 66% in Remal, and 50% in Sunei, with increased yields.11 High-\nvalue crop cultivation (vegetable and groundnuts) is anticipated to reach 28%\u201335% of the cropped \narea (11%\u201320% of the command area) during the dry season. The area will have market surplus \nof all crops.  \n \n8.  Two  MLI  Schemes.  The  two  sample  MLI  schemes  (Jaldha  for  groundwater  lift  and \nParimukundapur for river lift) are only partially operational at present due to the deteriorated \n                                                 \n7  Many farmers have shown interest in high-value cropping once reliable irrigation is made available in dry seasons. \n8  The yield levels for monsoon paddy are about 3.0 tons (t)/ha for irrigated areas (albeit with unreliable supply) and 2.0 \nt/ha for deprived areas, which is anticipated to reach 3.5 t/ha after the project. For dry-season crops, a 20%\u201330% \nyield increase is anticipated in presently partly irrigated areas, and slightly more for nonirrigated areas. \n9  All schemes are located in lower plateau zones and are slightly undulating.  \n10  Although distant from the state capital (120\u2013250 km) the subproject areas are relatively well connected with national \nroads, and are in close proximity of regional towns (with populations of 100,000\u2013200,000).  \n11 The reported yields for monsoon paddy are about 2.6\u20132.7 t/ha for irrigated areas and 2.0 t/ha for deprived areas at \npresent, which is expected to increase to 3.2\u20133.3 t/ha. For dry-season crops, a 20%\u201340% yield increase is \nanticipated in partly irrigated areas at present, and slightly more for nonirrigated areas. \n ", "  Appendix 11  59 \ncondition of pump sets and distribution channels. Irrigation is currently 45% of the command area \nin the monsoon and the dry seasons for Jaldha, and 25% in the monsoon and 35% in the dry \nseasons for Parimukundapur. Paddy is the sole crop produced in both areas, while Jaldha also \nhas  a  small  area  (8%  of  cropped  area)  devoted  to  vegetable  in  the  dry  season,  and \nParimukundapur has 35% of the area cultivated with high-value crops, reflecting its very good \nconnectivity and vicinity to urban centers.12 The renovation will support the expansion of the \nirrigated area to 100% of the command in both monsoon and dry seasons (and an additional \n20%\u201330% in the summer season for triple cropping), increasing the cropping intensity and yield \nlevels, although scope for yield increase in the monsoon in Jaldha is limited due to the poor \ndrainage conditions. It is expected that the share of high-value crops will increase to 20% in \nJaldha and 50% in Parimukundapur.  \nE.  Assessment of Economic Returns     \n9.  Results of the economic analysis show that the economic internal rates of return (EIRR) \nfor the MCII scheme is 18.8%, for the Taladanda scheme 22.7%, for the three medium-sized \nschemes  19.8%\u201322.0%,  and  the  two  MLI  schemes  30.1%\u201338.2%.  Switching  values  were \nestimated to determine the maximum level of cost overrun, delay in years to achieve the benefit \ntargets, reduced incremental benefits, and reduced cereal and non-cereal prices, at which the \nschemes will still be economically viable. These schemes remain economically viable with cost \noverruns of at least 51%, delay of 4\u20138 years in achieving full benefit targets, 33%\u201354% reduction \nin  incremental  benefits,  and  cereal  and  non-cereal  crop  price  reduction  of  at  least  31%.  A \nseparate sensitivity analysis of smaller diversification to high-value crops was also undertaken, \nwhich resulted in 12.3%\u201317.5% EIRRs under the assumption that the share of high-value crops \nremains the same as present for the major and medium-sized schemes.  \nF.  Impacts on Poverty     \n10.  The percentage of the poor in the subproject areas were variable among subprojects, at \n37% in the MCII extension area (population of 32,000), 22% in Taladanda (with 210,000 people), \n35%\u201369% in medium-sized schemes (total population of 101,000, with highest poverty in Sunei), \n40% in Jaldha, and 6% in Parimukundapur. Farms in these subprojects are also predominantly \nmarginal in size, with an average size of 1.0 ha in the MCII area and Taladanda, 0.9\u20131.1 ha in the \nthree medium-sized schemes, and 0.3\u20130.4 ha in the MLI schemes; landless, marginal, and small \nfarmers (up to 2 ha landholding) account for about 90% in the major and medium-sized schemes, \nand almost 100% in MLI schemes. Given that the poor households are within this group (as well \nas near-poor households with an average per capita daily income of $2/day who account for 80% \nof the total households in India), the Investment Program will have significant direct benefits to the \npoor and near-poor people. The percentage of net financial income gains that will be captured by \nlandless,  marginal,  and  small  farmers  accounts  for  74%\u201378%  in  major  and  medium-sized \nschemes, and 94%\u2013100% for MLI schemes.  \n11.  Poor people will also benefit from increased opportunities for family and hired on-farm \nlabor. Annual on-farm labor opportunities are estimated to increase by 1.56 million days for the \nMCII  scheme  and  Taladanda  combined  (of  which  0.88  million  days  will  be  hired-labor \nopportunities), and 0.94 million days for the three medium-sized schemes (of which 0.72 million \ndays will be hired-labor opportunities). It is anticipated that most hired-labor opportunities will be \nprovided to the landless and marginal farm households with less land. The increased labor \namounts to 35\u201397 days per landless and lower half of marginal family household for major and \nmedium-sized schemes, and 21\u201324 days for MLI schemes.  \n                                                 \n12 The Jaldha scheme is also closely connected with state and national roads. \n ", "60  Appendix 11 \nTable A11: Summary of Financial and Economic Analysis \nMCII Taladanda Gohira/Remal Jhalda\nItem\n(Expansion) (Renovation) (Renovation) (Renovation)\nCommand Area (ha) 5,937 32,684 8,304/ 4,313 20\n     Presently Partily/Fully Irrigated 317 21,383 6,030/ 2,729 9\n     Presently Non-Irrigated/ Deprived of Irrigation 5,620 11,301 2,274/ 1,584 11\nHouseholds 5,840 31,300 11,010 60\n     Landless 590 (10%) 2,700 (  9%) 890 (  2%) 11 (18%)\n     Marginal (Up to 1.0 ha) 2,950 (51%) 16,700 (53%) 7,200 (65%) 47 (78%)\n     Small (1.0\u20132.0 ha) 1,670 (29%) 8,400 (27%) 1,660 (17%) 2 (  3%)\n     Med/Large (Above 2 ha) 630 (10%) 3,500 (11%) 1,260 (16%) 0 (  0%)\nPopulation 32,000 210,000 47,000 60\nIncremental Net Crop Revenue (Rs'000) 119,000 337,000 86,000/48,000 300\nSubproject Cost (Rs'000) 436,000 1,064,000294,000/172,000 556\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (%) 18.8 22.7 22.0/ 19.8 30.1\nEconomic Net Present Value (Rs'000) 160,000 624,000 161,000/ 68,000 629\nSwitching Values\n    Cost Overrun (%) 51 88 77/ 55 >100%\n    Benefit Delay (years) 4.5 6 7/ 5 8\n    Incremental Benefit Shortfall (%) 33 45 42/ 34 54\n    Cereal Crop Price Reduction (%) -\u2013 -\u2013  \u2013 / 41 84\n    Non-cereal Crop Price Reduction (%) 31 48 40/ 48 46\nSensitivity Analysis\n    EIRR at same high value cropping share 14.8 17.5 16.6/ 13.9 20.2\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%) 15.0 18.7 18.8/ 17.8 21.3\nIncremental Income per Household (Rs)\n    Landless 4,180 2,750 3,720/ 3,790 1,220\n    Marginal 17,460 9,130 9,450/ 8,980 5,680\n    Small 23,790 12,900 12,480/11,670 16,730\n    Med/Large 43,400 21,750 23,030/21,430 -\n    Average 20,380 10,770 10,940/10,650 5,000\nAverage Incremental Income (Rs/ha) 20,040 10,310 10,360/11,130 15,000\nProject Investment Cost Contribution (Rs/ha) 1,303 1,010 1,302/ 1,303 3,805\nAnnual O&M Cost (Rs/ha) 569 532 509/ 469 2,300\nO&M as % of Incremental Income (average) 2.8 5.2 4.9/ 4.1 15.3\nIncremental Annual Labor Inputs ('000 days/year) 435 1,120 312/ 179 2.14\nIncremental Hired Labor ('000 days/year) 200 680 238/ 128 0.84\nCrop Production ('000 tons)\n     Total (Without Project/ With Project) 25.0/53.9 175/267 40.7/ 66.9 0.067/0.137\n     Food Grains (Without Project/ With project) 13.0/18.3 87/110 31.0/ 41.7 0.056/0.079\n     High Value Crops (without Project/ With Project) 9.4/27.1 42/  76 9.1/ 23.8 0.011/0.054\n     Others (Without Project/ With Project) 2.6/  8.5 46/  81 0.6/   1.4 0.000/0.004\nPoverty Incidence  37% 22% 35%/ 44% 40%\nShare of Net Benefits (%)\n    Landless and marginal farmers 45% 46% 52%/ 49% 89%\n    Small 33% 31% 22%/ 26% 11%\n    Medium/Large 23% 22% 26%/ 25% -\u2013\nMCII = Mahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation, O&M = operation and maintenance.\nNote: Figures for household number and crop production for Gohira and Remal are combined totals of the two. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n ", "  Appendix 12  61 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry/Project Title: India: Orissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Investment Program \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  South Asia Department / Agriculture, Natural \nMultitranche Financing Facility \nModality:  Division:  Resources, and Social Services Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nIndia\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2007\u20132012) prioritizes reducing rural\u2013urban disparity and chronic rural poverty through \ninclusive and equitable growth with a strong focus on accelerating agriculture, irrigation, and rural development. According \nto the draft Vision 2020 and 11th Five-Year Plan of the Orissa state government, accelerating economic growth to 7% per \nannum and reducing poverty by 15% during the 5-year period is targeted. Key priorities in achieving this include improving \nagriculture productivity with participatory irrigation management (PIM) and formation of water user associations (WUAs) \nand expanding nonfarm business opportunities in rural areas, along with reforms in the enabling environment for public \nsector accountability and market orientation pursued within the framework of sound macroeconomic (including fiscal and \nfinancial) management. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for India (2003\u20132006)1 expanded ADB\u2019s operations in \nagriculture, irrigation, and rural infrastructure to address the country\u2019s chronic rural poverty problems and looming water \ncrises. The new draft country partnership strategy (2008\u20132012) envisages enhanced ADB roles in rural infrastructure \ndevelopment  for  irrigation,  water  resources,  and  agriculture  marketing,  following  the  priority  of  the  sector  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s 11th FYP and ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework.2 The proposed Orissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture \nand Water Management Investment Program (the Investment Program) will support the Government\u2019s efforts to help \nreduce  rural  poverty  focusing  on  irrigation  infrastructure  development,  and  will  help  expand  their  coverage,  while \nestablishing and strengthening farmer WUAs to progressively take on operation and maintenance (O&M) and to serve as a \nplatform to promote local agricultural development through a collective and demand-driven approach. The project\u2019s scope \nincludes renovation of selected major, medium-sized, and minor lift irrigation systems within four major river basins, namely \nthe  Subernarekha,  Budhabalanga,  Baitarani,  and  Brahmani  basins,  plus  a  part  of  the  Mahanadi  River  Delta.  The \nInvestment Program objective and its design are in line with the priorities and strategic directions of the 11th FYP of the \nGovernment and the state government, ADB\u2019s draft country strategy and program, and long-term strategic framework.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nIn Orissa, poverty is predominantly a rural phenomenon as more than 85% of the poor live in rural areas and engage in \nagriculture and related nonfarm activities. As per the latest estimates of the Planning Commission, the percentage of the \npopulation below the poverty line was 46% in rural areas in 2005 as against the all-India average of 28%, and 44% in urban \nareas against the all-India average of 26%. It is much higher among indigenous peoples (IPs) and castes people. \nThe major and medium-sized irrigation subproject areas proposed for the first tranche have a poverty incidence of 22%\u2013\n69% in 2007. About 6.5% of the total households are below the \u201cabsolute poverty line\u201d in terms of calorific intake and \naccess to resources. Poverty incidence is higher in tail-end reaches of canals having less access to irrigation within the \nsubprojects, and among IPs and castes people. In these schemes, the overwhelming majority (about 80%) of the cultivators \nare landless and marginal and small farmers (with less than 2 hectares [ha] landholding) who are mostly poor or near-poor. \nThey also occupy the majority (about 70%) of the irrigation command area. Therefore, improving the irrigation system in \nterms of better coverage and equal and efficient distribution would substantially contribute to increased farm income of the \npoor and near-poor people. Improved irrigation will also contribute to job creation in agriculture as well as labor intensive \nagro-based industries by providing job opportunities for agricultural laborers and marginal farmers. With a more dynamic \nrural economy through irrigated agriculture, a multiplier effect of growth in the nonagricultural sector is also expected.  \nWithout irrigation, agricultural operations are seasonal and mostly of single-crop nature (during the monsoon, or kharif) \nwhich provides for subsistence agriculture and employment for only about 6 months a year. For the rest of the year, people \nare not fully engaged, which leads to serious underemployment and abject poverty. Small and marginal landholdings and \nuneconomical single-crop patterns do not provide for surplus yields for food processing or marketing of agricultural \nproduce. Unless there is multiple and intensive cropping many people will remain partially employed.  \nFor the rural poor, access to and control of irrigation water are of fundamental importance as water is the foundation for \nagriculture and livelihood activities, including pisciculture, agroforestry, and livestock. Irrigated agriculture is a major source \nof food and income for rural households below and above the poverty line, including smallholders and sharecroppers (the \nmajority of cultivators), who have little source of income other than agriculture. Sufficient and timely access to irrigation \nreduces vulnerability risk and increases livelihood security. Therefore, ensuring equitable and secured access to irrigation \nwater and participation in water management has a major impact on the livelihood opportunities for poor rural people. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "62  Appendix 12 \n2. Design Features  \nThe Investment Program consists of the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, including regulators and \nretention structures, sluices, canal resectioning, outlets, and field channels. Through the expansion of the irrigated area, \nand by providing water in the dry (rabi) season and improving the agricultural farming systems, the project will improve crop \nyields due to double-cropping (in monsoon and dry seasons), diversify agricultural production, and support pisciculture in \nreservoirs and canals. The formation of WUAs will empower farmers to manage water resources and organizational affairs \neffectively, as equal partners to the service provider, the Department of Water Resources (DOWR), whose accountability \nand service orientation will be improved through institutional reforms and capacity strengthening. Agricultural improvement \nand livelihood enhancement, implemented through WUAs, are particularly targeted at small and marginal farmers who \nconstitute a vulnerable group. The Investment Program also seeks to achieve poverty reduction through (i) rehabilitation \nand modernization of irrigation infrastructure to make water supply more reliable for cultivation and livestock rearing, (ii) \nempowerment of WUAs capable of managing and maintaining the irrigation system, and (iii) strengthening WUAs to \npromote agriculture intensification and diversification through a collective approach. A system of rotational irrigation water \nsupply and conjunctive use of groundwater will be promoted under the project to ensure water delivery to the farmers in the \ntail end reaches of the irrigation canal systems who are suffering greater poverty due to water deprivation. The participatory \nproject design seeks to ensure that the poor and vulnerable are actively engaged in WUA and self-help group formation as \nwell  as  planning  activities,  thereby  ensuring  ownership  by  communities,  including  their  poorest  members.  Minor \nconstruction work will also be awarded to WUAs. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.    Findings of Social Analysis \nAccording to the 2001 census, the total population of the state is 36.8 million, of which almost 80% live in rural areas. The \nIPs number over 8.1 million (22% of the state\u2019s population) and castes people number 6.1 million (17% of the state\u2019s \npopulation). The IPs are the most disadvantaged social group in Orissa, characterized by relatively low levels of literacy \nand health, and high economic deprivation. Although IPs are spread all over the state, they are primarily concentrated in \nthe southern, northern, and north-eastern districts. At the state level, literacy among the tribes is as low as 37% and the \nincidence of poverty among the rural IPs is around 64%. The infant mortality rate is 10.3% higher for Orissa\u2019s indigenous \npopulation as compared to the state\u2019s population as a whole, the under-5 mortality rate is 19.6% higher, and the child \nmortality rate is 52.7% higher. The work participation rate among the tribes is 57%. Out of this, 33% are cultivators, and \nagricultural laborers constitute 47%. The majority of workers in IP communities are thus engaged as agricultural laborers. \nAccording to the household survey in the seven subproject areas studied for the first tranche, 17% of households are \nclassified as IPs, 18% as castes people, 34% as other backward classes, and 30% as general castes. Three medium-sized \nschemes have a high percentage of IP population at 23%, 26%, and 63%, the highest being the Sunei irrigation scheme. \nOverall, around 7% of households are headed by women. The majority of people in the subproject area are landless people \n(14%) and marginal farmers (up to 1 ha of landholding, 55%\u201360%), followed by small farmers (up to 2 ha, 25%\u201328%), \nmedium farmers (up to 5 ha, 6%\u20138%) and large landholders (2%\u20133%). Around 25% of the cultivators are sharecroppers \n(and about half of them do not own land) dependent on agriculture. They have to supplement their income by seeking \nemployment as daily wage laborers. Rice cultivation in the wet season is the main economic activity for which a labor \ncontracting system with varying wage rates has evolved. Agricultural wage rates are lower than the wage rates for mining, \nconstruction, or other activities. Big farmers usually engage one laborer per 2 ha of cultivable land. Small farmers generally \nengage labor for harvest only. The average wage for male agriculture labor during the peak season is Rs55 a day. Women \nare paid much less than men. \nAccording to the social survey, although classified as IPs, the social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics of the \nindigenous people do not differ significantly from other social groups and the mainstream Hindu population. As the project \nenvisages rehabilitation and modernization of the existing irrigation infrastructure, no new infrastructure such as dams or \nreservoirs are foreseen. Potential impacts were screened with no potential adverse impacts on IPs found. As such, and with \nno land acquisition or significant environmental impacts envisaged, the subproject population overall is expected to obtain \nbenefits from the improved irrigation infrastructure and its management systems.  \nThe Investment Program will place strategic emphasis on beneficiary participation with due attention to the diversity of their \ninterests and possible vulnerability (e.g., farmers in the tail-end reaches of canals, IPs and castes people) under the \nframework of the WUAs. The strategy has four levels: (i) policy measures to equalize opportunities and access, including \nthe refinement of the WUA Act to support equal representation of farmers from head, middle, and tail reaches of irrigation \ncanal systems and increased participation of vulnerable groups including women; (ii) WUA capacity enhancement to ensure \nsound governance including representation, participatory decision making, and equal water distribution; (iii) specific actions \nand programs targeting vulnerable groups including women with establishing links to the existing poverty reduction \nprograms (such as self-help groups); and (iv) compliance with social safeguards measures.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  63 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nA participatory process was used during the project preparatory stage, and consultation, collaborative decision making, and \nempowerment exercises were carried out with women, the landless, IPs, and other vulnerable groups in the subproject area \nusing participatory rural appraisal techniques. An inventory of local needs was prepared, encompassing problems related to \n(i) water resources in relation to agriculture, fisheries and other uses; (ii) possible solutions to resolve the constraints \nidentified; and (iii) their implications for poverty reduction. The role of service providers, people\u2019s willingness to contribute to \noperations and maintenance (O&M), and the scope of enhancing impacts with micro credit and extension services, were \nalso discussed. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) were engaged to facilitate this process. The project preparatory \ntechnical assistance identified the future course of action and mechanisms to institutionalize community participation. \nThe community expectations of the benefits and impacts of the Investment Program are (i) increased agriculture and fish \nproduction, (ii) more opportunities for disadvantaged groups to become involved in farming and nonfarming activities, and \n(iii) increased income opportunities. All women interviewed expected to benefit mainly by employment and income \ngeneration through improved post-harvest work, livestock and fish production, farm and homestead production, cottage \nindustries, improved water supply and sanitation services, and access to credit. \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIn order to promote sustainability of the intervention as well as prevent implementation delays and manage conflicts, WUAs \nwill be empowered to progressively take control of the irrigation systems. Irrigation field staff and contracted NGOs will \nassist in strengthening WUAs. WUAs will prepare cropping plans, enter into irrigation management agreements with the \nDOWR, and take over O&M activities. The C&P plan focuses on empowering WUAs in the governance of irrigation systems \nand the preparation of WUA plans. NGOs will provide leadership and confidence-building, training WUAs to become \ncapable of managing and operating their schemes. Furthermore, village facilitators will be selected and trained to provide a \nsustainable mechanism for continued community-based management and development. The Investment Program will \nestablish procedures for close coordination among district administration and NGOs for effective service delivery. A budget \nof $5 million is provided for empowerment processes of WUAs, facilitated by NGOs. \nIP communities have a long tradition of participating in community-based activities but their participation in WUAs is not \neffective. During the field survey, it was observed that participation of IPs in WUAs is much less than the general population \nin executive committees and as office bearers of WUAs. In addition, they exhibit the following limiting characteristics: little \nland in the command area, traditional agricultural practices with low returns, limited access to bank loans and farm inputs, \nand less access to water. Consequently, quite often they are unable to secure meaningful representation in the process of \ndecision making in community affairs and in the development processes. Therefore, attempts will be made to ensure that \nsocially weaker sections of society are equally represented in the WUAs and receive the benefits. Training and income-\ngenerating activities to minimize the existing economic imbalances of the IPs have been planned. For this purpose an IP \nspecific action was developed, which defines the strategy and activities for the empowerment of vulnerable people. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nDue to unequal access of women to productive resources and the gender discrimination within traditional households, \nwomen bear a disproportionately high burden of poverty. Lack of autonomy within the household and social restrictions on \nmobility prevent women from accessing education, skills training, and health facilities as well as labor markets. Besides \nhousehold chores, rural women are major contributors to the rural economy in crop and livestock production, and cottage \nindustries. In addition, women spend a large part of their time gathering water and firewood for household use. A strategy \nfor gender mainstreaming was formulated taking these features into consideration. \n2.  Key Actions.

The project will give specific attention to \nemployment  of  female  staff  at  all  levels  and  train  field  staff  in  gender-sensitive  and  participatory  planning  and \nimplementation. Furthermore, the gender action plan will (i) ensure labor employment opportunities generated by the \nproject and O&M works, (ii) train women to be involved in WUAs and all aspects of O&M; (iii) support women's work in farm \nand homestead production; (iv) strengthen the extension system to be gender-equitable; (v) identify and respond to \nwomen's agricultural and household needs for technology in close collaboration with implementing agencies and NGOs; (vi) \nsupport  women  in  their  home-based  post-harvest  production  and  marketing  activities;  (vii)  improve  processing  of \nagricultural produce and diversify to high-value vegetable production; (viii) support credit and savings groups; (ix) provide \nwomen with training in crop and horticulture production, poultry and small livestock rearing, fisheries, and processing.  \n ", "64  Appendix 12 \nIII.

The  Orissa  Integrated  Irrigated  Agriculture  and  Water \nManagement Investment Program (the Investment Program) aims to enhance the productivity \nand sustainability of irrigation systems in the four northern river basins plus a part of the \nMahanadi  River  Delta.  Following  the  modality  of  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  and \nenvisaging the coverage of five major and nine medium-sized irrigation schemes, and up to \n1,400 community-based minor lift irrigation schemes, its specific scope includes (i) participatory \nplanning with strengthening of water user associations; (ii) renovation and extension of irrigation \nand associated infrastructure including field channel systems; (iii) agriculture and allied sector \nsupport and livelihood enhancement of the poor; and (iv) monitoring and support for sustainable \noperation and maintenance, along with project management and institutional development. All \nare existing schemes proposed for renovation, except for one scheme (the Mahanadi Chitropala \nIsland Irrigation subproject) that will expand its canal systems to about 5,940 hectares (ha) of \nnew command area to complete its original scope of investment. \n \n2.   For the purpose of the first Project under MFF, feasibility studies were undertaken for \ntwo major, three medium-sized, and two minor lift irrigation subprojects including the Mahanadi \nChitropala Island Irrigation subproject. This resettlement framework (RF) outlines the policy, \nprocedures, and institutional requirements for preparing and implementing resettlement plans \n(RPs) for the subprojects to be included in the Investment Program.   \n  \n3.    Resettlement Policy. Resettlement will be implemented in accordance with the Land \nAcquisition Act and the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation 2007 (Government \nof  India),  the  Orissa  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Policy  2006,  and  the  relevant  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policies  and  operations  manuals,  in  particular  the  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and the Operations Manual section on involuntary resettlement.1 \n \n4.  Resettlement  Principles,  Entitlements,  and  Procedures.  The  RF  applies  to  all \ninvoluntary resettlement effects\u2014including displacement of nontitled people\u2014arising from land \nacquisition or conversion, or any other effects that arise from the project works including the \neffects on people with no title to the land. Those affected will be entitled to maintain at least their \nstandard of living at pre-project level, and to receive compensation for all types of losses \nincluding land, crops, trees, structures, and any other assets at full replacement value. Affected \nhouseholds will receive (i) an additional cash grant to match replacement value to supplement \nthe grant provided by the district collector, and (ii) other resettlement assistance such as shifting \nallowances and compensation for loss of workdays and income due to dislocation. Households \nbelonging to scheduled tribes, if any, will be eligible for further cash assistance for relocation \nand house reconstruction. People involuntarily displaced will receive priority assistance under \nthe Investment Program\u2019s livelihood enhancement subcomponent.  \n \n5.  The types of loss and entitlements will cover (i) loss of titleholders, including agricultural \nland,  homestead  land  and  assets,  commercial  land  and  structure,  residential  tenancy  and \ncommercial tenancy; (ii) loss of nontitleholders, including agriculture land possessed by informal \ntenants  (including  sharecroppers),  squatters  and  encroachers,  homestead  land  and/or \nhomestead  and  commercial  structure  possessed  by  informal  tenants,  squatters  and \nencroachers,  shifting  business,  and  kiosks;  (iii)  loss  of  livelihoods  (loss  of  wage  earnings, \nincomes from nonperennial and/or perennial crops such as fruit trees); (iv) additional support to \nvulnerable groups, including negative impacts on scheduled tribe families; (v) loss of community \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

The project management unit (PMU) \nhas overall planning, financing, and supervisory responsibility for preparing and implementing \nthe RPs, with the support of the consultants, including capacity strengthening and monitoring. \nThe PMU will have a land acquisition and resettlement manager assigned from among the \nsenior  staff  of  the  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  directorate  of  the  Department  of  Water \nResources (DOWR), under the guidance of the project director. The specific works will be \ncarried  out by  the  subproject  implementation  offices  (SIOs),  which  will  have  a  specialized \nresettlement  unit  comprising  experienced  officers  from  the  resettlement  and  rehabilitation \ndirectorate in case any subprojects require the preparation and implementation of a RP. The \nresettlement unit will work closely with the district compensation advisory committee for the \nreplacement valuation of the assets. Compensation will be awarded by the district office, and \nthe  resettlement  unit  will  pay  any  difference  between  the  award  rates  and  the  values  as \nstipulated in the RP. The PMU will engage experienced nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nto assist in the process. For future subprojects, the PMU with the assistance of the consultants \nwill undertake assessments on social impacts; resettlement due diligence will be undertaken \nbased on preliminary technical designs, and full or short RPs will be prepared as necessary. \nThe draft RPs as prepared will be submitted to ADB for approval.2 Affected persons (APs) will \nbe fully compensated before award of the relevant civil works contracts.    \n   \n7.  Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievances. The RP will be prepared and implemented \nin  close  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group  discussions  and \nmeetings with the APs, with disclosure of information in the form of brochures written in the local \nlanguage. Copies of the RF and draft RPs will be distributed among NGOs and community \ngroups prior to finalizing the engineering design. They will also be disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite. A grievance redress committee will be established headed by the district collector and \ncomprising representatives of the APs, local governments, and the NGOs to resolve any AP \ngrievances. People\u2019s participation will also be ensured by including APs representatives with \nNGO facilitation in the district compensation advisory committee.     \n \n8.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  DOWR,  with  assistance  from  the  consultant \nresettlement specialist, will establish a monthly monitoring system involving the PMU, SIOs, and \nimplementing  NGOs,  and  prepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement (covering staff appointment and capacities, planning, scheduling and budgeting; \ndelivery of entitlements; consultation, grievance, and other issues; and resettlement impacts) in \nthe quarterly reports. An annual report stipulating all efforts and outcome will be submitted to \nADB. External monitoring will also be assigned to an independent local agency, which will \nreview the progress and performance of RP preparation and implementation, and report the \nfindings and recommendations to the DOWR and ADB.  \n \n9.  Resettlement Cost. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated at $4.7 \nmillion including NGO services, based on the assessment of the replacement value of the land \nand assets to be acquired. The Orissa state government will provide the entire fund for land \nacquisition and resettlement, and will guarantee meeting unforeseen obligations in excess of the \nbudget estimate to meet the resettlement objectives. \n                                                 \n2  In the event that the RPs are revised with the process of the detailed designs, such revised RPs will also be \nsubmitted to ADB for approval. \n ", "  Appendix 14  67 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATIONS \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  In accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines, initial environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) were carried out as part of the project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA)  for  the  Orissa  Integrated  Irrigated  Agriculture  and  Water  Management  Investment \nProgram. The IEEs assessed the environmental implications of the specific loan interventions \nand identified mitigating measures. In view of the diversity, scale, and extent of the project \ninterventions, IEEs for all major and medium-sized irrigation subprojects for the first tranche of \nthe multitranche financing facility (MFF Project 1) were prepared, along with the IEEs for sample \nsubprojects for minor lift irrigation subprojects\u2014Gohira (medium-sized irrigation), Taladanda \n(major  irrigation),  Mahanadi  Chitropala  Island  (major  irrigation),  Remal  (medium-sized \nirrigation), Sunei (medium-sized irrigation), Jaldha (minor lift irrigation), and Parimukundapur \n(minor lift irrigation). Project 1 has been classified as environmental category B.  \n \n2.  The Investment Program focuses on planning within the five contiguous basins of the \nstate by adopting a basin management approach to support the state\u2019s critical agenda for \nenhancing the productivity and sustainability of existing underutilized major, medium-sized, and \nminor  (lift)  irrigation  projects.  The  basins  are  the  Brahmani,  Baitarani,  Budhabalanga,  and \nSubernarekha (covering 29% of the state and supporting 33% of the overall population). It also \nincludes part of Mahanadi River Delta. The Investment Program aims to reduce the regional \nimbalance in infrastructure development and to increase the productivity including remote areas \nthrough sustainable water management with participatory irrigation management (PIM) and \nadopting an integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach.  \n \nB.  Environment Conditions for the Investment Program Areas \n3.  Orissa is rich in surface and groundwater resources, and receives approximately 231 \nbillion cubic meters (m3) of rainfall annually, of which approximately 80% flows to the ocean as \nsurface runoff.1 There are a total of 11 river basins in Orissa, of which the Mahanadi is the \nbiggest  river  system.  The  state  covers  155.7  square  kilometers,  and  its  land  utilization \ncomprises cultivated area (45%), forest (37%), nonagricultural land (6%), barren land (5%), and \nothers (7%). The forest area has rich flora and fauna,2 but is increasingly under pressure due to \nillegal logging, fuel wood collection, agriculture and pastoral encroachment, forest fires, mining, \nand other related development activities. The natural regeneration in many forests is poor due \nto forest fire. Intense grazing and other human activities, invasion of exotic species, and loss of \nendemic flora and fauna, are other problems related to forest degradation.  \n \n4.  While the state\u2019s water resources are abundant overall, river flows have high spatial and \ntemporal variation due to the high concentration of rainfall within an 80-day period each year. As \nsuch, the available flow cannot provide irrigation to the full command area of most irrigation \nsystems. In addition, the state has substantial mineral deposits, the exploitation of which is \nputting increasing pressure on the environment, in particular on water quality. The ongoing and \nplanned industrial development is adding further pressure and concern. These issues call for \ncoordinated water use within and among the irrigation and other users, in particular for the dry \nseason, and effective monitoring and regulation of water quality within the context of IWRM.  \n                                                 \n1  In 2001 the average availability of surface water was 120 billion cubic meters (m3), or 3,280 m3 per person, and \ngroundwater availability was 13 billion m3, or 340 m3 per person. \n2  There are six main forest types found in the state of Orissa, namely tropical semi-evergreen, tropical moist \ndeciduous, tropical dry deciduous, subtropical broad-leaved hill, and scattered littoral and mangrove forests. \n ", "68  Appendix 14 \n5.  The project strategy of rehabilitating the existing schemes in an effort to improve the \nreliability of diversion and efficiency in water use with institutional development will mean that \npotential environmental impacts will generally be positive. Potential environmental concerns \ninclude water-use conflicts and quality deterioration in areas of water scarcity, particularly in the \ndry season. Water and soil quality may also be affected as a result of enhanced agricultural \nactivities in the concerned schemes. Given that subproject works are generally on a small scale \nand  confined  to  existing  agricultural  land,  they  can  be  kept  minimal  with  little  cumulative \nimpacts, through due environmental consideration to screening, planning, and implementation.  \nC.  Summary of Initial Environmental Examinations Prepared for Subprojects \n6.  Subproject Description. Key features of the subprojects are summarized Table A14.1.  \nTable A14.1: Summary of Scope of Principal Works for Subprojects \nMajor: Taladanda and Mahanadi  Medium-sized: Gohira,  Minor Lift: Jaldha and \nItem \nChitropala Island Irrigation (MCII)  Remal, and Sunei  Parimukundapur \nLocation  Mahanadi River Delta (Stage I  Gohira: Brahmani basin  Jaldha: Subernarekha basin \narea)  Remal: Baitarani basin  Parimukundapur: Brahmani \nSunei: Budhabalanga basin  basin \nSubproject  Taladanda: Renovation  Renovation  Renovation \ntype  MCII: Extension \nCommand  Taladanda: 32,700 ha  Gohira: 8,300 ha; Remal:  Jaldha: 20 ha (groundwater) \narea  MCII: 13,300 ha (5,940 ha new)  4,310 ha; Sunei: 10,000 ha  Parimukundapur: 40 ha (river) \nNature and  Taladanda: Canal system  Combined Total: Minor  Jaldha: Electrical installation, \nscope of  renovation (83 km main, 115 km  repair of reservoir facilities,  pump house renovation, buried \nheadwork and  distributary, and 386 km minor),  canal renovation (96 km  distribution system with \ncanal network  cross regulators, inspection roads  distributary and 234 km  distribution box, CAD. \nimprovements  and bridges, minor drainage, and  minor), ancillary facilities  Parimukundapur: two pump \ncommand area development (CAD)  (cross regulators, inspection  units, electrical installation, \nMCII: Extension of branch (52 km)  roads, drop structures, etc.),  distribution systems with \nand minor (61 km), and ancillary  CAD  distribution box, CAD \nstructures (e.g., cross-drainage   \nworks, canal bridges), CAD \nCAD = command area development, MCII = Mahanadi Chitropala Island Irrigation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n7.  The above physical works will be accompanied by support for institutional strengthening \nincluding water user association strengthening, agriculture and allied sector support services \nsuch as agriculture extension and exposure visits, and livelihood enhancement of the poor to \nsupport their capacities for income generation.   \n8.  Potential  Environmental  Impacts  and  Mitigation  Measures.  Based  on  the \nenvironmental assessment of the subprojects, the following impacts and mitigation measures \nhave been summarized for the Investment Program. \nTable A14.2: Summary of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \nImpact  Mitigation Measures  \nA.

Public  consultation  and  disclosure  was  completed  during  the \nproject preparatory TA in the subproject areas. Activities consisted of disseminating project \ninformation  among  stakeholders  combined  with  household  surveys  and  focus-group \ndiscussions. Stakeholders\u2019 views of the proposed project and their concerns have been taken \ninto account and incorporated into the project design. Specific details of this are provided in \nindividual IEE reports that have been prepared. Continued public participation from design to \noperation will be an important aspect of all subproject works, which will be carried out through \nthe water user associations. \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n10.  At  the  Department  of  Water  Resources  (DOWR)  headquarters,  a  central  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be set up and will be responsible for overall implementation of the \nproject  including  environmental  management.  The  PMU  will  have  an  environmental  cell \ncomprising  a  senior  environmental  engineer  having  sufficient  experience  in  environmental \nmanagement  of  irrigation  projects  who  is  seconded  from  Department  of  Forest  and \nEnvironment,  along  with  designated  environmental  engineers  from  the  Orissa  Planning \nOrganization of the DOWR. The environmental cell will bear overall responsibility for preparing \nthe IEE and/or environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports of the further subprojects under \nthe  multitranche  financing  facility  in  coordination  with  the  external  agencies,  obtaining \nenvironmental clearances as necessary, and implementation of environmental management \nplans at the subproject level. At each subproject level, a subproject implementation office will be \nset up, where an assistant executive engineer will be assigned as chief officer responsible for \nenvironmental  management.  A  total  budget  of  $770,000  has  been  assigned  to  cover  the \nnecessary  costs  for  IEE  and  EIA  reports  of  further  subprojects,  and  staffing  including \ninstitutional strengthening activities.  \n \n11.  Based on the IEE and stakeholder consultation and following ADB guidelines and the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  requirements,3 project-specific  environmental  assessment  and \nreview  framework  (EARF)  were  prepared  (Supplementary  Appendix  O).4 Under  the  EARF, \nenvironmental considerations are made fundamental to the Investment Program approach and \nwill be introduced from a very early stage of subproject selection and planning.5 Emphasis will \nbe placed on incorporating environmental considerations into each stage of the subproject \ncycle; for example, avoiding environmental damage as far as possible through proper planning; \nminimizing the damage risk through environmentally sensitive design and the use of sound \ntechnology; and controlling potential damage through proper management practices employed \nduring the implementation phase. The proposed environmental planning and mitigation works \nhave been elaborated upon in detail in the environmental management plan and have been \nfurther expanded in the EARF document where efforts have been made to ensure that this work \nis consistent with the environmental guidelines of the state and national Government.  \n                                                 \n3  Including the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006; Water and \nAir Acts, Forest Act, 1980; and Wild Life Act, 1972, among others.  \n4  In the context of MFF Project 1, DOWR and PMU will be responsible for preparing environmental assessment for \nabout 650 minor lift irrigation schemes to be identified during the implementation period following the EARF. \n5  The environmental impacts of the proposed subprojects will ultimately depend on type, size, and location. The \nEARF has incorporated (i) environmental criteria for subproject eligibility, planning, design, and implementation; \nand (ii) individual screening and assessment of each subproject as to the potential impacts on the environment. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080912170051+08'00'", "Creator": "Adobe Acrobat 6.0", "ModDate": "D:20130228172946+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe Acrobat 6.0"}, "author_page": " \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  WALMI  \u2013  Water and Land Management Institute \n  WUA  \u2013  water user association \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government of India ends on 31 March. \u201cFY\u201d before a \ncalendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., FY2007 ends \non 31 March 2007.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \n \nVice-President  B.
