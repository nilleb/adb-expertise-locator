The  proposed\nProject supports the new focus and has been included in ADB\u2019s lending program for 2001 and\nwas prepared under ADB project preparatory TA1 completed in January 2001.  The Project is an\nintegral  part  of  the  least-cost  development  plan  for  the  power  sector,  and  is  accorded  high\npriority  by  the  Government.    The  Appraisal  Mission  was  conducted  from  14  to  26  September\n2001.2  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  TA  report  and  the  Appraisal  Mission,  and\ninformation provided by the Government. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nLocation\n\nThe  Maldives  comprises  about  1,200  varied  and  diverse  islands,  grouped  into  20\n3.\nadministrative  atolls.3  The  islands  form  a  chain  of  820  kilometers  (km)  long  and  130  km  at  its\nwidest point, set in the Indian Ocean to the southwest of India. Only 33 inhabited islands have a\nland area of more than 1 km2, and only 3 each have an area larger than 3 km2. The Maldives\nhas no rivers, lakes, or streams. While there are occasional gales (on average 12 days a year)\nand  tropical  thunderstorms  (on  average  23  days  a  year),  the  Maldives  lies  outside  the  main\nareas of tropical cyclones.\n\nThe Maldives population of 269,010 is scattered in about 200 inhabited islands4 and 83\n4.\nresort  islands.  About  20  islands  have  more  than  2,000  people;  50  islands  1,000-2,000;  80\nislands, 500-1,000; and 50 islands, less than 500 people. The widely dispersed population and\nthe economic  constraints  imposed  by  lack  of  land-based resources and the diseconomies of\n\n                  \n\n1 TA 3232-MLD: Preparing the Outer Islands Electrification Project, for $300,000, approved on 30 July 1999.\n2  The  Appraisal  Mission  comprised  P.B.  Song,  Mission  Leader  and  Project  Engineer;  J.  Kuiper,  Senior  Project\nEconomist; C. Wee, Senior Counsel; S. Tukuafu, Financial Management Specialist; and L. Gunaratne, Renewable\nEnergy Consultant.\n\n3  In the Maldives, the term \"atoll\" is normally associated with a group of inhabited islands. The term \"outer islands\" is\nused in  this report to refer to outer  inhabited islands, and to differentiate these  from  the capital island and  those\nthat are used for tourist resorts.\n\n4 Inhabited islands are defined as islands with a local population and an administrative office. They do not include\n\ntourist resorts and industrial islands.\n\n\f2\n\nscale  associated  with  small  populations  on  islands  have  all  contributed  to  considerable\ninequalities of development, which the Government has tried to address. A policy to ensure that\nbenefits  of  development  are  shared  in  a  balanced  manner  among  the  population  is  a  central\nfeature of the country's priorities and development plans.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\n5.\nEconomic growth has been strong, with an annual average rate of 10 percent during the\n1970s and 1980s, and 6-7 percent in the 1990s. The economy is expected to grow at the rate of\n5-6  percent  over  the  next  five  years.  Per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2000  was\nprovisionally estimated at $2,059.5  The population growth rate is relatively high, averaging 3.4\npercent  during  1985-1990  and  falling  to  1.9  percent  during  1995-2000.  Assuming  the  current\nmortality rate, a reduction in fertility rates, and no migration, the population is expected to reach\n300,000  by  2005  and  500,000  by  2023.  The  rapid  population  growth  rate  coupled  with  high\neconomic  growth  continues  to  place  a  significant  demand  for  infrastructure  and  financial\nresources in the country.\n\n6.\nA quarter of the national population or about 70,000 people live in the capital island of\nMal\u00e9, which has a land area of only 2.1 km2. It is crowded and has one of the highest population\ndensities in the region. The 1995 census indicated that most of Mal\u00e9\u2019s population is housed in\ndwellings  accommodating  over  10  people,  with  a  quarter  of  the  households  accommodating\nover  14  people.  Despite  the  Government\u2019s  efforts,  the  large  disparities  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the\nouter islands continue to widen. There is significant migration from the outer islands to Mal\u00e9 for\nbetter income and living standards. Providing the outer islands with a reliable and sustainable\nelectricity supply will help reduce the disparities and ease the substantial population pressures\non Mal\u00e9.\n\n3. \n\nThe Power Sector\n\na.\n\nEnergy Situation\n\n7.\nThe  Maldives  has  no  known  indigenous  petroleum,  gas,  or  coal  resources  and\nhydropower  is  not  feasible  because  of  the  topography.  Firewood  and  petroleum  are  the  only\ncommercial fuels and firewood is a common cooking fuel on most of the outer islands. The loss\nof  tree  cover  has  become  serious  and  the  Government  has  restricted  on  cutting  and  requires\nthat  for  each  tree  cut,  two  must  be  planted.  However,  it  is  unable  to  enforce  the  regulation\nproperly  and  much  firewood  is  cut  illegally.    Petroleum  is  imported  as  refined  product  by  the\nState  Trading  Organization  and  a  number  of  private  entrepreneurs.  Diesel  is  largely  used  to\ngenerate electricity in the capital, and for about 1,000 electricity generators in the outer islands.\nIt  is  expected  that  the  country  will  continue  to  rely  on  imported  petroleum  fuel  for  power\ngeneration.  Petroleum  products  are  also  used  for  transportation,  fishing,  household  cooking,\nand  other  minor  uses.  Petroleum  product  imports  account  for  a  significant  percentage  of  total\nimports.  Solar energy is used in traditional ways, such as for drying fish and for heating water in\nsome resorts. It is also harnessed for remote area telecommunications and navigational aids.\n\nb.\n\nGeneral Structure of the Sector\n\nVarious  organizations  provide  electricity  in  the  Maldives  including  the  State  Electric\n8.\nisland  development  committees  (IDCs),  nongovernment\nCompany  Limited  (STELCO), \norganizations  (NGOs),  and  private  companies.  STELCO  is  currently  responsible  for  supplying\nelectricity to Mal\u00e9 and to 20 of the larger outer islands, altogether more than half of the nation\u2019s\n\n5 The GDP series was revised recently. Prior to the revision, per capita GDP in 1999 was $1,488.\n\n                  \n\n\f3\n\npopulation.  STELCO  was  established  in  1997  under  a  Presidential  Decree  pursuant  to  the\nCompanies Act. It is fully owned by the Government and was formed specifically to succeed the\nutility  part  of  the  Maldives  Electricity  Board,  a  Government-owned  and  -controlled  institution\nestablished  in  1982.  The  Maldives  Electricity  Bureau  (MEB)  succeeded  the  regulatory  part  of\nthe Maldives Electricity Board in 1998. STELCO, formerly the Maldives Electricity Board, began\noperating in 1982, serving only the island of Mal\u00e9. Its operations were expanded to 5 islands in\n1990, 17 in 1996, and 20 in 2000.\n\n9.\nThe  IDCs  are  community-based  extensions  of  the  Government  and  are  the  grassroot\ninstitutions in the development of the islands.  NGOs running power supply systems range from\ncommunity-based  formal  and  registered  organizations  to  informal  community  clubs  using  the\nsale  of  electricity  as  a  fund-raising  activity.  The  private  sector  companies  are  operated  and\nowned  by  small-scale  family  entrepreneurs,  or  by  substantial  private  companies.  Some  outer\nislands have more than one electricity provider, often supplying the same geographic area. Of\n97 focus islands,6 about 50 have electricity systems owned and operated by IDCs, 20 by private\ncompanies, 10 by NGOs, and 20 by STELCO. Regulating generation, distribution, and utilization\nincluding tariff setting is the responsibility of MEB. At present, electricity generation is entirely by\ndiesel-based  generators.  Distribution  is  almost  exclusively  by  underground  cables,  using  low-\nvoltage,  three-phase,  four-wire  400/230  volt  cables  augmented  by  11  kV  high-voltage  cables\nwhere  needed.  Except  on  the  largest  islands,  distribution  from  the  power  station  is  by  low-\nvoltage cables.\n\n10.\nBoth  electricity  tariffs  and  tariff  structures  vary  between  islands  since  tariff-setting\nmechanisms are under de facto decentralized decision making with consideration for the local\ncontext.7  In Mal\u00e9, the electricity tariffs are Rf2.0-Rf4.0 ($0.16-$0.31) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). In\nouter islands with electricity supplied by STELCO, tariffs are Rf2.5-Rf4.0 ($0.20-$0.31) per kWh.\nFor  the  outer  islands  with  private  companies  or  local  communities  supplying  electricity,  the\naverage tariffs are usually in the range of Rf3.50-Rf6.00 ($0.27-$0.47) per kWh, and can be as\nhigh  as  Rf10.00  ($0.78)  per  kWh  in  some  islands.  Unlike  in  many  other  developing  countries,\ncollecting the electricity bill  has  not  been an issue in the Maldives. Most households pay their\ndues on time partly due to peer pressure in the small and closed nature of island society.\n\nc.\n\nThe Project Area\n\n11.\nDespite the recent marked improvement in macroeconomic indicators, poverty still exists\nin the Maldives. About three quarters of the Maldives\u2019 population live in the outer islands. Their\nlivelihoods  depend  on  small  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  limited  public  sector  employment.\nAlthough an official poverty line for the Maldives has not yet been established, the Vulnerability\nand  Poverty  Assessment  (VPA)  report  conducted  in  1998  by  the  Government,  with  the\nassistance  of \nthat\napproximately  50  percent  of  the  outer  island  populations  live  on  less  than  Rf15.08  per  person\nper day. This incidence of poverty is more than double the percentage in Mal\u00e9.\n\nthe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  estimates \n\n                  \n\n6 The Government selected these focus islands for accelerated development, taking into account their administrative\nimportance,  population,  potential  for  development,  etc.  (para.  23).  The  focus  islands  also  include  islands  where\nelectricity is supplied by STELCO.\n\n7  In the Maldives, all power supply utilities are required to submit proposals for their own tariff structures and levels to\n\nthe Maldives Electricity Bureau for endorsement.\n\n8  Equivalent  to  $1.27  based  on  the  prevailing  exchange  rate  at  the  time  of  the  study.  This  poverty  line  is  used\n\nthroughout the report.\n\n\f4\n\n12.\nThe  percentage  of  the  population  with  access  to  electricity  has  rapidly  grown  over  the\nlast decade. In 1990, it was estimated that one third of the nation's population had no access to\nelectricity. The percentage had fallen to 13 percent by 1995, and to 7 percent in 1998. Although\naccess to electricity has improved considerably, electricity supply systems in the outer islands\nare  generally  inadequate.  Operation  hours  are  often  restricted,  quality  is  usually  poor,  and\nsystems are inefficient. Poor quality of electricity supply suppresses demand, as customers are\noften  reluctant  to  invest  in  electrical  appliances,  which  have  only  a  short  operating  life.\nCurrently,  many of the outer island population have access to electricity for only 5-12 hours a\nday.  The  efficiency  of  power  supply  systems  in  most  of  the  outer  islands  is  low.  Undersized\ncables,  inaccurate  customer  meters,  mismatch  of  the  system  to  the  load,  and  inefficient\ngenerating  plants  have  all  led  to  high  system  losses.  The  unreliable  electricity  supply  in  the\nouter islands limits the living standards of the population, inhibits a wide range of development\non  the  islands,  and  increases  the  vulnerability  of  the  population.  The  VPA  report  identified\nadequate electricity supply as one of the key variables in the human vulnerability index (HVI) for\nthe  Maldives.  Access  to  reliable  and  adequate  electricity  supply  contributes  to  well-being,  and\nsocial  and  human  resource  development,  and  provides  greater  opportunities  for  income-\ngenerating activities.\n\n13.\nEach year, the Ministry of Atolls Administration (MAA) has provided about 20 electrical\ngenerators with capacity ranging from 15 kW to 80 kW to the outer islands on an adhoc grant\nbasis.  Over  a  three-year  period,  about  50  islands  have  received  generators  as  a  free  gift.  In\naddition, MAA has administered development loans with a revolving fund scheme in the amount\nof  Rf20  million  for  island  electrification  from  the  Government  Treasury  Fund  and  the  Bank  of\nMaldives. Until April 2001, 17 islands had received assistance amounting to Rf6.3 million from\nthe Treasury loan scheme, and 39 islands had received loans amounting to Rf8.6 million from\nthe Bank of Maldives.  The repayment period is usually five years including a six-month grace\nperiod. The interest rate of the Treasury loan is 8 percent per annum. In the case of the Bank of\nMaldives, the interest rate is 12 percent, but MAA subsidizes 4 percent annually from its budget,\nmaking  the  actual  interest  rate  equivalent  to  8  percent  per  annum.  These  financing  schemes\nhave  helped  the  islands,  but  are  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  demand  for  upgrading  the  power\nsupply systems in the outer islands.\n\nThe safety standards in distribution networks and house wiring are poor, largely due to\n14.\nlack of skilled manpower to properly inspect and test the equipment and electrical installations.\nSmall private suppliers especially tend to ignore the quality of supply requirements, and literally\ngenerate electricity out of a backroom in their home. This is a major concern of the customers,\nwho invariably rate improved reliability and quality of supply as very important. The Government\nhas realized the problem and initiated internal discussions about placing MEB staff or appointing\nMEB  representatives  in  each  of  the  atolls  to  carry  out  the  regulatory  and  inspection  function\nproperly.\n\n4.\n\nKey Sector Issues\n\na.\n\nRegional Development\n\n15.\nRegional  disparity  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the  outer  islands  has  continued  to  be  a  key\ndevelopment  issue.    According  to  the  VPA  report,  income  disparities  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the\nouter islands were in the order of 2:1, with the ratio increasing to 3:1 when the lowest average\nper  capita  income  is  considered.  In  addition,  inequalities  in  access  to  social  and  physical\ninfrastructure  and  services  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the  outer  islands  were  found  to  be  far  more\npronounced,  averaging  4:1  on  a  composite  index  that  took  account  of  various  indicators.  The\nrapid growth of the population in the Maldives has increased the urgency of providing a broad\nrange  of  social  and  physical  infrastructure  in  the  outer  islands.  The  wide  dispersal  of  the\n\n\f5\n\npopulation  inevitably  raises  the  costs  in  providing  these  services.  It  is  recognized  that  an\nexcessive development focus on Mal\u00e9 will constrain the future growth of the country. Therefore,\nregional development is considered as a key factor in easing the development pressure on Mal\u00e9\nand at the same time addressing equity concerns.\n\nb.\n\nInstitutional Capacity of Island Power Utilities\n\n16.\nExcept  for  those  islands  where  electricity  is  supplied  by  STELCO,  the  outer  island\ncommunities  and  the  island  administration  are  generally  incapable  of  proper  operation  and\nmaintenance (O&M) of power supply systems. They do not have the level of specialized utility\nmanagement  skills  required  to  operate  the  power  supply  systems  at  optimal  level,  and  do  not\nadequately  take  account  of  the  long-term  capital  replacement  requirements.  Almost  all  power\nstation  managers  and  operators  lack  the  skills  needed  to  efficiently  operate  a  power  supply\nsystem.  There  is  no  appreciation  of  the  need  to  monitor  the  efficiencies  of  operations,  fuel\nconsumption,  or  distribution  losses.    Furthermore,  bookkeeping  and  cost-accounting  systems\nare very simple, and sometimes totally neglected.  There is a critical need to build the capacity\nof outer island power supply utilities to efficiently manage and operate power supply systems.\n\nc.\n\nLending Practices and Legal Issues\n\nAt present, many outer island power supply systems are run by the communities through\n17.\nIDCs, or NGOs such as clubs and associations.  Although these groups are generally accepted\nby  the  communities,  they  are  not  legal  entities  and  there  is  confusion  about  ownership  of  the\nassets  and  liabilities.  Furthermore,  currently  no  laws  in  the  Maldives  recognize  IDCs,  island\ncommunities, or island community groups as legal entities. Nevertheless, it is common practice\nfor the Government or the Bank of Maldives to lend to island community groups such as IDCs\nfor development purposes. Such loans are provided by the Bank of Maldives with a government\nguarantee. In the case of loans from the Government's revolving Treasury Fund, island chiefs\nare  required  to  acknowledge  receipt  of  loans  on  behalf  of  the  island  communities.  IDCs  and\ninformal  island  groups  are  also  able  to  obtain  small  commercial  loans  for  capital  investments.\nExcept for a few rare cases, the Government or the Bank of Maldives has not had problems with\nloan repayment by the island communities.\n\n18.\nThe  Government,  however,  wishes  to  ensure  that  island  communities  are  legally\naccountable for using and repaying the loans as well as for the power supply. The Government\nconsiders it important to legalize these power supply utilities so as to effectively regulate them\nas well as to instill a culture of accountability and self-governance in island communities.\n\n19.\nThe  Government  has  considered  various  options  of  legalizing  the  outer  island  power\nsupply  utilities  under  current  Maldivian  law,  in  particular  the  Companies  Act  (10/96).  It\nconcluded  that  the  existing  legal  framework  could  not  be  applied  to  achieve  the  objectives  of\ncommunity ownership and involvement, without significant distortion of the intents and purposes\nof the Companies Act. The Government therefore decided to prepare new legislation to provide\nfor legal electricity cooperatives to be established on the outer islands following the community-\nbased  approach,  or  amend  the  existing  laws  to  permit  recognition  of  IDCs  and  other  island\ncommunity groups as legal entities. Where an existing electricity supplier is a private company\nlegally  established  under  the  Companies  Act  and  the  island  community  prefers,  the  private\ncompany may continue to supply electricity on that island.\n\n\f6\n\nd.\n\nSector Regulation\n\n20.\nIn January 1998, the Government established MEB to succeed the regulatory part of the\nMaldives Electricity Board and gave it responsibility for establishing the standards of electricity\nsupply,  regulating  the  electricity  service  providers,  and  setting  tariffs.  It  has  an  immense  task,\nconsidering the widely dispersed geography of the country and the need for qualified people to\nprepare the regulatory codes and standards, inspect, and test equipment and site, and regulate\nelectricity  tariffs.  Yet,  MEB  has  only  a  skeleton  staff  and  its  current  operational  practices  are\nadhoc  and  informal.  There  is  no  national  regulatory  code  and  standards  for  electricity  supply,\nleading to poor safety and quality standards of power supply systems, particularly in the outer\nislands. Further, MEB needs to develop more comprehensive pricing principles for setting tariffs.\nStrengthening MEB and establishing a national code and standards for electricity supply are the\nGovernment's priorities.\n\n21.\nThe safety standards in distribution networks and house wiring in the outer islands are\nbeing  compromised  due  to  lack  of  skilled  people  to  inspect  and  test  the  equipment  and  sites.\nEach island chief is expected to assist MEB in ensuring that MEB regulations are complied with,\nwhile at the same time he is in charge of the IDC that may be operating the electricity supply\nutility.  Given the conflicting obligations and responsibilities, it is often impossible to enforce the\nMEB  regulations  properly.  It  is  therefore  important  that  at  least  one  electrical  inspector\nrepresenting MEB be stationed in most of the atolls. This would enable MEB to encourage and\nenforce compliance with its regulations in the islands. In some locations, an electrical inspector\nmay be shared between atolls.\n\ne.\n\nEnvironmental Protection\n\n22.\nAll the islands in the Maldives are built entirely of coral, and land area never exceeds 13\nkm2. The maximum elevation is not more than 2-3 meters above sea level, making the country\nvulnerable to sea level rise. The Maldives has a special stake in the debate over global warming\nfrom greenhouse gases and consequent sea level rise. It is expected that introducing renewable\nenergy  technologies  such  as  solar  photovoltaics  (PV)  and  windmills  would  contribute  to\nenvironmental conservation.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n23.\nThe Government identified the national objectives in its development plans: (i) securing\nsustainable improvements in living standards and the quality of life of the population by pursuing\nappropriate  growth  strategies;  (ii)  ensuring  that  regional  and  atoll  development  address\ndisparities  and  access \nincome,  housing  and\nto  natural  resources,  employment  and \ninfrastructure,  and  education  and  health  services;  and  (iii)  ensuring  that  the  benefits  of\ndevelopment are shared in a balanced manner among the population and address the hardship\nand  vulnerability  of  the  dispersed  island  communities.  The  Government  has  found  it  too\nexpensive  to  develop  adequate  infrastructure  on  all  200  inhabited  islands.  Some  of  those\nislands  are  small,  have  high  transportation  costs,  and  often  are  difficult  to  access  during  bad\nweather.  The  Government  has  thus  launched  policies  aimed  at  encouraging  the  population  to\nconsolidate on a smaller number of islands. In this context, the Government selected 97 focus\nislands considering  their  administrative  importance,  population,  and  potential  for  development,\nand  decided  to  concentrate  available  resources  on  these  focus  islands  for  their  accelerated\ndevelopment,  thus  reducing  the  high  costs  of  developing  and  maintaining  the  social  and\nphysical infrastructure for a highly dispersed population. The focus islands include atoll capitals\nthat  are  seen  as  the  fundamental  units  for  delivering  basic  infrastructure  and  associated\nservices,  regional  service  centers  and  regional  urban  growth  centers,  which  are  being\n\n\f7\n\ndeveloped to meet employment needs and to serve the expanding population of the surrounding\ncatchment areas.\n\n24.\nThe Government recognizes that providing reliable and efficient electricity supply in the\nouter islands will contribute to the national development objectives by reducing the disparities in\nservices  among  the  islands  and  the  vulnerability  of  the  outer  island  populations.  The\nGovernment has therefore given high priority to improved electrification in the outer islands, and\nprepared a Sector Policy on Outer Islands Electrification in June 2001. The aim is to establish\nthe  financial  viability  of  the  outer  island  power  supply  utilities  and  place  them  on  a  new  and\nsound footing.\n\n25.\n  The  sector  policy  stipulates  the  policy  for  cost  recovery,  tariff  settings,  and  financial\nassistance  for  the  costs  of  electricity  supply  in  the  outer  islands.  To  facilitate  upgrading  of  the\npower supply systems in the outer islands, the Government, under this policy, may provide soft\nterm  loans  with  lower  than  commercial  interest  rates,  longer  than  commercial  repayment\nperiods,  and  longer  grace  periods  on  repayments.  The  sector  policy  further  stipulates  that  the\ntariff  structures  and  levels  will  be  determined  based  on  full  cost  recovery  or  at  least  a  cash\nbreakeven  principle.    When  such  tariffs  are  not  affordable  to  consumers  in  an  island  where\nelectricity is supplied by a well-operated power supply utility,9 the Government may inject equity\nthrough cash or capital subsidy. Customs duties for equipment to be imported for electrification\nin the outer islands may be reduced. However, reduced customs duties will not apply to diesel\nfuel, nor will the O&M costs be subsidized.\n\n26.\nThe  Government  has  established  investment  strategies  and  priorities  to  improve\nelectricity  supply  in  the  outer  islands  on  an  affordable  and  sustainable  basis.  Of  the  97  focus\nislands, 75 were identified for improvement of electricity supply over the next five years. These\nidentified islands exclude those where the electricity supply is provided by STELCO, and other\nislands  for  which  the  Government  has  prior  plans  for  development.  As  STELCO  is  capable  of\nself-financing to augment and expand supply in its islands, no foreign aid is considered for those\nislands. The proposed Project will concentrate on the 75 focus islands.\n\n27.\nThe sector policy also highlights the importance of strengthening sector entities including\nimplementing  agencies,  island  power  supply  utilities,  and  the  sector  regulator  to  build  their\ncapacities in long-term development planning and management of power supply systems in the\nouter islands. Following the incorporation of the utility part of the Maldives Electricity Board as\nSTELCO under the Companies Act in 1997, the Government looks to the establishment of legal\nentities  in  the  outer  islands  to  own  and  operate  the  power  supply  systems,  aimed  at\nstrengthening the accountability of the outer island power supply utilities. The Government also\nseeks  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  MEB  to  regulate  the  standards  for  electricity\nsupply  in  the  Maldives,  while  continuing  to  explore  the  possibility  of  making  the  regulator  an\nautonomous body.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nADB  is  by  far  the  main  contributor  to  the  power  sector  extending  four  loans  totaling\n28.\n$24.7  million  and  seven  TAs  totaling  $1.5  million  to  help  meet  the  electricity  requirements  in\nMal\u00e9 and to strengthen the sector institutions. The Third Power System Development Project10\nhas been designed to increase generating capacity in Mal\u00e9 by 12 megawatts (MW), to serve the\n\n                  \n\n9  A  well-operated  power  supply  utility  can  be  defined  by  parameters  such  as  staffing  ratios,  distribution  losses,\n\ngeneration efficiency, and billing and collection efficiency.\n\n10 Loan 1532-MLD(SF), for $7.0 million, approved on 9 September 1997.\n\n\f8\n\nrapidly  growing  electricity  demands  there  and  to  strengthen  management  and  develop  the\nhuman resources of STELCO.  Details of ADB\u2019s assistance in the power sector are in Appendix\n2.\n\n29.\nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has helped to provide electricity to\nsome  outer  islands  through  its  three-phase  Atoll  Island  Electrification  Project,  which  started  in\n1993 and was completed in 2000. The total cost of phases 1 and 2 was $10.8 million equivalent\nand  phase  3,  $6.9  million  equivalent.  The  Nordic  Development  Fund  is  also  supporting  the\ndevelopment  of  the  power  sector  by  cofinancing  with  ADB  the  Third  Power  System\nDevelopment Project in the amount of $5.6 million equivalent for construction of two new 6 MW\ndiesel generating units in Mal\u00e9, which are to be commissioned in 2002.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n30.\nTo  date,  ADB  assistance  to  the  Maldives  has  largely  focused  on  infrastructure\ndevelopment  in  the  power  and  port  sectors  in  Mal\u00e9  and,  more  recently,  in  postsecondary\neducation  and  regional  development  through  both  infrastructure  investment  and  institutional\nsupport. In general, the Maldives has made good use of ADB assistance and has demonstrated\nsatisfactory absorptive capacity.  Of the six completed projects, five have been postevaluated.\nAll,  except  the  first  project,11  were  rated  generally  successful.  Compliance  with  the  loan\ncovenants  on  social  and  environmental  measures  has  been  generally  satisfactory.  ADB\nassistance to the port sector improved the cargo-handling capacity of Mal\u00e9 port and helped to\nreduce  the  bottlenecks  that  delayed  transshipment  of  goods  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the  outer\nislands.  ADB assistance to the power sector helped to satisfy the demand for electricity in Mal\u00e9\nin a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable manner.  ADB assistance in both power and\nport  sectors  contributed  to  improved  financial  management,  operational  efficiency,  economic\ngrowth, and productivity.\n\nAlthough past ADB projects were generally successful, the project experiences indicate\n31.\nthat  most  of  the  line  ministries  continue  to  have  limited  absorptive  capacity  due  to  scarcity  of\nskilled  and  experienced  staff.  Delays  in  project  implementation  occurred  primarily  in  the  initial\nphases of appointing consultants and awarding contracts. To address this matter, it is essential\nto  strengthen  implementation  capacity  and  provide  long-term  training  for  project  staff  in  the\nrelevant  institutions  and  agencies.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  availability  of  consultants\nwith  appropriate  skills,  involvement  of  island  communities  through  adequate  awareness\ncampaigns.  ADB  will  carry  out  close  monitoring  and  supervision.  Direct  beneficiaries  will  be\ninvolved - from decision making to design and construction - to enhance the sense of ownership\nand sustainability of the Project. To avoid the initial delays, the Government has established the\nproject  management  unit,  appointed  the  project  manager  for  the  Project,  and  identified  the\nislands to be considered in the first phase of the Project. ADB has also allowed advance action\nfor recruiting consultants.\n\n32.\nJICA's experience with its Atoll Island Electrification Project (para. 29) was positive. The\nproject improved the quality and reliability of power supply in the selected islands, promoted the\nestablishment of industries such as small-scale garment factories, and improved the quality of\nlife of the people in the islands through, among others, increased studying hours of students at\nnight,  reduced  workload  for  women  owing  to  the  increased  use  of  electrical  appliances,  and\nincreased  use  of  entertainment  equipment.  The  power  supply  systems  built  under  the  project\nwere also evaluated as technically and financially sustainable.\n\n11 Loan 513-MLD(SF): Interisland Transport Project, for $1 million, approved on 18 June 1981. This Project had major\n\n                  \n\ndesign flaws and was rated unsuccessful.\n\n\fE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n9\n\n33.\nThe  overarching  objective  of  ADB's  Medium-Term  Strategic  Framework  is  poverty\nreduction. This objective is supported by specific thematic priorities to guide ADB's operation in\nthe medium term, e.g., supporting sustainable economic growth; developing human resources;\nprotecting  the  environment;  encouraging  private  sector  development;  and  promoting  good\ngovernance,  gender  in  development,  and  regional  cooperation.  Under  this  framework,  ADB's\nlending mix in the Maldives is geared toward balanced economic growth by directly addressing\ninequities and supporting social and economic development in regions outside Mal\u00e9.\n\nfacilities)  and \n\ntoward  support \n\n34.\nADB\u2019s  current  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for  the  Maldives  was  prepared  in\n1995.  It  reoriented  ADB  operations  away  from  improvement  of  physical  infrastructure  in  Mal\u00e9\n(port  and  power \nfor  sustainable  regional  development,\nenvironmental protection, human development, and strengthening of public sector management.\nA high priority for ADB assistance is regional development across atolls to help achieve a more\nequitable  and  cost-effective  distribution  of  basic  economic  and  social  services  and  to  help  ease\nthe substantial population pressures on Mal\u00e9. In 1999, ADB approved the Regional Development\nProject,12 its first project focusing on institutional support and basic infrastructure and services to\nestablish  regional  growth  centers.  The  proposed  Project  is  the  second  to  be  processed  under\nCOS, which fully supports regional development.\n\n35.\nADB is in the process of developing a new country strategy for the Maldives with a clear\nfocus  on  poverty  reduction.  The  Maldives  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (July  2001)\nstipulates that ADB will continue to assist in (i) regional development including providing basic\ninfrastructure  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector\ndevelopment, and (iii) developing an information and communication network in the atolls.\n\n36.\nThe previous ADB loans and TAs in the power sector provided assistance to meet the\nelectricity  demands  in  Mal\u00e9  and  to  develop  STELCO.  Consequently,  electricity  supply  in  Mal\u00e9\nhas  been  substantially  improved  and  STELCO  has  become  a  profitable  and  financially  sound\nentity.  Future  development  of  the  electricity  supply  in  Mal\u00e9  will  no  longer  require  foreign  aid.\nConsistent  with  the  Government's  national  development  plans and  ADB's  poverty  reduction\nstrategy, ADB has shifted its sector focus to rural electrification in the outer islands, which have\nlagged in development.\n\n37.\nOne  of  ADB's  sector  strategies  is  to  develop  and  strengthen  the  sector  institutions.\nADB's earlier projects have assisted STELCO with strengthening management and developing\nhuman  resources. While STELCO has made significant progress in institutional development,\nelectricity utilities running power supply systems in the outer islands and the sector regulator still\nneed  much  improvement.  The  proposed  Project  will  aim  to  build  the  capacity  of  the  sector\nregulator as well as the outer islands power supply utilities. ADB also recognizes the need for\ndeveloping  environmentally  sustainable  energy  resources  in  the  county  and  will  explore  the\npossibility  of  introducing  renewable  energy  technologies  that  can  contribute  to  environmental\nconservation.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n38.\nADB has assumed a leading role in policy dialogue in the power sector. Policy dialogue\nin the sector began in 1987 when a TA was approved to assist with improving the then Maldives\nElectricity  Board.  Following  the  recommendations  from  the  TA,  incorporating  the  Maldives\nElectricity  Board  was  identified  as  critical  in  promoting  more  efficient  and  independent\n\n12 Loan 1695-MLD(SF): for $8.0 million, approved on 2 September 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f10\n\nmanagement and enabling the board to operate commercially. Subsequently, the Government\nrecognized the need for improved sector efficiency and committed itself to further reform of the\npower sector. ADB continued its policy dialogue on reforming the Maldives Electricity Board and\nbuilding the capacity of sector entities. Pursuant to the detailed description of the power sector\nreform included in the final report of a follow-up TA, the Government converted the utility part of\nthe  Maldives  Electricity  Board  into  STELCO  in  1997  under  the  new  Companies  Act,  and\nconverted  the  regulatory  part  into  MEB  in  January  1998.  Overall,  ADB's  policy  dialogue  has\nhelped  to  meet  the  demand  for  electricity  in  Mal\u00e9  in  a  cost-effective  and  environmentally\nacceptable  manner,  and  the  impact  of  its  assistance  on  policy  and  institutional  changes  has\nbeen  significant,  contributing  to  improved  financial  management,  operational  efficiency,\neconomic growth, and productivity of the sector institutions.\n\n39.\nSubsequent to the cited achievements in the power sector, the principal areas of policy\ndialogue  between  ADB  and  the  Government  have  focused  on  (i)  equitable  development  to\nreduce poverty; (ii) providing the outer island populations with electricity supply in a sustainable\nand  affordable  manner;  (iii)  promoting  private  sector  participation  and  cost  recovery;  and  (iv)\npromoting  use  of  renewable  sources  of  energy  to  protect  the  environment.  All  these  will  be\npursued  in  the  context  of  regional  development,  to  ensure  a  more  equitable  distribution  of\neconomic  benefits  through  broad-based  growth  and  subsequently  to  reduce  the  population\npressures on Mal\u00e9. The cost recovery policy is based on beneficiaries' paying for the costs. The\npolicy on private sector participation is to encourage the island community-based organizations\nto own and manage island power supply utilities.\n\n40.\nRegulating  and  supervising  public  utilities  such  as  electricity  and  water  supply  are  of\nparticular  concern  as  utility  services  spread  beyond  Mal\u00e9  to  the  less  accessible  outer  islands,\nand all sector regulators are constrained by limited human and financial resources. The sector\nregulators  continue  to  have  weak  internal  management  systems  and  limited  ability  to  regulate\npublic  utilities  appropriately.  While  ADB  will  work  with  the  Government  for  immediate\nstrengthening  of  the  existing  regulatory  framework  for  the  power  sector  to  effectively  regulate\nthe electricity service providers, it will also assist the Government to study the establishment of\na single apex body that can regulate and supervise multiple public utilities.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n41. \nPower  supply  systems  in  most  of  the  outer  islands  have  been  developed  on  an  adhoc\nbasis and unprofessionally by the island communities. The results are an unreliable supply, low\nefficiency, poor quality, and high costs. Although most of the island populations are connected\nto some form of electricity, the poor and unreliable electricity supply has constrained economic\nand  social  development  in  the  outer  islands.  This  has  led  to  considerable  disparities  between\nMal\u00e9 and the outer islands. The provision of reliable, affordable, and efficient electricity supply in\nthe outer islands is essential to reduce the disparities among the islands, and to reduce poverty\nand improve the quality of life of the outer island populations.\n\n42.\nThe  project  preparatory  TA  report  concluded  that  diesel  generation  is  the  least-cost\noption  in  the  outer  islands  and  that  other  renewable  energy  technologies  aside  from  solar  PV\npower and windmill power are not promising in the medium term.  The TA report also studied in\nsubstantial detail the feasibility of generating electricity using renewable energy from wind and\nPV, which would be integrated with diesel generation. However, generating power using these\nforms  of  renewable  energy  would  be  very  costly,  with  average  costs  of  more  than  $1.00  per\nkWh  for  delivered  electricity.    For  this  Project,  a  grant  financing  from  the  Global  Environment\n\n\f11\n\nFacility (GEF) was sought for the hybrid pilot renewable energy projects comprising PV-diesel\nand wind-diesel as well as a set of barrier removal initiatives that are expected to enhance the\nadoption  of  renewable  energy  technologies.    This  project  concept  was  accepted  by  GEF  and\nentered in the GEF pipeline for grant financing.  There was also some concern that perhaps the\nproject  costs  and  benefit  estimates  of  the  renewable  energy  technologies  included  in  the  TA\nmight have been too conservative. Therefore, the findings of the TA were reviewed by another\nset  of  independent  staff  consultants  engaged  for  fact-finding  and  appraisal.  It  was  confirmed\nthat electricity generation in the outer islands through PV and windmill is not economically viable\nat  present,  even  when  such  projects  are  replicated  in  large  numbers.    The  cost  of  such\nrenewable energy would be about 10 times the alternative fuel cost of electricity generation from\ndiesel  generator  sets.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  this  remains  uneconomic  even  if  fuel  oil\nprices  increase  more  than  5  times,  or  if  the  carbon  emission  \u201ctax\u201d  or  indirect  cost  increases\nmore  than  100  times.  Although  generating  electricity  with  windmill  has  proved  feasible  and\naffordable in some countries in the world, it will be very costly due to the small size of the wind\nturbine  units  required  and  the  relatively  low  average  wind  speeds  in  the  Maldives.  Solar  PV\nelectricity supply is generally feasible only for very small loads or for isolated users who have no\naccess  to  a  local  community-based  power  supply,  but  it  is  still  much  more  costly  than  diesel\npower supply in the outer islands. This evaluation and sensitivity analysis are described in more\ndetail  in  Appendix  3.  Based  on  the  above  analysis,  all  generation  capacity  to  be  added  under\nthe Project will be diesel-based.\n\n43.\nPoor  power  system  management  skills,  coupled  with  lack  of  specialized  utility  financial\nmanagement and professional engineering skills for planning, design, construction supervision,\nand O&M have been a major obstacle to developing sustainable power supply systems in the\nouter islands.  The demand for electricity in the outer islands has rapidly increased due to strong\neconomic  growth.  This  trend,  which  is  expected  to  continue  in  the  future,  will  place  a  major\nburden  on  the  human  resources  of  the  power  sector,  particularly  in  the  outer  islands.  The\nproposed Project aims to build the capacity of power supply utilities in the outer islands, which is\nessential  to  maintain  the  sustainability  of  their  power  supply  systems.  Building  the  capacity  of\nother  agencies  involved  under  the  Project  and  the  electricity  sector  regulator  is  equally\nimportant for successful completion of the Project and proper regulation of power supply utilities.\n\nThe  Project  also  seeks  to  bring  a  new  dimension  into  the  power  sector  in  the  outer\n44.\nislands  by  encouraging  community  accountability  for  and  ownership  of  power  supply  systems,\nwhile  maintaining  participation  of  the  island  communities.  The  Project  will  support  the\nGovernment's efforts by providing legal advisory services to prepare new legislation for creating\nlegal electricity cooperatives, or amend the existing laws to provide for recognition of IDCs and\nother island community groups as legal entities.\n\n45.\nA  sector  loan  is  proposed  for  the  Project.  ADB  has  reviewed  the  power  sector  in  the\nouter  islands  and  is  satisfied  that  the  Government's  sector  policies  are  generally  sound  and\nmerit support. The Executing Agency and the Implementing Agency are suitable agencies for a\nsector loan and the relevant criteria for providing a sector loan are met.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n46.\nThe  long-term  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  achieve  balanced  economic  growth  and\nequitable  regional  development  and  thereby  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability  of  the  selected\nouter  islands  and  also  reduce  the  significant  population  pressures  on  Mal\u00e9.  The  immediate\npurposes of the Project are to (i) improve electricity supply in the outer islands on a sustainable\nand  affordable  basis;  (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  sector  entities;  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  legal\nframework  for  the  devolution  of  responsibilities  to  the  outer  island  electricity  suppliers  and  the\nrecognition of community groups, such as IDCs, NGOs, clubs, and associations.\n\n\f12\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n47.\n\nThe Project comprises the following components:\n\n1.\n\nPart A: Expand and Augment Power Supply to the Outer Islands\n\nExpand  and  augment  power  supply  systems  in  about  40  non-STELCO\nfocus islands13 to serve about 8,500 households with 45,000 people.\n\nProvide  implementation  assistance  for  engineering  and  project  design,\npreparation  of  subproject  appraisal  reports,  procurement  and  contract\nawarding,  and  construction  supervision  as  well  as  build  the  capacity  of\nrelated government ministries for project management.\n\n2.\n\nPart B: Build the Capacity of Sector Institutions\n\nStrengthen  MEB  by  assisting  it  to  establish  a  clear  mission  statement,\ndevelop  its  professional  capacity,  establish  safety  and  quality  standards\nof  electricity  supply,  set  operational  procedures  for  enforcing  safety  and\nquality  standards,  and  develop  comprehensive  pricing  principles  for\nsetting tariffs.\n\nStrengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National\nDevelopment  (MPND)  to  carry  out  benefit  and  poverty  monitoring  and\nevaluation (BPME).\n\n3.\n\nPart C: Strengthen the Legal Framework for Island Power Supply Utilities\n\nProvide legal advisory services to the Attorney General's Office (AGO) for\ndeveloping  a  legal  framework  for  island  power  supply  utilities  and/or  for\ncooperatives, and/or for recognition of community groups.\n\nTrain  concerned  agencies  in  cooperatives  and  their  operation  and\nmanagement, and cooperatives law.\n\n48.\nIn addition, ADB will continue to explore the possibility of a component to be funded by\nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) to enhance the poverty reduction impacts of the\nProject.  In  October  2001,  the  Government  submitted  a  proposal  to  ADB  for  the  JFPR\ncomponent, describing the type of support the Government needs, the estimated costs of such\nsupport, and how the Government intends to implement the JFPR component. ADB is reviewing\nthis  proposal  and  will  process  the  JFPR  component  under  a  schedule  separate  from  that  of\nother components of the Project, while maintaining conceptual linkage with the Project.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $10.6  million  equivalent,  of  which  $7.6  million\n49.\n(71.7 percent) is the foreign exchange cost and $3.0 million equivalent (28.3 percent) the local\ncurrency  cost.  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  2001  price  levels  for  base  costs  and\ncontingencies,  and  a  duty  rate  of  12.5  percent  on  imported  equipment.  Cost  of  land  is  not\nincluded in the cost estimates as there is no private land ownership in the country and all lands\n\n                  \n\n13 No STELCO islands will be included under the Project since STELCO is deemed capable of independent funding\n\nto expand and augment its own power supply systems.\n\n\fbelong to the Government. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and are presented in\ndetail in Appendix 4.\n\n13\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($\u2019000)\n\nComponent\n\nPart A\nPart B\nPart C\nInterest During Construction\nTaxes and Duties\n\nTotal\n\nD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nForeign\nCurrency\nCost\n7,018\n372\n46\n164\n0\n7,600\n\nLocal\nCurrency\nCost\n1,528\n95\n23\n566\n788\n3,000\n\nTotal\nCost\n8,546\n467\n69\n730\n788\n10,600\n\n50.\nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 2. ADB will finance about 76 percent of the\ntotal cost of the Project including all the foreign exchange costs and a minor portion of the local\ncurrency  costs.  The  Government  will  finance  the  rest  of  the  local  current  costs  and  provide\npublic land if required for expanding or building powerhouses.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\nAsian Development Bank\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n7.6\n0.0\n7.6\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n0.4\n2.6\n3.0\n\nTotal\nCost\n8.0\n2.6\n10.6\n\nPercentage\nShare\n75.5\n24.5\n100.0\n\nIt is proposed that ADB extend a loan of $8.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds\n51.\nresources.  The  loan  maturity  will  be  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  An  annual\ninterest  rate  is  1  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum  thereafter.  The\nBorrower,  the  Republic  of  Maldives,  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  cost  of  each\nisland's  power  supply  system,  excluding  the  costs  of  consulting  services,  will  be  treated  as  a\nsubsidiary  loan  from  the  Borrower  to  the  relevant  island.  Re-lending  terms  comprise  an\namortization period of 12 years including a 4-year grace period and an interest rate of 8 percent\nper annum.14  Islands may choose to borrow with a shorter grace period or shorter amortization\nperiod.  The Bank of Maldives will be responsible for collecting the loan repayments, with a fixed\nadministrative  fee  of  Rf100  per  loan  per  month,  pursuant  to  a  separate  agreement  between\nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT)  and  the  Bank  of  Maldives.  Among  other  things,  the\nsubsidiary  loan  documentation  will  provide  that  the  Borrower  will  have  a  lien  on  the  power\nsupply systems until the full payment of the subsidiary loans to the Borrower.\n\n                  \n\n14 Re-lending terms are determined by considering the current practice, economic lifetime of the equipment, risks and\n\ncosts of the loan to the Government, and affordability to the subborrowers.\n\n\f14\n\n52.\nAt  present,  many  outer  island  power  supply  utilities  are  not  legal  entities.  The\nGovernment  has  assured  that  within  nine  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  it  will  submit  the\nproposed  legislation  addressing  the  formation  of  legal  outer  island  power  supply  utilities\n(cooperatives law or amendment of existing laws) to its Parliament for approval. In the event of\ndelayed  passage  of  the  law,  and  given  that  there  is  no  history  of  outer  island  communities\ndefaulting  on  their  financial  obligations,  the  Government  will  continue  with  its  current  lending\npractice.  However,  ADB  will  require  that  the  Government  sign  agreements  with  island\nrepresentatives for repayment of the subsidiary loans. Upon the passage of the proposed law,\nthe  Government  will  require  legal  power  supply  utilities  (cooperatives  or  other  form)  to  be\nestablished,  and  for  the  agreements  to  be  transferred  to  the  established  legal  power  supply\nutilities as soon as practicable.\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Execution\n\nMOFT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  and  will  be  responsible  for\n53.\noverall  coordination  of  the  Project,  including  approval  of  all  disbursements.  MAA  will  be  the\nImplementing  Agency  (IA).  Day-to-day  implementation  will  be  carried  out  by  the  project\nmanagement unit (PMU), which has been established under MAA and headed by the full-time\nproject  manager,  who  has  been  appointed.  MEB  will  supervise  the  activities  for  strengthening\nMEB, and MPND the activities for the institutional strengthening of BPME. AGO will supervise\nthe legal advisory services under the Project for strengthening the legal framework and will be\nresponsible  for  preparing  legislation  to  establish  legal  island  power  supply  utilities,  and/or\nrecognize  island  community  groups  as  legal  entities.  MAA,  MPND,  and  MOFT  will  be  jointly\nresponsible for submitting the draft legislation to the Parliament for its approval.\n\n54.\nA project coordinating committee (PCC), chaired by MAA, will guide the PMU and assist\nwith interagency coordination of activities. The members of the PCC are senior officials and staff\nmembers representing MOFT, MAA, MPND, MEB, AGO, and STELCO. The Ministry of Home\nAffairs,  Housing  and  Environment  (MHHE)  is  also  part  of  the  PCC.  Appendix  5  gives  the\norganization chart of project implementation and management.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n55.\nThe  implementation  schedule  of  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  6.  Advance  action  for\nrecruiting  the  consultants  started  in  October  2001  and  the  Project  will  be  completed  by  June\n2005.\n\n3.\n\nPlanning and Appraising Subprojects under Part A\n\n56. With the help of the implementation consultants, MAA will prepare subproject appraisal\nreports for each of the selected islands in three batches of about 12-15 islands each. The plan\nfor each subproject will be made in close consultation with the island communities, and must be\nendorsed  by  the  representatives  of  the  island  and  approved  by  the  Government,  before  it  is\nsubmitted  to  ADB  in  an  acceptable  format  for  review  and  approval.  In  selecting  the  islands,\nspecial  consideration  will  be  given  to  islands  with  a  high  incidence  of  income  poverty  and\nvulnerability.  MAA  will  be  required  to  secure  ADB's  approval  before  implementing  the\nsubprojects. Each subproject appraisal report will contain full details including (i) recommended\nsubproject  development  plan;  (ii)  design  (at  tender  level)  of  the  subproject  and  detailed  cost\nestimates;  (iii)  implementation  schedule  and  implementation  arrangements;  (iv)  economic  and\nfinancial  analyses;  (v)  proposed \ntariffs  and  assessment  of  affordability;  (vi)\nenvironmental examination; (vii) socioeconomic survey results including population, household\n\nlevel  of \n\n\f15\n\nincome  distribution,  and  electricity  uses;  and  (viii)  proposed  structure  of  the  outer  island\nelectricity suppliers, and relevant supporting documentation. Subprojects submitted to ADB for\napproval  must  have  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  a  minimum  10  percent.  In\ncase land allocation is required for subproject construction, the subproject appraisal report must\ninclude confirmation that no resettlement of people or impact on livelihood is involved as well as\nproof of approval from appropriate authorities for the allocation of government-owned land. The\nprocedures for subproject planning, selection, appraisal, and approval are described in detail in\nAppendix 7.\n\n4.\n\nProcurement\n\nGoods and services financed by the Project will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines\n57.\nfor  Procurement.  Bid  specifications  will  be  prepared  in  a  manner  to  ensure  maximum\ncompetition under international competitive bidding and maximum use of local labor. To ensure\neconomy of scale and maximum efficiency, all contract packages will be awarded on a turnkey\nbasis  for  the  three  batches  of  subprojects.  These  contracts,  which  will  be  awarded  and\nadministered  by  MAA  on  behalf  of  the  participating  island  communities,  will  include  design,\nconstruction,  testing,  and  commissioning  of  the  power  supply  systems.  A  list  of  the  contract\npackages with their cost estimates is attached as Appendix 8.\n\n5.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n58.\nAbout  30  person-months  of  international  and  93  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\nservices  required  for  the  Project  will  be  provided  under  two  separate  consulting  services\ncontracts. An international consulting firm, which will be encouraged to associate with domestic\nconsultants,  will  be  recruited  to  assist  with  parts  A  and  B  of  the  Project,  and  a  domestic  legal\nconsultant will be recruited to assist with part C.  MAA, in coordination with MEB and MPND, will\nrecruit the international consulting firm for parts A and B; AGO, in consultation with MOFT, will\nengage the domestic legal consultant for part C. All consultants will be recruited and engaged in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.   AGO will provide ADB with a shortlist\nof  consultants  for  its  review,  and  will  follow  the  Government's  recruitment  procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n\n59.\nConsulting  services  for  parts  A  and  B  are  needed  to  (i)  assist  MAA  with  detailed\nengineering  and  project  design;  preparing  subproject  appraisal  reports;  preparing  bid\ndocuments,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract  awards;  supervising  installation,  testing,  and\ncommissioning; training island power supply utilities in O&M of electricity supply systems; and\nthe  building  capacity  of  related  government  agencies  for  project  management;  (ii)  strengthen\nMEB  by  establishing  a  clear  mission  statement;  developing  its  professional  capacity;\nestablishing safety and quality standards of electricity supply; setting operational procedures for\nenforcing safety and quality; and developing comprehensive pricing principles for setting tariffs;\nand (iii) assist MPND in BPME.  Consulting services for part C are needed to assist AGO with\npreparing legislation to develop an appropriate legal framework to support the establishment of\nlegally  recognized  power  supply  utilities  in  the  outer  islands.  The  terms  of  reference  for\nconsulting services are given in Appendix 9.\n\n6.\n\nAdvance Action on Recruitment of Consultants\n\n60.\nThe timely recruitment of consultants is critical to the success of the Project. To minimize\nfront-end delays in implementation, the Government requested ADB to approve advance action\nfor recruitment of consultants. The Government has been allowed to initiate advance action for\nrecruiting  consultants  to  be  financed  by  ADB  under  the  Project.  The  Government  was  also\n\n\f16\n\nadvised  that  approval  of  such  advance  recruitment  action  will  not  in  any  way  commit  ADB  to\napprove the Project or to retroactively finance any costs incurred by the Government.\n\n7.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\nMOFT, as the EA, will be responsible for vetting and coordinating all disbursements for\n61.\nthe  Project.  Disbursements will  be for consulting services as well as supply and installation of\nelectricity  supply  equipment  and  accessories.    Therefore,  ADB's  commitment  procedures  and\ndirect payment procedures will be used.\n\n8.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n62.   MOFT  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  timely  submission  of  reports  to  ADB,  and  will\nensure that each of the agencies involved meets the requirements.  MAA, in coordination with\nMEB, MPND, and AGO, will prepare regular progress reports for the Project and submit them to\nADB on a quarterly basis.  The reports, which will be submitted within 30 days from the end of\neach quarter, will include a description of physical progress, a summary of project receipts and\nexpenditures  during  the  period,  year  to  date,  and  total  to  date.  A  detailed  list  indicating  the\namount  received  by  each  island  power  supply  utility  during  the  reporting  period  must  be\nattached to the progress reports.\n\n63.\nMAA will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project. The project statement\nof receipts and expenditures will be audited annually by the Auditor General of the Government.\nMAA will submit to ADB copies of the audited accounts within nine months after the end of the\nfiscal  year  to  which  they  relate.  A  project  completion  report  covering  the  entire  project  will  be\nsubmitted by MAA to ADB within three months after project completion. MPND will submit a final\nBPME  report  to  ADB  within  three  months  of  project  completion.  MEB,  MPND,  and  AGO  will\nprovide MAA with their respective reports when so requested.\n\n64.\nEach  island  power  supply  utility  covered  under  the  Project  will  maintain  satisfactory\naccounting records that can generate regular management reports. Each utility will also prepare\nannual  statements  of  income  and  expenditure,  and  assets  and  liabilities,  and  submit  them  to\nMAA within six months after the end of each fiscal year. MAA will review the annual statements\nand tabulate them for submission to ADB within nine months after the end of each fiscal year,\ntogether  with  a  summary  report  highlighting  the  major  achievements  or  failures  of  the  island\npower  supply  utilities  in  the  fiscal  year.  MAA  will  also  submit  to  ADB  annual  reports  on\nenvironmental requirements within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, including (i) a copy\nof environmental and safety permits, licenses, or clearances; (ii) compliance with environmental\nrequirements;  (iii)  violations,  if  any,  of  environmental  requirements;  and  (iv)  certifications  of\napproval for corrective actions, or approved plans of correction, if any.\n\nF.\n\nAgencies Involved\n\n1.\n\nMinistry of Atolls Administration\n\n65.\nMAA,  the  IA  for  the  Project,  is  responsible  for  supervising  the  atoll  and  island  offices,\nhandling  all  developmental  activities,  and  upholding  law  and  order  in  the  outer  islands.  Its\nfunctions include the following:\n\n(i)\n\nProvide  instructions  to  the  atoll  and  island  chiefs,  administer  all  matters\nrelating to Government land in the atolls, deal with any matters relating to\nthe atolls, and work toward economic and social development of atolls;\n\n\f(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\n17\n\nOrganize,  manage,  and  implement  projects  for  planning  and  developing\nislands and regions selected for relevant development plans;\n\nOrganize, facilitate, and coordinate the activities and services required for\nthe growth of islands and regions selected for development; and\n\n(iv)\n\nAllocate land in the atolls.\n\n66.\nThe  PMU  has  been  established  under  Sector  G  of  MAA,  which  is  responsible  for\nplanning, executing and evaluating projects. At present, it has a staff of 28, a number of whom\nwere  trained  in  project  management.  It  also  has  extensive  project  management  experience  in\nthe  outer  islands,  and  has  specific  experience  in  managing  electrification  projects  utilizing\nSTELCO skills. Although the Project is larger than MAA had previously handled, the presence of\nsuch a professional and experienced project management organization will be of considerable\nadvantage in implementing the Project.\n\n2.\n\nMinistry of Planning and National Development\n\n67.\nMPND compiles information relating to the population and other aspects relevant for the\ndevelopment program and reforms actions required for the drawing up of plans and projects for\nthe  country's  development  including  electrification.  Its  functions  include  (i)  formulating  the\npopulation policy of the country and determining the economic and social facilities and services\nthat the population requires, (ii) determining the industrial and residential zones of the country,\nand (iii) preparing and maintaining updated charts of the islands.\n\n3.\n\nMaldives Electricity Bureau\n\nMEB  is  responsible  for  regulating  the  standards  for  electricity  supply  in  the  Maldives.\n\n68.\nMEB\u2019s work can be summarized as follows:\n\nPrepare engineering standards and regulatory codes and ensure that the\nelectricity service providers comply with the relevant regulations;\n\nIssue  permits  and  licenses  to  potential  electricity  service  providers  and\nestablish principles for tariffs;\n\nInvestigate  complaints  regarding  breaches  of  the  service  agreement\nbetween the customer and the service provider;\n\n(iv)\n\nIssue permits and licenses to electricians;\n\nRegulate the standards of electricians and electrical consultants and the\nstandards  of  generators,  materials,  and  accessories  imported  into  the\ncountry;\n\nCreate  an  awareness  of  the  need  for  reducing  electricity  use  and\nresearch  and  collect  statistical  information  regarding  the  requirements,\nsupply, and consumption of energy in general and electricity in particular;\nand\n\n(vii)\n\nTake  necessary  action  regarding  electricity  supply  services  pursuant  to\nthe Public Utilities Act.\n\n\f4.\n\nAttorney General's Office\n\n18\n\n69.\nAGO was established to give legal advice on matters affecting the Government and to\nact on behalf of the Government in the courts, among others. Under the Project, AGO, with the\nassistance  of  the  domestic  legal  adviser,  will  review  the  best  possible  option  for  the  legal\nestablishment of outer island power supply utilities to meet these objectives: (i) creating in island\ncommunities  a  culture  of  community  ownership  of  essential  services  such  as  electricity;  (ii)\nmaximizing community participation in the design and O&M of their power supply systems; and\n(iii) fostering a culture of financial transparency and accountability. AGO will also draft relevant\nlegislation for the concerned government ministries to submit to the Parliament for approval.\n\n5.\n\nOuter Island Power Supply Utilities\n\na.\n\nGeneral Description\n\n70.\nAt  present,  outer  island  power  supply  utilities  are  STELCO,  IDCs,  NGOs,  and  private\noperators.  Except  in  STELCO  islands,  electricity  consumers  in  each  outer  island  generally\nrange  from  50  to  300  with  typical  installed  generation  capacities  of  50  kW-150  kW  on  each\nisland. Most outer islands have no proper records or bookkeeping mainly due to lack of skills in\noperation  and  management  of  power  supply  systems.  In  most  cases,  they  have  very  simple\nrecording  methods  for  sales  of  and  revenue  from  electricity,  but  there  is  little  record  on\ngeneration  and  operating  costs.  Furthermore,  costs  incurred  in  generating  electricity  are\nsometimes part of the overall budget of the island communities. Therefore, it is often difficult to\ndetermine the accurate cost of electricity supply in these islands. The Project will give training in\nbookkeeping  and  accounting  skills  to  enable  the  islands  to  have  basic  skills  in  operation  and\nfinancial management of the power supply systems.\n\nb.\n\nFinancial Projections and Projected Tariffs\n\n71.\nSince  it  was  impractical  to  survey  all  the  islands  that  will  participate  in  the  Project,  a\nrepresentative  sample  of  eight  islands15  was  selected  for  the  purpose  of  evaluation.  As  these\nislands had no proper past records, proforma financial projections up to 2010 were prepared for\nthe power supply utilities on the islands to see how the utilities would perform during and after\nthe  Project.  Of  the  eight  islands  reviewed,  Naalaafushi  and  Veyvah  were  considered  not\nappropriate  for  financing  under  the  Project  at  this  time  since  Naalaafushi  has  just  installed  a\nnew generating set and Veyvah is too small to economically justify the expansion of the power\nsupply system to a higher standard. Therefore, the financial projections are for the six remaining\nislands.  Major  assumptions  underlying \nfinancial\nperformance of each of the six islands are given in Appendix 10.\n\nfinancial  projections  and  detailed \n\nthe \n\nThe  current  electricity  supply  in  the  outer  islands  is  unreliable,  and  losses  from  both\n72.\ngenerators  and  distribution  systems  are  high.  As  a  result,  the  demand  for  electricity  has  been\nsuppressed, as consumers are not able to use their appliances as they wish. At present, many\nof the electricity providers in these islands are having financial difficulties despite the high tariffs\nof  Rf3.5-Rf6.0  ($0.27-$0.47)  per  kWh.  This  compares  with  STELCO\u2019s  general  tariff  levels  of\nRf2.0-Rf4.0 ($0.16-$0.31) per kWh  in Mal\u00e9 and Rf2.5-Rf4.0 ($0.20-$0.31) per kWh  in its outer\nislands operation. Small systems need to charge high tariffs because small groups of customers\ncannot  meet  the  costs  of  capital-intensive  equipment.  Due  to  high  fuel  costs,  in  many  outer\nislands,  the  current  tariffs  are  sufficient  to  cover  only  operating  costs,  but  not  capital\nreplacement  or  financing  costs.    With  the  proposed  Project,  there  will  be  significant\nimprovements  in  quality  and  reliability  of  electricity  supply.  Further,  there  will  be  sufficient\n\n15 Neykurendhoo, Nolhivaramu, Vaikaradhoo, Funadhoo, Mulah, Muli, Naalaafushi, and Veyvah.\n\n                  \n\n\f19\n\ncapacities to service the communities in the outer islands. The reduced distribution losses and\nenhanced efficiencies will reduce the operating costs and allow for some capital replacement.\n\n73.\nGiven  that  each  of  the  outer  islands  is  responsible  for  its  own  cost  and  profitability,  all\nare  required  to  set  their  own  tariffs  based  on  cash  breakeven  principle  at  the  minimum.\nCompared with the current tariffs, the projected tariffs with the proposed Project will be reduced\nin  real  terms  in  most  islands.    Table  3  shows  the  current  and  projected  tariffs  in  each  of  the\nrepresentative sample outer islands.\n\nTable 3: Current and Projected Tariffs for the Six Sample Islands\n\nIsland\n\nCurrent Tariff a\n(Rf/kWh)\n\nProjected\nTariff for 2002\n(Rf/kWh)\n5.00\n4.00\n4.00\n4.50\n4.00\n3.50\n\nProjected\nTariff for\n2006(Rf/kWh)\n6.40\n4.50\n4.25\n5.00\n4.50\n4.25\n\nNeykurendhoo\n5.00\nVaikaradhoo\n4.00\nFunadhoo\n4.00\nNolhivaramu\n6.00\nMulic\n4.00\nMulahd\n3.50\na  Average tariffs in early 2001.\nb  Adjusted to price level for 2001.\nc  Rf2.5/kWh for the first 100 kWh consumed and Rf4.0/kWh afterwards.\nd  Mulah recently reduced the tariff to Rf3.5/kWh from Rf4.0/kWh.\n\nReal Tariff for\n2006 b\n(Rf/kWh)\n5.01\n3.53\n3.33\n3.92\n3.53\n3.33\n\nChange\n(percent)\n+0.2\n-11.8\n-16.8\n-34.7\n-11.8\n-4.9\n\nAs the table shows, with the cash breakeven principle, most islands will have to maintain\n74.\ntheir tariffs for 2002 at present level, while Nolhivaramu can reduce the current tariff. In 2006,\nhowever,  when  the  Project  is  fully  completed  and  loan  principal  repayment  starts,  tariffs  are\nexpected to increase gradually in current terms except in Nolhivaramu where the current tariff\nmay  be  reduced.  In  real  terms,  however,  the  projected  tariffs  in  2006  will  be  lower  than  the\ncurrent tariff level in most islands. The projected tariffs may seem high compared with electricity\ntariffs in neighboring countries; however, they are still considered affordable in the outer islands.\nThe survey conducted under the project preparatory TA revealed that the level of expenditure\non  electricity  for  average  income  households  ranges  from  1.3  to  5.7  percent  of  their  monthly\nincome. The poor, which generally consumes less than 10 kWh per month, spend an average of\n3-6  percent  of  their  monthly  income  for  electricity.  These  percentages  are  comparable  with\nthose in other countries in the region.\n\n75.\nThe  financial  projections  show  that  the  financial  situation  in  all  islands  will  improve,  as\nthe proposed Project will reduce the high system losses and increase efficiency and thus result\nin increased profitability from higher sales volume and lower operating costs. With the projected\ntariffs,  each  island  will  be  able  to  generate  sufficient  cash  to  cover  its  operating  costs  and  to\nservice  its  debts  (interest  and  loan  repayments).  In  later  years,  when  electricity  demand  is\nhigher and they can achieve some economies of scale, the islands could consider reducing their\ntariffs accordingly.\n\n76.\nGiven the need  for  these  islands to generate sufficient cash during their early years of\noperation, it was considered that they would be given a 4-year grace period to repay the loan\nprincipal, for a total repayment period of 12 years. The 12-year repayment period is consistent\nwith  the  average  operating  life  of  the  assets  (i.e.,  7  years  for  generators  and  20  years  for\ndistribution systems). At present, some islands have received loans from the Bank of Maldives\nat 12 percent interest per annum (4 percent of which is subsidized by MAA), with only a 5-year\nrepayment period and a 6-month grace period.\n\n\f20\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental\n\n77.\nThe Project is classified as environment category B. An initial environmental examination\n(IEE) was conducted for eight representative sample islands under the project preparatory TA.\nThe  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  is  given  in  Appendix  11.  The  SIEE  indicates  that  no  significant\nadverse  environmental  impacts  are  associated  with  the  Project,  during  either  construction  or\noperation. The Project will have a positive impact on the environment as the efficiency of diesel\nengines will be improved, and losses reduced; thus, the Project will lessen carbon and nitrous\noxide  emissions.  Further,  the  Project  will  fund  bulk  tanks,  oil-handling  facilities,  fire-fighting\nequipment, and improved dispersal of exhaust gases and noise reduction to improve the safety\nand  environmental  standards  of  the  power  supply  systems.    The  Project  will  also  finance  the\nconstruction  of  new  powerhouses  for  some  islands,  with  better  locations  away  from  village\ncenters, and better noise insulation than in the existing buildings. During project implementation,\nan IEE will be prepared for each subproject for approval of MHHE.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Measures\n\n78.\nA poverty dimension and social assessment (Appendix 12) was carried out as part of the\nproject preparatory TA and fact-finding.  Participatory consultations and a socioeconomic survey\nwere  conducted  with  the  intended  beneficiaries  and  key  relevant  stakeholders,  such  as\nGovernment  agencies,  NGOs,  IDCs,  and  island  women\u2019s  committees  (IWCs),  and  community\nrepresentatives. The Project has been designed such that it is responsive to the communities'\nneeds,  will  function  on  a  sustainable  basis,  and  will  have  no  adverse  social  impacts.  Social\nmeasures  incorporated  into  the  Project  are  designed  to  ensure  that  the  project  benefits  are\nshared  in  a  balanced  manner  among  the  population,  and  that  the  Project  addresses  equity\nconcerns by improving the standards of living, reducing the vulnerability of the populations in the\nouter islands, and ensuring that the electricity supply is affordable to the poor. In addition, the\nJFPR component will strengthen the poverty reduction impacts of the Project.\n\n79.\nThe  Project  involves  no  resettlement  and,  if  land  is  required,  the  Government  will\nallocate  lands  that  will  not  involve  resettlement.  Existing  power  station  buildings  will  be  used\nwherever possible. New powerhouses, if any, will be small, and for the most part will not require\nland exceeding 400 m2. There is no private land ownership in the country and all lands belong\nto  the  Government.  The  constitution  and  laws  of  the  country  give  atoll  chiefs  the  authority  to\nallocate land up to 400 m2 for public use. Reflecting the importance ADB places on careful and\neffective  implementation  of  land  acquisition,  the  following  will  be  conditions  for  subproject\napproval: (i) confirmation that no resettlement of people or impact on livelihood is involved, and\n(ii) receipt from appropriate authorities of approval of the allocation of government-owned land.\nThe PMU will have overall responsibility for coordinating the implementation of land allocation.\n\n3.\n\nBenefit and Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation\n\nBPME  is  intended  to  monitor  and  measure  the  social  and  economic  benefits  of  the\n80.\nProject  that  will  permit  postevaluation,  and  to  also  improve  planning  for  future  electrification\nprojects. It is the primary means of determining the extent to which projects address the need\nand  demands  of  the  beneficiaries;  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  project  approach,\npolicies,  procedures;  and  overall  project  impacts.  To  maximize  transparency  and  public\naccountability,  BPME  will  involve  all  key  stakeholders,  including  IDCs,  IWCs,  and  other\nbeneficiaries, in designing and implementing the BPME. The indicators for monitoring, which will\nbe  developed  during  the  initial  stage  of  the  Project  through  participatory  assessment  and\nworkshops at the atoll and nation levels, will include (i) the number of connected consumers in\n\n\f21\n\nvarious  categories  versus  the  number  of  potential  total  consumers  in  those  categories  in  an\nisland; (ii) average consumption rates for consumers in each category; (iii) tariff structures and\nlevels;  (iv)  technical  losses  of  electricity  supply;  (v)  description  of  new  economic  activities\ninduced by the Project and their estimated total value; (vi) estimates of average income levels\nbefore  and  after  the  Project;  (vii)  the  perceived  importance  of  various  types  of  noneconomic\nbenefits  created  by  the  Project,  such  as  improved  quality  of  life  and  leisure  activities,  better\nenvironment  for  reading  and  study,  and  improved  health;  and  (viii)  poverty  status.  Before\nconstruction  in  the  subprojects,  a  baseline  survey  for  social,  economic,  and  poverty\nassessments will be carried out within the subproject area. Twelve islands in four atolls will be\nselected as sample areas in consideration of geographic balance. In addition, four non-Project\nislands in the same atolls will be selected as control areas. Benefits generated from the Project\nwill be measured against the baseline data and the control islands.\n\n4.\n\nCommunity Consultation\n\n81.\nDuring subproject preparation and implementation, there will be close consultations with\ncommunity  representatives  to  ensure  their  agreement  to  the  technical  design,  institutional\narrangements,  and  the  required  financial  undertakings.  Compliance  with  the  regulations  for\nelectricity supply is difficult because outer island populations lack understanding of the need to\ncomply  with  national  regulations.  Proper  regulation  of  the  quality  and  safety  of  power  supply\nsystems in the outer islands may, in the short term, be best achieved by making the outer island\npopulations  (particularly  the  directors  and  operators  of  power  supply  utilities)  understand  the\nneed  to  observe  national  electricity  supply  regulations,  codes,  and  standards.  A  series  of\nawareness  campaigns  will  be  conducted  throughout  the  Project  by  MAA  with  assistance  from\nthe consultants to ensure that the beneficiaries understand the situation.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n1.\n\nProject Basis\n\n82.\nThe Project for electrification of the outer islands will expand power supply systems or, in\nsome  cases,  replace  them  completely  on  about  40  outer  islands  in  the  Maldives.  This  will\nprovide  improved  power  supply  to  about  8,500  households  with  a  total  population  of  about\n45,000  people.  The  Project  also  supports  ADB's  policy  on  private  sector  development  by\nencouraging  the  participation  of  island  communities  and  attempting  to  instill  a  culture  of\naccountability  and  self-governance  in  outer  island  power  supply  utilities.  A  representative\nsample of six islands was selected for the economic evaluation of the Project. The islands were\nsurveyed  in  detail  to  determine  the  condition  of  their  existing  power  supply  systems  and  the\nexpected load growth, and to prepare plans for expansion. The islands that will participate in the\nProject are islands that are selected as focus islands under the Government's development plan\nfor the outer islands, but are not currently served by STELCO.  Typically, these islands will have\npopulations  between  300  and  1,500.  Smaller  islands  are  normally  not  included  under  the\ndevelopment focus program, and larger islands are in most cases already served by STELCO.\nTo participate in the sector loan for the Project, the development of power supply on each island\nmust be economically justified with an EIRR of at least 10 percent.\n\n83.\nThe existing power supply systems on these islands are normally owned and operated\nby the local IDCs, NGOs, or small private companies. Practically all households on each island\nare connected to some form of electricity. Total installed generation capacities are typically 50\nkW to 150 kW at present.  Due to their inefficiency, high losses, and small size, average costs of\n\n\f22\n\nelectricity are high, with average tariffs of about Rf4.00 ($0.31) per kWh.  Most electricity is used\nfor  residential  purposes  -  lighting,  and  operation  of  television  sets,  radios,  fans,  washing\nmachines, and other electrical appliances.  However, electricity is not used for cooking, since it is\nmuch more costly than firewood or kerosene. Government offices and public services, such as\nschools  and  streetlights,  are  also  significant  electricity  users.  On  the  larger  islands,  there  are\nalso commercial consumers.\n\n2.\n\nLeast-Cost Power Supply Plans\n\nThe distribution systems are in poor condition on most islands, with distribution losses of\n84.\n20-30  percent.  Voltage  levels  at  the  ends  of  the  line  are  also  unsatisfactory  during  high  load\nperiods.  The  plans  for  developing  and  expanding  power  supplies  under  the  Project  include\ncompletely  replacing  the  distribution  systems  in  cases  where  they  are  inefficient  and\ninadequate, or upgrading and expanding distribution as required to meet the load growth.  The\nProject will also replace inefficient diesel generating sets, and add new diesel generating sets\nas required to serve the load growth. Diesel-based systems are the most economic option for\nthese small power supply systems.\n\n3.\n\nEconomic and Financial Evaluation\n\nFor the economic analysis, the economic benefits of the Project are divided into two parts.\n85.\nThe  first  is  the  cost  savings  due  to  replacing  inefficient  generating  units  and  distribution  cables\nthat  have  inadequate  capacity.  The  change  will  improve  generation  efficiency,  and  reduce\ndistribution  losses  and  operating  costs  for  existing  levels  of  sales.  The  second  benefit  is  the\nadditional  electricity  sales  arising  from  the  Project  due  to  future  load  growth.  These  additional\nsales  are  valued  in  the  economic  analysis  at  the  average  consumer  willingness  to  pay  for\nelectricity consumption. This average economic value was based on an electricity demand curve\nderived from data for various islands in the Maldives, and is estimated to be about 70-80 percent\nhigher than existing average tariff levels.\n\n86.\nThe  economic  evaluation  of  each  of  the  six  islands  selected  for  project  evaluation  is\ndescribed  in  Appendix  13.  The  overall  Project  has  an  estimated  EIRR  of  19.4 percent  for  the\nbase  case.  However,  the  economic  evaluation  of  benefits  is  conservative,  as  no  attempt  was\nmade to evaluate the benefits of improved reliability and quality of power supply.\n\n87.\nSensitivity analysis indicates that the economic performance of the Project is robust for\nlarge  increases  in  fuel  costs  or  capital  costs.  The  Project  can  tolerate  a  doubling  of  crude  oil\nprices  and  still  remain  economic.  The  project  economics  are  most  sensitive  to  reductions  in\nestimated unit benefits. The Project would become uneconomic if average benefit rates for new\nsales is reduced more than 32 percent, based on a minimum 10 percent EIRR, or if total load\ngrowth is reduced by more than 30 percent.\n\n88.\nThe  financial  evaluation  assumes  that  tariffs  will  be  set  to  achieve  breakeven  cost\nrecovery  (including  operating  costs  plus  debt-service  costs).  Figure  A13.2  in  Appendix  13\nillustrates  the  reductions  in  future  tariff  rates  that  are  feasible  and  expected  on  this  basis  for\neach  island.  Over  a  period  of  time,  average  tariff  levels  on  the  six  islands  will  be  about  13\npercent lower in real terms by 2006.  With such future tariffs, the average financial internal rate\nof  return  (FIRR)  for  the  overall  Project  is  estimated  to  be  3.4  percent,  which  is  more  than  the\nweighted  average  financial  cost  of  capital  of  2.8  percent  (in  real  terms)  for  the  Project.\nTherefore, the FIRR for this Project is satisfactory.\n\n\fB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n23\n\nA  social  assessment  was  conducted  during  project  formulation.  During  the  process,\n89.\ncomprehensive  consultations  with  beneficiaries  and  surveys \nin  several  representative\nsubproject  sites  were  carried  out.  There  is  agreement  in  all  islands  about  the  need  for  an\nimproved  electricity  supply  although  most  populations  in  the  outer  islands  are  connected  to\nsome  form  of  electricity.  A  good  electricity  supply  for  24  hours  a  day  is  a  high  priority  for\nhouseholds  with  less  than  that.  Where  households  already  have  24  hours  supply,  the  level  of\ndesire  for  improvements  is  demonstrated  by  their  stated  willingness  to  spend  more  of  their\nsavings for buying electrical appliances. Further evidence is shown by the considerable effort of\ncommunities  to  improve  their  electricity  supply  systems  through  communal  fund-raising\nactivities. This confirms the strong absorptive capacity of the island communities for the Project.\n\nThe  majority  of  the  electricity  consumers  in  the  outer  islands  consume  an  average  of\n90.\naround 25 kWh per month and consumption in the lowest quartile is 12 kWh per month. Those\nin the lowest quartile are generally able to pay for their level of consumption at around 5 percent\nor  less  of  household  income.  Households  currently  using  less  than  10  kWh  per  month  do  not\nhave the ability to pay higher tariffs and have less resources to generate increased income from\nan improved electricity supply. The major benefit to these households will come from reduced\ntariffs as a result of improved efficiency. Based on the analysis of a representative sample of six\nislands, the overall tariff in real terms is expected to decline by about 13 percent by 2006.\n\n91. With  a  more  reliable  and  adequate  electricity  supply,  outer  island  communities  will\nreceive nonfinancial benefits as well. A reliable electricity supply will allow them to put electric\nlighting in schools or electric refrigerators in community health clinics, or to access electricity for\nlighting  or  for  electrical  appliances  for  household  businesses.  The  Project  is  also  expected  to\nfacilitate  the  development  of  other  basic  infrastructure  such  as  better  health,  education,  and\ninformation communication facilities, and thereby improve access to and productivity in the labor\nmarket. With improved efficiency of the sector and the economy, the indirect effects of improved\naccess to electricity services will also be evident in the increase in total wealth and the release\nof more funds for other activities. The indirect effect will benefit the island populations both as\nmembers of society and as consumers.\n\n92.\nThe  survey  of  the  sample  islands  shows  that  improved  electricity  supply  will  benefit\ngeneral family welfare, particularly of women.  Where there is sufficient disposable income for\nelectrical  appliances,  the  increased  use  of  flatirons  and  washing  machines  will  relieve  the\ndomestic workload of women. A reliable electricity supply will enable more home-based income-\ngenerating  opportunities  such  as  rope  making  in  the  evening.  For  higher  income  households,\nincreased  availability  of  electricity  will  provide  opportunities  for  increased  household  income\nthrough activities such as sewing, production of freezer goods, and computer and fax services.\n\nC.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n93.\nPoverty  in  the  Maldives  is  largely  shown  by  the  regional  disparities  between  Mal\u00e9  and\nthe outer islands. Despite the fact that macroeconomic indicators in recent years have recorded\nmarked improvement in the Maldives, the benefits of growth have not been equitably distributed\nto the populations. Furthermore, the decentralization of economic activities away from Mal\u00e9 has\nbeen  hampered  by  lack  of  basic  infrastructure  and  institutional  capacities  in  the  outer  islands.\nThe Project supports the Government's policy to reduce poverty by improving electricity supply\nin the outer islands, which in turn will help to achieve balanced economic growth and equitable\nregional development.\n\n\f24\n\n94.\nOne  of  the  underlying  objectives  of  the  Project  is  to  give  poor  households  and\ncommunities  in  the  outer  islands  a  reliable  and  adequate  supply  of  electricity.  The  Project  will\nhave  important  and  direct  effects  on  the  poor  through  (i)  easier  establishment  and  increased\nproductivity of businesses that will employ the poor, (ii) creation of employment in infrastructure\nconstruction, (iii) improved health and education and savings in time and effort that will increase\nindividual productivity, and (iv) longer operating life of electrical appliances.\n\n95.\nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  about  8,500  households  with  a  population  of  45,000  in\nabout  40  focus  islands.  Although  income  poverty  exists  everywhere  in  the  country,  certain\nislands have a concentration of the poor.  The VPA report shows that 26 percent of the income\npoor are located on 20 islands, and 8 of the focus islands to be considered under the Project\nare within the group of the 20 poorest islands. The report further indicates that the percentage of\npeople  living  under  the  poverty  line  of  Rf15  per  person  per  day  in  the  focus  islands  is  50\npercent,  which  is  higher  than  the  country  average  of  42  percent,  and  more  than  double  the\npercentage in Mal\u00e9.\n\nA poverty impact ratio (PIR) expressing the proportion of net economic benefits accruing\n96.\nto  the  poor  was  calculated  by  comparing  the  net  economic  benefits  to  the  poor  with  the  net\neconomic benefits to the economy as a whole. The project preparatory TA report indicates that\nthe  GDP  of  the  poor  in  the  focus  islands  is  approximately  11  percent  of  the  total  GDP  of  the\ncountry.    This  implies  that  the  Project  will  have  a  positive  poverty  reduction  impact  when  PIR\nexceeds  11  percent.  The  TA  report  confirms  that  the  Project  will  have  a  significant  positive\npoverty  reduction  impact  since  the  PIR  averages  32  percent  for  the  sample  representative\nislands  as  a  whole,  and  exceeds  11  percent  in  all  islands  that  were  selected  for  project\nevaluation.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\nThe Project is technically simple and straightforward. However, its success depends on\n97.\n(i)  the  ability  of  the  IA  to  implement  the  project;  (ii)  establishment  of  national  codes  and\nstandards for power suppliers and consumers, and enforcement of such codes and standards;\n(iii)  the  Government's  strong  will  for  enacting  new  legislation  or  amending  existing  laws  to\nprovide for the establishment of legal power supply utilities on the outer islands, or recognition\nof  the  island  community  groups  as  legal  entities;  (iv)  willingness  of  stakeholders  to  borrow\nmoney from the Government to establish an upgraded power supply system; (v) availability of\nskilled  human  resources  for  proper  maintenance  and  management  of  the  power  supply\nsystems; and (vi) appropriate  tariff levels to ensure the financial viability of outer island power\nsupply  utilities.    As  for  the  last  risk,  the  project  FIRR  and  EIRR  for  the  representative  islands\nwere tested for these sensitivities and found to be robust. Additionally, to mitigate the first risk,\nthe  IA  will  be  strengthened  by  consulting  services.  To  mitigate  the  second  risk,  in  addition  to\nconsulting services for establishing national codes and standards, covenants were agreed upon\nto  ensure  proper  regulation  and  enforcement  of  the  quality  and  safety  standards  of  electricity\nsupply.  With  respect  to  the  third  risk,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  prepare  and  submit  new\nlegislation  to  Parliament  for  approval  within  nine  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  which  is\ncovenanted  in  the  legal  documents.  To  mitigate  the  fourth  risk,  the  Government  agreed  to  a\ncovenant on conducting awareness campaigns and training workshops for project beneficiaries\nand island communities in addition to providing soft term loans.

This design is required to provide reliability, since wind is often very light or\neven absent, and the sun is only available during daylight hours.  This hybrid design is also more\neconomic  than  a  power  supply  system  based  entirely  on  renewable  energy  sources  with  large\nbattery  storage  capacity.  Substantial  experience  with  these  renewable  energy  technologies  has\nbeen accumulated over the years, including experience on small islands in many countries in the\nPacific  Ocean,  which  are  similar  to  the  Maldives.    Adequate  data  was  also  available  in  the\nMaldives on local conditions for solar insolation, and for hourly wind speed records over a period\nof several years at three airports.\n\n2.\nThe TA study concluded  that these renewable energy components for power supply were\nnot economic for the outer islands in the Maldives. Average economic costs for such renewable\nenergy  sources  would  be  more  than  $1.00  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  and  the  benefits  are  only  a\nsmall fraction of this, about $0.12-$0.14 per kWh, based on fuel cost savings, reduced operation\nand maintenance (O&M) expenses, and also the global environmental benefits of reduced carbon\ndioxide  emissions.  The  results  of  this  economic  analysis  are  summarized  in  Table  A3.1.  There\nwas some concern that perhaps the  estimated project costs  and benefits  from  these renewable\nenergy technologies might have been too conservative. Therefore ADB engaged another group of\nstaff  consultants  to  undertake  a  new  and  independent  evaluation  of  these  renewable  energy\ntechnologies  during  project  processing  at  the  fact-finding  and  appraisal  missions.  The  results  of\nthe independent evaluation are also summarized in Table A3.1.\n\nB.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n1.\n\nPhotovoltaic Power Generation\n\n3.\nA demonstration project for a PV-diesel power supply system was designed for the island\nof Hanimaadhoo, in Haa Dhaalu atoll.  This island, with a population of 840 people, currently has\na  peak  daily  load  of  about  60  kW,  and  several  diesel  generating  sets  with  400  kW  of  total\ncapacity.    With  some  future  load  growth,  it  could  accommodate  an  integrated  PV  power\ncomponent  of  40  kW,  which  would  be  adequate  to  serve  most  of  the  daytime  load.    The  bare-\nbones cost of PV power panels is about $3,000-$4,000 per kW, but after all the control equipment,\nstorage batteries, and equipment for inverters and converters to supply 220 volts (V) alternating\ncurrent (AC) power are added to this, the entire integrated PV system will cost about $14,000 per\nkW  of  PV  capacity.  This  is  much  higher  than  the  cost  of  diesel  generating  sets,  which  is  only\nabout $200 per kW for a basic diesel generator set of 100 kW, and about 50 percent more after all\nthe  control  equipment,  and  a  share  of  building  costs  and  fuel  storage  costs  are  added.\nConsequently,  the  initial  capital  investment  required  for  a  PV  system  is  about  50  times  that  for\ndiesel generating sets.\n\n1  TA 3232-MLD:  Preparing the Outer Islands Electrification Project. Feasibility Study, prepared by Samoan consultants,\n\n                  \n\nVol. 4, 2000.\n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\n4.\nThe average cost of renewable energy generation from this demonstration project would\nbe $1.20/kWh, and the benefit-cost ratio would be only 0.11 at 12 percent discount rate.  If such a\nPV  power  system  were  replicated  in  large  numbers  for  about  20-30  islands,  there  would  be\neconomies  of  scale,  especially  on  engineering  services  for  planning,  design  and  specifications,\nand  construction  supervision,  which  would  reduce  the  average  cost  to  about  $12,000/kW  of\ncapacity and $1.04/kWh, but this is still much too high and the project would remain uneconomic.\n\n2.\n\nWindmill Power Generation\n\n5.\nWindmill  power  generation  was  also  evaluated.  In  an  integrated  windmill-diesel  power\nsystem,  the  maximum  proportion  of  windmill  power  that  can  be  accommodated  is  restricted  to\nabout 15 percent of the total power production.  With more windmill generation, the power supply\nsystem would become unstable. The windmill power system that was designed initially in the TA\nstudy  for  a  typical  island  was  only  for  15  kW,  and  this  resulted  in  high  average  costs  of  about\n$16,600  per  kW  for  the  windmill  component.  During  appraisal,  the  focus  shifted  to  larger  outer\nislands  that  could  accommodate  a  larger  windmill  system  of  about  40  kW.  This  reduced  the\naverage  costs  of  capacity  (Table  A3.2).  However,  the  estimated  average  annual  capacity  factor\nwas  also  reduced  in  the  appraisal  stage  reevaluation,  based  on  a  detailed  analysis  of  historic\nhourly wind records in the Maldives. The resulting average cost of renewable energy produced by\nthe  windmill  component  was  $1.09  per  kWh  at  appraisal,  which  is  still  much  too  high.  Average\nwind  speeds  in  the  Maldives  are  relatively  low,  which  is  common  at  tropical  latitudes.2  Power\ngeneration with windmills is very sensitive to wind speed, and increases in proportion to the cubic\npower of wind speed. The average capital costs of windmill generating sets are also very sensitive\nto  economies  of  scale,  and  decrease  with  increasing  size.  The  economic  optimum  unit  size  is\nusually in the range of 150-250 kW or larger, with the maximum practical unit size close to 1,000\nkW. Consequently, with the low generating unit sizes required in the outer islands and low wind\nspeeds in the Maldives, wind power generation will be much more costly than in other countries\nwith  more  favorable  conditions.3    The  economies  of  scale  that  have  led  to  very  large,  cost\ncompetitive windmill farms in the People's Republic of China, Denmark, Germany, India, and US,\nwith large unit sizes and clusters of many windmill generators in one \u201cfarm\u201d are not available in the\nouter islands in the Maldives.\n\nC.\n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis\n\n6.\nSensitivity analysis  was performed on changes in some of the significant input variables\nand assumptions (Table A3.2). Since the rate of return is negative and is not possible to calculate4\nfor  most  scenarios,  the  results  of  the  economic  evaluation  are  expressed  in  terms  of  the\ndiscounted benefit cost ratio (B/C).  The B/C is only 0.128 for the PV power systems, assuming\nthese are replicated on many islands with the associated economies of scale, and 0.102 for the\nwindmill power systems.  These rates of return improve only slightly with a 20 percent reduction in\n\n                  \n\n2  The islands of the Maldives are spread between latitudes 7o 6\u2019  N and 0o 42\u2019 S.\n3  By comparison, in December 2000, ADB approved Loan 1818-PRC for $58 million for the Wind Power Development\nProject in the People's Republic of China. That is economically feasible, but the total installed windmill capacity there\nwill be 78,000 kW, the standard unit size is 660 kW, and the average annual plant capacity factor is estimated to be\n44 percent, compared with only 12.8 percent in the Maldives.\n\n4  The rate of return is the discount rate at which discounted net cash flow equals zero. This economic internal rate of\nreturn  (EIRR)  was  minus  17  percent  for  the  windmill  power  project  base  case,  but  for  the  PV  power  project  the\ndiscounted  net  cash  flow  was  negative  for  all  discount  rates  up  to  minus  50  percent  due  to  the  need  for  periodic\nreplacement of equipment (batteries and control equipment), and consequently the EIRR was indeterminate.\n\n\f33\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\ncosts  of  equipment,  and  annual  O&M  and  repair  costs.  With  lower  discount  rates,  the  B/C  also\nimproves, but even with 0 percent discount rate, the B/C is still only 0.267 for the PV systems, and\n0.243 for the windmill systems.  If fuel prices, which are based on a crude oil price of $28/barrel\nfor the base case, were to double, the B/C would increase to 0.218 for the PV systems and 0.186\nfor the windmill systems, which is still not economic.  Fuel prices would have to increase tenfold\nbefore the PV power supply system becomes economic, which is highly unlikely.  Carbon credits\nfor  reductions  in  global  carbon  dioxide  emissions  were  also  included  in  the  project  benefit\nevaluation, based on a carbon credit of $5/ton for the base case, which is the current consensus\nestimate  of  a  reasonable  value  for  this.  This  is  equivalent  to  only  $0.001/kWh,  and  even  if  this\nwere to increase 10 times to $50/ton, the B/C would improve only 1 percent.\n\n7.\nMany barriers are also associated with using renewable energy to generate power in the\nMaldives.  Although  the  technology  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  feasible  in  other  countries,\nusually  more  advanced,  there  is  little  experience  with  O&M  of  such  systems  in  the  Maldives.\nExperience  in  other  developing  countries  with  limited  technical  skills  has  shown  that  improper\noperation, inadequate maintenance and periodic replacement of worn equipment, and inability to\nrepair  these  systems  in  case  of  breakdown  are  serious  problems,  and  often  result  in  projects'\nbreaking  down  permanently  after  only  a  few  years  of  operation.  Technical  skills  for  operating\nsophisticated new equipment are limited in the Maldives, especially in the outer islands. The plan\nfor the renewable energy component of the Project also included a $3 million program for removal\nof these barriers to promote renewable energy technologies; that amount is not even included in\nthe project costs and economic analysis described here. The coastal marine environment in the\nMaldives is also a potential problem with power windmills.  Windmill power projects in the Pacific\nislands have experienced high rates of equipment corrosion and breakdown due to salt-laden air\nand  coastal  spray,  high  humidity  levels,  and  high  temperatures.    These  factors  could  result  in\nuseful project lifetimes much lower than the 20 years assumed for the base case in this study. If\nthe project lifetime is only 10 years, the B/C will decline to only 0.083 for PV power systems and\n0.078 for the windmill power systems.\n\nD.\n\nConclusions\n\n8.\nThese  renewable  energy  technologies  (hybrid  PV-diesel  and  windmill-diesel)  are  not\neconomically  justified  for  power  supply  in  the  outer  islands  in  the  Maldives  at  present,  to  serve\ncommunities of the size required for this Project, which are typically 100 or more households in a\nreasonably compact community center on each island. Power supply with diesel generating units\nand local distribution grids is much more economic, with each kWh costing only about one tenth\nthe average cost for renewable energy generation. It is not likely that the average capital costs of\nrenewable energy will decline significantly in the near future, but if there are significant reductions,\nthe  feasibility  can  be  reassessed.  Although  electricity  supplied  from  PV  household  modules  is\nwidely used in many developing countries, it is costly in most cases and is practiced only where\nhouseholds are far removed from a community grid, or where power supply from that grid is very\nunreliable. The average costs of PV electricity supply in the project sizes considered for this study\n(40 kW) already achieve full economies of scale, and average costs will not decline significantly\nwith large PV project sizes.  Average costs for windmill power systems will decrease with larger\nunit  sizes  and  with  clusters  of  multiple  units,  but  these  would  then  be  too  large  for  the  outer\nislands in the Maldives. Even in Mal\u00e9, the economic feasibility of larger windmill power clusters will\nbe affected by the low average wind speeds in the Maldives.\n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 3, page 4\n\nTable A3.1:  Economics of Renewable Electricity Supply in the Maldives\n\nPower\n\nPhotovoltaic\nPlant Capacity (kW)\nAverage Energy (MWh/year)\nPlant Capacity Factor (%)\nAverage Capital Cost of PV system ($/kW)\nAverage Cost of Energy ($/kWh)\nBenefit-Cost Ratio\n\nTA Reporta\nOriginal Corrected\n\n Appraisal Consultants\n\nSingle\nProject\n\nMultiple\nProjects\n\n38\n65\n19.5\n13,413\n1.215\n0.089\n\n38\n65\n19.5\n13,590\n1.204\n0.111\n\n40\n70\n20.0\n14,000\n1.201\n0.111\n\n40\n70\n20.0\n12,060\n1.045\n0.128\n\nWindmill\nGenerator Unit Capacity (kW)\nAverage Energy (MWh/year)\nPlant Capacity Factor (%)\nAverage Captial Cost ($/kW)\nAverage Cost of Energy ($/kWh)\nBenefit-Cost Ratio\nkW = kilowatt, MWh = megawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour.\na TA 3232-MLD:  Preparing the Outer Islands Electrification Project.

The  proposals  will  be  in  the  form  of  subproject  appraisal  reports.  ADB  will  review  all\nproposals prior to implementation to ensure that the subprojects are properly formulated and that\nthe  agreed-upon  assumptions,  criteria,  and  procedures  have  been  applied.    All  subproject\nplanning and appraisals must be completed to a satisfactory standard by MAA within two years of\nthe date of loan effectiveness. The subproject appraisals will be undertaken in a phased manner -\nin three phases - with 12-15 subprojects in each batch.  MAA will document all subprojects using\nan  agreed-upon  format  to  facilitate  review  and  supervision  by  ADB  missions,  and  for  the\npreparation of a project completion report and benefit monitoring and evaluation.\n\n2.\nMAA will  be responsible for  identifying, prioritizing, formulating, appraising, proposing for\napproval, and implementing subprojects for improving electricity supply on selected islands. The\ncomplete  integrated  plan  for  improving  electricity  supply  to  meet  forecast  load  growth  on  one\nisland for the next four years (2002-2005) will be considered to comprise one subproject. MAA's\nproject management unit (PMU), under the supervision of the project manager, will be responsible\nfor  carrying  out  subproject  appraisals.  PMU  will  be  assisted  by  the  project  implementation\nconsultants,  and  will  also  work  closely  with  the  island  administration  offices,  the  island\ndevelopment  committees  (IDCs),  and  island  communities  to  evaluate  the  feasibility  of  the\nsubprojects  and  prepare  detailed  plans  for  the  selected  islands.  The  final  recommended\nsubproject design for selected island must be endorsed by the island representatives before it is\nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval. The subproject appraisal reports should be in the form\ndescribed in para. 3.\n\n3.\nFor  each  subproject,  MAA  will  use  planning  and  design  criteria  and  procedures  that  are\nsimilar  to  those  used  in  the  feasibility  studies  for  sample  islands,  prepared  under  the  project\npreparatory technical assistance (TA) for Preparing the Outer Islands Electrification Project (ADB\nTA  3232)  completed  in  January  2001.  The  main  steps  in  planning  and  evaluating  of  each\nsubproject are summarized below:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nLoad forecast. The load forecast for the period until 2010 should be estimated for\neach  island  on  the  basis  of  the  following  factors:  (a)  historic  growth  rates  in\npopulation, in the local economy and income levels, and in per capita consumption\nof  electricity;  (b)  estimates  of  future  growth  of  these  variables,  and  other  factors\nthat  would  influence  the  load  forecast;  (c)  estimates  of  future  reductions  in\ndistribution  losses  as  a  result  of  the  Project,  and  of  future  trends  in  annual  load\nfactor; and (d) the resulting forecast of future electricity kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales,\nand total generation requirements for energy and for peak load.\n\nGeneration development plan. This should be determined for each island on the\nbasis  of  (a)  assessment  of  the  condition  of  existing  diesel  generating  units\n(including  estimated  fuel  efficiency,  reliability,  and  expected  annual  maintenance\nand repair costs), and the remaining useful life and recommended retirement dates\nfor each unit; (b) plan to add new generating units of an appropriate size for that\nisland  for  the  period  2002-2010,  which  should  consider  reserve  capacity\nrequirements that will offer reliable overall supply that is still affordable; (c) plans to\nadd  control  equipment  to  synchronize  the  operation  of  diesel  generating  sets\nshould  also  be  considered  for  larger  islands;  (d)  other  needs  for  improving\n\n\f39\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\npowerhouse  control  equipment,  for  constructing  fuel  storage  tanks,  and  for\ndeveloping  new  powerhouse  buildings  in  some  cases,  etc.,  also  need  to  be\nconsidered, but in each case the costs of such improvements must be determined,\nand  island  communities  consulted  to  confirm  whether  or  not  they  believe  the\nadditional  costs  of  nonessential  improvements  are  justified,  considering  the\nimpacts on island electricity tariffs.\n\nDistribution development plan. This should be determined for each island on the\nbasis  of  (a)  an  assessment  of  the  condition  of  the  existing  distribution  system,\nincluding the rated capacity of various cable sections, their estimated loading and\nlosses, and the total losses for the island; (b) prepared plans for distribution system\ndevelopment, if necessary, that will provide adequate distribution system capacity\nto  all  neighborhoods  on  the  island,  and  keep  losses  and  voltage  drops  within\nreasonable  limits.    The  costs  of  distribution  improvements  need  to  be  balanced\nagainst the benefits, and where it is practical to do so. The economic benefits of\ndistribution  system  improvements  should  be  evaluated  and  compared  with  the\ncosts so as to justify such improvements. In some cases, however, it is recognized\nthat  economic  analysis  of  distribution  system  improvements  is  difficult  or\nimpractical,  and  engineering  judgment  based  on  common  practice  may  then  be\nused to determine the necessary improvements.\n\nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  of  development  plan.  The  costs  of  all\nimprovements  must  be  fully  recovered  on  each  island  through  local  tariffs.  Each\ndevelopment plan must be affordable, and it must be economically justified. Each\nsubproject  appraisal  must  include  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the\nrecommended  development  plan  over  the  period  2002-2010.  The  economic\nanalysis  should  include  all  capital  and  operating  costs  over  this  period.  The\nincremental economic costs of additional electricity sales (compared with the base\ncase of continued operation with no load growth, or with only growth that could be\nsupported  with  existing  power  system  capacity1)  should  be  compared  with  the\nincremental  economic  benefits  of  that  additional  electricity  supply.  The  average\neconomic benefit rate calculated during appraisal for this project was about Rf6.0-\n7.0/kWh  for  electricity  use  in  the  outer  islands  in  the  Maldives.  Each  subproject\nmust  yield  a  minimum  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  10  percent.  A\nfinancial projection is also required of power supply operations for each island for\n2002-2010.  This  should  include  all  operating  costs,  and  consider  all  capital\nexpenditures and debt service on all loans.  Average tariff levels each year need to\nbe calculated, and they must be affordable.\n\nThe appraisal of each proposed subproject recommended for approval will be described in\n\n4.\na subproject appraisal report that will include the following:\n\nrecommended subproject development plan prepared as described in para. 3;\n\ndesign (at tender level) of the proposed subproject and detailed cost estimates;\n\nimplementation schedule and implementation arrangements;\n\n                                                          \n1 It should be noted that even for the base case scenario with no load growth, some diesel generating sets and other\n\nequipment will still need to be replaced when they reach the end of their useful economic lifetime.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)\n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\n(iv)\n\neconomic and financial analyses prepared as described in para. 3;\n\n(v)\n\nproposed level of tariffs and assessment of affordability;\n\n(vi)\n\nenvironmental examination;\n\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\n(ix) \n\nsocioeconomic survey results including population, household income distribution,\nand electricity uses;\n\nproposed  structure  of  the  electricity  suppliers  on  that  island,  and  relevant\nsupporting documentation; and\n\nif  land  allocation  is  required  for  construction  of  the  subproject,  (a)  proof  that\nappropriate  authorities  have  approved  the  allocation  of  government-owned  land,\nand  (b)  confirmation  that  no  resettlement  of  people  or  impact  on  livelihood  is\ninvolved.\n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 8\n\nTENTATIVE CONTRACT PACKAGE LIST\n\nContract\nNo.\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nItem Description\n\nSupply and Installation of Electricity  Supply\nSystem in the First Batch of Islands\n\nSupply and Installation of Electricity  Supply\nSystem in the Second Batch of Islands\n\nSupply and Installation of Electricity Supply\nSystem in the Last Batch of Islands\n\nTurnkey\n\nTurnkey\n\nContract Type\n(ICB)\nTurnkey\n\nEstimated\nContract\nValue ($ million)a\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2.4\n\n7.4\n\nICB = international competitive bidding.\na Does not include tax and duties.\n\nTotal\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 9, page 1\n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Maldives,  through  its  Ministry  of  Atolls  Administration\n1.\n(MAA),  intends  to  (i)  improve  the  electricity  supply  in  about  40  outer  islands  by  installing  diesel\ngenerator sets, and expanding and augmenting distribution systems; and (ii) encourage ownership\nand accountability of island communities for the supply and operation and maintenance (O&M) of\ntheir  power  supply  systems.  The  project,  to  be  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nunder its Outer Islands Electrification Project for the Maldives, will be implemented in three batches\nof islands, with 12-15 islands in each batch.\n\nThe Government also intends to improve the regulation of the power sector.  In 1998, the\n2.\nGovernment  established  the  Maldives  Electricity  Bureau  (MEB)  and  gave  it  the  responsibility  for\nregulating  the  power  sector,  including  establishing  standards  of  electricity  supply,  regulating  the\nelectricity service providers, and setting electricity tariffs. Regulation is often difficult because of the\nunique island geography of the country and the lack of qualified staff.\n\n3.\nThe Government, through the Ministry of Planing and National Development (MPND), also\nintends  to  undertake  benefit  and  poverty  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BPME)  to  monitor  and\nmeasure the social and economic benefits of the Project.\n\n4.\nAdditionally,  the  Government  has  recognized  that  the  legal  framework  for  establishing\ncommunity-based island electricity companies is inadequate.  Through its Attorney General\u2019s Office\n(AGO), the Project will strengthen the legal framework to permit the creation of community-based\nisland  electricity  supply  utilities,  or  recognition  of  the  existing  community  groups  supplying\nelectricity.\n\nB.\n\nImplementation Agency Inputs\n\n5.\nEach  agency  receiving  consulting  services  under  this  Project  -  MAA,  MEB,  MPND,  and\nAGO - will assist the consultants engaged under the Project in obtaining the required work permits\nand  visas,  and  in  meeting  any  other  requirements  under  Maldivian  law.    Each  agency  will  make\navailable to the consultants in or near its head office in Mal\u00e9, a dedicated office space, access to\nsecretarial, translation, and communication services including fax, telephone, and Internet facilities,\nif required by the consultants.\n\n6.\nMAA,  the  Implementing  Agency  of  the  Project,  will  coordinate  with  the  other  agencies\nreceiving consulting services to ensure that necessary arrangements are carried out efficiently to\nprovide  the  consultants  with  the  necessary  space  and  equipment  to  carry  out  their  tasks  with\nmaximum efficiency.  MAA will also coordinate with the other agencies to ensure (i) optimum use of\nGovernment  resources,  with  minimal  duplication  and  wastage;  and  (ii)  that  the  consultants  are\nprovided  with  the  necessary  interisland  airplane  and  sea  travel  and,  if  deemed  necessary  and\npracticable  by  the  consultants  and  the  Government,  an  interisland  boat  for  the  duration  of  the\nconsulting  services.    The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT)  will  resolve  any  potential  or\nactual  conflicts  in  arrangements  or  understanding  between  any  of  the  Government  agencies  and\nthe consultants.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nC.\n\nScope of Consulting Services\n\n7.\nAbout  30  person-months  of  international  and  93  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\nservices required for the Project will be provided under two separate consulting services contracts.\nAn  international  consulting  firm,  which  will  be  encouraged  to  associate  with  individual  domestic\nconsultants,  will  be  recruited  to  assist  MAA,  MEB,  and  MPND  with  implementing  their  respective\nparts of the Project. A domestic legal consultant will be recruited to provide legal advisory services\nto  AGO.  MAA,  in  coordination  with  MEB  and  MPND,  will  recruit  the  international  consulting  firm,\nand AGO, in consultation with MOFT, will engage the domestic legal consultant. All consultants will\nbe  recruited  and  engaged  following  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  All\nconsultants  will  be  required  to  coordinate  their  activities  with  one  another  to  ensure  smooth\ncoordination under the Project.\n\n1.\n\nImplementation Assistance to MAA\n\nAbout  20  person-months  of  international  and  80  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\n8.\nservices  will  be  available  to  assist  MAA  to  carry  out  detailed  engineering;  prepare  subproject\nappraisal reports; coordinate documentation for the establishing legal island power supply utilities;\nprepare  bid  documents;  assist  in  evaluating  bids  and  awarding  contracts;  supervise  installation\nwork,  final  testing,  and  commissioning;  and  train  island  power  supply  utilities  in  O&M  of  power\nsupply systems, and accounting. The consultants will perform the above tasks, with the objective\nof,  among  other  things,  improving  the  project  design  on  a  sustainable  and  affordable  basis,  and\nupgrading  the  project  management  skills  of  the  assigned  MAA  staff  and  other  project-  related\ngovernment  ministries.

Two  counterpart  staff  from  MPND  will  assist  the  consultants  in  conducting\nthe survey and preparing the report.\n\nMPND will be provided with about 4 person-months of international and 7 person-months of\n\n18.\ndomestic consulting services to assist it in carrying out BPME of the Project.\n\nimpacts  of \n\nthe  Project.  To  maximize \n\n19.\n BPME is intended to monitor and measure the social and economic benefits of the Project\nthat  will  allow  postevaluation,  and  to  improve  planning  for  future  electrification  projects.  BPME  is\nthe primary means of determining the extent to which projects address the need and demands of\nthe  project  beneficiaries,  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  project  approach,  policies,\nprocedures,  and  overall \ntransparency  and  public\naccountability,  BPME  will  involve  all  key  stakeholders  -  island  development  committees,  island\nwomen's committees (IWCs), and other beneficiaries - in designing and implementing BPME. The\nindicators  for  monitoring,  which  will  be  developed  during  the  initial  stage  of  the  Project  through\nparticipatory  assessment  and  workshop  at  the  atoll  and  national  levels,  will  include  (i)  number  of\nconnected  consumers  in  various  categories  versus  number  of  potential  total  consumers  in  those\ncategories  in  an  island;  (ii)  average  consumption  rates  for  consumers  in  each  category;  (iii)  tariff\nstructures  and  levels;  (iv)  technical  losses  of  electricity  supply;  (v)  description  of  new  economic\nactivities induced by the Project and their estimated total value; (vi) estimates of average income\nlevels before and after the Project; (vii) the perceived importance of various types of noneconomic\nbenefits  created  by  the  Project,  such  as  improved  quality  of  life  and  leisure  activities,  better\nenvironment for reading and study, and improved health; and (viii) poverty status.\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 9, page 7\n\n20.\nBPME  will  assess  socioeconomic  impacts  and  outcomes  and  focus  on  what  changes  -\npositive or negative, expected or unexpected - have resulted from the Project. Emphasis will be on\nmeasuring  impacts  related  to  (i)  increased  use  and  accessibility  of  electricity  services,  and  (ii)\ndirect  employment  generation  and  creation  of  economic  opportunities.  Direct  health  and\nenvironmental  impacts  may  also  be  considered  if  deemed  necessary,  i.e.,  for  specific  health  or\nenvironment-related  use  of  electricity.  Social  and  poverty  impact  monitoring  includes,  among\nothers, an analysis of the socioeconomic benefit and cost distribution across consumer categories\nand income groups, and improvement of the quality of life of the community and households such\nas  in  health  and  education.  The  assessment  will  pay  particular  attention  to  the  impacts  on  poor\nhouseholds.\n\nMPND  will  finalize  BPME  design  and  assessment  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants.\n21.\nAppropriate  methodologies  will  be  developed  for  collecting,  recording,  and  analyzing  qualitative\nand quantitative information about the Project. Both participatory and survey methods will be used.\nEfforts  will  be  made  to  facilitate  participatory  data  gathering  and  analysis  at  atoll,  island,  and\nhousehold levels.\n\n22.\nBefore  the  construction  of  subprojects,  baseline  surveys  will  be  carried  out  within  the\nsubproject  area  as  part  of  the  social,  economic,  and  poverty  assessments.  Purposive-sampling\nsurvey of islands and atolls from each region (north and south) will be done. Criteria for selecting\nthe  islands  and  atolls  will  be  developed  at  the  initial  stage  of  the  Project  through  participatory\nworkshops.  Twelve  islands  in  four  atolls  will  be  selected  as  sampling  areas  for  social,  economic,\nand poverty monitoring and evaluation in the project area. In addition, four nonproject islands in the\nsame  four  atolls  will  be  selected  as  control  areas.  Workshops  will  be  conducted  to  identify\nappropriate social and poverty indicators and to reach consensus with the beneficiaries and other\nstakeholders.\n\nBenefits  generated  during  the  project  period  will  be  measured  against  the  baseline  data\n23.\nand those for the control islands, after project completion. Beneficiaries will be involved in poverty\nimpact monitoring. Women will have an equal opportunity to participate in project activities, and will\nbe adequately represented in training for BPME.\n\n24.\nThe reporting framework will be developed by MPND with the assistance of the consultants.\nBPME will be part of the management information system (MIS) to provide the Government with a\ndetailed overview of the demand for and obstacles to electricity services in the outer islands.\n\n25.\nThe international consultants, with the support of the domestic consultants, will have overall\nresponsibility  for  BPME  including  (i)  designing,  organizing,  and  supervising  the  surveys,\nconsultations,  and  workshops;  (ii)  supervising  the  domestic  consultant;  and  (iii)  producing  the\ninception,  interim,  and  final  reports.

The  consultants  will  assist  AGO  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework  for  creating  or\nrecognizing community-based island power supply utilities.\n\n27.\nThe  Government  has  recognized  that  the  current  legal  framework  does  not  permit  the\ncreation  of  special  island  legal  entities  formed  to  address  particular  needs  of  a  particular  island.\nThe  Government  intends  to  amend  its  laws  to  address  this  shortcoming  by  reviewing  the  best\npossible legal option to meet the objectives of (i) creating a culture of community ownership among\nisland  communities  for,  among  other  things,  essential  services  such  as  electricity;  (ii)  maximize\ncommunity  participation  in  the  design  and  O&M  of  their  power  supply  systems;  and  (iii)  foster  a\nculture of financial transparency and accountability.\n\n28.\nThe legal advisory services to AGO are intended to assist the Attorney General to prepare\nand finalize the necessary draft legislation for submission to Parliament, all within the time frame\nagreed upon with the Government.  The detailed services are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nreview existing Maldivian laws and other relevant documentation, particularly\nthose related to ADB's Outer Islands Electrification Project, and consult with\nall  stakeholders  to  acquire  a  full  understanding  of  the  status  of  the  legal\nframework,    the  objectives  of  the  Project,  and  the  need  for  creating  legally\nrecognized  community-based \nisland  power  supply  utilities,  such  as\ncooperatives, under the Project;\n\ncarry  out  all  legal  tasks  necessary  to  assist  AGO  to  prepare  amending  or\noriginal legislation to submit to Parliament for approval within the time frame\nestablished  and  agreed  to  by  the  Government  under  the  Project,  including,\nbut  not  limited  to  preparing  draft  legislation,  explanatory  notes,  supporting\ndocumentation, reports, etc.;\n\nconduct  another  round  of  consultation  with  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  the\nlegislation addresses all relevant issues;\n\nin coordination with the team leader for implementation services to MAA and\nwithin  three  months  of  the  commencement  of  those  services,  organize  for\nrelevant  Government  officials,  including  representatives  from  MAA,  MPND,\nMOFT,  and  MEB  a  study  tour  to  a  neighboring  country  with  a  cooperative\nlaw  on  the  books,  and  a  proven  track  record  in  operating  cooperatives,  to\nreview  whether  a  cooperative  legal  structure  and  cooperative  law  are\nfeasible options for the island power suppliers;\n\nprepare and submit a report to ADB within five months of the start of these\nservices,  reporting  on  the  status  of  proposed  reforms  to  be  undertaken  by\nthe Government; and\n\ncoordinate  and  work  with  all  other  consultants,  particularly  the  team  leader\nand  consultants  assigned  to  MAA,  to  ensure  proper  timing  and  smooth\ncoordination between the activities of AGO and the rest of the Project.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nMAJOR ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS\n\nA.\n\nGeneral\n\nSince the islands evaluated had no proper past records, proforma financial projections of\n1.\neach  of  the  island  power  supply  utilities  were  prepared  for  the  period  2001-2010  to  see  how\neach  of  them  will  perform  over  this  period.  The  financial  projections  focus  on  the  island\u2019s\nincome,  expenditure,  and  cash  flow  position  presented  in  local  currency  (Table  A10).  The\nprojections  are  in  current  terms.  Domestic  inflation  was  assumed  at  5.0  percent  while  the\ninternational  inflation  rate  was  2.4  percent  annually.  These  rates  are  based  on  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  Project  Administration  Instructions  No.  1.3  issued  in  June  2000.  A  large\nportion  of  the  capital  expenditures  will  be  in  foreign  currency,  and  the  exchange  rate  used  to\nconvert the costs to local currency is Rf12.80 to $1.00.\n\nB.\n\nInvestment Projections\n\nThe capital expenditures for each of the islands evaluated are based on the investment\n2.\nrequirements  set  out  during  the  forecast  period  up  to  2010.  It  was  assumed  that  investments\nincurred  up  to  2005  would  be  covered  or  financed  under  the  Project,  and  subsequent\ninvestments for replacements or expansions were assumed to be arranged by the island power\nsupply  utilities  themselves.  The  capital  costs  are  defined  as  base  costs  (as  estimated  by  the\nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  consultants)  plus  10  percent  physical  contingencies\nand  12.5  percent  taxes  and  duties  on  the  foreign  exchange  components.  Price  contingencies\nare taken into account, to reflect price changes during the forecast period, i.e., by inflating these\ncosts by the domestic inflation rates.\n\nC.\n\nElectricity Sales, Revenues, and Tariffs\n\nElectricity  sales  and  generation  for  each  island  utility  are  based  on  the  demand\n3.\nprojections for each island. The growth situation in each island is unique, i.e., in some of these\nislands, like Funadhoo and Muli for example, populations are expected to increase substantially\nin the next few years as the Government declared Funadhoo a resettlement island, and Muli as\na  atoll  capital.  In  such  cases,  electricity  demand  and  sales  are  projected  to  increase\nsubstantially  in  line  with  this  population  growth.  In  general,  electricity  demand  in  the  outer\nislands  has  been  suppressed  due  to  unreliable  and  limited  supply.  With  the  Project,  system\nlosses  are  expected  to  reduce  to  10  percent  (Table  A10)  from  the  current  20-30  percent,  and\nreliability will improve as each island will have sufficient generating capacity to supply electricity\nfor 24 hours a day.\n\n4.\nRevenues  over  the  forecast  period  are  based  on  total  sales  (kilowatt-hour  [kWh])  per\nannum by the island power supply utilities in the sample islands at the projected financial tariffs\ngenerally ranging from Rf3.50 to Rf6.0. These tariffs were set based on a minimum cash break-\neven principle, i.e., revenues should be sufficient to cover operating costs, the greater portion of\ndepreciation  or  debt  service  requirement,  and  the  need  to  ensure  that  cumulative  cash  flow\nremains positive. Compared with the existing tariffs, the projected tariffs in many islands show\nimprovements (see projected tariffs in Table 3 of the main text). The Project will reduce the high\nsystem  losses,  increase  efficiency,  and  thus  provide  increased  profitability  from  higher  sales\nvolume  and  lower  operating  costs.  In  general,  due  to  high  operating  costs,  current  tariffs  are\nonly sufficient to finance ongoing operation and maintenance (O&M) in many islands, and they\ncannot cover the full cost of capital replacement. In many cases, the Government provided the\nislands  with  free  generators,  so  many  of  them  are  not  aware  that  they  will  bear  the  costs  of\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nreplacing the generators. Under the Project, the staff of the island power supply utilities will be\ngiven  some  training  in  management  and  accounting/bookkeeping  skills  to  enable  them  to\nunderstand the basic cash break-even principle and to keep proper records of their operations.\nIn addition, the Project will attempt to instill a culture of accountability and a sense of ownership\nof power supply systems.\n\nD.\n\nOperating Costs\n\n1.\n\nFuel Cost\n\n5.\nWith  the  Project,  fuel  use  efficiency  is  expected  to  improve  to  0.31  liter/kWh  from  the\ncurrent  levels  of  0.33-0.38  liter/kWh.  Many  power  supply  utilities  in  the  outer  islands  currently\nbuy fuel at Rf4.5 per liter but in Mal\u00e9, the State Electric Company Limited buys at Rf4.0 per liter.\nThe cost of fuel in the outer island is higher due to transportation costs. However, despite the\nfact that these islands are so spread out, the costs of fuel on each of the islands are very much\nthe  same.  The  Government  does  not  provide  any  subsidy  on  fuel.    Fuel  cost  for  subsequent\nyears are projected to move in line with the domestic inflation rate.\n\n2.\n\nLube Oil Cost\n\nWith the Project, lube use efficiency will improve to 0.003 liter/kWh from 0.004 liter/kWh.\n6.\nThe  cost  of  lube  oil  in  the  outer  islands  is  currently  at  Rf25.0/liter.  This  cost  is  projected  to\nincrease in line with domestic inflation rate.\n\n3.\n\nOperating and Other Expenses\n\n7.\nO&M cost was assumed at $0.015 for each kWh generated, and an annual provision for\nbad debt was estimated at 5 percent of total electricity sales for the year. Salaries and wages\nare based on the current salaries in each of these sample islands, Rf1,000-Rf2,000 per month\nper  person.  All  these  cost  projections  are  assumed  in  current  terms,  increasing  in  line  with\ndomestic inflation.\n\n4.\n\nInterest Expenses\n\n8.\nUnder the Project, the outer islands will be charged a re-lending rate of 8.0 percent per\nannum.  The  loan  will  be  in  local  currency;  therefore  the  islands  are  not  exposed  to  foreign\ncurrency  risk.  The  interest  rate  for  subsequent  financing  of  capital  expansion/replacement  will\nbe based on the current commercial lending rate of 12.0 percent per annum.\n\nE.\n\nDebt Service and Borrowings\n\n9.\nThe Government will on-lend the ADB loan (excluding the cost of consulting services) to\nthe outer islands repayable over 12 years with a grace period of 4 years for the loan principal\nrepayment.  The  Government  will  provide  land  if  required.  The  Government  will  charge  8.0\npercent  per  annum  on  the  loan.  The  12-year  repayment  period  follows  the  average  economic\nlife of about 8-9 percent of the proposed assets (i.e. 7 years on the generators and 20 years on\ncables/distribution system). Subsequent borrowing for major capital expenditure is assumed to\ncover  about  70  percent  of  total  costs  (30  percent  self-financing)  and  will  have  a  repayment\nperiod of seven years with a one-year grace period.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nTable A10:  Income, Expenditure and  Cash flow Projections for Vaikaradhoo FY2001-2010\n(All costs and revenues are in Rf '000 in current prices.)\n\n2001\n5.00%\n1\n\n2002\n5.00%\n1.05\n\n       \n\n2003\n5.00%\n1.10\n\n       \n\n2004\n5.00%\n1.16\n\n       \n\n2005\n5.00%\n1.22\n\n       \n\n2006\n5.00%\n1.28\n\n       \n\n2007\n5.00%\n1.34\n\n       \n\n2008\n5.00%\n1.41\n\n       \n\n2009\n5.00%\n1.48\n\n       \n\n2010\n5.00%\n1.55\n\n       \n\n0.0\n\n1,719.2\n\n30.0\n\n32.2\n\n458.2\n\n37.3\n\n640.1\n\n43.1\n\n707.8\n\n49.8\n\n320.8\n\n448.1\n\n495.5\n\n0%\n100%\n0%\n100%\n0.0\n\n110\n180\n22%\n141.1\n9\n1,239\n2.4%\n235\n2.4%\n4.00\n\n564.3\n28.2\n536.0\n\n293.7\n113.0\n31.7\n5.4\n443.7\n\n68.8\n\n1.2\n\n0.0\n\n110\n201\n22%\n157.1\n9\n1,269\n2.4%\n240\n2.4%\n4.00\n\n628.3\n31.4\n596.9\n\n344.7\n118.6\n37.2\n6.0\n506.4\n\n110\n193\n10%\n173.7\n3\n1,299\n2.4%\n246\n2.4%\n4.00\n\n694.8\n34.7\n660.0\n\n312.8\n41.5\n37.4\n6.6\n398.3\n\n120\n212\n10%\n190.7\n3\n1,330\n2.4%\n252\n2.4%\n4.25\n\n810.6\n40.5\n770.1\n\n360.7\n43.6\n43.1\n7.7\n455.1\n\n          \n          \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\n       \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n          \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n         \n\n       \n\n       \n\n       \n\n       \n\n       \n\n       \n\n       \n\n       \n\n       \n\n120\n231\n10%\n208.0\n3\n1,362\n2.4%\n258\n2.4%\n4.50\n\n120\n250\n10%\n225.2\n3\n1,394\n2.4%\n264\n2.4%\n4.50\n\n120\n269\n10%\n242.1\n3\n1,428\n2.4%\n271\n2.4%\n5.00\n\n120\n287\n10%\n258.4\n3\n1,462\n2.4%\n277\n2.4%\n5.25\n\n160\n304\n10%\n273.9\n3\n1,497\n2.4%\n284\n2.4%\n5.50\n\n160\n324\n10%\n291.6\n3\n1,532\n2.4%\n290\n2.4%\n5.75\n\n936.0\n46.8\n889.2\n\n1,013.4\n50.7\n962.8\n\n1,210.6\n60.5\n1,150.1\n\n1,356.8\n67.8\n1,289.0\n\n1,506.4\n75.3\n1,431.0\n\n1,677.0\n83.8\n1,593.1\n\n412.9\n45.8\n49.4\n8.9\n517.0\n\n469.5\n48.1\n56.1\n9.6\n583.3\n\n530.0\n50.5\n63.4\n11.5\n655.3\n\n594.0\n53.0\n71.0\n12.9\n730.9\n\n660.9\n55.6\n79.0\n14.3\n809.9\n\n739.0\n58.4\n88.4\n15.9\n901.7\n\nCash Available from Operations\n\n92.3\n\n90.4\n\n261.7\n\n315.0\n\n372.2\n\n379.5\n\n494.8\n\n558.1\n\n621.1\n\n691.4\n\n           \n-\n           \n-\n\n         \n-\n         \n-\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n     \n143.0\n         \n-\n143.0\n\n     \n145.5\n         \n-\n145.5\n\n     \n164.8\n         \n-\n164.8\n\n     \n     \n\n184.0\n213.9\n397.9\n\n     \n     \n\n218.8\n230.3\n449.2\n\n     \n     \n\n198.6\n309.1\n507.7\n\n     \n     \n\n228.9\n325.0\n553.9\n\n     \n     \n\n198.5\n413.0\n611.5\n\n92.3\n\n90.4\n\n118.7\n\n169.5\n\n207.4\n\n-18.5\n\n45.6\n\n50.4\n\n67.2\n\n79.9\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n1,788.0\n0.0\n\n0.0\n1,788.0\n1,788.0\n\n31.2\n0.0\n\n0.0\n31.2\n31.2\n\n32.2\n\n458.2\n\n37.3\n\n640.1\n\n43.1\n\n707.8\n\n49.8\n\n320.8\n320.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n448.1\n448.1\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n495.5\n495.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\nAnnual Cash Flow\n\n92.3\n\n90.4\n\n118.7\n\n137.2\n\n69.9\n\n-55.8\n\n-146.4\n\n7.4\n\n-145.2\n\n30.1\n\nCumulative Cash Flow\nIDC = Interest during construction, kW = kilowatt, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MWh = megawatt-hour.\nSources: ADB and Consultant's estimates.\n\n118.7\n\n325.9\n\n255.9\n\n270.1\n\n123.7\n\n131.0\n\n-14.1\n\n15.9\n\nYear Ending 31 December\nDomestic Inflation Rate (%)\nInflation Factor\n\n\"Project\" Capital Cost \nOngoing costs\nProject Financing (%)\nGovernment of Maldives Grant\nGovernment of Maldives Loan\nCommunity\nTotal\nAdd Interest (IDC)\n \n\nElectricity Operation\nTotal Installed Capacity (kW)\nGeneration (MWh)\nDistribution Losses (%)\nElectricity Sales (MWh)\nNumber of Employees\nTotal Population\nPopulation Growth (%)\nNumber of Consumers\nConsumer Growth (%)\nTariff (Rf/kWh)\n\nRevenues  \nSales \nLess Bad Debts\nNet Revenues\n \nOperating Expenses\nDiesel Fuel and Oil\nSalaries and Wages\nRepair and Maintenance\nOthers\nTotal Operating Expenses\n\nDebt Servicing\nInterest\nLoan Repayment\nTotal\n \nCash Flow after Debt Service\n\nInitial Investment (plus IDC)\nCapital Replacement/Expansion\n\nGrant Funds\nLoan Funds\nTotal Funds\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  by  the  project  preparatory\n1.\ntechnical assistance (TA) consultants for a representative eight sample islands1 in accordance\nwith ADB's environmental assessment requirements and environmental review procedures. The\nIEE  was  discussed  and  formally  submitted  to  the  Government  in  January  2001  as  part  of  the\nfinal TA report.\n\nB.\n\n2.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\nA detailed description of the Project is given in para. 46-47 of the main text.\n\nAll the sample islands visited were typical atoll islands, only a meter or two above mean\n3.\nsea  level.    Soils  are  generally  poor  and  sandy.  The  islands  vary  from  9  to  220  hectares  (ha),\nand  population  density  from  4  to  64  people  per  ha.  Little  in  the  way  of  land  mammals  were\nsighted, other than the occasional domesticated cat. Bird life was not prolific.\n\n4.\nHuman  settlements  were  closely  spaced,  following  a  rectangular  grid  pattern  of  roads.\nRoads  were  generally  laid  out  on  a  rectangular  basis,  and  were  soft  coral  sand.  None  of  the\nroads in the sample islands were sealed. Generally, the settlements were close to the center of\nthe  islands,  but  in  more  densely  populated  islands  sometimes  spanned  the  full  width  of  the\nisland with a band of vegetation between the outermost houses and the ocean shore.\n\n5.\nOn  most  islands  each  house  is  surrounded  by  a  2-meter-high  plastered  coral  block\nfence. This usually enclosed a number of small residential structures and a building for cooking\nand food preparation. Older houses had few external windows, but newly constructed ones had\nbarred windows of a moderate size.\n\nFishing boats, cargo boats, and passenger boats are essential to island life. Numerous\n6.\nboats are generally moored in a well-defined area or areas and, where provided, in harbors. All\nislands  without  harbors  wanted  to  construct  a  harbor  by  dredging  the  reef.  Reclaiming  land\nusing  sand  and  material  dredged  from  the  reef  is  also  a  favored  development  activity.\nOrganized farming is limited, even on those islands classified as agricultural.\n\n7.\nAll the islands had a freshwater table close to the surface. On some islands, this water is\nhighly polluted and unsuitable for washing or drinking. On other islands, the water is suitable for\nwashing,  but  is  not  used  for  drinking,  except  in  emergencies.  Rainwater  from  house  or\ncommunal tanks is the main source of drinking water.\n\n8.\nOn  many  islands,  solid  waste  is  dumped  on  the  surface  just  inside  the  forest  line.  A\nconsiderable  amount  of  solid  waste  finds  its  way  into  the  ocean  and  is  washed  up  on  the\nbeaches.  It  is  evident  that  both  increased  population  and  increased  development  is  stressing\nthe environment. While the central residential areas of the islands were generally clean and well\ncared for by the community, there seemed to be little general awareness of the fragility of the\necology on atoll islands or of the steps that need to be taken to protect the environment.\n\n1 Neykurendhoo, Nolhivaramu, Vaikaradhoo, Funadhoo, Mulah, Muli, Naalaafushi, and Veyvah.\n\n                  \n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigating Measures\n\n9.\nA  minor  short-term  potential  environmental  impact  derives  from  the  installation  of\ngenerators and cables. There will be a potentially more long-term environmental impact from the\noperation of the power stations. The following paragraphs describe the potential environmental\nimpacts and their mitigating measures.\n\n1.\n\nConstruction\n\na.\n\nPower Station Buildings\n\n10.\nExisting  power  station  buildings  will  be  used  where  possible.  Few  buildings  will  be\nconstructed  under  the  Project,  and  they  will  be  small,  no  bigger  than  a  house,  and  will  use\nbuilding  materials  and  skills  commonly  available  on  the  outer  islands.  Where  a  new  power\nstation is required, land and clearing requirements will be small. Population relocation will not be\nrequired.\n\n11. Where  required,  existing  power  stations  will  be  modified  to  mitigate  environmental\neffects.  Such  work  will  be  minor  and  will  be  limited  to  sealing  existing  buildings,  providing\nsound-proof air vents, and establishing bulk fuel tanks and bunded oil-handling areas.\n\nb.\n\nUnderground Distribution Cables\n\n12.\nAll cables will be low voltage. In almost all locations, they will be buried along the side of\nexisting  unsealed  roadways.  They  will  be  protected  from  interference  by  burial  depth  and  by\nsteel wire armoring.\n\n13.\nAll cables will be covered with an inert polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheath. The trenches will\nbe  opened  for  only  a  short  while,  as  the  sandy  soil  conditions  are  such  that  a  trench  would\ncollapse if left open. No trees will be cleared for the distribution works.\n\n14.\nAt  the  level  of  voltage  proposed,  there  will  be  no  transformers  and  no  high-voltage\nswitchgear. Under the proposed design, there is no possibility for using polychlorinated biphenyl\n(PCB) oils; however, if capacitors are to be used to correct a low load factor, it is recommended\nthat  the  specification  exclude  the  use  of  PCB  oils.  PCB  oils  are  cancer  causing,  and  as  they\nbreak down in the soil or water table, spills or leaks eventually enter the food chain. No negative\nenvironmental impact has been identified, other than the remote possibility that PCB oils may be\nused in capacitors, if capacitors are installed.\n\n2.\n\nOperation\n\na.\n\nPowerhouse Operation\n\n15.\nDiesel  Oil  Transport.  Transporting  oil  to  the  islands  appears  to  be  carried  out  safely.\nSome  islands  receive  their  supply  from  bulk  tankers  that  are  operated  either  by  the  State\nTrading Organization (STO) or by private entrepreneurs. This simple operation was carried out\ncompetently and without any spillage. The tanker crew observed accepted safety practices, and\nappeared to have the operation well under control at all times. Most oil is carried to the island in\n200  liter  drums  on  the  routine  cargo  boat  supplying  the  island.  This  oil  in  drums  is  usually\npurchased  from  Mal\u00e9,  but  one  island  purchased  its  oil  from  Kulhudhuffushi.  Some  utilities\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\npurchased fuel oil from bulk stores on their own island. Transporting oil by drums seems a safe\nmethod of transport. Empty drums are returned for reuse.\n\n16.\nAlthough  reef  damage  resulting  from  the  anchors  of  the  many  general  cargo  and\npassenger boats is evident, there is no evidence of damage to the reef by the anchors of boats\nspecifically involved in fuel transportation.\n\n17.\nDiesel  and  Lubricating  Oil  Spillage.  There  is  very  little  evidence  of  oil  having  been\nspilled at the fuel storage or handling areas. However, where there was significant oil spillage,\nno action was taken to remove the contaminated sand from the site. Education and monitoring\nof  cleaning  up  after  oil  spills  are  required.  The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Housing  and\nEnvironment (MHHE) will establish officers on each atoll to regulate environmental compliance\nand  provide  environmental  education.  The  officer  will  be  able  to  take  adequate  steps  to\nminimize the damage caused by minor spills.\n\n18.\nIn general, oil storage facilities are poor. Where they exist, bulk tanks are generally not\nbunded, nor is the surrounding area concreted. Even though diesel oil is rated as combustible,\noften oil is stored in a manner that presents a considerable fire risk to the power station and to\nthe neighboring residences. In more than one location, oil was stored inside the power station.\nIn  one  location  the  oil  was  stored  inside  the  power  station  in  a  2,000-liter  plastic  water  tank,\nwhich has the potential for splitting.\n\n19.\nUnder  the  Project,  bulk  tanks  will  be  installed  at  all  power  stations  where  they  are\nrequired.  The  tanks  will  be  at  least  5  meters  removed  from  the  station  building,  bunded  with\nconcrete  lining  within  the  bund.  Under  the  Project,  drum  handling  areas  should  be  concreted\nand fitted with interceptor drains.\n\n20.\nDisposal and Handling of Waste Lubricating Oil. Lubricating oil is generally stored in\n200-liter  drums  near  the  power  station.  In  most  locations  waste  lubricating  oil  is  greatly  in\ndemand for treating timber. On one island, waste lubricating oil is buried in a hole in the beach,\nand  in  another  it  is  dumped  into  a  well.  On  both  islands,  the  power  station  managers  thought\nthey were behaving responsibly. Where oil has contaminated the soil, the soil should be dug up\nand  entombed  in  concrete,  so  that  the  oil  does  not  flow  down  to  the  water  table.  Waste\nlubricating  oil  contains  low-level  carcinogens.  Care  should  be  taken  to  prevent  skin  contact\nwhen handling the waste oil. As the general public is not aware of this danger, it may be better\nto discourage the sale of waste lubricating oil.\n\n21.\nPower  station  managers  need  to  be  trained  in  environmentally  acceptable  disposal\nsystems. Probably the simplest method of disposal is to mix waste lubricating oil with diesel fuel\nand utilize it as fuel. Engine manufacturers accept that waste lubricating oil at a maximum rate\nof 5 percent can be mixed with fuel oil. Thus 10 liters of waste lubricating oil can be added to\n200 liters of fuel oil. The mixture should be stirred well, preferably shortly before use. Provision\nhas been made in the project estimates for such training.\n\nNoise. All the power stations in the sample were unnecessarily noisy. Some engines did\n22.\nnot even have silencers. Project estimates allow for power stations on the project islands to be\nsealed  and  noise  baffles  fitted  to  air  inlets  and  radiator  air  outlets,  where  this  is  required.\nEstimates allow for providing stainless steel, residential class primary and secondary silencers\non all new engines, and replacing existing silencers that are currently inadequate.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nEmissions.  The  Project  will  replace  old  engines  that  have  passed  their  economic  life\n23.\nwith  new  and  more  efficient  engines.  This  action  will  reduce  exhaust  emissions.  To  further\nreduce  emissions,  the  Project  will  train  the  power  station  managers  to  monitor  diesel  engine\nefficiency and system losses. Such monitoring requires simple and inexpensive instrumentation-\nalso  provided  by  the  Project  -  in  the  power  station.  Under  the  Project,  exhaust  pipes  will  be\nextended  to  ensure  acceptable  dispersal  of  exhaust  gases.  Horizontal  exhaust  pipes  will  be\nreplaced with vertical exhausts.\n\nVibration.  Ground  vibration  was  not  observed  to  be  a  problem  in  any  of  the  power\n\n24.\nstations. All engines are small and have high speed, and vibration will not be a problem.\n\n25.\nFire. Despite overall good housekeeping, the fire risk is unacceptably high as a result of\nthe diesel oil storage practices. Oil and other combustible materials should be stored well away\nfrom the power station building. Under the Project, bulk tanks will be established 5 meters clear\nof  the  power  stations  and  will  be  bunded  to  prevent  the  spread  of  burning  oil.  Storing  large\nquantities  of  oil  in  a  residential  area  is  not  acceptable.  Additional  and  larger  fire  extinguishers\nwill be funded by the Project.\n\nb.\n\nUnderground Distribution Cables\n\nNo  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  operation  of  underground\n\n26.\ndistribution cables were identified.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring\n\n27.\nThe designs to be prepared by the consultants will be submitted for approval to both the\nMaldives Electricity Board (MEB) and MHHE. MHHE will be establishing officers on each atoll to\nmonitor  general  environmental  compliance  and  provide  environmental  education.  Consultants\nsupervising the contractor will coordinate and cooperate with such officers.\n\n28.\nMany  poor  environmental  practices  within  the  electricity  supply  industry  arise  from\ninefficient  operation  of  plants  and  ignorance  of  environmentally  safe  procedures.  Under  the\nProject,  consultants  will  provide  on-site  system  management  and  operation  training,  including\ntraining in efficient plant operation, and environmentally acceptable procedures for oil disposal,\ncleaning up after oil spills, and fire precautions and fire fighting.\n\nMEB regulates a number of issues relating to the environment but at present, it does not\n29.\nhave  the  institutional  capacity  to  monitor  compliance  in  the  outer  islands.  It  needs  an  active\npresence in the islands. To this end, MEB will appoint an inspector in each of the atolls covered\nunder the Project.\n\nF.\n\nFindings\n\nThis  IEE  confirms  that  all  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with\n\n30.\nupgrading the electricity supply systems in the outer islands can be satisfactorily mitigated.\n\n31.\nThe Project will have a positive impact on the environment as the efficiency of the diesel\nengines will be improved and system losses reduced. Carbon and nitrous oxide emissions will\nbe  lessened.  The  Project  will  also  finance  the  construction  of  new  powerhouses  for  some\nislands,  with  better  sites  away  from  village  centers,  and  better  noise  insulation  than  in  the\n\n\fexisting buildings. Furthermore, items proposed to be funded under the Project address issues\nsuch as\n\n58\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n(vi)\n(vii) \n\nreduction of oil spillage;\ncontrol of oil spillages that may occur in the vicinity of diesel power\nstations;\ndisposal of waste lubricating oil;\nreduction of noise;\ndispersal of exhaust gases;\nminimization of risk; and\ntraining  of  operators,  power  station  engineers,  and  directors  in\nenvironmentally acceptable practices.\n\nG.\n\nConclusion\n\n32.\nThe  IEE  for  the  representative  sample  eight  islands  reveals  no  significant  adverse\nimpact  on  the  environment  that  cannot  be  mitigated.  The  preparation  of  a  detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment is not deemed necessary.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nPOVERTY DIMENSIONS AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\nA.\n\nPoverty and Social Characteristics\n\nIn  1998,  about  42  percent  of  the  population  were  estimated  to  live  on  an  income  less\n1.\nthan  Rf15  ($1.27)  per  person  per  day.1  Although  income  poverty  as  defined  thus  exists\neverywhere  in  the  country,  nevertheless  the  poor  are  concentrated  on  certain  islands.    The\nGovernment's Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment (VPA) shows that 26 percent of the income\npoor  are  on  20  islands.  Eight  of  the  focus  islands  to  be  considered  under  the  Project  are  the\ngroup of the 20 poorest islands. However, poverty in the Maldives context may differ from that in\nmany  other  countries.  In  the  Maldives,  poverty  also  means  vulnerability  to  living  conditions\nprimarily related to remoteness of islands, lack of services, and limited access to markets.\n\n2.\nAlthough the human development index (HDI) for the Maldives is higher than for all other\nSouth Asian countries except Sri Lanka, social indicators are lower in the outer islands. In 1998,\ninfant  mortality  rate  was  estimated  at  62  per  1,000  for  the  Maldives  and  69  per  1,000  for  the\nouter islands. Overall life expectancy was estimated at 69.6 years for the Maldives and 62 years\nfor  the  outer  islands,  with  individual  outer  islands  falling  in  the  broad  range  of  52  years  (Raa\nAtoll) and 69 years (Seenu Atoll).  Life expectancy for women was some three years higher than\nfor men.  The adult literacy rate is very high, averaging 98 percent of the adult population, with\nvirtually  no  difference  between  rates  for  Mal\u00e9  and  the  outer  islands  and  between  men  and\nwomen.  The  main  educational  challenges  identified  are  preeminently  qualitative  in  nature  as\nindicated by disparities in the education index between Mal\u00e9 and the outer islands.\n\nThe  VPA  report  indicates  that  there  is  a  large  disparity  in  income  and  vulnerability\n3.\nbetween  islands.  It  tends  to  be  highest  in  the  smallest  islands.  Overall,  10  percent  of  the\nnation\u2019s most vulnerable population was found on 45 islands - the majority with relatively small\npopulations - and 20 percent on 90 islands.  Furthermore, the VPA report revealed that some of\nthe targeted project areas2 (six in Baa, two each in Thaa and Raa, and one each in Shaviyani\nand Gaafu Dhaalu) are among the poorest areas in the country.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n1.\n\nAffordability and Willingness To Pay for Improved Electricity\n\n4.\nAll  islands  agree  on  the  need  for  an  improved  electricity  supply.  The  demand  for\nimproved  electricity  is  indicated  by  the  expressed  willingness  to  pay  higher  tariffs  for  greater\ncapacity and a reliable supply.  However, households currently using less than 10 kilowatt-hours\n(kWh)  per  month  do  not  have  the  ability  to  pay  higher  tariffs  and  have  less  resources  to\ngenerate  increased  income  from  an  improved  electricity  supply.    The  major  benefit  to  these\nhouseholds  will  occur  if  improved  efficiency  results  in  reduced  tariffs.  In  many  islands,  the\nProject  is  expected  to  lower  electricity  tariffs  in  real  terms  through  increased  efficiency  and\nreduced distribution losses.\n\nElectricity tariffs in the outer islands generally range from Rf3.50 to Rf6.00 per kilowatt-\n5.\nhour (kWh). Veyvah island charges a tariff of Rf1.25 per watt of capacity per month, which for a\n\n                                                \n1 The poverty assessment relied heavily on Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment, 1998, a report prepared by the\n\nGovernment with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme.\n\n2    The  Government  prepared  a  list  of  75  islands  from  which  about  40  islands  will  be  selected  for  the  Project.  The\n\ntargeted project areas refer to these 75 islands.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n40-watt  fluorescent  tube  running  four  hours  a  night  is  equivalent  to  Rf10  per  kWh.  High  tariffs\nare needed in small systems, and small groups of customers find it difficult to meet the costs of\ncapital-intensive  equipment.  Average  electricity  consumption  for  the  majority  of  the  sample\nislands3  is  around  25  kWh  per  month  or  less,  generally  the  level  set  for  a  lifeline  tariff.    In\naddition, the lowest quartile on most of the sample islands consume 12 kWh per month.  This\nlowest quartile generally can  afford to pay for its consumption at around 5 percent or less of the\nhousehold income. The poor are paying the full cost of electricity consumption now. In many of\nthe  outer  islands,  the  tariff  projected  under  the  Project  is  less  than  what  is  being  paid  in  real\nterms now. In many countries, electricity utilities charge for new connections.  This is generally a\nway  of  meeting  the  cost  of  the  connection  and  can  be  readily  identified  with  each  household.\nAmong the sample islands, only Vaikaradhoo charges a connection fee of Rf240.  The majority\nof the beneficiaries recommend that the policy on free connection be continued with all domestic\nconnections.  Free connection removes a considerable burden from the poor, who find it difficult\nto meet the initial capital cost necessary for connection.\n\n2.\n\nAbsorptive Capacity of Consumers\n\n6.\nAbsorptive  capacity  is  demonstrated  by  the  desire  of  the  intended  beneficiaries  to\nupgrade  their  power  supply  systems.    More  than  90  percent  of  the  populations  in  the  sample\nislands have electricity connection. A good electricity supply for 24 hours a day is a high priority\nfor  households  with  less  than  24  hours  supply.  Where  households  already  have  a  24-hour\nsupply, the level of desire for improvements is demonstrated by their stated willingness to spend\nmore  of  their  savings  for  buying  electrical  appliances.  Further  evidence  is  shown  by  the\nconsiderable effort of communities in the sample islands to improve their power supply systems\nthrough communal fund raising activities.\n\n3.\n\nParticipatory Approach\n\nUnder  the  sector  loan  approach,  the  design  and  implementation  of  subprojects  will  be\n7.\nundertaken  through  participatory  consultation  at  the  island  level  with  the  administration,  island\ndevelopment  committees  (IDCs),  island  women's  committees  (IWCs),  and  beneficiaries.    The\nProject  will  also  support  awareness  campaigns  and  building  capacity \nfor  community\nparticipation  in  design,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  project\nfacilities. In addition, IDCs, nongovernment organization (NGOs), and other community groups\nwill be supported to enhance their understanding of electricity supply services. Those who run\nelectricity supply systems in the outer islands will be strengthened and trained in management\nto increase their operational efficiencies.\n\n4.\n\nSocial Benefit of the Project\n\nThe  Project  will  improve  electricity  supply  in  the  outer  islands  on  a  sustainable  and\n8.\naffordable basis.  Reliable energy supply is essential for sustained improvements in household\nwelfare  and  as  an  input  to  businesses  for  generating  economic  growth.  For  households,  a\nreliable  supply  of  electricity  will  create  an  incentive  to  invest  in  productivity-enhancing\nequipment, such as electrical carpentry equipment or fish-processing facilities. For businesses,\na  reliable  supply  of  electricity  will  reduce  the  production  costs  for  goods  and  services,  and\nimprove  other  production  factors  such  as  labor  and  natural  resources,  and  thus  encourage\nexpansion  of  businesses.  The  growth  in  businesses  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  reducing\n\n                                                \n3    Since  it  was  impractical  to  select  and  survey  all  the  islands  that  will  participate  in  the  Project,  a  representative\n\nsample of eight islands was selected and studied.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\npoverty  through  increased  employment  opportunities.  Improving  the  supply  of  electricity  to  the\nouter  islands  supports  the  Government  policy  in  securing  sustainable  improvements  in  living\nstandards and quality of life of the outer island populations so as to achieve balanced regional\ndevelopment and ease the significant population pressures on Mal\u00e9.\n\n5.\n\nGender Issues and Project Impact on Women\n\n9.\nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  condition  of  women.  Site  visits  and\ninterviews indicate that improved quality of electricity supply will benefit general family welfare,\nparticularly of women.  Where there is sufficient disposable income for electrical appliances, the\nincreased  use  of  flatirons  and  washing  machines  will  lighten  women's  domestic  workload.  A\nreliable electricity supply will also create more home-based income-generating opportunities for\nwomen  such  as  rope  making  in  the  evening.    For  higher  income  households,  increased\navailability  of  electricity  will  provide  opportunities  for  increased  household  income  through\nactivities such as sewing and production of freezer goods.  In one island visited, women were\nconsidering putting up  computer and fax services should the electricity supply improve.\n\n6.\n\nLand Acquisition for New Powerhouse\n\n10.\nThe  Project  involves  no  resettlement  and,  if  land  is  required,  the  Government  will\nallocate  lands  that  will  not  involve  settlement.  Existing  powerhouses  will  be  used  wherever\npossible.  New  powerhouses,  if  any,  will  be  small,  and  for  the  most  part  will  not  require  land\nexceeding  400  square  meters.  An  assessment  of  the  sample  islands  indicated  that  none  of\nthem  would  require  land  for  a  new  powerhouse.  There  is  no  private  land  ownership  in  the\nMaldives and all lands belong to the Government, and atoll chiefs have the authority to allocate\nland up to 400 square meters for public use. Reflecting the importance the Asian Development\nBank  (ADB)  places  on  careful  and  effective  implementation  of  land  acquisition,  receipt  from\nappropriate authorities of approval of the allocation of government-owned land, and confirmation\nthat  no  resettlement  of  people  or  impact  on  livelihoods  is  involved  will  be  the  conditions  for\napproving subprojects under the Project.\n\n7.\n\nProject Benefit and Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n11.\nBenefit  and  poverty  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BPME)  of  the  subprojects  will  be\nundertaken  in  collaboration  with  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries  in  each  subproject  area.  The\nBPME  design  will  be  finalized  by  consultants  to  be  engaged  for  the  Project  and  with  advisory\ninputs  from  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries.  Before  construction  for  the  subprojects,  baseline\nsurveys will be carried out in the subproject area as part of the social assessment, and benefits\ngenerated  during  the  Project  will  be  measured  against  these  initial  data.  Stakeholders  and\nbeneficiaries will also be involved in the monitoring. Under the Project, the Ministry of Planning\nand  National  Development  (MPND)  will  develop  a  reporting  framework  to  allow  preparation  of\nthe necessary information for the BPME program. BPME as part of a management information\nsystem (MIS) will give the Government a detailed overview of the demand for and constraints to\nelectricity supply services in the outer islands. Poverty impact monitoring and evaluation will be\npart  of  BPME  and  will  be  administered  by  MPND.  This  component  will  be  implemented  in\ncoordination  with  atoll  and  island  offices,  IDCs,  IWCs,  NGOs,  and  other  beneficiaries.    It  will\nhelp  to  establish  the  baseline  profile  of  the  poverty  situation  in  the  sample  islands,  establish\nqualitative and quantitative monitoring indicators and mechanisms, and monitor project activities\nand their impacts (both positive and adverse) on the sample islands.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nC.\n\nPoverty Targeting\n\n12.\nThe Project is expected to cover 17 out of 20 atolls in the country. In 17 atolls, about 40\nislands  will  be  selected.  Poverty  reduction  will  be  an  active  objective  in  selecting  the  islands.\nPoverty targeting of the island will also consider the poverty and vulnerability criteria developed\nby  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  The  criteria  are  education,  health,\nfood  security,  employment  opportunities,  access  to  electricity,  sum  of  human  vulnerability\nindices,  non-income  vulnerability  index, \nindex,  and  composite  human\nvulnerability index.\n\nincome  poverty \n\nD.\n\nEstimated Impact on Poverty\n\nADB\u2019s  new  focus  on  poverty  reduction  underscores  the  need  for  carrying  out  benefit\n13.\ndistribution  and  poverty  impact  analysis  for  projects.  Such  analysis  adds  significant  values  to\neconomic analysis of projects as it (i) enables stakeholders to identify and quantify all direct and\nindirect  project  benefits  accruing  to  different  project  stakeholders  such  as  Government,\nelectricity  service  providers,  and  consumers;  (ii)  quantifies  the  net  benefits  that  go  to  project\nparticipants  living  below  the  poverty  line,  which  enables  stakeholders  to  check  if  the  project\ndesign  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  poverty  reduction;  and  (iii)  enables\nstakeholders to check on how the changes in government policies will affect the beneficiaries,\nparticularly the low-income households.\n\n14.\nThe geographic coverage and the selection criteria for island participants ensure that the\nProject will provide electricity in the outer islands where the majority of the country's poor reside.\nBased on an analysis of the sample islands, it is estimated that the Project will directly benefit\nabout 45,000 people, about 50 percent of whom are poor.4\n\n15.\nFour  main  stakeholders  were  identified:  household  consumers,  light/home  industries,\nlocal  government,  and  power  supply  utilities,  among  whom  the  projected  benefits  were\nallocated.  The  project  preparatory \nthat  all\nstakeholders are the net gainers. The largest beneficiaries of the Project are laborers, followed\nby  consumers,  and  power  supply  utilities  as  well  as  the  general  economy.    All  net  gains  to\nlaborers  and  consumers  come  from  reliable  access  to  electricity,  lower  electricity  tariffs,  more\nemployment  opportunities,  all  leading  to  a  higher  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rate.\nThe consumers will also benefit directly from the Project through the increased operating life of\nelectrical appliances.\n\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  report \n\nindicated \n\n16.\nThe economic impacts of power projects are generally a more reliable electricity supply,\nincreased efficiency, more employment opportunities (including O&M of power supply systems),\nall leading to a higher GDP growth rate.  An underlying objective of the Project is to give poor\nhouseholds  and  communities  in  outer  islands  better  and  reliable  access  to  electricity.  This\nintervention  will  have  important  and  direct  effects  on  the  welfare  of  the  poor.  The  direct\neconomic opportunities for the poor can be in (i) easier establishment and greater productivity of\nbusinesses that employ the poor, (ii) creation of employment in infrastructure service delivery,\nand  (iii)  improved  health  and  education  and  savings  in  time  and  effort  that  will  increase\nindividual productivity.\n\n17. With a more reliable electricity supply, outer island communities will receive non-financial\nbenefits as well. Reliable and extended hours of electricity supply will allow them to put electric\n\n                                                \n4 Head count ratio, percentage of the population with less than Rf15.0 ($1.27) per person per day (VPA, 1998).\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\nlighting in schools, or refrigerators in community health clinics, access electricity for lighting, or\nuse  electrical  appliances  for  household  businesses.  The  Project  is  expected  to  facilitate  the\ndevelopment  of  other  basic  infrastructure  such  as  better  health,  education,  and  information\ncommunication facilities, thereby improving access to and productivity in the labor market. The\nindirect  effects  of  improved  access  to  electricity  services  will  also  arise  from  two  sources:\nimproved  efficiency  of  the  sector  and  the  economy,  which  increases  total  wealth,  and  the\nrelease  of  more  funds  for  other  activities.  These  indirect  effects  will  benefit  the  poor  both  as\nmembers of society and as consumers.\n\n18.    A  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR),  expressing  the  proportion  of  net  economic  benefits\naccruing to the  poor, was calculated by comparing the net economic benefits to the poor with\nthe net economic benefits to the economy as a whole. The TA report indicated that the GDP of\nthe poor in the focus islands is approximately 11 percent of the total GDP of the country.  This\nimplies  that  the  Project  will  have  a  positive  poverty  reduction  impact  when  PIR  exceeds  11\npercent. The TA report confirmed that the poverty reduction impact will be significant since the\nPIR averages 32 percent for the Project as a whole, and exceeds 11 percent in all islands that\nwere selected for evaluation of the Project.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\n\nA. \n\nProject Basis\n\nThe Project for electrification of the outer islands in the Maldives will provide assistance\n1.\nto expand power supply systems, and in some cases to replace them completely, on about 40\nof the outer islands. The Project will provide improved power supply to about 8,500 households\nwith  a  population  of  about  45,000.  Since  it  was  impractical  to  survey  all  the  islands  that  will\nparticipate in the Project, a representative sample of eight islands in Haa Dhaalu atoll, Shaviyani\natoll  in  the  north  and  in  Meemu  atoll  in  the  south-central  part  of  the  Maldives  was  selected.\nUnder the project preparatory technical assistance (TA), these islands were surveyed in detail to\ndetermine the condition of the existing power supply system, the local economy, expected load\ngrowth,  the  requirements  for  improving  the  power  supply;  and  to  prepare  plans  for  expanding\nthe  power  supply  on  each  island.  The  ADB  Mission  also  visited  these  islands.  The\nrepresentative islands are listed in Table A13.1.\n\nTable A13.1:  Representative Outer  Islands\n\nExisting Power System in 2000\n\nPopulation\nin 2000\n\nGenerating\nCapacity\n(kW)\n\nElectricity\nSales\n(MWh/yr)\n\nAverage\nTariff\n(Rf/kWh)\n\nAvailability\n(h/day)\n\nIsland\n\nAtoll\n\nNeykurendhoo Haa Dhaalu\nNolhivaramu Haa Dhaalu\nVaikaradhoo Haa Dhaalu\nFunadhoo\nMulah\nMuli\nNaalaafushi\nVeyvah\n\nShaviyani\nMeemu\nMeemu\nMeemu\nMeemu\n\n940\n1,553\n1,210\n1,107\n1,208\n789\n394\n182\n\n55\n116\n110\n129\n188\n176\n68\n21\n\n34\n62\n128\n123\n175\n169\n24\n10\n\n5.00\n6.00\n4.00\n4.00\n3.50\n4.00\n6.00\n10.00\n\n14\n20\n24\n24\n24\n24\n18\n12\n\nkW = kilowatt, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MWh = megawatt-hour.\n\nEach island already has some form of public power supply, which is owned and operated\n2.\nin  most  cases  by  the  local  island  development  committee  (IDC).  On  one  island,  a  local\nnongovernment organization (NGO) that is closely associated with the IDC owns and operates the\npower  supply  system.  These  power  supply  systems  serve  almost  all  the  households  on  each\nisland, except for a few households. Many outer islands have power supply 24 hours a day, but\nsome  have  service  only  at  night.  Most  electricity  consumption  is  for  residential  use,  but  also\nincludes  small  shops  that  are  usually  integrated  with  the  households.  Government  and  public\nfacilities (local schools, local government offices, etc.) compose the other major consumer group.\nThere is also some commercial consumption on the larger islands.\n\n3.\nLoad forecasts were prepared for each island, starting from the existing level of sales. The\nforecast  model  is  based  primarily  on  forecast  future  per  capita  consumption  growth  rates  and\npopulation  growth  rates.  Some  islands  have  high  planned  population  growth  due  to  plans  to\nresettle people from the smaller islands to the larger islands. Per capita consumption growth rates\nare adjusted for each island also based on historic trends, expected improvements in reliability of\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\npower supply, tariff reductions in some cases, and comparisons with average consumption rates\non  comparable  islands.  An  example  of  a  load  forecast  and  generation  expansion  plan  for  one\nisland is shown in Table A13.2.\n\nThe existing power supply systems in most cases are not very reliable.  Generating units\n4.\nare  often  old,  with  poor  fuel  efficiency;  generating  capacity  is  inadequate  at  times,  especially\nwhen  a  unit  is  out  of  service.  Distribution  losses  are  often  high  due  to  old  cables  that  are  in\nmany  cases  undersized  for  current  loads.  The  planned  power  system  improvements  for  many\nislands will involve replacing inefficient generating units with new diesel generator sets, and in\nsome  cases  replacing  inefficient  and  undersized  distribution  systems.  In  other  cases,  only\nadditional  generator  capacity  and  upgrading  of  distribution  systems  are  required.  For  isolated\nsystems  of  this  size,  the  least  costly  way  of  supplying  power  is  from  diesel  generators.  Other\nforms  of  generating  power,  such  as  combined  cycle  or  thermal  steam,  are  not  economic  or\npractical  for  the  small  generating  units  required  by  these  islands.  Generation  from  renewable\nenergy - photovoltaic solar or wind power - is much more costly than diesel generation, with the\naverage cost per kWh about 10 times higher than for diesel energy.\n\nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits of Improved Power Supply\n\n5.\nEconomic  benefits  resulting  from  improved  electricity  supply  under  the  Project  are  an\nincrease  in  total  electricity  generation,  sales,  and  consumption  on  these  islands;  improved\nefficiency  of  existing  power  supply  systems  and  reduced  distribution  system  losses;  and\nimproved efficiency of fuel consumption in diesel generating sets, resulting in reduced total fuel\nconsumption, due both to reduced distribution losses and improved fuel efficiency in generation\nEach category is evaluated in the following sections.\n\n1.\n\nEconomic Benefits of Electricity Consumption\n\nResidential  consumers,  who  account  for  most  electricity  sales,  use  electricity  for  lighting\n6.\nprimarily,  and  for  radio,  television,  fans,  washing  machines,  electric  irons,  etc.  Electricity  is  not\nused for cooking, since firewood is generally available on most islands. In cases where firewood is\nnot  available,  kerosene  is  still  much  cheaper  than  electricity  for  cooking.  An  upper  limit  on  the\nvalue of electricity used for lighting is the alternative cost of kerosene lighting, which is equivalent\nto about Rf10/kilowatt-hour (kWh). The additional or induced electricity consumption for residential\nconsumers  is  valued  on  the  basis  of  the  average  willingness  to  pay  for  electricity  based  on  a\ndemand vs price curve that was derived from data for various islands in the survey.  The average\ntariffs and electricity sales in these islands vary over a wide range, and formed an excellent basis\nfor  plotting  a  demand  curve  for  electricity  consumption,  based  on  regression  analysis,1  which  is\nshown in Figure A13.1. The average willingness to pay under this demand curve is Rf7.00/kWh\nfor a tariff rate of Rf3.86/kWh (the expected average tariff in future) and household consumption of\n43  kWh  per  month.  With  lower  tariffs  and  higher  levels  of  average  consumption,  the  average\neconomic value of consumption will be less. These values are in local economic prices, at year\n2001 price levels.\n\n                  \n\n1 The regression analysis assumed a constant price elasticity of power demand, and was also adjusted for average\nhousehold income levels. The resulting fit was very good, with R2  of .986. The price elasticity of average electricity\nuse per household was found to be -1.36.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\nFigure A13.1:  Electricity Demand in Maldives Outer Islands\n\n)\nh\nW\nk\n\n/\nf\n\nR\n\n(\n \nf\nf\ni\nr\na\nT\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nSales (kWh/month/house)\n\n7.\nTo  evaluate  the  economic  benefits  of  increased  electricity  supply,  the  dependable\ncapacity, and sales level of the existing power systems were determined first.  Then the additional\nsales due to the new project were calculated, and valued at the unit rates described in para. 6.\n\n8.\nThe economic analysis did not attempt to evaluate the benefits of improved reliability and\nquality of power supply. Adequate voltage levels are important for starting fluorescent lights, and\nfor operating such lights and appliances such as televisions sets, etc. They are valuable, both for\nincreased user satisfaction and for increased appliance lifetimes, but it is difficult to measure these\nbenefits  due  to  lack  of  data  on  operating  statistics,  and  to  convert  this  to  economic  terms.\nHowever, in discussions with local IDCs, dissatisfaction was often expressed with the poor quality\nand reliability of the existing power supply. Electricity use will also have important nonquantifiable\nbenefits by increasing the total hours of useful time in the evening for study, social interaction, and\nentertainment,  and  it  generally  results  in  improved  health  standards.  In  view  of  these\nnonquantifiable benefits, which are not included in the economic evaluation, the minimum required\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for each subproject is set at 10 percent.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Evaluation of Efficiency Improvements\n\n9.\nThe proposed Project will also improve the operating efficiency of power supply operations\nfor  the  existing  loads  and  consumption  level.    This  is  due  to  improved  fuel  efficiency  with  new\ngenerating  units,  reduced  consumption  of  lubrication  oil,  and  reduced  annual  repair  and\nmaintenance costs. Upgrading or replacing distribution systems will also reduce total distribution\nsystem losses, which are rather high now on some islands. In some cases, the Project will also\nfinance  replacement  of  all  old  fluorescent  light  fixtures  on  an  island  and  install  modern  new\nelectronic  ballasts  so  as  to  improve  low  power  factors  and  reduce  distribution  losses.  These\nefficiency  improvements  are  valued  at  the  economic  cost  savings  they  achieve.  An  example  of\nthis evaluation for the island of Vakairadhoo is shown in Table A13.3.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\n3.\n\nEvaluation of Costs\n\n10.\nThe economic evaluation uses domestic prices at 2001 levels for both costs and benefits.\nEconomic  costs  exclude  duties  and  taxes  on  imported  materials  and  equipment,  but  the  border\nprices  for  imported  supplies,  equipment,  and  fuel  are  converted  to  local  domestic  prices  by\ndividing by the standard conversion factor of 0.90. The cost of crude oil is assumed to remain at\ncurrent  prices,  $25/barrel  Free  On  Board  (FOB)  Singapore,  at  year  2001  price  levels.  This  is  a\nconservative assumption, inasmuch as the last World Bank commodity price forecast expects a\nreal  decline  in  future  oil  prices.2  The  resulting  diesel  fuel  prices  are  Rf4.50/liter.  The  useful\neconomic lifetime for the new power supply equipment is assumed to be 7 years for small high-\nspeed  diesel  generating  sets,  and  20  years  for  the  underground  distribution  cables.  Diesel\ngenerating sets need to be replaced when they reach the end of this lifetime.\n\n11.\nThe total investment required to improve power supply and meet the load growth for the\nperiod up to 2005 (inclusive) for the six representative islands evaluated for this Project would be\n$1.2 million in base costs, which is equivalent to an average investment of about $180 per person\nserved.  This  compares  with  an  average  per  capita  cash  income  on  the  outer  islands  of  about\n$800 annually.\n\nC.\n\nResults of Economic Analysis\n\n12.\nA detailed plan and economic evaluation was prepared for each of the eight representative\nislands. Tables A13.2 and A13.3 show the data for Vaikaradhoo. The Fact-Finding Mission found\ntwo islands not suitable for inclusion in the Project, even though the consultant had included them\nin  the  TA  study.  For  Naalaafushi,  a  new  generating  unit  was  recently  installed,  and  no  more\ncapacity is needed for the planned duration of the Project up to 2005.  For Veyvah, the island is\nvery small, and with a reduced and more realistic forecast of load growth, it was not economically\nfeasible  to  expand  power  supply  to  a  high  standard.  On  the  remaining  six  islands,  it  is\neconomically  and  financially  feasible  to  improve  power  supply.  The  EIRR  for  each  island  is\nsummarized in Table A13.4. The average EIRR for all six islands (based on the consolidated net\ncash flow stream for all islands) will be 19.4 percent.\n\nTable A13.4:  Summary of Project Economics\n\nProject\nInvestment\n(Rf million)\n3.25\n1.38\n1.88\n3.49\n2.25\n3.25\n\nIsland\n\nNeykurendhoo\nNolhivaramu\nVaikaradhoo\nFunadhoo\nMulah\nMuli\nAverage\n\nCurrent\nTariffs\n(Rf/kWh)\n5.00\n6.00\n4.00\n4.00\n3.50\n4.00\n4.06\n\nProjected\nTariffsa\nIn 2006\n(Rf/kWh)\n5.01\n3.92\n3.53\n3.33\n3.33\n3.53\n3.55\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n13.3\n16.9\n17.0\n24.9\n16.2\n22.7\n19.4\n\nFIRR\n(%)\n6.1\n2.1\n2.8\n1.2\n1.2\n6.1\n3.4\n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = Financial internal rate of return, kWh = kilowatt-hour.\na Adjusted to constant 2001 price levels.\n\n                  \n\n2 The most recent World Bank commodity price forecast, in April 2001, forecasts future crude oil prices of $20/barrel\n\nby 2003, $18/barrel by 2005, and $19/barrel by 2010, all in current dollars.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\n13.\nSensitivity analysis, conducted for the scenarios shown in Table A13.5, indicates that the\neconomic  performance  of  the  Project  is  robust  for  increases  in  fuel  costs  or  in  capital  costs.\nFuture crude oil prices are rather uncertain; nevertheless, the Project can tolerate a doubling of\noil prices and still remain economic. The project economics are most sensitive to reductions in\nestimated  unit  benefits  or  in  total  energy  sales.  The  Project  would  switch  to  becoming\nuneconomic if average benefit rates for new sales were reduced more than 32 percent, based\non a minimum 10 percent EIRR, or if total energy sales were reduced by more than 30 percent,\nwithout  considering  a  corresponding  reduction  in  planned  development  of  the  power  supply\nsystems. Such large variations are considered unlikely.\n\nTable A13.5:  Sensitivity Analysis\n\nScenario\n\nBase case\nFuel costs increased by 10%\nAll capital costs increased by 10%\nAverage benefits reduced by 10%\nEnergy sales reduced by 10%\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\n19.4\n18.9\n17.7\n16.8\n16.1\n\nSI\n\n\u2013\n.05\n.17\n.26\n.33\n\nFIRR\n (%)\n\n3.4\n2.3\n2.1\n0.8\n1.0\n\nSI\n\n\u2013\n.11\n.13\n.26\n.24\n\nEIRR - Economic internal rate of return, FIRR = Financial internal rate of return., SI = Ratio of percentage change\nin the EIRR to the percentage change in the given parameter.\n\nD.\n\nFinancial Evaluation of the Project\n\nThe financial evaluation differs from the economic in that financial prices are used for all\n14.\nproject costs, which include duties and taxes on capital costs and fuel costs. Project benefits are\nbased  on  the  financial  revenues  from  additional  electricity  sales  due  to  the  Project,  starting  in\n2003,  and  from  the  savings  in  operating  costs  due  to  efficiency  improvements.  It  is  assumed\nthat electricity tariffs will be reduced on each island, as shown in Figures A13.2 and A13.3, so\nthat  each  island  will  achieve  cash  breakeven,  including  payment  of  debt-service  costs.  The\noverall tariff rate in real prices (adjusted for inflation) is expected to decline by about 13 percent\nby  2006.  The  resulting  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRR)  for  each  island  are  shown  in\nTable  A13.4.  The  average  FIRR  for  the  overall  project  is  estimated  to  be  3.4  percent  in  real\nterms, without inflation. The FIRR is relatively low because tariffs on each island will be kept as\nlow  as  possible,  while  maintaining  cash  breakeven.  However,  the  FIRR  is  still  higher  than  the\nweighted average cost of capital of 2.8 percent in real terms (net of inflation).\n\n15.\nThe  Project's  financial  feasibility  is  more  robust  to  changes  in  the  main  variables  than\nindicated  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  (Table  A13.5).  In  the  event  of  an  unexpected  increase  in\nproject  capital  costs,  or  fuel  costs,  or  change  in  forecast  sales,  the  average  tariff  could  be\nadjusted to achieve a satisfactory financial rate of return. In the case of crude oil prices higher\nthan $25 per barrel, average tariffs would have to increase about $0.0025 for each $1 per barrel\nin  oil  costs.  A  large  tariff  increase  would  in  turn  have  some  impact  on  load  growth,  but  if\nexpansion plans are adjusted for this, the longer term impacts can be accommodated.\n\n\fTable A13.2:
