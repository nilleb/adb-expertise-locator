THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Republic of Maldives for the Outer Islands Electrification (Sector) Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has significantly contributed to the power sector in\nthe Maldives through its loans and technical assistance (TA) programs to help meet electricity\ndemands in the capital island of Mal\u00e9 and to strengthen institutional capacity of the sector.\nConsistent with its strategy of supporting balanced regional development, ADB has shifted its\nfocus to rural electrification in the outer islands, where the majority of the country\u2019s poor reside\nand poor electricity supply has constrained economic and social development. The proposed\nProject supports the new focus and has been included in ADB\u2019s lending program for 2001 and\nwas prepared under ADB project preparatory TA1 completed in January 2001.  The Project is an\nintegral part of the least-cost development plan for the power sector, and is accorded high\npriority by the Government.  The Appraisal Mission was conducted from 14 to 26 September\n2001.2 This report is based on the findings of the TA report and the Appraisal Mission, and\ninformation provided by the Government. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. Location\n3. The  Maldives  comprises  about  1,200  varied  and  diverse  islands,  grouped  into  20\nadministrative atolls.3 The islands form a chain of 820 kilometers (km) long and 130 km at its\nwidest point, set in the Indian Ocean to the southwest of India. Only 33 inhabited islands have a\nland area of more than 1 km2, and only 3 each have an area larger than 3 km2. The Maldives\nhas no rivers, lakes, or streams. While there are occasional gales (on average 12 days a year)\nand tropical thunderstorms (on average 23 days a year), the Maldives lies outside the main\nareas of tropical cyclones.\n4. The Maldives population of 269,010 is scattered in about 200 inhabited islands4 and 83\nresort islands. About 20 islands have more than 2,000 people; 50 islands 1,000-2,000; 80\nislands, 500-1,000; and 50 islands, less than 500 people. The widely dispersed population and\nthe economic  constraints  imposed  by  lack  of  land-based resources and the diseconomies of\n                  \n1 TA 3232-MLD: Preparing the Outer Islands Electrification Project, for $300,000, approved on 30 July 1999.\n2 The Appraisal Mission comprised P.B. Song, Mission Leader and Project Engineer; J. Kuiper, Senior Project\nEconomist; C. Wee, Senior Counsel; S. Tukuafu, Financial Management Specialist; and L. Gunaratne, Renewable\nEnergy Consultant.\n3  In the Maldives, the term \"atoll\" is normally associated with a group of inhabited islands. The term \"outer islands\" is\nused in this report to refer to outer inhabited islands, and to differentiate these from the capital island and those\nthat are used for tourist resorts.\n4 Inhabited islands are defined as islands with a local population and an administrative office. They do not include\ntourist resorts and industrial islands.", "2\nscale  associated  with  small  populations  on  islands  have  all  contributed  to  considerable\ninequalities of development, which the Government has tried to address. A policy to ensure that\nbenefits of development are shared in a balanced manner among the population is a central\nfeature of the country's priorities and development plans.\n2. Economic Growth\n5. Economic growth has been strong, with an annual average rate of 10 percent during the\n1970s and 1980s, and 6-7 percent in the 1990s. The economy is expected to grow at the rate of\n5-6 percent over the next five years. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 2000 was\nprovisionally estimated at $2,059.5  The population growth rate is relatively high, averaging 3.4\npercent during 1985-1990 and falling to 1.9 percent during 1995-2000. Assuming the current\nmortality rate, a reduction in fertility rates, and no migration, the population is expected to reach\n300,000 by 2005 and 500,000 by 2023. The rapid population growth rate coupled with high\neconomic  growth  continues  to  place  a  significant  demand  for  infrastructure  and  financial\nresources in the country.\n6. A quarter of the national population or about 70,000 people live in the capital island of\nMal\u00e9, which has a land area of only 2.1 km2. It is crowded and has one of the highest population\ndensities in the region. The 1995 census indicated that most of Mal\u00e9\u2019s population is housed in\ndwellings accommodating over 10 people, with a quarter of the households accommodating\nover 14 people. Despite the Government\u2019s efforts, the large disparities between Mal\u00e9 and the\nouter islands continue to widen. There is significant migration from the outer islands to Mal\u00e9 for\nbetter income and living standards. Providing the outer islands with a reliable and sustainable\nelectricity supply will help reduce the disparities and ease the substantial population pressures\non Mal\u00e9.\n3.  The Power Sector\na. Energy Situation\n7. The  Maldives  has  no  known  indigenous  petroleum,  gas,  or  coal  resources  and\nhydropower is not feasible because of the topography. Firewood and petroleum are the only\ncommercial fuels and firewood is a common cooking fuel on most of the outer islands. The loss\nof tree cover has become serious and the Government has restricted on cutting and requires\nthat for each tree cut, two must be planted. However, it is unable to enforce the regulation\nproperly and much firewood is cut illegally.  Petroleum is imported as refined product by the\nState Trading Organization and a number of private entrepreneurs. Diesel is largely used to\ngenerate electricity in the capital, and for about 1,000 electricity generators in the outer islands.\nIt  is  expected  that  the  country  will  continue  to  rely  on  imported  petroleum  fuel  for  power\ngeneration. Petroleum products are also used for transportation, fishing, household cooking,\nand other minor uses. Petroleum product imports account for a significant percentage of total\nimports.  Solar energy is used in traditional ways, such as for drying fish and for heating water in\nsome resorts. It is also harnessed for remote area telecommunications and navigational aids.\nb. General Structure of the Sector\n8. Various organizations provide electricity in the Maldives including the State Electric\nCompany  Limited  (STELCO),  island  development  committees  (IDCs),  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), and private companies. STELCO is currently responsible for supplying\nelectricity to Mal\u00e9 and to 20 of the larger outer islands, altogether more than half of the nation\u2019s\n                  \n5 The GDP series was revised recently. Prior to the revision, per capita GDP in 1999 was $1,488.", "3\npopulation. STELCO was established in 1997 under a Presidential Decree pursuant to the\nCompanies Act. It is fully owned by the Government and was formed specifically to succeed the\nutility part of the Maldives Electricity Board, a Government-owned and -controlled institution\nestablished in 1982. The Maldives Electricity Bureau (MEB) succeeded the regulatory part of\nthe Maldives Electricity Board in 1998. STELCO, formerly the Maldives Electricity Board, began\noperating in 1982, serving only the island of Mal\u00e9. Its operations were expanded to 5 islands in\n1990, 17 in 1996, and 20 in 2000.\n9. The IDCs are community-based extensions of the Government and are the grassroot\ninstitutions in the development of the islands.  NGOs running power supply systems range from\ncommunity-based formal and registered organizations to informal community clubs using the\nsale of electricity as a fund-raising activity. The private sector companies are operated and\nowned by small-scale family entrepreneurs, or by substantial private companies. Some outer\nislands have more than one electricity provider, often supplying the same geographic area. Of\n97 focus islands,6 about 50 have electricity systems owned and operated by IDCs, 20 by private\ncompanies, 10 by NGOs, and 20 by STELCO. Regulating generation, distribution, and utilization\nincluding tariff setting is the responsibility of MEB. At present, electricity generation is entirely by\ndiesel-based generators. Distribution is almost exclusively by underground cables, using low-\nvoltage, three-phase, four-wire 400/230 volt cables augmented by 11 kV high-voltage cables\nwhere needed. Except on the largest islands, distribution from the power station is by low-\nvoltage cables.\n10. Both  electricity  tariffs  and  tariff  structures  vary  between  islands  since  tariff-setting\nmechanisms are under de facto decentralized decision making with consideration for the local\ncontext.7  In Mal\u00e9, the electricity tariffs are Rf2.0-Rf4.0 ($0.16-$0.31) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). In\nouter islands with electricity supplied by STELCO, tariffs are Rf2.5-Rf4.0 ($0.20-$0.31) per kWh.\nFor the outer islands with private companies or local communities supplying electricity, the\naverage tariffs are usually in the range of Rf3.50-Rf6.00 ($0.27-$0.47) per kWh, and can be as\nhigh as Rf10.00 ($0.78) per kWh in some islands. Unlike in many other developing countries,\ncollecting the electricity bill has not been an issue in the Maldives. Most households pay their\ndues on time partly due to peer pressure in the small and closed nature of island society.\nc. The Project Area\n11. Despite the recent marked improvement in macroeconomic indicators, poverty still exists\nin the Maldives. About three quarters of the Maldives\u2019 population live in the outer islands. Their\nlivelihoods  depend  on  small  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  limited  public  sector  employment.\nAlthough an official poverty line for the Maldives has not yet been established, the Vulnerability\nand Poverty Assessment (VPA)  report  conducted  in  1998  by  the  Government,  with  the\nassistance  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  estimates  that\napproximately 50 percent of the outer island populations live on less than Rf15.08 per person\nper day. This incidence of poverty is more than double the percentage in Mal\u00e9.\n                  \n6 The Government selected these focus islands for accelerated development, taking into account their administrative\nimportance, population, potential for development, etc. (para. 23). The focus islands also include islands where\nelectricity is supplied by STELCO.\n7  In the Maldives, all power supply utilities are required to submit proposals for their own tariff structures and levels to\nthe Maldives Electricity Bureau for endorsement.\n8 Equivalent to $1.27 based on the prevailing exchange rate at the time of the study. This poverty line is used\nthroughout the report.", "4\n12. The percentage of the population with access to electricity has rapidly grown over the\nlast decade. In 1990, it was estimated that one third of the nation's population had no access to\nelectricity. The percentage had fallen to 13 percent by 1995, and to 7 percent in 1998. Although\naccess to electricity has improved considerably, electricity supply systems in the outer islands\nare generally inadequate. Operation hours are often restricted, quality is usually poor, and\nsystems are inefficient. Poor quality of electricity supply suppresses demand, as customers are\noften  reluctant  to  invest  in  electrical  appliances,  which  have  only  a  short  operating  life.\nCurrently, many of the outer island population have access to electricity for only 5-12 hours a\nday. The efficiency of power supply systems in most of the outer islands is low. Undersized\ncables,  inaccurate  customer  meters,  mismatch  of  the  system  to  the  load,  and  inefficient\ngenerating plants have all led to high system losses. The unreliable electricity supply in the\nouter islands limits the living standards of the population, inhibits a wide range of development\non the islands, and increases the vulnerability of the population. The VPA report identified\nadequate electricity supply as one of the key variables in the human vulnerability index (HVI) for\nthe Maldives. Access to reliable and adequate electricity supply contributes to well-being, and\nsocial  and  human  resource  development,  and  provides  greater  opportunities  for  income-\ngenerating activities.\n13. Each year, the Ministry of Atolls Administration (MAA) has provided about 20 electrical\ngenerators with capacity ranging from 15 kW to 80 kW to the outer islands on an adhoc grant\nbasis. Over a three-year period, about 50 islands have received generators as a free gift. In\naddition, MAA has administered development loans with a revolving fund scheme in the amount\nof Rf20 million for island electrification from the Government Treasury Fund and the Bank of\nMaldives. Until April 2001, 17 islands had received assistance amounting to Rf6.3 million from\nthe Treasury loan scheme, and 39 islands had received loans amounting to Rf8.6 million from\nthe Bank of Maldives.  The repayment period is usually five years including a six-month grace\nperiod. The interest rate of the Treasury loan is 8 percent per annum. In the case of the Bank of\nMaldives, the interest rate is 12 percent, but MAA subsidizes 4 percent annually from its budget,\nmaking the actual interest rate equivalent to 8 percent per annum. These financing schemes\nhave helped the islands, but are not sufficient to meet the demand for upgrading the power\nsupply systems in the outer islands.\n14. The safety standards in distribution networks and house wiring are poor, largely due to\nlack of skilled manpower to properly inspect and test the equipment and electrical installations.\nSmall private suppliers especially tend to ignore the quality of supply requirements, and literally\ngenerate electricity out of a backroom in their home. This is a major concern of the customers,\nwho invariably rate improved reliability and quality of supply as very important. The Government\nhas realized the problem and initiated internal discussions about placing MEB staff or appointing\nMEB representatives in each of the atolls to carry out the regulatory and inspection function\nproperly.\n4. Key Sector Issues\na. Regional Development\n15. Regional  disparity  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the  outer  islands  has  continued  to  be  a  key\ndevelopment issue.  According to the VPA report, income disparities between Mal\u00e9 and the\nouter islands were in the order of 2:1, with the ratio increasing to 3:1 when the lowest average\nper capita income is considered. In addition, inequalities in access to social and physical\ninfrastructure and services between Mal\u00e9 and the outer islands were found to be far more\npronounced, averaging 4:1 on a composite index that took account of various indicators. The\nrapid growth of the population in the Maldives has increased the urgency of providing a broad\nrange of social and physical infrastructure in the outer islands. The wide dispersal of the", "5\npopulation  inevitably  raises  the  costs  in  providing  these  services.  It  is  recognized  that  an\nexcessive development focus on Mal\u00e9 will constrain the future growth of the country. Therefore,\nregional development is considered as a key factor in easing the development pressure on Mal\u00e9\nand at the same time addressing equity concerns.\nb. Institutional Capacity of Island Power Utilities\n16. Except for those islands where electricity is supplied by STELCO, the outer island\ncommunities and the island administration are generally incapable of proper operation and\nmaintenance (O&M) of power supply systems. They do not have the level of specialized utility\nmanagement skills required to operate the power supply systems at optimal level, and do not\nadequately take account of the long-term capital replacement requirements. Almost all power\nstation managers and operators lack the skills needed to efficiently operate a power supply\nsystem. There is no appreciation of the need to monitor the efficiencies of operations, fuel\nconsumption, or distribution losses.  Furthermore, bookkeeping and cost-accounting systems\nare very simple, and sometimes totally neglected.  There is a critical need to build the capacity\nof outer island power supply utilities to efficiently manage and operate power supply systems.\nc. Lending Practices and Legal Issues\n17. At present, many outer island power supply systems are run by the communities through\nIDCs, or NGOs such as clubs and associations.  Although these groups are generally accepted\nby the communities, they are not legal entities and there is confusion about ownership of the\nassets and liabilities. Furthermore, currently no laws in the Maldives recognize IDCs, island\ncommunities, or island community groups as legal entities. Nevertheless, it is common practice\nfor the Government or the Bank of Maldives to lend to island community groups such as IDCs\nfor development purposes. Such loans are provided by the Bank of Maldives with a government\nguarantee. In the case of loans from the Government's revolving Treasury Fund, island chiefs\nare required to acknowledge receipt of loans on behalf of the island communities. IDCs and\ninformal island groups are also able to obtain small commercial loans for capital investments.\nExcept for a few rare cases, the Government or the Bank of Maldives has not had problems with\nloan repayment by the island communities.\n18. The  Government,  however,  wishes  to  ensure  that  island  communities  are  legally\naccountable for using and repaying the loans as well as for the power supply. The Government\nconsiders it important to legalize these power supply utilities so as to effectively regulate them\nas well as to instill a culture of accountability and self-governance in island communities.\n19. The Government has considered various options of legalizing the outer island power\nsupply  utilities  under  current  Maldivian  law,  in  particular  the  Companies  Act  (10/96).  It\nconcluded that the existing legal framework could not be applied to achieve the objectives of\ncommunity ownership and involvement, without significant distortion of the intents and purposes\nof the Companies Act. The Government therefore decided to prepare new legislation to provide\nfor legal electricity cooperatives to be established on the outer islands following the community-\nbased approach, or amend the existing laws to permit recognition of IDCs and other island\ncommunity groups as legal entities. Where an existing electricity supplier is a private company\nlegally established under the Companies Act and the island community prefers, the private\ncompany may continue to supply electricity on that island.", "6\nd. Sector Regulation\n20. In January 1998, the Government established MEB to succeed the regulatory part of the\nMaldives Electricity Board and gave it responsibility for establishing the standards of electricity\nsupply, regulating the electricity service providers, and setting tariffs. It has an immense task,\nconsidering the widely dispersed geography of the country and the need for qualified people to\nprepare the regulatory codes and standards, inspect, and test equipment and site, and regulate\nelectricity tariffs. Yet, MEB has only a skeleton staff and its current operational practices are\nadhoc and informal. There is no national regulatory code and standards for electricity supply,\nleading to poor safety and quality standards of power supply systems, particularly in the outer\nislands. Further, MEB needs to develop more comprehensive pricing principles for setting tariffs.\nStrengthening MEB and establishing a national code and standards for electricity supply are the\nGovernment's priorities.\n21. The safety standards in distribution networks and house wiring in the outer islands are\nbeing compromised due to lack of skilled people to inspect and test the equipment and sites.\nEach island chief is expected to assist MEB in ensuring that MEB regulations are complied with,\nwhile at the same time he is in charge of the IDC that may be operating the electricity supply\nutility.  Given the conflicting obligations and responsibilities, it is often impossible to enforce the\nMEB  regulations  properly.  It  is  therefore  important  that  at  least  one  electrical  inspector\nrepresenting MEB be stationed in most of the atolls. This would enable MEB to encourage and\nenforce compliance with its regulations in the islands. In some locations, an electrical inspector\nmay be shared between atolls.\ne. Environmental Protection\n22. All the islands in the Maldives are built entirely of coral, and land area never exceeds 13\nkm2. The maximum elevation is not more than 2-3 meters above sea level, making the country\nvulnerable to sea level rise. The Maldives has a special stake in the debate over global warming\nfrom greenhouse gases and consequent sea level rise. It is expected that introducing renewable\nenergy  technologies  such  as  solar  photovoltaics  (PV)  and  windmills  would  contribute  to\nenvironmental conservation.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n23. The Government identified the national objectives in its development plans: (i) securing\nsustainable improvements in living standards and the quality of life of the population by pursuing\nappropriate  growth  strategies;  (ii)  ensuring  that  regional  and  atoll  development  address\ndisparities  and  access  to  natural  resources,  employment  and  income,  housing  and\ninfrastructure,  and  education  and  health  services;  and  (iii)  ensuring  that  the  benefits  of\ndevelopment are shared in a balanced manner among the population and address the hardship\nand  vulnerability  of  the  dispersed  island  communities.  The  Government  has  found  it  too\nexpensive to develop adequate infrastructure on all 200 inhabited islands. Some of those\nislands are small, have high transportation costs, and often are difficult to access during bad\nweather. The Government has thus launched policies aimed at encouraging the population to\nconsolidate on a smaller number of islands. In this context, the Government selected 97 focus\nislands considering their administrative importance, population, and potential for development,\nand decided to concentrate available resources on these focus islands for their accelerated\ndevelopment,  thus  reducing  the  high  costs  of  developing  and  maintaining  the  social  and\nphysical infrastructure for a highly dispersed population. The focus islands include atoll capitals\nthat  are  seen  as  the  fundamental  units  for  delivering  basic  infrastructure  and  associated\nservices,  regional  service  centers  and  regional  urban  growth  centers,  which  are  being", "7\ndeveloped to meet employment needs and to serve the expanding population of the surrounding\ncatchment areas.\n24. The Government recognizes that providing reliable and efficient electricity supply in the\nouter islands will contribute to the national development objectives by reducing the disparities in\nservices  among  the  islands  and  the  vulnerability  of  the  outer  island  populations.  The\nGovernment has therefore given high priority to improved electrification in the outer islands, and\nprepared a Sector Policy on Outer Islands Electrification in June 2001. The aim is to establish\nthe financial viability of the outer island power supply utilities and place them on a new and\nsound footing.\n25.  The sector policy stipulates the policy for cost recovery, tariff settings, and financial\nassistance for the costs of electricity supply in the outer islands. To facilitate upgrading of the\npower supply systems in the outer islands, the Government, under this policy, may provide soft\nterm  loans  with  lower  than  commercial  interest  rates,  longer  than  commercial  repayment\nperiods, and longer grace periods on repayments. The sector policy further stipulates that the\ntariff structures and levels will be determined based on full cost recovery or at least a cash\nbreakeven principle.  When such tariffs are not affordable to consumers in an island where\nelectricity is supplied by a well-operated power supply utility,9 the Government may inject equity\nthrough cash or capital subsidy. Customs duties for equipment to be imported for electrification\nin the outer islands may be reduced. However, reduced customs duties will not apply to diesel\nfuel, nor will the O&M costs be subsidized.\n26. The  Government  has  established  investment  strategies  and  priorities  to  improve\nelectricity supply in the outer islands on an affordable and sustainable basis. Of the 97 focus\nislands, 75 were identified for improvement of electricity supply over the next five years. These\nidentified islands exclude those where the electricity supply is provided by STELCO, and other\nislands for which the Government has prior plans for development. As STELCO is capable of\nself-financing to augment and expand supply in its islands, no foreign aid is considered for those\nislands. The proposed Project will concentrate on the 75 focus islands.\n27. The sector policy also highlights the importance of strengthening sector entities including\nimplementing agencies, island power supply utilities, and the sector regulator to build their\ncapacities in long-term development planning and management of power supply systems in the\nouter islands. Following the incorporation of the utility part of the Maldives Electricity Board as\nSTELCO under the Companies Act in 1997, the Government looks to the establishment of legal\nentities  in  the  outer  islands  to  own  and  operate  the  power  supply  systems,  aimed  at\nstrengthening the accountability of the outer island power supply utilities. The Government also\nseeks to strengthen the institutional capacity of MEB to regulate the standards for electricity\nsupply in the Maldives, while continuing to explore the possibility of making the regulator an\nautonomous body.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n28. ADB is by far the main contributor to the power sector extending four loans totaling\n$24.7 million and seven TAs totaling $1.5 million to help meet the electricity requirements in\nMal\u00e9 and to strengthen the sector institutions. The Third Power System Development Project10\nhas been designed to increase generating capacity in Mal\u00e9 by 12 megawatts (MW), to serve the\n                  \n9 A well-operated power supply utility can be defined by parameters such as staffing ratios, distribution losses,\ngeneration efficiency, and billing and collection efficiency.\n10Loan 1532-MLD(SF), for $7.0 million, approved on 9 September 1997.", "8\nrapidly growing electricity demands there and to strengthen management and develop the\nhuman resources of STELCO.  Details of ADB\u2019s assistance in the power sector are in Appendix\n2.\n29. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has helped to provide electricity to\nsome outer islands through its three-phase Atoll Island Electrification Project, which started in\n1993 and was completed in 2000. The total cost of phases 1 and 2 was $10.8 million equivalent\nand phase 3, $6.9 million equivalent. The Nordic Development Fund is also supporting the\ndevelopment  of  the  power  sector  by  cofinancing  with  ADB  the  Third  Power  System\nDevelopment Project in the amount of $5.6 million equivalent for construction of two new 6 MW\ndiesel generating units in Mal\u00e9, which are to be commissioned in 2002.\nD. Lessons Learned\n30. To  date,  ADB  assistance  to  the  Maldives  has  largely  focused  on  infrastructure\ndevelopment in the power and port sectors in Mal\u00e9 and, more recently, in postsecondary\neducation and regional development through both infrastructure investment and institutional\nsupport. In general, the Maldives has made good use of ADB assistance and has demonstrated\nsatisfactory absorptive capacity.  Of the six completed projects, five have been postevaluated.\nAll,  except  the  first  project,11  were  rated  generally  successful.  Compliance  with  the  loan\ncovenants  on  social  and  environmental  measures  has  been  generally  satisfactory.  ADB\nassistance to the port sector improved the cargo-handling capacity of Mal\u00e9 port and helped to\nreduce  the  bottlenecks  that  delayed  transshipment  of  goods  between  Mal\u00e9  and  the  outer\nislands.  ADB assistance to the power sector helped to satisfy the demand for electricity in Mal\u00e9\nin a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable manner.  ADB assistance in both power and\nport sectors contributed to improved financial management, operational efficiency, economic\ngrowth, and productivity.\n31. Although past ADB projects were generally successful, the project experiences indicate\nthat most of the line ministries continue to have limited absorptive capacity due to scarcity of\nskilled and experienced staff. Delays in project implementation occurred primarily in the initial\nphases of appointing consultants and awarding contracts. To address this matter, it is essential\nto strengthen implementation capacity and provide long-term training for project staff in the\nrelevant institutions and agencies. The Government will ensure the availability of consultants\nwith  appropriate  skills,  involvement  of  island  communities  through  adequate  awareness\ncampaigns. ADB will carry out close monitoring and supervision. Direct beneficiaries will be\ninvolved - from decision making to design and construction - to enhance the sense of ownership\nand sustainability of the Project. To avoid the initial delays, the Government has established the\nproject management unit, appointed the project manager for the Project, and identified the\nislands to be considered in the first phase of the Project. ADB has also allowed advance action\nfor recruiting consultants.\n32. JICA's experience with its Atoll Island Electrification Project (para. 29) was positive. The\nproject improved the quality and reliability of power supply in the selected islands, promoted the\nestablishment of industries such as small-scale garment factories, and improved the quality of\nlife of the people in the islands through, among others, increased studying hours of students at\nnight, reduced workload for women owing to the increased use of electrical appliances, and\nincreased use of entertainment equipment. The power supply systems built under the project\nwere also evaluated as technically and financially sustainable.\n                  \n11Loan 513-MLD(SF): Interisland Transport Project, for $1 million, approved on 18 June 1981. This Project had major\ndesign flaws and was rated unsuccessful.", "9\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n33. The  overarching  objective  of  ADB's  Medium-Term  Strategic  Framework  is  poverty\nreduction. This objective is supported by specific thematic priorities to guide ADB's operation in\nthe medium term, e.g., supporting sustainable economic growth; developing human resources;\nprotecting  the  environment;  encouraging  private  sector  development;  and  promoting  good\ngovernance, gender in development, and regional cooperation. Under this framework, ADB's\nlending mix in the Maldives is geared toward balanced economic growth by directly addressing\ninequities and supporting social and economic development in regions outside Mal\u00e9.\n34. ADB\u2019s current country operational strategy (COS) for the Maldives was prepared in\n1995. It reoriented ADB operations away from improvement of physical infrastructure in Mal\u00e9\n(port  and  power  facilities)  and  toward  support  for  sustainable  regional  development,\nenvironmental protection, human development, and strengthening of public sector management.\nA high priority for ADB assistance is regional development across atolls to help achieve a more\nequitable and cost-effective distribution of basic economic and social services and to help ease\nthe substantial population pressures on Mal\u00e9. In 1999, ADB approved the Regional Development\nProject,12 its first project focusing on institutional support and basic infrastructure and services to\nestablish regional growth centers. The proposed Project is the second to be processed under\nCOS, which fully supports regional development.\n35. ADB is in the process of developing a new country strategy for the Maldives with a clear\nfocus on poverty reduction. The Maldives Country Strategy and Program Update (July 2001)\nstipulates that ADB will continue to assist in (i) regional development including providing basic\ninfrastructure and capacity building, (ii) creating an enabling environment for private sector\ndevelopment, and (iii) developing an information and communication network in the atolls.\n36. The previous ADB loans and TAs in the power sector provided assistance to meet the\nelectricity demands in Mal\u00e9 and to develop STELCO. Consequently, electricity supply in Mal\u00e9\nhas been substantially improved and STELCO has become a profitable and financially sound\nentity. Future development of the electricity supply in Mal\u00e9 will no longer require foreign aid.\nConsistent with the Government's national development plans and ADB's poverty reduction\nstrategy, ADB has shifted its sector focus to rural electrification in the outer islands, which have\nlagged in development.\n37. One of ADB's sector strategies is to develop and strengthen the sector institutions.\nADB's earlier projects have assisted STELCO with strengthening management and developing\nhuman  resources. While STELCO has made significant progress in institutional development,\nelectricity utilities running power supply systems in the outer islands and the sector regulator still\nneed much improvement. The proposed Project will aim to build the capacity of the sector\nregulator as well as the outer islands power supply utilities. ADB also recognizes the need for\ndeveloping environmentally sustainable energy resources in the county and will explore the\npossibility of introducing renewable energy technologies that can contribute to environmental\nconservation.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n38. ADB has assumed a leading role in policy dialogue in the power sector. Policy dialogue\nin the sector began in 1987 when a TA was approved to assist with improving the then Maldives\nElectricity  Board.  Following  the  recommendations  from  the  TA,  incorporating  the  Maldives\nElectricity  Board  was  identified  as  critical  in  promoting  more  efficient  and  independent\n                  \n12Loan 1695-MLD(SF): for $8.0 million, approved on 2 September 1999.", "10\nmanagement and enabling the board to operate commercially. Subsequently, the Government\nrecognized the need for improved sector efficiency and committed itself to further reform of the\npower sector. ADB continued its policy dialogue on reforming the Maldives Electricity Board and\nbuilding the capacity of sector entities. Pursuant to the detailed description of the power sector\nreform included in the final report of a follow-up TA, the Government converted the utility part of\nthe  Maldives  Electricity  Board  into  STELCO  in  1997  under  the  new  Companies  Act,  and\nconverted the regulatory part into MEB in January 1998. Overall, ADB's policy dialogue has\nhelped  to  meet  the  demand  for  electricity  in  Mal\u00e9  in  a  cost-effective  and  environmentally\nacceptable manner, and the impact of its assistance on policy and institutional changes has\nbeen  significant,  contributing  to  improved  financial  management,  operational  efficiency,\neconomic growth, and productivity of the sector institutions.\n39. Subsequent to the cited achievements in the power sector, the principal areas of policy\ndialogue between ADB and the Government have focused on (i) equitable development to\nreduce poverty; (ii) providing the outer island populations with electricity supply in a sustainable\nand affordable manner; (iii) promoting private sector participation and cost recovery; and (iv)\npromoting use of renewable sources of energy to protect the environment. All these will be\npursued in the context of regional development, to ensure a more equitable distribution of\neconomic benefits through broad-based growth and subsequently to reduce the population\npressures on Mal\u00e9. The cost recovery policy is based on beneficiaries' paying for the costs. The\npolicy on private sector participation is to encourage the island community-based organizations\nto own and manage island power supply utilities.\n40. Regulating and supervising public utilities such as electricity and water supply are of\nparticular concern as utility services spread beyond Mal\u00e9 to the less accessible outer islands,\nand all sector regulators are constrained by limited human and financial resources. The sector\nregulators continue to have weak internal management systems and limited ability to regulate\npublic  utilities  appropriately.  While  ADB  will  work  with  the  Government  for  immediate\nstrengthening of the existing regulatory framework for the power sector to effectively regulate\nthe electricity service providers, it will also assist the Government to study the establishment of\na single apex body that can regulate and supervise multiple public utilities.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n41.  Power supply systems in most of the outer islands have been developed on an adhoc\nbasis and unprofessionally by the island communities. The results are an unreliable supply, low\nefficiency, poor quality, and high costs. Although most of the island populations are connected\nto some form of electricity, the poor and unreliable electricity supply has constrained economic\nand social development in the outer islands. This has led to considerable disparities between\nMal\u00e9 and the outer islands. The provision of reliable, affordable, and efficient electricity supply in\nthe outer islands is essential to reduce the disparities among the islands, and to reduce poverty\nand improve the quality of life of the outer island populations.\n42. The project preparatory TA report concluded that diesel generation is the least-cost\noption in the outer islands and that other renewable energy technologies aside from solar PV\npower and windmill power are not promising in the medium term.  The TA report also studied in\nsubstantial detail the feasibility of generating electricity using renewable energy from wind and\nPV, which would be integrated with diesel generation. However, generating power using these\nforms of renewable energy would be very costly, with average costs of more than $1.00 per\nkWh for delivered electricity.  For this Project, a grant financing from the Global Environment", "11\nFacility (GEF) was sought for the hybrid pilot renewable energy projects comprising PV-diesel\nand wind-diesel as well as a set of barrier removal initiatives that are expected to enhance the\nadoption of renewable energy technologies.  This project concept was accepted by GEF and\nentered in the GEF pipeline for grant financing.  There was also some concern that perhaps the\nproject costs and benefit estimates of the renewable energy technologies included in the TA\nmight have been too conservative. Therefore, the findings of the TA were reviewed by another\nset of independent staff consultants engaged for fact-finding and appraisal. It was confirmed\nthat electricity generation in the outer islands through PV and windmill is not economically viable\nat  present,  even  when  such  projects  are  replicated  in  large  numbers.    The  cost  of  such\nrenewable energy would be about 10 times the alternative fuel cost of electricity generation from\ndiesel generator sets. Sensitivity tests indicate that this remains uneconomic even if fuel oil\nprices increase more than 5 times, or if the carbon emission \u201ctax\u201d or indirect cost increases\nmore than 100 times. Although generating electricity with windmill has proved feasible and\naffordable in some countries in the world, it will be very costly due to the small size of the wind\nturbine units required and the relatively low average wind speeds in the Maldives. Solar PV\nelectricity supply is generally feasible only for very small loads or for isolated users who have no\naccess to a local community-based power supply, but it is still much more costly than diesel\npower supply in the outer islands. This evaluation and sensitivity analysis are described in more\ndetail in Appendix 3. Based on the above analysis, all generation capacity to be added under\nthe Project will be diesel-based.\n43. Poor power system management skills, coupled with lack of specialized utility financial\nmanagement and professional engineering skills for planning, design, construction supervision,\nand O&M have been a major obstacle to developing sustainable power supply systems in the\nouter islands.  The demand for electricity in the outer islands has rapidly increased due to strong\neconomic growth. This trend, which is expected to continue in the future, will place a major\nburden on the human resources of the power sector, particularly in the outer islands. The\nproposed Project aims to build the capacity of power supply utilities in the outer islands, which is\nessential to maintain the sustainability of their power supply systems. Building the capacity of\nother  agencies  involved  under  the  Project  and  the  electricity  sector  regulator  is  equally\nimportant for successful completion of the Project and proper regulation of power supply utilities.\n44. The Project also seeks to bring a new dimension into the power sector in the outer\nislands by encouraging community accountability for and ownership of power supply systems,\nwhile  maintaining  participation  of  the  island  communities.  The  Project  will  support  the\nGovernment's efforts by providing legal advisory services to prepare new legislation for creating\nlegal electricity cooperatives, or amend the existing laws to provide for recognition of IDCs and\nother island community groups as legal entities.\n45. A sector loan is proposed for the Project. ADB has reviewed the power sector in the\nouter islands and is satisfied that the Government's sector policies are generally sound and\nmerit support. The Executing Agency and the Implementing Agency are suitable agencies for a\nsector loan and the relevant criteria for providing a sector loan are met.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n46. The long-term objective of the Project is to achieve balanced economic growth and\nequitable regional development and thereby reduce poverty and vulnerability of the selected\nouter islands and also reduce the significant population pressures on Mal\u00e9. The immediate\npurposes of the Project are to (i) improve electricity supply in the outer islands on a sustainable\nand affordable basis; (ii) build the capacity of sector entities; and (iii) strengthen the legal\nframework for the devolution of responsibilities to the outer island electricity suppliers and the\nrecognition of community groups, such as IDCs, NGOs, clubs, and associations.", "12\n47. The Project comprises the following components:\n1. Part A: Expand and Augment Power Supply to the Outer Islands\n(i)  Expand and augment power supply systems in about 40 non-STELCO\nfocus islands13 to serve about 8,500 households with 45,000 people.\n(ii)  Provide implementation assistance for engineering and project design,\npreparation  of  subproject  appraisal  reports,  procurement  and  contract\nawarding, and construction supervision as well as build the capacity of\nrelated government ministries for project management.\n2. Part B: Build the Capacity of Sector Institutions\n(i)  Strengthen MEB by assisting it to establish a clear mission statement,\ndevelop its professional capacity, establish safety and quality standards\nof electricity supply, set operational procedures for enforcing safety and\nquality  standards,  and  develop  comprehensive  pricing  principles  for\nsetting tariffs.\n(ii)  Strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National\nDevelopment (MPND) to carry out benefit and poverty monitoring and\nevaluation (BPME).\n3. Part C: Strengthen the Legal Framework for Island Power Supply Utilities\n(i)  Provide legal advisory services to the Attorney General's Office (AGO) for\ndeveloping a legal framework for island power supply utilities and/or for\ncooperatives, and/or for recognition of community groups.\n(ii)  Train  concerned  agencies  in  cooperatives  and  their  operation  and\nmanagement, and cooperatives law.\n48. In addition, ADB will continue to explore the possibility of a component to be funded by\nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) to enhance the poverty reduction impacts of the\nProject.  In  October  2001,  the  Government  submitted  a  proposal  to  ADB  for  the  JFPR\ncomponent, describing the type of support the Government needs, the estimated costs of such\nsupport, and how the Government intends to implement the JFPR component. ADB is reviewing\nthis proposal and will process the JFPR component under a schedule separate from that of\nother components of the Project, while maintaining conceptual linkage with the Project.\nC. Cost Estimates\n49. The total project cost is estimated to be $10.6 million equivalent, of which $7.6 million\n(71.7 percent) is the foreign exchange cost and $3.0 million equivalent (28.3 percent) the local\ncurrency  cost.  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  2001  price  levels  for  base  costs  and\ncontingencies, and a duty rate of 12.5 percent on imported equipment. Cost of land is not\nincluded in the cost estimates as there is no private land ownership in the country and all lands\n                  \n13No STELCO islands will be included under the Project since STELCO is deemed capable of independent funding\nto expand and augment its own power supply systems.", "13\nbelong to the Government.

Financing Plan\n50. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. ADB will finance about 76 percent of the\ntotal cost of the Project including all the foreign exchange costs and a minor portion of the local\ncurrency costs. The Government will finance the rest of the local current costs and provide\npublic land if required for expanding or building powerhouses.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percentage\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Share\nAsian Development Bank 7.6 0.4 8.0 75.5\nGovernment 0.0 2.6 2.6 24.5\nTotal 7.6 3.0 10.6 100.0\n51. It is proposed that ADB extend a loan of $8.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds\nresources. The loan maturity will be 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. An annual\ninterest rate is 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The\nBorrower, the Republic of Maldives, will bear the foreign exchange risk. The cost of each\nisland's power supply system, excluding the costs of consulting services, will be treated as a\nsubsidiary  loan  from  the  Borrower  to  the  relevant  island.  Re-lending  terms  comprise  an\namortization period of 12 years including a 4-year grace period and an interest rate of 8 percent\nper annum.14  Islands may choose to borrow with a shorter grace period or shorter amortization\nperiod.  The Bank of Maldives will be responsible for collecting the loan repayments, with a fixed\nadministrative fee of Rf100 per loan per month, pursuant to a separate agreement between\nMinistry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) and the Bank of Maldives. Among other things, the\nsubsidiary loan documentation will provide that the Borrower will have a lien on the power\nsupply systems until the full payment of the subsidiary loans to the Borrower.\n                  \n14Re-lending terms are determined by considering the current practice, economic lifetime of the equipment, risks and\ncosts of the loan to the Government, and affordability to the subborrowers.", "14\n52. At  present,  many  outer  island  power  supply  utilities  are  not  legal  entities.  The\nGovernment  has  assured  that  within  nine  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  it  will  submit  the\nproposed  legislation  addressing  the  formation  of  legal  outer  island  power  supply  utilities\n(cooperatives law or amendment of existing laws) to its Parliament for approval. In the event of\ndelayed passage of the law, and given that there is no history of outer island communities\ndefaulting on their financial obligations, the Government will continue with its current lending\npractice.  However,  ADB  will  require  that  the  Government  sign  agreements  with  island\nrepresentatives for repayment of the subsidiary loans. Upon the passage of the proposed law,\nthe Government will require legal power supply utilities (cooperatives or other form) to be\nestablished, and for the agreements to be transferred to the established legal power supply\nutilities as soon as practicable.\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Execution\n53. MOFT will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project and will be responsible for\noverall coordination of the Project, including approval of all disbursements. MAA will be the\nImplementing  Agency  (IA).  Day-to-day  implementation  will  be  carried  out  by  the  project\nmanagement unit (PMU), which has been established under MAA and headed by the full-time\nproject manager, who has been appointed. MEB will supervise the activities for strengthening\nMEB, and MPND the activities for the institutional strengthening of BPME. AGO will supervise\nthe legal advisory services under the Project for strengthening the legal framework and will be\nresponsible  for  preparing  legislation  to  establish  legal  island  power  supply  utilities,  and/or\nrecognize island community groups as legal entities. MAA, MPND, and MOFT will be jointly\nresponsible for submitting the draft legislation to the Parliament for its approval.\n54. A project coordinating committee (PCC), chaired by MAA, will guide the PMU and assist\nwith interagency coordination of activities. The members of the PCC are senior officials and staff\nmembers representing MOFT, MAA, MPND, MEB, AGO, and STELCO. The Ministry of Home\nAffairs, Housing and Environment (MHHE) is also part of the PCC. Appendix 5 gives the\norganization chart of project implementation and management.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n55. The  implementation  schedule  of  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  6.  Advance  action  for\nrecruiting the consultants started in October 2001 and the Project will be completed by June\n2005.\n3. Planning and Appraising Subprojects under Part A\n56. With the help of the implementation consultants, MAA will prepare subproject appraisal\nreports for each of the selected islands in three batches of about 12-15 islands each. The plan\nfor each subproject will be made in close consultation with the island communities, and must be\nendorsed by the representatives of the island and approved by the Government, before it is\nsubmitted to ADB in an acceptable format for review and approval. In selecting the islands,\nspecial consideration will be given to islands with a high incidence of income poverty and\nvulnerability.  MAA  will  be  required  to  secure  ADB's  approval  before  implementing  the\nsubprojects. Each subproject appraisal report will contain full details including (i) recommended\nsubproject development plan; (ii) design (at tender level) of the subproject and detailed cost\nestimates; (iii) implementation schedule and implementation arrangements; (iv) economic and\nfinancial  analyses;  (v)  proposed  level  of  tariffs  and  assessment  of  affordability;  (vi)\nenvironmental examination; (vii) socioeconomic survey results including population, household", "15\nincome  distribution,  and  electricity  uses;  and  (viii)  proposed  structure  of  the  outer  island\nelectricity suppliers, and relevant supporting documentation. Subprojects submitted to ADB for\napproval must have an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of a minimum 10 percent. In\ncase land allocation is required for subproject construction, the subproject appraisal report must\ninclude confirmation that no resettlement of people or impact on livelihood is involved as well as\nproof of approval from appropriate authorities for the allocation of government-owned land. The\nprocedures for subproject planning, selection, appraisal, and approval are described in detail in\nAppendix 7.\n4. Procurement\n57. Goods and services financed by the Project will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement.  Bid  specifications  will  be  prepared  in  a  manner  to  ensure  maximum\ncompetition under international competitive bidding and maximum use of local labor. To ensure\neconomy of scale and maximum efficiency, all contract packages will be awarded on a turnkey\nbasis  for  the  three  batches  of  subprojects.  These  contracts,  which  will  be  awarded  and\nadministered by MAA on behalf of the participating island communities, will include design,\nconstruction, testing, and commissioning of the power supply systems. A list of the contract\npackages with their cost estimates is attached as Appendix 8.\n5. Consulting Services\n58. About 30 person-months of international and 93 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices  required  for  the  Project  will  be  provided  under  two  separate  consulting  services\ncontracts. An international consulting firm, which will be encouraged to associate with domestic\nconsultants, will be recruited to assist with parts A and B of the Project, and a domestic legal\nconsultant will be recruited to assist with part C.  MAA, in coordination with MEB and MPND, will\nrecruit the international consulting firm for parts A and B; AGO, in consultation with MOFT, will\nengage the domestic legal consultant for part C. All consultants will be recruited and engaged in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.   AGO will provide ADB with a shortlist\nof  consultants  for  its  review,  and  will  follow  the  Government's  recruitment  procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n59. Consulting  services  for  parts  A  and  B  are  needed  to  (i)  assist  MAA  with  detailed\nengineering  and  project  design;  preparing  subproject  appraisal  reports;  preparing  bid\ndocuments,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract  awards;  supervising  installation,  testing,  and\ncommissioning; training island power supply utilities in O&M of electricity supply systems; and\nthe building capacity of related government agencies for project management; (ii) strengthen\nMEB  by  establishing  a  clear  mission  statement;  developing  its  professional  capacity;\nestablishing safety and quality standards of electricity supply; setting operational procedures for\nenforcing safety and quality; and developing comprehensive pricing principles for setting tariffs;\nand (iii) assist MPND in BPME.  Consulting services for part C are needed to assist AGO with\npreparing legislation to develop an appropriate legal framework to support the establishment of\nlegally  recognized  power  supply  utilities  in  the  outer  islands.  The  terms  of  reference  for\nconsulting services are given in Appendix 9.\n6. Advance Action on Recruitment of Consultants\n60. The timely recruitment of consultants is critical to the success of the Project. To minimize\nfront-end delays in implementation, the Government requested ADB to approve advance action\nfor recruitment of consultants. The Government has been allowed to initiate advance action for\nrecruiting consultants to be financed by ADB under the Project. The Government was also", "16\nadvised that approval of such advance recruitment action will not in any way commit ADB to\napprove the Project or to retroactively finance any costs incurred by the Government.\n7. Disbursement Procedures\n61. MOFT, as the EA, will be responsible for vetting and coordinating all disbursements for\nthe Project. Disbursements will be for consulting services as well as supply and installation of\nelectricity supply equipment and accessories.  Therefore, ADB's commitment procedures and\ndirect payment procedures will be used.\n8. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n62.   MOFT will have overall responsibility for timely submission of reports to ADB, and will\nensure that each of the agencies involved meets the requirements.  MAA, in coordination with\nMEB, MPND, and AGO, will prepare regular progress reports for the Project and submit them to\nADB on a quarterly basis.  The reports, which will be submitted within 30 days from the end of\neach quarter, will include a description of physical progress, a summary of project receipts and\nexpenditures during the period, year to date, and total to date. A detailed list indicating the\namount  received  by  each  island  power  supply  utility  during  the  reporting  period  must  be\nattached to the progress reports.\n63. MAA will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project. The project statement\nof receipts and expenditures will be audited annually by the Auditor General of the Government.\nMAA will submit to ADB copies of the audited accounts within nine months after the end of the\nfiscal year to which they relate. A project completion report covering the entire project will be\nsubmitted by MAA to ADB within three months after project completion. MPND will submit a final\nBPME report to ADB within three months of project completion. MEB, MPND, and AGO will\nprovide MAA with their respective reports when so requested.\n64. Each island power supply utility covered under the Project will maintain satisfactory\naccounting records that can generate regular management reports. Each utility will also prepare\nannual statements of income and expenditure, and assets and liabilities, and submit them to\nMAA within six months after the end of each fiscal year. MAA will review the annual statements\nand tabulate them for submission to ADB within nine months after the end of each fiscal year,\ntogether with a summary report highlighting the major achievements or failures of the island\npower  supply  utilities  in  the  fiscal  year.  MAA  will  also  submit  to  ADB  annual  reports  on\nenvironmental requirements within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, including (i) a copy\nof environmental and safety permits, licenses, or clearances; (ii) compliance with environmental\nrequirements; (iii) violations, if any, of environmental requirements; and (iv) certifications of\napproval for corrective actions, or approved plans of correction, if any.\nF. Agencies Involved\n1. Ministry of Atolls Administration\n65. MAA, the IA for the Project, is responsible for supervising the atoll and island offices,\nhandling all developmental activities, and upholding law and order in the outer islands. Its\nfunctions include the following:\n(i) Provide instructions to the atoll and island chiefs, administer all matters\nrelating to Government land in the atolls, deal with any matters relating to\nthe atolls, and work toward economic and social development of atolls;", "17\n(ii) Organize, manage, and implement projects for planning and developing\nislands and regions selected for relevant development plans;\n(iii) Organize, facilitate, and coordinate the activities and services required for\nthe growth of islands and regions selected for development; and\n(iv) Allocate land in the atolls.\n66. The  PMU  has  been  established  under  Sector  G  of  MAA,  which  is  responsible  for\nplanning, executing and evaluating projects. At present, it has a staff of 28, a number of whom\nwere trained in project management. It also has extensive project management experience in\nthe  outer  islands,  and  has  specific  experience  in  managing  electrification  projects  utilizing\nSTELCO skills. Although the Project is larger than MAA had previously handled, the presence of\nsuch a professional and experienced project management organization will be of considerable\nadvantage in implementing the Project.\n2. Ministry of Planning and National Development\n67. MPND compiles information relating to the population and other aspects relevant for the\ndevelopment program and reforms actions required for the drawing up of plans and projects for\nthe  country's  development  including  electrification.  Its  functions  include  (i)  formulating  the\npopulation policy of the country and determining the economic and social facilities and services\nthat the population requires, (ii) determining the industrial and residential zones of the country,\nand (iii) preparing and maintaining updated charts of the islands.\n3. Maldives Electricity Bureau\n68. MEB is responsible for regulating the standards for electricity supply in the Maldives.\nMEB\u2019s work can be summarized as follows:\n(i) Prepare engineering standards and regulatory codes and ensure that the\nelectricity service providers comply with the relevant regulations;\n(ii) Issue permits and licenses to potential electricity service providers and\nestablish principles for tariffs;\n(iii) Investigate  complaints  regarding  breaches  of  the  service  agreement\nbetween the customer and the service provider;\n(iv) Issue permits and licenses to electricians;\n(v) Regulate the standards of electricians and electrical consultants and the\nstandards of generators, materials, and accessories imported into the\ncountry;\n(vi) Create  an  awareness  of  the  need  for  reducing  electricity  use  and\nresearch and collect statistical information regarding the requirements,\nsupply, and consumption of energy in general and electricity in particular;\nand\n(vii) Take necessary action regarding electricity supply services pursuant to\nthe Public Utilities Act.", "18\n4. Attorney General's Office\n69. AGO was established to give legal advice on matters affecting the Government and to\nact on behalf of the Government in the courts, among others. Under the Project, AGO, with the\nassistance of the domestic legal adviser, will review the best possible option for the legal\nestablishment of outer island power supply utilities to meet these objectives: (i) creating in island\ncommunities a culture of community ownership of essential services such as electricity; (ii)\nmaximizing community participation in the design and O&M of their power supply systems; and\n(iii) fostering a culture of financial transparency and accountability. AGO will also draft relevant\nlegislation for the concerned government ministries to submit to the Parliament for approval.\n5. Outer Island Power Supply Utilities\na. General Description\n70. At present, outer island power supply utilities are STELCO, IDCs, NGOs, and private\noperators. Except in STELCO islands, electricity consumers in each outer island generally\nrange from 50 to 300 with typical installed generation capacities of 50 kW-150 kW on each\nisland. Most outer islands have no proper records or bookkeeping mainly due to lack of skills in\noperation and management of power supply systems. In most cases, they have very simple\nrecording  methods  for  sales  of  and  revenue  from  electricity,  but  there  is  little  record  on\ngeneration  and  operating  costs.  Furthermore,  costs  incurred  in  generating  electricity  are\nsometimes part of the overall budget of the island communities. Therefore, it is often difficult to\ndetermine the accurate cost of electricity supply in these islands. The Project will give training in\nbookkeeping and accounting skills to enable the islands to have basic skills in operation and\nfinancial management of the power supply systems.\nb. Financial Projections and Projected Tariffs\n71. Since it was impractical to survey all the islands that will participate in the Project, a\nrepresentative sample of eight islands15 was selected for the purpose of evaluation. As these\nislands had no proper past records, proforma financial projections up to 2010 were prepared for\nthe power supply utilities on the islands to see how the utilities would perform during and after\nthe  Project.  Of  the  eight  islands  reviewed,  Naalaafushi  and  Veyvah  were  considered  not\nappropriate for financing under the Project at this time since Naalaafushi has just installed a\nnew generating set and Veyvah is too small to economically justify the expansion of the power\nsupply system to a higher standard. Therefore, the financial projections are for the six remaining\nislands.  Major  assumptions  underlying  the  financial  projections  and  detailed  financial\nperformance of each of the six islands are given in Appendix 10.\n72. The current electricity supply in the outer islands is unreliable, and losses from both\ngenerators and distribution systems are high. As a result, the demand for electricity has been\nsuppressed, as consumers are not able to use their appliances as they wish. At present, many\nof the electricity providers in these islands are having financial difficulties despite the high tariffs\nof Rf3.5-Rf6.0 ($0.27-$0.47) per kWh. This compares with STELCO\u2019s general tariff levels of\nRf2.0-Rf4.0 ($0.16-$0.31) per kWh  in Mal\u00e9 and Rf2.5-Rf4.0 ($0.20-$0.31) per kWh  in its outer\nislands operation. Small systems need to charge high tariffs because small groups of customers\ncannot meet the costs of capital-intensive equipment. Due to high fuel costs, in many outer\nislands,  the  current  tariffs  are  sufficient  to  cover  only  operating  costs,  but  not  capital\nreplacement  or  financing  costs.    With  the  proposed  Project,  there  will  be  significant\nimprovements  in  quality  and  reliability  of  electricity  supply.  Further,  there  will  be  sufficient\n                  \n15Neykurendhoo, Nolhivaramu, Vaikaradhoo, Funadhoo, Mulah, Muli, Naalaafushi, and Veyvah.", "19\ncapacities to service the communities in the outer islands. The reduced distribution losses and\nenhanced efficiencies will reduce the operating costs and allow for some capital replacement.\n73. Given that each of the outer islands is responsible for its own cost and profitability, all\nare  required  to  set  their  own  tariffs  based  on  cash  breakeven  principle  at  the  minimum.\nCompared with the current tariffs, the projected tariffs with the proposed Project will be reduced\nin real terms in most islands.  Table 3 shows the current and projected tariffs in each of the\nrepresentative sample outer islands.\nTable 3: Current and Projected Tariffs for the Six Sample Islands\nIsland Current Tariff a Projected Projected Real Tariff for\n(Rf/kWh) Tariff for 2002 Tariff for 2006 b Change\n(Rf/kWh) 2006(Rf/kWh) (Rf/kWh) (percent)\nNeykurendhoo 5.00 5.00 6.40 5.01 +0.2\nVaikaradhoo 4.00 4.00 4.50 3.53 -11.8\nFunadhoo 4.00 4.00 4.25 3.33 -16.8\nNolhivaramu 6.00 4.50 5.00 3.92 -34.7\nMulic 4.00 4.00 4.50 3.53 -11.8\nMulahd 3.50 3.50 4.25 3.33 -4.9\na  Average tariffs in early 2001.\nb  Adjusted to price level for 2001.\nc  Rf2.5/kWh for the first 100 kWh consumed and Rf4.0/kWh afterwards.\nd  Mulah recently reduced the tariff to Rf3.5/kWh from Rf4.0/kWh.\n74. As the table shows, with the cash breakeven principle, most islands will have to maintain\ntheir tariffs for 2002 at present level, while Nolhivaramu can reduce the current tariff. In 2006,\nhowever, when the Project is fully completed and loan principal repayment starts, tariffs are\nexpected to increase gradually in current terms except in Nolhivaramu where the current tariff\nmay be reduced. In real terms, however, the projected tariffs in 2006 will be lower than the\ncurrent tariff level in most islands. The projected tariffs may seem high compared with electricity\ntariffs in neighboring countries; however, they are still considered affordable in the outer islands.\nThe survey conducted under the project preparatory TA revealed that the level of expenditure\non electricity for average income households ranges from 1.3 to 5.7 percent of their monthly\nincome. The poor, which generally consumes less than 10 kWh per month, spend an average of\n3-6 percent of their monthly income for electricity. These percentages are comparable with\nthose in other countries in the region.\n75. The financial projections show that the financial situation in all islands will improve, as\nthe proposed Project will reduce the high system losses and increase efficiency and thus result\nin increased profitability from higher sales volume and lower operating costs. With the projected\ntariffs, each island will be able to generate sufficient cash to cover its operating costs and to\nservice its debts (interest and loan repayments). In later years, when electricity demand is\nhigher and they can achieve some economies of scale, the islands could consider reducing their\ntariffs accordingly.\n76. Given the need for these islands to generate sufficient cash during their early years of\noperation, it was considered that they would be given a 4-year grace period to repay the loan\nprincipal, for a total repayment period of 12 years. The 12-year repayment period is consistent\nwith the average operating life of the assets (i.e., 7 years for generators and 20 years for\ndistribution systems). At present, some islands have received loans from the Bank of Maldives\nat 12 percent interest per annum (4 percent of which is subsidized by MAA), with only a 5-year\nrepayment period and a 6-month grace period.", "20\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental\n77. The Project is classified as environment category B. An initial environmental examination\n(IEE) was conducted for eight representative sample islands under the project preparatory TA.\nThe summary IEE (SIEE) is given in Appendix 11. The SIEE indicates that no significant\nadverse environmental impacts are associated with the Project, during either construction or\noperation. The Project will have a positive impact on the environment as the efficiency of diesel\nengines will be improved, and losses reduced; thus, the Project will lessen carbon and nitrous\noxide emissions. Further, the Project will fund bulk tanks, oil-handling facilities, fire-fighting\nequipment, and improved dispersal of exhaust gases and noise reduction to improve the safety\nand environmental standards of the power supply systems.  The Project will also finance the\nconstruction of new powerhouses for some islands, with better locations away from village\ncenters, and better noise insulation than in the existing buildings. During project implementation,\nan IEE will be prepared for each subproject for approval of MHHE.\n2. Social Measures\n78. A poverty dimension and social assessment (Appendix 12) was carried out as part of the\nproject preparatory TA and fact-finding.  Participatory consultations and a socioeconomic survey\nwere  conducted  with  the  intended  beneficiaries  and  key  relevant  stakeholders,  such  as\nGovernment agencies, NGOs, IDCs, and island women\u2019s committees (IWCs), and community\nrepresentatives. The Project has been designed such that it is responsive to the communities'\nneeds, will function on a sustainable basis, and will have no adverse social impacts. Social\nmeasures incorporated into the Project are designed to ensure that the project benefits are\nshared in a balanced manner among the population, and that the Project addresses equity\nconcerns by improving the standards of living, reducing the vulnerability of the populations in the\nouter islands, and ensuring that the electricity supply is affordable to the poor. In addition, the\nJFPR component will strengthen the poverty reduction impacts of the Project.\n79. The  Project  involves  no  resettlement  and,  if  land  is  required,  the  Government  will\nallocate lands that will not involve resettlement. Existing power station buildings will be used\nwherever possible. New powerhouses, if any, will be small, and for the most part will not require\nland exceeding 400 m2. There is no private land ownership in the country and all lands belong\nto the Government. The constitution and laws of the country give atoll chiefs the authority to\nallocate land up to 400 m2 for public use. Reflecting the importance ADB places on careful and\neffective  implementation  of  land  acquisition,  the  following  will  be  conditions  for  subproject\napproval: (i) confirmation that no resettlement of people or impact on livelihood is involved, and\n(ii) receipt from appropriate authorities of approval of the allocation of government-owned land.\nThe PMU will have overall responsibility for coordinating the implementation of land allocation.\n3. Benefit and Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation\n80. BPME is intended to monitor and measure the social and economic benefits of the\nProject that will permit postevaluation, and to also improve planning for future electrification\nprojects. It is the primary means of determining the extent to which projects address the need\nand demands of the beneficiaries; the efficiency and effectiveness of the project approach,\npolicies,  procedures;  and  overall  project  impacts.  To  maximize  transparency  and  public\naccountability,  BPME  will  involve  all  key  stakeholders,  including  IDCs,  IWCs,  and  other\nbeneficiaries, in designing and implementing the BPME. The indicators for monitoring, which will\nbe  developed  during  the  initial  stage  of  the  Project  through  participatory  assessment  and\nworkshops at the atoll and nation levels, will include (i) the number of connected consumers in", "21\nvarious categories versus the number of potential total consumers in those categories in an\nisland; (ii) average consumption rates for consumers in each category; (iii) tariff structures and\nlevels; (iv) technical losses of electricity supply; (v) description of new economic activities\ninduced by the Project and their estimated total value; (vi) estimates of average income levels\nbefore and after the Project; (vii) the perceived importance of various types of noneconomic\nbenefits created by the Project, such as improved quality of life and leisure activities, better\nenvironment  for  reading  and  study,  and  improved  health;  and  (viii)  poverty  status.  Before\nconstruction  in  the  subprojects,  a  baseline  survey  for  social,  economic,  and  poverty\nassessments will be carried out within the subproject area. Twelve islands in four atolls will be\nselected as sample areas in consideration of geographic balance. In addition, four non-Project\nislands in the same atolls will be selected as control areas. Benefits generated from the Project\nwill be measured against the baseline data and the control islands.\n4. Community Consultation\n81. During subproject preparation and implementation, there will be close consultations with\ncommunity  representatives  to  ensure  their  agreement  to  the  technical  design,  institutional\narrangements, and the required financial undertakings. Compliance with the regulations for\nelectricity supply is difficult because outer island populations lack understanding of the need to\ncomply with national regulations. Proper regulation of the quality and safety of power supply\nsystems in the outer islands may, in the short term, be best achieved by making the outer island\npopulations (particularly the directors and operators of power supply utilities) understand the\nneed  to  observe  national  electricity  supply  regulations,  codes,  and  standards.  A  series  of\nawareness campaigns will be conducted throughout the Project by MAA with assistance from\nthe consultants to ensure that the beneficiaries understand the situation.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses\n1. Project Basis\n82. The Project for electrification of the outer islands will expand power supply systems or, in\nsome cases, replace them completely on about 40 outer islands in the Maldives. This will\nprovide improved power supply to about 8,500 households with a total population of about\n45,000  people.  The  Project  also  supports  ADB's  policy  on  private  sector  development  by\nencouraging  the  participation  of  island  communities  and  attempting  to  instill  a  culture  of\naccountability  and  self-governance  in  outer  island  power  supply  utilities.  A  representative\nsample of six islands was selected for the economic evaluation of the Project. The islands were\nsurveyed in detail to determine the condition of their existing power supply systems and the\nexpected load growth, and to prepare plans for expansion. The islands that will participate in the\nProject are islands that are selected as focus islands under the Government's development plan\nfor the outer islands, but are not currently served by STELCO.  Typically, these islands will have\npopulations  between  300  and  1,500.  Smaller  islands  are  normally  not  included  under  the\ndevelopment focus program, and larger islands are in most cases already served by STELCO.\nTo participate in the sector loan for the Project, the development of power supply on each island\nmust be economically justified with an EIRR of at least 10 percent.\n83. The existing power supply systems on these islands are normally owned and operated\nby the local IDCs, NGOs, or small private companies. Practically all households on each island\nare connected to some form of electricity. Total installed generation capacities are typically 50\nkW to 150 kW at present.  Due to their inefficiency, high losses, and small size, average costs of", "22\nelectricity are high, with average tariffs of about Rf4.00 ($0.31) per kWh.  Most electricity is used\nfor  residential  purposes  -  lighting,  and  operation  of  television  sets,  radios,  fans,  washing\nmachines, and other electrical appliances.  However, electricity is not used for cooking, since it is\nmuch more costly than firewood or kerosene. Government offices and public services, such as\nschools and streetlights, are also significant electricity users. On the larger islands, there are\nalso commercial consumers.\n2. Least-Cost Power Supply Plans\n84. The distribution systems are in poor condition on most islands, with distribution losses of\n20-30 percent. Voltage levels at the ends of the line are also unsatisfactory during high load\nperiods. The plans for developing and expanding power supplies under the Project include\ncompletely  replacing  the  distribution  systems  in  cases  where  they  are  inefficient  and\ninadequate, or upgrading and expanding distribution as required to meet the load growth.  The\nProject will also replace inefficient diesel generating sets, and add new diesel generating sets\nas required to serve the load growth. Diesel-based systems are the most economic option for\nthese small power supply systems.\n3. Economic and Financial Evaluation\n85. For the economic analysis, the economic benefits of the Project are divided into two parts.\nThe first is the cost savings due to replacing inefficient generating units and distribution cables\nthat  have  inadequate  capacity.  The  change  will  improve  generation  efficiency,  and  reduce\ndistribution losses and operating costs for existing levels of sales. The second benefit is the\nadditional electricity sales arising from the Project due to future load growth. These additional\nsales  are  valued  in  the  economic  analysis  at  the  average  consumer  willingness  to  pay  for\nelectricity consumption. This average economic value was based on an electricity demand curve\nderived from data for various islands in the Maldives, and is estimated to be about 70-80 percent\nhigher than existing average tariff levels.\n86. The economic evaluation of each of the six islands selected for project evaluation is\ndescribed in Appendix 13. The overall Project has an estimated EIRR of 19.4 percent for the\nbase case. However, the economic evaluation of benefits is conservative, as no attempt was\nmade to evaluate the benefits of improved reliability and quality of power supply.\n87. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic performance of the Project is robust for\nlarge increases in fuel costs or capital costs. The Project can tolerate a doubling of crude oil\nprices and still remain economic. The project economics are most sensitive to reductions in\nestimated unit benefits. The Project would become uneconomic if average benefit rates for new\nsales is reduced more than 32 percent, based on a minimum 10 percent EIRR, or if total load\ngrowth is reduced by more than 30 percent.\n88. The financial evaluation assumes that tariffs will be set to achieve breakeven cost\nrecovery  (including  operating  costs  plus  debt-service  costs).  Figure  A13.2  in  Appendix  13\nillustrates the reductions in future tariff rates that are feasible and expected on this basis for\neach island. Over a period of time, average tariff levels on the six islands will be about 13\npercent lower in real terms by 2006.  With such future tariffs, the average financial internal rate\nof return (FIRR) for the overall Project is estimated to be 3.4 percent, which is more than the\nweighted  average  financial  cost  of  capital  of  2.8  percent  (in  real  terms)  for  the  Project.\nTherefore, the FIRR for this Project is satisfactory.", "23\nB. Social Dimensions\n89. A social assessment was conducted during project formulation. During the process,\ncomprehensive  consultations  with  beneficiaries  and  surveys  in  several  representative\nsubproject sites were carried out. There is agreement in all islands about the need for an\nimproved electricity supply although most populations in the outer islands are connected to\nsome form of electricity. A good electricity supply for 24 hours a day is a high priority for\nhouseholds with less than that. Where households already have 24 hours supply, the level of\ndesire for improvements is demonstrated by their stated willingness to spend more of their\nsavings for buying electrical appliances. Further evidence is shown by the considerable effort of\ncommunities  to  improve  their  electricity  supply  systems  through  communal  fund-raising\nactivities. This confirms the strong absorptive capacity of the island communities for the Project.\n90. The majority of the electricity consumers in the outer islands consume an average of\naround 25 kWh per month and consumption in the lowest quartile is 12 kWh per month. Those\nin the lowest quartile are generally able to pay for their level of consumption at around 5 percent\nor less of household income. Households currently using less than 10 kWh per month do not\nhave the ability to pay higher tariffs and have less resources to generate increased income from\nan improved electricity supply. The major benefit to these households will come from reduced\ntariffs as a result of improved efficiency. Based on the analysis of a representative sample of six\nislands, the overall tariff in real terms is expected to decline by about 13 percent by 2006.\n91. With  a  more  reliable  and  adequate  electricity  supply,  outer  island  communities  will\nreceive nonfinancial benefits as well. A reliable electricity supply will allow them to put electric\nlighting in schools or electric refrigerators in community health clinics, or to access electricity for\nlighting or for electrical appliances for household businesses. The Project is also expected to\nfacilitate the development of other basic infrastructure such as better health, education, and\ninformation communication facilities, and thereby improve access to and productivity in the labor\nmarket. With improved efficiency of the sector and the economy, the indirect effects of improved\naccess to electricity services will also be evident in the increase in total wealth and the release\nof more funds for other activities. The indirect effect will benefit the island populations both as\nmembers of society and as consumers.\n92. The survey of the sample islands shows that improved electricity supply will benefit\ngeneral family welfare, particularly of women.  Where there is sufficient disposable income for\nelectrical appliances, the increased use of flatirons and washing machines will relieve the\ndomestic workload of women. A reliable electricity supply will enable more home-based income-\ngenerating opportunities such as rope making in the evening. For higher income households,\nincreased availability of electricity will provide opportunities for increased household income\nthrough activities such as sewing, production of freezer goods, and computer and fax services.\nC. Impact on Poverty\n93. Poverty in the Maldives is largely shown by the regional disparities between Mal\u00e9 and\nthe outer islands. Despite the fact that macroeconomic indicators in recent years have recorded\nmarked improvement in the Maldives, the benefits of growth have not been equitably distributed\nto the populations. Furthermore, the decentralization of economic activities away from Mal\u00e9 has\nbeen hampered by lack of basic infrastructure and institutional capacities in the outer islands.\nThe Project supports the Government's policy to reduce poverty by improving electricity supply\nin the outer islands, which in turn will help to achieve balanced economic growth and equitable\nregional development.", "24\n94. One  of  the  underlying  objectives  of  the  Project  is  to  give  poor  households  and\ncommunities in the outer islands a reliable and adequate supply of electricity. The Project will\nhave important and direct effects on the poor through (i) easier establishment and increased\nproductivity of businesses that will employ the poor, (ii) creation of employment in infrastructure\nconstruction, (iii) improved health and education and savings in time and effort that will increase\nindividual productivity, and (iv) longer operating life of electrical appliances.\n95. The Project will directly benefit about 8,500 households with a population of 45,000 in\nabout 40 focus islands. Although income poverty exists everywhere in the country, certain\nislands have a concentration of the poor.  The VPA report shows that 26 percent of the income\npoor are located on 20 islands, and 8 of the focus islands to be considered under the Project\nare within the group of the 20 poorest islands. The report further indicates that the percentage of\npeople living under the poverty line of Rf15 per person per day in the focus islands is 50\npercent, which is higher than the country average of 42 percent, and more than double the\npercentage in Mal\u00e9.\n96. A poverty impact ratio (PIR) expressing the proportion of net economic benefits accruing\nto the poor was calculated by comparing the net economic benefits to the poor with the net\neconomic benefits to the economy as a whole. The project preparatory TA report indicates that\nthe GDP of the poor in the focus islands is approximately 11 percent of the total GDP of the\ncountry.  This implies that the Project will have a positive poverty reduction impact when PIR\nexceeds 11 percent. The TA report confirms that the Project will have a significant positive\npoverty reduction impact since the PIR averages 32 percent for the sample representative\nislands  as  a  whole,  and  exceeds  11  percent  in  all  islands  that  were  selected  for  project\nevaluation.\nD. Risks\n97. The Project is technically simple and straightforward. However, its success depends on\n(i)  the  ability  of  the  IA  to  implement  the  project;  (ii)  establishment  of  national  codes  and\nstandards for power suppliers and consumers, and enforcement of such codes and standards;\n(iii) the Government's strong will for enacting new legislation or amending existing laws to\nprovide for the establishment of legal power supply utilities on the outer islands, or recognition\nof the island community groups as legal entities; (iv) willingness of stakeholders to borrow\nmoney from the Government to establish an upgraded power supply system; (v) availability of\nskilled  human  resources  for  proper  maintenance  and  management  of  the  power  supply\nsystems; and (vi) appropriate tariff levels to ensure the financial viability of outer island power\nsupply utilities.  As for the last risk, the project FIRR and EIRR for the representative islands\nwere tested for these sensitivities and found to be robust. Additionally, to mitigate the first risk,\nthe IA will be strengthened by consulting services. To mitigate the second risk, in addition to\nconsulting services for establishing national codes and standards, covenants were agreed upon\nto ensure proper regulation and enforcement of the quality and safety standards of electricity\nsupply. With respect to the third risk, the Government has agreed to prepare and submit new\nlegislation  to  Parliament  for  approval  within  nine  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  which  is\ncovenanted in the legal documents. To mitigate the fourth risk, the Government agreed to a\ncovenant on conducting awareness campaigns and training workshops for project beneficiaries\nand island communities in addition to providing soft term loans.

Introduction\n1. The project feasibility study carried out under the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s)\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Outer  Islands  Electrification  Project  included  an\nevaluation of the potential for renewable resources (photovoltaic [PV]) power and also windmill\npower) to generate electricity in the Maldives.1 The project design concept for both PV and\nwindmill power was to incorporate them into integrated diesel-renewable power supply systems\nfor the outer islands. This design is required to provide reliability, since wind is often very light or\neven absent, and the sun is only available during daylight hours.  This hybrid design is also more\neconomic than a power supply system based entirely on renewable energy sources with large\nbattery storage capacity. Substantial experience with these renewable energy technologies has\nbeen accumulated over the years, including experience on small islands in many countries in the\nPacific Ocean, which are similar to the Maldives.  Adequate data was also available in the\nMaldives on local conditions for solar insolation, and for hourly wind speed records over a period\nof several years at three airports.\n2. The TA study concluded  that these renewable energy components for power supply were\nnot economic for the outer islands in the Maldives. Average economic costs for such renewable\nenergy sources would be more than $1.00 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), and the benefits are only a\nsmall fraction of this, about $0.12-$0.14 per kWh, based on fuel cost savings, reduced operation\nand maintenance (O&M) expenses, and also the global environmental benefits of reduced carbon\ndioxide emissions. The results of this economic analysis are summarized in Table A3.1. There\nwas some concern that perhaps the estimated project costs and benefits from these renewable\nenergy technologies might have been too conservative. Therefore ADB engaged another group of\nstaff consultants to undertake a new and independent evaluation of these renewable energy\ntechnologies during project processing at the fact-finding and appraisal missions. The results of\nthe independent evaluation are also summarized in Table A3.1.\nB. Economic Analysis\n1. Photovoltaic Power Generation\n3. A demonstration project for a PV-diesel power supply system was designed for the island\nof Hanimaadhoo, in Haa Dhaalu atoll.  This island, with a population of 840 people, currently has\na peak daily load of about 60 kW, and several diesel generating sets with 400 kW of total\ncapacity.    With  some  future  load  growth,  it  could  accommodate  an  integrated  PV  power\ncomponent of 40 kW, which would be adequate to serve most of the daytime load.  The bare-\nbones cost of PV power panels is about $3,000-$4,000 per kW, but after all the control equipment,\nstorage batteries, and equipment for inverters and converters to supply 220 volts (V) alternating\ncurrent (AC) power are added to this, the entire integrated PV system will cost about $14,000 per\nkW of PV capacity. This is much higher than the cost of diesel generating sets, which is only\nabout $200 per kW for a basic diesel generator set of 100 kW, and about 50 percent more after all\nthe  control  equipment,  and  a  share  of  building  costs  and  fuel  storage  costs  are  added.\nConsequently, the initial capital investment required for a PV system is about 50 times that for\ndiesel generating sets.\n                  \n1  TA 3232-MLD:  Preparing the Outer Islands Electrification Project. Feasibility Study, prepared by Samoan consultants,\nVol. 4, 2000.", "32\nAppendix 3, page 2\n4. The average cost of renewable energy generation from this demonstration project would\nbe $1.20/kWh, and the benefit-cost ratio would be only 0.11 at 12 percent discount rate.  If such a\nPV power system were replicated in large numbers for about 20-30 islands, there would be\neconomies of scale, especially on engineering services for planning, design and specifications,\nand construction supervision, which would reduce the average cost to about $12,000/kW of\ncapacity and $1.04/kWh, but this is still much too high and the project would remain uneconomic.\n2. Windmill Power Generation\n5. Windmill power generation was also evaluated. In an integrated windmill-diesel power\nsystem, the maximum proportion of windmill power that can be accommodated is restricted to\nabout 15 percent of the total power production.  With more windmill generation, the power supply\nsystem would become unstable. The windmill power system that was designed initially in the TA\nstudy for a typical island was only for 15 kW, and this resulted in high average costs of about\n$16,600 per kW for the windmill component. During appraisal, the focus shifted to larger outer\nislands that could accommodate a larger windmill system of about 40 kW. This reduced the\naverage costs of capacity (Table A3.2). However, the estimated average annual capacity factor\nwas also reduced in the appraisal stage reevaluation, based on a detailed analysis of historic\nhourly wind records in the Maldives. The resulting average cost of renewable energy produced by\nthe windmill component was $1.09 per kWh at appraisal, which is still much too high. Average\nwind speeds in the Maldives are relatively low, which is common at tropical latitudes.2 Power\ngeneration with windmills is very sensitive to wind speed, and increases in proportion to the cubic\npower of wind speed. The average capital costs of windmill generating sets are also very sensitive\nto economies of scale, and decrease with increasing size. The economic optimum unit size is\nusually in the range of 150-250 kW or larger, with the maximum practical unit size close to 1,000\nkW. Consequently, with the low generating unit sizes required in the outer islands and low wind\nspeeds in the Maldives, wind power generation will be much more costly than in other countries\nwith more favorable conditions.3  The economies of scale that have led to very large, cost\ncompetitive windmill farms in the People's Republic of China, Denmark, Germany, India, and US,\nwith large unit sizes and clusters of many windmill generators in one \u201cfarm\u201d are not available in the\nouter islands in the Maldives.\nC. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis\n6. Sensitivity analysis was performed on changes in some of the significant input variables\nand assumptions (Table A3.2). Since the rate of return is negative and is not possible to calculate4\nfor  most  scenarios,  the  results  of  the  economic  evaluation  are  expressed  in  terms  of  the\ndiscounted benefit cost ratio (B/C).  The B/C is only 0.128 for the PV power systems, assuming\nthese are replicated on many islands with the associated economies of scale, and 0.102 for the\nwindmill power systems.  These rates of return improve only slightly with a 20 percent reduction in\n                  \n2  The islands of the Maldives are spread between latitudes 7o 6\u2019  N and 0o 42\u2019 S.\n3  By comparison, in December 2000, ADB approved Loan 1818-PRC for $58 million for the Wind Power Development\nProject in the People's Republic of China. That is economically feasible, but the total installed windmill capacity there\nwill be 78,000 kW, the standard unit size is 660 kW, and the average annual plant capacity factor is estimated to be\n44 percent, compared with only 12.8 percent in the Maldives.\n4  The rate of return is the discount rate at which discounted net cash flow equals zero. This economic internal rate of\nreturn (EIRR) was minus 17 percent for the windmill power project base case, but for the PV power project the\ndiscounted net cash flow was negative for all discount rates up to minus 50 percent due to the need for periodic\nreplacement of equipment (batteries and control equipment), and consequently the EIRR was indeterminate.", "33\nAppendix 3, page 3\ncosts of equipment, and annual O&M and repair costs. With lower discount rates, the B/C also\nimproves, but even with 0 percent discount rate, the B/C is still only 0.267 for the PV systems, and\n0.243 for the windmill systems.  If fuel prices, which are based on a crude oil price of $28/barrel\nfor the base case, were to double, the B/C would increase to 0.218 for the PV systems and 0.186\nfor the windmill systems, which is still not economic.  Fuel prices would have to increase tenfold\nbefore the PV power supply system becomes economic, which is highly unlikely.  Carbon credits\nfor  reductions  in  global  carbon  dioxide  emissions  were  also  included  in  the  project  benefit\nevaluation, based on a carbon credit of $5/ton for the base case, which is the current consensus\nestimate of a reasonable value for this. This is equivalent to only $0.001/kWh, and even if this\nwere to increase 10 times to $50/ton, the B/C would improve only 1 percent.\n7. Many barriers are also associated with using renewable energy to generate power in the\nMaldives. Although the technology has been demonstrated to be feasible in other countries,\nusually more advanced, there is little experience with O&M of such systems in the Maldives.\nExperience in other developing countries with limited technical skills has shown that improper\noperation, inadequate maintenance and periodic replacement of worn equipment, and inability to\nrepair these systems in case of breakdown are serious problems, and often result in projects'\nbreaking down permanently after only a few years of operation. Technical skills for operating\nsophisticated new equipment are limited in the Maldives, especially in the outer islands. The plan\nfor the renewable energy component of the Project also included a $3 million program for removal\nof these barriers to promote renewable energy technologies; that amount is not even included in\nthe project costs and economic analysis described here. The coastal marine environment in the\nMaldives is also a potential problem with power windmills.  Windmill power projects in the Pacific\nislands have experienced high rates of equipment corrosion and breakdown due to salt-laden air\nand coastal spray, high humidity levels, and high temperatures.  These factors could result in\nuseful project lifetimes much lower than the 20 years assumed for the base case in this study. If\nthe project lifetime is only 10 years, the B/C will decline to only 0.083 for PV power systems and\n0.078 for the windmill power systems.\nD. Conclusions\n8. These  renewable  energy  technologies  (hybrid  PV-diesel  and  windmill-diesel)  are  not\neconomically justified for power supply in the outer islands in the Maldives at present, to serve\ncommunities of the size required for this Project, which are typically 100 or more households in a\nreasonably compact community center on each island. Power supply with diesel generating units\nand local distribution grids is much more economic, with each kWh costing only about one tenth\nthe average cost for renewable energy generation. It is not likely that the average capital costs of\nrenewable energy will decline significantly in the near future, but if there are significant reductions,\nthe feasibility can be reassessed. Although electricity supplied from PV household modules is\nwidely used in many developing countries, it is costly in most cases and is practiced only where\nhouseholds are far removed from a community grid, or where power supply from that grid is very\nunreliable. The average costs of PV electricity supply in the project sizes considered for this study\n(40 kW) already achieve full economies of scale, and average costs will not decline significantly\nwith large PV project sizes.  Average costs for windmill power systems will decrease with larger\nunit sizes and with clusters of multiple units, but these would then be too large for the outer\nislands in the Maldives. Even in Mal\u00e9, the economic feasibility of larger windmill power clusters will\nbe affected by the low average wind speeds in the Maldives.", "34\nAppendix 3, page 4\nTable A3.1:  Economics of Renewable Electricity Supply in the Maldives\nTA Reporta  Appraisal Consultants\nPower Original Corrected Single Multiple\nProject Projects\nPhotovoltaic\nPlant Capacity (kW) 38 38 40 40\nAverage Energy (MWh/year) 65 65 70 70\nPlant Capacity Factor (%) 19.5 19.5 20.0 20.0\nAverage Capital Cost of PV system ($/kW) 13,413 13,590 14,000 12,060\nAverage Cost of Energy ($/kWh) 1.215 1.204 1.201 1.045\nBenefit-Cost Ratio 0.089 0.111 0.111 0.128\nWindmill\nGenerator Unit Capacity (kW) 15 15 40\nAverage Energy (MWh/year) 25 25 45\nPlant Capacity Factor (%) 19.0 19.0 12.8\nAverage Captial Cost ($/kW) 16,647 16,647 8,500\nAverage Cost of Energy ($/kWh) 1.438 1.432 1.087\nBenefit-Cost Ratio 0.086 0.077 0.102\nkW = kilowatt, MWh = megawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour.\na TA 3232-MLD:  Preparing the Outer Islands Electrification Project.

For each subproject, MAA will use planning and design criteria and procedures that are\nsimilar to those used in the feasibility studies for sample islands, prepared under the project\npreparatory technical assistance (TA) for Preparing the Outer Islands Electrification Project (ADB\nTA  3232)  completed  in  January  2001.  The  main  steps  in  planning  and  evaluating  of  each\nsubproject are summarized below:\n(i)  Load forecast. The load forecast for the period until 2010 should be estimated for\neach  island  on  the  basis  of  the  following  factors:  (a)  historic  growth  rates  in\npopulation, in the local economy and income levels, and in per capita consumption\nof electricity; (b) estimates of future growth of these variables, and other factors\nthat  would  influence  the  load  forecast;  (c)  estimates  of  future  reductions  in\ndistribution losses as a result of the Project, and of future trends in annual load\nfactor; and (d) the resulting forecast of future electricity kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales,\nand total generation requirements for energy and for peak load.\n(ii)  Generation development plan. This should be determined for each island on the\nbasis  of  (a)  assessment  of  the  condition  of  existing  diesel  generating  units\n(including estimated fuel efficiency, reliability, and expected annual maintenance\nand repair costs), and the remaining useful life and recommended retirement dates\nfor each unit; (b) plan to add new generating units of an appropriate size for that\nisland  for  the  period  2002-2010,  which  should  consider  reserve  capacity\nrequirements that will offer reliable overall supply that is still affordable; (c) plans to\nadd  control  equipment  to  synchronize  the  operation  of  diesel  generating  sets\nshould  also  be  considered  for  larger  islands;  (d)  other  needs  for  improving", "39 Appendix 7, page 2\npowerhouse  control  equipment,  for  constructing  fuel  storage  tanks,  and  for\ndeveloping  new  powerhouse  buildings  in  some  cases,  etc.,  also  need  to  be\nconsidered, but in each case the costs of such improvements must be determined,\nand island communities consulted to confirm whether or not they believe the\nadditional  costs  of  nonessential  improvements  are  justified,  considering  the\nimpacts on island electricity tariffs.\n(iii)  Distribution development plan. This should be determined for each island on the\nbasis of (a) an assessment of the condition of the existing distribution system,\nincluding the rated capacity of various cable sections, their estimated loading and\nlosses, and the total losses for the island; (b) prepared plans for distribution system\ndevelopment, if necessary, that will provide adequate distribution system capacity\nto all neighborhoods on the island, and keep losses and voltage drops within\nreasonable limits.  The costs of distribution improvements need to be balanced\nagainst the benefits, and where it is practical to do so. The economic benefits of\ndistribution system improvements should be evaluated and compared with the\ncosts so as to justify such improvements. In some cases, however, it is recognized\nthat  economic  analysis  of  distribution  system  improvements  is  difficult  or\nimpractical, and engineering judgment based on common practice may then be\nused to determine the necessary improvements.\n(iv)  Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  development  plan.  The  costs  of  all\nimprovements must be fully recovered on each island through local tariffs. Each\ndevelopment plan must be affordable, and it must be economically justified. Each\nsubproject  appraisal  must  include  economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the\nrecommended  development  plan  over  the  period  2002-2010.  The  economic\nanalysis  should  include  all  capital  and  operating  costs  over  this  period.  The\nincremental economic costs of additional electricity sales (compared with the base\ncase of continued operation with no load growth, or with only growth that could be\nsupported with existing power system capacity1) should be compared with the\nincremental economic benefits of that additional electricity supply. The average\neconomic benefit rate calculated during appraisal for this project was about Rf6.0-\n7.0/kWh for electricity use in the outer islands in the Maldives. Each subproject\nmust yield a minimum economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 10 percent. A\nfinancial projection is also required of power supply operations for each island for\n2002-2010.  This  should  include  all  operating  costs,  and  consider  all  capital\nexpenditures and debt service on all loans.  Average tariff levels each year need to\nbe calculated, and they must be affordable.\n4. The appraisal of each proposed subproject recommended for approval will be described in\na subproject appraisal report that will include the following:\n(i)  recommended subproject development plan prepared as described in para. 3;\n(ii)  design (at tender level) of the proposed subproject and detailed cost estimates;\n(iii) implementation schedule and implementation arrangements;\n                                                          \n1 It should be noted that even for the base case scenario with no load growth, some diesel generating sets and other\nequipment will still need to be replaced when they reach the end of their useful economic lifetime.", "40 Appendix 7, page 3\n(iv) economic and financial analyses prepared as described in para. 3;\n(v) proposed level of tariffs and assessment of affordability;\n(vi) environmental examination;\n(vii) socioeconomic survey results including population, household income distribution,\nand electricity uses;\n(viii) proposed  structure  of  the  electricity  suppliers  on  that  island,  and  relevant\nsupporting documentation; and\n(ix)  if  land  allocation  is  required  for  construction  of  the  subproject,  (a)  proof  that\nappropriate authorities have approved the allocation of government-owned land,\nand (b) confirmation that no resettlement of people or impact on livelihood is\ninvolved.", "41\nAppendix 8\nTENTATIVE CONTRACT PACKAGE LIST\nEstimated\nContract Item Description Contract Type Contract\nNo. (ICB) Value ($ million)a\n1 Supply and Installation of Electricity  Supply Turnkey 2.5\nSystem in the First Batch of Islands\n2 Supply and Installation of Electricity  Supply Turnkey 2.5\nSystem in the Second Batch of Islands\n3 Supply and Installation of Electricity Supply Turnkey 2.4\nSystem in the Last Batch of Islands\nTotal 7.4\nICB = international competitive bidding.\na Does not include tax and duties.", "42\nAppendix 9, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES\nA. Introduction\n1. The Government of the Republic of Maldives, through its Ministry of Atolls Administration\n(MAA), intends to (i) improve the electricity supply in about 40 outer islands by installing diesel\ngenerator sets, and expanding and augmenting distribution systems; and (ii) encourage ownership\nand accountability of island communities for the supply and operation and maintenance (O&M) of\ntheir power supply systems. The project, to be funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nunder its Outer Islands Electrification Project for the Maldives, will be implemented in three batches\nof islands, with 12-15 islands in each batch.\n2. The Government also intends to improve the regulation of the power sector.  In 1998, the\nGovernment established the Maldives Electricity Bureau (MEB) and gave it the responsibility for\nregulating the power sector, including establishing standards of electricity supply, regulating the\nelectricity service providers, and setting electricity tariffs. Regulation is often difficult because of the\nunique island geography of the country and the lack of qualified staff.\n3. The Government, through the Ministry of Planing and National Development (MPND), also\nintends  to  undertake  benefit  and  poverty  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BPME)  to  monitor  and\nmeasure the social and economic benefits of the Project.\n4. Additionally, the Government has recognized that the legal framework for establishing\ncommunity-based island electricity companies is inadequate.  Through its Attorney General\u2019s Office\n(AGO), the Project will strengthen the legal framework to permit the creation of community-based\nisland  electricity  supply  utilities,  or  recognition  of  the  existing  community  groups  supplying\nelectricity.\nB. Implementation Agency Inputs\n5. Each agency receiving consulting services under this Project - MAA, MEB, MPND, and\nAGO - will assist the consultants engaged under the Project in obtaining the required work permits\nand visas, and in meeting any other requirements under Maldivian law.  Each agency will make\navailable to the consultants in or near its head office in Mal\u00e9, a dedicated office space, access to\nsecretarial, translation, and communication services including fax, telephone, and Internet facilities,\nif required by the consultants.\n6. MAA, the Implementing Agency of the Project, will coordinate with the other agencies\nreceiving consulting services to ensure that necessary arrangements are carried out efficiently to\nprovide the consultants with the necessary space and equipment to carry out their tasks with\nmaximum efficiency.  MAA will also coordinate with the other agencies to ensure (i) optimum use of\nGovernment resources, with minimal duplication and wastage; and (ii) that the consultants are\nprovided with the necessary interisland airplane and sea travel and, if deemed necessary and\npracticable by the consultants and the Government, an interisland boat for the duration of the\nconsulting services.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) will resolve any potential or\nactual conflicts in arrangements or understanding between any of the Government agencies and\nthe consultants.", "43\nAppendix 9, page 2\nC. Scope of Consulting Services\n7. About 30 person-months of international and 93 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices required for the Project will be provided under two separate consulting services contracts.\nAn international consulting firm, which will be encouraged to associate with individual domestic\nconsultants, will be recruited to assist MAA, MEB, and MPND with implementing their respective\nparts of the Project. A domestic legal consultant will be recruited to provide legal advisory services\nto AGO. MAA, in coordination with MEB and MPND, will recruit the international consulting firm,\nand AGO, in consultation with MOFT, will engage the domestic legal consultant. All consultants will\nbe  recruited  and  engaged  following  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. All\nconsultants  will  be  required  to  coordinate  their  activities  with  one  another  to  ensure  smooth\ncoordination under the Project.\n1. Implementation Assistance to MAA\n8. About 20 person-months of international and 80 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices will be available to assist MAA to carry out detailed engineering; prepare subproject\nappraisal reports; coordinate documentation for the establishing legal island power supply utilities;\nprepare bid documents; assist in evaluating bids and awarding contracts; supervise installation\nwork, final testing, and commissioning; and train island power supply utilities in O&M of power\nsupply systems, and accounting. The consultants will perform the above tasks, with the objective\nof, among other things, improving the project design on a sustainable and affordable basis, and\nupgrading the project management skills of the assigned MAA staff and other project- related\ngovernment ministries. The consultants are expected to carry out most of these tasks in the\nMaldives.\n9. The consultants providing implementation assistance to MAA will have qualifications and\nexpertise in planning, design, and construction of diesel power generation; distribution planning\nand operations; power system accounting, finance, and economic analysis; environmental, legal,\nregulatory, and social analysis; and stakeholder consultations. The services to MAA are as follows:\na. Team Leader\n10. The team leader, who should also serve as technical expert, will (i)  be responsible for the\noverall management of all consulting services (international and domestic), and coordination of the\nProject among all of the Government agencies involved, consultants, and ADB; (ii) ensure that\nconsultants for MAA coordinate their activities with the consultants for the other agencies receiving\nconsulting services under the Project; (iii) prepare a project consultant coordination schedule to\nensure that all consulting services inputs under the Project are carried out efficiently and precisely,\nand that duplication of effort and wastage of the Government\u2019s resources are avoided; and (iv)\nensure that all consulting inputs requiring trips to the outer islands are coordinated to avoid\nduplication.", "44\nAppendix 9, page 3\nb.

The consultants will have relevant expertise to carry out the tasks in para. 15.  Such\nexpertise will include, but will not be limited to, expertise in legal and regulatory requirements of the\npower  sector;  and  technical,  commercial  (especially  tariff  settings),  and  operations  and\nmanagement structures for regulatory authorities in the power sector.  The services to MEB will\ninclude the following:\n(i)  review and analyze the current organizational structure and operation of\nMEB and its relationship with other Government ministries and agencies to\ndetermine the most appropriate structure to effectively perform its expected\nfunctions;\n(ii)  develop  a  mission  statement  for  MEB  and  prepare  a  framework  for\nregulations including technical, economic, and customer service standards;", "47\nAppendix 9, page 6\n(iii)  prepare a staff selection and human resource development scheme;\n(iv)  identify the required staff functions and draft job descriptions;\n(v)  prepare an organizational chart for the authority;\n(vi)  draft national safety and quality standards of power supply systems to be\nincluded in the applicable industry codes;\n(vii)  develop procedures for enforcing the quality and safety standards;\n(viii)  train MEB inspectors in enforcing the quality and safety standards;\n(ix)  formulate comprehensive pricing principles for setting tariffs;\n(x)  develop model application formats for tariff submissions by power supply\nutilities;\n(xi)  develop formats for the annual report to ADB on MEB's activities including\ninstitutional strengthening, inspection of island electricity supply systems,\ntariff applications reviewed, etc.; and\n(xii)  coordinate and work with all other consultants, particularly the team leader\nand  consultants  assigned  to  MAA,  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  of\nMEB\u2019s activities with the rest of the Project.\n3. Benefit and Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation\n17. BPME of the Project will be the responsibility of MPND in collaboration with stakeholders in\neach subproject area. Two counterpart staff from MPND will assist the consultants in conducting\nthe survey and preparing the report.\n18. MPND will be provided with about 4 person-months of international and 7 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services to assist it in carrying out BPME of the Project.\n19.  BPME is intended to monitor and measure the social and economic benefits of the Project\nthat will allow postevaluation, and to improve planning for future electrification projects. BPME is\nthe primary means of determining the extent to which projects address the need and demands of\nthe  project  beneficiaries,  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  project  approach,  policies,\nprocedures,  and  overall  impacts  of  the  Project.  To  maximize  transparency  and  public\naccountability, BPME will involve all key stakeholders - island development committees, island\nwomen's committees (IWCs), and other beneficiaries - in designing and implementing BPME. The\nindicators for monitoring, which will be developed during the initial stage of the Project through\nparticipatory assessment and workshop at the atoll and national levels, will include (i) number of\nconnected consumers in various categories versus number of potential total consumers in those\ncategories in an island; (ii) average consumption rates for consumers in each category; (iii) tariff\nstructures and levels; (iv) technical losses of electricity supply; (v) description of new economic\nactivities induced by the Project and their estimated total value; (vi) estimates of average income\nlevels before and after the Project; (vii) the perceived importance of various types of noneconomic\nbenefits created by the Project, such as improved quality of life and leisure activities, better\nenvironment for reading and study, and improved health; and (viii) poverty status.", "48\nAppendix 9, page 7\n20. BPME will assess socioeconomic impacts and outcomes and focus on what changes -\npositive or negative, expected or unexpected - have resulted from the Project. Emphasis will be on\nmeasuring impacts related to (i) increased use and accessibility of electricity services, and (ii)\ndirect  employment  generation  and  creation  of  economic  opportunities.  Direct  health  and\nenvironmental impacts may also be considered if deemed necessary, i.e., for specific health or\nenvironment-related  use  of  electricity.  Social  and  poverty  impact  monitoring  includes,  among\nothers, an analysis of the socioeconomic benefit and cost distribution across consumer categories\nand income groups, and improvement of the quality of life of the community and households such\nas in health and education. The assessment will pay particular attention to the impacts on poor\nhouseholds.\n21. MPND will finalize BPME design and assessment with the assistance of the consultants.\nAppropriate methodologies will be developed for collecting, recording, and analyzing qualitative\nand quantitative information about the Project. Both participatory and survey methods will be used.\nEfforts will be made to facilitate participatory data gathering and analysis at atoll, island, and\nhousehold levels.\n22. Before the construction of subprojects, baseline surveys will be carried out within the\nsubproject area as part of the social, economic, and poverty assessments. Purposive-sampling\nsurvey of islands and atolls from each region (north and south) will be done. Criteria for selecting\nthe islands and atolls will be developed at the initial stage of the Project through participatory\nworkshops. Twelve islands in four atolls will be selected as sampling areas for social, economic,\nand poverty monitoring and evaluation in the project area. In addition, four nonproject islands in the\nsame  four  atolls  will  be  selected  as  control  areas.  Workshops  will  be  conducted  to  identify\nappropriate social and poverty indicators and to reach consensus with the beneficiaries and other\nstakeholders.\n23. Benefits generated during the project period will be measured against the baseline data\nand those for the control islands, after project completion. Beneficiaries will be involved in poverty\nimpact monitoring. Women will have an equal opportunity to participate in project activities, and will\nbe adequately represented in training for BPME.\n24. The reporting framework will be developed by MPND with the assistance of the consultants.\nBPME will be part of the management information system (MIS) to provide the Government with a\ndetailed overview of the demand for and obstacles to electricity services in the outer islands.\n25. The international consultants, with the support of the domestic consultants, will have overall\nresponsibility  for  BPME  including  (i)  designing,  organizing,  and  supervising  the  surveys,\nconsultations, and workshops; (ii) supervising the domestic consultant; and (iii) producing the\ninception, interim, and final reports. The terms of reference for the international and domestic\nconsultants are as follows:\na. International Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist\n(i) define  social,  economic,  and  poverty  indicators  to  be  monitored  under\nBPME;\n(ii) establish  necessary  systems  for  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  impact\nassessment of the indicators;", "49\nAppendix 9, page 8\n(iii)  conduct training and workshops to ensure that all agencies and personnel\ninvolved  in  collecting  data  fully  understand  the  purposes,  scope,  and\nprocesses of BPME;\n(iv) provide training for project staff involved in BPME;\n(v) prepare the framework for the inception, interim, and final reports for each\nsurvey, and establish a MIS for BPME;\n(vi) submit the required BPME reports to the Government and ADB in a timely\nmanner;\n(vii) establish a system for transferring of relevant information to MPND;\n(viii) design a training and coaching program for MPND staff to be conducted by\nMPND's internal trainers to strengthen staff capacity in social, economic, and\npoverty assessment, and train the MPND trainers for these activities; and\n(ix) coordinate and work with all other consultants, particularly the team leader\nand  consultants  assigned  to  MAA,  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  of\nMPND\u2019s activities with the rest of the Project.\nb. Domestic Social and Poverty Specialist\n(i) assist the international consultant in designing and implementing the BPME\nsurvey, workshop, and report preparation;\n(ii) assist in identifying the social and poverty indicators to be considered in\nscreening the subproject proposals, and assist in applying such indicators;\n(iii) assist in designing and implementing the BPME program in the selected\nislands (project and nonproject areas);\n(iv)  identify  community  organizations  and  community  groups  related  to  the\nProject,  and  develop  strategies  for  stakeholders'  -  particularly  the\nbeneficiaries  -  participation  in  decision  making,  planning,  designing,\nimplementing, and O&M stage of the Project;\n(v)  conduct training for key stakeholders in participatory planning, implementing\nand monitoring the Project;\n(vi)  facilitate the consultative process to ensure the active involvement of island\ncommunities in project tasks and decision making; and\n(vii) coordinate and work with all other consultants, particularly the team leader\nand  consultants  assigned  to  MAA,  to  ensure  smooth  implementation  of\nMPND\u2019s activities with the rest of the Project.", "50\nAppendix 9, page 9\n4. Legal Advisory Services\n26. AGO  will  have  approximately  2  person-months  of  legal  advisory  services  from  local\nlawyers.  The  consultants  will  assist  AGO  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework  for  creating  or\nrecognizing community-based island power supply utilities.\n27. The Government has recognized that the current legal framework does not permit the\ncreation of special island legal entities formed to address particular needs of a particular island.\nThe Government intends to amend its laws to address this shortcoming by reviewing the best\npossible legal option to meet the objectives of (i) creating a culture of community ownership among\nisland communities for, among other things, essential services such as electricity; (ii) maximize\ncommunity participation in the design and O&M of their power supply systems; and (iii) foster a\nculture of financial transparency and accountability.\n28. The legal advisory services to AGO are intended to assist the Attorney General to prepare\nand finalize the necessary draft legislation for submission to Parliament, all within the time frame\nagreed upon with the Government.  The detailed services are as follows:\n(i)  review existing Maldivian laws and other relevant documentation, particularly\nthose related to ADB's Outer Islands Electrification Project, and consult with\nall stakeholders to acquire a full understanding of the status of the legal\nframework,  the objectives of the Project, and the need for creating legally\nrecognized  community-based  island  power  supply  utilities,  such  as\ncooperatives, under the Project;\n(ii)  carry out all legal tasks necessary to assist AGO to prepare amending or\noriginal legislation to submit to Parliament for approval within the time frame\nestablished and agreed to by the Government under the Project, including,\nbut not limited to preparing draft legislation, explanatory notes, supporting\ndocumentation, reports, etc.;\n(iii)  conduct another round of consultation with stakeholders to ensure that the\nlegislation addresses all relevant issues;\n(iv)  in coordination with the team leader for implementation services to MAA and\nwithin three months of the commencement of those services, organize for\nrelevant Government officials, including representatives from MAA, MPND,\nMOFT, and MEB a study tour to a neighboring country with a cooperative\nlaw on the books, and a proven track record in operating cooperatives, to\nreview  whether  a  cooperative  legal  structure  and  cooperative  law  are\nfeasible options for the island power suppliers;\n(v)  prepare and submit a report to ADB within five months of the start of these\nservices, reporting on the status of proposed reforms to be undertaken by\nthe Government; and\n(vi)  coordinate and work with all other consultants, particularly the team leader\nand  consultants  assigned  to  MAA,  to  ensure  proper  timing  and  smooth\ncoordination between the activities of AGO and the rest of the Project.", "51\nAppendix 10, page 1\nMAJOR ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS\nA. General\n1. Since the islands evaluated had no proper past records, proforma financial projections of\neach of the island power supply utilities were prepared for the period 2001-2010 to see how\neach of them will perform over this period. The financial projections focus on the island\u2019s\nincome, expenditure, and cash flow position presented in local currency (Table A10). The\nprojections are in current terms. Domestic inflation was assumed at 5.0 percent while the\ninternational  inflation  rate  was  2.4  percent  annually.  These  rates  are  based  on  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Project Administration Instructions No. 1.3 issued in June 2000. A large\nportion of the capital expenditures will be in foreign currency, and the exchange rate used to\nconvert the costs to local currency is Rf12.80 to $1.00.\nB. Investment Projections\n2. The capital expenditures for each of the islands evaluated are based on the investment\nrequirements set out during the forecast period up to 2010. It was assumed that investments\nincurred  up  to  2005  would  be  covered  or  financed  under  the  Project,  and  subsequent\ninvestments for replacements or expansions were assumed to be arranged by the island power\nsupply utilities themselves. The capital costs are defined as base costs (as estimated by the\nproject preparatory technical assistance consultants) plus 10 percent physical contingencies\nand 12.5 percent taxes and duties on the foreign exchange components. Price contingencies\nare taken into account, to reflect price changes during the forecast period, i.e., by inflating these\ncosts by the domestic inflation rates.\nC. Electricity Sales, Revenues, and Tariffs\n3. Electricity  sales  and  generation  for  each  island  utility  are  based  on  the  demand\nprojections for each island. The growth situation in each island is unique, i.e., in some of these\nislands, like Funadhoo and Muli for example, populations are expected to increase substantially\nin the next few years as the Government declared Funadhoo a resettlement island, and Muli as\na  atoll  capital.  In  such  cases,  electricity  demand  and  sales  are  projected  to  increase\nsubstantially in line with this population growth. In general, electricity demand in the outer\nislands has been suppressed due to unreliable and limited supply. With the Project, system\nlosses are expected to reduce to 10 percent (Table A10) from the current 20-30 percent, and\nreliability will improve as each island will have sufficient generating capacity to supply electricity\nfor 24 hours a day.\n4. Revenues over the forecast period are based on total sales (kilowatt-hour [kWh]) per\nannum by the island power supply utilities in the sample islands at the projected financial tariffs\ngenerally ranging from Rf3.50 to Rf6.0. These tariffs were set based on a minimum cash break-\neven principle, i.e., revenues should be sufficient to cover operating costs, the greater portion of\ndepreciation or debt service requirement, and the need to ensure that cumulative cash flow\nremains positive. Compared with the existing tariffs, the projected tariffs in many islands show\nimprovements (see projected tariffs in Table 3 of the main text). The Project will reduce the high\nsystem losses, increase efficiency, and thus provide increased profitability from higher sales\nvolume and lower operating costs. In general, due to high operating costs, current tariffs are\nonly sufficient to finance ongoing operation and maintenance (O&M) in many islands, and they\ncannot cover the full cost of capital replacement. In many cases, the Government provided the\nislands with free generators, so many of them are not aware that they will bear the costs of", "52\nAppendix 10, page 2\nreplacing the generators. Under the Project, the staff of the island power supply utilities will be\ngiven  some  training  in  management  and  accounting/bookkeeping  skills  to  enable  them  to\nunderstand the basic cash break-even principle and to keep proper records of their operations.\nIn addition, the Project will attempt to instill a culture of accountability and a sense of ownership\nof power supply systems.\nD. Operating Costs\n1. Fuel Cost\n5. With the Project, fuel use efficiency is expected to improve to 0.31 liter/kWh from the\ncurrent levels of 0.33-0.38 liter/kWh. Many power supply utilities in the outer islands currently\nbuy fuel at Rf4.5 per liter but in Mal\u00e9, the State Electric Company Limited buys at Rf4.0 per liter.\nThe cost of fuel in the outer island is higher due to transportation costs. However, despite the\nfact that these islands are so spread out, the costs of fuel on each of the islands are very much\nthe same. The Government does not provide any subsidy on fuel.  Fuel cost for subsequent\nyears are projected to move in line with the domestic inflation rate.\n2. Lube Oil Cost\n6. With the Project, lube use efficiency will improve to 0.003 liter/kWh from 0.004 liter/kWh.\nThe cost of lube oil in the outer islands is currently at Rf25.0/liter. This cost is projected to\nincrease in line with domestic inflation rate.\n3. Operating and Other Expenses\n7. O&M cost was assumed at $0.015 for each kWh generated, and an annual provision for\nbad debt was estimated at 5 percent of total electricity sales for the year. Salaries and wages\nare based on the current salaries in each of these sample islands, Rf1,000-Rf2,000 per month\nper person. All these cost projections are assumed in current terms, increasing in line with\ndomestic inflation.\n4. Interest Expenses\n8. Under the Project, the outer islands will be charged a re-lending rate of 8.0 percent per\nannum. The loan will be in local currency; therefore the islands are not exposed to foreign\ncurrency risk. The interest rate for subsequent financing of capital expansion/replacement will\nbe based on the current commercial lending rate of 12.0 percent per annum.\nE. Debt Service and Borrowings\n9. The Government will on-lend the ADB loan (excluding the cost of consulting services) to\nthe outer islands repayable over 12 years with a grace period of 4 years for the loan principal\nrepayment. The Government will provide land if required. The Government will charge 8.0\npercent per annum on the loan. The 12-year repayment period follows the average economic\nlife of about 8-9 percent of the proposed assets (i.e. 7 years on the generators and 20 years on\ncables/distribution system). Subsequent borrowing for major capital expenditure is assumed to\ncover about 70 percent of total costs (30 percent self-financing) and will have a repayment\nperiod of seven years with a one-year grace period.", "53 Appendix 10, page 3\nTable A10:  Income, Expenditure and  Cash flow Projections for Vaikaradhoo FY2001-2010\n(All costs and revenues are in Rf '000 in current prices.)\nYear Ending 31 December 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nDomestic Inflation Rate (%) 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00%\nInflation Factor 1       1 .05       1 .10       1 .16       1 .22       1 .28       1 .34       1 .41       1 .48       1 .55\n\"Project\" Capital Cost  0.0 1,719.2 30.0\nOngoing costs 32.2 458.2 37.3 640.1 43.1 707.8 49.8\nProject Financing (%)\nGovernment of Maldives Grant 0%\nGovernment of Maldives Loan 100% 320.8 448.1 495.5\nCommunity 0%\nTotal 100%\nAdd Interest (IDC) 0.0 68.8 1.2 0.0\n \nElectricity Operation\nTotal Installed Capacity (kW)           110        1 10        1 10        1 20        1 20        1 20        1 20        1 20        1 60        1 60\nGeneration (MWh)          1 80        2 01        1 93        2 12        2 31        2 50        2 69        2 87        3 04        3 24\nDistribution Losses (%) 22% 22% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10%\nElectricity Sales (MWh) 141.1 157.1 173.7 190.7 208.0 225.2 242.1 258.4 273.9 291.6\nNumber of Employees 9 9 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\nTotal Population       1 ,239     1 ,269     1 ,299     1 ,330     1 ,362     1 ,394     1 ,428     1 ,462     1 ,497     1 ,532\nPopulation Growth (%) 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4%\nNumber of Consumers          2 35        2 40        2 46        2 52        2 58        2 64        2 71        2 77        2 84        2 90\nConsumer Growth (%) 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4% 2.4%\nTariff (Rf/kWh)          4.00       4 .00       4 .00       4 .25       4 .50       4 .50       5 .00       5 .25       5 .50       5 .75\nRevenues  \nSales  564.3 628.3 694.8 810.6 936.0 1,013.4 1,210.6 1,356.8 1,506.4 1,677.0\nLess Bad Debts 28.2 31.4 34.7 40.5 46.8 50.7 60.5 67.8 75.3 83.8\nNet Revenues 536.0 596.9 660.0 770.1 889.2 962.8 1,150.1 1,289.0 1,431.0 1,593.1\n \nOperating Expenses\nDiesel Fuel and Oil 293.7 344.7 312.8 360.7 412.9 469.5 530.0 594.0 660.9 739.0\nSalaries and Wages 113.0 118.6 41.5 43.6 45.8 48.1 50.5 53.0 55.6 58.4\nRepair and Maintenance 31.7 37.2 37.4 43.1 49.4 56.1 63.4 71.0 79.0 88.4\nOthers 5.4 6.0 6.6 7.7 8.9 9.6 11.5 12.9 14.3 15.9\nTotal Operating Expenses 443.7 506.4 398.3 455.1 517.0 583.3 655.3 730.9 809.9 901.7\nCash Available from Operations 92.3 90.4 261.7 315.0 372.2 379.5 494.8 558.1 621.1 691.4\nDebt Servicing\nInterest            -         -      1 43.0     1 45.5     1 64.8     1 84.0     2 18.8     1 98.6     2 28.9     1 98.5\nLoan Repayment            -         -          -          -          -      2 13.9     2 30.3     3 09.1     3 25.0     4 13.0\nTotal 0.0 0.0 143.0 145.5 164.8 397.9 449.2 507.7 553.9 611.5\n \nCash Flow after Debt Service 92.3 90.4 118.7 169.5 207.4 -18.5 45.6 50.4 67.2 79.9\nInitial Investment (plus IDC) 0.0 1,788.0 31.2\nCapital Replacement/Expansion 0.0 0.0 0.0 32.2 458.2 37.3 640.1 43.1 707.8 49.8\nGrant Funds 0.0 0.0 0.0\nLoan Funds 0.0 1,788.0 31.2 320.8 0.0 448.1 0.0 495.5 0.0\nTotal Funds 0.0 1,788.0 31.2 0.0 320.8 0.0 448.1 0.0 495.5 0.0\nAnnual Cash Flow 92.3 90.4 118.7 137.2 69.9 -55.8 -146.4 7.4 -145.2 30.1\nCumulative Cash Flow 118.7 255.9 325.9 270.1 123.7 131.0 -14.1 15.9\nIDC = Interest during construction, kW = kilowatt, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MWh = megawatt-hour.\nSources: ADB and Consultant's estimates.", "54\nAppendix 11, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\nA. Introduction\n1. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out by the project preparatory\ntechnical assistance (TA) consultants for a representative eight sample islands1 in accordance\nwith ADB's environmental assessment requirements and environmental review procedures. The\nIEE was discussed and formally submitted to the Government in January 2001 as part of the\nfinal TA report.\nB. Description of the Project\n2. A detailed description of the Project is given in para. 46-47 of the main text.\nC. Description of the Environment\n3. All the sample islands visited were typical atoll islands, only a meter or two above mean\nsea level.  Soils are generally poor and sandy. The islands vary from 9 to 220 hectares (ha),\nand population density from 4 to 64 people per ha. Little in the way of land mammals were\nsighted, other than the occasional domesticated cat. Bird life was not prolific.\n4. Human settlements were closely spaced, following a rectangular grid pattern of roads.\nRoads were generally laid out on a rectangular basis, and were soft coral sand. None of the\nroads in the sample islands were sealed. Generally, the settlements were close to the center of\nthe islands, but in more densely populated islands sometimes spanned the full width of the\nisland with a band of vegetation between the outermost houses and the ocean shore.\n5. On most islands each house is surrounded by a 2-meter-high plastered coral block\nfence. This usually enclosed a number of small residential structures and a building for cooking\nand food preparation. Older houses had few external windows, but newly constructed ones had\nbarred windows of a moderate size.\n6. Fishing boats, cargo boats, and passenger boats are essential to island life. Numerous\nboats are generally moored in a well-defined area or areas and, where provided, in harbors. All\nislands without harbors wanted to construct a harbor by dredging the reef. Reclaiming land\nusing  sand  and  material  dredged  from  the  reef  is  also  a  favored  development  activity.\nOrganized farming is limited, even on those islands classified as agricultural.\n7. All the islands had a freshwater table close to the surface. On some islands, this water is\nhighly polluted and unsuitable for washing or drinking. On other islands, the water is suitable for\nwashing,  but  is  not  used  for  drinking,  except  in  emergencies.  Rainwater  from  house  or\ncommunal tanks is the main source of drinking water.\n8. On many islands, solid waste is dumped on the surface just inside the forest line. A\nconsiderable amount of solid waste finds its way into the ocean and is washed up on the\nbeaches. It is evident that both increased population and increased development is stressing\nthe environment. While the central residential areas of the islands were generally clean and well\ncared for by the community, there seemed to be little general awareness of the fragility of the\necology on atoll islands or of the steps that need to be taken to protect the environment.\n                  \n1 Neykurendhoo, Nolhivaramu, Vaikaradhoo, Funadhoo, Mulah, Muli, Naalaafushi, and Veyvah.", "55\nAppendix 11, page 2\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigating Measures\n9. A  minor  short-term  potential  environmental  impact  derives  from  the  installation  of\ngenerators and cables. There will be a potentially more long-term environmental impact from the\noperation of the power stations. The following paragraphs describe the potential environmental\nimpacts and their mitigating measures.\n1. Construction\na. Power Station Buildings\n10. Existing power station buildings will be used where possible. Few buildings will be\nconstructed under the Project, and they will be small, no bigger than a house, and will use\nbuilding materials and skills commonly available on the outer islands. Where a new power\nstation is required, land and clearing requirements will be small. Population relocation will not be\nrequired.\n11. Where  required,  existing  power  stations  will  be  modified  to  mitigate  environmental\neffects. Such work will be minor and will be limited to sealing existing buildings, providing\nsound-proof air vents, and establishing bulk fuel tanks and bunded oil-handling areas.\nb. Underground Distribution Cables\n12. All cables will be low voltage. In almost all locations, they will be buried along the side of\nexisting unsealed roadways. They will be protected from interference by burial depth and by\nsteel wire armoring.\n13. All cables will be covered with an inert polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheath. The trenches will\nbe opened for only a short while, as the sandy soil conditions are such that a trench would\ncollapse if left open. No trees will be cleared for the distribution works.\n14. At the level of voltage proposed, there will be no transformers and no high-voltage\nswitchgear. Under the proposed design, there is no possibility for using polychlorinated biphenyl\n(PCB) oils; however, if capacitors are to be used to correct a low load factor, it is recommended\nthat the specification exclude the use of PCB oils. PCB oils are cancer causing, and as they\nbreak down in the soil or water table, spills or leaks eventually enter the food chain. No negative\nenvironmental impact has been identified, other than the remote possibility that PCB oils may be\nused in capacitors, if capacitors are installed.\n2. Operation\na. Powerhouse Operation\n15. Diesel Oil Transport. Transporting oil to the islands appears to be carried out safely.\nSome islands receive their supply from bulk tankers that are operated either by the State\nTrading Organization (STO) or by private entrepreneurs. This simple operation was carried out\ncompetently and without any spillage. The tanker crew observed accepted safety practices, and\nappeared to have the operation well under control at all times. Most oil is carried to the island in\n200 liter drums on the routine cargo boat supplying the island. This oil in drums is usually\npurchased from Mal\u00e9, but one island purchased its oil from Kulhudhuffushi. Some utilities", "56\nAppendix 11, page 3\npurchased fuel oil from bulk stores on their own island. Transporting oil by drums seems a safe\nmethod of transport. Empty drums are returned for reuse.\n16. Although  reef  damage  resulting  from  the  anchors  of  the  many  general  cargo  and\npassenger boats is evident, there is no evidence of damage to the reef by the anchors of boats\nspecifically involved in fuel transportation.\n17. Diesel and Lubricating Oil Spillage. There is very little evidence of oil having been\nspilled at the fuel storage or handling areas. However, where there was significant oil spillage,\nno action was taken to remove the contaminated sand from the site. Education and monitoring\nof  cleaning  up  after  oil  spills  are  required.  The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Housing  and\nEnvironment (MHHE) will establish officers on each atoll to regulate environmental compliance\nand  provide  environmental  education.  The  officer  will  be  able  to  take  adequate  steps  to\nminimize the damage caused by minor spills.\n18. In general, oil storage facilities are poor. Where they exist, bulk tanks are generally not\nbunded, nor is the surrounding area concreted. Even though diesel oil is rated as combustible,\noften oil is stored in a manner that presents a considerable fire risk to the power station and to\nthe neighboring residences. In more than one location, oil was stored inside the power station.\nIn one location the oil was stored inside the power station in a 2,000-liter plastic water tank,\nwhich has the potential for splitting.\n19. Under the Project, bulk tanks will be installed at all power stations where they are\nrequired. The tanks will be at least 5 meters removed from the station building, bunded with\nconcrete lining within the bund. Under the Project, drum handling areas should be concreted\nand fitted with interceptor drains.\n20. Disposal and Handling of Waste Lubricating Oil. Lubricating oil is generally stored in\n200-liter drums near the power station. In most locations waste lubricating oil is greatly in\ndemand for treating timber. On one island, waste lubricating oil is buried in a hole in the beach,\nand in another it is dumped into a well. On both islands, the power station managers thought\nthey were behaving responsibly. Where oil has contaminated the soil, the soil should be dug up\nand entombed in concrete, so that the oil does not flow down to the water table. Waste\nlubricating oil contains low-level carcinogens. Care should be taken to prevent skin contact\nwhen handling the waste oil. As the general public is not aware of this danger, it may be better\nto discourage the sale of waste lubricating oil.\n21. Power  station  managers  need  to  be  trained  in  environmentally  acceptable  disposal\nsystems. Probably the simplest method of disposal is to mix waste lubricating oil with diesel fuel\nand utilize it as fuel. Engine manufacturers accept that waste lubricating oil at a maximum rate\nof 5 percent can be mixed with fuel oil. Thus 10 liters of waste lubricating oil can be added to\n200 liters of fuel oil. The mixture should be stirred well, preferably shortly before use. Provision\nhas been made in the project estimates for such training.\n22. Noise. All the power stations in the sample were unnecessarily noisy. Some engines did\nnot even have silencers. Project estimates allow for power stations on the project islands to be\nsealed and noise baffles fitted to air inlets and radiator air outlets, where this is required.\nEstimates allow for providing stainless steel, residential class primary and secondary silencers\non all new engines, and replacing existing silencers that are currently inadequate.", "57\nAppendix 11, page 4\n23. Emissions. The Project will replace old engines that have passed their economic life\nwith new and more efficient engines. This action will reduce exhaust emissions. To further\nreduce emissions, the Project will train the power station managers to monitor diesel engine\nefficiency and system losses. Such monitoring requires simple and inexpensive instrumentation-\nalso provided by the Project - in the power station. Under the Project, exhaust pipes will be\nextended to ensure acceptable dispersal of exhaust gases. Horizontal exhaust pipes will be\nreplaced with vertical exhausts.\n24. Vibration. Ground vibration was not observed to be a problem in any of the power\nstations. All engines are small and have high speed, and vibration will not be a problem.\n25. Fire. Despite overall good housekeeping, the fire risk is unacceptably high as a result of\nthe diesel oil storage practices. Oil and other combustible materials should be stored well away\nfrom the power station building. Under the Project, bulk tanks will be established 5 meters clear\nof the power stations and will be bunded to prevent the spread of burning oil. Storing large\nquantities of oil in a residential area is not acceptable. Additional and larger fire extinguishers\nwill be funded by the Project.\nb. Underground Distribution Cables\n26. No  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  operation  of  underground\ndistribution cables were identified.\nE. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring\n27. The designs to be prepared by the consultants will be submitted for approval to both the\nMaldives Electricity Board (MEB) and MHHE. MHHE will be establishing officers on each atoll to\nmonitor general environmental compliance and provide environmental education. Consultants\nsupervising the contractor will coordinate and cooperate with such officers.\n28. Many  poor  environmental  practices  within  the  electricity  supply  industry  arise  from\ninefficient operation of plants and ignorance of environmentally safe procedures. Under the\nProject, consultants will provide on-site system management and operation training, including\ntraining in efficient plant operation, and environmentally acceptable procedures for oil disposal,\ncleaning up after oil spills, and fire precautions and fire fighting.\n29. MEB regulates a number of issues relating to the environment but at present, it does not\nhave the institutional capacity to monitor compliance in the outer islands. It needs an active\npresence in the islands. To this end, MEB will appoint an inspector in each of the atolls covered\nunder the Project.\nF. Findings\n30. This IEE confirms that all significant adverse environmental impacts associated with\nupgrading the electricity supply systems in the outer islands can be satisfactorily mitigated.\n31. The Project will have a positive impact on the environment as the efficiency of the diesel\nengines will be improved and system losses reduced. Carbon and nitrous oxide emissions will\nbe lessened. The Project will also finance the construction of new powerhouses for some\nislands, with better sites away from village centers, and better noise insulation than in the", "58\nAppendix 11, page 5\nexisting buildings. Furthermore, items proposed to be funded under the Project address issues\nsuch as\n(i) reduction of oil spillage;\n(ii) control of oil spillages that may occur in the vicinity of diesel power\nstations;\n(iii) disposal of waste lubricating oil;\n(iv) reduction of noise;\n(v) dispersal of exhaust gases;\n(vi) minimization of risk; and\n(vii)  training of operators, power station engineers, and directors in\nenvironmentally acceptable practices.\nG. Conclusion\n32. The  IEE  for  the  representative  sample  eight  islands  reveals  no  significant  adverse\nimpact  on  the  environment  that  cannot  be  mitigated.  The  preparation  of  a  detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment is not deemed necessary.", "59\nAppendix 12, page 1\nPOVERTY DIMENSIONS AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\nA. Poverty and Social Characteristics\n1. In 1998, about 42 percent of the population were estimated to live on an income less\nthan  Rf15  ($1.27)  per  person  per  day.1  Although  income  poverty  as  defined  thus  exists\neverywhere in the country, nevertheless the poor are concentrated on certain islands.  The\nGovernment's Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment (VPA) shows that 26 percent of the income\npoor are on 20 islands. Eight of the focus islands to be considered under the Project are the\ngroup of the 20 poorest islands. However, poverty in the Maldives context may differ from that in\nmany other countries. In the Maldives, poverty also means vulnerability to living conditions\nprimarily related to remoteness of islands, lack of services, and limited access to markets.\n2. Although the human development index (HDI) for the Maldives is higher than for all other\nSouth Asian countries except Sri Lanka, social indicators are lower in the outer islands. In 1998,\ninfant mortality rate was estimated at 62 per 1,000 for the Maldives and 69 per 1,000 for the\nouter islands. Overall life expectancy was estimated at 69.6 years for the Maldives and 62 years\nfor the outer islands, with individual outer islands falling in the broad range of 52 years (Raa\nAtoll) and 69 years (Seenu Atoll).  Life expectancy for women was some three years higher than\nfor men.  The adult literacy rate is very high, averaging 98 percent of the adult population, with\nvirtually no difference between rates for Mal\u00e9 and the outer islands and between men and\nwomen. The main educational challenges identified are preeminently qualitative in nature as\nindicated by disparities in the education index between Mal\u00e9 and the outer islands.\n3. The VPA report indicates that there is a large disparity in income and vulnerability\nbetween islands. It tends to be highest in the smallest islands. Overall, 10 percent of the\nnation\u2019s most vulnerable population was found on 45 islands - the majority with relatively small\npopulations - and 20 percent on 90 islands.  Furthermore, the VPA report revealed that some of\nthe targeted project areas2 (six in Baa, two each in Thaa and Raa, and one each in Shaviyani\nand Gaafu Dhaalu) are among the poorest areas in the country.\nB. Social Dimensions\n1. Affordability and Willingness To Pay for Improved Electricity\n4. All  islands  agree  on  the  need  for  an  improved  electricity  supply.  The  demand  for\nimproved electricity is indicated by the expressed willingness to pay higher tariffs for greater\ncapacity and a reliable supply.  However, households currently using less than 10 kilowatt-hours\n(kWh) per month do not have the ability to pay higher tariffs and have less resources to\ngenerate increased income from an improved electricity supply.  The major benefit to these\nhouseholds will occur if improved efficiency results in reduced tariffs. In many islands, the\nProject is expected to lower electricity tariffs in real terms through increased efficiency and\nreduced distribution losses.\n5. Electricity tariffs in the outer islands generally range from Rf3.50 to Rf6.00 per kilowatt-\nhour (kWh). Veyvah island charges a tariff of Rf1.25 per watt of capacity per month, which for a\n                                                \n1 The poverty assessment relied heavily on Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment, 1998, a report prepared by the\nGovernment with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme.\n2  The Government prepared a list of 75 islands from which about 40 islands will be selected for the Project. The\ntargeted project areas refer to these 75 islands.", "60\nAppendix 12, page 2\n40-watt fluorescent tube running four hours a night is equivalent to Rf10 per kWh. High tariffs\nare needed in small systems, and small groups of customers find it difficult to meet the costs of\ncapital-intensive equipment. Average electricity consumption for the majority of the sample\nislands3 is around 25 kWh per month or less, generally the level set for a lifeline tariff.  In\naddition, the lowest quartile on most of the sample islands consume 12 kWh per month.  This\nlowest quartile generally can  afford to pay for its consumption at around 5 percent or less of the\nhousehold income. The poor are paying the full cost of electricity consumption now. In many of\nthe outer islands, the tariff projected under the Project is less than what is being paid in real\nterms now. In many countries, electricity utilities charge for new connections.  This is generally a\nway of meeting the cost of the connection and can be readily identified with each household.\nAmong the sample islands, only Vaikaradhoo charges a connection fee of Rf240.  The majority\nof the beneficiaries recommend that the policy on free connection be continued with all domestic\nconnections.  Free connection removes a considerable burden from the poor, who find it difficult\nto meet the initial capital cost necessary for connection.\n2. Absorptive Capacity of Consumers\n6. Absorptive  capacity  is  demonstrated  by  the  desire  of  the  intended  beneficiaries  to\nupgrade their power supply systems.  More than 90 percent of the populations in the sample\nislands have electricity connection. A good electricity supply for 24 hours a day is a high priority\nfor households with less than 24 hours supply. Where households already have a 24-hour\nsupply, the level of desire for improvements is demonstrated by their stated willingness to spend\nmore  of  their  savings  for  buying  electrical  appliances.  Further  evidence  is  shown  by  the\nconsiderable effort of communities in the sample islands to improve their power supply systems\nthrough communal fund raising activities.\n3. Participatory Approach\n7. Under the sector loan approach, the design and implementation of subprojects will be\nundertaken through participatory consultation at the island level with the administration, island\ndevelopment committees (IDCs), island women's committees (IWCs), and beneficiaries.  The\nProject  will  also  support  awareness  campaigns  and  building  capacity  for  community\nparticipation in design, implementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project\nfacilities. In addition, IDCs, nongovernment organization (NGOs), and other community groups\nwill be supported to enhance their understanding of electricity supply services. Those who run\nelectricity supply systems in the outer islands will be strengthened and trained in management\nto increase their operational efficiencies.\n4. Social Benefit of the Project\n8. The Project will improve electricity supply in the outer islands on a sustainable and\naffordable basis.  Reliable energy supply is essential for sustained improvements in household\nwelfare and as an input to businesses for generating economic growth. For households, a\nreliable  supply  of  electricity  will  create  an  incentive  to  invest  in  productivity-enhancing\nequipment, such as electrical carpentry equipment or fish-processing facilities. For businesses,\na reliable supply of electricity will reduce the production costs for goods and services, and\nimprove other production factors such as labor and natural resources, and thus encourage\nexpansion of businesses. The growth in businesses will have a positive impact on reducing\n                                                \n3  Since it was impractical to select and survey all the islands that will participate in the Project, a representative\nsample of eight islands was selected and studied.", "61\nAppendix 12, page 3\npoverty through increased employment opportunities. Improving the supply of electricity to the\nouter islands supports the Government policy in securing sustainable improvements in living\nstandards and quality of life of the outer island populations so as to achieve balanced regional\ndevelopment and ease the significant population pressures on Mal\u00e9.\n5. Gender Issues and Project Impact on Women\n9. The Project will have a positive impact on the condition of women. Site visits and\ninterviews indicate that improved quality of electricity supply will benefit general family welfare,\nparticularly of women.  Where there is sufficient disposable income for electrical appliances, the\nincreased use of flatirons and washing machines will lighten women's domestic workload. A\nreliable electricity supply will also create more home-based income-generating opportunities for\nwomen  such  as  rope  making  in  the  evening.    For  higher  income  households,  increased\navailability  of  electricity  will  provide  opportunities  for  increased  household  income  through\nactivities such as sewing and production of freezer goods.  In one island visited, women were\nconsidering putting up  computer and fax services should the electricity supply improve.\n6. Land Acquisition for New Powerhouse\n10. The  Project  involves  no  resettlement  and,  if  land  is  required,  the  Government  will\nallocate lands that will not involve settlement. Existing powerhouses will be used wherever\npossible. New powerhouses, if any, will be small, and for the most part will not require land\nexceeding 400 square meters. An assessment of the sample islands indicated that none of\nthem would require land for a new powerhouse. There is no private land ownership in the\nMaldives and all lands belong to the Government, and atoll chiefs have the authority to allocate\nland up to 400 square meters for public use. Reflecting the importance the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) places on careful and effective implementation of land acquisition, receipt from\nappropriate authorities of approval of the allocation of government-owned land, and confirmation\nthat no resettlement of people or impact on livelihoods is involved will be the conditions for\napproving subprojects under the Project.\n7. Project Benefit and Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation\n11. Benefit  and  poverty  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BPME)  of  the  subprojects  will  be\nundertaken in collaboration with stakeholders and beneficiaries in each subproject area. The\nBPME design will be finalized by consultants to be engaged for the Project and with advisory\ninputs from stakeholders and beneficiaries. Before construction for the subprojects, baseline\nsurveys will be carried out in the subproject area as part of the social assessment, and benefits\ngenerated during the Project will be measured against these initial data. Stakeholders and\nbeneficiaries will also be involved in the monitoring. Under the Project, the Ministry of Planning\nand National Development (MPND) will develop a reporting framework to allow preparation of\nthe necessary information for the BPME program. BPME as part of a management information\nsystem (MIS) will give the Government a detailed overview of the demand for and constraints to\nelectricity supply services in the outer islands. Poverty impact monitoring and evaluation will be\npart of BPME and will be administered by MPND. This component will be implemented in\ncoordination with atoll and island offices, IDCs, IWCs, NGOs, and other beneficiaries.  It will\nhelp to establish the baseline profile of the poverty situation in the sample islands, establish\nqualitative and quantitative monitoring indicators and mechanisms, and monitor project activities\nand their impacts (both positive and adverse) on the sample islands.", "62\nAppendix 12, page 4\nC. Poverty Targeting\n12. The Project is expected to cover 17 out of 20 atolls in the country. In 17 atolls, about 40\nislands will be selected. Poverty reduction will be an active objective in selecting the islands.\nPoverty targeting of the island will also consider the poverty and vulnerability criteria developed\nby the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The criteria are education, health,\nfood  security,  employment  opportunities,  access  to  electricity,  sum  of  human  vulnerability\nindices,  non-income  vulnerability  index,  income  poverty  index,  and  composite  human\nvulnerability index.\nD. Estimated Impact on Poverty\n13. ADB\u2019s new focus on poverty reduction underscores the need for carrying out benefit\ndistribution and poverty impact analysis for projects. Such analysis adds significant values to\neconomic analysis of projects as it (i) enables stakeholders to identify and quantify all direct and\nindirect  project  benefits  accruing  to  different  project  stakeholders  such  as  Government,\nelectricity service providers, and consumers; (ii) quantifies the net benefits that go to project\nparticipants living below the poverty line, which enables stakeholders to check if the project\ndesign  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  poverty  reduction;  and  (iii)  enables\nstakeholders to check on how the changes in government policies will affect the beneficiaries,\nparticularly the low-income households.\n14. The geographic coverage and the selection criteria for island participants ensure that the\nProject will provide electricity in the outer islands where the majority of the country's poor reside.\nBased on an analysis of the sample islands, it is estimated that the Project will directly benefit\nabout 45,000 people, about 50 percent of whom are poor.4\n15. Four main stakeholders were identified: household consumers, light/home industries,\nlocal  government,  and  power  supply  utilities,  among  whom  the  projected  benefits  were\nallocated.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  report  indicated  that  all\nstakeholders are the net gainers. The largest beneficiaries of the Project are laborers, followed\nby consumers, and power supply utilities as well as the general economy.  All net gains to\nlaborers and consumers come from reliable access to electricity, lower electricity tariffs, more\nemployment opportunities, all leading to a higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate.\nThe consumers will also benefit directly from the Project through the increased operating life of\nelectrical appliances.\n16. The economic impacts of power projects are generally a more reliable electricity supply,\nincreased efficiency, more employment opportunities (including O&M of power supply systems),\nall leading to a higher GDP growth rate.  An underlying objective of the Project is to give poor\nhouseholds and communities in outer islands better and reliable access to electricity. This\nintervention  will  have  important  and  direct  effects  on  the  welfare  of  the  poor.  The  direct\neconomic opportunities for the poor can be in (i) easier establishment and greater productivity of\nbusinesses that employ the poor, (ii) creation of employment in infrastructure service delivery,\nand  (iii)  improved  health  and  education  and  savings  in  time  and  effort  that  will  increase\nindividual productivity.\n17. With a more reliable electricity supply, outer island communities will receive non-financial\nbenefits as well. Reliable and extended hours of electricity supply will allow them to put electric\n                                                \n4 Head count ratio, percentage of the population with less than Rf15.0 ($1.27) per person per day (VPA, 1998).", "63\nAppendix 12, page 5\nlighting in schools, or refrigerators in community health clinics, access electricity for lighting, or\nuse electrical appliances for household businesses. The Project is expected to facilitate the\ndevelopment of other basic infrastructure such as better health, education, and information\ncommunication facilities, thereby improving access to and productivity in the labor market. The\nindirect effects of improved access to electricity services will also arise from two sources:\nimproved efficiency of the sector and the economy, which increases total wealth, and the\nrelease of more funds for other activities. These indirect effects will benefit the poor both as\nmembers of society and as consumers.\n18.    A  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR),  expressing  the  proportion  of  net  economic  benefits\naccruing to the poor, was calculated by comparing the net economic benefits to the poor with\nthe net economic benefits to the economy as a whole. The TA report indicated that the GDP of\nthe poor in the focus islands is approximately 11 percent of the total GDP of the country.  This\nimplies that the Project will have a positive poverty reduction impact when PIR exceeds 11\npercent. The TA report confirmed that the poverty reduction impact will be significant since the\nPIR averages 32 percent for the Project as a whole, and exceeds 11 percent in all islands that\nwere selected for evaluation of the Project.", "64\nAppendix 13, page 1\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\nA.  Project Basis\n1. The Project for electrification of the outer islands in the Maldives will provide assistance\nto expand power supply systems, and in some cases to replace them completely, on about 40\nof the outer islands. The Project will provide improved power supply to about 8,500 households\nwith a population of about 45,000. Since it was impractical to survey all the islands that will\nparticipate in the Project, a representative sample of eight islands in Haa Dhaalu atoll, Shaviyani\natoll in the north and in Meemu atoll in the south-central part of the Maldives was selected.\nUnder the project preparatory technical assistance (TA), these islands were surveyed in detail to\ndetermine the condition of the existing power supply system, the local economy, expected load\ngrowth, the requirements for improving the power supply; and to prepare plans for expanding\nthe  power  supply  on  each  island.  The  ADB  Mission  also  visited  these  islands.  The\nrepresentative islands are listed in Table A13.1.\nTable A13.1:  Representative Outer  Islands\nExisting Power System in 2000\nPopulation Generating Electricity Average Availability\nin 2000 Capacity Sales Tariff (h/day)\nIsland Atoll (kW) (MWh/yr) (Rf/kWh)\nNeykurendhoo Haa Dhaalu 940 55 34 5.00 14\nNolhivaramu Haa Dhaalu 1,553 116 62 6.00 20\nVaikaradhoo Haa Dhaalu 1,210 110 128 4.00 24\nFunadhoo Shaviyani 1,107 129 123 4.00 24\nMulah Meemu 1,208 188 175 3.50 24\nMuli Meemu 789 176 169 4.00 24\nNaalaafushi Meemu 394 68 24 6.00 18\nVeyvah Meemu 182 21 10 10.00 12\nkW = kilowatt, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MWh = megawatt-hour.\n2. Each island already has some form of public power supply, which is owned and operated\nin  most  cases  by  the  local  island  development  committee  (IDC).  On  one  island,  a  local\nnongovernment organization (NGO) that is closely associated with the IDC owns and operates the\npower supply system. These power supply systems serve almost all the households on each\nisland, except for a few households. Many outer islands have power supply 24 hours a day, but\nsome have service only at night. Most electricity consumption is for residential use, but also\nincludes small shops that are usually integrated with the households. Government and public\nfacilities (local schools, local government offices, etc.) compose the other major consumer group.\nThere is also some commercial consumption on the larger islands.\n3. Load forecasts were prepared for each island, starting from the existing level of sales. The\nforecast model is based primarily on forecast future per capita consumption growth rates and\npopulation growth rates. Some islands have high planned population growth due to plans to\nresettle people from the smaller islands to the larger islands. Per capita consumption growth rates\nare adjusted for each island also based on historic trends, expected improvements in reliability of", "65\nAppendix 13, page 2\npower supply, tariff reductions in some cases, and comparisons with average consumption rates\non comparable islands. An example of a load forecast and generation expansion plan for one\nisland is shown in Table A13.2.\n4. The existing power supply systems in most cases are not very reliable.  Generating units\nare often old, with poor fuel efficiency; generating capacity is inadequate at times, especially\nwhen a unit is out of service. Distribution losses are often high due to old cables that are in\nmany cases undersized for current loads. The planned power system improvements for many\nislands will involve replacing inefficient generating units with new diesel generator sets, and in\nsome cases replacing inefficient and undersized distribution systems. In other cases, only\nadditional generator capacity and upgrading of distribution systems are required. For isolated\nsystems of this size, the least costly way of supplying power is from diesel generators. Other\nforms of generating power, such as combined cycle or thermal steam, are not economic or\npractical for the small generating units required by these islands. Generation from renewable\nenergy - photovoltaic solar or wind power - is much more costly than diesel generation, with the\naverage cost per kWh about 10 times higher than for diesel energy.\nB.  Economic Benefits of Improved Power Supply\n5. Economic benefits resulting from improved electricity supply under the Project are an\nincrease in total electricity generation, sales, and consumption on these islands; improved\nefficiency  of  existing  power  supply  systems  and  reduced  distribution  system  losses;  and\nimproved efficiency of fuel consumption in diesel generating sets, resulting in reduced total fuel\nconsumption, due both to reduced distribution losses and improved fuel efficiency in generation\nEach category is evaluated in the following sections.\n1. Economic Benefits of Electricity Consumption\n6. Residential consumers, who account for most electricity sales, use electricity for lighting\nprimarily, and for radio, television, fans, washing machines, electric irons, etc. Electricity is not\nused for cooking, since firewood is generally available on most islands. In cases where firewood is\nnot available, kerosene is still much cheaper than electricity for cooking. An upper limit on the\nvalue of electricity used for lighting is the alternative cost of kerosene lighting, which is equivalent\nto about Rf10/kilowatt-hour (kWh). The additional or induced electricity consumption for residential\nconsumers is valued on the basis of the average willingness to pay for electricity based on a\ndemand vs price curve that was derived from data for various islands in the survey.  The average\ntariffs and electricity sales in these islands vary over a wide range, and formed an excellent basis\nfor plotting a demand curve for electricity consumption, based on regression analysis,1 which is\nshown in Figure A13.1. The average willingness to pay under this demand curve is Rf7.00/kWh\nfor a tariff rate of Rf3.86/kWh (the expected average tariff in future) and household consumption of\n43 kWh per month. With lower tariffs and higher levels of average consumption, the average\neconomic value of consumption will be less. These values are in local economic prices, at year\n2001 price levels.\n                  \n1 The regression analysis assumed a constant price elasticity of power demand, and was also adjusted for average\nhousehold income levels. The resulting fit was very good, with R2  of .986. The price elasticity of average electricity\nuse per household was found to be -1.36.", "66\nAppendix 13, page 3\nFigure A13.1:  Electricity Demand in Maldives Outer Islands\n12\n10\nh) 8\nW\nk\nRf/ 6\n(\nf \nf\nari 4\nT\n2\n0\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nSales (kWh/month/house)\n7. To  evaluate  the  economic  benefits  of  increased  electricity  supply,  the  dependable\ncapacity, and sales level of the existing power systems were determined first.  Then the additional\nsales due to the new project were calculated, and valued at the unit rates described in para. 6.\n8. The economic analysis did not attempt to evaluate the benefits of improved reliability and\nquality of power supply. Adequate voltage levels are important for starting fluorescent lights, and\nfor operating such lights and appliances such as televisions sets, etc. They are valuable, both for\nincreased user satisfaction and for increased appliance lifetimes, but it is difficult to measure these\nbenefits due to lack of data on operating statistics, and to convert this to economic terms.\nHowever, in discussions with local IDCs, dissatisfaction was often expressed with the poor quality\nand reliability of the existing power supply. Electricity use will also have important nonquantifiable\nbenefits by increasing the total hours of useful time in the evening for study, social interaction, and\nentertainment,  and  it  generally  results  in  improved  health  standards.  In  view  of  these\nnonquantifiable benefits, which are not included in the economic evaluation, the minimum required\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for each subproject is set at 10 percent.\n2. Economic Evaluation of Efficiency Improvements\n9. The proposed Project will also improve the operating efficiency of power supply operations\nfor the existing loads and consumption level.  This is due to improved fuel efficiency with new\ngenerating  units,  reduced  consumption  of  lubrication  oil,  and  reduced  annual  repair  and\nmaintenance costs. Upgrading or replacing distribution systems will also reduce total distribution\nsystem losses, which are rather high now on some islands. In some cases, the Project will also\nfinance replacement of all old fluorescent light fixtures on an island and install modern new\nelectronic ballasts so as to improve low power factors and reduce distribution losses. These\nefficiency improvements are valued at the economic cost savings they achieve. An example of\nthis evaluation for the island of Vakairadhoo is shown in Table A13.3.", "67\nAppendix 13, page 4\n3. Evaluation of Costs\n10. The economic evaluation uses domestic prices at 2001 levels for both costs and benefits.\nEconomic costs exclude duties and taxes on imported materials and equipment, but the border\nprices for imported supplies, equipment, and fuel are converted to local domestic prices by\ndividing by the standard conversion factor of 0.90. The cost of crude oil is assumed to remain at\ncurrent prices, $25/barrel Free On Board (FOB) Singapore, at year 2001 price levels. This is a\nconservative assumption, inasmuch as the last World Bank commodity price forecast expects a\nreal decline in future oil prices.2 The resulting diesel fuel prices are Rf4.50/liter. The useful\neconomic lifetime for the new power supply equipment is assumed to be 7 years for small high-\nspeed  diesel  generating  sets,  and  20  years  for  the  underground  distribution  cables.  Diesel\ngenerating sets need to be replaced when they reach the end of this lifetime.\n11. The total investment required to improve power supply and meet the load growth for the\nperiod up to 2005 (inclusive) for the six representative islands evaluated for this Project would be\n$1.2 million in base costs, which is equivalent to an average investment of about $180 per person\nserved. This compares with an average per capita cash income on the outer islands of about\n$800 annually.\nC. Results of Economic Analysis\n12. A detailed plan and economic evaluation was prepared for each of the eight representative\nislands. Tables A13.2 and A13.3 show the data for Vaikaradhoo. The Fact-Finding Mission found\ntwo islands not suitable for inclusion in the Project, even though the consultant had included them\nin the TA study. For Naalaafushi, a new generating unit was recently installed, and no more\ncapacity is needed for the planned duration of the Project up to 2005.  For Veyvah, the island is\nvery small, and with a reduced and more realistic forecast of load growth, it was not economically\nfeasible  to  expand  power  supply  to  a  high  standard.  On  the  remaining  six  islands,  it  is\neconomically and financially feasible to improve power supply. The EIRR for each island is\nsummarized in Table A13.4. The average EIRR for all six islands (based on the consolidated net\ncash flow stream for all islands) will be 19.4 percent.\nTable A13.4:  Summary of Project Economics\nProjected\nProject Current Tariffsa\nIsland Investment Tariffs In 2006 EIRR FIRR\n(Rf million) (Rf/kWh) (Rf/kWh) (%) (%)\nNeykurendhoo 3.25 5.00 5.01 13.3 6.1\nNolhivaramu 1.38 6.00 3.92 16.9 2.1\nVaikaradhoo 1.88 4.00 3.53 17.0 2.8\nFunadhoo 3.49 4.00 3.33 24.9 1.2\nMulah 2.25 3.50 3.33 16.2 1.2\nMuli 3.25 4.00 3.53 22.7 6.1\nAverage 4.06 3.55 19.4 3.4\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = Financial internal rate of return, kWh = kilowatt-hour.\na \nAdjusted to constant 2001 price levels.\n                  \n2 The most recent World Bank commodity price forecast, in April 2001, forecasts future crude oil prices of $20/barrel\nby 2003, $18/barrel by 2005, and $19/barrel by 2010, all in current dollars.", "68\nAppendix 13, page 5\n13. Sensitivity analysis, conducted for the scenarios shown in Table A13.5, indicates that the\neconomic performance of the Project is robust for increases in fuel costs or in capital costs.\nFuture crude oil prices are rather uncertain; nevertheless, the Project can tolerate a doubling of\noil prices and still remain economic. The project economics are most sensitive to reductions in\nestimated  unit  benefits  or  in  total  energy  sales.  The  Project  would  switch  to  becoming\nuneconomic if average benefit rates for new sales were reduced more than 32 percent, based\non a minimum 10 percent EIRR, or if total energy sales were reduced by more than 30 percent,\nwithout considering a corresponding reduction in planned development of the power supply\nsystems. Such large variations are considered unlikely.\nTable A13.5:  Sensitivity Analysis\nScenario EIRR SI FIRR SI\n(%)  (%)\nBase case 19.4 \u2013 3.4 \u2013\nFuel costs increased by 10% 18.9 .05 2.3 .11\nAll capital costs increased by 10% 17.7 .17 2.1 .13\nAverage benefits reduced by 10% 16.8 .26 0.8 .26\nEnergy sales reduced by 10% 16.1 .33 1.0 .24\nEIRR - Economic internal rate of return, FIRR = Financial internal rate of return., SI = Ratio of percentage change\nin the EIRR to the percentage change in the given parameter.\nD. Financial Evaluation of the Project\n14. The financial evaluation differs from the economic in that financial prices are used for all\nproject costs, which include duties and taxes on capital costs and fuel costs. Project benefits are\nbased on the financial revenues from additional electricity sales due to the Project, starting in\n2003, and from the savings in operating costs due to efficiency improvements. It is assumed\nthat electricity tariffs will be reduced on each island, as shown in Figures A13.2 and A13.3, so\nthat each island will achieve cash breakeven, including payment of debt-service costs. The\noverall tariff rate in real prices (adjusted for inflation) is expected to decline by about 13 percent\nby 2006. The resulting financial internal rates of return (FIRR) for each island are shown in\nTable A13.4. The average FIRR for the overall project is estimated to be 3.4 percent in real\nterms, without inflation. The FIRR is relatively low because tariffs on each island will be kept as\nlow as possible, while maintaining cash breakeven. However, the FIRR is still higher than the\nweighted average cost of capital of 2.8 percent in real terms (net of inflation).\n15. The Project's financial feasibility is more robust to changes in the main variables than\nindicated in the sensitivity analysis (Table A13.5). In the event of an unexpected increase in\nproject capital costs, or fuel costs, or change in forecast sales, the average tariff could be\nadjusted to achieve a satisfactory financial rate of return. In the case of crude oil prices higher\nthan $25 per barrel, average tariffs would have to increase about $0.0025 for each $1 per barrel\nin oil costs. A large tariff increase would in turn have some impact on load growth, but if\nexpansion plans are adjusted for this, the longer term impacts can be accommodated.", "Table A13.2: Subproject Load Forecast and Power System Development Plan for Vaikaradhoo, 2000-2010 \nName of supplier:  Vinares Power House, Dharuma, Vaikaradhoo (NGO)\nSystem 230/400 Earthed neutral\nDistribution Low voltage underground, diesel generation\nTariff Rf4 per unit flat\nHours of service 24 hours\nLoad Forecast and Diesel Generating Units Required\nItem 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nGenerated Units kWh    163,893    180,185    201,379    192,995    211,934    231,105    250,234    269,025    287,162    304,316    324,053\nSales Plus Streetlights kWh    128,311    141,066    157,075    173,696    190,741    207,994    225,211    242,123    258,446    273,884    291,647\nGrowth Rate Sales  % 15% 13% 12% 11% 10% 9% 8% 7% 6% 6% 5%\nLosses kWh      35,582      39,119      44,303      19,300      21,193      23,110      25,023      26,903      28,716      30,432      32,405\nLosses % of Generation % 22% 22% 22% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10%\nAnnual Peak Load kW 39 43 48 45 50 54 58 62 66 69 74\nAnnual Load Factor % 48% 48% 48% 49% 49% 49% 49% 50% 50% 50% 50%\nInstalled Capacity:\nEngine No. 1 Cummins 4BT3.9-G1 40 40 40\nEngine No. 2 Cummins 4B3.9-G 29.6 29.6 29.6\nEngine No. 3 Cummins 4BT3.9-G1 40 40 40 40 40 40\n6\nProposed Project 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 9\nProposed Project 40 40 40 40 40 40 40\nProposed 40 40 40 40 40\nProposed   40 40 40\nProposed 40\nProposed 40\n0\nTotal Capacity kW 110 110 110 120 120 120 120 120 160 160 160\nFirm Capacity kW 56 56 56 64 64 64 64 64 96 96 96\nSpare Capacity kW 17 13 8 19 14 10 6 2 30 27 22\nAnnual Fuel Oil Consumption  Liters 62,662 61,263 68,469 59,829 65,700 71,642 77,573 83,398 89,020 94,338 100,456\nFuel Oil Specific Efficiency Liter/kWh 0.34 0.34 0.34 0.31 0.31 0.31 0.31 0.31 0.31 0.31 0.31\nAnnual Lube Oil Consumption  Liters 656 721 806 579 636 693 751 807 861 913 972\nA\nLube Oil Specific Efficiency  Liter/kWh 0.004 0.004 0.004 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003\np\nNo. of Employees 9 9 9 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 p\ne\nkWh Sold per Employee kWh 14,257 15,674 17,453 57,899 63,580 69,331 75,070 80,708 86,149 91,295 97,216 n\nd\nNumber of Consumers 229 235 240 246 252 258 264 271 277 284 290 ix\n \nPopulation 1,210 1,239 1,269 1,299 1,330 1,362 1,394 1,428 1,462 1,497 1,532 1\n3\nDemand/Customer Watts 170 182 198 184 197 208 219 229 238 245 253 ,\n \np\nConsumption/Head kWh/pa 104 114 124 134 143 153 162 170 177 183 190 a\ng\nGrowth Consumption/Head  % 10% 9.5% 8.75% 8.00% 7.25% 6.50% 6% 5% 4% 4% 4% e\n \n6", "Table A13.3:  Subproject Economic and Financial Analyses for Vaikaradhoo, 2000-2010\n (Rf' 000 in constant 2001 prices, except as noted)\nItem 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nBenefits\nIncremental Sales (MWh)           -
