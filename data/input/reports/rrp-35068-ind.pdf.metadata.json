It will enable people\nto  rebuild,  to  resume  their  normal  lives  by  restoring\navailability  of  basic  services  such  as  drinking  water  and\nelectricity,  provide  housing  to  mitigate  homelessness,\nand foster economic opportunities.\n\nThe  intensity  of  the  earthquake  resulted  in  a  major\ncatastrophy  with  severe  impact  on  the  local  population.\nThe  quake,  which  was  the  worst  on  record  for  the  past\nhalf century, caused more than 19,000 confirmed deaths,\nabout 200,000 injured and up to 1.7 million homeless. In\naddition,  the  quake  completely  destroyed  300,000  and\ndamaged more than 600,000 dwelling units and much of\nthe  power,  water  supply,  and  sanitation  systems  in  the\naffected areas.\n\nBecause  the  quake\u2019s  epicenter  was  in  the  Kachchh\ndistrict  of  Gujarat,  the  impact  on  people\u2019s  lives  and\neconomic activity was even greater, as this was the fifth\nmajor disaster to strike the northeastern part of Gujarat in\nthe  past  four  years.  The  four  preceding  events  include\ntwo  cyclones  and  two  severe  droughts,  the  second  of\nwhich  is  still  causing  major  distress  to  the  poorest\nregions  in  the  state.  Therefore,  the  economic  resilience\nof  the  Government  of  Gujarat  (GOG)  and  civil  society\nwere already depleted and the estimated $2.3 billion cost\nof  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  basic  services,\nfurther  $1  billion-$1.5  billion  of\ntogether  with \neconomic  damage  due  to  loss  of  production  and  lower\nfiscal revenues, would be impossible for the state to bear\nwithout  assistance.  By  providing  financing  for  the  most\nurgently  needed  components  and  works,  the  loan  will\nenable  GOG \nthe  overall\nreconstruction  program,  as  well  as  help  to  restore  the\neconomic activity essential for survival of residents in the\nheavily affected areas.\n\nfinance  a  portion  of \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  support  GOG\u2019s\nefforts to reconstruct and restore essential infrastructure\ndamaged  in  the  affected  areas  of  the  State,  especially\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n\fii\n\nand\nJamnagar,  Kachchh,  Patan,  Rajkot, \nthe \nSurendranagar districts. This is essential to enable early\nrestoration of economic and social activity in the affected\nareas,  especially  for  the  poor.  The  Project  will  focus  on\nthe highest priority areas, identified through consultations\nwith  GOG,  public  and  private  sector,  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), and other civil society.\n\nThe Project will have the following parts.\n\nPart A: Housing. Assistance will be for reconstruction of\nresidential  houses,  focusing  on  rural  areas  and  the\npoorer sections of the population.\n\nPart B: Urban and Rural Infrastructure. Work will focus\non  urban  and  rural  water  supply,  sewerage,  sanitation,\ndrainage,  civic  buildings,  staff  quarters,  electrification,\nand lighting; and the development of sites and services.\n\nPart  C:  Power.  Substations, \nlines,\ndistribution  systems,  staff  quarters,  administrative  and\nrelated  buildings,  switch  gear  and  transformers,  control\nsystems and related equipment will be rehabilitated.\n\ntransmission \n\nlivelihood  projects \n\nPart  D:  Livelihood  Rehabilitation.

Since  a  sector  approach  is  being  followed,\nthe cost estimates are on a sectoral basis.\n\nItems\nPart A: Housing\nPart B: Urban and Rural Infrastructure\nPart C: Power\nPart D: Livelihood Rehabilitation\nPart E: Consulting  Services  and  Incremental\n\nAdministrative Support\n\nand Mitigation\nFront-End Fee\n\nTotal\n\n           ($million)\nADB GOG Total\n250\n50\n200\n217\n44\n173\n98\n31\n67\n20\n0\n20\n15\n0\n15\n\n      5\n500\n\n      0\n125\n\n     5\n 625\n\nPart F: Multihazard  Disaster  Preparedness\n\n20\n\n0\n\n20\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n\fLoan Amount and Terms\n\niii\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\n30 June 2004\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nGOG  and  Gujarat  State  Disaster  Management  Authority\n(GSDMA).\n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nA  loan  of  $500  million  is  proposed  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary\ncapital  resources  with  a  term  of  30  years  including  a  7-\nyear grace period. It will carry an interest rate determined\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable  lending\nrate system for US dollar loans, and applicable charges.\nThe  Borrower  will  pay  to  ADB  a  front-end  fee  in  an\namount equal to one percent of the loan amount.\n\nresponsible \n\nOverall  coordination  and  guidance  will  be  provided  by\nGSDMA.  GSDMA  will  also  be \nfor\ncoordinating  assistance  provided  by  other  multilateral\nand  bilateral  development  institutions,  other  aid  and\ndonor agencies, the private sector, and NGOs. A project\nmanagement  and  coordination  unit  (PMCU)  will  act  on\nbehalf  of  GSDMA  as  the  Executing  Agency  on  routine\nmatters  and  have  decision-making  authority  to  facilitate\nproject  implementation.  The  PMCU  in  conjunction  with\nImplementing  Agencies  (IAs)  and \nthe  participating\ndistricts,  cities,  and  towns  will  prioritize  and  select\nsubprojects  under  the  Project.  The  PMCU  will  be\nsupported  by  project  management  consultants  providing\nspecialized  technical  support  and  advice  on  earthquake\nand  other  natural  calamities\u2019  engineering, \nfinancial\nmanagement  and  accounting,  beneficiary  participation,\nbenefit monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building.\n\nAn  IA  will  be  appointed  for  each  of  the  key  sectors\nincluded  under  the  Project  reporting  to  the  PMCU  of\nGSDMA.  The  prioritization,  technical  preparation,  and\nimplementation of the eligible subprojects will be carried\nout by the respective IAs.  In particular, the Panchayats,\nRural Housing, and Rural Development Department (part\nA);  Gujarat  Urban  Development  Company  and  the\nGujarat  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Board  (part  B);\nGujarat Electricity Board (part C); and the Department of\nSocial Justice and Empowerment and the Industries and\nMines  Department  (part  D)  will  be  the  IAs  for  the\nrespective  project  components.  Part  E  will  entail\nmanagement and technical support to the PMCU and the\nIAs for smooth and efficient implementation including the\ndesign,  procurement,  quality  control,  accounting,\nmonitoring,  and  reporting  requirements  for  the  Project.\nPart  F  will  provide  support  for  establishing  an  effective\nmultihazard  disaster  preparedness  and  mitigation\nprogram.\n\nProcurement\n\nProcurement of goods and services to be financed by the\nProject  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\n\n\fiv\n\nGuidelines for Procurement.  Since the value of contracts\nwill be relatively small and scattered over a wide range of\nthe affected areas of Gujarat, they are not likely to attract\ninternational suppliers. The equipment and materials will\nneed to be delivered in as short a time period as possible\ndue to the urgent nature of the Project. The tight delivery\nschedules would be unattractive to international suppliers\nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.\nThese  will  therefore  be  procured  through  international\nshopping  for  goods  not  readily  available  in  India,  and\nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures \nfor  goods\nmanufactured in India. This will not preclude international\nsuppliers from bidding through their local outlets.\n\nAll consultants will be engaged by the PMCU and the IAs\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nfor the engagement of domestic consultants.\n\nConsulting Services and\nTechnical Support\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\n31 December 2003\n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries Considering the extent of damage, the costs of rebuilding\nhouses and infrastructure facilities are exorbitant both for\naffected  households  and  for  the  state.  Support  both  in\nterms  of  financial  assistance  as  well  as  improved\nearthquake  resistant  technology  will  be  of  considerable\nbenefit  in  protecting  the  poor  and  affected  people  from\nfalling  further  into  poverty.  It  will  help  families  resettle,\nprovide  a  safer  and  healthier  environment,  and  stabilize\nlivelihoods.\n\nThe  rehabilitation  of  urban  and  rural  infrastructure,\nparticularly water supply and sanitation, will facilitate the\nprovision  of  drinking  water,  reduce  risk  of  health-related\nproblems,  and  improve  the  quality  of  life.  Support  for\nphysical  reconstruction  in  key  sectors  like  power  would\nhave positive secondary effects in reviving industries and\nagriculture.  By  rehabilitating  public  and  community\ninfrastructure, the Project will help restore economic and\nsocial activities disrupted by the disaster.\n\nThe  Project  envisages  livelihood  restoration  that  could\nhelp  prevent  the  current  adverse  effects  of  the  disaster\non  the  affected  poor.  Livelihoods  have  been  badly\naffected and this, along with the destruction of household\ninvestments,  has  been  draining  meager  household\nsavings and adversely impacting on levels of income and\ncapability  poverty  in  the  region.  The  possibility  of  an\nadverse \nterms  of  reduced  consumption,\nmigration,  and  increased  child  labor  in  poor  families  is\nincreasing.  The  rehabilitation  works  will  entail  labor\nintensive  civil  works  contracts,  using  unskilled  and\n\nimpact \n\nin \n\n\fProposed Technical Assistance\n\nv\n\nsemiskilled  local  labor,  thereby  providing  employment\nopportunities  for  the  poor.  Livelihood  rehabilitation  for\nlocal  artisans,  craftsmen,  and  self-employed  people  in\nthe  affected  area  will  facilitate  recovery  of  the  local\neconomy, thereby restoring more long-term employment\nopportunities for them. The training envisaged for various\ncategories  of  skills  will  help  in  the  economic  and  social\nrehabilitation  of  the  severely  affected  classes  like  the\nphysically  disabled  persons  and  widowed  women.  The\nbenefits  of  the  Project  will  be  evident  through  economic\nrehabilitation  arising \nfrom  speedy  reconstruction  of\ninfrastructure  and  facilities,  and  livelihood  restoration  in\nthe earthquake-affected areas.\n\nA  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for\nEarthquake  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  of\nHousing, is proposed to support the State\u2019s Panchayats,\nRural  Housing  and  Rural  Development  Department\n(PRHD) and the Urban Development and Urban Housing\nimplementing  GOG\u2019s\nDepartment \nin \nearthquake-damaged\nreconstruction \nhousing.\n\nprogram \n\n(UDHD) \n\nfor \n\nin \n\nThe cost of the TA is estimated at $1,650,000 equivalent,\nforeign  exchange  cost  and\nincluding  $480,000 \n$1,170,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will\nprovide  $1,300,000  equivalent  to  fund  the  entire  foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $820,000  equivalent  of  the  local\ncurrency cost on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA\nprogram.  The  Government  and  GOG  will  contribute\n$350,000 equivalent in kind.\n\n\fvi\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan  to  India  for  the  Gujarat  Earthquake  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project,  and  (ii)\nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Earthquake  Rehabilitation  and\nReconstruction of Housing.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn 26 January 2001, the state of Gujarat was struck by an earthquake of 6.9 magnitude\n2.\non the Richter scale (measured by the Indian Meteorological Department (cid:190)\n 7.7 as measured by\nthe United States [US] Geological Survey). The earthquake(cid:190)\nthe strongest in the region in the\npast  half  century  (cid:190) has  caused  a  large  number  of  fatalities  and  extensive  and  widespread\ndamage to physical and social infrastructure. On 29 January 2001, the Government of India (the\nGovernment) requested urgent assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other\nmultilateral  institutions  for  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  affected  areas.  ADB\nresponded promptly by offering the possibility of immediate assistance to Gujarat by reallocating\nproceeds of existing loans and providing a new loan (para. 42). ADB fielded a Mission starting\n12 February 2001 to prepare a proposal for ADB financial assistance.1 The Mission concurrently\nundertook assessment of the earthquake damage as part of the Joint World Bank-ADB Mission,\nwith participation from US Agency for International Development and the Netherlands Embassy\nin Delhi, and prepared a strategy for rehabilitation and reconstruction. Following the conclusion\nof  the  Joint  Mission  on  24  February,  the  ADB  Mission  completed  appraisal  of  the  proposed\nProject on 28 February 2001.\n\n3.\nThe missions undertook field visits, met with affected people, senior government officials\nat  the  central  and  state  levels,  and  representatives  of  United  Nations  (UN)  Agencies,  and\ninteracted  with  representatives  from  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  industry,  and  civil\nsociety  at  large.  This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  ADB  Mission.  The  proposed  ADB\nassistance, with assistance expected from other international and bilateral financing agencies, is\nin accordance with the state government of Gujarat\u2019s (GOG) overall recovery strategy, the time\nframe for assistance, as well as the state\u2019s absorptive capacity.\n\nA. \n\nNatural Disasters in India\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\n4.\nWith  its  vast  territory  and  varied  geoclimatic  conditions,  the  Indian  subcontinent  is\nexposed  to  frequent  natural  calamities,  including  cyclones,  floods,  and  earthquakes,  which\n\n                                                \n1 The  Mission  comprised  K.  Gerhaeusser,  Senior  Programs  Officer,  PW2  (Mission  Leader);  M.  Alam,  Project\nImplementation  Officer,  INRM;  A.  Guha,  Project  Implementation  Officer,  INRM;  A.  Jorgensen,  Senior  Project\nImplementation  Officer,  INRM;  H.  Mukhopadhyay,  Economist,  INRM;  N.  Patel,  Senior  Project  Specialist,  IWOD;\nV.S.  Rekha,  Counsel,  OGC  (24-28  February);  V.V.  Subramanian,  Investment  Officer,  INRM,  13-22  and  28\nFebruary);  S.  Vishwanathan,  Social  Economist,  INRM;  and  J.  Weinstock,  Senior  Poverty  Reduction  Specialist,\nOESD (12-19 February). Y. Iwasaki, Director, PWD, F. Polman, Resident Representative, INRM, and A. Thapan,\nManager, AWWU held discussions in India during 8-12 February 2001 with officials of the Government of India and\nthe  Government  of  Gujarat  (GOG)  as  well  as  with  the  World  Bank.  R.  Nag,  Deputy  Director,  PWD  joined  the\nMission in meetings with GOG and the Government during 21-24 February. Further assistance was also provided\nby T. Kondo, Manager, IWTC; S. Chander, Senior Project Engineer, IWEN; M. Hamano, Project Engineer, IWEN;\nand V.B. Tulasidhar, until recently Senior Economist in INRM. The Mission was joined by J. Parker, A. Rego, and\nR.  Sharpe,  ADB  TA  consultants \nfor  disaster  management  and  earthquake  engineering,  during\n12-19 February 2001.\n\n\faffect large numbers of the population. While vulnerability varies from region to region, a large\npart of the country is exposed to these natural hazards, which often cause significant loss of life\nand large-scale destruction of physical infrastructure, and have a long-lasting impact on society.\nOver  the  past  decade,  tens  of  thousands  of  people  have  been  killed  and  millions  affected  by\nsuch disasters.  The worst damage is caused by earthquakes, cyclones, and droughts (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Exposure to Natural Disasters in India (1991-2001)\n\nYear\n\nType\n\nAffected (in \u2018000)\n\nNumber of Persons\n\n2\n\n54\n\n1,175\n166\n400\n\u2014\n1,323\n22\n4,661\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n19,660\n\nKilled\n\n1,500\n\n\u2014\n9,475\n208\n558\n1,386\n43\n3,600\n2,541\n\u2014\n\u2014\n19,200\n\n1991\n1992\n1993 (I)\n         (II)\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998 (I)\n1998 (II)\n1999\n2000\n2001 (as of 15 Mar)\n\nEarthquake\n\nDrought\nEarthquake\nCyclone\nDrought\nCyclone\nEarthquake\nCyclone\nDrought\nDrought\nDrought\nEarthquake\n\n\u2014 = not available.\nSources:  Office  of  United  States  Foreign  Disaster  Assistance;  and  Center  for  Research  on  the  Epidemiology  of\nDisasters. International Disaster Database.\n\nB.\n\nThe Earthquake of 26 January 2001\n\n5.\nThe massive earthquake, with its epicenter about 20 kilometers (kms) northeast of Bhuj,\nin the district of Kachchh of Gujarat, about 1,140 km from New Delhi, was followed by more than\n300 aftershocks ranging between 3 to 6 on the Richter scale during the subsequent two weeks.\nAlthough  the  quake  was  felt  throughout  most  of  western,  northern,  and  southern  India,  the\ndamage  was  most  severe  in  Kachchh  and  the  adjoining  districts  of  Jamnagar,  Patan,  Rajkot,\nand  Surendranagar.  Ahmedabad,  the  commercial  center  of  Gujarat  with  a  population  of  about\n5.4 million was also affected. So far, more than 19,200 people have been confirmed dead, with\nthe  toll  likely  to rise above  20,000.  Almost 200,000 people were injured, and nearly 20 million\npeople  were  affected.  While  roads  and  bridges  sustained  only  relatively  minor  damage,  other\ninfrastructure services like water supply and sanitation, power transmission and distribution, and\ntelecommunications  received  extensive  damage.  Health  and  education  infrastructure  was  also\nseverely  impacted,  with  hundreds  of  hospitals  and  smaller  health  facilities  damaged  and\nthousands  of  classrooms  destroyed.  Moreover,  civil  administration  was  greatly  affected,  with\noffice buildings destroyed and staff either killed, injured, or suffering the loss of family members\nand property. Many houses were either destroyed or damaged, rendering more than 1.7 million\npeople homeless.\n\n6.\nThe calamity hit Gujarat at a time when the state was trying to recuperate from the severe\nflooding  due  to  cyclones  in  1998  and  1999,  and  droughts  in  1999  and  2000.  The  most  recent\ndrought is reported to have affected 84 percent of the state\u2019s population, with 146 of 174 major water\nreservoirs holding less than 25 percent of the designated storage level; the impact on agriculture and\nanimal  husbandry  was  significant.  The  cyclones  and  droughts  alone  required  additional  state\n\n\f3\n\nspending  equivalent  to  0.2  percent  of  gross  state  domestic  product  (GSDP)  in  FY1999,  about  0.3\npercent in FY2000, and 0.5 percent projected for FY2001.\n\n7.\nThe  population  affected  by  the  earthquake  has  little  in  the  way  of  coping  strategies,\nparticularly the many who have lost all their possessions and currently face life without shelter.\nThe evident immediate needs are for food, shelter, clothing, medicine, and sanitation facilities.\nTrauma counseling is also an urgent requirement. Restoration of transport infrastructure, water\nsupply and sanitation, power, and housing will be a priority of the recovery strategy.\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Damage\n\n8.\nThe earthquake had a severe impact on the life and livelihood of people in the Kachchh\nregion  of  Gujarat.  So  far,  about  290,000  houses  and  huts  are  reported  as  destroyed  and\nanother  488,000  damaged  in  the  earthquake-affected  rural  areas,  and  a  further  141,000\nhousing  units  in  affected  urban  areas.  Moreover,  several  of  the  urban  areas,  including  Anjar,\nBhachau, Bhuj, Gandhidham, and Rapar are completely or almost completely destroyed and will\nneed reconstruction.\n\n9.\nDamage  to  infrastructure  and  household  property  was  extensive.  The  agriculture,\nindustry,  and  services  sectors  were  also  significantly  affected,  both  in  terms  of  lost  assets  as\nwell as in loss of production and income. The total economic damage is estimated at about $3.4\nbillion,  or  approximately  13  percent  of  GSDP.  Damage  to  physical  infrastructure  accounts  for\nabout  65  percent  of  total  economic  damage  (comprising  direct  and  indirect,  i.e.,  flow-related\ncosts).2  These  estimates  are  based  on  initial  rapid  assessment  combined  with  more  detailed\nsurveys  undertaken  by  GOG,  as  well  as  field  assessment  by  the  Joint  Mission.  Preliminary\nestimates suggest that the cost of the rehabilitation and reconstruction of physical infrastructure\nincluding housing will be about $2.3 billion over the next 2-3 years.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\n10.\nThe  economic  impact  of  the  earthquake  comprises  (i)  losses  to  immovable  assets,  (ii)\nlosses to movable assets, (iii) economic losses due to business interruption, and (iv) economic\ncosts to the public sector. Losses to immovable and movable assets reflect the direct economic\ncosts  due  to  destroyed  or  damaged  buildings  and  other  physical  infrastructure,  as  well  as  the\neconomic  losses  due  to  destroyed  or  damaged  contents  of  public  and  private  buildings,  and\nequipment.  Public  sector  economic  costs  accrue  due  to  revenue  losses  and  increases  in\nbudgetary expenditures for immediate relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction.\n\n11.\nThe  potential  impact  of  the  earthquake  on  Gujarat\u2019s  GSDP  comes  in  the  wake  of  two\nconsecutive  droughts,  which  had  already  adversely  affected  agricultural  production  and  state\nincome.  The  loss  in  infrastructure  facilities  and  productive  capacity  of  almost  Rs100  billion  is\nlikely  to  reduce  state  income  by  about  Rs20  billion  during  the  first  year.  The  income  loss\n(amounting  to  2-3  percent  of  GSDP)  is  expected  to  be  partly  offset  by  the  investment  for\nreconstruction that will boost income by restoring supply capacity and stimulating demand. As a\nresult,  the  loss  of  GSDP  may  be  less  than  0.5  percent  of  GSDP  in  FY2002.  Given  Gujarat\u2019s\nshare  in  India\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  of  about  6  percent,  the  impact  of  the  earthquake  on\nIndia\u2019s  national  income  will  be  relatively  minor.  The  earthquake  had  no  perceptible  impact  on\n\n                                                \n2 The total damage of about $3.4 billion comprises (i) damage to physical infrastructure: $2.3 billion; (ii) loss/damage\nto  commercial  buildings  (excluding  inventory):  $260  million;  and  (iii)  projected  output  loss  due  to  damaged\ninfrastructure,  and  loss  of  fiscal  revenues:  $830  million.  There  are  some  differences  between  the  assessment  of\ndamages  and  rehabilitation  costs  made  by  the  Joint  World  Bank-ADB  Mission  and  GOG  estimates;  e.g.  GOG\nestimated the value of lost household assets at par with the value of damaged housing; this would raise the figure\non total economic damage by a further $850 million-$900 million.\n\n\f4\n\nthe general price level or balance of payments. The adequate supply of essential commodities,\nincluding food-grain stocks, contributed to the maintenance of inflation stability. Notwithstanding,\nrelative  prices  for  individual  commodities,  such  as  cement  and  steel,  have  risen  sharply  in\nanticipation of the heightened demand associated with reconstruction.\n\nThe  impact  on  GOG\u2019s  public  finances  and  its  program  of  medium-term  fiscal\n12.\nconsolidation is likely to be more severe. The earthquake will have adverse effects on both the\ngovernment\u2019s revenues as well as its expenditures. The loss of income in the affected region,\ndecline in employment opportunities, and lower housing stock may lower revenues from sales\ntax,  profession  tax,  and  stamp  duty  and  registration  fees,  by  an  amount  equivalent  to  0.2\npercent and 0.5 percent of GSDP in FY2001 and FY2002, respectively. Higher outlays for relief\nand  reconstruction  will  add  pressure  on  the  state  budget.  The  cost  for  immediate  financial\nassistance  through  cash  compensation,  food  supplies,  medical  relief,  and  debris  removal,  as\nwell  as  emergency  restoration  of  water,  power,  and  telecommunications  amounted  to  Rs2.1\nbillion ($45 million) in the first three weeks following the earthquake and is projected by GOG to\ntotal Rs6.5 billion ($140 million), equivalent to 0.5 percent of GSDP by the end of March 2001,\nthe  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  Although  still  tentative,  GOG  is  anticipating  expenditure  on\nrehabilitation alone to exceed Rs100 billion ($2.3 billion equivalent).3 Together with the loss in\nrevenue,  these  additional  expenditures  are  likely  to  raise  the  fiscal  deficit  by  about  0.5-1.0\npercent of GSDP in FY2001, and by 1.5-2.5 percent of GSDP in FYs 2002 and 2003 depending\non the phasing of outlays and the inflow of additional receipts.4 The magnitude of the pressure\non  public  finances  will  pose  a  major  challenge  to  GOG  for  its  prudent  fiscal  and  debt\nmanagement.\n\n3. \n\nSocial Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n\n13.\nDespite  a  more  than  50  percent  decline  in  the  incidence  of  poverty  from  47  percent  of\nthe  population  to  24  percent  between  1972/73  to  1993/94,5  mainly  on  account  of  Gujarat\u2019s\nrelatively higher levels of industrialization and higher economic growth, the absolute number of\npoor declined much less, from 13.5 million to 10.4 million, during that period. Of these, about 6.2\nmillion live in rural areas, and 4.2 million in urban centers. Other indicators of poverty (e.g., child\nmalnutrition  levels,  infant  mortality)  show  that  the  poor\u2014especially  women  and  children\u2014may\nbe more disadvantaged than this figure suggests.\n\n14.\nThe  worst  quake-hit  districts  of  Jamnagar,  Kachchh,  Patan,  and  Surendranagar  have\nhigh  levels  of  rural  and  urban  poverty.  Agricultural  productivity  is  low,  reflecting  the  arid  and\nsemiarid agroclimatic conditions, and capital intensity of industry and industrial value added is\nonly a fraction of the state-wide average, given the preponderance of small-scale industry and\ninformal  sector  activities.  This  is  also  reflected  in  the  proportionately  higher  percentage  of\nhouseholds occupying kachha and semipucca houses (Appendix 1, para. 2)(cid:190) a type of house\ngenerally  associated  with  the  poorer  sections  of  the  population(cid:190) particularly  in  Patan  and\nSurendranagar.  Nonetheless,  basic  amenities  such  as  electricity  and  safe  drinking  water  are\nmore  generally  available  in  all  the  districts  (except  Surendranagar),  although  health  and\neducation  facilities  are  distributed  unevenly  across  the  districts.  The  rural  areas  of  Kachchh,\n\n                                                \n3 The figures for rehabilitation cost do not include damage to commercial buildings nor the cost of loss to inventory.\nGOG\u2019s  financial  burden  for  reconstruction  and  repair  of  private  houses  will  depend  on  the  extent  of  financial\nsupport it provides to the affected homeowners. In view of the relatively high incidence of poverty in the affected\nareas prior to the disaster, public funds will need to be provided to affected persons for private housing.\n\n4 Under normal arrangements for transfer of external assistance as additional central plan assistance, 30 percent of\n\nthe amount is provided as grant and 70 percent as loan.\n\n5 The  latest  available  official  data  are  from  the  1993/94  (quienquennial)  national  sample  survey.  A  new  census  is\n\ncurrently being undertaken in all states.\n\n\f5\n\nPatan,  and  Surendranagar  have  lower  male  and  female  literacy  rates,  higher  infant  mortality\nrate, and lower life expectancy than the state-wide average.\n\n15.\nThe socioeconomic impact of the earthquake on the comparatively less-developed areas\nof Gujarat is severe. The social fabric of the quake-hit areas has been seriously affected by the\nlarge  number  of  human  deaths  and  injuries.  In  addition  to  the  immediate  suffering  caused,  a\nlarge number of families have been torn by the death or serious disability of a member. This will\nhave  long-term  consequences  on  the  well-being  of  other  members,  particularly  widows\n(especially young women), single-parent children, orphans, and the elderly. More adult women\ndied than men, and a large number of children were killed. Similar differences are likely among\nthe injured.\n\n16.\nOther  social  impacts  of  the  quake  include  deep  insecurity  among  those  who  have  lost\nassets, including movable and immovable property, and increased vulnerability to poverty. The\nlivelihoods  of  many  families  have  been  disrupted,  particularly  among  residents  in  the  worst\naffected  towns  and  villages.  The  loss  of  lives,  the  loss  of  or  damage  to  home/workplace,\nproductive  assets  and/or  industrial  units  has  caused  more  severe  disruption,  while  temporary\ndisruption  has  occurred  in  the  wake  of  the  shock  and  fear  caused  by  the  earthquake,  and  of\ndisruptions in financial services, markets, and distribution channels. Handicraft artisans and salt\nfarmers  are  the  most  severely  affected  groups.6  Another  important  source  of  livelihood  in  the\nregion is animal husbandry, about 18,000 cattle deaths have been reported. Economic recovery\nhas  been  hampered  by  the  outflow  of  people,  including  normally  migrant  workers,  such  as\nlaborers on the salt farms in the affected areas.\n\nC.\n\nNatural Disaster Response7\n\n17.\nAlthough systems were in place to manage cyclones, drought, and floods, Gujarat was\nill-prepared for  earthquakes.  No authority had responsibility for earthquake preparedness, and\nno  contingency  plans  or  policies  had  been  adopted  for  dealing  with  such  a  catastrophe.\nNonetheless,  GOG  responded  quickly.  At  the  district  level,  the  damage  suffered  impaired  the\nresponse,  but  arrangements  were  rapidly  improvised.  GOG  immediately  began  emergency\nrescue  operations,  and  initiated  efforts  to  restore  lost  communication  links,  electricity,  water\nsupply,  and  civil  supplies.  The  Government  also  launched  a  large-scale  relief  and  rescue\noperation, mobilizing available resources and personnel to assist the victims.8 The relief efforts\nat the central level were coordinated by the Natural Disaster Management Control Room, which\nhas worked closely with GOG\u2019s Control Room and the state relief commissioner. To coordinate\nthe longer-term reconstruction, on 6 February 2001 GOG established the Gujarat State Disaster\nManagement Authority (GSDMA) chaired by the chief minister, with nine members and its chief\nexecutive  officer  as  member  secretary.  GSDMA  has  been  registered  as  a  society  under  the\nSocieties  Act.  GOG  has  also  established  the  high-level  Disaster  Management  Task  Force  to\nadvise on relief and reconstruction policies.\n\n18.\nLocal  government  response  was  impaired  due  to  the  severity  of  the  damage  and  the\nnear total loss of office infrastructure and communication, besides injuries to personnel and their\nfamily  members  as  also  the  disruption  to  their  normal  life.  Though  constrained  by  the\nearthquake-related  destruction,  the  district  administration  used  its  available  resources  and\n\n                                                \n6 Kachchh  district  alone  accounts  for  80  percent  of  India\u2019s  salt  production,  and  80  percent  of  the  facilities  are\n\nreportedly dysfunctional.\n\n7  This section captures only the main emergency response measures taken after the disaster.\n8 The Government also provided Rs6.1 billion ($130 million equivalent) from the National Calamity Relief Fund and\nthe Prime Minister\u2019s Relief Fund as emergency cash assistance. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India permitted\nGOG  to  access  ways  and  means  advances  beyond  normal  limits  for  emergency  relief  and  rehabilitation  until\n31 March 2001\n\n\f6\n\nrapidly  launched  the  rescue  and  relief  measures  together  with  local  military  units.    Many  local\nofficials  lost  family  members  and  their  homes,  yet  returned  to  work  quickly  to  salvage  what\noffice facilities could be recovered and coordinate relief activities.\n\n19.\nAs is typical in disasters, community members immediately mobilized resources, helped\neach other, and provided whatever assistance they could. The strong NGO network in Gujarat\nsupported  community  efforts.  Several  well-known  local  and  national  NGOs  such  as  the  Self-\nEmployed  Women\u2019s  Association  are  active  in  the  area  and  are  helping  people  restore\nlivelihoods  and  meet  other  needs.    A  local  NGO,  the  Kachchh  Navnirman  Abhiyan,  was\nnominated as the coordinator of NGO activities, and has set up 22 local subcenters in the area\nto  coordinate  information  and  assistance,  with  encouragement  and  formal  endorsement  from\nGOG. Cooperation between international and national NGOs has also been extensive.\n\nD. \n\nAid Coordination and External Assistance\n\n20.\nIn  the  wake  of  the  disaster,  the  international  community  responded  with  immediate\nsupport. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs sent a five-member UN Disaster\nAssessment  and  Coordination  team  on  27  January,  the  day  following  the  disaster.  The  UN\nDisaster  Management  Team,  assisted  by  staff  from  the  United  Nations  Development\nProgramme Emergency Response Division, were also deployed immediately to coordinate the\nUN response. The team established an on-site operation coordination center within the district\ncollector\u2019s compound in Bhuj. This has enabled the development of a close working relationship\nand a continuous exchange of information between the chief relief coordinator, the collector and\nthe  UN  system.  The  coordination  center  included  a  World  Health  Organization  disease\nsurveillance  desk  to  monitor  outbreaks  of  illness.  The  World  Food  Program  initiated  an\nemergency operation of more than $4 million to provide relief food rations to 300,000 people. All\nother UN organizations have sent assessment teams to the affected area. For the rehabilitation\nand recovery phase, the United Nations Development Programme will be the focal agency for\nthe UN system.\n\n21.\nSeveral countries sent search and rescue teams and equipment. In addition, numerous\ncountries  have  either  pledged  or  provided  cash  and  in-kind  contributions  on  a  bilateral  basis,\nthrough NGOs or the UN system. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\nSocieties established a team in the town of Anjar and an emergency response unit hospital in\nBhuj.  They  also  issued  an  appeal  that  resulted  in  more  than  $15  million  being  donated  to\naddress the immediate needs of affected communities, including shelter, medical services and\nsupplies, and water and sanitation equipment.\n\n22.\nSeveral  donors  and  multilateral  institutions  have  pledged  support  to  the  longer-term\nrecovery efforts. In response to the request from the Government, ADB sent a team of experts\non disaster management and earthquake engineering to Gujarat on 2 February 2001 to assist\nfor  disaster\nGOG  with  preliminary  damage  assessment  and \nmanagement.9  This  was  followed  on  12  February  by  the  fielding  of  the  Joint  Mission,  to\nundertake a damage assessment, by ADB and the World Bank in partnership with GOG and the\nGovernment,  and  to  assist  in  developing  a  comprehensive  recovery  strategy.  After  the  Joint\nMission,  on  27  February  an  aid  meeting  was  held  in  New  Delhi  to  brief  other  multilateral  and\nbilateral agencies on the assessment of damages and economic impacts of the earthquake, and\non the rehabilitation and reconstruction program.10\n\ninstitutional  setup \n\nthe \n\n                                                \n9 These experts were part of the consulting team contracted under TA 3379-IND: Strengthening Disaster Mitigation\n\nand Management at the State Level, for $1.0 million, approved on 28 December 1999.\n\n10 Participants included representatives from the Department for International Development, European Commission,\nInternational  Labor  Organization,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  Japan  International  Cooperation\nAgency, Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau, GTZ (German Development Cooperation), as well as the embassies of\n\n\fE. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n7\n\nA review of ADB-wide experience with rehabilitation assistance11 indicates the following\n23.\nessential factors: (i) projects must be prepared as quickly as possible; (ii) projects should focus\non restoring facilities; (iii) rehabilitation works, to the extent possible, should be completed within\ntwo  years;  (iv)  implementation  will  place  a  heavy  burden  on  executing  agency  (EA)  staff  and\ntherefore strong consulting support and ADB supervision is needed during implementation; and\n(v)  efforts  should  be  made  to  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  rapid  response  to  disasters  is  matched  by\nequally  quick  action  by  the  government.  Other  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  earlier  emergency\nprojects  include  (vi)  beneficiary  participation  must  be  ensured  and  increased  in  project\npreparation  and  implementation,  especially  in  the  maintenance  of  facilities;  (vii)  environment\nand social aspects should be considered during project implementation, even though the need\nfor a rapid response may not permit a detailed treatment of these issues prior to the approval of\nthe  assistance;  (viii)  arrangements  for  disbursements(cid:190)\nincluding  retroactive  financing  and  the\nuse  of  imprest  accounts(cid:190)\nshould  give  the  EAs  quick  and  simple  access  to  funds;  (ix)  project\nobjectives  and  scope  need  to  be  carefully  defined;  and  (x)  criteria  for  subproject  selection\nshould permit simple prioritization of subprojects and short implementation periods.\n\n24.\nThese  lessons  have  been  considered  and  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  proposed\nProject. Indeed, ADB response has been very rapid: within a few days, a team of ADB-funded\ndisaster  management  experts  started  to  provide  assistance  to  GOG;  within  two  weeks  of  the\ncalamity,  a  senior  delegation  from  ADB  visited  Gujarat,  and  the  Joint  World  Bank-ADB\nAssessment  Mission  was  fielded  to  assist  GOG  in  assessing  the  damage  and  in  evolving  a\nshort-  and  medium-term  recovery  and  rehabilitation  strategy;  and  Board  approval  for  the\nproposed  assistance  is  being  sought  within  less  than  two  months  from  receipt  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s request for assistance. The implementation period for the rehabilitation Project is\n33  months,  with  a  shorter  implementation  period  for  urgent  housing,  and  focuses  on  the\nimmediate  rehabilitation  of  the  physical  and  social  infrastructure  in  the  affected  areas  and  the\nrestoration of livelihood for those affected. Simplified approval and implementation procedures\nhave  been  agreed  upon  with  GOG.  Strong  consulting  inputs,  for  project  management,  design\nand  construction  supervision,  procurement,  and  financial  management  and  audit  are  included.\nCriteria  for  subproject  selection  have  been  developed,  and  environmental  safeguards  built  in.\nAdvance  procurement  action  has  been  permitted  and  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  to\nfacilitate  project  implementation.  Moreover,  the  proposed  Project  has  been  prepared  with\ncomplementarity of assistance from other multilateral and bilateral agencies and donors in mind.\n\nF. \n\nADB\u2019s Country Operational Strategy\n\n25.\nADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for  India,  prepared  in  1996,  is  designed  to\nsupport Government efforts in strengthening the economic and social development of the country.\nThe  overall  strategic  objective  of  the  COS  is  to  promote  economic  efficiency  and  higher\nsustainable growth to improve employment and reduce poverty. It has been operationalized with\nsupport  for  macroeconomic  and  structural  reforms  at  the  national  and  state  levels;  enhanced\nprivate sector participation; development of regulatory and institutional capacities; and enhanced\nresource mobilization through financial sector and capital market reforms. Consistent with India\u2019s\ndevelopment needs and ADB\u2019s strategic emphasis, increased focus is on poverty reduction. In the\ncontext  of  India\u2019s  current  inaccessibility  to  Asian  Development  Fund  resources,  the  strategic\npriorities for ADB\u2019s contribution to reduce poverty include creating conditions for accelerated and\n\n                                                                                                                                                         \nBelgium,  Canada,  Denmark,  France,  Norway,  Portugal,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United\nStates of America, in addition to representatives from ADB and the World Bank.\n\n11 Benson,  C.  and  W.T.

Rehabilitation Assistance after Disasters: A Review of Lessons\n\nLearned and Emerging Issues, 3rd draft, ADB, Manila.\n\n\f8\n\nsustainable  growth,  expanding  social  opportunities  for  the  poor,  and  developing  comprehensive\npartnerships for state-level operations. A new country strategy is currently being prepared.\n\n26.\nA  key  feature  of  the  COS  is  a  shift  in  ADB  activities  to  support  for  comprehensive\neconomic  and  structural  reforms  in  selected  states.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  focuses  on  supporting\nmacroeconomic reform and fiscal consolidation to improve public saving and enhance resource\nmobilization;  increasing  efficiency  in  resource  use  by  rationalizing  unproductive  expenditure,\nand  restructuring  and  divesting  state-owned  enterprises;  strengthening  local  government  and\nimproving  good  governance;  and  reforming  policies  in  key  physical  infrastructure  sectors,\nespecially  power,  the  major  cause  of  fiscal  hemorrhage  in  most  states.  The  state-level\noperations  also  focus  on  fostering  human  development  by  supporting  the  reallocation  of\nbudgetary resources to social sectors to thereby enable addressing vital cross-cutting concerns\non a sustainable basis. Gujarat was the first state chosen for ADB\u2019s state-level operations and a\nloan and TA program was approved in 1996.12 ADB assistance so far has focused on improving\npublic  resource  management,  reforming  the  power  sector,13  and  establishing  of  Gujarat\nInfrastructure  Development  Board  as  the  first  infrastructure  project  development  facility  of  its\nkind in India.\n\n27.\nThe  proposed  Project  will  rehabilitate  damaged  infrastructure  and  housing,  and  will\nprovide support for livelihood rehabilitation. It will enable people to rebuild to resume normal life\nby restoring availability of basic services such as drinking water and electricity, provide housing\nto mitigate homelessness, and foster economic opportunities. This is fundamental for resuming\nthe socioeconomic development process in Gujarat, one of ADB\u2019s focal states. The Project is,\ntherefore, in line with ADB\u2019s COS for India and in accordance with ADB\u2019s overarching objective\nof poverty reduction.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n28.\nThe intensity of the earthquake resulted in a major catastrophy, severely impacting the\nlocal  population.  The  quake,  the  worst  on  record  for  the  past  half  century,  caused  more  than\n19,000 confirmed deaths, and left 200,000 injured and up to 1.7 million homeless. In addition,\nthe  quake  completely  destroyed  300,000  and  damaged  more  than  600,000  dwelling  units  and\nmuch of the power, water supply, and sanitation systems.\n\nBecause  the  quake\u2019s  epicenter  was  in  the  Kachchh  district  of  Gujarat,  the  impact  on\n29.\npeople\u2019s  lives  and  economic  activity  was  even  greater,  as  this  was  the  fifth  major  disaster  to\nstrike the northeastern part of Gujarat in the past four years. The four preceding events include\ntwo cyclones and two severe droughts, the second of which is still causing major distress to the\npoorest  regions  in  the  state.  Therefore,  GOG\u2019s  and  civil  society\u2019s  economic  resilience  were\nalready depleted and the estimated $2.3 billion cost of rehabilitation and reconstruction of basic\nservices,  together  with  the  further  $1  billion-$1.5  billion  of  economic  damage  due  to  loss  of\nproduction  and  lower  fiscal  revenues,  would  be  impossible  for  the  state  to  bear  without\nassistance.  By  providing  financing  for  the  most  urgently  needed  components  and  works,  the\nloan  will  enable  GOG  to  finance  a  portion  of  the  overall  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction\nprogram, as well as help restore the economic activity essential for survival of residents in the\nheavily affected areas.\n                                                \n12 Since  then,  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Kerala  have  been  selected  as  additional  focal  states  for  ADB\u2019s  state-level\n\nassistance.\n\n13 Loan  1803  and  1804-IND:  Gujarat  Power  Sector  Development  Program,  for  $350  million,  approved  on\n\n13 December 2000 was the first sector development program loan to India.\n\n\fB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n9\n\n30.\nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  support  GOG\u2019s  efforts  to  rehabilitate  and\nreconstruct  essential  infrastructure  damaged  in  the  affected  areas  of  the  state,  especially  the\nJamnagar,  Kachchh,  Patan,  Rajkot,  and  Surendranagar  districts.  This  is  essential  to  enable\nearly  restoration  of  economic  and  social  activity  in  the  affected  areas,  especially  for  the  poor.\nThe Project will focus on the highest priority areas, identified through consultations with GOG,\npublic and private sector, NGOs, and other civil society. Based on the Joint Mission assessment\n(para.  2),  incorporating  complementarity  with  assistance  from  other  agencies  and  donors,  the\nsectors  identified  for  the  Project  include  housing,  urban  and  rural  infrastructure,  power,  and\nlivelihood rehabilitation. In addition, the Project will provide assistance for institutional support,\nas well as multihazard disaster preparedness and mitigation.\n\n31.\n\nThe Project will have the following parts.\n\n32.\nPart A: Housing. Houses with structural damage will be rehabilitated and strengthened,\nand new houses constructed  if the houses were completely destroyed. Work will focus on the\npoorer  sections  of  the  population,  particularly  those  living  below  poverty  line  and  the\neconomically weaker sections of the population in the affected rural areas (Appendix 1).14\n\n33.\nPart  B:  Urban  and  Rural  Infrastructure.  Work  will  focus  on  urban  and  rural  water\nsupply, sewerage, sanitation, drainage, roads, streets and related structures, markets, bus and\ntruck  stations,  civic  buildings  and  staff  quarters,  electrification  and  lighting,  administrative\nhardware, utility vehicles including water tankers, fire trucks, garbage collection and compactor\nequipment,  development  of  sites  and  services,  and  commercial  and  industrial  use  and  related\ndebris removal and appurtenances (Appendixes 2 and 3).\n\n34.\nPart  C:  Power.  This  part  will  focus  on  refurbishing  and  rehabilitating  substations,\ntransmission  lines,  distribution  systems,  staff  quarters,  administrative  and  related  buildings,\nswitch gear and transformers, control systems and related equipment and works (Appendix 4).\n\n35.\nPart D: Livelihood Rehabilitation. Support will be provided for livelihood projects given\nthe strong interlinkages between economic rehabilitation of the society, housing reconstruction,\nand access to basic needs. The specific projects will include financial and infrastructure support\nfor skill-based affected persons, including retraining of affected persons needing alternative line\nof work and livelihood (Appendix 5).\n\nPart  E:  Consulting  Services  and  Incremental  Administrative  Support.  Support  will\n36.\nbe provided for concerned state agencies and municipal bodies to implement the rehabilitation\nand  reconstruction,  capacity  building,  benefit  monitoring,  as  well  as  incremental  equipment,\nservices,  supplies,  and  incremental  personnel  costs  incurred  by  the  agencies  responsible  for\nproject implementation.\n\n37.\nPart F: Multihazard Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation. Support will be provided\nfor  GOG,  to  include  preparation  of  disaster  management  plans,  disaster  management\ninformation systems, and disaster management training (Appendix 6). \n\n                                                \n14 The poorer section would include housing units proposed to be rehabilitated up to a unit size of 50 square meters,\nas  defined  only  in  each  of  the,  rehabilitation  packages  No.  1,  No.  2,  and  No.  3  of  GOG\u2019s  Resolution  No.  PNV-\n162001-1502 (1)-S.3, dated 23 February 2001.\n\n\f10\n\n38.\nThe  Project  was  developed  in  close  cooperation  with  the  World  Bank  and  bilateral\nassistance agencies, who will also finance part of the reconstruction program.15 The Project will\nfollow  a  sector  approach  to  facilitate  selection  of  the  highest  priority  subprojects  during\nimplementation. The sector approach is a suitable modality for emergencies, as it allows quick\nresponse  and  maximum  flexibility  of  both  geographic  coverage  and  components,  within  the\nagreed framework and selection criteria. It will also enable GOG to utilize the Project based on\nfinancial  considerations  related  to  access  to  alternate  funding.  The  eligible  urban  centers\ncomprise  all  cities  and  towns  in  the  earthquake-affected  areas,  while  in  the  rural  areas  all\nearthquake-affected districts and villages are covered.\n\n39.\nThe  Project  is  an  essential  component  of  GOG\u2019s  overall  plans  for  recovery  from  the\ndisaster and will focus on rehabilitating and reconstructing or replacing facilities, with due regard\nto technological improvement, changed circumstances, and disaster prevention by incorporating\nstructural  strengthening  and  improvements  against  future  earthquake  and  other  natural\ndisasters. Special focus will be placed on the needs of the poorer sections of the population in\nterms of housing and access to basic services.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n40.\nCost estimates for the Project are based on the damage assessment of the Joint World\nBank-ADB Mission and interactions with Government, GOG, and local authorities. GOG\u2019s initial\nestimates  were  reviewed  and  updated  based  on  detailed  assessments  carried  out  by  a  joint\nteam  of  about  35  persons  from  the  two  banks,  supported  by  ADB  TA  consultants  for  disaster\nmanagement  and  earthquake  engineering  (footnote  9),  and  various  GOG  and  local  officials.\nThrough  the  one-week  field  mission  to  the  damaged  areas,  the  joint  World  Bank/ADB  team\ntrained GOG assessors through hands-on detailed inspection and analysis of on-site damage in\nthree of the most severely damaged towns. Based on this training, GOG was able to update the\ndamage assessments throughout the affected areas of Gujarat. The end result was coalesced\ninto  a  joint  assessment  report.  The  damage  estimates  are  based  on  rehabilitating  and\nreconstructing  the  housing  stock  and  various  public  infrastructure.  These  estimates  were  then\nrefined  to  incorporate  earthquake-resistant  designs,  materials,  and  improved  technology.  The\ndamage  assessments  will  continue  to  be  updated  as  more  detailed  information  becomes\navailable as clean up continues. These will be updated during the detailed design phase of the\nvarious project components.16\n\n41.\nThe cost of the Project is estimated at $625 million equivalent (Table 2). Since a sector\napproach is being followed, the cost estimates are on a sectoral basis. A summary of the cost\nestimates is available in Appendix 7.\n\n                                                \n15 In  particular,  the  World  Bank  will  provide  assistance  for  the  health,  education,  irrigation,  and  roads  sectors  in\naddition  to  public  buildings  and  housing,  and  will  finance  the  provision  of  temporary  shelters  and  ongoing  debris\nremoval. Total World Bank lending from both nonconcessional and concessional sources will be $1.0 billion. TA as\nwell  as  support  for  the  education  sector  is  being  considered  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment and the Netherlands.\n\n16 ADB and the World Bank jointly conducted detailed assessments for several of the most damaged towns. For the\nurban infrastructure component under part B, the town of Anjar was used as the basis for assessing damage and\nthe  required  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  for  urban  infrastructure.  The  basis  for  the  rural  infrastructure\ncomponent was the damage assessment and reconstruction requirements developed in close conjunction with the\nGujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board. The estimates for power systems damage were based on the detailed\nassessment by Gujarat Electricity Board. These benchmarks were used to develop the eligibility criteria, the related\nscope and cost of the Project, and the implementation arrangements that are described in Chapter IV.F.\n\n\f11\n\nTable 2: Cost Estimate\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nPart A: Housing\nPart B: Urban and Rural Infrastructure\nPart C: Power\nPart D: Livelihood Rehabilitation\nPart E: Consulting  Services \nAdministrative Support\n\nand \n\nMitigation\nFront-End Fee\n\nTotal\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nPart F: Multihazard  Disaster  Preparedness  and\n\n20\n\nIncremental\n\nForeign\nCurrency\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nCost\n\n250\n217\n98\n20\n15\n\n5\n625\n\n30\n45\n24\n2\n1\n\n5\n\n5\n112\n\n220\n173\n74\n18\n14\n\n15\n\n0\n513\n\n42.\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  $500  million  equivalent,  representing  80  percent  of  the\ntotal cost of the Project (Table 3).17 The loan will finance 80 percent of housing, and urban and\nrural  infrastructure,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies;  the  full  cost  of  livelihood\nrehabilitation, consulting services and incremental administrative support; and about 68 percent\nof the power component. The Borrower will pay to ADB a front-end fee in an amount equal to\none percent of the loan amount. The fee will be capitalized in the loan. GOG will meet the $125\nmillion  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  components  of  the  Project.  Although  ADB\u2019s\nproposed share of financing is relatively high, it is justified in view of the special circumstances\nof this Project, and is in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Rehabilitation Assistance after\nDisasters18 and ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy for developing member countries. 19\n\n43.\nThe Borrower will be India. The loan will be in accordance with the prevailing ADB policy\non Rehabilitation Assistance after Disasters (footnote 18). The loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary\ncapital resources with a term of 30 years including a 7-year grace period. It will carry an interest\nrate determined in accordance with the ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US\ndollar  loans.  The  Borrower  will  treat  the  loan  proceeds  as  an  addition  to  the  normal  transfers\nallocated annually from the Government to GOG, i.e., as additional central plan assistance, and\ntransfer  such  proceeds  to  GOG  at  the  prevailing  loan-to-grant  ratio.  The  local  currency  cost\nfinancing of the housing, urban and rural infrastructure, and power components is justified given\nthe tight fiscal situation in Gujarat already in place because of the successive years of cyclone\nand drought disasters and the extraordinary damage caused by the severe earthquake.\n\n                                                \n17 As noted in para. 2, as well as in the information paper to the Board (IN. 41-01: India: Impact of the Earthquake in\nGujarat and ADB\u2019s Proposed Assistance,  19  February  2001),  consideration  was  initially  given  to  reallocating\nproceeds  from  three  approved  loans.  A  more  detailed  assessment  by  the  Mission  indicated  that  reallocation  of\nexisting loan proceeds may not be the most effective approach. The financing requirements of the different sectors\nrequired processing of a new sector-based loan for $500 million, in accordance with the Government\u2019s request.\n\n18 R191-88: Rehabilitation Assistance after Disasters, 2 February 1989, para. 47.\n19 R204-98: A Graduation Policy for the Bank\u2019s DMCs, 23 November 1998, para. 87.\n\n\f12\n\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nPart A: Housing\nPart B: Urban and Rural Infrastructure\nPart C: Power\nPart D: Livelihood Rehabilitation\nPart E: Consulting Services and Incremental Administrative Support\nPart F: Multihazard Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation\n\nFront-End Fee\n\nTotal\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, GOG = Government of Gujarat.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nE. \n\nExecuting Agency\n\nADB\n\nGOG Total\n\n200\n173\n67\n20\n15\n20\n5\n500\n\n50\n44\n31\n0\n0\n0\n0\n125\n\n250\n217\n98\n20\n15\n20\n5\n625\n\n44.\nGOG  established  GSDMA,  with  a  mandate  to  manage  and  execute  the  entire\nrehabilitation and reconstruction works. GSDMA and GOG jointly will function as the EA for the\nProject.  GSDMA  will  also  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  assistance  provided  by  the\nmultilateral  and  bilateral  development  institutions,  other  aid  and  donor  agencies,  the  private\nsector, and NGOs.20 The GSDMA is chaired by the chief minister, with nine members including\nthe  Minister  of  Finance, \nthe  additional  chief  secretary  (general\nadministration),  the  principal  secretaries  of  finance,  urban  development,  and  roads  and\nbuildings  departments,  the  relief  commissioner,  and  its  chief  executive  officer  as  member\nsecretary.\n\nthe  chief  secretary, \n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n45.\nThe  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project  have  been  designed  to  follow  the\nestablished  procedures  and  practices  under  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  as  much  as\npossible  to  enable  speedy  and  efficient  implementation.  ADB  already  has  several  ongoing\nprojects in each of the main sectors where financing will be provided: housing, urban and rural\ninfrastructure, and power, as well as disaster preparedness and mitigation (footnote 9). As such,\nthe  experience  gained  and  lessons  learned  from  these  have  been  incorporated  into  the\nformulation of the works and design implementation.\n\nfor \n\nINRM\u2019s  management \n\nin  Gandhinagar,21  under \n\n46.\nTo ensure timely Project implementation, the responsibility for project administration will\nbe delegated to ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission (INRM) in Delhi. ADB will establish an extended\nthe  duration  of  project\nmission \nimplementation.  The  extended  mission  will  be  headed  by  an  INRM  staff  member.  Moreover,\nconsultants,  who  are  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  and  policies,  particularly  for  procurement,\naccounts  and  audit,  and  benefit  monitoring,  will  be  recruited.  The  extended  mission  will  assist\nINRM  in  administering  the  Project  by  closely  monitoring  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements\nunder the Project to ensure quality control, speedy implementation of subproject approvals and\nrehabilitation and reconstruction activities, and rapid assistance to implementing agencies (IAs)\non  any  procurement  problems  or  other  project  implementation  matters.  The  extended  mission\nwill also support INRM in carrying out random and spot checks on procurement and accounts of\nthe Project or the subprojects, and inspect project facilities reconstructed or rehabilitated under\n                                                \n20 To this effect, the Gujarat Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Fund was established in mid-February 2001 and will\n\nbe managed by GSDMA.\n\n21 Gandhinagar is the administrative capital of Gujarat, and is located about 20 km from Ahmedabad.\n\n\f13\n\nthe  Project  for  quality  control.  The  provisions  of  the  \u201cAgreement  between  the  Government  of\nIndia and the Asian Development Bank regarding the Resident Office of the Asian Development\nBank\u201d  dated  18  November  1992  will  apply  to  the  extended  mission,  its  premises,  ADB  staff\nmembers and consultants assigned to or associated with the extended mission.\n\n1.\n\nOverall Coordination and Guidance\n\n47.\nGSDMA  will  (i)  guide  and  monitor  overall  project  implementation  to  ensure  that  the\npolicies,  guidelines,  and  requirements  of  GOG  and  ADB  are  met;  (ii)  oversee  preparation  of\ndetailed  damage  assessments,  surveys,  plans,  designs,  and  monitoring  of  the  various\ncomponents,  procurement,  and  works  under  the  Project;  (iii)  provide  executive  decisions  to\nensure that rapid and efficient delivery of the reconstruction works is achieved; (iv) ensure close\ncoordination  between  the  activities  financed  by  the  Project  and  those  sponsored  by  other\nagencies to prevent overlap and duplication; (v) ensure that counterpart funds are provided in\nthe full amount in a timely manner; (vi) ensure that the specifications, plans, and quality control\nof  the  works  are  met;  (vii)  control  and  monitor  the  flow  of  funds  to  the  IAs;  (viii)  ensure  that\nproper  accounts  are  maintained  for  the  Project  and  the  subprojects;  (ix)  ensure  that  each\nrelevant  IAs  recruits  enough  staff  and  consultants  to  properly  implement  the  Project  and  that\nsufficient related funds are allocated; and (x) ensure that ADB is informed in a timely manner of\nthe progress and any issues arising during implementation. GOG has assured ADB that it will\nrecruit and staff GSDMA with suitably qualified and experienced personnel.\n\n48.\nGOG and GSDMA will also ensure that the various IAs including GOG\u2019s line ministries\nand  agencies,  and  city,  town,  and  district  authorities  consult  with  local  elected  bodies,  civic\nsociety,  and  the  general  public  about  issues  related  to  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of\nhousing  and  urban/rural  infrastructure.  GSDMA  will  facilitate  and  empower  NGOs  and\ncommunity organizations to help the beneficiaries access information about the various project\ncomponents,  have  input  in  the  decision-making  process,  participate  in  construction  where\ncapability  exists,  and  enable  participatory  monitoring.  As  a  high-level  agency,  GSDMA  will\nresolve  any  problems  that  may  arise,  including  land  acquisition,  cooperation  from  other  line\nministries  and  agencies,  and  local  elected  bodies.  GSDMA  is  establishing  a  project\nmanagement  and  coordination  unit  (PMCU)  to  provide  day-to-day  assistance  and  guidance  to\nthe project IAs. GSDMA is also establishing a disaster management division to be responsible\nfor disaster mitigation and management on a state-wide basis and development of the required\nadministrative and institutional arrangements. Appendix 8 provides the organization chart.\n\n2.\n\nProject Management and Coordination Unit\n\n49.\nGSDMA will set up the PMCU to act on its behalf as the EA on routine matters and will\nhave  decision-making  authority  to  facilitate  project  implementation.  The  PMCU  in  conjunction\nwith the IAs and the participating districts, cities, and towns will prioritize and select subprojects\nunder  the  Project.  The  PMCU  will  be  supported  by  project  management  consultants  who  will\nprovide  specialized  technical  support  and  advice  on  earthquake  and  other  natural  calamities\u2019\nengineering, financial management and accounting, beneficiary participation, benefit monitoring\nand  evaluation,  and  capacity  building.  The  PMCU  will  conduct  regular  project  implementation\nmeetings with each IA. The ADB extended mission will provide advice and guidance related to\nADB\u2019s procedures and requirements.\n\n3.\n\nImplementing Agencies\n\n50.\nAn IA will be responsible for each of the key sectors included under the Project reporting\nto  the  PMCU.  The  prioritization,  technical  preparation,  and  implementation  of  the  eligible\nsubprojects under parts A through D will be carried out by the respective IAs described in paras.\n\n\f14\n\n52-57.  The  IAs  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  reconstruction  works.\nThey  will  conduct  the  detailed  assessments,  surveys,  and  planning  of  the  reconstruction,\nincluding public consultations and input from the recipient local entities. They will then prioritize\nthe  works,  prepare  the  detailed  designs  and  specifications,  schedules  of  quantities,  cost\nestimates,  bidding  documents,  contracts,  and  related  documentation.  They  will  also  recruit\ndesign and supervision consultants, conduct procurement, support local entities that wish to do\ntheir own reconstruction work, supervise construction, conduct quality control, approve progress\npayments  to  contractors,  maintain  records  and  accounts,  prepare  regular  reports  for  GSDMA\nand ADB, and ensure that benefit monitoring and auditing is carried out. The IAs will also keep\nseparate up-to-date accounts for the Project and make these available to ADB, its missions, or\nits  auditors  for  inspection.  The  IAs  will  be  supported  by  design  and  construction  supervision\nconsultants under the Project.\n\nTo  ensure  timely  project  implementation,  GOG  has  agreed  to  specific  measures  to\n51.\nensure  that  the  internal  approval  process  for  subproject  selection  and  approval,  contract\ntendering  and  signing,  approval  of  progress  claims,  and  provision  of  counterpart  funds  do  not\nunduly  slow  reconstruction  implementation.  In  this  context,  GOG  has  agreed  that  for  each  IA,\napplicable  approval  whether  by  GSDMA  or  within  the  concerned  line  ministry,  will  be  given\npreferably  within  five  working  days,  including  request  for  additional  clarification  of  additional\ninformation.  The  PMCU  will  be  responsible  for  supporting  GSDMA  and  line  ministries  with\nfacilitation of and adherence to this arrangement.\n\nThe IA responsible for part A, housing, will be the Panchayats, Rural Housing, and Rural\n\n52.\nDevelopment Department.\n\nThe IA responsible for the urban infrastructure component of part B will be the Gujarat\n53.\nUrban Development Company. The company will work closely with the recipient urban entities\nto  complete  the  detailed  damage  assessments,  prioritize  works,  planning,  and  beneficiary\nparticipation.  The  works  eligible  under  this  component  include  all  urban  infrastructure:  water\nsupply,  sewerage  and  drainage,  sanitation,  roads,  civic  buildings,  electrification,  and  related\nfacilities.\n\n54.\nThe  Gujarat  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Board  (GWSSB)  will  be  the  IA  for  the  rural\ninfrastructure  component  of  part  B,  including  the  reconstruction  of  all  water  supply  and\nsanitation  works  in  the  rural  areas  and  villages,  as  well  as  for  the  bulk  water  supply  to  the\nparticipating urban bodies. GWSSB is the agency responsible for bringing bulk water supply to\nall  villages  and  district  cities  and  towns,  and  is  currently  operating  and  maintaining  these\nsystems.  The  villages  and  towns  are  responsible  for  distribution  inside  village  and  urban\nboundaries.  On  a  case  by  case  basis,  these  entities  may  opt  to  have  GWSSB  operate  these\nfacilities  on  their  behalf.  Other  villages  and  towns  have  privatized  the  operation  and\nmaintenance, and GSWWB will coordinate closely with these operators. GWSSB is experienced\nwith  planning,  design,  and  construction  management,  and  will  interact  with  and  support  the\nGujarat Urban Development Company in the urban reconstruction.\n\n55.\nFor  part  C,  power  systems  reconstruction,  the  IA  will  be  the  Gujarat  Electricity  Board\n(GEB).  GEB  has  extensive  experience  with  planning,  design,  and  construction  of  power\ndistribution  facilities.  It  is  the  recipient  of  the  previously  approved  power  sector  loan  (footnote\n13).  The  implementation  of  the  reconstruction  component  will  be  similar  to  those  already  in\nplace for the ongoing power sector project.\n\n56.\nFor part D, the IAs will be the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, and the\nIndustries and Mines Department, and such other state departments as may be agreed between\nthe ADB and the GOG.\n\n\f15\n\nPart  E  will  entail  management  and  technical  support  to  the  PMCU  and  the  IAs  for\n57.\nsmooth  and  efficient  implementation,  including  the  design,  procurement,  quality  control,\naccounting,  monitoring,  and  reporting  requirements  for  the  Project.  The  component  will  also\nprovide  support  for  capacity  building  of  the  responsible  agencies  focusing  on  operation  and\nmaintenance after reconstruction. In addition, the component will support GOG with the cost of\nthe incremental administrative outlays for project implementation. Part F will provide support for\nestablishing an effective multihazard disaster preparedness and mitigation program.\n\n4.\n\nSelection and Approval of Subprojects\n\nSubprojects will be identified, evaluated, and selected by the IAs, and endorsed by the\n\n58.\nPMCU, on the basis of the following criteria:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nwill  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  the  quake-damaged  infrastructure  including\nhousing;\n\nwill include works to restore the damaged facilities, incorporating strengthening to\nmultihazard  standards,  with  adequate  provision  for  technological  improvement,\nand quality control;\n\nwill follow cost effective and least-cost alternatives;\n\nwill not involve overlap with funding from other agencies, although other agencies\nsuch as bilaterals and NGOs could be involved in cofinancing, as well as in the\ndelivery of specified additional support such as monitoring, capacity building, and\npoverty reduction, in which case they will be clearly identified;\n\nexcept as otherwise agreed by ADB, is scheduled to be completed not later than\n31 December 2003, provided that in the case of part A an earlier completion date\nmay be scheduled;\n\n(vi) \n\nwill incorporate beneficiary consultation and input in the selection process; and\n\n(vii)\n\nwill  comply  with  applicable  ADB  requirements,  i.e.,  the  involuntary  resettlement\npolicy,22  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  of  the  ADB,  and \nthe\nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure,  Industrial,  and  Power\nDevelopment Projects.23\n\n59.\nThe  first  subproject  to  be  carried  out  by  each  IA  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  and\napproval  by  ADB.  Subsequent  subprojects  exceeding  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  sent  to  the\nPMCU and ADB for information only, while all subprojects exceeding $3 million equivalent will\nrequire prior review and approval by ADB. Any subproject involving significant resettlement will\nrequire  preparation  of  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines for  involuntary\nresettlement (footnote 22) and be agreed with ADB before carrying out the subproject.\n\n5.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nGiven the tight time schedule and the shortage of well-trained and experienced staff in\n60.\nGOG  and  GSDMA,  substantial  support  is  required  for  the  PMCU  and  the  IAs.

The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in  section  A  of\nAppendix  9.  About  60  person-months  of  international  and  132  person-months  of  domestic\nexpertise will be required.\n\n62.\nThe  PMCU  will  also  require  independent  consultants  for  benefit  monitoring  and\nevaluation  of  the  subprojects.  The  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultant  would  be  a\nlarger NGO operating in the affected areas with linkage to other NGOs active in the subproject\nareas, supported by specified outside experts. The outline terms of reference are also in section\nA of Appendix 9. About 320 person-months of domestic expertise is required.\n\n63.\nThe design and construction supervision consultants will support the individual IAs with\nthe  day-to-day  reconstruction  requirements,  including  (i)  identification,  prioritization,  and\nformulation of subprojects; (ii) detailed surveys and damage assessment of earthquake-related\ndamage; (iii) preparation of plans, designs, specifications, including earthquake resistance and\ncost  estimates;  (iv)  preparation  of  prequalification,  tender,  and  contract  documents;  (v)\nevaluation  of  bids  and  contract  awards;  (vi)  supervision  of  construction,  quality,  cost  and\nschedule  control,  measurement,  and  approvals  of  contractors\u2019  work  and  progress  claims;  (vii)\nissuance  of  completion  certificates;  and  (viii)  preparation  of  subproject  accounts,  audits,  and\nreports.

About 1,300 person-months of domestic expertise will be required,\nsupported by up to 5,000 person-months of domestic technical inspectors.24\n\n64.\nExtensive capacity building and training will be required for city, town, village, and other\nadministrations that will be responsible for operating and maintaining the reconstructed works.\nThis will be accommodated under the consulting services, and includes support to the Disaster\nManagement  Unit  under  GSDMA  as  outlined  in  Appendix  6,  and  for  monitoring  and  analyzing\nthe groundwater and aquifer conditions in the Kachchh region to determine the impacts of the\nearthquake. This is essential as groundwater provides 90 percent of the drinking water for more\nthan a million people living in the district.\n\n65.\nAll  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  the  PMCU  and  the  IAs  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the\nengagement of domestic consultants.  \n\n66.\nSince  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  work  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  must\nbe  completed  within  33  months  due  to  the  nature  of  the  Project,  expeditious  selection  and\n\n                                                \n24 GOG is fielding 3,000 technical engineers and inspectors to assess the earthquake damage. They provide on-site\n\ninspection and monitoring of the works in 15 cities, towns, and 1,100 villages damaged in the earthquake.\n\n\f17\n\nfielding of consultants is necessary. Accordingly, GSDMA and the IAs may recruit directly from\nconsultants already engaged for ADB-financed projects in India and providing services similar to\nthose  required  for  the  Project  for  design  and  construction  supervision.  This  arrangement  will\nprovide an efficient way to recruit consultants under the circumstances. At the request of GOG,\nADB will assist in the selection process, shortlisting, solicitation, and evaluation of proposals, as\nwell as contract negotiations.\n\n6.\n\nProcurement\n\nProcurement of goods and services to be financed by the Project will be carried out in\n67.\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Since  the  value  of  contracts  will  be\nrelatively small and scattered over a wide range of the affected areas of Gujarat, they are not\nlikely  to  attract  international  suppliers.  Equipment  and  materials  will  need  to  be  delivered  as\nquickly  as  possible  due  to  the  Project\u2018s  urgent  nature.  The  tight  delivery  schedules  will  be\nunattractive  to  international  suppliers  through  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.\nThese will therefore be procured through international shopping for goods not readily available\nin India, and local competitive bidding procedures for goods manufactured in India. This will not\npreclude international suppliers from bidding through their local outlets.\n\n68.\nThe  civil  works  contracts  will  generally  be  of  low  value,  below  $1  million  equivalent,\nexcept for a few that may be in the $3 million-$5 million range. These contracts will be for works\nin  several  towns,  districts,  and  villages  spread  across  the  affected  areas  of  Gujarat.  This\ncombined  with  the  local  conditions  caused  by  the  disaster,  requiring  construction  camps  with\nlimited facilities, will make interest from international contractors unlikely. All civil works will be\ncarried  out  through  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  No  separate\nprequalification requirements are needed, and the classification and registration procedures for\ncontractors already well established in GOG will be followed in most cases. However, because\nof  the  enormity  of  the  reconstruction  requirements,  national  contractors  who  are  not  already\nregistered  with  GOG\u2019s  system  will  be  encouraged  to  register  and  participate  in  the  bidding\nprocess by submitting their qualification information along with their bids. Two- envelope bidding\nprocedures  will  be  employed  as  appropriate.  The  qualification  criteria  used  for  similar  works\nunder ADB-financed projects elsewhere in India will be used as references in the preparation of\nbidding documents. ADB will also provide the responsible IAs with a list of national contractors\nwho have qualified and successfully completed similar works on other ADB-financed projects.\n\n69.\nAll contracts for equipment and materials valued at $100,000 equivalent or less will be\nprocured using direct purchase procedures acceptable to ADB. Prior ADB concurrence will be\nrequired for all contracts in excess of $3 million equivalent before award of contracts. The IAs\nwill  be  able  to  award  contracts  valued  below  $3  million  directly,  after  their  consultants  have\nevaluated  the  bids  per  ADB  procedures  and  requirements.  The  contracts  for  equipment  and\nmaterials  with  a  value  less  than  $3  million  can  be  procured  by  international  shopping  or  local\ncompetitive bidding. ADB will need to approve the first contract awarded by each IA, regardless\nof  value  to  ensure  ADB  procedures  are  met.  However,  for  the  power  sector,  procurement  of\nequipment packages valued at more than $100,000 equivalent but less than or equivalent to $5\nmillion  will  follow  international  shopping  procedures,  and  equipment  packages  with  a  value\nexceeding the equivalent of $5 million will follow international competitive bidding procedures. In\nthe  case  of  housing  by  individuals  (up  to  Rs90,000),  procurement  of  materials  and\nreconstruction  works  will  be  in  accordance  with  established  commercial  practices  and\nsatisfactory implementation arrangements acceptable to ADB.\n\n\f7.\n\nAdvance Action\n\n18\n\n70.\nGiven the urgency of the Project, ADB has approved advance action for the procurement\nof  equipment,  materials,  and  civil  works,  and  the  recruitment  of  consultants,  provided  such\nadvance action incorporates compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements and that this takes place on\nor  after  12  February  2001,  the  starting  date  for  project  appraisal.  The  Government  and  GOG\nhave been advised that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to finance any\npart of the Project.\n\n8.\n\nRetroactive Financing\n\n71.\nRetroactive financing is required for the financing of immediate rehabilitation of essential\nfacilities  such  as  water,  sanitation,  power,  housing,  and  consulting  services.  The  Project\ntherefore proposes provision of retroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred not earlier\nthan  12  February  2001  (date  of  appraisal),  provided  that  the  expenditures  are  in  accordance\nwith  agreed  procedures  and  are  certified  by  the  IAs  and  consultants,  and  the  certification  is\nacceptable to ADB.  Retroactive financing will not exceed $50 million equivalent (10 percent of\nthe  loan).  The  Government  and  GOG  have  been  advised  that  the  proposal  for  provision  for\nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.\n\n9.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n72.\nADB  and  GOG  have  agreed  that  the  implementation  will  be  completed  in  two  phases.\nThe  first  phase  is  the  restoration  of  critical  and  essential  facilities  such  as  housing,  power,\nwater, and basic sanitation, necessary to provide the more than one million affected people with\nminimum services during the reconstruction period until housing and services are fully restored.\nThe  second  phase  will  involve  implementation  of  the  remaining  facilities  and  is  scheduled  for\ncompletion  not  later  than  31  December  2003.  In  view  of  the  importance  of  shelter,\nimplementation  of  part  A,  housing,  is  scheduled  to  be  completed  within  a  shorter  time  frame.\nThe implementation schedule is provided in Appendix 10.\n\n10.\n\nImprest Accounts\n\nImprest  accounts  in  India  are  normally  operated  by  the  Government  through  the\n73.\nComptroller  of  Aid  Accounts  and  Audit  (CAAA).  The  proceeds  of  the  imprest  advance  are\nnormally retained by CAAA and released to the EA as reimbursement of expenditures already\nincurred  under  a  project.  However,  in  view  of  the  need  for  immediate  funding  of  rehabilitation\nand reconstruction under this Project, and the severe pressures on GOG\u2019s budget, the existing\nprocedure  need  to  be  modified  for  this  exceptional  case.  GSDMA  will  establish  a  second-\ngeneration  imprest  account  and  the  advances  made  to  the  imprest  account  maintained  by\nCAAA will be immediately and fully transferred through GOG to the second-generation imprest\naccount.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  operated  by  CAAA  and  GSDMA  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The statement of expenditures procedures may be used\nfor  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  to  liquidate  advances  into  the  imprest  account  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Any  individual  payment  to  be\nreimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of  expenditures  will  not  exceed  $100,000\nequivalent.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  replenished  on  an  as-required  basis,  within  the  total\nloan  amounts  for  each  of  parts  B,  C,  D,  and  F  subject  to  confirmation  by  ADB  that  sufficient\nprogress has been achieved in terms of actual implementation compared with the expenditures\nincurred. Similarly, replenishment for part A, housing, related to housing support for the poorer\nsections of the population, will be made after inspection and confirmation of the delivery of funds\nfor  the  specified  use  and  satisfactory  progress  on  house  construction  and  incorporation  of\nearthquake strengthening measures.\n\n\f19\n\nThe  Government  and  GOG  requested  initial  disbursement  under  the  loan  for  $100\n74.\nmillion in view of the expenses already incurred and estimated to be incurred in the coming six\nmonths.\n\n11.\n\nReports, Reviews, Accounts, and Audits\n\n75.\nOverall project monitoring will be conducted by GSDMA, through the PMCU. The PMCU\nwill  establish  a  reporting  system  for  performance  monitoring,  issues  resolution,  and  quarterly\naction  plans.  These  will  serve  as  management  feedback  to  update  and  improve  procedures,\nand provide the basis for quarterly reports to ADB. The action plans will incorporate quantitative\nand  time-bound  implementation  targets  and  budget  requirements.  The  action  plans  will  be\napproved by the IAs, PMCU, and GSDMA. ADB will be invited to attend the quarterly and other\nkey  meetings  required  to  facilitate  project  implementation.  Regular  field  review  will  also  be\ncarried out by staff from the ADB\u2019s extended mission (para. 46) in conjunction with the PMCU to\nmonitor the physical progress of the subprojects and compliance with other ADB requirements\nsuch  as  procurement,  quality  control,  proper  accounts,  beneficiary  participation,  and  NGO\nconsultations.\n\n76.\nThe Government and GOG will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project\nand  its  subprojects  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  GOG  will  ensure  and\nmonitor that proper audit and accounting procedures are in place by the PMCU, GSDMA, and\nIAs to ensure efficient and economical use of the loan proceeds for the beneficiaries. Separate\naccounts and financial statements in relation to the Project and subprojects adequate to identify\nthe  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources,  expenditures\nincurred, and the use of local funds will be maintained.  Such accounts and financial statements\nwill be maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles and certified by independent\nprivate  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  GSDMA  will  provide  to  ADB  (i)  reports  on  such  accounts\nand financial statements on a quarterly basis within 45 days of the close of each quarter, and (ii)\naccounts  and  financial  statements  as  audited  and  certified,  on  a  semiannual  basis  within  60\ndays  of  the  close  of  each  semiannual  period.  The  Government  and  GOG  will  facilitate  ADB\nrepresentatives to carry out spot or random checks on flow of funds through the imprest account\nmaintained  by  the  Government,  and  the  second-generation  imprest  account  maintained  by\nGSDMA. Within three months of the physical completion of each part of the Project, GOG will\nsubmit  to  ADB  a  detailed  completion  report  on  the  implementation,  costs,  benefits,  and  other\ninformation required by ADB.  Annual certified audited accounts and financial statements will be\nprovided by GSDMA through GOG within nine months of the close of each financial year.\n\n12.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n77.\nAll  public  facilities  reconstructed  under  the  Project  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by\nrelevant  agencies  during  and  after  completion  of  the  works.  For  the  infrastructure  component\nunder part B, this refers to the participating towns, cities, and villages supported by GWSSB. If\nrequested, bulk water supply will be operated by GWSSB and the town and village facilities by\nthe  local  committees.    GUDCO  will  support  the  larger  towns  in  exploring  privatization  of\noperation  and  maintenance  of  revenue  generating  services.  For  part  C,  power  systems\nrehabilitation, the reconstructed facilities will be operated and maintained by GEB. For each of\nthe  two  components  under  part  B(cid:190) urban  infrastructure,  and  rural  infrastructure  (water  supply\nand sanitation)(cid:190) extensive capacity building of the responsible agencies, in particular the urban\nand rural departments, is essential. The initial operation and maintenance cost for one year after\nthe completion of such facilities may be financed under the Project.\n\n\f13.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\n20\n\n78.\nBeneficiary  and  community  awareness  and  participation  is  essential  to  ensure  that  the\nrehabilitation  meets  their  requirements  and  needs,  and  that  the  local  beneficiaries  have\nownership.  This  aspect  is  particularly  important  in  the  wake  of  the  disastrous  earthquake  that\nclaimed  numerous  lives  and  directly  affected  almost  two  million  people  through  loss  of  their\nhousing  and  livelihood.  For  some  communities,  relocation  of  some  residences  to  alternative\nsites may be required or desirable because of the complete destruction of homes and facilities\nand  their  location  along  seismic  fault  lines.  The  tradition  of  community  awareness  and  NGO\nsupport  is  strong  in  the  affected  areas.  The  rural  local  government  system,  the  Gram\nPanchayat, already utilizes a public consultation and participation approach involving NGOs and\ncommunity organizations that will be strengthened and supported under the housing and rural\ninfrastructure  components.  GOG  has  made  strong  commitments  to  collaborate  with  suitable\nNGOs  to  carry  out  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  work  at  the  local  government  level.  Such\nNGOs  will  act  as  IAs  at  the  village  level  and  will  be  appropriately  compensated  for  their\nservices.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n79.\nThe Project is classified as a Category B environmental project, as it is unlikely to have\nany  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Civil  works  will  involve  rehabilitation  and\nreconstruction  of  damaged  or  destroyed  housing  and  infrastructure.  Generally  this  will  follow\nexisting  alignments.  For  relocation  of  housing,  the  sites  and  services  will  be  located  near\nexisting cities, towns, or villages. Land will be acquired from public lands as far as possible. The\nheavily impacted areas of Kachchh, where this may be necessary, has low population density,\nlittle  or  no  agricultural  activity,  and  extensive  space  providing  options  for  acquiring  additional\nland. Any land acquisition and resettlement under the Project will be undertaken in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement (footnote 22). Hazardous waste from the debris, if\nany, will be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner satisfactory to ADB.\n\n80.\nAll  subprojects  will  be  designed  to  follow  environmental  safeguards  and  technical\nspecifications  established  for  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects,  which  have  already  been\nsubjected to ADB\u2019s initial environmental examination procedures. The subprojects will follow the\nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  for  selected  infrastructure,  industrial,  and\npower  development  projects.  If  a  subproject  involves  land  acquisition  or  new  alignments,  the\nresponsible IA will submit an initial environmental examination for ADB\u2019s review and approval.\n\nH.\n\nThe Proposed Technical Assistance\n\n1. \n\nObjective and Scope\n\nThe  objective  of \n\nthe  TA,  Capacity  Building \n\nfor  Earthquake  Rehabilitation  and\n81.\nReconstruction  of  Housing, \nto  support  the  Panchayats,  Rural  Housing  and  Rural\nDevelopment Department (PRHD) and the Urban Development and Urban Housing Department\n(UDHD) in implementing GOG\u2019s reconstruction program for earthquake-damaged housing. The\nTA will help:\n\nis \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPRHD and UDHD (a) upgrade standards, and (b) build capacity to develop and\nimplement  regulatory  systems  and  codes,  land  use  planning,  and  zoning  and\ndevelopment planning;\n\ngenerate capacity for PRHD, UDHD, and their various supportive and agencies,\nand for NGOs to oversee the housing rehabilitation and reconstruction;\n\n\f21\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nimplement  the  system  for  monitoring  cash  flow  to  confirm  proper  construction\nbefore release of funds; and\ngenerate  techniques  and  simple  procedures  for  monitoring  the  structure  to\nconfirm  that  the  required  standards  and  construction  techniques  have  been\nincorporated.\n\n2. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n82.\nThe cost of the TA is estimated at $1,650,000 equivalent, including $480,000 in foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $1,170,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide  $1,300,000\nequivalent  to  fund  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $820,000  equivalent  of  the  local\ncurrency cost on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The Government and GOG\nwill contribute $350,000 equivalent in kind.\n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n83.\nThe implementation office jointly established by PRHD and UDHD will be the Executing\nAgency. The TA consultants will also support and work closely with the districts, municipalities,\nvillage entities, and NGOs involved in housing reconstruction in the earthquake-affected areas.\nThe  consultants  will report  directly to INRM and liaise closely with the project consultants and\nADB\u2019s extended mission in Gandhinagar.\n\n84.\nThe  TA  will  finance  115  person-months  of  consulting  services:  15  person-months  of\ninternational and 100 person-months of domestic consulting input. Expertise will include house\nand  building  construction,  design  of  structures  incorporating  strengthening  for  earthquake  and\ncyclone  resistance,  building  codes,  land  use  zoning,  urban  planning,  seismology,  and\nmicrozoning  related  to  structural  designs,  disaster  management,  and  training.  The  consultants\nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants on the basis of\nsimplified  technical  proposals.  Reports  will  be  prepared  on  a  quarterly  basis  summarizing\nprogress to date and work programs for the next quarter. The TA is expected to commence in\nJune 2001 and be completed by April 2002.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nImpact on Poverty and Other Benefits\n\n85.\nThe earthquake has been as much a socioeconomic disaster to individual households as\na disaster to physical infrastructure. About 1.3 million people in rural areas and 0.45 million in\nurban areas have been rendered homeless; many have lost all their basic survival necessities\nincluding clothing and household essentials. The 770,000 houses, destroyed or damaged in five\nof  the  worst  affected  districts  of  Jamnagar,  Kachchh,  Patan,  Rajkot,  and  Surendranagar,\naccount for nearly 45 percent of all households in these areas. Since damage is more intense in\ncertain villages and towns, the percentage of households affected in these locations would be\nmarkedly higher, implying that a higher percentage of the people have entered the ranks of the\npoor.  Considering  the  extent  of  damage,  the  cost  of  rebuilding  houses  and  infrastructure\nfacilities  is  exorbitant  both  for  affected  households  and  for  the  state.  Support  both  in  terms  of\nfinancial  assistance  as  well  as  improved  earthquake  resistant  technology  would  be  of\nconsiderable benefit in protecting the poor and affected people from falling further into poverty.\nIt  would  help  families  resettle,  provide  a  safer  and  healthier  environment,  and  stabilize\nlivelihoods.\n\n\f22\n\nThe  rehabilitation  of  urban  and  rural  infrastructure,  particularly  water  supply  and\n86.\nsanitation,  will  facilitate  the  provision  of  drinking  water,  reduce  the  risk  of  health-related\nproblems, and improve the quality of life. Support for physical reconstruction in key sectors like\npower  would  have  positive  secondary  effects  in  reviving  industries  and  agriculture.  By\nrehabilitating  public  and  community  infrastructure,  the  Project  will  help  restore  economic  and\nsocial activities disrupted by the disaster.\n\n87.\nThe Project envisages livelihood restoration that could help prevent the current adverse\neffects of the disaster on the affected poor. Livelihoods have been badly affected and this, along\nwith  the  destruction  of  household  investments,  has  been  draining  meagre  household  savings\nand adversely impacting on levels of income and capability poverty in the region. The possibility\nof an adverse impact in terms of reduced consumption, migration, and increased child labor in\npoor family is increasing. The rehabilitation works will entail labor intensive civil works contracts,\nusing unskilled and semiskilled local labor, thereby providing employment opportunities for the\npoor.  Livelihood  rehabilitation  for  local  artisans,  craftsmen,  and  self-employed  people  in  the\naffected  area  will  facilitate  recovery  of  the  local  economy,  thereby  restoring  more  long-term\nemployment  opportunities.  The  Project\u2019s  component  for  livelihood  restoration  will  benefit  poor\nfamilies as well as those forced into poverty by the disaster. The training envisaged for various\ncategories  of  skills  would  help  in  the  economic  and  social  rehabilitation  of  those  severely\naffected,  like  the  physically  disabled  and  widows.  The  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  evident\nthrough economic rehabilitation arising from speedy reconstruction of infrastructure and facilities\nand livelihood restoration in the earthquake-affected areas.\n\nB.\n\nRisks\n\n88.\nRisks  related  to  the  ambitious  implementation  period,  and  GOG\u2019s  ability  to  assign  the\nnecessary priorities, staff, and budgets could affect implementation of parts A, C, and D. Thus\nIAs to implement the Project must be experienced and the recovery strategy must be properly\nsequenced to distinguish between immediate and medium-term measures. In this way, scarce\nmanagerial and implementation capacity will be focused on priority issues and avoid spreading\navailable resources too thinly. For the Project, experienced IAs were selected, including GEB for\npower  sector  rehabilitation; \nthe  Panchayats,  Rural  Housing  and  Rural  Development\nDepartment,  and  GUDCO  and  the  Urban  Development  and  Urban  Housing  Department  for\nparts  C  and  B,  respectively.  Moreover,  the  Department  of  Social  Justice  and  Empowerment,\nand the Industries and Mines Department, as IAs for part D, are already implementing livelihood\nsupport schemes and have adequate experience. Some risks are associated with part B in view\nof  the  large  number  of  geographically  dispersed  urban  localities,  and  the  relative  unfamiliarity\nwith the sector approach at the local level, which may delay progress in implementation. Strong\nconsultant  support  is  therefore  being  provided  for  assistance  with  design  and  construction,\ntendering and bid evaluation, account maintenance, reporting, and audit. Moreover, consultant\nsupport for overall management of the rehabilitation project is provided to GSDMA. The risk of\ngovernance-related  issues  is  addressed  by  the  detailed  selection  criteria,  transparent\nimplementation and monitoring mechanisms, and specific financial controls including regular as\nwell  as  random  audits.  As  discussed  with  GOG  during  appraisal  and  in  meetings  with  the\nGovernment,  implementation  of  part  A  will  be  carried  out  under  proper  identification  and\naccounting  procedures  considering  that  the  large  number  of  beneficiaries  under  the  housing\ncomponent  will  be  individuals  who  have  lost  personal  identification  records  and  belongings  in\nthe  earthquake.  Furthermore,  with  the  proposed  establishment  of  ADB\u2019s  extended  mission  in\nGandhinagar (para. 46), ADB will play a proactive role in addressing implementation problems\nand in encouraging proper financial management.\n\n\f23\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government and GOG have given the following specific assurances, in addition to\n\n89.\nthe standard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v) \n\n(vi)\n\nGOG  will  ensure  that  all  facilities  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed  under  the\nProject are operated and maintained by GSDMA, and thereafter by the relevant\nagencies taking over from GSDMA after completion of the works. GOG will make\navailable, on a timely basis, the necessary funds for operation and maintenance\nof  all  the  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed  public  facilities  during  and  after\nimplementation.\n\nGOG will allocate, on a timely basis, adequate counterpart funds from its budget\nfor each fiscal year during project implementation.\n\nGOG  will  ensure  that  the  GSDMA  is  adequately  staffed  by  competent  and\nqualified personnel for the effective implementation of the Project.\n\nThe  PMCU  and  IAs  will  actively  seek  NGO  and  community  involvement  and\nparticipation \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  rehabilitation  and\nreconstruction of infrastructure under the Project.\n\nthe \n\nin \n\nThe  Government  will  upon  receipt  of  the  loan  proceeds  immediately  and  fully\ntransfer such proceeds to the second-generation imprest account established by\nGSDMA.  Such  transfers  will  be  treated  as  additional  central  plan  assistance  to\nGOG.\n\ninfrastructure  under \n\nGOG will ensure that the reconstruction of affected houses and other urban and\nincorporating\nmunicipal \nstrengthened  seismic,  high  wind  (cyclone),  earthquake,  and  flood  resistant\nspecifications and provisions. To this extent, GOG will monitor and ensure quality\ncontrol  of  the  construction,  materials  to  be  used  in  the  reconstruction  of\ninfrastructure and houses, and clearing and approval of contractors and builders\nfor the reconstruction, where applicable.\n\nthe  Project  will  proceed, \n\n(vii)  GOG  will  initiate  administrative  approvals  to  ensure  compulsory  comprehensive\ninsurance  of  reconstructed  public  infrastructure  and  housing  property,  and\nencourage  similar  insurance  for  private  property;  this  will  include  insurance\nagainst natural calamities such as earthquake, cyclones, and flood.\n\n(viii) GOG will ensure and monitor that proper audit and accounting procedures are in\nplace  to  ensure  efficient  and  economical  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  for  the\nbeneficiaries.

The  impact  was  most  severe  in  Kachchh  district,  although\nAhmedabad, Jamnagar, Patan, Rajkot, and Surendranagar districts also experienced extensive\ndamage  to  human  lives  and  property.  The  destruction  in  Kachchh  was  massive.  The  most\nseverely  affected  subdistricts  (talukas)  were  Anjar,  Bhachau,  Bhuj,  Gandhidham  and  Rapar.\nTens  of  thousands  of  structures  completely  collapsed,  while  the  remaining  have  either  been\ndamaged or developed cracks rendering them unsafe for occupation. The indicative dimensions\nof the damage in rural and urban areas are summarized here:1\n\n1.\n\nRural Housing\n\n2.\nThe rural population comprises 65 percent (27 million) of the state population. The total\nhouseholds  in  rural  Gujarat  prior  to  the  earthquake  numbered  4.8  million.  The  majority  of  the\npeople in rural areas reside in kachha (stone rubble masonry set in mud mortar with structural\nroof)  or  semipucca  (same  as  kachha  but  with  thatch  roof)  houses.  The  earthquake  has\ndamaged  or  destroyed  housing  in  1,100  villages. According  to  preliminary  estimates,  about\n180,700  houses  have  collapsed  completely  and  413,000  are  partially  damaged.  In  addition,\nabout 110,000 huts have been destroyed and another 75,000 huts partially damaged.\n\nThe  estimated  number  of  housing  units  affected  in  larger  towns  and  municipalities  is\n\n3.\n23,979 and 117,666 respectively.\n\n2.\n\nUrban Housing\n\n3.\n\nIndirect Damage\n\n4.\nThe  earthquake  rendered  over  300,000  rural  families  homeless.  Further,  due  to  the\ncontinuing  aftershocks,  most  of  the  other  400,000  households,  whose  houses  have  been\npartially damaged, are afraid to reoccupy their houses. These households have also lost most of\ntheir  personal  effects,  including  property  deeds,  bank  statements  and  other  valuables.  The\nGovernment of Gujarat (GOG) estimates the loss of personal effects to exceed $1 billion. The\nquake  has  led  to  a  sharp  drop  in  market  prices  and  demand  for  apartments  in  multistory\nbuildings  in  all  cities  and  towns.  A  further  impact  is  on  the  housing  finance  sector.  In  many\ncases the value of damaged housing is insufficient collateral for the housing finance companies\nand other financial institutions holding the loans. GOG has therefore taken steps to ensure that\naffected families are protected.\n\nB.\n\nGujarat Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program for Housing\n\n5.\nGOG has prepared a comprehensive rehabilitation and reconstruction program including\nhousing  reconstruction.  As  an  immediate  measure,  GOG  has  announced  a  preliminary\nrehabilitation and reconstruction package for housing.\n\n6.\nA  detailed  assessment  of  the  degree  of  destruction  of  the  housing  stock  is  currently\nbeing  undertaken.  Discussions  are  also  under  way  with  the  residents  of  the  256  villages  that\nwere  completely  destroyed  to  determine  if  relocation  is  favored  over  reconstruction  at  the\ncurrent  site  (in  situ  reconstruction).  In  all  cases,  when  reconstruction  is  to  take  place,  rubble\n                                                \n1 Detailed assessment on a house by house basis is now under way by trained teams to update the numbers.\n\n\fremoval  must  be  carried  out  with  due  regard  to  the  foundation  conditions  required  for\nearthquake resistance.\n\n27\n\nAppendix 1, page 2\n\nC.\n\nProject Scope\n\nThe  Project  comprises  reconstruction  of  damaged  houses  of  the  poorer  segments\n7.\nincluding (i) all huts, (ii) economically weaker section, and (iii) lower income group (LIG) houses,\nup to a maximum unit size of 50 square metres (m2).2 Repair of such housing units will also be\nundertaken  to  facilitate  early  rehabilitation  and  avoidable  displacement  of  people  in  the\ndamaged houses. This is essential for livelihood restoration and economic activity rejuvenation\nin the area. Geographically the focus will be on housing in the rural areas.\n\n8.\nThe  initial  rehabilitation  policy  announced  by  GOG  will  provide  grants  for  rebuilding\nhouses  and  shelters.  Given  the  enhanced  cost  of  building  earthquake  resistant  houses,\nminimum grant of about $900 equivalent per unit in rural areas has been proposed, which would\nenable  replacing  huts  with  earthquake  resistant  structures.  An  examination  of  the  vulnerability\nmaps  for  the  region3  indicates  that  52  percent  of  the  houses  in  Jamnagar,  70  percent  in\nKachchh, 48.8 percent in Rajkot, and 85.5 percent in Surendranagar have a Category A type of\nstructure  using  unburned  bricks,  clay,  and  field  stone,  all  of  which  have  low  earthquake\nresistance.  The  CASHPOR  House  Index4  indicates  that  semipermanent  materials  for  the\nconstruction of various parts of a house are also indicators of poverty.\n\nFor the lower income group with a house size of up to 50m2, the extent of assistance will\n9.\nbe a maximum of Rs90,000. Based on available data, 40 percent of the affected households fall\ninto the lower income group.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  cost  for  house  reconstruction  under  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $250  million\n10.\nequivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost component comprises 12 percent or $30 million\nwhile the equivalent local currency cost is $220 million (Table A1). The proposed loan of $200\nmillion  will  finance  all  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $170  million  equivalent  of  the  local\ncurrency costs. GOG will finance the remaining local currency costs of $50 million equivalent.\n\nTable A1: Cost Estimate and Financing Plan for Housing Reconstruction\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nADB\nFinancing\n\nGOG\nFinancing\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nReconstruction and rehabilitation\nTotal\nPercent\n\n30\n30\n12\n\n220\n220\n88\n\n200\n200\n80\n\n50\n50\n20\n\n250\n250\n100\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, GOG = Government of Gujarat.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n                                                \n2 This covers rehabilitation packages No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 of GOG\u2019s Resolution No. PNV-162001-1502 (1)- S.3,\n\ndated 23 February 2001.\n\n3 Government  of  India.  1997.

The Panchayats, Rural Housing, and Rural Development Department will be\nthe Implementing Agency for the rural housing. A project implementation unit will be established\nunder the PRHD. The unit will implement a beneficiary registration system including issuance of\npicture identification before release of the second payment for the housing component.\n\nF.\n\nDisbursement of Loan Proceeds\n\nDisbursement procedures will be in accordance with Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB)\n12.\nLoan Disbursement Handbook. An initial imprest advance commensurate with requirements will\nbe  provided.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be \nthe\nfor \nreimbursements of expenditures, and for the liquidation of the imprest account for payment.\n\nfollowed \n\nImplementation  will  commence  in  April  2001  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  during\n\nG.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n13.\n2002.\n\nH.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n14.\nConsulting services will be required to monitor the quality of construction of new housing\nunits, with particular reference to incorporation of earthquake-resistant features. This monitoring\nwill  involve  domestic  consultants,  government  and  supportive/facilitating  nongovernment\norganizations  and  other  representation  from  the  local  community.  They  will  be  responsible  for\nchecking quality and costs, and will signoff on all progress claims by contractors or individuals.\nApproximately 3,600 person-months of consulting input for about $5 million are required. Should\nGOG  decide  to  retain  the  3,000  engineers  and  technicians  currently  being  fielded  to  conduct\ndamage assessments, they could be financed from this contract.\n\n15. \n\nThe outline terms of reference for the consulting services are provided in Appendix 9.\n\n\f29\n\nAppendix 2, page 1\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nURBAN INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nThe  earthquake  impacted  21  of  the  25  districts  of  Gujarat.  While  80  percent  of  the\n1.\ndamage  was  in  4  districts,  the  impact  on  the  urban  municipal  infrastructure  varied  widely.\nFifteen towns in Kachchh, Rajkot, Surendranagar districts and Ahmedabad corporation suffered\nsevere damage. In Kachchh, the municipalities and cities particularly affected were Bhuj, Anjar,\nRapar, Bhachau, Gandhidham, and Mandvi; in Rajkot: Morvi and Wankaner; in Surendranagar:\nSurendranagar,  Limdi,  Thangadh,  Dhrangdhara,  Halwad,  and  Wadhwan;  and  in  Ahmedabad:\nAhmedabad.\n\nFurther  to  the  ongoing  relief  efforts  focusing  on  food,  medical  care,  and  temporary\n2.\nshelters,  essential  services  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation  need  to  be  improved  on\nimmediately.  The  lack  of  basic  amenities  such  as  water  and  sanitation,  closure  of  commercial\nactivities,  damaged  municipal  buildings,  lack  of  health  centers,  and  damaged  schools,  are\ncreating  extreme  hardship  for  those  affected.  The  Project  will  help  install  the  immediately\nrequired  minimum  services  to  sustain  life  for  those  affected,  while  rehabilitation  and\nreconstruction of all facilities are carried out over the next 33 months.\n\nB.\n\nObjective and Scope\n\n3.\nThe main objective of this project component is to finance both the immediately required\nminimum  services,  and  the  reconstruction  of  all  services,  incorporating  multihazard  resistance\nfor  earthquake,  cyclone,  and  drought,  which  are  all  prevalent  in  the  affected  areas.  All  the\ndamage  to  urban  infrastructure  caused  by  the  recent  earthquake  will  be  eligible.  Eligible\nsubcomponents  include  water  supply,  treatment,  and  distribution;  wastewater  collection  and\ntreatment; sanitation; solid waste management; drains; roads and street lighting; municipal and\npublic  buildings;  municipal  markets;  community  center;  library;  fire  brigade  complex  and\nequipment;  tax  collection  post;  stores  and  godowns  and  related  equipment  and  facilities;  and\nrubble  removal  and  disposal.  The  scope  and  cost  of  this  component  will  be  adjusted  through\ndetailed planning, damage assessments, surveys, and designs.\n\n4.\nIn the most severely affected towns of Anjar, Bhachau, Bhuj, Rapar, Gandhidham, and\nMorvi, the densely populated town core areas were completely devastated.1 The water supply\nsystem is severely damaged; civil structures, pumps and motors, bore wells, and generator sets\nneed major repairs, and in many cases complete replacement. The sewerage system piping is\ndamaged, and drains are destroyed. At many of the sites, the electrical lines have snapped. The\nroads  are  generally  intact  except  for  minor  damage  to  the  pavement  structures.  In  addition  to\nthese  areas,  other  towns  suffered  various  degrees  of  damage.  Ahmedabad,  the  state  capital\nwas also damaged, though less severely.\n\n5.\nThe overall damage assessment, scope, and cost estimates were based on a thorough\non-site  evaluation  by  a  joint  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)/World  Bank  team,  supported  by\nstate, district, and local officials. Anjar with a prequake population of 77,000 is typical of the six\nworst  hit  towns;  4,000  people  died,  35,000  were  injured,  and  more  than  6,000  houses  were\nseverely  damaged  or  outright  destroyed,  making  30,000  people  homeless.  Based  on  this\ndetailed  analysis,  government  teams  updated  their  initial  assessment  in  the  other  affected\ntowns.\n                                                \n1 Restructuring  of  these  areas  will  need  to  follow  proper  planning  including  widening  of  streets  and  increase  in\n\nminimum lot size.\n\n\f30\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nThe city core (5 of the 12 municipal wards) of Anjar, with a prequake population of about\n6.\n25,000, suffered severe damage to all buildings, and urban infrastructure. Anjar\u2019s water supply\nsystem  consists  of  a  network  of  15  deep  bore  wells,  sumps,  multistage  pumps,  overhead\nreservoirs, and a 45 kilometer (km) long distribution network of asbestos cement and polyvinyl\nchloride pipes. Reconstruction works include replacement of 8 bore wells, the water disinfection\nand chlorination plant, pumping house, and about 25 km of the water distribution piping network\nranging from 75 millimeter (mm) to 450 mm diameter, some 50 percent of the total will have to\nbe  relaid  using  earthquake  resistant  pipe  material  such  as  cast  or  ductile  iron.  Three  high\nground-level  reservoirs  have  developed  cracks  and  will  require  a  thorough  investigation  to\ndetermine their structural integrity. All related civil structures will be reconstructed incorporating\nearthquake and cyclone resistance.\n\nThe  sewerage  system  in  Anjar,  consisting  of  open  gutters,  utility  holes,  and  66  km  of\n7.\ngravity sewers (150 to 450 mm diameters, mainly reinforced concrete cement and glaced stone\nware) has suffered extensive cracks and damage. The extent of damage to the reticulation has\nto be confirmed using appropriate equipment. A conservative estimate indicates that half of the\nsewerage network will have to be relaid.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimate\n\n8.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  component  is  $86  million  equivalent  as  summarized  in  Table  A2:\nabout 20 percent ($17 million) for foreign exchange costs and 80 percent ($69 million) for local\ncurrency costs.\n\nTable A2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\nA.

Under\nthe PMCU, the Gujarat Urban Development Company (GUDCO),2 a semiautonomous financing\nand  implementation  utility  under  Urban  Development  and  Urban  Housing  Department  of  the\nGujarat Government, will be the Implementing Agency for this component. GUDCO will assign a\nsenior level project director and a core group of experienced specialists from line departments\n                                                \n2 GUDCO  will  also  receive  training,  standard  bidding  documents,  and  instructions  on  ADB\u2019s  procurement,\n\nmonitoring, reporting, and other procedures from the project management consultant supporting the PMCU.\n\n\f31\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nor  by  hiring  new  staff  to  implement  this  project  component.  GUDCO  will  work  closely  with  the\nGujarat  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Board,  the  parastatal  utility  responsible  for  bulk  water\nsupply to both urban and rural areas, and with the local municipal committees to ensure their full\ninvolvement.\n\nE.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n10.\nGUDCO  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of  domestic  design  and  construction  supervision\nconsultants  reporting  to  the  project  director.  The  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  detailed\ndamage  assessments,  surveys,  planning,  design,  specifications,  bidding,  quality  control,  and\ncontract  management  including  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  support.  The\nconsultants  will  be  recruited  following  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other\narrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  About  426\nperson-months  of  professional  consulting  input,  and  880  person-months  of  technical  input  will\nbe required, at an estimated cost of $3.3 million. The areas of expertise include team leader and\nmunicipal engineer, procurement specialists, water supply and wastewater engineers, contract\nmanagement  specialist,  earthquake  engineer,  construction  engineers,  construction  inspectors,\nand quantity surveyors. Outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 9.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n11.\nImplementation of the immediate requirements is ongoing and will be completed by June\n2001, before the monsoon, following procedures acceptable to ADB. Recruitment of consultants\ncommenced  and  full  scale  operation  is  expected  to  start  in  July  2001,  with  completion  by\nDecember 2003, as indicated in Appendix 10.\n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 3, page 1\n\nRURAL INFRASTRUCTURE (WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION)\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nWhile 80 percent of the quake-damage was in the four districts of Ahmedabad, Kachchh,\n1.\nRajkot,  and  Surendranagar,  the  impact  on  the  bulk  water  supply  and  village  water  systems\nvaried  widely  among  the  affected  districts.  Of  1,100  villages  in  these  four  districts,  256  were\ncompletely destroyed and the remaining 850 suffered varying degrees of damage. Furthermore,\nwater  supply  for  both  villages  and  towns,  consisting  mostly  of  well  fields  and  related  pipeline\nand  infrastructure,  were  severely  damaged.  The  Project  will  help  provide  the  immediately\nrequired basic services improvement, while rehabilitation and reconstruction of all facilities are\ncarried out.\n\nB.\n\nObjective and Scope\n\nThe main objective of this component is to finance restoration of the bulk and rural water\n2.\nsupply systems, incorporating multihazard resistance against earthquake, cyclone, and drought,\nwhich are prevalent throughout the area.\n\nAll the damage caused by the recent earthquake will be eligible for Asian Development\n3.\nBank (ADB) assistance. The damages were assessed by the joint ADB and World Bank team\nsupported by the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB). The main scope of the\nbulk and rural water supply component includes\n\n(i) \n\nrestoring  temporary  water  supply  by  providing  tankers,  tractors/trailers,  diesel\ngenerator (DG) sets, and mobile laboratory units;\n\n(ii) \n\nrepairing 400 deep tubewells and pumping installations;\n\n(iii) \n\nconducting detailed leak detection, and  repairs or replacement;\n\n(iv) \n\nrehabilitating local distribution systems in 1,100 villages;\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nreplacing  an  estimated  2,000  kilometer  (km)  of  asbestos  cement  transmission\npipelines with metallic pipes (mild steel, ductile iron) which are less susceptible to\nearthquake effects; and\n\nproviding  institutional  strengthening,  capacity  building,  damage  assessment\nsurveys  and  acquifer  exploration  study,  and  domestic  design  and  construction\nsupervision.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimate\n\nThe rehabilitation and reconstruction cost of the bulk and rural water supply component\n4.\nis  estimated  at  $132  million  equivalent  as  summarized  in  Table  A3.  About  21  percent  (i.e.,\n$28  million)  is  for  foreign  exchange  costs  and  79  percent  (i.e.,  $104  million)  local  currency\ncosts.\n\n\f33\n\nTable A3: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nItem\nA.

Recruitment of consultants has commenced and\nfull scale operation is expected to start in the second quarter of 2001, with completion by end-\n2003, as indicated in Appendix 10.\n\n\f35\n\nPOWER\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n1.\nWhile some of the thermal power stations (Kachchh Lignite Thermal Power Station, the\nSikka  Thermal  Power  Station,  and  the  Dhuvaran  Thermal  Power  Station)  suffered  minor\ndamage, the transmission and distribution systems in Banaskatha, Jamnagar, Kachchh, Rajkot,\nand Surendranagar districts were severely affected. In particular, damage occurred at the 220\nkilovolt (kV) substations at Anjar, Nakhatrana, and Nani Kakhar, at two 132 kV substations (Bhuj\nand  Samkhyali),  and  at  44  substations  at  66  kV  level  in  Bhuj,  Jamnagar,  Rajkot,  and\nSurendranagar. Control rooms collapsed, power transformers toppled over, and equipment was\ndamaged. Extensive damage also occurred to the distribution system (11 kV feeders and 0.415\nkV  low-tension  lines),  affecting  most  of  the  villages  in  the  region.  Disruption  of  power  supply\nimpacts on the provision of normal basic services, particularly water supply and sanitation.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n2.\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  restore  reliable  and  efficient  power  supply  to  the\naffected areas. The project scope includes (i) replacement of damaged equipment, construction\nof substation buildings, and houses for the operating staff; and (ii) renovation and strengthening\nof  the  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  This  will  enable  the  Gujarat  Electricity  Board\n(GEB) to achieve the level of service provided prior to the earthquake.\n\n3.\nExisting  designs  of  the  power  system  are  not  appropriate  to  effectively  minimize  the\nimpact  of  earthquake.  Therefore,  replaced  assets  will  need  to  incorporate  technologies  for\nearthquake resistance. However, as the replacement of damaged (old) equipment will create an\nimbalance  in  reliability  of  different  parts  of  the  system,  renovation  and  strengthening  of\ntransmission  lines  and  substations  will  be  required  to  ensure  matching  reliability  of  the  power\nsystem.  Moreover,  technical  systems  upgrading  will  be  required  to  improve  efficiency  by  (i)\nconverting  the  low-tension  feeders  to  the  more  efficient  high-tension  system;  and  (ii)  installing\ncapacitors and meters.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n4. \nThe total cost of the Project for the power sector component is estimated at $97.9 million\nequivalent  as  summarized  in  Table  A4.  The  estimate  is  based  on  a  detailed  analysis  of  the\ndamages  caused,  cost  of  replacement  equipment  and  materials,  and  the  number  of  buildings\nand staff quarters that need reconstruction.\n\nTable A4: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nGeneration System\nTransmission System\nDistribution System\nCivil Works\n\nSubtotal\n\nPhysical and Price Contingencies\n\nTotal\n\nEstimated Cost\n\n2.8\n36.1\n35.7\n11.5\n86.1\n11.8\n97.9\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nD.\n\nImplementing Arrangements\n\n5.\nGEB will be the Implementing Agency for the power sector component of the Project. A\nGEB task force will be constituted to oversee implementation. The task force will operate under\nthe overall guidance of the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA). The Asian\nDevelopment Bank Cell of GEB will be responsible for procurement; assistance to supervision\nstaff  in  implementation;  overall  management,  coordination,  and  oversight;  audit  of  project\naccounts  and  financial  statements,  and  preparation  of  regular  progress  reports  and  project\ncompletion reports. The heads of the Civil, Transmission, Distribution and Generation divisions\nof GEB will be responsible for implementing the subprojects under their respective divisions.\n\nE.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nFor  the  power  sector  component,  a  total  of  24  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\n6.\nservices  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $0.15  million  equivalent  will  be  required  to  prepare  the\nspecifications  and  designs  of  the  foundations,  substation  buildings,  houses,  and  site\nsupervision. The consultant should be an experienced structural design engineer, with particular\nexperience in the design of multidisaster resistant structures.\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 5, page 1\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nLIVELIHOOD REHABILITATION\n\n1.\nThe  earthquake  has  disrupted  the  economy  of  the  affected  areas  through  widespread\ndamages to the assets, tools, implements, raw materials, and work places, and of human capital\nitself.  The  main  economic  activities  in  the  affected  areas  included  dry-land  farming,  animal\nhusbandry,  handicrafts,  handlooms,  salt  production,  construction,  and  other  trades  including\ngems  and  jewelry.  Livelihoods  of  not  only  the  existing  poor,  but  of  many  others  who  had  a\nfragile economic stability, have now been adversely affected.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives\n\n2.\nLivelihoods  have  been  affected  and  packages  for  restoration  will  have  to  address\nvarious  categories  differently.  The  needs  of  the  affected  can  be  broadly  grouped  under  three\ncategories:  (i)  livelihood  restoration  through  financial  and  infrastructure  support,  (ii)  livelihood\nrestoration through retraining, and (iii) economic compensation for loss of livelihood.\n\nLivelihood  Restoration  through  Financial  and  Infrastructure  Support.  This  will\n3.\ncover  the  categories  of  affected  persons  whose  skill  base  is  intact,  but  who  need  support  in\nterms of restoration of assets, tools, and work places. This category will require support in terms\nof  supply  of  tool  kits,  seed  money,  and  assistance  in  marketing  for  some  interim  period.\nLivelihood restoration support requirements include (i) replacement of tools and facilities lost, (ii)\nproduction credit to cover the cost of basic materials, and (iii) marketing support.\n\n4.\nLivelihood Restoration through Retraining. Many women have been left destitute by\nthe  quake  and  over  2,500  families  are  left  with  members  with  permanent  disabilities.  Many\nfamilies of the 200,000 injured have also been left with members with physical disabilities that\nrequire a change in economic activity to more sedentary jobs. In the case of such households,\nthe issue is to build up a skill base to equip them to take up economic activities in the first place\nbefore providing financial and infrastructure support. Comprehensive training programs have to\nbe  carried  out  for  destitute  women  and  other  family  members  in  the  case  of  the  disabled.  A\nrestoration  program  will  require  (i)  training  of  young  women  and  other  family  members  to\nreplace those who have died or been permanently disabled, (ii) alternate means of employment\nto  the  physically  handicapped  who  have  to  give  up  existing  lines  of  employment  but  can\nmanage  to  be  economically  active,  and  (iii)  provision  of  production  credit  to  cover  the  cost  of\nbasic materials and seed money for alternate work.\n\nEconomic Compensation for Loss of Livelihood. Many children have been orphaned\n5.\nand old people left without support as a result of the quake. In these categories the situation is\none  of  total  loss  of  family  economic  livelihood  with  no  scope  for  restoring  it.  This  class  of\ndependants needs to be economically provided for their basic needs by the state until some of\nthe children are old enough to receive vocational training.\n\nC.\n\nScope\n\nThis project component will cover livelihood restoration for categories (i) and (ii) in para.\n6. \n2. The trades to be covered will include artisans, craftsmen, handicraft workers, small traders,\nand skills suitable to the sociocultural and economic milieu of the specific areas for the destitute\nwomen  and  handicapped.  Many  dry  land  farmers,  salt  pan  workers,  and  those  engaged  in\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nanimal husbandry are also affected. The Government of Gujart (GOG) is already in touch with\nthe  national  Government  for  additional  support  through  centrally  sponsored  and  assisted\nschemes.  Nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs)  have  also  indicated  interest  in  providing\nsupport, particularly for salt pan workers. Large-scale reconstruction activity for housing is to be\ntaken up under the Project. Construction workers, including masons, carpenters, plumbers, and\nelectricians  will  be  gainfully  employed  in  the  process.  A  specific  component  for  tool-kit\ndistribution, construction of work places, and marketing support is being included. The Project\nwill  also  support  training  programs  and  restoration  of  livelihoods  for  destitute  women  and\ndisabled persons.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  cost  estimate  is  based  on  information  on  unit  cost  for  individual  components\n\n7.\nsuch as tool-kits and work place.

The  Department  of  Social  Justice  and\nEmpowerment  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  training  and  livelihood  restoration  for  the\ndisabled  persons  and  destitute  women.  These  two  main  agencies  have  been  identified  in\nconsultation with GOG.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nF.\n\n9.\n\nImplementation is expected to commence in April 2001 and be completed by end-2003.\n\n\f39\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nMULTIHAZARD DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION\n\nA.\n\n Rationale\n\nGujarat  is  prone  to  a  variety  of  natural  hazards,  including  cyclones,  drought,  and\n1.\nearthquake.  Due to its extensive industrialization, and being home to a significant percentage of\nIndia\u2019s  chemical  industry,  it  also  faces  industrial  and  chemical  hazards.  Therefore,  the  state\u2019s\nDisaster  Management  and  Mitigation  Program  (DMMP)  must  necessarily  be  multihazard-\nfocused  and  broad-based,  dealing  with  preparedness  (predisaster  activities  to  develop  and\nmaintain capabilities to respond rapidly and effectively to disasters) and mitigation (activities to\nreduce disaster risk and minimize impact of consequences), besides relief and recovery.\n\nThe current earthquake and the Government of Gujarat (GOG) response to it revealed\n2.\nweaknesses in communication systems; availability of trained human resources and equipment;\nprearranged  systems \nfor  mobilizing  response  resources;  government  and  community\nawareness  of  hazards;  response  actions  and  mitigation  measures;  and  mechanisms  for\nincorporating hazard resistance into structures, infrastructure, and planning.\n\nOn  6  February  2001,  GOG  established  the  Gujarat  State  Disaster  Management\n\n3.\nAuthority (GSDMA), with the following aims and objectives:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nprovide relief against natural calamities and restore normalcy through social and\nfinancial activities for rehabilitation and reconstruction;\n\nprepare  and  implement  programs  to  early  warning  to  natural  disasters  and\nminimize its impact;\n\n(iii) \n\nassess reasons behind natural disasters and recommend solutions; and\n\n(iv) \n\ncoordinate assistance from various resources and agencies including multilateral\nand  bilateral  agencies,  public  and  private  sector,  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs), and individuals, and ensure efficient and transparent use of funds.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe  main  objective  of  this  component  is  to  (i)  initially  build  GSDMA\u2019s  capacity  to\n4.\nundertake  the  immediate  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  efforts;  and  (ii)  develop  GSDMA\u2019s\ninstitutional  capacity  to  become  an  apex  organization  and  focal  point  for  multidisaster-related\nefforts and issues in the state, from prevention and mitigation, to relief and reconstruction.\n\n5.\n\nGSDMA will have two distinct but interrelated units to serve its dual functions:1\n\n(i) \n\nThe Earthquake Reconstruction Management Division (ERMD) will serve as the\nproject  management  unit  for  the  reconstruction  program.  ERMD  will  serve  as\nExecuting Agency for the loan projects from multilateral and bilateral agencies. In\nview  of  the  enormity  of  the  task,  ERMD  will  require  necessary  support  to  build\ncapacity to manage such a program.\n\n                                                \n1 An international consulting firm has been tasked to prepare the detailed organizational structure including staffing,\nas well as preparing the specifications for management information system and financial management system.\n\n\f6.\n\nThe scope of work includes\n\n(ii) \n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)\n\n(ix)\n\n40\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\nThe  Disaster  Management  Division  (DMD)  has  as  its  main  task  to  develop  and\nimplement  the  DMMP  for  all  hazards  faced  by  the  state.  While  in  the  initial\nperiod,  DMD  will  also  provide  technical  support  to  the  implementation  of  the\nreconstruction  program,  by  the  end  of  the  reconstruction  program,  the  core\ntechnical  departments  from  the  reconstruction  program  would  come  under  this\ndivision.\n\npreparation  of  a  multihazard  DMMP  (risk  analysis  comprising  hazards  and\nvulnerability  assessments;  inventory  of  response  resources;  standard  operating\nprocedures (SOPs) on early warning, alert, warning dissemination, and activation\nof response; and SOPs for response action including search and rescue, medical\naid,  relief  supply,  emergency  shelter,  health  and  sanitation,  infrastructure\nrestoration, and damage and needs assessment);\n\ndisaster  management  information  system  (detailed  district  assessment  of\nhazards, vulnerabilities, response resources, and capacities; and vulnerability of\nhousing and critical infrastructure);\n\ndisaster  management  training  (capacity  building  and  training  on  disaster\nmanagement, and developing capacity for delivering training);\n\ndrought  mitigation  program  (develop  and  implement  a  comprehensive  drought\nmitigation  program  that  includes  practical  methods  of  water  conservation,\nrainwater  harvesting,  appropriate  changes  in  cropping  patterns,  and  livestock\nprotection);\n\ndisaster  management  control  rooms  and  communications  network  (phased\nprogram to establish a district disaster control room in each district headquarters\nand a statewide communications network);\n\nenhancement of first responder capacity (program to upgrade search and rescue\ncapacities  in  urban  areas;  and  development  and  training  of  community-based\nfirst response teams);\n\n(training  of  disaster\ncommunity-based  disaster  management  program \npreparedness  volunteers \nin\nevacuation, rescue and first aid, and mitigation program geared to protecting and\nincorporating disaster resistance in community and family assets);\n\nthe  dissemination  of  warning,  assistance \n\nin \n\nurban disaster management program (development of a city-level mitigation and\npreparedness  program,  building  on  capacity  in  the  local  bodies  through\nestablishment of a disaster management cell and citywide disaster management\ncommittee); and\n\ncyclone  preparedness  program \nimprovement,  warning\ndissemination, and community volunteer-based evacuation system by identifying\nbuildings that could serve as cyclone shelters and a system of community-based\nvolunteers to disseminate warnings and facilitate evacuation).\n\n(warning  system \n\n\f41\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimate\n\nThe total cost of this component is estimated at $20 million.
