It will support the \nrehabilitation  and  construction  of  urban  infrastructure  including  roads,  bridges,  a  water  supply \nplant,  water  supply  networks,  sewerage  and  stormwater  networks;  the  strengthening  of  urban \nmanagement capacity in project cities; and wetland protection and management in Zhangye.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe economic development of the western region of the PRC lags because of the harsh \n3. \nclimate, underdeveloped transport and urban infrastructure, and lack of investment. Located in \nthe northwestern part of the PRC, Gansu is one of the poorest provinces, with a provincial gross \ndomestic  product  per  capita  ranked  second-to-last  among  all the  PRC  provinces,  autonomous \nregions, and municipalities. The urban poverty rate of 9.5% and the rural poverty rate of 20.6% \nmake  the  province  a  priority  area  for  development  investment.  Low  per  capita  gross  domestic \nproducts rank the cities of Dingxi and Zhangye 12th and 8th, respectively, among the 14 cities \nof  Gansu.  Dingxi\u2019s  urban  poverty  rate  of  15.4%  and  Zhangye\u2019s  rate  of  15.1%  are  almost  two-\nthirds more severe than the provincial average. The government launched the National Strategy \nfor  Development  of  the  West  to  stimulate  economic  development  and  raise  living  standards.3 \nThe main pillars of the strategy are investing in urban infrastructure, protecting the environment, \nand attracting private investment in the region\u2019s economy. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas actively supported the strategy by providing technical assistance and financial resources to \nimprove  urban  infrastructure  for  transportation,  communication,  power,  and  water  resources; \nimprove  the  environment;  and  support  inclusive  economic  growth.  The  proposed  project  will \ncomplement  other  ADB-financed  projects  that  aim  to  improve  urban  infrastructure  and \nenvironment in the region.  \n \n4. \nDingxi  has  a  population  of  2.7  million  and  is  located  100  kilometers  (km)  southeast  of \nLanzhou,  the  capital  of  Gansu  Province.  An  unfavorable  climate  that  causes  scarce  water \nresources,  frequent  droughts,  and  short  vegetation  and  construction  periods  combines  with \nundeveloped  transport,  urban  infrastructure,  and  industry  to  hinder  the  city\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment. Its 2011 per capita disposable income of CNY10,790 was well below the national \naverage  of  CNY19,909  and  the  provincial  average  of  CNY13,118.  To  stimulate  economic \ngrowth  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  city,  the  government  has  developed  a  city  development \nstrategy that positions Dingxi as a transportation hub, includes the construction of a railway line \nand highways, and emphasizes the development of industrial zones and urban infrastructure.  \n \nZhangye has a population of 1.2 million and is located in the middle of Gansu Province \n5. \non the historic Silk Road. In 2011, the per capita disposable income of the urban population was \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank provided project preparatory technical assistance.

The city has recently experienced \nrapid  population  growth  and  faces  a  growing  challenge  to  balance  urban  development  and \nenvironmental protection. Water resources are declining because of their unsustainable use for \nagriculture and the rising population and industrial production, which degrades natural wetlands \nin the municipality. Promoting wetland protection and sustainable management, in combination \nwith  environmentally  friendly  urban  infrastructure  development,  are  priority  goals  for  the  city. \nThe city\u2019s rich historical and cultural background provides enormous potential for tourism. As the \ncity master plan positions Zhangye as an environmentally friendly and livable city, the municipal \ngovernment  has  started  phasing  out  polluting  industries,  expanding  the  capacity  of  the  city \nwastewater  treatment  plant,  relocating  an  industrial  zone  away  from  the  wetlands,  and \npromoting  ecotourism.  Both  project  cities  face  urban  development  challenges  including \ninadequate  urban  infrastructure,  the  low  quality  of  municipal  services,  and  the  lack  of \ninstitutional capacity.4 They require further assistance to stimulate economic growth.  \n \n6. \nStrategic  fit.  The project supports environmentally sustainable and inclusive economic \ngrowth,  which  is  a  key  priority  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020.5 It  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015, which supports the government's strategic goal of building an \neconomically  developed  society  by  helping \ninclusive  growth  and  promoting \nenvironmental  sustainability. 6  It  is  consistent  with  the  ADB  Urban  Operational  Plan,  which \nfosters  competitive,  green,  and  inclusive  cities.7 The  project  supports  Millennium  Development \nGoal 7 by reducing biodiversity and habitat loss, providing sustainable access to safe drinking \nwater and wastewater collection and treatment services, and improving the urban environment \nand  transport  services.  It  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative  for  urban  road \ncomponents  and  related \ntraffic \ninstitutional  capacity  development \nmanagement,  and  urban  transport  management  and  safety.8 The  project  supports  the  PRC\u2019s \nTwelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  and  2020  City  Master  Plans  for  project  cities,  which \nprioritize  economic  development,  environmental  protection,  and  ecologically \nfriendly \nurbanization. \n \n7. \nSector experience. This is the third ADB-financed urban development project in Gansu \nProvince.  Project  design  reflects  lessons from  previous  ADB-financed urban  development  and \nwetland  protection  projects  in  the  PRC.  Urban  development  interventions  require  thoroughly \nplanned  urban  development  strategies  and  approaches  accompanied  by  capacity  building  to \nstrengthen sustainable and ecofriendly urban planning and management. Recent ADB reviews \non  reviving  and  protecting  wetlands  suggest  that  wetland  protection  and  management  in  the \nPRC  require  intensive  policy  dialogue;  sustainable  financing  from  government  budgets;  and \ninstitutional  capacity  building  in  wetland  protection,  restoration,  management,  monitoring,  and \npublic education.9 \n \n8. \n \n\nDemonstration features. The project has the following demonstration features:  \n\nin  public \n\ntransport, \n\nfoster \n\nto \n\n(i)   Wetland  protection,  restoration,  and  management.  Natural  wetlands  in \nZhangye  have  been  declining  rapidly  because  of  uncontrolled  urbanization, \nirrational land use for cultivation, and pollution. The project will contribute to the \n\n                                                \n4   Sector Assessment: Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n5   ADB.  2008.

The  project  will  promote  urban  transport \nmanagement  oriented  to  accommodate  pedestrian  and  bicycle  traffic,  public \ntransport  services  with  bay  bus  stops,  improved  urban  traffic  control  and \nmanagement,  and  pedestrian  and  traffic  safety.  It  will  include  a  program  to \nimprove  urban  road  safety  that  encompasses  an  urban  road  safety  audit  to \nidentify road safety issues and recommend how to improve urban road safety in \nthe project cities. Road safety improvement will be part of urban road engineering \ndesign, a public awareness program, and a program to improve the enforcement \nof traffic safety laws and regulations.  \n \nStormwater management and wetland protection. New urban development is \nencroaching on the upper reaches of the ZNWP, into which urban surface runoff \nand  groundwater  will  be  discharged.  The  project  will  help  the  municipality \nestablish  a  system  to  control  stormwater  pollution,  including  surface  runoff \ntreatment prior to discharge into wetlands. \n\n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe impact will be socioeconomic development and improved environment in Dingxi and \nZhangye.  The  outcome  will  be  the  improved  urban  infrastructure,  municipal  services,  and \nenvironment in Dingxi and Zhangye cities. The proposed components will provide much-needed \nassistance in environmental protection and local social and economic development. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project has four outputs:  \n\n10. \n \n\n(i) \n\nImproved  urban  infrastructure  operating  in  Dingxi.  This  component  will \nupgrade  1  road  and  construct  6  roads  with  a  total  length  of  13.6  km  and  their \nassociated facilities, including 5 bridges and 30 culverts, 22.3 km of storm water \npipeline,  11.3  km  of  sewer  pipeline,  street  lighting,  landscaping,  and  traffic \nmanagement facilities. All roads will have on both sides, sidewalks and lanes for \nnon-motorized traffic. \n \nImproved  urban  infrastructure  operating  in  Zhangye.  This  component \nincludes the construction of 21 urban roads with a total length of 39.7 km, a new \nwater  supply  plant,  49.2  km  of  piping  network,  and  49.6  km  of  sanitary  piping \nnetwork connected to the existing wastewater treatment plant.  \n \nRestored  and  protected  wetland  in  Zhangye.  This  component  covers  the \nZNWP and other wetlands adjacent to the city and has three subcomponents: (a) \nwetland  protection  with  the  construction  of  four  protection  stations;  a  center \ncombining  police,  patrol, \nfacilities; \nwatchtowers; park boundary demarcation; associated equipment for all services; \nand  a  comprehensive  education  and  capacity-building  program;  (b)  wetland \nrestoration,  comprising  the  restoration  of  1,400  hectares  (ha)  of  wetland  and \n\nresearch,  monitoring,  and  education \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n(iv) \n\nwoodland  habitats  in  the  park  and  the  planting  of  native  and  naturalized  plant \nspecies; and (c) sustainable wetland utilization, comprising activities designed to \npromote sustainable ecotourism and public education in the park.  \n \nProject management and capacity development.

The  terms \nof reference for consulting services are in the PAM (footnote 10).  \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n16. \nThe project will benefit 941,000 people in Dingxi and Zhangye, of whom 15.6% are poor, \nby improving living conditions and the quality of municipal services and urban transport systems, \nwith the emphasis on pedestrian and other non-motorized modes of transport, and by facilitating \nmore environmentally and ecologically friendly urban development.  \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n17. \nThe  project\u2019s  urban  infrastructure  components  will  construct  and  upgrade  urban  roads \nand bridges; a water supply plant; stormwater, drainage, and sanitary sewerage networks; and \nstreet lighting, providing landscaping and urban open spaces.  Detailed engineering design will \nalign with up-to-date urban design standards and specifications and international best practices. \nFor  the  urban  road  subcomponents,  a  people-centric  design  concept  has  been  incorporated \nwith special emphasis on planning and facilities for safe pedestrian and bicycle traffic and public \ntransport. Sanitary piping networks will significantly increase sewer coverage in the project cities \nand improve the urban living environment. The wetland protection component will help balance \nurban  development  and  environmental  protection  in  Zhangye  by  restoring  and  protecting \nwetland  habitats  and  supporting  the  development  of  ecotourism.  A  detailed  description  of \ncomponents is in the PAM (footnote 10). \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nthat \n\nEconomic  analysis  evaluated \n\ntechnical  options  and  confirmed \n\n18. \nthe  project \ncomponents  are  designed  using  the  least-cost  options  to  support  the  cities\u2019  long-term  urban \ndevelopment  plans.  The  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  15.7%.  The  subproject \neconomic internal rate of return is computed at 15.5% for Dingxi urban infrastructure, 15.7% for \nZhangye urban infrastructure, 16.3% for Zhangye water supply, and 15.8% for Zhangye wetland \nprotection\u2014all of which exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. The results \nare  robust  under  the  normal  range  of  sensitivity  analyses.  Economic  costs  include  (i)  capital \ncosts, including land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental mitigation and monitoring; (ii) \nproject  management  and  institutional  strengthening;  (iii)  physical  contingencies;  and  (iv) \ninfrastructure \noperation  and  maintenance.  Economic  benefits \ncomponents  include  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  (ii)  time  savings,  (iii)  accident  cost \nreductions, and (iv) emission reductions. Economic benefits identified for the wetland protection \ncomponent include (i) arrested wetland area shrinkage and deterioration, (ii) reduced pollution, \n(iii)  irrigation  water  savings  on  farmland  adjacent  to  wetlands,  and  (iv)  reduced  flood  risk. \nBenefits that cannot be readily quantified, such as improved health and increased employment, \nwere not included.12 \n \nFinancial cost\u2013benefit analysis of the revenue-generating water supply plant and piping \n19. \nnetwork  confirmed  the  financial  viability  of  these  subcomponents.  The  financial  cost\u2013benefit \nanalysis, undertaken on an incremental basis, concluded that the financial internal rate of return, \ncalculated at 9.3% discount rate, exceeds after tax the 2.6% weighted average cost of capital by \nan adequate margin to establish the financial viability of the component. As sensitivity and risk \nanalyses reveal that the financial internal rate of return is most sensitive to variation in revenue, \ntimely tariff adjustments or government subsidies will be crucial to ensuring the financial viability \nand  sustainability  of  the  subcomponents.  Currently,  water  tariff  subsidies  are  provided  to \n\nthe  urban \n\nidentified \n\nfor \n\n                                                \n12  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nrecipients of the minimum living standard guarantee, which will be maintained in the future. The \nPRC processes for public participation will be followed for any tariff adjustments.  \n\n \n20. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  conducted  for  the  implementing  agencies \nindicates  that  they  have  sufficient  financial  management  capacity  and  project  management \nexperience  but  lack  knowledge  of  ADB  disbursement  guidelines.  The  capacity  development \ncomponent  will  therefore  provide  on-the-job  training  on  ADB  policy  and  procedures  during \nproject implementation.13  \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the DMG, ZMG, Ganzhou District government, PMOs, and project implementing agencies. \nSpecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the  PAM (footnote \n10). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n22. \nA poverty and social assessment during project preparation included a household survey, \ncommunity and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews.14 As Gansu is one of the \nPRC\u2019s  poorest  and  least-developed  western  provinces,  it  has  been  prioritized  in  national \ndevelopment  plans.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  over  941,000  urban  residents  in  the  two \ncities,  of  whom  15.6%  are  poor,  by  improving  living  conditions,  municipal  services,  the  urban \nenvironment,  and  wetland  ecology.  The  project  will  create  an  estimated  3,649  full-time  jobs \nduring  construction  and  535  during  operation.  Employment  targets  for  vulnerable  groups  and \nwomen are included in the design and monitoring framework and loan assurances. Public health \nand  safety  will  benefit  from  improvements  to  the  urban  environment;  improved  traffic \nmanagement  with  the  development  of  the  urban  road  network,  including  universal  design \nprinciples,  and improvements  in  public transport  and  non-motorized  transport  and road safety; \nand wetland protection. A social development action plan has been prepared for implementing \nagencies to follow during project implementation. \n \nE. \n\nGender  \n\n23. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action  plan  has \nbeen  prepared.  Data  from  survey  and  focus  group  discussions  reveal  that  women  are \ndisproportionately  affected  by  poor  mobility  and  limited  access  to  tap  water  because  of  their \nfamily and household responsibilities and employment in low-paying jobs. Improvements to the \nurban transport  network  and  attention  to  the  needs  of  women  when  planning  public  transport, \naccess to pedestrian and non-motorized transport; and road safety programs will benefit women \nby reducing time and cost burdens and increasing access, mobility, and safety. Improvements \nto  wetlands,  attention  to  tourism  development,  awareness  building,  and  resulting  job \nopportunities will benefit women. The gender action plan includes specific targets for women in \nemployment and participation in capacity-building opportunities, which are supported by a loan \nassurance and consultant support for implementation and monitoring.15 \n \n\n                                                \n13  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n14  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n\fF. \n\nSafeguards  \n\n24. \nEnvironment. The project is environment category A, primarily because of the Zhangye \nwetland  protection  component,  which  will  support  rehabilitation  and  protection  activities  in  the \nthe  Zhangye  Hei  River  Wetland  National  Nature  Reserve.  An \nexperimental  zone  of \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  was  prepared,  circulated  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  and \nposted  on  the  ADB  website  on  2  March  2012.  It  complies  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). The project will have substantial environmental and socioeconomic benefits, \nrestoring and protecting 1,400 ha of wetland habitat. Potential negative environmental impacts \nassociated  with  the  project  have  been  identified,  and  adequate  mitigation  and  monitoring \narrangements  have  been  incorporated  in  the  environmental  management  plan.  Potential \nadverse  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  include  soil  erosion  from  earthworks, \nrecommended  alteration  of  a  legally  protected  area,  traffic  noise  in  some  sensitive  areas, \npotential  impact  of  the  water  supply  component,  significant  spoil  disposal,  community \noccupational  health  and  safety  risks  during  construction,  and  limited  standard  construction \nimpacts.  These  impacts  will  be  prevented  or  minimized  to  an  acceptable  degree  if  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  is  effectively  implemented.  The  environmental  management \nplan  is  supported  by  loan covenants  and  capacity  development  and institutional  strengthening \nunder the project. A system to manage water quality and wetlands will be developed to monitor \nthe  ecological  status  of  wetlands.  As  the  executing  agency,  the  Gansu  provincial  finance \ndepartment disclosed relevant environment information to affected people, and the results and \nfindings of consultation were used to modify the environmental impact assessment and project \ndesign.  Consultation  and  public  participation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation, \nand  any  environmental  complaints  or  disputes  will  be  handled  by  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism established for the project. \n\n \n25. \nResettlement.  The  project  is  resettlement  category  A,  as  construction  will  require \nsignificant land acquisition and resettlement. The project will affect 62 village groups, 16 villages, \n2  towns,  and  2  districts  in  the  project  cities.  A  total  of  245.7  ha  of  land  will  be  acquired \npermanently and 8 ha occupied temporarily during implementation, affecting 3,327 households \nwith 12,264 members whose land will be acquired. Houses and other buildings totaling 215,829 \nsquare  meters  of  floor  space  will  be  demolished,  which  will  affect  698  households  with  2,527 \nmembers  and  51  enterprises  or  institutions.  Resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the \nDingxi  and  Zhangye  urban  infrastructure  components,  and  a  due  diligence  report  has  been \nprepared for the wetland protection component in Zhangye. Resettlement plans will be finalized \nbased on the final design and detailed measurement survey, disclosed to affected people in the \nlocal language, and submitted to ADB for review and approval before civil works contracts are \nawarded. A grievance redress mechanism has been established for affected people. The PMOs \nwill  (i)  submit  internal  monitoring  reports  semiannually  to  ADB  and  (ii)  engage  an  external \nmonitor  to  conduct  baseline  studies  of  affected  people,  verify  the  progress  of  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement,  assess  its  impacts,  and  submit  semiannual  monitoring  reports  for  ADB\u2019s \nreview  during  resettlement  implementation  and  annually  for  2  years  after  the  completion  of \nresettlement. \n \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  Ethnic  minorities \n26. \nliving in the project cities are well integrated economically and socially into the broader society. \nThey  will  benefit  equally  from  the  project.  No  adverse  impacts  particular  to  ethnic  minorities \nwere identified.  \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nG. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and detailed in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.16 The integrated benefits and impacts of the project are \nexpected to outweigh the costs and risks. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDifficulty in complying with Asian \nDevelopment Bank procedures \n\nDelays in project coordination  \namong agencies \n\nDelays in land acquisition \napprovals and implementation \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nEarly mobilization of procurement agents and implementation \nconsultants to provide technical support combined with ongoing \ntraining \nCoordination support from the project implementation consultants, \nclose project monitoring, frequent site inspections, and regular \ncoordination meetings.
