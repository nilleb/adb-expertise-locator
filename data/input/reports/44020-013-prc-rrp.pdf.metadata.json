THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Urban Infrastructure Development and \nWetland Protection Project.1 \n \n2.  The project aims to promote socioeconomic development and improve the environment \nin Dingxi and Zhangye, two second-tier cities in Gansu Province of the PRC. It will support the \nrehabilitation and construction of urban infrastructure including roads, bridges, a water supply \nplant, water supply networks, sewerage and stormwater networks; the strengthening of urban \nmanagement capacity in project cities; and wetland protection and management in Zhangye.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The economic development of the western region of the PRC lags because of the harsh \nclimate, underdeveloped transport and urban infrastructure, and lack of investment. Located in \nthe northwestern part of the PRC, Gansu is one of the poorest provinces, with a provincial gross \ndomestic product per capita ranked second-to-last among all the PRC provinces, autonomous \nregions, and municipalities. The urban poverty rate of 9.5% and the rural poverty rate of 20.6% \nmake the province a priority area for development investment. Low per capita gross domestic \nproducts rank the cities of Dingxi and Zhangye 12th and 8th, respectively, among the 14 cities \nof Gansu. Dingxi\u2019s urban poverty rate of 15.4% and Zhangye\u2019s rate of 15.1% are almost two-\nthirds more severe than the provincial average. The government launched the National Strategy \nfor Development of the West to stimulate economic development and raise living standards.3 \nThe main pillars of the strategy are investing in urban infrastructure, protecting the environment, \nand attracting private investment in the region\u2019s economy. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas actively supported the strategy by providing technical assistance and financial resources to \nimprove urban infrastructure for transportation, communication, power, and water resources; \nimprove the environment; and support inclusive economic growth. The proposed project will \ncomplement  other  ADB-financed  projects  that  aim  to  improve  urban  infrastructure  and \nenvironment in the region.  \n \n4.  Dingxi has a population of 2.7 million and is located 100 kilometers (km) southeast of \nLanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province. An unfavorable climate that causes scarce water \nresources, frequent droughts, and short vegetation and construction periods combines with \nundeveloped  transport,  urban  infrastructure,  and  industry  to  hinder  the  city\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment. Its 2011 per capita disposable income of CNY10,790 was well below the national \naverage  of  CNY19,909  and  the  provincial  average  of  CNY13,118.  To  stimulate  economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty in the city, the government has developed a city development \nstrategy that positions Dingxi as a transportation hub, includes the construction of a railway line \nand highways, and emphasizes the development of industrial zones and urban infrastructure.  \n \n5.  Zhangye has a population of 1.2 million and is located in the middle of Gansu Province \non the historic Silk Road. In 2011, the per capita disposable income of the urban population was \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank provided project preparatory technical assistance.

The city has recently experienced \nrapid population growth and faces a growing challenge to balance urban development and \nenvironmental protection. Water resources are declining because of their unsustainable use for \nagriculture and the rising population and industrial production, which degrades natural wetlands \nin the municipality. Promoting wetland protection and sustainable management, in combination \nwith environmentally friendly urban infrastructure development, are priority goals for the city. \nThe city\u2019s rich historical and cultural background provides enormous potential for tourism. As the \ncity master plan positions Zhangye as an environmentally friendly and livable city, the municipal \ngovernment has started phasing out polluting industries, expanding the capacity of the city \nwastewater  treatment  plant,  relocating  an  industrial  zone  away  from  the  wetlands,  and \npromoting  ecotourism.  Both  project  cities  face  urban  development  challenges  including \ninadequate  urban  infrastructure,  the  low  quality  of  municipal  services,  and  the  lack  of \ninstitutional capacity.4 They require further assistance to stimulate economic growth.  \n \n6.  Strategic fit. The project supports environmentally sustainable and inclusive economic \ngrowth, which is a key priority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.5 It aligns with ADB\u2019s PRC country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015, which supports the government's strategic goal of building an \neconomically  developed  society  by  helping  to  foster  inclusive  growth  and  promoting \nenvironmental  sustainability.6 It  is  consistent  with  the  ADB  Urban  Operational  Plan,  which \nfosters competitive, green, and inclusive cities.7 The project supports Millennium Development \nGoal 7 by reducing biodiversity and habitat loss, providing sustainable access to safe drinking \nwater and wastewater collection and treatment services, and improving the urban environment \nand transport services. It aligns with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative for urban road \ncomponents  and  related  institutional  capacity  development  in  public  transport,  traffic \nmanagement, and urban transport management and safety.8 The project supports the PRC\u2019s \nTwelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  and  2020  City  Master  Plans  for  project  cities,  which \nprioritize  economic  development,  environmental  protection,  and  ecologically  friendly \nurbanization. \n \n7.  Sector experience. This is the third ADB-financed urban development project in Gansu \nProvince. Project design reflects lessons from previous ADB-financed urban development and \nwetland protection projects in the PRC. Urban development interventions require thoroughly \nplanned urban development strategies and approaches accompanied by capacity building to \nstrengthen sustainable and ecofriendly urban planning and management. Recent ADB reviews \non reviving and protecting wetlands suggest that wetland protection and management in the \nPRC require intensive policy dialogue; sustainable financing from government budgets; and \ninstitutional capacity building in wetland protection, restoration, management, monitoring, and \npublic education.9 \n \n8.  Demonstration features. The project has the following demonstration features:  \n \n(i)   Wetland  protection,  restoration,  and  management.  Natural  wetlands  in \nZhangye  have  been  declining  rapidly  because  of  uncontrolled  urbanization, \nirrational land use for cultivation, and pollution. The project will contribute to the \n                                                \n4  Sector Assessment: Multisector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n5  ADB. 2008.

The project will promote urban transport \nmanagement  oriented  to  accommodate  pedestrian  and  bicycle  traffic,  public \ntransport  services  with  bay  bus  stops,  improved  urban  traffic  control  and \nmanagement,  and  pedestrian  and  traffic  safety.  It  will  include  a  program  to \nimprove  urban  road  safety  that  encompasses an  urban  road  safety  audit  to \nidentify road safety issues and recommend how to improve urban road safety in \nthe project cities. Road safety improvement will be part of urban road engineering \ndesign, a public awareness program, and a program to improve the enforcement \nof traffic safety laws and regulations.  \n \n(iii)  Stormwater management and wetland protection. New urban development is \nencroaching on the upper reaches of the ZNWP, into which urban surface runoff \nand  groundwater  will  be  discharged.  The  project  will  help  the  municipality \nestablish  a  system  to  control  stormwater  pollution,  including  surface  runoff \ntreatment prior to discharge into wetlands. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be socioeconomic development and improved environment in Dingxi and \nZhangye.  The  outcome  will  be  the  improved  urban  infrastructure,  municipal  services,  and \nenvironment in Dingxi and Zhangye cities. The proposed components will provide much-needed \nassistance in environmental protection and local social and economic development. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project has four outputs:  \n \n(i)  Improved  urban  infrastructure  operating  in  Dingxi.  This  component  will \nupgrade 1 road and construct 6 roads with a total length of 13.6 km and their \nassociated facilities, including 5 bridges and 30 culverts, 22.3 km of storm water \npipeline,  11.3  km  of  sewer  pipeline,  street  lighting,  landscaping,  and  traffic \nmanagement facilities. All roads will have on both sides, sidewalks and lanes for \nnon-motorized traffic. \n \n(ii)  Improved  urban  infrastructure  operating  in  Zhangye.  This  component \nincludes the construction of 21 urban roads with a total length of 39.7 km, a new \nwater supply plant, 49.2 km of piping network, and 49.6 km of sanitary piping \nnetwork connected to the existing wastewater treatment plant.  \n \n(iii)  Restored  and  protected  wetland  in  Zhangye.  This component  covers the \nZNWP and other wetlands adjacent to the city and has three subcomponents: (a) \nwetland  protection  with  the  construction  of  four  protection  stations;  a  center \ncombining  police,  patrol,  research,  monitoring,  and  education  facilities; \nwatchtowers; park boundary demarcation; associated equipment for all services; \nand  a  comprehensive  education  and  capacity-building  program;  (b)  wetland \nrestoration, comprising the restoration of 1,400 hectares (ha) of wetland and \n ", "4 \nwoodland habitats in the park and the planting of native and naturalized plant \nspecies; and (c) sustainable wetland utilization, comprising activities designed to \npromote sustainable ecotourism and public education in the park.  \n \n(iv)  Project management and capacity development. This component will help the \nproject cities develop and implement advanced project management systems \nand enhance capacity in urban planning and management. It will include capacity \nbuilding  and  training  in  urban  planning  and  management,  environmental \nmanagement, public transport and non-motorized traffic planning and safety, and \nstorm water pollution control. A comprehensive capacity-building and training \nprogram  will  educate  the  public  on  wetland  protection  and  restoration  and \nenhance  the  wetland  management  and  monitoring  capacity  of  the  wetland \nmanagement agency in Zhangye.  \n \nD.

The project will benefit 941,000 people in Dingxi and Zhangye, of whom 15.6% are poor, \nby improving living conditions and the quality of municipal services and urban transport systems, \nwith the emphasis on pedestrian and other non-motorized modes of transport, and by facilitating \nmore environmentally and ecologically friendly urban development.  \n \nA.  Technical \n17.  The project\u2019s urban infrastructure components will construct and upgrade urban roads \nand bridges; a water supply plant; stormwater, drainage, and sanitary sewerage networks; and \nstreet lighting, providing landscaping and urban open spaces. Detailed engineering design will \nalign with up-to-date urban design standards and specifications and international best practices. \nFor the urban road subcomponents, a people-centric design concept has been incorporated \nwith special emphasis on planning and facilities for safe pedestrian and bicycle traffic and public \ntransport. Sanitary piping networks will significantly increase sewer coverage in the project cities \nand improve the urban living environment. The wetland protection component will help balance \nurban  development  and  environmental  protection  in  Zhangye  by  restoring  and  protecting \nwetland  habitats  and  supporting  the  development  of  ecotourism.  A  detailed  description  of \ncomponents is in the PAM (footnote 10). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  Economic  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that  the  project \ncomponents are designed using the least-cost options to support the cities\u2019 long-term urban \ndevelopment plans.

The subproject \neconomic internal rate of return is computed at 15.5% for Dingxi urban infrastructure, 15.7% for \nZhangye urban infrastructure, 16.3% for Zhangye water supply, and 15.8% for Zhangye wetland \nprotection\u2014all of which exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. The results \nare robust under the normal range of sensitivity analyses. Economic costs include (i) capital \ncosts, including land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental mitigation and monitoring; (ii) \nproject  management  and  institutional  strengthening;  (iii)  physical  contingencies;  and  (iv) \noperation  and  maintenance.  Economic  benefits  identified  for  the  urban  infrastructure \ncomponents include (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) time savings, (iii) accident cost \nreductions, and (iv) emission reductions. Economic benefits identified for the wetland protection \ncomponent include (i) arrested wetland area shrinkage and deterioration, (ii) reduced pollution, \n(iii) irrigation water savings on farmland adjacent to wetlands, and (iv) reduced flood risk. \nBenefits that cannot be readily quantified, such as improved health and increased employment, \nwere not included.12 \n \n19.  Financial cost\u2013benefit analysis of the revenue-generating water supply plant and piping \nnetwork confirmed the financial viability of these subcomponents. The financial cost\u2013benefit \nanalysis, undertaken on an incremental basis, concluded that the financial internal rate of return, \ncalculated at 9.3% discount rate, exceeds after tax the 2.6% weighted average cost of capital by \nan adequate margin to establish the financial viability of the component. As sensitivity and risk \nanalyses reveal that the financial internal rate of return is most sensitive to variation in revenue, \ntimely tariff adjustments or government subsidies will be crucial to ensuring the financial viability \nand  sustainability  of  the  subcomponents.  Currently,  water  tariff  subsidies  are  provided  to \n                                                \n12  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "8 \nrecipients of the minimum living standard guarantee, which will be maintained in the future. The \nPRC processes for public participation will be followed for any tariff adjustments.  \n \n20.  The  financial  management  assessment  conducted  for  the  implementing  agencies \nindicates that they have sufficient financial management capacity and project management \nexperience but lack knowledge of ADB disbursement guidelines. The capacity development \ncomponent will therefore provide on-the-job training on ADB policy and procedures  during \nproject implementation.13  \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the DMG, ZMG, Ganzhou District government, PMOs, and project implementing agencies. \nSpecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote \n10). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  A poverty and social assessment during project preparation included a household survey, \ncommunity and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews.14 As Gansu is one of the \nPRC\u2019s  poorest  and  least-developed  western  provinces,  it  has  been  prioritized  in  national \ndevelopment plans. The project will directly benefit over 941,000 urban residents in the two \ncities, of whom 15.6% are poor, by improving living conditions, municipal services, the urban \nenvironment, and wetland ecology. The project will create an estimated 3,649 full-time jobs \nduring construction and 535 during operation. Employment targets for vulnerable groups and \nwomen are included in the design and monitoring framework and loan assurances. Public health \nand  safety  will  benefit  from  improvements  to  the  urban  environment;  improved  traffic \nmanagement  with  the  development  of  the  urban  road  network,  including  universal  design \nprinciples, and improvements in public transport and non-motorized transport and road safety; \nand wetland protection. A social development action plan has been prepared for implementing \nagencies to follow during project implementation. \n \nE.  Gender  \n23.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen  prepared.  Data  from  survey  and  focus  group  discussions  reveal  that  women  are \ndisproportionately affected by poor mobility and limited access to tap water because of their \nfamily and household responsibilities and employment in low-paying jobs. Improvements to the \nurban transport network and attention to the needs of women when planning public transport, \naccess to pedestrian and non-motorized transport; and road safety programs will benefit women \nby reducing time and cost burdens and increasing access, mobility, and safety. Improvements \nto  wetlands,  attention  to  tourism  development,  awareness  building,  and  resulting  job \nopportunities will benefit women. The gender action plan includes specific targets for women in \nemployment and participation in capacity-building opportunities, which are supported by a loan \nassurance and consultant support for implementation and monitoring.15 \n \n                                                \n13  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n14  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "9 \nF.  Safeguards  \n24.  Environment. The project is environment category A, primarily because of the Zhangye \nwetland protection component, which will support rehabilitation and protection activities in the \nexperimental  zone  of  the  Zhangye  Hei  River  Wetland  National  Nature  Reserve.  An \nenvironmental impact assessment was prepared, circulated to the Board of Directors, and \nposted  on  the  ADB  website  on  2  March  2012.  It  complies  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). The project will have substantial environmental and socioeconomic benefits, \nrestoring and protecting 1,400 ha of wetland habitat. Potential negative environmental impacts \nassociated  with  the  project  have  been  identified,  and  adequate  mitigation  and  monitoring \narrangements  have  been  incorporated  in  the  environmental  management  plan.  Potential \nadverse  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  include  soil  erosion  from  earthworks, \nrecommended  alteration  of  a  legally  protected area, traffic  noise  in  some  sensitive  areas, \npotential  impact  of  the  water  supply  component,  significant  spoil  disposal,  community \noccupational  health  and  safety  risks  during  construction,  and  limited standard  construction \nimpacts.  These  impacts  will  be  prevented  or  minimized  to  an  acceptable  degree  if  the \nenvironmental management plan is effectively implemented. The environmental management \nplan is supported by loan covenants and capacity development and institutional strengthening \nunder the project. A system to manage water quality and wetlands will be developed to monitor \nthe  ecological  status  of  wetlands.  As  the  executing  agency,  the  Gansu  provincial  finance \ndepartment disclosed relevant environment information to affected people, and the results and \nfindings of consultation were used to modify the environmental impact assessment and project \ndesign. Consultation and public participation will continue throughout project implementation, \nand  any  environmental  complaints  or  disputes  will  be  handled  by  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism established for the project. \n \n25.  Resettlement.  The  project  is  resettlement  category  A,  as  construction  will  require \nsignificant land acquisition and resettlement. The project will affect 62 village groups, 16 villages, \n2 towns, and 2 districts in the project cities. A total of 245.7  ha of land will be acquired \npermanently and 8 ha occupied temporarily during implementation, affecting 3,327 households \nwith 12,264 members whose land will be acquired. Houses and other buildings totaling 215,829 \nsquare meters of floor space will be demolished, which will affect 698 households with 2,527 \nmembers and 51 enterprises or institutions. Resettlement plans have been prepared for the \nDingxi and Zhangye urban infrastructure components, and a due diligence report has been \nprepared for the wetland protection component in Zhangye. Resettlement plans will be finalized \nbased on the final design and detailed measurement survey, disclosed to affected people in the \nlocal language, and submitted to ADB for review and approval before civil works contracts are \nawarded. A grievance redress mechanism has been established for affected people. The PMOs \nwill (i) submit internal monitoring reports semiannually to ADB and (ii) engage an external \nmonitor to conduct baseline studies of affected people, verify the progress of land acquisition \nand resettlement, assess its impacts, and submit semiannual monitoring reports for ADB\u2019s \nreview during resettlement implementation and annually for 2 years after the completion of \nresettlement. \n \n26.  Indigenous peoples. The project is indigenous peoples category C. Ethnic minorities \nliving in the project cities are well integrated economically and socially into the broader society. \nThey will benefit equally from the project. No adverse impacts particular to ethnic minorities \nwere identified.  \n \n ", "10 \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and detailed in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.16 The integrated benefits and impacts of the project are \nexpected to outweigh the costs and risks. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDifficulty in complying with Asian  Early mobilization of procurement agents and implementation \nDevelopment Bank procedures  consultants to provide technical support combined with ongoing \ntraining \nDelays in project coordination   Coordination support from the project implementation consultants, \namong agencies  close project monitoring, frequent site inspections, and regular \ncoordination meetings.
