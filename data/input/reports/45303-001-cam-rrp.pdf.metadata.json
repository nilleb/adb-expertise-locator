The project addresses both power and non-power energy supply \nin  rural  Cambodia  through  (i)  electrifying  up  to  8,000  households  in  Svay  Rieng  province  by \nextending  the  22  kilovolt  (kV)  medium-voltage  sub-transmission  line  and  the  low-voltage \ndistribution  network,  and  installing  meters; 2\n (ii) promoting  the  use  of  up  to  90,000  improved \ncookstoves with higher efficiency in rural areas of Kampong Cham province; and (iii) developing \nthe  capacity  of  the  Electricity  Authority  of  Cambodia  (EAC),  which  is  the  regulatory  body \noverseeing the power sector.  \n \nThe project was initially conceived to be implemented by the World Bank. However, as \n3. \nthe  World  Bank  suspended  new  lending  to  Cambodia  in  August  2011,  the  governments  of \nAustralia  and  Cambodia  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  with  a  proven  track \nrecord  in  Cambodia\u2019s  energy  sector,  to  implement  the  project,  which  will  help  increase  the \nelectrification ratio and contribute to poverty reduction. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n4. \nSector overview. Devastated by civil war and conflict, Cambodia has experienced years \nof civil strife and power shortages. Power infrastructures remain underdeveloped, but the recent \ndevelopment  of  the  high-voltage  (230  kV  and  115  kV)  transmission  and  medium-voltage  sub-\ntransmission lines has improved the reliability of power supply. Development partners (including \nADB) have provided assistance for grid extension to Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC), the state-\nowned vertically integrated power utility, which owns and operates most of the generation and \ntransmission facilities as well as the distribution networks in urban areas.  \n \n5. \nAlthough  the  total  domestic  installed  capacity  increased  from  360  megawatts  (MW)  to \n553 MW owing to the commissioning of Kamchay  hydropower plant in 2011, the medium-term \npower supply strategy continues to be to import electricity from neighboring countries (including \nThailand and Viet Nam) to provide affordable electricity services and to facilitate grid extension.  \n \nChallenges:  Power.  Cambodia\u2019s  electrification  rate  of  26%  is  extremely  low  in \n6. \nSoutheast  Asia,  compared  with  96%  in  Viet  Nam  and  70%  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic. 3\n At  153  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  capita,  Cambodia  also  has  one  of  the  lowest \nelectricity consumptions in the region. While the electrification rate in urban areas is nearly 90%, \nit is merely 11% in rural areas. More than 11 million people rely on charged automobile batteries \nfor electricity, and kerosene and candles for lighting.  \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is designed to connect 13,000 households. This target is expected to be achieved only in 2016 since \n\nmany households will not connect immediately because of lack of funds to pay the initial connection fees. \n\n3  World  Bank.  2011.  One  Goal,  Two  Paths\u2013Achieving  Universal  Access  to  Modern  Energy  in  East  Asia  and  the \n\nPacific. Washington, DC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n7. \nIn  contrast,  its  electricity  tariffs  are  one  of  the  highest  in  the  world  because  its \nfragmented grids are mostly supplied by diesel power generators using expensive imported fuel. \nEDC\u2019s tariff for residential consumers is $0.17/kWh in Phnom Penh and typically higher in other \ntowns, depending on the source of electricity and fuel transportation costs. Areas not supplied \nby EDC are serviced by rural electricity enterprises (REEs), which are private service providers \nlicensed  by  EAC  to  distribute  electricity  either  (i)  purchased  from  EDC  in  bulk  (retail  tariff  of \n$0.28\u2013$0.30/kWh), or (ii) generated by its own generators (retail tariff of $0.65\u2013$0.90/kWh). \n \n8. \nNon-power.  In  Cambodia,  93%  of  the  population  relies  on  combustion  of  traditional \nbiomass for cooking. Where traditional biomass is used, it is reported that women and children \nare  exposed  to  air  pollution  levels  in  the  form  of  particulates  that  can  reach  20  times  the \nmaximum recommended levels, and is said to attribute to 600,000 premature deaths annually in \nAsia and the Pacific (footnote 3). A survey in Cambodia found that the incidence of symptoms of \nacute  respiratory  diseases  among  children  under  the  age  of  five  was  four  times  higher  in \nhouseholds using firewood as cooking fuel than those using modern fuel.4\n The same data show \nthat  the  incidence  among  adult  women  is  much  higher  than  men  in  the  same  age  group.  The \nuse  of  traditional  biomass  for  cooking  also  degrades  the  local  environment  through  cutting  of \ntrees, and adds to greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy:  Power.  The  electrification  targets  set  by  the government  are \n9. \n(i) a 100% village electrification rate by 2020, and (ii) a household electrification rate of at least \n70% by 2030. The Strategy and Plan for Development of Rural Electrification in the Kingdom of \nCambodia states that these targets will be attained mainly by grid extension, and partly by the \ndevelopment of mini-grids and stand-alone systems. It is estimated that an investment in excess \nof $1 billion is needed to reach these targets, of which $890 million will be for grid extension.5\n \n \n10.  While the primary responsibility for rural electrification lies with EDC, the REEs continue \nto  play  a  major role  in  supplying the  rural  areas.  Thus,  the  strategy  also  calls for  encouraging \nthe  approximately  250  existing  REEs  to  expand  their  distribution  networks.  The  Rural \nElectrification  Fund,  an  independent  fund  established  under  a  World  Bank  project,  has \nsupported  the  REEs to expand  their  distribution  networks.  After the  closing  of the World  Bank \nproject in January 2012, the fund was incorporated under EDC in August 2012. Strengthening of \nthe  fund  and  EAC,  which  grants  licenses  and  supervises  the  REEs,  is  deemed  critical  for \nattaining the rural electrification targets. \n \nNon-power.  The  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME)  is  preparing  the  rural \n11. \nenergy  strategy  and  implementation  plan,  including  the  sustainable  use  of  charcoal  and  the \npromotion  of  improved  cookstoves.  The  Neang  Kongrey  Stove  (NKS)  is  a  key  initiative  since \nthese  improved  cookstoves  are  tested  to  be  20%  more  efficient  than  traditional  ones  that  are \nwidely  used.  The  NKS  is  expected  to  reduce  pressure  on  household  energy  expenditure,  the \nnatural forest, and drudgery of women and children who traditionally collect firewood. It is also \nreported that each unit will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 0.10\u20130.18 tons per year. \n \n12. \nthrough  a  series  of  investments  and  technical  assistance  projects.6\n                                                \n4  National Institute of Statistics. 2005.

Such  risks  are  mitigated  under  the  project  through \n(i) adopting  a  single  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  package;  (ii)  EPC \nbidding  documents  already  prepared  during  due  diligence;  and  (iii)  engaging  consultants  to \nsupport EDC to implement safeguard compliance measures during implementation. \n  \n13. \nThe proposed project will continue ADB\u2019s successful engagement in Cambodia\u2019s energy \nsector. The project is not included in the country operations business plan, 2011\u20132013,8 but was \nprocessed based on urgent requests by the governments of Australia and Cambodia. It is fully \naligned  with  the  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  Update,  2009\u20132013  of  the  government, \nwhich calls for development of the energy sector through expansion of the electricity network to \nachieve  the  overarching  objective  of  reducing  poverty  from  30.1%  in  2008  to  19.5%  by  2015. \nThe project also corresponds to the objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132013 \nof inclusive economic growth through the development of physical infrastructure such as power \ntransmission,  distribution,  and  rural  electrification.9 The  project  is  coherent  with  ADB\u2019s  energy \nsector  assessment,  strategy,  and  road  map  for  Cambodia,  which  identify  ADB\u2019s  focus  in  the \nsector  as  (i)  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reform;  (ii)  rural  grid-electricity  supply \ninfrastructure; and (iii) greater coordination with development partners.10\n  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  increased  access  to  economical  and  reliable  energy  supply  by  the \n14. \nrural communities. The outcome will be the expanded supply of reliable grid electricity for up to \n8,000 households by December 2014, and sales of up to 90,000 NKS units benefiting at least \n63,000 women by December 2014. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \n\nThe project comprises three distinct components with the following outputs:  \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nComponent  1:  Rural  electrification  of  Svay  Rieng  province.  A  total  of \n220 circuit-kilometers  (cct-km)  of  medium-voltage  lines  and  400  cct-km  of  low-\nvoltage lines with meters will be energized in Svay Rieng province by September \n2014.  \nComponent  2:  Promotion  of  Neang  Kongrey  Stove  in  Kampong  Cham \nprovince.  At  least  12  traditional  cookstove  producers  will  produce  the  NKS  in \nKampong  Cham  province  by  November  2014.

The medium-voltage and low-voltage lines and equipment for Svay Rieng \n21. \nrural  electrification  use  standard  technologies,  and  technical  risks  are  low  as  EDC  has \nexperience with developing and maintaining similar systems. \n \nLocation.  Only  13,460  customers15 receive  EDC  service  in  Svay  Rieng  province,  and \n22. \nabout  2,000  customers  are  being  supplied  by  three  REEs.16 With  110,000 households  in  the \nprovince,  the  overall  electrification  rate  is  14%. 17 The  existing  Svay  Rieng  grid  was  partially \ndeveloped by an ADB project.18\n \n \n23. \nSource  of  power.  EDC\u2019s  isolated  network  in  Svay  Rieng  is  supplied  solely  through \nimport from Viet Nam. The power purchase of 17 MW is being negotiated to increase to 23 MW, \nwhich is sufficient to service the additional connections envisaged under the project. The import \npower tariff is $0.0835/kWh.19\n \n \nAffordability.  The  social  survey  revealed  that  about  88%  of  the  targeted  unelectrified \n24. \nhouseholds rely on automobile batteries that cost $0.48 to charge every few days, 20\n and spend \non average $2.1 per month on electricity. The unit cost of electricity from batteries, calculated to \nbe about $1/kWh, is six times higher than the EDC tariff of $0.16/kWh in Svay Rieng. Therefore, \nonce grid-connected, the households will be able to consume six times more electricity for the \nsame expenditure. In addition, since it typically costs $50 every year to replace the batteries, the \ninitial connection cost of about $60\u2013$70 is judged to be affordable, especially since EDC\u2019s initial \nconnection fee can be repaid in installments over a 6-month period.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2 \n\n25. \nTechnology.  The  NKS  has  been  developed  by  GERES  to  meet  the  needs  of  rural \nhouseholds in Cambodia. It builds on the earlier success of the New Lao Stove, also developed \nby GERES for use by urban households, which has sold over 1 million units since 2003.21\n The \nNKS has been tested in neighboring Kampong Chhnang province, and has been recognized by \n\n                                                \n15 Customer data of Electricity of Svay Rieng as of 12 August 2011. \n16 Two  REEs  purchase  power  from  EDC  and  sell  for  KR1,200/kWh.

GERES  is  an  NGO  with  a  strong  track  record  in  promoting  the \nimproved cookstoves in Cambodia. GERES will train manufacturers of traditional cookstoves in \nKampong  Cham  province  to  produce  the  NKS  and  ensure  quality  control,  while  conducting \nawareness campaigns to promote the NKS to distributors and consumers. \n \nLocation.  This  project  component  will  have  a  high  impact  in  Kampong Cham  province \n27. \nsince it has the highest rural population with the highest number of traditional cookstoves sold in \nrecent years. The province also has the second highest poverty index in the country and one of \nthe lowest forest coverage rates because of deforestation.23\n \n \n28. \nand has a similar, if not longer, service life of up to 18 months. \n \n\nAffordability. The retail price of the NKS at $1.25 is about the same as traditional ones, \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3 \n\n29. \nThe EAPIRF and AERN are networks for regulators, with the objective to improve public \nservices regulatory capacity. The EAPIRF is supported by the World Bank and the Government \nof  Australia,  and  AERN  is  supported  by  ADB.  EAC  staff  will  learn  about  best  regulatory \npractices  in  the  forums  and  receive  customized  programs  from  resource  persons  on  tariff \nmethodology and regulatory reforms appropriate for Cambodia in the targeted workshops. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nA  financial  analysis  has  been  carried  out  for  component  1  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n30. \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.24\n All  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been \nexpressed at constant 2011 prices.

EDC  has  a \ncomprehensive  manual  of  accounting  procedures,  and  has  engaged  internationally  renowned \nauditors  as  independent  external  auditors  to  conduct  annual  audits  in  accordance  with \ninternational auditing standards. \n \n34. \nThe procurement capacity assessment states that EDC has a reasonable understanding \nof  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment.  EDC  established  a \nprocurement  department  in June  2011 to  centralize  procurement,  which  used to be  performed \nby  the  various  project  management  offices.  The  procurement  department  director  has  a \nfinancial  background  whereas  most  staff  members  have  been  appointed  from  the  project \nmanagement  offices.  EDC  has  also  established  a  bid  evaluation  committee  and  a  consultant \nselection  committee,  each  chaired  by  the  procurement  department  director  and  attended  by \nMIME and the Ministry of Finance. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nIn  rural  Cambodia,  the  poverty  rate  is  35%26\n\n35. \n and  the  electrification  rate  is  about  11%. \nThe  majority  of  rural  households,  which  are  predominantly  poor,  rely  on  candles  or  charged \nautomobile batteries for light and fuelwood for cooking. The reliable and economical electricity \nsupplied  through  component  1  will  replace  expensive  batteries  and  reduce  household \nexpenditure  on  energy.  The  improved  efficiency  of  the  cookstoves  to  be  promoted  through \ncomponent  2  will  reduce  the  risk  of  adverse  health  impacts  of  household  pollution  on  women \nand children, as well as reduce the drudgery of fuelwood collection typically performed by them. \n \n36. \nKey  gender  issues  addressed  by  the  project  include  (i)  the  affordability  of  connection \nfees  that  prevent  access  to  energy,  especially  for  low-income  households  headed  by  women; \n(ii) the  high  economic  and  health  costs  associated  with  using  biomass sources  of  energy;  and \n(iii) the  lack  of  women\u2019s  engagement  in  the  energy  sector,  particularly  in  the  design  and \ndissemination of efficient cooking technologies. Under component 1, the gender action plan will \nensure that a staggered installment payment modality for paying EDC\u2019s initial connection fees is \ndisseminated  to  the  poor  (including  households  headed  by  women)  to  access  grid  electricity. \nUnder  component  2,  the  gender  action  plan  will  ensure  that  (i)  63,000  women  (including  poor \nhouseholds and households headed by women) have access to the NKS; (ii) 100% of women \nentrepreneurs of cookstove-producing enterprises are mobilized to venture into NKS production; \n(iii) any new employment opportunities within the local stove producers target at least 50% local \nwomen;  (iv)  100%  of  women  retailers  in  the  targeted  areas  are  provided  with  awareness \nprograms  to  understand  the  various  benefits  of  the  NKS;  (v)  50%  of  the  NGO  facilitators  are \nwomen;  (vi)  100%  of  relevant  women  MIME  staff  are  trained  on  the  NKS  technology; \n(vii) education activities are undertaken to increase women\u2019s awareness of the health impacts of \nhousehold  pollution;  and  for  component  3  (viii)  at  least  15%  of  EAC  staff  participating  in  the \nforums  and  training  programs  are  women.  The  baseline  details  are  provided  in  the  gender \naction plan.27\n \n \n\n                                                \n26 Government  of  Cambodia,  Ministry  of  Planning.  2011.

The  only  expected  adverse  environmental  impact  of  the \nproject is the occupational and community health and safety during construction of the medium-\nvoltage and low-voltage lines under component 1. An initial environmental examination with an \nenvironmental  management  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  12  July  2012.  An  environmental \nsafeguard  expert  will  be  recruited  under  the  project  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the \ntraining  workshops  on \nenvironmental  management  plan.  The  expert  will  also  deliver \nenvironmental management as well as occupational and community health and safety.  \n \n38. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). Adverse social impact is limited to the potential \ncutting  of  some  trees  for  the  stringing  of  the  medium-voltage  and  low-voltage  lines.  Since  the \nmedium-voltage and low-voltage lines are to be installed within the existing right-of-way of the \nrural  roads,  the  impact  is  minimal.  A  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. 28\n As  the  exact  location  of  the  medium-voltage  and  low-\nvoltage  poles  can  only  be  identified  during  detailed  design  by  the  EPC  contractor,  the \nresettlement  plan  will  be  updated  by  the  EPC  contractor.  The  contract  will  explicitly  state  that \nthe  resettlement  plan  must  be  updated  by  the  EPC  contractor,  endorsed  by  EDC\u2019s  project \nmanagement  office  1,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  On-site  installation  works  shall  not \ncommence for a given section until the approved resettlement plan is fully implemented. \n \n39. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Due  diligence  has  confirmed  that  there  are  no \nindigenous  peoples  in  the  project  area  following  the  identifying  characteristics  in  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n40.
