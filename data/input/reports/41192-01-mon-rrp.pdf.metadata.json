The transport sector, which mainly \nconsists of roads and railways, is a key driver of economic development in Mongolia. The road \nnetwork,  including  state  and  local  roads,  is  about  49,250  kilometers  (km)  long,  connecting  21 \nmajor  cities  and  towns  and  160  smaller  villages.  The  1,810  km  Mongolian  railway  system \ncarries  more  than  90%  of  the  freight.  The  main  line  connecting  the  PRC\u2019s  rail  system  in  the \nsouth with the Russian Federation\u2019s Trans-Siberian line in the north was completed in 1955. It is \nthe lifeline of the economy, and most of the economic development in the country during the past \n55  years  has  taken  place  along  this  corridor.  The  strategic  location  of  Mongolia  as  a  transit \ncountry  between  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation  has  contributed  to  the  demand  for \ntransport.  Rapid  economic  growth  in  recent  years  has  boosted  that  demand.  Although  the \nvolume  of  transportation  has  increased,  it  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  rising  demand.  This \nconstrains Mongolia\u2019s ability to achieve its full economic growth potential. \n \n3. \nSince 2003, Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown 7%\u201310% a year, raising \nthe per capita GDP from $638 in 2004 to $1,560 in 2009. Growth in the mining sector contributed \na  large  part  of  the  economic  expansion.  The  discovery  of  huge  mineral  and  coal  reserves, \nparticularly in south Gobi, is expected to continue stimulating growth in the mining industry in the \ncoming  years.  This  will  contribute  to  the  high  GDP  growth  rates.  The  mining  industry  and  the \ndevelopment of the secondary and tertiary sector depend on efficient transportation and logistics. \nMost of the  mining  products are  expected to  be  shipped to the  PRC  or to international  markets \nthrough Tianjin port in the PRC. These shipments would generally have to pass through Zamyn \nUud, the main gateway to the south.  \n \n4. \nMongolia  is  also  a  landlocked  country,  and  such  countries  face  greater  transportation \nchallenges.  Mongolia  has  to  depend  upon  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  PRC  for  access  to \nseaports. In recent years, trade flows have been reoriented from the Russian Federation so that \nmore  than  80%  of  the  imports  now  come  from  the  PRC  through  the  southeast  border  point  in \nZamyn Uud. Most of Mongolia\u2019s exports also transit through Zamyn Uud on their way to Tianjin \nport, the only PRC port available to Mongolia for international trade. As a consequence, the traffic \nhandled at Zamyn Uud has grown rapidly in recent years. Zamyn Uud is now badly congested,3 \nwhich is delaying imports, exports, and transit traffic. Although a number of factors contribute to \nthese delays (unavailable rolling stock, change of gauge, and delays at customs), the main reason \nis the inadequate logistics in Mongolia, particularly at Zamyn Uud. \n \n5. \nEfficient  and  well-developed  logistics  are  essential  for  cost-effective  and  competitive \ntransportation. Trade logistics\u2014the capacity to connect to international markets to ship goods\u2014\nis  essential  for  developing  countries  to  improve  their  competitiveness,  reap  the  benefits  of \n\n                                                 \n1  The  project  is  included  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2009.  Country  Operations  Business  Plan:  Mongolia, \n\n2009\u20132012. Manila. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Discussions with stakeholders revealed that import cargoes could take 10\u201360 days for clearance at Zamyn Uud.  \n\n\f2 \n\nglobalization,  and  fight  poverty  more  effectively  in  an  increasingly  integrated  world.  A  World \nBank-funded  study4 based  on  a  global  survey  of  international  freight  forwarders  and  express \ncarriers  indicated  that  facilitating  the  capacity  to  connect  firms,  suppliers,  and  consumers  is \ncrucial  in  a  world  where  predictability  and  reliability  are  becoming  even  more  important  than \ncosts.  A  country\u2019s  ability  to  connect  to  global  markets  is  fast  becoming  a  key  aspect  of  its \ncapacity  to  compete,  grow,  attract  investment,  create  jobs,  and  reduce  poverty.  Mongolia\u2019s \nperformance in all logistics indicators is poor. Based on a worldwide survey completed by more \nthan 800 logistics professionals, the World Bank has developed a comprehensive cross-country \nassessment  of  logistics  performance  in  155  countries\u2014the  logistics  performance  index. 5 \nMongolia  has  an  overall  logistics  performance  index  ranking  of  141  (1  is  the  best,  155  is  the \nworst).6 It ranks 149 for customs procedures, 144 for logistics costs (including freight rates), 133 \nfor infrastructure quality, 122 for its ability to track and trace shipments, and 147 for timeliness in \nreaching  a  destination.  Mongolia\u2019s  ranking  indicates  serious  problems  in  the  development  of \nlogistics.  These  are  hurting  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  and  have  serious  repercussions  for \noverall economic performance.  \n \nZamyn Uud, a town with a population of about 13,000, is the intermodal interchange point \n6. \nfor  traffic  coming  from  the  PRC  and  Mongolia  to  the  Russian  Federation  and  Europe,  and  vice \nversa.  It  handles  road-to-rail,  rail-to-rail,  and  road-to-road  traffic.  Most  of  the  import  traffic  into \nMongolia  and  transit  traffic  to  the  Russian  Federation  coming  from  the  PRC  (including \ninternational traffic from Tianjin port) by rail is transshipped to rail. In recent years, the volume of \ntraffic coming by road from the PRC has increased.  Most of this traffic is transshipped to rail at \nZamyn  Uud.  Only  a  small  portion  of  the  traffic  coming  by  road  from  the  PRC  is  directly \ntransshipped by road because there is no paved road between Zamyn Uud and Ulaanbaatar, or to \nthe Russian Federation border in the north.7 Most of the goods coming into Mongolia are destined \nfor Ulaanbaatar, the capital, with construction material and foodstuff accounting for the bulk of the \ncargo.  Because  of  the  limited  logistics  facilities  at  Zamyn  Uud,  it  can  take  50\u201360  days  to  get \nshipments  to  Ulaanbaatar.  The  development  of  the  mining  sector  will  create  a  huge  demand  in \nfuture for transporting coal and minerals, and this cannot be met by the existing logistics facilities. \n \n7. \nTo handle the traffic at Zamyn Uud, two facilities were created, one of which was financed \nby a grant from the Government of Japan in 1995. An additional temporary facility was opened on \n11  June  2008.  The  three  facilities  are  basic\u2014they  have  no  warehouses,  limited  and  outdated \nequipment for handling material, no planned layout, no transshipment facilities from road to rail, \nand no heavy duty cranes.  \n \nThe government supports the development of intermodal transport and seeks to build a \n8. \nstrong logistics network in the country to improve Mongolia\u2019s global competitiveness. Because \nof its geographic location, Mongolia is the focal point for international transit trade between the \nPRC,  the  Russian  Federation,  and  Europe.  The  government  is  a  signatory  to  a  number  of \nbilateral and multilateral agreements with neighboring countries and international organizations \nto  facilitate  international  transport  through  Mongolia.  To  address  the  urgent  need  to  improve \nlogistics, the Government of Mongolia asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the \ndevelopment of multimodal logistics facilities at Zamyn Uud.  \n\n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2010. Connecting to Compete: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy. Washington, DC. \n5  It aggregates the performance in seven areas\u2014from traditional ones, such as customs procedures, logistics costs \n(including  freight  rates),  and  infrastructure  quality,  to  new  areas  such  as  the  ability  to  track  and  trace  shipments, \ntimeliness  in  reaching  a  destination,  and  the  competence  of  the  domestic  logistics  industry.  The  survey  had  the \nsupport  and  participation  of  the  International  Association  of  Freight  Forwarders,  the  Global  Express  Association, \nthe Global Facilitation Partnership, and the Turku School of Economics. \n6  The only country in Asia with lower rankings than Mongolia is Afghanistan. \n7  A  two-lane  road  from  Choyr  to  Zamyn  Uud,  partially  financed  by  ADB,  is  under  construction  and  expected  to  be \n\ncompleted by the end of 2012. \n\n \n\n\f9. \nADB has led efforts by international development partners in Mongolia\u2019s transport sector \nwith  a  combination  of  policy-level  and  project-level  interventions.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Mongolia8 and  the  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  update  for  Central \nAsia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)9 identify  transport  as  a  strategically  important \nsector for ADB assistance. Since 1993, ADB has approved four loans and one grant for roads \nand  one  loan  for  aviation  development  with  an  overall  amount  of  $184.7  million.  In  addition, \nADB has financed 12 technical assistance (TA) projects totaling $6.37 million for the transport \nsector. The first four loans supported the rehabilitation and upgrading of Mongolia\u2019s first north\u2013\nsouth  corridor  (CAREC  corridor  4b).10 The  United  Nations  Economics  and  Social  Commission \nfor  Asia  and  Pacific  designated  the  corridor  as  part  of  the  Asian  Highway  Network  (Asian \nHighway  3).  In  western  Mongolia,  ADB  is  supporting  the  development  of  the  first  phase  from \nYarant  to  Hovd  (431  km)  of  a  second  north\u2013south  corridor  in  Mongolia  (CAREC  corridor  4a). \nThis  corridor  is  about  750  km  long,  running  from  the  border  with  the  PRC  at  Yarant,  through \nHovd and Olgiy, to the border with the Russian Federation at Tsagaannuur. It is also part of the \nAsian  Highway  Network  (Asian  Highway  4).  ADB  has  not  provided  any  assistance  for  railway \ndevelopment in Mongolia. In trade facilitation, ADB has financed six TA projects, including five \nregional TA projects and one loan for customs modernization. \n \n10. \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia identifies the underdeveloped transport \nnetwork and inefficient cross-border transport as major sector problems. Its regional cooperation \nstrategy  and  program  update  for  CAREC  identifies  multimodal  transport  as  a  strategic  priority \nand  the  development  of  multimodal  facilities  at  Zamyn  Uud  as  a  key  intervention  for  possible \nADB assistance. The recent ADB sector assistance program evaluation (SAPE) also identifies \nlogistics as an area for future support.11 \n \n11. \nThe  SAPE  found  that  ADB\u2019s  past  program  for  transport  was  successful,  noting  that \nADB\u2019s strategic priorities in the sector were well aligned with Mongolia\u2019s needs. The executing \nagencies for completed and ongoing ADB-financed transport projects in Mongolia have shown \nstrong commitment and generally satisfactory project implementation capabilities. The agencies \nhave  generally  complied  with  loan  covenants.  Environmental  management  was  carried  out \nsatisfactorily. Audit covenants were complied with in a timely manner, and the audited financial \nstatements were generally acceptable.  \n \n12. \nThe  key  lessons  from  the  completed  transport  projects  highlight  the  need  to  (i)  ensure \nthat the executing agency for project processing, implementation, and operation has adequate \ncapacity;  (ii)  prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  and  (iii)  review  traffic  constraints  on  a  network \nbasis. These lessons were incorporated in the current project design.  \n \n13. \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia. It will be \nADB\u2019s  first  intervention  in  the  Mongolia  transport  sector  that  emphasizes  the  integration  of \ndifferent  modes.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the  development  of  a  modern  logistics  facility, \nwhich will lower dwell time,12 increase efficiency, expand network capacity, achieve optimal use \n\n                                                 \n8  Mongolia\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132015, is being developed and is expected to be finalized by January \n\n9  ADB. 2009.

All of these will lead to more efficient \ntransport services.  \n \n14. \nThe project will be implemented in Zamyn Uud, a poor and isolated desert area where \nrural people rely mainly on herding livestock. Inadequate and expensive transport services have \nlimited  economic  opportunities.  The  local  authorities  and  people  living  in  the  area  see  the \ndevelopment of the logistics facility as a way to address this problem and create more service \nsector employment in towns. Logistics development is part of the government\u2019s program for the \nintegrated development of a free economic zone in the area. This facility is expected to play an \nimportant  role  in  the  economic  development  of  Zamyn  Uud  and  the  area,  and  will  enable  and \nstimulate  international,  regional,  and  domestic  trade.  The  proposed  project  is  in  line  with  the \nNational Development Plan and the government's Regional Development Strategy.13 \n \nThe  project  is  a  key  intervention  in  the  transport  sector  that  will  bring  many  technical, \n15. \noperational, safety, and economic benefits. It will establish a well-developed logistics terminal, \nequipped  with  modern  technology  and  managed  by  the  private  sector  through  a  management \ncontract. This will enhance logistics efficiency, increase throughput, and improve reliability\u2014all \nof which will lead to a more affordable, faster, cheaper, and safer transport services in Mongolia. \nThe  proposed  ADB  support  is  expected  to  facilitate  the  flow  of  foreign  and  private  capital  to \nfinance the logistics development in Mongolia. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n16. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  the  international  and  regional  trade  promoted  in  Mongolia. \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  an  efficient,  competitive,  and  reliable  multimodal  transport \nsystem at Zamyn Uud.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n17. \nThe  output of  the  project  will  be  the  development  of  a  multimodal  facility,  with  facilities \nfor  road-to-road,  road-to-rail,  and  rail-to-rail  transshipment  at  Zamyn  Uud.  The  project  will \ndevelop  an  integrated  intermodal  container  terminal  with  customs  and  quarantine  facilities,  as \nwell  as  rail  and  road  access.  Terminal  equipment  and  management  systems  will  be  procured \nand  installed.  Upon  completion,  the  facility  will  be  operated  by  the  private  sector  through  a \nmanagement  contract.  ADB  will  provide  support  for  institutional  capacity  strengthening  in  the \nareas  of  (i)  detailed  design,  (ii) implementation  supervision,  (iii)  staff  capacity  development, \n(iv) environmental management, and (v) selection and execution of a management contract.  \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nFirst  intervention  to  promote  multimodal  transport.  The  project  is  ADB\u2019s  first \n18. \nintervention  to  promote  multimodal  transport  and  the  first  such  intervention  in  Mongolia\u2019s \ntransport  sector.  It  is  also  the  first  ADB  project  to  promote  coordinated  improvements  in \ntransport  infrastructure  and  trade  facilitation,  including  a  logistics  center;  harmonized  cross-\nborder regulations, procedures, and standards; and customs and quarantine modernization.  \n \n19. \nPrivate  sector  participation.  The  project  will  support  private  sector  participation  in \nterminal  operations,  equipment  leasing,  warehousing,  and  light  manufacturing.  It  will  stimulate \nprivate  investment  in  ancillary  industries,  container  freight  stations,  and  other  logistic  support \nfunctions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, insurance, trucking, and warehousing \nin  and  around  the  terminal  for  dry  and  refrigerated  cargo.  The  project  is  also  expected  to \n                                                 \n13 Government of Mongolia. 2008. National Development Strategy: 2007\u20132021.

ADB policy dialogue has emphasized \nthe  need  to  integrate  different  transport  modes  in  order  to  provide  efficient  and  cost-effective \ntransport services. The project seeks to achieve this by providing investment support to develop \nan integrated multimodal logistics facility in Zamyn Uud. Five principles have been followed in \ndesigning  the  facility:  (i)  nondiscriminatory  access  to  the  terminal;  (ii)  railside  access  for  all \nlicensed  railway  undertakings;  (iii)  roadside  access  to  all  operators;  (iv)  transparent  capacity \nallocation  and  pricing;  and  (v)  bundling  of  different  cargoes  (refrigerated  and  containers)  and \nmarket segments (international and domestic), resulting in improved capacity utilization. \n \n21. \nTerminal  capacity  management. The project will adopt international best practices for \ninformation-technology-based  capacity \ncapacity  management, \nmanagement  system  and  terminal  management  software  applications  (for  example,  customs \nadministration  information  system,  customs  external  portal  system,  risk  management  system, \ndata warehouse system, and automated loading unit identification system). The equipment to be \nprocured will be the most modern available in the market, consistent with the needs of current \ndevelopment  in  the  logistics  industry.  The  technologies  will  be  compatible  and  adaptable  to \nexisting systems, and will be proven and scalable. The trial and testing period will be sufficient \nto  ensure  their  successful  operation.  Adequate  maintenance  spares  and  staff  training  will  be \nprovided to support their sustainability.  \n \n22. \ninstitutional \ndevelopment  and  the  enhancement  of  staff  capacity.  Working  with  the  Ministry  of  Road, \nTransportation,  Construction  and  Urban  Development  (MRTCUD),  the  project  management \nconsultants will review the existing institutional arrangements of the Mongolia Railway Authority, \nmake  recommendations  for  strengthening  it,  and  undertake  capacity  development  programs. \nCapacity development support will also be provided to increase private sector participation, and \nto select and execute a management contract to operate the facility upon completion. About 50 \nstaff will be trained, and technical exchanges on logistics management will be organized. \n \nE. \n \n23. \ntaxes  and  duties, \ncontingencies, and interest and other charges during implementation.

The  project  will  (i) reduce  logistics  costs,  promote  international  trade,  and \nenable Mongolia to earn foreign exchange; (ii) enable shippers to benefit from lower transport \ncosts;  (iii) benefit  consumers  and  producers  of  goods  and  services  through  the  provision  of \ntimely  and  efficient  transport  services,  and  lower  logistics  costs;  and  (iv) improve  trade \ncompetitiveness,  enabling  exporters  and  importers  to  benefit  from  lower  costs.  The  combined \nbenefits and impacts outweigh the costs, and net benefits will accrue to the project area.  \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic internal rate of return was calculated by comparing the \u201cwith-project\u201d and \n28. \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenarios.  The  project  will  reduce  the  cost  of  freight  transport  to  and  from \nMongolia.  The  economic  costs  include  (i)  initial  investment  in  fixed  assets  and  facilities, \ncontainer and terminal handling equipment, logistics center management systems, and customs \nand  quarantine  equipment;  (ii)  additional  investment  in  repair  and  maintenance  of  assets  and \nequipment renewal; (iii) change in working capital; and (iv) recurring costs, including fixed and \nvariable  operating  costs.  The  economic  benefits  include  (i) time  savings  for  rail-to-rail,  rail-to-\ntruck,  truck-to-rail,  and  truck-to-truck  loading  operations;  (ii)  diverted  traffic  cost  savings, \nconsisting  of  containerization  benefits  of  current  rail  and  road  traffic  that  is  not  containerized; \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(iii) diverted  traffic,  cargo  loss  or  damage,  and  logistics  cost  savings;  and  (iv) generated \ntransport benefits. The economic internal rate of return indicates that the project is economically \nviable. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the project's economic viability. Changes \nin the key variables do not affect economic viability significantly.  \n \nFinancial  projections,  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \n29. \nManagement and Analysis of Projects,15 assessed the financial viability and sustainability of the \nproject.  The  projected  financial  statements  indicate  that  revenues  will  be  sufficient  to  cover \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  income  taxes,  and  debt  service;  and  provide  a  reasonable \nrate of return. The financial evaluation was undertaken in real terms using constant 2010 prices. \nThe  project  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real \nterms  by  adjusting  for  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation,  and  currency \nfluctuation.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits  were  derived  under  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  compares \nfavorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  The \nproject  is  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  indicate  that  the \nfinancial internal rate of return for the project is robust under assumptions of plausible variability. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \n30. \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement \ndocument and contracts. The recruitment of consultants will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and \nthe MRTCUD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM (footnote 14). \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nAn  efficient,  multimodal  facility  will  enable  the  efficient  flow  of  goods,  promoting  trade \n32. \nand  development  of  the  local  economy  of  Zamyn  Uud.  It  will  help  increase  standards  of living \nand  reduce  poverty  by  removing  transport  constraints  to  sustainable  economic  growth. \nProviding  efficient,  multimodal  transportation  in  underserved,  less-developed  areas  will  create \nthe  conditions  necessary  for  developing  local  resources,  and  creating  jobs  and  other  income-\ngenerating  opportunities.  The  major  project  beneficiaries  will  be  (i)  the  government,  which  will \nbenefit from higher trade earnings; (ii) consumers, who will benefit from affordable products; and \n(iii) freight shippers, who will benefit from less damage to shipments and more affordable, faster, \nand safer shipment deliveries. The poor will benefit from the local economic improvement and \nemployment generation. \n \n33. \nThe jobs created by the development of the  logistics facility at Zamyn Uud will provide \npotential new sources of income for women and other vulnerable groups. They will benefit from \nmultimodal development and have equal access to employment and wages. The development \nwill  generate  demand  for  local  labor  and  increase  worker  productivity  and  wages.  The \nexpansion of secondary and tertiary industries will generate additional jobs for men and women \nclose to their homes. By participating more fully in the labor market, women will increase their \nnet income and savings, improve overall family welfare, and upgrade their status.  \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n\fimpacts, \n\nEconomic  development  has  generated  some  adverse  social \n\n34. \nincluding \nincreased  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  or  sexually  transmitted  infections,  and  human  and  drug  trafficking. \nThese  particularly  affect  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  girls.16 Such  adverse  trends \ncould  increase  as  trade  expands.  Stakeholders  were  consulted  about  these  potential  social \nimpacts  during  project  preparation.  A  consultation  and  participation  plan  will  be  carried  out \nduring project implementation. \n \n35. \nThis  project  will  seek  to  increase  awareness  and  prevent  such  social  impacts.  The \nmeasures to achieve this are set out in the environmental management plan of the draft initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE). 17  Some  will  be  focused  on  the  project  site  (the  logistics \nterminal)  and  managed  by  the  Mongolian  Railway  Authority;  others  will  assist  the  local \ncommunity in Zamyn Uud with the support of the local government. Funding support will also be \nmade available through an ADB-financed TA project for HIV/AIDS prevention.18 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n36. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  The  project  preparatory  TA \nconsultants prepared  a  draft  IEE,  including  an environmental  monitoring  plan  and a  grievance \nredress mechanism. The IEE was submitted to the Ministry of Nature, Environment and Tourism \nfor  review  and  endorsement.  The  project  could  have  adverse  environmental  impacts  in  the \nfollowing areas: (i) soil erosion from cut and fill; (ii) deterioration of underground water quality of \nadjacent  waterways;  and  (iii)  public  health  and  safety,  including  HIV/AIDS  or  sexually \ntransmitted  infections.  The  IEE  concluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be \nsuccessfully  mitigated  through  the  use  of  best  practices  and  appropriate  technologies. \nImplementation  of  the  environmental  management,  mitigation,  and  monitoring  programs \nincluded in the IEE will ensure compliance with ADB and government environmental guidelines \nand procedures. Regular monitoring and audits will be conducted to ensure that standards and \nregulations are followed.  \n \n37. \nThe  site  for  the  logistics  terminal  is  vacant  desert  land  owned  by  the  government.  No \none  resides  on  or  uses  the  land.  The  road  that  will  connect  with  the  main  highway  to  the  site \ndoes not require any land acquisition, or demolition of structures or trees. Therefore, the project \nis  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Zamyn  Uud  does  not  have  any  ethnic \nminority  communities;  the  area  is  settled  by  Khalkh  people,  the  dominant  ethnic  group  in \nMongolia. Some minority households have migrated to Zamyn Uud for work, but they have been \nincorporated  into  the  local  community.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that \n38. \neconomic  circumstances  would  have  to  become  substantially  worse  for  the  project  to  lose  its \neconomic  viability.  Risks  associated  with  potential  changes  in  government  policy  are  minimal. \nThe project is a high-priority investment supported by the government. The development of this \nfacility will increase the trade competitiveness of Mongolia and promote industrial development, \nwhich  will  stimulate  economic  development.  Macroeconomic  conditions  are  expected  to  be \nfavorable in view of the expected development of major mining operations in south Gobi. Stable \neconomic performance is expected based on the government's projections and growth trends. \n\n                                                 \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB.  2008.

The use \nof  project  management  consultants  will  ensure  that  the  design  is  robust  and  the  facility  is \ndeveloped  in  a  timely  manner.  A  potential  risk  is  a  delay  in  implementation,  which  would \npostpone the project benefits. However, MRTCUD has experience implementing ADB-financed \nprojects,  has  adequate  capacity,  and  will  set  up  a  project  implementation  unit  with  personnel \nexperienced  in  project  implementation.  The  consulting services  provided  under  the  project  will \nhelp  strengthen \nthe  project \nimplementation  unit.  The  steering  committee  set  up  to  coordinate  implementation  will  support \nsmooth  coordination  among  line  ministries,  different  agencies,  and  stakeholders;  and  provide \nguidance  to  support  the  timely  completion  of  the  project.
