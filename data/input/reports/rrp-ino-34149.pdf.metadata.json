Focusing on the needs of the poor, the \nDHS2  will  increase  the  quality  and  effectiveness  of  health  and  family \nplanning  services  in  the  project  area  by  improving  clinical  and \nmanagerial  skills  of  health  personnel,  upgrading  health  facilities  and \nequipment,  and  involving  civil  society  in  planning  and  monitoring  of \nservice provision. \n \nDecentralization  offers  new  opportunities  to  strengthen  health  and \nfamily planning services in the regions through locally adapted reforms \ngiving  health  services  providers  more  appropriate  incentives,  skills, \nsupervision,  material  support,  and  discretionary  authority  needed  to \noffer  high  quality  services,  and  providing  clients  with  information, \nfinancial  means,  and  bargaining  power  required  to  elicit  appropriate \nresponses.  A  mix  of  human,  physical,  and  financial  resources  are \nneeded  to  help  the  regions  and  the  central  Government  plan, \nimplement,  manage,  monitor,  and  evaluate  a  range  of  programs  and \nactivities.  Low  quality  of  public  health  services  in  Indonesia  affects \nmainly  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  and  is  linked  to  a  range  of \nshortcomings in the health sector, which indicate chronic underfunding. \nThe  DHS2  will  address  these  deficits  while  focusing  on  the  health \nneeds  of  the  poor.  A  better  health  status  will  give  the  poor  and  the \ncommunity  at  large  greater  opportunity  to  fully  participate  in  the \neconomic development of their specific region and the country.  \n \nThe DHS2 will help improve the health status of people in 8 provinces \nof  Indonesia,  particularly  concentrating  on  improving  health  services \ngeared  to  women,  children,  and  infants.    The  DHS2  will  increase  the \nclinical  and  managerial  capacity  of  health  personnel  at  all  levels  of \ngovernment, strengthen regulatory and quality assurance functions, and \nresult in improved local health and family planning services. \n \nThe total project cost is $143.0 million equivalent, of which $73.2 million \n(51%) is the foreign exchange cost and $69.8 million equivalent (49%) \nrepresents the local currency costs. \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nSource \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n73.2 \n  0.0 \n73.2 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n26.8 \n43.0 \n69.8 \n\n($ million equivalent)\nTotal \nCost \n100.0 \n43.0 \n143.0 \n\n70 \n30 \n100\n\n% \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n \n \nThe  DHS2  will  be  financed  by  two  loans  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB).  A  loan  of  $64.8  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility. \nThe loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end \nfee of 0.5%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \nAnother loan of $35.2 million from ADB's Special Funds resources will \nbe  provided,  and  will  have  a  maturity  of  32  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1% per annum during the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  thereafter. The  Borrower  is  the  Government  of \nIndonesia. \n \nThe total amount of $100.0 million provided by ADB will cover 100% of \nthe foreign exchange costs (51% of the total project cost), and 38% of \nthe  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining \n$43.0 million equivalent (30% of total project cost). \n \nThe  Government  will  forward  loan  proceeds  as  grants  to  regional \ngovernments  participating  in  the  DHS2,  taking  into  account  that  the \nDHS2  will  directly  benefit  the  poor  and  will  focus  on  essential  health \nservices \nregional \ngovernments will contribute to the project costs in accordance with their \nfiscal capacity. \n \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2010 \n \n \n30 June 2010 \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\nthat  do  not  generate \n\nrevenues.  Participating \n\n \nMOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project;  BKKBN  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency for family planning activities. \n \nThe  secretary  general  of  MOH  will  be  the  project  director  who  will  be \nadvised  by  a  national  steering  committee  on  policy  matters  and \nintersectoral  coordination.  The  senior  advisor  to  MOH  dealing  with \ndecentralization will be the deputy project director in MOH and will also \nact  as  project  manager  MOH.  The  BKKBN  principal  secretary  will  be \ndeputy  project  director  for  BKKBN.  Both  deputy  project  directors  will \nprovide policy guidance and will ensure coordination with other projects \nsupporting  decentralization.  The  director  of  program  and  policy  of \nBKKBN  will  be  the  deputy  project  manager  of  BKKBN.  A  national \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\ntechnical  team  of  ministry  experts  will  advise  the  deputy  project \ndirectors. A central project implementation unit in MOH and a subunit in \nBKKBN  will  coordinate  project  implementation  at  the  national  level.  A \nsimilar  management  structure  will  be  established  at  the  two  regional \nlevels  of  government.  Provincial  project  implementation  units  will \nsupport  and  coordinate  district  and  city  implementation  units.  Health \ncommittees  with  a  wide  representation  of  government  services, \nprofessional associations, and civil society will be established to advise \nthe regional project directors and ensure participation and transparency \nof  decision-making.  In  the  regions,  regular  government  staff  will  be  in \ncharge of project implementation full time. The DHS2 funds will be used \nto contract additional project management staff where needed. As local \ncapacity  increases  with  project  support,  regional  governments  will  be \nable to progressively replace contracted staff with civil servants. \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  civil  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  The award of civil work contracts with an estimated value \nof  $2.0  million  or  more  will  follow  the  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedure, while local competitive bidding will apply to contracts valued \nbelow  $2.0  million.  Procurement  of  goods  will  be  consolidated  at  the \nprovincial  or  central  level  while  an  adequate  representation  of  lower \nlevel governments will be assured in the procurement committees. The \nparticipating  regions  will  sign  separate  contracts  with  the  winning \nbidder,  and  guarantee  payment  of \nthe  goods. \nInternational  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  to  procure  goods \nestimated to cost more than $500,000 equivalent. If the estimated value \nis  less  than  $500,000,  international  shopping  procedures  will  apply, \nexcept  for  vehicles,  motorcycles,  and  office  equipment,  where  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures will apply. Items of less than $100,000 \nequivalent can be procured under direct purchase procedures.  \n \n\ntheir  share  of \n\n \nConsulting Services  The  DHS2  will  fund  a  total  of  130  person-months  of  international  and \n388  person-months  of  domestic  consultancy  providing  support  in \nproject management, health system development, health planning and \nfinancing,  human \nresources  development,  public  health,  health \ninformation  and  health  promotion,  civil  works,  and  health  technology. \nThe  consultants  will  be engaged  by  the central project  implementation \nunitis of MOH and BKKBN according to needs at national level and on \nrequest of the regions. The consultants will be engaged individually or \nthrough  consulting  firms  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB\u2019s  quality  and  cost-based \nselection method will apply for consulting firms. \n \n\n \n\n\fProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n  v\n\nThe DHS2 will help to improve the health of the population at large and \nof poor and vulnerable groups in particular through increased spending \nfor health, better prioritization and targeting of health services, improved \nresource  mobilization,  enhanced  service  quality,  and  better  access  for \nvulnerable  groups.  It  will,  above  all,  benefit  women,  children,  and \ninfants  due  to  its  priority  support  for  mother  and  child  health  care.  An \nestimated  186,000  girl  infants  (39,400  of  them  poor),  and  1.51  million \nunder-five  girls  (315,000  of  them  poor)  will  benefit  from  the  DHS2. \nAltogether  about  4  million  poor  will  benefit  from  the  DHS2.    Given  the \nemphasis  on  capacity  building,  health  professionals  and  other  staff \ndelivering  health  services  at  all  levels  will  be  direct  beneficiaries.  At \nleast 50% of participants in managerial and clinical training activities will \nbe female health staff. \n \nAs  the  DHS2  covers  98  regional  governments,  new  decentralized \nplanning  and  management  mechanisms  set  up  at  subnational  levels \nmay  not  function  as  anticipated  and  national  leadership  may  not  be \nstrong enough to provide necessary regulatory guidance and technical \nsupport.    DHS2  funds  will  be  used  to  contract  qualified  management \nstaff, to be progressively replaced over the project life by civil servants. \nDirect  project  support  will  be  provided  to  MOH  and  BKKBN  to \nstrengthen  their  management  and  supervisory  functions,  including \nfiduciary  controls.  The DHS2  will  also  introduce  the  use  of  information \nand  communication \nfor  supervision,  monitoring,  and \nsupport. \n  \nLocal  autonomy  over  resource  allocation  and  lack  of  experience  may \nlead to short-term politically motivated activities, for example support for \nhigh  profile  hospital  services.  Project  activities  will  facilitate  policy \ndialogue  with  regional  governments  to  advocate  investment  in  the \nhealth  sector  aiming  at  an  allocation  of  5%  of  the  regional  annual \nbudget  for  the  health  sector  by  the  end  of  the  DHS2.    All  capacity-\nbuilding  and  advocacy  activities  of  the  DHS2  emphasize  cost-efficient \nallocation of resources needed. \n   \nIssues of good governance will be addressed by (i) close supervision by \nthe  central  project  coordination  unit,  (ii)  mandatory  community \nparticipation \nincreased \ntransparency based on the dissemination of project-related information \nto  nongovernment  organizations  and  the  display  of  project  information \non a project web site. \n\nin  district  health  committees,  and \n\ntechnology \n\n(iii) \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \n\n \n1. \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Second Decentralized Health Services Project (DHS2).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nFrom  1970  to  2001,  life  expectancy  at  birth  increased  from  46  to  64  years  of  age  for \nmales  and  to  68  years  of  age  for  females,  reflecting  the  decline  in  the  infant  and  under-5 \nmortality  rates.  Infant  mortality  declined  from  145  to  33  infant  deaths  and  under-5  mortality \ndeclined  from  172  to  45  per  thousand  live  births.  Easier  access  to  health  services  combined \nwith economic growth and better education contributed to improving the health status. However, \nIndonesia\u2019s  health  status  indicators  remain  low2  and  achievements  have  been  uneven  across \nprovinces,  between  urban  and  rural  areas,  and  between  rich  and  poor  segments  of  the \npopulation. With 25% of all under-5-year-old children underweight and 50% of pregnant women \nsuffering  from  iron  deficiency  anemia,  malnutrition  remains  a  public  health  issue.  Maternal \nmortality, estimated at 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, is unacceptably high. While \ncardiovascular and chronic diseases have become the main causes of mortality, infectious and \nparasitic diseases, which particularly affect the poor, dominate morbidity. Tuberculosis, malaria, \nrespiratory  infections,  and  diarrhea  remain  major  public  health  issues.  This  combination  of \nchronic,  life-style,  and  infectious  diseases  creates  a  double  burden  of  diseases  for  the  health \nsystem  of  the  country.  A  detailed  description  of  the  health  sector  and  its  performance  in  the \nproject area is in Appendix 2. \n \n3. \nOver  the  last  3  decades,  Indonesia  has  given  priority  to  improving  physical  access  to \nprimary  health  care  (PHC)  services.  The  average  distance  to  a  health  facility  in  2002  was  5 \nkilometers  in  rural  areas  and  1.5  kilometers  in  urban  areas,  but  chronic  underfunding  and \ninefficient  targeting  has  prevented  better  results.  Total  national  expenditures  for  health  have \nbeen low by international standards. In 1995, only 1.6% of gross domestic product was spent on \nhealth.  The  proportion  increased  to  2.7%  in  2000,  but  the  Government\u2019s  share  of  health \nexpenditure, excluding external aid, fell from 46.0% in 1995 to 23.7%. The percentage of central \nGovernment  expenditure  allocated  to  the  health  sector  is  only  2%,  compared  with  5%  in  the \nPhilippines  and  8%  in  Thailand.  Health  expenditure  per  capita  ($19)  is  below  the  average  of \nlow-income  countries  ($21),  the  Philippines  ($33),  and  Thailand  ($71).  Chronic  underfunding \nhas  affected  maintenance  of  facilities;  procurement  of  medical  equipment,  drugs,  and  other \nsupplies; and the quality of training for health workers, before and after graduation. A low 30% \nutilization rate of public health services suggests low client satisfaction.  \n \n4. \nConsultations  in  the  villages  during  project  preparation  confirmed  that  low  quality  and \ninadequate  services  that  do  not  respond  to  needs  felt  by  the  local  population  were  important \nreasons for low utilization of public health services. For the poor, even minimal user fees can be \nan  obstacle  to  the  use  of  health  services.  The  World  Bank  found  that  the  richest  20%  of  the \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Project  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  was  provided  for  the  Project   \n(Asian  Development  Bank  [ADB].  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  Indonesia  for  the  Preparation  of  the  Second \nDecentralized Health Services Project [JSF]. Manila). \n\n2   For example, in Thailand infant mortality was 25 and in the Philippines 30 and maternal mortality was 44 and 170, \n\nrespectively. \n\n\f 2\n\npopulation  were  3  and  1.5  times  more  likely  to  use  inpatient  and  outpatient  public  health \nservices, respectively, than the poorest 20% of the population.3 \n \n5. \nThe Government has developed a successful family planning program advocating birth \nspacing,  small  families,  and  family  welfare.4  Spearheaded  by  the  National  Family  Planning \nCoordinating  Board  (BKKBN),  the  success  of  the  program  with  its  different  targets  and \nstrategies for each province can be attributed to its flexibility, adaptability, and results-oriented \napproach.  Modern  methods  of  contraception  have  been  available  throughout  the  country, \nresulting in a contraceptive prevalence rate of 56.7% in 2002. The total fertility rate reflecting the \naverage  number  of  births  per  woman  declined  from  4.1  in  1985  to  2.6  in  2002\u20132003,  and  the \nannual population growth rate steadily decreased from 2.2% in 1985 to 1.47% in 2000.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nSince January 2001, regional governments are responsible for financing and delivery of \nhealth  services  in  the  context  of  regional  autonomy  and  decentralization.  With  second-tier \nregional  governments  now  being  the  deciding  authority  regarding  health  policies  and  budget \nallocations for their regions, the national and provincial authorities cannot determine the health \nagenda of districts and cities anymore. This raises issues of coordination and regulation as well \nas  of  quality  assurance.  The  announcement  of  obligatory  functions  and  minimum  service \nstandards has given the national Government an important tool to ensure quality and regulation \nin the sector. This will allow the Ministry of Health (MOH) to specifically address shortcomings of \nregional  health  services  in  relation  to  defined  service  standards.  Project-related  annual  health \nsector  plans  of  regional  governments  as  practiced  by  the  ongoing  Decentralized  Health \nServices  (DHS1)  Project  provide  another  opportunity  to  enforce  quality  and  compliance  with \ndefined  standards  because  plans  have  to  be  consistent  with  the  central  Government's  norms \nand quality requirements. \n \nDecentralization  can  increase  accountability  of  health  service  providers  and  regional \n7. \nauthorities and offer greater opportunity for the community to influence resource allocation and \nservice quality. Since the allocation of resources is now decided by elected regional authorities \nand  no  longer  by  technocrats  in  the  central  Government,  allocation criteria  and  priorities  have \nbecome  part  of  the  political  debate.  Without  appropriate  capacity  building  and  advocacy, \nregional  governments  may  not  become  aware  of  the  benefits  of  investing  in  health  and  family \nplanning, and health needs of poor and vulnerable groups may not become a political priority. \nAlthough quality PHC services, maternal and child health, and nutrition programs are universally \nrecognized to be highly cost-effective programs that benefit the poor, regional governments may \nprefer  to  invest  in  high  profile  hospitals  that  would  undermine  sector  cost-effectiveness. \nDecentralization requires a new approach and a new role from MOH different from the previous \nfocus on top-down planning and budgeting.  \n \n8. \nEqually, new skills and knowledge are required at the regional levels. In a decentralized \nenvironment,  regional  health  staff  are  in  charge  of  needs  identification,  planning,  budgeting, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation.  Essential  drugs  must  be  purchased  and  health  staff  must  be \nproperly  qualified  to  prescribe  them  in  an  appropriate  manner.  Even  with  qualified  health \npersonnel,  poor  health  facilities  and  insufficient  medical  equipment  prevent  the  provision  of \nquality services. Also, financing of the health services in terms of cost sharing between different \n\n                                                 \n3   World Bank. 2003.

(preliminary  report). \n\nJakarta. \n\n\f  3\n\nlayers of government and the mobilization of additional resources remains a problem. In  most \ndistricts, cities, and provinces, the managerial capacity to address these issues is weak or does \nnot exist.  \n \nThe quantity and qualification of primary health workers is a major issue. Indonesia has \n9. \non average one doctor per 6,000\u20137,000 people, but the situation is worse in rural areas where \nremote localities remain underserved with less than one doctor per health center. Young doctors \nand  midwives  are  required  to  provide  PHC  services  under  a  3-year  compulsory  contract.  The \ndoctors work in district hospitals and health centers and midwives are posted in health centers \nand  in  small  village-based  health  facilities.  Incentives,  benefits,  and  opportunities  vary  and \ndepend largely on the individual regional government. Specialized doctors tend to move toward \nbigger  urban  centers,  which  offer  better  professional  opportunities  and  monetary  incentives. \nThis creates a major problem for the recruitment and retention of qualified health personnel in \ndistricts, cities, and provinces that cannot provide such incentives.  \n \n10. \nVillage midwives are most often the first contact of the rural population when it comes to \nhealth  services  and  provide  services  that  are  much  appreciated  by  the  poor.  Their  training, \nhowever, does not equip them to deliver quality PHC services. There is a need to offer regular \ntraining,  supervision,  and  necessary  equipment  and  essential  drugs.5  MOH  is  implementing  a \nnew training policy to address this issue, developing hospital-based training in provinces and in \nselected districts, expecting to attract local professionals that will stay in the region.  \n \n11. \nStarting  on  1  January  2004,  BKKBN  will  have  to  decentralize  its  successful  family \nplanning services, and regional governments will become responsible for ensuring access to the \nfamily planning and reproductive health programs. BKKBN\u2019s vision is to help Indonesian families \nbecome prosperous, healthy, and independent, with two children only, and to provide access to \nfamily  planning  services  for  the  poor.  A  particular  policy  of  BKKBN  is  to  ensure  continuous \navailability of free or subsidized contraceptives for the poor. However, this policy may be difficult \nto  maintain  because  major  donors\u2014in  particular  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment\u2014have announced their withdrawal from the population and family planning sector.  \n \n12.  MOH and BKKBN are obliged by decentralization laws to adjust to new roles that include \nregulatory and standardization functions; provision of guidance and capacity building; reform of \nthe health sector, including health care financing; mobilization of resources; and monitoring and \nevaluation of service quality. MOH has developed a list of essential health services that must be \nprovided  by  districts  and  municipalities.6    The  delivery  of  such  services  is  in  the  hands  of \nregional  governments,  and  MOH's  and  BKKBN's  role  is  to  advocate  a  comprehensive  and \nintegrated approach to health problems instead of implementing activities through line agencies.  \n \n13. \nEnsuring universal access to PHC services, better targeting of the poor and vulnerable \ngroups,  and  mobilization  of  new  resources  for  health  care  financing  are  MOH\u2019s  and  BKKBN\u2019s \npriority strategies, which have been linked to the achievement of the health-related Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The Government is committed to achieving the MDGs. But without \naddressing specific health needs of the poor, the MDG targets will be difficult to achieve. MOH \nhas  defined  four  priority  strategies  in  the  context  of  its  Healthy  Indonesia  2010  Strategy  that \ndescribes  MOH\u2019s  new  vision,  mission,  and  direction:  health-conscious  national  development, \n\n                                                 \n5   A  World  Bank  project  supporting  decentralization  in  the  health  sector,  Health  Workforce  and  Services  Project, \n\napproved on 12 June 2003, plans to address health workforce issues systematically. \n\n6   Decree of Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia No. 1457/ Menkes/SK/X/2003, published on 10 October \n\n2003, on Minimum Service Standards in the Health Sector in Districts and Municipalities. \n\n\f 4\n\ninsurance,  and \n\nimproved  professional  qualification,  greater  coverage  with  health \ndecentralization of authority and public accountability.  \n \nSimilarly, ADB\u2019s health sector policy7 emphasizes access for all to basic health services \n14. \nthat  are  effective,  cost-efficient,  and  affordable.    The  policy  highlights  (i)  health  of  the  poor, \nwomen, and indigenous people; (ii) setting of clear priorities to ensure the most efficient use of \nresources; (iii) mobilization of resources for the public health sector; (iv) building of managerial \ncapacity;  (v)  testing  of  innovative  approaches;  (vi)  introduction  of  effective  new  technologies; \n(vii)  focus  on  functions  that  constitute  public  goods;  and  (viii)  encouragement  of  collaboration \nbetween  public  and  private  health  service  providers.  The  country  strategy  and  program8 \nemphasizes  reducing  poverty  and  regional  inequalities,  focusing  on  good  governance  and \ncapacity  for  long-term  sustainable  development;  meeting  local  development  needs  through \ndecentralization,  promoting  human  development;  mainstreaming  environmental  management; \nand reducing poverty by promoting long-term growth. \n \n15. \nExternal  assistance  to  Indonesia\u2019s  health  sector  increased  from  about  $573  million \nbetween 1994 and 1997 to approximately $2.24 billion from 1998 to 2002. The main sources of \nassistance  were  ADB,  World  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  United  States \nAgency  for  International  Development,  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  the \nNetherlands, and the specialized United Nations (UN) agencies: UN Development Programme \n(UNDP),  UN  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  UN  Population  Fund  (UNFPA),  and  World  Health \nOrganization  (WHO).  External  assistance  mainly  supported  health  services  quality,  nutrition, \ncommunity health, women\u2019s health, and family planning. Details are provided in Appendix 3. \n \nC. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n16. \nAs  part  of  a  series  of  externally-financed  projects  supporting  decentralization  of  the \nhealth  sector,  the  Project  is  a  geographical  extension  of  ADB\u2019s  DHS1,9  and  incorporates \nlessons  learned  from  the  DHS1  and  other  ongoing  projects,  in  particular  the  World  Bank-\nfinanced provincial health projects I and II and its Health Workforce and Service Project.  The \nlack  of  professional  and  management  skills  at  the  regional  level  emerged  as  the  biggest \nbottleneck in these projects. A technically strong central project implementation unit (PIU) that \nsupports  local  implementation  units  proved  to  be  essential  for  achieving  project  objectives.  In \naddition, implementation arrangements need to clearly define the responsibilities of each level \nof governance, avoiding organizational ambiguities that can undermine system performance. In \nthe  Family  Health  and  Nutrition  Project,10  a  technical  adviser  attached  to  the  PIU  played  a \ndecisive  role  ensuring  that  project  activities  remained  aligned  with  project  objectives.  This \ntechnical adviser proved instrumental in coordinating policies and guidelines from various MOH \ndirectorates.   \n \nDetailed  implementation  schedules  for  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  are \n17. \nessential  to  avoid  initial  delays  of  activities.  New  communication  technologies  in  terms  of \nelectronic mail and Internet can help to overcome communication problems in a country as vast \nas Indonesia, though the required physical infrastructure may not be sufficiently developed in all \nregions. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic demonstrated that technical \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector.

Manila. \n\n\f  5\n\nsupport  and  coordination  by  the  Government  remain  indispensable  to  ensure  effectiveness  of \nservice delivery.  \n \n18. \nIn 1998, spurred by the Asian economic crisis, the Government started implementing its \nSocial Safety Net Program to protect access to social services for the poor.11 It was initiated as \nan  externally-supported  emergency  program  and  is  financed  in  the  meantime  by  special \nGovernment  subsidies,  but  still  waits  to  be  transformed  into  a  sustainable  long-term  program. \nMOH focused its efforts on PHC services, including emergency hospitalizations. The program, \nsupported  by  ADB  with  two  sector  development  programs,  offered  free  access  to  essential \nhealth services for the poor at health centers and district hospitals using block grant subsidies to \nthese  facilities;  a  health-center-based  feeding  program  for  infants,  children,  and  pregnant \nwomen;  and  increased  outreach  activities  of  the  village  midwives.  As  a  result,  visits  to  health \ncenters  increased  and  more  deliveries  were  attended  by  trained  health  personnel.  The  Social \nSafety  Net  Program  brought  a  significant  infusion  of  cash  resources  for  the  health  sector. \nFocusing  on  a  limited  number  of  activities  that  targeted  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  this \nProgram  has  protected  universal  access  to,  and  increased  utilization  of  essential  health \nservices. \n \n19. \nHealth  sector  reforms  are  not  always  well  understood  by  regional  governments  and \nrequire  guidance,  advocacy,  and  continued  dialogue  initiated  by  the  national  Government. \nDeveloping better coordination of public and private service provision at the regional level has \nbeen  advocated  by  DHS1.    It  took  2  years  of  persuasion  before  regional  governments  were \nwilling  to  consider  developing  such  partnerships.  Still,  advocacy  is  considered  to  be  more \nsuccessful than prescription by project design.  In view of weak capacities, flexibility is needed \nduring project implementation to allow project beneficiaries to modify plans and priorities based \non  their  increasing  knowledge  and  skills.  Thus,  a  mix  of  human,  physical,  and  financial \nresources  is  needed,  including  more  effective  bottom-up  planning  and  implementation \nmechanisms  that  promote  stakeholder  participation.  Above  all,  health  services  must  become \nresponsive to the needs of the poor segments of society to have an impact on the health status \nof the population at large. \n  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n20. \nThe DHS2 Project will help improve the health of the population in the project area, as \nmeasured  by  health-related  indicators  of  the  MDGs,  through  better  PHC  services  focusing  on \nthe  needs  of  women,  infants,  children,  and  the  poor.  The  purpose  of  the  DHS2  is  to  improve \nhealth services in 8 provinces and 90 districts and cities.  \n \nThe  DHS2  will  cover  districts  and  cities  in  the  following  provinces:  Bangka  Belitung; \n21. \nCentral and South Kalimantan; East and West Nusa Tenggara; Gorontalo; South Sulawesi; and \nSouth  Sumatra.  Bangka  Belitung  and  Gorontalo  are  two  newly  created  provinces  that  need \nspecial support to develop their management capacity. South Sumatra and Central and South \nKalimantan were part of previous ADB-supported health sector projects and their participation in \nthe  DHS2  will  enable  them  to  consolidate  previous  achievements.  In  East  and  West  Nusa \nTenggara,  the  DHS2  will  help  integrate  inputs  of  various  externally-financed  interventions  to \ndevelop a more comprehensive and efficient local health system.  \n\n                                                 \n11  The program started with establishing criteria to define the poor. These criteria will be used for the Project. \n\n\f 6\n\nThe  DHS2  aims  at  achieving  (i)  improved  capacity  at  the  regional  level  to  ensure  the \n22. \nprovision of quality health and family planning services; (ii) local health services with improved \nequitability,  quality,  and  financially  sustainability;  and  (iii)  improved  capacity  of  MOH  and \nBKKBN to support regional governments to deliver such services. Capacity-building activities at \nall levels of government will provide much needed managerial and clinical skills to deliver quality \nPHC  services  and  address  the  needs  of  the  poor.    At  least  50%  of  the  participants  in  DHS2-\nfunded training programs will be women.  Investments in PHC facilities, vehicles and equipment, \nand the provision of essential drugs will complement capacity-building inputs of the DHS2.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nin  exploiting \n\nthe  opportunities  of  decentralization \n\n23. \nThe  DHS2  consists  of  three  components.  The  first  component  will  strengthen  the \nhuman,  physical,  and  organizational  capacity  of  districts  and  cities  through  (i)  managerial  and \nclinical  training;  (ii)  upgrading  of  health  facilities  and  purchase  of  equipment,  vehicles  for \noutreach activities, and essential medical supplies; (iii) development of institutional mechanisms \nthat  facilitate  community  participation  and  promote  accountability  and  transparency  of  service \nproviders through regional health committees; and (iv) strengthening of regulatory and licensing \nfunctions  that  protect  the  poor.  The  managerial  training  will  cover  health  service  planning  and \nbudgeting, health care financing, and monitoring and evaluation, and will promote participatory \napproaches  to  identify  local  health  and  family  planning  needs  and  to  identify  and  implement \ntechnically  appropriate  and  locally  acceptable  health  programs.  Clinical  training  for  doctors, \nnurses,  and  midwives  will  be  evidence-based  and  on-site  at  health  centers  and  referral \nhospitals,  focusing  on  PHC,  maternal  and  child  health,  and  communicable  disease  control. \nUpgrading  of  facilities  concentrates  mainly  on  the  rehabilitation  of  health  posts  for  midwives, \nhealth  centers,  subhealth  centers,  and  selected  district  hospitals,  with  a  limited  scope  for  the \nconstruction of new facilities. Technical assistance will support advocacy workshops and public \nprivate  partnership  meetings  to  empower  district  health  committees  that  will  become \ninstrumental \nincreased \ntransparency, focus on local needs and conditions, and inclusion of civil society in the planning \nand delivery of health services. The DHS2 will provide guidelines that refocus the licensing and \naccreditation of personnel and health facilities on better quality and access to health services for \nwomen, vulnerable groups, and the poor. \n \n24. \nThe  second  component  will  develop  professional  capacity,  improve  referral  regional \nhospitals and training facilities, and advocate health sector reforms at provincial level through (i) \nclinical training for specialists, health care managers, and trainers; (ii) upgrading or purchasing \nof  new  equipment;  (iii)  transforming  provincial  hospitals  into  local  teaching  institutions;  (iv) \nsupporting information and advocacy campaigns for health and family planning; and (v) support \nfor  regulatory  functions  and  quality  assurance  by  provincial  governments.  Under  the  guidance \nand  with  technical  support  of  MOH  and  BKKBN,  managerial  training  will  be  provided  covering \nquality  assurance  and  the  design  of  specific  health  care  reforms  such  as  social  health \ninsurance,  public-private  partnerships,  referral  systems,  and  coordination  of  drug  procurement \namong districts and provinces. They will disseminate policies and guidelines from the national \nGovernment and information about successful practices. In-country fellowships and comparative \nstudies will be offered to selected candidates. DHS2 funds will also be used to rehabilitate and \nprovide  equipment  and  vehicles.  Women  will  be  given  priority  to  participate  in  all  training \nactivities.  Activities  of  this  component  will  support  MOH's  policy  to  develop  a  local  pool  of \nqualified  health  professionals  by  using  provincial  hospitals  as  teaching  hospitals.  Capacity  of \nprovinces to regulate the health sector, oversee performance of district services, and ensure the \nimplementation  of  minimum  service  standards  and  the  reform  of  health  centers  will  be \n\nterms  of \n\nin \n\n\f  7\n\nstrengthened.  The  DHS2  funds  will  also  be  used  to  rehabilitate  and  provide  equipment  and \nvehicles for outreach activities. \n \n25. \nThe  third  component  will  support  MOH  and  BKKBN  to  change  from  a  command  and \ncontrol  leadership  role  to  new  functions  and  responsibilities  that  consist  of  consultation, \ncoordination,  provision  of  technical  assistance  to  regional  governments,  provision  of  essential \ndrugs  for  the  poor,  quality  assurance,  regulation  and  standardization,  policy  development  and \nreform,  and  resource  mobilization.  Activities  of  this  component  will  include  a  review  of  major \ntechnical curative and preventive approaches based on studies, action research and pilot tests   \naiming at health sector reforms that focus on maternal and child health, health services for the \npoor,  and  sustainable  delivery  of  PHC  services  in  a  decentralized  setting.  A  focal  point  of \nsupport  will  be  the  promotion  of  public  private  partnership  approaches  related  to  community-\nbased health services planning and delivery, health financing and insurance, and health sector \ninfrastructure12. The creation of a national partnership forum will facilitate the empowerment of \nprofessional associations, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and private service providers \nthrough selected human resource development activities. The DHS2 resources will also be used \nto  finance  the  development  of  generic  information,  education,  and  training  materials,  and  the \ndevelopment  of  a  competency-based  clinical  training  in  newly  created  provincial  teaching \nhospitals. In-country and overseas fellowships and comparative studies based on training needs \nassessments will help strengthen the capacity to analyze and respond to decentralization needs \nof  the  sector  and  to  design  and  implement  health  sector  reforms  that  will  give  priority  to  the \nreform  of  existing  health  centers,  which  particularly  cater  to  the  poor  segments  of  the \npopulation.  Activities  will  include  the  development  of  a  physical  infrastructure  for  knowledge-\nbased  and  user-friendly  management  information  systems.  Under  this  component,  the  DHS2 \nwill  help  BKKBN  cover  the  contraceptive  needs  of  the  poor  during  the  transition  period  of \ndecentralizing its services and until a sustainable financing mechanism has been developed for \nthe procurement of contraceptives. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n26. \nThe  DHS2  has  been  designed  to  support  decentralized  service  delivery,  like  its \npredecessor,  DHS1.  DHS2  has  established  full  ownership  by  regional  governments,  through \ntheir  detailed  subproject  proposals  and  their  substantial  budget  contributions.  The  DHS2  will \nallow  the  national  Government  to  specifically  address  shortcomings  of  service  provision  in \nindividual  regions  by  demanding  compliance  with  obligatory  functions  and  minimum  service \nstandards  when  approving  annual  plans  of  district/cities  for  funding  by  the  DHS2.  Due  to  the \nnumber  of  second-tier  governments  involved,  provincial  project  managers  will  consolidate \nannual  plans  before  submission  for  approval  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  Individual  district \nand  city  plans,  including  related  comments  from  district  and  city  health  committees,  will  be \nsubmitted for information to the Government and to ADB. \n \n27. \nLocal  leaders  and  health  professionals  will  be  supported  to  develop  the  capability  to \nadequately  identify  specific  health  needs  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  and  implement \nappropriate programs by applying a participatory approach that involves the beneficiaries. This \nimplies  a  priority  for  PHC  services  and  diseases  particularly  affecting  the  poor\u2014such  as \nmalaria, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, and malnutrition. PHC facilities most \nused by the poor will be strengthened, in particular health posts for village midwives, subhealth \ncenters, and health centers. Reform of health centers has been identified as a priority activity of \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB\u2019s ongoing advisory technical assistance 4094-INO: Public Health and Nutrition is expected to provide a tested \n\nmodel of public-private partnership for the health sector before loan effectiveness of DHS2. \n\n\f 8\n\nMOH under the DHS2. The DHS2 will help develop appropriate mechanisms to sustain pro-poor \nactivities  of  the  Social  Safety  Net  Program  under  the  authority  of  regional  governments, \nfollowing  the  priority  of  the  DHS2  to  support  maternal  and  child  health  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable groups. \n \n28. \nAs  most  of  the  districts  in  the  selected  provinces  will  participate,  the  DHS2  will  help \nstrengthen  coordination  and  cooperation  among  districts  and  provinces,  in  particular  for \nepidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases, for developing an effective \nreferral  system,  and  for  developing  capacity  in  the  provincial  hospitals  to  train  qualified \nprofessionals  that  will  work  in  the  region.  Dialogue  with  regional  governments  will  emphasize \nthe  benefits  of  involving  professional  associations,  local  universities,  the  private  sector,  and \nlocal NGOs in managing local health services. \n \n29. \nThe DHS2 advocates spending of 5% of the regional annual budget for the health sector \nby  the  end  of  the  DHS2  and  will  promote  an  integrated  approach  to  health  financing,  cross-\nsectoral coordination, public-private partnerships, monitoring of health service performance and \nof  health  status  indicators,  dissemination  of  information,  and  increased  transparency  and \naccountability.  The  DHS2  is  funding  the  implementation  and  dissemination  of  successful  pilot \nexperiments related to health sector reforms and the local adaptation of national guidelines. For \nexample,  the  DHS2  will  support  Bangka  Belitung  and  Gorontalo  provinces  to  develop  and \nimplement a social health insurance system.  \n \n30. \nParticularly  in  urban  areas,  individuals,  companies,  or  NGOs  provide  private  health \nservices  that  try  to  directly  respond  to  demand.  Partnerships  between  public  and  private \nproviders  can  improve  the  availability  of  health  services  for  all,  the  quality  of  health  services, \nand the increased efficiency in the allocation of resources. Such partnerships can improve the \neffectiveness of service delivery while mobilizing additional resources from those who can afford \nto  pay,  thus  allowing  an  increase  of  public  subsidies  for  the  poor.  The  DHS2  will  support  the \ndevelopment of public-private partnerships in health care delivery and financing, which will need \nto materialize in annual health plans of regional governments. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n31. \nThe total cost of the DHS2 is estimated at $143.0 million equivalent, including duties and \ntaxes. Of the total, $73.2 million (51%) is the foreign exchange cost and $69.8 million equivalent \n(49%)  represents  the  local  currency  costs.

The ordinary \ncapital resources loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility,13 a commitment charge \nof  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  (to  be  capitalized  in  the  loan),  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB. \nADB's Special Funds loan will have a 32-year term including a grace period of 8 years with an \ninterest charge of 1% per year during the grace period, and 1.5% per year during the remaining \nterm.  ADB  will  fund  100%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  totaling  49%  of  the  estimated  project \ncost,  and  38%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $43.0 \nmillion equivalent as counterpart financing, which accounts for 30% of total costs. This includes \nfinancing  civil  works,  in-country  training,  systems  development,  workshops,  materials  and \nconsumables, project managements, and taxes and duties.

MOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  DHS2.  BKKBN  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency for family planning and family welfare activities. The MOH secretary general will be the \nDHS2's  director.  The  senior  advisor  to  MOH  dealing  with  decentralization  will  be  the  deputy \ndirector  of  MOH  and  will  also  act  as  the  project  manager  of  MOH.  The  principal  secretary  of \nBKKBN will be deputy director of BKKBN. Both deputy directors will provide policy guidance and \nensure  coordination  with  other  projects  supporting  decentralization  in  each  of  their  respective \nareas.  The  director  of  program  and  policy  at  BKKBN  will  be  the  deputy  project  manager  of \nBKKBN. A national steering committee consisting, among others, of senior representatives from \nMOH, BKKBN, Ministry of Finance, National Development  Planning Agency, Ministry of Home \nAffairs, and State Ministry of Empowerment of Women will provide advice to the DHS2's director \non  general  policy  and  intersectoral  coordination.  A  national  technical  team  of  ministry  experts \nwill advise the deputy directors. A diagram of the project organization is in Appendix 5. \n \n34. \nThe head of the provincial health services will be the provincial project manager (PPM).  \nThe  PPM  will  be  assisted  by  the  provincial  PIU,  composed  of  a  full-time  executive  secretary, \nfinance  officer,  procurement  officer,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer,  who  will  coordinate \nproject  implementation  in  the  province  and  provide  technical  support  to  their  participating \ndistricts. The PPM will report to the provincial governor or the head of the provincial BAPPEDA. \nA  provincial  health  council  with  a  wide  representation  of  government  services,  professional \nassociations,  and  civil  society  will  be  established  to  advise  the  regional  project  directors  and \nensure  transparency  of  decision-making.  A  provincial  technical  review  team,  including \nrepresentatives from MOH and BKKBN, the private health sector, academics and professional \norganizations,  and  technical  experts  on  an  individual  basis  will  assist  the  provincial  PIU.    The \nprovincial  PIU  will  support  and  coordinate  district  and  city  implementation  units  (DIU).  A \nprovincial sub-PIU for BKKBN activities may be established as needed. \n \n35. \nAt the district and city level, a full-time district executive secretary will be responsible for \nimplementing the project activities, under the guidance of the chief of the district and city health \nservices  who  will  be  the  district  and  city  project  manager  (DPM).  The  DPM  will  report  to  the \nchief executive of the district and city. In each district and city, the chief executive of the district \nor  city  will  establish  a  district  health  committee  (DHC)  to  advise  the  DPM  and  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  DHS2  activities  in  accordance  with  the  district\u2019s  annual  plan  of  action.  The \nDHC  will  include  representatives  of  the  district  health  and  family  planning  services,  local \nparliament, private health sector, community leaders, women\u2019s organizations, NGOs, and other \nrepresentatives of civil society. \n \nBy 1 June of each year, beginning June 2004, the DHC, DPM and DIU will review and \n36. \nupdate the district and city proposal for assistance under DHS2 and transmit the district and city \nannual plan for the following year to the PPM, including the minutes of the DHC and the DPM's \nresponse to the recommendations of DHS. At the provincial level, the district proposals will be \nreviewed  by  the  provincial  health  council  and  the  provincial  technical  review  team  and \nconsolidated  on  a  province-wide  basis.    By  July  1  of  each  year,  the  PPM  will  transmit  the \nconsolidated  provincial  proposal  to  the  national  project  manager  and  deputy  project  directors, \nincluding  a  summary  of  the  issues  discussed  by  the  provincial  technical  review  team  and  the \nsolutions  proposed.    After  review  of  the  consolidated  provincial  proposals  by  the  national \ntechnical  team,  the  national  project  manager  and  deputy  project  directors  will  endorse  the \nprovincial proposals (as they may be amended) and submit them to ADB by 1 August of each \n\n\f  11\n\nyear for approval. Flexibility will be provided to adapt project activities to newly identified needs \nthat are in accordance with project objectives and comply with the Loan Agreements. \n \n37. \nThe  DHS2  will  provide  strong  support  for  project  management.  At  the  national  level,  a \ncentral PIU in MOH with a sub-unit in BKKBN will coordinate project implementation and provide \ntechnical  support  to  lower  level  implementation  units.  The  central  PIU  will  have  two  full-time \nexecutive  secretaries,  each  executive  secretary  being  responsible  for  four  participating \nprovinces  with  their  associated  participating  districts,  and  each  executive  secretary  will  be \nsupported by a finance officer, procurement officer, monitoring and evaluation officer, planning \nofficer and other staff as needed. The central PIU will have regular meetings with DHS1 and the \nWorld  Bank-supported  provincial  health  projects  to  ensure  coordination.  BKKBN  will  have  a \ncentral PIU sub-unit with a full-time executive secretary and support staff. A national technical \nadvisor reporting to the project manager of MOH and the deputy project director of BKKBN will \nbe  responsible  for  the  technical  quality  of  the  DHS2.  The  technical  advisor  will  ensure  that \nDHS2  objectives  are  being  met  and  that  the  Government\u2019s  policies  are  reflected  in  DHS2 \nactivities. Where possible, districts and provinces will be encouraged to use existing offices and \nstaff for implementation. Where capacity does not exist or requires strengthening, DHS2 funds \nwill be used to finance the services of contracted project management staff at district, province, \nand central levels for a limited period of time. As regional capacity increases over time due to \nproject  support,  regional  governments  will  progressively  replace  contracted  staff  with  regular \ncivil servants. The project administration costs are estimated at about 8% of the total base cost \nof the DHS2. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n38. \nProject  implementation  will  start  in  2004  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  30  June \n2010, with a loan utilization period closing on 31 December 2010. Initial project implementation \nactivities will emphasize information, advocacy, and local capacity building in health and family \nplanning. Subsequently, project activities will focus on a reorientation of technical approaches of \nthe  health  system;  physical  investments  identified  in  annual  subproject  proposals;  and \nimplementation  of  appropriate  health  sector  reforms  to  enhance  quality,  sustainability, \neffectiveness and cost-efficiency. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n39. \nADB-financed  goods,  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  of \nthe  need  for  maintaining  transparency  and  accountability  in  all  project  activities,  as  required \nunder ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. \n \nProcurement packages have been grouped into three categories: civil works, equipment \n40. \nand  vehicles,  and  material  and  consumables.  Civil  works  will  involve  construction  and \nrehabilitation  work.  For  civil  works,  international  competitive  bidding  will  apply  for  contracts \nestimated  above  the  equivalent  of  $2.0  million.  If  the  estimated  contract  value  is  less,  local \ncompetitive  bidding  will  apply.  When  civil  works  for  rehabilitating  village  health  facilities  or \nactivities  aimed  at  creating  a  healthy  environment  and  preventing  diseases  are  estimated  to \ncost $10,000 equivalent or less and may involve the participation of the communities, contracts \nmay  be  awarded  in  accordance  with  procedures  to  be  agreed  upon  between  the  DIU  and  the \ncommunity  concerned,  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  If  the  estimated  value  is \nless, international shopping procedures will apply. \n\n\f 12\n\nThe  bidding  documents  for  the  procurement  of  medical  equipment,  motorcycles,  and \n41. \nfour-wheel  drive  vehicles  will  be  consolidated  on  a  province-wide  basis.  Contracts  and \npayments for the consolidated procurements will remain the responsibility of each district, city, \nand province that is involved in a specific procurement.  Items of less than $100,000 equivalent \ncan be procured under direct purchase procedures. The proposed procurement procedures and \nindicative procurement packages are summarized in Appendix 7. \n \n42. \nAdvance action started in November 2003 using Government resources. Advance action \nincludes  recruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement  of  office  equipment  related  to  the \nestablishment  of  project  implementation  units  at  the  national  and  regional  levels.  Retroactive \nfinancing will apply for eligible activities starting after 21 October 2003.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n43. \nTo facilitate project implementation and management, essential staff for the PIUs will be \nengaged individually, and funded under the DHS2. Consultants will be recruited by the central \nPIUs  (MOH  and  BKKBN)  according  to  the  needs  of  MOH  and  BKKBN  and  on  request  of  the \nregions.    Consulting  services  are  grouped  into  the  following  areas  of  expertise:  project \nmanagement  (including  procurement  and  financial  management);  health  system  support \n(including  health  policy,  public-private  partnerships,  and  licensing);  health  planning  and \nfinancing (including health care financing and health insurance); human resources development \n(including  needs-based  hospital  training  and  nursing);  public  health  (including  maternal  and \nchild  health,  family  planning  and  reproductive  health,  and  communicable  disease  control); \ninformation,  communications  and  health  promotion;  civil  works  and  technology  including  ICT; \nand  social  and  environmental  issues  including  gender  strategy  and  poverty  interventions.  The \nconsultants will be engaged through one or more firms or individually, in agreement with ADB. \nThe  terms  of  reference  of  the  consultants  will  be  as  determined  by  agreement  between  ADB \nand MOH or BKKBN. The DHS2 will fund a total of 130 person-months of international and 388 \nperson-months  of  domestic  technical  consulting  services.  Indicative  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 8. \n \n44. \nAll  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  Quality  and  cost-based  selection  will  be  applied  for  the  recruitment  of  the \nconsulting firms. The consulting firms will be engaged within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n45. \nThe Government will disburse the proceeds of the loan and the corresponding counterpart \ncontributions necessary for financing project activities by budgetary transfers of funds earmarked \nfor  such  purpose,  in  accordance  with  decentralization  laws  22/1999  and  25/1999  and  the \nprevailing implementing regulations. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the Government will \nestablish an imprest account at Bank Indonesia to make payments in local currency for project \nimplementation. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  of  January  2001,  as  amended  from \ntime to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB.  The \ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of \n$2,000,000  for  each  loan.  The  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  for \nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  into  the  imprest \naccount, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements \nagreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.    Individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or \n\n\f  13\n\nliquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. Disbursement \nmechanisms and flow of funds, in particular at the regional level, will be further described in the \nproject administration manual, as a condition for loan effectiveness. \n \nAll districts and cities in the eight project provinces have been invited to participate in the \n46. \nDHS2.  Regional governments involved in the  DHS2  will contribute to the project costs in their \nregions according to a cost-sharing formula agreed with the national Government. No funds will \nbe disbursed to the regional governments for project activities if the formal commitment required \nby the central Government has not been signed. DHS2 activities, however, can start in regions \nwhose  governments  have  submitted  the  signed  budget  commitment  and  when  the  other \nconditions for loan effectiveness have been fulfilled. \n \nNo disbursement of loan proceeds will be made to a participating region (district, city, or \n47. \nprovince)  (i)  if  a  misprocurement  happened  or  other  procurement  action  in  the  participating \nregion has been identified as irregular, until the misprocurement or other irregularity has been \ncorrected  by  the  concerned  region  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Government  and  ADB;  (ii)  until  a \nDIU  or  provincial  PIU,  as  applicable,  has  been  established;  and  (iii)  until  the  region\u2019s  annual \nplan of activities has been approved by ADB. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n48. \nDistricts  and  cities,  provinces,  MOH,  and  BKKBN  will  maintain  a  separate  accounting \nsystem  for  project  expenditures  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  project \naccounts, including financial statements, statements of expenditures, and account records will be \naudited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB, as part of the regular audit accounts and financial \nstatements. District accounts will be audited by auditors acceptable to ADB and consolidated at \nthe provincial level.  The consolidated annual audit reports in English\u2014one for each province, one \nfor  MOH  activities  at  the  central  level,  and  one  for  BKKBN  activities\u2014will  be  submitted  to  ADB \nwithin  9  months  after  the  end  of  the  Government's  fiscal  year.  The  Government,  districts,  and \nprovinces  have  been  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  financial  statements \n(AFS). Funds may be suspended for a district or province that does not submit its AFS within  9 \nmonths  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  Reminders  will  be  issued  if  AFS  are  overdue,  and \ndisbursements  of  funds  will  be  suspended  for  districts  or  provinces  where  AFS  are  9  months \noverdue. \n \n49. \nThe central PIU in MOH and the subunit in BKKBN will submit to ADB, within 60 days after \nthe end  of each calendar quarter, consolidated  progress reports on the  DHS2 in a form agreed \nupon by the Government and ADB.  \n \n50. \nThe Government will coordinate and cooperate with ADB in reviewing the DHS2 and, in \nthis  connection,  will  submit  to  ADB  documents  and  reports  that  may  be  required.  Within  3 \nmonths  after  the  loan  closing  date,  the  provinces  and  the  Government  will  submit  a  project \ncompletion report to ADB, in such form and detail as ADB may request. \n \n\n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51. \nA list of performance indicators to be achieved by 2010 is in appendixes 1 and 9. Before \nloan  effectiveness,  MOH  and  BKKBN  will  develop  guidelines  for  implementing  a  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS), including poverty and gender disaggregated data, for \nuse at the national level in training and capacity-building activities. Each province will develop a \nPPMS for local activities based on the project framework and the national model, and attach it to \n\n\f 14\n\nits  first  annual  plan  of  activities.  Consultants  will  provide  technical  support  to  strengthen  local \nmonitoring capacity and ensure the appropriate use of the baseline data collected during project \npreparation. Indicators, targets, and mechanisms for collecting data will be publicized as soon \nas possible on the Internet. Project-related information, including data on project performance, \navailable via the Internet, will be updated at least every semester. The regional PIUs will ensure \nthat local NGOs are informed about and have access to this information. Benchmark and new \nannual  data  will  be  used  to  support  the  annual  review  and  update  of  regional  governments\u2019 \nproposals for funding by the DHS2. \n \n52. \nThe community will actively participate in project monitoring through the DHC. The DHC \nwill  meet  at  least  twice  a  year  to  review  project  implementation  and  the  project  annual  plans. \nThe DHS2 will make appropriate recommendations to the district project manager to modify, if \nnecessary,  the  plan  of  action  for  the  following  year.  The  recommendations  of  the DHC  will  be \nsent to MOH and BKKBN with appropriate comments of the district project manager, explaining \nhis or her response to the recommendations of the DHC. The DHC's recommendations and the \ncomments  of  the  district  project  manager  will  be  sent  to  ADB  by  MOH's  central  PIU  as  an \nattachment to the next consolidated quarterly report. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  conduct  a  project  review  every  6  months  after  loan \n53. \neffectiveness  and  a  midterm  review  upon  completion  of  the  third  year  of  implementation,  to \nassess progress and achievements against the objectives, identify any problems encountered, \nand recommend remedial measures or changes, if required. The findings of the midterm review \nwill be discussed at provincial and national workshops to be attended by the health and family \nplanning officers, representatives of the agencies involved in the DHS2, and ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n54. \nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries. The DHS2 will improve health services in districts \nand cities in the 8 selected project provinces. The outcome will be a better health status of the \nconcerned population at large and of poor and vulnerable groups in particular. DHS2 activities \ngive  priority  to  common  health  problems  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  child \nmalnutrition,  child  and  infant  mortality,  and  maternal  mortality.  About  2  million  women  and  2 \nmillion men will benefit from the DHS2, with 9%\u201332% of them below the poverty line. Because \nof the priority given to mother and child health care, women will benefit disproportionately from \nthe DHS2. An estimated 180,000 infant girls will benefit from the DHS2 as part of 1.51 million \nunder-five girls (315,000 of them considered to be poor).  \n \n55. \nSocial and Poverty Analysis. In general, health services and facilities at village health \nposts,  mobile  health  centers,  village  midwives,  health  centers  cater  to  the  poor.  Poor  people \nalso  use  traditional  healers  and  private  health  services  providers  because  access  to  quality \nhealth  services  is  often  inadequate.  In  remote  rural  areas,  health  service  facilities  are  often \nbeyond the reach of the poor due to transport and high opportunity costs, or health services are \noften of low quality because of the difficulty to retain qualified health personnel in remote areas. \nThe poor often cannot afford private health services except from NGOs, and the relatively low \nquality  and  ineffectiveness  of  the  public  health  sector  particularly  affect  their  health  status. \nSocial and poverty issues are analyzed in detail in appendixes 10 and 11. \n\n \n56. \nIll  health  is the  single most  common  trigger  for  the  deterioration  of  the  quality  of  life  of \npoor and vulnerable groups. Illness reduces household savings, lowers learning ability, reduces \n\n\f  15\n\nproductivity, and leads to a diminished quality of life, thereby creating or perpetuating poverty. \nCompared with the general population, the poor and vulnerable groups are exposed to greater \npersonal and environmental risks, are less well nourished, have less access to information, and \nare less able to access health care.  \n \n57. \nVulnerable  groups  include  indigenous  peoples.  The  executing  and  implementing \nagencies  will  ensure  that  project  activities  have  a  positive  impact  on  indigenous  peoples.  To \nensure  that  indigenous  peoples  benefit  from  the  DHS2,  the  following  measures  have  been \ndeveloped: (i) district health plans include an assessment of the needs of indigenous peoples; \n(ii) constraints on indigenous peoples\u2019 participation in and/or benefiting from project activities will \nbe addressed; (iii) community participation in the implementation of project activities will include \nindigenous  peoples  where  relevant;  and  (iv)  monitoring  mechanism  include  the  impact  of  the \nDHS2  on  indigenous  peoples.  If  civil  works  require  resettlement,  a  resettlement  plan  will  be \nprepared, in accordance with the resettlement framework (supplementary appendix B). \n\n \n58. \nAccess to health care is a top priority for women and their families, as women tend to be \nresponsible for the care of the young, the sick, and the elderly. Thus, women\u2019s access to health \ncare  extends  beyond  the  welfare  of  the  individual  to  that  of  the  family  as  a  whole.  Women  in \nrural  areas  will  benefit  from  several  project  activities,  in  particular  the  upgrading  of  PHC  and \nfamily  planning  services,  strengthening  of  safe  motherhood  activities,  improvement  of  training \ninstitutions  for  nurses  and  midwives,  and  development  of  disease  prevention  programs. \nWomen's groups will help women learn about health issues and support each other in case of \ndisease.  Gender  sensitive  planning  and  budgeting  will  be  promoted  at  the  district  level,  sex-\ndisaggregated data on the health status of the population will be collected, and participation of \nwomen in managerial training will be supported. The DHS2 will promote increased numbers of \nfemale  health  staff  by  encouraging  enrollment  of  women  in  staff  development  and  training \nactivities  sponsored  by  the  DHS2  and  setting  the  target  of  a  50%  participation  rate.  Other \nspecific measures addressing gender issues are presented in the gender action plan prepared \nfor the DHS2 (supplementary appendix C). \n \n59. \nEnvironment.  The  DHS2  will  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  health  facilities  in  the  project \narea,  such  as  hospitals,  health  centers,  subhealth  centers,  and  village  health  posts.  An  initial \nenvironmental assessment for project activities has been completed during project preparation. \nThe  necessary  measures  will  be  taken  to  minimize  environmental  impacts.  Hospital  waste \nmanagement  will  become  part  of  the  capacity-building  program.  A  summary  is  attached  in \nAppendix 12. All civil works will be undertaken considering minimal damage to the environment. \n \n60. \nEconomic  and  Financial  Analysis.  While  the  DHS2  is  expected  to  yield  several \nbenefits,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  using  a  conservative  estimate  of \nthe benefits of improved health of the population in the project provinces through improved use \nand  quality  of  health  services  at  the  district  level.    These  conservative  estimates  yield  a \ncomposite economic internal rate of return of 37%, with rates ranging from 21.5% in East Nusa \nTenggara to 50.2% in South Sumatra. A detailed economic and financial analysis is in Appendix \n13. \n \n61. \nThe  DHS2  is  primarily  expected  to  reduce  the  burden  of  disease,  measured  by  the \nreduction  in  disability-adjusted  life  years  (DALYs)  lost  due  to  death  and  disability.    Project \nbenefits  have  been  estimated  in  terms  of  reduction  of  the  gap  in  DALY  between  the  project \nprovinces  and  developed  countries,  multiplied  by  the  2002  per  capita  provincial  minimum \n\n\f 16\n\nwages.    Data  derived  from  the  1993  World  Development  Report14  indicates  that  the  gap  in \nDALY between non-Indian and Chinese Asian countries and established market economies was \nabout  143  per  1000  population.    The  gap  in  DALY  is  estimated  by  disaggregating  the  major \ndisease  categories,  using  relatively  recent  (1995)  burden  of  disease  data  on  previous  health \nprojects. The value of DALY saved in each province is the monetary value of the minimum wage \nlevels in the province.15  For DHS2, the maximum benefit effect assumes a reduction of the gap \nby 7.4 DALYs per 1000 population. \n \nThe  total  financial  cost  of  the  DHS2,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  contingencies,  and \n62. \ninterest charges, is $143 million for a period of 6 years.  The DHS2 will provide funds to districts \nand  provinces  to  support  development  spending  to  achieve  increased  health  outcomes. \nFinancial  rates  of  return  are  not  calculated  since  cost  recovery  is  not  a  factor  in  the  project \ndesign.  Hence,  fiscal  impact  analysis  was  done  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the \nGovernment  budget.    There  is  a  wide  variation  both  within  and  across  provinces  in  health \nspending.    In  most  districts,  the  levels  of  health  spending  are  about  1\u20132%  of  the  local  district \nbudget expenditures. \n \n63. \nBased  on  project  disbursements,  projections  were  made  to  assess  the  annual  district \nhealth  expenditure  as  a  result  of  the  incremental  project  investment  so  that  the  respective \ngovernment  is  presented  with  clear  funding  commitment.    With  the  DHS2,  total  district  health \nexpenditure  will  average  about  2%  of  local  expenditures  during  the  project  period.  This  is \nconsidered to have minimal impact on local budgetary resources.  To make a substantial impact \non key health indicators, however, a substantial increase in health spending will be required.  To \navoid a sharp drop in spending by 2011, government health spending would have to increase \nduring  project  implementation  in  order  to  sustain  and  deepen  project  benefits.    Although  the \ncosts  of  health  system  reforms  are  one-time  costs,  local  government  commitment  will  have  to \nbe obtained to ensure sustainability of the health reforms and to maintain the improved public \nhealth  facilities.    Increased  levels  of  health  spending  at  the  district  and  city  level  could  be \nachieved  through  cross-subsidies  between  better-off  and  poor  areas,  increased  budgetary \ntransfers  from  central  Government,  and  other  resource  mobilization  mechanisms  (e.g., \ncommunity mobilization and public-private-partnerships). \n\n \nRisks  and  Assumptions.  With  the  participation  of  98  regional  governments  and  new \n64. \ndecentralized  planning  and  budgeting  mechanisms  set  up  at  subnational  levels,  project \nadministration will be challenging.  Leadership at the national level may not be strong enough to \nprovide  necessary  regulatory  guidance  and  technical  support.  DHS2  funds  will  therefore  be \nused to contract qualified management staff to compensate for shortcomings in the provision of \nqualified  staff  at  all  levels  of  government.  The  DHS2  will  also  make  the  best  possible  use  of \ninformation and communication technology for supervision, monitoring, and distance support. \n  \nIncreased  local  autonomy  over  resource  allocation  may  follow  short-term  political \n65. \nincentives, for example high profile support for hospital services. Project activities will facilitate \npolicy dialogue with regional governments to advocate investment in the health sector aiming at \nan allocation of least 5% of the regional annual budget for health by the end of the DHS2. Each \nregion  will  establish  a  midterm  target  that  will  become  part  of  the  PPMS.  All  capacity-building \nand  advocacy  activities  of  the  DHS2  strongly  emphasize  more  cost-efficient  allocations  of \nresources and the needs of the poor. \n\n                                                 \n14  World Bank. 1993. World Development Report. Washington DC. \n15 Central Bureau of Statistics. 2002. National Socioeconomic Survey.

Nearly 600,000 new cases occur each year, amounting to \n280 new cases per 100,000 people, including 126 smear positive pulmonary cases per 100,000. \nEstimates  show  that  only  20%  of  pulmonary  tuberculosis  is  detected.  Of  those  detected  with \ntuberculosis, an estimated 87% were successfully treated.6 \n \n More than 50% of the population lives in malaria-free areas where transmission does not \n7. \nexist or occurs only sporadically. Malaria is a health problem in forest areas of the outer islands, \nparticularly in the eastern provinces, where 50% of the cases are plasmodium falciparum. More \nthan 1.5 million clinical cases are reported outside Java annually. Malaria control activities are \nintegrated  with  the  general  health  services.  Overall  responsibility  for  implementing  malaria \ncontrol  activities  lies  with  district  governments.  Passive  case  detection,  clinical  diagnosis  and \ntreatment,  active  case  detection  and  laboratory  diagnosis  are  limited  to  the  Java-Bali  area. \nMalaria  cases  are  treated  at  health  centers,  private  practices,  and  malaria  treatment  posts  of \nvolunteers in the rural areas. The spread of drug resistance, a lack of resources, and a lack of \nintersector collaboration and trained professional staff are some of the major issues. \n \n8. \n The population at risk of malaria is around 100 million (46.2% of the population). Based \non the malaria incidence, Indonesia is divided into two regions, Java and Bali, with 70% of the \ntotal  Indonesian  population,  where  malaria  is  hypoendemic,  and  the  other  sparsely  populated \nislands where malaria is at much higher levels. More than 3.3 million clinical cases of malaria \nwere reported in 1998 by government health centers and hospitals. As only 20% of sick people \ngo to the government facilities, an estimated 15 million malaria cases probably occur annually. \nThe loss of individual income from malaria is estimated at $56.5 million per year, not including \nthe loss from tourism and foregone business investment in malaria endemic areas.  \n\n                                                \n \n5  WHO. 2002.

Washington DC. \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAn  expanded  program  on  immunization  had  been  implemented  since  1978,  and  the \n9. \ncoverage increased rapidly. Indonesia achieved the universal child immunization level by 1990 \nat  the  national  level  and  in  all  provinces  in  1994,  but  only  around  65%  districts  achieved  that \nlevel  by  1997.  Despite  a  \"universal\"  level  of  immunization  nationwide,  vaccine  preventable \ndiseases still occurred in several areas. Recently, a more sensitive indicator called \u201cproportion \nof high risk villages\u201d was introduced to define the intensive program intervention areas (high-risk \narea approach). \n \nThe  epidemiological  transition  places  a  double  burden  on  the  health  system:  while \n10. \ncommunicable  diseases  remain  major  public  health  issues,  non-communicable  diseases  are \nincreasing  (e.g.,  over  40%  of  outpatient  cases  at  the  health  center  level  are  there  for \nhypertension, asthma, etc). Smoking is a major contributor to these diseases but there is little \npolitical  will  to  develop  strategies  to  counter  the  trend.  Degenerative  and  non-contagious \ndiseases also show a rising trend.  The results of the National Household Health Survey of 1995 \nshow that 83 persons per 1,000 people suffer from hypertension, and 2 to 3 persons per 1,000 \npeople from ischemic heart disease and stroke.  Emotional disturbances among people aged 5\u2013\n14 years old and above 15 are 104 and 140 per 1,000 people, respectively.  Blindness is rising \nsignificantly, from 1.0% in 1982 to 1.47% in 1995.  Mortality due to traffic accidents increased \nfrom 3.2 per 100,000 people in 1994 to 4.1 per 100,000 people in 1997. \n \nThe  prevalence  of  moderate  and  severe  protein  energy  malnutrition  among  children \n11. \nunder  5  years  had  dropped  from  18.9%  in  1978  to  14.6%  in  1995.    The  total  prevalence  of \nprotein energy malnutrition decreased from 48.2% in 1978 to 35.0% in 1995.  So did the other \nnutritional  problems  decline,  such  as  blindness  due  to  vitamin  A  deficiency,  iron  deficiency \nanemia,  and  iodine  deficiency.  A  1992  survey  concluded  that  blindness  due  to  vitamin  A \ndeficiency  was  no  longer  a  community  health  problem.  The  National  Socioeconomic  Survey \ndisclosed that the prevalence of pregnant women suffering from iron deficiency had decreased \nfrom  63.5%  in  1992  to  50.5%  in  1995.    Among  the  preschool-age  group,  iron  deficiency  went \ndown  from  55.5%  to  40.5%.    Iodine  deficiency  disease  declined  because  80%  of  households \nused iodized salt.  \n \n12. \nThe  issue  of  malnutrition,  however,  needs  to  be  further  discussed  in  the  light  of  the \naftermath of 1997 economic crisis and the start of the decentralization process in 2001, as its \ntransition  period  had  upset  distribution  programs.  Groups  at  highest  risk  are  children  5\u201312 \nmonths. Maternal malnutrition and anemia are concerns for over 50% children 5\u201314 and women \nof  reproductive  age.  The  National  Socio-economic  Survey  (Susenas)  2001  showed  that \nprevalence of stunting under-five is 34.3%, wasting under-five is 16.6%, under-five children with \nanemia is 47.8%. These programs will need to be strengthened at the local levels.   \n \nC. \n\nAccuracy of the Health Data \n \n13. \nInformation and data collected about the Indonesia health sector are of varying degrees \nof accuracy and validity.

Poverty as measured by \nthe head count index had fallen from a high level of above 40% in 1976 to about 15% before the \ncrisis  in  mid-1997.  High  prices  for  staple  food  and  basic  commodities  as  result  of  the  crisis \nincreased poverty levels to 33% in November 1998. In 2001, the national average percentage of \npoor was 16% but differed widely among provinces, from below 10% in South Kalimantan and \nthe  new  province  of  Bangka  Belitung  to  approximately  40%  in  NTT  and  the  new  province  of \nGorontalo. Poverty is substantially higher in rural areas of all provinces. Table A11 shows the \npoverty rate of provinces that will participate in the Project.  \n \n\nTable A11: Poverty Rate by Province (percentage of population) \n\n \nProvince \nBangka Belitung \nCentral Kalimantan \nEast Nusa Tenggara \nGorontalo \nSouth Kalimantan \nSouth Sulawesi \nSouth Sumatra \nWest Nusa Tenggara \n\n1996 \nTotal \n\u2013 \n13.50 \n38.89 \n\u2013 \n8.53 \n16.71 \n15.89 \n31.97 \n\nUrban \n\u2013 \n5.64 \n29.20 \n\u2013 \n10.41 \n18.26 \n23.99 \n31.93 \n\n1999 \nRural \n\u2013 \n18.54 \n49.39 \n\u2013 \n16.16 \n18.35 \n23.32 \n33.21 \n\nTotal \n\u2013 \n15.06 \n46.73 \n\u2013 \n14.37 \n18.32 \n23.53 \n32.96 \n\nUrban \n7.90 \n4.82 \n21.64 \n23.66 \n6.46 \n10.25 \n16.25 \n24.75 \n\n2001 \nRural \n8.25 \n18.03 \n43.54 \n45.56 \n9.01 \n16.87 \n18.33 \n24.21 \n\nTotal \n8.10 \n14.40 \n40.15 \n39.97 \n8.12 \n14.95 \n17.62 \n24.40 \n\n\u2013 = not available. \nSource: 2001. National Socioeconomic Survey. \n \n2. \nPoor  people  are  unable  to  meet  their  minimum  nutritional  requirements  and  tend  to \nsuffer from low educational attainment and insufficient skills. Consequently, they may be able to \nfind only impermanent work that provides low and uncertain wages in the informal sector. Most \nof  the  poor  do  not  have  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and  services  like  adequate  shelter  and \nsanitation  and  safe  water.  The  poor  have  only  very  limited  access  to  comprehensive  health \ncare,  use  the  services  of  health  centers  for  maternal  and  child  care  infrequently,  and  bear  a \ndisproportionate burden of health costs in relation to their spending capacity.   \n \n3. \nVillage  health  posts,  health  centers,  mobile  health  centers,  village  midwives,  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) generally cater to the needs of the poor. District hospitals \nare obliged by law to provide 25% of services free of costs for the poor who are in possession of \nhealth  cards  (surat  miskin),  issued  by  the  administration  to  certify  the  poverty  status.  But  in \nmany rural areas health service facilities are outside the reach of the poor and are often of low \nquality. Access remains an issue for poor people and their health expenditures consist of out-of-\npocket payments.  \n \n4. \nAs  the  poor  cannot  afford  private  health  services,  except  from  NGOs,  low  quality  and \nlimited access to public health services affect their health. Child malnutrition rates in Indonesia \nare  high  (i.e.,  8.74%  are  mildly  malnourished  and  0.61%  of  the  population  are  severely \nmalnourished)1 and malnutrition remains a serious problem  for vulnerable groups. Malnutrition \nrates among children from poorer households are still well above those of other segments of the \npopulation. The 2001 survey (footnote 1) showed that the prevalence of stunting under 5 years \nof age is 34.3%, wasting is 16.6%, and anemia is 47.8% for the same age group. \n\n                                                 \n1 Central Bureau of Statistics. 2001.

Jakarta. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n Appendix 9   \n\n39\n\n \n5. \nUse  of  health  services  in  a  timely  and  efficient  way  depends  on  the  knowledge  and \nawareness of  households  about  available  health  services  and  determines  their  health  seeking \nbehavior.  The  level  of  education  of  mothers  affects  the  demand  for  primary  health  care, \nincluding  maternal  and  childcare.  Although  literacy  and  years  of  schooling  have  generally \nincreased  during  the  past  3  decades,  access  to  health  services  is  still  difficult  for  many  rural \npeople  due  to  transport  problems.  The  average  distance  to  a  health  care  facility  was  5 \nkilometers  in  2002.  The  subdistrict  level  health  center  is  the  most  accessible  health  service \nfacility for the population at large, followed by private physicians, other private health providers \nlike  traditional  birth  attendants  and  healers,  auxiliary  subdistrict  health  centers,  and  village\u2013\nowned comprehensive health posts.  \n \nB. \n\nParticipation Strategies \n\nGender Analysis  \n\n6. \nStrategies to promote participation of communities and nongovernment organizations in \nthe  Second  Decentralized  Health  Services  Project  (DHS2)  activities  are  focusing  on  regional \nhealth committees that will ensure participation (i) in the preparation of annual plans and in the \nimplementation  of  Project  activities;  (ii)  activities  related  to  supervision,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation of DHS2 activities; and (iii) in licensing and accreditation of services and personnel. \nTechnical  assistance  provided  by  the  DHS2  will  promote  these  participation  strategies  and \nadvocate institutionalization of participatory implementation mechanisms of the DHS2. \n \nC. \n \nWomen\u2019s access to health care is important to their direct health care needs and those \n7. \nof  their  family,  as  women  tend  to  be  responsible  for  the  care  of  the  young,  the  sick,  and  the \nelderly.  Thus,  women\u2019s  access  to  health  care  extends  beyond  the  welfare  of  the  individual  to \nthat of the family as a whole. Maternal mortality is a major issue in Indonesia, with a maternal \nmortality ratio estimated at 390 women\u2019s deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal morbidity also \nis  significant,  with  an  estimated  55.5%  of  pregnant  women  suffering  from  anemia.  Family \nplanning  gives  women  greater  control  over  their  destiny.  While  the  crisis  did  not  result  in  an \noverall  decline  of  the  contraceptive  prevalence  rate,  reversals  were  experienced  in  the  DHS2 \nprovinces.  \n  \n8. \nThe  DHS2  is  particularly  targeting  female  infants,  girls  under  5  years  of  age,  teen-age \ngirls  and  mothers,  pregnant  women,  postmenopausal  women  that  have  special  health  needs \ncaused  by  the  menopausal  syndrome,  and  elderly  women  suffering  from  diseases  like \nosteoporosis,  nutrition  problems,  and  cancer.  Women  in  rural  areas  will  benefit  from  several \nDHS2 activities, in particular the upgrading of primary health services; the implementation of the \nsafe  motherhood  program;  expansion  of  the  \"making  pregnancy  safer\"  program;  the \nimprovement  of  training  institutions  for  nurses,  and  midwives;  the  development  of  health \nprevention and promotion programs; and information, education, and communication for health \nand  family  planning.  Groups  of  poor  women  belonging  to  the  Family  Planning  Association  will \nreceive  financial  assistance  from  the  DHS2  in  the  form  of  seed  money  for  income-generating \nactivities.  Women  will  be  trained  as  facilitators  to  pass  on  messages  on  improved  health \npractices  at  the  community  level  in  poor  areas.  Traditional  female  birth  attendants  will  be \ntargeted  for  training  in  health  promotion  and  nutrition  activities,  facilitating  their  new  role  as \nassistants to village midwives. \n \n\nD. \n\nGender Strategy  \n\n\f40\n\nAppendix 10 \n\nA gender strategy has been developed for DHS2 (Supplementary Appendix A presents \n9. \nthe  full  strategy).  The  basic  principles  applied  in  the  DHS2  regarding  gender  sensitive \nmechanisms are (i) equal project benefits and opportunity sharing between women and men; (ii) \nreduction of gender inequalities in the project areas by ensuring equal participation for women \nand  men  in  project  activities;  (iii)  a  targeted  approach  for  very  poor  women;  (iv)  collection  of \ngender-disaggregated data included in the benefit monitoring and evaluation; (v) increase of the \nnumber of female trainers and health professionals and female participation of at least 50% in \nall categories of training funded by the DHS2; and (vi) promotion of representation of women in \ndecision-making bodies at all levels. \n \n10. \nThe  DHS2  will  introduce  the  concept  of  health  planning  needs  being  based  on  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  and  on  monitoring  indicators  that  are  gender  sensitive.  The  DHS2  will \nreview  data  collection  methodologies  and  revise  them  accordingly.  Health  personnel  will  be \ntrained in understanding the importance of gender for improved health services.  \n \n11. \nDHS2 capacity-building activities at the district and city level will include the following: (i) \ndata  collection  and  monitoring  formats  will  be  reviewed  and  revised  to  ensure  data  is  sex-\ndisaggregated  and  monitoring  indicators  are  gender  sensitive;  (ii)  a  50%  target  will  be  set  for \nwomen\u2019s participation in clinical and managerial skills training; (iii) regional governments will be \nencouraged  to  select  women  for  managerial  and  administrative  positions;  (iv)  women  will  be \nselected by the DHS2 as trainers and facilitators; (v) female cadres will be specifically trained to \ndisseminate family planning methods in poor neighborhoods; and (vi) traditional birth attendants \nwill  be  trained  to  actively  support  village  midwives  in  identifying  high-risk  cases  and  promote \nbreast feeding and nutrition programs during pregnancy.  \n \n12.  Women will be involved in the identification of health needs, and women\u2019s groups will be \nrecruited to help in health promotion activities and data collection. Women's groups will also be \ninvolved  in  monitoring  implementation  of  the  DHS2  at  the  district  level.  Specific  targeted \ninterventions will be identified during implementation of the DHS2 by the gender consultant. The \ngender  consultant  will  identify  additional  context-specific  gender  issues  at  the  local  level  and \nfacilitate  the  implementation  of  the  gender  strategy.  The  gender  consultant  will  also  identify \nspecific gender sensitive indicators. \n \nE. \n \n13. \nIndigenous peoples are not likely to be adversely or significantly affected by the DHS2. \nOn the contrary, specific mechanisms have been included in the project design to ensure that \nindigenous  peoples  will  benefit  from  the  DHS2.  The  DHS2  will  ensure  that  (i)  district  health \nplans include an assessment of the needs of indigenous peoples, (ii) constraints for indigenous \npeoples\u2019  participation  in  benefiting  from  project  activities  will  be  addressed,  (iii)  community \nparticipation  in  implementation  of  project  activities  will  include  indigenous  peoples  where \nrelevant, and (iv) monitoring mechanism include impact of the DHS2 on indigenous peoples.  \n \nF. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\nResettlement \n\nThe DHS2 may include rehabilitation and/or construction of health posts for village \n\n14. \nmidwives, health centers, and district hospitals in selected districts. It is highly unlikely that the \nrehabilitation of health posts and health centers will require any land acquisition. Nevertheless, \na resettlement framework has been prepared (Supplementary Appendix B), to regulate \ncompensation and procedures in accordance with Government regulations and the Involuntary \nResettlement Policy of Asian Development Bank.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n Appendix 11   \n\n41\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT REPORT FORM \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social Analysis  \n\nIdentification of poor and vulnerable groups  \n\n \nA. \n \nNumber of poor and vulnerable groups (women/men) expected to benefit from the intervention:  \n \nNumber  of  poor:1  The  total  estimated  number  of  poor  females  to  benefit  from  the  Second  Decentralized  Health \nServices Project (DHS2) will be 1.990 million and poor males 1.969, by the end of the fifth year of the DHS2. The \npoor  are  defined  according  to  the  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  poverty  line.  They  will  be  identified  for  targeting \naccording  to  the  National  Family  Planning  Coordinating  Board  (BKKBN)  criteria  for  identifying  the  pre-prosperous \nhouseholds, as applied for Social Safety Net Progam\u2013Health.  This process will be supported by advocacy activities \nat  the  district  level  to  ensure  improved  participatory  mechanisms  for  identifying  the  poor  and  providing  improved \naccess to health care and family planning services.    \n \nNumber  vulnerable  to  poverty: The  population  vulnerable  to  poverty  in  the  eight  project  provinces  that  will  benefit \nfrom  the  DHS2  will  be  approximately  2.4  million  females  and  2.2  million  males  by  the  fifth  year  of  the  DHS2, \nassuming that the maximum benefit flows and maximum district participation will occur by that time.  Vulnerability to \npoverty is defined as the proportion of the population that is expected to have high variance and low expected and \npresent consumption (SMERU 2001). \n \n \n \nB. \n \nPoor women and men will benefit from the project by improved availability and quality of maternal and child health, \nante- and pre-natal programs, quality of delivery care, programs to assist better care-seeking behavior, and control \nof communicable and childhood illnesses.  \n \nStrategies  to  ensure  that  the  needs  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  are  addressed  include  participatory  health \nplanning focusing on improved access for the poor to health facilities and on improved quality of services.   \n \nPoor and vulnerable groups will be involved in planning and priority setting regarding monitoring and evaluation and \nregarding customer satisfaction and quality assurance surveys.  \n  \n \nC. \n \n Participatory methods have been applied to identify needs of the poor and underserved through focus groups, rapid \nappraisals, and surveys. \n  \nPeriodic  surveys  will  be  conducted  to  determine  the  flow  of  benefits  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  awareness  of \navailability  of  services  among  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  and  assessments  of  changes  in  care  seeking  and  health \nseeking behavior.                \n \nD.        Gender \n \nSummary  of  Gender  Analysis:  Females  and  males  are  expected  to  benefit  and  participate  in  equal  proportion.  \nSpecial  gender  concerns  relate  to  the  health  needs  of  would-be  and  recent  mothers  and  the  special  issue  of \nmaternal mortality.  Maternal mortality is high in Indonesia compared with other East Asian countries. The burden of \ndisease  impacts  females  disproportionately,  as  seen  in  the  total  disability-adjusted  life  years  lost  due  to  morbidity \nand mortality.  Services in maternal and child health will be an important focus of the DHS2.  Training initiatives of \nthe  DHS2  are  designed  for  women  to  be  50%  of  the  participants.  Sex-disaggregated  data  will  be  developed  to \nensure that health planning is gender responsive. Training in understanding gender aspects and the importance for \nimproved  health  services  will  be  introduced  as  well.    A  gender  strategy  has  been  prepared  for  the  DHS2 \n(Supplementary Appendix A).  \n\nParticipation Process \n\n1  The  provincial  poverty  ratio  (headcount  poverty)  for  2001  is  estimated  using  National  Socioeconomic  Survey \n(Susenas) and Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) poverty line for 1999 inflated using price index supplied by BPS \nand  applying  it  to  the  estimated  provincial  population.  The  Second  Decentralized  Health  Services  Project  is \nassumed to reach a maximum of 75% of the poor in each province, a conservative estimate, when the full effect of \nthe project invests is obtained by years 5\u20136. The male and female ratios are obtained by using provincial sex ratios \nfrom 2001 Susenas. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\nPotential Issues \n\n \n\nIssues to be \naddressed \nYes/No \n\n \n \n\nResettlement \n\nPossibly \n\n \n  \nIndigenous People \n\nUncertain \n\n42\n\n \nE. \n  \n\n \n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nA resettlement framework has been prepared.

The  following  potential \nenvironmental, health, safety, and social impacts of the DHS2 were analyzed: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe comprehensiveness of the waste management plans, including handling and \ndisposal of medical and biohazardous waste; \nLiquid waste and sewage disposal; \n\n(ii) \n(iii)  Management of construction impacts over the planned building period (sediment \n\nand erosion control, emissions, noise, traffic, worker health and safety); \nHygiene and implementation of good hospital management practices; and \nEmployee\u2019s health and safety training. \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n \nB. \n\nBrief Description of the Project \n\n2. \nThe  project  objective  is  to  improve  the  health  and  family  planning  status  of  the \npopulation,  especially  of  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  in  8  provinces:  Bangka-Belitung,  Central \nKalimantan,  East  Nusa  Tenggara,  Gorontalo,  South  Kalimantan,  South  Sulawesi,  South \nSumatra, and West Nusa Tenggara. The DHS2 will contribute to (i) improving, supporting, and \nstrengthening  the  local  capacity  of  health  and  family  planning  service  delivery;  (ii)  planning, \nbudgeting, managing, financing, and ensuring of access to equitable services for the poor and \nvulnerable;  (iii)  improving  of  the  efficiency,  effectiveness  and  quality  of  health  and  family \nplanning services; (iv) improved knowledge, attitudes, practices, performance, and productivity \nof health professionals; and (v) improved participation of the community, including the poor and \nvulnerable groups, in voicing their needs and priorities to the relevant health professionals. \n \nThe  health  care  system  in  Indonesia  follows  the  administrative  structure  of  the  public \n3. \nsector.  Primary  health  care  (PHC)  is  provided  through  subdistrict  level  health  centers.  These \ncenters  have  in  turn,  several  auxiliary  health  centers  at  the  village  level.  Contracted  village \nmidwives  supervised  by  the  local  health  center  are  working  at  the  community  level  in  village-\nowned  birthing  posts  (Pos  Persalinan  Desa\u2014POLINDES).  Health  referrals  are  handled  at \ndistrict hospitals, which have 50\u2013200 beds. Further referrals are handled at provincial or central-\nlevel general hospitals and national specialty hospital centers. \n \n4. \n \n\nCivil work activities to be funded by the DHS2 include: \n\nConstruction of new general hospitals; \nConstruction of new auxiliary health centers and birthing posts; \nRenovation of general health facility buildings, family planning facilities, auxiliary \nhealth centers and birthing posts; \nRenovation and new construction of health training centers; \nRenovation and construction of regional health offices buildings; and \nRenovation and new construction of doctor's and paramedic's housing.  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n \n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nDuring  the  first  year  of  the  DHS2,  a  survey  will  be  undertaken  to  make  a  detailed \n5. \ninventory of existing facilities and their use and to develop flexible standard designs. The survey \nwill cover all issues related to environmental evaluation of hospitals, auxiliary health centers and \nhealth  training  centers.  Environmental  issues  related  to  the  construction  of  a  new  district \nhospital in Tanah Bumbu, South Kalimantan are similar to those of other new general hospitals \nincluded in the DHS2. Rehabilitation of Pangkalpinang City general hospital in Bangka Belitung \nis  also  an  example  of  renovation  work  for  hospitals  financed  under  the  DHS2.  Renovation  of \nPangkalan Balai district health centers in Banyuasin, South Sumatera and reconstruction of the \nKuin  Raya  district  health  centers,  Banjarmasin,  South  Kalimantan  are  examples  of  the  health \ncenter\u2019s  renovation  needed  because  of  the  bad  condition  of  the  facility  and  the  increased \nnumber  of  functions  of  health  centers  in  the  framework  of  the  DHS2.  Environmental  issues  at \nthe health centers are similar to those for hospitals, albeit at a much smaller scale.  \n \nC. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment  \n\n1. \n\nClimate \n\n6. \nThe tropical climate in the eight provinces has dry and wet seasons. The accumulative \nannual  rainfall  and  the  temperature  levels  vary  widely.  Temperatures  usually  range  between \n26oC  and  32oC,  also  depending  on  elevation  from  sea  level.  Wind  direction  always  reverses \nevery 6 months. South of the equator, the wind direction during wet season from September to \nFebruary  is  from  west  to  east,  and  from  east  to  west  during  the  dry  season  from  March  to \nAugust. The reverse is found north of the equator. \n \n\n2. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n7. \nThe  proposed  new  Tanah  Bumbu  district  hospital  in  South  Kalimantan  is  located  on  8 \nhectares  of  land  facing  the  existing  Batulicin  subdistrict  health  center  provided  by  the  Tanah \nBumbu district government. The site is on dry highlands of the small Batulicin City, and slopes \nto  the  east  (rear),  ideal  for  the  drainage  system.  The  hospital  will  be  constructed  in  three \nphases, and will eventually have 200 beds. The hospital facilities consist of out-patient clinics, \nemergency  facility,  intensive  care  unit,  general  wards,  delivery  ward,  operating  theater, \nlaboratory,  radiology,  medical  records,  administration,  general  services,  kitchen,  laundry, \nmortuary,  workshop,  incinerator,  solid  waste  temporary  storage  area,  other  required  public \nfacilities, and housing for doctors and paramedics. \n \nThe  180-bed  Pangkalpinang  City  general  hospital  will  be  renovated.  Buildings  and \n8. \nfacilities  are  old  and  need  rehabilitation.  The  hospital  is  in  the  south  part  of  the  city,  near  the \nairport. The area is free from floods. The soil consists of dry red podzolic, regosol, gleisol, and \norganosol layers. The site slopes to the east ideal for the drainage system. \n \n9. \nBanyuasin  is  a  new  district,  formerly  part  of  Musi  Banyuasin.  Pangkalan  Balai  is  the \ncapital,  but  does  not  have  a  hospital.  Health  services  are  provided  by  the  Pangkalan  Balai \nhealth  center  with  six  beds,  but  this  is  insufficient.  Traffic  accident  victims  or  patients  needing \nhospital  care  must  be  transferred  to  Palembang  (more  than  40  kilometers  away).  Pangkalan \nBalai health center needs improved facilities before being transformed into a general hospital. \n \n10. \nThe  Kuin  Raya  subdistrict  health  center,  in  Banjarmasin,  South  Kalimantan  provides \noutpatient  health  care  services.  Patient  attendance  is  high,  but  the  services  are  inadequate. \nInpatient  service  will  be  developed  because  the  center  is  located  in  a  poor  and  densely \n\n\f \n\n \n\n Appendix 12   \n\n45\n\nNo observed environmentally sensitive areas are in the proposed DHS2 sites. \n\npopulated area. The center is in an old building built of temporary material on swampy ground \nwhere high tides often inundate the surroundings. \n \n11. \nThere are no significant surface water problems in Batulicin, Pangkalan Balai or Pangkal \nPinang.  Clean  water  is  supplied  from  protected  ground  water  sources  or  a  municipal  water \ncompany. The Kuin Raya center's location is a problem for accessing clean water and because \nmosquitoes breed in the area. \n \n12. \n \n13. \nThe  outdoor  and  indoor  air  quality  is  satisfactory  at  almost all  the  proposed  civil  works \nlocations. However, long dry periods may be dusty, and airborne particulates can affect the air \nquality  negatively,  especially  in  health  facilities  near  busy  roads  with  active  traffic  movement. \nAdequate planting of trees around the health facilities can help reduce the problem.  \n \n14. \nGroundwater  may  be  used  at  most  locations.  Several  locations  need  accurate  geo-\nelectric sounding to determine the best location for wells. Adequate laboratory testing is needed \nto determine the extent of processing needed. Where groundwater is not suitable for use, clean \nwater needs to be transported if municipal water mains are not available. Clean and adequate \nwater supplies for the centers and housing need to be carefully ensured. \n \n\n3. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n15. \nThe  vegetation  at  most  health  facilities  is  well maintained,  except  in  Kuin  Raya,  where \ntides  and  dense  population  make  vegetation  care  difficult.  The  proposed  hospital  location  in \nBatulicin has no tall trees, and no flora that need to be conserved.  \n \n16. \nNo endangered species, wildlife, and wildlife habitat were identified on the premises or \nsurrounding  area  of  the  DHS2  health  facilities.  The  wildlife  identified  were  limited  to  common \nwild birds; mammals (cats, rats, and small rodents); and insects (ants, cockroaches, flies, and \nbees). \n \n\n4. \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n17. \nBatu  Licin,  the  capital  of  Tanah  Bumbu  district,  has  not  yet  adequate  community \nsanitation facilities. The new hospital will have to develop its own wastewater treatment system \narea.  Most  hospitals  need  a  diesel  generator  as  electricity  outages  occur,  due  to  the  limited \nresources  of  the  state  electricity  company.  Many  health  centers  are  not  connected  to  an \nelectricity source. Vaccines are stored in kerosene-powered cold storage.  \n \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n\n18. \nPresent  environmental  laws  and  Ministry  of  Health  and  Ministry  of  Environment \nregulations and guidelines provide sufficient safeguards for the environmentally safe operation \nof health facilities. Enforcement of the regulations needs improvement. \n \n19.  Medical  waste  from  hospitals  and  health  centers  should  be  burned  in  incinerators  or \nother  high  temperature  furnaces.  This  needs  the  serious  attention  of  the  health  facility \nmanagement because careful handling is essential. \n \n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 12 \n\nimpacts  associated  with \n\nConstruction  Phase.  Adverse  environmental \n\nHospital  and  health  center  wastewater  should  go  a  wastewater  treatment  plant  before \n20. \ndraining to the open environment or public sewerage, or absorption into the ground. The size of \nthe plant needs to be carefully calculated by the architect or contractor, taking into consideration \nthe actual load posed by patients, relatives, visitors, and health personnel. A plant for a health \ncenter  may  be  a  simple  septic  tank,  as  long  as  local  ground  conditions  are  also  taken  into \nconsideration in the design of the effluent absorption area.  \n \n21. \nthe \nimplementation  of  civil  works  will  be  minimal,  short-term,  and  mitigated  by  appropriate  design \nand project management of facilities construction and operation. Trees near health facilities will \nbe replanted, and other vegetation restored.  \n \nIndoor  Quality  And  Energy  Efficiency.  To  ensure  good  indoor  quality,  the  building \n22. \ndesign should incorporate a natural lighting and tropical climate ventilation system as much as \npossible.  Whenever  natural  ventilation  is  inadequate,  fans  and  air  conditioning  may  be \nemployed.  In-patient  facilities  need  to  be  designed  to  avoid  the  spread  of  contamination  and \ninfections  among  patients.  Energy  efficiency  can  be  achieved  if  all  users  economize  on \nelectricity  usage.  This  entails  adequate  socialization  and  enforcement  by  the  management  for \nall  concerned  (staff,  patients,  visitors,  and  other  personnel).  Other  energy  saving  measures \ninclude the use of solar water heating and automatic switching for open public area lighting.  \n \n23. \nGreen  Gas  Emissions.  Incinerators  need  to  be  carefully  chosen  to  ensure  that  the \nrecommended  working  temperature  can  always  be  achieved.  Incinerators  and  back-up  diesel \ngenerators  need  to  be  kept  in  good  condition  to  ensure  complete  combustion  that  helps  keep \nthe  environment  clean.  Their  location  and  exhaust  stacks  need  to  be  carefully  designed  to \nminimize  noise  and  smoke  pollution.  The  use  of  renewable  energy  sources  is  preferable \nwhenever technically and economically feasible. Solar energy is still prohibitively expensive as \nthe equipment is not readily available and there are no trained personnel able to maintain it. \n \n24. \nInstitutional  Requirements  and  Environmental  Monitoring  Program.  Existing \nenvironmental laws and regulations form the basis for collection and disposal of medical waste. \nEnvironment monitoring and evaluation activities of the health facility and its surrounding area \nwill  follow  the  existing  standards.  Engineers  will  incorporate  environmental  impact  mitigation \nmeasures  into  the  technical  design  of  DHS2  facilities.  Construction  and  operation  phases  will \ninclude  mitigation  measures  as  needed.  Engineers  will  be  responsible  for  developing  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  for  each  subproject,  which  will  summarize  proposed \nenvironmental  mitigation  activities,  including  time-bound  action  plan,  containing  performance \nevaluation  of  specific  environmental,  health,  and  safety  activities  as  reflected  in  the  results  of \nperiodic  and  quantitative  sampling  and  measuring  programs.  The  provincial  and  district  health \noffice,  the  local  environmental  impact  management  agency  (BAPEDAL)  and  the  Ministry  of \nHealth will provide technical guidance in preparing the plan following national guidelines.  \n \n25. \nA committee to monitor the quality of civil works and environment will be set up at each \ndistrict and city in order to monitor and evaluate compliance according to the EMP milestones. \nThe  committee  will  be  composed  of  a  DHS2  district  coordinator,  the  local  BAPEDAL,  and  the \ndistrict  health  office.  Periodic  site  supervision  visits  will  also  be  conducted.  The  committee\u2019s \nreport will be a part of the project progress report. \n\n\f \n\nA. \n \n\n \n\n Appendix 13   \n\n47\n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\n \n1. \nThe  Second  Decentralized  Health  Services  Project  (DHS2)  focuses  on  improving  the \nrole  of  government  in  the  sector  in  a  decentralized  context.  Decentralization  offers  new \nopportunities  to  strengthen  health  and  family  planning  services  in  the  regions  through  locally \nadapted  reforms  giving  health  services  providers  more  appropriate \nincentives,  skills, \nsupervision, material support, and discretionary authority needed to offer high quality services, \nand providing clients with information, financial means, and bargaining power required to elicit \nappropriate responses. Investments are needed to help the regions and the central Government \nplan, implement, manage, monitor, and evaluate a range of programs and activities. DHS2 will \nstrengthen capacity at district, provincial, and national levels for the delivery of health services.  \nIt will include planning and management to ensure universal access to good quality health and \nfamily planning services, and to improve quality, cost efficiency, and sustainability of health and \nfamily planning services in the DHS2 area. The initial advocacy, training, and technical support \nwill build up commitment and capacity of regional governments. The leading role of the public \nhealth  sector  in  decentralization  will  require  strong  support  and  participation  from  a  variety  of \nstakeholders.  The  DHS2  will  also  address  the  increasingly important  role  of  the  private  health \nsector, the professional associations, and the community in the organization and governance of \nthe health system. The primary focus of the DHS2 will be poor and vulnerable groups, and the \nunderserved.  DHS2\u2019s support to primary health care (PHC) will play a key role in the decrease \nof maternal and infant mortality, and general morbidity. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nThe DHS2 is expected to yield several benefits.  These include improved health status in \n2. \nthe  provinces  and  districts  through  increased  spending  for  health,  better  prioritization  and \ntargeting  of  health  services,  improved  resource  mobilization,  enhanced  service  quality,  and \nbetter access for vulnerable groups. Regional authorities informed of local concerns will devise \nmore cost-efficient health service delivery systems. The DHS2 increases the economic benefits \nof  decentralization  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels  through  capacity  building,  physical \ninvestment, and reforms. While there may be savings in the health reforms, such savings will be \ndirected  to  increasing  subsidies  to  the  poor.  Health  promotion  activities  will  also  be  targeted \ntowards women and the poor to increase health status.  \n \n3. \n The DHS2 is expected to contribute to the reduction in the burden disease measured by \nthe  reduction  in  disability  adjusted  life  years  (DALYs)  lost due  to  death  and  disability.    Project \nbenefits  have  been  estimated  in  terms  of  reduction  of  the  gap  in  DALY  between  the  project \nprovinces and developed countries, multiplied by the 2002 per capita regional minimum wages.  \nData  derived  from  the  1993  World  Development  Report1  indicates  that  the  gap  in  DALY \nbetween non-Indian and Chinese Asian countries and established market economies was about \n143 per 1000 population.  The gap in DALY is estimated by disaggregating the major disease \ncategories,  using  relatively  recent  burden  of  disease  data  from  previous  health  projects.  The \nvalue of a DALY saved in each province is the monetary value of the minimum wage levels in \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1993. World Development Report. Washington DC. \n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 13 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nthe  province2.    For  DHS2,  the  maximum  benefit  effect  assumes  a  reduction  of  the  gap  by  7.4 \nDALYs per 1,000 population. This will be achieved through:  \n \n\nDHS2  activities  directed  towards  improved  clinical  quality  will  impact  the \ntreatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, improve the quality \nof family planning services, and injury related clinical services. This is estimated \nto  reduce  the  DALY  difference  between  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation \nand Development market economies and Indonesia by 1.9%. \n\nEfficiency of the health system will be improved through better allocation of health \npersonnel.    This  will  free  resources  to  improve  clinical  and  family  planning \nservices  and  to  target  subsidies  to  the  poor,  women,  and  children,  thereby \nincreasing their access to health services. This is assumed to reduce the DALY \ngap by 1.6%. \n\nLocally  managed  health  services  will  result  in  more  targeted  and  appropriate \nservice  provision.  Health  promotion  and  family  planning  programs  will  be  an \nimportant part of the local health system. Nutritional and vehicle safety education \nprograms are two activities related to areas with large DALY differences between \nthe  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  economies  and \nIndonesia. This is estimated to reduce the DALY gap by 1.7%. \n\n \n4. \nThe cumulative maximum benefit of 7.4% DALY reduction proposed in DHS2 compares \nto  the  estimated  11.5  percent  DALY  reduction  in  the  World  Bank-supported  Provincial  Health \nProject I and the 4% DALY reduction estimated for the Decentralized Health Services Project.  \nEconomic benefits are based on the assumption that health services contribute 20% to health \nimprovement,  while  the  generic  impact  of  behavior  change  is  35%.  These  values  have  been \nderived  from  a  wide  range  of  projects  and  health  impacts  over  time,  by  computing  output \nrelationships for health system investments and behavior change investments.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Internal Rates of Return and Net Present Value \n\n \n5. \nDHS2 expects to yield a composite economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 37%, with \nproject provinces economic rates of return ranging from 21.5% (East Nusa Tenggara) to 50.2% \n(South Sumatra).  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe period of analysis covers a 20-year period (2004-2023), carried out in \nconstant 2002 prices, with domestic prices used as numeraire.   \nEconomic costs were calculated based on the annual project cost disbursements.  \nIncremental  recurrent  costs  were  estimated  at  about  5%  of  capital  costs  (civil \nworks and equipment).  Project funds are expended over a six-year period. \n\n \n6. \nTradable goods of capital and operation and maintenance costs were adjusted based on \na  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.20.3  Tradable  goods  are  estimated  to  be  about  40%  of \nproject costs. At a discount rate of 12%, the net present value (NPV)  of the flow  of costs and \nbenefits  is  $111,656,718.  The  analysis  indicates  that  the  economic  benefits  will  result  from \ninfluences  that  lead  to  reductions  in  disease  burden  and  related  DALYs.

Financial  rate  of \n7. \nreturn  is  not  calculated  since  investment  is  on  PHC,  considered  as  core  poverty  reduction \nactivities,4 and user charges will not be applied in the investment project. Hence, cost recovery \nis not al factor in the project design. The financial analysis focuses on the fiscal impact of the \nDHS2  on  regional  government  budgets.

Chronically low funding \nof public health services has affected service quality and effectiveness, which in turn have had \n\n                                                 \n4   54 of the 90 project districts have low fiscal capacity based on 2003 data. \n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 13 \n\nan  impact  on  the  use  of  public  health  services  and  the  health  status  of  the  population.      In \nselected  provinces  in  the  country,  district  allocations  for  health  are  only  about  two  to  eight \npercent of the local health budget.5 Hence, it is essential that health service delivery achieve (i) \ngreater  cost-efficiency  in  resource  allocation,  and  (ii)  increased  resource  mobilization. \nInvestments in PHC and family planning services are a cost-effective means of providing quality \nPHC  services.  Rationalizing  personnel,  increasing  public-private  partnership,  and  resource \nmobilization are the proposed reform options for the districts and provinces. Better public-private \npartnership also will get the private sector more involved in health care financing, managed care \nand other reforms. \n \n9. \nAbout  30%  of  the  DHS2  will  be  financed  by  the  national  Government  and  the  loan \nproceeds will be forwarded to the regions as a grant (ongranting mechanisms). From a total cost \nof  $143  million,  the  Government  will  finance  about  $43.0  million.  The  Government\u2019s  annual \nshare in project costs will average around $7.2 million during the project period. The recurrent \ncosts to be borne by the Government during the DHS2 are estimated to be about $1.6 million \nper year.  DHS2 is designed to minimize recurrent cost implications for the Government and the \ncommunity.  The  improvement  of  the  quality  and  management  support  systems  in  DHS2  is \nintended  to  improve  the  internal  efficiency  of  the  health  system.  The  development  of  a \nappropriate  and  improved  system  will  result  in  an  efficient  use  of  resources  and  an  effective \ndelivery of health services. The costs associated with system development are one time costs to \nsupport  reforms,  and  therefore  the  incremental  costs  from  the  DHS2  are  negligible  and \nsustainable. \n \n10. \nBased  on  project  disbursements,  projections  were  made  to  assess  the  annual  district \nhealth expenditure as a result of the incremental project investment so that the Government is \npresented with a clear funding commitment. Currently, in the eight provinces supported by the \nproject, there is a wide variation both within and across provinces in health spending.  In most of \nthe project districts, the levels of health spending are about 1 to 2% of the local district budget \nexpenditures.  DHS2  will  provide  funds  to  districts  and  provinces  to  support  development \nspending to achieve increased health outcomes. With the DHS2, total district health expenditure \nwill  comprise  an  average  of  about  2%  of  local  expenditures  during  the  project  period.  This  is \nconsidered to have minimal impact on local budgetary resources.  In order to make substantial \nimpact  on  key  health  indicators,  however,  substantial  increase  in  health  spending  would  be \nrequired.  To  avoid  a  sharp  drop  in  spending  by  2011,  public  health  spending  would  have  to \nincrease  during  project  implementation  in  order  to  sustain  and  deepen  project  benefits.  Local \ngovernment commitment will have to be obtained to ensure sustainability of the health reforms \nand to maintain the improved public health facilities.  Increased levels of health spending at the \ndistrict level could be achieved through cross-subsidies between better-off and poor areas, and \nother \n(community  mobilization  and  public-private-\npartnerships). \n \n \n\nresource  mobilization  mechanisms \n\n                                                \n \n5   World Bank. 2003.
