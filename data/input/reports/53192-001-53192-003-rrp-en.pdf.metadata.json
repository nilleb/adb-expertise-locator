The Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded component\nof the project will cover 17 out of these 52 subdivisions. As a result of this project, the efficiency,\nreliability,  and  safety  of  the  power  distribution  system  in  urban  areas  of  Bengaluru  will  be\nenhanced. The project has received in-principle approval from Karnataka Electricity Regulatory\nCommission (KERC), which determines the end consumer electricity tariff. This will ensure that\nthe project costs and benefits are reflected in the consumer tariff. The project will also strengthen\nthe  institutional  capacity  of  BESCOM  in  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  environment  and\nsocial safeguards, financial management, and corporate gender equality and social inclusion.\n\n3.\nThe  project  demonstrates  an  innovative  project  financing  structure.  The  combination  of\nsovereign and nonsovereign loans from ADB will significantly reduce the sovereign exposure and\nhelp BESCOM move towards a market-based approach for raising financial resources for capital\nexpenditure.  The  project  will  introduce  BESCOM  to  practices  and  procedures  for  accessing\ncommercial  financing  from  an  international  lender  and  instill  financial  management  discipline\nduring monitoring. This financing arrangement is the first case of its kind for ADB - in which ADB\nis pilot testing a provision of a combined support to a state government-owned (sub-sovereign)\nenterprise.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nII.\n\nTHE PROJECT\n\nState  economy.  Karnataka  is  India\u2019s  information  technology  hub.  Bengaluru,  the  state\n4.\ncapital, is the fourth largest technological cluster in the world, after Silicon Valley, San Francisco,\nand  London.  In  2019,  exports  of  electronics  and  computer  software  from  the  state  totaled\n$77 billion,  or  about  39%  of  India\u2019s  electronics  and  computer  software  exports,  and  76%  of\nKarnataka\u2019s  overall  exports.1 Along  with  rapid  economic  growth  (about  6.8%  per  annum),  the\nurban  population  grew  from  about  7  million  in  2008  to  more  than  10  million  in  2019,  with  a\npopulation  density  of  4,400  persons  per  square  kilometer,  making  Bengaluru  the  fourth  most\npopulous city in India after Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata.  Based on this rapid economic growth,\nelectricity demand has also increased by an average of 10% per year since 2015.\n\n5.\nSector  overview.  Power  distribution  is  the  most  crucial  yet  the  weakest  link  in  India\u2019s\nelectricity  supply  chain.  It  has  a  direct  impact  on  the  energy  sector\u2019s  commercial  viability,  and\nultimately  consumers,  through  intermittent  supply  and  high  tariffs.  The  distribution  sector  has\ntraditionally had high distribution losses caused by old and dilapidated equipment, electricity theft,\nlow metering levels, and poor financial health of utilities, with low cost recovery. Because of this,\nmany distribution companies (DISCOMs) have not been able to invest sufficiently in infrastructure\naugmentation.\n\n1  Indian Brand Equity Foundation. 2018. Karnataka: The Silicon Valley of India. New Delhi. \n\n\fIndia has about 73 distribution utilities\u201413 electricity departments, 17 private DISCOMs, \n6. \n41 corporatized DISCOMs, and 2 state electricity boards. In the state of Karnataka,  Karnataka \nElectricity  Board  was  unbundled  along  functional  lines  into  a  transmission  and  distribution \ncompany called Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) and a generating \ncompany  called  Visvesvaraya  Vidyuth  Nigam  Limited  in  April  2000.  KPTCL  was  subsequently \nunbundled into six independent companies in 2002, with one transmission company (KPTCL) and \nfive DISCOMs (including BESCOM).2  \n \nKERC  is  an  independent  authority  responsible  for  regulating  electricity  supply  and \n7. \ndistribution in Karnataka state, including determining user tariffs for generation, transmission, and \ndistribution. Karnataka has a well-established multiyear tariff regime under which KERC provides \ntariff sustainability and visibility for a 3-year period. Tariff determination works on the principle of \nan approved regulated asset base, operating expenses, debt service, and the provision of a fixed \nreturn on equity. DISCOMs in the state file tariff petitions each year for KERC to review and revise \nits tariff structure to align it with actual expenses.  \n \nClient overview. BESCOM, incorporated in 2002, is one of five state-owned distribution \n8. \nutilities in Karnataka licensed to supply electricity in the state. It is the largest distribution utility in \nKarnataka  and  is  responsible  for  power  distribution  in  eight  divisions,  covering  41,092  square \nkilometers and more than 11.8 million consumers in 2019. The company has four operating zones \nin  Bengaluru, 3 covering,  in  aggregate,  about  100,000  kilometers  (km)  of  11 kilovolt  medium \nvoltage lines and 170,000 km of 1.1 kilovolt and 230-volt low voltage lines. \n \n9. \nFinancial  performance.  BESCOM  has  been  one  of  the  better  performing  distribution \nentities in India in terms of operational and financial parameters, ranking fourth among India\u2019s 41 \nstate  power  distribution  utilities  in  2019.4 BESCOM  has  maintained  an  ideal  mix  of  consumer \nprofile,  with  a  good  balance  of  commercial  and  domestic  consumers.5 However,  its  financial \nmanagement  practices  could be  improved.  BESCOM\u2019s  borrowings  are  all  from  public  financial \ninstitutions (e.g., Power Finance Corporation, and Rural Electrification Corporation Limited) and \npublic  sector  banks.  These  loans  are  typically  made  based  on  BESCOM\u2019s  position  as  a \nGovernment of Karnataka (GOK)-owned entity, rather than its standalone credit profile. Improved \nfinancial  management  capability  will  allow  BESCOM  to  improve  its  credit  profile  and  tap  the \ndomestic  and  international  commercial  financing  market\u2014a  more  sustainable  source  of \nfinancing\u2014for critical infrastructure development\u2014rather than relying from sovereign borrowings.  \n \n10. \nLeveraging nonsovereign financing. The GOK sets guidelines for access to sovereign \nborrowing  from  international  financial  institutions  for  revenue-generating  sectors  such  as  the \nenergy  sector.  The  aim  is  to  maximize  the  allocation  of  sovereign  borrowing  space  for \nnonrevenue-generating,  poverty  reduction-focused  projects,  and/or  emergency  responses  to \nnational crises caused by events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BESCOM \nfalls in between revenue-generating and nonrevenue-generating segments, as a large part of the \npower  sold  by  BESCOM  is  priced  commercially  while  a  portion  is  sold  to  the  low-income \n\n \n\n2  The  five  companies  are  (i)  Mangalore  Electricity  Supply  Company  Limited,  (ii)  Hubli  Electricity  Supply  Company \nLimited,  (iii)  Gulbarga  Electricity  Supply  Company  Limited,  (iv)  Chamundeshwari  Electricity  Supply  Corporation \nLimited, and (v) Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited. \n\n3  Bengaluru Metropolitan Area Zone (North), Bengaluru Metropolitan Area Zone (South), Bengaluru Rural Area Zone, \n\n4  Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Power.  2019.  State  Distribution  Utilities  Seventh  Annual  Integrated  Rating. \n\nand Chitradurga Zone. \n\nNew Delhi. \n\n5  The  total  number  of  consumers  served  by  BESCOM  was  about  11.8  million  in  2019,  of  which  about  67%  were \n\nhouseholds, 25.2% were commercial and industrial consumers, and 7.8% were for irrigation pumps. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fhouseholds and the agriculture sector, priced below cost and requiring a GOK subsidy. For such \nentities falling between revenue-generating and nonrevenue-generating segments, the objective \nof  using  sovereign  loans  is  to  leverage\u2014to  the  maximum  extent  possible\u2014commercial \nnonsovereign borrowing. Consistent with this objective, the Government of India and the GOK \nseek  ADB  assistance  to  pilot  test  a  combination  of  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  financing  for \ninvestment in Karnataka\u2019s power distribution segment. The provision of a nonsovereign loan by \nADB without a sovereign guarantee from India, in combination with a sovereign loan, will act as \na  transition  measure  towards  moving  BESCOM  towards  full  market-based  financing  -  by  (i) \nenhancing  financial  discipline;  (ii)  strengthening  its  financial  performance  through  regular \nmonitoring; and (iii) eventually enabling BESCOM to access borrowing from commercial banks \nboth  locally  and  internationally,  without  seeking  credit  enhancement  from  the  GOK  and/or  the \ncentral government, thereby freeing up fiscal space. This pilot collaboration will provide lessons \nto  structure  similar  initiatives  in  the  future  and  open  opportunities  for  large-scale  lending  on  a \ncombined basis to sub-sovereign entities, particularly in power distribution.  \n \n11. \nTechnical performance. The capacity of the power distribution system in the Bengaluru \nurban  area  is  inadequate  and  unreliable.  Technical  and  commercial  losses  are  about  13%, \nsignificantly higher than the international average of 5%, because of the high level of unauthorized \nconnections and overloading of conductors. The quality and reliability of electricity supply in the \nBengaluru urban area remain low by international standards. The average annual outage duration \nin  2019  was  112.0  hours  per  customer,  compared  with  a  median  value  of  1.5  hours  for \nNorth American utilities. Further, the Bengaluru urban area had 15.3 times of power interruptions \nper customer in 2019, compared with a median value of 1.1 times for North American utilities. \nThese performance indicators are unacceptably high for Bengaluru, which is expected to have a \nmodern electrical distribution network as India\u2019s leading technology hub. \n \n12. \nBengaluru experiences frequent thunderstorms, which occasionally cause power outages \nand local flooding. The overhead distribution system is unsafe, particularly in urban areas. The \ndistribution lines are prone to coming into contact with trees, animals, and human beings; and can \ncause power failures and fires as well as serious and fatal accidents. Utility poles on sidewalks \ncreate obstacles for pedestrians. During disasters caused by natural hazards, snapped lines and \nbroken poles cause accidents, destabilize electricity supply and information network systems, and \nblock  emergency  transportation  roads  and  evacuation  routes. 6  To  cope  with  these  issues, \nBESCOM has developed an $845 million plan to convert existing overhead distribution lines to \nunderground  cables,  and  install  automated  ring  main  units  adapted  with  a  DAS  covering  the \n52 subdivisions in four phases.  \n \n13. \nGovernment  power  distribution  program.  Building  an  energy-efficient  distribution \nnetwork is one of the climate mitigation strategies identified under India\u2019s Nationally Determined \nContributions.7 The Ministry of Power promotes the conversion of overhead distribution lines to \nunderground lines, and the integration of information technology in the power distribution system \nof urban areas to reduce system losses under the Integrated Power Development Scheme.8 In \naddition, under the proposed DISCOM sector reform, it targets reducing the aggregate technical \nand  commercial  loss  to  12%\u201315%  by  2025.  Building  efficient  urban  infrastructure  is  a  key \nprovision, including the development of underground distribution networks in the Bengaluru urban \narea, under the Revised Master Plan 2031 for Bengaluru,9 aimed at developing a livable city. \n\n \n\n6  V.

Reliable  electricity  supply  is  a  lifeline \n14. \ninfrastructure in urban areas, and essential to sustain the operation of high-technology industries \nunder  normal  situations\u2014and  particularly  during  and  after  COVID-19.  Under  the  lockdown \nsituation with COVID-19, electricity supply has been a critical input to support essential services \nsuch as health care, food production and supply, and online businesses for basic social needs. \nReliable electricity is also important to support essential household activities such as (i) working \nfrom  home,  (ii) online  schooling  in  a  comfortable  indoor  environment (air-conditioning),  and \n(iii) making online services available for essential activities such as bill payments and shopping.  \n \n15. \nIn more general terms, modernizing power distribution networks in the Bengaluru urban \narea will (i) reduce distribution losses, thereby reducing the additional consumption of fossil fuels \nand associated greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants; (ii) improve the reliability and quality \nof  the  electricity  service  for  more  than  10  million  people  and  high-technology  industries;  and \n(iii) contribute to developing a livable and disaster-resilient city. \n \n16. \nADB experience and lessons learned. ADB has implemented several power distribution \nprojects in India since 2010.10 Proper O&M of invested assets was a key to success learned from \nprevious ADB projects.  \n \n17. \nStrategic  context.  The  proposed  project  will  contribute  to  achieving  the  operational \npriorities  (OP)  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  for  (i)  making  cities  more  livable  (OP  4),  and  tackling \nclimate change and building disaster resilience (OP 3) by converting existing power distribution \ninfrastructure \ninfrastructure;  and \n(ii) strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  (OP  6),  and  accelerating  progress  in \ngender  equality  (OP  2)  by  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  BESCOM  in  O&M, \nenvironment  and  social  safeguards,  financial  management,  and  corporate  gender  and  social \ninclusion.  11  It  supports  the  following  priorities  under  the  country  partnership  strategy  for \nIndia, 2018\u20132022:12 (i) pillar 1: boosting economic competitiveness to create more and better jobs, \nand  (ii) pillar  3:  addressing  climate  change  and  increasing  climate resilience.  It  is  aligned  with \npromoting  energy  efficiency  under  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy  2009. 13  It  is  consistent  with  the \nrecommendation of the recent ADB\u2019s sector-wide evaluation of ADB Energy Policy and Program, \nin terms of enhancing our assistance to distribution sector with policy reforms and innovations.14 \nThe proposed project is included in the country operations business plan for India (2021\u20132023).15 \nIt  also  supports  the  sustainable  development  goals  (SDGs)  to  (i)  ensure  universal  access  to \naffordable,  reliable  and  modern  energy  services (SDG  7.1);  (ii)  provide  universal  access  to \nsafe, inclusive, and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, \nolder  persons  and  persons  with  disabilities  (SDG  11.7);  and  (iii)  strengthen  resilience  and \nadaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and disasters in all countries (13.a).16  \n\nto  smart,  safe,  energy-efficient,  and  climate-resilient \n\n \n\n10 ADB.

The project will have the following outcome: energy efficiency, reliability, and safety \nof power supply system in Bengaluru urban areas improved.17 \n \n19. \nOutput  1:  Smart,  and  climate-  and  disaster-resilient  power  distribution  system \nestablished in six divisions in urban areas of Bengaluru. The project will (i) convert 7,200 km \nof overhead distribution lines to underground cables, with 2,800 km of optical fiber cables, and \n(ii) install 1,700 automated ring main units adapted with a DAS. The sovereign and non-sovereign \nloans will finance separate contracts in different divisions in the project area.18  \n \nThe conversion to underground distribution lines allows appropriate sizing of conductors \n20. \nand prevents electricity theft from overhead lines, which will contribute to reducing technical and \ncommercial losses by about 30%. The proposed solution will minimize electricity outages resulting \nfrom natural hazards (e.g., cyclones) and interference with overhead distribution lines by foreign \nobjects. The project will support efforts toward building green and climate-resilient cities, as the \nunderground distribution lines will facilitate the construction of pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and \neliminate the need to prune or remove trees to keep the minimum distance from live wires.  \n \nThe  DAS  will  allow  the  power  system  to  monitor  and  control  the  distribution  line \n21. \nswitchgears  from  the  control  center,  contributing  to  shorter  power  interruptions.  It  will  enable \nautomatic  continuity  of the  power  flow  to  healthy  sections  of  the  distribution  system,  efficiently \nisolating the failed sections until further repair work\u2014without having to dispatch staff to the field \nwhen a high voltage distribution line experiences a failure.19 In addition, the DAS contributes to \noptimization of the distribution system itself through monitoring of load current, minimizing losses \nand overloading.  \n \nThe  proposed  project  will  install  optical  fiber  communication  cables  in  parallel  with  the \n22. \nconversion  of  overhead  distribution  lines  to  underground  lines.20 Optical  fiber  communication \ncables can be utilized for a smart metering system, DAS, and any other devices that contribute to \nmaking the distribution grid more reliable, flexible, responsive, and smart. Surplus capacity of the \noptical fiber network will be leased to private telecommunications companies. This will help create \nbetter  and faster  internet  communications,  which  will  help support  work  from  home  and  online \nschooling  arrangements  during  and  after  COVID-19.  The  project  will  apply  international  best \npractices  to  Bengaluru,  as  a  megacity  and  India\u2019s  Silicon  Valley,  to  improve  the  safety  of  its \ncitizens and minimize adverse impacts on economic activities from power failures.  \n \n23. \n Output  2:  Institutional  capacity  of  implementing  agency  improved.  The  proposed \nproject will strengthen the capacity of BESCOM in (i) O&M of smart power distribution systems, \n(ii) environment and social safeguards, (iii) financial management, and (iv) corporate gender and \n\n \n\n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 The sovereign loan will finance three  divisions (Kora Mangala, HSR Division, and White Field), the nonsovereign \nloan will finance two divisions (Shivaji Nagar and Indira Nagar), and the implementing agency will finance one division \n(Jaya Nagara).  \n\n19 Without a DAS, if a power interruption arises from a failure in the high voltage distribution line, DISCOM staff are \ndispatched to the field to detect the failure point and operate switchgears in the distribution line in order to isolate \nsuch faults and continue power transmission to the unaffected sections. \n\n20 An example is in Japan under the service area of Kansai Electric Power (around the Osaka region). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fValue Added by ADB  \n\nsocial  inclusion,  under  the  approved  transaction  technical  assistance  and  ADB\u2019s  in-house \nexpertise.21   \n \nC. \n \n24. \nThe proposed project represents the first instance where ADB will use a combination of \nsovereign and nonsovereign lending to support a fully state government-owned (sub-sovereign) \nenterprise.  By employing this modality, the ADB assistance will represent an innovative project \nfinancing arrangement for supporting such borrowers. This financing will add significant value to \nGOK by reducing its need for\u2014and instead leveraging on\u2014a sovereign assistance, thus releasing \nscarce sovereign borrowing capacity that can now be deployed for meeting more pressing social \nneeds such as for COVID-19 response and provision of health care. The nonsovereign loan will \nalso add value to BESCOM by providing much needed long-term local currency financing which \nis not readily available in the domestic commercial market. ADB\u2019s involvement will also add value \nby  improving  BESCOM\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  raise  commercial  financing\u2014through  its \ninvolvement  in  the  processing,  due  diligence,  and  commercial  negotiations  of  the  ADB \nnonsovereign  loan. In addition,  through  regular monitoring  (including  compliance with financial \ncovenants), the ADB loans will add value by enhancing financial discipline and strengthening the \nfinancial  performance  of  BESCOM,  helping  it  transition  toward  a  sustainable,  market-based \napproach for financing future capital expenditure. Once established, this model can be replicated \nin other states and across the region.  \n \n25. \nAs BESCOM will be adopting new technology under the proposed project, ADB organized \na training for BESCOM engineers to strengthen their knowledge and resources for O&M of the \nunderground power cable and optical fiber network, in partnership with a leading power DISCOM \nin Japan. Similar training will be provided during the project implementation. Since BESCOM does \nnot have previous project implementation experience with ADB and/or other multilateral financial \ninstitutions, ADB will also add significant value by (i) supporting it in developing an environmental \nand social management system applicable to all BESCOM operations as well as providing training \nin environment safeguards at the project level to strengthen its implementation, supervision, and \nmonitoring capacity; (ii) supporting the implementation of a financial management action plan to \nenhance the financial control and computerization of the financial and accounting processes; and \n(iii) conducting a gender analysis of BESCOM\u2019s corporate structure and developing a corporate \ngender and social inclusion strategy for BESCOM that will establish gender targets for education, \ntraining, and awareness-raising initiatives during the project.  \n \nD. \n \n26. \n \n27. \n \n28. \nSovereign  loan.  The  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of  $100.0  million  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project.

ADB and BESCOM have reviewed the \nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the project. Since the project has a 5-year implementation \nperiod, which incorporates sufficient buffer to account for project planning related contingencies, \nany short-term disruption caused by COVID-19 is not expected to cause significant delays or cost \nincreases. BESCOM continues to work effectively and efficiently within the constraints imposed \nby the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. However, given the evolving situation of COVID-\n19, BESCOM and ADB will monitor its impact regularly.  \n \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n37. \nPower  distribution  networks  are  the  most  vulnerable  to  storms  and  extreme  weather \nevents.  Improvements  in  the  overall  condition  and  efficiency  of  the  power  delivery  system \nstrengthen the resilience of the system and support rapid recovery from weather-related outages. \nThe  project  has  been  designed  to  adopt  underground  cabling  to  mitigate  climate  and  disaster \nrisks  by  minimizing  power  outages  from  natural  hazards  and  extreme  weather  events.  Cross-\nlinked polyethylene-insulated  aluminum conductor  armored cable,  which  is  waterproof  and  will \nnot be affected by increased rainfall or increased soil moisture, will be used under the project for \nunderground distribution cable. The technical viability of underground cabling is well established, \nas it has been used widely in large cities all over the world. BESCOM has experience in installing \nunderground  cabling  on  a  pilot  basis  and  has  received  training  on  the  O&M  of  underground \ncabling from a leading power DISCOM in Japan during the project preparation.   \n \nB. \n \n38. \n \n39. \n \nC. \n \n40. \nBESCOM has assigned qualified staff (Table 3) to operate and maintain the assets funded \nby the project over their economic life.

Direct  benefits  will  go  to  students  and  staff  in  about \n986 schools, and patients and medical staff in about 562 hospitals. The project will provide reliable \nelectricity  services  to  households,  including  low-income  households,  in  the  project  areas.  The \nproject will (i) improve living conditions through adequate and reliable electricity supply services, \n(ii) improve the resilience of the urban power distribution system to natural hazards, (iii) remove \nhazards associated with overhead power lines, (iv) help make sidewalks more pedestrian-friendly \nby  removing  power  distribution  line  poles,  (v)  improve  education  and  medical  services  by \nproviding reliable electricity supply services, and (vi) potentially increase incomes through 290 job \nopportunities created during construction and 50 positions created during operations. \n \nGender  equality.  The project  is classified  some  gender  elements. It  can  help promote \n47. \ngender equality and social inclusion in the following areas: (i) access to affordable electricity for \nfemale-headed  poor  households;  (ii)  gender-inclusive  energy  conservation,  safety  awareness, \nand customer satisfaction; and (iii) gender mainstreaming assessment of policies and operations \nat  BESCOM\u2019s  corporate  level.  BESCOM  commits  to  implement  measures  to  promote  gender \nequality  or  women\u2019s  empowerment  in  its  business  activities  following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender \nand Development.24 Key gender actions relate to (i) ensuring the granting of a lifeline tariff to poor \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  through  a  100%  subsidy  of  the  electricity  bill  by  the  local \ngovernment and waiving connection fees by BESCOM; (ii) supporting a gender-inclusive energy \nconservation  campaign;  (iii)  supporting  a  gender-inclusive  safety  awareness  campaign; \n(iv) conducting customer satisfaction surveys in a gender-responsive manner to improve service \ndelivery; and (v) conducting a gender analysis of BESCOM\u2019s corporate structure and preparing a \n\n22 Pilot project was implemented in four subdivisions in two divisions (Vidhana Soudha and Shivajinagar) in 2018. \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB. 1998.

BESCOM will \nsubmit periodic reports on the implementation of its gender measures to ADB. \n \nG. \n \n48. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows. 25  A  corporate  audit  of  BESCOM\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  and  performance  was  undertaken  by  an  external  consultant,  and  a \ncorrective action plan for completion before the first disbursement was agreed with BESCOM to \naddress the identified gaps.  \n \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  involving \n49. \nmeaningful  consultations  with  affected  communities  was  prepared  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.26 Works  will  take  place  in  the  Bengaluru  urban  area  along  existing  rights-of-\nway  (ROWs),  so  potential  impacts\u2014including  pollution,  health,  and  safety  risks\u2014are  generally \nminor, site-specific, and limited to construction. Construction will disrupt traffic.  During operation \nsulfur hexafluoride (a potent greenhouse gas) may leak from the ring main units. However, moving \ncables underground will reduce health and safety risks in the long term. Potential impacts will be \nmitigated \nthe \nenvironmental management plan included in the IEE, for which a budget of $0.7 million has been \nset  aside.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established.  Monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  semiannually  until  the  project  completion  report  is  issued  (or  a  later  date  agreed \ntherein)  for  the  sovereign  component,  and  then  annually  until  final  maturity  date  of  the \nnonsovereign  loan.  BESCOM  will  (i)  appoint  a  safeguard  team  to  supervise  and  monitor \nimplementation, (ii) provide  training to  its  staff  and contractors,  and (iii)  recruit  an  independent \nenvironment consultant to help ensure safeguards compliance. The safeguard documents were \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 9 October 2020. BESCOM will disclose the IEE locally through \ntheir website with printed copies available via their division offices. Sovereign contract packages \nhave not yet been awarded, but they will incorporate the environment management plan before \naward. Nonsovereign and BESCOM-financed contract packages were awarded in July 2019, and \nconstruction  has  commenced.  An  environmental  audit  of  these  ongoing  works  has  been \nundertaken by an external environmental consultant. BESCOM and its contractors will address \nthe gaps identified between their current performance and the requirements of the environmental \nmanagement plan as corrective actions. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). The project will follow the ROWs of the existing \n50. \nroads; and all feeders, transformers, and lines are located within the ROWs. Horizontal boring \nmethodology  will  be  adopted,  not  open  trench,  to  avoid  informal  ROWs  users  and  secure \nadequate  access.  Due  diligence  confirmed  that  no  households  will  need  to  relocate,  so  no \nphysical and/or economic displacement is envisaged in the project.   \n \n51. \nBESCOM is required to inform ADB in advance about any change in scope that may result \nin temporary or permanent land acquisition, structure demolition, or involuntary resettlement, and \n\ninternational  good  practice \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n25 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n26 The IEE is based on cable routings following existing overhead line corridors; the contractor will map and confirm \nactual alignments during project implementation. Once working drawings or maps have been completed, the IEE will \nbe reviewed\u2014before proceeding with works\u2014to confirm that no changes have been made to the alignments outside \nthe existing overhead line corridors and/or affecting environmentally sensitive areas; if any unanticipated impacts are \nidentified, the IEE will be updated accordingly. Some 718 households were surveyed from April to June 2019; and \nfocus group discussions were held with 103 persons (30% female) in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f(Confidential information redacted.) \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nmust  prepare  and  submit  a  resettlement  plan  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  the \noccurrence of any displacement, following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.27 \n \n52. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The proposed project will be implemented in a large \nurban area  where  most people are  Kannadigas, and the  lifestyle and socioeconomic status  of \nindividuals of the ethnic majority and minorities are similar. All physical activities of the proposed \nproject will be undertaken within the ROWs of the existing roads. Thus, it is not expected to have \nany impacts on ethnic minorities or their territories. Due diligence confirmed that no impacts are \nenvisaged on scheduled tribes or indigenous peoples. \n \nH. \n \n53. \n \n54. \n \n55. \n \n56. \n \n57. \n \n58. \n \n59. \n \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government and the GOK have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\n \nFor  sovereign  loan.
