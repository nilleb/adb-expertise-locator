The  road  network  consists  predominantly  of \nmountainous,  unpaved,  narrow  roads,  and  many  sections  are  impassable  during  the  rainy \nseason.  Project  roads  have  been  selected  through  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(TA)3 based on social and economic indicators4 to maximize development benefits and impacts. \nThe  time  and  cost  of  traveling  from  mountainous  remote  areas  to  social  infrastructure  will  be \nreduced, and the economic activities along the roads will be increased. The project is consistent \nwith the strategic priorities of the country strategy and program, which emphasizes investments \nin infrastructure development for pro-poor economic growth.5 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  northern  mountainous  provinces  of  Viet  Nam  have  developed  at  a  much  slower \npace than the rest of the country. The project area had 30% of the population living in poverty in \n2009, which is far above the 11% average for the country. Gross domestic product per capita in \nthe  northern  mountainous  provinces  was  $400  in  2008,  compared  to  the  national  average  of \n$1,070.  Ethnic  minorities  typically  inhabit  the  more  mountainous  and  less  accessible  areas  of \nthe provinces, and account for 69% of the project area\u2019s population.6 The income level of ethnic \nminorities is below average. Women are involved mainly in agricultural activities, and transport \ntheir products to sell in local markets. Poor access to markets as well as to health, education, \nand other government services is a major constraint on socioeconomic development.  \n \n4. \nThe  government  recognizes  that  development  of  the  northern  region  of  Viet  Nam  has \nlagged  behind  the  rest  of  the  country.  The  government\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  plan7 \nidentifies lack of rural infrastructure in the region as a constraint on effective poverty reduction. \nIn support of government efforts to meet poverty reduction objectives, the country strategy and \nprogram  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  initiatives  targeted  at  the  northern \nmountainous  region  to  address  the  high  levels  of  general  and  food  poverty.  Planned \nimprovements along the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) corridors are also expected to bring \nincreased economic and employment opportunities to the region. The project areas have strong \ndemographic and economic relations with the cities that will be connected by the GMS Noi Bai\u2013\nLao Cai Highway and the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway, and the project will improve the \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  northern  mountainous  provinces  selected  for  the  project  are  Bac  Kan,  Cao  Bang,  Ha  Giang,  Tuyen  Quang, \n\nYen Bai, and Lao Cai. \n\n3   ADB. 2009.

The road  network  comprises \nmore than 256,000 km, of which the vast majority (216,000 km) are provincial and local roads. \nThese  are  mostly  in  poor condition\u2014about  52% of the  network  is  unpaved,  and  about  16%  of \nlocal  population  does  not  have  access  to  an  all-season  road.8 Unpaved  roads  often  become \nimpassable  during  the  rainy  season,  and  ordinary  automobiles  cannot  pass  along  the  project \nroads  for  140  days  in  a  year.9 The  poor  road  conditions  contribute  to  accidents  as  well  as \npavement  damage  due  to  vehicle  overloading.  The  condition  of  the  roads  discourages \ninvestments  in  the  region,  making  it  difficult  for  agricultural  production  to  expand  beyond \nsubsistence farming, or for other industries to develop.  \n \n6. \nRoad  maintenance  in  Viet  Nam  is  less  than  optimal,  mainly  due  to  insufficient  budget \nand low capacity of operation and maintenance companies.10 The Ministry of Transport (MOT) \ndefines  road  maintenance  activities  as  regular  maintenance,  periodical  repair,  and emergency \nrepair. 11  The  National  Assembly  approved  establishment  of  a  road  maintenance  fund  in \nNovember 2008. The fund was expected to provide more stable and sufficient budget for road \nmaintenance but the government is facing difficulties securing sufficient revenue and has not yet \nformulated implementation details.  \n \n7. \nThere is also a need to reduce the life-cycle cost of roads, including both development \nand maintenance costs, as funds to cover the large demand for both road rehabilitation and new \nroads  are  limited.  ADB  is  providing  policy  and  advisory  TA  for  the  MOT,  which  includes  a \ncomponent to  develop  design  guidelines  to  allow  flexible application  of road  classification.12 At \npresent,  the  same  road classification  and  corresponding  design  standards  are  usually  applied \nfrom  the  beginning  to  the  end  points  of  a  road,  regardless  of  varying  traffic  demand  and \nconditions of the road sections. Flexible application of road classification is expected to reduce \nlife-cycle costs and improve sustainability of local roads.13 Some roads under the project will be \ndesigned based on guidelines to be developed through the TA.  \n \n8. \nMost  of  the  project  roads  are  in  areas  vulnerable  to  climate  impacts,  and  the \nmountainous  terrain  (and,  therefore,  the  local  economy)  is  prone  to  natural  disaster  risks. \nFrequent  flash  floods  and  road  closures  have  negative  economic  and  social  impacts  on  road \nusers  and  residents,  and  these  impacts  are  expected  to  increase  due  to  climate  change.  The \ngovernment approved the National Target Program to respond to climate change in 2008.14 The \nMOT  approved  its  action  plan  toward  the  National  Target  Program  for  seven  subsectors \nincluding  road  transport  in  2011.15 Provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (PPCs)  are  preparing  local \naction  plans  based  on  the  National  Target  Program.  However,  past  and  current  assistance \nfocuses more on coastal areas than the northern mountainous provinces.16  \n \n                                                \n8   ADB. 2011.

Manila (TA 7779-VIE). \n\n\fThe  role  of  local  governments  in  developing  and  managing  local  roads  is  becoming \n9. \nincreasingly  important  as  the  government  decentralized  the  responsibilities  for  implementation \nof  official  development  assistance  programs  to  provincial  governments  by  a  decree  in  2006.17 \nThe project will be implemented directly by the PPCs, unlike previous projects where the MOT \nacted  as  an  executing  agency.  To  efficiently  coordinate  and  monitor  implementation  by  six \nprovincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs)  under the  PPCs,  a  joint  coordination committee \n(JCC) has been established upon the Prime Minister\u2019s authorization. This direct implementation \narrangement  will  enhance  project  ownership  and  encourage  local  government  participation  in \nimplementation,  but  it  imposes  the  need  for  some  initial  support  for  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, and other capacity building needs. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe impact of the project will be reduced poverty in the project areas. The outcome will \nbe improved and reliable road connectivity in the project areas. The project targets 12 provincial \nroads in six northern mountainous provinces in Viet Nam: Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Tuyen \nQuang, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai provinces. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  has  three  outputs:  (i)  priority  provincial  roads  totaling  304  km  will  be \n11. \nrehabilitated, including the sections for which design guidelines developed through the TA and \nclimate-proofing  measures  developed  through  the  grant  component  are  applied; 18  (ii)  the \ncapacity  of  PPC  staff  to  manage  potential  climate  change  impacts  will  be  increased;  and  (iii) \npotential  social  problems19 among  vulnerable  people,  especially  women  and  ethnic  minorities, \nwill be prevented and mitigated. \n \n12. \nA  grant  component  for  integrating  climate  change  adaptation  to  transport  will  provide \n(i) capacity building of provincial department of transport (PDOT) staff, (ii) vulnerability mapping \nof  project  roads  selected  for  rehabilitation,  (iii)  identification  and  prioritization  of  adaptation \napproaches,  (iv)  detailed  design  to  increase  the  resilience  of  the  project  roads  to  climate \nchange, and (v) policy strengthening and coordination.20  \n \nD. \n \n13. \ninterest during construction (Table 1). \n \n14. \nto \nSDR50.045 million  ($80.0  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nfinance the project.

The Bac Kan PPMU will be authorized to carry out such tasks \nas signing contracts and withdrawal applications on behalf of the JCC.  \n \n18. \nAll  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement capacity of PPMUs is assessed as fair, with \nprevious  experience  on  ADB  and  other  externally  funded  projects  although  the  MOT  was  the \noverall  executing  agency  for  them.  The  threshold  for  national  competitive  bidding  is  set  at \n$5 million.  Lessons  from  previous  provincial  road  projects  suggest  that  small  civil  works \npackages  are  inefficient  to  manage.  The  civil  works  will  be  divided  into  23  packages  (an \naverage of  $3.4  million  per  package),  based not  on  availability  of  local  contractors  or  ordinary \nsize  of  PDOTs\u2019  other  projects  but  on  topographic  and  other  relevant  parameters.  They  will  be \nprocured by national competitive bidding. \n \n19. \nFor  the  consulting  services  financed  by  ADB  funds,  consultants  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) while the cofinancier\u2019s guidelines will apply for the grant component. The Bac Kan PPMU, \non behalf of the JCC, will recruit an international consulting firm as a PCC by quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  (QCBS)  using  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10  and  full  technical  proposals  with \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  $1  million.  The  high  quality\u2013cost  ratio  is \nproposed  because  of  the  complexity  of  the  project  implementation  arrangement,  where  six \nexecuting  agencies  will  work  under  coordination  of  the  JCC  and  administration  of  ADB,  thus \ngreater  priority  is  given  to  the  quality  of  the  PCC  over  cost.

Many provincial roads across the country are deteriorating because of design standards \nthat are inadequate to support traffic loads, and inadequate routine maintenance. Maintenance \nis  underfunded,  being  at  50%  or  less  of  what  is required for the roads to  be  maintained to  an \nacceptable  standard.  The  major  problem  affecting  road  maintenance  funding  is  the  continuing \nhigh  investment  on  new  works.  Viet  Nam  is  in  the  process  of  establishing  road  maintenance \nfunds  to  improve  road  conditions  by  allocating  stable  and  sufficient  maintenance  funding.  In \naddition,  the  life-cycle  cost  of  roads  for  both  development  and  maintenance  should  be \nminimized to fully utilize the limited available funds. ADB is supporting the MOT through TA to \ndevelop  modified  guidelines  with  increased  design  flexibility  to  reduce  life-cycle  costs  and \nimprove  the  sustainability  of  roads  (footnote  12).  The  guidelines  and  the  outputs  of  the  grant \n                                                \n24  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fcomponent on climate change adaptation will be reflected in detailed engineering and design of \nproject roads where needed. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nThe project will directly benefit transport users and communities in the six provinces and \nthe  main  benefits  are  derived  from  improved  accessibility  to  better,  safer,  faster,  and  more \nreliable  transport  connections.  These  improved  transport  connections  will  increase  economic \nactivities in the project areas and provide the communities with improved access to markets and \nsocial  services.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  project  roads  ranges  from \n16.3% to 40.8%, and the economic net present value ranges from $0.65 million to $19.6 million. \nOverall, the project has a weighted average EIRR of 25.6% and economic net present value of \n$5.3 million. The sensitivity analysis shows a relatively stable EIRR. The lowest EIRR would be \n13.3%  if  the  benefits  were  reduced  by  20%.  The  analysis  also  indicates  that  the  EIRR  of  all \nproject  roads  would  be  higher  than  12%  despite  a  20%  increase  in  project  costs.  Detailed \nresults of the analysis are described in the economic and financial analyses.25  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nA governance assessment was carried out as part of the due diligence. The assessment \ncovered  the  capacities  of  the  PPMUs,  focusing  on  financial  management,  institutional  issues, \npolicies  and  procedures,  and  risks.  Governance  of  the  PPCs  will  be  improved  to  meet  the \nincreasing responsibility under decentralization. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the PPCs of Bac Kan, Cao \nBang,  Ha  Giang,  Tuyen  Quang,  Yen  Bai,  and  Lao  Cai  provinces.  In  addition,  the  provincial \ngovernments  agreed  to  implement  other  measures  to  strengthen  governance.  These  include \nestablishing a grievance redress mechanism for project-related issues, including corruption, and \ncreating a project website at the JCC to disclose information on procurement and other project-\nrelated matters to the public. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the project administration manual.26 \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n24. \nThe primary source of income of most households in the project area is agriculture. The \nmajor ethnic groups in the project area are Dao, Hmong, Nung, and Tay. In 2008, the incidence \nof poverty in Cao Bang Province was 39%, in Tuyen Quang it was 38%, in Bac Kan 31%, in Ha \nGiang 28%, in Yen Bai 24%, and in Lao Cai 21%.  \n \n25. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  To  ensure  that  women \nand ethnic minorities equally share project benefits and adverse impacts are mitigated, the GAP \nhas  been  prepared  for  Yen  Bai  Province,  while  combined  GAEMDPs  have  been  prepared  for \nthe provinces of Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Tuyen Quang, and Lao Cai. The plans include \nthe  following  actions  and  strategies:  (i)  road  hazards  will  be  identified  and  removed;  road  and \ntraffic  signs,  road  safety  warnings,  and  pedestrian  crossings  will  be  installed  in  strategic \nlocations;  and  light  poles  and  speed  bumps  will  be  installed  at  requested  locations;  (ii)  during \nconstruction,  civil  works  contractors  will  hire  at  least  20%\u201330%  local  unskilled  labor,  and  of \nthese  at  least  50%  will  be  female; male and  female unskilled  workers (regardless of  ethnicity) \nwill receive equal pay for equal work; and separate male and female latrines and basic facilities \n\n                                                \n25  Economic and Financial Analyses (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fwill  be  provided  in  the  construction  sites;  (iii)  community-based  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking, \nand  road  safety  campaigns  will  be  implemented;  and  (iv)  vulnerability  mapping  for  climate \nchange impacts  will  integrate  gender  issues,  and 25%  of the  PPMU  staff  attending  adaptation \nseminars will be female. Materials to be used during the campaign and when training facilitators, \nand  other  forms  of  communications  such  as  using  loudspeakers  and  presenting  plays  during \nmarket  days,  will  be  gender-responsive  and  culturally  and  linguistically  appropriate.  Gender-\ndisaggregated data will be collected during implementation and monitoring.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  A  under  indigenous  peoples  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  ethnic  minorities  in  the  remote  areas,  especially  in \nthose  that  are  difficult  to  access  by  road  during  the  rainy  season,  are  particularly  poor.  Road \nimprovement  will  greatly  benefit the  ethnic minority  groups  but  there are also increased  social \nrisks.  As  indicated  in  para.  25,  GAEMDPs  for  Bac  Kan,  Cao  Bang,  Ha  Giang,  Tuyen  Quang, \nand Lao Cai provinces have been designed in a culturally and linguistically gender-responsive \nway.  The  plans  will  be  translated  into  ethnic  minority  languages  since  a  critical  source  of \nvulnerability  among  women  from  ethnic  minority  groups  is  language,  which  isolates  these \nwomen and reduces income-generating opportunities. Data disaggregated by ethnic group will \nbe collected during implementation and monitoring.   \n \n27. \nResettlement  impacts  are  not  significant  and  are  classified  category  B.  Although  about \n4,700  households  are  affected  by  land  acquisition,  no  households  are  losing  10%  or  more  of \ntheir total productive assets. Impacts on structures are limited as houses and shops will be only \npartially  affected.  There  will  be  no  impacts  on  common  property  resources,  and  access  to \nproperties  and  economic  opportunities  will  not  be  restricted  during  project  construction  and \noperation.  Key  information  in  the  resettlement  plans  has  been  disclosed  to  the  affected \nhouseholds  through  distribution  of  information  leaflets  in  Vietnamese  or  local  ethnic  minority \nlanguages  during  market  days  in  the  communes  prior  to  submission  to  ADB  for  review  and \nconcurrence.   \n \n28. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  category  B  under  environment.  Results  of  the  IEEs \nconducted  for  each  province  showed  that  the  proposed  road  improvement  works  will  result  in \nminor  environmental  impacts.  The  biological  environment  is  dominated  by  agriculture, \nproduction forests, and tree plantations around most stretches of the project roads. None of the \nproject roads traverses buffer or core zones of ecologically or culturally protected areas. While \nthe  whole  of  project  road  176A  in  Ha  Giang  Province  is  within  the  Dong  Van  Karst  Plateau \nGeopark\u2014an  area  recognized  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization \nlandscape  and  geological \nsignificance\u2014no significant adverse impacts are expected as the project will be undertaken on \nan existing road that only requires minimal widening (up to 1 meter). During the detailed design \nphase, the Ha Giang PPMU will consult the geopark\u2019s management board and will compile the \nrequisite project report to obtain UNESCO\u2019s concurrence.  \n \nThe adverse environmental impacts will be largely experienced during construction due \n29. \nto  spoil  and  waste  disposal,  traffic  interruption,  potential  disruption  of  water  and  power  supply \nutilities, and elevated levels of noise and dust. The works will be of short duration, causing only \nmoderate disturbance to the surrounding areas provided the EMPs are fully implemented. The \nEMPs  provide  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  to  avoid  or  reduce  anticipated \nnegative project impacts.  \n \n\n(UNESCO)  and  promoted \n\ninternationally \n\nfor \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\finvolved \n\nEach  PPMU  will  have  environmental  staff  who  will  be \n\nin  ensuring \n30. \nimplementation of the EMPs. The PPMUs will be assisted by the environmental specialists to be \nengaged by the international PCC. The national construction supervision consultant under each \nprovince will undertake day-to-day supervision to ensure that the EMP is properly implemented \nby  contractors.  The  international  PCC  will  assist  the  PPMUs  in  (i)  ensuring  that  tender  and \ncontract  documents  for  civil  works  include  the  EMPs,  (ii)  monitoring  implementation  of  the \nmitigation measures for design and construction phases, and (iii) undertaking training of PPMU \nstaff  on  environmental  management  as  well  as  orientation  of  contractors  on  EMP \nimplementation. Public consultations were conducted during IEE preparation with stakeholders, \nsuch  as  local  residents  and  local  government  officials.  Results,  which  are  documented  in  the \nIEEs,  indicate  strong  support  for  the  project.  The  main  environmental  concerns  were  noise, \ndust,  and  interference  with  water  and  power  supplies  during  construction.  The  IEEs  have \naddressed these issues and concerns raised by the stakeholders.  \n \n31. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  information  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements,  the \nGAP,  GAEMDPs,  resettlement  plans,  and IEEs  will  be  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  A  grievance \nredress mechanism has been developed and included in the safeguard documents to facilitate \nresolution  of  complaints  regarding  the  performance  of  the  project.  The  PPMUs  will  establish \nsuch mechanism prior to commencement of the project activities.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32. \nKey project risks include (i) inadequate budget allocation for maintenance of the project \nroads, (ii) damage to the project roads from extreme weather events and overloaded vehicles, \n(iii)  cost  overrun, (iv)  insufficient  capacity  of  PPMUs,  and  (v)  delay caused  by incorporation of \noutputs  from  the  TA  (for  flexible  design  guidelines)  or  grant  component  (for  climate  change \nadaptation).  The  government  has  agreed  to  implement  mitigating  measures  to  address  these \nrisks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nProvinces do not have sufficient \nbudget to maintain project roads \nadequately. \n\nMitigating Measures \nFlexible design standards to reduce the life-cycle cost of roads will be \nreflected  in  detailed  engineering  and  design  of  project  roads  where \nneeded. \n\nExtreme weather events and \noverloaded vehicles damage \nproject roads. \n\nThe  loan  agreement  includes  an  assurance  that  the  provinces  will \nallocate adequate budget for operation and maintenance. \n\nAdaptation  measures  to  climate  change  impacts  will  be  studied  and \ntested in selected roads. \n\nPortable  truck-axle  scales  will  be  provided,  and  the  loan  agreement \nincludes  an  assurance  that  the  provinces  will  take  load  enforcement \nmeasures. \n\nThe scope of works is reduced \ndue to increased costs. \n\nBill  of  quantities  for  cost  estimate  has  been  updated  from  the  project \npreparatory  TA  output  based  on  the  basic  design  of  the  provincial \ndepartments of transport. \n\n                                                \n27  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks \nCapacity of provincial project \nmanagement units to implement \nthe project is insufficient. \n\nMitigating Measures \nInitial  training  for  capacity  development  will  be  conducted  based  on \nthe  assessment  on  procurement,  financial  management,  and  other \ncapacity. \n\nKey  joint  coordination  committee  members  will  be  involved  in  the \nworking groups established for the TA. \n\nMemorandum  of  understanding  to  ensure  implementing  coordination \nwith the Nordic Development Fund has been signed.  \n\nIncorporation of outputs from the \npolicy and advisory TA for \ndesign guidelines and grant \ncomponent for climate change \nadaptation delays the project \nimplementation. \n\nTA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n33. \nThe  government  and  the  PPCs  of  Bac  Kan,  Cao  Bang,  Ha  Giang,  Tuyen  Quang,  Yen \nBai, and Lao Cai provinces have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform \nto all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. \n \n34. \nThe  government  and  the  PPCs  of  Bac  Kan,  Cao  Bang,  Ha  Giang,  Tuyen  Quang,  Yen \nBai, and Lao Cai provinces have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the  project, which \nare set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n35. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR50,045,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Transport \nConnections  in  Northern  Mountainous  Provinces  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter;  for  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 years;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n6 September 2011 \n \n \n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nReduced poverty in \nthe project areas  \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \nBy 2020: \nNumber of poor \nhouseholds in the districts \nalong selected project \nroads reduced by 50% \n(2009 baseline: 4,064)a \n\nOutcome \n \nImproved and reliable \nroad connectivity in \nthe project areas with \nincreased resilience \nto climate change \n\nOutputs \n\n1.
