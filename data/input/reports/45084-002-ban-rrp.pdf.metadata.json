The project will integrate climate change adaptation \nand disaster risk reduction into policy formulation and infrastructure development.  \n\n4. \nBangladesh  is  one  of  the  most  vulnerable  countries  to  climate  variability  and  change \nbecause of its geographic location, low deltaic floodplain, hydro-meteorological influence of erratic \nmonsoon  rainfall,  and  other  extreme  climate  events.  Climate  change  threatens  the  significant \nachievements  made  by  Bangladesh  since  1990  in  raising  incomes  and  reducing  poverty.  By \n2050, climate change impact could make an additional 14% of the country extremely vulnerable \nto flooding and dislocate more than 35 million people in coastal districts. About 87% of roads in \nthe country will be substantially inundated as a result of climate change by 2050.6 The low-lying \ncoastal  zone  of  the  country  is  highly  vulnerable  both to  the  normal  tidally  enhanced  monsoon \nfloods  and  to  regular  impact  from  tropical  cyclones.  About  58  tropical  cyclones  impacted \nBangladesh  during  1960\u20132010,  with  severe  effect  on  coastal  areas.  Salinity  intrusion  and  an \nincrease  in  salinity  resulting  from  climate  change  are  affecting  agricultural  productivity  and \nlivelihood in coastal areas.  \n  \nIn  Bangladesh,  climate  change  will  aggravate  storm-surge-related  inundation. 7  The \n5. \nsurges will be elevated by a rising sea level as thermal expansion occurs and ice caps continue \nto melt.  A  warmer  ocean  is  likely  to  intensify  cyclone  activity  and thus  heighten  storm  surges. \nThe  destructive  impact  of  storm  surges  will  generally  be  greater  when  the  surges  are \naccompanied by strong winds and large onshore waves. Larger storm surges threaten greater \nfuture  destruction  because  they  will  increase  the  depth  of  inundation  and  will  move  farther \n\n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   These  districts  are  Bagerhat,  Barguna,  Barisal,  Bhola,  Gopalganj,  Jhalokati,  Khulna,  Madaripur,  Patuakhali, \n\nPerojpur, Satkhira, and Shariatpur.  \n\n4   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Bangladesh\u2019s vulnerability may increase even \nmore  as  evidence  points  toward  a  probable  increase  in  the  frequency  of  intense  tropical \ncyclones in the Bay of Bengal.  \n \nThe  predicted  climate  changes  will  increase the  current  infrastructure  vulnerability  as a \n6. \nresult  of  sea  level  rise,  increased  wet  season  rainfall,  increased  annual  temperatures,  and \nincreased  frequency  of  severe  cyclones.  Recent  predictions  derived  from  Intergovernmental \nPanel  on  Climate  Change  modeling,8 based  on  minimum  and  maximum  emission  scenarios, \nshow temperatures rising by 1.9\u00b0C\u20132.4\u00b0C and wet season rainfall increasing by 9%\u201310%.9 The \nincrease in temperature has  the potential  to  cause  material  expansion,  resulting  in  damage to \nconcrete  structures  such  as  buildings,  bridges,  and  culverts.  Bitumen  seals  to  roads  may  be \nsusceptible to softening unless higher temperature resistant bitumens are used. Floods resulting \nfrom  increased  rainfall,  cyclones,  and  storm  surges  have  the  potential  to  damage  road \nembankments,  markets,  and  housing.  Increasingly  severe  storm  events  will  also  increase  the \npotential  flood-related  damage  as  well  as  cause  additional  erosion  damage  from  the  over-\ntopping  of  road  embankments.  High  winds  associated  with  storm  events  have  the  potential  to \ndamage  buildings,  as  well  as  cause  secondary  damage  from  trees  and  other  debris.  Wind-\ndriven  wave  action  can  have  a  significant  erosive  effect  on  exposed  road  embankments  and \nbridge  abutments.  The  culmination  of  these  impacts  will  be  a  rapid  deterioration  of  rural \ninfrastructure. \n \n7. \nPredictions  of  the  yearly  relative  sea  level  rise  for  coastal  Bangladesh  range  from \n1.5 millimeters (mm)/year to 10 mm/year, with a recent estimate of 7 mm/year being adopted by \nthe World Bank (footnote 7). A general relative sea level rise of 7 mm/year has been taken for \nassessment of typical subprojects in the project. The effective sea level rise is a combination of \nrelative  sea  level  rise  and  land  subsidence.  The  land  subsidence  has  been  estimated  at \n2 mm/year\u20134 mm/year within the project region. For typical subproject assessment, an average \nland subsidence rate of 3 mm/year has been adopted. The adopted figures for a 20-year road \ndesign  life  are  140  mm  of  relative  sea  level  rise,  plus  60  mm  of  subsidence,  giving  a  total \neffective  sea  level  rise  of  200  mm.  This  200  mm,  with  the  standard  600  mm  freeboard  figure \n(minimum road pavement crest level above the normal annual flood level), forms the basis for \nthe  target  levels  for  each  road  surface  within  the  project.  The  cost  of  upgrading  of  roads  and \nmarket to future climate change standard is 30%\u201340% higher than current practices.10 \n \n8. \nPoverty  is  extensive  in  the  country  and  more  so  in rural  areas.  Although  declining,  the \nnational  poverty  rate  is  still  31.5%.11 Within  the  project  rural  areas,  poverty  incidence  is  35%\u2013\n39%, which is higher than the national average. The achievement in poverty reduction can be \npartly attributed to improved rural infrastructure, including roads and markets. The overall traffic \nvolume  has  been  growing  at  10.5%  a  year, faster  than  the growth  in gross  domestic  product  of \nover 6%. Improved roads provide more comfortable travel, lower transport costs, and significant \nsavings  in  vehicle  operating  costs.  With  further  upgrading  of  the  country\u2019s  road  network,  the \ndemand for road transport will continue to rise. However, there is an increasing risk that climate \n\n                                                \n8   S. Solomon, D. Qin, M. Manning, Z. Chen, M. Marquis, K.B. Averyt, M. Tignor, and H.L.

The maintenance and damage \nrepair requirements of such roads will increase with climate change. For many road sections, the \ncross-drainage  systems  are  inadequate,  with  poorly  maintained  canals  and  drains  not  having \nenough  hydraulic  capacities  to  discharge  flows  efficiently  to  sluice-gated  outlets  through \nembankments.  This  causes  substantial  waterlogging  of  adjacent  land,  adversely  affecting  land \nuse;  this  will  worsen  with  climate  change.  For  rural  markets,  maintenance  and  damage  repair \nrequirements, with spoilage and wastage of perishable goods, will also rise with climate change. \nAs demonstrated by recent cyclone events, the capacities of cyclone shelters and livestock refuge \nfacilities  are  insufficient.  Many  existing  cyclone  shelters  also  have  vulnerable  access  roads  and \npower supplies and inadequate water supply and sanitation facilities, which often are not usable \nduring emergency conditions.   \n \nFarmers,  especially  poor  and  small-scale  farmers,  suffer  from  a  wide  range  of \n10. \nconstraints that limit their livelihoods. Lack of all-weather road connectivity limits their access to \nmarkets,  increases  the  cost  of  production  because  of  higher  transportation  costs,  lowers \ncommodity  prices  owing  to remoteness,  and  hinders  access to education  and health  services. \nPoor  road  connectivity  also  restricts  their  access  to  financial  services,  technology,  and \ndevelopment  support  services  provided  by  various  agencies.  During  extreme  climatic  events, \nthe poor lose their assets as well as livelihood options. Often after extreme conditions, men tend \nto  migrate,  leaving  their  families  behind.  Poverty  incidence  is  widespread,  with  many \nhouseholds headed by women. The women are more vulnerable because of (i) poorer access to \neducation and health services, and economic opportunities; (ii) limited mobility; and (iii) various \nsocial restraints. \n \nThe development strategy of Bangladesh is linked to upgrading rural infrastructure, with \n11. \na  focus  on  road  connectivity.  The  country\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan  for  FY2011\u2013FY2015 \nunderscores \ninfrastructure,  climate  resilience,  and  adaptation \nmeasures.12 ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh,  2011\u20132015  emphasizes  the \nneed  for  integration  of  climate  change  consideration  into  sector  interventions  and  climate-\nproofing infrastructure.13 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which advocates \nrural  infrastructure development  and climate-proofing.14 The  project  will  address many  lessons \nfrom  implementing  past  and  ongoing  rural  infrastructure  projects  in  Bangladesh  supported  by \nADB  and  development  partners,  including  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development \n(IFAD)  and  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW.  These  include  undertaking \nsustainable  operation  and  maintenance,  climate-proofing  of  infrastructure,  robust  and  effective \nquality control arrangements, and sharpening focus on capacity development.   \n  \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nimportance  of  rural \n\nthe \n\n12. \nThe  impact  will  be  improved  livelihoods  in  rural  coastal  districts  vulnerable  to  climate \nchange.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  climate  resilience  of  coastal  infrastructure  in  12  rural \ncoastal districts, benefiting the poor and women.  \n                                                \n12  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Planning  Commission,  Ministry  of  Planning.  2011.

The project will upgrade 130 kilometers (km) \n14. \nof  upazila  (subdistrict)  roads,  including  780 meters  of  bridges  and culverts.  Complementary  to \nthis output, IFAD will provide parallel financing to upgrade 174 km of union roads, and 233 km \nof  village  roads  including  2,270  meters  of  bridges  and  culverts.  Together,  these  interventions \nare  aimed  at  providing  year-round  connectivity  between  agricultural  production  areas  and \nmarkets and to other parts of the country. Road upgrading will involve improving existing roads \nto  climate-resilient  standards  and  widening  and  rising  of  embankments,  with  suitable  slope \nprotection  against  erosion  and  wave  action.  The  underpinning  thrust  will  be  on  adequate \nearthworks,  proper  pavements,  and  cross  drainage  construction.  The  road  crest  level  will  be \n800 mm above the normal annual flood level, with an extra height of 200 mm that will be added \nfor the effective sea level rise to the standard 600 mm freeboard. The  embankment protection \nwill  mainly  involve  a  combination  of  turf  and  shrubs,  geotechnical  measures  where  there  is  a \nhigh risk of active erosion, and increased cross drainage.  \n \n15. \nSustainability  of  upgraded  roads.  Sustainability  of  the  improved  roads  will  be \naddressed  by  climate-resilient  design,  application  of  effective  quality  assurance  during \nconstruction, allocating the road maintenance planning and supervision to a suitable person in \neach  district,  and  preparing  road  maintenance  plans.  Women  belonging  to  labor  contracting \nsocieties  will  be  engaged  to  clean  out  drainage  canals,  plant  trees  on  roadsides  and  proper \nvegetation  on  embankments,  and  undertake  routine  road  maintenance  works.15 Road  safety \nmeasures  such  as  road  signs,  delineators  and  bollards  near  the  approach  to  bridges  and \nreflectors  carved  in  tree  trunks,  and  provision  of  loading  and  unloading  zones  will  be \nincorporated within the road designs. A road safety campaign for vulnerable users will also be a \npart of project road safety activities.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Improved Market Services  \n\n16. \nUpgraded  growth  centers  and  large  markets.  The  project  will  upgrade  88  growth \ncenters  and  large  markets,  with  15%  of  space  allocated  to  women.  Each  market  will  be \nconnected  to  an  existing  paved  road  or  to  one  of  those  to  be  improved  under  the  project. \nInfrastructure improvements include paved trading areas, sheds, water supply system, drainage \nfacilities,  sanitation  facilities,  and  market  offices.  At  each  market,  a  market  management \ncommittee  comprising  representatives  of  shop  owners  will  be  responsible  for  planning,  and \noperation  and  maintenance  of  markets.  In  selected  large  markets,  mini  water  supply,  deep \nhand-operated  tube  wells,  and  sweet  water  ponds  with  pond  sand  filters  where  groundwater \nquality is problematic will be installed. In three growth center markets, shops owned by women, \ntoilets,  and  street  lighting  will  be  supplied  with  electricity  using  solar  photovoltaic  cells.16 The \nbeneficiaries  will  be  trained  in  the  judicious  use  and  maintenance  of  the  system,  and  the \n\n                                                \n15  Labor  contracting  societies  comprise  poor  women  with  limited  income-earning  capabilities  who  carry  out  routine \nmaintenance on rural roads using basic hand tools and materials supplied by  the Local Government Engineering \nDepartment (LGED). \n\n16 Selection  criteria  for  these  markets  include  no  existing  or  near-future  plan  for  Rural  Electrification  Board  power \nsupply, acceptable and viable arrangements for operation and maintenance, and equitable geographic distribution. \n\n \n\n\fbeneficiaries  will  bear  the  responsibility  for  maintaining  the  system  via  maintenance  charges. \nSome key  elements  within growth  centers  or  large markets  such  as  new market  sheds  will  be \nmade  climate-resilient.  These  will  be  raised  on  concrete  plinths  to  a  level  above  the  existing \nmaximum  normal  monsoon  high-tide  level  plus  the  effective  maximum  sea  level  rise,  with  an \nadditional 250 mm freeboard. The central market area to be paved will be at maximum sea level \nrise plus 100 mm freeboard, with adequate drainage capacity included in the designs. Access to \nthe market will be above normal flood level.  \n\n  \nUpgraded village markets and collection points. Complementary to this output, IFAD \n17. \nwill  provide  parallel  financing  to  upgrade  186  community  markets,  add  11  women\u2019s  market \nsections in existing community markets, and build 37 boat landing ghats (platforms) to climate \nchange  standards.  The  market  improvements  will  include  a  common  shed,  fish  shed,  open \npaved/raised area, women\u2019s section, toilet block and internal drainage, and building commodity \ncollection points. Labor contracting society members and market management committees will \nbe trained to foster community market development.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Enhanced Climate Change Adaptation Capacity    \n\n18. \nUpgraded climate disaster shelters. KfW will provide parallel financing to construct or \nextend 15 multipurpose cyclone shelters, improve 10 existing cyclone shelters, upgrade 15 km \nof cyclone shelter access tracks, and construct five killas (animal shelters). The designs will take \ninto account climate change effects and strict compliance to building codes with respect to wind \nloading and floor bearing capacities. Emphasis will be on ensuring adequate water storage and \nsustainable  power  supply  and  appropriate  toilet  facilities,  which  can  be  used  during  extreme \nclimatic  events.  Access  roads/tracks  will  be  upgraded  to  the  equivalent  of  village  road  climate \nresilience standard.  \n \n19. \nEnhanced  knowledge  management.  A  framework  for  expanding  institutional  learning \nand  knowledge  sharing  will  be  developed.  This  will  entail  more  effective  knowledge  capture, \ncompilation,  storage,  and  sharing  on  climate  resilience  principles  for  the  design,  construction, \nand  maintenance  of  rural  infrastructure.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  management  and \ngeographic  information  systems  of  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED), \ndevelop  a  special  web  portal  interface  for  learning  and  networking  with  other  agencies,  and \nsupport establishing a community of practice.  \n \nEnhanced  capacity.17 The  capability  of  LGED  staff,  local  government  units  and  target \n20. \ngroups will be strengthened to better prepare and manage  climate-resilient rural infrastructure. \nCapacity  development  training  will  include  climate  resilience  and  disaster  risk  management, \ncontract  management,  procurement  including  international  competitive  bidding,  financial \nmanagement, construction supervision, quality control, operation and maintenance, gender and \ndevelopment, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans   \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $150.0  million  (Table  1),  which  includes  incremental \n21. \ncosts for enhanced resilience to climate change. The cost of upgrading to future climate change \nstandards is 30%\u201340% higher than current practices.  \n \n\n                                                \n17 This subcomponent will be financed by the SCF, IFAD, and KfW. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

A  project steering  committee  will \nprovide policy guidance for project implementation. A project management office (PMO), to be \nestablished  by  the  LGED  at  its  headquarters  in  Dhaka,  will  implement  the  project.  The  chief \nengineer of the LGED will be responsible for project implementation and coordination. The PMO \nwill  have  one  office  in  each  of  the  three  project  regions.  A  project  director  in  Dhaka  will  be \nassisted by two deputy project directors; the regional project offices will  be responsible for the \nday-to-day  implementation  and  supervision  of  project  activities.  The  LGED  district  offices, \nheaded  by  executive  engineers,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  subprojects  under  the \nguidance of the PMO. The PMO will coordinate with Bangladesh Water Development Board for \ndevelopment  interventions.  The  LGED  will  appoint  two  groups  of  consultants:  (i)  design  and \nsupervision  consultants,  and  (ii)  management  support  consultants.  The  LGED  has  strong \ninstitutional  capacity;  its  capacity  in  international  competitive  bidding  procurement  will  be \nstrengthened  through  procurement  training  and  clinics  to  be  conducted  by  ADB\u2019s  Bangladesh \nResident Mission. \n \n24. \nthe project administration manual.19  \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement (financed by \nADB and/or SCF)a  \n \nConsulting services  \n \nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting for ADB or \nSCF financing \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2013\u2013December 2018 \n31 December 2018  \n\nProject steering committee \nChair: Secretary, Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local \nGovernment, Rural Development and Cooperatives \nLGED  \nLGED divisional, regional, district, and upazila (subdistrict) offices \n\nProject management office (Dhaka) \nRegional project offices (Barisal, Khulna, and Madaripur)  \nProject implementation units (12 districts) \nInternational competitive bidding \n\n2 contracts \n\n$12 million \n\n959 person-months \n194 person-months \n\nNational competitive bidding/shopping  14 contracts \nQCBS (quality\u2013cost ratio: 90:10) \nQCBS (quality\u2013cost ratio: 90:10) \nADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on request \n(i) advance contracting of civil works, equipment and materials, and \nconsulting services; and (ii) retroactive financing of eligible expenditures up \nto 20% of each of proposed loans and grant, incurred prior to loan and \ngrant effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of signing \nof the related legal agreement.

Bidding packages procured using national competitive bidding \nmay follow the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act, 2006 and Public Procurement Rules, 2008 with modifications \nagreed  between  the  government  and  ADB,  as  set  out  in  the  procurement  plan.  All  consulting  services  will  be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic  analysis  indicates  that  the  project  is  viable.  The  economic  analysis  includes \n25. \nonly  quantifiable  benefits  associated  with  rural  roads  and  markets.  There  are,  however, \nsignificant  nonquantifiable  benefits  including  improvements  in  access  to  economic  and  social \nopportunities.  Representative  upazila  and  village  road  subprojects  were  analyzed  to  estimate \nviability for three scenarios: upgrading to current LGED standards, upgrading to existing climate \nresilience standards, and upgrading to future climate resilience standards. Based on upgrading \nto  the  highest  level  (future  climate  resilience),  and  allowing  for  the  project  overhead  and  land \nacquisition costs, economic internal rates of return are estimated at 14.0% for the upazila road, \n17.1%  for  the  village  road,  16.7%  for  the  growth  center  market,  and  28.7%  for  the  village \nmarket. The sensitivity analysis confirms that the subprojects are extremely robust. Distribution \nanalyses confirm that the overall project will provide substantial benefits to the poor. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\n26. \nProject-specific governance risks have been analyzed by carrying out a governance risk \nassessment. A thorough assessment of the financial management and procurement capacities \nof the LGED was undertaken, and a set of realistic risk mitigation measures has been proposed \nand  discussed  with  the  government.  Risks  associated  with  project  management,  including \nprocurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) providing consulting inputs to advise and \nassist in the procurement of goods and services; (ii) requiring that civil works contracts include a \ncondition  that  contractors  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date); \n(iii) the  PMO  periodically  inspecting  the  contractor\u2019s  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and \n(iv) reporting  on  project  activities  and  implementation  on  the  LGED  website  to  foster \ntransparency  and  timely  awarding  of  contracts.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  LGED.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.  \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nThe project will help reduce poverty in the rural communities it covers. The beneficiaries \nwill  be  (i) road  users  (i.e.,  bus  and  truck  owners  and  operators,  passengers,  and  businesses \nusing freight services); (ii) market operators, traders, and market users; and (iii) communities in \nthe areas of influence of subprojects who will have improved access to services and increased \nemployment opportunities. An estimated 3.5 million people will directly benefit from the project. \nThe analysis of subproject roads indicates that the proportion of poor benefiting is 40%\u201346%. In \n\n \n\n\faddition  to the  direct  and  indirect  benefits from subprojects,  jobs  will  be  created  as  a result  of \nsubproject construction. This is estimated at 10,200 person-years, of which at least 20% will be \nfor women. The project will also generate long-term and regular jobs for poor women belonging \nto labor contracting societies. Cyclone shelters will contribute to save human life and livestock in \nperiods  of  extreme  climatic  events.  The  project  has  been  categorized  an  effective  gender \nmainstreaming  project.  A  gender  action  plan  has  been  prepared  integrating  action  areas, \ntargets, and indicators for gender equality and women\u2019s benefits into the project components. A \nfocal  point  on  gender  and  development  will  be  established  within  the  PMO  to  ensure  that  the \nmanagement  information  system  is  designed  to  handle  sex-disaggregated  data  collection, \ngender-based  analysis,  and  review  and  reporting  on  the  implementation  of  the  gender  action \nplan.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nD. \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement \n\nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework, \n28. \ninitial  environmental  examinations,  and  environmental  management  plans \nfor  sample \nsubprojects have been prepared. The framework sets out the requirements for project screening \nand  classification,  subproject  selection,  information  disclosure  to  and  consultation  with  the \naffected people, environmental management plan development, implementation, and monitoring \nand  reporting.  The  initial  environmental  examinations  found  the  planned  subprojects  to  have \nonly  small  and  localized  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment,  which  can  be  managed  by  the \nmitigation measures proposed in the environmental management plans.  \n \n29. \nland  acquisition  and  physical \n(category  A).  Some \ndisplacement  will  be  required  on  many  of  the  road  subprojects  as  they  will  be  raised  and \nwidened to provide climate resilience. Land acquisition and resettlement will be negligible under \nthe  market  and  cyclone  shelter  components,  as  construction  is  expected  to  remain  within \nexisting  boundaries or  on government  lands. The  government  expects much  of the  land  to  be \nacquired  through  voluntary  donation.  As  refusal  to  donate  land  or  enter  into  a  negotiated \nfinancial settlement would lead to expropriation (to retain climate-resilient design integrity), any \nsubproject that entails land acquisition (either through voluntary or involuntary means) resulting \nin  economic  or  physical  displacement  will  be  subject  to  a  resettlement  plan.  As  the  project  is \nsector-oriented and most of the subprojects are not yet selected, a resettlement framework has \nbeen  prepared.  This  will  guide  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  activities  across  the  project.  Resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  two \nsample subprojects, which can be used as examples for future planning.  \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Project  preparation  indicated  that  no  indigenous \ncommunities  will  be  impacted  by  any  of  the  three  sample  subprojects  analyzed.  Given  that \nmany more subprojects will be designed and undertaken over the course of the project and the \nproject  area  contains  small  numbers  of  distinct  and  vulnerable  indigenous  communities,  an \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework 20 has  been  developed  to  guide  the  screening  and \nplanning  process  during  implementation.  The  LGED  has  strong  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment for managing social risks and project compliance with ADB information disclosure \nbecause  of  wide  experience  in  implementing  similar  ADB-supported  projects.  The  proposed \ncapacity development program as part of the project design will further enhance its capacity. \n \n31. \nthe same environmental and social safeguard standards as those financed by ADB. \n\nIFAD and KfW will require that the subprojects financed by them in parallel comply with \n\n                                                \n20 Referred to in the legal agreements as a small ethnic communities planning framework.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32. \nThe  project  involves  some  risks,  which  are  manageable  and  will  be  largely  mitigated \nduring implementation (Table 4). The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \nthe costs.   \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementation delays, including \ndisruptions during the upcoming \ngovernment elections \nLack of sustainability of \ninterventions  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n\nMitigating Measures \nPotential delays in project start-up will be reduced by taking advance \naction on contracting of civil works and consulting services.  \n\nSustainability will be addressed by climate-resilient design, robust \nand effective quality control arrangements during construction, and \npreparing road maintenance plans. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n\n33. \nThe  government  and  the  LGED  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  and  grant  documents.  The  government  and  the \nLGED have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan \nand  grant  agreements.
