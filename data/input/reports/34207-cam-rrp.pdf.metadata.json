It is critically in need of post-conflict\nreconstruction.  What  limited  rural  infrastructure  exists  is  in  poor\ncondition  and  needs  rehabilitation.  The  Project  will  provide  rural\ninfrastructure to support socioeconomic development. It will extend\nthe network of rural roads to improve access to isolated rural areas.\nOnce year-round access has been secured, the Project will also\nfund other social infrastructure at district and village levels (schools,\nhealth facilities, markets, water supply and sanitation schemes, rice\ndrying and storage facilities, community buildings, etc.). It will give\npriority to pro-poor public infrastructure investments identified by the\nbeneficiaries  who  will  be  involved  them  in  the  construction,\nmaintenance, and operation of these civil works. It will enhance the\ncapacity of those associated with the planning, design, construction,\nmaintenance,  and  ongoing  monitoring  of  impact  from  these\ninitiatives, from both the private and public sectors. The Project will\nhelp the vulnerable groups to benefit from these interventions so\nthat their livelihood conditions and income-generating opportunities\nwill be enhanced.\nClassification Primary: Poverty intervention\nThematic: Human development\nEnvironmental Category B\nAssessment An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken.\nRationale After  nearly  three  decades  of  armed  conflict,  northwestern\nCambodia is now in transition from a region requiring humanitarian\nrelief and emergency interventions to one requiring investment for\nsustainable long-term development. One legacy of war is a fractured\nsociety that is progressively resettling into formerly occupied and\nnew areas where basic infrastructure is limited. The incidence of\npoverty, however defined, is higher in northwestern rural Cambodia\nthan  in  most  parts  of  the  country.  Even  though  the  region  is\nfrequently  mine  contaminated,  it  still  attracts  many  new  settlers\n(internally  displaced  persons,  repatriated  refugees,  internal\nmigrants, and formally or informally demobilized soldiers) because\nof  its  abundant  land  resources.  A  necessary  prerequisite  to\naddressing the causes of poverty in rural Cambodia in general, and\nthe northwestern provinces in particular, is access. A functional road\nnetwork  is  the  lifeblood  of  the  rural  economy  and  social\ndevelopment. It is a precondition to the provision of socioeconomic\ndevelopment initiatives that will, in turn, provide the rural population\nwith  access  to  social  infrastructure,  markets,  income-generating\nopportunities, and social services.", "iii\nObjective The primary objective of the Project is to support the Government\u2019s\nand Scope effort to reduce poverty through accelerated rural development by\nestablishing  physical  infrastructure,  improving  socioeconomic\nconditions,  and  enhancing  rural  livelihood  in  northwestern\nCambodia.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  Project  will  (i)  plan,\nrehabilitate or establish, and maintain public rural infrastructure that\nwill contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of the rural\npopulation;  (ii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  communities  and\ninstitutions  to  identify,  prioritize,  plan,  implement,  coordinate,\nmonitor, and maintain infrastructure investments and development\ninitiatives;  and  (iii)  support  and  facilitate  access  to  appropriate\nsavings  and  credit  mechanisms  for  enhancing  livelihood  and\nincome-generating  activities  at  village  and  commune  levels.  The\nProject has three components: (i) rural infrastructure development\u2013\nextending  the  rural  road  network  and  establishing  social\ninfrastructure at district level (schools, health facilities, and markets);\n(ii) capacity building\u2013enhancing the capacity of those in both the\nprivate  and  public  sectors  associated  with  the  planning,  design,\nconstruction,  maintenance,  and  ongoing  monitoring  of  project\nactivities;  and  (iii)  rural  livelihood  enhancement\u2013involving  and\nempowering  the  beneficiaries,  establishing  small-scale  rural\ninfrastructure at village level (water supply and sanitation schemes,\nrice drying and storage facilities, community meeting halls, etc.), and\nestablishing savings and credit initiatives at village and community\nlevels.\nCost Estimates The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $34.73  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  $11.85  million  (34  percent)  in  foreign  exchange  and\napproximately  $22.78  million  equivalent  (66  percent)  in  local\ncurrency costs.\nFinancing Plan\n ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Cost Percent\nExchange Currency\nGovernment - 7.40 7.40 21.30\nAsian  11.80 15.30 27.20 78.30\nDevelopment\nBank\nBeneficiaries        0.05 0.08 0.13 0.40\n      Total 11.85 22.78 34.73 100.00\nLoan Amount and The loan will be the equivalent of $27.2 million in Special Drawing\nTerms Rights from the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) Special Funds\nresources, with a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8\nyears, and an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during the\ngrace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2007", "iv\nExecuting Agency The Ministry of Rural Development\nImplementation The overall project implementation period is five years. The Project\nArrangements implementation arrangements will conform with the decentralization\nand deconcentration policy adopted by the Government. A project\nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established in Sisophon, the capital\nof Banteay Meanchey Province. The PMU will be responsible for\nday-to-day management of the Project. In the provincial department\nof  rural  development,  in  each  of  the  four  project  provinces,  a\nprovincial implementation unit (PIU) will be established and will be\nresponsible for day-to-day management of project activities at the\nprovincial level. The Project is multisectoral in nature; coordination\nwill be achieved through the respective provincial rural development\ncommittees already established in each target province. A team of\ninternational and domestic consultants will support both the PMU\nand PIUs.\nProcurement Civil  work  contracts  for  rural  roads  and  other  large-scale\ninfrastructure  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive\nbidding  (LCB)  procedures  among  prequalified  private  local\ncontractors in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement\nand other government procedures acceptable to ADB. For small-\nscale civil works of less than $10,000, procurement on the basis of\ncomparison of at least three quotations from local contractors will\nbe followed. Vehicles, equipment, and material will be procured by\ninternational  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  more  than\n$500,000 equivalent, or by international shopping where the cost is\nfrom $100,000 to $500,000. Equipment or materials valued at less\nthan $100,000 equivalent, and for which there are several local\nsuppliers with satisfactory service facilities, may be procured under\nLCB procedures, or by comparing at least three quotations from\nlocal suppliers, where the cost is less than $50,000.\nConsulting Services A total of 129 person-months of international and 333 of domestic\nconsulting inputs will be required to support project implementation\nand capacity building. The consultants financed by ADB will be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for\nengaging domestic consultants. The Project will also contract out\nservices  to  prequalified  international  and  local  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) and other local institutions. To the extent\npossible,  procurement  will  be  done  on  the  basis  of  competitive\nprocedures, but where the number of service providers is limited,\ndirect negotiation may be applied, with the prior approval of ADB.\nEstimated Project 30 June 2007\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits and The Project\u2019s target population is the rural poor in an estimated 400\nBeneficiaries villages  in  50  communes  of  14  districts  in  the  northwestern\nprovinces.  Approximately  105,000  households  comprising  about", "v\n560,000 people are expected to benefit from the Project through\nincreased  participation  and  empowerment  in  prioritizing  and\nimplementing development initiatives, and improved access to (i)\nthe rural transportation network, (ii) education and health facilities\nand  services,  (iii)  clean  domestic  water  supply,  (iv)  village-level\nsocial  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  credit  and  savings  facilities  as  a\nprecursor  to  enterprise  development.  A  wide  array  of\nnonquantifiable benefits will also result from the Project, such as\nincreased  earning  opportunities  and  incomes,  better  social\ncohesion  and  community  organization,  and  greater  access  to\nproductive assets and markets. Capacity building provided by the\nProject at government and agency levels will impact on poverty\nthrough improved targeting and the use of participatory, needs-\nbased,  demand-led  planning  for  development  initiatives.  The\nProject will  have  further strategic impact on poverty as it will open\nthe way to further investment projects, particularly in agriculture and\nirrigation, that are expected to follow.", "vi", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Northwestern Rural Development Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The proposed Northwestern Rural Development Project is included in the 2001 Country\nAssistance Plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Cambodia. In response to a request\nfrom the Government of Cambodia, ADB provided technical assistance (TA) to prepare a project\nto reduce poverty and enhance socioeconomic and livelihood conditions in selected rural areas\nof  the  northwestern  region  of  the  country.1  Four  target  provinces\u2013Battambang,  Banteay\nMeanchey,  Oddar  Meanchey,  and  Siem  Reap  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  (i)  the  high\nincidence  of  poverty;  (ii)  the  need  for  postconflict  reconstruction;  (iii)  the  large  number  of\ninternally displaced persons, repatriated refugees, demobilized soldiers, and other vulnerable\ngroups; (iv) the prospect for cross-sectoral synergies in ADB\u2019s country program; and (v) the\nopportunity  for  complementarity  with  activities  supported  by  other  aid  agencies.  Early\ndiscussions with central and provincial governments resulted in understanding that the Project\nwill  focus  on  14  districts  in  the  four  provinces.  The  project  design  was  based  on  a\nsocioeconomic data review, on the results of qualitative and quantitative surveys carried out in\ntargeted villages, and on the outcomes of intensive consultation with stakeholders, including the\nGovernment,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  other  aid  agencies.  A  series  of\nparticipatory workshops were also held in each project province and in Phnom Penh, to develop\nthe  project  framework  and  discuss  the  project  design  with  central  and  local  government\nrepresentatives, external aid agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. A Loan Fact-Finding\nMission was conducted during 1-22 July 2001 and an Appraisal Mission during 22 August-8\nSeptember 2001. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. The Project Area\n3. The  project  area  comprises  two  contiguous  geographic  blocks  adjoining  the  Thai-\nCambodian border located in some of the most isolated parts of northwestern Cambodia. It\nincludes 14 districts: 4 in Battambang (Rattanak Mondol, Moung Roessei, Samlot, and Koas\nKrolor), 4 in Banteay Meanchey (Phnom Srok, Phreah Net Phreah, Svay Chek, and Thmar\nPuok), 3 in Oddar Meanchey (Chongkhal, Samraong, and Banteay Ampil), and 3 in Siem Reap\n(Angkor  Chum,  Varin,  and  Svay  Leur).  These  districts  are  broken  down  into  about  50\ncommunes, which are further broken down into 400 villages, with a combined population of\n560,000 people (105,000 households). Altitude ranges from 10 meters (m) above mean sea\nlevel at Tonle Sap's edge to around 800 m along the Dangkret Escarpment in the north and in\nthe foothills of the Cardamom Mountains in the southwest. Between the forested hills on the\nborder and the lowlands adjoining Tonle Sap, there is a mixed area of low, undulating hills\ninterspersed with broad flat valleys. Drainage lines run in a southeasterly direction toward Tonle\nSap from the Thai border in the north and west. The high and seasonal rainfall (1,200-1,600\nmillimeters per annum), flat topography, and sparse vegetation cover result in extreme peak\nrunoff flows that create complex hydrological conditions. What little forest cover remains is\n                  \n1 TA 3489-CAM: Rural Development Project, for $600,000, approved on 29 August 2000.", "2\nprimarily secondary regrowth, as the region has been subjected to considerable degradation\nthrough timber concessions and illegal logging activities. Even so, forest areas still provide up to\n50 percent of household incomes, in remote areas. Rainfed agriculture is the predominant\nsource of income based mainly on subsistence production. Large areas of existing and potential\nagricultural land are dotted with mines.\n4. Rural settlements are found along watercourses or roadsides. One legacy of the armed\nconflict that persisted in the area for nearly three decades is the capacity of entire villages to\nrelocate in search of economic opportunities or to find areas where farmland is more abundant.\nAs a consequence, new settlements are common throughout the area.\n2. Rural Poverty in Northwestern Cambodia\n5. Poverty is widespread throughout northwestern Cambodia and, to a large degree, is\nrelated to extended conflict and instability, and the resultant harm to the population and their\nliving environment. Most of the country experienced peace and economic growth after 1993, but\nonly since 1998 have the northwestern provinces enjoyed their first real respite from war. Many\ninternally displaced persons, repatriated refugees, internal migrants, and formally or informally\ndemobilized  soldiers  are  busy  reestablishing  their  livelihood  systems  in  what  remains  a\nfractured society. They are trying to reinsert themselves into either established communities or\nrecently resettled villages. Social cohesion between the groups is low and community structure\nis weak.\n6. Livelihood  systems  are  not  secure  for  most  of  these  communities,  which  comprise\npredominantly subsistence farmers. An estimated 60 percent of households in rural areas suffer\nfrom food deficits. Some villages have access to areas of good forest and are able to forage and\nhunt, or collect timber and nontimber forest products for immediate household consumption or\nsale. Others are able to supplement food crops with fish, but, in general, life is extremely\ndifficult. Food stocks begin running out for many families just four months after harvest. Coping\nmechanisms for villagers without access to good forest areas are even more tenuous and\ndifficult. Food production is constrained by lack of water for dry season cropping, lack of\ninvestment capital for better technology or improvements, while livestock are prone to high\nmortality  due  to  widespread  disease  and  lack  of  a  viable  veterinary  system.  Government\nagencies rarely deliver extension services in the more remote villages for reasons of access and\nbudgetary constraints. Health and agriculture, the two most needed services, are generally\nlimited to communes and villages in the vicinity of district centers. Access to savings and credit\nfacilities is severely limited in the communes and villages as the formal financial system does\nnot extend this far and the informal financial system (usually NGO-directed) is underdeveloped.\nSeveral  international  and  local  NGOs,  however,  have  been  successfully  implementing\nmicrofinance projects in some areas of northwestern Cambodia. For example, Catholic Relief\nServices  is  reaching  over  31,000  clients  nationwide,  including  6,300  in  188  villages  in\nBattambang Province (the only northwest province in which it is currently working); Cooperative\nfor Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) serves about 4,000 clients in the northwest;\nAction  Nord  Sud  reaches  about  10,000  clients;  and  World  Vision  reaches  17,000  clients\nnationwide, including 5,000 in the northwest. On a larger scale, Acleda Bank, which is still the\nonly specialized bank to be licensed by the National Bank of Cambodia as a microfinance\ninstitution, reaches over 60,000 clients nationwide. However, it does not take savings, and its\nclientele comes exclusively from the relatively richer provincial and district centers. NGOs are\neager to extend their outreach in the poor northwest provinces, and have been successful in\nboth mobilizing savings and delivering credit with high repayment rates, but limited access to\nvillages prevents an expansion of their activities.", "3\n7. Around 50 percent of villages have 40-60 percent of households living below the official\npoverty line.2 Household savings are normally held in the form of assets such as livestock and\nland, and, less often, gold and jewelry. These assets are often lost through forced sale due to\neconomic shock such as serious health problems in families. Average household incomes vary\nwidely, but the majority in the rural areas range from $300 to $700 per annum. With an average\nfamily size of just over five in rural households, this equates to an annual per capita income of\nbetween $60 and $140.\n8. Lack of access to health facilities and drinking water are major issues related to poverty,\nespecially in isolated rural areas. Most villages have problems with either insufficient or bad\nquality water, and often both. Some 6 percent of people obtain domestic water from boreholes,\n48 percent from dug wells, 38 percent from surface sources such as ponds and rivers; 2 percent\npurchase drinking water, and the other 6 percent obtain water from other sources such as roof\ncatchment. Only 8.5 percent of the population have access to safe drinking water, and these are\npredominantly  in  the  district  towns,  compared  with  the  national  average  of  29  percent.\nConditions are particularly difficult in the dry season when water from wells and surface water\nsources is frequently contaminated with livestock waste and other foreign matter. Water is\nusually not boiled before drinking, and there is little awareness of hygiene and sanitation. Only 4\npercent of households have latrines, compared with 14.5 percent nationally. Family planning,\nreproductive health, and infant vaccination services are all lacking in the remote areas. The\ngeographically dispersed nature of rural settlements and the condition of the road network force\nmany to travel more than six hours to reach health services.\n9. Many rural inhabitants in the northwestern provinces receive little or no schooling and\nthere is a high level of illiteracy, particularly among women. Official statistics report an adult\nliteracy rate of 46.2 percent (a figure considered to be inflated as it includes the partially literate)\ncompared with the national average of 63 percent. The school attendance of children aged 5-\n14  years  is  only  63  percent,  compared  with  the  national  average  of  67  percent.  Lack  of\neducation has an immediate impact on the general level of awareness and understanding.\nPeople are unable to recognize or take advantage of opportunities. They lack vocational choice\nand are unable to prepare themselves for the future. Lack of education and literacy has also\ncontributed to low community capacity. In most villages, the community\u2019s capacity to participate\nin development has yet to be established.\n10. Vulnerable groups throughout northwestern Cambodia include widows and other female\nheads of households, the physically and mentally handicapped, the orphaned, the landless, and\nthe aged without young to support them. There are also a considerable number of demobilized\nand demobilizing soldiers. Poverty does not distinguish gender but households headed by\nwomen,  or  those  that  lack  male  labor,  are  disadvantaged  and  have  limited  opportunities\ncompared with poor households headed by men. In such situations, widows not only have to\nsatisfy all or most of the household\u2019s needs on their own account, but also care for their young\nchildren. This group alone represents 14.6 percent of total households in rural northwestern\nCambodia. Poverty in the target area is further described in Appendix 2.\n3. Rural Infrastructure\n11. The long period of conflict and insecurity in northwestern Cambodia has resulted in\nphysical  destruction,  total  lack  of  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  and  lack  of  exposure  to\n                  \n2  The per capita expenditure needed to secure an intake of 2,100 calories per day.", "4\ndevelopment activities. Rural infrastructure is inadequate, with extremely poor transport links,\ninsufficient clean water supplies, and lack of public facilities and services. Schools, health\nfacilities, markets, and agricultural facilities are often nonexistent or in complete disrepair. Many\npeople are isolated due to the difficulty in reaching the main road network, particularly in the\nrainy season. The rural economy is fragmented into small localized units operating on the basis\nof a semisubsistence economy.\n12. The poor road network hinders not only economic, but also social development because,\nwithout roads, social services such as schools, health care, agricultural extension and credit,\nare not accessible. Most national (primary) and provincial (secondary) roads throughout the\nnorthwestern provinces are severely degraded. Those critical within the project area have been\naccorded high priority for rehabilitation under the five-year plan 2001-2005 of the Ministry of\nPublic Works and Transport (MPWT) and the ADB-financed Emergency Flood Rehabilitation\nProject (EFRP).3 Others have already been rehabilitated with external assistance or have been\nupgraded by the army. A few short sections of rural (tertiary) roads have been rehabilitated or\nrepaired  under  aid-agency-funded  projects,  but  are  scattered  throughout  the  area.  The\nremainder of the rural road network is in disrepair and these roads are frequently impassable,\nespecially in the wet season. In addition, many of these rural roads pass through heavily mined\nareas that can also have unexploded ordnance (UXO).\n13. Lack of clean domestic water is a major problem for most rural people of the northwest\nregion,  especially  in  the  dry  season.  Most  rely  on  shallow  dug  wells  or  nearby  rivers  for\nhousehold water and many have to travel long distances to the closest source of supply.\nSanitation facilities are scarce even in provincial and district centers, and are often inadequate\nwhere they do exist. This contributes to the problem of water contamination. In the course of\nintensive  social  surveys  undertaken  during  project  preparation  and  confirmed  during  loan\nprocessing, rural inhabitants generally gave higher priority to the improvement of road access to\nexisting district health centers with improved staffing and a better drug supply, than to the\nconstruction of new health facilities. However, those living in more isolated communities give\npriority to construction of smaller-scale health facilities at the commune or village level.\n14. School attendance is low, and where schools exist, class sizes are frequently large\u201350\nchildren per class or more. Often, two or three shifts a day are needed due to the limited\nnumber of classrooms. Schools are frequently dilapidated, old buildings or very simple wooden-\nframed, open-sided structures with thatch or corrugated iron roofs. In some places, classes are\nheld in private houses in the absence of other facilities.\n15. Most villages lack public buildings, such as village offices or community meeting rooms,\nbeyond, perhaps, a dilapidated classroom. There is a case for supporting the construction of\nsmall community facilities. A multipurpose building can be used for village meetings and public\nawareness campaigns, as well as provide a venue where visiting medical teams can carry out\nprimary health care, mother and child health clinics, and vaccination campaigns. In many areas,\nrice is threshed and dried on makeshift surfaces. Farmers can be helped to construct simple\nconcrete drying slabs as an alternative. Footbridges can give pedestrians a safer means for\ncrossing streams and rivers in the wet season in some villages. A simple structure, such as a\nbridge, culvert or drift, can make a village road or trail passable year-round. Formal markets\nexist in the districts but rarely in the communes or villages.\n                  \n3  Loan 1824-CAM(SF): Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project, for $55 million, approved on 21 December 2000.", "5\n4. Sector Issues\n16. Maintenance of Rural Roads. The resources that the Government currently allocates to\nthe maintenance of rural roads are well below requirements. With an increasing number of such\nroads being rehabilitated or constructed countrywide, still more will be needed. Where road\nmaintenance is undertaken, it is usually dependent on aid agencies or ad hoc payments from\nthe central Government in response to individual requests. It is also unreasonable to expect that\nmaintenance can be achieved solely from local participation and the collection of user charges,\nwhich  were  attempted  in  isolated  cases  with  mixed  success.  There  is  a  need  for  greater\nallocation of a recurrent budget and for the establishment of an institutionally and financially\nsustainable mechanism for maintaining of rural roads.\n17. Rural  Road  Network  Planning.  Rural  roads  in  the  project  area  have  often  been\nrehabilitated on relief and humanitarian grounds, and the planning approach adopted has often\nbeen  piecemeal  or  ad  hoc  rather  than  attending  to  the  network,  using  a  more  strategic\napproach.  With  the  exception  of  the  Upstream  Project,4  all  other  projects5  supporting  the\nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD) in the rural road subsector have focused on rehabilitating\nalignments\u2013an appropriate objective\u2013but have not attended to institutionalizing a planning and\nprioritization process to rehabilitate and maintain the tertiary network. A strategic development\napproach should now be contemplated as the emergency relief period is concluding.\n18. Institutional Capacities. Due to the limited number and capabilities of national human\nresources following decades of civil turmoil as well as a lack of motivation associated with low\ncivil  service  salaries,  the  Government  agencies  at  all  three  levels\u2013ministry  (national),\ndepartment (provincial), and offices (district)\u2013are weak in technical skills, project management,\nand implementation capacities. Few staff have technical qualifications above secondary level\nand those that do are found working elsewhere (most public servants hold two jobs, their\nattendance in their government position being proportional to the respective remuneration) or in\naid-agency-funded projects (agencies often encourage the secondment of their permanent staff\nto such projects in related fields of operation). The situation is made worse by the fact that the\nGovernment has committed itself to an ambitious decentralization program, intended to give\ngreater powers to provinces and lower administrative units where human resources require\nfurther strengthening and capacity building if they are to assume increased responsibilities.\nExtensive capacity building with a special focus on technology transfer within the responsible\nagency for rural development will be provided under the Project together with operational funds\nand salary incentives to enable trained individuals to conduct field operations effectively.\n19. Private  Sector  Capacity.  The  capacity  of  the  private  sector  involved  in  the  rural\ninfrastructure development sector (both construction contractors and consulting engineers) is\nalso weak. With limited funds available for civil work programs and the dominance of foreign\ncontractors operating in the country, there has been little incentive to develop the expertise\namong private operators. The adoption of labor-based appropriate technologies (LBAT) requires\nadditional training in labor management and production techniques that will be attended to\nunder  the  Project  using  the  training  programs  developed  by  the  International  Labour\n                  \n4 The Swedish International Development Agency-funded and International Labour Organization (ILO)-implemented\nUpstream Project introduced the integrated rural accessibility planning (IRAP) tool in Siem Reap and has trained\nprovincial department or rural development staff in Banteay Meanchey Province.\n5  Loan 1385-CAM(SF): Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project, for $25.1 million, approved on 28 September\n1995.

Security of Land Tenure. Lack of secure tenure or land rights is a recognized source of\nvulnerability for the rural poor, and security of land tenure is one of the keys to sustained rural\npoverty reduction. Upgrading the rural road improves accessibility and is often followed by\nprivate investment in agriculture and a consequent increase in the value of surrounding land. In\nthe northwestern provinces, a rehabilitated road can also act as a magnet for the mobile\npopulation in search of economic opportunities. Given this pattern, there may be increased land\ndisputes due to market dynamism engendered by any rural development project, and the target\nbeneficiaries may be alienated if they are not provided with formal documentation certifying\nownership or right of occupancy.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n21. The Government's overall socioeconomic development strategy is to achieve broad-\nbased, sustainable growth with equity at a rate of 6-7 percent per year through fiscal reform and\nmaintenance of political stability; private sector development; agricultural development and off-\nfarm income generation; and improved access of the poor to natural assets (especially land),\nhealth and education services, appropriate technology, and credit. The focus on the country's\nagriculture sector and poverty reduction recognizes the dominant position the sector occupies\nfor most people's livelihoods and the high incidence of poverty within this sector. The draft\nSocio-Economic Development Plan II (SEDP II, 2001-2005) prepared with the assistance of\nADB is also directed at increasing investment in rural areas. The Government has also adopted\nan  Interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  that  gives  the  framework  for  public  sector\ninvestment, including increased investment in rural infrastructure. That strategy seeks to (i)\npromote  decentralization  and  community  participation  in  project  identification,  design,  and\nimplementation so as to increase the efficiency and equity of rural development interventions;\n(ii) improve agricultural productivity through greater public investment in rural infrastructure so\nas to enhance the incomes of the rural poor; and (iii) increase rural access to affordable social\nservices, particularly for women and vulnerable groups.\n1. Rural Infrastructure\n22. In December 1999, MRD issued a policy for rural roads that described the delegation of\nresponsibility for road maintenance to the provinces, communes, and villages, based on the\nprinciple that users and beneficiaries pay. MRD indicated its role in this policy as providing\nadvice on maintenance and mobilization of local resources to fund maintenance programs.\nMRD encourages the establishment of rural road maintenance committees that collect tolls and\nlocal contributions from businesses and communities. This policy has been put into effect only in\na few local cases6 and reports limited success. Subsequently, the ADB-funded RIIP proposed\nan alternate mechanism for funding road maintenance through the establishment of a district\nmaintenance  fund.  The  fund  has  been  established,  but  is  still  to  be  resourced.  The\nGovernment\u2019s policy for rural road maintenance retains the principle of user pays but also\nrecognizes that this policy cannot be applied across the board as local resource mobilization will\nnot cover routine and periodic requirements.\n                  \n6  The Action Nord Sud-funded road from national route No. 6 northward in Chi Kreng District of Siem Reap\nProvince.", "7\n23. In recognition of the valuable contribution to local incomes, MRD also adopted the policy\nof using LBAT for rural road construction in accordance with the Government's policies on\nemployment creation and poverty reduction, with emphasis on creating opportunities and, where\nappropriate,  giving  priority  to  disadvantaged  groups.  MRD  is  committed  to  developing  an\nefficient private sector and contracts out all construction work to private contractors that have\nreceived training beforehand in LBAT. MRD retains the role to plan, design, and manage rural\ninfrastructure development.7\n2. Decentralization and Deconcentration\n24. The Government is carrying out broad-ranging reforms to the state apparatus\u2013covering\nareas of public administration and finance, legal and judicial reform, reforms in the military, and\nsubnational  reforms,  notably,  commitments  to  decentralization  (the  election  of  commune\ncouncils in February 2002) and deconcentration (the delegation of central ministry functions to\nprovincial authorities). Under present deconcentrated arrangements, there is generally pre-audit\ncontrol of spending, where ministries must seek the approval of the Ministry of Economy and\nFinance for spending requests. This has helped maintain tight control of social spending, but\noften leads to disruptive delays. As a result, three pilot deconcentrated expenditure systems are\nin use in selected provinces and sectors: Accelerated District Development (in 27 districts, for\nsmall health expenditures), the Seila Program8 (in six provinces, including the four target ones),\nand the Priority Action Programs (in the health and education sectors). A forthcoming organic\nlaw is expected to increase the powers of the provincial governors to coordinate provincial\ndepartments  and  will  determine  which  line  ministry  powers  will  be  devolved  to  provincial\ndepartments.\n25. Devolution of certain powers to elected commune councils will begin next year, building\non the experiences of pilots such as the Seila Program. The Law on Commune Administrative\nManagement empowers a National Committee to Support the Commune Councils (NCSCC),\ncomprising representatives from six ministries and the Council of Ministers, presided over by the\nMinistry  of  Interior  and  supported  by  a  technical  secretariat.  The  NCSCC\u2019s  role  includes\noverseeing  the  completion  of  the  necessary  regulations,  and  coordinating  programs  for\nstrengthening local institutions (communes, districts, and provinces). The NCSCC will have five\nyears  to  promote  the  elected  commune  councils  as  primary  agents  of  local  development;\nemphasize the province governors\u2019 functions as main coordinators and promoters of provincial\ndevelopment; and determine which other departments at provincial level have which roles in\nsupporting  the  commune  councils.  Under  the  Seila  Program,  commune  development\ncommittees (CDCs), chaired by a commune chief and including representatives from all villages,\nare responsible for developing the commune. After the February 2002 elections, commune\ncouncils will replace the CDCs. The commune councils will have 4-8 elected representatives\nwith a five-year mandate. It is expected that for at least the first year, planning and priority\nsetting mechanisms already in place for the CDCs will be carried forward by the commune\ncouncils, including the local planning process, commune development plans and commune\n                  \n7  Second Five Year Socio-Economic Development Plan of MRD, August 2000.\n8  Seila  (a  Khmer  word  meaning  foundation  stone)  originated  as  United  Nations  Development  Programme's\n(UNDP\u2019s) Cambodian Area Rehabilitation and Regeneration Project. With the continued support of UNDP and\nother aid agencies, Seila has evolved into a national program operating in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang,\nPursat, Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey, and Ratanakiri provinces under the coordination of a task force (chaired by\nthe senior minister of economy and finance and including representation from the main line ministries involved in\nrural development) at national level. It has piloted decentralized systems of provincial planning, managing\nprovincial funds, coordinating provincial line departments, and testing a model for executive management of\nprovincial development work.", "8\ninvestment plans and budgets. The Project will actively support this process by training the\nincoming  commune  councilors,  and  progressively  involving  them  in  project  implementation\nactivities.  The  Project  will  also  remain  flexible  to  adjustments  in  its  implementation\narrangements in view of the evolving process of decentralization.\n26. MRD  already  supports  the  decentralization  process  by  establishing  and  supporting\nvillage development committees and provincial rural development committees (PRDCs). The\nProject  will  also  support  this  process  by,  among  others,  the  use  of  PRDCs  to  approve\ninfrastructure investments. The project design also incorporates successfully tested features of\nthe Seila Program such as its bottom-up planning approach and the multisectoral coordination\nmechanism at provincial level.\n C. External Assistance to the Sector\n27. From 1992 to 2000, ADB provided Cambodia with 16 loans totaling $467.36 million and\n79 TA projects amounting to $56.9 million. Four loans totaling $91.1 million were in agriculture\nand natural resources, two of them specifically targeting rural infrastructure ($31.1 million)\nexcluding the loan funds allocated to rehabilitation of tertiary roads under the EFRP (footnote 3).\nSome 13 TAs were provided in the agriculture and natural resources sector, of which 5 ($1.7\nmillion) were directed at rural infrastructure. The ADB country lending assistance has been\ndirected equally across agriculture, transport, and the social sectors, with approvals of about\n$100 million to each and a smaller allocation to energy ($30 million).\n28. The ADB-funded RIIP is being implemented in six provinces in south Cambodia. It has\nfour components: (i) rural road rehabilitation, (ii) market development, (iii) critical small civil\nworks,  and  (iv)  capacity  building  for  MRD  and  its  provincial  departments.  The  project  is\nperforming  satisfactorily  and  has  generated  many  appropriate  designs,  standards,  and\nprocedures for incorporation in the Project. Assistance to rural infrastructure outside the project\narea  has  been  provided  under  the  Tertiary  Roads  Improvement  Project  (TRIP)  funded  by\nKreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (German Bank for Reconstruction). A summary list of external\nassistance within the sector is in Appendix 3.\n29. Rural infrastructure projects implemented in the target provinces gathered momentum\nonly  with  the  establishment  of  peace  and  have  been  undertaken  in  response  to  different\nobjectives. The ADB-funded EFRP will rehabilitate both secondary and tertiary roads damaged\nby the 2000 floods in three of the target provinces adjacent to Tonle Sap. The World Food\nProgramme (WFP) has rehabilitated or established tertiary and subtertiary roads under its food-\nfor-work  program,  but  to  date  has  been  oriented  toward  providing  basic  access  for  the\nemergency  distribution  of  food  supplies.  That  program  is  currently  under  review  and  its\nextension9 will adopt a \u201cfood for development\u201d philosophy. WFP has also been responsible for\nrehabilitating or constructing rural infrastructure including roads, schools, health facilities; and\nfor other social support interventions such as basic health and education services, skills training,\nand community outreach activities. Support has also been provided under Upstream Project\nfunded by the Swedish International Development Agency. Its main focus has been on capacity\nbuilding for provincial department of rural development (PDRD) staff and local contractors, and\nintroducing the integrated rural accessibility planning (IRAP) tool for planning and prioritizing\ninfrastructure investments on a needs and accessibility basis. Pilot contracts using LBAT have\nalso been funded under that project.\n                  \n9  The Protracted Relief Recovery Operations Program.", "9\n30. The Seila Program has four key areas of influence in the target provinces including (i)\npoverty reduction through the provision of rural infrastructure, (ii) institutional strengthening, (iii)\npiloting a possible model to support the Government's decentralization and deconcentration\npolicy, and (iv) the introduction of a needs-based, demand-driven, local planning process. The\nProgram has attracted significant aid agency (United Nations Development Programme and\nbilateral) funding, resulting in the investment of some $32 million in infrastructure in the target\nprovinces since 1996. Most of the infrastructure investments funded under the Program are\nidentified through the local planning process (LPP)\u2013a commune-based, participatory, bottom-up\nprocess\u2013and then progressively aggregated (coordinated at district facilitation workshops) into\nprovincial strategic development and investment plans. The Program provides limited funding\n(local development funds) for investments identified through the LPP as well as for provincial\ninitiatives, including rural roads, health centers, schools, water supplies, and in the fields of\nincome generation and natural resource management. The Program has developed a provincial\nimplementation  capability  under  the  PRDC,  including  an  executive  committee  (ExCom)\nresponsible for implementation. ExCom comprises a secretariat and associated local capacity-\nbuilding unit, monitoring and evaluation unit, contracts administration unit and finance unit, all\nfunded by aid agency contributions through the Seila Task Force. The ExCom is not responsible\nto any line ministry. Through substantial external technical assistance, the Program supports the\ncommittee and has improved the capacities, mobility, and resources of many provincially based\ngovernment  employees  that  have  been  seconded  to  staff  the  committee  on  a  contractual\n(including supplementary salaries) and competitive basis. None of ExCom appointments occupy\npublic servant positions even though they may be contracted  public servants. The identification\nand prioritization of rural road rehabilitation under the Seila Program is done through the LPP,\nwhich lacks the larger geographic planning vision desirable for attending to the road network\nand often leads to a more piecemeal or ad hoc approach. The Program also favors mechanized\ntechniques for most of its road rehabilitation activities, and adopts technical specifications and\nconstruction standards that do not conform with those developed by MRD and are seldom\nappropriate for situations where they have been applied, often with poor quality outcomes.\n31. Other aid-agency-funded rural development programs in northwestern Cambodia not\nspecifically  targeting  infrastructure  but  relating  to  poverty  reduction  (through  agricultural\nproductivity)  include  the  Agricultural  Development  Support  to  Seila,  funded  by  IFAD,  the\nCambodian Australian Agricultural Extension Project, funded by AusAID, and the Economic and\nSocial Relaunch of the Northern Provinces Project soon to be funded by the European Union.\nADB has a number of rural development initiatives in the pipeline covering this area, including a\nRural Water and Sanitation Project, a North West Cambodia Irrigation Sector Project, and a TA\nto  MRD  for  developing  a  rural  development  strategy\u2013all  included  in  the  2003  Country\nAssistance Plan. In addition, the Belgium bilateral agency is contemplating education and health\nsector infrastructure investments in Siem Reap, and the World Bank is currently designing a\ncomplementary provincial and rural infrastructure project based primarily on secondary roads in\nSiem Reap and Oddar Meanchey among others, outside the project area. A number of NGOs\nhave also contributed to the construction, operation, and maintenance of rural infrastructure as\npart of their overall rural development activities, significantly improving access to social services\nin these more remote areas.\nD. Lessons Learned\n32. The 2000 ADB Portfolio Review Mission concluded that the Government has been\nsuccessful in eliminating many systematic issues hampering efficient project implementation.\nThere remain weaknesses in specific areas, most of them related to (i) the acute shortage of\nskilled and experienced staff assigned to project implementation; and (ii) the lack of delegation", "10\nof authority within line ministries, and to project implementation offices. Both technical and\nproject  management  skills  are  found  wanting  in  most  development  projects,  and  capacity\nbuilding  remains  an  indispensable  project  component.  Adoption  of  decentralized  project\nimplementation arrangements facilitates delegation of authority. But such delegation, especially\nto the lowest echelon, needs to be gradual and again complemented by adequate capacity\nbuilding to ensure sufficient absorptive capacity.\n33. Given the enormity of the task of infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction in most\nrural areas of Cambodia, especially in the northwestern provinces, there is a need to prioritize\ninvestments so as to achieve the maximum impact from available investment funds. It is clear\nfrom rural infrastructure projects, particularly the Upstream Project implemented by ILO and the\nADB-funded  RIIP,  that  selecting  road  alignments  to  be  rehabilitated  is  an  important\nconsideration in maximizing the potential benefit. Prioritized rural roads must connect with the\nestablished provincial or district road network and provide development corridors to be followed\nby other infrastructure and socioeconomic development initiatives. Planning tools utilized in\nprioritizing investments need to involve the participation of beneficiaries, including the poor and\nvulnerable groups, to have the desired impact on poverty and to contribute to their sense of\nownership. Villager participation in assigning priorities to investments at the commune or village\nlevel is desirable and is being practiced to a certain extent, notably the LPP. With their narrower\ngeographic  planning  vision,  villagers  cannot  relate  to  the  larger  framework  of  district,  and\nultimately, province that is necessary in prioritizing rural roads where strategic considerations\nmust be given to the overall road network.\n34. Villager participation in decision making is still a new concept in rural Cambodia, as it is\nwith Government staff who facilitates participation. Villagers often believe that it is inappropriate\nnot to follow majority opinion. What is referred to as the \u201cconsensus strategy\u201d is an important\nfeature of traditional local attitudes and villagers tend to leave decisions to higher authorities.\nGovernment staff's understanding of real participation is sometimes lacking and they often\nconfuse participatory processes with data-gathering exercises. As a result, priority investments\nmay not reflect the real priorities within the villages, particularly when considering the needs of\nthe poor. Finally, all project implementers recognize that the participatory process is necessary,\nbut costly and time-consuming.\n35. The lessons learned regarding operation and maintenance (O&M) of rural infrastructure,\nespecially rural roads, are obvious, but the solutions are less clear. Both routine and periodic\nmaintenance are needed on all road alignments if they are to remain useful to the public. The\nestimated life of a rural road with adequate routine maintenance is about 4-5 years before it\nrequires  periodic  maintenance  (grading  and  resurfacing).  Involving  communities  along  the\nroadside in routine maintenance has worked in some isolated cases where population densities\nare high, where most road users are from within the area served by the road, and where\ncontinued community-organizing efforts are provided by a project or an NGO. Those living\nalongside rehabilitated roads view maintenance as the responsibility of the Government and\ncannot be convinced to assume responsibility, especially when a far wider community benefits.\nBeneficiaries often view the requirement of contribution in kind as forced provision of labor. Care\nmust be taken to ensure that the burden of maintenance does not fall unfairly on the poorest\nmembers  of  the  community.  Under  the  ILO,  TRIP,  and  RIIP  projects,  maintenance\narrangements  involve  the  use  of  a  petty  contract  system  in  which  the  beneficiaries  who\nparticipated in the rehabilitation of the roads are trained and paid to maintained them. Materials,\ntools,  and  wages  are  provided  under  the  projects.  The  system  is  cost-effective  and  has\ndemonstrated  satisfactory  results.  However,  arrangements  for  sustainable  maintenance\nfinancing and a legal framework to support them still need to be developed.", "11\n36. The  advantages  of  using  LBAT  in  rural  road  construction  are  well  documented,\nespecially  from  the  ILO,  TRIP,  and  RIIP  projects.  In  particular,  using  local  village  labor\nresources that are relatively underutilized in the dry season injects valuable cash to the village\neconomy and has a direct impact on the poverty status of villages. It is not always the most\neffective method in sparsely populated areas where the supply of local labor is limited. Under\nthese  conditions,  it  is  found  more  appropriate  to  utilize  mechanized  road  construction\ntechniques  together  with  LBAT  around  village  settlements.  The  level  of  management  and\nsupervision required under labor-based techniques is greater and the time taken to complete\nconstruction is longer.\n37. The incidence of inappropriately designed road structures is significant in rural areas of\nCambodia.  Many  road  structures  have  been  badly  located  and  designed  due  to  limited\nexperience and design skills, and lack of consideration of local hydrology. Frequently, such\ndesigns impose recurrent commitments that cannot be assured. MRD, with the support of ILO\nand  the  RIIP,  has  developed  appropriate  and  cost-effective  design,  specifications,  and\nconstruction standards for rural roads and structures. Introducing and using these features as\npart of improving technical capacities within the responsible provincial agencies, as well as\nwithin the private consulting sector, should be a priority consideration for the Government.\n38. In the area of microfinance and small-scale economic activities in isolated rural areas,\nmore effective preliminary interventions in capacity building, such as community awareness and\nempowerment in preparation for longer term planning and introduction of a savings discipline,\nneed to be undertaken before starting microfinance and microenterprise development initiatives.\n39. Finally, one of the most important observations from projects reviewed is that project\ndesign should be realistic in scope and phasing. Some designs have expected too much in too\nshort time. For this reason, there should be regular reviews and progress reporting so that\ndesigns  may  be  modified  to  accommodate  local  capacities  and  conditions.  Time  must  be\nallocated to establishing management systems and procedures as well as gaining the support of\nlocal communities.\n E. ADB's Sector Strategy\n40. ADB's  strategy  as  outlined  in  the  country  operational  strategy  supports  the\nGovernment's goal of poverty reduction as a means of reuniting the country by promoting (i)\npro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth  through  broad-based,  labor-intensive  economic\ndevelopment in populous rural areas where 90 percent of the country's poor live; (ii) basic\nhuman or social development by boosting labor productivity while improving the distribution\neffectiveness of economic growth and improving the quality of life indicators; and (iii) private\nsector participation in development, addressing key institutional and infrastructure weaknesses\nthat will improve the geographic balance of economic growth and strengthen the linkages\nbetween the rural and urban areas. Sectorally, ADB has also made a long-term commitment\u2013\ncontingent on Government action to implement necessary reforms\u2013to play a lead facilitatory role\nin the critical areas of water resource management, education, and transport.\n41. ADB recognizes that the transport network is vital to the socioeconomic development of\nCambodia,  specifically,  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  rural  areas.  The  Government  and  aid\nagencies agree that restoring the primary road network needs to be given priority. ADB has\nfinanced the rehabilitation of national route no. 5 between Battambang and Sisophon10 and is\n                  \n10 Loan 1697-CAM(SF): Primary Road Restoration Project, for $68 million, approved on 21 September 1998.", "12\ncontemplating financing the upgrade of national route no. 6 from Siem Reap westward to Poi\nPet11 on the Thai border, a critical road for the Project. Without this network in place, the country\nwill remain fragmented and rural roads will, at best, lead to small provincial towns, isolating the\npoor population and limiting the benefits of trade available to them. With RIIP, the Stung Chinit\nIrrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project,12 and this Project, ADB recognizes and supports the\nimportance of the rural roads linking rural areas to the primary and secondary network.\n42. Consistent with its commitment to broad-based economic development in the populous\nrural areas, ADB will also support production-oriented initiatives through an agriculture sector\ndevelopment project and a north west irrigation sector project, proposed for 2003, that will\ncomplement  the  activities  undertaken  in  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  aid-agency-funded\nprojects in agriculture. Through an integrated natural resources sector development project,\nproposed for 2002, ADB will also demonstrate its commitment to a geographic focus in the\ninundation zone of Tonle Sap where poverty incident is high and community-based integrated\nmanagement systems need support. This synergy between ADB-funded projects in the area\nreinforces the impact compared with what might be achieved from a single investment.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n43. Rural Road Maintenance. To support the maintenance of rural roads, there is a need to\nensure a reliable, adequate, and sustainable financing mechanism from increased recurrent\nbudgetary allocations from the Government. At provincial level, the most effective means of\nensuring that such maintenance is performed appears to be through the allocation of central\nand provincial government funds to a maintenance account, which may also be complemented\nby user charges. The Project will support, on a pilot basis, the establishment of such an account\nat  the  provincial  level.  In  addition  to  maintenance  funds  financed  from  fuel  taxes,  the\nGovernment  is  examining  alternate  revenue-raising  activities  such  as  a  tax  on  vehicle\nregistration, neighborhood participation in maintenance works, and road tolls. With ADB support\nthrough the RIIP and the Transport Sector Strategy Study,13 the Government is in the process of\ndeveloping and establishing the institutionally and financially sustainable mechanism required\nfor rural road maintenance throughout the country.\n44. Rural Road Network Planning. MPWT and MRD recently agreed that planning of\ntertiary and subtertiary roads is the responsibility of MRD although they recognize the need to\nliaise  closely  to  ensure  that  rural  roads  extend  from  the  existing  primary  and  secondary\nnetworks. It is well understood that the road network has a wider geographic impact than can be\naddressed through conventional, grassroots, participatory planning processes. Only recently\nwas  IRAP14  adopted  as  MRD's  preferred  planning  tool  to  address  the  network  integration\naspect. Staff within MRD and the PDRDs are still inexperienced with this planning tool and do\nnot have the resources to attend to this activity. The Project recognizes the need for a broader-\n                  \n11 Road Network Improvement II Project, proposed for 2003.\n12 Loan 1753-CAM(SF): Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project, for $16 million, approved on 5\nSeptember 2000.\n13 TA 3651-CAM: Transport Sector Strategy, for $850,000, approved on 27 April 2001.\n14 IRAP is a local participatory planning process based on the concept that lack of access of rural people to goods\nand services is the fundamental constraint to development and that improving access is a major tool in poverty\nreduction. IRAP as an integrated tool encompasses all the household\u2019s access needs and considers the full range\nof possible interventions to improve access depending on local conditions. The process has five main stages: (i)\nprimary data collection at village level, (ii) assessment of accessibility through data analysis and development of\nindicators, (iii) identification and prioritization of villages for possible interventions, (iv) detailed planning and\nmapping exercise at the priority village level, and (v) costing and development of a local action plan and program.", "13\nplanning framework and will support the institutionalization of IRAP within the Department of\nRural Roads15 being established in MRD and PDRDs.\n45. Decentralization, Deconcentration, and Good Governance. These are central to the\nnational public administration reform process currently being implemented in Cambodia. They\nare also an essential component of the Government's poverty reduction strategy outlined in the\nSEDP II (2001-2005) and the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The decentralization\nand deconcentration policy has an impact on all rural development initiatives throughout the\ncountry that require improved public sector financial management and the delegation of the\ndecision-making  process  to  the  provinces,  after  such  initiatives  are  identified  through\nparticipatory processes. The Project is consistent with the government policy in that it draws\nheavily on participatory procedures in identifying, prioritizing, constructing, and managing rural\ninfrastructure investments. It also involves provincial and communal entities in prioritizing and\napproving investments to be funded, implementing activities, disbursements, and liquidating\nADB loan funds. Furthermore, the project design incorporates successfully tested features of\npilot decentralized expenditures systems such as the Seila Program or the Priority Action\nPrograms (para. 24). While the Project incorporates project-specific good governance features,\nADB is actively addressing governance issues at sector and national levels through ongoing or\nplanned assistance.16\n46. Land Tenure. Lack of secure land tenure or land user rights is a possible source of\nvulnerability for the rural poor in the project area, especially those settled alongside the rural\nroads to be rehabilitated under the Project. The Government\u2019s Land Law, prepared with ADB\nassistance, was promulgated in August 2001 and addresses many outstanding issues on land\npolicy. Detailed subdecrees are now needed to implement the law, and ADB is assisting17 in\npreparing the necessary ones. Nevertheless, the law already includes provisions to the effect\nthat persons who can prove peaceful and uncontested possession of the land for a certain\nperiod of time before the law was passed can, on that basis, obtain title to the land as an\nexception to the ordinary rules for prescription (which would require a much longer period of\npossession).  The  Project  will  assist  beneficiaries  to  document  their  claims  to  uncontested\npossession (para. 61).\n47. Public-Private  Sector  Partnership.  The  Government\u2019s  draft  SEDP  II  (2001-2005)\nrecognizes that enhancing private sector development is a key to sustainable economic growth\nand poverty reduction. The Project will support private-public sector partnership through project-\nspecific  initiatives  such  as  (i)  training  local  entrepreneurs  in  labor-based  technology,  (ii)\nestablishing a laboratory for materials and soil testing to be operated by the private sector, and\n(iii) upgrading public market infrastructure to be operated by private market committees.\n                  \n15 Subdecree No. 51 of 21 July 2001 amends Subdecree no. 78 of 1 December 1997 and establishes (Article 12) the\nRural Roads Department within MRD and describes its mandate (Article 17).\n16 TA 3634-CAM: Strengthening Public Financial Management, for $1.2 million, approved on 22 February 2001.\nProposed project preparatory TA (PPTA) for 2002: Local Governance and Decentralization, to be followed by a\nloan in 2003.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n48. Nearly three decades of war have left behind a fractured society that is progressively\nsettling back into previously occupied and new areas, where basic infrastructure is limited and\nwhat does exist is in poor condition and needs rehabilitation. The incidence of poverty, however\ndefined, is higher in northwestern rural Cambodia than in most parts of the country. The region,\nwith its abundant land resources (even though frequently contaminated by mines and UXO), still\nattracts many new settlers (internally displaced persons, repatriated refugees, internal migrants,\nand formally or informally demobilized soldiers). A necessary prerequisite to addressing the\ncauses of poverty in rural Cambodia in general, and the northwestern provinces in particular, is\naccess. Access to an adequate and functional road network, the lifeblood of the rural economy\nand social development, is a necessary prerequisite to socioeconomic development, as roads\nwill  give  the  rural  population  access  to  social  infrastructure,  markets,  income-generating\nopportunities, and social services.\n49. Beneficiary  participation  in  identifying,  planning,  implementing,  and  subsequently\nmaintaining this infrastructure is critical if full impact is to be achieved. Access must be provided\nin response to community-identified needs. In isolated communities, participation, especially by\npoor and vulnerable groups, has been minimal because they have been isolated from decision-\nmaking  processes.  This  reflects  their  recent  history  and  cultural  practices.  To  increase\nparticipation, community development directed at the poor and vulnerable groups is an integral\npart of the overall project design.\n50. The Project is consistent with both ADB's and the Government\u2019s strategy for poverty\nreduction and is seen as a major contribution to reducing the isolation of rural communities from\ndevelopment opportunities. The Project will not only rehabilitate the vital arteries that access\nrural areas, but also construct or rehabilitate other small-scale village infrastructure, improve\naccess  to  microfinance  services,  and  provide  for  significant  capacity  building  for  the\nimplementing agencies and community groups. The Project is consistent with and supports the\nGovernment  initiative  of  decentralization  and  deconcentration,  which  will  in  turn  lead  to\nimproved governance, one of ADB's priority areas of concern in Cambodia. The Project will also\nassist  the  development  of  the  private  sector  in  rural  areas,  as  small-  and  medium-size\nenterprises can be expected to flourish, given the improved market access made possible by\nthe Project.\n51. The  Project  will  build  on  the  successful  and  tested  approach  adopted  by  previous\nassistance for rural infrastructure projects supported by ADB and other aid agencies, such as\nILO and KfW. It will also complement and link with other planned projects to be financed by ADB\nand other aid agencies18 in the area.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n52. The overall objective of the Project is to support the Government\u2019s effort to reduce\npoverty through accelerated rural development by establishing physical transport and social\n                  \n18 The World Bank-financed Provincial Rural Infrastructure Project , planned for 2002, will support rehabilitation of\nprovincial  and  district  roads.  The  European  Union-funded  Economic  and  Social  Relaunch  of  the  Northern\nProvinces (EcoSorn), planned for 2003, will focus on economic activities that generate food security, employment,\nand income for the poor (more specifically small-scale irrigation with human resource development and agricultural\nextension).", "15\ninfrastructure,  improving  socioeconomic  conditions,  and  enhancing  rural  livelihoods  in\nnorthwestern Cambodia. The immediate objectives are to (i) plan, rehabilitate or establish, and\nmaintain public rural infrastructure that will improve the living conditions of the targeted rural\npopulation; (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities and institutions to identify, prioritize, plan,\nimplement, coordinate, monitor, and maintain infrastructure investments; and (iii) support and\nfacilitate access to appropriate savings and credit mechanisms for livelihood enhancement and\nincome-generating activities in the villages and communes (Appendix 1).\n53. The Project has three components: (i) rural infrastructure development\u2013extend the rural\nroad network and establish social infrastructure in the districts (e.g., schools, health facilities,\nand markets); (ii) capacity building\u2013enhance the capacity of both private and public sectors\nassociated with the planning, design, construction, maintenance, and ongoing monitoring of\nproject activities; and (iii) rural livelihood enhancement\u2013involve and empower the beneficiaries,\nestablish  small-scale  infrastructure  at  the  village  level  (e.g.,  water  supply  and  sanitation\nschemes, rice drying and storage facilities, community buildings), and establish savings and\ncredit initiatives in the villages and communes.\n1. Rural Infrastructure Development\n54. Two categories of rural infrastructure will be financed under the Project. The first is\ninfrastructure with a provincial or district impact and includes rural road rehabilitation, market\nfacilities, and larger public civil works such as health facilities and schools.  Infrastructure in the\nsecond category is smaller, with a more localized impact at the commune or village level, and is\npart of the rural livelihood enhancement component of the Project (para. 69).\n55. Identification  and  Prioritization.  The  most  appropriate  method  for  identifying  and\nprioritizing the larger-scale rural infrastructure investments is IRAP, a participatory planning tool\napplied at the district level and adopted by MRD as its preferred planning approach. Since other\nrelevant  line  agencies  have  their  own  planning  procedures  and  standard  requirements  for\nschools19 and health facilities, these investments will be eligible for funding under the Project\nonly  if  they  are  also  confirmed  in  other  line  agency  development  plans  with  established\nbudgetary support for their staffing and operation.\n56. Although only three of the five districts of Oddar Meanchey Province are included in the\nproject area, a special case will be made for the provision of small bridges, culverts, and drifts to\nthe two other districts in view of (i) the current low level of development and substantial need for\npostconflict reconstruction, and (ii) the extremely poor road network and lack of access during\nthe wet season that hinders development efforts and leads to the depopulation of some areas.\nLimited funds will be made available to Anlong Veng and Trapaeng Prasat districts for the\nconstruction of road structures in support of, and complementary to, ongoing development\ninitiatives.20\n57. Scope of Rural Infrastructure. It is estimated that the Project will fund the rehabilitation\nof some 600 kilometers (km) of rural roads (tertiary roads) where economic, environmental, and\nsocial justification can be demonstrated. These tertiary roads are low-cost and surfaced with\nlocally  available  materials,  usually  laterite.  Other  rural  infrastructure  to  be  funded  includes\n                  \n19 The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport recently adopted a priority facilities development plan that will be\nsupported by the ADB-financed Education Sector Development Program, planned for 2001. The Project will\ncomplement and coordinate with that Program.\n20 The WFP food-for-work road construction program, and UNICEF Community Action for Child Rights (CACR) and\nChildren in Need of Special Protection (CNSP) programs.", "16\nschools (estimated at 250 classrooms including the rehabilitation of existing premises), health\nfacilities (estimated at one per project district), and market facilities (estimated at one per project\ndistrict).\n58. Survey  and  Design  Considerations.  Rural  roads  will  be  constructed  using  the\nstandard  adopted  by  MRD  (adequate  compaction  over  a  carriageway  of  5  m  wide,  15\ncentimeters of laterite surfacing, side drainage, turfing of the side slopes, etc.). Markets will also\nbe  upgraded  or  constructed  to  standard  designs  developed  and  adopted  by  MRD.  Public\nfacilities such as school and health facilities will be rehabilitated or constructed to existing\nstandard designs acceptable to the responsible line agency. Sufficient capacity exists, or can be\ndeveloped through training in the PDRDs and departments of public works and transport21 of the\nproject provinces to undertake the survey, design, and tender documentation of infrastructure to\nbe financed under the Project. In the case of more complex rural road sections, and larger\nbridges  and  road  structures,  it  will  be  necessary  to  engage  domestic  consultants.  Little\nhydrological information exists on the project provinces; and roads, bridges, and culverts have\nfailed due to the use of poor ad hoc designs resulting from limited understanding of local\nhydrology. A road engineer, qualified and experienced in hydrology, will be recruited to conduct\nhydrological studies and apply the findings to the design of roads, especially structures to be\nadopted under the Project.\n59. Construction  Technology.  Given  the  poverty  reduction  focus  of  the  Project,  it  is\nexpected that at least 60 percent of the road rehabilitation or reconstruction work will be carried\nout using LBAT to ensure that the surrounding rural population, including the poor, are given\npriority for jobs. Some project areas, however, are sparsely populated, particularly during the\ndry season when some people either migrate temporarily in search of work or forage for food in\nthe  forest.  While  the  road  work  will  provide  an  alternative  source  of  employment  for  the\npopulation, the possibility of low labor supplies may be a constraint on LBAT, and equipment-\nbased construction methods will then be considered.\n60. De-Mining  Activities.  The  high  incidence  of  mine  and  UXO  contamination  in  the\nnorthwestern provinces of Cambodia is one of the legacies of years of conflict. Sections of rural\nroads to be rehabilitated under the Project will require de-mining prior to survey, design, and\nconstruction.  Similarly,  sites,  pathways  to,  and  the  immediate  surroundings  of  social\ninfrastructure to be constructed in the communes and villages and other public areas may be\nmine contaminated and require clearance. De-mining of the rural road alignment to a width of 20\nm on each side of the road centerline will be the responsibility of the Government, which has\ndemonstrated capacity to do it. This activity will be financed under the counterpart contribution\nto the Project. De-mining before rehabilitating or constructing public or community buildings in\nthe communes and villages will be funded by the Project and contracted out to recognized\nhumanitarian de-mining organizations licensed to operate in Cambodia.\n61. Land Tenure Security. Lack of secure tenure or land rights is a recognized source of\nvulnerability for the rural poor in the project area. Improving and securing land tenure and rights\nis a key to sustained rural poverty reduction. To ensure positive outcomes for beneficiaries, the\nGovernment  will  support  beneficiaries  along  the  rehabilitated  road  alignments  in  obtaining\nownership  title  or  other  occupancy  rights  in  accordance  with  the  Land  Law.  Neither  land\nacquisition nor involuntary resettlement is expected in the context of infrastructure rehabilitation\nor construction, apart from a few isolated minor cases that will require the preparation of a short\n                  \n21 The minister of Public Works and Transport has agreed that provincial engineers can be seconded to PDRD to\nassist with road surveys and design.", "17\nresettlement plan to be submitted to ADB for approval.\n2. Capacity Building\n62. This  component  is  considered  essential  to  ensure  efficient  and  effective  project\nimplementation in view of the limited technical and managerial capacities and the limited budget\nat the provincial level. Three aspects of capacity building are proposed under the Project.\n63. The  first  is  directed  at  technical  and  managerial  skills  of  PDRD  staff,  in  terms  of\nidentifying, planning, supervising construction, and monitoring and evaluating rural infrastructure\ninterventions, and in terms of preparing, implementing, and monitoring community development\nactivities.  The  Project  will  support  PDRDs  to  upgrade  rural  infrastructure  planning  and\nimplementation skills. This will include technical training in planning techniques, survey, design,\ncosting, management, and supervision of infrastructure construction. It will also include training\nin gender-sensitive community participatory approaches. The Project will also train PDRD staff\nin the use of established standard designs and specifications for rural roads and associated\nstructures.\n64. At commune and village levels, the Project will support the incoming commune councils\nin prioritizing, planning, and implementing small-scale village infrastructure. Through extensive\ninvolvement  in  participatory  screening  and  prioritizing  of  the  potential  village  infrastructure\ninvestments (para. 69) and in implementing them, the commune council members will be trained\nin leadership, participatory approaches, roles and responsibilities, and other skills as requested.\n65. The second aspect is directed at improving the management skills of prequalified local\nNGOs and the private sector associated with the Project at the provincial level. It will give NGO\nstaff specialized training in the areas of participatory approaches, roles and responsibilities,\nprocedures for screening prioritized investments, and other community development topics.\nSkilled and experienced contractors in LBAT are still few. Training for small-scale contractors,\nsimilar to that conducted by ILO in the project provinces, will be continued and expanded under\nthe Project, particularly in Oddar Meanchey Province, which has no trained contractors at\npresent. In addition, private consulting engineers will be trained in supervising infrastructure\nconstruction and in quality control. The Project will also assist establishing a materials testing\nlaboratory by identifying and training local entrepreneurs capable of establishing and operating\nthe laboratory. As part of its commercial operation, the laboratory will perform soil and concrete\ntesting required by the project implementation units (PIUs) in their construction supervision\nactivities. Roads rehabilitation contracts issued under the Project will provide the necessary\nsecurity to facilitate access to existing credit sources to fund the laboratory operation.\n66. The third aspect concerns the institutionalization of IRAP planning and management\ncapabilities  within  MRD  and  its  provincial  departments.  The  Project  will  support  the\nestablishment of a mapping unit under the Rural Road Department established within MRD and\nsupport the operations of its offices in each of the PDRDs. The support will include training in\ncomputer  operations,  geographic  information  systems  (GIS),  IRAP  procedures,  and  data\nmanagement systems.\n3. Rural Livelihood Enhancement\n67. This component addresses the need to enhance the livelihoods of the people in the\ntarget communities and assist them in strengthening social cohesion. Three subcomponents are\nproposed.", "18\n68. Community  Development.  This  subcomponent  will  promote  social  cohesion,\nstrengthen capacities in the community, and support the empowerment of common interest\ngroups, with emphasis on the poor and disadvantaged so that they will feel confident to express\ntheir views and are not overlooked when priority development investments in the community are\ndetermined. The process will provide the participatory mechanism necessary to screen potential\nvillage infrastructure investments (para. 69) to be financed by the Project at the commune and\nvillage levels. The means of identifying and prioritizing these investments will be on a pro-poor\nand community demand-led basis, and will use as an entry point the commune investment plans\nprepared through the LPP introduced by the Seila Program. The list of priority investments\ngenerated through this process will be screened using tailored participatory procedures that will\ninvolve poor and vulnerable groups so as to establish a revised priority list of investments\neligible for funding under the Project, complying with its pro-poor focus. This process will take\nplace in the villages in the impact area of a road alignment immediately after its rehabilitation,\nand the village infrastructure works will be constructed the following year.\n69. Village Infrastructure Investments. Eligible items for small-scale village infrastructure\ninvestment include water supply and sanitation schemes, culverts, footbridges, rice drying pads\nand storage facilities, community meeting halls, and similar community facilities. The Project will\nfund the installation of some 170 village wells (hand-dug ring wells and mechanically drilled\nboreholes) and 60 ponds, and will provide for the construction of other village infrastructure\nbased on an annual allocation to participating communes. Standard templates for a range of\nvillage  infrastructure  including  wells,  ponds,  latrines,  and  community  buildings  have  been\ndeveloped and are currently being applied by PDRDs.\n70. Microfinance. The third subcomponent will promote a savings and credit discipline at\nthe village level and will prepare and facilitate beneficiaries\u2019 access to the formal financial\nsystem that, at present, rarely extends beyond provincial or district towns or peri-urban areas.\nThe microfinance subcomponent will utilize the skills and experience of NGOs that have been\nsuccessfully implementing poverty-focused microfinance activities and supporting village-based\nmicrofinance groups for several years in northwest Cambodia. Several of these NGOs are in the\nprocess  of  transforming  themselves  into  formal  registered  and  regulated  microfinance\ninstitutions (MFIs), which will link informal and semiformal village-based savings and credit\ngroups to the formal financial system in the future.22 The Project will not provide a separate\ncredit line, but will support NGO and MFI outreach activities to strengthen existing village-based\nmicrofinance groups and create new groups in the project area. Contingent on the strength and\ncapacity of the village groups to absorb external credit, they will then be free to pursue access\nto external loans through the NGO/MFI program or other programs of their choice. The Project\nwill take a flexible approach to the model of village-based microfinance groups used, as different\nNGOs are successfully implementing different models.23 Benefits will take the form of increased\nmobilization of local savings and access to credit, that can be used for productive investment or\nprovide a buffer against economic shocks (e.g., medical emergencies), or both. The poor\u2019s\naccess  to  the  microfinance  activities  will  be  enhanced  through  the  poverty  focus  of  the\n                  \n22 Loan 1741-CAM(SF): Rural Credit and Saving Project, for $20 million, approved on 27 April 2000, is supporting\ndelivery of effective rural financial services through MFIs (and some key NGOs on an interim basis prior to their\ntransformation to MFI status) operating in most of the country. Close coordination will be sought with this ongoing\nproject to ensure complementarity.\n23 Among the models being used are a credit union approach, which currently is only mobilizing local savings without\nusing external credit lines, and a village bank approach, which both mobilizes local savings and makes loans from\nexternal credit lines. However, both are based on group management and group guarantees, and both provide\ntraining to the group and its leaders in credit, savings, management, bookkeeping, etc. Even the credit union\nmodels have plans to begin accessing external loans to meet the great demand for credit. The main difference in\napproaches is therefore the timing of access to external loans.", "19\nNGO/MFI outreach methodology and the transparent nature of group decision making, as well\nas  the  use  of  group  guarantees  rather  than  physical  collateral.  The  Project  will  provide\nadditional training to trainers in the NGOs/MFIs to strengthen outreach, management, and\naccess to external credit lines. Provincial and district staff of PDRD will also be encouraged to\nattend this training, and will receive additional training in microfinance to ensure their capacity to\nmonitor implementation of the NGO/MFI service contracts.\nC. Cost Estimates\n71. The project cost, inclusive of contingencies and taxes and duties, is estimated at $34.8\nmillion equivalent, consisting of a foreign exchange cost of $11.8 million (34 percent) and local\ncurrency  cost  of  $22.8  million  equivalent  (66  percent).  No  recurrent  costs,  other  than  the\nincremental annual operating costs of management support and infrastructure maintenance in\nthe initial years of implementation, will be financed under the Project (summary cost tables are\nin Appendix 4).\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nComponent Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

The detailed cost estimates of the project management component include all costs\nrelated to the support provided by the Project to MRD and the project liaison office in Phnom\nPenh, and to the project management unit  (PMU) in Sisophon (para. 76) for (i) incremental\npersonnel, communications, office premises (PMU in Sisophon and PDRD in Samrong, Oddar\nMeanchey Province), office equipment, travel, transport, administration, and accounting; (ii)\nconsulting  services  (international  assistant  project  manager)  to  assist  the  PMU  in  project\nimplementation and coordination; (iii) establishment of an IRAP Planning Unit in the rural road\ndepartment of MRD, and consulting services (international and domestic IRAP specialists) to\nassist MRD in institutionalizing IRAP.", "20\nD. Financing Plan\n73. The proposed ADB financing is for a loan of $27.2 million equivalent (78 percent of total\nproject  cost),  including  $15.3  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  (Table  2).  ADB\nfinancing of the local currency cost is justified on the basis of the low level of national income\n($257 per capita estimated in 2000) and savings (11 percent of the national income in 2000) as\nwell as the Government's fiscal deficit (5.5 percent of gross domestic product). The balance of\n$7.5 million will be financed by the beneficiaries and the Government. The ADB loan will be\nfrom the Special Funds resources with a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years.\nThe  annual  service  charge  will  be  1.0  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent\nthereafter. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development Bank 11.80 15.30 27.20 78.30\nGovernment 0.00 7.40 7.40 21.30\nBeneficiaries 0.05 0.08 0.13 0.40\n      Total  11.85 22.78 34.73 100.00\nNote:   Figures may not add up to totals due to rounding.\nE. Executing Agency\n74. MRD will be the Executing Agency on behalf of the Government as this is the ministry\nwith a mandate for rural development and the one with the best network of representation in\nrural  areas  of  the  northwestern  provinces.  MRD  has  increased  its  technical  and  project\nmanagement skills considerably through practical experience in projects financed by ADB24 and\nothers.  It  has  also  demonstrated  satisfactory  performance  in  executing  these  projects,\nparticularly  in  complying  with  the  financial  covenants  for  the  timely  submission  of  audited\nreports, the release of counterpart funds and overall financial accountability.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n75. The Project will adopt implementation arrangements that conform to the Government's\ndecentralization  and deconcentration policy, utilizing successfully tested aspects of the pilot\nSeila Program currently operating in the target provinces. The Project differs from previous\nADB-funded projects that utilized centralized implementation units based in the national capital\nwith responsibility for provincial activities. A small project liaison office will be established within\nMRD  in  Phnom  Penh,  comprising  a  project  coordinator,  an  assistant  coordinator,  and  a\nsecretariat. The office will liaise with the other project management and implementation units\nestablished at the provincial level and will provide the necessary coordination with the Ministry\nof Economy and Finance (MEF) for the release of funds to all project imprest accounts.\n76. A PMU to be established in Sisophon, the capital of Banteay Meanchey Province, will be\nresponsible for day-to-day management of the Project and will accommodate the technical\nspecialists recruited in support of project activities. The PMU will be staffed with (i) a project\n                  \n24 Loan 1385-CAM(SF):Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project (footnote 5). Loan 1824-CAM(SF): Emergency\nFlood Rehabilitation Project (footnote 3). Loan 1753-CAM: Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project\n(footnote 12).", "21\ndirector; (ii) four staff covering administration, procurement, and accounting; and (iii) a sufficient\nnumber of support staff. Technical support will be provided by four international specialists\n(assistant  project  manager,  hydrologist,  engineer/trainer,  and  community  development\nspecialist) plus three project technical staff (training coordination, monitoring and evaluation,\nand information systems). The PMU will be responsible for (i) project-wide management issues\nsuch  as  coordinating  training,  negotiating  service  contracts,  providing  consulting  services,\nmonitoring and evaluation, and preparing annual work plans and budgets; (ii) coordinating and\ngiving technical and management support to PIUs established in the provinces; (iii) managing\nthe project imprest account and reporting the liquidation of funds through this account to MEF\nvia  the  Executing  Agency;  and  (iv)  replenishing  funds  to  the  second-generation  imprest\naccounts managed in the provinces.\n77. A PIU will be established within PDRD in each of the four project provinces and will be\nresponsible for day-to-day management of project activities at the provincial level including (i)\npreparing and supervising contracts for civil works, (ii) preparing provincial work plans and\nbudgets, and (iii) reporting progress of the various components under its management. Each\nPIU will be staffed by six government employees, four (manager, engineer, technician, and\nfinancial administrator) already appointed under the Working Group established to implement\nthe ADB-funded EFRP (footnote 3), plus two incremental staff (contract manager and one\nadministrative assistant) to be assigned from PDRD. Being based in PDRD, the PIU will also\nhave access to in-house expertise and technical specialists from other sections on an as-\nrequired basis. The PIU will (i) accommodate the local community development specialist and\nlocal infrastructure engineer assigned to each province to support project initiatives, and (ii) be\nresponsible for managing the second-generation imprest account and reporting liquidation of\nfunds through this account to the PMU.\n78.  The fact that the Project will fund schools, health facilities, and other small-scale village\ninfrastructure  highlights  its  multisectoral  nature  and  the  need  for  coordination  between\ngovernment agencies with responsibility for those sectors. Coordination is required to ensure\nnot only consistency with the respective development plans but also allocation of funds for\nongoing operation and maintenance. Coordination will also be required with other projects being\nimplemented in the provinces and other independent NGO activities. The PRDC chaired by the\nprovincial governor and with representation from all provincial line agencies (Appendix 5), has\nresponsibility for coordinating these programs through the formulation of the provincial strategic\ndevelopment plan and the provincial investment plan. As such, PRDC is ideally placed to\nachieve  the  necessary  coordination  with  other  program  activities.  Project  coordination  will\ntherefore be achieved through the respective PRDCs in the target provinces. All qualifying\ninvestments (screened and confirmed as pro-poor, financially viable, sustainable in the long\nterm, and environmentally sustainable by the PIU) will be referred by the PIU to PRDC for\nfunding  approval.  Approval  will  be  granted  for  project  financing  only  if  the  recommended\ninvestment  is  proposed  as  high  priority  in  terms  of  its  potential  impact  on  the  poor  and\nvulnerable groups, its viability, its sustainability, and consistency with sector plans. Project\nmanagement and implementation structures are presented in diagrams in Appendix 5.\n79. A strategic approach that will be adopted during project implementation will dictate the\nrate at which initiatives can be introduced to rural villages. The Project will progressively extend\naccess by rehabilitating the tertiary road network starting from the provincial or secondary\nnetwork and extending it to the isolated rural areas of the Project. As year-round access is\nsecured, community development activities, including establishment of small-scale community-\nbased infrastructure, will be initiated in communes and villages in the impact area of the road\n(referred to as \u201cintensive villages\u201d). Similarly, larger-scale investments other than roads will be", "22\nundertaken only after roads have been rehabilitated so that the responsible departments and\nbeneficiaries can use the structures established under the Project.\n1. Project Component\na. Rural Infrastructure Development\n80. PIUs will be responsible for implementing this component, which involves civil works for\nrehabilitating or constructing rural roads, markets, schools, and health facilities. The full-time\nlocal infrastructure engineer in each PIU and the international infrastructure engineer and the\nhydrologist based in the PMU will give support in technical aspects and in managing contracts.\nAfter investments have been identified and prioritized for funding using IRAP and confirmed as\npriority investments by PRDC, the PIUs will be responsible for the survey and design of civil\nworks  and  the  preparation  of  bid  documents,  including  specifications  and  all  necessary\ndocumentation. The PIUs will invite tenders from an approved list of prequalified contractors for\nconstruction of civil works under local competitive bidding. Supervision and quality control of\nconstruction  works  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  assisted  by  the  PDRD,  or  will  be\nsubcontracted  to  consulting  engineers  as  part  of  the  construction  costs  and  following\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Labor inspectors will monitor labor-based contracts.\n81. The Project will support the issuance of land titles and occupancy rights through suitable\narrangements with the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction25 to\nprotect the interests of project beneficiaries occupying house and agricultural plots along the\nrehabilitated  road  alignments.  Land  titles  will  be  issued  in  accordance  with  procedures\nestablished under the Land Law promulgated in August 2001. Currently, about 70 percent of\nland titles issued to married couples are registered in the name of both husband and wife. The\nProject will ensure that this practice continues in the project area.\n82. Any market upgrading will be subject to prior ADB approval of an economic and social\nfeasibility  study  (including  a  short  resettlement  plan  if  needed)  according  to  established\nguidelines (Appendix 6). Before any construction or upgrading activities are implemented, a\ncommittee for the market concerned will be established, and market user fees will be agreed\nupon between MRD and the market committee.\nb. Capacity Building\n83. Three  categories  of  capacity  building  have  been  identified  under  the  Project:  (i)\ngovernment  agency  capacities,  (ii)  private  sector  and  NGO  capacities,  and  (iii)  planning\ncapacities in MRD and PDRDs (institutionalization of IRAP).\n84. Capacity building in the technical areas, including infrastructure design and hydrology,\nwill be delivered by the international and domestic specialists funded by the Project and will be\ncoordinated by the PMU and PIUs. Agency staff will also receive extensive training in (i) their\napproaches to communities; (ii) project planning, supervision, and monitoring; (iii) environmental\nassessments; and (iv) other topics as appropriate. This training will be complemented with on-\nthe-job  training  alongside  NGOs  that  are  more  familiar  with  participatory  approaches  in\n                  \n25 The Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction is assisted in executing its mandate to\nimplement the new Land Law (August 2001) and to issue land titles by ADB: TA 3577-CAM: Implementation of\nLand Legislation for $600,000, approved on 13 December 2000; and an incoming project to be funded jointly by\nWorld Bank, GTZ  and the Government of Finland to support land management,  cadastral survey and land titling\nactivities.", "23\ncommunities. Most training-of-trainers activities will be coordinated by the PMU through the\ntraining coordinator, whereas lower-level training activities will be coordinated by PIUs and\nNGOs, as appropriate.\n85. Capacity building directed at the private sector and local NGOs will be coordinated by\nthe PMU. Training for the private sector will be directed toward construction contractors, the\nfledgling consulting engineering industry, and the materials testing laboratory to be supported by\nthe Project. Such training will be implemented under contractual arrangements by competent\ninstitutions or consulting services provided under the Project.\n86. Capacity  building,  especially  in  IRAP  planning  procedures  and  techniques,  will  be\nprovided for the Department of Rural Roads recently established in MRD and its provincial\ndepartments. It will be achieved through a combination of formal training courses available from\ncommercial trainers and from on-the-job training obtained under a contractual arrangement with\na suitably qualified organization such as ILO with experience in this technical area.\nc. Rural Livelihood Enhancement\n87. NGOs  will  implement  community  development  initiatives.  Prequalified  NGOs  will  be\ncontracted by the PMU to provide an agreed-upon range of services to achieve the identification\nof priority investments and support community development activities. Such expertise exists\nwithin international and domestic NGOs currently operating in Cambodia, some of which have\nexpressed interest in cooperation.26 This component will be supported and coordinated by an\ninternational community development specialist (based in the PMU) and four local provincial\ndevelopment officers, one attached to each PIU.\n88. After  the  commune  councils  have  identified  and  prioritized  small-scale  rural\ninfrastructure investments at commune and village levels through participatory screening of the\ncommune investment plans, the PIU will involve the councils and the local community-based\norganizations in implementation to further develop their capacity. Ultimately, these local bodies\nwill be responsible for contracting out any construction works to small local contractors or\npieceworkers from the province on a negotiated basis. The beneficiary commune development\ncommittee, in cooperation with the PIU, will monitor construction and certify completion of small-\nscale works, which will form part of the certification for payment to contractors.\n89. The microfinance subcomponent will be phased in intensive villages as the road network\nis progressively upgraded and access is improved. It will be implemented in the target districts\nin accordance with the strategic approach adopted for infrastructure development as the road\nnetwork is expanded. The PMU will contract out savings and credit activities in participating\nvillages  to  prequalified  NGOs  and  MFIs  with  the  appropriate  skills  and  experience  in\nmicrofinance.  Each  PIU  will  assume  a  coordination,  support,  and  monitoring  role.  The\nNGOs/MFIs will be assisted through a short-term savings and credit specialist who will help\nwith initial program design, technical input, and training for NGO/MFI staff as required. The PMU\nwill be responsible for managing NGO/MFI service contracts, and PIUs will have a supporting\nrole  in  contract  administration  and  reporting  of  the  NGO/MFI  activities  in  their  respective\nprovinces.\n                  \n26 CARE  International,  ZOA  Refugee  Care,  Norwegian  People\u2019s  Aid  (NPA),  Catholic  Relief  Services  (CRS),\nAustralian Volunteers International, and several domestic NGOs active in the project area.", "24\n2. Project Implementation Schedule\n90. The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years.  In  the  first  two  years,  essential\ninfrastructure (PMU, PIUs, and PDRD premises in Oddar Meanchey) will be constructed; project\nmanagement  structures,  procedures,  and  arrangements  will  be  developed;  and  capacity\nbuilding (IRAP planning, orientation, and other incremental technical training of agency staff and\ncontracted  NGOs)  will  be  initiated.  Initial  identification  and  planning  of  larger-scale  rural\ninfrastructure will be undertaken so that rehabilitation of rural roads can commence in the dry\nseason of the second year of implementation. This relatively long period of preparation is\nnecessary  to  allow  (i)  significant  capacity  building  to  ensure  sound  implementation,  (ii)\nidentification of priority road alignments for rehabilitation, (iii) issuance of land titles or certificate\nof occupancy for holdings within the zones adjoining the roads to be rehabilitated, and (iv) de-\nmining  of  prioritized  alignments.  Within  each  project  district,  intensive  activities  such  as\nscreening of investment plans and village microfinance activities will be initiated as the road\nnetwork is progressively rehabilitated. These intensive activities are estimated to start in 9, 15,\nand 15 communes in years two, three, and four, respectively. This is equivalent to 40, 68, and\n66  incremental  villages  in  each  year  when  intensive  activities  will  be  initiated.  The\nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.\n3. Procurement of Goods and Services\n91. Goods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured\nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will\nbe  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than\n$500,000 equivalent, or by international shopping where the cost is valued from $100,000 to\n$500,000. Where there are several local suppliers with satisfactory service facilities, equipment\nor materials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured under local competitive\nbidding (LCB) procedures, or on the basis of a comparison of at least three quotations from\nlocal  suppliers,  where  the  cost  is  less  than  $50,000.  Final  details  regarding  packages  for\nprocurement will be determined during project implementation (a tentative procurement package\nis in Appendix 8).\n92. The civil works to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan, including all eligible\nitems identified through the Project's screening procedures, will be procured in accordance with\nLCB procedures among prequalified private local contractors acceptable to ADB. Given the\nsmall  and  scattered  nature  of  the  civil  works,  individual  contracts  are  unlikely  to  attract\ninternational bidders. Domestic contractors have the capacity and capability to undertake the\nrequired contracts. For contracts to be undertaken using LBAT, contractors will be prequalified\nby the PIUs, provided that the contractors attend a training workshop at project commencement\nand  comply  with  required  performance  and  financial  criteria.  Each  PIU  will  update\nprequalification  annually,  based  on  contractor  performance  and  the  reports  of  the  labor\ninspectors  engaged  under  the  Project.  Domestic  contractors  for  mechanized  civil  works\ncontracts  will  be  prequalified  by  the  PMU  in  consultation  with  PIUs,  using  government\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Small-scale civil works valued at less than $10,000 may be\nprocured after comparing at least three quotations from local contractors.\n93. As project initiatives will be approved at the provincial level and implementation will be\ncarried out by PIUs, national steering and/or coordination committees will not be established, as\nthey  would  only  add  to  the  management  difficulties  and  introduce  potential  delays  in\ndisbursement. With PRDCs being chaired by provincial governors, who have the power to direct\ndepartment directors, the necessary authority exists to achieve inter-sector coordination.", "25\n4. Consulting and NGO Services\n94. For successful implementation of the Project, consulting services are required in the\nareas  of  project  management,  civil  works  design,  hydrology,  regional  planning,  IRAP  and\naccessibility mapping, community development, microfinance, and environmental assessment.\nThe  relatively  high  input  of  consulting  services  identified  under  the  Project  is  considered\nnecessary in view of the low level of human resource capacity and technical expertise available\nin  the  Government  at  both  central  and  provincial  levels,  the  limited  domestic  specialist\nresources,  and  the  importance  of  ensuring  comprehensive  participatory  planning  and\nimplementation in project activities. Specialist inputs will be needed to introduce new technology\nthrough the Project and will also be used extensively to conduct much of the training outlined in\nthe capacity-building component.\n95. The Project will provide about 333 person-months of specialized services of domestic\nconsultants and about 129 person-months of international consultants in both long- and short-\nterm appointments through consulting firms (summary consulting services and packaging are in\nAppendix  9).  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging\ndomestic consultants. For consulting services related to IRAP activities, a contract may be\nnegotiated directly with ILO, which has the experience in this technical area and has been\nproviding it in the context of a similar project in Cambodia for the last three years. The Project\nwill also engage local institutions for technical training through competitive bidding according to\nADB  procedures.  Where  the  number  of  suitably  qualified  institutions  is  limited,  direct\nnegotiations may be applied with prior approval of ADB.\n96. The services of international and domestic NGOs are required in screening priority\ninvestments, community empowerment and development activities, and establishing village-\nbased savings and credit schemes. To the extent possible, prequalified NGOs will be contracted\non the basis of competitive procedures. Where the number of prequalified NGOs is limited,\ndirect negotiations may be applied, with prior approval of ADB.\n5. Advance Action\n97. ADB  has  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance  action  in  recruiting\nconsultants and preparing for construction of the PDRD premises in Oddar Meanchey and the\nPMU premises in Sisophon. Advance action will also facilitate capacity building in the initial\nstages  of  implementation  and  identification  of  activities  to  be  financed,  and  ensure  the\ncommitment  of  counterpart  funds  required  early  for  de-mining  of  road  alignments.  The\nGovernment has been informed that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to\napprove or finance the Project, and does not include retroactive financing.\n6. Operation and Maintenance\n98. Rural roads to be rehabilitated under the Project and some selected strategic existing\nalignments will require routine and periodic maintenance27 during and after the Project. Both\nloan  funds  and  counterpart  funds  will  be  provided  for  maintenance  activities  during\n                  \n27 Routine maintenance, including activities such as filling potholes, must be done on a regular basis to ensure the\ncontinued operation of roads. This is carried out at relatively low cost ($350 per year per km) using the LBAT\nmodel. Periodic maintenance involves overlaying of surface material once every 3-5 years at a maximum cost of\n$4,000 per km.", "26\nimplementation. Loan funds will be provided on a declining share over time (100 percent for\nyear 1 after loan effectiveness, 75 percent for year 2, 50 percent for year 3, 25 percent for year\n4,  and  none  afterward),  while  counterpart  funds  will  increase  proportionally  to  meet  full\nmaintenance requirements by project completion. The Project will also (i) assist in establishing\nrural road maintenance committees at the district level, similar to the ones recently established\nin seven districts of Siem Reap Province, to gradually take responsibility for coordinating,\norganizing, and managing maintenance of roads improved under the Project; (ii) in areas of high\npopulation density, train local maintenance groups with workers paid a daily rate (as under the\nRIIP project); and in less populous areas, use small local contractors or pieceworkers for\nmaintenance; (iv) provide technical support and training in maintenance procedures to PDRD\nrural  roads  offices  and  to  district  road  maintenance  committees;  (v)  introduce  preventive\nmeasures that restrict the size of vehicles permitted to use rehabilitated roads and traffic on wet\nroads; and (vi) explore the introduction of alternative low-cost labor-based technologies for more\ndurable road surfacing materials (e.g., bamboo reinforced concrete, dressed stone paving,\nhand-laid bituminous surface dressing, etc.) that are being tested in the project area by ILO.\n99. The Project will also provide funds for maintaining schools and health facilities through a\ndeclining loan funding arrangement similar to the one adopted for rural road maintenance. The\nO&M  of  village  infrastructure,  such  as  water  supplies  and  other  facilities,  will  be  the\nresponsibility  of  the  beneficiaries,  who  will  be  assisted  through  community  development\nactivities,  appropriate  training,  and  associated  awareness  campaigns.  For  constructed  or\nupgraded markets, the established market committees will be responsible for O&M of market\nfacilities, and will finance these activities with market user fees so as to enhance cost recovery.\n100. To ensure effective and timely disbursement for maintenance of the rural infrastructure\nrehabilitated or constructed under the Project, the Government will establish in each project\nprovince a separate maintenance account. This account will be regularly replenished from\ncounterpart  funds  (disbursed  from  government  budgetary  allocation\u2013i.e.,  the  recently\nestablished national rural road funds, and from other available/planned national or provincial\nsources)  provided  for  the  O&M  activities  of  the  Project  (Table  A8.3  in  Appendix  8).\nDisbursement from these maintenance accounts will be jointly managed and monitored by the\nrespective PDRDs and PIUs and regularly reviewed by the PMU and ADB. The accounts will be\nsubject to a separate audit opinion (as part of the overall project annual external audit) to ensure\nthat the funds deposited in them are strictly applied to the purpose for which they were intended.\n7. Disbursement Procedures\n101. The Government will make available through budgetary allocation the proceeds of the\nloan to MRD and PMU to be applied to finance project expenditures.\n102. To expedite disbursements, MRD and PMU will each establish a first-generation imprest\naccount  with  a  recognized  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  immediately  after  loan\neffectiveness. Payments will be made to and from these accounts for eligible expenditures\nunder the Project. Four second-generation imprest accounts will also be opened by PIUs at\nrecognized commercial banks acceptable to ADB in the project provinces. These accounts will\nbe used to meet eligible expenditures under the Project incurred by the four PIUs. Each imprest\naccount will be managed by MRD, PMU or the concerned PIU, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan\nDisbursement Handbook (January  2001),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the\nGovernment and ADB. The initial combined total amount in all imprest accounts will not exceed\nsix months of estimated expenditure and not more than 10 percent of the total loan. ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditures procedure will be followed to reimburse expenditures and liquidate", "27\nimprest accounts for payments below the ceiling of $50,000. The fund flow mechanism is\ndiagrammatically presented in Figure A5.4 of Appendix 5.\n103. During project processing, ADB's anticorruption policy was explained to government\nofficials, particularly the section on fraud and corruption, as stated in ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n8. Reporting, Accounts, and Audits\n104. The PIUs will provide the PMU with concise quarterly progress reports during each year\nof implementation, detailing the physical and financial progress of activities against agreed-upon\ntargets and summarizing benefit monitoring and evaluation results. In turn, the PMU will submit\nto MRD consolidated quarterly progress reports and a comprehensive annual progress report,\nand MRD will forward these reports to the Government and ADB. Within three months of project\ncompletion, a project completion report in the standard ADB format will be prepared by the PMU\nand submitted to ADB. Progress reports will include a follow-up of the progressive Government\nimplementation  of  its  decentralization  and  deconcentration  policy  and  the  consequent\ninstitutional change in the project provinces.\n105. The PMU and PIUs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the\ngoods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received,\nexpenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. Accounts will be established\nand maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and following the\nguidelines  in  the  Project  Accounting  Manual  of  MEF  as  amended  from  time  to  time.\nConsolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  compiled  by  the\nPMU/MRD and audited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The\naudited accounts, audit report, and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not\nlater than twelve months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n106. During the initial three years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews. Initial\nreviews will (i) determine if all proposed implementation arrangements are appropriate and in\nplace, (ii) assess the progress of infrastructure screening activities, (iii) review the construction\nprogram for civil works, (iv) review the poverty focus of the different components, and (v) review\nthe conduct and outcome of the capacity building and training programs. During the third year,\nADB and the Government, will undertake a comprehensive midterm review. The midterm review\nwill  evaluate  the  actual  physical  and  financial  progress  of  the  Project,  community-based\napproach,  implementation  procedures,  procurement  performance,  PMU  effectiveness,  and\nperformance  of  the  consultants.  Before  the  midterm  review,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a\ncomprehensive report identifying issues for the mission\u2019s consideration. On the basis of the\nresults  of  the  midterm  review,  and  especially  in  view  of  the  expected  progressive\nimplementation  of  the  Government's  decentralization  and  deconcentration  policy  and  the\ninstitutional changes that are likely to occur during the project period, changes in project design\nand implementation arrangements will be considered.\n9. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n107. Outputs of the Project will be monitored and evaluated in terms of efficiency (quantities\ndelivered) and effectiveness (quality of the goods/services delivered and their impact on the\nbeneficiaries). Gender-sensitive participatory approaches will be adopted in monitoring village\nand commune activities. The services required under NGO contracts will include facilitation of\nparticipatory monitoring in the construction of village infrastructure, as well as its use by the", "28\nvarious vulnerable groups in the community. To generate data on the immediate effects and the\nbroader impacts of the project investments on socioeconomic development, poverty reduction,\nand the empowerment of vulnerable groups, a baseline survey will be conducted at the start of\nintensive  activities  in  each  commune  and  village.  The  communities  will  develop  their  own\npoverty indicators that will be used during subsequent impact assessments. This will establish\nthe control against which the project impact will be assessed. Subsequent comprehensive\nassessments will be undertaken two years after intensive activities have been initiated and at\nproject completion to assist in impact assessment in addition to annual socioeconomic data\nupdates undertaken by PDRD and information generated by WFP, LPP, and IRAP on an\nongoing basis.\n108. One of the key areas for impact monitoring will be the incidence and length of food\ninsecurity in the project area. This will be monitored, drawing on information generated by WFP\nand outputs from participatory monitoring conducted under NGO contracts. Similarly, the extent\nof village savings mobilization will be monitored by cooperating NGOs and its impact on income\ngeneration activities will be reported regularly as required under NGO contractual obligations to\nthe respective PIUs. Construction contractors will be required to monitor and report the person-\ndays used in construction and the wages paid for such services. The impact of improved access\nwill be monitored through farm input and output prices as well as through NGO-facilitated\nannual  reviews  using  participatory  techniques  involving  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.\nQualitative assessments will indicate how improved access has contributed to changing the\nsocial services available in the areas. The effects of project activities to increase beneficiary\nparticipation  and  to  increase  the  institutional  capacity  of  local  government  bodies  will  be\nmonitored  through  participatory  evaluation  exercises  facilitated  by  the  technical  specialists\nprovided under the Project. Key indicators that will be used to monitor the performance of the\nProject in achieving its overall objective are in Appendix 1.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Measures\n109. An initial environmental examination (IEE) carried out for the Project concluded that the\nrisk of a negative impact on the environment is minor. In accordance with ADB requirements28\nand Cambodian law, selected road alignments will require individual IEEs and, in some cases,\nmay further require an environmental impact assessment (EIA). Similarly, road rehabilitation will\nrequire  environmental  monitoring.  Incremental  deforestation  and  incremental  use  of\nagrochemicals  due  to  agriculture  intensification  are  other  environmental  risks  that  were\nexamined. They are unlikely to cause any significant impact, but will require monitoring where\nsuch impact is expected. The current environmental assessment and monitoring capabilities of\nthe Provincial Environmental Department (PED) and the PDRD in the four project provinces are\nweak due to limited experience. The Project will provide appropriate environmental training for\nselected staff from these departments in the project provinces. The training will require an\ninternational environmental assessment trainer for two months at the start of the Project. A\ndomestic environment consultant will be employed for two months to work with the international\nenvironmental assessment trainer and subsequently for two months in years 2 and 3 and one\nmonth in years 4 and 5 to check the work of the four PDRDs and PEDs in preparing the IEE/EIA\nfor the next year\u2019s proposed road alignments. The domestic environment consultant also will\n                  \n28  ADB's Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects, 1993; and Environmental Guidelines and\nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements, 1998.", "29\nreview  the  PDRD\u2019s  and  PED\u2019s  environmental  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  road\nalignment for quality assurance.\n2. Social Measures\n110. The Legacy of War. Poverty in the project area can be attributed to the extended period\nof  conflict.  A  significant  part  of  the  population  has  suffered  extreme  conditions  such  as\ndeprivation,  refugee  camps,  internal  displacement,  famine,  and  family  disruption.  Social\ncohesion, especially in the newly established villages, is low.29 Persistent food insecurity and\ncontinued  exposure  to  land  mines  further  compound  the  desperate  living  conditions.  Poor\nfarmers obtain livelihood from farming, herding, hunting, and collecting forest products, even in\nmined  areas.  The  implications  for  people\u2019s  ability  to  work,  plan  for  the  future,  and  solve\nproblems  are  rarely  discussed  and  poorly  understood.  The  current  state  of  community\ndevelopment  can,  in  part,  be  attributed  to  trauma-related  stress,  highlighting  the  need  for\ngreater  inputs  in  training,  encouragement,  and  follow-up  activities.  The  Project  will  take\nadequate account of these characteristics through its strategic phased approach.\n111. Mines  and  Unexploded  Ordnance.  Years  of  armed  conflict  have  led  to  an\nunprecedented degree of mine and UXO contamination in Cambodia, with some of the highest\nconcentrations found in the northwestern provinces. Villagers have often resettled before de-\nmining was completed. They tend to clear individual house lots, farmland, and the pathways to\naccess common property such as forestland or water sources. Adult males make up 53 percent\nof  casualties,  which  reflects  their  higher  involvement  in  clearing  land  for  cultivation,  and\ncollecting timber and nontimber forest products. Casualties among women are 6 percent and\nchildren under 18 years old, 41 percent. The high incidence of child casualties seems to be a\nresult of their tampering with mines and UXOs and their lack of awareness of the dangers. The\nProject will take adequate account of these dangers, with de-mining to be done according to\ninternational standard operating procedures and in adequate response to the needs of the rural\npopulation (paras. 60 and 138-iv). The use of community minefield marking teams will be\nincluded, as there is a need to clear pathways to safely access village infrastructure, health\nfacilities, and schools constructed under the Project. Mine awareness training will be given to\nthe population, specifically targeting children and following an improved, more people-centered,\nand needs-based approach.\n112. Lack of Infrastructure and Access to Services. In the course of intensive social\nsurveys undertaken during project preparation and confirmed during loan processing, villagers\nidentify the improvement of roads as their number one priority. Other infrastructure (schools,\nhealth services, markets, clean water supplies, and rice drying and storage facilities) are often\nnonexistent or in complete disrepair. Their lack limits access and hinders economic and social\ndevelopment. In partnership with NGOs, the Project will put procedures in place to ensure that\nbeneficiaries,  including  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  are  consulted  during  the  identification,\nprioritization, planning, survey, and design stages. Securing their livelihood occupies the poor\nand very poor throughout the year and does not leave them time for voluntary work. The two\ngroups have to be paid adequately. Wherever possible every effort will be made to ensure that\nthe poorest local people are given priority for jobs through LBAT. The Project will engage labor\ninspectors to ensure that poor members of communities, especially women, are informed of job\n                  \n29 A project funded by a grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), Reducing Trauma-Induced\nPoverty in Northwestern Cambodia, aimed at the most vulnerable groups in the project area, is being developed in\nconjunction with the Project. The JFPR project will be implemented over a three-year period and will enable the\nwar-affected poor to participate in village development and to access government services. The JFPR proposal will\nbe presented to the Government of Japan in December 2001.", "30\nopportunities and that workers are paid in full and on time at current market rates. Road safety\ncampaigns will be carried out in communities along the roads rehabilitated under the Project.\nChildren should be specifically targeted through the schools. Speed breakers will be installed in\nvillages to reduce dust and as an additional safety measure (Table A2.3).\n113. Previously, villagers experienced problems in managing small-scale infrastructure due to\nlack of participation in prioritizing and decision making. The Project will consider longer time\nspans for preparing villagers, making sure that the technologies used are appropriate; that\nlocation and designs are adequate; that prioritization of small infrastructure includes the poor\nand vulnerable groups, especially women; and that local capacities to manage the facilities are\nstrengthened. Constructing latrines and improving access to water will go hand in hand with\nawareness-raising campaigns and thorough training in maintenance, hygiene, and preventive\nhealth care.\n114. Security of Land Tenure. The provinces of Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem\nReap  report  high  incidences  of  land  disputes,  which  have  often  disadvantaged  the  poor.\nInfrastructure development, particularly the road improvements, will further increase the value of\nland along those roads and increase the risk of land disputes. The Project will ensure that\nproject beneficiaries will be supported in obtaining ownership title or other occupancy rights in\naccordance with the Land Law (para. 61). No new roads will be constructed, the existing road\nalignments  will  not  be  widened,  and  no  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  are\nexpected except for a few isolated cases that will require the preparation of a short resettlement\nplan to be submitted to ADB for approval. Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement will not\noccur in the context of constructing social infrastructure, as public land is available and the\nconstruction sites will be identified in consultation with the communities. There are isolated\ncases where a few households have settled on market premises. Any decision on the upgrading\nof such markets will be subject to submission of an economic and social feasibility study,\nincluding a short resettlement plan for ADB's approval if the need arises.\n115. Lack of Social Cohesion. New settlements and resettlements are located along roads\nto  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  and  comprise  former  internally  displaced  persons,\nrepatriated refugees, and internal migrants in search of better economic opportunities. A high\nnumber  of  formally  or  informally  demobilized  soldiers  reside  in  the  target  area.  They  are\nintegrated into the villages and earn their living through farming. They will benefit equally from\nthe Project as other villagers. Social cohesion between the different groups is lacking; tensions\nexist along political lines and between groups, particularly regarding favoritism in the distribution\nof development assistance. The Project will consider the situation and will contract selected\nNGOs for the community development activities using participatory processes and a transparent\nand open community decision-making process. No ethnic minorities live in the project area.\n116. Gender Issues. Women form the majority of the working age population in the project\narea (51.4 percent). Generally, the Khmer system provides equal rights to males and females\nwith  regard  to  property,  ownership,  and  inheritance.  In  practice,  these  norms  have  been\nmoderated by traditions and an environment that values men more than women. Women\u2019s roles\nstill tend to be seen as being good wives, which means being submissive, docile, and assuming\nhousehold duties. Their role in decision making at the village, commune, and higher levels\nremains weak and needs strengthening. Their workload is considerable, comprising household\nmanagement; caring for children, the sick, and elderly; and also agricultural work such as land\nclearing and hunting. Women heads of households are forced to take on men\u2019s roles and\nresponsibilities, and the absence of men increases the disparities in income. Such women are\nunable to clear and prepare the same amount of land and therefore produce less food. If they", "31\nseek wage labor, they are often paid less than men.\n117. The Project will take women\u2019s roles and different economic and social conditions into\nconsideration. The strategy to address their needs, constraints and participation includes (i)\nspecifically targeting women heads of households for employment and equal pay in the labor-\nintensive  road  construction  works;  (ii)  training  in  management  and  maintenance  of  small\ninfrastructure; (iii) encouraging women to expand their income-generating activities through\nmembership and active involvement in the savings and credit groups (at present 75-80 percent\nof beneficiaries reached in similar schemes are women); (iv) organizing women-only discussion\nand planning groups to allow them to speak freely; (v) timing the training, discussions, and\nplanning sessions according to women\u2019s availability; (vi) providing functional literacy, particularly\nnumeric literacy training; (vii) supporting and training female members of village development\ncommittees, other community-based organizations, and the future commune councils to allow\nfull participation in public meetings; (viii) specific awareness campaigns for men and women on\njoint registration and land titling; and (ix) information and awareness-raising campaigns using\nwomen-specific information channels.\n118. Through improved access to water and sanitation and improved hygiene and health,\nwomen\u2019s workloads will be reduced to enable them to participate more actively in decision\nmaking in village development activities. The cooperation of the provincial and district personnel\nof the Ministry of Women and Veterans\u2019 Affairs will be sought. The four community development\nspecialists  under  the  Project  will  have  a  proven  track  record  in  gender  and  development\nactivities, and will coordinate and supervise the implementation of the strategy.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic Analysis\n119. The Project was formulated as part of the Government's objective of poverty reduction in\nthe  rural  areas  of  northwestern  Cambodia.  SEDP  II  (2001-2005)  not  only  provides  for  a\nredistribution  of  public  investment  in  the  social  sectors  (health  and  education),  but  also\nrecognizes the key role that the transport network plays in providing access to facilitate the\ndelivery of social sector services and to stimulate economic activity. The Project supports the\nGovernment's focus in these sectors with the overall goal of poverty reduction, with some 70\npercent of total costs being allocated to infrastructure establishment and rehabilitation. The\namount will be directed primarily at road rehabilitation, health and education facilities, and small-\nscale infrastructure to be established in the communes and villages of the target area. The\nimproved  access  and  incremental  social  services  made  available  through  these  public\ninvestments constitute the necessary prerequisites for economic growth in northwestern rural\nCambodia. The Project will also attend to the needed capacity building in government agencies,\nin  beneficiary  communities,  and  in  the  private  sector  to  ensure  efficient  implementation.\nFurthermore, it will promote a savings discipline among vulnerable groups and others in the\ntarget villages as a precursor to accessing formal credit facilities to finance production activities\nat district and provincial levels.\n1. Benefits\n120. The impact of the Project will be evident at several levels. The benefits from an improved\nrural  road  network  will  be  realized  by  all  inhabitants  throughout  the  project  area,  totaling\n580,000 people or 114,000 rural families, of whom 40 percent live below the poverty line.\nAdditional benefits will be received by communities within the area of influence of the rural road", "32\nnetwork from further investments in small-scale infrastructure where the impact will be more\nlocalized. An estimated 40 communes or about 180 villages will benefit from these investments\nfollowing the establishment of year-round access along rehabilitated roads.\n121. Benefits identified from the project interventions all relate to improved access. In the\ncase of the rehabilitation of rural roads, farmers will have improved access to production inputs\n(e.g., seed and other planting material) and to government extension services to support the\nnew  technologies.  With  better  market  access,  they  will  be  able  to  consider  production\nalternatives and higher-value crops. They will benefit from reduced transport costs for input\nsupplies and the marketing of production surpluses. With reduced transport costs, farmers will\nrespond to production incentives through the price mechanism that will further stimulate rural\nfood production and contribute to reducing the extensive periods of food insecurity in the target\nareas.\n122. In addition to these production-oriented benefits, inhabitants of rural communities will\nhave better access to health and education services. The cost of seeking medical treatment will\nbe reduced and the time spent traveling to reach these facilities will be reduced significantly.\nWith year-round road access, the services will be available during the wet season when malaria\nis an area-wide problem. Vehicle operating costs (VOC) and people\u2019s travel time will also be\nreduced. One of the direct benefits during the construction phase is the use of LBAT on some\n60 percent of the 613 km to be rehabilitated. Based on the estimated labor input of 2,000\nperson-days per km achieved in the RIIP, some $0.75 million will be directly injected into the\nlocal economy, which will stimulate economic activity, where there is already a high propensity\nto spend.\n123. Benefits identified from investing in small-scale village infrastructure will be received by\nfewer individuals, but will still represent a significant outcome for the Project. Water remains one\nof the primary concerns expressed by villagers during project preparation. The Project will\nrespond to this concern with the construction of an estimated 170 wells and some 60 ponds.\nTraining in public health and hygiene associated with the provision of water facilities will have a\nsignificant impact on the villagers' capacity to work and pursue their livelihoods. The Project will\nalso assist in establishing small local businesses to produce the squatting slabs for pit latrines\nand, possibly, concrete rings, further contributing to increasing economic activity in the area.\n124. Economic evaluation cannot capture all benefits described, but has estimated those\narising from the anticipated agricultural production surplus, savings in VOC, and value of travel\ntime saved. Details for the analysis of each component are in Appendix 10.\n125. The base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the road rehabilitation and\nmicrofinance components is 19.79 percent. The analysis is based on conservative assumptions.\nSensitivity analysis indicates that only in two combination scenarios does the EIRR fall below 12\npercent.  The  highest  risk  is  if  the  funding  for  road  maintenance  does  not  materialize  as\nprogrammed. If funding is only 50 percent of what was planned, benefits will fall substantially\nand reduce the EIRR to 7.17 percent.", "33\nTable 3: Summary of Sensitivity Analysis\nItem Change EIRR (%) Switching Value (%)\nBase case 0 19.79\nAgricultural producer surplus -20% 17.82 -68\nVOC and times savings -20% 16.37 -46\nAll benefits -20% 14.25 -28\nAll costs +20% 15.21 +38\nDelay in Benefits 2 years 12.67\nCombination 1:\nAll benefits -20 10.26\nAll costs +20\nCombination 2:\nFunding of maintenance costs -50% 7.17\nAll benefits years 2 to 5 -30%\nAll benefits years 6 onward -50%\n2. Nonquantifiable Benefits\n126. Benefits  that  are  less  easily  measured  include  the  impact  from  capacity-building\nactivities. These will be directed at improving the technical and management skills of PDRD,\nwhich will be institutionalized within government structures and as such, will continue to be\navailable for development activities in the future. Similarly, a significant investment will be made\nin MRD planning capacity and its provincial offices with the establishment of IRAP, the Ministry's\npreferred planning tool. This tool will provide the capacity to rationalize rehabilitation plans\nbased on poverty reduction criteria and will be extended countrywide over time.\n127. In terms of community development, the Project will assist in strengthening the self-\nreliance of the poor and vulnerable groups in communities by giving them a voice in determining\nfuture community development activities. It will also support the Government's decentralization\ninitiatives by strengthening the village and commune leaders to enable them to carry out their\ntasks more effectively.\nB. Impact on Poverty\n128. Poverty is widespread in the project area with its causes and characteristics largely\nattributed to the long period of conflict and instability. It is evident in (i) people\u2019s lack of access to\nrural roads and markets, (ii) limited access to social services, (iii) persisting food insecurity, and\n(iv) low levels of social cohesion.\n129. The most immediate project impact will be in providing employment for the people,\nespecially the poor and vulnerable groups that will receive priority in working on the rural road\nrehabilitation  works.  Documented  benefits  reported  from  labor-based  road  construction  in\nCambodia by ILO and NGOs include increased availability of daily necessities at lower prices\n(up to 50 percent), increased sales of local produce at higher prices (up to 100 percent), and\nreduced prices of consumer goods. Furthermore, enhanced access to agricultural extension and\ninputs, and to health and education services will increase household incomes and contribute to\npoverty reduction. The rehabilitated markets will give farmers better opportunities to sell their\nproduce for higher prices, and will offer better sanitary facilities that will reduce health and\ndisease problems. Markets also facilitate social interaction, including information dissemination,", "34\nwhich will positively impact on social cohesion. The construction of primary schools will improve\neducation levels in villages and reduce distances children have to walk to school, thus reducing\nschool dropout rates. The improved access to water and sanitation facilities at the village level\nwill improve hygiene and reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. It will also reduce\nwomen\u2019s workload as they are responsible for collecting drinking water as well as for taking care\nof the sick.\n130. The adoption of an inclusive process of prioritization where the needs and priorities of\npoor and vulnerable groups are considered and project activities related to enhancement of\nrural livelihood will contribute considerably to trust and confidence building among these groups,\nto  their  recognition  within  the  communities,  and  further  social  cohesion.  Participatory\napproaches  in  identifying  needs  and  subsequent  training  in  the  management  and  use  of\nfacilities will also ensure beneficiaries\u2019 appreciation of the value of these investments and\ncommitment to their sustainability.\n131. The savings and credit initiatives will considerably contribute to trust and confidence\nbuilding, the gain of self-esteem, and a protection against economic shocks particularly for the\npoor and vulnerable. The provision of land titles to people settling along road alignments will\nassure poor people of ownership and an additional assurance in times of extreme shocks.\nC. Risks\n132. De-mining of rural road alignments to be rehabilitated under the Project is a critical\nactivity  in  implementing  the  rural  infrastructure  development  component.  It  is  the  financial\nresponsibility  of  the  Government,  and  untimely  release  of  the  counterpart  funds  for  these\nactivities may result in implementation delays. This issue is being addressed by timely reporting\non the release of counterpart funds following the approval of annual work plans. It is also\ncovered in a specific assurance given by the Government.\n133. The major risk associated with rural roads is inadequate maintenance. Under the RIIP\nand earlier projects implemented by ILO, systems and procedures for routine and periodic\nmaintenance of rural roads that were developed and tested have demonstrated satisfactory\nresults and cost-effectiveness. Sustainable financing arrangements and a legal framework to\nsupport such arrangements still need to be developed. The RIIP is currently assisting MRD in\naddressing this issue. The ADB-funded Transport Sector Strategy study is also addressing the\nissue of road network maintenance. The project design provides a component for rural road\nmaintenance and requires the Government to shoulder a substantial share of maintenance\nexpenditures  during  the  investment  period.  The  Government  has  given  specific  assurance\nregarding the timely availability of the counterpart funds.\n134. A common cause of implementation delay in Cambodia is the lack of qualified trained\ncounterpart staff with experience in aid-funded projects. This should not present a problem for\nthe Project, as MRD has generally performed satisfactorily in implementing ADB projects. To\nfurther mitigate the risk, (i) the PMU and PIUs will be supported by expertise in technical and\nfinancial project management, (ii) capacity building will be provided for government agencies\nserving the rural development sector in the project area, and (iii) NGOs and local institutions will\nbe contracted to provide a mix of services to facilitate implementation.\n135. For small-scale village infrastructure investments, the Project is dependent on commune\ninvestment  plans  generated  under  the  LPP  as  its  point  of  entry  in  prioritizing  eligible\ninvestments. This, in turn, is dependent on the LPP activities funded by the Seila program. It is", "35\nrecognized that the Seila program has not achieved full coverage of the target project districts.\nWhile there are plans to achieve 100 percent coverage (whereby all communes will have\ncommune investment plans) by the start of the Project, the rapid expansion of the Seila program\nposes a risk that the communes may not possess investment plans by the time access roads\nhave been rehabilitated and intensive activities under project financing are ready to begin.\nShould this situation arise, the screening process planned under the Project will have to be\nupgraded to a more comprehensive facilitation, identification, and prioritization process, still\nworking with the poor and vulnerable groups to achieve the desired outcome of infrastructure\ninvestments.\n136. The overall project goal of poverty reduction will be addressed through the provision of\ninfrastructure in support of rural development. It is recognized that the road network is the\nnecessary prerequisite for socioeconomic development in isolated rural areas\u2013and is the main\noutput of the Project. Spontaneous development cannot be expected immediately after road\naccess is achieved, as a road alone is not a sufficient condition for development. There needs\nto be further investment in production-oriented or income-generating initiatives, in developing\nsocial services, in strengthening local governance, and in enhancing community cohesion. A\nrisk is that such investments will not eventuate, which will reduce the Project's potential impact.\nThe Government, aid agencies, and NGOs recognize northwestern Cambodia as one of the\nmore  needy  regions.  The  international  community  has  given  high  priority  to  development\nassistance in this area, as has ADB. With the likelihood of further development projects being\ndirected in this area, the risk is considered minimal.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n137. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n(i)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  LBAT  will  be  used  for  rural  road\nrehabilitation under the Project wherever possible; (b) the poor and very poor\npopulation  (50  percent  of  them  being  women,  subject  to  availability)  will  be\noffered employment in road rehabilitation work; and (c) labor inspectors will be\nengaged to confirm gender equity in the contractor\u2019s employment practices and\npayment to the workers of the appropriate market wage rate in a timely manner.\n(ii)  The  Government  will  (a)  ensure  that  during  the  implementation  period,\ngovernment  counterpart  funds  required  for  maintaining  rehabilitated  or\nconstructed rural infrastructure are made available on a timely basis and at an\nincreasing rate to match the declining provision of funds from the proceeds of the\nloan (Appendix 7, and Table A8.3 in Appendix 8) and are deposited with the\nmaintenance accounts (para. 100) established at the provincial level; and (b)\nfollowing  project  completion,  make  available  necessary  funds  for  full\nmaintenance of the rural infrastructure rehabilitated or constructed under the\nProject.\n(iii)  The Government will be responsible for de-mining the alignments along tertiary\nroads to be rehabilitated under the Project. For that purpose, the Government will\n(a) carry out or authenticate a level-one survey of the project area; (b) contract\nrecognized and accredited de-mining organizations to clear the road alignments\nof any land mines and UXOs, according to accepted international practices,", "36\nfollowing a sequence to be agreed upon by the PMU, the concerned PIU, and the\nde-mining teams; and (c) engage the services of a reputable and experienced\nmine security organization, acceptable to ADB, to confirm whether the respective\nroad alignments are clear of mines. The Government will ensure that no road\nrehabilitation will be undertaken until required de-mining has been completed and\ncertification on that is obtained. The Government will also ensure that counterpart\nfunds are made available on a timely basis (Appendix 7, and Table A8.3 in\nAppendix 8) for such de-mining activities.\n(iv)  The  Government  will  engage  a  reputable  and  experienced  mine  security\norganization acceptable to ADB to (a) carry out, in accordance with accepted\ninternational  practices,  de-mining  of  areas  where  community  facilities  will  be\nconstructed; and (b) in conjunction with the physical de-mining, clearly demarcate\nsafe areas adjacent to the community facilities and conduct appropriate mine\nawareness training among the local population.\n(v)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  high  priority  will  be  given  to  further  mine\nclearance in lands suitable for settlement and agriculture, which are rendered\naccessible by the roads rehabilitated under the Project.\n(vi)  The Government will give all necessary support to persons who were lawful\noccupants of the Project area on the date of promulgation of the 2001 Land Law,\nto obtain titles of possession and subsequently titles of ownership to the land in\naccordance with the provisions of the Land Law. The Government will ensure\nthat  persons  who  will  migrate  to,  and  settle  in  previously  uninhabited  areas\nadjacent to roads rehabilitated under the Project, and who pursuant to criteria to\nbe  developed  under  the  Land  Law  and  its  implementing  legislation  and\nregulations can be given the right to occupy such areas, will be given legal\nevidence of such right before completion of the Project.\n(vii)  MRD will make available office space and facilities within the Department of Rural\nRoads in Phnom Penh to accommodate the establishment of IRAP and other GIS\nmethods  to  be  used  under  the  Project.  In  addition,  MRD  will  provide  the\nnecessary staff and basic office equipment to support provincial IRAP activities.\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  wherever  possible,  public  markets  will  be\nconstructed only on existing market sites or public land that is not occupied or\nused  otherwise  by  private  persons.  In  selecting  markets  for  upgrading,  the\nGovernment  will  take  into  account  the  views  of  target  beneficiaries  through\nsurveys and meetings at the village, commune, and district levels.\n(ix) The Government will ensure that adverse environmental impact resulting from the\ncivil works under the rural infrastructure component of the Project, as identified in\nthe relevant IEE or EIA or both, is mitigated through measures acceptable to ADB\nand in accordance with the relevant environmental laws and regulations.\n(x)     The Government will ensure that the poor and vulnerable people in the project\narea  will  be  able  to  participate  in  prioritizing,  planning,  implementing,  and\nmonitoring  village-based  infrastructure  and  that  gender-sensitive  participatory\napproaches  will  be  employed,  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Framework  for\nMainstreaming Participatory Development Processes.\n(xi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  special  measures  will  be  undertaken  to\npromote the participation of women in the project activities. To such end, in each\nproject  district  (a)  training  in  management  and  maintenance  of  small", "37\ninfrastructure will have at least 30 percent women; (b) functional literacy and\nparticularly  numeric  literacy  training  will  be  given;  (c)  supported  community-\nbased organizations will consist of at least 30 percent female members who will\nreceive special support and training to allow them full participation in public\nmeetings; and (d) awareness campaigns will be organized for men and women\non joint land registration and titling.\nB. Condition for Loan Effectiveness\n138. Prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  Government\u2019s  evaluation  of  proposals  from  shortlisted\nconsulting firms for all the consultants to be engaged following competitive bidding procedures\nwill be submitted to ADB for its concurrence.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n139. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 21,292,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Northwestern Rural\nDevelopment Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1

Poverty in Cambodia\n \n 1. Cambodia ranks 137th out of 174 countries in poverty and is among the poorest countries in\nSoutheast Asia according to the United Nations Human Development Report. Only the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic (PDR) ranks lower at 140. Life expectancy at birth is 53.4 years,  the lowest in\nSoutheast Asia. The adult literacy rate (66 percent) is lower only than the  Lao PDR\u2019s (58.6 percent).\nInfant mortality (106 per 1,000 live births) and maternal mortality rates (900 per 100,000 live births)\nare the highest in the region.\n \n 2. Poverty is severe and extensive, with pronounced inequality in consumption. It seems that a\nlarge percentage of the population is grouped close to the poverty line so that economic events or\npolicy  changes  could  significantly  alter  the  percentage  of  people  below  the  poverty  line.1  The\nconsumption-based absolute poverty line for Cambodia has been defined as adequate income to buy\na daily 2,100-calorie food basket plus a small allowance for nonfood expenditure. In 1997 it was\nestimated that about 36 percent of the population, over 4 million people, were below this poverty line.\nUrban areas are relatively better-off than the rural areas. About 90 percent of the poor (3,700,000) live\nin rural areas.\n \n 3. The causes and characteristics of poverty to a large degree can be attributed to the long\nperiod of conflict and instability, the damage and hardships done to the population who experienced\nkilling and death, forced labor, and displacement. The execution of educated Cambodians during the\nKhmer  Rouge  era  certainly  contributes  to  the  low  levels  of  human  capital,  greatly  hampering\ndevelopment efforts. Huge damage has been done to the infrastructure.\n \n 4. The Cambodian poor, as the Cambodia HDR 1999 reports, tend to have less access to\nproductive resources. They live in villages with less access to markets, infrastructure, and economic\nservices; and no access to educational or basic health services. As a result they often suffer from\nfood shortages, which can lead to indebtedness and the loss of farm assets. Poorer villages have\nhigher illiteracy rates and higher levels of gender disparity in literacy.\n \nB. Rural Livelihood and Poverty in the Northwestern Provinces\n \n1.      Legacies of the War\n \n 5. Postconflict Trauma. The four provinces in northwestern Cambodia comprising the project\narea2 only recently emerged from 30 years of warfare and massive displacement.  Whereas most of\nCambodia had begun to enjoy peace by the early 1990s, fighting continued in the northwest until\n1998. The far more recent experiences related to violence and displacement add another dimension\nto poverty in the project area. The majority of the population has suffered extreme conditions such as\ndeprivation,  refugee  camps,  internal  displacement,  famine,  and  disruption  of  families,  rape,  and\ntorture. Many have witnessed violence to the extreme, including death or killing since the 1970s.\nSocial  cohesion  in  the  villages,  especially  the  newly  established  ones,  is  low.  Persisting  food\ninsecurity and continuing threats to life due to the high incidence of land mines further compound the\ndesperate living conditions. To secure their livelihood, poor villagers are forced to farm, herd, hunt,\nand collect products even in these mined areas. The implications of the past traumatic experiences\nand  the  continuing  dangers  for  the  development  of  the  individual  and  the  community\u2013such  as\npeople\u2019s ability to work, to plan for the future and to solve problems\u2013are rarely discussed and little\nunderstood. But the extremely slow community development and the need for high inputs in terms of\n                                                \n 1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). Country Operational Strategy, Cambodia, July 2000.\n 2  Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Oddar Meanchey, and Siem Reap.", "Appendix 2, page 2\n45\neffort, training, encouragement and follow-ups in the project area can be partly attributed to trauma-\nrelated stress and have to be considered.\n \n 6. Mines and Unexploded Ordnance. Years of armed conflict have led to an unprecedented\ndegree of mine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination in Cambodia with some of the highest\nconcentrations in the northwestern provinces. Nine of the 14 districts in the project area rank among\nthe 30 most affected districts (out of a total of 183 districts in the country) for mine casualties as these\nareas experienced the most protracted conflicts between the Khmer Rouge and the government\nforces. Mine accident rates are highest in districts where returning refugees from the Thai border have\nopened new land. Villagers have often resettled before de-mining was done. Usually, the villagers\nclear individual plots for housing, farming, and the pathways to access common property such as\nforestland or water sources. Adult males make up 53 percent of casualties, which reflects their higher\ninvolvement in clearing land for cultivation, and collecting timber and nontimber forest products.\nCasualties among women are 6 percent and children under 18 years, 41 percent. The high incidence\nof child casualties result, of their tampering with mines and UXO, and their lack of awareness of the\ndangers.\n \n 7. Displacement and Migration. Displacement, which started in the late 1960s was caused by\nbombing along the eastern part of Cambodia. In 1975, the Khmer Rouge forced inhabitants of cities to\njoin the agriculture revolution in the countryside. In 1978, many Cambodians were also forced to flee\nthe country when the Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge from power. Thousands fled to\nThailand and settled in camps along the border. In 1989, the Vietnamese troops withdrew from\nCambodia. The rebels resumed fighting and gained ground, resulting in the internal displacement of\n190,000 Cambodians in 1989-1991. The displaced originated mainly in the northwestern provinces.\nBy  1991,  some  360,000  refugees  were  repatriated,  and  resettled  mostly  in  the  northwestern\nprovinces.  In  1997,  the  resurgence  of  fighting  generated  a  new  wave  of  displacement,  54,000\ninternally and 48,000 to new camps along the Thai border. In 1998, refugees returned from the Thai\nborder camps and most settled back in their villages of origin.\n \n 8. Lack of Social Cohesion. In 1999, the population in the targeted districts was 517,689 and\naverage household size was 5.1 (Table A2.1). Female heads of households comprised 14.4 percent,\nlower than the national average of 19.5 percent. The population in the project area is young, with\nchildren forming 42 percent of the total. The number of disabled people (1.95 percent) is higher than\nthe national average (1.51 percent). Only 59 percent of the children aged 5-14 years attend school.\nThe reported literacy rate for adults in the project area is 33.4 percent for women and 42.9 percent for\nmen.\n \n 9. New settlements and resettlements along roads to be rehabilitated under the Project comprise\nformer internally displaced persons, repatriated refugees, and internal migrants in search of better\neconomic opportunities. A high number of formally or informally demobilized soldiers reside in the\ntarget area. They are integrated into the villages, earn their living through farming, and will equally\nbenefit from the Project as the other villagers. Social cohesion in the groups is lacking; tensions exist\nbetween groups, particularly due to favoritism in the distribution of development assistance. No ethnic\nminorities live in the project area.\n \n 10. Labor Shortage\u2013Food Insecurity. Labor shortage is the number one constraining factor for\nhigher food production in the project area. The high loss of the male population during the war has left\nan unbalanced sex ratio and a deficit of male labor needed for agricultural work. In the majority of the\nsettlements, the people\u2019s main preoccupation and investment are in clearing and preparing land for\nhouse lots and cultivation. They are reestablishing their livelihood systems, which is a slow process.\nThe collection of timber and nontimber forest products, as well as hunting and fishing are important\nlivelihood  activities  to  supplement  the  poor  people\u2019s  survival.  According  to  the  World  Food\nProgramme (WFP), more than 40 percent of the population in the target districts do not have food", "46\nAppendix 2, page 3\nsecurity.  Where  villages  have  re-established  themselves  and  people  resumed  normal  farming\nactivities, most are planting one wet season rice crop per year.\n \n \n Table A2.1: Overall Demographic Information\n Demographic Indicator  Cambodia  4 Provinces  14 Districts\n Population 1999  11,182,468  2,246,490  517,689\n Percent of country representation  100  20  4.6\n Estimated population 2001  11,737,000  2,358,000  543,000\n Number of households 1999    2,110,000     423,015  101,120\n Average household size (persons)  5.30  5.31  5.13\n Percent households with female heads  19.5  14.8  14.4\n Age dependency ratio  76.8  83.5  84.5\n Sex ratio  93.6  94.3  95.6\n Disabled persons prevalence (per 1,000)  1.51  1.66  1.95\n Adult literacy rate  62.8  46.2  38.1\n School attendance (5-14 years old, %)  66.5  63.1  59.0\n Population with access to safe drinking water (%)  29  17.7  6.5\n Population with access to latrine (%)  14.5  12.5  3.8\n Source: Data  compiled from National Census 1998 and other sources.\n \n \n 11. Land Tenure. Before 1960 the land belonged to the god-king with usufruct rights for the\nindividual farmer. The attempt of the French administration to introduce French land law was not\nsuccessful. Under Pol Pot and the Vietnamese administration, all land was state-owned. Privatization\nof land started in 1986 and an increase in poverty was observed.  Significant parts of the land\nbelonged to the military, were regarded as spoils of war, and would not be released without monetary\ncompensation. Returnees were disadvantaged during the 1993 and the 1998 repatriation. If land was\ngranted, it was of poor quality and heavily mined. As land was distributed on a first-come first-serve\nbasis,  internally  displaced  persons  arriving  earlier  than  the  returnees  from  the  camps  had  an\nadvantage. The provinces of Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap are considered areas\nwith a high incidence of land conflicts, which often disadvantaged the poor people in the past.\n \n2.      Community-Recognized Categories of Poverty\n \n 12. The results of the qualitative investigation undertaken under the project preparatory technical\nassistance (TA) show that the rural population distinguishes four poverty groups within the village: the\nvery poor, the poor, the medium-poor, and the better-off families. Decisive categories for well-being\nare (i) a certain state of mind; (ii) the level of food security; (iii) economic characteristics like the\navailability of labor, draft animals; and (iv) material assets (Table A2.2). By these categories of\npoverty, about 45 percent of the population in the older established villages and 75 percent of the\npopulation in new settlements in the investigated area characterize themselves as poor and very\npoor. Old established villages appear to comprise relatively more families belonging to the medium-\npoor and better-off strata, whereas new settlements and resettlements do not have better-off families\nat all. Only the medium-poor and better-off families would belong to the group above the national\npoverty line.\n \n \n \n ", "47\nAppendix 2, page 4\n3.      Access to Infrastructure and Services\n \n 13. Transport Infrastructure. Road infrastructure in the project area is poor. Most of the villages\nin the target districts cannot be accessed during rainy season, some are cut off for several months per\nyear. Some roads are little more than cart tracks or footpaths. The entire province of Oddar Meanchey\nis  inaccessible  during  2-3  months  of  the  rainy  season.  Villagers  indicate  that  they  receive\nconsiderably lower prices per kilogram (kg) of paddy sold than in villages with better road access.\nPoor road access is the cause of the lack of important economic and social services. Access to the\ndistrict is important because, in areas with low population density, most services are not available\nbeyond this level. Villagers identify improvement of roads as their number one need.\n \n 14. Social Infrastructure.  A number of villages have no access to school facilities within or at a\nreasonable distance from the village. About 50 percent of existing school facilities in the villages are in\nneed of repair. Existing health centers lack staff, equipment, and drugs. More than 96 percent of all\nhouseholds lack toilet facilities. The main sources of water are unprotected hand-dug wells (46\npercent) and rivers, ponds, and streams (41 percent). Only 6.5 percent of the households have\naccess to safe drinking water.\n \n4.      Community Decision Making\n \n 15. Village development committees (VDCs) have been established in the project area. They\nrepresent  the  villagers  in  the  commune  development  committee  (CDC),  organize  participatory\nplanning, and coordinate the management of development programs at village level. In the past,\nvillagers\u2019 involvement in decision making was either limited or non-existent, the selection of the VDC\noften predetermined by commune, district, and provincial authorities. As bottom-up planning using\nparticipatory approaches is a new concept, the community-based organizations are in need of further\nsupport and strengthening.\n \n 16. The local population is also not used to participation. They have only experienced being\nordered and told what to do. In addition, development assistance to the villagers is emergency in\nnature and relief oriented, and does not require them to participate in decision making.\n \n5.      NGO Activities in the Project Area\n \n 17. Due  to  Cambodia\u2019s  severely  devastated  human  resources,  and  the  embargo  that  most\nWestern governments imposed with the Vietnamese military takeover, aid agencies were prevented\nfrom establishing themselves in the country. Providing assistance to the Cambodian Government was\nleft to international nongovernment organization (NGOs). Although bilateral agencies have returned,\nthe number of international NGOs is still high; currently more than 250 are active in the country.3\nSome of them are in the process of transforming into local organizations, but due to the lack of\nnational skilled and professional managers, this process is slow.\n \n18. More than 100 NGOs are found in the project area, where they contribute substantially to the\nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  communities.  The  number  is  higher  in  the  provinces  of\nBattambang and Siem Reap, than in Banteay Meanchey. In Oddar Meanchey, only few NGOs are\nactive at present. Some of them are emergency relief organizations, but quite a number combine the\nprovision of most needed small-scale village infrastructure with livelihood programs, or cooperate with\nWFP in food for work. Many combine their activities with de-mining efforts in cooperation with trusted\nde-mining companies like Cambodian Mine Action Center, Mine Advisory Group, and Halo Trust.\nMost of them use participatory approaches and their target population is the poor and very poor,\nreturnees, the internally displaced, war widows, female heads of households, disabled persons, and\nmine victims.\n                                                \n 3  ADB. 1999.

Some of them have savings and credit programs, like CARE International. This program was\nrecently evaluated and is considered successful, functioning without external capital injections and\nallowing the small groups to grow slowly and according to their own capacities.  Many NGOs operate\nthrough the VDCs and respond to the prioritized needs that were identified in the local participatory\nplanning  approach.  Some  of  them,  however,  cross-check  the  priority  needs,  because  there  are\nreservations regarding the extent to which the very poor, the poor, and women have participated in\nthe planning exercises. The NGOs provide skills training; education, health, family planning, water\nand sanitation services; and training for HIV/AIDS4 awareness or mine awareness.\n6.      Gender Issues\n \n 20. Women form the majority of the working age population in the project area (51.4 percent).\nGenerally, the Khmer system regarding property ownership and inheritance is rather bilateral, and\nwomen and men have equal rights. In practice, the norms have been moderated by tradition and an\nenvironment that values men more than women exists. Women\u2019s role still tends to be that of being\n                                                \n4   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodefficiency syndrome.", "49\nAppendix 2, page 6\n\u201cgood wives\u201d which means being submissive and docile, and assuming household duties. In reality,\nwomen have become primary income earners in many households and started undertaking activities\nand assuming roles in the communities previously assigned to men. However, their role in decision\nmaking at the village, commune, district or higher levels is severely restricted. Even if women are\nmembers of the VDCs (30 percent is mandatory), they do not speak out. Poor and very poor women\ncannot afford to attend meetings due to their numerous chores in managing the household and\nearning a livelihood.\n \n 21. In the household, women have a stronger position in decision making. They are in charge of\nthe family\u2019s cash; this, however, is a burden in those households where scarce resources have to be\nmanaged. Larger economic transactions are executed by the husband, but he usually gets the\nconsent of his wife. Land clearing, cutting timber, plowing, constructing the house, and tending large\nlivestock are men\u2019s tasks. Women are responsible for nursing and tending the young, the old, and the\nsick. They do the household chores, replenish water, and fetch firewood.  In agriculture, Cambodian\nwomen  share  in  land  preparation,  and  do  the  planting,  transplanting,  weeding  and  harvesting,\nselecting seeds and storing them. They thresh and mill grain.\nC.

The overall project approach to addressing social and poverty issues include (i) improving\nremote rural villages\u2019 access to transport and social infrastructure through the construction of rural\nroads and small rural infrastructure; (ii) applying a sequential approach wherein the poor and very\npoor population\u2019s rights to land along the roads are assured prior to road improvements; (iii) providing\ncapacity building for all levels of stakeholders to assure  inclusive participation in project planning,\nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation; (iv) targeting the poor and very poor for employment and\nadequate payment in labor-intensive construction to close the food security gap; and (v) introducing a\nsavings and credit scheme that is appropriate and adjusted to the poor population\u2019s needs. Effects of\nroad improvements on the population and mitigation measures were incorporated into the project\ndesign (Table A2.3).\nTable A2.3: Road Improvements, Their Effects on the Population\n and Mitigation Measures\nAssumed Negative Effects Mitigation Measures\nHealth  hazard  for  village  population  is Alternative surfaces (e.g., bamboo-concrete) currently\nincreased  due  to  higher  dust  incidence experimented in Cambodia will be used in settlement\n(laterite surface). areas. Speed breakers in villages will reduce dust.\nHigher speed of vehicles may lead to more Road  safety  campaigns  will  be  held,  targeting\naccidents. especially children; speed reducing measures in settled\nareas will be applied.\nThe value of land along the improved roads A  sequential  approach,  including  identifying\nand the risks of land conflicts will increase. beneficiaries, land use planning, land titling, and de-\nmining, will be used to assure land titling prior to road\nimprovements.\nOpening up of areas will increase access to As the Project will provide alternative incomes to the\nmine  areas,  resulting  in  further  clearing  of poor and very poor, the pressure to clear land or to\nland, which will be done especially by the poor collect timber and nontimber products will be reduced,\nand very poor. thus the danger of exposure to mined land.\nMine  awareness  campaigns  will  be  intensified,\ntargeting children to deter them from tampering with\nunknown  objects.  Public  land  around  improved  or\nnewly  built  social  infrastructure  will  be  de-mined,\npathways to newly built infrastructure will be de-mined\nand marked to allow safe access.", "50\nAppendix 2, page 7\n23. Stakeholder  Participation.  The  Project  was  prepared  with  the  extensive  participation  of\nstakeholders  at  all  levels,  including  beneficiaries.  Project  implementation  will  address  the  direct\nparticipation of villagers by (i) using local-level planning and the already existing prioritized village\ndevelopment plans, but thoroughly rechecking the poor and very poor population\u2019s consent and\npriority needs, with women being separately met to make sure their voices are considered; and (ii)\nbuilding  capacity  and  increasing  the  VDCs\u2019  and  commune,  district,  and  province  authorities\u2019\nunderstanding of participation and empowerment.\n24. Security of Land Tenure. The Project will start road improvements only after the beneficiaries\nalong the road alignments have been identified, registered, and received land titles. The Ministry of\nLand Management will be responsible for this, supported by the Project. Mechanisms already existing\nin  two  and,  until  the  end  of  the  year,  three  provinces,  the  land  use  planning  units/land  use\nmanagement units will also be supported by the Project to assure participatory processes.\n25. Gender Strategy. The Project will take women\u2019s roles into consideration. Women are primary\nincome earners; users of the infrastructure, especially the social infrastructure; and key persons to\nmanage the family budget. The strategy to address their needs, constraints, and participation includes\n(i) women-only discussion and planning groups to allow them to speak freely; (ii) timing the training,\ndiscussions, and planning sessions according to women\u2019s availability; (iii) providing functional literacy\nand particularly numeric literacy training for women; (iv) support and training to women members of\nVDCs to allow full participation in village meetings; (v) specific awareness campaigns for men and\nwomen on joint registration and land titling (the target is to achieve 75 percent joint land titles); (vi)\ninformation and awareness-raising campaigns using women as specific information channels; and\n(vii) targeting women particularly for the savings and credit groups (at present already 75-80 percent\nof women are reached in similar schemes). All activities will be done in close cooperation with the\nprovincial and district personnel of the Ministry of Women\u2019s and Veterans\u2019 Affairs. The four community\ndevelopment specialists under the Project will coordinate and supervise the implementation of the\nstrategy.\n26. Project  Management  Support.  The  Project  will  provide  four  community  development\nspecialists,  one  to  each  province  to  support  project  implementation  and  ensure  participatory\napproaches are used and the poor and the very poor are involved. Two of the four specialists will be\nwomen. All four will be gender-sensitive and have specific qualifications for gender analysis and\ngender-sensitive approaches in community development. The labor inspectors will ensure that poor\npeople have access to information on employment and are given preference for employment in labor-\nintensive road construction and for the required training. Community-based participatory monitoring\nwill be carried out, using simple indicators identified by the community (Table A2. 2).", "EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR\nProject Name Executing Agency Aid Agency Amount Duration Location\nGrant Assistance\nLabor-Based Rural Infrastructure ILO and MRD SIDA/DFID $3 million Jul 2000-Jun 2002 Siem Reap Province\nProgram -

Introduction\n1. The reconstruction and rehabilitation of 14 commune and district markets is envisaged in\nthe Northwestern Rural Development Project (NRDP) to provide upgraded market facilities in\nstrategic marketplaces as venues for economic activities and to reduce losses in the quality and\nquantity of produce. Many of the markets in the project area are in poor condition, and lacking\nproper drainage, provisions for garbage collection, or sanitary blocks and water supply. No\nselection has yet been made as the development of a market hierarchy in the project area is still\nat the very early stages. Identification and selection can only take place after the rehabilitation of\nthe  rural  roads  because  transport  infrastructure  supports  the  function  of  a  market  and\ncontributes to justifying the investment. The impact of different types of markets on poverty\nreduction has to be considered as well. A screening and appraisal process will be needed prior\nto any decision.\nB. Rationale\n2. Since  the  NRDP  aims  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  four  northwestern\nprovinces, the project activities include upgrading the local rural markets. These are basic\nproducer  markets  with  producers  directly  selling  small  quantities  of  perishable  and\nnonperishable  products  to  either  local  traders  or  to  local  consumers.  These  markets  also\nfacilitate farmers\u2019 diversification into vegetables, fruit, and small livestock as they provide outlets\nfor such products. A focus on this kind of market will therefore have a greater impact on poor\nfarmers  in  the  project  area.  Rehabilitating  of  such  markets  will  (i)  increase  the  physical\ncapacities  of  the  markets;  (ii)  improve  marketing  conditions  for  fresh  produce,  fish,  and\nlivestock; (iii) reduce losses of goods; and (iv) improve hygiene by providing water and latrines.\nC. Market Selection Criteria\n3. Markets  will  be  selected  using  the  following  criteria:  (i)  transport  infrastructure\nimprovement exists (including roads to be rehabilitated by the Project); (ii) efficiency and public\nhealth conditions are seriously limited; (iii) substantial level of trade in fresh produce exists (at\nleast 30 percent traders are farmer-sellers); (iv) a formal agreement with the relevant authorities\nstates that upgrading will be implemented through established market management committees\n(including  wholesalers,  retailers,  farmer-sellers,  and  local  authority  representative)  that  will\nsubsequently manage the upgraded market so as to ensure sustainability and cost recovery; (v)\npriority is given to upgrading the existing markets owned by the local government, and only in\nexceptional  and  justifiable  circumstances  will  the  development  of  a  new  market  site  be\nconsidered;  and  (vi)  a  socioeconomic  study  has  been  undertaken  and  comprises  a  rapid\nassessment of social conditions, including potential beneficiaries of improvements, potential\nnegative impact on poor groups of farmers-sellers, an estimate of the number of settlers staying\non the market premises, and a rapid assessment of the financial and economic viability of the\nmarket, and cost recovery expectations.\nD. Expected Scope of Resettlement\n4. The Appraisal Mission has rapidly assessed the scope of resettlement. Determining the\nexact number of people settling on the market premises has been difficult since in the absence\nof  proper  fencing,  alignments,  or  concrete  surfaces,  market  boundaries  are  often  not\nestablished  and  trading  activities  spill  over  to  adjacent  areas.  It  has  been  found  that", "62\nAppendix 6, page 2\noccasionally such cases occur in the project area.1 Those people will be affected by any\nplanned market reconstruction and rehabilitation and will need to be resettled. The number of\naffected people is estimated to be about two families per market. In accordance with Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) involuntary resettlement policy such resettlement is not significant\nand does not require a full resettlement plan. In cases where a limited number of settlers is\nidentified as residing within market boundaries, ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy calls for a\nshort resettlement plan to be prepared.\nD. Short Resettlement Plan\n5. At present there is no legally documented resettlement policy in Cambodia. But the\nGovernment recognizes that regardless of legal status, negatively affected settlers are entitled\nto compensation.\n6. The main principles of the resettlement plan follows: (i) minimize negative impacts as\nmuch as possible; (ii) carry out resettlement and compensation so as to improve or at least\nrestore the preproject living standards of the affected people; (iii) fully inform and consult closely\nwith affected people on compensation options and resettlement plan design; and (iv) provide\nasset compensation at replacement rates. The disbursement for each market to be rehabilitated\nwill be subject to ADB\u2019s approval of the socioeconomic feasibility study. A loan covenant makes\nthe start of civil works conditional on satisfactory implementation of the resettlement plan.\n7. The  resettlement  plan  should  contain  the  following  parts:  (i)  description  of  the\nsocioeconomic conditions of the affected people; (ii) discussion with potential affected people to\ninform the market rehabilitation and the need for relocation; and (iii) information for affected\npeople about resettlement/compensation options. Attempts will be made during detailed design\nto  avoid  or  minimize  adverse  social  impacts  on  the  settlers.  Wherever  possible,  market\nboundaries will be adjusted in a way that settlers do not need to be relocated.\n8. Compensation  will  be  at  replacement  value  for  lost  assets.  Transportation  and  a\nsubsistence allowance will be paid to cover any loss of income during the resettling period. A\nmaximum transport allowance estimated at $40 per household or assistance in kind will be\nprovided. The subsistence allowance is estimated at $50 per household. All unit prices for\ncompensation will be fixed before payment of compensation.\n9. The  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  and  representatives  from  a  nongovernment\norganization (NGO) working in the project area will monitor resettlement plan implementation as\npart of their regular monitoring activities. Grievance may be expressed to this NGO and the\nconcerns  raised  will  be  included  in  the  monitoring  report.  The  international  community\ndevelopment  specialist  will  assist  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  the  PIUs  in\npreparing, monitoring, and evaluating resettlement plan implementation. ADB review missions\nwill monitor the issue. Evaluation of resettlement plan implementation will be part of PMU\u2019s\nregular reports to be submitted to ADB.\n10. Resettlement activities will commence at the earliest in 2004. The PMU will provide\ntimely implementation schedules that indicate resettlement activities as they relate to the civil\nworks for market improvement on a case-by-case basis.\n                                                          \n1 This has been confirmed by a socioeconomic study conducted for ADB Loan 1385-CAM(SF): Rural Infrastructure\nImprovement Project , for $ 25.1 million, approved on  28 September 1995, where in 6 out of 12 markets studied,  a\nlimited number of settlers were found  within the market boundaries.", "IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n2002/03 2003/04 2004/05 2005/06 2006/07\nPreparatory Phase Rainy Dry Rainy Dry Rainy Dry Rainy Dry Rainy Dry\n1.Establish PMU in Sisophon\n2.Appoint national staff and Asst.

About 90 percent of the poor in Cambodia live in rural areas, where poverty is generally\nassociated with large families, low educational levels or illiteracy, and a high ratio of nonworking\nto working household members. The rural poor are heavily handicapped in terms of (i) land\nownership, housing, and other productive assets; (ii) access to basic social services such as\nhealth, education, water supply, and sanitation; and (iii) access to financial services. Decades of\ninternal armed conflict, low agricultural productivity, high indebtedness, and isolation due to\nseverely degraded access roads are often cited as causes of poverty in the rural areas. The\nproject area shares all these characteristics.\n2. The northwestern provinces also have many internally displaced persons who have\nelected to settle there after years of voluntary and forced exile as refugees in Thailand. This is\nalso an area where informally demobilized soldiers have settled, close to their former units.\nSome internal migration to these relatively land-rich provinces by families originally from the\nsouth and east also occurs despite the widespread danger of unexploded ordnance. Years of\ncivil unrest throughout the northwestern provinces have had a severe impact on the human\ncapital of the area as well as on the physical infrastructure. Consequently, the basic minimum\nneeds of communities are not satisfied and the incidence of food insecurity averages three\nmonths each year. The survival strategies adopted by households during the extended periods\nof  conflict,  particularly  in  the  northwestern  provinces,  have  also  resulted  in  unsustainable\nincome-generating activities from the exploitation of natural resources, to the extent that these\nare now significantly depleted.\n3. The Government's major objectives are to establish the rule of law, ensure economic\nstabilization with structural reform, strengthen capacity building, initiate protection of the natural\nenvironment,  and  foster  the  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  physical  infrastructure  and\nfacilities. The aim is to integrate Cambodia's economy into regional and world economies in a\nsustainable manner. The Government's poverty reduction strategy has three elements:\n(i)   decentralization  and  promotion  of  community  participation  in  project  selection,\ndesign,  and  implementation  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  equity  of  rural\ndevelopment interventions;\n(ii)   improvement of agricultural productivity, notably through greater public investment\nin rural infrastructure and establishment of rural financial services, to enhance the\nincomes of the rural poor; and\n(iii)   promotion of access to affordable rural social services, particularly for women and\nvulnerable groups.\nThe Project is built around these objectives and strategic elements, and its overall evaluation\nmust be made in the context of the well-documented fundamental needs of the project area.\nA.  Assumptions on Project Costs\n4. The detailed costs were prepared according to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB)\nstandards  using  the  COSTAB  software  package.  All  costs  were  denominated  in  2001  US\ndollars. The individual costs were based on either field inquiries in 2001 or interpolations from\nprior studies, adjusted by appropriate currency conversion and inflation series. An exchange\nrate  of  KR3,850  per  dollar  was  assumed  for  current  costs.  Physical  contingencies  were\nestimated for individual items based on Mission estimates, other ADB project data, and data\ncontained  in  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  Appraisal  Report-", "68\nAppendix 10, page 2\nAgricultural Development Support to Seila.1 International price contingencies were based on the\nWorld Bank's Commodity Outlook. Local inflation was estimated from data supplied by the\nMinistry of Economy and Finance (3.5 percent per year, 2002-2006). Taxes and duties were\napplied at rates supplied by the ministry and are netted out of the economic analysis.\nB.  Expected Impact of the Main Components\n1. Capacity Building\n5. The  proposed  capacity-building  component  is  extensive  and  recognizes  that\ncommunities in the project area have been badly affected by civil disruption and are therefore\nless familiar with participatory development processes than rural communities in other parts of\nthe country. The component supports the government policy to promote the empowerment of\ncommunities through decentralized planning. While a start has already been made through the\nSeila process of preparing commune investment plans, both technical and awareness training\nare required at the community and government agency levels. In view of the limited resources\navailable  to  the  Government  to  achieve  the  participatory  approach,  much  of  the  capacity\nbuilding  will  be  delivered  through  the  services  of  a  suitably  qualified  nongovernment\norganization (NGO) under a service contract agreement with the Project. The benefits of the\nproposed  comprehensive  and  integrated  program  of  technical  assistance  are  expected  to\nprovide  widespread  and  sustainable  benefits  through  the  more  effective  focusing  of\ndevelopment investment, harnessing of community participation, and strengthening of capacity\nat the grassroots.\n6. The Project will support the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and its provincial\ndepartments to upgrade infrastructure planning and implementation skills. There are obvious\nneeds for technical training in a wide range of skills (e.g., engineering survey and design,\nproject  management,  supervision  and  evaluation,  accessibility  mapping  and  infrastructure\nallocation,  computer  training,  etc.).  The  Project  will  address  these  needs  within  both  the\nprovincial departments of rural development (PDRD) and the private sector. The proposed\nassistance for developing the capabilities of the local contracting and consulting industries is\nalso expected to provide immediately tangible and long-term sustainable benefits. The Project\nwill provide much-needed technical support and training in maintenance procedures to the\nPDRD rural roads office, which will be responsible for monitoring and supervision, and to the\ndistrict road maintenance committees.\n2. Large-Scale Infrastructure\n7. The Project includes the construction of an estimated 613 kilometers (km) of rural roads\nat an estimated capital cost of $15,000 per km, or an estimated total cost of $9,195,000. The\nestimated average capital cost is based on substantial experience gained during the upstream\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) technical assistance (TA) to MRD for the Labor-Based\nInfrastructure Works Program. The exact length of roads to be built cannot be determined at this\nstage as all proposals will be screened, and possibly revised or rescheduled, following full\nevaluation using the integrated rural accessibility planning (IRAP). However, the total is not\nexpected to differ substantially from the initial estimate. In addition, approximately $9,800,000\n                  \n1  Seila, (a Khmer word meaning foundation stone) originated as UNDP\u2019s Cambodian Area Rehabilitation and\nRegeneration Project. With the continued support of UNDP and other aid agencies, Seila has evolved into a\nnational program operating in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Pursat, Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey, and\nRatanakiri provinces.", "Appendix 10, page 3\n69\nhas been allocated for construction of provincial and district infrastructure and facilities (e.g.,\nhealth facilities, schools, and markets) and strategic maintenance of roads. The need for such\nfacilities is readily apparent and the planning process is essentially one of ranking and rationing.\n8. The  ILO-TA  has  established  that  significant  effects  stem  from  rehabilitating  or\nreconstructing rural roads that are otherwise impassable in the wet season. These include\nincreases in cropping intensities and yields (resulting from improved access to markets and\nagricultural inputs), and the growth and diversification of trade and traffic. There are certainly\nalso less tangible but important benefits from exposing the rural population to new ideas and\nsources of information. Consistent with the reconstruction of the economy as a whole, there is a\nsense that rural areas are ripe for rejuvenation and modernization, given the provision of\nappropriate transport links. The use of labor-based appropriate technology (LBAT) will also\ngenerate an estimated 2,000 days of employment per km of road. The road component of the\nProject has been subjected to a full economic analysis (paras. 12-22).\n3. Livelihoods Enhancement\n9. The livelihoods enhancement component will stimulate economic activity at all levels of\nthe local economy: the province, district, commune, and village. The mechanisms through which\nthis may be achieved vary at each level\u2013an informal savings and credit program at the village\nand commune levels, and formal credit access at the provincial and district levels. These\nelements will be combined within an integrated strategy. Agency staff will be provided with on-\nthe-job training through NGO contracts to improve participatory processes at the village and\ncommune  levels.  At  the  village  and  commune  level,  savings  and  credit  groups  will  be\nestablished, and provincial and district staff will receive training in credit planning and delivery.\nCommunities will be made aware of linkages between the formal and informal credit markets,\nand credit group members will be trained in such basic areas as cash management, accounting,\nmanagement, and group leadership. The overall benefits of the component will include the\ndevelopment  of  the  savings  discipline  in  communities,  encouragement  of  community  and\nindividual initiative, fostering of private sector development and household income-generating\nactivities, boosting of new productive capacity, and creation of new job and work opportunities.\n10. The Project will also fund small-scale village facilities such as crop drying and storage\nfacilities, and multipurpose community buildings. The benefits of such investments in such\nfundamentally  deprived  communities  will  undoubtedly  be  substantial.  These  pro-poor\ninvestments will be established through a participatory process undertaken with the assistance\nof community development specialists during implementation. There is also a special case for\nthe provision of small bridges, culverts, and drifts in Oddar Meanchey Province in view of its\nvery  low  level  of  development  and  the  small  number  of  international  and  local  agencies\nproviding  support.  Poor  roads  and  lack  of  access  during  the  wet  season  are  hindering\ndevelopment efforts and leading to depopulation of some areas.\n11. Villagers  have  identified  water  supplies  as  priority  investments  and  the  project  will\nprovide funds for establishing both hand-dug ring-wells and mechanically dug boreholes (up to a\ndepth of 80 meters). These wells will be fitted with hand pumps if requested by communities.\nUser groups will be formed for each well and will be expected to raise funds for maintenance.\nTwo or three group members will be trained to maintain the pump and an initial set of basic\nspare parts will be provided together with training in health education to improve hygiene and\nencourage  the  construction  of  latrines.

Interested villagers will\nbe provided with the necessary technical training, assisted to identify the nearest sources of\nsupplies, and assisted to access credit.\nC.  Economic Analysis\n12. Economic analysis was limited to measuring the costs and benefits of the rural road\ncomponent and the microfinance component. Benefits from the capacity-building component\nand the small-scale village infrastructure, while expected to be significant, were not included\nbecause of the difficulty in quantifying the benefits. In all of the following, prices are expressed\nin the world price numeraire.\n13. The benefits of the road component were assessed at two levels: (i) expected increase\nin agricultural production surplus (APS), and (ii) reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOC) and\nvalue of time saved.\n1. Agricultural Production Surplus\n14. In the first Socioeconomic Development Plan (1996-2000), the Government aimed to\nachieve food security through a gradual increase in rice productivity. It was estimated that\nduring the last five years, the country achieved a surplus in rice production every year ranging\nbetween  100,000  tons  and  250,000  tons,  or  an  average  of  about  8  percent  of  the  total\nproduction.2 The Government also lifted a ban on rice exports in December 1995, and opened\nexternal markets for the Cambodian rice exports. In 2000, the volume of the rice export was\nabout 120,000 tons which is still about a quarter of the volume of rice exports in the 1970s\nbefore the long civil war.\n15. As in other regions of Cambodia, agriculture in the project area is characterized by rainfed\nlowland agriculture with a large number of small farm households. There are good potentials for\nan  increase  in  yield  and  cropping  intensity  in  areas  with  medium  to  high  soil  productivity,\nparticularly in the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap. With the provision of market support\ninfrastructure  such  as  rural  roads  and  market  facilities,  a  gradual  increase  is  expected  in\nincremental  agricultural  production,  primarily  rice  production  for  both  domestic  and  external\nmarkets. According to the current commune database data and project preparatory technical\nassistance (TA) survey data, households in the project area are at present engaged primarily in\nsubsistence  agriculture,  and  trade  surpluses  are  still  negligible.  There  is  a  small  surplus\nbetween  paddy  output  (57,878  tons  in  1999)  and  paddy  consumption  (57,678  tons).  The\nanalysis was restricted to the development and marketing of surplus paddy.3 Furthermore,\nbecause in practice microfinance loans in the project area are generally used for agricultural\npurposes, separate microfinance benefits are not included to avoid double counting. The costs\nof microfinance outreach financed by the Project are included, however, as they will contribute\nto agricultural productivity increases.\n16. The economic prices for traded inputs and outputs were determined using the latest\nWorld Bank commodity prices. Because rice is traded in both directions across the border with\nThailand, an arithmetic mean of the prices of rice of varying quality (the higher quality mainly\n                  \n2   The Ministry of Planning, the Royal Government of Cambodia.

Restricting the analysis to paddy\nsurpluses is therefore a conservative approach.", "71\nAppendix 10, page 5\ntraded for export) was used as a basis, adjusted for internal transport, milling, and trading\nmargins. Input prices were estimated in the same manner. The economic prices of nontradable\ngoods were based on local price information, with the application of ADB's current standard\nconversion factor for Cambodia (0.90). A shadow wage rate of 0.75 was used for farm and\nunskilled labor. The relative contributions of taxes and tradable and nontradable goods and\nservices to the economic prices of composite goods were determined.\n17. The currently cultivated area is about 44,000 hectares (ha), and current yield using\nsimple production techniques and low-quality seeds is about 1.3 tons of paddy per ha. Using a\n1-ha rice production model, at the current input and output levels (adjusted to economic values),\nthe gross margin is $47.44 per ha. With increased road access, it is assumed that production\nwill increase for several reasons. First, with lower costs to reach the market due to improved\nroads, the net profit to farmers from increased production will increase. Farmers are expected to\nrespond to these price incentives. Second, improved road access will increase farmers\u2019 access\nto improved technology (including improved seeds) and extension services that currently have\ndifficulty reaching them. The public agricultural extension services in the project area are being\nsupported and expanded under the Agricultural Development Support to Seila project financed\nby IFAD, and the Second Cambodia-Australia Agricultural Extension Project. Further expansion\nof outreach in agricultural extension in Battambang Province is being proposed by the European\nUnion and the Government of Japan. With better road access, farmers will increasingly benefit\nfrom improved technology and information provided under these programs.\n18. Data from the IFAD Agricultural Development Support to Seila Project indicate that\nproduction per ha with improved technology and seeds can conservatively be expected to reach\n2.1 tons4 (Table A10.1), with a gross margin per ha of $74.46 (indicating an increase in gross\nmargin of $74.46 - $47.44 = $27.02 per ha). The analysis assumes that the amount of land\nfarmed using new technology will increase gradually, starting with 10 percent of land in year 3,\nand increasing by 10 percentage points each year until it reaches 80 percent in year 10.\nAdoption of the new technology is then assumed to increase more gradually, reaching 100\npercent of cultivated land in year 15. The analysis also assumes that 1,050 ha of land currently\nnot cultivated will be brought into cultivation as existing farmers expand their cultivated area in\nresponse to price incentives and as new settlers relocate into the project area.\nTable A10.1: Current and Potential Farm Gross Margins\n($)\nItem Without Project With Project\nOutput (tons) 1.30 2.10\nValue of output ($) 145.16 228.91\nValue of inputs ($) 97.73 154.45\nGross margin ($) 47.44 74.46\nIncrease in gross margin ($) 27.02\n19. The road rehabilitation component will benefit about 228,500 people in 263 villages in 31\ncommunes. They will be distributed between 10 communes in Battambang Province, 5 in\nBanteay Meanchey Province, 7 in Oddar Meanchey Province, and 9 in Siem Reap Province.\nThe Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct 206 km of road in Battambang, 142 km in Banteay\nMeanchey, 122 km in Oddar Meanchey, and 143 km in Siem Reap. The largest shares of the\nincrease in agricultural surplus will occur in the poorer provinces. In the case of Siem Reap,\n                  \n4   By comparison, in neighboring provinces of Thailand output is 6 tons/ha, and in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic output is 3.1 tons/ha.", "Appendix 10, page 6\n72\nwhich has a relatively high average per capita income (due largely to the development of the\ntourist industry), the expected output will occur in the most remote areas (in Siem Reap, all-year\nroads to the irrigated areas have already been built).\n2. Vehicle Operating Costs and Value of Time Saved\n20. Reductions in VOC and time traveled will be seen primarily in motorized vehicles.5\nFollowing improvement in road surface conditions, VOC savings can be manifested by direct\nreduction in carriers' costs as a result of lower levels of wear and tear on vehicles, and fuel\nsavings (which may be passed on to users in the form of fare and freight rate savings). Lower\ncharges and costs can also improve vehicle utilization rates and additional benefits can come\nfrom shorter journey times and shifts to less expensive modes of transport. The analysis was\ndone in two stages. First, reductions in VOC and travel time were calculated for existing motor\nvehicle traffic (nonincremental benefits); second, benefits were calculated for induced traffic\n(incremental benefits). Calculations were based on data collected during the project preparatory\nTA and by  ILO.6 Table A10.2 presents key data and the calculations of VOC and value of time\ntraveled without the Project. The base data was calculated from a representative survey that\nwas extrapolated to the project area. In calculating the value of time traveled, two adjustments\nwere made to the wage rate. First, a conversion factor of 0.75 was used to convert the daily\nwage of $1 to an economic value of $0.75. Second, because surveys have shown that people\ngenerally value their travel time at 25-45 percent of their wage, the value of travel time was\ntaken to be 30 percent of the shadow wage rate of $0.75, or $0.23.\nTable A10.2: VOC and Value of Time Traveled Without Project\nItem Motorbike Motor Car Pickup Koyun Truck\nTrailer\nVehicle trips/week 50,416 130 398 5,413 1,552        1,441\nAverage time/trip (min) 84 60 228 202 148 274\nAverage distance/trip (km) 21.10 9.92 56.90 50.45 12.35 68.43\nPassengers/vehicle/trip 3 2 9 12 14               5\nRoad use (weeks/year) 35 35 35 35 35 35\nTotal travel time/year (person-days) 837,725 1,301 56,115 915,918 226,422     138,060\nWage/day (economic cost, $) 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.75\nValue 1-day travel time (30% of 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.23          0.23\nwage, $)\nValue yearly travel time ($) 188,488 293 12,626 206,082 50,945       31,063\nVOC ($/km) 0.07 0.10 0.06 0.15 0.24 0.36\nVOC ($) 2,749,748 4,585 50,979 1,409,813 161,394 1,227,039\nkm = kilometers, Koyun = small-size tractor,  min = minutes, VOC = vehicle operating cost.\n21. Calculating the reduction in VOC due to improved roads is an imprecise science at best.\nHowever, some indications given by the World Bank 1994 study show that, for every $1 not\ninvested in road maintenance, VOC increases by $2 to $3. A study in Battambang showed that,\nwhen 10 km of road was rehabilitated, taxi fare for that 10-km route fell from $4.09 to $1.14. For\nthe purposes of this analysis, it was conservatively estimated that VOC will fall by 20 percent\n                  \n5    To avoid double counting of increases in APS due to reduced transport costs, the following analysis refers only to\npassenger costs.\n6   \u201cVehicle Operating Cost Study\u201d, ILO Upstream Project CMB/97/MO2/SID, presented in a seminar in Sisophon,\nAugust 2001.", "73\nAppendix 10, page 7\nper km traveled for each vehicle type.

Incremental usage and benefits are expected to occur as people currently using non-\nmotorized modes of transportation (e.g., bicycles, ox carts, and walking) switch to motorized\ntransport, and as existing users of motorized transport increase their usage. Calculation of\nincremental  benefits  was  based  on  the  foregoing  parameters  and  on  the  projections  of\nincreased usage of various modes of transport as follows:\nVehicle Type Increased Usage Projected (%)\n Motorbike 22%\n Motor trailer 17%\n Car 40%\n Pickup 28%\n Koyun 24%\n Truck 32%\nIt is also assumed that there is a linear demand curve for road travel, so the incremental users\nwill gain a net benefit equal, on average, to half that of the nonincremental users.\n3. Results\n23. The base case shows an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 19.79 percent. Table\nA10.4 presents the full analysis and the EIRR for the base case. Table A10.5 presents the\nresults of sensitivity analysis. The analysis shows that all costs would have to increase by 38\npercent, or benefits alone would have to be reduced by 28 percent, to reduce the EIRR to 12\npercent. Only in the two combination scenarios does the EIRR fall below 12 percent. In the case\nin which all benefits are reduced by 20 percent and all costs are increased by 20 percent, the\nEIRR falls marginally below 12 percent, to 10.26 percent. Clearly, the worst case scenario in the\nproject is if the funding for road maintenance does not materialize as programmed. If funding is", "74\nAppendix 10, page 8\nonly 50 percent of the planned, it is projected that benefits will fall substantially and reduce the\nEIRR to 7.17 percent.\nTable A10.4: Calculation of EIRR\u2014Base Case ($)\nCost Benefits\nYear  Road and  Travel Time  VOC  Agricultural  Net Benefits\nMicrofinance  Savings Savings Producers\nCosts Surplus\n2002 0 0 0 0 0\n2003 3,440,932 85,644 435,976 0 (2,962,911)\n2004 4,173,605 187,063 952,263 35,792 (3,093,712)\n2005 3,790,679 276,313 1,406,596 143,413 (2,105,016)\n2006 343,348 276,313 1,406,596 371,072 1,569,973\n2007 731,745 276,313 1,406,596 600,271 1,410,775\n2008 830,970 276,313 1,406,596 831,010 1,542,289\n2009 754,425 276,313 1,406,596 1,063,290 1,851,114\n2010 193,095 276,313 1,406,596 1,297,110 2,646,264\n2011 731,745 276,313 1,406,596 1,531,497 2,342,001\n2012 830,970 276,313 1,406,596 1,728,714 2,439,993\n2013 754,425 276,313 1,406,596 1,850,454 2,638,278\n2014 193,095 276,313 1,406,596 1,886,976 3,236,131\n2015 731,745 276,313 1,406,596 1,960,020 2,770,525\n2016 830,970 276,313 1,406,596 2,118,283 2,829,562\n2017 754,425 276,313 1,406,596 2,191,327 2,979,152\n2018 193,095 276,313 1,406,596 2,313,068 3,662,222\n2019 731,745 276,313 1,406,596 2,313,068 3,123,572\n2020 830,970 276,313 1,406,596 2,313,068 3,024,347\n2021 754,425 276,313 1,406,596 2,313,068 3,100,892\n EIRR          19.79%\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; VOC = vehicle operating cost.\nTable A10.5: Results of Economic and Sensitivity Analyses\nItem Change EIRR (%) Switching Value (%)\nBase case 0 19.79 -\nAgricultural producers surplus -20% 17.82 -68\nVOC and time savings -20% 16.37 -46\nAll benefits -20% 14.25 -28\nAll costs +20% 15.21 +38\nDelay in Benefits 2 years 12.67 -\nCombination 1:\nAll benefits -20 10.26 -\nAll costs +20\nCombination 2:\nFunding of maintenance costs -50% 7.17 -\nAll benefits years 2-5 -30%\nAll benefits years 6 onward -50%\n- = not applicable, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, VOC = vehicle operating cost.", "75\nAppendix 10, page 9\nD.
