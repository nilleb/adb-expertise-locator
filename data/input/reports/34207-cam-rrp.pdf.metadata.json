It is critically in need of post-conflict\nreconstruction.  What  limited  rural  infrastructure  exists  is  in  poor\ncondition  and  needs  rehabilitation.  The  Project  will  provide  rural\ninfrastructure  to  support  socioeconomic  development.  It  will  extend\nthe network of rural roads to improve access to isolated rural areas.\nOnce  year-round  access  has  been  secured,  the  Project  will  also\nfund other social infrastructure at district and village levels (schools,\nhealth facilities, markets, water supply and sanitation schemes, rice\ndrying  and  storage  facilities,  community  buildings,  etc.).  It  will  give\npriority to pro-poor public infrastructure investments identified by the\nthe  construction,\ninvolved \nbeneficiaries  who  will  be \nmaintenance, and operation of these civil works. It will enhance the\ncapacity of those associated with the planning, design, construction,\nmaintenance,  and  ongoing  monitoring  of \nthese\ninitiatives, from both the private and public sectors. The Project will\nhelp  the  vulnerable  groups  to  benefit  from  these  interventions  so\nthat  their  livelihood  conditions  and  income-generating  opportunities\nwill be enhanced.\n\nimpact \n\nthem \n\nfrom \n\nin \n\nClassification\n\nPrimary: Poverty intervention\nThematic: Human development\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment\n\nCategory B\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken.\n\nRationale\n\nAfter  nearly \nthree  decades  of  armed  conflict,  northwestern\nCambodia  is  now  in  transition  from  a  region  requiring  humanitarian\nrelief  and  emergency  interventions  to  one  requiring  investment  for\nsustainable long-term development. One legacy of war is a fractured\nsociety  that  is  progressively  resettling  into  formerly  occupied  and\nnew  areas  where  basic  infrastructure  is  limited.  The  incidence  of\npoverty, however defined, is higher in northwestern rural Cambodia\nthan  in  most  parts  of  the  country.  Even  though  the  region  is\nfrequently  mine  contaminated,  it  still  attracts  many  new  settlers\ninternal\n(internally  displaced  persons, \nmigrants,  and  formally  or  informally  demobilized  soldiers)  because\nof  its  abundant  land  resources.  A  necessary  prerequisite  to\naddressing the causes of poverty in rural Cambodia in general, and\nthe northwestern provinces in particular, is access. A functional road\nnetwork \nrural  economy  and  social\ndevelopment.  It  is  a  precondition  to  the  provision  of  socioeconomic\ndevelopment initiatives that will, in turn, provide the rural population\nwith  access  to  social  infrastructure,  markets,  income-generating\nopportunities, and social services.\n\nlifeblood  of \n\nrepatriated \n\nrefugees, \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nis \n\n\fiii\n\nObjective\nand Scope\n\nlivelihood \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nidentify,  prioritize,  plan, \n\nThe primary objective of the Project is to support the Government\u2019s\neffort  to  reduce  poverty  through  accelerated  rural  development  by\nimproving  socioeconomic\nestablishing  physical \nconditions,  and  enhancing \nin  northwestern\nrural \nCambodia.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  Project  will  (i)  plan,\nrehabilitate or establish, and maintain public rural infrastructure that\nwill contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of the rural\npopulation;  (ii)  strengthen \nthe  capacity  of  communities  and\nimplement,  coordinate,\ninstitutions \nto \nmonitor,  and  maintain  infrastructure  investments  and  development\ninitiatives;  and  (iii)  support  and  facilitate  access  to  appropriate\nsavings  and  credit  mechanisms  for  enhancing  livelihood  and\nincome-generating  activities  at  village  and  commune  levels.  The\nProject has three components: (i) rural infrastructure development\u2013\nroad  network  and  establishing  social\nextending \ninfrastructure at district level (schools, health facilities, and markets);\n(ii)  capacity  building\u2013enhancing  the  capacity  of  those  in  both  the\nprivate  and  public  sectors  associated  with  the  planning,  design,\nconstruction,  maintenance,  and  ongoing  monitoring  of  project\nactivities;  and  (iii)  rural  livelihood  enhancement\u2013involving  and\nempowering \nrural\ninfrastructure at village level (water supply and sanitation schemes,\nrice drying and storage facilities, community meeting halls, etc.), and\nestablishing  savings  and  credit  initiatives  at  village  and  community\nlevels.\n\nthe  beneficiaries,  establishing  small-scale \n\nrural \n\nthe \n\nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $34.73  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  $11.85  million  (34  percent)  in  foreign  exchange  and\napproximately  $22.78  million  equivalent  (66  percent)  in  local\ncurrency costs.\n\nSource\n\nGovernment\nAsian\nDevelopment\nBank\nBeneficiaries\n      Total\n\nForeign\nExchange\n-\n 11.80\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n7.40\n15.30\n\n       0.05\n11.85\n\n0.08\n22.78\n\nTotal Cost\n\n ($ million)\nPercent\n\n7.40\n27.20\n\n0.13\n34.73\n\n21.30\n78.30\n\n0.40\n100.00\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nThe loan will be the equivalent of $27.2 million in Special Drawing\nRights from the Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) Special Funds\nresources, with a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8\nyears,  and  an  interest  charge  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the\ngrace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 31 December 2007\n\n\fiv\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nThe Ministry of Rural Development\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nThe overall project implementation period is five years. The Project\nimplementation arrangements will conform with the decentralization\nand  deconcentration  policy  adopted  by  the  Government.  A  project\nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established in Sisophon, the capital\nof  Banteay  Meanchey  Province.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for\nday-to-day management of the Project. In the provincial department\nof  rural  development,  in  each  of  the  four  project  provinces,  a\nprovincial implementation unit (PIU) will be established and will be\nresponsible  for  day-to-day  management  of  project  activities  at  the\nprovincial level. The Project is multisectoral in nature; coordination\nwill be achieved through the respective provincial rural development\ncommittees already established in each target province. A team of\ninternational  and  domestic  consultants  will  support  both  the  PMU\nand PIUs.\n\nfor  rural  roads  and  other \n\n(LCB)  procedures  among  prequalified  private \n\nCivil  work  contracts \nlarge-scale\ninfrastructure  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive\nbidding \nlocal\ncontractors  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement\nand  other  government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  For  small-\nscale civil works of less than $10,000, procurement on the basis of\ncomparison  of  at  least  three  quotations  from  local  contractors  will\nbe followed. Vehicles, equipment, and material will be procured by\ninternational  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  more  than\n$500,000 equivalent, or by international shopping where the cost is\nfrom $100,000 to $500,000. Equipment or materials valued at less\nthan  $100,000  equivalent,  and  for  which  there  are  several  local\nsuppliers with satisfactory service facilities, may be procured under\nLCB  procedures,  or  by  comparing  at  least  three  quotations  from\nlocal suppliers, where the cost is less than $50,000.\n\nA  total  of  129  person-months  of  international  and  333  of  domestic\nconsulting inputs will be required to support project implementation\nand  capacity  building.  The  consultants  financed  by  ADB  will  be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for\nengaging  domestic  consultants.  The  Project  will  also  contract  out\nservices  to  prequalified  international  and  local  nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs)  and  other  local  institutions.  To  the  extent\npossible,  procurement  will  be  done  on  the  basis  of  competitive\nprocedures,  but  where  the  number  of  service  providers  is  limited,\ndirect negotiation may be applied, with the prior approval of ADB.\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\n30 June 2007\n\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries\n\nThe Project\u2019s target population is the rural poor in an estimated 400\nvillages  in  50  communes  of  14  districts  in  the  northwestern\nprovinces.  Approximately  105,000  households  comprising  about\n\n\fv\n\n560,000  people  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  Project  through\nincreased  participation  and  empowerment \nin  prioritizing  and\nimplementing  development  initiatives,  and  improved  access  to  (i)\nthe  rural  transportation  network,  (ii)  education  and  health  facilities\nand  services,  (iii)  clean  domestic  water  supply,  (iv)  village-level\nsocial  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  credit  and  savings  facilities  as  a\nprecursor \nto  enterprise  development.  A  wide  array  of\nnonquantifiable  benefits  will  also  result  from  the  Project,  such  as\nincomes,  better  social\nincreased  earning  opportunities  and \ncohesion  and  community  organization,  and  greater  access  to\nproductive  assets  and  markets.  Capacity  building  provided  by  the\nProject  at  government  and  agency  levels  will  impact  on  poverty\nthrough  improved  targeting  and  the  use  of  participatory,  needs-\nbased,  demand-led  planning  for  development  initiatives.  The\nProject will  have  further strategic impact on poverty as it will open\nthe way to further investment projects, particularly in agriculture and\nirrigation, that are expected to follow.\n\n\fvi\n\n\fI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\n\n1.\nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Northwestern Rural Development Project.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe proposed Northwestern Rural Development Project is included in the 2001 Country\nAssistance Plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Cambodia. In response to a request\nfrom the Government of Cambodia, ADB provided technical assistance (TA) to prepare a project\nto reduce poverty and enhance socioeconomic and livelihood conditions in selected rural areas\nof  the  northwestern  region  of  the  country.1  Four  target  provinces\u2013Battambang,  Banteay\nMeanchey,  Oddar  Meanchey,  and  Siem  Reap  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  (i)  the  high\nincidence  of  poverty;  (ii)  the  need  for  postconflict  reconstruction;  (iii)  the  large  number  of\ninternally  displaced  persons,  repatriated  refugees,  demobilized  soldiers,  and  other  vulnerable\ngroups;  (iv)  the  prospect  for  cross-sectoral  synergies  in  ADB\u2019s  country  program;  and  (v)  the\nopportunity  for  complementarity  with  activities  supported  by  other  aid  agencies.  Early\ndiscussions with central and provincial governments resulted in understanding that the Project\nwill  focus  on  14  districts  in  the  four  provinces.  The  project  design  was  based  on  a\nsocioeconomic data review, on the results of qualitative and quantitative surveys carried out in\ntargeted villages, and on the outcomes of intensive consultation with stakeholders, including the\nGovernment,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  other  aid  agencies.  A  series  of\nparticipatory workshops were also held in each project province and in Phnom Penh, to develop\nthe  project  framework  and  discuss  the  project  design  with  central  and  local  government\nrepresentatives,  external  aid  agencies,  NGOs,  and  other  stakeholders.  A  Loan  Fact-Finding\nMission  was  conducted  during  1-22  July  2001  and  an  Appraisal  Mission  during  22  August-8\nSeptember 2001. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nThe Project Area\n\n3.\nThe  project  area  comprises  two  contiguous  geographic  blocks  adjoining  the  Thai-\nCambodian  border  located  in  some  of  the  most  isolated  parts  of  northwestern  Cambodia.  It\nincludes  14  districts:  4  in  Battambang  (Rattanak  Mondol,  Moung  Roessei,  Samlot,  and  Koas\nKrolor),  4  in  Banteay  Meanchey  (Phnom  Srok,  Phreah  Net  Phreah,  Svay  Chek,  and  Thmar\nPuok), 3 in Oddar Meanchey (Chongkhal, Samraong, and Banteay Ampil), and 3 in Siem Reap\n(Angkor  Chum,  Varin,  and  Svay  Leur).  These  districts  are  broken  down  into  about  50\ncommunes,  which  are  further  broken  down  into  400  villages,  with  a  combined  population  of\n560,000  people  (105,000  households).  Altitude  ranges  from  10  meters  (m)  above  mean  sea\nlevel at Tonle Sap's edge to around 800 m along the Dangkret Escarpment in the north and in\nthe  foothills  of  the  Cardamom  Mountains  in  the  southwest.  Between  the  forested  hills  on  the\nborder  and  the  lowlands  adjoining  Tonle  Sap,  there  is  a  mixed  area  of  low,  undulating  hills\ninterspersed with broad flat valleys. Drainage lines run in a southeasterly direction toward Tonle\nSap  from  the  Thai  border  in  the  north  and  west.  The  high  and  seasonal  rainfall  (1,200-1,600\nmillimeters  per  annum),  flat  topography,  and  sparse  vegetation  cover  result  in  extreme  peak\nrunoff  flows  that  create  complex  hydrological  conditions.  What  little  forest  cover  remains  is\n\n1 TA 3489-CAM: Rural Development Project, for $600,000, approved on 29 August 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f2\n\nprimarily  secondary  regrowth,  as  the  region  has  been  subjected  to  considerable  degradation\nthrough timber concessions and illegal logging activities. Even so, forest areas still provide up to\n50  percent  of  household  incomes,  in  remote  areas.  Rainfed  agriculture  is  the  predominant\nsource of income based mainly on subsistence production. Large areas of existing and potential\nagricultural land are dotted with mines.\n\n4.\nRural settlements are found along watercourses or roadsides. One legacy of the armed\nconflict  that  persisted  in  the  area  for  nearly  three  decades  is  the  capacity  of  entire  villages  to\nrelocate in search of economic opportunities or to find areas where farmland is more abundant.\nAs a consequence, new settlements are common throughout the area.\n\n2.\n\nRural Poverty in Northwestern Cambodia\n\n5.\nPoverty  is  widespread  throughout  northwestern  Cambodia  and,  to  a  large  degree,  is\nrelated  to  extended  conflict  and  instability,  and  the  resultant  harm  to  the  population  and  their\nliving environment. Most of the country experienced peace and economic growth after 1993, but\nonly since 1998 have the northwestern provinces enjoyed their first real respite from war. Many\ninternally  displaced  persons,  repatriated  refugees,  internal  migrants,  and  formally  or  informally\ndemobilized  soldiers  are  busy  reestablishing  their  livelihood  systems  in  what  remains  a\nfractured society. They are trying to reinsert themselves into either established communities or\nrecently resettled villages. Social cohesion between the groups is low and community structure\nis weak.\n\n6.\nLivelihood  systems  are  not  secure  for  most  of  these  communities,  which  comprise\npredominantly subsistence farmers. An estimated 60 percent of households in rural areas suffer\nfrom food deficits. Some villages have access to areas of good forest and are able to forage and\nhunt, or collect timber and nontimber forest products for immediate household consumption or\nsale.  Others  are  able  to  supplement  food  crops  with  fish,  but,  in  general,  life  is  extremely\ndifficult. Food stocks begin running out for many families just four months after harvest. Coping\nmechanisms  for  villagers  without  access  to  good  forest  areas  are  even  more  tenuous  and\ndifficult.  Food  production  is  constrained  by  lack  of  water  for  dry  season  cropping,  lack  of\ninvestment  capital  for  better  technology  or  improvements,  while  livestock  are  prone  to  high\nmortality  due  to  widespread  disease  and  lack  of  a  viable  veterinary  system.  Government\nagencies rarely deliver extension services in the more remote villages for reasons of access and\nbudgetary  constraints.  Health  and  agriculture,  the  two  most  needed  services,  are  generally\nlimited to communes and villages in the vicinity of district centers. Access to savings and credit\nfacilities  is  severely  limited  in  the  communes  and  villages  as  the  formal  financial  system  does\nnot extend this far and the informal financial system (usually NGO-directed) is underdeveloped.\nSeveral  international  and  local  NGOs,  however,  have  been  successfully  implementing\nmicrofinance  projects  in  some  areas  of  northwestern  Cambodia.  For  example,  Catholic  Relief\nServices  is  reaching  over  31,000  clients  nationwide,  including  6,300  in  188  villages  in\nBattambang Province (the only northwest province in which it is currently working); Cooperative\nfor  Assistance  and  Relief  Everywhere  (CARE)  serves  about  4,000  clients  in  the  northwest;\nAction  Nord  Sud  reaches  about  10,000  clients;  and  World  Vision  reaches  17,000  clients\nnationwide, including 5,000 in the northwest. On a larger scale, Acleda Bank, which is still the\nonly  specialized  bank  to  be  licensed  by  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  as  a  microfinance\ninstitution,  reaches  over  60,000  clients  nationwide.  However,  it  does  not  take  savings,  and  its\nclientele  comes  exclusively  from  the  relatively  richer  provincial  and  district  centers.  NGOs  are\neager  to  extend  their  outreach  in  the  poor  northwest  provinces,  and  have  been  successful  in\nboth  mobilizing  savings  and  delivering  credit  with  high  repayment  rates,  but  limited  access  to\nvillages prevents an expansion of their activities.\n\n\f3\n\n7.\nAround 50 percent of villages have 40-60 percent of households living below the official\npoverty line.2 Household savings are normally held in the form of assets such as livestock and\nland, and, less often, gold and jewelry. These assets are often lost through forced sale due to\neconomic shock such as serious health problems in families. Average household incomes vary\nwidely, but the majority in the rural areas range from $300 to $700 per annum. With an average\nfamily size of just over five in rural households, this equates to an annual per capita income of\nbetween $60 and $140.\n\n8.\nLack of access to health facilities and drinking water are major issues related to poverty,\nespecially  in  isolated  rural  areas.  Most  villages  have  problems  with  either  insufficient  or  bad\nquality water, and often both. Some 6 percent of people obtain domestic water from boreholes,\n48 percent from dug wells, 38 percent from surface sources such as ponds and rivers; 2 percent\npurchase drinking water, and the other 6 percent obtain water from other sources such as roof\ncatchment. Only 8.5 percent of the population have access to safe drinking water, and these are\npredominantly  in  the  district  towns,  compared  with  the  national  average  of  29  percent.\nConditions are particularly difficult in the dry season when water from wells and surface water\nsources  is  frequently  contaminated  with  livestock  waste  and  other  foreign  matter.  Water  is\nusually not boiled before drinking, and there is little awareness of hygiene and sanitation. Only 4\npercent  of  households  have  latrines,  compared  with  14.5  percent  nationally.  Family  planning,\nreproductive  health,  and  infant  vaccination  services  are  all  lacking  in  the  remote  areas.  The\ngeographically dispersed nature of rural settlements and the condition of the road network force\nmany to travel more than six hours to reach health services.\n\nMany  rural  inhabitants  in  the  northwestern  provinces  receive  little  or  no  schooling  and\n9.\nthere  is  a  high  level  of  illiteracy,  particularly  among  women.  Official  statistics  report  an  adult\nliteracy rate of 46.2 percent (a figure considered to be inflated as it includes the partially literate)\ncompared with the national average of 63 percent. The school attendance of children aged 5-\n14  years  is  only  63  percent,  compared  with  the  national  average  of  67  percent.  Lack  of\neducation  has  an  immediate  impact  on  the  general  level  of  awareness  and  understanding.\nPeople are unable to recognize or take advantage of opportunities. They lack vocational choice\nand  are  unable  to  prepare  themselves  for  the  future.  Lack  of  education  and  literacy  has  also\ncontributed to low community capacity. In most villages, the community\u2019s capacity to participate\nin development has yet to be established.\n\n10.\nVulnerable groups throughout northwestern Cambodia include widows and other female\nheads of households, the physically and mentally handicapped, the orphaned, the landless, and\nthe aged without young to support them. There are also a considerable number of demobilized\nand  demobilizing  soldiers.  Poverty  does  not  distinguish  gender  but  households  headed  by\nwomen,  or  those  that  lack  male  labor,  are  disadvantaged  and  have  limited  opportunities\ncompared  with  poor  households  headed  by  men.  In  such  situations,  widows  not  only  have  to\nsatisfy all or most of the household\u2019s needs on their own account, but also care for their young\nchildren.  This  group  alone  represents  14.6  percent  of  total  households  in  rural  northwestern\nCambodia. Poverty in the target area is further described in Appendix 2.\n\n3.\n\nRural Infrastructure\n\n11.\nThe  long  period  of  conflict  and  insecurity  in  northwestern  Cambodia  has  resulted  in\nphysical  destruction,  total  lack  of  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  and  lack  of  exposure  to\n\n2  The per capita expenditure needed to secure an intake of 2,100 calories per day.\n\n                  \n\n\f4\n\ndevelopment  activities.  Rural  infrastructure  is  inadequate,  with  extremely  poor  transport  links,\ninsufficient  clean  water  supplies,  and  lack  of  public  facilities  and  services.  Schools,  health\nfacilities, markets, and agricultural facilities are often nonexistent or in complete disrepair. Many\npeople  are  isolated  due  to  the  difficulty  in  reaching  the  main  road  network,  particularly  in  the\nrainy season. The rural economy is fragmented into small localized units operating on the basis\nof a semisubsistence economy.\n\n12.\nThe poor road network hinders not only economic, but also social development because,\nwithout  roads,  social  services  such  as  schools,  health  care,  agricultural  extension  and  credit,\nare  not  accessible.  Most  national  (primary)  and  provincial  (secondary)  roads  throughout  the\nnorthwestern provinces are severely degraded. Those critical within the project area have been\naccorded  high  priority  for  rehabilitation  under  the  five-year  plan  2001-2005  of  the  Ministry  of\nPublic  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  and  the  ADB-financed  Emergency  Flood  Rehabilitation\nProject (EFRP).3 Others have already been rehabilitated with external assistance or have been\nupgraded by the army. A few short sections of rural (tertiary) roads have been rehabilitated or\nrepaired  under  aid-agency-funded  projects,  but  are  scattered  throughout  the  area.  The\nremainder of the rural road network is in disrepair and these roads are frequently impassable,\nespecially in the wet season. In addition, many of these rural roads pass through heavily mined\nareas that can also have unexploded ordnance (UXO).\n\nLack of clean domestic water is a major problem for most rural people of the northwest\n13.\nregion,  especially  in  the  dry  season.  Most  rely  on  shallow  dug  wells  or  nearby  rivers  for\nhousehold  water  and  many  have  to  travel  long  distances  to  the  closest  source  of  supply.\nSanitation facilities are scarce even in provincial and district centers, and are often inadequate\nwhere  they  do  exist.  This  contributes  to  the  problem  of  water  contamination.  In  the  course  of\nintensive  social  surveys  undertaken  during  project  preparation  and  confirmed  during  loan\nprocessing, rural inhabitants generally gave higher priority to the improvement of road access to\nexisting  district  health  centers  with  improved  staffing  and  a  better  drug  supply,  than  to  the\nconstruction  of  new  health  facilities.  However,  those  living  in  more  isolated  communities  give\npriority to construction of smaller-scale health facilities at the commune or village level.\n\n14.\nSchool attendance is low, and where schools exist, class sizes are frequently large\u201350\nchildren  per  class  or  more.  Often,  two  or  three  shifts  a  day  are  needed  due  to  the  limited\nnumber of classrooms. Schools are frequently dilapidated, old buildings or very simple wooden-\nframed, open-sided structures with thatch or corrugated iron roofs. In some places, classes are\nheld in private houses in the absence of other facilities.\n\n15.\nMost villages lack public buildings, such as village offices or community meeting rooms,\nbeyond,  perhaps,  a  dilapidated  classroom.  There  is  a  case  for  supporting  the  construction  of\nsmall community facilities. A multipurpose building can be used for village meetings and public\nawareness campaigns, as well as provide a venue where visiting medical teams can carry out\nprimary health care, mother and child health clinics, and vaccination campaigns. In many areas,\nrice  is  threshed  and  dried  on  makeshift  surfaces.  Farmers  can  be  helped  to  construct  simple\nconcrete  drying  slabs  as  an  alternative.  Footbridges  can  give  pedestrians  a  safer  means  for\ncrossing streams and rivers in the wet season in some villages. A simple structure, such as a\nbridge,  culvert  or  drift,  can  make  a  village  road  or  trail  passable  year-round.  Formal  markets\nexist in the districts but rarely in the communes or villages.\n\n3  Loan 1824-CAM(SF): Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project, for $55 million, approved on 21 December 2000.\n\n                  \n\n\f5\n\n4.\n\nSector Issues\n\n16.\nMaintenance of Rural Roads. The resources that the Government currently allocates to\nthe maintenance of rural roads are well below requirements. With an increasing number of such\nroads  being  rehabilitated  or  constructed  countrywide,  still  more  will  be  needed.  Where  road\nmaintenance  is  undertaken,  it  is  usually  dependent  on  aid  agencies  or  ad  hoc  payments  from\nthe central Government in response to individual requests. It is also unreasonable to expect that\nmaintenance can be achieved solely from local participation and the collection of user charges,\nwhich  were  attempted  in  isolated  cases  with  mixed  success.  There  is  a  need  for  greater\nallocation  of  a  recurrent  budget  and  for  the  establishment  of  an  institutionally  and  financially\nsustainable mechanism for maintaining of rural roads.\n\nRural  Road  Network  Planning.  Rural  roads  in  the  project  area  have  often  been\n17.\nrehabilitated on relief and humanitarian grounds, and the planning approach adopted has often\nbeen  piecemeal  or  ad  hoc  rather  than  attending  to  the  network,  using  a  more  strategic\napproach.  With  the  exception  of  the  Upstream  Project,4  all  other  projects5  supporting  the\nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD) in the rural road subsector have focused on rehabilitating\nalignments\u2013an appropriate objective\u2013but have not attended to institutionalizing a planning and\nprioritization process to rehabilitate and maintain the tertiary network. A strategic development\napproach should now be contemplated as the emergency relief period is concluding.\n\n18.\nInstitutional Capacities. Due to the limited number and capabilities of national human\nresources following decades of civil turmoil as well as a lack of motivation associated with low\ncivil  service  salaries,  the  Government  agencies  at  all  three  levels\u2013ministry  (national),\ndepartment (provincial), and offices (district)\u2013are weak in technical skills, project management,\nand  implementation  capacities.  Few  staff  have  technical  qualifications  above  secondary  level\nand  those  that  do  are  found  working  elsewhere  (most  public  servants  hold  two  jobs,  their\nattendance in their government position being proportional to the respective remuneration) or in\naid-agency-funded projects (agencies often encourage the secondment of their permanent staff\nto such projects in related fields of operation). The situation is made worse by the fact that the\nGovernment  has  committed  itself  to  an  ambitious  decentralization  program,  intended  to  give\ngreater  powers  to  provinces  and  lower  administrative  units  where  human  resources  require\nfurther  strengthening  and  capacity  building  if  they  are  to  assume  increased  responsibilities.\nExtensive  capacity  building  with  a  special  focus  on  technology  transfer  within  the  responsible\nagency for rural development will be provided under the Project together with operational funds\nand salary incentives to enable trained individuals to conduct field operations effectively.\n\n19.\nPrivate  Sector  Capacity.  The  capacity  of  the  private  sector  involved  in  the  rural\ninfrastructure  development  sector  (both  construction  contractors  and  consulting  engineers)  is\nalso  weak.  With  limited  funds  available  for  civil  work  programs  and  the  dominance  of  foreign\ncontractors  operating  in  the  country,  there  has  been  little  incentive  to  develop  the  expertise\namong private operators. The adoption of labor-based appropriate technologies (LBAT) requires\nadditional  training  in  labor  management  and  production  techniques  that  will  be  attended  to\nunder  the  Project  using  the  training  programs  developed  by  the  International  Labour\n\n                  \n\n4 The Swedish International Development Agency-funded and International Labour Organization (ILO)-implemented\nUpstream Project introduced the integrated rural accessibility planning (IRAP) tool in Siem Reap and has trained\nprovincial department or rural development staff in Banteay Meanchey Province.\n\n5  Loan  1385-CAM(SF):  Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project, for  $25.1  million,  approved  on  28  September\n1995.  Loan  1824-CAM(SF):  Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project.

Lack of secure tenure or land rights is a recognized source of\nvulnerability for the rural poor, and security of land tenure is one of the keys to sustained rural\npoverty  reduction.  Upgrading  the  rural  road  improves  accessibility  and  is  often  followed  by\nprivate investment in agriculture and a consequent increase in the value of surrounding land. In\nthe  northwestern  provinces,  a  rehabilitated  road  can  also  act  as  a  magnet  for  the  mobile\npopulation in search of economic opportunities. Given this pattern, there may be increased land\ndisputes due to market dynamism engendered by any rural development project, and the target\nbeneficiaries  may  be  alienated  if  they  are  not  provided  with  formal  documentation  certifying\nownership or right of occupancy.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n21.\nThe  Government's  overall  socioeconomic  development  strategy  is  to  achieve  broad-\nbased, sustainable growth with equity at a rate of 6-7 percent per year through fiscal reform and\nmaintenance of political stability; private sector development; agricultural development and off-\nfarm  income  generation;  and  improved  access  of  the  poor  to  natural  assets  (especially  land),\nhealth  and  education  services,  appropriate  technology,  and  credit.  The  focus  on  the  country's\nagriculture  sector  and  poverty  reduction  recognizes  the  dominant  position  the  sector  occupies\nfor  most  people's  livelihoods  and  the  high  incidence  of  poverty  within  this  sector.  The  draft\nSocio-Economic  Development  Plan  II  (SEDP  II,  2001-2005)  prepared  with  the  assistance  of\nADB is also directed at increasing investment in rural areas. The Government has also adopted\nan  Interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  that  gives  the  framework  for  public  sector\ninvestment,  including  increased  investment  in  rural  infrastructure.  That  strategy  seeks  to  (i)\npromote  decentralization  and  community  participation  in  project  identification,  design,  and\nimplementation  so  as  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  equity  of  rural  development  interventions;\n(ii)  improve  agricultural  productivity  through  greater  public  investment  in  rural  infrastructure  so\nas to enhance the incomes of the rural poor; and (iii) increase rural access to affordable social\nservices, particularly for women and vulnerable groups.\n\n1.\n\nRural Infrastructure\n\n22.\nIn December 1999, MRD issued a policy for rural roads that described the delegation of\nresponsibility  for  road  maintenance  to  the  provinces,  communes,  and  villages,  based  on  the\nprinciple  that  users  and  beneficiaries  pay.  MRD  indicated  its  role  in  this  policy  as  providing\nadvice  on  maintenance  and  mobilization  of  local  resources  to  fund  maintenance  programs.\nMRD encourages the establishment of rural road maintenance committees that collect tolls and\nlocal contributions from businesses and communities. This policy has been put into effect only in\na  few  local  cases6  and  reports  limited  success.  Subsequently,  the  ADB-funded  RIIP  proposed\nan  alternate  mechanism  for  funding  road  maintenance  through  the  establishment  of  a  district\nmaintenance  fund.  The  fund  has  been  established,  but  is  still  to  be  resourced.  The\nGovernment\u2019s  policy  for  rural  road  maintenance  retains  the  principle  of  user  pays  but  also\nrecognizes that this policy cannot be applied across the board as local resource mobilization will\nnot cover routine and periodic requirements.\n\n6  The  Action  Nord  Sud-funded  road  from  national  route  No.  6  northward  in  Chi  Kreng  District  of  Siem  Reap\n\n                  \n\nProvince.\n\n\f7\n\nIn recognition of the valuable contribution to local incomes, MRD also adopted the policy\n23.\nof  using  LBAT  for  rural  road  construction  in  accordance  with  the  Government's  policies  on\nemployment creation and poverty reduction, with emphasis on creating opportunities and, where\nappropriate,  giving  priority  to  disadvantaged  groups.  MRD  is  committed  to  developing  an\nefficient  private  sector  and  contracts  out  all  construction  work  to  private  contractors  that  have\nreceived training beforehand in LBAT. MRD retains the role to plan, design, and manage rural\ninfrastructure development.7\n\n2.\n\nDecentralization and Deconcentration\n\n24.\nThe Government is carrying out broad-ranging reforms to the state apparatus\u2013covering\nareas of public administration and finance, legal and judicial reform, reforms in the military, and\nsubnational  reforms,  notably,  commitments  to  decentralization  (the  election  of  commune\ncouncils in February 2002) and deconcentration (the delegation of central ministry functions to\nprovincial authorities). Under present deconcentrated arrangements, there is generally pre-audit\ncontrol  of  spending,  where  ministries  must  seek  the  approval  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and\nFinance  for  spending  requests.  This  has  helped  maintain  tight  control  of  social  spending,  but\noften leads to disruptive delays. As a result, three pilot deconcentrated expenditure systems are\nin use  in selected provinces and sectors: Accelerated District Development (in 27 districts, for\nsmall health expenditures), the Seila Program8 (in six provinces, including the four target ones),\nand  the  Priority  Action  Programs  (in  the  health  and  education  sectors).  A  forthcoming  organic\nlaw  is  expected  to  increase  the  powers  of  the  provincial  governors  to  coordinate  provincial\ndepartments  and  will  determine  which  line  ministry  powers  will  be  devolved  to  provincial\ndepartments.\n\n25.\nDevolution of certain powers to elected commune councils will begin next year, building\non the experiences of pilots such as the Seila Program. The Law on Commune Administrative\nManagement  empowers  a  National  Committee  to  Support  the  Commune  Councils  (NCSCC),\ncomprising representatives from six ministries and the Council of Ministers, presided over by the\nMinistry  of  Interior  and  supported  by  a  technical  secretariat.  The  NCSCC\u2019s  role  includes\noverseeing  the  completion  of  the  necessary  regulations,  and  coordinating  programs  for\nstrengthening local institutions (communes, districts, and provinces). The NCSCC will have five\nyears  to  promote  the  elected  commune  councils  as  primary  agents  of  local  development;\nemphasize the province governors\u2019 functions as main coordinators and promoters of provincial\ndevelopment;  and  determine  which  other  departments  at  provincial  level  have  which  roles  in\nsupporting \nthe  Seila  Program,  commune  development\ncommittees (CDCs), chaired by a commune chief and including representatives from all villages,\nare  responsible  for  developing  the  commune.  After  the  February  2002  elections,  commune\ncouncils  will  replace  the  CDCs.  The  commune  councils  will  have  4-8  elected  representatives\nwith  a  five-year  mandate.  It  is  expected  that  for  at  least  the  first  year,  planning  and  priority\nsetting  mechanisms  already  in  place  for  the  CDCs  will  be  carried  forward  by  the  commune\ncouncils,  including  the  local  planning  process,  commune  development  plans  and  commune\n\nthe  commune  councils.  Under \n\n                  \n\n7  Second Five Year Socio-Economic Development Plan of MRD, August 2000.\n8  Seila  (a  Khmer  word  meaning  foundation  stone)  originated  as  United  Nations  Development  Programme's\n(UNDP\u2019s)  Cambodian  Area  Rehabilitation  and  Regeneration  Project.  With  the  continued  support  of  UNDP  and\nother  aid  agencies,  Seila  has  evolved  into  a  national  program  operating  in  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,\nPursat, Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey, and Ratanakiri provinces under the coordination of a task force (chaired by\nthe senior minister of economy and finance and including representation from the main line ministries involved in\nrural  development)  at  national  level.  It  has  piloted  decentralized  systems  of  provincial  planning,  managing\nprovincial  funds,  coordinating  provincial  line  departments,  and  testing  a  model  for  executive  management  of\nprovincial development work.\n\n\f8\n\ninvestment  plans  and  budgets.  The  Project  will  actively  support  this  process  by  training  the\nincoming  commune  councilors,  and  progressively  involving  them  in  project  implementation\nactivities.  The  Project  will  also  remain \nimplementation\narrangements in view of the evolving process of decentralization.\n\nto  adjustments \n\nflexible \n\nits \n\nin \n\n26.\nMRD  already  supports  the  decentralization  process  by  establishing  and  supporting\nvillage  development  committees  and  provincial  rural  development  committees  (PRDCs).  The\nProject  will  also  support  this  process  by,  among  others,  the  use  of  PRDCs  to  approve\ninfrastructure investments. The project design also incorporates successfully tested features of\nthe Seila Program such as its bottom-up planning approach and the multisectoral coordination\nmechanism at provincial level.\n\n C.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n27.\nFrom 1992 to 2000, ADB provided Cambodia with 16 loans totaling $467.36 million and\n79 TA projects amounting to $56.9 million. Four loans totaling $91.1 million were in agriculture\nand  natural  resources,  two  of  them  specifically  targeting  rural  infrastructure  ($31.1  million)\nexcluding the loan funds allocated to rehabilitation of tertiary roads under the EFRP (footnote 3).\nSome  13  TAs  were  provided  in  the  agriculture  and  natural  resources  sector,  of  which  5  ($1.7\nmillion)  were  directed  at  rural  infrastructure.  The  ADB  country  lending  assistance  has  been\ndirected  equally  across  agriculture,  transport,  and  the  social  sectors,  with  approvals  of  about\n$100 million to each and a smaller allocation to energy ($30 million).\n\n28.\nThe ADB-funded RIIP is being implemented in six provinces in south Cambodia. It has\nfour  components:  (i)  rural  road  rehabilitation,  (ii)  market  development,  (iii)  critical  small  civil\nworks,  and  (iv)  capacity  building  for  MRD  and  its  provincial  departments.  The  project  is\nperforming  satisfactorily  and  has  generated  many  appropriate  designs,  standards,  and\nprocedures for incorporation in the Project. Assistance to rural infrastructure outside the project\narea  has  been  provided  under  the  Tertiary  Roads  Improvement  Project  (TRIP)  funded  by\nKreditanstalt  fur  Wiederaufbau  (German  Bank  for  Reconstruction).  A  summary  list  of  external\nassistance within the sector is in Appendix 3.\n\nRural  infrastructure  projects  implemented  in  the  target  provinces  gathered  momentum\n29.\nonly  with  the  establishment  of  peace  and  have  been  undertaken  in  response  to  different\nobjectives. The ADB-funded EFRP will rehabilitate both secondary and tertiary roads damaged\nby  the  2000  floods  in  three  of  the  target  provinces  adjacent  to  Tonle  Sap.  The  World  Food\nProgramme (WFP) has rehabilitated or established tertiary and subtertiary roads under its food-\nfor-work  program,  but  to  date  has  been  oriented  toward  providing  basic  access  for  the\nemergency  distribution  of  food  supplies.  That  program  is  currently  under  review  and  its\nextension9 will adopt a \u201cfood for development\u201d philosophy. WFP has also been responsible for\nrehabilitating  or  constructing  rural  infrastructure  including  roads,  schools,  health  facilities;  and\nfor other social support interventions such as basic health and education services, skills training,\nand  community  outreach  activities.  Support  has  also  been  provided  under  Upstream  Project\nfunded by the Swedish International Development Agency. Its main focus has been on capacity\nbuilding for provincial department of rural development (PDRD) staff and local contractors, and\nintroducing  the  integrated  rural  accessibility  planning  (IRAP)  tool  for  planning  and  prioritizing\ninfrastructure investments on a needs and accessibility basis. Pilot contracts using LBAT have\nalso been funded under that project.\n\n9  The Protracted Relief Recovery Operations Program.\n\n                  \n\n\f9\n\nThe  Seila  Program  has  four  key  areas  of  influence  in  the  target  provinces  including  (i)\n30.\npoverty reduction through the provision of rural infrastructure, (ii) institutional strengthening, (iii)\npiloting  a  possible  model  to  support  the  Government's  decentralization  and  deconcentration\npolicy, and (iv) the introduction of a needs-based, demand-driven, local planning process. The\nProgram  has  attracted  significant  aid  agency  (United  Nations  Development  Programme  and\nbilateral) funding, resulting in the investment of some $32 million in infrastructure in the target\nprovinces  since  1996.  Most  of  the  infrastructure  investments  funded  under  the  Program  are\nidentified through the local planning process (LPP)\u2013a commune-based, participatory, bottom-up\nprocess\u2013and  then  progressively  aggregated  (coordinated  at  district  facilitation  workshops)  into\nprovincial  strategic  development  and  investment  plans.  The  Program  provides  limited  funding\n(local  development  funds)  for  investments  identified  through  the  LPP  as  well  as  for  provincial\ninitiatives,  including  rural  roads,  health  centers,  schools,  water  supplies,  and  in  the  fields  of\nincome generation and natural resource management. The Program has developed a provincial\nimplementation  capability  under  the  PRDC,  including  an  executive  committee  (ExCom)\nresponsible for implementation. ExCom comprises a secretariat and associated local capacity-\nbuilding  unit,  monitoring  and  evaluation  unit,  contracts  administration  unit  and  finance  unit,  all\nfunded by aid agency contributions through the Seila Task Force. The ExCom is not responsible\nto any line ministry. Through substantial external technical assistance, the Program supports the\ncommittee and has improved the capacities, mobility, and resources of many provincially based\ngovernment  employees  that  have  been  seconded  to  staff  the  committee  on  a  contractual\n(including supplementary salaries) and competitive basis. None of ExCom appointments occupy\npublic servant positions even though they may be contracted  public servants. The identification\nand prioritization of rural road rehabilitation under the Seila Program is done through the LPP,\nwhich  lacks  the  larger  geographic  planning  vision  desirable  for  attending  to  the  road  network\nand often leads to a more piecemeal or ad hoc approach. The Program also favors mechanized\ntechniques for most of its road rehabilitation activities, and adopts technical specifications and\nconstruction  standards  that  do  not  conform  with  those  developed  by  MRD  and  are  seldom\nappropriate for situations where they have been applied, often with poor quality outcomes.\n\n31.\nOther  aid-agency-funded  rural  development  programs  in  northwestern  Cambodia  not\nspecifically  targeting  infrastructure  but  relating  to  poverty  reduction  (through  agricultural\nproductivity)  include  the  Agricultural  Development  Support  to  Seila,  funded  by  IFAD,  the\nCambodian Australian Agricultural Extension Project, funded by AusAID, and the Economic and\nSocial Relaunch of the Northern Provinces Project soon to be funded by the European Union.\nADB has a number of rural development initiatives in the pipeline covering this area, including a\nRural Water and Sanitation Project, a North West Cambodia Irrigation Sector Project, and a TA\nto  MRD  for  developing  a  rural  development  strategy\u2013all  included  in  the  2003  Country\nAssistance Plan. In addition, the Belgium bilateral agency is contemplating education and health\nsector  infrastructure  investments  in  Siem  Reap,  and  the  World  Bank  is  currently  designing  a\ncomplementary provincial and rural infrastructure project based primarily on secondary roads in\nSiem Reap and Oddar Meanchey among others, outside the project area. A number of NGOs\nhave also contributed to the construction, operation, and maintenance of rural infrastructure as\npart of their overall rural development activities, significantly improving access to social services\nin these more remote areas.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n32.\nThe  2000  ADB  Portfolio  Review  Mission  concluded  that  the  Government  has  been\nsuccessful  in  eliminating  many  systematic  issues  hampering  efficient  project  implementation.\nThere  remain  weaknesses  in  specific  areas,  most  of  them  related  to  (i)  the  acute  shortage  of\nskilled and experienced staff assigned to project implementation; and (ii) the lack of delegation\n\n\f10\n\nof  authority  within  line  ministries,  and  to  project  implementation  offices.  Both  technical  and\nproject  management  skills  are  found  wanting  in  most  development  projects,  and  capacity\nbuilding  remains  an  indispensable  project  component.  Adoption  of  decentralized  project\nimplementation arrangements facilitates delegation of authority. But such delegation, especially\nto  the  lowest  echelon,  needs  to  be  gradual  and  again  complemented  by  adequate  capacity\nbuilding to ensure sufficient absorptive capacity.\n\n33.\nGiven the enormity of the task of infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction in most\nrural areas of Cambodia, especially in the northwestern provinces, there is a need to prioritize\ninvestments so as to achieve the maximum impact from available investment funds. It is clear\nfrom rural infrastructure projects, particularly the Upstream Project implemented by ILO and the\nADB-funded  RIIP,  that  selecting  road  alignments  to  be  rehabilitated  is  an  important\nconsideration  in  maximizing  the  potential  benefit.  Prioritized  rural  roads  must  connect  with  the\nestablished provincial or district road network and provide development corridors to be followed\nby  other  infrastructure  and  socioeconomic  development  initiatives.  Planning  tools  utilized  in\nprioritizing investments need to involve the participation of beneficiaries, including the poor and\nvulnerable  groups,  to  have  the  desired  impact  on  poverty  and  to  contribute  to  their  sense  of\nownership. Villager participation in assigning priorities to investments at the commune or village\nlevel is desirable and is being practiced to a certain extent, notably the LPP. With their narrower\ngeographic  planning  vision,  villagers  cannot  relate  to  the  larger  framework  of  district,  and\nultimately,  province  that  is  necessary  in  prioritizing  rural  roads  where  strategic  considerations\nmust be given to the overall road network.\n\n34.\nVillager participation in decision making is still a new concept in rural Cambodia, as it is\nwith Government staff who facilitates participation. Villagers often believe that it is inappropriate\nnot  to  follow  majority  opinion.  What  is  referred  to  as  the  \u201cconsensus  strategy\u201d  is  an  important\nfeature  of  traditional  local  attitudes  and  villagers  tend  to  leave  decisions  to  higher  authorities.\nGovernment  staff's  understanding  of  real  participation  is  sometimes  lacking  and  they  often\nconfuse participatory processes with data-gathering exercises. As a result, priority investments\nmay not reflect the real priorities within the villages, particularly when considering the needs of\nthe poor. Finally, all project implementers recognize that the participatory process is necessary,\nbut costly and time-consuming.\n\n35.\nThe lessons learned regarding operation and maintenance (O&M) of rural infrastructure,\nespecially  rural  roads,  are  obvious,  but  the  solutions  are  less  clear.  Both  routine  and  periodic\nmaintenance are needed on all road alignments if they are to remain useful to the public. The\nestimated  life  of  a  rural  road  with  adequate  routine  maintenance  is  about  4-5  years  before  it\nrequires  periodic  maintenance  (grading  and  resurfacing).  Involving  communities  along  the\nroadside in routine maintenance has worked in some isolated cases where population densities\nare  high,  where  most  road  users  are  from  within  the  area  served  by  the  road,  and  where\ncontinued  community-organizing  efforts  are  provided  by  a  project  or  an  NGO.  Those  living\nalongside  rehabilitated  roads  view  maintenance  as  the  responsibility  of  the  Government  and\ncannot be convinced to assume responsibility, especially when a far wider community benefits.\nBeneficiaries often view the requirement of contribution in kind as forced provision of labor. Care\nmust  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  burden  of  maintenance  does  not  fall  unfairly  on  the  poorest\nmembers  of \nILO,  TRIP,  and  RIIP  projects,  maintenance\narrangements  involve  the  use  of  a  petty  contract  system  in  which  the  beneficiaries  who\nparticipated in the rehabilitation of the roads are trained and paid to maintained them. Materials,\ntools,  and  wages  are  provided  under  the  projects.  The  system  is  cost-effective  and  has\ndemonstrated  satisfactory  results.  However,  arrangements  for  sustainable  maintenance\nfinancing and a legal framework to support them still need to be developed.\n\nthe  community.  Under \n\nthe \n\n\f11\n\nThe  advantages  of  using  LBAT  in  rural  road  construction  are  well  documented,\n36.\nespecially  from  the  ILO,  TRIP,  and  RIIP  projects.  In  particular,  using  local  village  labor\nresources that are relatively underutilized in the dry season injects valuable cash to the village\neconomy  and  has  a  direct  impact  on  the  poverty  status  of  villages.  It  is  not  always  the  most\neffective  method  in  sparsely  populated  areas  where  the  supply  of  local  labor  is  limited.  Under\nthese  conditions,  it  is  found  more  appropriate  to  utilize  mechanized  road  construction\ntechniques  together  with  LBAT  around  village  settlements.  The  level  of  management  and\nsupervision  required  under  labor-based  techniques  is  greater  and  the  time  taken  to  complete\nconstruction is longer.\n\n37.\nThe incidence of inappropriately designed road structures is significant in rural areas of\nCambodia.  Many  road  structures  have  been  badly  located  and  designed  due  to  limited\nexperience  and  design  skills,  and  lack  of  consideration  of  local  hydrology.  Frequently,  such\ndesigns impose recurrent commitments that cannot be assured. MRD, with the support of ILO\nand  the  RIIP,  has  developed  appropriate  and  cost-effective  design,  specifications,  and\nconstruction  standards  for  rural  roads  and  structures.  Introducing  and  using  these  features  as\npart  of  improving  technical  capacities  within  the  responsible  provincial  agencies,  as  well  as\nwithin the private consulting sector, should be a priority consideration for the Government.\n\n38.\nIn  the  area  of  microfinance  and  small-scale  economic  activities  in  isolated  rural  areas,\nmore effective preliminary interventions in capacity building, such as community awareness and\nempowerment  in  preparation  for  longer  term  planning  and  introduction  of  a  savings  discipline,\nneed to be undertaken before starting microfinance and microenterprise development initiatives.\n\nFinally,  one  of  the  most  important  observations  from  projects  reviewed  is  that  project\n39.\ndesign should be realistic in scope and phasing. Some designs have expected too much in too\nshort  time.  For  this  reason,  there  should  be  regular  reviews  and  progress  reporting  so  that\ndesigns  may  be  modified  to  accommodate  local  capacities  and  conditions.  Time  must  be\nallocated to establishing management systems and procedures as well as gaining the support of\nlocal communities.\n\n E.\n\nADB's Sector Strategy\n\nin \n\nthrough  broad-based, \n\nADB's  strategy  as  outlined \n\nthe  country  operational  strategy  supports \n\n40.\nthe\nGovernment's  goal  of  poverty  reduction  as  a  means  of  reuniting  the  country  by  promoting  (i)\npro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth \nlabor-intensive  economic\ndevelopment  in  populous  rural  areas  where  90  percent  of  the  country's  poor  live;  (ii)  basic\nhuman  or  social  development  by  boosting  labor  productivity  while  improving  the  distribution\neffectiveness  of  economic  growth  and  improving  the  quality  of  life  indicators;  and  (iii)  private\nsector participation in development, addressing key institutional and infrastructure weaknesses\nthat  will  improve  the  geographic  balance  of  economic  growth  and  strengthen  the  linkages\nbetween the rural and  urban areas. Sectorally, ADB has also made a long-term commitment\u2013\ncontingent on Government action to implement necessary reforms\u2013to play a lead facilitatory role\nin the critical areas of water resource management, education, and transport.\n\n41.\nADB recognizes that the transport network is vital to the socioeconomic development of\nCambodia,  specifically,  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  rural  areas.  The  Government  and  aid\nagencies  agree  that  restoring  the  primary  road  network  needs  to  be  given  priority.  ADB  has\nfinanced the rehabilitation of national route no. 5 between Battambang and Sisophon10 and is\n\n10  Loan 1697-CAM(SF): Primary Road Restoration Project, for $68 million, approved on 21 September 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f12\n\ncontemplating  financing  the  upgrade  of  national  route  no.  6  from  Siem  Reap  westward  to  Poi\nPet11 on the Thai border, a critical road for the Project. Without this network in place, the country\nwill remain fragmented and rural roads will, at best, lead to small provincial towns, isolating the\npoor population and limiting the benefits of trade available to them. With RIIP, the Stung Chinit\nIrrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project,12 and this Project, ADB recognizes and supports the\nimportance of the rural roads linking rural areas to the primary and secondary network.\n\n42.\nConsistent with its commitment to broad-based economic development in the populous\nrural  areas,  ADB  will  also  support  production-oriented  initiatives  through  an  agriculture  sector\ndevelopment  project  and  a  north  west  irrigation  sector  project,  proposed  for  2003,  that  will\ncomplement  the  activities  undertaken  in  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  aid-agency-funded\nprojects  in  agriculture.  Through  an  integrated  natural  resources  sector  development  project,\nproposed  for  2002,  ADB  will  also  demonstrate  its  commitment  to  a  geographic  focus  in  the\ninundation  zone  of  Tonle  Sap  where  poverty  incident  is  high  and  community-based  integrated\nmanagement  systems  need  support.  This  synergy  between  ADB-funded  projects  in  the  area\nreinforces the impact compared with what might be achieved from a single investment.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n43.\nRural Road Maintenance. To support the maintenance of rural roads, there is a need to\nensure  a  reliable,  adequate,  and  sustainable  financing  mechanism  from  increased  recurrent\nbudgetary  allocations  from  the  Government.  At  provincial  level,  the  most  effective  means  of\nensuring  that  such  maintenance  is  performed  appears  to  be  through  the  allocation  of  central\nand provincial government funds to a maintenance account, which may also be complemented\nby user charges. The Project will support, on a pilot basis, the establishment of such an account\nat  the  provincial  level.  In  addition  to  maintenance  funds  financed  from  fuel  taxes,  the\nGovernment  is  examining  alternate  revenue-raising  activities  such  as  a  tax  on  vehicle\nregistration, neighborhood participation in maintenance works, and road tolls. With ADB support\nthrough the RIIP and the Transport Sector Strategy Study,13 the Government is in the process of\ndeveloping  and  establishing  the  institutionally  and  financially  sustainable  mechanism  required\nfor rural road maintenance throughout the country.\n\nRural  Road  Network  Planning.  MPWT  and  MRD  recently  agreed  that  planning  of\n44.\ntertiary and subtertiary roads is the responsibility of MRD although they recognize the need to\nliaise  closely  to  ensure  that  rural  roads  extend  from  the  existing  primary  and  secondary\nnetworks. It is well understood that the road network has a wider geographic impact than can be\naddressed  through  conventional,  grassroots,  participatory  planning  processes.  Only  recently\nwas  IRAP14  adopted  as  MRD's  preferred  planning  tool  to  address  the  network  integration\naspect. Staff within MRD and the PDRDs are still inexperienced with this planning tool and do\nnot have the resources to attend to this activity. The Project recognizes the need for a broader-\n\n                  \n11  Road Network Improvement II Project, proposed for 2003.\n12  Loan  1753-CAM(SF):  Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project,  for  $16  million,  approved  on  5\n\nSeptember 2000.\n\n13  TA 3651-CAM: Transport Sector Strategy, for $850,000, approved on 27 April 2001.\n14  IRAP is a local participatory planning process based on the concept that lack of access of rural people to goods\nand  services  is  the  fundamental  constraint  to  development  and  that  improving  access  is  a  major  tool  in  poverty\nreduction. IRAP as an integrated tool encompasses all the household\u2019s access needs and considers the full range\nof possible interventions to improve access depending on local conditions. The process has five main stages: (i)\nprimary data collection at village level, (ii) assessment of accessibility through data analysis and development of\nindicators,  (iii)  identification  and  prioritization  of  villages  for  possible  interventions,  (iv)  detailed  planning  and\nmapping exercise at the priority village level, and (v) costing and development of a local action plan and program.\n\n\f13\n\nplanning  framework  and  will  support  the  institutionalization  of  IRAP  within  the  Department  of\nRural Roads15 being established in MRD and PDRDs.\n\n45.\nDecentralization, Deconcentration, and Good Governance. These are central to the\nnational  public  administration  reform  process  currently  being  implemented  in  Cambodia.  They\nare also an essential component of the Government's poverty reduction strategy outlined in the\nSEDP  II  (2001-2005)  and  the  Interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper.  The  decentralization\nand  deconcentration  policy  has  an  impact  on  all  rural  development  initiatives  throughout  the\ncountry  that  require  improved  public  sector  financial  management  and  the  delegation  of  the\ndecision-making  process  to  the  provinces,  after  such  initiatives  are  identified  through\nparticipatory  processes.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  government  policy  in  that  it  draws\nheavily on participatory procedures in identifying, prioritizing, constructing, and managing rural\ninfrastructure  investments.  It  also  involves  provincial  and  communal  entities  in  prioritizing  and\napproving  investments  to  be  funded,  implementing  activities,  disbursements,  and  liquidating\nADB  loan  funds.  Furthermore,  the  project  design  incorporates  successfully  tested  features  of\npilot  decentralized  expenditures  systems  such  as  the  Seila  Program  or  the  Priority  Action\nPrograms (para. 24). While the Project incorporates project-specific good governance features,\nADB is actively addressing governance issues at sector and national levels through ongoing or\nplanned assistance.16\n\nLand  Tenure.  Lack  of  secure  land  tenure  or  land  user  rights  is  a  possible  source  of\n46.\nvulnerability  for  the  rural  poor  in  the  project  area,  especially  those  settled  alongside  the  rural\nroads  to  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project.  The  Government\u2019s  Land  Law,  prepared  with  ADB\nassistance, was promulgated in August 2001 and addresses many outstanding issues on land\npolicy.  Detailed  subdecrees  are  now  needed  to  implement  the  law,  and  ADB  is  assisting17  in\npreparing  the  necessary  ones.  Nevertheless,  the  law  already  includes  provisions  to  the  effect\nthat  persons  who  can  prove  peaceful  and  uncontested  possession  of  the  land  for  a  certain\nperiod  of  time  before  the  law  was  passed  can,  on  that  basis,  obtain  title  to  the  land  as  an\nexception  to  the  ordinary  rules  for  prescription  (which  would  require  a  much  longer  period  of\npossession).  The  Project  will  assist  beneficiaries  to  document  their  claims  to  uncontested\npossession (para. 61).\n\nPublic-Private  Sector  Partnership.  The  Government\u2019s  draft  SEDP  II  (2001-2005)\n47.\nrecognizes that enhancing private sector development is a key to sustainable economic growth\nand poverty reduction. The Project will support private-public sector partnership through project-\nspecific  initiatives  such  as  (i)  training  local  entrepreneurs  in  labor-based  technology,  (ii)\nestablishing a laboratory for materials and soil testing to be operated by the private sector, and\n(iii) upgrading public market infrastructure to be operated by private market committees.\n\n                  \n\n15  Subdecree No. 51 of 21 July 2001 amends Subdecree no. 78 of 1 December 1997 and establishes (Article 12) the\n\nRural Roads Department within MRD and describes its mandate (Article 17).\n\n16  TA  3634-CAM:  Strengthening Public Financial Management,  for  $1.2  million,  approved  on  22  February  2001.\nProposed  project  preparatory  TA  (PPTA)  for  2002:  Local  Governance  and  Decentralization,  to  be  followed  by  a\nloan in 2003. Proposed PPTA for 2003: Governance Action Plan. Proposed advisory TA for 2004: Strengthening\nDecentralized Public Financial Management; and several others.\n\n17  TA 3577-CAM: Implementation of Land Legislation, for $600,000, approved on 13 December 2000.\n\n\f14\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nNearly  three  decades  of  war  have  left  behind  a  fractured  society  that  is  progressively\n48.\nsettling back into previously occupied and new areas, where basic infrastructure is limited and\nwhat does exist is in poor condition and needs rehabilitation. The incidence of poverty, however\ndefined, is higher in northwestern rural Cambodia than in most parts of the country. The region,\nwith its abundant land resources (even though frequently contaminated by mines and UXO), still\nattracts many new settlers (internally displaced persons, repatriated refugees, internal migrants,\nand  formally  or  informally  demobilized  soldiers).  A  necessary  prerequisite  to  addressing  the\ncauses of poverty in rural Cambodia in general, and the northwestern provinces in particular, is\naccess. Access to an adequate and functional road network, the lifeblood of the rural economy\nand  social  development,  is  a  necessary  prerequisite  to  socioeconomic  development,  as  roads\nwill  give  the  rural  population  access  to  social  infrastructure,  markets,  income-generating\nopportunities, and social services.\n\n49.\nBeneficiary  participation  in  identifying,  planning,  implementing,  and  subsequently\nmaintaining this infrastructure is critical if full impact is to be achieved. Access must be provided\nin response to community-identified needs. In isolated communities, participation, especially by\npoor and vulnerable groups, has been minimal because they have been isolated from decision-\nmaking  processes.  This  reflects  their  recent  history  and  cultural  practices.  To  increase\nparticipation, community development directed at the poor and vulnerable groups is an integral\npart of the overall project design.\n\n50.\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  both  ADB's  and  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  poverty\nreduction and is seen as a major contribution to reducing the isolation of rural communities from\ndevelopment  opportunities.  The  Project  will  not  only  rehabilitate  the  vital  arteries  that  access\nrural  areas,  but  also  construct  or  rehabilitate  other  small-scale  village  infrastructure,  improve\naccess  to  microfinance  services,  and  provide  for  significant  capacity  building  for  the\nimplementing agencies and community groups. The Project is consistent with and supports the\nGovernment  initiative  of  decentralization  and  deconcentration,  which  will  in  turn  lead  to\nimproved governance, one of ADB's priority areas of concern in Cambodia. The Project will also\nassist  the  development  of  the  private  sector  in  rural  areas,  as  small-  and  medium-size\nenterprises  can  be  expected  to  flourish,  given  the  improved  market  access  made  possible  by\nthe Project.\n\n51.\nThe  Project  will  build  on  the  successful  and  tested  approach  adopted  by  previous\nassistance  for  rural  infrastructure  projects  supported  by  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies,  such  as\nILO and KfW. It will also complement and link with other planned projects to be financed by ADB\nand other aid agencies18 in the area.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe  overall  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  reduce\n52.\npoverty  through  accelerated  rural  development  by  establishing  physical  transport  and  social\n\n                  \n\n18  The  World  Bank-financed  Provincial  Rural  Infrastructure  Project  ,  planned  for  2002,  will  support  rehabilitation  of\nprovincial  and  district  roads.  The  European  Union-funded  Economic  and  Social  Relaunch  of  the  Northern\nProvinces (EcoSorn), planned for 2003, will focus on economic activities that generate food security, employment,\nand income for the poor (more specifically small-scale irrigation with human resource development and agricultural\nextension).\n\n\f15\n\nin\nimproving  socioeconomic  conditions,  and  enhancing  rural \ninfrastructure, \nnorthwestern Cambodia. The immediate objectives are to (i) plan, rehabilitate or establish, and\nmaintain  public  rural  infrastructure  that  will  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  targeted  rural\npopulation; (ii) strengthen the capacity of communities and institutions to identify, prioritize, plan,\nimplement,  coordinate,  monitor,  and  maintain  infrastructure  investments;  and  (iii)  support  and\nfacilitate access to appropriate savings and credit mechanisms for livelihood enhancement and\nincome-generating activities in the villages and communes (Appendix 1).\n\nlivelihoods \n\nThe Project has three components: (i) rural infrastructure development\u2013extend the rural\n53.\nroad  network  and  establish  social  infrastructure  in  the  districts  (e.g.,  schools,  health  facilities,\nand  markets);  (ii)  capacity  building\u2013enhance  the  capacity  of  both  private  and  public  sectors\nassociated  with  the  planning,  design,  construction,  maintenance,  and  ongoing  monitoring  of\nproject activities; and (iii) rural livelihood enhancement\u2013involve and empower the beneficiaries,\nestablish  small-scale  infrastructure  at  the  village  level  (e.g.,  water  supply  and  sanitation\nschemes,  rice  drying  and  storage  facilities,  community  buildings),  and  establish  savings  and\ncredit initiatives in the villages and communes.\n\n1.\n\nRural Infrastructure Development\n\n54.\nTwo  categories  of  rural  infrastructure  will  be  financed  under  the  Project.  The  first  is\ninfrastructure  with  a  provincial  or  district  impact  and  includes  rural  road  rehabilitation,  market\nfacilities, and larger public civil works such as health facilities and schools.  Infrastructure in the\nsecond category is smaller, with a more localized impact at the commune or village level, and is\npart of the rural livelihood enhancement component of the Project (para. 69).\n\n55.\nIdentification  and  Prioritization.  The  most  appropriate  method  for  identifying  and\nprioritizing the larger-scale rural infrastructure investments is IRAP, a participatory planning tool\napplied at the district level and adopted by MRD as its preferred planning approach. Since other\nrelevant  line  agencies  have  their  own  planning  procedures  and  standard  requirements  for\nschools19  and  health  facilities,  these  investments  will  be  eligible  for  funding  under  the  Project\nonly  if  they  are  also  confirmed  in  other  line  agency  development  plans  with  established\nbudgetary support for their staffing and operation.\n\n56.\nAlthough only three of the five districts of Oddar Meanchey Province are included in the\nproject area, a special case will be made for the provision of small bridges, culverts, and drifts to\nthe two other districts in view of (i) the current low level of development and substantial need for\npostconflict reconstruction, and (ii) the extremely poor road network and lack of access during\nthe wet season that hinders development efforts and leads to the depopulation of some areas.\nLimited  funds  will  be  made  available  to  Anlong  Veng  and  Trapaeng  Prasat  districts  for  the\nconstruction  of  road  structures  in  support  of,  and  complementary  to,  ongoing  development\ninitiatives.20\n\n57.\nScope of Rural Infrastructure. It is estimated that the Project will fund the rehabilitation\nof some 600 kilometers (km) of rural roads (tertiary roads) where economic, environmental, and\nsocial  justification  can  be  demonstrated.  These  tertiary  roads  are  low-cost  and  surfaced  with\nlocally  available  materials,  usually  laterite.  Other  rural  infrastructure  to  be  funded  includes\n\n                  \n\n19  The  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport  recently  adopted  a  priority  facilities  development  plan  that  will  be\nsupported  by  the  ADB-financed  Education  Sector  Development  Program,  planned  for  2001.  The  Project  will\ncomplement and coordinate with that Program.\n\n20  The WFP food-for-work road construction program, and UNICEF Community Action for Child Rights (CACR) and\n\nChildren in Need of Special Protection (CNSP) programs.\n\n\f16\n\nschools  (estimated  at  250  classrooms  including  the  rehabilitation  of  existing  premises),  health\nfacilities (estimated at one per project district), and market facilities (estimated at one per project\ndistrict).\n\nSurvey  and  Design  Considerations.  Rural  roads  will  be  constructed  using  the\n58.\nstandard  adopted  by  MRD  (adequate  compaction  over  a  carriageway  of  5  m  wide,  15\ncentimeters of laterite surfacing, side drainage, turfing of the side slopes, etc.). Markets will also\nbe  upgraded  or  constructed  to  standard  designs  developed  and  adopted  by  MRD.  Public\nfacilities  such  as  school  and  health  facilities  will  be  rehabilitated  or  constructed  to  existing\nstandard designs acceptable to the responsible line agency. Sufficient capacity exists, or can be\ndeveloped through training in the PDRDs and departments of public works and transport21 of the\nproject provinces to undertake the survey, design, and tender documentation of infrastructure to\nbe  financed  under  the  Project.  In  the  case  of  more  complex  rural  road  sections,  and  larger\nbridges  and  road  structures,  it  will  be  necessary  to  engage  domestic  consultants.  Little\nhydrological information exists on the project provinces; and roads, bridges, and culverts have\nfailed  due  to  the  use  of  poor  ad  hoc  designs  resulting  from  limited  understanding  of  local\nhydrology. A road engineer, qualified and experienced in hydrology, will be recruited to conduct\nhydrological  studies  and  apply  the  findings  to  the  design  of  roads,  especially  structures  to  be\nadopted under the Project.\n\nConstruction  Technology.  Given  the  poverty  reduction  focus  of  the  Project,  it  is\n59.\nexpected that at least 60 percent of the road rehabilitation or reconstruction work will be carried\nout  using  LBAT  to  ensure  that  the  surrounding  rural  population,  including  the  poor,  are  given\npriority  for  jobs.  Some  project  areas,  however,  are  sparsely  populated,  particularly  during  the\ndry season when some people either migrate temporarily in search of work or forage for food in\nthe  forest.  While  the  road  work  will  provide  an  alternative  source  of  employment  for  the\npopulation, the possibility of low labor supplies may be a constraint on LBAT, and equipment-\nbased construction methods will then be considered.\n\n60.\nDe-Mining  Activities.  The  high  incidence  of  mine  and  UXO  contamination  in  the\nnorthwestern provinces of Cambodia is one of the legacies of years of conflict. Sections of rural\nroads  to  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  will  require  de-mining  prior  to  survey,  design,  and\nconstruction.  Similarly,  sites,  pathways  to,  and  the  immediate  surroundings  of  social\ninfrastructure  to  be  constructed  in  the  communes  and  villages  and  other  public  areas  may  be\nmine contaminated and require clearance. De-mining of the rural road alignment to a width of 20\nm  on  each  side  of  the  road  centerline  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Government,  which  has\ndemonstrated capacity to do it. This activity will be financed under the counterpart contribution\nto the Project. De-mining before rehabilitating or constructing public or community buildings in\nthe  communes  and  villages  will  be  funded  by  the  Project  and  contracted  out  to  recognized\nhumanitarian de-mining organizations licensed to operate in Cambodia.\n\n61.\nLand  Tenure  Security.  Lack  of  secure  tenure  or  land  rights  is  a  recognized  source  of\nvulnerability for the rural poor in the project area. Improving and securing land tenure and rights\nis a key to sustained rural poverty reduction. To ensure positive outcomes for beneficiaries, the\nGovernment  will  support  beneficiaries  along  the  rehabilitated  road  alignments  in  obtaining\nownership  title  or  other  occupancy  rights  in  accordance  with  the  Land  Law.  Neither  land\nacquisition nor involuntary resettlement is expected in the context of infrastructure rehabilitation\nor construction, apart from a few isolated minor cases that will require the preparation of a short\n\n21  The  minister  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  has  agreed  that  provincial  engineers  can  be  seconded  to  PDRD  to\n\n                  \n\nassist with road surveys and design.\n\n\f17\n\nresettlement plan to be submitted to ADB for approval.\n\n2.\n\nCapacity Building\n\nThis  component  is  considered  essential  to  ensure  efficient  and  effective  project\n62.\nimplementation in view of the limited technical and managerial capacities and the limited budget\nat the provincial level. Three aspects of capacity building are proposed under the Project.\n\nThe  first  is  directed  at  technical  and  managerial  skills  of  PDRD  staff,  in  terms  of\n63.\nidentifying, planning, supervising construction, and monitoring and evaluating rural infrastructure\ninterventions, and in terms of preparing, implementing, and monitoring community development\nactivities.  The  Project  will  support  PDRDs  to  upgrade  rural  infrastructure  planning  and\nimplementation skills. This will include technical training in planning techniques, survey, design,\ncosting, management, and supervision of infrastructure construction. It will also include training\nin gender-sensitive community participatory approaches. The Project will also train PDRD staff\nin  the  use  of  established  standard  designs  and  specifications  for  rural  roads  and  associated\nstructures.\n\n64.\nAt commune and village levels, the Project will support the incoming commune councils\nin prioritizing, planning, and implementing small-scale village infrastructure. Through extensive\ninvolvement  in  participatory  screening  and  prioritizing  of  the  potential  village  infrastructure\ninvestments (para. 69) and in implementing them, the commune council members will be trained\nin leadership, participatory approaches, roles and responsibilities, and other skills as requested.\n\nThe second aspect is directed at improving the management skills of prequalified local\n65.\nNGOs and the private sector associated with the Project at the provincial level. It will give NGO\nstaff  specialized  training  in  the  areas  of  participatory  approaches,  roles  and  responsibilities,\nprocedures  for  screening  prioritized  investments,  and  other  community  development  topics.\nSkilled and experienced contractors in LBAT are still few. Training for small-scale contractors,\nsimilar to that conducted by ILO in the project provinces, will be continued and expanded under\nthe  Project,  particularly  in  Oddar  Meanchey  Province,  which  has  no  trained  contractors  at\npresent.  In  addition,  private  consulting  engineers  will  be  trained  in  supervising  infrastructure\nconstruction  and  in  quality  control.  The  Project  will  also  assist  establishing  a  materials  testing\nlaboratory by identifying and training local entrepreneurs capable of establishing and operating\nthe laboratory. As part of its commercial operation, the laboratory will perform soil and concrete\ntesting  required  by  the  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  in  their  construction  supervision\nactivities.  Roads  rehabilitation  contracts  issued  under  the  Project  will  provide  the  necessary\nsecurity to facilitate access to existing credit sources to fund the laboratory operation.\n\n66.\nThe  third  aspect  concerns  the  institutionalization  of  IRAP  planning  and  management\ncapabilities  within  MRD  and  its  provincial  departments.  The  Project  will  support  the\nestablishment of a mapping unit under the Rural Road Department established within MRD and\nsupport the operations of its offices in each of the PDRDs. The support will include training in\ncomputer  operations,  geographic  information  systems  (GIS),  IRAP  procedures,  and  data\nmanagement systems.\n\n3.\n\nRural Livelihood Enhancement\n\nThis  component  addresses  the  need  to  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  the  people  in  the\n67.\ntarget communities and assist them in strengthening social cohesion. Three subcomponents are\nproposed.\n\n\f18\n\nCommunity  Development.  This  subcomponent  will  promote  social  cohesion,\n68.\nstrengthen  capacities  in  the  community,  and  support  the  empowerment  of  common  interest\ngroups, with emphasis on the poor and disadvantaged so that they will feel confident to express\ntheir views and are not overlooked when priority development investments in the community are\ndetermined. The process will provide the participatory mechanism necessary to screen potential\nvillage infrastructure investments (para. 69) to be financed by the Project at the commune and\nvillage levels. The means of identifying and prioritizing these investments will be on a pro-poor\nand community demand-led basis, and will use as an entry point the commune investment plans\nprepared  through  the  LPP  introduced  by  the  Seila  Program.  The  list  of  priority  investments\ngenerated through this process will be screened using tailored participatory procedures that will\ninvolve  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  so  as  to  establish  a  revised  priority  list  of  investments\neligible for funding under the Project, complying with its pro-poor focus. This process will take\nplace in the villages in the impact area of a road alignment immediately after its rehabilitation,\nand the village infrastructure works will be constructed the following year.\n\n69.\nVillage Infrastructure Investments. Eligible items for small-scale village infrastructure\ninvestment include water supply and sanitation schemes, culverts, footbridges, rice drying pads\nand storage facilities, community meeting halls, and similar community facilities. The Project will\nfund  the  installation  of  some  170  village  wells  (hand-dug  ring  wells  and  mechanically  drilled\nboreholes)  and  60  ponds,  and  will  provide  for  the  construction  of  other  village  infrastructure\nbased  on  an  annual  allocation  to  participating  communes.  Standard  templates  for  a  range  of\nvillage  infrastructure  including  wells,  ponds,  latrines,  and  community  buildings  have  been\ndeveloped and are currently being applied by PDRDs.\n\nMicrofinance.  The  third  subcomponent  will  promote  a  savings  and  credit  discipline  at\n70.\nthe  village  level  and  will  prepare  and  facilitate  beneficiaries\u2019  access  to  the  formal  financial\nsystem that, at present, rarely extends beyond provincial or district towns or peri-urban areas.\nThe microfinance subcomponent will utilize the skills and experience of NGOs that have been\nsuccessfully implementing poverty-focused microfinance activities and supporting village-based\nmicrofinance groups for several years in northwest Cambodia. Several of these NGOs are in the\nprocess  of  transforming  themselves  into  formal  registered  and  regulated  microfinance\ninstitutions  (MFIs),  which  will  link  informal  and  semiformal  village-based  savings  and  credit\ngroups  to  the  formal  financial  system  in  the  future.22  The  Project  will  not  provide  a  separate\ncredit line, but will support NGO and MFI outreach activities to strengthen existing village-based\nmicrofinance groups and create new groups in the project area. Contingent on the strength and\ncapacity of the village groups to absorb external credit, they will then be free to pursue access\nto external loans through the NGO/MFI program or other programs of their choice. The Project\nwill take a flexible approach to the model of village-based microfinance groups used, as different\nNGOs are successfully implementing different models.23 Benefits will take the form of increased\nmobilization of local savings and access to credit, that can be used for productive investment or\nprovide  a  buffer  against  economic  shocks  (e.g.,  medical  emergencies),  or  both.  The  poor\u2019s\naccess  to  the  microfinance  activities  will  be  enhanced  through  the  poverty  focus  of  the\n\n                  \n\n22  Loan  1741-CAM(SF): Rural Credit and Saving Project,  for  $20  million,  approved  on  27  April  2000,  is  supporting\ndelivery of effective rural financial services through MFIs (and some key NGOs on an interim basis prior to their\ntransformation to MFI status) operating in most of the country. Close coordination will be sought with this ongoing\nproject to ensure complementarity.\n\n23  Among the models being used are a credit union approach, which currently is only mobilizing local savings without\nusing external credit lines, and a village bank approach, which both mobilizes local savings and makes loans from\nexternal  credit  lines.  However,  both  are  based  on  group  management  and  group  guarantees,  and  both  provide\ntraining  to  the  group  and  its  leaders  in  credit,  savings,  management,  bookkeeping,  etc.  Even  the  credit  union\nmodels have plans to begin accessing external loans to meet the great demand for credit. The main difference in\napproaches is therefore the timing of access to external loans.\n\n\f19\n\nNGO/MFI outreach methodology and the transparent nature of group decision making, as well\nas  the  use  of  group  guarantees  rather  than  physical  collateral.  The  Project  will  provide\nadditional  training  to  trainers  in  the  NGOs/MFIs  to  strengthen  outreach,  management,  and\naccess to external credit lines. Provincial and district staff of PDRD will also be encouraged to\nattend this training, and will receive additional training in microfinance to ensure their capacity to\nmonitor implementation of the NGO/MFI service contracts.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n71.\nThe project cost, inclusive of contingencies and taxes and duties, is estimated at $34.8\nmillion equivalent, consisting of a foreign exchange cost of $11.8 million (34 percent) and local\ncurrency  cost  of  $22.8  million  equivalent  (66  percent).  No  recurrent  costs,  other  than  the\nincremental  annual  operating  costs  of  management  support  and  infrastructure  maintenance  in\nthe initial years of implementation, will be financed under the Project (summary cost tables are\nin Appendix 4).\n\nComponent\n\nA.

ADB\nfinancing of the local currency cost is justified on the basis of the low level of national income\n($257 per capita estimated in 2000) and savings (11 percent of the national income in 2000) as\nwell as the Government's fiscal deficit (5.5 percent of gross domestic product). The balance of\n$7.5  million  will  be  financed  by  the  beneficiaries  and  the  Government.  The  ADB  loan  will  be\nfrom the Special Funds resources with a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years.\nThe  annual  service  charge  will  be  1.0  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent\nthereafter. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia.\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nAsian Development Bank\nGovernment\nBeneficiaries\n      Total\nNote:   Figures may not add up to totals due to rounding.\n\nForeign\nExchange\n11.80\n0.00\n0.05\n 11.85\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n15.30\n7.40\n0.08\n22.78\n\nTotal\nCost\n27.20\n7.40\n0.13\n34.73\n\nPercent\n78.30\n21.30\n0.40\n100.00\n\nE.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nMRD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  on  behalf  of  the  Government  as  this  is  the  ministry\n74.\nwith  a  mandate  for  rural  development  and  the  one  with  the  best  network  of  representation  in\nrural  areas  of  the  northwestern  provinces.  MRD  has  increased  its  technical  and  project\nmanagement skills considerably through practical experience in projects financed by ADB24 and\nothers.  It  has  also  demonstrated  satisfactory  performance  in  executing  these  projects,\nparticularly  in  complying  with  the  financial  covenants  for  the  timely  submission  of  audited\nreports, the release of counterpart funds and overall financial accountability.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n75.\nThe  Project  will  adopt  implementation  arrangements  that  conform  to  the  Government's\ndecentralization    and  deconcentration  policy,  utilizing  successfully  tested  aspects  of  the  pilot\nSeila  Program  currently  operating  in  the  target  provinces.  The  Project  differs  from  previous\nADB-funded projects that utilized centralized implementation units based in the national capital\nwith responsibility for provincial activities. A small project liaison office will be established within\nMRD  in  Phnom  Penh,  comprising  a  project  coordinator,  an  assistant  coordinator,  and  a\nsecretariat.  The  office  will  liaise  with  the  other  project  management  and  implementation  units\nestablished at the provincial level and will provide the necessary coordination with the Ministry\nof Economy and Finance (MEF) for the release of funds to all project imprest accounts.\n\n76.\nA PMU to be established in Sisophon, the capital of Banteay Meanchey Province, will be\nresponsible  for  day-to-day  management  of  the  Project  and  will  accommodate  the  technical\nspecialists  recruited  in  support  of  project  activities.  The  PMU  will  be  staffed  with  (i)  a  project\n\n                  \n\n24 Loan  1385-CAM(SF):Rural  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  (footnote  5).  Loan  1824-CAM(SF):  Emergency\nFlood Rehabilitation Project (footnote 3). Loan 1753-CAM: Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project\n(footnote 12).\n\n\f21\n\ndirector; (ii) four staff covering administration, procurement, and accounting; and (iii) a sufficient\nnumber  of  support  staff.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  by  four  international  specialists\n(assistant  project  manager,  hydrologist,  engineer/trainer,  and  community  development\nspecialist)  plus  three  project  technical  staff  (training  coordination,  monitoring  and  evaluation,\nand information systems). The PMU will be responsible for (i) project-wide management issues\nsuch  as  coordinating  training,  negotiating  service  contracts,  providing  consulting  services,\nmonitoring and evaluation, and preparing annual work plans and budgets; (ii) coordinating and\ngiving  technical  and  management  support  to  PIUs  established  in  the  provinces;  (iii)  managing\nthe project imprest account and reporting the liquidation of funds through this account to MEF\nvia  the  Executing  Agency;  and  (iv)  replenishing  funds  to  the  second-generation  imprest\naccounts managed in the provinces.\n\nA PIU will be established within PDRD in each of the four project provinces and will be\n77.\nresponsible  for  day-to-day  management  of  project  activities  at  the  provincial  level  including  (i)\npreparing  and  supervising  contracts  for  civil  works,  (ii)  preparing  provincial  work  plans  and\nbudgets,  and  (iii)  reporting  progress  of  the  various  components  under  its  management.  Each\nPIU  will  be  staffed  by  six  government  employees,  four  (manager,  engineer,  technician,  and\nfinancial  administrator)  already  appointed  under  the  Working  Group  established  to  implement\nthe  ADB-funded  EFRP  (footnote  3),  plus  two  incremental  staff  (contract  manager  and  one\nadministrative  assistant)  to  be  assigned  from  PDRD.  Being  based  in  PDRD,  the  PIU  will  also\nhave  access  to  in-house  expertise  and  technical  specialists  from  other  sections  on  an  as-\nrequired basis. The PIU will (i) accommodate the local community development specialist and\nlocal infrastructure engineer assigned to each province to support project initiatives, and (ii) be\nresponsible  for  managing  the  second-generation  imprest  account  and  reporting  liquidation  of\nfunds through this account to the PMU.\n\n78.\n The fact that the Project will fund schools, health facilities, and other small-scale village\ninfrastructure  highlights  its  multisectoral  nature  and  the  need  for  coordination  between\ngovernment  agencies  with  responsibility  for  those  sectors.  Coordination  is  required  to  ensure\nnot  only  consistency  with  the  respective  development  plans  but  also  allocation  of  funds  for\nongoing operation and maintenance. Coordination will also be required with other projects being\nimplemented in the provinces and other independent NGO activities. The PRDC chaired by the\nprovincial governor and with representation from all provincial line agencies (Appendix 5), has\nresponsibility for coordinating these programs through the formulation of the provincial strategic\ndevelopment  plan  and  the  provincial  investment  plan.  As  such,  PRDC  is  ideally  placed  to\nachieve  the  necessary  coordination  with  other  program  activities.  Project  coordination  will\ntherefore  be  achieved  through  the  respective  PRDCs  in  the  target  provinces.  All  qualifying\ninvestments  (screened  and  confirmed  as  pro-poor,  financially  viable,  sustainable  in  the  long\nterm,  and  environmentally  sustainable  by  the  PIU)  will  be  referred  by  the  PIU  to  PRDC  for\nfunding  approval.  Approval  will  be  granted  for  project  financing  only  if  the  recommended\ninvestment  is  proposed  as  high  priority  in  terms  of  its  potential  impact  on  the  poor  and\nvulnerable  groups,  its  viability,  its  sustainability,  and  consistency  with  sector  plans.  Project\nmanagement and implementation structures are presented in diagrams in Appendix 5.\n\nA  strategic  approach  that  will  be  adopted  during  project  implementation  will  dictate  the\n79.\nrate at which initiatives can be introduced to rural villages. The Project will progressively extend\naccess  by  rehabilitating  the  tertiary  road  network  starting  from  the  provincial  or  secondary\nnetwork  and  extending  it  to  the  isolated  rural  areas  of  the  Project.  As  year-round  access  is\nsecured, community development activities, including establishment of small-scale community-\nbased  infrastructure,  will  be  initiated  in  communes  and  villages  in  the  impact  area  of  the  road\n(referred to as \u201cintensive villages\u201d). Similarly, larger-scale investments other than roads will be\n\n\f22\n\nundertaken  only  after  roads  have  been  rehabilitated  so  that  the  responsible  departments  and\nbeneficiaries can use the structures established under the Project.\n\n1.\n\nProject Component\n\na.\n\nRural Infrastructure Development\n\n80.\nPIUs will be responsible for implementing this component, which involves civil works for\nrehabilitating  or  constructing  rural  roads,  markets,  schools,  and  health  facilities.  The  full-time\nlocal  infrastructure  engineer  in  each  PIU  and  the  international  infrastructure  engineer  and  the\nhydrologist based in the PMU will give support in technical aspects and in managing contracts.\nAfter investments have been identified and prioritized for funding using IRAP and confirmed as\npriority  investments  by  PRDC,  the  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  the  survey  and  design  of  civil\nworks  and  the  preparation  of  bid  documents,  including  specifications  and  all  necessary\ndocumentation. The PIUs will invite tenders from an approved list of prequalified contractors for\nconstruction  of  civil  works  under  local  competitive  bidding.  Supervision  and  quality  control  of\nconstruction  works  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  assisted  by  the  PDRD,  or  will  be\nsubcontracted  to  consulting  engineers  as  part  of  the  construction  costs  and  following\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Labor inspectors will monitor labor-based contracts.\n\nThe Project will support the issuance of land titles and occupancy rights through suitable\n81.\narrangements  with  the  Ministry  of  Land  Management,  Urban  Planning,  and  Construction25  to\nprotect  the  interests  of  project  beneficiaries  occupying  house  and  agricultural  plots  along  the\nrehabilitated  road  alignments.  Land  titles  will  be  issued  in  accordance  with  procedures\nestablished  under  the  Land  Law  promulgated  in  August  2001.  Currently,  about  70  percent  of\nland titles issued to married couples are registered in the name of both husband and wife. The\nProject will ensure that this practice continues in the project area.\n\nAny market upgrading will be subject to prior ADB approval of an economic and social\n82.\nfeasibility  study  (including  a  short  resettlement  plan  if  needed)  according  to  established\nguidelines  (Appendix  6).  Before  any  construction  or  upgrading  activities  are  implemented,  a\ncommittee  for  the  market  concerned  will  be  established,  and  market  user  fees  will  be  agreed\nupon between MRD and the market committee.\n\nb.\n\nCapacity Building\n\nThree  categories  of  capacity  building  have  been  identified  under  the  Project:  (i)\n83.\ngovernment  agency  capacities,  (ii)  private  sector  and  NGO  capacities,  and  (iii)  planning\ncapacities in MRD and PDRDs (institutionalization of IRAP).\n\nCapacity  building  in  the  technical  areas,  including  infrastructure  design  and  hydrology,\n84.\nwill be delivered by the international and domestic specialists funded by the Project and will be\ncoordinated  by  the  PMU  and  PIUs.  Agency  staff  will  also  receive  extensive  training  in  (i)  their\napproaches to communities; (ii) project planning, supervision, and monitoring; (iii) environmental\nassessments; and (iv) other topics as appropriate. This training will be complemented with on-\nthe-job  training  alongside  NGOs  that  are  more  familiar  with  participatory  approaches  in\n\n                  \n\n25  The  Ministry  of  Land  Management,  Urban  Planning,  and  Construction  is  assisted  in  executing  its  mandate  to\nimplement  the  new  Land  Law  (August  2001)  and  to  issue  land  titles  by  ADB:  TA  3577-CAM:  Implementation of\nLand Legislation for $600,000, approved on 13 December 2000; and an incoming project to be funded jointly by\nWorld Bank, GTZ  and the Government of Finland to support land management,  cadastral survey and land titling\nactivities.\n\n\f23\n\ncommunities.  Most  training-of-trainers  activities  will  be  coordinated  by  the  PMU  through  the\ntraining  coordinator,  whereas  lower-level  training  activities  will  be  coordinated  by  PIUs  and\nNGOs, as appropriate.\n\nCapacity  building  directed  at  the  private  sector  and  local  NGOs  will  be  coordinated  by\n85.\nthe  PMU.  Training  for  the  private  sector  will  be  directed  toward  construction  contractors,  the\nfledgling consulting engineering industry, and the materials testing laboratory to be supported by\nthe  Project.  Such  training  will  be  implemented  under  contractual  arrangements  by  competent\ninstitutions or consulting services provided under the Project.\n\n86.\nCapacity  building,  especially  in  IRAP  planning  procedures  and  techniques,  will  be\nprovided  for  the  Department  of  Rural  Roads  recently  established  in  MRD  and  its  provincial\ndepartments. It will be achieved through a combination of formal training courses available from\ncommercial trainers and from on-the-job training obtained under a contractual arrangement with\na suitably qualified organization such as ILO with experience in this technical area.\n\nc.\n\nRural Livelihood Enhancement\n\n87.\nNGOs  will  implement  community  development  initiatives.  Prequalified  NGOs  will  be\ncontracted by the PMU to provide an agreed-upon range of services to achieve the identification\nof  priority  investments  and  support  community  development  activities.  Such  expertise  exists\nwithin international and domestic NGOs currently operating in Cambodia, some of which have\nexpressed  interest  in  cooperation.26  This  component  will  be  supported  and  coordinated  by  an\ninternational  community  development  specialist  (based  in  the  PMU)  and  four  local  provincial\ndevelopment officers, one attached to each PIU.\n\nAfter \n\nthe  commune  councils  have \n\nidentified  and  prioritized  small-scale \n\n88.\nrural\ninfrastructure investments at commune and village levels through participatory screening of the\ncommune  investment  plans,  the  PIU  will  involve  the  councils  and  the  local  community-based\norganizations in implementation to further develop their capacity. Ultimately, these local bodies\nwill  be  responsible  for  contracting  out  any  construction  works  to  small  local  contractors  or\npieceworkers from the province on a negotiated basis. The beneficiary commune development\ncommittee, in cooperation with the PIU, will monitor construction and certify completion of small-\nscale works, which will form part of the certification for payment to contractors.\n\n89.\nThe microfinance subcomponent will be phased in intensive villages as the road network\nis progressively upgraded and access is improved. It will be implemented in the target districts\nin  accordance  with  the  strategic  approach  adopted  for  infrastructure  development  as  the  road\nnetwork  is  expanded.  The  PMU  will  contract  out  savings  and  credit  activities  in  participating\nvillages  to  prequalified  NGOs  and  MFIs  with  the  appropriate  skills  and  experience  in\nmicrofinance.  Each  PIU  will  assume  a  coordination,  support,  and  monitoring  role.  The\nNGOs/MFIs  will  be  assisted  through  a  short-term  savings  and  credit  specialist  who  will  help\nwith initial program design, technical input, and training for NGO/MFI staff as required. The PMU\nwill  be  responsible  for  managing  NGO/MFI  service  contracts,  and  PIUs  will  have  a  supporting\nrole  in  contract  administration  and  reporting  of  the  NGO/MFI  activities  in  their  respective\nprovinces.\n\n                  \n\n26 CARE  International,  ZOA  Refugee  Care,  Norwegian  People\u2019s  Aid  (NPA),  Catholic  Relief  Services  (CRS),\n\nAustralian Volunteers International, and several domestic NGOs active in the project area.\n\n\f24\n\n2.\n\nProject Implementation Schedule\n\n90.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years.  In  the  first  two  years,  essential\ninfrastructure (PMU, PIUs, and PDRD premises in Oddar Meanchey) will be constructed; project\nmanagement  structures,  procedures,  and  arrangements  will  be  developed;  and  capacity\nbuilding (IRAP planning, orientation, and other incremental technical training of agency staff and\ncontracted  NGOs)  will  be  initiated.  Initial  identification  and  planning  of  larger-scale  rural\ninfrastructure  will  be  undertaken  so  that  rehabilitation  of  rural  roads  can  commence  in  the  dry\nseason  of  the  second  year  of  implementation.  This  relatively  long  period  of  preparation  is\nnecessary  to  allow  (i)  significant  capacity  building  to  ensure  sound  implementation,  (ii)\nidentification of priority road alignments for rehabilitation, (iii) issuance of land titles or certificate\nof occupancy for holdings within the zones adjoining the roads to be rehabilitated, and (iv) de-\nmining  of  prioritized  alignments.  Within  each  project  district,  intensive  activities  such  as\nscreening  of  investment  plans  and  village  microfinance  activities  will  be  initiated  as  the  road\nnetwork is progressively rehabilitated. These intensive activities are estimated to start in 9, 15,\nand 15 communes in years two, three, and four, respectively. This is equivalent to 40, 68, and\n66  incremental  villages  in  each  year  when  intensive  activities  will  be  initiated.  The\nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\n91.\nGoods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured\nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will\nbe  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than\n$500,000  equivalent,  or  by  international  shopping  where  the  cost  is  valued  from  $100,000  to\n$500,000. Where there are several local suppliers with satisfactory service facilities, equipment\nor materials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured under local competitive\nbidding  (LCB)  procedures,  or  on  the  basis  of  a  comparison  of  at  least  three  quotations  from\nlocal  suppliers,  where  the  cost  is  less  than  $50,000.  Final  details  regarding  packages  for\nprocurement will be determined during project implementation (a tentative procurement package\nis in Appendix 8).\n\nThe civil works to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan, including all eligible\n92.\nitems identified through the Project's screening procedures, will be procured in accordance with\nLCB  procedures  among  prequalified  private  local  contractors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Given  the\nsmall  and  scattered  nature  of  the  civil  works,  individual  contracts  are  unlikely  to  attract\ninternational  bidders.  Domestic  contractors  have  the  capacity  and  capability  to  undertake  the\nrequired contracts. For contracts to be undertaken using LBAT, contractors will be prequalified\nby the PIUs, provided that the contractors attend a training workshop at project commencement\nand  comply  with  required  performance  and \nfinancial  criteria.  Each  PIU  will  update\nprequalification  annually,  based  on  contractor  performance  and  the  reports  of  the  labor\ninspectors  engaged  under  the  Project.  Domestic  contractors  for  mechanized  civil  works\ncontracts  will  be  prequalified  by  the  PMU  in  consultation  with  PIUs,  using  government\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Small-scale  civil  works  valued  at  less  than  $10,000  may  be\nprocured after comparing at least three quotations from local contractors.\n\n93.\nAs project initiatives will be approved at the provincial level and implementation will be\ncarried out by PIUs, national steering and/or coordination committees will not be established, as\nthey  would  only  add  to  the  management  difficulties  and  introduce  potential  delays  in\ndisbursement. With PRDCs being chaired by provincial governors, who have the power to direct\ndepartment directors, the necessary authority exists to achieve inter-sector coordination.\n\n\f25\n\n4.\n\nConsulting and NGO Services\n\n94.\nFor  successful  implementation  of  the  Project,  consulting  services  are  required  in  the\nareas  of  project  management,  civil  works  design,  hydrology,  regional  planning,  IRAP  and\naccessibility  mapping,  community  development,  microfinance,  and  environmental  assessment.\nThe  relatively  high  input  of  consulting  services  identified  under  the  Project  is  considered\nnecessary in view of the low level of human resource capacity and technical expertise available\nin  the  Government  at  both  central  and  provincial  levels,  the  limited  domestic  specialist\nimportance  of  ensuring  comprehensive  participatory  planning  and\nresources,  and \nimplementation in project activities. Specialist inputs will be needed to introduce new technology\nthrough the Project and will also be used extensively to conduct much of the training outlined in\nthe capacity-building component.\n\nthe \n\n95.\nThe  Project  will  provide  about  333  person-months  of  specialized  services  of  domestic\nconsultants and about 129 person-months of international consultants in both long- and short-\nterm appointments through consulting firms (summary consulting services and packaging are in\nAppendix  9).  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging\ndomestic  consultants.  For  consulting  services  related  to  IRAP  activities,  a  contract  may  be\nnegotiated  directly  with  ILO,  which  has  the  experience  in  this  technical  area  and  has  been\nproviding it in the context of a similar project in Cambodia for the last three years. The Project\nwill also engage local institutions for technical training through competitive bidding according to\nADB  procedures.  Where  the  number  of  suitably  qualified  institutions  is  limited,  direct\nnegotiations may be applied with prior approval of ADB.\n\n96.\nThe  services  of  international  and  domestic  NGOs  are  required  in  screening  priority\ninvestments,  community  empowerment  and  development  activities,  and  establishing  village-\nbased savings and credit schemes. To the extent possible, prequalified NGOs will be contracted\non  the  basis  of  competitive  procedures.  Where  the  number  of  prequalified  NGOs  is  limited,\ndirect negotiations may be applied, with prior approval of ADB.\n\n5.\n\nAdvance Action\n\n97.\nADB  has  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance  action  in  recruiting\nconsultants and preparing for construction of the PDRD premises in Oddar Meanchey and the\nPMU  premises  in  Sisophon.  Advance  action  will  also  facilitate  capacity  building  in  the  initial\nstages  of  implementation  and  identification  of  activities  to  be  financed,  and  ensure  the\ncommitment  of  counterpart  funds  required  early  for  de-mining  of  road  alignments.  The\nGovernment  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to\napprove or finance the Project, and does not include retroactive financing.\n\n6.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n98.\nRural  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  and  some  selected  strategic  existing\nalignments  will  require  routine  and  periodic  maintenance27  during  and  after  the  Project.  Both\nfor  maintenance  activities  during\nloan \n\nfunds  will  be  provided \n\nfunds  and  counterpart \n\n                  \n\n27  Routine maintenance, including activities such as filling potholes, must be done on a regular basis to ensure the\ncontinued  operation  of  roads.  This  is  carried  out  at  relatively  low  cost  ($350  per  year  per  km)  using  the  LBAT\nmodel. Periodic maintenance involves overlaying of surface material once every 3-5 years at a maximum cost of\n$4,000 per km.\n\n\f26\n\nimplementation.  Loan  funds  will  be  provided  on  a  declining  share  over  time  (100  percent  for\nyear 1 after loan effectiveness, 75 percent for year 2, 50 percent for year 3, 25 percent for year\n4,  and  none  afterward),  while  counterpart  funds  will  increase  proportionally  to  meet  full\nmaintenance requirements by project completion. The Project will also (i) assist in establishing\nrural road maintenance committees at the district level, similar to the ones recently established\nin  seven  districts  of  Siem  Reap  Province,  to  gradually  take  responsibility  for  coordinating,\norganizing, and managing maintenance of roads improved under the Project; (ii) in areas of high\npopulation density, train local maintenance groups with workers paid a daily rate (as under the\nRIIP  project);  and  in  less  populous  areas,  use  small  local  contractors  or  pieceworkers  for\nmaintenance;  (iv)  provide  technical  support  and  training  in  maintenance  procedures  to  PDRD\nrural  roads  offices  and  to  district  road  maintenance  committees;  (v)  introduce  preventive\nmeasures that restrict the size of vehicles permitted to use rehabilitated roads and traffic on wet\nroads; and (vi) explore the introduction of alternative low-cost labor-based technologies for more\ndurable  road  surfacing  materials  (e.g.,  bamboo  reinforced  concrete,  dressed  stone  paving,\nhand-laid bituminous surface dressing, etc.) that are being tested in the project area by ILO.\n\nThe Project will also provide funds for maintaining schools and health facilities through a\n99.\ndeclining loan funding arrangement similar to the one adopted for rural road maintenance. The\nO&M  of  village  infrastructure,  such  as  water  supplies  and  other  facilities,  will  be  the\nresponsibility  of  the  beneficiaries,  who  will  be  assisted  through  community  development\nactivities,  appropriate  training,  and  associated  awareness  campaigns.  For  constructed  or\nupgraded  markets,  the  established  market  committees  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  market\nfacilities, and will finance these activities with market user fees so as to enhance cost recovery.\n\nfunds  (disbursed \n\nTo ensure effective and timely disbursement for maintenance of the rural infrastructure\n100.\nrehabilitated  or  constructed  under  the  Project,  the  Government  will  establish  in  each  project\nprovince  a  separate  maintenance  account.  This  account  will  be  regularly  replenished  from\ncounterpart \nthe  recently\nestablished  national  rural  road  funds,  and  from  other  available/planned  national  or  provincial\nsources)  provided  for  the  O&M  activities  of  the  Project  (Table  A8.3  in  Appendix  8).\nDisbursement from these maintenance accounts will be jointly managed and monitored by the\nrespective PDRDs and PIUs and regularly reviewed by the PMU and ADB. The accounts will be\nsubject to a separate audit opinion (as part of the overall project annual external audit) to ensure\nthat the funds deposited in them are strictly applied to the purpose for which they were intended.\n\nfrom  government  budgetary  allocation\u2013i.e., \n\n7.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\nThe  Government  will  make  available  through  budgetary  allocation  the  proceeds  of  the\n\n101.\nloan to MRD and PMU to be applied to finance project expenditures.\n\nTo expedite disbursements, MRD and PMU will each establish a first-generation imprest\n102.\naccount  with  a  recognized  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  immediately  after  loan\neffectiveness.  Payments  will  be  made  to  and  from  these  accounts  for  eligible  expenditures\nunder  the  Project.  Four  second-generation  imprest  accounts  will  also  be  opened  by  PIUs  at\nrecognized commercial banks acceptable to ADB in the project provinces. These accounts will\nbe used to meet eligible expenditures under the Project incurred by the four PIUs. Each imprest\naccount will be managed by MRD, PMU or the concerned PIU, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan\nDisbursement  Handbook  (January  2001),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the\nGovernment and ADB. The initial combined total amount in all imprest accounts will not exceed\nsix  months  of  estimated  expenditure  and  not  more  than  10  percent  of  the  total  loan.  ADB\u2019s\nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  followed  to  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate\n\n\f27\n\nimprest  accounts  for  payments  below  the  ceiling  of  $50,000.  The  fund  flow  mechanism  is\ndiagrammatically presented in Figure A5.4 of Appendix 5.\n\n103. During  project  processing,  ADB's  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  government\nofficials,  particularly  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption,  as  stated  in  ADB's  Guidelines for\nProcurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\n8.\n\nReporting, Accounts, and Audits\n\n104.\nThe PIUs will provide the PMU with concise quarterly progress reports during each year\nof implementation, detailing the physical and financial progress of activities against agreed-upon\ntargets and summarizing benefit monitoring and evaluation results. In turn, the PMU will submit\nto MRD consolidated quarterly progress reports and a comprehensive annual progress report,\nand MRD will forward these reports to the Government and ADB. Within three months of project\ncompletion, a project completion report in the standard ADB format will be prepared by the PMU\nand submitted to ADB. Progress reports will include a follow-up of the progressive Government\nimplementation  of  its  decentralization  and  deconcentration  policy  and  the  consequent\ninstitutional change in the project provinces.\n\nfrom \n\nfinanced \n\nloan  proceeds, \n\n105.\nThe PMU and PIUs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the\nfinancing  resources  received,\ngoods  and  services \nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  the  use  of  local  funds.  Accounts  will  be  established\nand maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and following the\nguidelines  in  the  Project  Accounting  Manual  of  MEF  as  amended  from  time  to  time.\nConsolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  compiled  by  the\nPMU/MRD  and  audited  annually  by  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The\naudited  accounts,  audit  report,  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not\nlater than twelve months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\nthe \n\n106. During the initial three years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews. Initial\nreviews  will  (i)  determine  if  all  proposed  implementation  arrangements  are  appropriate  and  in\nplace, (ii) assess the progress of infrastructure screening activities, (iii) review the construction\nprogram for civil works, (iv) review the poverty focus of the different components, and (v) review\nthe conduct and outcome of the capacity building and training programs. During the third year,\nADB and the Government, will undertake a comprehensive midterm review. The midterm review\nwill  evaluate  the  actual  physical  and  financial  progress  of  the  Project,  community-based\napproach,  implementation  procedures,  procurement  performance,  PMU  effectiveness,  and\nperformance  of  the  consultants.  Before  the  midterm  review,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a\ncomprehensive  report  identifying  issues  for  the  mission\u2019s  consideration.  On  the  basis  of  the\nresults  of \nthe  expected  progressive\nimplementation  of  the  Government's  decentralization  and  deconcentration  policy  and  the\ninstitutional changes that are likely to occur during the project period, changes in project design\nand implementation arrangements will be considered.\n\nthe  midterm  review,  and  especially \n\nin  view  of \n\n9.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n107. Outputs of the Project will be monitored and evaluated in terms of efficiency (quantities\ndelivered)  and  effectiveness  (quality  of  the  goods/services  delivered  and  their  impact  on  the\nbeneficiaries).  Gender-sensitive  participatory  approaches  will  be  adopted  in  monitoring  village\nand  commune  activities.  The  services  required  under  NGO  contracts  will  include  facilitation  of\nparticipatory  monitoring  in  the  construction  of  village  infrastructure,  as  well  as  its  use  by  the\n\n\f28\n\nvarious vulnerable groups in the community. To generate data on the immediate effects and the\nbroader impacts of the project investments on socioeconomic development, poverty reduction,\nand the empowerment of vulnerable groups, a baseline survey will be conducted at the start of\nintensive  activities  in  each  commune  and  village.  The  communities  will  develop  their  own\npoverty indicators that will be used during subsequent impact assessments. This will establish\nthe  control  against  which  the  project  impact  will  be  assessed.  Subsequent  comprehensive\nassessments  will  be  undertaken  two  years  after  intensive  activities  have  been  initiated  and  at\nproject  completion  to  assist  in  impact  assessment  in  addition  to  annual  socioeconomic  data\nupdates  undertaken  by  PDRD  and  information  generated  by  WFP,  LPP,  and  IRAP  on  an\nongoing basis.\n\n108. One  of  the  key  areas  for  impact  monitoring  will  be  the  incidence  and  length  of  food\ninsecurity in the project area. This will be monitored, drawing on information generated by WFP\nand outputs from participatory monitoring conducted under NGO contracts. Similarly, the extent\nof village savings mobilization will be monitored by cooperating NGOs and its impact on income\ngeneration activities will be reported regularly as required under NGO contractual obligations to\nthe respective PIUs. Construction contractors will be required to monitor and report the person-\ndays used in construction and the wages paid for such services. The impact of improved access\nwill  be  monitored  through  farm  input  and  output  prices  as  well  as  through  NGO-facilitated\nannual  reviews  using  participatory  techniques  involving  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.\nQualitative  assessments  will  indicate  how  improved  access  has  contributed  to  changing  the\nsocial  services  available  in  the  areas.  The  effects  of  project  activities  to  increase  beneficiary\nparticipation  and  to  increase  the  institutional  capacity  of  local  government  bodies  will  be\nmonitored  through  participatory  evaluation  exercises  facilitated  by  the  technical  specialists\nprovided under the Project. Key indicators that will be used to monitor the performance of the\nProject in achieving its overall objective are in Appendix 1.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironmental Measures\n\nIncremental  deforestation  and \n\n109. An initial environmental examination (IEE) carried out for the Project concluded that the\nrisk of a negative impact on the environment is minor. In accordance with ADB requirements28\nand Cambodian law, selected road alignments will require individual IEEs and, in some cases,\nmay further require an environmental impact assessment (EIA). Similarly, road rehabilitation will\nrequire  environmental  monitoring. \nincremental  use  of\nagrochemicals  due  to  agriculture  intensification  are  other  environmental  risks  that  were\nexamined. They are unlikely to cause any significant impact, but will require monitoring where\nsuch impact is expected. The current environmental assessment and monitoring capabilities of\nthe Provincial Environmental Department (PED) and the PDRD in the four project provinces are\nweak due to limited experience. The Project will provide appropriate environmental training for\nselected  staff  from  these  departments  in  the  project  provinces.  The  training  will  require  an\ninternational  environmental  assessment  trainer  for  two  months  at  the  start  of  the  Project.  A\ndomestic environment consultant will be employed for two months to work with the international\nenvironmental assessment trainer and subsequently for two months in years 2 and 3 and one\nmonth in years 4 and 5 to check the work of the four PDRDs and PEDs in preparing the IEE/EIA\nfor  the  next  year\u2019s  proposed  road  alignments.  The  domestic  environment  consultant  also  will\n\n                  \n\n28  ADB's Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects,  1993;  and Environmental Guidelines and\n\nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements, 1998.\n\n\f29\n\nreview  the  PDRD\u2019s  and  PED\u2019s  environmental  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  road\nalignment for quality assurance.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Measures\n\n110.\nThe Legacy of War. Poverty in the project area can be attributed to the extended period\nof  conflict.  A  significant  part  of  the  population  has  suffered  extreme  conditions  such  as\ndeprivation,  refugee  camps,  internal  displacement,  famine,  and  family  disruption.  Social\ncohesion,  especially  in  the  newly  established  villages,  is  low.29  Persistent  food  insecurity  and\ncontinued  exposure  to  land  mines  further  compound  the  desperate  living  conditions.  Poor\nfarmers obtain livelihood from farming, herding, hunting, and collecting forest products, even in\nmined  areas.  The  implications  for  people\u2019s  ability  to  work,  plan  for  the  future,  and  solve\nproblems  are  rarely  discussed  and  poorly  understood.  The  current  state  of  community\ndevelopment  can,  in  part,  be  attributed  to  trauma-related  stress,  highlighting  the  need  for\ngreater  inputs  in  training,  encouragement,  and  follow-up  activities.  The  Project  will  take\nadequate account of these characteristics through its strategic phased approach.\n\n111. Mines  and  Unexploded  Ordnance.  Years  of  armed  conflict  have  led  to  an\nunprecedented degree of mine and UXO contamination in Cambodia, with some of the highest\nconcentrations  found  in  the  northwestern  provinces.  Villagers  have  often  resettled  before  de-\nmining was completed. They tend to clear individual house lots, farmland, and the pathways to\naccess common property such as forestland or water sources. Adult males make up 53 percent\nof  casualties,  which  reflects  their  higher  involvement  in  clearing  land  for  cultivation,  and\ncollecting  timber  and  nontimber  forest  products.  Casualties  among  women  are  6  percent  and\nchildren under 18 years old, 41 percent. The high incidence of child casualties seems to be a\nresult of their tampering with mines and UXOs and their lack of awareness of the dangers. The\nProject  will  take  adequate  account  of  these  dangers,  with  de-mining  to  be  done  according  to\ninternational standard operating procedures and in adequate response to the needs of the rural\npopulation  (paras.  60  and  138-iv).  The  use  of  community  minefield  marking  teams  will  be\nincluded,  as  there  is  a  need  to  clear  pathways  to  safely  access  village  infrastructure,  health\nfacilities,  and  schools  constructed  under  the  Project.  Mine  awareness  training  will  be  given  to\nthe population, specifically targeting children and following an improved, more people-centered,\nand needs-based approach.\n\n112.\nLack  of  Infrastructure  and  Access  to  Services.  In  the  course  of  intensive  social\nsurveys undertaken during project preparation and confirmed during loan processing, villagers\nidentify  the  improvement  of  roads  as  their  number  one  priority.  Other  infrastructure  (schools,\nhealth services, markets, clean water supplies, and rice drying and storage facilities) are often\nnonexistent or in complete disrepair. Their lack limits access and hinders economic and social\ndevelopment. In partnership with NGOs, the Project will put procedures in place to ensure that\nbeneficiaries,  including  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  are  consulted  during  the  identification,\nprioritization,  planning,  survey,  and  design  stages.  Securing  their  livelihood  occupies  the  poor\nand  very  poor  throughout  the  year  and  does  not  leave  them  time  for  voluntary  work.  The  two\ngroups have to be paid adequately. Wherever possible every effort will be made to ensure that\nthe poorest local people are given priority for jobs through LBAT. The Project will engage labor\ninspectors to ensure that poor members of communities, especially women, are informed of job\n\n                  \n\n29  A  project  funded  by  a  grant  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  Reducing  Trauma-Induced\nPoverty in Northwestern Cambodia, aimed at the most vulnerable groups in the project area, is being developed in\nconjunction with the Project. The JFPR project will be implemented over a three-year period and will enable the\nwar-affected poor to participate in village development and to access government services. The JFPR proposal will\nbe presented to the Government of Japan in December 2001.\n\n\f30\n\nopportunities and that workers are paid in full and on time at current market rates. Road safety\ncampaigns  will  be  carried  out  in  communities  along  the  roads  rehabilitated  under  the  Project.\nChildren should be specifically targeted through the schools. Speed breakers will be installed in\nvillages to reduce dust and as an additional safety measure (Table A2.3).\n\n113. Previously, villagers experienced problems in managing small-scale infrastructure due to\nlack  of  participation  in  prioritizing  and  decision  making.  The  Project  will  consider  longer  time\nspans  for  preparing  villagers,  making  sure  that  the  technologies  used  are  appropriate;  that\nlocation  and  designs  are  adequate;  that  prioritization  of  small  infrastructure  includes  the  poor\nand vulnerable groups, especially women; and that local capacities to manage the facilities are\nstrengthened.  Constructing  latrines  and  improving  access  to  water  will  go  hand  in  hand  with\nawareness-raising  campaigns  and  thorough  training  in  maintenance,  hygiene,  and  preventive\nhealth care.\n\n114. Security of Land Tenure. The provinces of Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem\nReap  report  high  incidences  of  land  disputes,  which  have  often  disadvantaged  the  poor.\nInfrastructure development, particularly the road improvements, will further increase the value of\nland  along  those  roads  and  increase  the  risk  of  land  disputes.  The  Project  will  ensure  that\nproject beneficiaries will be supported in obtaining ownership title or other occupancy rights in\naccordance with the Land Law (para. 61). No new roads will be constructed, the existing road\nalignments  will  not  be  widened,  and  no  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  are\nexpected except for a few isolated cases that will require the preparation of a short resettlement\nplan to be submitted to ADB for approval. Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement will not\noccur  in  the  context  of  constructing  social  infrastructure,  as  public  land  is  available  and  the\nconstruction  sites  will  be  identified  in  consultation  with  the  communities.  There  are  isolated\ncases where a few households have settled on market premises. Any decision on the upgrading\nof  such  markets  will  be  subject  to  submission  of  an  economic  and  social  feasibility  study,\nincluding a short resettlement plan for ADB's approval if the need arises.\n\n115.\nLack of Social Cohesion. New settlements and resettlements are located along roads\nto  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  and  comprise  former  internally  displaced  persons,\nrepatriated  refugees,  and  internal  migrants  in  search  of  better  economic  opportunities.  A  high\nnumber  of  formally  or  informally  demobilized  soldiers  reside  in  the  target  area.  They  are\nintegrated into the villages and earn their living through farming. They will benefit equally from\nthe Project as other villagers. Social cohesion between the different groups is lacking; tensions\nexist along political lines and between groups, particularly regarding favoritism in the distribution\nof  development  assistance.  The  Project  will  consider  the  situation  and  will  contract  selected\nNGOs for the community development activities using participatory processes and a transparent\nand open community decision-making process. No ethnic minorities live in the project area.\n\n116. Gender  Issues. Women  form the majority of the working age population in the project\narea (51.4 percent). Generally,  the Khmer system provides equal rights to males and females\nwith  regard  to  property,  ownership,  and  inheritance.  In  practice,  these  norms  have  been\nmoderated by traditions and an environment that values men more than women. Women\u2019s roles\nstill tend to be seen as being good wives, which means being submissive, docile, and assuming\nhousehold  duties.  Their  role  in  decision  making  at  the  village,  commune,  and  higher  levels\nremains weak and needs strengthening. Their workload is considerable, comprising household\nmanagement; caring for children, the sick, and elderly; and also agricultural work such as land\nclearing  and  hunting.  Women  heads  of  households  are  forced  to  take  on  men\u2019s  roles  and\nresponsibilities, and the absence of men increases the disparities in income. Such women are\nunable to clear and prepare the same amount of land and therefore produce less food. If they\n\n\fseek wage labor, they are often paid less than men.\n\n31\n\n117.\nThe  Project  will  take  women\u2019s  roles  and  different  economic  and  social  conditions  into\nconsideration.  The  strategy  to  address  their  needs,  constraints  and  participation  includes  (i)\nspecifically targeting women heads of households for employment and equal pay in the labor-\nintensive  road  construction  works;  (ii)  training  in  management  and  maintenance  of  small\ninfrastructure;  (iii)  encouraging  women  to  expand  their  income-generating  activities  through\nmembership and active involvement in the savings and credit groups (at present 75-80 percent\nof beneficiaries reached in similar schemes are women); (iv) organizing women-only discussion\nand  planning  groups  to  allow  them  to  speak  freely;  (v)  timing  the  training,  discussions,  and\nplanning sessions according to women\u2019s availability; (vi) providing functional literacy, particularly\nnumeric  literacy  training;  (vii)  supporting  and  training  female  members  of  village  development\ncommittees,  other  community-based  organizations,  and  the  future  commune  councils  to  allow\nfull participation in public meetings; (viii) specific awareness campaigns for men and women on\njoint  registration  and  land  titling;  and  (ix)  information  and  awareness-raising  campaigns  using\nwomen-specific information channels.\n\n118.\nThrough  improved  access  to  water  and  sanitation  and  improved  hygiene  and  health,\nwomen\u2019s  workloads  will  be  reduced  to  enable  them  to  participate  more  actively  in  decision\nmaking in village development activities. The cooperation of the provincial and district personnel\nof the Ministry of Women and Veterans\u2019 Affairs will be sought. The four community development\nspecialists  under  the  Project  will  have  a  proven  track  record  in  gender  and  development\nactivities, and will coordinate and supervise the implementation of the strategy.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nThe Project was formulated as part of the Government's objective of poverty reduction in\n119.\nthe  rural  areas  of  northwestern  Cambodia.  SEDP  II  (2001-2005)  not  only  provides  for  a\nredistribution  of  public  investment  in  the  social  sectors  (health  and  education),  but  also\nrecognizes  the  key  role  that  the  transport  network  plays  in  providing  access  to  facilitate  the\ndelivery  of  social  sector  services  and  to  stimulate  economic  activity.  The  Project  supports  the\nGovernment's  focus  in  these  sectors  with  the  overall  goal  of  poverty  reduction,  with  some  70\npercent  of  total  costs  being  allocated  to  infrastructure  establishment  and  rehabilitation.  The\namount will be directed primarily at road rehabilitation, health and education facilities, and small-\nscale  infrastructure  to  be  established  in  the  communes  and  villages  of  the  target  area.  The\nimproved  access  and  incremental  social  services  made  available  through  these  public\ninvestments  constitute  the  necessary  prerequisites  for  economic  growth  in  northwestern  rural\nCambodia. The Project will also attend to the needed capacity building in government agencies,\nin  beneficiary  communities,  and  in  the  private  sector  to  ensure  efficient  implementation.\nFurthermore,  it  will  promote  a  savings  discipline  among  vulnerable  groups  and  others  in  the\ntarget villages as a precursor to accessing formal credit facilities to finance production activities\nat district and provincial levels.\n\n1.\n\nBenefits\n\n120.\nThe impact of the Project will be evident at several levels. The benefits from an improved\nrural  road  network  will  be  realized  by  all  inhabitants  throughout  the  project  area,  totaling\n580,000  people  or  114,000  rural  families,  of  whom  40  percent  live  below  the  poverty  line.\nAdditional benefits will be received by communities within the area of influence of the rural road\n\n\f32\n\nnetwork  from  further  investments  in  small-scale  infrastructure  where  the  impact  will  be  more\nlocalized. An estimated 40 communes or about 180 villages will benefit from these investments\nfollowing the establishment of year-round access along rehabilitated roads.\n\n121. Benefits  identified  from  the  project  interventions  all  relate  to  improved  access.  In  the\ncase of the rehabilitation of rural roads, farmers will have improved access to production inputs\n(e.g.,  seed  and  other  planting  material)  and  to  government  extension  services  to  support  the\nnew  technologies.  With  better  market  access,  they  will  be  able  to  consider  production\nalternatives  and  higher-value  crops.  They  will  benefit  from  reduced  transport  costs  for  input\nsupplies and the marketing of production surpluses. With reduced transport costs, farmers will\nrespond  to  production  incentives  through  the  price  mechanism  that  will  further  stimulate  rural\nfood production and contribute to reducing the extensive periods of food insecurity in the target\nareas.\n\n122.\nIn  addition  to  these  production-oriented  benefits,  inhabitants  of  rural  communities  will\nhave better access to health and education services. The cost of seeking medical treatment will\nbe  reduced  and  the  time  spent  traveling  to  reach  these  facilities  will  be  reduced  significantly.\nWith year-round road access, the services will be available during the wet season when malaria\nis  an  area-wide  problem.  Vehicle  operating  costs  (VOC)  and  people\u2019s  travel  time  will  also  be\nreduced. One of the direct benefits during the construction phase is the use of LBAT on some\n60  percent  of  the  613  km  to  be  rehabilitated.  Based  on  the  estimated  labor  input  of  2,000\nperson-days  per  km  achieved  in  the  RIIP,  some  $0.75  million  will  be  directly  injected  into  the\nlocal economy, which will stimulate economic activity, where there is already a high propensity\nto spend.\n\n123. Benefits identified from investing in small-scale village infrastructure will be received by\nfewer individuals, but will still represent a significant outcome for the Project. Water remains one\nof  the  primary  concerns  expressed  by  villagers  during  project  preparation.  The  Project  will\nrespond  to  this  concern  with  the  construction  of  an  estimated  170  wells  and  some  60  ponds.\nTraining in public health and hygiene associated with the provision of water facilities will have a\nsignificant impact on the villagers' capacity to work and pursue their livelihoods. The Project will\nalso assist in establishing small local businesses to produce the squatting slabs for pit latrines\nand, possibly, concrete rings, further contributing to increasing economic activity in the area.\n\n124. Economic  evaluation  cannot  capture  all  benefits  described,  but  has  estimated  those\narising from the anticipated agricultural production surplus, savings in VOC, and value of travel\ntime saved. Details for the analysis of each component are in Appendix 10.\n\n125.\nThe  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  road  rehabilitation  and\nmicrofinance components is 19.79 percent. The analysis is based on conservative assumptions.\nSensitivity analysis indicates that only in two combination scenarios does the EIRR fall below 12\npercent.  The  highest  risk  is  if  the  funding  for  road  maintenance  does  not  materialize  as\nprogrammed.  If  funding  is  only  50  percent  of  what  was  planned,  benefits  will  fall  substantially\nand reduce the EIRR to 7.17 percent.\n\n\f33\n\nTable 3: Summary of Sensitivity Analysis\n\nItem\nBase case\nAgricultural producer surplus\nVOC and times savings\nAll benefits\nAll costs\nDelay in Benefits\nCombination 1:\nAll benefits\nAll costs\nCombination 2:\nFunding of maintenance costs\nAll benefits years 2 to 5\nAll benefits years 6 onward\n\nChange\n0\n-20%\n-20%\n-20%\n+20%\n2 years\n\n-20\n+20\n\n-50%\n-30%\n-50%\n\n2.\n\nNonquantifiable Benefits\n\nEIRR (%)\n19.79\n17.82\n16.37\n14.25\n15.21\n12.67\n\n10.26\n\n7.17\n\nSwitching Value (%)\n\n-68\n-46\n-28\n+38\n\n126. Benefits  that  are  less  easily  measured  include  the  impact  from  capacity-building\nactivities.  These  will  be  directed  at  improving  the  technical  and  management  skills  of  PDRD,\nwhich  will  be  institutionalized  within  government  structures  and  as  such,  will  continue  to  be\navailable for development activities in the future. Similarly, a significant investment will be made\nin MRD planning capacity and its provincial offices with the establishment of IRAP, the Ministry's\npreferred  planning  tool.  This  tool  will  provide  the  capacity  to  rationalize  rehabilitation  plans\nbased on poverty reduction criteria and will be extended countrywide over time.\n\nIn  terms  of  community  development,  the  Project  will  assist  in  strengthening  the  self-\n127.\nreliance of the poor and vulnerable groups in communities by giving them a voice in determining\nfuture community development activities. It will also support the Government's decentralization\ninitiatives by strengthening  the village and commune leaders to enable them to carry out their\ntasks more effectively.\n\nB.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n128. Poverty  is  widespread  in  the  project  area  with  its  causes  and  characteristics  largely\nattributed to the long period of conflict and instability. It is evident in (i) people\u2019s lack of access to\nrural roads and markets, (ii) limited access to social services, (iii) persisting food insecurity, and\n(iv) low levels of social cohesion.\n\n129.\nThe  most  immediate  project  impact  will  be  in  providing  employment  for  the  people,\nespecially the poor and vulnerable groups that will receive priority in working on the rural road\nrehabilitation  works.  Documented  benefits  reported  from  labor-based  road  construction  in\nCambodia  by  ILO  and  NGOs  include  increased  availability  of  daily  necessities  at  lower  prices\n(up  to  50  percent),  increased  sales  of  local  produce  at  higher  prices  (up  to  100  percent),  and\nreduced prices of consumer goods. Furthermore, enhanced access to agricultural extension and\ninputs, and to health and education services will increase household incomes and contribute to\npoverty  reduction.  The  rehabilitated  markets  will  give  farmers  better  opportunities  to  sell  their\nproduce  for  higher  prices,  and  will  offer  better  sanitary  facilities  that  will  reduce  health  and\ndisease problems. Markets also facilitate social interaction, including information dissemination,\n\n\f34\n\nwhich will positively impact on social cohesion. The construction of primary schools will improve\neducation levels in villages and reduce distances children have to walk to school, thus reducing\nschool dropout rates. The improved access to water and sanitation facilities at the village level\nwill  improve  hygiene  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases.  It  will  also  reduce\nwomen\u2019s workload as they are responsible for collecting drinking water as well as for taking care\nof the sick.\n\n130.\nThe  adoption  of  an  inclusive  process  of  prioritization  where  the  needs  and  priorities  of\npoor  and  vulnerable  groups  are  considered  and  project  activities  related  to  enhancement  of\nrural livelihood will contribute considerably to trust and confidence building among these groups,\nto  their  recognition  within  the  communities,  and  further  social  cohesion.  Participatory\napproaches  in  identifying  needs  and  subsequent  training  in  the  management  and  use  of\nfacilities  will  also  ensure  beneficiaries\u2019  appreciation  of  the  value  of  these  investments  and\ncommitment to their sustainability.\n\n131.\nThe  savings  and  credit  initiatives  will  considerably  contribute  to  trust  and  confidence\nbuilding, the gain of self-esteem, and a protection against economic shocks particularly for the\npoor  and  vulnerable.  The  provision  of  land  titles  to  people  settling  along  road  alignments  will\nassure poor people of ownership and an additional assurance in times of extreme shocks.\n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n132. De-mining  of  rural  road  alignments  to  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  is  a  critical\nactivity  in  implementing  the  rural  infrastructure  development  component.  It  is  the  financial\nresponsibility  of  the  Government,  and  untimely  release  of  the  counterpart  funds  for  these\nactivities may result in implementation delays. This issue is being addressed by timely reporting\non  the  release  of  counterpart  funds  following  the  approval  of  annual  work  plans.  It  is  also\ncovered in a specific assurance given by the Government.\n\n133.\nThe  major  risk  associated  with  rural  roads  is  inadequate  maintenance.  Under  the  RIIP\nand  earlier  projects  implemented  by  ILO,  systems  and  procedures  for  routine  and  periodic\nmaintenance  of  rural  roads  that  were  developed  and  tested  have  demonstrated  satisfactory\nresults  and  cost-effectiveness.  Sustainable  financing  arrangements  and  a  legal  framework  to\nsupport such arrangements still need to be developed. The RIIP is currently assisting MRD in\naddressing this issue. The ADB-funded Transport Sector Strategy study is also addressing the\nissue  of  road  network  maintenance.  The  project  design  provides  a  component  for  rural  road\nmaintenance  and  requires  the  Government  to  shoulder  a  substantial  share  of  maintenance\nexpenditures  during  the  investment  period.  The  Government  has  given  specific  assurance\nregarding the timely availability of the counterpart funds.\n\n134. A  common  cause  of  implementation  delay  in  Cambodia  is  the  lack  of  qualified  trained\ncounterpart staff with experience in aid-funded projects. This should not present a problem for\nthe  Project,  as  MRD  has  generally  performed  satisfactorily  in  implementing  ADB  projects.  To\nfurther  mitigate  the  risk,  (i)  the  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be  supported  by  expertise  in  technical  and\nfinancial  project  management,  (ii)  capacity  building  will  be  provided  for  government  agencies\nserving the rural development sector in the project area, and (iii) NGOs and local institutions will\nbe contracted to provide a mix of services to facilitate implementation.\n\nFor small-scale village infrastructure investments, the Project is dependent on commune\n135.\ninvestment  plans  generated  under  the  LPP  as  its  point  of  entry  in  prioritizing  eligible\ninvestments. This, in turn, is dependent on the LPP activities funded by the Seila program. It is\n\n\f35\n\nrecognized that the Seila program has not achieved full coverage of the target project districts.\nWhile  there  are  plans  to  achieve  100  percent  coverage  (whereby  all  communes  will  have\ncommune investment plans) by the start of the Project, the rapid expansion of the Seila program\nposes  a  risk  that  the  communes  may  not  possess  investment  plans  by  the  time  access  roads\nhave  been  rehabilitated  and  intensive  activities  under  project  financing  are  ready  to  begin.\nShould  this  situation  arise,  the  screening  process  planned  under  the  Project  will  have  to  be\nupgraded  to  a  more  comprehensive  facilitation,  identification,  and  prioritization  process,  still\nworking  with  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  to  achieve  the  desired  outcome  of  infrastructure\ninvestments.\n\n136.\nThe overall project goal of poverty reduction will be addressed through the provision of\ninfrastructure  in  support  of  rural  development.  It  is  recognized  that  the  road  network  is  the\nnecessary prerequisite for socioeconomic development in isolated rural areas\u2013and is the main\noutput  of  the  Project.  Spontaneous  development  cannot  be  expected  immediately  after  road\naccess is achieved, as a road alone is not a sufficient condition for development. There needs\nto  be  further  investment  in  production-oriented  or  income-generating  initiatives,  in  developing\nsocial  services,  in  strengthening  local  governance,  and  in  enhancing  community  cohesion.  A\nrisk is that such investments will not eventuate, which will reduce the Project's potential impact.\nThe  Government,  aid  agencies,  and  NGOs  recognize  northwestern  Cambodia  as  one  of  the\nmore  needy  regions.  The  international  community  has  given  high  priority  to  development\nassistance in this area, as has ADB. With the likelihood of further development projects being\ndirected in this area, the risk is considered minimal.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n137.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  LBAT  will  be  used  for  rural  road\nrehabilitation  under  the  Project  wherever  possible;  (b)  the  poor  and  very  poor\npopulation  (50  percent  of  them  being  women,  subject  to  availability)  will  be\noffered  employment  in  road  rehabilitation  work;  and  (c)  labor  inspectors  will  be\nengaged  to  confirm  gender  equity  in  the  contractor\u2019s  employment  practices  and\npayment to the workers of the appropriate market wage rate in a timely manner.\n\nfunds \n\nfor  maintaining \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  ensure  that  during  the  implementation  period,\ngovernment  counterpart \nrehabilitated  or\nrequired \nconstructed  rural  infrastructure  are  made  available  on  a  timely  basis  and  at  an\nincreasing rate to match the declining provision of funds from the proceeds of the\nloan  (Appendix  7,  and  Table  A8.3  in  Appendix  8)  and  are  deposited  with  the\nmaintenance  accounts  (para.  100)  established  at  the  provincial  level;  and  (b)\nfollowing  project  completion,  make  available  necessary \nfull\nmaintenance  of  the  rural  infrastructure  rehabilitated  or  constructed  under  the\nProject.\n\nfunds \n\nfor \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  be  responsible  for  de-mining  the  alignments  along  tertiary\nroads to be rehabilitated under the Project. For that purpose, the Government will\n(a)  carry  out  or  authenticate  a  level-one  survey  of  the  project  area;  (b)  contract\nrecognized and accredited de-mining organizations to clear the road alignments\nof  any  land  mines  and  UXOs,  according  to  accepted  international  practices,\n\n\f36\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nfollowing a sequence to be agreed upon by the PMU, the concerned PIU, and the\nde-mining  teams;  and  (c)  engage  the  services  of  a  reputable  and  experienced\nmine security organization, acceptable to ADB, to confirm whether the respective\nroad  alignments  are  clear  of  mines.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  no  road\nrehabilitation will be undertaken until required de-mining has been completed and\ncertification on that is obtained. The Government will also ensure that counterpart\nfunds  are  made  available  on  a  timely  basis  (Appendix  7,  and  Table  A8.3  in\nAppendix 8) for such de-mining activities.\n\nThe  Government  will  engage  a  reputable  and  experienced  mine  security\norganization  acceptable  to  ADB  to  (a)  carry  out,  in  accordance  with  accepted\ninternational  practices,  de-mining  of  areas  where  community  facilities  will  be\nconstructed; and (b) in conjunction with the physical de-mining, clearly demarcate\nsafe  areas  adjacent  to  the  community  facilities  and  conduct  appropriate  mine\nawareness training among the local population.\n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  high  priority  will  be  given  to  further  mine\nclearance  in  lands  suitable  for  settlement  and  agriculture,  which  are  rendered\naccessible by the roads rehabilitated under the Project.\n\nThe  Government  will  give  all  necessary  support  to  persons  who  were  lawful\noccupants of the Project area on the date of promulgation of the 2001 Land Law,\nto obtain titles of possession and subsequently titles of ownership to the land in\naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Land  Law.  The  Government  will  ensure\nthat  persons  who  will  migrate  to,  and  settle  in  previously  uninhabited  areas\nadjacent to roads rehabilitated under the Project, and who pursuant to criteria to\nbe  developed  under  the  Land  Law  and  its  implementing  legislation  and\nregulations  can  be  given  the  right  to  occupy  such  areas,  will  be  given  legal\nevidence of such right before completion of the Project.\n\n(vii)  MRD will make available office space and facilities within the Department of Rural\nRoads in Phnom Penh to accommodate the establishment of IRAP and other GIS\nmethods  to  be  used  under  the  Project.  In  addition,  MRD  will  provide  the\nnecessary staff and basic office equipment to support provincial IRAP activities.\n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  wherever  possible,  public  markets  will  be\nconstructed  only  on  existing  market  sites  or  public  land  that  is  not  occupied  or\nused  otherwise  by  private  persons.  In  selecting  markets  for  upgrading,  the\nGovernment  will  take  into  account  the  views  of  target  beneficiaries  through\nsurveys and meetings at the village, commune, and district levels.\n\n(ix)\n\nThe Government will ensure that adverse environmental impact resulting from the\ncivil works under the rural infrastructure component of the Project, as identified in\nthe relevant IEE or EIA or both, is mitigated through measures acceptable to ADB\nand in accordance with the relevant environmental laws and regulations.\n\n(x)          The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  poor  and  vulnerable  people  in  the  project\narea  will  be  able  to  participate  in  prioritizing,  planning,  implementing,  and\nmonitoring  village-based  infrastructure  and  that  gender-sensitive  participatory\nin  ADB\u2019s  Framework  for\napproaches  will  be  employed,  as  described \nMainstreaming Participatory Development Processes.\n\n(xi) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  special  measures  will  be  undertaken  to\npromote the participation of women in the project activities. To such end, in each\nin  management  and  maintenance  of  small\nproject  district  (a) \n\ntraining \n\n\f37\n\ninfrastructure  will  have  at  least  30  percent  women;  (b)  functional  literacy  and\nparticularly  numeric  literacy  training  will  be  given;  (c)  supported  community-\nbased organizations will consist of at least 30 percent female members who will\nreceive  special  support  and  training  to  allow  them  full  participation  in  public\nmeetings; and (d) awareness campaigns will be organized for men and women\non joint land registration and titling.\n\nB.\n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness\n\n138. Prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  Government\u2019s  evaluation  of  proposals  from  shortlisted\nconsulting firms for all the consultants to be engaged following competitive bidding procedures\nwill be submitted to ADB for its concurrence.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n139.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  21,292,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Northwestern  Rural\nDevelopment Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter, and such

1\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY\n\nPoverty in Cambodia\n\nA. \n \n 1.\nCambodia ranks 137th out of 174 countries in poverty and is among the poorest countries in\nSoutheast Asia according to the United Nations Human Development Report. Only the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic (PDR) ranks lower at 140. Life expectancy at birth is 53.4 years,  the lowest in\nSoutheast Asia. The adult literacy rate (66 percent) is lower only than the  Lao PDR\u2019s (58.6 percent).\nInfant  mortality  (106  per  1,000  live  births)  and  maternal  mortality  rates  (900  per  100,000  live  births)\nare the highest in the region.\n \n 2.\nPoverty is severe and extensive, with pronounced inequality in consumption. It seems that a\nlarge  percentage  of  the  population  is  grouped  close  to  the  poverty  line  so  that  economic  events  or\npolicy  changes  could  significantly  alter  the  percentage  of  people  below  the  poverty  line.1  The\nconsumption-based absolute poverty line for Cambodia has been defined as adequate income to buy\na  daily  2,100-calorie  food  basket  plus  a  small  allowance  for  nonfood  expenditure.  In  1997  it  was\nestimated that about 36 percent of the population, over 4 million people, were below this poverty line.\nUrban areas are relatively better-off than the rural areas. About 90 percent of the poor (3,700,000) live\nin rural areas.\n \n 3.\nThe  causes  and  characteristics  of  poverty  to  a  large  degree  can  be  attributed  to  the  long\nperiod of conflict and instability, the damage and hardships done to the population who experienced\nkilling and death, forced labor, and displacement. The execution of educated Cambodians during the\nKhmer  Rouge  era  certainly  contributes  to  the  low  levels  of  human  capital,  greatly  hampering\ndevelopment efforts. Huge damage has been done to the infrastructure.\n \n 4.\nThe  Cambodian  poor,  as  the  Cambodia  HDR  1999  reports,  tend  to  have  less  access  to\nproductive resources. They live in villages with less access to markets, infrastructure, and economic\nservices;  and  no  access  to  educational  or  basic  health  services.  As  a  result  they  often  suffer  from\nfood  shortages,  which  can  lead  to  indebtedness  and  the  loss  of  farm  assets.  Poorer  villages  have\nhigher illiteracy rates and higher levels of gender disparity in literacy.\n \nB.\n \n\nRural Livelihood and Poverty in the Northwestern Provinces\n\n1.      Legacies of the War\n\n \n 5.\nPostconflict  Trauma.  The  four  provinces  in  northwestern  Cambodia  comprising  the  project\narea2 only recently emerged from 30 years of warfare and massive displacement.  Whereas most of\nCambodia  had  begun  to  enjoy  peace  by  the  early  1990s,  fighting  continued  in  the  northwest  until\n1998. The far more recent experiences related to violence and displacement add another dimension\nto poverty in the project area. The majority of the population has suffered extreme conditions such as\ndeprivation,  refugee  camps,  internal  displacement,  famine,  and  disruption  of  families,  rape,  and\ntorture.  Many  have  witnessed  violence  to  the  extreme,  including  death  or  killing  since  the  1970s.\nSocial  cohesion  in  the  villages,  especially  the  newly  established  ones,  is  low.  Persisting  food\ninsecurity and continuing threats to life due to the high incidence of land mines further compound the\ndesperate  living  conditions.  To  secure  their  livelihood,  poor  villagers  are  forced  to  farm,  herd,  hunt,\nand  collect  products  even  in  these  mined  areas.  The  implications  of  the  past  traumatic  experiences\nand  the  continuing  dangers  for  the  development  of  the  individual  and  the  community\u2013such  as\npeople\u2019s  ability  to  work,  to  plan  for  the  future  and  to  solve  problems\u2013are  rarely  discussed  and  little\nunderstood. But the extremely slow community development and the need for high inputs in terms of\n\n                                                \n 1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). Country Operational Strategy, Cambodia, July 2000.\n 2  Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Oddar Meanchey, and Siem Reap.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\neffort, training, encouragement and follow-ups in the project area can be partly attributed to trauma-\nrelated stress and have to be considered.\n \n 6.\nMines  and  Unexploded  Ordnance.  Years  of  armed  conflict  have  led  to  an  unprecedented\ndegree of mine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination in Cambodia with some of the highest\nconcentrations in the northwestern provinces. Nine of the 14 districts in the project area rank among\nthe 30 most affected districts (out of a total of 183 districts in the country) for mine casualties as these\nareas  experienced  the  most  protracted  conflicts  between  the  Khmer  Rouge  and  the  government\nforces. Mine accident rates are highest in districts where returning refugees from the Thai border have\nopened  new  land.  Villagers  have  often  resettled  before  de-mining  was  done.  Usually,  the  villagers\nclear  individual  plots  for  housing,  farming,  and  the  pathways  to  access  common  property  such  as\nforestland or water sources. Adult males make up 53 percent of casualties, which reflects their higher\ninvolvement  in  clearing  land  for  cultivation,  and  collecting  timber  and  nontimber  forest  products.\nCasualties among women are 6 percent and children under 18 years, 41 percent. The high incidence\nof child casualties result, of their tampering with mines and UXO, and their lack of awareness of the\ndangers.\n \nDisplacement and Migration. Displacement, which started in the late 1960s was caused by\n 7.\nbombing along the eastern part of Cambodia. In 1975, the Khmer Rouge forced inhabitants of cities to\njoin the agriculture revolution in the countryside. In 1978, many Cambodians were also forced to flee\nthe  country  when  the  Vietnamese  invasion  drove  the  Khmer  Rouge  from  power.  Thousands  fled  to\nThailand  and  settled  in  camps  along  the  border.  In  1989,  the  Vietnamese  troops  withdrew  from\nCambodia. The rebels resumed fighting and gained ground, resulting in the internal displacement of\n190,000  Cambodians  in  1989-1991.  The  displaced  originated  mainly  in  the  northwestern  provinces.\nBy  1991,  some  360,000  refugees  were  repatriated,  and  resettled  mostly  in  the  northwestern\nprovinces.  In  1997,  the  resurgence  of  fighting  generated  a  new  wave  of  displacement,  54,000\ninternally and 48,000 to new camps along the Thai border. In 1998, refugees returned from the Thai\nborder camps and most settled back in their villages of origin.\n \nLack of Social Cohesion. In 1999, the population in the targeted districts was 517,689 and\n 8.\naverage household size was 5.1 (Table A2.1). Female heads of households comprised 14.4 percent,\nlower  than  the  national  average  of  19.5  percent.  The  population  in  the  project  area  is  young,  with\nchildren forming 42 percent of the total. The number of disabled people (1.95 percent) is higher than\nthe national average (1.51 percent). Only 59 percent of the children aged 5-14 years attend school.\nThe reported literacy rate for adults in the project area is 33.4 percent for women and 42.9 percent for\nmen.\n \nNew settlements and resettlements along roads to be rehabilitated under the Project comprise\n 9.\nformer  internally  displaced  persons,  repatriated  refugees,  and  internal  migrants  in  search  of  better\neconomic  opportunities.  A  high  number  of  formally  or  informally  demobilized  soldiers  reside  in  the\ntarget  area.  They  are  integrated  into  the  villages,  earn  their  living  through  farming,  and  will  equally\nbenefit from the Project as the other villagers. Social cohesion in the groups is lacking; tensions exist\nbetween groups, particularly due to favoritism in the distribution of development assistance. No ethnic\nminorities live in the project area.\n \nLabor Shortage\u2013Food Insecurity. Labor shortage is the number one constraining factor for\n 10.\nhigher food production in the project area. The high loss of the male population during the war has left\nan unbalanced sex ratio and a deficit of male labor needed for agricultural work. In the majority of the\nsettlements,  the  people\u2019s  main  preoccupation  and  investment  are  in  clearing  and  preparing  land  for\nhouse lots and cultivation. They are reestablishing their livelihood systems, which is a slow process.\nThe collection of timber and nontimber forest products, as well as hunting and fishing are important\nlivelihood  activities  to  supplement  the  poor  people\u2019s  survival.  According  to  the  World  Food\nProgramme  (WFP),  more  than  40  percent  of  the  population  in  the  target  districts  do  not  have  food\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nsecurity.  Where  villages  have  re-established  themselves  and  people  resumed  normal  farming\nactivities, most are planting one wet season rice crop per year.\n \n \n\n Table A2.1: Overall Demographic Information\n\n Demographic Indicator\n Population 1999\n Percent of country representation\n\n Estimated population 2001\n\n Number of households 1999\n\n Average household size (persons)\n\n Percent households with female heads\n\n Age dependency ratio\n\n Sex ratio\n\n Disabled persons prevalence (per 1,000)\n\n Adult literacy rate\n\n School attendance (5-14 years old, %)\n\n Population with access to safe drinking water (%)\n\n Population with access to latrine (%)\n\n Cambodia\n\n 4 Provinces\n\n 14 Districts\n\n 11,182,468\n 100\n\n 11,737,000\n\n   2,110,000\n\n 2,246,490\n 20\n\n 2,358,000\n\n    423,015\n\n 517,689\n 4.6\n\n 543,000\n\n 101,120\n\n 5.30\n\n 19.5\n\n 76.8\n\n 93.6\n\n 1.51\n\n 62.8\n\n 66.5\n\n 29\n\n 14.5\n\n 5.31\n\n 14.8\n\n 83.5\n\n 94.3\n\n 1.66\n\n 46.2\n\n 63.1\n\n 17.7\n\n 12.5\n\n 5.13\n\n 14.4\n\n 84.5\n\n 95.6\n\n 1.95\n\n 38.1\n\n 59.0\n\n 6.5\n\n 3.8\n\n Source: Data  compiled from National Census 1998 and other sources.\n\n \n \nLand  Tenure.  Before  1960  the  land  belonged  to  the  god-king  with  usufruct  rights  for  the\n 11.\nindividual  farmer.  The  attempt  of  the  French  administration  to  introduce  French  land  law  was  not\nsuccessful. Under Pol Pot and the Vietnamese administration, all land was state-owned. Privatization\nof  land  started  in  1986  and  an  increase  in  poverty  was  observed.    Significant  parts  of  the  land\nbelonged to the military, were regarded as spoils of war, and would not be released without monetary\ncompensation. Returnees were disadvantaged during the 1993 and the 1998 repatriation. If land was\ngranted, it was of poor quality and heavily mined. As land was distributed on a first-come first-serve\nbasis,  internally  displaced  persons  arriving  earlier  than  the  returnees  from  the  camps  had  an\nadvantage. The provinces of Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap are considered areas\nwith a high incidence of land conflicts, which often disadvantaged the poor people in the past.\n \n\n2.      Community-Recognized Categories of Poverty\n\n \n 12.\nThe results of the qualitative investigation undertaken under the project preparatory technical\nassistance (TA) show that the rural population distinguishes four poverty groups within the village: the\nvery  poor,  the  poor,  the  medium-poor,  and  the  better-off  families.  Decisive  categories  for  well-being\nare  (i)  a  certain  state  of  mind;  (ii)  the  level  of  food  security;  (iii)  economic  characteristics  like  the\navailability  of  labor,  draft  animals;  and  (iv)  material  assets  (Table  A2.2).  By  these  categories  of\npoverty,  about  45  percent  of  the  population  in  the  older  established  villages  and  75  percent  of  the\npopulation  in  new  settlements  in  the  investigated  area  characterize  themselves  as  poor  and  very\npoor. Old established villages appear to comprise relatively more families belonging to the medium-\npoor and better-off strata, whereas new settlements and resettlements do not have better-off families\nat  all.  Only  the  medium-poor  and  better-off  families  would  belong  to  the  group  above  the  national\npoverty line.\n \n \n \n \n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\n3.      Access to Infrastructure and Services\n\n \n 13.\nTransport Infrastructure. Road infrastructure in the project area is poor. Most of the villages\nin the target districts cannot be accessed during rainy season, some are cut off for several months per\nyear. Some roads are little more than cart tracks or footpaths. The entire province of Oddar Meanchey\nis  inaccessible  during  2-3  months  of  the  rainy  season.  Villagers  indicate  that  they  receive\nconsiderably  lower  prices  per  kilogram  (kg)  of  paddy  sold  than  in  villages  with  better  road  access.\nPoor road access is the cause of the lack of important economic and social services. Access to the\ndistrict  is  important  because,  in  areas  with  low  population  density,  most  services  are  not  available\nbeyond this level. Villagers identify improvement of roads as their number one need.\n \n 14.\nSocial Infrastructure.  A number of villages have no access to school facilities within or at a\nreasonable distance from the village. About 50 percent of existing school facilities in the villages are in\nneed of repair. Existing health centers lack staff, equipment, and drugs. More than 96 percent of all\nhouseholds  lack  toilet  facilities.  The  main  sources  of  water  are  unprotected  hand-dug  wells  (46\npercent)  and  rivers,  ponds,  and  streams  (41  percent).  Only  6.5  percent  of  the  households  have\naccess to safe drinking water.\n \n\n4.      Community Decision Making\n\n \n 15.\nVillage  development  committees  (VDCs)  have  been  established  in  the  project  area.  They\nrepresent  the  villagers  in  the  commune  development  committee  (CDC),  organize  participatory\nplanning,  and  coordinate  the  management  of  development  programs  at  village  level.  In  the  past,\nvillagers\u2019 involvement in decision making was either limited or non-existent, the selection of the VDC\noften  predetermined  by  commune,  district,  and  provincial  authorities.  As  bottom-up  planning  using\nparticipatory approaches is a new concept, the community-based organizations are in need of further\nsupport and strengthening.\n \n 16.\nThe  local  population  is  also  not  used  to  participation.  They  have  only  experienced  being\nordered  and  told  what  to  do.  In  addition,  development  assistance  to  the  villagers  is  emergency  in\nnature and relief oriented, and does not require them to participate in decision making.\n \n\n5.      NGO Activities in the Project Area\n\n \nDue  to  Cambodia\u2019s  severely  devastated  human  resources,  and  the  embargo  that  most\n 17.\nWestern governments imposed with the Vietnamese military takeover, aid agencies were prevented\nfrom establishing themselves in the country. Providing assistance to the Cambodian Government was\nleft to international nongovernment organization (NGOs). Although bilateral agencies have returned,\nthe  number  of  international  NGOs  is  still  high;  currently  more  than  250  are  active  in  the  country.3\nSome  of  them  are  in  the  process  of  transforming  into  local  organizations,  but  due  to  the  lack  of\nnational skilled and professional managers, this process is slow.\n\n \n\nMore than 100 NGOs are found in the project area, where they contribute substantially to the\n18.\nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  the  communities.  The  number  is  higher  in  the  provinces  of\nBattambang  and  Siem  Reap,  than  in  Banteay  Meanchey.  In  Oddar  Meanchey,  only  few  NGOs  are\nactive at present. Some of them are emergency relief organizations, but quite a number combine the\nprovision of most needed small-scale village infrastructure with livelihood programs, or cooperate with\nWFP in food for work. Many combine their activities with de-mining efforts in cooperation with trusted\nde-mining  companies  like  Cambodian  Mine  Action  Center,  Mine  Advisory  Group,  and  Halo  Trust.\nMost  of  them  use  participatory  approaches  and  their  target  population  is  the  poor  and  very  poor,\nreturnees, the internally displaced, war widows, female heads of households, disabled persons, and\nmine victims.\n\n                                                \n 3  ADB. 1999.

This program was\n19.\nrecently  evaluated  and  is  considered  successful,  functioning  without  external  capital  injections  and\nallowing the small groups to grow slowly and according to their own capacities.  Many NGOs operate\nthrough the VDCs and respond to the prioritized needs that were identified in the local participatory\nplanning  approach.  Some  of  them,  however,  cross-check  the  priority  needs,  because  there  are\nreservations  regarding  the  extent  to  which  the  very  poor,  the  poor,  and  women  have  participated  in\nthe  planning  exercises.  The  NGOs  provide  skills  training;  education,  health,  family  planning,  water\nand sanitation services; and training for HIV/AIDS4 awareness or mine awareness.\n\n6.      Gender Issues\n\n \n 20. Women  form  the  majority  of  the  working  age  population  in  the  project  area  (51.4  percent).\nGenerally,  the  Khmer  system  regarding  property  ownership  and  inheritance  is  rather  bilateral,  and\nwomen and men have equal rights. In practice, the norms have been moderated by tradition and an\nenvironment  that  values  men  more  than  women  exists.  Women\u2019s  role  still  tends  to  be  that  of  being\n\n                                                \n4   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodefficiency syndrome.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 2, page 6\n\n\u201cgood wives\u201d which means being submissive and docile, and assuming household duties. In reality,\nwomen have become primary income earners in many households and started undertaking activities\nand  assuming  roles  in  the  communities  previously  assigned  to  men.  However,  their  role  in  decision\nmaking  at  the  village,  commune,  district  or  higher  levels  is  severely  restricted.  Even  if  women  are\nmembers of the VDCs (30 percent is mandatory), they do not speak out. Poor and very poor women\ncannot  afford  to  attend  meetings  due  to  their  numerous  chores  in  managing  the  household  and\nearning a livelihood.\n \n 21.\nIn the household, women have a stronger position in decision making. They are in charge of\nthe family\u2019s cash; this, however, is a burden in those households where scarce resources have to be\nmanaged.  Larger  economic  transactions  are  executed  by  the  husband,  but  he  usually  gets  the\nconsent of his wife. Land clearing, cutting timber, plowing, constructing the house, and tending large\nlivestock are men\u2019s tasks. Women are responsible for nursing and tending the young, the old, and the\nsick. They do the household chores, replenish water, and fetch firewood.  In agriculture, Cambodian\nwomen  share  in  land  preparation,  and  do  the  planting,  transplanting,  weeding  and  harvesting,\nselecting seeds and storing them. They thresh and mill grain.\n\nC.\n\nThe Project\u2019s Poverty and Social Strategy\n\n22.\nThe  overall  project  approach  to  addressing  social  and  poverty  issues  include  (i)  improving\nremote  rural  villages\u2019  access  to  transport  and  social  infrastructure  through  the  construction  of  rural\nroads  and  small  rural  infrastructure;  (ii)  applying  a  sequential  approach  wherein  the  poor  and  very\npoor population\u2019s rights to land along the roads are assured prior to road improvements; (iii) providing\ncapacity  building  for  all  levels  of  stakeholders  to  assure    inclusive  participation  in  project  planning,\nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation; (iv) targeting the poor and very poor for employment and\nadequate payment in labor-intensive construction to close the food security gap; and (v) introducing a\nsavings and credit scheme that is appropriate and adjusted to the poor population\u2019s needs. Effects of\nroad  improvements  on  the  population  and  mitigation  measures  were  incorporated  into  the  project\ndesign (Table A2.3).\n\nTable A2.3: Road Improvements, Their Effects on the Population\n and Mitigation Measures\n\nAssumed Negative Effects\n\nfor  village  population \nto  higher  dust \n\nHealth  hazard \nincreased  due \n(laterite surface).\nHigher  speed  of  vehicles  may  lead  to  more\naccidents.\n\nis\nincidence\n\nThe  value  of  land  along  the  improved  roads\nand the risks of land conflicts will increase.\n\nOpening  up  of  areas  will  increase  access  to\nmine  areas,  resulting  in  further  clearing  of\nland, which will be done especially by the poor\nand very poor.\n\nincluding \n\napproach, \n\nMitigation Measures\nAlternative  surfaces  (e.g.,  bamboo-concrete)  currently\nexperimented  in  Cambodia  will  be  used  in  settlement\nareas. Speed breakers in villages will reduce dust.\nRoad  safety  campaigns  will  be  held, \ntargeting\nespecially children; speed reducing measures in settled\nareas will be applied.\nA \nidentifying\nsequential \nbeneficiaries,  land  use  planning,  land  titling,  and  de-\nmining, will be used to assure land titling prior to road\nimprovements.\nAs  the  Project  will  provide  alternative  incomes  to  the\npoor  and  very  poor,  the  pressure  to  clear  land  or  to\ncollect timber and nontimber products will be reduced,\nthus the danger of exposure to mined land.\nMine  awareness  campaigns  will  be \nintensified,\ntargeting  children  to  deter  them  from  tampering  with\nunknown  objects.  Public  land  around  improved  or\nnewly  built  social  infrastructure  will  be  de-mined,\npathways to newly built infrastructure will be de-mined\nand marked to allow safe access.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 2, page 7\n\n23.\nStakeholder  Participation.  The  Project  was  prepared  with  the  extensive  participation  of\nstakeholders  at  all  levels,  including  beneficiaries.  Project  implementation  will  address  the  direct\nparticipation  of  villagers  by  (i)  using  local-level  planning  and  the  already  existing  prioritized  village\ndevelopment  plans,  but  thoroughly  rechecking  the  poor  and  very  poor  population\u2019s  consent  and\npriority  needs,  with  women  being  separately  met  to  make  sure  their  voices  are  considered;  and  (ii)\nbuilding  capacity  and  increasing  the  VDCs\u2019  and  commune,  district,  and  province  authorities\u2019\nunderstanding of participation and empowerment.\n\n24.\nSecurity of Land Tenure. The Project will start road improvements only after the beneficiaries\nalong  the  road  alignments  have  been  identified,  registered,  and  received  land  titles.  The  Ministry  of\nLand Management will be responsible for this, supported by the Project. Mechanisms already existing\nin  two  and,  until  the  end  of  the  year,  three  provinces,  the  land  use  planning  units/land  use\nmanagement units will also be supported by the Project to assure participatory processes.\n\n25.\nGender Strategy. The Project will take women\u2019s roles into consideration. Women are primary\nincome  earners;  users  of  the  infrastructure,  especially  the  social  infrastructure;  and  key  persons  to\nmanage the family budget. The strategy to address their needs, constraints, and participation includes\n(i) women-only discussion and planning groups to allow them to speak freely; (ii) timing the training,\ndiscussions, and planning sessions according to women\u2019s availability; (iii) providing functional literacy\nand particularly numeric literacy training for women; (iv) support and training to women members of\nVDCs  to  allow  full  participation  in  village  meetings;  (v)  specific  awareness  campaigns  for  men  and\nwomen  on  joint  registration  and  land  titling  (the  target  is  to  achieve  75  percent  joint  land  titles);  (vi)\ninformation  and  awareness-raising  campaigns  using  women  as  specific  information  channels;  and\n(vii) targeting women particularly for the savings and credit groups (at present already 75-80 percent\nof  women  are  reached  in  similar  schemes).  All  activities  will  be  done  in  close  cooperation  with  the\nprovincial and district personnel of the Ministry of Women\u2019s and Veterans\u2019 Affairs. The four community\ndevelopment  specialists  under  the  Project  will  coordinate  and  supervise  the  implementation  of  the\nstrategy.\n\n26.\nProject  Management  Support.  The  Project  will  provide  four  community  development\nspecialists,  one  to  each  province  to  support  project  implementation  and  ensure  participatory\napproaches are used and the poor and the very poor are involved. Two of the four specialists will be\nwomen.  All  four  will  be  gender-sensitive  and  have  specific  qualifications  for  gender  analysis  and\ngender-sensitive  approaches  in  community  development.  The  labor  inspectors  will  ensure  that  poor\npeople have access to information on employment and are given preference for employment in labor-\nintensive  road  construction  and  for  the  required  training.  Community-based  participatory  monitoring\nwill be carried out, using simple indicators identified by the community (Table A2. 2).\n\n\fProject Name\nGrant Assistance\nLabor-Based Rural Infrastructure\nProgram -

Many of the markets in the project area are in poor condition, and lacking\nproper  drainage,  provisions  for  garbage  collection,  or  sanitary  blocks  and  water  supply.  No\nselection has yet been made as the development of a market hierarchy in the project area is still\nat the very early stages. Identification and selection can only take place after the rehabilitation of\nthe  rural  roads  because  transport  infrastructure  supports  the  function  of  a  market  and\ncontributes  to  justifying  the  investment.  The  impact  of  different  types  of  markets  on  poverty\nreduction has to be considered as well. A screening and appraisal process will be needed prior\nto any decision.\n\nB.\n\nRationale\n\n2.\nSince  the  NRDP  aims  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  four  northwestern\nprovinces,  the  project  activities  include  upgrading  the  local  rural  markets.  These  are  basic\nproducer  markets  with  producers  directly  selling  small  quantities  of  perishable  and\nnonperishable  products  to  either  local  traders  or  to  local  consumers.  These  markets  also\nfacilitate farmers\u2019 diversification into vegetables, fruit, and small livestock as they provide outlets\nfor such products. A focus on this kind of market will therefore have a greater impact on poor\nfarmers  in  the  project  area.  Rehabilitating  of  such  markets  will  (i)  increase  the  physical\ncapacities  of  the  markets;  (ii)  improve  marketing  conditions  for  fresh  produce,  fish,  and\nlivestock; (iii) reduce losses of goods; and (iv) improve hygiene by providing water and latrines.\n\nC.\n\nMarket Selection Criteria\n\n3.\nMarkets  will  be  selected  using  the  following  criteria:  (i)  transport  infrastructure\nimprovement exists (including roads to be rehabilitated by the Project); (ii) efficiency and public\nhealth conditions are seriously limited; (iii) substantial level of trade in fresh produce exists (at\nleast 30 percent traders are farmer-sellers); (iv) a formal agreement with the relevant authorities\nstates that upgrading will be implemented through established market management committees\n(including  wholesalers,  retailers,  farmer-sellers,  and  local  authority  representative)  that  will\nsubsequently manage the upgraded market so as to ensure sustainability and cost recovery; (v)\npriority is given to upgrading the existing markets owned by the local government, and only in\nexceptional  and  justifiable  circumstances  will  the  development  of  a  new  market  site  be\nconsidered;  and  (vi)  a  socioeconomic  study  has  been  undertaken  and  comprises  a  rapid\nassessment  of  social  conditions,  including  potential  beneficiaries  of  improvements,  potential\nnegative impact on poor groups of farmers-sellers, an estimate of the number of settlers staying\non the market premises, and a rapid assessment of the financial and economic viability of the\nmarket, and cost recovery expectations.\n\nD.\n\nExpected Scope of Resettlement\n\n4.\nThe Appraisal Mission has rapidly assessed the scope of resettlement. Determining the\nexact number of people settling on the market premises has been difficult since in the absence\nof  proper  fencing,  alignments,  or  concrete  surfaces,  market  boundaries  are  often  not\nestablished  and  trading  activities  spill  over  to  adjacent  areas.  It  has  been  found  that\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\noccasionally  such  cases  occur  in  the  project  area.1  Those  people  will  be  affected  by  any\nplanned  market  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  and  will  need  to  be  resettled.  The  number  of\naffected  people  is  estimated  to  be  about  two  families  per  market.  In  accordance  with  Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) involuntary resettlement policy such resettlement is not significant\nand  does  not  require  a  full  resettlement  plan.  In  cases  where  a  limited  number  of  settlers  is\nidentified as residing within market boundaries, ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy calls for a\nshort resettlement plan to be prepared.\n\nD.\n\nShort Resettlement Plan\n\n5.\nAt  present  there  is  no  legally  documented  resettlement  policy  in  Cambodia.  But  the\nGovernment recognizes that regardless of legal status, negatively affected settlers are entitled\nto compensation.\n\n6.\nThe  main  principles  of  the  resettlement  plan  follows:  (i)  minimize  negative  impacts  as\nmuch  as  possible;  (ii)  carry  out  resettlement  and  compensation  so  as  to  improve  or  at  least\nrestore the preproject living standards of the affected people; (iii) fully inform and consult closely\nwith  affected  people  on  compensation  options  and  resettlement  plan  design;  and  (iv)  provide\nasset compensation at replacement rates. The disbursement for each market to be rehabilitated\nwill be subject to ADB\u2019s approval of the socioeconomic feasibility study. A loan covenant makes\nthe start of civil works conditional on satisfactory implementation of the resettlement plan.\n\n7.\nThe  resettlement  plan  should  contain  the  following  parts:  (i)  description  of  the\nsocioeconomic conditions of the affected people; (ii) discussion with potential affected people to\ninform  the  market  rehabilitation  and  the  need  for  relocation;  and  (iii)  information  for  affected\npeople about resettlement/compensation options. Attempts will be made during detailed design\nto  avoid  or  minimize  adverse  social  impacts  on  the  settlers.  Wherever  possible,  market\nboundaries will be adjusted in a way that settlers do not need to be relocated.\n\n8.\nCompensation  will  be  at  replacement  value  for  lost  assets.  Transportation  and  a\nsubsistence  allowance  will  be  paid  to  cover  any  loss  of  income  during  the  resettling  period.  A\nmaximum  transport  allowance  estimated  at  $40  per  household  or  assistance  in  kind  will  be\nprovided.  The  subsistence  allowance  is  estimated  at  $50  per  household.  All  unit  prices  for\ncompensation will be fixed before payment of compensation.\n\n9.\nThe  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  and  representatives  from  a  nongovernment\norganization (NGO) working in the project area will monitor resettlement plan implementation as\npart  of  their  regular  monitoring  activities.  Grievance  may  be  expressed  to  this  NGO  and  the\nconcerns  raised  will  be  included  in  the  monitoring  report.  The  international  community\ndevelopment  specialist  will  assist  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  the  PIUs  in\npreparing,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  resettlement  plan  implementation.  ADB  review  missions\nwill  monitor  the  issue.  Evaluation  of  resettlement  plan  implementation  will  be  part  of  PMU\u2019s\nregular reports to be submitted to ADB.\n\nResettlement  activities  will  commence  at  the  earliest  in  2004.  The  PMU  will  provide\n10.\ntimely  implementation  schedules  that  indicate  resettlement  activities  as  they  relate  to  the  civil\nworks for market improvement on a case-by-case basis.\n\n                                                          \n1 This has been confirmed by a socioeconomic study conducted for ADB Loan 1385-CAM(SF): Rural Infrastructure\nImprovement Project , for $ 25.1 million, approved on  28 September 1995, where in 6 out of 12 markets studied,  a\nlimited number of settlers were found  within the market boundaries.\n\n\fIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n\n2002/03\n\n2003/04\n\n2004/05\n\n2005/06\n\n2006/07\n\nRainy\n\nDry\n\nRainy\n\nDry\n\nRainy\n\nDry\n\nRainy\n\nDry\n\nRainy\n\nDry\n\nPreparatory Phase\n\n1.

The  rural  poor  are  heavily  handicapped  in  terms  of  (i)  land\nownership,  housing,  and  other  productive  assets;  (ii)  access  to  basic  social  services  such  as\nhealth, education, water supply, and sanitation; and (iii) access to financial services. Decades of\ninternal  armed  conflict,  low  agricultural  productivity,  high  indebtedness,  and  isolation  due  to\nseverely  degraded  access  roads  are  often  cited  as  causes  of  poverty  in  the  rural  areas.  The\nproject area shares all these characteristics.\n\n2.\nThe  northwestern  provinces  also  have  many  internally  displaced  persons  who  have\nelected to settle there after years of voluntary and forced exile as refugees in Thailand. This is\nalso  an  area  where  informally  demobilized  soldiers  have  settled,  close  to  their  former  units.\nSome  internal  migration  to  these  relatively  land-rich  provinces  by  families  originally  from  the\nsouth  and  east  also  occurs  despite  the  widespread  danger  of  unexploded  ordnance.  Years  of\ncivil  unrest  throughout  the  northwestern  provinces  have  had  a  severe  impact  on  the  human\ncapital of the area as well as on the physical infrastructure. Consequently, the basic minimum\nneeds  of  communities  are  not  satisfied  and  the  incidence  of  food  insecurity  averages  three\nmonths each year. The survival strategies adopted by households during the extended periods\nof  conflict,  particularly  in  the  northwestern  provinces,  have  also  resulted  in  unsustainable\nincome-generating activities from the exploitation of natural resources, to the extent that these\nare now significantly depleted.\n\nThe  Government's  major  objectives  are  to  establish  the  rule  of  law,  ensure  economic\n3.\nstabilization with structural reform, strengthen capacity building, initiate protection of the natural\nenvironment,  and  foster  the  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  physical  infrastructure  and\nfacilities. The aim is to integrate Cambodia's economy into regional and world economies in a\nsustainable manner. The Government's poverty reduction strategy has three elements:\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\ndecentralization  and  promotion  of  community  participation  in  project  selection,\ndesign,  and  implementation  to  increase  the  efficiency  and  equity  of  rural\ndevelopment interventions;\nimprovement  of  agricultural  productivity,  notably  through  greater  public  investment\nin  rural  infrastructure  and  establishment  of  rural  financial  services,  to  enhance  the\nincomes of the rural poor; and\npromotion  of  access  to  affordable  rural  social  services,  particularly  for  women  and\nvulnerable groups.\n\nThe  Project  is  built  around  these  objectives  and  strategic  elements,  and  its  overall  evaluation\nmust be made in the context of the well-documented fundamental needs of the project area.\n\nA. \n\nAssumptions on Project Costs\n\nThe  detailed  costs  were  prepared  according  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)\n4.\nstandards  using  the  COSTAB  software  package.  All  costs  were  denominated  in  2001  US\ndollars. The individual costs were based on either field inquiries in 2001 or interpolations from\nprior  studies,  adjusted  by  appropriate  currency  conversion  and  inflation  series.  An  exchange\nrate  of  KR3,850  per  dollar  was  assumed  for  current  costs.  Physical  contingencies  were\nestimated  for  individual  items  based  on  Mission  estimates,  other  ADB  project  data,  and  data\ncontained  in  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)  Appraisal  Report-\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nAgricultural Development Support to Seila.1 International price contingencies were based on the\nWorld  Bank's  Commodity  Outlook.  Local  inflation  was  estimated  from  data  supplied  by  the\nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (3.5  percent  per  year,  2002-2006).  Taxes  and  duties  were\napplied at rates supplied by the ministry and are netted out of the economic analysis.\n\nB. \n\nExpected Impact of the Main Components\n\n1.\n\nCapacity Building\n\nrecognizes \n\nis  extensive  and \n\nThe  proposed  capacity-building  component \n\n5.\nthat\ncommunities in the project area have been badly affected by civil disruption and are therefore\nless familiar with participatory development processes than rural communities in other parts of\nthe  country.  The  component  supports  the  government  policy  to  promote  the  empowerment  of\ncommunities through decentralized planning. While a start has already been made through the\nSeila  process  of  preparing  commune  investment  plans,  both  technical  and  awareness  training\nare required at the community and government agency levels. In view of the limited resources\navailable  to  the  Government  to  achieve  the  participatory  approach,  much  of  the  capacity\nbuilding  will  be  delivered  through  the  services  of  a  suitably  qualified  nongovernment\norganization  (NGO)  under  a  service  contract  agreement  with  the  Project.  The  benefits  of  the\nproposed  comprehensive  and  integrated  program  of  technical  assistance  are  expected  to\nfocusing  of\nprovide  widespread  and  sustainable  benefits \ndevelopment investment, harnessing of community participation, and strengthening of capacity\nat the grassroots.\n\nthe  more  effective \n\nthrough \n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MRD)  and  its  provincial\n6.\ndepartments  to  upgrade  infrastructure  planning  and  implementation  skills.  There  are  obvious\nneeds  for  technical  training  in  a  wide  range  of  skills  (e.g.,  engineering  survey  and  design,\nproject  management,  supervision  and  evaluation,  accessibility  mapping  and  infrastructure\nallocation,  computer  training,  etc.).  The  Project  will  address  these  needs  within  both  the\nprovincial  departments  of  rural  development  (PDRD)  and  the  private  sector.  The  proposed\nassistance  for  developing  the  capabilities  of  the  local  contracting  and  consulting  industries  is\nalso expected to provide immediately tangible and long-term sustainable benefits. The Project\nwill  provide  much-needed  technical  support  and  training  in  maintenance  procedures  to  the\nPDRD  rural  roads  office,  which  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  supervision,  and  to  the\ndistrict road maintenance committees.\n\n2.\n\nLarge-Scale Infrastructure\n\n7.\nThe Project includes the construction of an estimated 613 kilometers (km) of rural roads\nat  an  estimated  capital  cost  of  $15,000  per  km,  or  an  estimated  total  cost  of  $9,195,000.  The\nestimated average capital cost is based on substantial experience gained during the upstream\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO) technical assistance (TA) to MRD for the Labor-Based\nInfrastructure Works Program. The exact length of roads to be built cannot be determined at this\nstage  as  all  proposals  will  be  screened,  and  possibly  revised  or  rescheduled,  following  full\nevaluation  using  the  integrated  rural  accessibility  planning  (IRAP).  However,  the  total  is  not\nexpected  to  differ  substantially  from  the  initial  estimate.  In  addition,  approximately  $9,800,000\n\n                  \n\n1    Seila,  (a  Khmer  word  meaning  foundation  stone)  originated  as  UNDP\u2019s  Cambodian  Area  Rehabilitation  and\nRegeneration  Project.  With  the  continued  support  of  UNDP  and  other  aid  agencies,  Seila  has  evolved  into  a\nnational  program  operating  in  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  Pursat,  Siem  Reap,  Oddar  Meanchey,  and\nRatanakiri provinces.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nhas  been  allocated  for  construction  of  provincial  and  district  infrastructure  and  facilities  (e.g.,\nhealth facilities, schools, and markets) and strategic maintenance of roads. The need for such\nfacilities is readily apparent and the planning process is essentially one of ranking and rationing.\n\nThe  ILO-TA  has  established  that  significant  effects  stem  from  rehabilitating  or\n8.\nreconstructing  rural  roads  that  are  otherwise  impassable  in  the  wet  season.  These  include\nincreases  in  cropping  intensities  and  yields  (resulting  from  improved  access  to  markets  and\nagricultural  inputs),  and  the  growth  and  diversification  of  trade  and  traffic.  There  are  certainly\nalso  less  tangible  but  important  benefits  from  exposing  the  rural  population  to  new  ideas  and\nsources of information. Consistent with the reconstruction of the economy as a whole, there is a\nsense  that  rural  areas  are  ripe  for  rejuvenation  and  modernization,  given  the  provision  of\nappropriate  transport  links.  The  use  of  labor-based  appropriate  technology  (LBAT)  will  also\ngenerate an estimated 2,000 days of employment per km of road. The road component of the\nProject has been subjected to a full economic analysis (paras. 12-22).\n\n3.\n\nLivelihoods Enhancement\n\n9.\nThe livelihoods enhancement component will stimulate economic activity at all levels of\nthe local economy: the province, district, commune, and village. The mechanisms through which\nthis may be achieved vary at each level\u2013an informal savings and credit program at the village\nand  commune  levels,  and  formal  credit  access  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels.  These\nelements will be combined within an integrated strategy. Agency staff will be provided with on-\nthe-job  training  through  NGO  contracts  to  improve  participatory  processes  at  the  village  and\ncommune  levels.  At  the  village  and  commune  level,  savings  and  credit  groups  will  be\nestablished, and provincial and district staff will receive training in credit planning and delivery.\nCommunities  will  be  made  aware  of  linkages  between  the  formal  and  informal  credit  markets,\nand credit group members will be trained in such basic areas as cash management, accounting,\nmanagement,  and  group  leadership.  The  overall  benefits  of  the  component  will  include  the\ndevelopment  of  the  savings  discipline  in  communities,  encouragement  of  community  and\nindividual  initiative,  fostering  of  private  sector  development  and  household  income-generating\nactivities, boosting of new productive capacity, and creation of new job and work opportunities.\n\nThe  Project  will  also  fund  small-scale  village  facilities  such  as  crop  drying  and  storage\n10.\nfacilities,  and  multipurpose  community  buildings.  The  benefits  of  such  investments  in  such\nfundamentally  deprived  communities  will  undoubtedly  be  substantial.  These  pro-poor\ninvestments will be established through a participatory process undertaken with the assistance\nof  community  development  specialists  during  implementation.  There  is  also  a  special  case  for\nthe  provision  of  small  bridges,  culverts,  and  drifts  in  Oddar  Meanchey  Province  in  view  of  its\nvery  low  level  of  development  and  the  small  number  of  international  and  local  agencies\nproviding  support.  Poor  roads  and  lack  of  access  during  the  wet  season  are  hindering\ndevelopment efforts and leading to depopulation of some areas.\n\n11.\nVillagers  have  identified  water  supplies  as  priority  investments  and  the  project  will\nprovide funds for establishing both hand-dug ring-wells and mechanically dug boreholes (up to a\ndepth  of  80  meters).  These  wells  will  be  fitted  with  hand  pumps  if  requested  by  communities.\nUser groups will be formed for each well and will be expected to raise funds for maintenance.\nTwo  or  three  group  members  will  be  trained  to  maintain  the  pump  and  an  initial  set  of  basic\nspare  parts  will  be  provided  together  with  training  in  health  education  to  improve  hygiene  and\nencourage  the  construction  of  latrines.  Again  the  benefits  of  initiatives  of  this  type  are\nincontrovertible  in  the  case  of  communities  that  are  both  very  poor  and  have  experienced\nmassive social dislocation. The Project will also assist in establishing small local businesses to\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nproduce the squatting slabs for pit latrines and, possibly, concrete rings. Interested villagers will\nbe  provided  with  the  necessary  technical  training,  assisted  to  identify  the  nearest  sources  of\nsupplies, and assisted to access credit.\n\nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n12.\nEconomic  analysis  was  limited  to  measuring  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the  rural  road\ncomponent  and  the  microfinance  component.  Benefits  from  the  capacity-building  component\nand  the  small-scale  village  infrastructure,  while  expected  to  be  significant,  were  not  included\nbecause of the difficulty in quantifying the benefits. In all of the following, prices are expressed\nin the world price numeraire.\n\nThe benefits of the road component were assessed at two levels: (i) expected increase\n13.\nin agricultural production surplus (APS), and (ii) reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOC) and\nvalue of time saved.\n\n1.\n\nAgricultural Production Surplus\n\n14.\nIn  the  first  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (1996-2000),  the  Government  aimed  to\nachieve  food  security  through  a  gradual  increase  in  rice  productivity.  It  was  estimated  that\nduring the last five years, the country achieved a surplus in rice production every year ranging\nbetween  100,000  tons  and  250,000  tons,  or  an  average  of  about  8  percent  of  the  total\nproduction.2 The Government also lifted a ban on rice exports in December 1995, and opened\nexternal  markets  for  the  Cambodian  rice  exports.  In  2000,  the  volume  of  the  rice  export  was\nabout  120,000  tons  which  is  still  about  a  quarter  of  the  volume  of  rice  exports  in  the  1970s\nbefore the long civil war.\n\n15.\nAs in other regions of Cambodia, agriculture in the project area is characterized by rainfed\nlowland agriculture with a large number of small farm households. There are good potentials for\nan  increase  in  yield  and  cropping  intensity  in  areas  with  medium  to  high  soil  productivity,\nparticularly in the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap. With the provision of market support\ninfrastructure  such  as  rural  roads  and  market  facilities,  a  gradual  increase  is  expected  in\nincremental  agricultural  production,  primarily  rice  production  for  both  domestic  and  external\nmarkets.  According  to  the  current  commune  database  data  and  project  preparatory  technical\nassistance (TA) survey data, households in the project area are at present engaged primarily in\nsubsistence  agriculture,  and  trade  surpluses  are  still  negligible.  There  is  a  small  surplus\nbetween  paddy  output  (57,878  tons  in  1999)  and  paddy  consumption  (57,678  tons).  The\nanalysis  was  restricted  to  the  development  and  marketing  of  surplus  paddy.3  Furthermore,\nbecause  in  practice  microfinance  loans  in  the  project  area  are  generally  used  for  agricultural\npurposes, separate microfinance benefits are not included to avoid double counting. The costs\nof microfinance outreach financed by the Project are included, however, as they will contribute\nto agricultural productivity increases.\n\n16.\nThe  economic  prices  for  traded  inputs  and  outputs  were  determined  using  the  latest\nWorld Bank commodity prices. Because rice is traded in both directions across the border with\nThailand,  an  arithmetic  mean  of  the  prices  of  rice  of  varying  quality  (the  higher  quality  mainly\n\n                  \n\n2      The  Ministry  of  Planning,  the  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.  March  2001.  The Second Five-Year Socio-\n\nEconomic Development Plan 2001-2005. Chapter 7, Draft. Phnom Penh.\n\n3  The provision of all-weather road access should also advance the development of a wide range of secondary crops\nand  livestock  activities  that  will  lead  to  further  increases  in  farm  incomes.  Restricting  the  analysis  to  paddy\nsurpluses is therefore a conservative approach.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\ntraded  for  export)  was  used  as  a  basis,  adjusted  for  internal  transport,  milling,  and  trading\nmargins. Input prices were estimated in the same manner. The economic prices of nontradable\ngoods  were  based  on  local  price  information,  with  the  application  of  ADB's  current  standard\nconversion  factor  for  Cambodia  (0.90).  A  shadow  wage  rate  of  0.75  was  used  for  farm  and\nunskilled  labor.  The  relative  contributions  of  taxes  and  tradable  and  nontradable  goods  and\nservices to the economic prices of composite goods were determined.\n\n17.\nThe  currently  cultivated  area  is  about  44,000  hectares  (ha),  and  current  yield  using\nsimple production techniques and low-quality seeds is about 1.3 tons of paddy per ha. Using a\n1-ha rice production model, at the current input and output levels (adjusted to economic values),\nthe  gross  margin is $47.44  per ha.  With increased road access, it is assumed that production\nwill  increase  for  several  reasons.  First,  with  lower  costs  to  reach  the  market  due  to  improved\nroads, the net profit to farmers from increased production will increase. Farmers are expected to\nrespond to these price incentives. Second, improved road access will increase farmers\u2019 access\nto improved technology (including improved seeds) and extension services that currently have\ndifficulty reaching them. The public agricultural extension services in the project area are being\nsupported and expanded under the Agricultural Development Support to Seila project financed\nby IFAD, and the Second Cambodia-Australia Agricultural Extension Project. Further expansion\nof outreach in agricultural extension in Battambang Province is being proposed by the European\nUnion and the Government of Japan. With better road access, farmers will increasingly benefit\nfrom improved technology and information provided under these programs.\n\n18.\nData  from  the  IFAD  Agricultural  Development  Support  to  Seila  Project  indicate  that\nproduction per ha with improved technology and seeds can conservatively be expected to reach\n2.1 tons4 (Table A10.1), with a gross margin per ha of $74.46 (indicating an increase in gross\nmargin  of  $74.46  -  $47.44  =  $27.02  per  ha).  The  analysis  assumes  that  the  amount  of  land\nfarmed using new technology will increase gradually, starting with 10 percent of land in year 3,\nand  increasing  by  10  percentage  points  each  year  until  it  reaches  80  percent  in  year  10.\nAdoption  of  the  new  technology  is  then  assumed  to  increase  more  gradually,  reaching  100\npercent of cultivated land in year 15. The analysis also assumes that 1,050 ha of land currently\nnot cultivated will be brought into cultivation as existing farmers expand their cultivated area in\nresponse to price incentives and as new settlers relocate into the project area.\n\nTable A10.1: Current and Potential Farm Gross Margins\n($)\n\nItem\nOutput (tons)\nValue of output ($)\nValue of inputs ($)\nGross margin ($)\nIncrease in gross margin ($)\n\nWithout Project\n\n1.30\n145.16\n97.73\n47.44\n\nWith Project\n2.10\n228.91\n154.45\n74.46\n27.02\n\n19.\nThe road rehabilitation component will benefit about 228,500 people in 263 villages in 31\ncommunes.  They  will  be  distributed  between  10  communes  in  Battambang  Province,  5  in\nBanteay  Meanchey  Province,  7  in  Oddar  Meanchey  Province,  and  9  in  Siem  Reap  Province.\nThe Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct 206 km of road in Battambang, 142 km in Banteay\nMeanchey, 122 km in Oddar Meanchey, and 143 km in Siem Reap. The largest shares of the\nincrease  in  agricultural  surplus  will  occur  in  the  poorer  provinces.  In  the  case  of  Siem  Reap,\n\n4      By  comparison,  in  neighboring  provinces  of  Thailand  output  is  6  tons/ha,  and  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic\n\n                  \n\nRepublic output is 3.1 tons/ha.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\nwhich  has  a  relatively  high  average  per  capita  income  (due  largely  to  the  development  of  the\ntourist industry), the expected output will occur in the most remote areas (in Siem Reap, all-year\nroads to the irrigated areas have already been built).\n\n2.\n\nVehicle Operating Costs and Value of Time Saved\n\nReductions  in  VOC  and  time  traveled  will  be  seen  primarily  in  motorized  vehicles.5\n20.\nFollowing  improvement  in  road  surface  conditions,  VOC  savings  can  be  manifested  by  direct\nreduction  in  carriers'  costs  as  a  result  of  lower  levels  of  wear  and  tear  on  vehicles,  and  fuel\nsavings (which may be passed on to users in the form of fare and freight rate savings). Lower\ncharges  and  costs  can  also  improve  vehicle  utilization  rates  and  additional  benefits  can  come\nfrom  shorter  journey  times  and  shifts  to  less  expensive  modes  of  transport.  The  analysis  was\ndone in two stages. First, reductions in VOC and travel time were calculated for existing motor\nvehicle  traffic  (nonincremental  benefits);  second,  benefits  were  calculated  for  induced  traffic\n(incremental benefits). Calculations were based on data collected during the project preparatory\nTA and by  ILO.6 Table A10.2 presents key data and the calculations of VOC and value of time\ntraveled  without  the  Project.  The  base  data  was  calculated  from  a  representative  survey  that\nwas extrapolated to the project area. In calculating the value of time traveled, two adjustments\nwere  made  to  the  wage  rate.  First,  a  conversion  factor  of  0.75  was  used  to  convert  the  daily\nwage of $1 to an economic value of $0.75. Second, because surveys have shown that people\ngenerally  value  their  travel  time  at  25-45  percent  of  their  wage,  the  value  of  travel  time  was\ntaken to be 30 percent of the shadow wage rate of $0.75, or $0.23.\n\nTable A10.2: VOC and Value of Time Traveled Without Project\n\nItem\n\nMotorbike\n\nCar\n\nPickup\n\nKoyun\n\nTruck\n\nVehicle trips/week\nAverage time/trip (min)\nAverage distance/trip (km)\nPassengers/vehicle/trip\nRoad use (weeks/year)\nTotal travel time/year (person-days)\nWage/day (economic cost, $)\nValue 1-day travel time (30% of\n\nwage, $)\n\n50,416\n84\n21.10\n3\n35\n837,725\n0.75\n0.23\n\nMotor\nTrailer\n130\n60\n9.92\n2\n35\n1,301\n0.75\n0.23\n\n398\n228\n56.90\n9\n35\n56,115\n0.75\n0.23\n\n5,413\n202\n50.45\n12\n35\n915,918\n0.75\n0.23\n\nValue yearly travel time ($)\nVOC ($/km)\nVOC ($)\nkm = kilometers, Koyun = small-size tractor,  min = minutes, VOC = vehicle operating cost.\n\n188,488\n0.07\n2,749,748\n\n12,626\n0.06\n50,979\n\n293\n0.10\n4,585\n\n206,082\n0.15\n1,409,813\n\n1,552\n148\n12.35\n14\n35\n226,422\n0.75\n0.23\n\n       1,441\n274\n68.43\n              5\n35\n    138,060\n0.75\n         0.23\n\n50,945\n0.24\n161,394\n\n      31,063\n0.36\n1,227,039\n\n21.\nCalculating the reduction in VOC due to improved roads is an imprecise science at best.\nHowever,  some  indications  given  by  the  World  Bank  1994  study  show  that,  for  every  $1  not\ninvested in road maintenance, VOC increases by $2 to $3. A study in Battambang showed that,\nwhen 10 km of road was rehabilitated, taxi fare for that 10-km route fell from $4.09 to $1.14.

The  analysis  shows  that  all  costs  would  have  to  increase  by  38\npercent, or benefits alone would have to be reduced by 28 percent, to reduce the EIRR to 12\npercent. Only in the two combination scenarios does the EIRR fall below 12 percent. In the case\nin which all benefits are reduced by 20 percent and all costs are increased by 20 percent, the\nEIRR falls marginally below 12 percent, to 10.26 percent. Clearly, the worst case scenario in the\nproject is if the funding for road maintenance does not materialize as programmed. If funding is\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 10, page 8\n\nonly 50 percent of the planned, it is projected that benefits will fall substantially and reduce the\nEIRR to 7.17 percent.\n\nTable A10.4: Calculation of EIRR\u2014Base Case ($)\n\nYear\n\nCost\n\n Road and\nMicrofinance\nCosts\n\n Travel Time\n Savings\n\n VOC\nSavings\n\n Net Benefits\n\nBenefits\n\n Agricultural\nProducers\nSurplus\n\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n\n0\n3,440,932\n4,173,605\n3,790,679\n343,348\n731,745\n830,970\n754,425\n193,095\n731,745\n830,970\n754,425\n193,095\n731,745\n830,970\n754,425\n193,095\n731,745\n830,970\n754,425\n\nItem\nBase case\nAgricultural producers surplus\nVOC and time savings\nAll benefits\nAll costs\nDelay in Benefits\nCombination 1:\nAll benefits\nAll costs\nCombination 2:\nFunding of maintenance costs\nAll benefits years 2-5\nAll benefits years 6 onward\n\n0\n435,976\n952,263\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n1,406,596\n\nEIRR (%)\n19.79\n17.82\n16.37\n14.25\n15.21\n12.67\n\n10.26\n\n7.17\n\n0\n85,644\n187,063\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n276,313\n\nChange\n0\n-20%\n-20%\n-20%\n+20%\n2 years\n\n-20\n+20\n\n-50%\n-30%\n-50%\n\n0\n0\n35,792\n143,413\n371,072\n600,271\n831,010\n1,063,290\n1,297,110\n1,531,497\n1,728,714\n1,850,454\n1,886,976\n1,960,020\n2,118,283\n2,191,327\n2,313,068\n2,313,068\n2,313,068\n2,313,068\n\n0\n(2,962,911)\n(3,093,712)\n(2,105,016)\n1,569,973\n1,410,775\n1,542,289\n1,851,114\n2,646,264\n2,342,001\n2,439,993\n2,638,278\n3,236,131\n2,770,525\n2,829,562\n2,979,152\n3,662,222\n3,123,572\n3,024,347\n3,100,892\n\nSwitching Value (%)\n-\n-68\n-46\n-28\n+38\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; VOC = vehicle operating cost.\n\nTable A10.5: Results of Economic and Sensitivity Analyses\n\n EIRR\n\n         19.79%\n\n- = not applicable, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, VOC = vehicle operating cost.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 10, page 9\n\nD. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n24.\nThe 1-ha farm model was used to analyze the incentives that farmers have for switching\nto  improved  agricultural  technology  and  increasing  production  once  improved  roads  have\nincreased access to markets.  The financial gross margin per hectare increases by $24.23, from\n$35.67  to  $59.90    (an  increase  of  68  percent).
