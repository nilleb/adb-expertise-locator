It  will \npromote inclusive economic growth in Myanmar and regional cooperation and integration. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic context. Myanmar remains one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, with \nan estimated per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $1,264 (2017). To increase economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty, Myanmar\u2019s transport system needs to be modernized. In particular, \nthe GMS road corridors are the backbone of Myanmar\u2019s transport system. However, the quality \nof  the  infrastructure  along  the  GMS  corridors  is  weak  and  lacks  connectivity\u2014fourteen  million \npeople do not have basic road access in Myanmar. Improving the capacity, safety, and condition \nof the GMS corridors will reduce national transport costs, facilitate access to Myanmar\u2019s remote \nethnic minority areas, and improve regional connectivity, lifting many out of poverty. \n \n4. \nThe NSEC, which links Yangon with Mandalay and the People\u2019s Republic of China, is the \nessential trading route of the country. The EWEC connects Thailand with Yangon and its Thilawa \nSpecial  Economic  Zone  and  then  onward  to  Pathein,  the  capital  of  the  Ayeyarwaddy  Region, \nwhich is one of the poorest regions in Myanmar and most vulnerable to disasters and the impacts \nof climate change. The improvement of the EWEC will also facilitate access to Mon and Kayin \nstates,  which  will  spur  economic  activity  and  demonstrate  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to \nimproving the well-being of people in areas that have long been affected by conflict.1 To spread \nthe  benefits  of  trunk  highway  improvements  to  local  communities,  ADB  has  been  helping  the \ngovernment set up a national rural road strategy,2 and is preparing the proposed Rural Roads \nand Access Project, planned for 2019 approval. ADB estimates that GDP per capita could reach \n$3,500 by 2030, if the Government of Myanmar implements necessary market policies and large \ninfrastructure investments, particularly those aimed at improving Myanmar\u2019s highway network.3\n \n \nNeed to modernize highway network. Demand for road transport has increased quickly \n5. \nsince  2012,  when  the  government  eased  vehicle  import  restrictions.  During  2012\u20132016,  the \nnumber of cars registered in Myanmar increased by 80%, the number of motorcycles increased \nby 145%, and the number of trucks increased by 280%. The sudden increase in road traffic has \nworsened pavement conditions, caused congestion (particularly around Yangon and on the main \n\n                                                \n1   ADB follows a conflict and context-sensitive approach in designing all its projects in Myanmar. Paragraph 29 outlines \n\nhow this project handles conflict sensitivity. \n\n2   Government of Myanmar. 2018. National Rural Roads and Access Strategy. Naypyitaw. \n3  ADB. 2014.

There were about 5,000 road-\nrelated fatalities in 2016, up from 2,173 in 2009.4 \n \n6. \nHowever, the condition of Myanmar\u2019s basic transport infrastructure is poor due to years of \ninadequate  investment  and  lack  of  access  to  modern  technology.  Only  53%  of  the  40,000  km \ntrunk  road  network  managed  by  the  Department  of  Highways  (DOH)  was  paved  as  of  2015. \nPavement  works  were  done  using  outdated,  labor-intensive  methods.  Insufficient  design  and \nquality control have produced rough surfaces that are vulnerable to intense rain events and need \nfrequent maintenance. The main roads are vulnerable to climate events (e.g., typhoons, storm \nsurges, and floods), which are expected to become more frequent and intense in the future. \n \n7. \nHighway improvement priorities. With ADB support, the Ministry of Construction (MOC) \ncompleted  condition  surveys  (2015)  on  27,000  km  of  national  roads,  designed  an  asset \nmanagement  strategy,  and  identified  about  5,000  km  of  priority  roads.  The  MOC  developed  a \nroad  masterplan5  in  2016,  which  prioritized  the  project  highways  for  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement based on strategic alignment with government priorities and the GMS corridors, as \nwell as the economic viability of the proposed works.  \n \n8. \nExpressway  safety  program.  ADB  completed  in  2016  a  strategic  review,  which \nrecommended that the government develop a road safety investment program, improve the safety \nof the Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway, and consider opening it to truck traffic to reduce logistics \ncosts (footnote 4). Road crashes on this expressway killed 280 people during 2014\u20132015, and \ntrucks are banned from using it because the government believes it would be too hazardous. In \n2016,  the  MOC  created  a  road  safety  unit  and  began  safety  improvement  works  on  the \nexpressway. With ADB\u2019s assistance, it developed an expressway safety improvement program \nfor which it requested ADB financing. \n \n9. \nGrade-separated  highway  development.  To  address  long-term  highway  capacity \nneeds,  the  MOC\u2019s  2016  master  plan  also  considered  the  development  of  a  grade-separated \nexpressway network (footnote 5). Eventually, new road alignments will be needed to improve the \nEWEC,  particularly  on  the  Bago\u2013Kyaikto  section.  Upgrading  the  current  alignment  is  not  the \npreferred  solution  because  it  is  too  long  and  winding.  Myanmar  has  limited  experience  with \nmodern engineering design for grade-separated highways and requires international assistance \nto  develop  the  new  highway  project.  The  project  will  be  prepared  in  partnership  with  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. ADB is preparing the project feasibility study under a technical \nassistance project.6 Once the feasibility study is completed, the project will finance the preparation \nof  the  detailed  design.  Financing  for  the  construction  of  the  new  highway  will  be  processed \nseparately  through  the  proposed  Second  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Highway  Modernization \nProject, formerly the GMS EWEC Highway Development Project, planned for 2020 approval. In \nparallel, Japan International Cooperation Agency is considering financing the construction of a \nbridge on the Sittaung River, which is part of the new alignment. \n \n10. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  Since  2012,  transport  has  been  a  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s \nreengagement  strategy  in  Myanmar.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  improving  access  and \nconnectivity to connect rural and urban areas and markets, and to link Myanmar with the regional \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. 2016.

ADB  initially  financed  road  improvement  projects  in  the  Ayeyarwaddy \nRegion  and  along  the  EWEC.7  The  two  projects,  ongoing  as  of  2018,  have  strengthened  the \ngovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  gradually  larger  and  more  complex  projects.  ADB  also \nprepared  a  strategic  review  of  the  sector  in  2016  (footnote  4).  On  this  basis,  the  government \nrequested  that  ADB  prepare  strategies  for  modernizing  important  subsectors  (trunk  roads, \nrailways, rural roads, and urban transport) and finance demonstration projects that improve vital \ninfrastructure and support reforms.8  \n \nThe  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2017\u20132019  for \n11. \nMyanmar9  and  aligns  with  Strategy  2030  (Table  1).10  It  was  designed  with  ADB  assistance  to \naddress trunk road improvement and safety needs on key sections of the GMS corridors,11 in line \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Myanmar, 2017\u20132021.12 The project builds on ADB\u2019s \nexperience  with  road  projects  in  Myanmar,  particularly  in  design  standards,  specifications, \ncontracting  approaches,  and  resettlement  issues.  The  subsequent  Rural  Roads  and  Access \nProject will link poor communities in Ayeyarwaddy and Magway to the project\u2019s and connecting \ntrunk roads.  \n \n\nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \n1.

The project will upgrade at \n13. \nleast 99 km of highway along GMS corridors, primarily the Bago\u2013Thanlyin highway section of the \nEWEC, under this output. The road works will provide a pavement width and an asphalt concrete \npavement  designed  to  meet  future  traffic  growth.  Bridges  that  are  in  poor  condition  or  below \nstandard will be replaced. Some highway sections are vulnerable to flooding and quick pavement \ndeterioration after extreme rain events. To address climate risks, several adaptation measures\u2014\nincreased embankment height, improved pavement surfacing, improved bridges and drains\u2014are \nincluded in the project design. \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Safety of Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway improved. The project will improve \nthe  safety  of  the  Yangon\u2013Mandalay  expressway.  The  65  km  section  from  Hlegu  in  Yangon  to \nBawnetgyi near Bago, which is common to the EWEC and the NSEC, will be improved to enable \nfuture use by trucks. Following the improvements, a community-based road safety program will \nbe carried out to improve the behavior of road users. On the rest of the expressway (about 530 \nkm), the project will mitigate the most serious safety risks attributable to engineering by providing \nsignage and line marking and installing safety barriers at some critical bridge approaches. The \nproject will identify areas prone to frequent crashes and, when feasible, make them safer. \n \n15. \nOutput  3:  Detailed  design  for  other  highway  projects  prepared.  The  project  will \nfinance  consulting  services  to  carry  out  detailed  engineering  design,  safeguard  planning, \nprocurement support, and other studies needed to prepare technically and economically viable \nhighway  projects.  This  will  include  preparation  for  the  improvement  of  the  Yangon\u2013Pathein \nhighway (165 km) and the development of a new highway alignment from Bago to Kyaikto (about \n70 km). ADB has advised the borrower that approval of the financing for the detailed design does \nnot commit ADB to finance a subsequent project. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $202.1  million  (Table  2).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \n16. \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).15 \nTo  finance  the  program,  the  government  has  requested  a  concessional  loan  of  $194.7  million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period \nof 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n                                                \n13 Government of Myanmar, Ministry of Transport and Communications. 2015.

The DOH has established a project management unit (PMU) to handle day-to-day project \nmanagement.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \ndetail in the PAM (footnote 15). The project implementation period is 6 years. \n \n19. \nThe MOC and ADB have taken advance actions to improve project readiness, and ADB \nhas advised the MOC that approval of advance action for consultant recruitment does not commit \nADB to finance the project. The MOC has limited capacity to recruit specialized consultants and \nhas requested that ADB recruit consultants for output 3 to accelerate the schedule.

Pavement structures have been selected to enable a 15-year design life. The underlying \ntraffic  projection  is  based  on  present  traffic  volumes,  with  growth  rates  that  consider  the  likely \nrapid increase in traffic that will occur as Myanmar\u2019s economy continues to develop. \n \n21. \nThe Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway safety improvement output of the project will reduce \nroad safety risks and enable a pilot section to be used by trucks. The works involve paving the \ninner and outer shoulders of the expressway and overlaying the existing rough cement concrete \npavement with asphalt concrete. The expressway\u2019s median will be reshaped, and a rope barrier \nwill  be  added.  Surveys  carried  out  during  project  preparation  confirmed  that  the  current \nexpressway\u2019s concrete pavement had sufficient strength to be used by trucks, except for a few \nweak slabs that will be replaced under the project. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEconomic viability. The project is economically viable. The main benefits of the highway \nimprovement works under output 1 are reduced vehicle operating costs and shorter travel times. \nCompared  with  the  without-project  situation,  highway  widening  will  limit  congestion,  thereby \nreducing travel time. The expressway improvement and safety works will reduce logistics costs \nand decrease the frequency and social cost of road crashes. The overall economic internal rate \nof return of the project is 13.1%.  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nGovernance \n\n \n23. \nFinancial viability. The sustainability of the project highways depends on general budget \nappropriations  for  road  maintenance.  In  2016,  the  Government  of  Myanmar  and  state \ngovernments allocated about $250 million for trunk road maintenance through the DOH. This level \nis  considered  adequate  given  the  size  of  the  network.  Moreover,  to  ensure  long-term  budget \nadequacy, the government plans to set up a road user tax on fuel and earmark this revenue for \nsupporting road investments and maintenance, possibly through a road fund. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  DOH  has  gained  experience  in  implementing  two  ADB-\nfinanced  projects  (footnote  7).  The  PMU  is  headed  by  a  project  director  with  the  rank  of  chief \nengineer. In  parallel  to  the  project,  ADB  will  strengthen the  PMU\u2019s  capacity  in  safeguards  and \nfinancial management through technical assistance. \n \n25. \nFinancial  management.  The  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial \nmainly because of weaknesses in government-wide financial management systems. The DOH \nwill set up a PMU to manage day-to-day activities, including project-specific financial management \ntasks to mitigate the risks. As the DOH is already implementing two other ADB-financed projects, \nit  has  knowledge  and  experience  regarding  ADB  policies  and  procedures  (para.  10).  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM (footnote 15). \n \nD. \n \n26. \nPoverty. The main beneficiaries of the project will be residents of rural areas of Bago and \nYangon regions, users of the Yangon\u2013Mandalay expressway, and passengers and shippers using \nthe GMS EWEC. The rural areas of Bago and Yangon regions are among the poorest areas in \nMyanmar  and  roads  there  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  climate  impacts  (e.g.,  floods  and \ntyphoons). In 2014, 35% of residents of the Yangon Region and 25% of residents of the Bago \nRegion  lived  in  poverty. 16  Poverty  in  rural  areas,  where  township-specific  data  do  not  exist,  is \nhigher. The  Yangon\u2013Mandalay  expressway  has  had  a  poor  safety  record  since  its  opening  in \n2011. This poor safety record has led the government to ban trucks from using the expressway. \nTrucks use the old Yangon\u2013Mandalay parallel highway instead, which is congested and unsafe \nas it passes through many communities. There were 605 road-related fatalities on the old highway \nin 2015. The project will improve the safety of road users and pedestrians and provide stronger \nlinks between the rural and poor regions and the more developed urban hub of Yangon. \n \n27. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  some  gender  elements.  Gender-friendly  elements \ninclude (i) undertaking gender-sensitive community-based programs on road safety, HIV/AIDS, \nand human trafficking; (ii) ensuring that at least 50% of community facilitators in such programs \nare women; and (iii) ensuring that at least 50% of government staff that will be trained under the \nproject will be women. \n \n28. \nHIV/AIDS  and  trafficking.  The  project  will  improve  existing  corridors  and  is  thus  not \nexpected to significantly increase the incidence of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and \nhuman  trafficking.  However,  the  increased  presence  of  road  workers  during  construction  and \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n16 World Bank. 2014. Myanmar\u2014Ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a time of transition: A Systematic \n\nCountry Diagnostic. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fincreased traffic may elevate the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission. Disruption to livelihoods caused \nby the displacement of several shops along the project alignment may increase human trafficking \nrisks as well. To mitigate these risks, the contractors will put in place prevention and assistance \nprograms for their workers, and the project management and contract supervision consultant will \noversee a community awareness program.17 \n \n29. \nConflict sensitivity. The project does not finance anything directly in any of the conflict-\naffected  areas  in  Myanmar.  Within  the  Bago  and  Yangon  regions,  which  have  not  faced  any \nconflicts, the project will  benefit all ethnic groups in a fair, unbiased and equal manner. ADB\u2019s \nongoing  GMS  EWEC  Eindu  to  Kawkareik  Road  Improvement  Project  (Footnote  7)  supports \ndirectly  the  upgrading  of  a  66-km  section  of  the  GMS  EWEC  in  Kayin  state,  which  has  faced \nsignificant conflicts. While the proposed project does not have any components in Kayin state, it \nwill contribute in important ways to conflict resolution in the state. The upgraded Bago\u2013Thanlyin \nhighway section under the project, and the new Bago\u2013Kyaikto highway which will be designed \nunder  the  project  and  considered  for  financing  under  the  proposed  Second  GMS  Highway \nModernization  Project  (planned  2020  approval),  will  become  important  conduits  for  greater \nmobility of people between Kayin, the rest of Myanmar, and regionally. The sequence of projects \nwill ultimately halve the travel times from Kayin state to Yangon and the associated logistics costs. \nThe people of Kayin state could benefit from higher education and specialized health care choices \navailable in the more developed regions of Myanmar. Further, by connecting the EWEC segments \nthat are being upgraded in Kayin state with the rest of country and regionally, there will be greater \ntrade opportunities for Kayin state, which in turn could foster growth, reduce poverty and facilitate \nconflict resolution. \n \nE. \n \n30. \ncategories are as follows.18 \n \n31. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  is  not  expected  to  cause  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  The  MOC  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  report \nfollowing the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Myanmar\u2019s environmental \nimpact  assessment  procedure.  Public  consultation  was  undertaken,  and  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism  has  been  designed  to  address  issues  and  complaints  that  may  arise  during \nconstruction.  The  main  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  on  (i)  air  quality,  water \nquality, and receptors sensitive to noise and dust; (ii) land use and soils; (iii) roadside trees; and \n(iv) worker and community health and safety. The cutting and removal of roadside trees to allow \nfor road widening works and to promote road safety are expected to be a concern for communities \nand  local  governments.  Impacts  will  be  offset  through  replacement  planting  and  tree  aftercare \nprograms developed by the MOC in consultation with Myanmar\u2019s Forest Department. \n \n32. \nThe  MOC  has  prepared  detailed  environmental  management  plans  which  meet  the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and have been incorporated into the project\u2019s \ncivil  works  contract  documentation.  Before  construction  starts,  each  contractor  will  prepare  a \ncontractor  environmental  management  plan  that  will  include  all  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures  and  monitoring  requirements.

The environmental quality monitoring program will monitor the \nimpact of noise and air pollution and assess changes in water quality during construction. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The  highway  improvement  works  will  require \n33. \nland clearance of the corridor of impact, which is fully within the existing rights-of-way. This will \naffect  552  households  and  2,057  persons.  The  inventory  of  losses  survey  estimated  that \n182 households will experience total loss of residential structures and be required to relocate, and \nthat  161  shops  will  be  permanently  displaced.  While  many  people  who  will  lose  residential \nstructures have alternative houses and/or land, at least 67 households are expected to need long-\nterm  resettlement  assistance.  No  land  acquisition  is  expected,  as  all  works  will  be  within  the \nexisting rights-of-way owned by the government. The MOC held consultations with the affected \npeople  during  the  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  which  aims  to  mitigate  all  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  by  providing  compensation  at  replacement  cost  and  assistance  for \nresettlement  and  livelihood  restoration  to  enable  the  affected  people  to  restore  their  living \nstandards. The expressway safety improvement works are not expected to have any involuntary \nresettlement impacts. \n \n34. \nindigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n \n35. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 \n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
