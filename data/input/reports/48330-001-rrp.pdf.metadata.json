In  1996,  the  State  Oil  Company  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic \n(SOCAR)  signed  the  Shah  Deniz  Production  Sharing  Agreement  (SDPSA)  with  six  foreign  oil \nand gas companies led by BP (the operator) for the exploration, development, and production of \nnatural resources from the Shah Deniz gas field. Construction and development of stage I of the \ngas  field  started  in  2003  and  gas  production  commenced  in  December  2006.  In  September \n2013, subsequent to the discovery of a new high-pressure reservoir within the Shah Deniz gas \nfield, gas supply agreements (GSAs) for the stage II expansion of the gas field were signed with \nnine  European  energy  companies.  In  December  2013,  the  SDPSA  partners  announced  their \ninvestment decision for development of stage II of the Shah Deniz gas field. \n \n3. \nPJSC  Lukoil  (Lukoil  or  the  sponsor)  has  a  10%  interest  in  the  SDPSA.  Lukoil \napproached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in June 2014 to partly finance its share of the \ncapital  expenditure  for  the  project.2 From  initial  discussions  between  ADB  and  Lukoil,  ADB \nviewed  that  the  project  possessed  sound  fundamentals,  including  the  financial  strength  of  the \nsponsor,  high-quality  project  preparatory  work,  an  experienced  operator,  and  strong  local \nemployment-generation  potential.  The  project  is  the  largest  gas  field  development  project  to \ndate in Azerbaijan, and will help increase the total gas production in Azerbaijan from 20 bcm per \nannum  in 2014 to  36  bcm  per  annum  by  2022. ADB\u2019s  experience  in  structuring  emerging  and \nfrontier  market  transactions  will  be  crucial  for  the  successful  execution  of  the  project  and  to \ndemonstrate  the  bankability  of  large-scale  financings  for  future  upstream  and  downstream \nprocessing projects in Azerbaijan. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  Shah  Deniz  gas  field  is  a  high-temperature,  high-pressure  gas  field  located \n\n4. \n70 kilometers  (km)  offshore  to  the  southeast  of  Baku,  lying  beneath  water  depths  of                 \n50\u2013500 meters. It has a reservoir thickness of more than 1,000 meters and is 22 km long. The \ngas field contains nine vertically stacked reservoir units, which are targeted for depletion in two \nstages. The gas-initially-in-place estimate for the gas field is 938 bcm.3 Stage I of the gas field \nhas been operational since December 2006.  \n \nStage II development of the Shah Deniz gas field includes the construction of two new \n5. \nbridge-linked  offshore  production  platforms,  26  subsea  wells  drilled  with  two  semi-submersible \nrigs,  500  km  of  subsea  pipelines,  and  expansion  of  the  onshore  gas  processing  terminal  at \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Capital  expenditures  for  the  project  are  funded  by  SDPSA  partners  in  proportion  to  their  percent  interest  in  the \n\n \n\nSDPSA. \n\n3  Gas initially in place refers to the total amount of gas that is potentially in a reserve. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nSangachal. Gas extracted from the stage II development of the gas field will be delivered from \nAzerbaijan to Europe via the separate Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC consists of three \nsections: (i) the South Caucasus Pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Georgia\u2013Turkey border, \n(ii)  the  Trans-Anatolian  Natural  Gas  Pipeline  from  the  Georgia\u2013Turkey  border  to  the  Turkey\u2013\nGreece border, and (iii) the Trans Adriatic Pipeline from the Turkey\u2013Greece border to Italy.  \n \n6. \nThe  SDPSA  sets  the  basic  principles,  rights  and  obligations,  production  sharing,  cost \nreimbursement, and other terms and conditions of the Shah Deniz project. A steering committee \nconsisting  of  an  equal  number  of  members  from  each  SDPSA  partner  is  responsible  for \nmanaging  the  consortium.  BP,  designated  as  the  operator  for  the  project  by  the  SDPSA \npartners,  is responsible for  construction  and  operation  of the  Shah  Deniz gas field.  SOCAR  is \nresponsible  for  entering  into  GSAs  on  behalf  of  the  SDPSA  partners.  The  remaining  SDPSA \npartners,  including  Lukoil,  are  purely  financial  investors  and  are  not  involved  in  day-to-day \noperations of the project. Table 1 lists the composition of the SDPSA. \n \n\nTable 1: Composition of the Shah Deniz Production Sharing Agreement \n\nCompany \nBP \nState Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic \nTurkish Petroleum Overseas Corporation \nPetronas \nLukoil \nNaftiran Intertrade Company \n \n\nTotal  \n\n \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\n28.8 \n16.7 \n19.0 \n15.5 \n10.0 \n10.0 \n100.0 \n\nSource: BP. \n \n7. \nAfter  accounting for  operating  costs  and  capital expenditure, revenues from  the  project \nare  shared  between  the  SDPSA  partners  and  the  Government  of  Azerbaijan  according  to  the \nterms and conditions specified in the SDPSA.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and the Sponsor \n\nThe  borrower  is  LOSD,  a  company  established  with  the  sole  purpose  of  developing \n\n8. \nLukoil\u2019s interest in the Shah Deniz project.  \n \nConfidential information deleted.  \n \nThe  sponsor,  Lukoil,  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  leading  vertically  integrated  oil  and  gas \n9. \ncompanies active in exploration and production of oil and gas, production of petroleum products \nand petrochemicals, and marketing and distribution of these products. Lukoil does not have any \ngovernment  ownership,  and  its  equity  and  depository  receipts  are  traded  publicly  on  the \nFrankfurt,  London,  and  Moscow  stock  exchanges.  As  of  6  July  2015,  Lukoil  had  a  market \ncapitalization of $36.6 billion and a long-term credit rating of BBB\u2013 from Standard & Poor\u2019s. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n10. \nImpacts. The successful development of the stage II expansion of the Shah Deniz gas \nfield,  the  largest  natural  gas  field  in  Azerbaijan,  will  lead  to  the  following  beyond-project \ndevelopment  impacts.  First,  the  overall  Azerbaijan  natural  gas  sector  will  expand  by \nencouraging  foreign  operators  to  develop  similar  gas  reserves  and  will  bring  in  much-needed \ntechnical knowledge, development experience, and foreign capital. Second, the increase in gas \nproduction and opening of the European market to Azerbaijan gas exports will support regional \nintegration  and  diversify  Azerbaijani  exports  of  natural  gas.  Third,  a  successful  experience  of \n\n\fforeign commercial banks financing a large project in Azerbaijan will help increase foreign direct \ninvestment  for  the  development  of  other  upstream  gas  field  development  projects  as  well  as \nmidstream and downstream petrochemical projects, which use natural gas as feedstock. \n \nOutcome. The project will result in successful production of natural gas from stage II of \n11. \nthe Shah Deniz gas field, with first production estimated in 2018 and peak production of 16 bcm \nper annum achieved by 2022.  \n \nOutputs. Successful implementation of the project will result in the environmentally safe \n12. \nand technically sound development of the largest proven gas reserve in Azerbaijan. The project \nis also expected to generate employment for over 16,000 people during 2014\u20132022. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n13. \nConsistency  with  ADB  Strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  two  of \nthe  five  core  areas  of  operations  under  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020:  infrastructure,  and  regional \ncooperation and integration.4 Catalyzing investments by increasing private sector participation is \none of the five strategic drivers of change under Strategy 2020. Following its Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020, ADB is committed to be a provider of catalytic solutions to upper middle-income \ncountries  such  as  Azerbaijan,  which  include  increasing  leveraging  opportunities  with  private \ncapital.5 The  project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018  for \nAzerbaijan,  which  supports  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  development  of  natural  resources  in \ninstances where it would be instrumental in attracting third-party commercial sources of credit.6 \nADB\u2019s presence in such transactions will help these projects adopt international due diligence, \ngovernance, and transparency standards. \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  provides  for  assistance  to  gas  field  development, \nand  transportation  and  distribution  of  gas. 7  The  policy  also  promotes  effective  regional \ncooperation  in  the  energy  sector  to  strengthen  energy  security.  ADB  endorsed  the  Extractive \nIndustries  Transparency  Initiative  (EITI)  in  2008  and  became  a  supporting  organization  to \nenhance revenue transparency in ADB-assisted energy extractive projects. Azerbaijan has been \nan EITI member country since February 2009, and regularly publishes publicly available reports \nwhich disclose revenues earned from the extraction of its natural resources as well as the taxes \nand other payments received from foreign oil and gas companies operating in the country. The \nSDPSA has also been publicly disclosed. \n \n15. \nThe  project  strongly  complements  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  initiatives  in  the  energy  sector  in the \nregion. ADB\u2019s continued intervention in oil and gas in the region will help improve standards of \ncorporate governance and transparency in the sector. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n16. \nIn addition to the initial capital expenditure, development of the stage II expansion of the \nShah  Deniz  gas  field  will  require  ongoing  capital  expenditure  as  new  wells  must  be  drilled  to \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2008.

The overall project is estimated to cost \n$28,590 million.  \n \n17. \nThe above capital expenditure will be separately funded by each of the SDPSA partners \nin proportion to their percent interest in the SDPSA. Lukoil, with its 10% interest in the SDPSA, \nis required to fund $2,859 million of the total project cost.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.8 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework  SOCAR has the authority to carry out exploration and development of all crude oil and \nnatural gas resources in Azerbaijan, including the portion of the Caspian Sea within the \njurisdiction of Azerbaijan. Exploration, development, and production from the Shah Deniz \ngas field is being carried out under the SDPSA. The SDPSA sets the basic principles, rights \nand obligation, production sharing, cost reimbursement, and other terms and conditions for \nthe Shah Deniz project. The current composition of the SDPSA is as follows: BP (28.8%), \nSOCAR (16.7%), Petronas (15.5%), Turkish Petroleum Corporation (19%), PJSC Lukoil \n(10%), and Naftiran Intertrade Company (10%). The SDPSA governs the main \ncompensation and cost recovery mechanism, which compensates the SDPSA operator (BP) \nfor all operating costs. The balance of the production is shared between the Government of \nAzerbaijan and SDPSA partners according to an industry typical R-factor model, which \ncompensates the SDPSA partners at higher levels when capital expenditure is higher. \nThe CUPA governs the sale of gas from the Shah Deniz gas field to the eventual end-use \noff-takers. BP is appointed as the sellers\u2019 representative and agent for the sale of gas to \nAGSC. The shareholder composition of AGSC is similar to that of the SDPSA. For the sale \nof gas from the stage II development of the Shah Deniz gas field, AGSC has entered into \n25-year GSAs for with European buyers and Turkish buyers. AGSC has also entered into \nGSA options with buyers in Azerbaijan and Georgia. In addition, each party to the SDPSA \nhas the right to sell the by-product condensate from the Shah Deniz gas field in proportion to \ntheir shareholding.  \nGas extracted under the project will be delivered to end-use off-takers via the SGC. The \nSGC consists of three sections: the South Caucasus Pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the \nGeorgia\u2013Turkey border, the TANAP from the Georgia\u2013Turkey border to the Turkey\u2013Greece \nborder, and the TAP from the Turkey\u2013Greece border to Italy. AGSC has entered into gas \ntransportation agreements with the South Caucasus Pipeline, the TANAP, and the TAP. The \ngas transportation agreements are coterminous with the GSAs. \n\nOperations \narrangements \nRevenue structure \n\nTransportation \narrangements \n\nImplementation period  Gas production from stage II is expected to commence in 2018, gradually ramping up during \n2018\u20132021 and stabilizing at 16 bcm per annum from 2022 onward. \n \n\nConstruction \narrangements \nEngineering, \nprocurement, and \nconstruction \n\nBP, as SDPSA operator, will construct the main offshore works and will subcontract \nspecialized subsea construction works and onshore construction works to a number of \ncontractors.  \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \n\nBP has been designated as the operator of the project by the SDPSA partners, and will be \nresponsible for operation and maintenance activities. \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \n\nKey performance indicators will be reported by LOSD and monitored by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and other senior lenders. In addition, during the construction phase, the \nsenior lenders will appoint an independent lenders\u2019 technical advisor to monitor progress \nand verify project completion on behalf of the lenders. \n\n                                                 \n8  Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fAGSC  =  Azerbaijan  Gas  Supply  Company,  bcm  =  billion  cubic  meters,  CUPA  =  consolidated  upstream  purchase \nagreement, GSA = gas supply agreement, LOSD = Lukoil Overseas Shah Deniz, SDPSA = Shah Deniz Production \nSharing  Agreement,  SGC  =  Southern  Gas  Corridor,  SOCAR  =  State  Oil  Company  of  the  Azerbaijan  Republic, \nTANAP = Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline, TAP = Trans Adriatic Pipeline. \nSource: BP. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\n19. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n20. \nThe proposed ADB assistance to LOSD to finance its share of the Shah Deniz stage II \ngas field expansion project comprises (i) an A-loan of up to $250 million, and (ii) a B-loan of up \nto $225 million. ADB will fund the A-loan from its ordinary capital resources, while the B-loan will \nbe funded by participating international commercial banks. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n21. \n\nThe proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i) \n\nThe ADB loan will play a leading catalytic role as it facilitates the raising of large-\nscale,  long-term,  commercial  project  financing  from  international  banks,  which \nwill set a precedent for international banks to participate in upcoming projects in \nthe oil and gas sector in the country.  \nADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  transaction  will  further  consolidate  Azerbaijan\u2019s \ncommitment  under  the  EITI  to  improve  corporate  governance  and  transparency \nin the oil and gas sector in the country.  \n \n\n(ii) \n\nC. \n\nRisks \n\n22. \nTimely completion of the Southern Gas Corridor. If all three components of the SGC \nare not constructed and commissioned before project completion, the SDPSA partners will face \nloss in revenue and/or liquidated damages under the GSAs to European and Turkish off-takers.  \n \n23. \nDemand  risk. Overall gas  demand  in  Europe  is  expected  to grow  at  an  average  0.5% \nper  annum  from  2015  to  2027.  While  demand  from  the  residential  sector  is  likely  to  remain \nstable because of the increasing focus on energy efficiency measures, demand from the power \ngeneration sector is expected to grow at 1.4% per annum during 2015\u20132027 as Europe seeks to \nreduce its reliance on coal-fired and nuclear power plants.  \n \n24. \nGas and condensate pricing risk. The US dollar gas sale price in the various GSAs is \nbased on a formula linked to European gas prices at the Italian Punto di Scambio Virtuale (PSV) \nhub and/or Dated Brent crude oil prices. The condensate sale price is linked to the Dated Brent \ncrude  oil  prices.  The  outlook  for  gas  prices  in  2015  remains  negative.  Continued  low  gas  and \ncrude oil prices beyond project completion in 2019 will reduce cash flows from the project.  \n \n25. \nSponsor  risk.  Although  the  recent  drop  in  global  oil  prices  has  affected  the  financial \nperformance of the sponsor, Lukoil\u2019s long-term credit rating remains at investment grade (BBB\u2013) \nand is underpinned by Lukoil\u2019s relatively low leverage, strong liquidity, large resource base, and \nstable profitability.  \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n26. \n \n27. \n \n28. \n \n29. \n \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nConfidential information deleted.  \n\nConfidential information deleted. \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\n30. \nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \ncategory  A  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts  are  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  requirements  for  financing  of  existing  facilities,  an  environmental  and  social \ncompliance  audit  for  the  existing  facilities  of  stage  I  of  the  project  (SD  I)  and  ongoing \nconstruction activities as part of stage II expansion of the gas field (SD II) was carried out. The \naudit did not find any non-compliance of ADB policies associated with the ongoing construction \nactivities.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  the  borrower  to  cause  the  operator  to \nmanage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \nThe borrower will be required to ensure that the operator will comply with national labor \n31. \nlaws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy, will take measures to comply with the \ninternationally  recognized  core  labor  standards.9 The  borrower  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on \nthe compliance of the operator (and its contractors) with such laws.  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n32. \nLOSD was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.
