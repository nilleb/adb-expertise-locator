THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan; (ii) a proposed grant from the Climate Change Fund (CCF); (iii) proposed administration of \na loan from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); and (iv) proposed \nadministration of a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to the Republic of the \nPhilippines for the Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Project.1  \n2.  The project2 will address unsustainable watershed management in four priority river \nbasins: (i) the Chico River Basin in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Northern Luzon; (ii) the \nWahig\u2013Inabanga  River  Basin  on  the  island  of  Bohol;  (iii)  the  Lake  Lanao  Basin  in  the \nAutonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao; and (iv) the Upper Bukidnon River Basin in Bukidnon, \nNorthern  Mindanao.  With  particular  focus  on  indigenous  peoples  and  resource-poor \ncommunities, the project will reduce and reverse degradation of watersheds and associated \nenvironmental services caused by forest denudation and unsustainable farming practices. It will \nalso  provide  incentives  to  local  communities,  local  government  units  (LGUs),  and  the \nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for improving natural resource \nmanagement by generating sufficient and tangible economic benefits. 3 \n3.  The project has been designed as a sector loan4 to support the strategic priorities of the \nPhilippine Development  Plan  (PDP)  and  the  DENR\u2019s  framework  plan  for  environment  and \nnatural resource management in four representative upper river basins (URBs) encompassing \n23 watersheds.5,6 The project will promote the adoption of ecosystem-based management in \nthese URBs; support the rehabilitation, restoration, and protection of degraded forest areas in \nthe component watersheds; and support community-based livelihood measures in 1.13 million \nhectares of upland areas with an estimated population of 2.7 million. Approximately 220,000 \nhousehold beneficiaries in 9 provinces are targeted. The project supports ADB\u2019s commitment to \nenvironmentally sustainable growth and inclusive economic growth under Strategy 2020, and is \nin line with ADB\u2019s operational emphasis on sound environmental management. 7  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n4.  The watersheds of the URBs comprise an estimated 45% of the country\u2019s total land \narea, and are home to one in four Filipinos.8 Natural resources in URBs are the primary source \nfor domestic energy and the local production base. These forest ecosystems play a critical role \nin  economic  development  by  regulating  water  quantity  and  quality  for  sustaining  national \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory assistance. ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila.  \n3  Mechanisms to achieve these project objectives include (i) payments for environmental services including water \nregulation, soil conservation, carbon offsets, and biodiversity; (ii) income generation from sustainable use and \nmanagement and value-added processing of timber and non-timber forest products; (iii) improved natural resource \nproductivity; and (iv) improved climate resilience in project watersheds. \n4  Sector lending is particularly appropriate in this instance as (i) a large number of subprojects are to be financed as \npart of the assistance, and (ii) the assistance is aimed at improving sector policies and institutional capacities. \n5  National Economic and Development Authority. 2011.

Pasig. \n6  Four of the 23 watersheds\u2014one from each of the URBs\u2014have been selected as representative subprojects: \nBauko in the Chico River basin, Wahig\u2013Pamaksalan in Wahig\u2013Inabanga, Manupali\u2013Kitanglad in Upper Bukidnon, \nand Bubong in Lake Lanao. \n7  ADB. 2008.

", "2  \nirrigation  systems,  hydropower  generation,  and  domestic  water  supplies;  maintaining  and \nrestoring biodiversity; and mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration.  \n5.  The number of critical watersheds suffering from a loss of watershed integrity9 in the \nURBs increased from 85 in 1995 to 149 in 2007, with a corresponding increase in area from \n3.30  million  hectares  (ha)  to  3.89  million  ha. 10  Steadily  growing  population  pressure, \ndisplacement  of  marginal  and  indigenous  peoples,  and  inadequate  legal  and  practical \nmechanisms for resource protection has strongly contributed to conversion of forest land into \nmarginal upland farming.11 In the four URBs, the resultant annual cost of productivity loss from \nerosion  is  currently  $49  million,  or  about  25%  of  the  national  total.  The  seasonality  of \nproduction,  with  low  cropping  intensities  and  levels  of  diversification,  has  led  to  high \nunemployment (estimated at 7.1% in October 2010) and underemployment (18.5% in July 2010) \nfor  the  poor  (footnote  2).  Deforestation  has  also  rendered  many  poor  communities  more \nvulnerable to natural calamities such as typhoons, flash floods, and landslides.12 \n6.  Siltation of rivers and lake systems in Lake Lanao and Upper Bukidnon URBs has \ncaused losses in power output estimated at over 50%, with lost revenues for the National Power \nCorporation (NPC) totaling around $66 million annually.13 Siltation of coral reefs and destruction \nof mangroves has also reduced artisanal fish catches, a key source of income and protein for \npoor  coastal  communities.  Degradation  and  overexploitation  of  watersheds  is  a  major \ncontributor to increasing poverty, inequitable access to resources and services, and loss of \nlivelihood among upland dwellers. Poverty incidence in the project sites (2009) ranges from \n35.8% in Chico to 48.3% in Wahig\u2013Inabanga, significantly higher than the national poverty \nincidence  of  26.5%  in  2009.14 Indigenous  peoples  groups15 and  other  ethnic  minorities \nconstitute around 74% of the population in headwaters of the river basins.16 \n7.  Policy and institutional relevance. The project fully supports the Government of the \nPhilippines\u2019 poverty reduction, watershed management, biodiversity conservation, and climate \nchange policy objectives. The project design and scope are directly aligned with the PDP\u2019s aim \nto  use  integrated  ecosystem  management  as  a  major  strategy  for  (i)  sustainably  utilizing \nresources in critical watersheds, (ii) sustainably managing forestlands and ancestral domains for \nenhanced carbon stock, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and (iii) adapting to different \nclimate change scenarios. \n8.  In line with the DENR's program mandate, the project supports current institutional \nprograms  and  policy  directions:  (i)  Joint  Memorandum  Circular  Number  1,  Series  of  2010 \nbetween the Department of Agriculture (DA), the Department of Agrarian Reform, and the \nDENR adopts a convergence initiative to strengthen the development framework for sustainable \n                                                 \n9  \"Watershed integrity\" refers to a stable overall physical condition of the watershed (bedrock, landforms, soils, and \ndrainage ways) within which transfers of energy, matter, and especially water occur. It is a prerequisite to ensure \nthe sustainable flow of environmental services and the long-term health of forest and stream ecosystems. \n10 Upland Development Program Database, Forest Management Bureau, 2009.

Phased  Devolution. The project is consistent with the national policy of devolving \nspecified environmental and natural resources management functions and responsibilities to \nlocal governments, as expressed in the Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code \n(1991), the recognition of indigenous peoples rights to their ancestral domains (Republic Act \n8371), and the adoption of community-based forest management as the main strategy for \nsustainable  forest  management  (Executive  Order  263).  The  project  will  address \ninstitutional/policy  gaps  at  the  national  and  local  levels  by:  (i)  reinforcing  existing  co-\nmanagement policies18 between DENR and LGU clusters as part of Comprehensive Land Use \nPlans  (CLUPs);  (ii)  establishing  LGU  ordinances  for  conservation  through  user  fees  and \ninvestment  agreements  over  LGU  managed  forest  lands;  and  (iii)  establishing  plow-back \nmechanisms  for  conservation  investments  in  protected  areas  and  ancestral  domains  from \ncreation  of  new  productive  assets,  private  sector  investments,  and  deploying  payment  for \nenvironmental services (PES). \n \n10.  External support, lessons learned, and other linked projects. The project design is \nbased on more than 30 years of experience in watershed management in the Philippines, from \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2013IFAD  cofinanced  Highland  Agricultural  Development \nProject, which was initiated in the Cordillera Administrative Region in 1986, through to the \nCordillera Highland Agricultural Resource Management Project19 implemented from 1997 to \n2004. Lessons learned from these projects, as well as recent experiences from the Southern \nPhilippines Irrigation Sector Project,20 are incorporated in the project design to address the \nconflict between agricultural production and natural resource protection in watersheds. The \nintegrated project also draws on implementation lessons from the ongoing Integrated Coastal \nResources Management Project21 and the Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement \nSector Project22 to avoid delays in the activity schedule and allow appropriate lead times for \nLGU and community consultation and preparation.23 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  project  impact  will  be  improved  condition  of  watersheds  generating  livelihood \nbenefits in the four URBs. The outcome of the project will be increased rural household incomes \nand LGU revenues in selected watersheds in the four URBs. \n12.  Consistent with the sector modality, project outcomes will be influenced through policy \ndialogue to (i) clarify, rationalize, and delineate use rights of local communities and indigenous \n                                                 \n17 Mechanisms currently being pursued include regional convergence of business zones, linking the support of the \nthree agencies. The project will provide technical support to the DENR, the Department of Agriculture, and LGUs to \ndevelop investment packages for agroforestry and small-scale plantations in business zones. \n18 Such as  transfer of resource use rights to LGUs in production areas (DENR-DILG Memorandum Circular 2003-01) \n19 ADB. 1995.

LGU \nexperience  with  enterprise  management  will  be  adapted  to  manage  watershed  resources \nidentified for production.  \n13.  The project will initiate interventions in the Lake Lanao, Upper Bukidnon, and Wahig\u2013\nInabanga URBs that will contribute to reducing nutrient runoff from agricultural lands through \nimproving  farming  practices  to  reduce  siltation  and  discharge  of  harmful  pollutants  that \ncontribute to oxygen depletion in coastal waters of Iligan Bay, Macajalar Bay, and the Bohol \nSea. This \"ridge to reef\" approach will support activities under the Coral Triangle Initiative.24 \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The project outputs are consolidated based on extensive consultations with stakeholders \nand intended beneficiaries. \n15.  Output  1:  River  basin  and  watershed  management  and  investment  plans \nestablished. Indicative development plans (IDPs) will be developed for the four URBs to be \nadopted by regional development councils and/or provincial legislative councils. IDPs will be \nbased  on  land  capability  assessments  and  participatory  land  use  classification  to  identify \nappropriate management zones, and will be drawn up by the regional and provincial offices of \nthe DENR in coordination with national agencies and LGUs. Watershed management plans \n(WMPs) will be prepared for the selected watersheds based on the IDPs. The WMPs will define \nand prioritize subprojects and establish a work program for implementation by LGU clusters and \nmunicipal development councils. The WMPs will take account of existing tenurial arrangements \nand treat ancestral domains as management subunits.25 A geographical information system \n(GIS) based database for performance monitoring will be established. \n16.  Output 2: Smallholder and institutional investments in conservation increased and \nURB  productivity  enhanced  in  the  forestry,  agriculture  and  rural  sectors.  Subproject \ninvestments will be undertaken within the 23 project watersheds based on outputs from river \nbasin-wide  planning  (output  1).  Interventions  for  watershed  restoration  and  rehabilitation \ncovering more than 325,590 ha will be implemented by the DENR to include community-based \nprotection,  reforestation  and/or  assisted  natural  regeneration,  production  forestry  including \ndemonstrations  on  agroforestry  and  commercial  plantations,  and  conservation  farming. \nLivelihood  improvement  investments  to  be  undertaken  by  municipal  LGUs  include  (i)  645 \nkilometers of rural access roads and foot trails; (ii) communal irrigation systems servicing 3,040 \nha; (iii) 275 units of potable community water facilities; (iv) a provincial trading and processing \ncenter supporting farming communities; and (v) seed funds for replication and/or expansion of \ntested and mature farming technologies. \n17.

The project will \nsupport the establishment of a national project coordination office (NPCO), regional project \ncoordinating offices (RPCO), provincial project management offices (PPMO) and watershed \nmanagement  and  project  coordination  offices  (WMPCO)  at  the  DENR.  The  NPCO  will  (i) \ncoordinate  consultant  recruitment  and  supervision;  (ii)  conduct  procurement  of  materials, \nequipment, and vehicles during project implementation; (iii) operationalize the project monitoring \nand evaluation system; (iv) mobilize resources for capacity building of DENR\u2019s regional and \nprovincial units and the LGUs; (v) consolidate the annual program and budgets received from \nprovincial and regional levels; and (vi) conduct gender and safeguard monitoring and reporting. \n19.  Special  features:  Climate  Change  Fund  and  Global  Environment  Facility.  The \nproject,  as  supplemented  by  grants,  will  mainstream  climate  change  mitigation  through \ninvestments for (i) establishing smallholder-based biomass energy forest demonstration plots \nwith  private  equity  contribution  in  upper  Bukidnon,  (ii)  establishing  and  verifying  reduced \nemissions from deforestation and forest degradation and conservation and enhancement of \ncarbon stocks (REDD+) through demonstration activities, and (iii) implementing appropriate \nclimate change adaptation measures in upland production systems. Through GEF, biodiversity \nconservation will be mainstreamed in watersheds through application of a community-based \nbiodiversity corridor approach for conservation of remaining mossy forest stands in the Chico\u2013\nAgno\u2013Magat River basins triboundary headwaters area of the Cordillera. PES agreements will \nbe developed between indigenous people\u2019s organizations and downstream ecosystem-service \nbeneficiaries, initially in the triboundary area between three indigenous people\u2019s organization \nand the NPC.26,27  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $154.13 million, including contingencies, taxes, and \nduties. The investment plan is in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and \ndetailed cost estimates by financier are provided in the project administration manual (PAM).28 \n21.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The government, through the DENR, has requested a \nloan of $100 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. \nThe loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,29 a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and other such terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft financing agreement.

Within each of the URBs, there will be a phased approach to work from one \nwatershed to the next, starting with the 4 priority subproject watersheds, until all the URBs are \ncovered. As the executing agency, DENR will assume full responsibility in project administration \nand  management.  An  interagency  National  Project  Steering  Committee  (NPSC)  will  be \nestablished to provide policy guidance chaired by a DENR undersecretary. The National Project \nCoordination Office (NPCO) will be established at the DENR central office with the Forest \nManagement Bureau. The Municipal Development Fund Office will administer the funds for rural \ninfrastructure improvements to be implemented by the municipal LGUs except for those covered \nby  the  Cordillera  Highland  Agricultural  Resource  Management  project  areas  which  will  be \nadministered by the Department of Agriculture.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Project beneficiaries include local level stakeholders, public utilities and their customers, \nand river basin stakeholders. Beneficiaries will benefit from increased incomes generated from \nproviding  rural  infrastructure,  sustainable  forestry  and  agricultural  activities,  and  extension \nservices initiated and supported by the project. The project is expected to yield substantial \nbenefits: (i) incremental benefits from increased crop yields and productivity through investment \nin  improved  rural  accessibility  and  irrigation,  extension  services,  sustainable  forestry,  and \nagricultural diversification activities; (ii) incremental employment creation estimated at  270,000 \nperson-months of wage-generating opportunities for households and local communities from \nproposed investments; (iii) households benefiting from safe drinking water, hence avoiding \nsignificant water-related diseases and health-care-related costs; (iv) improved water quality \nwithin URBs with reduced operating and delivery costs, bringing about significant benefit for \npublic utilities, household enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, and downstream \nfarmers that utilize water for a variety of purposes; (v) increased economic activity, improved \nservice delivery, and greater security from the adverse impacts of climate change and natural \ndisasters  benefiting  the  population  within  URBs  and  81  LGUs,  the  majority  of  which  are \ncategorized as low-income municipalities; (vi) reduced carbon dioxide emissions and better \nprotection and conservation of biodiversity will benefit the population in all URBs and LGUs; (vii) \nimproved ecosystem services such as climate regulation, watershed protection, water quality \nregulation,  soil  erosion  prevention,  and  nutrition  retention  realized  by  improved  forest \necosystems in the four URBs; and (viii) avoided loss of forest cover, critical in the URBs \nservicing downstream infrastructure.  \n27.   Economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  five  sample  investments,  including  (i) \nrehabilitation and improvement of small-scale communal irrigation systems, (ii) rehabilitation \nand improvement of rural access roads, (iii) establishment of communal drinking water supply, \n(iv) establishment of agroforestry plantations, and (v) establishment of plantation forestry. Base-\ncase economic internal rates of return for the five sample investments are 18.0%, 38%, 34%, \n28%,  and  43.0%  respectively,  demonstrating  the  viability  of  the  packaged  subproject \ninvestments.33 \nB.  Governance \n28.  Procurement of civil works and goods will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  while  engagement  of \nconsultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Land use assessment planning, zoning, delineation, and demarcation will be \n \nconducted  under  the  direct  supervision  of  the  DENR  and  using  DENR  guidelines. Force \naccount procedures will be used for procurement of labor for demarcation and civil works since \nthe works are small in scale and in remote locations. These will be undertaken by the DENR \nand/or the LGUs which have the capacity to undertake such works. All civil works contracts \nexceeding $100,000 and less than $5,000,000 will be procured through the national competitive \nbidding procedure (footnote 28). Community participation will be used for forest protection, \nreforestation, assisted natural regeneration, and commercial and agroforestry demonstrations to \n \nensure sustained benefits. The NPCO shall ensure that all accounts at the DENR-CO and the \nMDFO are consolidated and audited by the Commission on Audit or other auditors acceptable \nto  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government  and  the  DENR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 28). \n                                                 \n33 Economic and financial analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The project targets about 220,000 household beneficiaries, the majority of which are \nvulnerable  and  marginalized.  It  is  recognized  that  the  targeted  local  groups  have  limited \ninfluence on decision making. A consolidated consultation and participation plan, resettlement \nframework, indigenous peoples planning framework (IPPF), and gender action plan have been \nprepared to ensure that concerns of vulnerable sectors are addressed and benefits equitably \ndistributed. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming as it is designed to \nbenefit  women  by  increasing  their  participation  and  decision  making  in  natural  resource \nmanagement at the community and LGU levels and providing improved access to services. \nD.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment (category B). Project interventions in reforestation and assisted natural \nregeneration and forest protection, and demonstrations in commercial tree plantations and \nagroforestry, will generate positive environmental impacts. These benefits outweigh the minimal \nand temporary adverse impacts, which are easily mitigated by adopting the environmental \nmonitoring  and  management  plan  and  observing  additional  environmental  safeguards,  as \noutlined in the environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) covering the four \nsummary initial environmental examinations of the sample subprojects, which were prepared to \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).34 The EARF will be posted on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite upon Board approval of the Project. \n31.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Land  use  zoning  may  result  in  restricted \naccess  to  privately  held  ancestral  and/or  communal  properties,  particularly  for  indigenous \npeoples, potentially impacting their sources of food and livelihood. A resettlement framework to \nguide the preparation of resettlement plans for project-affected people has been prepared and \nendorsed  by  the  government,  and  is  consistent  with  relevant  national  laws  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement.35 \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category A). An estimated 73.5% of household beneficiaries are \nindigenous peoples and/or ethnic minorities. To guide the preparation of indigenous peoples \nplans, an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) has been prepared, consistent with \nnational laws and legal procedures and ADB\u2019s safeguard policy on indigenous peoples. The \nIPPF has been endorsed by the government.36 Ethnic minorities such as the Maranaos of \nMuslim Mindanao were consulted, and participation and benefit-sharing arrangements are in \nline with the specific provincial and municipal LGU structures and the Autonomous Region for \nMuslim Mindanao Organic Act. \nE.
