An  initial  environmental \nexamination was undertaken and the summary is in Appendix 12. \n \nThe  Project  has \nimprovement  of \n127  kilometers  (km)  of  two-lane  paved  road  on  the  sections  of \nYevlakh\u2013Ganja  and  Qazakh\u2013Georgian  border  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s \nprimary  east\u2013west  highway,  (ii)  improvement  of  10  local  roads \ntotaling  about  65  km  in  the  project  area,  (iii)  support  for  policy \nreform  and  improved  governance  in  the  road  subsector  through \ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  (iv)  facilitation  of  the  movement \nacross Azerbaijan\u2019s border (at Red Bridge) with Georgia. \n \nThe  Project \ntransport \nin \ndevelopment  program  (2005\u22122014).  The  Project  will  facilitate \nsocioeconomic development by improving the east\u2013west highway \nand  local  roads  linking  the  western  part  of  Azerbaijan  closely  to \nBaku,  the  country\u2019s  capital;  and  increasing  local  communities\u2019 \njob  opportunities,  and  social  services. \naccess \nThe  Project  will  also  strengthen  Azerbaijan\u2019s  transport  links  to \nGeorgia  and  thus  promote  regional  cooperation.  As  part  of  the \nAsian  highway  network  and  one  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s  main  routes  for \nexternal  trade,  the  east\u2013west  highway  carries  traffic  between  the \nCaspian  and  Black  seas  and  has  the  potential  to  become  an \nimportant  route  for  transit  transport  between  Asia  and  Europe. \nThe Project is included in ADB\u2019s assistance program for 2005 and \nis consistent with its assistance strategy for Azerbaijan. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  accelerated  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  in  the  six  rayons  of  west  Azerbaijan  and  enhanced \nregional  cooperation.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  traffic  and \nimproved  quality  and  efficiency  of  transport  on  the  east\u2013west \nhighway and selected local roads. \n \nThe total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, \ninterest,  and  other  charges  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$93.2 million equivalent. \n \n\nto  markets, \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nTotal ($ million) \n \n\nPercent \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n Ordinary capital resources \n Special Funds resources \nIslamic Development Bank \nSaudi Fund for Development \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\n49.0 \n3.0 \n10.4 \n11.0 \n19.8 \n93.2 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n52.6 \n3.2 \n11.2 \n11.8 \n21.2 \n100.0 \n\nfinance \n\nthe  road \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  blend  of  two \nloans:  a  loan  of  $49.0  million  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources \n(OCR)  and  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special \nDrawing Rights (SDR) 2,075,000 ($3.0 million equivalent) from its \nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  OCR \nloan  will \nimprovement  and  cross-border \nfacilitation  components,  and  the  SDR  loan  will  finance  the \ninstitutional  strengthening  component.  The  OCR  loan  will  have  a \n24-year term including a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan  Agreement.  The  SDR  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement. \n \nUntil 31 May 2010 \n \n30 November 2009 \n\n \nThe  executing  agencies  are  (i)  the  Road  Transport  Service \nDepartment  (RTSD)  under  the  Ministry  of  Transport  for  the  road \nimprovement  and  institutional  strengthening  components,  and \n(ii)  the  State  Customs  Committee  (SCC)  for  the  cross-border \nfacilitation component. \n \n \nThe project implementation unit (PIU) in RTSD will be reorganized \nto manage implementation of all road projects supported by ADB, \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  World \nBank. The PIU will implement ADB-funded activities and prepare \nreports  under  the  Project.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project \ndirector,  who  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of  qualified  technical, \nfinancial, and support staff. SCC will appoint a project coordinator \nfacilitation \nto  manage \ncomponent. \n \nA  project  steering committee (PSC) will be  established to ensure\n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  cross-border \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\ninspection, \n\nfor  border \n\nclose  interagency  coordination  and  supervise  implementation. \nThe  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  RTSD  director  and  will  comprise \nrepresentatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development, \nMinistry of Finance, and Ministry of Transport; as well as the PIU \nproject  director  and  SCC  project  coordinator.  Representatives  of \nrelevant  local  communities  will  be  invited  to  PSC  meetings  for \nlocal  road  improvement.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to \nreview  implementation  progress  and  provide  approvals  and \nguidance on project implementation as necessary. \n \nADB-funded  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works will be divided into \n15 contracts; ADB will finance 14 of the contracts, and the Islamic \nDevelopment  Bank  (IsDB)  and  the  Saudi  Fund  for  Development \n(SFD)  will  jointly  finance  one.  ADB-financed  civil  works  contracts \nfor  improving  the  Yevlakh\u2013Ganja  and  Qazakh\u2013Georgian  border \nroad  sections  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding procedures. Civil works contracts for improving local roads \nand cross-border facilities at Red Bridge will be procured through \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable \nto  ADB. \nroad \nProcurement  of  equipment \nmaintenance,  and  weighing  vehicles  will  follow  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  Anticorruption  provisions \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  be  included  in  all  bidding  documents  and \ncontacts. \n \nADB  approved  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  on \n10 May 2005. The Government was advised that ADB approval of \nadvance procurement action does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject  and  that  ADB  will  not  finance  expenses  paid  by  the \nGovernment prior to loan effectiveness. \n \nThe Project will require 993 person-months of consulting services \n(104  international  and  889  domestic)  to  support  implementation. \nRTSD  will  engage  (i)  a  consulting  firm  for  869  person-months \n(64  international  and  805  domestic)  for  detailed  design  and \nconstruction supervision for improving the east\u2013west highway and \nlocal  roads,  and  (ii)  a  consulting  firm  for  94  person-months \n(30  international  and  64  domestic)  for  institutional  strengthening. \nSCC  will  engage  individual  consultants  for  30  person-months \n(10  international  and  20  domestic)  for  cross-border  facilitation. \nADB will finance consulting services for detailed design for all the \nproject roads, construction supervision for ADB-financed sections, \ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  cross-border  facilitation.  ADB-\nfinanced  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  according  to \nthe  Guidelines  on the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian  Development \nBank  and  its  Borrowers  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to \nADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  IsDB  will \nfinance  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision  for  the \nroad section funded by IsDB and SFD loans. \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \n\nthe \n\n(i.e., \n\nThe Project will benefit people living along the project sections of \nthe  east\u2013west  highway;  road  users;  construction  companies; \ntraders;  and  other  people  who  derive  income  from  expanded \ntraffic, trade, and investment in the project area. The major direct \nbenefits  will  include  (i)  lower  road  transport  and  maintenance \ncosts,  (ii)  faster  and  more  reliable  road  transport  services, \n(iii)  improved  access  of  local  communities  to  markets  and  social \nservices, (iv) job and income opportunities created during project \nimplementation (i.e., use of local labor and construction materials) \nand  after  project  completion \nroadside  businesses), \n(v)  efficient  movement  of \nfreight  and  passengers  across \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  border \n(at  Red  Bridge)  with  Georgia,  and \n(vi)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  in  the  road  subsector. \nThe economic internal rate of return for the Project is estimated at \n17.9%. The Project is expected to create 5,250 person-months of \nskilled  jobs  at  about  $400  per  person  per  month  and  3,000 \nperson-months  of  unskilled  jobs  at  about  $200  per  person  per \nmonth.  Indirect  benefits  will  be  increased  business  and  job \nopportunities  that  have  backward  or  forward  linkages  to  the \nProject, and expanded trade between Azerbaijan and Georgia as \nwell as other countries in the region. \n \nThe  Project  was  designed  based  on \nfollowing  key \nassumptions: (i) continued political stability and economic growth \nin  Azerbaijan  and  the  region,  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  continued \ncommitment to regional cooperation, (iii) effective implementation \nof  the  Government\u2019s  transport  development  program  (2005\u2013\n2014),  (iv)  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funding,  and  (v)  timely \ncofinancing from IsDB and SFD. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  major  potential  risk  is  that  the  project  roads  after \ncompletion  may  experience  a  higher  than  anticipated  rate  of \ndeterioration  due  to  axle  overloading  and  inadequate  funding  for \nmaintenance. Because the limited institutional capacity in the road \nsubsector  constitutes  a  major  constraint  to  addressing  these \nissues,  the  Project  will  mitigate  this  risk  through  institutional \nstrengthening  assistance  to  the  road  subsector,  accompanied  by \nloan  conditionality.  The  Project  will  help  enforce  axle-load \nregulations  by  assisting  RTSD  to  establish  and  operate  vehicle \nweigh  stations  along  the  main  roads  and  improve  monitoring. \nDuring  project  preparation,  ADB  assisted  the  Government  in \ndeveloping  a  road  maintenance  program,  which  envisages  a \nsteady  increase  in  maintenance  funding  to  cover  the  entire  road \nnetwork by 2015. The Government is committed to implement the \nsupport \nroad  maintenance  program.  The  Project  will \nimplementation of the program by assisting RTSD in reorganizing \nregional  maintenance  units,  prioritizing  roads  for  maintenance, \nutilizing the newly developed pavement management system, and \nidentifying alternative sources for maintenance funding. Given the \ncomplexity  of  these  issues,  the  Project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  support  for \nbuilding  effective  institutions  in  Azerbaijan  for  sustainable  road \nto  commercial  principals.  ADB  will \nmanagement  according \ncontinue assistance in this direction under future road projects.

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Azerbaijan for the East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework of the Project is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nAzerbaijan,  with  an  area  of  about  86,600  square  kilometer  (km2)  and  population  of  \n2. \n8.3  million,  stands  at  the  crossroads  between  east  and  west  in  the  southern  Caucasus.  \nThe transport sector plays an important role in the national economy, accounting for 10.2% of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2003.  Roads  are  among  the  major  modes  of  transport. \nHowever,  road  transport  faces  challenges  due  to  the  country\u2019s  transition  from  a  centrally \nplanned  to  a  market-oriented  system.  A  detailed  road  subsector  analysis  is  in  Appendix  2.  \nThe significant features are summarized below. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nAzerbaijan  (excluding  Nakhchivan)2  has  a  road  network  of  about  18,800 \nkilometers  (km),  comprising  4,577  km  of  national  roads  and  14,222  km  of  local \nroads. Road density is 0.2 km per km2. Approximately 52% of roads are paved, \n47% gravel, and the remaining earth tracks. About 75% of the network is in poor \ncondition and needs rehabilitation. \n\nIn 2003 roads carried 78% of passengers in passenger-kilometers, 28% of freight \nin ton-kilometers, 29.8% of imports, and 6.9% of exports. \n\nThe  use  of  motor  vehicles  is  low  by  international  standards.  The  vehicle  fleet \nnumbered  486,800  in  2003,  equivalent  to  58  vehicles  per  1,000  people.  \nAbout 60% of vehicles are outdated and need to be replaced. \n\nThe  environment  for  road  transport  is  competitive,  with  the  private  sector \naccounting for more than 95% of freight and passenger transport in 2003. Almost \nall  state-owned  road  transport  operators  have  been  privatized  and  foreign  road \ntransport  operators  are  allowed  to  set  up  businesses.  Freight  charges  and  bus \nfares  for  domestic  transport  are  based  on  market  conditions,  while  the \nGovernment sets tariffs for cross-border and international transit vehicles. \n\nRoads are the responsibility of the Road Transport Service Department (RTSD) \nand the Auto Transport Service Department under the Ministry of Transport that \nwas  established  in  2003.  RTSD  is  responsible  for  road  infrastructure  networks, \nwhile  the  Auto  Transport  Service  Department  is  responsible  for  road  transport \nservices. Institutional capacity in the subsector is limited. \n\n(vi)  With  the  abolishment  of  the  Road  Fund  in  2001,  roads  are  financed  primarily \nfrom the Government\u2019s budget. Although funding for road maintenance increased \nfrom  AZM31.8  billion  ($6.7  million)  in  2001  to  AZM153  million  ($31.5  million)  in \n2005, it accounted only for 0.2% of GDP and remained inadequate. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  A small-scale project preparatory technical assistance was provided to update the feasibility studies of this Project, \n\nfunded by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 2000 and the European Union in 2002. \n\n2  Nakhchivan, as an autonomous region, is separated from central Azerbaijan by Armenia. Central Azerbaijan and \n\nNakhchivan are connected by air transport or road transport via Iran. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n(vii)  Road  accidents  have  increased  since  2001.  The  2,388  road  accidents  in  2004 \nresulted  in  811  fatalities  and  2,766  injuries.  The  fatality  rate  in  2004  was  about  \n17 per 10,000 vehicles, much higher than in western European countries. Annual \neconomic  loss  from  road  accidents  was  more  than  $110  million,  accounting  for \n1.7% of GDP. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nRoad Network. Azerbaijan\u2019s road network includes two major highways: the east\u2013west \n3. \nhighway linking Baku, the country\u2019s capital, to the Georgian border and the north\u2013south highway \nrunning  from  the  Russian  border  to  the  Iranian  border  via  Baku,  as  well  as  a  number  of \nsecondary  and  local  roads.  The  east\u2013west  highway,  which  is  about  500  km,  is  one  of \nAzerbaijan\u2019s main routes for transport links to the western region and external trade. However, \nthe  network  was  developed  primarily  under  the  former  Soviet  Union  when  traffic  volume  was \nmuch higher. Due to lack of resources for maintenance and vehicle axle overloading, about 75% \nof the network is in poor condition. Based on the road condition data available, 61% of the east\u2013\nwest  and  north\u2013south  highways,  76%  of  other  national  roads,  66%  of  secondary  roads,  and \n76%  of  rural  roads  require  rehabilitation.  This  constitutes  a  major  impediment  to  economic \ngrowth and private sector development due to high transport costs and accidents. In recognition \nof this, the Government has set improvement of road infrastructure as one of the priority actions \nin  the  State  Programme  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development  (SPPRED)  for \n2003\u221220053 and embarked on a transport development program (2005\u20132014), which starts with \nimprovement of the east\u2013west and north\u2013south highways. The Government is also finalizing a \nprogram for improving secondary roads. The majority of the east\u2013west highway has been or is \nbeing  improved  with  external  assistance  (Table  1).  The  World  Bank-assisted  project  for \nimproving the Ganja\u2013Qazakh section is expected to be completed in 2006, while the European \nBank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is expected to complete improvement of the \nHajigabul\u2013Kyurdamir  section  in  2008.  The  proposed  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Project \nwill  improve  the  last  two  sections  of  the  east\u2013west  highway  and  address  issues  on  road \nmaintenance  and  vehicle  axle  overloading.  This  will  help  maximize  the  benefits  from  other \nimproved sections of the highway so as to foster private sector-led economic growth. \n \n\nTable 1: Improvement of the East-West Highway in Azerbaijan \n\nSection \n\nSource of Funding \n\nStatus of Improvement \n\nBaku\u2212Alyat \nAlyat\u2212Hajigabul \nHajigabul\u2212Kyurdamir \nKyurdamir\u2212Ujar \nUjar\u2212Yevlakh \nYevlakh\u2212Ganja (via Ganja Bypass) \nGanja\u2212Qazakh \nQazakh\u2212Georgian border \nTotal \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EBRD  =  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  IsDB  =  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank, SFD = Saudi Fund for Development. \nSource: Road Transport Service Department. \n \n\nGovernment \nIsDB and Kuwait Fund \nEBRD \nKuwait Fund \nIsDB  \nADB, IsDB, and SFD \nWorld Bank \nADB \n \n\nOngoing \nCompleted \nOngoing \nOngoing \nOngoing \nTo start in 2006 \nOngoing \nTo start in 2006 \n \n\nLength \n(km) \n55 \n45 \n81 \n46 \n53 \n89 \n94 \n38 \n501 \n\n                                                 \n3  Republic  of  Azerbaijan.  2003.  State  Programme  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development,  2003\u20132005. \n\nBaku. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\nRoad  Maintenance.  Azerbaijan  inherited  a  large  stock  of  road  infrastructure  from  the \n4. \nformer Soviet Union and is facing the challenge of properly  maintaining the road  network with \nlimited resources. Based on the assumption that the entire road network is maintainable, RTSD \nestimates that total maintenance costs for 2005 are about $260 million. However, according to \nADB staff assessment, road maintenance costs for 2005 amount to $37 million, partly because \nthe  unit  rates  are  lower  and  partly  because  25%  of  the  network  is  estimated  to  be  currently \nmaintainable (Appendix 2). Funding for road maintenance increased from AZM31.8 billion ($6.7 \nmillion)  in  2001  to  AZM153.0  billion  ($31.5  million)  in  2005,  but  remained  inadequate.  As  a \nresult,  road  maintenance  operations  are  limited  to  emergency  pavement  repairs.  Moreover, \nRTSD\u2019s 61 rayon-based maintenance units, which currently undertake road maintenance works, \nare  inefficient  due  to  lack  of  economic  scale  and  weak  management.  In  recognition  that \nimproved  roads  cannot  be  sustained  without  adequate  resources  to  maintain  them,  the \nGovernment  plans  to  launch  a  road  maintenance  program  in  parallel  with  road  improvement. \nThe  program  envisages  a  steady  increase  in  the  maintainable  network  as  road  improvement \ntakes place and a corresponding increase in maintenance funding to cover the entire network by \n2015.  To  implement  the  road  maintenance  program,  the  Government  plans  to  reorganize  the \nregional maintenance units and implement a newly developed pavement management system. \nGiven that the limited institutional capacity in the road subsector constitutes a main constraint to \nimplementing  the  road  maintenance  program,  the  Project  will  strengthen  RTSD\u2019s  capacity  for \nroad  maintenance  by  helping  reorganize  regional  maintenance  units,  prioritize  roads  for \nmaintenance, implement the pavement management system, and identify alternative sources of \nmaintenance funding. \n \n5. \nAxle-Load  Control.  Azerbaijan  has  developed  regulations  to  limit  vehicle  axle  load  to  \n13  tons,  but  enforcement  is  weak  primarily  due  to  limited  institutional  capacity  and  lack  of \nvehicle weigh facilities. As a result, vehicle axle overloading is prevalent.4 Surveys conducted in \n1999  on  the  east\u2013west  highway  showed  that  20%  of  4-axle  trucks,  16%  of  5-axle  trucks,  and \n13%  of  buses  exceeded  the  axle-load  limit.  Heavy  vehicle  weights  are  one  of  the  primary \ncauses  of  rapid  pavement  deterioration  and  damage  to  bridges.  In  response,  the  Government \nrecently decided to enforce axle-load regulations by establishing 12 vehicle weigh stations along \nmain roads.5 The Project will assist RTSD in establishing and operating vehicle weigh stations, \nassessing the axle overloading problem, and improving monitoring of axle overloading. \n \n6. \nRoad  Safety.  Road  accidents  are  increasing  in  Azerbaijan.  The  major  causes  include \npoor  road  conditions,  lack  of  safety  features  and  facilities,  weak  enforcement  of  road  safety \nregulations,  intoxicated  driving,  and  inadequate  driver  education.  Although  the  State  Road \nSafety  Commission  is  coordinating  activities  of  concerned  government  agencies,  it  does  not \nhave  executive  powers.  To  improve  road  safety,  the  Government  developed  a  road  safety \nprogram that requires establishing road accident monitoring, reporting, and information systems. \nThe Project will improve road safety by helping implement the road safety program; improve the \nlegislation  and  regulations  on  road  safety;  develop  road  accident  monitoring,  reporting,  and \ninformation  systems;  enhance  RTSD\u2019s  capacity  to  identify  accident  black  spots  on  the  road \nnetwork; and provide staff training. \n \nRoads  and  Poverty  Reduction.  Despite  recent  economic  growth,  40.2%  of  the \n7. \npopulation  in  Azerbaijan  was  living  in  poverty  in  2004.  In  the  6  rayons  (regions)\u2014Agstafa, \n                                                 \n4  Dressed  stone  blocks  are  a  common  building  material  in  Azerbaijan;  these  mostly  originate  from  quarries  in  the \narea  of  Qaradag  near  Baku.  These  stone  blocks  are  usually  transported  in  3-axle  Kamaz  trucks  that  can  be \ncommonly overloaded by at least 7 tons. \n\n5  Two vehicle weigh stations will be located along the Yevlakh\u2013Ganja section and Qazakh\u2013Georgian border section \n\nof the east\u2013west highway, respectively. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nGanja,  Goranboy,  Khanlar,  Qazakh,  and  Yevlakh\u2014that  the  project  road  transverses,  about \n261,000 people (37.2% of the total population) lived in poverty in 2003. As the project area is \nadjacent  to  the  Armenian-occupied  Nagorno-Karabakh  area,  about  86,800  in  the  project  area \nare  internally  displaced  people  and  refugees,  who  are  much  poorer  and  highly  dependent  on \nroad  transport  for  access  to  basic  services  and  assistance  from  the  Government  and  relief \norganizations.  While  the  poverty  analysis  shows  that  the  main  causes  of  poverty  are \nunemployment  and  lack  of  energy  and  water  resources,  poor  road  conditions  impose \nconstraints on job opportunities. Improvement of road infrastructure is one of the priorities in the \nSPPRED  for  2003\u22122005.  The  Project  will  help  reduce  poverty  by  improving  the  east\u2013west \nhighway and local roads, which will reduce transport costs for the poor in the project area and \nimprove their access to jobs, markets, and basic social services. \n \nCross-Border  and  Transit  Facilitation.  The  road  system  contributes  significantly  to \n8. \ncross-border  and  international  transit  traffic.  The  north\u2013south  highway  connects  the  Russian \nFederation  and  Iran,  while  the  east\u2013west  highway  is  Azerbaijan\u2019s  segment  of  the  trans-\nCaucasian corridor running between the Caspian and Black seas. The east\u2013west highway also \nforms part of the Asian highway network6 and the \u201csilk route\u201d linking Asia to Europe. Although \ninternational traffic on the east\u2013west highway is currently small (about 5% of the total traffic), the \ncorridor has the potential to become an important transit route. Azerbaijan has signed a number \nof international transit and transport agreements and conventions. The country\u2019s trade policy is \ngenerally liberal, with limited application of export tariffs for metals and articles, low import tariffs \n(a  weighted  average  of  5.7%  in  2004),  and  few  quantitative  restrictions.7  However,  poor  road \nconditions, inadequate border facilities, and limited capacity at Azerbaijan\u2019s border with Georgia \n(at Read Bridge) are impeding cross-border traffic and trade. A World Bank survey shows that \n80% of firms experienced delays of 1\u22123 days in crossing the borders of Azerbaijan.8 Transport \nsecurity has also become an emerging issue. The Project will facilitate the movement of freight \nand  passengers  across  the  border  of  Red  Bridge  by  improving  the  existing  cross-border \nagreement  between  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia,  improving  border  facilities,  providing  equipment, \nand enhancing the capacity of officers serving at the border. \n \n9. \nInstitutional  Capacity.  Despite  some  improvement,  institutional  capacity  in  the  road \nsubsector  remains  inadequate.  Officials  have  limited  knowledge  of  sound  sector  policies  and \nregulations needed for a market economy, management of commercially based road transport \nservices,  new  technology  in  construction  and  maintenance  of  road  infrastructure,  and \nappropriate methodology for monitoring and evaluating road projects. During 2003\u2013April 2005, \nthe  World  Bank  extended  technical  assistance  for  institutional  strengthening  of  the  road \nsubsector,  which  included  (i)  developing  a  corporate  plan  for  RTSD,  (ii)  conducting  a  road \ninventory  and  functional  classification  of  the  network,  (iii)  reviewing  road  user  charges,  \n(iv)  developing  a  pavement  management  system,  (v)  reviewing  technical  standards  and \nspecifications,  (vi)  establishing  a  financial  management  system,  (vii)  developing  a  quality \nroad  management  program,  \nassurance  system, \n(ix)  addressing  traffic  safety,  and  (x)  assessing  performance.  The  World  Bank  assistance  is  a \nfirst  step  toward  sustainable  road  development.  However,  the  subsector  needs  continued \nassistance,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  Government\u2019s  acceptance  and  implementation  of \nWorld Bank recommendations. Based on the results of World Bank assistance, the Project will \n\n(viii)  developing  a  multiyear \n\nrolling \n\n                                                 \n6  The concept of the Asian highway network was developed with assistance from the United Nations Economic and \nSocial  Commission  for  Asia  and  Pacific.  Twenty-seven  Asian  countries  including  Azerbaijan  have  signed  the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on the Asian Highway Network. \n\n7  ADB.  2005.

This  will  complement  EBRD\u2019s  planned  assistance  to  implement  the  newly \ndeveloped corporate plan and financial management system.9 \n \n10. \nGovernance and Corruption. Weak governance is a daunting challenge in Azerbaijan. \nThe  general  perception  in  the  private  sector  is  that  corruption  exists  and  adversely  affects \nsustainable development in the country. The Government has taken action to tackle corruption. \nThe  new  Anticorruption  Law  became  effective  in  January  2005.  The  new  Anticorruption \nCommission  is  chaired  by  the  head  of  the  Presidential  Administration  and  comprises  \n12 members from the Presidential Administration, Parliament, and constitutional courts. A new \nProcurement Law was adopted, which the World Bank considers as one of the better such laws \nin the region.10 The Government also adopted the State Program on Fight against Corruption for \n2004\u20132006  and  established  the  Special  Anticorruption  Department  within  the  Prosecutor\u2019s \nOffice  in  March  2005  to  undertake  corruption-related  investigations.  Work  is  also  underway  to \nratify the United Nations Convention against Corruption. However, limited institutional capacity \nis a constraint on effective implementation of the law and the state program on anticorruption. \nThe Project will improve governance in the road subsector by strengthening RTSD\u2019s capacity for \nroad maintenance, axle-load control, road safety, and project management and implementation. \n \nGovernment  Strategy.  With  assistance  from  ADB  and  development  partners,  the \n11. \nGovernment  developed  the  SPPRED  for  2003\u20132005,  which  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and \nfacilitate growth of employment and income. The Government is now preparing a new national \npoverty reduction strategy for 2006 onward. The Government also approved the State Program \non  Socioeconomic  Development  of  Regions  for  2004\u2212200811  to  promote  regionally  balanced \ndevelopment.  In  recognition  of  the  importance  of  roads  in  poverty  reduction  and  economic \ngrowth, \n(2005\u22122014).  \nThe  program  includes  (i)  improving  the  east\u2013west  and  north\u2013south  highways  by  2008,  \n(ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the transport sector, (iii) improving secondary and \nrural  roads,  and  (iv)  improving  road  maintenance.  Given  large  funding  requirements  for  road \ninfrastructure  investments  and  the  limitation  of  mobilizing  private  sector  resources,  the \nGovernment has requested external aid agencies including ADB to help finance improvement of \nthe main highways. The Government accords high priority to improving the east\u2013west highway. \nThe Project is highly relevant and responsive to Azerbaijan\u2019s needs. \n \nADB  Assistance.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  strategy  for  Azerbaijan12  aims  to  reduce  poverty \n12. \nand raise living standards in a sustainable manner. Given Azerbaijan\u2019s location and reliance on \ntransport  links  with  neighboring  countries,  the  latest  country  strategy  and  program  update13 \nidentifies  transport  as  a  strategically  important  sector  for  ADB  assistance.  In  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  priority,  ADB  assistance  to  roads  focuses  on  improving  main  highways  to \nenhance  regional  transport  linkages,  supporting  policy  reform,  and  strengthening  institutional \ncapacity.  The  Project,  which  is  ADB\u2019s  first  road  project  in  Azerbaijan  and  is  included  in  its \ncountry  assistance  program  for  2005,  is  consistent  with  its  country  strategy.  ADB  relied \nextensively  on  the  sector  studies  undertaken  by  EBRD  and  the  World  Bank  during  project \npreparation. In April 2005 ADB approved a technical assistance grant to help the Government \n                                                 \n9  EBRD plans to help RTSD establish 4\u22126 regional maintenance management divisions and enable these divisions \n\ntransport  development  program \n\nthe  Government  developed  a \n\nto operate on a commercial basis. \n\n10 World Bank. 2003.

The  road  subsector  has  received  external  assistance  since  the \n13. \nmid-1990s (Appendix 3). Following the completion of a feasibility study funded by EBRD and the \nKuwait  Fund,  external  aid  agencies  provided  credits  to  help  improve  the  east\u2013west  highway. \nImprovement  of  the  Alyat\u2013Hajigabul  section  financed  by  the  Kuwait  Fund  and  the  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank (IsDB) was completed in 2003. The sections under improvement include the \nGanja\u2013Qazakh section funded by the World Bank, Hajigabul\u2013Kyurdamir section by EBRD, and \nthe  Ujar\u2013Yevlakh  section  by  IsDB.  EBRD  approved  a  \u20ac70  million  loan  in  June  2005  for \nimproving  the  northern  highway  from  Baku  to  the  Russian  border,  with  cofinancing  from  the \nExport-Import  Bank  of  the  Czech  Republic.  Iran  is  helping  undertake  a  feasibility  study  on \nimproving the southern highway from Alyat to the Iranian border, and the World Bank plans to \nprovide  a  $200  million  loan  for  financing,  together  with  ADB.  RTSD  also  received  technical \nassistance  for  institutional  strengthening  from  the  World  Bank  and  the  European  Union.  \nThe  Project  will  complement  activities  of  development  partners.  ADB  has  cooperated  closely \nwith them during project preparation and will continue to do so during implementation. \n \n14. \nLesson Learned. Azerbaijan joined ADB in 1999 and ADB operations in the country are \nat an early stage, with two approved loans.15. Thus substantive lessons cannot be drawn from \nADB operations in the country. However, the Project was designed with careful consideration of \nthe lessons and experience of development partners in Azerbaijan and ADB\u2019s similar projects in \nother  transition  economies.  The  following  three  lessons  are  particularly  relevant.  First,  road \ninfrastructure  investments  must  be  accompanied  by  effective  policy  dialogue  and  institutional \nstrengthening  to  maximize  development  impact.  Substantive  policy  dialogue  on  sector  issues \n(e.g.,  road  maintenance,  axle-load  control,  and  road  safety)  was  conducted  during  project \npreparation and consequently strong policy content is included in the Project. Second, projects \ninvolving  improvement  of  roads  to  borders  should  address  cross-border  issues,  to  the  extent \npossible.  The  Project  includes  a  component  to  address  physical  and  institutional  barriers  at \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  border  with  Georgia  at  Red  Bridge  to  facilitate  cross-border  movements.  Third, \nRTSD staff has limited knowledge of operational policies and procedures of multilateral financial \ninstitutions  including  ADB,  which  resulted  in  prolonged  negotiations  on  EBRD  loans  and  an \ninitial delay in implementing the World Bank-assisted road project. Close ADB supervision and \nprovision  of  consulting  services  are  necessary  to  support  project  management  and  avoid \nimplementation  delays.  Under  the  Project,  substantive  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to \nhelp  with  project  management  and  implementation.  ADB  will  monitor  project  implementation \nclosely through the executing agencies\u2019 progress reports and its review missions. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  accelerated  socioeconomic  development  in  the  six \nrayons of west Azerbaijan and enhanced regional cooperation. The outcome will be increased \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2005.

The  Project  covers  six  rayons  (Agstafa,  Ganja,  Goranboy,  Khanlar,  Qazakh,  and \nYevlakh) in west Azerbaijan, with total population of about 702,400. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nImprovement  of  the  East\u2013West  Highway  (Yevlakh\u2013Ganja  and  Qazakh\u2013\nGeorgian Border Sections) \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  a  127  km,  two-lane  paved  road  on  two  sections  of  the  east\u2013\n\n16. \nwest  highway:  (i)  the  section  between  Yevlakh  and  Ganja  via  the  Ganja  bypass  (89  km),  and  \n(ii)  the  section  between  Qazakh  and  the  Georgian  border  at  Red  Bridge  (38  km).  The  project \nroad  will  conform  to  Azerbaijan\u2019s  standards  for  a  category  II  road,  with  a  7.5-meter  (m)-wide \npavement and 3.75 m shoulders. It will be designed for a speed of 120 km per hour and have \ncumulative  13-ton  axle  loading  over  15  years.  It  will  be  consistent  with  future  upgrading  to  a \ncategory  I  road.  Activities  comprise  (i)  civil  works;  (ii)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and  \n(iii)  consulting  services  for  detailed  design,  construction  supervision,  road  safety  audit,  social \nand environmental mitigation, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building. These activities \nwill be allocated $66.9 million (including local taxes and duties). \n\n2. \n\nImprovement of Local Roads \n\n17. \nThe  Project  will  improve  10  local  roads  totaling  about  65  km  in  the  project  area  to \nenhance local communities\u2019 access to the east\u2013west highway. Brief information on these local \nroads is in Appendix 4. The technical standards will be determined during the detailed design of \nthe  Project.  These  local  roads  were  selected  through  extensive  consultations  with  local \nstakeholders. Improvement of these local roads will enable about 8,100 households with more \nthan 29,000 people (a majority of whom are poor) in 21 adjoining villages to have better access \nto  jobs,  markets,  and  social  services  in  Baku,  Ganja,  Qazakh,  and  Yevlakh.  Local  road \nimprovement will be allocated $4.5 million (including local taxes and duties). \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening for the Road Subsector \n\n18. \nThe  Project  will  support  policy  reform  and  improve  governance  in  the  road  subsector \nthrough  institutional  strengthening  with  the  objective  of  building  effective  institutions  for \nsustainable road network management. Consulting services and equipment will be provided to \nassist  in  implementing  the  recommendations  made  under  World  Bank  assistance.  It  will \ncomplement  EBRD  assistance  to  RTSD  to  implement  a  corporate  plan  and  a  financial \nmanagement  system.  The  component  will  be  allocated  $3.0  million  (including  local  taxes  and \nduties). The institutional strengthening component will cover the following four areas: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(a) \n\nreorganization  of \n\nroad  maintenance: \nregional  maintenance  units,  \n(b) support for operation of the regional maintenance units located in the project \narea through capacity building and provision of equipment, (c) implementation of \nfor \nthe  new  pavement  management  system,  (d)  prioritization  of  roads \nmaintenance,  and  (e)  identification  of  alternative  sources  of  maintenance \nfunding; \n\naxle-load  control:  (a)  assessment  of  axle  overloading,  (b)  establishment  of \nvehicle  weigh  stations  along  the  main  roads,  (c)  support  for  operation  of  the \nvehicle  weigh  stations  located  in  the  project  area  through  capacity  building  and \nprovision of equipment, and (d) strengthening of RTSD monitoring; \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nroad  safety:  (a)  implementation  of  the  new  national  road  safety  program \ndeveloped  with  World  Bank  assistance  in  April  2005;  (b)  improvement  of \ndomestic  legislation  and  regulations  on  road  safety;  (c)  development  of  road \naccident monitoring, reporting, and information systems; (d) assistance to RTSD \nin identifying accident black spots on the road network; and (e) capacity building; \nand \n\nproject  management  and  implementation:  (a)  harmonization  of  the  project \nimplementation  structure  for  aid-financed  road  projects,  (b)  preparation  of \noperational  guidelines  on  project  implementation  units,  (c)  development  of \nguidelines on environmental and social assessments and management for road \nprojects, and (d) capacity building. \n\n4. \n\nCross-Border Facilitation \n\n19. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  movements  of  freight  and  passengers  across  Azerbaijan\u2019s \nborder (at Red Bridge) with Georgia by addressing physical and institutional barriers. Activities \ncomprise (i) civil works for improving border infrastructure for customs and frontier guard posts; \n(ii)  provision  of  equipment  for  inspection  of  vehicles  and  passengers;  and  (iii)  consulting \nservices  to  improve  the  existing  cross-border  agreement  between  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia, \nharmonize  and  simplify  cross-border  procedures  and  documentation  in  accordance  with \ninternational  standards,  address  cross-border  security  issues,  and  build  up  the  capacity  of \nofficers  serving  at  the  border.  Cross-border  facilitation  will  be  allocated  $5.8  million  (including \nlocal taxes and duties). \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nfor \n\ntransit \n\nimportant  corridor \n\n20. \nRegional  Cooperation.  The  Project  will  promote  regional  cooperation  by  improving \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  segment  of  the  trans-Caucasian  road  corridor  and  the  facilities  at  Azerbaijan\u2019s \nborder  (Red  Bridge)  with  Georgia,  and  enhancing  the  capacity  of  Azeri  officers  serving  at  the \nborder. The east\u2013west highway forms part of the Asian highway network and has the potential \nto  become  an \ntraffic  between  Asia  and  Europe.  \nThe majority of this highway has been or is being improved with external assistance; the Project \nwill improve the missing link of the highway. RTSD and the State Customs Committee will work \ntogether  to  implement  the  Project.  Successful  implementation  of  the  Project  will  contribute  to \nincreasing traffic and trade among Azerbaijan, Georgia, and other countries in the region. \n \n21. \nPolicy  Dialogue  and  Institutional  Strengthening.  Investment  in  roads  should  be \nlinked  to  a  strong  commitment  to  policy  reform  and  institution  building.  Given  that  road \nmaintenance, axle loading, and road safety are the main road subsector issues in Azerbaijan, \nADB  held  intensive  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  these  issues  during  project \npreparation.  ADB  assisted  the  Government  in  developing  a  road  maintenance  program  that \nenvisages a gradual increase in maintenance funding to cover the entire road network by 2015. \nBecause the limited institutional capacity in the road subsector constitutes a major constraint to \naddressing  these  issues,  the  Project  includes  a  strong  institutional  strengthening  component, \nwhich will enhance RTSD\u2019s capacity for road  maintenance, axle-load control, and road safety. \nThis  component  will  supplement  road  infrastructure  investment  to  achieve  sustainable \ndevelopment.  The  Project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  support  for  building  effective  institutions  in  Azerbaijan \nfor sustainable road management based on commercial principals. ADB will continue assistance \nin this direction under future road projects.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nStakeholder  Participation  and  Consultation.  During  project  preparation,  ADB  held \n22. \nextensive consultations with various stakeholders including representatives of central and local \ngovernments,  civil  society,  local  communities,  the  private  sector,  road  users,  and  external  aid \nagencies.  More  than  500  participated  (Appendix  5).  The  consultations  covered  major  issues \nsuch  as  project  alternatives,  selection  of  local  roads,  potential  benefits,  and  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts.  The  results  showed  a  high  degree  of  public  support  for  the  Project.  \nThe  project  design  has  incorporated  the  views  of  stakeholders.  Stakeholder  participation  and \nconsultation will continue during project implementation. \n \n23. \nAid  Harmonization  of  Project  Implementation  Arrangements.  Aid-funded  road \ninvestment projects are currently implemented primarily using individual project implementation \nunits  (PIUs)16  in  Azerbaijan.  In  April  2005  the  World  Bank  proposed  establishment  of  a  larger \nPIU to replace the existing one for implementing its road projects. In accordance with ongoing \nefforts  to  harmonize  the  implementation  structure  for  aid-funded  projects,  during  project \npreparation  ADB  proposed,  and  the  World  Bank  and  EBRD  agreed,  that  the  PIU  will  be \nreorganized to manage  implementation of all road projects supported by the three institutions. \nThe Project will enhance the PIU\u2019s capacity through preparation of operational guidelines; staff \ntraining;  and  financing  for  staff,  equipment,  and  operating  expenses  needed  for  project \nimplementation.  This  harmonized  PIU  structure  will  improve  the  efficiency  of  managing  aid-\nfinanced  projects, \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s administrative resource constraints, and contribute to enhancing RTSD\u2019s capacity \nfor project management. \n\nfacilitate  aid  coordination  on  project \n\nimplementation,  mitigate \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n24. \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest,  and  other \ncharges  during  construction,  is  estimated  at  $93.2  million  equivalent.  The  cost  estimates  are \nsummarized in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 6. \n \n\nTable 2: Project Cost Estimates \n\n1.  Road Improvement Component \n2.

The  OCR  loan  will  finance  the  road  improvement  and  cross-border \nfacilitation components as well as project management, while the loan from the Special Funds \nresources will finance the institutional strengthening component. \n \n26. \nThe ADB loans will finance 55.8% of the total project cost. The OCR loan will have a 24-\nyear  term  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  loan  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  will  have  a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreement. \n \n27. \nIsDB and the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) will provide loans of $10.4 million and \n$11.0 million equivalent, respectively, to cofinance the Project on a parallel basis. The IsDB and \nSFD  loans  will  finance  civil  works  and  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision  for \nimproving  about  50  km  from  Yevlakh  to  Ganja.  The  IsDB  loan,  which  was  approved  on  \n6 February 2005, has a maturity of 25 years including a grace period of 7 years. The SFD loan, \nwhich is expected to be approved within 2005, will have a maturity of 20 years including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years  with  an  interest  rate  of  3%  per  annum.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nremainder of the total project cost ($19.8 million) including local taxes and duties. The proposed \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 3. \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n  Ordinary capital resources \n  Special Funds resources \nIslamic Development Bank \nSaudi Fund for Development \nAzerbaijan Governmenta \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nTotal Cost  ($ million) \n\nPercent of Project Cost \n\n \n\n \n\n49.0 \n3.0 \n10.4 \n11.0 \n19.8 \n93.2 \n\n52.6 \n3.2 \n11.2 \n11.8 \n21.2 \n100.0 \n\n28. \nThe  executing  agencies  will  be  RTSD  for  the  road  improvement  and  institutional \nstrengthening  components,  and  the  State  Customs  Committee  (SCC)  for  the  cross-border \nfacilitation  component.  In  line  with  efforts  to  harmonize  the  implementation  structure  for  aid-\nfinanced  projects,  the  existing  PIU  in  RTSD  will  be  reorganized  to  manage  all  road  projects \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nsupported by ADB, EBRD, and World Bank, including ADB-funded activities under the Project.17 \nThis  joint  PIU  is  justifiable  because  RTSD  is  newly  established  and  has  limited  capacity  for \nproject  management  and  implementation.  The  PIU  will  comprise  RTSD  staff  and  externally \ncontracted staff to supplement limited human resources in RTSD. It will be headed by a project \ndirector,  who  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of  qualified  technical,  financial,  and  support  staff.  \nADB  will  finance  staff,  equipment,  and  operating  expenses  in  the  PIU  needed  for  project \nimplementation  from  its  OCR  loan.18  ADB  financing  for  PIU  costs  is  justifiable  because  \n(i)  RTSD\u2019s  limited  capacity  for  project  management  and  implementation  needs  to  be \ncomplemented, and (ii) this is an integral part of ADB\u2019s support for road subsector institutional \nstrengthening.  The  Government  has  given  assurance  that,  upon  completion  of  the  present \nprojects, PIU staff will be integrated in RTSD to implement future projects. SCC will appoint a \nproject  coordinator  to  manage  implementation  of  the  cross-border  facilitation  component  and \nliaise with RTSD and other relevant government agencies during implementation. \n \n29. \nA  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  ensure  close  interagency \ncoordination and supervise implementation. The PSC will be chaired by the RTSD director and \nwill  comprise  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  Ministry  of  Finance, \nMinistry of Transport, PIU project director, and the SCC project coordinator. Representatives of \nrelevant local communities will be invited to PSC meetings for local road improvement. The PSC \nwill  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  review  implementation  progress  and  provide  approvals  and \nguidance on project implementation as necessary. \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  4  years,  with  estimated  completion  by \n\n30. \nNovember 2009. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n31. \nADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Civil  works  will  be  divided  into  15  contracts;  ADB  will  finance  14  and  IsDB  and \nSFD will jointly finance one. ADB-funded civil works contracts for improving the Yevlakh\u2013Ganja \nand  Qazakh\u2013Georgian  border  road  sections  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding  procedures.  The  civil  works  contracts  for  improving  local  roads  and  cross-border \nfacilities at Red Bridge will be procured through local competitive bidding procedures acceptable \nto ADB, since these contracts will cost no more than $2.0 million each and domestic contractors \nare  capable  of  undertaking  such  work.  Procurement  of  equipment  for  border  inspection,  road \nmaintenance,  and  weighing  vehicles  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nThe proposed ADB-financed contract packages are in Appendix 8. \n \nADB  approved  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  on  10  May  2005.  \n32. \nThe  advance  procurement  action  will  cover  selecting  a  consulting  firm  for  detailed  design  and \nconstruction  supervision,  prequalifying  contractors,  tendering,  and  bid  evaluation,  but  will  not \ninclude contract awards. The advance action will be undertaken according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB  approval  of  advance  procurement \n\n                                                 \n17 This  PIU  will  replace  the  existing  one  for  implementing  the  World  Bank-assisted  Highway  Project  and  EBRD-\nassisted Silk Road Project. IsDB and SFD will use IsDB\u2019s existing project management unit for the Ujar\u2013Yevlakh \nRoad Reconstruction Project to implement their funded project activities. \n\n18 Specifically,  ADB  will  finance  salaries  of  a  highway  engineer,  procurement  specialist,  financial  specialist, \n\nadministrative assistant, and driver, as well as related office equipment and supplies in the PIU. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\naction does not commit ADB to finance the Project and that ADB will not finance expenses paid \nby the Government prior to loan effectiveness. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n(10 \n\ninternational  and  20  domestic) \n\n33. \nThe Project will require 993 person-months of consulting services (104 international and \n889 domestic). RTSD will engage (i) a consulting firm for 869 person-months (64 international \nand 805 domestic) for detailed design and construction supervision for improving the east\u2013west \nhighway  and  local  roads,  and  (ii)  a  consulting  firm  for  94  person-months  (30  international  and  \n64  domestic)  for  institutional  strengthening.  SCC  will  engage  individual  consultants  for  \n30  person-months \nfacilitation.  \nThe  Government  requested  that  the  international  consultants  collaborate  with  the  domestic \nconsultants.  ADB  will  finance  consulting  services  for  detailed  design  for  all  the  project  roads; \nconstruction  supervision  for  ADB-financed  sections;  institutional  strengthening;  procurement \nsupport;  resettlement,  social,  poverty,  and  environmental  monitoring;  and  cross-border \nfacilitation.  IsDB  will  finance  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision  for  the  section \nfunded  by  the  IsDB  and  SFD  loans.  ADB-financed  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged \naccording  to  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  its \nBorrowers  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. ADB-funded consulting firms will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method  under  full  technical  proposals.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in supplementary appendixes A and B. \n\nfor  cross-border \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n34. \nThe  ADB  loans  will  be  disbursed  according  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  \nFor  consulting  services,  civil  works,  and  equipment  following  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures,  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  using  direct  payment.  For  civil  works  following  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures and PIU expenses financed from the OCR loan, reimbursement \nprocedures will be applied through the imprest account. The Ministry of Finance will open, after \nloan effectiveness, an imprest account in a commercial bank in Azerbaijan acceptable to ADB. \nThe  combined  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  estimated  expenses  for  \n6  months  or  10%  of  the  OCR  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  Any  individual  payment  to  be \nreimbursed  or  liquidated  under  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  not  exceed \n$100,000 equivalent. \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n35. \nRTSD  and  SCC  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and \nwill have them audited annually according to sound auditing standards by independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The annual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditures. RTSD will submit to ADB certified copies of \nconsolidated  annual  audited  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  as  well  as  the \nauditor\u2019s  report  in  English  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year  during  project \nimplementation.  RTSD  and  SCC  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  timely  submission  of \naudited project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements of the \nADB loans in case of noncompliance with the requirement. RTSD and SCC will jointly prepare \nand submit to ADB (i) quarterly progress reports during project implementation, and (ii) a project \ncompletion report within 3 months of project completion to facilitate project postevaluation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n36. \nA set of targets/indicators for monitoring and evaluation of project performance relating \nto the project impact, outcome, and outputs were discussed and finalized with the Government, \nRTSD,  and  SCC  during  loan  appraisal  (key  performance  indicators/targets  are  provided  in \nAppendix  1).  With  assistance  of  the  PIU,  SCC  project  coordinator,  and  the  supervision \nconsultant, RTSD will establish a project performance management system acceptable to ADB. \nThe  baseline  values \nto \nimplementation. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by sex. Baseline surveys will \nbe conducted annually and the findings included in the project completion report. At inception, \nproject completion, and 3 years after completion, RTSD and SCC will jointly prepare and submit \nto ADB a report that summarizes the key findings of project monitoring and evaluation. \n\nfully  established  prior \n\nindicators  will  be \n\nfor  project \n\nimpact \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n37. \nIn addition to annual regular reviews by ADB staff, the Government and ADB will jointly \nundertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  in  2007  to  assess  (i)  implementation  status,  \n(ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii)  performance  of  consultants  and  contractors,  \n(iv) project impacts, (v) progress of sector reform, (vi) status of compliance with the covenants \nstipulated  in  the  loan  agreements,  and  (vii)  the  need  for  any  changes  in  the  project  scope  or \nschedule to achieve the project impact. \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\nDuring project preparation, ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed \n38. \nwith  the  Government,  RTSD,  and  SCC.  The  Government,  RTSD,  and  SCC  agreed  to  follow \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  during  project  implementation.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly, or through its agencies, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices \nrelated  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. If ADB \ndetermines that representatives of the borrower, a beneficiary, a contractor, and/or a consultant \nengaged  in  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices,  ADB  may  take  the  following \nactions:  (i)  reject  any  proposal  for  contract  award;  and/or  (ii)  declare  any  firm  or  individual \nineligible for award of any ADB-financed contracts, indefinitely or for a stated period of time.  \n \nfollowing  anticorruption  measures:  \n39. \n(i)  anticorruption  provisions  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  included  in  all  bidding  documents  and \ncontracts,  including  provisions  specifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts of the executing agencies and all contracts, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project; (ii) all decisions relating to procurement will be made by \nthe  Tendering  Committee,  which  comprises  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, State Customs Committee, and State \nProcurement  Agency,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the \nProcurement  Law  of  Azerbaijan;  (iii)  functioning  as  the  engineer  under  FIDIC19  conditions,  the \nsupervision  consultant  will  verify  the  contractors\u2019  payment  claims  in  accordance  with  contract \nspecifications;  and  (iv)  ADB-financed  independent  auditors  will  be  engaged  to  audit  project \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  and  certified  copies  of  the  audited  documents  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. The Project will also improve \n\nSpecifically,  RTSD  and  SCC  will \n\ntake \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n19 FIDIC \u2013 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils, the International Federation of Consulting Engineers.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\ngovernance at the broader subsector level through the institutional strengthening component to \nenhance RTSD\u2019s capacity for managing road maintenance, axle-load control, road safety, and \nproject implementation. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\nThe  Project  will  benefit  people  living  along  the  Yevlakh\u2013Ganja  and  Qazakh\u2013Georgian \n40. \nborder  sections  of  the  east\u2013west  highway;  road  users;  construction  companies;  traders;  and \nother  people  who  derive  income  from  expanded  traffic,  trade,  and  investment  in  the  region.  \nThe major direct benefits will include (i) lower road transport and maintenance costs, (ii) faster \nand more reliable road transport services, (iii) improved access of local communities to markets \nand social services, (iv) jobs and income created during project implementation (i.e., use of local \nlabor  and  construction  materials)  and  after  project  completion  (i.e.,  roadside  businesses),  \n(v)  efficient  movement  of  freight  and  passengers  across  Azerbaijan\u2019s  border  (at  Red  Bridge) \nwith  Georgia,  and  (vi)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  in  the  road  subsector.  The  Project  is \nexpected to create 5,250 person-months of skilled jobs at about $400 per person per month and \n3,000 person-months of unskilled jobs at about $200 per person per month. Indirect benefits will \nbe  increased  business  and  job  opportunities  that  have  backward  or  forward  linkages  to  the \nProject, and growing trade among Azerbaijan, Georgia, and other countries in the region. \n \n41. \nA  distribution  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  will  result  in  total  net  benefits  of  $71.8 \nmillion, comprising $44.0 million for passengers, $11.6 million for freight operators, $15.9 million \nfor the Government, and $0.3 million for labor. Road users (passengers and freight operators) \nare the largest beneficiary group, accounting for 77.5% of the total net project benefits. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n42. \nTraffic  forecasts  were  made  for  the  project  road  for  2005\u22122028  based  on  the  traffic \nsurveys conducted during project preparation, projected growth of GDP and population, as well \nas  the  estimated  income  elasticity  of  demand.  Based  on  economic  and  population  growth \nprojections,  passenger  traffic  on  the  project  road  is  forecast  to  grow  annually  by  7.8%  for \n2005\u22122009  and  6.8%  for  2010\u22122028,  while  freight  traffic  on  the  project  road  is  projected  to \nincrease  annually  by  7.5%  and  6.0%  for  the  respective  periods.  These  traffic  forecasts  are \nreasonable  compared  with  actual  annual  growth  of  combined  freight  and  passenger  traffic \nduring  1999\u20132005,  which  was  9.9%  on  the  Yevlax\u2013Ganja  section  and  9.5%  on  the  Qazakh\u2013\nGeorgian border section. \n \n43. \nThe economic analysis of the Project compares the with- and without-project cases and \nweights project benefits against project costs. The analysis is based on 2005 prices and covers \n24 years (2005\u22122028), comprising 4 years of project implementation and 20 years of operation \n(Appendix 9). The major project benefits are savings on vehicle operating cost and travel time \ndue to reduced roughness on road surfaces. The benefits from vehicle operating cost savings, \nwhich initially accrue to vehicle owners and operators, will be shared gradually with passengers \nand freight customers through reduced freight charges and bus fares. The Project will contribute \nto reducing road accidents, but such benefits are not quantifiable and thus are not included in \nthe economic analysis. The project costs cover capital investment and maintenance costs. \n \n44. \nThe results show that the Project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate \nof  return  (EIRR)  of  17.9%  and  a  net  present  value  of  $17.0  million  at  a  12%  discount  rate.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  confirms  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability,  with  the  EIRR  remaining \nhigher  than  12.0%  when  (i)  capital  investment  costs  increase  by  20%,  (ii)  project  benefits \ndecrease  by  20%,  (iii)  traffic  growth  declines  by  20%,  or  (iv)  both  capital  investment  costs \nincrease  by  20%  and  project  benefits  decrease  by  20%.  The  risk  analysis  demonstrates  that  \n(i) the Project\u2019s EIRR has a 95 percentile value of 19.3% and a 5 percentile value of 15.5%, and \n(ii) the Project\u2019s net present value has a 95 percentile value of $32.3 million and a 5 percentile \nvalue of $8.1 million. The risk analysis further confirms the Project\u2019s economic robustness. \n \nThe  Project  is  not  a  revenue-earning  project  that  requires  a  financial  analysis.  \n45. \nAn analysis of the fiscal impact of the Project was made to assess counterpart funding for, and \ndebt  repayment  from,  the  Project.  The  Government  has  committed  to  provide  counterpart \nfunding of $19.8 million during project implementation. The external debt burden in Azerbaijan \nremains moderate, with the stock of public and publicly guaranteed debt at 18.6% of GDP and \nthe  debt service  ratio  at  3.7%  in  2004.  Given  the  projection  of  continued  growth  in  Azerbaijan \nand resultant increase in government revenues over the medium term, the Government is very \nlikely  to  provide  counterpart  funding  in  a  timely  manner  and  the  Project  will  have  a  limited \nimpact  on  the  debt  repayment  situation  in  the  country.  The  Project  is  thus  deemed  financially \nsustainable. \n\nC. \n\nProject Impacts \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n46. \nThe  Project  does  not  require  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  as  road \nimprovement  activities  are  largely  confined  to  the  existing  alignment.  Minor  realignment  may \nrequire  land  acquisition,  but  will  have  no  impact  on  structures.  Temporary  land  occupation  for \nborrow  areas,  disposal  areas,  and  construction  camps  during  construction  will  require \ncompensation for loss of crops or trees. In 2004, the Government initiated a national program to \nclear  structures  within  the  road  reserve.  For  the  project  road,  an  inventory  identified  \n213 businesses and residences within the road reserve; 61 nontitled roadside businesses were \nremoved  along  the  Yevlakh\u2013Ganja  section.  The  owners  of  most  of  these  businesses  were \naware  that  they  would  need  to  remove  the  businesses  at  their  own  expenses  according  to \ndomestic  laws.  Local  authorities  and  RTSD  assisted  in  removing  these  businesses  and \nacquiring  land  plots  for  the  owners  to  build  permanent  shops.  So  far,  29  businesses  are \noperating  in  their  new  shops,  24  businesses  are  under  construction,  and  8  businesses  are \nawaiting approval of land certificates. The businesses investigated by ADB staff during project \npreparation were satisfied with the removal procedures and the support received. \n \n47. \nRTSD has prepared a resettlement plan, the first resettlement document for aid-financed \nroad projects in Azerbaijan (supplementary appendix C).  The summary resettlement plan is in \nAppendix 10. The resettlement plan provides the compensation standards and entitlements for \naffected  land,  housing,  businesses,  trees,  attachments,  and  public  infrastructure  according  to \ndomestic laws and regulations as well as ADB\u2019s  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. The plan \nincludes retrofit measures for eligible businesses removed and measures for future resettlement \nimpacts during the upgrading of the highway and local roads, and clearance of the road reserve. \nThe  plan  was  disclosed  to  local  governments  and  affected  people  on  14  June  2005.  RTSD \nagreed to suspend further demolition of structures from the road reserve until ADB approves the \nresettlement  plan.  When  detailed  design  is  completed  in  2006,  RTSD  will  update  the  plan, \ndisclose it to those affected, and submit it for ADB approval prior to the commencement of civil \nworks. The Ecology and Safety Section, Road Maintenance Division of RTSD is responsible for \nupdating  the  resettlement  plan  and  supervising  its  implementation.  RTSD  will  engage  an \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nindependent  monitor  acceptable  to  ADB  to  carry  out  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nresettlement impacts during project implementation. \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction, Social, and Gender Impacts \n\n48. \nThe Project will benefit about 261,000 poor people (37.2% of total project beneficiaries) \nin  the  project  area;  the  total  benefits  to  be  received  by  the  poor  are estimated  at  $7.1  million. \nAlthough the project benefits for the poor are relatively small, the Project will create an enabling \nenvironment  for  poverty  reduction.  The  major  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  the  Project  will \ninclude  (i)  reduced  prices  of  transport  services,  food,  and  other  daily  necessities  due  to  lower \ntransport costs; (ii) jobs and income for the poor in road improvement and maintenance as well \nas  roadside  businesses;  and  (iii)  improved  access  of  the  poor  to  markets  and  social  services.  \nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n49. \nThe  Project  has  no  impact  on  indigenous  peoples.  Ethnic Azeri  accounts  for  98.6%  of \nthe  population  in  the  project  area;  few  other  nationalities  include  Kurds,  Russian,  and  Turks.  \nThe  minorities  are  neither  indigenous  nor  negatively  affected  by  the  Project.  The  Project  will \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  gender,  because  the  civil  works  contracts  will  include  provisions  to \nencourage  employment  of  women  during  project  implementation,  and  the  Project  will  promote \nwomen\u2019s participation in activities to monitor project impacts on local communities. \n \nIn  2004,  718  HIV/AIDS20  cases  (including  38  cases  in  the  project  area)  were  reported. \n50. \nConstruction  workers,  truck  drivers,  sex  workers,  and  intravenous  drug  users  are  among  the \ngroups  at  high  risks  of  HIV  infection.  The  International  Medical  Corp  is  implementing  an \nHIV/AIDS awareness and prevention program in the project area, which includes (i) training to \nlocal  communities, \ntruck  drivers,  doctors,  and  nurses;  (ii)  condom  distribution;  and  \n(iii) improvement of local health facilities. All civil works bidding documents and contracts under \nthe Project will include provisions requiring contractors to take measures to protect construction \nworkers  and  local  residents,  especially  women,  from  potential  risks  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other \nsexually transmitted infections. These measures include raising public awareness of the risks of \nHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, and giving construction workers time to be \ntested or receive treatment. \n \n51. \nThe  Project  includes  appropriate  measures  to  mitigate  the  potential  risk  of  drug  and \nhuman  trafficking.  The  provision  of  inspection  equipment  at  the  border  of  Red  Bridge  and \ncapacity  building  for  officers  serving  at  the  border  will  greatly  assist  in  preventing  drug  and \nhuman trafficking. The roadside stations that will be included in the detailed project design will \noffer  a  venue  for  advocacy  and  awareness  campaigns  on  prevention  of  drug  and  human \ntrafficking  in  the  future.  ADB  is  undertaking  a  study  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  in \nAzerbaijan. Based on the findings, ADB will consider an appropriate modality of assistance. \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n52. \nThe Project is classified as Category B. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nundertaken  (supplementary  appendix  D)  and  the  summary  IEE  is  in  Appendix  12.  The  IEE \nconcludes  that  the  Project  will  have  no  major  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment,  as  road \nimprovement will be primarily carried out on the existing alignment. Minor realignments may be \nmade  within  the  road  reserve  to  ensure  the  horizontal  radii  and  forward  sight  distances  are \nsuitable for the designed speed. Temporary use of land adjacent to the project road, removal of \n\n                                                 \n20 HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nroadside  vegetation,  temporary  land-take  for  the  site  of  the  contractor\u2019s  yard,  as  well  as  the \nextraction and transport of construction material from borrow sites will have temporary impacts \non  the  environment  during  project  implementation.  No  protected  or  environmentally  sensitive \nareas  such  as  designated  wetlands,  forests,  nature  conservation  areas,  and  places  of \narchaeological importance are within or near the project area. \n \n53. \nThe mitigation measures identified in the IEE include (i) carefully selecting construction \nsites, borrow areas, and quarries and restoring them soon after project completion; (ii) avoiding \naggravation of soil erosion-prone areas; (iii) controlling sewage discharge and other waste fluids \nfrom construction sites, and hazardous and toxic materials from asphalt and crushing plants and \nfrom  construction  equipment;  (iv)  maintaining  proper  drainage  to  avoid  stagnation  and \ncontrolling downstream water pollution; (v) reinstating vegetation and trees that are affected by \nconstruction  activities  but  are  needed  to  prevent  soil  erosion;  (vi)  controlling  disturbances  to \nanimals  and  pastures;  and  (vii)  minimizing  noise,  dust,  emissions,  and  other  pollutants \nassociated  with  civil  works.  The  civil  works  contractors  will  take  these  mitigation  measures, \nwhile  the  supervision  consultant,  RTSD,  and  concerned  government  environmental  agencies \nwill monitor their implementation. \n\nD. \n\nProject Assumptions and Risks \n\nThe Project was designed based on the following key assumptions: (i) continued political \n54. \nstability  and  economic  growth  in  Azerbaijan  and  the  region,  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  continued \ncommitment to regional cooperation, (iii) effective implementation of the Government\u2019s transport \ndevelopment  program  (2005\u20132014),  (iv)  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funding,  and  (v)  timely \ncofinancing from IsDB and SFD. \n \n55. \nThe  Project\u2019s  major  potential  risk  is  that  the  project  roads  after  completion  may \nexperience  a  higher  than  anticipated  rate  of  deterioration  due  to  axle  overloading  and \ninadequate  funding  for  maintenance.  Because  the  limited  institutional  capacity  in  the  road \nsubsector constitutes a major constraint to addressing these issues, the Project will mitigate this \nrisk through institutional strengthening assistance to the road subsector, accompanied by loan \nconditionality. The Project will help enforce axle-load regulations by assisting RTSD to establish \nand operate vehicle weigh stations along the main roads and improve monitoring. During project \npreparation, ADB assisted the Government in developing a road maintenance program, which \nenvisages a steady increase in maintenance funding to cover the entire road network by 2015. \nThe Government is committed to implementing the road maintenance program. The Project will \nsupport implementation of the program by assisting RTSD in reorganizing regional maintenance \nunits,  prioritizing  roads  for  maintenance,  utilizing  the  newly  developed pavement  management \nsystem,  and  identifying  alternative  sources  for  maintenance  funding.  Given  the  complexity  of \nthese issues, the Project is ADB\u2019s first support for building effective institutions in Azerbaijan for \nsustainable road management according to commercial principals. ADB will continue assistance \nin this direction under future road projects. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  RTSD,  and  SCC  have  given \n\n56. \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nCounterpart funding. The Government will provide, on a timely basis, all funds \nnecessary for improvement, operation, and maintenance of the project facilities.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  RTSD  and  SCC  successfully  implement  their \nrespective project components, and operate and maintain them after completion. \n\nConstruction  quality.

The  Government  will  ensure  that  a  road  maintenance \nprogram  covering  the  country\u2019s  road  network  and  based  on  the  recently \nintroduced pavement management system is fully implemented. \n\nAxle  loads.  The  Government  will  cause  RTSD  to  fully  establish  vehicle  weigh \nstations along the main roads in Azerbaijan, including two stations located in the \nproject area to enforce the axle-load regulations prior to project completion. \n\nProject  management.  In  the  interest  of  providing  continuity  for  project \nmanagement,  the  PIU  project  director  will  serve  in  the  position  throughout  the \nproject  implementation  period,  except  in  case  of  gross  dereliction  of  duties  or \nsuch  other  serious  cause,  provided  that  such  a  determination  is  made  through \nappropriate  due  process.  The  Government,  through  RTSD,  will  provide  the  PIU \nwith  adequate  office  space  and  support  services  in  a  form  satisfactory  to  ADB \nthroughout  the  implementation  period.  The  Government,  through  RTSD,  will \nensure  that,  upon  project  completion,  PIU  staff  is  integrated  in  RTSD  to \nimplement future projects. \n\nProject auditing. The Government will cause RTSD and  SCC to  (a)  undertake \ntimely  audit  of  project  accounts  according  to  sound  auditing  standards  by  an \nexternal  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  (b)  submit  to  ADB  audited  project \naccounts and related financial statements in English within 6 months of the end \nof each fiscal year during implementation. \n\nSafeguard  policies  and  cofinancing.  The  Government  will  (a)  inform  the \ncofinancers  in  writing  of  its  obligation  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement and Environment Policy, and the steps that it will take \nto  comply  with  such  policies;  and  (b)  immediately  inform  ADB  if  any  cofinancer \nobjects  to  the  Government  complying  with  ADB\u2019s  such  policies.  All  project \nactivities  financed  by  the  cofinancers  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with \nADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Environment Policy. \n\n(viii)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government,  through  RTSD  and \nconcerned local authorities, will ensure that (a) all land and rights-of-way required \nby the  Project are made available in a timely  manner; (b) the resettlement plan \nprepared by RTSD and acceptable to ADB is implemented according to its terms, \nall  applicable  domestic  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement; (c) the plan is updated based on detailed design, and the updated \nresettlement  plan  is  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  and  disclosed  to  affected \npersons  prior  to  the  commencement  of  civil  works;  (d)  no  further  road  reserve \nclearance is undertaken in the project area until a socioeconomic assessment of \naffected persons is completed and appropriate mitigation measures are included \nin  the  updated  resettlement  plan;  (e)  civil  works  contractors\u2019  activities  are  in \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\ncompliance with requirements of the resettlement plan, applicable domestic laws \nand  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement;  and  (f)  an \nindependent monitor acceptable to ADB is engaged to carry out monitoring and \nevaluation and report to ADB. \n\nEnvironment.  The  Government,  through  RTSD,  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  project \ndesign,  improvement,  and  operation  comply  with  applicable  domestic  laws, \nregulations,  and  standards; \n(b)  all  environmental  mitigation  measures, \ninstitutional requirements, and monitoring plans specified in the IEE are complied \nwith; (c) the mitigation measures are updated during the detailed design; and (d) \nall  the  above  requirements  are  incorporated  in  the  bidding  documents  and  civil \nworks contracts to ensure compliance. \n\nits  commitment \n\nGovernance  and  anticorruption.  The  Government,  through  RTSD  and  SCC, \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. The Government acknowledges that ADB, \nconsistent  with \nto  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  reserves  the  right  to  undertake  directly,  or  through  its  agents, \ninvestigation  of  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices \nrelated to the Project. The Government will cooperate with such investigation and \nextend  all  necessary  assistance  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and \nrecords, and engaging independent experts who may be needed for satisfactory \ncompletion of such investigations. All costs related to such investigations will be \nborne by the Project. The Government, through RTSD and SCC, will ensure that \nthe  following  anticorruption  measures  during  project  implementation  are  taken: \n(a)  anticorruption  provisions  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  included  in  all  bidding \ndocuments and contracts, including provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies  and  all  contracts, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project; \n(b)  all  decisions  relating  to  procurement  will  be  made  by  the  Tendering \nCommittee,  which  comprises  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Transport,  State  Customs \nCommittee,  and  State  Procurement  Agency, \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement and the Procurement Law of Azerbaijan; and (c) the \nsupervision consultant will  verify  the  contractors\u2019  payment  claims  in  accordance \nwith contract specifications. \n\nLabor  laws.  The  Government,  through  RTSD  and  SCC,  will  ensure  that  civil \nworks contractors comply with all applicable labor laws and regulations as well as \ninternational treaties, do not employ child or forced labor for road improvement, \nprovide  equal  opportunities  for  women  in  road  improvement  activities,  and \npromptly pay equal wages to men and women for work of equal value. RTSD and \nSCC will ensure that specific provisions to this effect are included in all bidding \ndocuments  and  civil  works  contracts  and  that  compliance  is  monitored  on  an \nongoing basis. \n\n(xii)  Gender and development. The Government, through RTSD and SCC, will take \nto  employ  women  during  project \nmeasures \nimplementation and promote women\u2019s participation in activities to monitor project \nimpacts  on  local  communities.  RTSD  and  SCC  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is \nimplemented according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. \n\nto  encourage  contractors \n\n(xiii)  Health standards. The Government, through RTSD and SCC, will ensure that all \nbidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts  require  contractors  to  provide  the \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nfollowing  to  construction  workers  at  campsites:  (a)  information  on  the  risk  of \nsexually  transmitted  infections;  and  (b)  benefits  on  accidental  death  and \ndisability, safety and security, sanitation, and appropriate working conditions. The \nGovernment,  through  RTSD,  will  disseminate  similar  information  to  transport \noperators using project facilities and local residents in the project area. \n\n(xiv)  Drug  and  human  trafficking.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  appropriate \nmeasures  are  undertaken  in  accordance  with  applicable  domestic  laws  and \nregulations to prevent trafficking of illegal substances and humans at the border \nof  Red  Bridge  with  Georgia  during  project  implementation  and  after  project \ncompletion. \n\n(xv)  Monitoring and evaluation.

The country\u2019s east\u2013west road and railway routes carry traffic between the Caspian \nand  Black  seas  on  a  section  of  the  \u201csilk  road\u201d  transport  corridor  linking  Asia  to  Europe.  \nThe  country\u2019s  north\u2013south  road  and  rail  routes  connect  the  Russian  Federation  and  Iran.  \nThe transport sector plays an important role in the national economy, accounting for 10.2% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2003. \n \n2. \nLike other sectors, Azerbaijan\u2019s roads are facing the challenges of the transition from a \ncentrally  planned  to  a  market-based  economy.  Although  many  good  laws,  regulations,  and \nprocedures  are  in  place,  the  major  challenge  is  related  to  implementing.  In  this  regard,  a \nnumber of issues need to be addressed, particularly in the areas of road maintenance, axle-load \ncontrol, and road safety. \n \nB. \n\nTransport Demand \n\n3. \nThe transport sector comprises railways, roads, air aviation, sea transport, pipelines, and \nurban  transport.  The  demand  for  freight  and  passenger  transport  by  mode  is  shown  in  Table \nA2.1.  Freight  transport  demand  increased  at  an  annual  average  rate  of  11.6%  during \n2000\u22122003.  Freight  demand  was  mainly  met  by  railways  (35%),  followed  by  sea  transport \n(30%), and roads (28%). Although the volume of freight transport carried by railways is greater \nthan by roads, fundamental differences in type of freight carried result in limited opportunity for \ncompetition and modal shift between railways and roads. The major freight carried by railways is \ncrude  oil  and  refined  oil  products  from  Baku.  While  this  is  expected  to  continue  in  the \nforeseeable  future,  crude  oil  will  be  partially  transported  through  the  recently  opened  Baku\u2013\nTbilisi\u2013Ceyhan oil pipeline. Moreover, freight demand for road transport grew by 21% annually \nduring  2000\u22122003,  more  rapidly  than  for  other  modes  of  transport.  The  potential  for  growth  in \nfreight demand for road transport is significant. As transport demand becomes more diversified, \nspecific  features  such  as  speed,  reliability,  waiting  time,  minimization  of  losses  and  damages, \nand ability to move smaller loads more efficiently will assume greater priority than they did in the \npast.  These  features  will  require  flexible,  cost-effective,  and  responsive  transport  services.  \nRoad transport is better placed than other modes of transport to meet these needs by providing \nefficient services and infrastructure needed to facilitate expected growth. \n \nPassenger transport has grown steadily since 2000; demand is recovering from the low \n4. \npoints experienced in the late 1990s. Roads are the dominant mode of transport, accounting for \nnearly 80% of passenger transport. Civil aviation accounts for 9%, urban transport for 8%, and \nrailways for 7% of the total demand. While the modal share between road and rail transport may \nbe  distorted  by  the  overwhelming  use  of  roads  for  short-distance  urban  trips,  with  continued \neconomic  growth  demand  for  passenger  transport  by  roads  is  expected  to  increase  because \nlocal  and  regional  buses  provide  a  quicker  and  more  convenient  services  than  railways, \nparticularly  to  intermediate  locations.  With  the  improvement  of  the  east\u2013west  and  north\u2013south \nhighways, bus transport operators are expected to provide new buses that will improve services \nand increase the modal share of road transport. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nTable A2.1: Freight and Passenger Transport by Mode in Azerbaijan \n\n \n\n \n\nTransport Mode \n \nRailways \nRoads \nSea \nCivil Aviation \nPipelines \n \n \nRailways \nRoads \nSea \nCivil Aviation \nUrban Transporta \n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n\n1990 \n\n1995 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\nFreight Transport (million ton-kilometers) \n\n37,076 \n3,287 \n5,778 \n47 \n3,353 \n49,541 \n\n1,827 \n7,480 \n68 \n4,869 \n1,721 \n15,965 \n\n2,409 \n527 \n4,325 \n57 \n1,013 \n8,331 \n\n791 \n4,664 \n24 \n1,733 \n6,065 \n13,277 \n\n5,770 \n3,513 \n5,192 \n102 \n1,371 \n15,948 \n\n493 \n9,153 \n6 \n798 \n10,070 \n20,520 \n\n6,141 \n4,843 \n5,744 \n76 \n1,643 \n18,447 \n\n537 \n9,442 \n5 \n827 \n10,372 \n21,183 \n\n6,980 \n5,534 \n6,077 \n84 \n1,602 \n20,277 \n\n584 \n9,603 \n6 \n884 \n10,494 \n21,571 \n\nPassenger Transport (million passenger-kilometers) \n\n2003 \n\n7,719 \n6,241 \n6,555 \n78 \n1,572 \n22,165 \n\n654 \n9,861 \n6 \n1,113 \n10,828 \n22,462 \n\na \n\nIncluding tram, trolley, and subway. \n\nSource: Government of Azerbaijan. 2004.

Approximately 52% of the roads are paved, 47% gravel, and the remaining earth \ntracks. The road network was primarily developed under the former Soviet Union for higher than \ncurrent traffic volumes. Due to lack of resources for maintenance, about 75% of the network is \nin poor condition. Based on the road condition data available, 61% of the east\u2013west and north\u2013\nsouth highways, 76% of other national roads, 66% of secondary roads, and 76% of rural roads \nrequire rehabilitation. In recognition of the importance of improving the road network to facilitate \nsocioeconomic  development,  the  Government  embarked  on  a  transport  development  program \n(2005\u20132014),  starting  with  the  east\u2013west  and  north\u2013south  highways.  The  Government  is  also \nfinalizing a program for improving secondary roads. \n \n\nTable A2.2: Summary of the Road Network in Azerbaijan, 2004 \n\nRoad Category \n\nCategory I \nCategory II  \nCategory III \nCategory IV  \nCategory V \n \n\nTotal \n\nPaved \n\n175 \n851 \n5,537 \n3,244 \n0 \n9,807 \n\nLength (kilometer) \n\nGravel \n0 \n0 \n0 \n7,179 \n1,608 \n8,787 \n\nEarth Track \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n205 \n205 \n\nTotal \n175 \n851 \n5,537 \n10,423 \n1,813 \n18,799 \n\n0 = magnitude zero. \nSource: Road Transport Service Department. \n \n6. \nMost  technical  standards  and  specifications  for  road  design,  construction,  and \nmaintenance  date  from  the  Soviet  era.  Although  the  standards  are  based  on  sound  technical \nprinciples,  they  contain  rigid  criteria  for  upgrading  road  capacity  that  are  based  on  traffic \nvolumes and do not consider the level of services or economic viability. The inappropriateness \nof  such  standards  for  a  market-based  economy  is  widely  recognized;  they  need  updated  to \nmatch the needs and economic resource base in the country. \n \n \n\n\f26 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nD. \n\nVehicle Fleet \n\n7. \nThe use of  motor  vehicles in the country is low  by international standards. The vehicle \nfleet  numbered  486,800  in  2003,  equivalent  to  58  vehicles  per  1,000  people  (Table  A2.3). \nVehicle ownership varies regionally, with an average of 20 vehicles per 100 families nationwide \nin 2003 compared with 30 vehicles in Baku, 26 in Ganja, 20 in Goranboy, and 19 in Yevlakh.1 \nMost  of  the  vehicles  were  produced  before  1990  and  need  to  be  replaced.  The  timely \ncompletion  of  improving  the  country\u2019s  major  highways  will  provide  an  incentive  for  private \ntransport operators to invest in modernization of vehicle fleet. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Ownership of Vehicles in Azerbaijan (\u2018000 units) \n \n1999\n306.9\n14.9\n69.7\n9.3\n17.7\n418.5\n\n1990 \n260.2 \n14.0 \n99.5 \n37.6 \n25.1 \n436.4 \n\n1995\n278.3 \n12.8 \n79.7 \n13.3 \n21.4 \n405.5 \n\n2000\n332.0\n16.8\n78.6\n6.4\n13.3\n447.1\n\n2001\n343.0\n17.3\n77.1\n6.7\n14.3\n458.4\n\n2002 \n350.6 \n17.4 \n76.9 \n8.3 \n12.5 \n465.7 \n\nVehicle Type \nCars \nBuses \nTrucks \nMotorcycles \nOther \n \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Government of Azerbaijan. 2004.

The decree also outlines \nthe basic relations between stakeholders in the road subsector. \n \n9. \nPrior  to  2003,  Azeravtoyol,  a  state  joint  stock  company,  managed  the  road  subsector. \nAzeravtoyol  was  formed  in  1993  and  modeled  around  centralized  decision-making  processes, \nbureaucracy,  and  administration  procedures  inherited  from  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Because \nthe  organization  was  weak  and  could  not  perform  its  functions  properly,  the  Government \ndissolved  Azeravtoyol  and  in  2003  established  the  Ministry  of  Transport  to  assume  overall \nresponsibility  for  policy,  regulations,  and  administration  of  the  transport  sector.  The  road \nsubsector  falls  under  the  responsibility  of  two  departments  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport:  Road \nTransport  Service  Department  (RTSD)  and  Auto  Transport  Service  Department.  RTSD  is \nresponsible for planning, managing, and maintaining the road network infrastructure. RTSD has \na headquarters unit in Baku with 90 staff and 61 regional units with approximately 3,000 staff, \nprimarily responsible for individual rayons. An organization structure of RTSD headquarters is in \nFigure  A2.  The  Auto  Transport  Service  Department  is  responsible  for  formulating  and \nimplementing  regulations  on  passenger  and  freight  transport  services,  including  (i)  intercity \npassenger  services,  (ii)  freight  transport  services,  (iii)  foreign  vehicles  entering  and  leaving \nAzerbaijan, (iv) vehicle emission requirements, and (v) coordination with transport ministries in \nother countries. \n \nThe  creation  of  RTSD  to  replace  Azeravtoyol  is  a  major  achievement.  RTSD  received \n10. \nassistance  from  the  World  Bank  for  institutional  strengthening  during  2003\u2013April  2005.  This \nprogram covered 11 areas, with the major components including (i) developing a corporate plan, \n(ii)  reviewing  road  user  charges,  (iii)  establishing  a  pavement  management  system,  \n(iv) formulating a financial management system, (v) developing a multiyear rolling budget, and \n\n                                                 \n1  Republic of Azerbaijan. 2004.

Since the abolition of the Road Fund in 2001, all revenues from taxes related to roads \nhave been credited to government budgets. Currently three taxes are involved: transit fees (on \nforeign vehicles), annual vehicle tax, and fuel tax.  \n \n12. \nRoad expenses are financed primarily by the Government through budgetary allocation \nto  RTSD.  RTSD\u2019s  total  expenses  for  2003  amounted  to  AZM93.0  billion  ($19.2  million), \ncomprising AZM70.0 billion ($14.5 million) for capital and recurrent expenditures and AZM23.0 \nbillion  ($4.7  million)  for  salaries  and  administrative  expenses  at  headquarters.  However,  no \nfinancial  audit  has  been  undertaken  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  RTSD\u2019s  use  of  the  funds. \nThe Azerbaijan Accounting Chamber, the Government audit office, scheduled an audit of RTSD \nin 2005. \n \n13. \nRTSD\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  is  limited  due  to  the  scarcity  of  experienced \nhuman  resources,  inadequate  staff  training,  and  lack  of  a  computer-based  management \ninformation  system.  In  recognition  of  this,  RTSD  proposes  a  reorganization  involving  the \nestablishment of four regional offices and bringing all local offices under the proposed regional \noffices. RTSD\u2019s proposed structural changes are waiting for Ministry of Transport approval. \n\n\f28 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nStrengthening  RTSD\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  has  been  one  of  the  major \n14. \ncomponents  of  external  assistance.  Under  its  technical  assistance,  the  World  Bank  proposed \nthat  RTSD  adopt  a  budgetary  system  based  on  six  activities:  (i)  road  management  and \nadministration  at  headquarters,  (ii)  planning  and  design,  (iii)  routine  maintenance,  (iv)  periodic \nmaintenance,  (v)  rehabilitation,  and  (vi)  road  network  development.  The  World  Bank  also \nassisted  RTSD  in  developing  a  computerized  accounting  system.  Although  equipment  was \npurchased and staff training provided, RTSD has not yet received the approval of the Ministry of \nTransport to implement the computerized accounting system. The World Bank also prepared a \nmanual on financial management for RTSD and proposed that RTSD implement an expenditure \nplan  to  rehabilitate  the  national  road  network  during  2005\u22122009;  this  envisages  a  doubling  of \nRTSD\u2019s expenditure on capital and recurrent works and external funding for road rehabilitation. \nHowever,  the  current  constraint  is  RTSD\u2019s  limited  capacity  to  implement  the  World  Bank \nrecommendations. Efforts are needed to improve RTSD\u2019s capacity for financial management. \n \nG. \n\nRoad Maintenance  \n\nAzerbaijan inherited a large stock of road infrastructure from the former Soviet Union and \n15. \nis  thus  facing  a  challenge  of  properly  maintaining  the  road  network  with  limited  resources. \nBased  on  the  assumption  that  the  entire  road  network  is  maintainable,  RTSD  estimates  that \nannual  road  maintenance  costs  for  2005  are  about  $260  million.  According  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff assessment, however, the total annual road maintenance costs \nare lower at $73.4 million due to lower unit rates (Table A2.4). ADB staff also estimates that only \n25%  of  the  road  network  is  currently  maintainable  and  the  total  maintenance  funding \nrequirements  for  2005  thus  amount  to  $37  million.  Although  the  Government  significantly \nincreased the budgetary allocation for road maintenance from AZM31.8 billion ($6.7 million) in \n2001  to  AZM153.0  billion  ($31.5  million)  in  2005  (Table  A2.5),  road  maintenance  funding \nremained  inadequate.  As  a  result,  road  maintenance  operations  are  limited  to  emergency \npavement repairs. \n \n\nTable A2.4: Cost Estimates for Road Maintenance, 2005  \n\n \n\nRoad \nCategory \n\nPavement  Length \n\nRTSD Assessment \n\n(km) \n\nUnit Rate \n\nTotal Cost \n\nADB Staff \nAssessment  \nTotal \nCost \n$ million \n\nUnit \nRate \n$ \u2018000 \n\n2.1\n\n6.2\n\n34.9\n\n8.6\n18.2\n3.4\n73.4\n\n7.3 \n\n6.3 \n\n2.7 \n2.5 \n2.1 \n \n\nAsphalt \n\n175 \n\nAZM \nmillion \n199.3\n\n$\u2018000 \n\n42.0\n\nAZM \nbillion \n34.9\n\n$ million \n\n7.3 \n\n12.0 \n\n851 \n\n121.3\n\n25.5\n\n103.2\n\n21.7 \n\nCategory I \n \nCategory II \n \n\nCategory IV \n \nCategory V \nTotal \n\nAsphalt \n \n\n \nSealed \nGravel \nGravel \n \n\nCategory III  Asphalt \n\n5,537 \n\n105.0\n\n22.1\n\n581.6\n\n122.4 \n\n3,244 \n7,179 \n1,608 \n18,594 \n\n44.4\n42.2\n35.4\n\n9.3\n8.9\n7.5\n\n144.1\n303.2\n56.9\n1,223.1\n\n30.3 \n63.8 \n12.0 \n257.7 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AZM = Azerbaijan manat, RTSD = Road Transport Service Department. \nSources: Road Transport Service Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nTable A2.5: Road Maintenance Funding, 2000\u22122005 \n\nYear \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n\nAZM million \n49,318 \n31,774 \n38,366 \n70,000 \n83,330 \n153,000 \n\n$ million  \n11.0 \n6.8 \n7.9 \n14.3 \n17.0 \n31.5 \n\nlabor \n\nrayon,  and  operates  using \n\nSource: Road Transport Service Department. \n \n16. \nRoad maintenance is undertaken by RTSD\u2019s 61 rayon-based road maintenance units on \na  force  account  basis.  Each  unit  is  responsible  for  the  main  and  secondary  roads  in  an \nindividual \nforce  and  construction  plants.  \nits  own \nThe  construction  plants  owned  by  the  road  maintenance  units  are  inherited  from  the  former \nSoviet Union and much of it is not serviceable. \n \n17. \nRoads  improved  under  the  Government\u2019s  transport  development  program  cannot  be \nsustained without adequate resources to properly maintain them. Effective measures need to be \ntaken to ensure that these roads will be able to provide the required level of service throughout \ntheir design life and will result in reduced transport cost to contribute to the national economy.  \nIn  recognition  of  this,  the  Government  plans  to  launch  a  road  maintenance  program  involving \nroutine and periodic maintenance for the roads that are in fair to good condition. The program \nwill  be  carried  out  in  parallel  with  the  road  improvement  and  development  during  2006\u20132015. \nThe  program  envisages  a  steady  increase  in  the  maintainable  network  as  road  improvement \ntakes place and a corresponding increase in maintenance funding to cover the entire network by \n2015. While RTSD requests funding for road maintenance to increase from $260 million in 2005 \nto  $424  million  in  2015  (adjusted  with  an  estimated  annual  inflation  rate  of  5%),  ADB  staff \nestimates  an  increase  in  the  minimum  maintenance  funding  from  $37  million  in  2005  to  $120 \nmillion in 2015. The maintenance funding requirements proposed by RTSD and ADB for 2005\u2013\n2015 are shown in Table A2.6.  \n \n\nTable A2.6: Annual Funding Requirements for Road Maintenance, 2005\u20132015 \n($ million)a \n\nRTSD\u2019s Request \n\nADB Staff Assessment \n\n \n\n \n\nYear \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n\nMaintainable \nNetwork \n25% \n30% \n40% \n50% \n60% \n70% \n80% \n85% \n90% \n95% \n100% \n\n260 \n273 \n287 \n301 \n316 \n332 \n348 \n366 \n384 \n403 \n424 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, RTSD = Road Transport Service Department. \na  Adjusted with an estimated annual inflation of 5%. \nSources: Road Transport Service Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n37 \n41 \n48 \n57 \n65 \n75 \n85 \n93 \n101 \n110 \n120 \n\n\f30 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nA  pavement  management  system  was  developed  with  World  Bank  assistance.  \n18. \nThe system provides the necessary steps of the planning cycle and relies on the HDM-4 model \nfor prioritizing the network for utilization of available resources. The World Bank trained RTSD \nstaff  on  the  use  of  the  system.  However,  RTSD  needs  support  to  implement  the  system  by \nconducting  annual  surveys  on  road  network  conditions  and  developing/implementing  annual \nmaintenance plans based on the outcome of the pavement management system.  \n \n19. \nThe  World  Bank  recommended  that  the  61  rayon-based  road  maintenance  units  be \nconsolidated  into  4\u20135  regional  road  maintenance  units  based  in  Ali-Bayramli,  Baku,  Ganja, \nNagorno Karabakh, and Nakhchivan. Except for Nakhchivan, which will be responsible only for \nroads  in  the  autonomous  region,  each  of  the  other  regional  road  maintenance  units  will  be \nresponsible  for  about  5,000  km  of  the  road  network.  While  periodic  maintenance  will  be \nundertaken through competitive bidding by private sector contractors, routine maintenance will \nbe initially undertaken by the regional road maintenance units using force account procedures, \nand will be gradually open to private sector contractors.  \n \nTo  implement  the  road  maintenance  program,  the  Government  will  implement  the  new \n20. \npavement  management  system  and  reorganize  the  regional  maintenance  units.  Given  that \nlimited institutional capacity constitutes a main constraint to implementing these initiatives, the \nADB-assisted  East\u2013West  Highway  Improvement  Project  will  strengthen  RTSD\u2019s  capacity  for \nroad  maintenance  by  helping  reorganize  regional  maintenance  units,  support  their  operations, \nimplement the pavement management system through training and provision of equipment, and \nidentify alternative sources of maintenance funding.  \n \nH. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n21. \nRoad accidents, fatalities, and injuries have increased since 2001. 2,388 road accidents \nin 2004 resulted in 811 fatalities and 2,766 injuries (Table A2.7). The fatality rate in 2004 was \nabout  17  per  10,000  vehicles,  much  higher  than  in  western  European  countries.  Annual \neconomic  loss  from  road  accidents was  more  than  $110  million,  accounting  for  1.7%  of  GDP. \nThe  major  causes  of  road  accidents  are  poor  road  conditions,  lack  of  safety  features  and \nfacilities,  weak  enforcement  of  road  safety  regulations,  intoxicated  driving,  and  inadequate \ndriver education. \n \n\nTable A2.7: Road Accidents in Azerbaijan \n\n \n\nYear \n1994 \n1995 \n1996 \n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n\nRoad Accidents \n2,908 \n2,556 \n2,200 \n2,001 \n1,998 \n1,996 \n1,987 \n1,985 \n2,196 \n2,311 \n2,388 \n\nNumber of Deaths \n1,130 \n1,001 \n767 \n606 \n595 \n554 \n596 \n559 \n642 \n724 \n811 \n\nNumber of Injuries \n3,301 \n2,823 \n2,441 \n2,292 \n2,309 \n2,316 \n2,199 \n2,228 \n2,486 \n2,691 \n2,766 \n\nSource: Ministry of Internal Affairs.  \n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\nFive  government  agencies2  are  responsible  for  road  safety;  each  operates  largely \n22. \nindependently. Although the National Road Safety Commission coordinates activities of various \ngovernment agencies, it does not have executive or operational powers. \n \nTo improve road safety, with World Bank assistance the Government prepared a 5-year \n23. \nroad safety program. The key recommendations include (i) replacing the National Road Safety \nCommission with a road safety board that has defined objectives, executive powers  for taking \nactions to reduce accidents, adequate funding, and a permanent secretariat; (ii) strengthening \nthe  road  network;  \nidentify  and  rectify  accident  black  spots \nRTSD\u2019s  capability \n(iii) establishing road accident monitoring, reporting, and information systems; (iv) reviewing and \nrevising,  if  necessary,  legislation  and  regulations  on  road  safety;  and  (v)  raising  public \nawareness  for  road  safety.  The  ADB-assisted  East\u2013West  Highway  Improvement  Project  will \nhelp  the  Government  implement  the  road  safety  program;  develop  road  accident  monitoring, \nreporting,  and  information  systems;  enhance  RTSD\u2019s  capacity  to  identify  accident  black  spots \non the road network; and provide staff training. \n \nI. \n\nVehicle Axle-Load Control \n\nto \n\nin \n\n24. \nAlthough  Azerbaijan  has  developed  regulations  to  limit  vehicle  axle  load  to  13  tons, \nenforcement  is  weak  due  to  limited  institutional  capacity  and  lack  of  weigh  facilities.  Vehicle \nweigh stations have not been established along the main roads, and government officials do not \nhave  appropriate  training  and  equipment  for  monitoring  and  enforcement  of  axle-load \nregulations. As a result, vehicle axle overloading is prevalent. Surveys conducted in 1999 on the \neast\u2013west highway showed that 20% of 4-axle trucks, 16% of 5-axle trucks, and 13% of buses \nexceeded  the  axle-load  limit.  Heavy  vehicle  weights  are  one  of  the  primary  causes  of  rapid \npavements  deterioration  and  damage  to  bridges.  The  recently  reconstructed  Alyat\u2013Haciqabul \nsection  of  the  east\u2013west  highway  shows  serious  pavement  damage  in  a  number  of  spots.  \nThe  enforcement  of  vehicle  axle-load  control  is  urgently  needed  to  prevent  premature \ndeterioration of the road network. \n \n25. \nIn  response,  the  Government  recently  decided  to  enforce  axle-load  regulations  by  \n(i) establishing 12 vehicle weigh stations along main roads, where overloaded vehicles will be \nrequired  to  redistribute  or  unload  exceeded  freight;  and  (ii)  collecting  reliable  data  on  vehicle \naxle  loads  by  installing  permanent  \u201cweigh-in-motion\u201d  devices  at  key  points  along  the  road \nnetwork. This will help quantify the overloading problem and assess the effectiveness of weight \nbridges.  The  ADB-assisted  East\u2013West  Highway  Improvement  Project  will  assist  RTSD  in \nestablishing  and  operating  vehicle  weigh  stations,  assess  the  axle  overloading  problem,  and \nimprove monitoring of axle overloading. \n \nJ. \n\nRoad Transport Services \n\nThe  environment  for  road  transport  services  is  competitive  in  Azerbaijan.  The  private \n26. \nsector plays a key role in provision of road transport services, accounting for more than 95% of \nfreight and passenger transport in 2003. The state-owned road transport operators were largely \nprivatized  and  foreign  road  transport  operators  are  allowed  to  set  up  their  businesses.  \nFreight  charges  and  bus  fares  for  domestic  road  transport  are  determined  based  on  market \nconditions,  though  the  Government  sets  tariffs  for  cross-border  and  international  transit \nvehicles.  No  vehicle  licensing  has  been  required  since  September  2003,  but  the  Government \nplans to introduce it within 2005 to enhance axle-load control and improve road safety. \n\n                                                 \n2  The  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  (Road  Traffic  Police  Department),  Ministry  of  Transport  (Road  Transport  Service \nDepartment),  Ministry  of  Education  (school  training  program),  Ministry  of  Health  (emergency  services),  and \nPresident\u2019s Office. \n\n\f \n32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \nSource \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR IN AZERBAIJAN \n\nProject Title \n\nLength \n(km) \n\nAmount \n(million) \n\nDate of \nApproval \n\nA.

These  traffic  forecasts  are  reasonable  compared  with  actual  annual  growth  of \ncombined  freight  and  passenger  traffic  during  1999\u20132005,  which  was  9.9%  on  the  Yevlax\u2013\nGanja section and 9.5% on the Qazakh\u2013Georgian border section. \n \n\nTable A9.1: Assumptions and Projected Traffic Growth for the Project Road \n\n \n\nItem \nPassenger Transport \n\nAnnual Growth of Per Capita Gross Domestic Product (%) \nAnnual Growth of Population in Azerbaijan (%) \nAnnual Growth of Population in the Project Area (%) \nAnnual Growth of Population\u2013Weighted Average \n(50% national and 50% project area) (%) \nIncome Elasticity of Passenger Transport Demand \n\nAnnual Growth of Passenger Transport (%) \n \nFreight Transport \n\nAnnual Growth of Gross Domestic Product (%) \nIncome Elasticity of Freight Transport Demand \n\nAnnual Growth of Freight Transport (%) \n\n2005\u22122009 \n \n7.1 \n0.7 \n1.4 \n1.1 \n\n1.2 \n7.8 \n \n \n7.5 \n1.0 \n7.5 \n\n2010\u22122028 \n\n \n5.0 \n0.5 \n1.1 \n0.8 \n\n1.2 \n6.8 \n \n \n6.0 \n1.0 \n6.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance. \n \n2. \nThe  projected  traffic  was  disaggregated  into  annual  average  daily  traffic  for  the  three \nsections  of  the  project  road:  (i)  Yevlakh\u2013the  beginning  of  Ganja  bypass  section;  (ii)  Ganja \nbypass section; and (iii) the Qazakh\u2013Georgian border section (Table A9.2). The annual average \ndaily traffic for 2005\u20132028 is projected to grow from 4,393 to 20,263 vehicles for the Yevlakh\u2013\nbeginning of Ganja bypass section, from 1,311 to 5,942 vehicles for the Ganja bypass section, \nand  from  2,538  to  11,710  vehicles  for  the  Qazakh\u2013Georgian  border  section.  While  domestic \ntraffic  is  expected  to  still  constitute  the  majority  of  the  total  traffic  during  the  projection  period, \nthe share of regional and international transit traffic is projected to grow from 5% of total traffic in \n2005 to 25% in 2028.  \n \n3. \nImprovement  of  the  project  road  is  not  expected  to  attract  diverted  traffic  significantly \ndue to two factors. First, there are no competing alternatives for road transport on the Yevlakh\u2013\nGanja bypass and Qazakh\u2013Georgian border sections. Although the Ganja bypass route is about \n8  km  longer  than  the  route  through  Ganja  city,1  the  travel  time  via  the  former  is  short.2 \nMoreover,  the  Ganja  bypass  route  is  generally  used  by  large  trucks  for  long  distance  travel, \nwhich are not permitted to travel through Ganja city. Second, there is little competition for traffic \n\n                                                 \n1 The Ganja bypass section is 36 km, while the route via Ganja city is 28 km. \n2 Travel time via the Ganja bypass section is estimated at 24 minutes, while travel time on the route via Ganja city is \n\nestimated at 32 minutes. \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n41\n\nbetween  the  project  road  and  the  parallel  railway  line.  The  majority  of  freight  carried  on  the \nrailway is crude oil and refined petroleum products from Baku. While this is expected to continue \nin  the  foreseeable  future,  crude  oil  will  be  partially  transported  through  the  recently  opened \nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan  oil  pipeline.  The  existing  passenger  services  on  the  project  road  are  also \nconsidered to be faster and more convenient than that of railways. \n \n\nTable A9.2: Annual Average Daily Traffic Projections for the Project Road \n \n\nYear \n\nYevlakh\u2013Beginning of \nGanja Bypass Section \n\nGanja Bypass Section  Qazakh\u2013Georgian Border \n\nSection \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n\n4,393 \n4,731 \n5,096 \n5,488 \n5,910 \n6,306 \n6,729 \n7,179 \n7,660 \n8,174 \n8,722 \n9,306 \n9,930 \n10,594 \n11,305 \n12,062 \n12,870 \n13,732 \n14,652 \n15,633 \n15,681 \n17,799 \n18,991 \n20,263 \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance. \n \nB. \n\n1,311 \n1,412 \n1,521 \n1,638 \n1,764 \n1,880 \n2,005 \n2,137 \n2,278 \n2,428 \n2,589 \n2,760 \n2,942 \n3,136 \n3,343 \n3,563 \n3,799 \n4,049 \n4,317 \n4,601 \n4,905 \n5,229 \n5,574 \n5,942 \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n2,538 \n2,733 \n2,944 \n3,171 \n3,415 \n3,644 \n3,888 \n4,149 \n4,427 \n4,723 \n5,040 \n5,377 \n5,738 \n6,122 \n6,532 \n6,970 \n7,437 \n7,935 \n8,467 \n9,034 \n9,640 \n10,285 \n10,974 \n11,710 \n\n4. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  covers  2005\u22122028,  comprising  4  years  of  road \nimprovement  and  20  years  of  operation.  It  was  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-\nproject  cases  and  the  weight  of  project  benefits  against  project  costs.  It  uses  2005  economic \nprices and the border price numeraire. \n \nThe  project  costs  comprise  capital  investment  and  road  maintenance  costs,  excluding \n5. \ntaxes.  Capital  investment  costs  are  based  on  the  actual  prices  in  the  recently  awarded  civil \nworks  contracts  for  improving  other  sections  with  similar  conditions  of  the  east\u2013west  highway. \nThe  project  costs  were  divided  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment,  nontradable  materials, \nand labor. They were converted into economic values based on the estimated taxes under the \nrecently  awarded  similar  civil  works  contracts  and  using  a  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.983 \nfor  nontradable  inputs.  The  economic  costs  for  road  improvement  average  $487,000  per  km, \nwhile road maintenance costs per km after project completion are estimated at $900 for annual \n\n                                                 \n3  The  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.98  is  calculated  using  the  approach  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Economic \n\nAnalysis of Projects and the 2004 data in Azerbaijan. \n\n\f \n42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nroutine maintenance and $27,000 for periodic maintenance. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 \nwas used to estimate the economic price of unskilled labor. Skilled labor is not shadow priced \nsince the country has no surplus of skilled labor. \n \nThe  major  project  benefits  include  savings  on  vehicle  operating  cost,  travel  time,  and \n6. \nmaintenance  costs,  which  were  calculated  using  the  HDM-IV  model.  Savings  on  vehicle \noperating cost and travel time are attributed to the improved smoothness of the road surfaces \nafter project completion. Vehicle operating cost excludes taxes and duties. Savings on vehicle \noperating cost and travel time by type of vehicles are showed in Table A9.3. Savings on vehicle \noperating cost are estimated at $45.1 million (81.1% of the total project benefits) and time travel \nsavings at $10.5 million (18.9% of the total project benefits). The benefits from vehicle operating \ncost  savings,  which  initially  accrue  to  vehicle  owners  and  operators,  will  be  shared  gradually \nwith  passengers  and  freight  customers  through  reduced  bus  fares  and  freight  charges.  \nThe Project will contribute to reducing road accidents because of improved road conditions and \ninstallation  of  traffic  safety  features,  but  such  benefits  are  not  quantifiable  and  thus  are  not \nincluded  in  the  economic  analysis.  The  Project  is  not  designated  to  alleviate  traffic  since \ncongestion is generally not a concern, except for Baku during the rush hours on workdays.  \n \n\nTable A9.3: Project Benefits by Type of Vehicles \n(at a 12% discount rate, $ million) \n\n \n\nType of Benefit \n\nCars and Light \nVehicles \n\nBuses \n\nTrucks \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\nWithout Project \nWith Project \n\nVehicle Operating Cost \n55.6 \n \n45.0 \n \n10.6 \nVehicle Operating Cost Savings \n \n \n \nTravel Time \n23.4 \nWithout Project \n \n17.4 \n \nWith Project \n6.0 \nTravel Time Savings \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance. \n \n7. \nThe  results  of  the  economic  analysis  are  summarized  in  Table  A9.4  and  detailed  in \nTable A9.5.

The Project will also improve \n10 local roads with a total length of about 65 km and cross-border infrastructure/facilities at Red \nBridge. \n \n2. \nRoad  reconstruction  works  will  generally  occur  within  the  60  meter-wide  road  reserve. \nMinor road alignments may be necessary in a few areas. Improvement of local roads does not \ninvolve any land acquisition or resettlement. A site will be required for the cross-border facility at \nRed Bridge, but this will be state-owned land and will not adversely affected people. According \nto Asian Development Bank (ADB) requirements, a resettlement plan was prepared to address \nanticipated and possible impacts. The plan covers procedures to be adopted for acquiring land \noutside the road reserve and land or property within the road reserve required for civil works. \n \n3. \nThe current domestic legislation related to the status and control of the road reserve has \nits  foundations  in  the  laws  of  the  Soviet  era.  Prohibition  of  activities  within  the  road  reserve  is \noutlined  in  the  1989  Road  Decree.  Since  independence,  the  Decree  on  the  Application  of  the \nRoad  Law  of  2000  and  Decree  No.  18  of  February  2004  on  additional  activities  aimed  at \nregulated usage of the road reserve have provided greater clarity on management of the road \nreserve.  The  Land  Code  was  revised  in  1999.  When  land  is  required  for  projects  of  national \ninterest,  compensation  is  initially  offered  on  the  basis  of  valuations  made  in  accordance  with \nStandard Code 158 (1998). If landowners are unhappy with this valuation, compensation has to \nbe  negotiated.  If  agreement  cannot  be  reached,  the  acquiring  authority  can  process  its \napplication for acquisition through the courts. \n \nResponsibility  for  implementing  most  duties  formally  allocated  to  the  Ministry  of \n4. \nTransport  is  delegated  to  the  Road  Transport  Service  Department  (RTSD).  Decree  No.  18 \n(2004)  required  RTSD  to  create  the  Road  Protection  Service  Unit,  which  is  responsible  for \ncontrol of the road reserve and vehicle overloading. The Road Protection Service Unit prepared \nan  inventory  of  200  commercial  and  residential  structures  within  the  road  reserve,  with \ncoordination  from  local  governments.  Local  governments  have  general  powers  for  approving \nnew building developments in respect of planning requirements, appearance, architectural style, \nand  construction  standards.  Local  officers  are  required  to  instruct  building  owners  to  stop \nconstruction  of  illegal  buildings  in  the  road  reserve  and  seek  permission  from  the  Ministry  of \nTransport  and  the  State  Committee  on  Mapping  and  Land  for  approval  of  any  such \ndevelopments.  Decree  No.  18  (2004)  requires  local  executive  powers  and  municipalities  to \nparticipate in the inventories of all structures in the road reserve that identify their legitimacy and \nvalue. \n \n5. \nFor agricultural land, values are established based on land attributes (productivity of soil \nand  regional  agricultural  characteristics),  input  costs,  and  typical  revenues  achieved  in  each \ndistrict.  These  cadastral-based  values  are  then  reviewed  in  each  district  by  a  valuation \ncommission  and  periodically  adjusted  upward  to  reflect  changes  in  crop  types,  production \nlevels,  and  local  market  prices.  The  land  compensation  price  must  be  based  on  the  market \nprice, provided that such price is not less than the cadastral or normative price for the subject \nland. Compensation payable for loss of annual crops is determined by the valuation commission \nfor  each  district,  which  uses  certified  data  on  the  productivity  of  crops  and  average  price  of \nproduce  as  issued  by  the  district  department  of  statistics.  Perennial  crops  such  as  fruit  trees, \n\n\f46 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\ngrape  vines,  and  currant  bushes  are  valued  on  a  per  tree  or  per  shrub  basis  by  applying  a \nstandard formula. \n \n6. \nCompensation  for  housing  and  other  assets  such  as  fences,  walls,  animal  enclosures, \nsmall irrigation channels, drains, wells, hand pumps, artesian bores, water pumps, hay sheds, \nand  animal  shelters  will  be  valued  and  compensated  on  the  basis  of  market  value  and  full \nreplacement  cost.  Compensation  for  temporary  access  roads  will  be  calculated  on  a  similar \nbasis  to  the  land  temporarily  occupied  for  the  highway  construction.  Compensation  will  cover \nthe  following  losses:  (i)  annual  crop  production,  (ii)  potential  crop  yield  reduction  for  3  years,  \n(iii)  trees  or  perennial  crops,  (iv)  use  of  grazing  land,  and  (v)  immovable  assets  and  land \nattachments.  Upon  project  completion,  the  land  used  for  temporary  access  roads  will  be \nreinstated to its pre-project condition and returned to the owners or users. \n \n7. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  will  be  upgraded  during  detailed  design. \nMeasures  will  be  taken  to  minimize  impacts  and  keep  construction  activities  within  the  road \nreserve. Up to 11 separate areas of land in locations outside the road reserve may need to be \nacquired to realign the road for safety reasons. The civil works contracts will require contractors \nto be responsible for the temporary acquisition and reinstatement of all land required outside the \nroad  reserve  for  construction  camps,  offices,  borrow  pits,  materials  storage  sites,  materials \nprocessing sites, and haul roads. When detailed design is completed in 2006, RTSD will update \nthe resettlement plan, disclose it to affected people, and submit it to ADB for approval prior to \ncommencement  of  civil  works.  The  Ecology  and  Safety  Section  of  RTSD  is  responsible  for \nsupervising resettlement plan implementation. \n \nIn  2004,  RTSD  inventoried  more  than  300  km  of  the  east\u2013west  highway  and  cleared \n8. \nillegal  structures  located  on  some  sections  of  the  corridor.  In  the  project  area,  the  inventory \nshowed that 200 structures were located within the road reserve, with a roughly estimated asset \nvalue  of  $1.6  million.  Along  the  Yevlakh\u2013Ganja  road  section,  61  businesses  were  removed, \nmostly  sales  enterprises  operating  from  small  iron  booths,  or  abandoned  businesses  such  as \ngarages  and  fuel  stations.  In  accordance  with  the  1989  Road  Decree,  these  structures  were \nillegal  and  owners  were  aware  that  they  would  need  to  remove  them  at  their  own  expenses \nwithout  compensation  in  accordance  with  domestic  laws.  However,  local  governments  and \nRTSD  assisted  in  removing  the  structures  and  acquiring  legal  land  plots  for  the  owners  to \nconstruct permanent shops. The procedures and the impacts were investigated as part of due \ndiligence;  the  result  shows  that  the  owners  were  able  to  invest  in  better  shops  and  were \nsatisfied with the support and outcome. The businesses that have built new shops are better off \nthan before. \n \n9. \nRTSD  has  adopted  a  policy  for  entitlements  that  accords  with  domestic  legislation and \nseeks  to  ensure  that  fair  and  proper  entitlements  are  provided  to  all  people  who  might  be \naffected  by  road  improvement  works  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement. \nThe resettlement plan is provided in supplementary appendix C. \n \n10. \nresponsible for carrying out the various actions are provided in Table A10 below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe procedures and steps involved in the resettlement process as well as the authorities \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47\n\nTable A10: Resettlement Procedures and Designated Responsibilities \n \n\nResettlement Procedures \n\nDesignated Responsibilities \n\nUpdate Requirements for Resettlement Within and Outside Road \nReserve Based on Detailed Design (2006) \n\u2022  Carry out detailed design to minimize requirements for land \n\nacquisition and resettlement. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIdentify affected structures and properties. \n\n\u2022  Consult with relevant authorities and structure owners. \n\n\u2022  Compute valuation of properties and reach agreement of authorities \nand structure owners according to domestic legislation, including \nconfirmation of status of property legitimacy. \n\n \n\u2022  Provide property owners with formal written notification of required \n\nclearance. \n\n\u2022  Collect baseline socioeconomic information for affected people. \n \n\nDetailed Resettlement Planning (2005 and 2006) \n\u2022  Consult with affected people and all agencies to identify good sites \n\nfor relocating businesses and houses. \n\n \n\u2022  Develop process for approval of structure design and land \n\ncertification assisted by local authorities. \n\n \n \n\u2022  Submit the updated resettlement plan to ADB for approval. \n \n\u2022  Distribute information/notification for affected people of agreed plans \n\nand issue notification to clear. \n\n \nClearance of Affected Properties (2005 and 2006) \n\u2022  Provide compensation and/or relocation assistance to affected \n\npeople in advance of clearance. \n\n \n\u2022  Give affected people adequate notice (minimum 3 months) to self-\n\ndemolish and salvage materials from their structures. \n\n \nMonitoring and Evaluation (2005\u20132007) \n\u2022  Conduct a baseline survey for affected businesses and households \n\nand submit the report to ADB. \n\n \n\u2022  Monitor progress of relocation and reestablishment of businesses, \n\nand obstacles encountered; and suggest actions to rectify if required \nand report to ADB. \n\n \n\u2022  Undertake independent monitoring and evaluation of business activity \nand changes in socioeconomic situations and prepare reports for \nRTSD and ADB. \n\n \n\u2022  Prepare resettlement completion report and submit to ADB. \n\nRTSD = Road Transport Service Department. \nSource: Road Transport Service Department. \n \n\n \n \nDetailed design consultant \n \n \nDetailed design consultant \n \nRTSD, Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment, State Committee for \nArchitecture and Construction, local \nexecutive powers and other agencies \ndesignated under Decree No. 18 \n(2004). \n \nRTSD \n \nExternal monitor \n \n \n \nRTSD to liaise with local \nmunicipalities, sate committees for \nconstruction and architecture, \nagencies related to land transfer \napproval, and affected people to \nensure agreement of all parties. \n \nRTSD \n\n \nRTSD, local governments \n \n \nRTSD \n\n \nExternal monitor (in 2005) \n \n \nRTSD monitors during the 3 month \nnotice period, and at the time of \nclearance \n \nExternal monitor appointed by RTSD \nto monitor at 6 month intervals \n \n \nRTSD and external monitor \n\n\f48 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nRTSD will, through the design and supervision consultant, engage in a consultation and \n11. \nparticipation program that will relate to all local residents and people affected by any necessary \nresettlement.

The detailed design and supervision consultants will assist \nRTSD to implement this program. \n \n12. \nRTSD will establish monitoring, evaluation, and reporting to ensure that any resettlement \nis  carried  out  according  to  the  resettlement  plan.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  have  two \nobjectives: (i) monitoring people affected by resettlement to ensure that they are treated fairly, \nreceive full entitlement in a timely manner, and are not made worse-off; and (ii) monitoring the \neffectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  resettlement  process  to  identify  any  bottlenecks  in  the \nprocess  and  ensure  that  prompt  action  is  taken  to  resolve  problems.  Internal  monitoring, \nevaluation, and reporting will be carried out by the Ecology and Safety Section and reported to \nADB through the project implementation unit. External monitoring, evaluation, and reporting will \nbe conducted by a locally recruited independent monitor. \n \n13. \nThe  tentative  budget  for  all  project  related  resettlement  matters  is  about  $500,000.  \nThe budget will be revised based on detailed design and included in the updated resettlement \nplan. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement? \n\nNot applicable \n\n \n\n \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Azerbaijan: \nRoads are one of the major transport modes in Azerbaijan, carrying 78% of passengers in passenger-kilometers and 28% \nof freight in ton-kilometers in 2003. However, many roads are in poor conditions, inhibiting economic growth and regional \ntrade.  The  State  Program  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development  (2003\u20132005)  developed  with  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  and  the  State  Program  for  Socioeconomic  Development  of  the  Regions  (2004\u2013\n2008)  identify  improvement  of  major  road  infrastructure  as  preconditions  for  regional  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction.  The  East\u2013West  Highway  Improvement  Project  will  include  improving  two  sections  of  the  east\u2013west  highway, \nwhich will promote economic growth and poverty reduction in Azerbaijan, and facilitate cooperation between Azerbaijan \nand  other countries in the region. Improvement of this road corridor  will ultimately restore the \u201csilk road\u201d linking Asia to \nEurope.  The  Project\u2019s  major  poverty  reduction  impacts  include  (i)  reduced  prices  of  transport  services,  food,  and  other \ndaily  necessities  due  to  lower  transport  costs;  (ii)  increased  jobs  and  income  for  the  poor  in  road  reconstruction  and \nmaintenance, and roadside commercial activities; and (iii) improved access of the poor to markets and social services. \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe project area consists of six rayons (regions)\u2014Agstafa, Ganja, Goranboy, Khanlar, Qazakh, and Yevlakh\u2014with total \npopulation of about 702,400. Except Ganja (the second largest city in Azerbaijan) and Yevlakh, most of other rayons are \npredominantly rural. Urban residents account for about 61% of the total population in the project area and about 33% of \nthe total, if Ganja is excluded. However, consumption expenditure in the rural area is higher that in the urban area. Rural \nresidents  spend  about  35%  more  than  urban  residents,  especially  on  foods,  housing,  transport,  education,  and \nrecreation.  About  37.2%  of  the  total  population  in  the  project  area  was  living  in  poverty  in  2003,  with  a  larger  income \ndisparity  than  the  national  average.a  The  average  salary  in  the  project  area  for  2003  ranged  from  AZM128,636  to \nAZM206,689  ($28.1\u2212$45.2),  much  lower  than  the  national  average  of  AZM383,058  ($83.7).  As  the  project  area  is \nadjacent to the Armenian-occupied area of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 86,800 (12.4% of the population) in the project area \nare internally displaced people and refugees, most of whom are poor. \n \nThe main causes of poverty are unemployment (officially 3,177 were unemployed in 2003) and lack of energy and water \nresources. However, poor road conditions impose constraints on job opportunities and thus affect the poor. Most villages \nare located half a kilometer or more from the main road corridor. The majority of the rural population, particularly the poor, \nhas  to  walk  to  the  main  road  to  access  social  services  and  buy  necessities.  The  cost  of  reaching  markets  outside  the \nvillage is high, due to poor road conditions and expensive transport services. Improving infrastructure, including roads, is \none of the key strategic priorities in the State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development for 2003\u22122005. \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction in the project area by improving the east\u2013west highway and selected local \nroads, thereby increasing local communities\u2019 access to markets, job opportunities, and basic social services. The Project \nis expected to create 5,250 person-months of skilled jobs at about $400 per person per month and 3,000 person-months \nof unskilled jobs at about $200 per person per month. The Project will benefit about 261,000 poor. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nIntensive  consultations  were  held  during  project  preparation  with  various  stakeholders,  including  representatives  of  the \nGovernment,  civil  society,  local  communities,  the  private  sector,  and  external  aid  agencies.  The  consultations  covered \nmajor project issues such as project alternatives, selection of local roads, potential benefits, and social and environmental \nimpacts. Consultations reveal a high degree of public support for the Project. The design of the Project has incorporated \nthe views of stakeholders. Special attention was given to the needs and constraints faced by women, internally displaced \npeople, refugees, and other vulnerable groups. The consultations also helped identify the role of each stakeholder. For \nexample,  the  Government  will  take  measures  for  effective  project  implementation,  with  support  from  nongovernment \norganizations  and  external  aid  agencies.  The  business  communities  will  complement  the  Project  by  financing  social \nsector projects in the project area. Stakeholder participation and consultation will continue during project implementation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nAn outline of the target groups and objectives of participation will be developed for the detailed design, construction, and \noperation phases of the Project. This strategy will include the need for ensuring local awareness of project activities from \ndetailed  design  to  implementation,  using  multiple  methods  such  as  public  meetings,  newspaper  advertising,  and  local \npublic announcement. The strategy will include a consultative phase during detailed design, through which the consultant \n\n Yes \n\n Yes \n\n No \n\n No \n\n\f50 \n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nwill assist in the participatory process, together with local stakeholders, to develop appropriate locations and designs for \npedestrian  and  livestock  crossing  points,  lighting,  speed  control,  and  roadside  market  areas.  This  strategy  will  be \nreviewed with representatives of the target groups and modified, if needed, according to relevant inputs. \n\n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAlthough  the  Azerbaijan  Constitution  guarantees  equal  rights  for  men  and  women,  women\u2019s  socioeconomic  status  has \ndeclined  since  the  breakup  of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The  Project  is  expected  to  create  job \nopportunities  for  women  during  project  implementation  (e.g.,  construction,  catering,  cleaning,  food  services,  and  office \nwork) and in roadside  businesses (e.g., cafes and shops). Contracts for  civil  works and consulting services  will include \nprovisions to encourage employment of both skilled and unskilled women laborers. During detailed design, the consultant \nwill coordinate closely with representatives of vulnerable women\u2019s associations in the project area to identify practical and \neffective  modalities  to  ensure  their  involvement  in,  and  direct  benefit  from,  increased  commercial  activities  in  roadside \nmarkets. During project implementation, civil works contractors will be required to take measures to mitigate the potential \nrisks  of  HIV/AIDS  (human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome).  These  measures  will  include \nraising public awareness on the risk of sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS) through leaflet distribution to \nroad construction workers and local communities, and giving workers time to be tested or receive treatment.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

Ethnic Azeri \naccounts  for  98.6%  of  the  population  in  the  project  area;  few \nother  nationalities  include  Kurds,  Russian,  and  Turks.  The \nminorities are neither indigenous nor negatively affected by the \nProject.  \nThe  Project  will  include  measures  to  mitigate  the  risks  of \nsexually \ninfections  (including  HIV/AIDS)  and \ndrug/human  trafficking.  Civil  works  contracts  will  include \nprovisions  requiring  contractors  to  raise  public  awareness  of \nthe risks of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, \nand  give  road  construction  workers  time  to  be  tested  or \nreceive  treatment.  The  provision  of  inspection  equipment  and \ncapacity  building  for  officers  at  the  border  of  Red  Bridge  will \nhelp prevent drug/human trafficking. The roadside stations that \nwill be included in the detailed project design will offer a venue \nfor  awareness  campaigns  on  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman/drug trafficking in the future. \n\ntransmitted \n\na  The Gini coefficient for Azerbaijan was 0.21, whereas that for the project area was 0.23 in 2003. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n51\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nrequirements.  An \n\n1. \nThe East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project is classified as Category \u201cB\u201d according to \ninitial \n(ADB)  environmental  assessment \nAsian  Development  Bank \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  Project  was  undertaken.  Improvement  of  the  existing  \n2-lane east\u2013west highway does not fall under the type of projects that requires state ecological \nexpertise  or  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  based  on  the  government  regulation  on \nenvironmental impact of roads (according to Article 50 of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \non  Environment  Protection).  An  EIA  is  required  for  new  construction  of  roads  and  road \nupgrading to category I standard, as described in the same law under Article 54. However, the \nMinistry  of  Ecology  and  Natural  Resources  (MENR)  advised  ADB  that  an  EIA  of  the  Project \nwould  need  to  be  approved  by  the  Government  prior  to  commencing  civil  works.  The  Road \nTransport  Service  Department  (RTSD)  will  prepare  the  EIA  with  assistance  from  the  detailed \ndesign consultant. This IEE will serve as a baseline document for MENR approval. 2004 is used \nas  the  base  year  for  forecasting  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  in  2008,  2013,  and \n2018.  The  environmental  impact  was  considered  for  quarries,  borrow  sites,  material  stockpile \nsites, contractors\u2019 yard, asphalt plant (at least 500 meters away from settlements), damage to \nlocal access roads, and aquatic environment within the right-of-way. The study during operation \nhas been limited to the existing right-of-way with the exception of noise, which is considered up \nto 100 meters on both sides of the project road. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nThe  Project  will  involve  improvement  of  about  127  kilometers  (km)  of  the  east\u2013west \n2. \nhighway  (89  km  from  Yevlakh  to  Ganja  and  38  km  from  Qazakh  to  the  Georgian  border).  \nThe  Project  will  comprise  about  123  km  full  width  road  reconstruction  and  4  km  realignment \nwithin  the  existing  right-of-way.  The  Project  will  also  include  repair  or  replacement  of  \n16  structurally  deficient  bridges,  improvement  of  drainage  structures,  construction  of  new  off-\nroad service areas, remodeling of existing junctions and roundabouts, and installation of traffic \nsafety and control devices. To ensure that the completed works do not deteriorate prematurely, \nthe  Project  will  provide  vehicle  weigh  facilities  along  the  highway,  strengthen  RTSD\u2019s \ninstitutional  capacity  to  enforce  controls  over  damage  to  roads  by  overloaded  trucks,  monitor \nenvironmental  aspects,  and  increase  the  pavement  thickness  to  accommodate  heavier  axle \nloads.  The  Project  will  improve  traffic  safety  by  reducing  traffic  accidents,  incorporating  traffic \ncontrol  facilities  in  the  engineering  design,  and  including  traffic  safety  courses  in  the  drivers\u2019 \nlicensing  and  school  curriculum.  Improvement  of  10  local  roads  totaling  65  km  will  increase \naccess of local communities to the east\u2013west highway. These local roads were selected through \nconsultations  with  local  stakeholders  and  based  on  the  extremely  poor  road  conditions  and \nlower income levels in the connected villages. The Project is expected to be implemented over \nabout 4 years, with estimated completion by November 2009. \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nThe  53  km  section  of  the  project  road  linking  Yevlakh  to  east  Ganja  traverses  flat  and \n3. \npartly rolling terrain and is generally poor in structure. The 36 km section of the Ganja bypass \ncrosses  more  undulating  area  cut  by  the  Ganja  Tschai  River  valley.  The  38  km  section  from \nQazakh to the Georgian border is characterized by slowly increasing altitude of up to about 500 \nmeters.  The  whole  project  road  crosses  and  passes  a  number  of  rivers,  shallow  valleys, \nirrigation  channels,  and  water  ponds.  The  soil  along  the  corridor  is  mainly  of  silt  and  clay.  \nThe climate of the highway passing through the region is classified as dry with hot summers and \n\n\f \n52 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nmoderately  cold  winters.  Average  monthly  temperature  varies  from  23\u221224\u00b0C  in  summer  and \nfrom 4\u22126\u00b0C in winter. \n \n4. \nThe road passes over several rivers. The Kura river system on the right side of the road \ncorridor  is  organically  and  bacteriologically  polluted  by  the  discharge  of  poorly  treated  or \nuntreated  wastewater.  The  major  sources  of  pollution  are  mining,  metallurgical,  and  chemical \nindustries;  leather  industry;  and  fertilizer.  Ambient  air  quality  measured  in  the  monitoring \nstations in Mingechevir (about 15 km away from the project road) and Ganja (about 13 km away \nfrom the project road) show that the concentrations of nitrogen oxides, dust, and sulfur dioxide \nexceed  the  maximum  allowable  concentrations  due  to  presence  of  huge  industrial  sources  in \nboth  localities.  Existing  noise  levels  along  the  road  corridor  were  estimated  using  empirical \nrelationships  used  in  other  ADB  technical  assistance  projects.  The  results  indicate  that  noise \nlevels are in compliance with noise standards. \n \n5. \nGroups or rows of trees mainly close to villages border the project road. Within the valley \nof the Ganja river, Tschai vegetation is abundant and characterized by dense stands of poplar, \nwillow, oak, and acacia. Cultivated areas planted to wheat, potato, and other crops as well as \nstands of pine, elm, cypress, and mulberry are also along the alignment. In the close vicinity of \nall  quarries  and  borrow  pits,  vegetation  is  scarce  and  restricted  to  some  scattered  stands  of \ntamarind,  wormwood,  blackberry  bush,  mulberry,  willow,  and  poplar.  No  protected  or \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  such  as  designated  wetlands,  forests,  nature  conservation \nareas, and places of archaeological importance are within or near the project area. \n \nD. \n\nScreening of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nto  ensure  better  understanding  of \n\n6. \nThe  environmental  impacts  and  corresponding  mitigation  measures  during  pre-\nconstruction,  construction,  and  operation  phases  of  the  Project  are  summarized  in  Table  A12. \nThe cost for implementing environmental mitigation measures during construction and operation \nis  estimated  at  $362,850.  The  supervision  consultant  in  association  with  the  contractor\u2019s \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  manager  will  conduct  training  on  environmental  and  social \nmanagement \nissues, \nimplementation of mitigation measures, and monitoring and capacity building of the Ecology and \nSafety Unit and the rayon offices of RTSD in the project area. The primary focus of training is to \nenable  the  staff  to  carry  out  environmental  monitoring,  implement  environmental  management \nplans,  and  conduct  environmental  impact  assessment.  After  training,  the  participants  will  be \nable to make brief environmental assessments for their respective roads, conduct monitoring of \nenvironmental  plans,  and  incorporate  environmental  features  into  future  road  designs,  and \nbidding and contract documents. \n \n\nroad-related  environmental \n\nTable A12: Environmental Impacts and Mitigation \n\nMitigation Measures \n\n \n\nPotential Impact \n\nDesign/Pre-construction Phase \nFlooding due to \nclosing of channels \nand rivers; erosion. \nIncreased \naccidents due to \ntraffic volume and \nhigher speed \nDisturbance to \ncommercial \n\nconcrete. \n\n\u2022  Bridge design will include preventing flooding due to closing of channels and rivers. \n\u2022  Design will consider erosion control such as slope and pier protection with gabion and \n\n\u2022  Speed control signs, proper road markings, streetlights, pedestrian and livestock \ncrossing, and other visual means will be included in the engineering design at the \nentrance and through the settlements along the road. \n\n\u2022  The Road Transport Service Department (RTSD) has prepared a resettlement plan, \n\nidentifying those who are entitled to compensation, the compensation mechanisms, the \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n53\n\nPotential Impact \n\nactivities, and \ndamage to crops \nand local roads \n\nLoss of agricultural \nland and impaired \nview. \nConstruction Phase \nDust, odor, and \nexhaust emission \n\nNoise emission \n\nFlooding due to \nalteration of \ndrainage \nStagnant water as \ninsect-borne \ndisease vectors \n\nSiltation and soil \nerosion \n\nWater pollution and \ncontamination from \nharmful and toxic \nchemicals \n\nGeneration of \nwastes due to \nremoval of old \nasphalt pavement \n\nLoss of topsoil \n\nMitigation Measures \n\namount of compensation according to the type of damages and timeframe.

Agricultural land will not be \nused for disposal areas. \n\n\u2022  A dust control program will be formulated and water will be sprayed in all mixing areas \n\nwhere dry materials are extracted, handled, and/or crushed, as well as on road surfaces \nduring dry conditions. \n\n\u2022  Vehicles delivering materials to and from the construction sites should be covered to \n\nreduce spills. \n\n\u2022  All bitumen preparation and loading sites must be over 500 meters downwind from any \n\ncommunity development, and the contractor must have spill and fire protection \nequipment available to rapidly deal with any accidents. \n\n\u2022  Vehicles and machinery used for construction are to be regularly maintained so that air \n\nquality conforms to national standards. \n\n\u2022  Noise standards at aggregate crushing plants and bitumen preparation sites will be \nstrictly enforced to prevent exceeding of acceptable noise standards 55 dBA for \nresidential areas in the day time and 45 dBA at night and 75 dBA for commercial and 80 \ndBA for industrial areas. Maintenance of machinery and vehicles should be enhanced to \nminimize noise. \n\n\u2022  Proper scheduling of construction activities to avoid elevated noise levels at night, \n\n\u2022 \n\nparticularly in sensitive areas such as settlements and health centers. \nIn sections along water bodies, irrigation and drainage systems, earth and stones will be \nplaced away from the channels so that these will not block rivers and streams, resulting \nin adverse impact on water quality and flow regime. \n\n\u2022  The contractors will take measures to avoid accumulation of standing water by removing \n\nold materials such as used tires and storage drums. Owners of water ponds in the \nvicinity of the Project should be given information on the dangers of waterborne diseases \nin standing water and how to prevent them. \n\n\u2022  Construction materials containing fine particles (e.g., limestone) should be stored in an \nenclosure such that sediment-laden water does not drain into nearby watercourses, but \nrather percolates slowly into the soil. \n\n\u2022  On slopes and other potentially erodible places along the roadside, appropriate \n\nvegetation that retards erosion should be planted. \n\n\u2022  Bitumen will not be allowed to enter running or dry streambeds and nor can be disposed \nof in ditches or waste disposal sites prepared by the contractor. Bitumen storage and \nmixing areas must be protected against spills and all contaminated soil must be properly \nhandled according to the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) or other \nacceptable standards. As a minimum, these areas must be contained so that any spills \ncan be immediately contained and cleaned up. \n\n\u2022  Vehicle maintenance and refueling should be confined to areas in construction sites \ndesigned to contain spilled lubricants and fuels. Waste petroleum products must be \ncollected, stored and taken to approve disposal sites according to MENR requirements. \n\u2022  Dumping of wastes into water bodies will not be allowed. Toxic and harmful construction \n\nmaterials will be properly stored and protected from rain. \n\nsources or existing residences. \n\n\u2022  Drinking water will be monitored to ensure that it meets national potable water standards. \n\u2022  Solid waste and garbage will be collected in bins and disposed of daily, according to a \n\nwaste management plan prepared by the contractor and approved by the PIU. \n\n\u2022  Contractors will recycle reclaimed asphalt pavement cold mixes or aggregate in granular \nor stabilized surface material for subgrade and base layers and for village access road \nmaintenance. The material that cannot be reused will be taken to specific official waste \ndumping sites approved by MENR. \n\n\u2022  The topsoil (about 15 cm) should be kept and refilled after excavation is over to minimize \n\nSewage generation \n\n\u2022  All work sites will be equipped with latrines to be located at least 300 meters from water \n\n\fPotential Impact \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nCompaction of soil \n\n\u2022  Whenever possible, construction vehicles should operate within the corridor of impact, \n\nthe impact on productive lands and semi-deserts.

Landscaping/greening will be undertaken along the project road. Plantation is \nrecommended for 15\u221220 meters strip for a total of 25 km for road greening and \nlandscape development. Specific location and schedule will be formulated during the \ndetailed design. \n\n\u2022  Asphalt plants will be located away from densely vegetated areas. \n\u2022  Hunting and fishing by construction workers will be strictly prohibited. \n\u2022  Stream crossings that are dry during the work period should be kept unobstructed at all \n\ntimes and the channels should not be altered. \n\n\u2022  Bridge design will ensure unimpeded flows. \n\u2022  Bridge construction should be scheduled in dry season (late summer to mid winter) to \n\navoid adverse impact on fishery, birds, and river water quality. \n\n\u2022  Temporary bypasses should be constructed and maintained during the construction \n\nperiod, particularly at bridge crossings. \n\n\u2022  A grievance redress committee must be formed in association with affected population \n\nbefore commencement of civil works and advance notice must be given to the \ncommunity about the construction schedule. \n\n\u2022  Rehabilitation of damaged local roads to their original condition after project completion. \n\u2022  Livestock crossings will be considered in the design. \n\u2022  There will be close coordination among contractors, RTSD, and police to ensure smooth \n\n\u2022  Speed of construction vehicles will be controlled through road safety education and fines. \n\u2022  Adequate traffic flow will be allowed around construction areas. Proper signage, barriers \n\nand flag persons for traffic control will be provided. \n\n\u2022  Scope and schedule of construction, and certain construction activities causing \n\ndisruptions or access restrictions will be communicated to the public through community \nconsultation and newspaper announcements. \n\n\u2022  Contractors will orient workers on appropriate health and safety procedures including \n\nawareness on sexually transmitted infection such as HIV/AIDS. Group consultations will \nbe done to raise awareness among the community about these diseases. \n\n\u2022  Contactors will provide appropriate personnel safety gear and will install proper \n\nsanitation and waste disposal facilities at construction sites. Workers will also be \nprovided with adequate health care. Work camps will be located away from sensitive \nlocations such as residential areas. \n\n\u2022  Construction materials should be reused, recycled, or properly disposed of. All worn out \nparts, equipment and empty containers must be removed from the site to proper storage \nlocations designated by RTSD. \n\n \n\u2022  Based on modeling results, minor impacts are expected since air quality will be generally \n\nbelow ambient air quality standards. After road reconstruction, the amount of dust \ngenerated will be less than the current case because of improved road conditions. \nPlanting and maintenance of greenbelts along the project road will mitigate the impact. \n\nProject. Roadside planting along affected areas using densely leafed shrubs and trees \nshould provide some attenuation (up to 2\u22124dBA).

During  construction,  environmental  monitoring \nwill  ensure  the  protection  of  embankments  from  potential  soil  erosion,  borrow  pits  restoration, \nquarry  activities,  location  of  work  sites  and  material  storages,  location  of  asphalt  plants, \npreservation  of  religiously  sensitive  locations,  community  relations,  and  safety  provisions. \nDuring operation, air, noise, and surface water quality monitoring and greening and landscaping \nof project roads will be important parameters of the monitoring program. In cooperation with the \nproject implementation unit and the Ecology and Safety Unit, the supervision consultant during \nproject implementation will be required to (i) develop an environmental auditing protocol for the \nconstruction  period  and \nformulate  a  detailed  monitoring  and  management  plan;  and  \n(ii)  supervise  the  civil  works  for  road  improvement  and  submit  quarterly  reports  based  on  the \nmonitoring  data  and  laboratory  analysis  report.  The  cost  for  environmental  monitoring  during \nconstruction and operation is estimated at $636,000. \n \n8. \nThe  agencies  involved  in  executing  and  monitoring  the  environmental  aspects  of  the \nProject  include  the  Ecology  and  Safety  Unit  of  RTSD  responsible  for  managing  the \nenvironmental impacts, greening, and landscaping of national roads; RTSD\u2019s district offices; and \nMENR.  The  design  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  incorporating  the  environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  plan  into  engineering  design  and  the  supervision  consultant  will \nundertake  environmental  monitoring  during  construction.  The  supervision  consultant  will \nsupervise  monitoring  of  mitigation  measures  during  construction.  The  contractors  will  be \nresponsible  for  subcontracting  data  collection  of  environmental  monitoring  to  a  recognized \norganization. Each contractor will be required to nominate an environmental, health, and safety \nthe  contractors\u2019  environmental,  health,  and  social \nspecialist  responsible \nresponsibilities. \n \nF. \n\nStakeholder Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nfor  meeting \n\nThe  IEE  process  included  stakeholder  participation  and  consultation  to  help  RTSD \n9. \nachieve  public  acceptance  of  the  Project.  In  October  2004  and  February  2005,  stakeholder \nconsultations  were  conducted  in  Baku,  Borsunlu,  Delimemmedly,  Ganja,  Goranboy,  Qazakh, \nand  Yevlakh),  which  involved  a  wide  range  of  participants  (over  150  people)  representing  the \nGovernment;  nongovernment  organizations;  scientific,  education,  and  health  institutions;  civil \nsociety; businesses; and media. The consultation process was documented according to ADB\u2019s \nand  the  Government\u2019s  requirements  and  the  recommendations  were  incorporated  in  the \npreliminary  design  of  the  Project.  The  results  of  the  consultations  were  positive,  with  people \nconsidering  that  the  Project  will  bring  significant  economic  benefits  to  the  region  and  will \nincrease trade flows. Major concerns were related to damage of local roads during construction, \nenforcement  of  speed  limits,  intersection  improvement,  street  lighting,  proper  traffic  signs  and \npedestrian crossings, involvement of local people during construction, and quick implementation \nof the Project.  \n \n\n\f \n56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nG. \n\nConclusion \n\n10. \nThe IEE reveals that no major negative environmental impacts are likely to occur during \nproject implementation and operation after project completion. Recommendations are included \nin  an  environmental  monitoring  and  management  plan  to  mitigate  expected  negative  impacts \nidentified in the IEE and adequate funds will be provided for this purpose. \n \n11. \nThe  Project  will  have  overall  beneficial  impacts  through  better  accessibility  for  cross-\nborder  traffic  connecting  to  the  Georgian  border,  increased  trade  flows  in  the  region,  reduced \ntravel  time,  reduced  dust,  and  improved  road  safety.  Rehabilitation  of  local  roads  will  also \nenhance  access  of  poor  villages  to  markets,  schools,  health  care  facilities,  and  job \nopportunities. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 01 November 2005) \n", "Currency Unit\nAZM1.00\n$1.00\n", "Azerbaijan manat (AZM) \n$0.0002 \nAZM4,597 \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAIDS \nEBRD \nEIA \nEIRR \nGDP \nHIV \nIEE \nIsDB \nLIBOR \nMENR \nNGO \nOCR \nPIU \nPSC \nRTSD \nSCC \nSDR \nSFD \nSPPRED \nVOC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return  \ngross domestic product  \nhuman immunodeficiency virus \ninitial environmental examination \nIslamic Development Bank \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMinistry of Ecology and Natural Resources  \nnongovernment organization  \nordinary capital resources  \nproject implementation unit \nproject steering committee \nRoad Transport Service Department \nState Customs Committee \nspecial drawing rights \nSaudi Fund for Development \nState Programme on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development \nvehicle operating cost \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \nVice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n", "J.
