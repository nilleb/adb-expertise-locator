An initial environmental \nAssessment  examination was undertaken and the summary is in Appendix 12. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  improvement  of \n127 kilometers (km) of two-lane paved road on the sections of \nYevlakh\u2013Ganja  and  Qazakh\u2013Georgian  border  of  Azerbaijan\u2019s \nprimary east\u2013west highway, (ii) improvement of 10 local roads \ntotaling about 65 km in the project area, (iii) support for policy \nreform and improved governance in the road subsector through \ninstitutional strengthening, and (iv) facilitation of the movement \nacross Azerbaijan\u2019s border (at Red Bridge) with Georgia. \n   \nRationale  The  Project  is  a  priority  in  the  Government\u2019s  transport \ndevelopment  program  (2005\u22122014).  The  Project  will  facilitate \nsocioeconomic development by improving the east\u2013west highway \nand local roads linking the western part of Azerbaijan closely to \nBaku,  the  country\u2019s  capital;  and  increasing  local  communities\u2019 \naccess  to  markets,  job  opportunities,  and  social  services. \nThe Project will also strengthen Azerbaijan\u2019s transport links to \nGeorgia and thus promote regional cooperation. As part of the \nAsian highway network and one of Azerbaijan\u2019s main routes for \nexternal trade, the east\u2013west highway carries traffic between the \nCaspian  and  Black  seas  and  has  the  potential  to  become  an \nimportant route for transit transport between Asia and Europe. \nThe Project is included in ADB\u2019s assistance program for 2005 and \nis consistent with its assistance strategy for Azerbaijan. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  accelerated  socioeconomic \ndevelopment in the six rayons of west Azerbaijan and enhanced \nregional cooperation. The outcome will be increased traffic and \nimproved  quality  and  efficiency  of  transport  on  the  east\u2013west \nhighway and selected local roads. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, \ninterest, and other charges during construction, is estimated at \n$93.2 million equivalent. \n   ", "ii   \nFinancing Plan   \nSource  Total ($ million)  Percent \nAsian Development Bank     \n Ordinary capital resources  49.0  52.6 \n Special Funds resources  3.0  3.2 \nIslamic Development Bank  10.4  11.2 \nSaudi Fund for Development  11.0  11.8 \nGovernment  19.8  21.2 \nTotal  93.2  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nLoan Amount and Terms  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a blend of two \nloans: a loan of $49.0 million from its ordinary capital resources \n(OCR)  and  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special \nDrawing Rights (SDR) 2,075,000 ($3.0 million equivalent) from its \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the Project. The OCR \nloan  will  finance  the  road  improvement  and  cross-border \nfacilitation  components,  and  the  SDR  loan  will  finance  the \ninstitutional strengthening component. The OCR loan will have a \n24-year term including a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. The SDR loan will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 May 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 November 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  executing  agencies  are  (i)  the  Road  Transport  Service \nDepartment (RTSD) under the Ministry of Transport for the road \nimprovement  and  institutional  strengthening  components,  and \n(ii)  the  State  Customs  Committee  (SCC)  for  the  cross-border \nfacilitation component. \n   \n   \nImplementation  The project implementation unit (PIU) in RTSD will be reorganized \nArrangements  to manage implementation of all road projects supported by ADB, \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and World \nBank. The PIU will implement ADB-funded activities and prepare \nreports under the Project. The PIU will be headed by a project \ndirector, who will be assisted by a team of qualified technical, \nfinancial, and support staff. SCC will appoint a project coordinator \nto  manage  implementation  of  the  cross-border  facilitation \ncomponent. \n \nA  project  steering committee (PSC) will be  established to ensure\n ", "  iii\n  close  interagency  coordination  and  supervise  implementation. \nThe PSC will be chaired by the RTSD director and will comprise \nrepresentatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development, \nMinistry of Finance, and Ministry of Transport; as well as the PIU \nproject director and SCC project coordinator. Representatives of \nrelevant local communities will be invited to PSC meetings for \nlocal road improvement. The PSC will meet at least quarterly to \nreview  implementation  progress  and  provide  approvals  and \nguidance on project implementation as necessary. \n   \nProcurement  ADB-funded goods and services will be procured according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works will be divided into \n15 contracts; ADB will finance 14 of the contracts, and the Islamic \nDevelopment Bank (IsDB) and the Saudi Fund for Development \n(SFD) will jointly finance one. ADB-financed civil works contracts \nfor improving the Yevlakh\u2013Ganja and Qazakh\u2013Georgian border \nroad sections will be procured through international competitive \nbidding procedures. Civil works contracts for improving local roads \nand cross-border facilities at Red Bridge will be procured through \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nProcurement  of  equipment  for  border  inspection,  road \nmaintenance,  and  weighing  vehicles  will  follow  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  Anticorruption  provisions \nacceptable to ADB will be included in all bidding documents and \ncontacts. \n \nADB  approved  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  on \n10 May 2005. The Government was advised that ADB approval of \nadvance procurement action does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject  and  that  ADB  will  not  finance  expenses  paid  by  the \nGovernment prior to loan effectiveness. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 993 person-months of consulting services \n(104 international and 889 domestic) to support implementation. \nRTSD will engage (i) a consulting firm for 869 person-months \n(64  international  and  805  domestic)  for  detailed  design  and \nconstruction supervision for improving the east\u2013west highway and \nlocal  roads,  and  (ii)  a  consulting  firm  for  94  person-months \n(30 international and 64 domestic) for institutional strengthening. \nSCC  will  engage  individual  consultants  for  30  person-months \n(10  international  and  20  domestic)  for  cross-border  facilitation. \nADB will finance consulting services for detailed design for all the \nproject roads, construction supervision for ADB-financed sections, \ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  cross-border  facilitation.  ADB-\nfinanced consultants will be selected and engaged according to \nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development \nBank and its Borrowers and other arrangements acceptable to \nADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. IsDB will \nfinance consulting services for construction supervision for the \nroad section funded by IsDB and SFD loans. \n   \n ", "iv   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit people living along the project sections of \nBeneficiaries  the  east\u2013west  highway;  road  users;  construction  companies; \ntraders;  and  other  people  who  derive  income  from  expanded \ntraffic, trade, and investment in the project area. The major direct \nbenefits  will  include  (i)  lower  road  transport  and  maintenance \ncosts,  (ii)  faster  and  more  reliable  road  transport  services, \n(iii) improved access of local communities to markets and social \nservices, (iv) job and income opportunities created during project \nimplementation (i.e., use of local labor and construction materials) \nand  after  project  completion  (i.e.,  roadside  businesses), \n(v)  efficient  movement  of  freight  and  passengers  across \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  border  (at  Red  Bridge)  with  Georgia,  and \n(vi)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  in  the  road  subsector. \nThe economic internal rate of return for the Project is estimated at \n17.9%. The Project is expected to create 5,250 person-months of \nskilled  jobs  at  about  $400  per  person  per  month  and  3,000 \nperson-months of unskilled jobs at about $200 per person per \nmonth.  Indirect  benefits  will  be  increased  business  and  job \nopportunities  that  have  backward  or  forward  linkages  to  the \nProject, and expanded trade between Azerbaijan and Georgia as \nwell as other countries in the region. \n   \nAssumptions and Risks  The  Project  was  designed  based  on  the  following  key \nassumptions: (i) continued political stability and economic growth \nin  Azerbaijan  and  the  region,  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  continued \ncommitment to regional cooperation, (iii) effective implementation \nof  the  Government\u2019s  transport  development  program  (2005\u2013\n2014), (iv) timely provision of counterpart funding, and (v) timely \ncofinancing from IsDB and SFD. \n \nThe Project\u2019s major potential risk is that the project roads after \ncompletion  may  experience  a  higher  than  anticipated  rate  of \ndeterioration due to axle overloading and inadequate funding for \nmaintenance. Because the limited institutional capacity in the road \nsubsector  constitutes  a  major  constraint  to  addressing  these \nissues,  the  Project  will  mitigate  this  risk  through  institutional \nstrengthening assistance to the road subsector, accompanied by \nloan  conditionality.  The  Project  will  help  enforce  axle-load \nregulations by assisting RTSD to establish and operate vehicle \nweigh  stations  along  the  main  roads  and  improve  monitoring. \nDuring  project  preparation,  ADB  assisted  the  Government  in \ndeveloping  a  road  maintenance  program,  which  envisages  a \nsteady increase in maintenance funding to cover the entire road \nnetwork by 2015. The Government is committed to implement the \nroad  maintenance  program.  The  Project  will  support \nimplementation of the program by assisting RTSD in reorganizing \nregional  maintenance  units,  prioritizing  roads  for  maintenance, \nutilizing the newly developed pavement management system, and \nidentifying alternative sources for maintenance funding. Given the \ncomplexity of these issues, the Project is ADB\u2019s first support for \nbuilding effective institutions in Azerbaijan for sustainable road \nmanagement  according  to  commercial  principals.  ADB  will \ncontinue assistance in this direction under future road projects. \n ", "(cid:111) (cid:111)\n(cid:52)(cid:54)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:8217)(cid:69)

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Azerbaijan for the East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework of the Project is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Azerbaijan, with an area of about 86,600 square kilometer (km2) and population of  \n8.3  million,  stands  at  the  crossroads  between  east  and  west  in  the  southern  Caucasus.  \nThe transport sector plays an important role in the national economy, accounting for 10.2% of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2003.  Roads  are  among  the  major  modes  of  transport. \nHowever,  road  transport  faces  challenges  due  to  the  country\u2019s  transition  from  a  centrally \nplanned to a market-oriented system. A detailed road subsector analysis is in Appendix 2.  \nThe significant features are summarized below. \n \n(i)  Azerbaijan  (excluding  Nakhchivan)2  has  a  road  network  of  about  18,800 \nkilometers (km), comprising 4,577 km of national roads and 14,222 km of local \nroads. Road density is 0.2 km per km2. Approximately 52% of roads are paved, \n47% gravel, and the remaining earth tracks. About 75% of the network is in poor \ncondition and needs rehabilitation. \n(ii)  In 2003 roads carried 78% of passengers in passenger-kilometers, 28% of freight \nin ton-kilometers, 29.8% of imports, and 6.9% of exports. \n(iii)  The use of motor vehicles is low by international standards. The vehicle fleet \nnumbered  486,800  in  2003,  equivalent  to  58  vehicles  per  1,000  people.  \nAbout 60% of vehicles are outdated and need to be replaced. \n(iv)  The  environment  for  road  transport  is  competitive,  with  the  private  sector \naccounting for more than 95% of freight and passenger transport in 2003. Almost \nall state-owned road transport operators have been privatized and foreign road \ntransport operators are allowed to set up businesses. Freight charges and bus \nfares  for  domestic  transport  are  based  on  market  conditions,  while  the \nGovernment sets tariffs for cross-border and international transit vehicles. \n(v)  Roads are the responsibility of the Road Transport Service Department (RTSD) \nand the Auto Transport Service Department under the Ministry of Transport that \nwas established in 2003. RTSD is responsible for road infrastructure networks, \nwhile the Auto Transport Service Department is responsible for road transport \nservices. Institutional capacity in the subsector is limited. \n(vi)  With the abolishment of the Road Fund in 2001, roads are financed primarily \nfrom the Government\u2019s budget. Although funding for road maintenance increased \nfrom AZM31.8 billion ($6.7 million) in 2001 to AZM153 million ($31.5 million) in \n2005, it accounted only for 0.2% of GDP and remained inadequate. \n \n                                                 \n1  A small-scale project preparatory technical assistance was provided to update the feasibility studies of this Project, \nfunded by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 2000 and the European Union in 2002. \n2  Nakhchivan, as an autonomous region, is separated from central Azerbaijan by Armenia. Central Azerbaijan and \nNakhchivan are connected by air transport or road transport via Iran. ", "2   \n(vii)  Road accidents have increased since 2001. The 2,388 road accidents in 2004 \nresulted in 811 fatalities and 2,766 injuries. The fatality rate in 2004 was about  \n17 per 10,000 vehicles, much higher than in western European countries. Annual \neconomic loss from road accidents was more than $110 million, accounting for \n1.7% of GDP. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n3.  Road Network. Azerbaijan\u2019s road network includes two major highways: the east\u2013west \nhighway linking Baku, the country\u2019s capital, to the Georgian border and the north\u2013south highway \nrunning from the Russian border to the Iranian border via Baku, as well as a number of \nsecondary  and  local  roads.  The  east\u2013west  highway,  which  is  about  500  km,  is  one  of \nAzerbaijan\u2019s main routes for transport links to the western region and external trade. However, \nthe network was developed primarily under the former Soviet Union when traffic volume was \nmuch higher. Due to lack of resources for maintenance and vehicle axle overloading, about 75% \nof the network is in poor condition. Based on the road condition data available, 61% of the east\u2013\nwest and north\u2013south highways, 76% of other national roads, 66% of secondary roads, and \n76% of rural roads require rehabilitation. This constitutes a major impediment to economic \ngrowth and private sector development due to high transport costs and accidents. In recognition \nof this, the Government has set improvement of road infrastructure as one of the priority actions \nin the State Programme on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED) for \n2003\u221220053 and embarked on a transport development program (2005\u20132014), which starts with \nimprovement of the east\u2013west and north\u2013south highways. The Government is also finalizing a \nprogram for improving secondary roads. The majority of the east\u2013west highway has been or is \nbeing  improved  with  external  assistance  (Table  1).  The  World  Bank-assisted  project  for \nimproving the Ganja\u2013Qazakh section is expected to be completed in 2006, while the European \nBank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is expected to complete improvement of the \nHajigabul\u2013Kyurdamir section in 2008. The proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) Project \nwill  improve  the  last  two  sections  of  the  east\u2013west  highway  and  address  issues  on  road \nmaintenance and vehicle axle overloading. This will help maximize the benefits from other \nimproved sections of the highway so as to foster private sector-led economic growth. \n \nTable 1: Improvement of the East-West Highway in Azerbaijan \nSection  Length  Source of Funding  Status of Improvement \n(km) \nBaku\u2212Alyat  55  Government  Ongoing \nAlyat\u2212Hajigabul  45  IsDB and Kuwait Fund  Completed \nHajigabul\u2212Kyurdamir  81  EBRD  Ongoing \nKyurdamir\u2212Ujar  46  Kuwait Fund  Ongoing \nUjar\u2212Yevlakh  53  IsDB   Ongoing \nYevlakh\u2212Ganja (via Ganja Bypass)  89  ADB, IsDB, and SFD  To start in 2006 \nGanja\u2212Qazakh  94  World Bank  Ongoing \nQazakh\u2212Georgian border  38  ADB  To start in 2006 \nTotal  501     \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IsDB = Islamic \nDevelopment Bank, SFD = Saudi Fund for Development. \nSource: Road Transport Service Department. \n \n                                                 \n3  Republic of Azerbaijan. 2003. State Programme on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development, 2003\u20132005. \nBaku. \n \n ", "    3 \n4.  Road Maintenance. Azerbaijan inherited a large stock of road infrastructure from the \nformer Soviet Union and is facing the challenge of properly maintaining the road network with \nlimited resources. Based on the assumption that the entire road network is maintainable, RTSD \nestimates that total maintenance costs for 2005 are about $260 million. However, according to \nADB staff assessment, road maintenance costs for 2005 amount to $37 million, partly because \nthe unit rates are lower and partly because 25% of the network is estimated to be currently \nmaintainable (Appendix 2). Funding for road maintenance increased from AZM31.8 billion ($6.7 \nmillion) in 2001 to AZM153.0 billion ($31.5 million) in 2005, but remained inadequate. As a \nresult, road maintenance operations are limited to emergency pavement repairs. Moreover, \nRTSD\u2019s 61 rayon-based maintenance units, which currently undertake road maintenance works, \nare  inefficient  due  to  lack  of  economic  scale  and  weak  management.  In  recognition  that \nimproved  roads  cannot  be  sustained  without  adequate  resources  to  maintain  them,  the \nGovernment plans to launch a road maintenance program in parallel with road improvement. \nThe program envisages a steady increase in the maintainable network as road improvement \ntakes place and a corresponding increase in maintenance funding to cover the entire network by \n2015. To implement the road maintenance program, the Government plans to reorganize the \nregional maintenance units and implement a newly developed pavement management system. \nGiven that the limited institutional capacity in the road subsector constitutes a main constraint to \nimplementing the road maintenance program, the Project will strengthen RTSD\u2019s capacity for \nroad  maintenance  by  helping  reorganize  regional  maintenance  units,  prioritize  roads  for \nmaintenance, implement the pavement management system, and identify alternative sources of \nmaintenance funding. \n \n5.  Axle-Load Control. Azerbaijan has developed regulations to limit vehicle axle load to  \n13 tons, but enforcement is weak primarily due to limited institutional capacity and lack of \nvehicle weigh facilities. As a result, vehicle axle overloading is prevalent.4 Surveys conducted in \n1999 on the east\u2013west highway showed that 20% of 4-axle trucks, 16% of 5-axle trucks, and \n13% of buses exceeded the axle-load limit. Heavy vehicle weights are one of the primary \ncauses of rapid pavement deterioration and damage to bridges. In response, the Government \nrecently decided to enforce axle-load regulations by establishing 12 vehicle weigh stations along \nmain roads.5 The Project will assist RTSD in establishing and operating vehicle weigh stations, \nassessing the axle overloading problem, and improving monitoring of axle overloading. \n \n6.  Road Safety. Road accidents are increasing in Azerbaijan. The major causes include \npoor road conditions, lack of safety features and facilities, weak enforcement of road safety \nregulations,  intoxicated  driving,  and  inadequate  driver  education.  Although  the  State  Road \nSafety Commission is coordinating activities of concerned government agencies, it does not \nhave executive powers. To improve road safety, the Government developed a road safety \nprogram that requires establishing road accident monitoring, reporting, and information systems. \nThe Project will improve road safety by helping implement the road safety program; improve the \nlegislation and regulations on road safety; develop road accident monitoring, reporting, and \ninformation systems; enhance RTSD\u2019s capacity to identify accident black spots on the road \nnetwork; and provide staff training. \n \n7.  Roads  and  Poverty  Reduction.  Despite  recent  economic  growth,  40.2%  of  the \npopulation in Azerbaijan was living in poverty in 2004. In the 6 rayons (regions)\u2014Agstafa, \n                                                 \n4  Dressed stone blocks are a common building material in Azerbaijan; these mostly originate from quarries in the \narea of Qaradag near Baku. These stone blocks are usually transported in 3-axle Kamaz trucks that can be \ncommonly overloaded by at least 7 tons. \n5  Two vehicle weigh stations will be located along the Yevlakh\u2013Ganja section and Qazakh\u2013Georgian border section \nof the east\u2013west highway, respectively. \n ", "4   \nGanja, Goranboy, Khanlar, Qazakh, and Yevlakh\u2014that the project road transverses, about \n261,000 people (37.2% of the total population) lived in poverty in 2003. As the project area is \nadjacent to the Armenian-occupied Nagorno-Karabakh area, about 86,800 in the project area \nare internally displaced people and refugees, who are much poorer and highly dependent on \nroad transport for access to basic services and assistance from the Government and relief \norganizations.  While  the  poverty  analysis  shows  that  the  main  causes  of  poverty  are \nunemployment  and  lack  of  energy  and  water  resources,  poor  road  conditions  impose \nconstraints on job opportunities. Improvement of road infrastructure is one of the priorities in the \nSPPRED for 2003\u22122005. The Project will help reduce poverty by improving the east\u2013west \nhighway and local roads, which will reduce transport costs for the poor in the project area and \nimprove their access to jobs, markets, and basic social services. \n \n8.  Cross-Border and Transit Facilitation. The road system contributes significantly to \ncross-border and international transit traffic. The north\u2013south highway connects the Russian \nFederation  and  Iran,  while  the  east\u2013west  highway  is  Azerbaijan\u2019s  segment  of  the  trans-\nCaucasian corridor running between the Caspian and Black seas. The east\u2013west highway also \nforms part of the Asian highway network6 and the \u201csilk route\u201d linking Asia to Europe. Although \ninternational traffic on the east\u2013west highway is currently small (about 5% of the total traffic), the \ncorridor has the potential to become an important transit route. Azerbaijan has signed a number \nof international transit and transport agreements and conventions. The country\u2019s trade policy is \ngenerally liberal, with limited application of export tariffs for metals and articles, low import tariffs \n(a weighted average of 5.7% in 2004), and few quantitative restrictions.7 However, poor road \nconditions, inadequate border facilities, and limited capacity at Azerbaijan\u2019s border with Georgia \n(at Read Bridge) are impeding cross-border traffic and trade. A World Bank survey shows that \n80% of firms experienced delays of 1\u22123 days in crossing the borders of Azerbaijan.8 Transport \nsecurity has also become an emerging issue. The Project will facilitate the movement of freight \nand  passengers  across  the  border  of  Red  Bridge  by  improving  the  existing  cross-border \nagreement between Azerbaijan and Georgia, improving border facilities, providing equipment, \nand enhancing the capacity of officers serving at the border. \n \n9.  Institutional Capacity. Despite some improvement, institutional capacity in the road \nsubsector remains inadequate. Officials have limited knowledge of sound sector policies and \nregulations needed for a market economy, management of commercially based road transport \nservices,  new  technology  in  construction  and  maintenance  of  road  infrastructure,  and \nappropriate methodology for monitoring and evaluating road projects. During 2003\u2013April 2005, \nthe  World  Bank  extended  technical  assistance  for  institutional  strengthening  of  the  road \nsubsector, which included (i) developing a corporate plan for RTSD, (ii) conducting a road \ninventory  and  functional  classification  of  the  network,  (iii)  reviewing  road  user  charges,  \n(iv)  developing  a  pavement  management  system,  (v)  reviewing  technical  standards  and \nspecifications,  (vi)  establishing  a  financial  management  system,  (vii)  developing  a  quality \nassurance  system,  (viii)  developing  a  multiyear  rolling  road  management  program,  \n(ix) addressing traffic safety, and (x) assessing performance. The World Bank assistance is a \nfirst  step  toward  sustainable  road  development.  However,  the  subsector  needs  continued \nassistance, particularly with regard to the Government\u2019s acceptance and implementation of \nWorld Bank recommendations. Based on the results of World Bank assistance, the Project will \n                                                 \n6  The concept of the Asian highway network was developed with assistance from the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and Pacific. Twenty-seven Asian countries including Azerbaijan have signed the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on the Asian Highway Network. \n7  ADB. 2005.

This  will  complement  EBRD\u2019s  planned  assistance  to  implement  the  newly \ndeveloped corporate plan and financial management system.9 \n \n10.  Governance and Corruption. Weak governance is a daunting challenge in Azerbaijan. \nThe general perception in the private sector is that corruption exists and adversely affects \nsustainable development in the country. The Government has taken action to tackle corruption. \nThe  new  Anticorruption  Law  became  effective  in  January  2005.  The  new  Anticorruption \nCommission  is  chaired  by  the  head  of  the  Presidential  Administration  and  comprises  \n12 members from the Presidential Administration, Parliament, and constitutional courts. A new \nProcurement Law was adopted, which the World Bank considers as one of the better such laws \nin the region.10 The Government also adopted the State Program on Fight against Corruption for \n2004\u20132006  and  established  the  Special  Anticorruption  Department  within  the  Prosecutor\u2019s \nOffice in March 2005 to undertake corruption-related investigations. Work is also underway to \nratify the United Nations Convention against Corruption. However, limited institutional capacity \nis a constraint on effective implementation of the law and the state program on anticorruption. \nThe Project will improve governance in the road subsector by strengthening RTSD\u2019s capacity for \nroad maintenance, axle-load control, road safety, and project management and implementation. \n \n11.  Government  Strategy.  With  assistance  from  ADB  and  development  partners,  the \nGovernment  developed  the  SPPRED  for  2003\u20132005,  which  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and \nfacilitate growth of employment and income. The Government is now preparing a new national \npoverty reduction strategy for 2006 onward. The Government also approved the State Program \non Socioeconomic Development of Regions for 2004\u2212200811 to promote regionally balanced \ndevelopment. In recognition of the importance of roads in poverty reduction and economic \ngrowth,  the  Government  developed  a  transport  development  program  (2005\u22122014).  \nThe  program  includes  (i)  improving  the  east\u2013west  and  north\u2013south  highways  by  2008,  \n(ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the transport sector, (iii) improving secondary and \nrural roads, and (iv) improving road maintenance. Given large funding requirements for road \ninfrastructure  investments  and  the  limitation  of  mobilizing  private  sector  resources,  the \nGovernment has requested external aid agencies including ADB to help finance improvement of \nthe main highways. The Government accords high priority to improving the east\u2013west highway. \nThe Project is highly relevant and responsive to Azerbaijan\u2019s needs. \n \n12.  ADB Assistance. ADB\u2019s assistance strategy for Azerbaijan12 aims to reduce poverty \nand raise living standards in a sustainable manner. Given Azerbaijan\u2019s location and reliance on \ntransport links with neighboring countries, the latest country strategy and program update13 \nidentifies transport as a strategically important sector for ADB assistance. In line with the \nGovernment\u2019s  priority,  ADB  assistance  to  roads  focuses  on  improving  main  highways  to \nenhance regional transport linkages, supporting policy reform, and strengthening institutional \ncapacity. The Project, which is ADB\u2019s first road project in Azerbaijan and is included in its \ncountry  assistance  program  for  2005,  is  consistent  with  its  country  strategy.  ADB  relied \nextensively on the sector studies undertaken by EBRD and the World Bank during project \npreparation. In April 2005 ADB approved a technical assistance grant to help the Government \n                                                 \n9  EBRD plans to help RTSD establish 4\u22126 regional maintenance management divisions and enable these divisions \nto operate on a commercial basis. \n10 World Bank. 2003.

External Assistance. The road subsector has received external assistance since the \nmid-1990s (Appendix 3). Following the completion of a feasibility study funded by EBRD and the \nKuwait Fund, external aid agencies provided credits to help improve the east\u2013west highway. \nImprovement  of  the  Alyat\u2013Hajigabul  section  financed  by  the  Kuwait  Fund  and  the  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank (IsDB) was completed in 2003. The sections under improvement include the \nGanja\u2013Qazakh section funded by the World Bank, Hajigabul\u2013Kyurdamir section by EBRD, and \nthe  Ujar\u2013Yevlakh  section  by  IsDB.  EBRD  approved  a  \u20ac70  million  loan  in  June  2005  for \nimproving the northern highway from Baku to the Russian border, with cofinancing from the \nExport-Import Bank of the Czech Republic. Iran is helping undertake a feasibility study on \nimproving the southern highway from Alyat to the Iranian border, and the World Bank plans to \nprovide a $200 million loan for financing, together with ADB. RTSD also received technical \nassistance  for  institutional  strengthening  from  the  World  Bank  and  the  European  Union.  \nThe Project will complement activities of development partners. ADB has cooperated closely \nwith them during project preparation and will continue to do so during implementation. \n \n14.  Lesson Learned. Azerbaijan joined ADB in 1999 and ADB operations in the country are \nat an early stage, with two approved loans.15. Thus substantive lessons cannot be drawn from \nADB operations in the country. However, the Project was designed with careful consideration of \nthe lessons and experience of development partners in Azerbaijan and ADB\u2019s similar projects in \nother transition economies. The following three lessons are particularly relevant. First, road \ninfrastructure investments must be accompanied by effective policy dialogue and institutional \nstrengthening to maximize development impact. Substantive policy dialogue on sector issues \n(e.g.,  road  maintenance,  axle-load  control,  and  road  safety)  was  conducted  during  project \npreparation and consequently strong policy content is included in the Project. Second, projects \ninvolving improvement of roads to borders should address cross-border issues, to the extent \npossible. The Project includes a component to address physical and institutional barriers at \nAzerbaijan\u2019s border with Georgia at Red Bridge to facilitate cross-border movements. Third, \nRTSD staff has limited knowledge of operational policies and procedures of multilateral financial \ninstitutions including ADB, which resulted in prolonged negotiations on EBRD loans and an \ninitial delay in implementing the World Bank-assisted road project. Close ADB supervision and \nprovision  of  consulting  services  are  necessary  to  support  project  management  and  avoid \nimplementation delays. Under the Project, substantive consulting services will be provided to \nhelp with project management and implementation. ADB will monitor project implementation \nclosely through the executing agencies\u2019 progress reports and its review missions. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the Project will be accelerated socioeconomic development in the six \nrayons of west Azerbaijan and enhanced regional cooperation. The outcome will be increased \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2005.

The Project covers six rayons (Agstafa, Ganja, Goranboy, Khanlar, Qazakh, and \nYevlakh) in west Azerbaijan, with total population of about 702,400. \nB.  Outputs \n1.  Improvement  of  the  East\u2013West  Highway  (Yevlakh\u2013Ganja  and  Qazakh\u2013\nGeorgian Border Sections) \n16.  The Project will improve a 127 km, two-lane paved road on two sections of the east\u2013\nwest highway: (i) the section between Yevlakh and Ganja via the Ganja bypass (89 km), and  \n(ii) the section between Qazakh and the Georgian border at Red Bridge (38 km). The project \nroad will conform to Azerbaijan\u2019s standards for a category II road, with a 7.5-meter (m)-wide \npavement and 3.75 m shoulders. It will be designed for a speed of 120 km per hour and have \ncumulative 13-ton axle loading over 15 years. It will be consistent with future upgrading to a \ncategory I road. Activities comprise (i) civil works; (ii) land acquisition and resettlement; and  \n(iii) consulting services for detailed design, construction supervision, road safety audit, social \nand environmental mitigation, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building. These activities \nwill be allocated $66.9 million (including local taxes and duties). \n2.  Improvement of Local Roads \n17.  The Project will improve 10 local roads totaling about 65 km in the project area to \nenhance local communities\u2019 access to the east\u2013west highway. Brief information on these local \nroads is in Appendix 4. The technical standards will be determined during the detailed design of \nthe  Project.  These  local  roads  were  selected  through  extensive  consultations  with  local \nstakeholders. Improvement of these local roads will enable about 8,100 households with more \nthan 29,000 people (a majority of whom are poor) in 21 adjoining villages to have better access \nto  jobs,  markets,  and  social  services  in  Baku,  Ganja,  Qazakh,  and  Yevlakh.  Local  road \nimprovement will be allocated $4.5 million (including local taxes and duties). \n3.  Institutional Strengthening for the Road Subsector \n18.  The Project will support policy reform and improve governance in the road subsector \nthrough  institutional  strengthening  with  the  objective  of  building  effective  institutions  for \nsustainable road network management. Consulting services and equipment will be provided to \nassist  in  implementing  the  recommendations  made  under  World  Bank  assistance.  It  will \ncomplement  EBRD  assistance  to  RTSD  to  implement  a  corporate  plan  and  a  financial \nmanagement system. The component will be allocated $3.0 million (including local taxes and \nduties). The institutional strengthening component will cover the following four areas: \n \n(i)  road  maintenance:  (a)  reorganization  of  regional  maintenance  units,  \n(b) support for operation of the regional maintenance units located in the project \narea through capacity building and provision of equipment, (c) implementation of \nthe  new  pavement  management  system,  (d)  prioritization  of  roads  for \nmaintenance,  and  (e)  identification  of  alternative  sources  of  maintenance \nfunding; \n(ii)  axle-load  control:  (a)  assessment  of  axle  overloading,  (b)  establishment  of \nvehicle weigh stations along the main roads, (c) support for operation of the \nvehicle weigh stations located in the project area through capacity building and \nprovision of equipment, and (d) strengthening of RTSD monitoring; \n ", "8   \n(iii)  road  safety:  (a)  implementation  of  the  new  national  road  safety  program \ndeveloped  with  World  Bank  assistance  in  April  2005;  (b)  improvement  of \ndomestic legislation and regulations on road safety; (c) development of road \naccident monitoring, reporting, and information systems; (d) assistance to RTSD \nin identifying accident black spots on the road network; and (e) capacity building; \nand \n(iv)  project management and implementation: (a) harmonization of the project \nimplementation  structure  for  aid-financed  road  projects,  (b)  preparation  of \noperational  guidelines  on  project  implementation  units,  (c)  development  of \nguidelines on environmental and social assessments and management for road \nprojects, and (d) capacity building. \n4.  Cross-Border Facilitation \n19.  The Project will facilitate movements of freight and passengers across Azerbaijan\u2019s \nborder (at Red Bridge) with Georgia by addressing physical and institutional barriers. Activities \ncomprise (i) civil works for improving border infrastructure for customs and frontier guard posts; \n(ii)  provision  of  equipment  for  inspection  of  vehicles  and  passengers;  and  (iii)  consulting \nservices to improve the existing cross-border agreement between Azerbaijan and Georgia, \nharmonize  and  simplify  cross-border  procedures  and  documentation  in  accordance  with \ninternational standards, address cross-border security issues, and build up the capacity of \nofficers serving at the border. Cross-border facilitation will be allocated $5.8 million (including \nlocal taxes and duties). \nC.  Special Features \n20.  Regional Cooperation. The Project will promote regional cooperation by improving \nAzerbaijan\u2019s segment of the trans-Caucasian road corridor and the facilities at Azerbaijan\u2019s \nborder (Red Bridge) with Georgia, and enhancing the capacity of Azeri officers serving at the \nborder. The east\u2013west highway forms part of the Asian highway network and has the potential \nto  become  an  important  corridor  for  transit  traffic  between  Asia  and  Europe.  \nThe majority of this highway has been or is being improved with external assistance; the Project \nwill improve the missing link of the highway. RTSD and the State Customs Committee will work \ntogether to implement the Project. Successful implementation of the Project will contribute to \nincreasing traffic and trade among Azerbaijan, Georgia, and other countries in the region. \n \n21.  Policy  Dialogue  and  Institutional  Strengthening.  Investment  in  roads  should  be \nlinked  to  a  strong  commitment  to  policy  reform  and  institution  building.  Given  that  road \nmaintenance, axle loading, and road safety are the main road subsector issues in Azerbaijan, \nADB  held  intensive  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  these  issues  during  project \npreparation. ADB assisted the Government in developing a road maintenance program that \nenvisages a gradual increase in maintenance funding to cover the entire road network by 2015. \nBecause the limited institutional capacity in the road subsector constitutes a major constraint to \naddressing these issues, the Project includes a strong institutional strengthening component, \nwhich will enhance RTSD\u2019s capacity for road maintenance, axle-load control, and road safety. \nThis  component  will  supplement  road  infrastructure  investment  to  achieve  sustainable \ndevelopment. The Project is ADB\u2019s first support for building effective institutions in Azerbaijan \nfor sustainable road management based on commercial principals. ADB will continue assistance \nin this direction under future road projects.  \n \n ", "    9 \n22.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation. During project preparation, ADB held \nextensive consultations with various stakeholders including representatives of central and local \ngovernments, civil society, local communities, the private sector, road users, and external aid \nagencies. More than 500 participated (Appendix 5). The consultations covered major issues \nsuch  as  project  alternatives,  selection  of  local  roads,  potential  benefits,  and  social  and \nenvironmental impacts. The results showed a high degree of public support for the Project.  \nThe project design has incorporated the views of stakeholders. Stakeholder participation and \nconsultation will continue during project implementation. \n \n23.  Aid  Harmonization  of  Project  Implementation  Arrangements.  Aid-funded  road \ninvestment projects are currently implemented primarily using individual project implementation \nunits (PIUs)16 in Azerbaijan. In April 2005 the World Bank proposed establishment of a larger \nPIU to replace the existing one for implementing its road projects. In accordance with ongoing \nefforts  to  harmonize  the  implementation  structure  for  aid-funded  projects,  during  project \npreparation  ADB  proposed,  and  the  World  Bank  and  EBRD  agreed,  that  the  PIU  will  be \nreorganized to manage implementation of all road projects supported by the three institutions. \nThe Project will enhance the PIU\u2019s capacity through preparation of operational guidelines; staff \ntraining;  and  financing  for  staff,  equipment,  and  operating  expenses  needed  for  project \nimplementation. This harmonized PIU structure will improve the efficiency of managing aid-\nfinanced  projects,  facilitate  aid  coordination  on  project  implementation,  mitigate  the \nGovernment\u2019s administrative resource constraints, and contribute to enhancing RTSD\u2019s capacity \nfor project management. \nD.  Cost Estimates \n24.  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, interest, and other \ncharges during construction, is estimated at $93.2 million equivalent.

Financing Plan \n25.  The Government has requested a blend of two loans from ADB: a loan of $49.0 million \nfrom the ordinary capital resources (OCR) and a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing Rights (SDR) 2,075,000 ($3.0 million equivalent) from the Special Funds resources to \nhelp finance the Project. The OCR loan will finance the road improvement and cross-border \nfacilitation components as well as project management, while the loan from the Special Funds \nresources will finance the institutional strengthening component. \n \n26.  The ADB loans will finance 55.8% of the total project cost. The OCR loan will have a 24-\nyear term including a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The loan from the Special Funds resources will have a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreement. \n \n27.  IsDB and the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) will provide loans of $10.4 million and \n$11.0 million equivalent, respectively, to cofinance the Project on a parallel basis. The IsDB and \nSFD  loans  will  finance  civil  works  and  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision  for \nimproving  about  50  km  from  Yevlakh  to  Ganja.  The  IsDB  loan,  which  was  approved  on  \n6 February 2005, has a maturity of 25 years including a grace period of 7 years. The SFD loan, \nwhich is expected to be approved within 2005, will have a maturity of 20 years including a grace \nperiod of 5 years with an interest rate of 3% per annum. The Government will finance the \nremainder of the total project cost ($19.8 million) including local taxes and duties. The proposed \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \nSource  Total Cost  ($ million)  Percent of Project Cost \nAsian Development Bank     \n  Ordinary capital resources  49.0  52.6 \n  Special Funds resources  3.0  3.2 \nIslamic Development Bank  10.4  11.2 \nSaudi Fund for Development  11.0  11.8 \nAzerbaijan Governmenta  19.8  21.2 \nTotal  93.2  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n28.  The  executing  agencies  will  be  RTSD  for  the  road  improvement  and  institutional \nstrengthening  components,  and  the  State  Customs  Committee  (SCC)  for  the  cross-border \nfacilitation component. In line with efforts to harmonize the implementation structure for aid-\nfinanced projects, the existing PIU in RTSD will be reorganized to manage all road projects \n ", "    11 \nsupported by ADB, EBRD, and World Bank, including ADB-funded activities under the Project.17 \nThis joint PIU is justifiable because RTSD is newly established and has limited capacity for \nproject management and implementation. The PIU will comprise RTSD staff and externally \ncontracted staff to supplement limited human resources in RTSD. It will be headed by a project \ndirector, who will be assisted by a team of qualified technical, financial, and support staff.  \nADB  will  finance  staff,  equipment,  and  operating  expenses  in  the  PIU  needed  for  project \nimplementation  from  its  OCR  loan.18  ADB  financing  for  PIU  costs  is  justifiable  because  \n(i)  RTSD\u2019s  limited  capacity  for  project  management  and  implementation  needs  to  be \ncomplemented, and (ii) this is an integral part of ADB\u2019s support for road subsector institutional \nstrengthening. The Government has given assurance that, upon completion of the present \nprojects, PIU staff will be integrated in RTSD to implement future projects. SCC will appoint a \nproject coordinator to manage implementation of the cross-border facilitation component and \nliaise with RTSD and other relevant government agencies during implementation. \n \n29.  A project steering committee (PSC) will be established to ensure close interagency \ncoordination and supervise implementation. The PSC will be chaired by the RTSD director and \nwill comprise representatives of the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Finance, \nMinistry of Transport, PIU project director, and the SCC project coordinator. Representatives of \nrelevant local communities will be invited to PSC meetings for local road improvement. The PSC \nwill  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  review  implementation  progress  and  provide  approvals  and \nguidance on project implementation as necessary. \n2.  Implementation Period \n30.  The Project will be implemented over about 4 years, with estimated completion by \nNovember 2009. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n3.  Procurement \n31.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Civil works will be divided into 15 contracts; ADB will finance 14 and IsDB and \nSFD will jointly finance one. ADB-funded civil works contracts for improving the Yevlakh\u2013Ganja \nand Qazakh\u2013Georgian border road sections will be procured through international competitive \nbidding  procedures.  The  civil  works  contracts  for  improving  local  roads  and  cross-border \nfacilities at Red Bridge will be procured through local competitive bidding procedures acceptable \nto ADB, since these contracts will cost no more than $2.0 million each and domestic contractors \nare capable of undertaking such work. Procurement of equipment for border inspection, road \nmaintenance, and weighing vehicles will follow international competitive bidding procedures. \nThe proposed ADB-financed contract packages are in Appendix 8. \n \n32.  ADB  approved  advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works  on  10  May  2005.  \nThe advance procurement action will cover selecting a consulting firm for detailed design and \nconstruction supervision, prequalifying contractors, tendering, and bid evaluation, but will not \ninclude contract awards. The advance action will be undertaken according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. The Government was advised that ADB approval of advance procurement \n                                                 \n17 This PIU will replace the existing one for implementing the World Bank-assisted Highway Project and EBRD-\nassisted Silk Road Project. IsDB and SFD will use IsDB\u2019s existing project management unit for the Ujar\u2013Yevlakh \nRoad Reconstruction Project to implement their funded project activities. \n18 Specifically,  ADB  will  finance  salaries  of  a  highway  engineer,  procurement  specialist,  financial  specialist, \nadministrative assistant, and driver, as well as related office equipment and supplies in the PIU. \n ", "12   \naction does not commit ADB to finance the Project and that ADB will not finance expenses paid \nby the Government prior to loan effectiveness. \n4.  Consulting Services \n33.  The Project will require 993 person-months of consulting services (104 international and \n889 domestic). RTSD will engage (i) a consulting firm for 869 person-months (64 international \nand 805 domestic) for detailed design and construction supervision for improving the east\u2013west \nhighway and local roads, and (ii) a consulting firm for 94 person-months (30 international and  \n64  domestic)  for  institutional  strengthening.  SCC  will  engage  individual  consultants  for  \n30  person-months  (10  international  and  20  domestic)  for  cross-border  facilitation.  \nThe Government requested that the international consultants collaborate with the domestic \nconsultants. ADB will finance consulting services for detailed design for all the project roads; \nconstruction  supervision  for  ADB-financed  sections;  institutional  strengthening; procurement \nsupport;  resettlement,  social,  poverty,  and  environmental  monitoring;  and  cross-border \nfacilitation. IsDB will finance consulting services for construction supervision for the section \nfunded by the IsDB and SFD loans. ADB-financed consultants will be selected and engaged \naccording to the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its \nBorrowers and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants. ADB-funded consulting firms will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method  under  full  technical  proposals.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in supplementary appendixes A and B. \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n34.  The  ADB  loans  will  be  disbursed  according  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  \nFor consulting services, civil works, and equipment following international competitive bidding \nprocedures, loan funds will be disbursed using direct payment. For civil works following local \ncompetitive bidding procedures and PIU expenses financed from the OCR loan, reimbursement \nprocedures will be applied through the imprest account. The Ministry of Finance will open, after \nloan effectiveness, an imprest account in a commercial bank in Azerbaijan acceptable to ADB. \nThe combined initial advance to the imprest account will not exceed estimated expenses for  \n6 months or 10% of the OCR loan amount, whichever is lower. Any individual payment to be \nreimbursed or liquidated under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will not exceed \n$100,000 equivalent. \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n35.  RTSD and SCC will maintain separate project accounts and financial statements, and \nwill have them audited annually according to sound auditing standards by independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The annual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditures. RTSD will submit to ADB certified copies of \nconsolidated annual audited project accounts and related financial statements as well as the \nauditor\u2019s  report  in  English  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year  during  project \nimplementation. RTSD and SCC were advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for timely submission of \naudited project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements of the \nADB loans in case of noncompliance with the requirement. RTSD and SCC will jointly prepare \nand submit to ADB (i) quarterly progress reports during project implementation, and (ii) a project \ncompletion report within 3 months of project completion to facilitate project postevaluation. \n ", "    13 \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n36.  A set of targets/indicators for monitoring and evaluation of project performance relating \nto the project impact, outcome, and outputs were discussed and finalized with the Government, \nRTSD, and SCC during loan appraisal (key performance indicators/targets are provided in \nAppendix  1).  With  assistance  of  the  PIU,  SCC  project  coordinator,  and  the  supervision \nconsultant, RTSD will establish a project performance management system acceptable to ADB. \nThe  baseline  values  for  project  impact  indicators  will  be  fully  established  prior  to \nimplementation. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by sex. Baseline surveys will \nbe conducted annually and the findings included in the project completion report. At inception, \nproject completion, and 3 years after completion, RTSD and SCC will jointly prepare and submit \nto ADB a report that summarizes the key findings of project monitoring and evaluation. \n8.  Project Review \n37.  In addition to annual regular reviews by ADB staff, the Government and ADB will jointly \nundertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  in  2007  to  assess  (i)  implementation  status,  \n(ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii)  performance  of  consultants  and  contractors,  \n(iv) project impacts, (v) progress of sector reform, (vi) status of compliance with the covenants \nstipulated in the loan agreements, and (vii) the need for any changes in the project scope or \nschedule to achieve the project impact. \n9.  Anticorruption Measures \n38.  During project preparation, ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, RTSD, and SCC. The Government, RTSD, and SCC agreed to follow \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy during project implementation. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly, or through its agencies, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices \nrelated to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. If ADB \ndetermines that representatives of the borrower, a beneficiary, a contractor, and/or a consultant \nengaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices, ADB may take the following \nactions: (i) reject any proposal for contract award; and/or (ii) declare any firm or individual \nineligible for award of any ADB-financed contracts, indefinitely or for a stated period of time.  \n \n39.  Specifically,  RTSD  and  SCC  will  take  the  following  anticorruption  measures:  \n(i) anticorruption provisions acceptable to ADB will be included in all bidding documents and \ncontracts, including provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the executing agencies and all contracts, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project; (ii) all decisions relating to procurement will be made by \nthe  Tendering  Committee,  which  comprises  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, State Customs Committee, and State \nProcurement  Agency,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the \nProcurement Law of Azerbaijan; (iii) functioning as the engineer under FIDIC19 conditions, the \nsupervision consultant will verify the contractors\u2019 payment claims in accordance with contract \nspecifications; and (iv) ADB-financed independent auditors will be engaged to audit project \naccounts  and  financial  statements,  and  certified  copies  of  the  audited  documents  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. The Project will also improve \n                                                 \n19 FIDIC \u2013 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Ing\u00e9nieurs-Conseils, the International Federation of Consulting Engineers.  \n ", "14   \ngovernance at the broader subsector level through the institutional strengthening component to \nenhance RTSD\u2019s capacity for managing road maintenance, axle-load control, road safety, and \nproject implementation. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n40.  The Project will benefit people living along the Yevlakh\u2013Ganja and Qazakh\u2013Georgian \nborder sections of the east\u2013west highway; road users; construction companies; traders; and \nother people who derive income from expanded traffic, trade, and investment in the region.  \nThe major direct benefits will include (i) lower road transport and maintenance costs, (ii) faster \nand more reliable road transport services, (iii) improved access of local communities to markets \nand social services, (iv) jobs and income created during project implementation (i.e., use of local \nlabor  and  construction  materials)  and  after  project  completion  (i.e.,  roadside  businesses),  \n(v) efficient movement of freight and passengers across Azerbaijan\u2019s border (at Red Bridge) \nwith Georgia, and (vi) strengthened institutional capacity in the road subsector. The Project is \nexpected to create 5,250 person-months of skilled jobs at about $400 per person per month and \n3,000 person-months of unskilled jobs at about $200 per person per month. Indirect benefits will \nbe increased business and job opportunities that have backward or forward linkages to the \nProject, and growing trade among Azerbaijan, Georgia, and other countries in the region. \n \n41.  A distribution analysis shows that the Project will result in total net benefits of $71.8 \nmillion, comprising $44.0 million for passengers, $11.6 million for freight operators, $15.9 million \nfor the Government, and $0.3 million for labor. Road users (passengers and freight operators) \nare the largest beneficiary group, accounting for 77.5% of the total net project benefits. \nB.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n42.  Traffic forecasts were made for the project road for 2005\u22122028 based on the traffic \nsurveys conducted during project preparation, projected growth of GDP and population, as well \nas the estimated income elasticity of demand. Based on economic and population growth \nprojections, passenger traffic on the project road is forecast to grow annually by 7.8% for \n2005\u22122009 and 6.8% for 2010\u22122028, while freight traffic on the project road is projected to \nincrease annually by 7.5% and 6.0% for the respective periods. These traffic forecasts are \nreasonable compared with actual annual growth of combined freight and passenger traffic \nduring 1999\u20132005, which was 9.9% on the Yevlax\u2013Ganja section and 9.5% on the Qazakh\u2013\nGeorgian border section. \n \n43.  The economic analysis of the Project compares the with- and without-project cases and \nweights project benefits against project costs. The analysis is based on 2005 prices and covers \n24 years (2005\u22122028), comprising 4 years of project implementation and 20 years of operation \n(Appendix 9). The major project benefits are savings on vehicle operating cost and travel time \ndue to reduced roughness on road surfaces. The benefits from vehicle operating cost savings, \nwhich initially accrue to vehicle owners and operators, will be shared gradually with passengers \nand freight customers through reduced freight charges and bus fares. The Project will contribute \nto reducing road accidents, but such benefits are not quantifiable and thus are not included in \nthe economic analysis. The project costs cover capital investment and maintenance costs. \n \n44.  The results show that the Project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) of 17.9% and a net present value of $17.0 million at a 12% discount rate.  \n ", "    15 \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  confirms  the  Project\u2019s  economic  viability,  with  the  EIRR  remaining \nhigher than 12.0% when (i) capital investment costs increase by 20%, (ii) project benefits \ndecrease by 20%, (iii) traffic growth declines by 20%, or (iv) both capital investment costs \nincrease by 20% and project benefits decrease by 20%. The risk analysis demonstrates that  \n(i) the Project\u2019s EIRR has a 95 percentile value of 19.3% and a 5 percentile value of 15.5%, and \n(ii) the Project\u2019s net present value has a 95 percentile value of $32.3 million and a 5 percentile \nvalue of $8.1 million. The risk analysis further confirms the Project\u2019s economic robustness. \n \n45.  The  Project  is  not  a  revenue-earning  project  that  requires  a  financial  analysis.  \nAn analysis of the fiscal impact of the Project was made to assess counterpart funding for, and \ndebt  repayment  from,  the  Project.  The  Government  has  committed  to  provide  counterpart \nfunding of $19.8 million during project implementation. The external debt burden in Azerbaijan \nremains moderate, with the stock of public and publicly guaranteed debt at 18.6% of GDP and \nthe debt service ratio at 3.7% in 2004. Given the projection of continued growth in Azerbaijan \nand resultant increase in government revenues over the medium term, the Government is very \nlikely to provide counterpart funding in a timely manner and the Project will have a limited \nimpact on the debt repayment situation in the country. The Project is thus deemed financially \nsustainable. \nC.  Project Impacts \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n46.  The  Project  does  not  require  significant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  as  road \nimprovement activities are largely confined to the existing alignment. Minor realignment may \nrequire land acquisition, but will have no impact on structures. Temporary land occupation for \nborrow  areas,  disposal  areas,  and  construction  camps  during  construction  will  require \ncompensation for loss of crops or trees. In 2004, the Government initiated a national program to \nclear  structures  within  the  road  reserve.  For  the  project  road,  an  inventory  identified  \n213 businesses and residences within the road reserve; 61 nontitled roadside businesses were \nremoved along the Yevlakh\u2013Ganja section. The owners of most of these businesses were \naware that they would need to remove the businesses at their own expenses according to \ndomestic  laws.  Local  authorities  and  RTSD  assisted  in  removing  these  businesses  and \nacquiring  land  plots  for  the  owners  to  build  permanent  shops.  So  far,  29  businesses  are \noperating in their new shops, 24 businesses are under construction, and 8 businesses are \nawaiting approval of land certificates. The businesses investigated by ADB staff during project \npreparation were satisfied with the removal procedures and the support received. \n \n47.  RTSD has prepared a resettlement plan, the first resettlement document for aid-financed \nroad projects in Azerbaijan (supplementary appendix C). The summary resettlement plan is in \nAppendix 10. The resettlement plan provides the compensation standards and entitlements for \naffected land, housing, businesses, trees, attachments, and public infrastructure according to \ndomestic laws and regulations as well as ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. The plan \nincludes retrofit measures for eligible businesses removed and measures for future resettlement \nimpacts during the upgrading of the highway and local roads, and clearance of the road reserve. \nThe plan was disclosed to local governments and affected people on 14 June 2005. RTSD \nagreed to suspend further demolition of structures from the road reserve until ADB approves the \nresettlement plan. When detailed design is completed in 2006, RTSD will update the plan, \ndisclose it to those affected, and submit it for ADB approval prior to the commencement of civil \nworks. The Ecology and Safety Section, Road Maintenance Division of RTSD is responsible for \nupdating  the  resettlement  plan  and  supervising  its  implementation.  RTSD  will  engage  an \n ", "16   \nindependent  monitor  acceptable  to  ADB  to  carry  out  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nresettlement impacts during project implementation. \n2.  Poverty Reduction, Social, and Gender Impacts \n48.  The Project will benefit about 261,000 poor people (37.2% of total project beneficiaries) \nin the project area; the total benefits to be received by the poor are estimated at $7.1 million. \nAlthough the project benefits for the poor are relatively small, the Project will create an enabling \nenvironment for poverty reduction. The major poverty reduction impacts of the Project will \ninclude (i) reduced prices of transport services, food, and other daily necessities due to lower \ntransport costs; (ii) jobs and income for the poor in road improvement and maintenance as well \nas roadside businesses; and (iii) improved access of the poor to markets and social services.  \nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n49.  The Project has no impact on indigenous peoples. Ethnic Azeri accounts for 98.6% of \nthe population in the project area; few other nationalities include Kurds, Russian, and Turks.  \nThe minorities are neither indigenous nor negatively affected by the Project. The Project will \nhave a positive impact on gender, because the civil works contracts will include provisions to \nencourage employment of women during project implementation, and the Project will promote \nwomen\u2019s participation in activities to monitor project impacts on local communities. \n \n50.  In 2004, 718 HIV/AIDS20 cases (including 38 cases in the project area) were reported. \nConstruction workers, truck drivers, sex workers, and intravenous drug users are among the \ngroups  at  high  risks  of  HIV  infection.  The  International  Medical  Corp  is  implementing  an \nHIV/AIDS awareness and prevention program in the project area, which includes (i) training to \nlocal  communities,  truck  drivers,  doctors,  and  nurses;  (ii)  condom  distribution;  and  \n(iii) improvement of local health facilities. All civil works bidding documents and contracts under \nthe Project will include provisions requiring contractors to take measures to protect construction \nworkers and local residents, especially women, from potential risks of HIV/AIDS and other \nsexually transmitted infections. These measures include raising public awareness of the risks of \nHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, and giving construction workers time to be \ntested or receive treatment. \n \n51.  The Project includes appropriate measures to mitigate the potential risk of drug and \nhuman trafficking. The provision of inspection equipment at the border of Red Bridge and \ncapacity building for officers serving at the border will greatly assist in preventing drug and \nhuman trafficking. The roadside stations that will be included in the detailed project design will \noffer  a  venue  for  advocacy  and  awareness  campaigns  on  prevention  of  drug  and  human \ntrafficking in the future. ADB is undertaking a study on HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in \nAzerbaijan. Based on the findings, ADB will consider an appropriate modality of assistance. \n3.  Environmental Impact \n52.  The Project is classified as Category B. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nundertaken (supplementary appendix D) and the summary IEE is in Appendix 12. The IEE \nconcludes that the Project will have no major adverse impacts on the environment, as road \nimprovement will be primarily carried out on the existing alignment. Minor realignments may be \nmade within the road reserve to ensure the horizontal radii and forward sight distances are \nsuitable for the designed speed. Temporary use of land adjacent to the project road, removal of \n                                                 \n20 HIV/AIDS refers to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "    17 \nroadside vegetation, temporary land-take for the site of the contractor\u2019s yard, as well as the \nextraction and transport of construction material from borrow sites will have temporary impacts \non the environment during project implementation. No protected or environmentally sensitive \nareas  such  as  designated  wetlands,  forests,  nature  conservation  areas,  and  places  of \narchaeological importance are within or near the project area. \n \n53.  The mitigation measures identified in the IEE include (i) carefully selecting construction \nsites, borrow areas, and quarries and restoring them soon after project completion; (ii) avoiding \naggravation of soil erosion-prone areas; (iii) controlling sewage discharge and other waste fluids \nfrom construction sites, and hazardous and toxic materials from asphalt and crushing plants and \nfrom  construction  equipment;  (iv)  maintaining  proper  drainage  to  avoid  stagnation  and \ncontrolling downstream water pollution; (v) reinstating vegetation and trees that are affected by \nconstruction activities but are needed to prevent soil erosion; (vi) controlling disturbances to \nanimals  and  pastures;  and  (vii)  minimizing  noise,  dust,  emissions,  and  other  pollutants \nassociated with civil works. The civil works contractors will take these mitigation measures, \nwhile the supervision consultant, RTSD, and concerned government environmental agencies \nwill monitor their implementation. \nD.  Project Assumptions and Risks \n54.  The Project was designed based on the following key assumptions: (i) continued political \nstability and economic growth in Azerbaijan and the region, (ii) the Government\u2019s continued \ncommitment to regional cooperation, (iii) effective implementation of the Government\u2019s transport \ndevelopment program (2005\u20132014), (iv) timely provision of counterpart funding, and (v) timely \ncofinancing from IsDB and SFD. \n \n55.  The  Project\u2019s  major  potential  risk  is  that  the  project  roads  after  completion  may \nexperience  a  higher  than  anticipated  rate  of  deterioration  due  to  axle  overloading  and \ninadequate  funding  for  maintenance.  Because  the  limited  institutional  capacity  in  the  road \nsubsector constitutes a major constraint to addressing these issues, the Project will mitigate this \nrisk through institutional strengthening assistance to the road subsector, accompanied by loan \nconditionality. The Project will help enforce axle-load regulations by assisting RTSD to establish \nand operate vehicle weigh stations along the main roads and improve monitoring. During project \npreparation, ADB assisted the Government in developing a road maintenance program, which \nenvisages a steady increase in maintenance funding to cover the entire road network by 2015. \nThe Government is committed to implementing the road maintenance program. The Project will \nsupport implementation of the program by assisting RTSD in reorganizing regional maintenance \nunits, prioritizing roads for maintenance, utilizing the newly developed pavement management \nsystem, and identifying alternative sources for maintenance funding. Given the complexity of \nthese issues, the Project is ADB\u2019s first support for building effective institutions in Azerbaijan for \nsustainable road management according to commercial principals. ADB will continue assistance \nin this direction under future road projects. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n56.

The Government, through RTSD and SCC, \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. The Government acknowledges that ADB, \nconsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  reserves  the  right  to  undertake  directly,  or  through  its  agents, \ninvestigation of any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices \nrelated to the Project. The Government will cooperate with such investigation and \nextend  all  necessary  assistance  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and \nrecords, and engaging independent experts who may be needed for satisfactory \ncompletion of such investigations. All costs related to such investigations will be \nborne by the Project. The Government, through RTSD and SCC, will ensure that \nthe following anticorruption measures during project implementation are taken: \n(a) anticorruption provisions acceptable to ADB will be included in all bidding \ndocuments and contracts, including provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the executing agencies and all contracts, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project; \n(b)  all  decisions  relating  to  procurement  will  be  made  by  the  Tendering \nCommittee,  which  comprises  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Transport,  State  Customs \nCommittee,  and  State  Procurement  Agency,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement and the Procurement Law of Azerbaijan; and (c) the \nsupervision consultant will verify the contractors\u2019 payment claims in accordance \nwith contract specifications. \n(xi)  Labor laws.

Background \n1.  Azerbaijan occupies a key location in the regional transport network of the southern \nCaucasus. The country\u2019s east\u2013west road and railway routes carry traffic between the Caspian \nand  Black  seas  on  a  section  of  the  \u201csilk  road\u201d  transport  corridor  linking  Asia  to  Europe.  \nThe  country\u2019s  north\u2013south  road  and  rail  routes  connect  the  Russian  Federation  and  Iran.  \nThe transport sector plays an important role in the national economy, accounting for 10.2% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2003. \n \n2.  Like other sectors, Azerbaijan\u2019s roads are facing the challenges of the transition from a \ncentrally planned to a market-based economy. Although many good laws, regulations, and \nprocedures are in place, the major challenge is related to implementing. In this regard, a \nnumber of issues need to be addressed, particularly in the areas of road maintenance, axle-load \ncontrol, and road safety. \n \nB.  Transport Demand \n3.  The transport sector comprises railways, roads, air aviation, sea transport, pipelines, and \nurban transport. The demand for freight and passenger transport by mode is shown in Table \nA2.1.  Freight  transport  demand  increased  at  an  annual  average  rate  of  11.6%  during \n2000\u22122003. Freight demand was mainly met by railways (35%), followed by sea transport \n(30%), and roads (28%). Although the volume of freight transport carried by railways is greater \nthan by roads, fundamental differences in type of freight carried result in limited opportunity for \ncompetition and modal shift between railways and roads. The major freight carried by railways is \ncrude  oil  and  refined  oil  products  from  Baku.  While  this  is  expected  to  continue  in  the \nforeseeable future, crude oil will be partially transported through the recently opened Baku\u2013\nTbilisi\u2013Ceyhan oil pipeline. Moreover, freight demand for road transport grew by 21% annually \nduring 2000\u22122003, more rapidly than for other modes of transport. The potential for growth in \nfreight demand for road transport is significant. As transport demand becomes more diversified, \nspecific features such as speed, reliability, waiting time, minimization of losses and damages, \nand ability to move smaller loads more efficiently will assume greater priority than they did in the \npast.  These  features  will  require  flexible,  cost-effective,  and  responsive  transport  services.  \nRoad transport is better placed than other modes of transport to meet these needs by providing \nefficient services and infrastructure needed to facilitate expected growth. \n \n4.  Passenger transport has grown steadily since 2000; demand is recovering from the low \npoints experienced in the late 1990s. Roads are the dominant mode of transport, accounting for \nnearly 80% of passenger transport. Civil aviation accounts for 9%, urban transport for 8%, and \nrailways for 7% of the total demand. While the modal share between road and rail transport may \nbe distorted by the overwhelming use of roads for short-distance urban trips, with continued \neconomic growth demand for passenger transport by roads is expected to increase because \nlocal  and  regional  buses  provide  a  quicker  and  more  convenient  services  than  railways, \nparticularly to intermediate locations. With the improvement of the east\u2013west and north\u2013south \nhighways, bus transport operators are expected to provide new buses that will improve services \nand increase the modal share of road transport. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  25\nTable A2.1: Freight and Passenger Transport by Mode in Azerbaijan \n \nTransport Mode  1990  1995  2000  2001  2002  2003 \n  Freight Transport (million ton-kilometers) \nRailways  37,076  2,409  5,770  6,141  6,980  7,719 \nRoads  3,287  527  3,513  4,843  5,534  6,241 \nSea  5,778  4,325  5,192  5,744  6,077  6,555 \nCivil Aviation  47  57  102  76  84  78 \nPipelines  3,353  1,013  1,371  1,643  1,602  1,572 \n  Total  49,541  8,331  15,948  18,447  20,277  22,165 \n  Passenger Transport (million passenger-kilometers) \nRailways  1,827  791  493  537  584  654 \nRoads  7,480  4,664  9,153  9,442  9,603  9,861 \nSea  68  24  6  5  6  6 \nCivil Aviation  4,869  1,733  798  827  884  1,113 \nUrban Transporta  1,721  6,065  10,070  10,372  10,494  10,828 \n  Total  15,965  13,277  20,520  21,183  21,571  22,462 \na  Including tram, trolley, and subway. \nSource: Government of Azerbaijan. 2004.

Approximately 52% of the roads are paved, 47% gravel, and the remaining earth \ntracks. The road network was primarily developed under the former Soviet Union for higher than \ncurrent traffic volumes. Due to lack of resources for maintenance, about 75% of the network is \nin poor condition. Based on the road condition data available, 61% of the east\u2013west and north\u2013\nsouth highways, 76% of other national roads, 66% of secondary roads, and 76% of rural roads \nrequire rehabilitation. In recognition of the importance of improving the road network to facilitate \nsocioeconomic development, the Government embarked on a transport development program \n(2005\u20132014), starting with the east\u2013west and north\u2013south highways. The Government is also \nfinalizing a program for improving secondary roads. \n \nTable A2.2: Summary of the Road Network in Azerbaijan, 2004 \n \nLength (kilometer) \nRoad Category \nPaved  Gravel  Earth Track  Total \nCategory I  175  0  0  175 \nCategory II   851  0  0  851 \nCategory III  5,537  0  0  5,537 \nCategory IV   3,244  7,179  0  10,423 \nCategory V  0  1,608  205  1,813 \n  Total  9,807  8,787  205  18,799 \n0 = magnitude zero. \nSource: Road Transport Service Department. \n \n6.  Most  technical  standards  and  specifications  for  road  design,  construction,  and \nmaintenance date from the Soviet era. Although the standards are based on sound technical \nprinciples,  they  contain  rigid  criteria  for  upgrading  road  capacity  that  are  based  on  traffic \nvolumes and do not consider the level of services or economic viability. The inappropriateness \nof such standards for a market-based economy is widely recognized; they need updated to \nmatch the needs and economic resource base in the country. \n \n ", " 26  Appendix 2 \nD.  Vehicle Fleet \n7.  The use of motor vehicles in the country is low by international standards. The vehicle \nfleet numbered 486,800 in 2003, equivalent to 58 vehicles per 1,000 people (Table A2.3). \nVehicle ownership varies regionally, with an average of 20 vehicles per 100 families nationwide \nin 2003 compared with 30 vehicles in Baku, 26 in Ganja, 20 in Goranboy, and 19 in Yevlakh.1 \nMost  of  the  vehicles  were  produced  before  1990  and  need  to  be  replaced.

Presidential Decree No. 299 issued in March 2000 on the application of the Law of \nRoads  of  December  1999  defines  the  general  basis  for  design,  construction,  operation, \nmaintenance,  and  development  of  roads  and  associated  structures  as  well  as  the  legal, \ntechnical, economic, and institutional principles for road management. The decree also outlines \nthe basic relations between stakeholders in the road subsector. \n \n9.  Prior to 2003, Azeravtoyol, a state joint stock company, managed the road subsector. \nAzeravtoyol was formed in 1993 and modeled around centralized decision-making processes, \nbureaucracy, and administration procedures inherited from the former Soviet Union. Because \nthe  organization  was  weak  and  could  not  perform  its  functions  properly,  the  Government \ndissolved Azeravtoyol and in 2003 established the Ministry of Transport to assume overall \nresponsibility  for  policy,  regulations,  and  administration  of  the  transport  sector.  The  road \nsubsector falls under the responsibility of two departments of the Ministry of Transport: Road \nTransport  Service  Department  (RTSD)  and  Auto  Transport  Service  Department.  RTSD  is \nresponsible for planning, managing, and maintaining the road network infrastructure. RTSD has \na headquarters unit in Baku with 90 staff and 61 regional units with approximately 3,000 staff, \nprimarily responsible for individual rayons. An organization structure of RTSD headquarters is in \nFigure  A2.  The  Auto  Transport  Service  Department  is  responsible  for  formulating  and \nimplementing regulations on passenger and freight transport services, including (i) intercity \npassenger services, (ii) freight transport services, (iii) foreign vehicles entering and leaving \nAzerbaijan, (iv) vehicle emission requirements, and (v) coordination with transport ministries in \nother countries. \n \n10.  The creation of RTSD to replace Azeravtoyol is a major achievement. RTSD received \nassistance from the World Bank for institutional strengthening during 2003\u2013April 2005. This \nprogram covered 11 areas, with the major components including (i) developing a corporate plan, \n(ii)  reviewing  road  user  charges,  (iii)  establishing  a  pavement  management  system,  \n(iv) formulating a financial management system, (v) developing a multiyear rolling budget, and \n                                                 \n1  Republic of Azerbaijan. 2004.

However, the assistance had neither the schedule \nnor resources to assist RTSD in implementing the recommendations. Further assistance from \nexternal aid agencies is needed to support continued policy reform and institution building to \nenable the road subsector to achieve tangible results and sustainable development. \n \nFigure A2: Organization Chart of the Road Transport Service Department \n(Headquarters) \n \n \n \n  Director \n \n \n \nDeputy \n \nADMINISTRATION DIVISON  Director \n  -  Personnel \n  -  Legal \n-  Secretariat  \n \n-  Households \n  -  Financial \n-  Reporting \n \n-  Economic Analysis  \n \n \n \n \nROAD MAINTENANCE  TECHNICAL  TRANSPORT  INVESTMENT \n \nDIVISION  DEIVISION  DIVISION  DIVISION \n  -  Road Structure  -  Project Cost  -  Railways  -  Investment Planning \n  -  Traffic Regulations  Estimates  -  Transport equipment  -  Project Management \n-  Ecology and Safety  -    Project Examination  -  Procurement \n \n-  Technical Standards -  Foreign Relations\n \nSource: Road Transport Service Department. \n \nF.  Financial Management \n11.  Prior to 2001, roads were financed primarily through the Road Fund created in 1994.  \nAll revenues collected from taxes related to roads were credited to the Road Fund during that \nperiod. Since the abolition of the Road Fund in 2001, all revenues from taxes related to roads \nhave been credited to government budgets. Currently three taxes are involved: transit fees (on \nforeign vehicles), annual vehicle tax, and fuel tax.  \n \n12.  Road expenses are financed primarily by the Government through budgetary allocation \nto  RTSD.  RTSD\u2019s  total  expenses  for  2003  amounted  to  AZM93.0  billion  ($19.2  million), \ncomprising AZM70.0 billion ($14.5 million) for capital and recurrent expenditures and AZM23.0 \nbillion ($4.7 million) for salaries and administrative expenses at headquarters. However, no \nfinancial audit has been undertaken to assess the effectiveness of RTSD\u2019s use of the funds. \nThe Azerbaijan Accounting Chamber, the Government audit office, scheduled an audit of RTSD \nin 2005. \n \n13.  RTSD\u2019s financial management capacity is limited due to the scarcity of experienced \nhuman  resources,  inadequate  staff  training,  and  lack  of  a  computer-based  management \ninformation  system.  In  recognition  of  this,  RTSD  proposes  a  reorganization  involving  the \nestablishment of four regional offices and bringing all local offices under the proposed regional \noffices. RTSD\u2019s proposed structural changes are waiting for Ministry of Transport approval. ", " 28  Appendix 2 \n14.  Strengthening  RTSD\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  has  been  one  of  the  major \ncomponents of external assistance. Under its technical assistance, the World Bank proposed \nthat  RTSD  adopt  a  budgetary  system  based  on  six  activities:  (i)  road  management  and \nadministration at headquarters, (ii) planning and design, (iii) routine maintenance, (iv) periodic \nmaintenance,  (v)  rehabilitation,  and  (vi)  road  network  development.  The  World  Bank  also \nassisted RTSD in developing a computerized accounting system. Although equipment was \npurchased and staff training provided, RTSD has not yet received the approval of the Ministry of \nTransport to implement the computerized accounting system. The World Bank also prepared a \nmanual on financial management for RTSD and proposed that RTSD implement an expenditure \nplan to rehabilitate the national road network during 2005\u22122009; this envisages a doubling of \nRTSD\u2019s expenditure on capital and recurrent works and external funding for road rehabilitation. \nHowever,  the  current  constraint  is  RTSD\u2019s  limited  capacity  to  implement  the  World  Bank \nrecommendations. Efforts are needed to improve RTSD\u2019s capacity for financial management. \n \nG.  Road Maintenance  \n15.  Azerbaijan inherited a large stock of road infrastructure from the former Soviet Union and \nis thus facing a challenge of properly maintaining the road network with limited resources. \nBased on the assumption that the entire road network is maintainable, RTSD estimates that \nannual  road  maintenance  costs  for  2005  are  about  $260  million.  According  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff assessment, however, the total annual road maintenance costs \nare lower at $73.4 million due to lower unit rates (Table A2.4). ADB staff also estimates that only \n25%  of  the  road  network  is  currently  maintainable  and  the  total  maintenance  funding \nrequirements  for  2005  thus  amount  to  $37  million.  Although  the  Government  significantly \nincreased the budgetary allocation for road maintenance from AZM31.8 billion ($6.7 million) in \n2001  to  AZM153.0  billion  ($31.5  million)  in  2005  (Table  A2.5),  road  maintenance  funding \nremained  inadequate.

Road maintenance is undertaken by RTSD\u2019s 61 rayon-based road maintenance units on \na  force  account  basis.  Each  unit  is  responsible  for  the  main  and  secondary  roads  in  an \nindividual  rayon,  and  operates  using  its  own  labor  force  and  construction  plants.  \nThe construction plants owned by the road maintenance units are inherited from the former \nSoviet Union and much of it is not serviceable. \n \n17.  Roads improved under the Government\u2019s transport development program cannot be \nsustained without adequate resources to properly maintain them. Effective measures need to be \ntaken to ensure that these roads will be able to provide the required level of service throughout \ntheir design life and will result in reduced transport cost to contribute to the national economy.  \nIn recognition of this, the Government plans to launch a road maintenance program involving \nroutine and periodic maintenance for the roads that are in fair to good condition. The program \nwill be carried out in parallel with the road improvement and development during 2006\u20132015. \nThe program envisages a steady increase in the maintainable network as road improvement \ntakes place and a corresponding increase in maintenance funding to cover the entire network by \n2015. While RTSD requests funding for road maintenance to increase from $260 million in 2005 \nto $424 million in 2015 (adjusted with an estimated annual inflation rate of 5%), ADB staff \nestimates an increase in the minimum maintenance funding from $37 million in 2005 to $120 \nmillion in 2015.

A  pavement  management  system  was  developed  with  World  Bank  assistance.  \nThe system provides the necessary steps of the planning cycle and relies on the HDM-4 model \nfor prioritizing the network for utilization of available resources. The World Bank trained RTSD \nstaff on the use of the system. However, RTSD needs support to implement the system by \nconducting annual surveys on road network conditions and developing/implementing annual \nmaintenance plans based on the outcome of the pavement management system.  \n \n19.  The World Bank recommended that the 61 rayon-based road maintenance units be \nconsolidated into 4\u20135 regional road maintenance units based in Ali-Bayramli, Baku, Ganja, \nNagorno Karabakh, and Nakhchivan. Except for Nakhchivan, which will be responsible only for \nroads in the autonomous region, each of the other regional road maintenance units will be \nresponsible  for  about  5,000  km  of  the  road  network.  While  periodic  maintenance  will  be \nundertaken through competitive bidding by private sector contractors, routine maintenance will \nbe initially undertaken by the regional road maintenance units using force account procedures, \nand will be gradually open to private sector contractors.  \n \n20.  To implement the road maintenance program, the Government will implement the new \npavement management system and reorganize the regional maintenance units. Given that \nlimited institutional capacity constitutes a main constraint to implementing these initiatives, the \nADB-assisted East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project will strengthen RTSD\u2019s capacity for \nroad maintenance by helping reorganize regional maintenance units, support their operations, \nimplement the pavement management system through training and provision of equipment, and \nidentify alternative sources of maintenance funding.  \n \nH.  Road Safety \n21.  Road accidents, fatalities, and injuries have increased since 2001. 2,388 road accidents \nin 2004 resulted in 811 fatalities and 2,766 injuries (Table A2.7). The fatality rate in 2004 was \nabout  17  per  10,000  vehicles,  much  higher  than  in  western  European  countries.  Annual \neconomic loss from road accidents was more than $110 million, accounting for 1.7% of GDP. \nThe major causes of road accidents are poor road conditions, lack of safety features and \nfacilities,  weak  enforcement  of  road  safety  regulations, intoxicated  driving,  and  inadequate \ndriver education. \n \nTable A2.7: Road Accidents in Azerbaijan \n \nYear  Road Accidents  Number of Deaths  Number of Injuries \n1994  2,908  1,130  3,301 \n1995  2,556  1,001  2,823 \n1996  2,200  767  2,441 \n1997  2,001  606  2,292 \n1998  1,998  595  2,309 \n1999  1,996  554  2,316 \n2000  1,987  596  2,199 \n2001  1,985  559  2,228 \n2002  2,196  642  2,486 \n2003  2,311  724  2,691 \n2004  2,388  811  2,766 \nSource: Ministry of Internal Affairs.  \n ", "Appendix 2  31\n22.  Five  government  agencies2  are  responsible  for  road  safety;  each  operates  largely \nindependently. Although the National Road Safety Commission coordinates activities of various \ngovernment agencies, it does not have executive or operational powers. \n \n23.  To improve road safety, with World Bank assistance the Government prepared a 5-year \nroad safety program. The key recommendations include (i) replacing the National Road Safety \nCommission with a road safety board that has defined objectives, executive powers for taking \nactions to reduce accidents, adequate funding, and a permanent secretariat; (ii) strengthening \nRTSD\u2019s  capability  to  identify  and  rectify  accident  black  spots  in  the  road  network;  \n(iii) establishing road accident monitoring, reporting, and information systems; (iv) reviewing and \nrevising,  if  necessary,  legislation  and  regulations  on  road  safety;  and  (v)  raising  public \nawareness for road safety. The ADB-assisted East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project will \nhelp the Government implement the road safety program; develop road accident monitoring, \nreporting, and information systems; enhance RTSD\u2019s capacity to identify accident black spots \non the road network; and provide staff training. \n \nI.  Vehicle Axle-Load Control \n24.  Although Azerbaijan has developed regulations to limit vehicle axle load to 13 tons, \nenforcement is weak due to limited institutional capacity and lack of weigh facilities. Vehicle \nweigh stations have not been established along the main roads, and government officials do not \nhave  appropriate  training  and  equipment  for  monitoring  and  enforcement  of  axle-load \nregulations. As a result, vehicle axle overloading is prevalent. Surveys conducted in 1999 on the \neast\u2013west highway showed that 20% of 4-axle trucks, 16% of 5-axle trucks, and 13% of buses \nexceeded the axle-load limit. Heavy vehicle weights are one of the primary causes of rapid \npavements deterioration and damage to bridges. The recently reconstructed Alyat\u2013Haciqabul \nsection of the east\u2013west highway shows serious pavement damage in a number of spots.  \nThe  enforcement  of  vehicle  axle-load  control  is  urgently  needed  to  prevent  premature \ndeterioration of the road network. \n \n25.  In  response,  the  Government  recently  decided  to  enforce  axle-load  regulations  by  \n(i) establishing 12 vehicle weigh stations along main roads, where overloaded vehicles will be \nrequired to redistribute or unload exceeded freight; and (ii) collecting reliable data on vehicle \naxle  loads by  installing  permanent  \u201cweigh-in-motion\u201d  devices at  key  points  along  the  road \nnetwork. This will help quantify the overloading problem and assess the effectiveness of weight \nbridges.  The  ADB-assisted  East\u2013West  Highway  Improvement  Project  will  assist  RTSD  in \nestablishing and operating vehicle weigh stations, assess the axle overloading problem, and \nimprove monitoring of axle overloading. \n \nJ.  Road Transport Services \n26.  The environment for road transport services is competitive in Azerbaijan. The private \nsector plays a key role in provision of road transport services, accounting for more than 95% of \nfreight and passenger transport in 2003. The state-owned road transport operators were largely \nprivatized  and  foreign  road  transport  operators  are  allowed  to  set  up  their  businesses.  \nFreight charges and bus fares for domestic road transport are determined based on market \nconditions,  though  the  Government  sets  tariffs  for  cross-border  and  international  transit \nvehicles. No vehicle licensing has been required since September 2003, but the Government \nplans to introduce it within 2005 to enhance axle-load control and improve road safety. \n                                                 \n2  The Ministry of Internal Affairs (Road Traffic Police Department), Ministry of Transport (Road Transport Service \nDepartment), Ministry of Education (school training program), Ministry of Health (emergency services), and \nPresident\u2019s Office.

", " 40  Appendix 9 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Traffic Forecasts \n1.  Traffic forecasts were made for the project road for 2005\u22122028 based on the traffic \nsurveys  conducted  during  project  preparation,  projected  growth  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP) and population, as well as the estimated income elasticity of demand in Azerbaijan.  \nThe assumptions and resulting projections of traffic growth are summarized in Table A9.1. \nBased on economic and population growth projections, passenger traffic on the project road is \nforecast to grow annually by 7.8% for 2005\u22122009 and 6.8% for 2010\u22122028, while freight traffic \non the project road is expected to increase annually by 7.5% and 6.0% for the respective \nperiods.  These  traffic  forecasts  are  reasonable  compared  with  actual  annual  growth  of \ncombined freight and passenger traffic during 1999\u20132005, which was 9.9% on the Yevlax\u2013\nGanja section and 9.5% on the Qazakh\u2013Georgian border section. \n \nTable A9.1: Assumptions and Projected Traffic Growth for the Project Road \n \nItem  2005\u22122009  2010\u22122028 \nPassenger Transport     \nAnnual Growth of Per Capita Gross Domestic Product (%)  7.1  5.0 \nAnnual Growth of Population in Azerbaijan (%)  0.7  0.5 \nAnnual Growth of Population in the Project Area (%)  1.4  1.1 \nAnnual Growth of Population\u2013Weighted Average  1.1  0.8 \n(50% national and 50% project area) (%) \nIncome Elasticity of Passenger Transport Demand  1.2  1.2 \nAnnual Growth of Passenger Transport (%)  7.8  6.8 \n     \nFreight Transport     \nAnnual Growth of Gross Domestic Product (%)  7.5  6.0 \nIncome Elasticity of Freight Transport Demand  1.0  1.0 \nAnnual Growth of Freight Transport (%)  7.5  6.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance. \n \n2.  The projected traffic was disaggregated into annual average daily traffic for the three \nsections of the project road: (i) Yevlakh\u2013the beginning of Ganja bypass section; (ii) Ganja \nbypass section; and (iii) the Qazakh\u2013Georgian border section (Table A9.2). The annual average \ndaily traffic for 2005\u20132028 is projected to grow from 4,393 to 20,263 vehicles for the Yevlakh\u2013\nbeginning of Ganja bypass section, from 1,311 to 5,942 vehicles for the Ganja bypass section, \nand from 2,538 to 11,710 vehicles for the Qazakh\u2013Georgian border section. While domestic \ntraffic is expected to still constitute the majority of the total traffic during the projection period, \nthe share of regional and international transit traffic is projected to grow from 5% of total traffic in \n2005 to 25% in 2028.  \n \n3.  Improvement of the project road is not expected to attract diverted traffic significantly \ndue to two factors. First, there are no competing alternatives for road transport on the Yevlakh\u2013\nGanja bypass and Qazakh\u2013Georgian border sections. Although the Ganja bypass route is about \n8  km  longer  than  the  route  through  Ganja  city,1  the  travel  time  via  the  former  is  short.2 \nMoreover, the Ganja bypass route is generally used by large trucks for long distance travel, \nwhich are not permitted to travel through Ganja city. Second, there is little competition for traffic \n                                                 \n1 The Ganja bypass section is 36 km, while the route via Ganja city is 28 km. \n2 Travel time via the Ganja bypass section is estimated at 24 minutes, while travel time on the route via Ganja city is \nestimated at 32 minutes. ", "Appendix 9  41\nbetween the project road and the parallel railway line. The majority of freight carried on the \nrailway is crude oil and refined petroleum products from Baku. While this is expected to continue \nin the foreseeable future, crude oil will be partially transported through the recently opened \nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. The existing passenger services on the project road are also \nconsidered to be faster and more convenient than that of railways. \n \nTable A9.2: Annual Average Daily Traffic Projections for the Project Road \n \nYear  Yevlakh\u2013Beginning of  Ganja Bypass Section  Qazakh\u2013Georgian Border \nGanja Bypass Section  Section \n2005  4,393  1,311  2,538 \n2006  4,731  1,412  2,733 \n2007  5,096  1,521  2,944 \n2008  5,488  1,638  3,171 \n2009  5,910  1,764  3,415 \n2010  6,306  1,880  3,644 \n2011  6,729  2,005  3,888 \n2012  7,179  2,137  4,149 \n2013  7,660  2,278  4,427 \n2014  8,174  2,428  4,723 \n2015  8,722  2,589  5,040 \n2016  9,306  2,760  5,377 \n2017  9,930  2,942  5,738 \n2018  10,594  3,136  6,122 \n2019  11,305  3,343  6,532 \n2020  12,062  3,563  6,970 \n2021  12,870  3,799  7,437 \n2022  13,732  4,049  7,935 \n2023  14,652  4,317  8,467 \n2024  15,633  4,601  9,034 \n2025  15,681  4,905  9,640 \n2026  17,799  5,229  10,285 \n2027  18,991  5,574  10,974 \n2028  20,263  5,942  11,710 \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n4.  The economic analysis of the Project covers 2005\u22122028, comprising 4 years of road \nimprovement and 20 years of operation. It was based on a comparison of with- and without-\nproject cases and the weight of project benefits against project costs. It uses 2005 economic \nprices and the border price numeraire. \n \n5.  The project costs comprise capital investment and road maintenance costs, excluding \ntaxes. Capital investment costs are based on the actual prices in the recently awarded civil \nworks contracts for improving other sections with similar conditions of the east\u2013west highway. \nThe project costs were divided into tradable materials and equipment, nontradable materials, \nand labor. They were converted into economic values based on the estimated taxes under the \nrecently awarded similar civil works contracts and using a standard conversion factor of 0.983 \nfor nontradable inputs. The economic costs for road improvement average $487,000 per km, \nwhile road maintenance costs per km after project completion are estimated at $900 for annual \n                                                 \n3  The standard conversion factor of 0.98 is calculated using the approach in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic \nAnalysis of Projects and the 2004 data in Azerbaijan. ", " 42  Appendix 9 \nroutine maintenance and $27,000 for periodic maintenance. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 \nwas used to estimate the economic price of unskilled labor. Skilled labor is not shadow priced \nsince the country has no surplus of skilled labor. \n \n6.  The major project benefits include savings on vehicle operating cost, travel time, and \nmaintenance  costs,  which  were  calculated  using  the  HDM-IV  model.  Savings  on  vehicle \noperating cost and travel time are attributed to the improved smoothness of the road surfaces \nafter project completion. Vehicle operating cost excludes taxes and duties. Savings on vehicle \noperating cost and travel time by type of vehicles are showed in Table A9.3. Savings on vehicle \noperating cost are estimated at $45.1 million (81.1% of the total project benefits) and time travel \nsavings at $10.5 million (18.9% of the total project benefits). The benefits from vehicle operating \ncost savings, which initially accrue to vehicle owners and operators, will be shared gradually \nwith  passengers  and  freight  customers  through  reduced  bus  fares  and  freight  charges.  \nThe Project will contribute to reducing road accidents because of improved road conditions and \ninstallation of traffic safety features, but such benefits are not quantifiable and thus are not \nincluded  in  the  economic  analysis.  The  Project  is  not  designated  to  alleviate  traffic  since \ncongestion is generally not a concern, except for Baku during the rush hours on workdays.  \n \nTable A9.3: Project Benefits by Type of Vehicles \n(at a 12% discount rate, $ million) \n \nType of Benefit  Cars and Light  Buses  Trucks  Total \nVehicles \nVehicle Operating Cost     \n  Without Project  175.5  55.6  74.4  305.5 \n  With Project  151.4  45.0  64.0  260.4 \nVehicle Operating Cost Savings  24.1  10.6  10.4  45.1 \n         \nTravel Time         \n  Without Project  13.6  23.4  3.8  40.8 \n  With Project  10.1  17.4  2.8  30.3 \nTravel Time Savings  3.5  6.0  1.0  10.5 \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance. \n \n7.

The East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project involves improvement of two sections of \nthe east\u2013west highway running from Baku to the Georgian border: (i) the section between \nYevlakh and the western end of the Ganja via the Ganja bypass (89 kilometers [km]), and  \n(ii) the section between Qazakh and the Georgian border (38 km). The Project will also improve \n10 local roads with a total length of about 65 km and cross-border infrastructure/facilities at Red \nBridge. \n \n2.  Road reconstruction works will generally occur within the 60 meter-wide road reserve. \nMinor road alignments may be necessary in a few areas. Improvement of local roads does not \ninvolve any land acquisition or resettlement. A site will be required for the cross-border facility at \nRed Bridge, but this will be state-owned land and will not adversely affected people. According \nto Asian Development Bank (ADB) requirements, a resettlement plan was prepared to address \nanticipated and possible impacts. The plan covers procedures to be adopted for acquiring land \noutside the road reserve and land or property within the road reserve required for civil works. \n \n3.  The current domestic legislation related to the status and control of the road reserve has \nits foundations in the laws of the Soviet era. Prohibition of activities within the road reserve is \noutlined in the 1989 Road Decree. Since independence, the Decree on the Application of the \nRoad Law of 2000 and Decree No. 18 of February 2004 on additional activities aimed at \nregulated usage of the road reserve have provided greater clarity on management of the road \nreserve. The Land Code was revised in 1999. When land is required for projects of national \ninterest, compensation is initially offered on the basis of valuations made in accordance with \nStandard Code 158 (1998). If landowners are unhappy with this valuation, compensation has to \nbe  negotiated.  If  agreement  cannot  be  reached,  the  acquiring  authority  can  process  its \napplication for acquisition through the courts. \n \n4.  Responsibility  for  implementing  most  duties  formally  allocated  to  the  Ministry  of \nTransport is delegated to the Road Transport Service Department (RTSD). Decree No. 18 \n(2004) required RTSD to create the Road Protection Service Unit, which is responsible for \ncontrol of the road reserve and vehicle overloading. The Road Protection Service Unit prepared \nan  inventory  of  200  commercial  and  residential  structures  within  the  road  reserve,  with \ncoordination from local governments. Local governments have general powers for approving \nnew building developments in respect of planning requirements, appearance, architectural style, \nand  construction  standards.  Local  officers  are  required  to  instruct  building  owners  to  stop \nconstruction of illegal buildings in the road reserve and seek permission from the Ministry of \nTransport  and  the  State  Committee  on  Mapping  and  Land  for  approval  of  any  such \ndevelopments. Decree No. 18 (2004) requires local executive powers and municipalities to \nparticipate in the inventories of all structures in the road reserve that identify their legitimacy and \nvalue. \n \n5.  For agricultural land, values are established based on land attributes (productivity of soil \nand regional agricultural characteristics), input costs, and typical revenues achieved in each \ndistrict.  These  cadastral-based  values  are  then  reviewed  in  each  district  by  a  valuation \ncommission  and  periodically  adjusted  upward  to  reflect  changes  in  crop  types,  production \nlevels, and local market prices. The land compensation price must be based on the market \nprice, provided that such price is not less than the cadastral or normative price for the subject \nland. Compensation payable for loss of annual crops is determined by the valuation commission \nfor each district, which uses certified data on the productivity of crops and average price of \nproduce as issued by the district department of statistics. Perennial crops such as fruit trees, ", " 46  Appendix 10 \ngrape vines, and currant bushes are valued on a per tree or per shrub basis by applying a \nstandard formula. \n \n6.  Compensation for housing and other assets such as fences, walls, animal enclosures, \nsmall irrigation channels, drains, wells, hand pumps, artesian bores, water pumps, hay sheds, \nand animal shelters will be valued and compensated on the basis of market value and full \nreplacement cost. Compensation for temporary access roads will be calculated on a similar \nbasis to the land temporarily occupied for the highway construction. Compensation will cover \nthe following losses: (i) annual crop production, (ii) potential crop yield reduction for 3 years,  \n(iii) trees or perennial crops, (iv) use of grazing land, and (v) immovable assets and land \nattachments.  Upon  project  completion,  the  land  used  for  temporary  access  roads  will  be \nreinstated to its pre-project condition and returned to the owners or users. \n \n7.  Land acquisition and resettlement impacts will be upgraded during detailed design. \nMeasures will be taken to minimize impacts and keep construction activities within the road \nreserve. Up to 11 separate areas of land in locations outside the road reserve may need to be \nacquired to realign the road for safety reasons. The civil works contracts will require contractors \nto be responsible for the temporary acquisition and reinstatement of all land required outside the \nroad reserve for construction camps, offices, borrow pits, materials storage sites, materials \nprocessing sites, and haul roads. When detailed design is completed in 2006, RTSD will update \nthe resettlement plan, disclose it to affected people, and submit it to ADB for approval prior to \ncommencement of civil works. The Ecology and Safety Section of RTSD is responsible for \nsupervising resettlement plan implementation. \n \n8.  In 2004, RTSD inventoried more than 300 km of the east\u2013west highway and cleared \nillegal structures located on some sections of the corridor. In the project area, the inventory \nshowed that 200 structures were located within the road reserve, with a roughly estimated asset \nvalue of $1.6 million. Along the Yevlakh\u2013Ganja road section, 61 businesses were removed, \nmostly sales enterprises operating from small iron booths, or abandoned businesses such as \ngarages and fuel stations. In accordance with the 1989 Road Decree, these structures were \nillegal and owners were aware that they would need to remove them at their own expenses \nwithout compensation in accordance with domestic laws. However, local governments and \nRTSD assisted in removing the structures and acquiring legal land plots for the owners to \nconstruct permanent shops. The procedures and the impacts were investigated as part of due \ndiligence; the result shows that the owners were able to invest in better shops and were \nsatisfied with the support and outcome. The businesses that have built new shops are better off \nthan before. \n \n9.  RTSD has adopted a policy for entitlements that accords with domestic legislation and \nseeks to ensure that fair and proper entitlements are provided to all people who might be \naffected by road improvement works according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \nThe resettlement plan is provided in supplementary appendix C. \n \n10.

Not applicable   No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Azerbaijan: \nRoads are one of the major transport modes in Azerbaijan, carrying 78% of passengers in passenger-kilometers and 28% \nof freight in ton-kilometers in 2003. However, many roads are in poor conditions, inhibiting economic growth and regional \ntrade. The State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (2003\u20132005) developed  with Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance and the State Program for Socioeconomic Development of the Regions (2004\u2013\n2008) identify improvement of major road infrastructure as preconditions for regional economic growth and poverty \nreduction. The East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project will include improving two sections of the east\u2013west highway, \nwhich will promote economic growth and poverty reduction in Azerbaijan, and facilitate cooperation between Azerbaijan \nand other countries in the region. Improvement of this road corridor will ultimately restore the \u201csilk road\u201d linking Asia to \nEurope. The Project\u2019s major poverty reduction impacts include (i) reduced prices of transport services, food, and other \ndaily necessities due to lower transport costs; (ii) increased jobs and income for the poor in road reconstruction and \nmaintenance, and roadside commercial activities; and (iii) improved access of the poor to markets and social services. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis       Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe project area consists of six rayons (regions)\u2014Agstafa, Ganja, Goranboy, Khanlar, Qazakh, and Yevlakh\u2014with total \npopulation of about 702,400. Except Ganja (the second largest city in Azerbaijan) and Yevlakh, most of other rayons are \npredominantly rural. Urban residents account for about 61% of the total population in the project area and about 33% of \nthe total, if Ganja is excluded. However, consumption expenditure in the rural area is higher that in the urban area. Rural \nresidents  spend  about  35%  more  than  urban  residents,  especially  on  foods,  housing,  transport,  education,  and \nrecreation. About 37.2% of the total population in the project area was living in poverty in 2003, with a larger income \ndisparity than the national average.a The average salary in the project area for 2003 ranged from AZM128,636 to \nAZM206,689 ($28.1\u2212$45.2), much lower than the national average of AZM383,058 ($83.7). As the project area is \nadjacent to the Armenian-occupied area of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 86,800 (12.4% of the population) in the project area \nare internally displaced people and refugees, most of whom are poor. \n \nThe main causes of poverty are unemployment (officially 3,177 were unemployed in 2003) and lack of energy and water \nresources. However, poor road conditions impose constraints on job opportunities and thus affect the poor. Most villages \nare located half a kilometer or more from the main road corridor. The majority of the rural population, particularly the poor, \nhas to walk to the main road to access social services and buy necessities. The cost of reaching markets outside the \nvillage is high, due to poor road conditions and expensive transport services. Improving infrastructure, including roads, is \none of the key strategic priorities in the State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development for 2003\u22122005. \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction in the project area by improving the east\u2013west highway and selected local \nroads, thereby increasing local communities\u2019 access to markets, job opportunities, and basic social services. The Project \nis expected to create 5,250 person-months of skilled jobs at about $400 per person per month and 3,000 person-months \nof unskilled jobs at about $200 per person per month. The Project will benefit about 261,000 poor. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No \nIntensive consultations were held during project preparation with various stakeholders, including representatives of the \nGovernment, civil society, local communities, the private sector, and external aid agencies. The consultations covered \nmajor project issues such as project alternatives, selection of local roads, potential benefits, and social and environmental \nimpacts. Consultations reveal a high degree of public support for the Project. The design of the Project has incorporated \nthe views of stakeholders. Special attention was given to the needs and constraints faced by women, internally displaced \npeople, refugees, and other vulnerable groups. The consultations also helped identify the role of each stakeholder. For \nexample, the Government will take measures for effective project implementation, with support from nongovernment \norganizations and external aid agencies. The business communities will complement the Project by financing social \nsector projects in the project area. Stakeholder participation and consultation will continue during project implementation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes   No \nAn outline of the target groups and objectives of participation will be developed for the detailed design, construction, and \noperation phases of the Project. This strategy will include the need for ensuring local awareness of project activities from \ndetailed design to implementation, using multiple methods such as public meetings, newspaper advertising, and local \npublic announcement. The strategy will include a consultative phase during detailed design, through which the consultant ", " 50  Appendix 11 \nwill assist in the participatory process, together with local stakeholders, to develop appropriate locations and designs for \npedestrian and livestock crossing points, lighting, speed control, and roadside market areas. This strategy will be \nreviewed with representatives of the target groups and modified, if needed, according to relevant inputs. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAlthough the Azerbaijan Constitution guarantees equal rights for men and women, women\u2019s socioeconomic status has \ndeclined since the breakup of the former Soviet Union, especially in rural areas. The Project is expected to create job \nopportunities for women during project implementation (e.g., construction, catering, cleaning, food services, and office \nwork) and in roadside businesses (e.g., cafes and shops). Contracts for civil works and consulting services will include \nprovisions to encourage employment of both skilled and unskilled women laborers. During detailed design, the consultant \nwill coordinate closely with representatives of vulnerable women\u2019s associations in the project area to identify practical and \neffective modalities to ensure their involvement in, and direct benefit from, increased commercial activities in roadside \nmarkets. During project implementation, civil works contractors will be required to take measures to mitigate the potential \nrisks of HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). These measures will include \nraising public awareness on the risk of sexually transmitted infections (including HIV/AIDS) through leaflet distribution to \nroad construction workers and local communities, and giving workers time to be tested or receive treatment.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes   No, included in the contract documents. \n \nE.

The East\u2013West Highway Improvement Project is classified as Category \u201cB\u201d according to \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  environmental  assessment  requirements.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) for the Project was undertaken. Improvement of the existing  \n2-lane east\u2013west highway does not fall under the type of projects that requires state ecological \nexpertise or environmental impact assessment (EIA) based on the government regulation on \nenvironmental impact of roads (according to Article 50 of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \non  Environment  Protection).  An  EIA  is  required  for  new  construction  of  roads  and  road \nupgrading to category I standard, as described in the same law under Article 54. However, the \nMinistry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) advised ADB that an EIA of the Project \nwould need to be approved by the Government prior to commencing civil works. The Road \nTransport Service Department (RTSD) will prepare the EIA with assistance from the detailed \ndesign consultant. This IEE will serve as a baseline document for MENR approval. 2004 is used \nas the base year for forecasting the environmental impacts of the Project in 2008, 2013, and \n2018. The environmental impact was considered for quarries, borrow sites, material stockpile \nsites, contractors\u2019 yard, asphalt plant (at least 500 meters away from settlements), damage to \nlocal access roads, and aquatic environment within the right-of-way. The study during operation \nhas been limited to the existing right-of-way with the exception of noise, which is considered up \nto 100 meters on both sides of the project road. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The Project will involve improvement of about 127 kilometers (km) of the east\u2013west \nhighway (89 km from Yevlakh to Ganja and 38 km from Qazakh to the Georgian border).  \nThe Project will comprise about 123 km full width road reconstruction and 4 km realignment \nwithin  the  existing  right-of-way.  The  Project  will  also  include  repair  or  replacement  of  \n16 structurally deficient bridges, improvement of drainage structures, construction of new off-\nroad service areas, remodeling of existing junctions and roundabouts, and installation of traffic \nsafety and control devices. To ensure that the completed works do not deteriorate prematurely, \nthe  Project  will  provide  vehicle  weigh  facilities  along  the  highway,  strengthen  RTSD\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity to enforce controls over damage to roads by overloaded trucks, monitor \nenvironmental aspects, and increase the pavement thickness to accommodate heavier axle \nloads. The Project will improve traffic safety by reducing traffic accidents, incorporating traffic \ncontrol facilities in the engineering design, and including traffic safety courses in the drivers\u2019 \nlicensing and school curriculum. Improvement of 10 local roads totaling 65 km will increase \naccess of local communities to the east\u2013west highway. These local roads were selected through \nconsultations with local stakeholders and based on the extremely poor road conditions and \nlower income levels in the connected villages. The Project is expected to be implemented over \nabout 4 years, with estimated completion by November 2009. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n3.  The 53 km section of the project road linking Yevlakh to east Ganja traverses flat and \npartly rolling terrain and is generally poor in structure. The 36 km section of the Ganja bypass \ncrosses more undulating area cut by the Ganja Tschai River valley. The 38 km section from \nQazakh to the Georgian border is characterized by slowly increasing altitude of up to about 500 \nmeters.  The  whole  project  road  crosses  and  passes  a  number  of  rivers,  shallow  valleys, \nirrigation channels, and water ponds. The soil along the corridor is mainly of silt and clay.  \nThe climate of the highway passing through the region is classified as dry with hot summers and ", " 52  Appendix 12 \nmoderately cold winters. Average monthly temperature varies from 23\u221224\u00b0C in summer and \nfrom 4\u22126\u00b0C in winter. \n \n4.  The road passes over several rivers. The Kura river system on the right side of the road \ncorridor  is  organically  and  bacteriologically  polluted  by  the  discharge  of  poorly  treated  or \nuntreated wastewater. The major sources of pollution are mining, metallurgical, and chemical \nindustries;  leather  industry;  and  fertilizer.  Ambient  air  quality  measured  in  the  monitoring \nstations in Mingechevir (about 15 km away from the project road) and Ganja (about 13 km away \nfrom the project road) show that the concentrations of nitrogen oxides, dust, and sulfur dioxide \nexceed the maximum allowable concentrations due to presence of huge industrial sources in \nboth localities. Existing noise levels along the road corridor were estimated using empirical \nrelationships used in other ADB technical assistance projects. The results indicate that noise \nlevels are in compliance with noise standards. \n \n5.  Groups or rows of trees mainly close to villages border the project road. Within the valley \nof the Ganja river, Tschai vegetation is abundant and characterized by dense stands of poplar, \nwillow, oak, and acacia. Cultivated areas planted to wheat, potato, and other crops as well as \nstands of pine, elm, cypress, and mulberry are also along the alignment. In the close vicinity of \nall quarries and borrow pits, vegetation is scarce and restricted to some scattered stands of \ntamarind,  wormwood,  blackberry  bush,  mulberry,  willow,  and  poplar.  No  protected  or \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  such  as  designated  wetlands,  forests,  nature  conservation \nareas, and places of archaeological importance are within or near the project area. \n \nD.  Screening of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n6.  The  environmental  impacts  and  corresponding  mitigation  measures  during  pre-\nconstruction, construction, and operation phases of the Project are summarized in Table A12. \nThe cost for implementing environmental mitigation measures during construction and operation \nis  estimated  at  $362,850.  The  supervision  consultant  in  association  with  the  contractor\u2019s \nenvironmental, health, and safety manager will conduct training on environmental and social \nmanagement  to  ensure  better  understanding  of  road-related  environmental  issues, \nimplementation of mitigation measures, and monitoring and capacity building of the Ecology and \nSafety Unit and the rayon offices of RTSD in the project area. The primary focus of training is to \nenable the staff to carry out environmental monitoring, implement environmental management \nplans, and conduct environmental impact assessment. After training, the participants will be \nable to make brief environmental assessments for their respective roads, conduct monitoring of \nenvironmental plans, and incorporate environmental features into future road designs, and \nbidding and contract documents. \n \nTable A12: Environmental Impacts and Mitigation \n \nPotential Impact  Mitigation Measures \nDesign/Pre-construction Phase \nFlooding due to  \u2022  Bridge design will include preventing flooding due to closing of channels and rivers. \nclosing of channels  \u2022  Design will consider erosion control such as slope and pier protection with gabion and \nand rivers; erosion.  concrete. \nIncreased  \u2022  Speed control signs, proper road markings, streetlights, pedestrian and livestock \naccidents due to  crossing, and other visual means will be included in the engineering design at the \ntraffic volume and  entrance and through the settlements along the road. \nhigher speed \nDisturbance to  \u2022  The Road Transport Service Department (RTSD) has prepared a resettlement plan, \ncommercial  identifying those who are entitled to compensation, the compensation mechanisms, the ", "Appendix 12  53\nPotential Impact  Mitigation Measures \nactivities, and  amount of compensation according to the type of damages and timeframe. In the \ndamage to crops  approaches to villages and settlements, vendors who sell items will be advised in \nand local roads  advance the schedule of construction. Civil works contracts will include requirements to \nrepair damaged local roads to their original conditions after they are used as temporary \nroads. \nLoss of agricultural  \u2022  Design of soil-dumping sites for materials that cannot be reused (location, drainage \nland and impaired  system, covering) will be finalized during detailed design. Agricultural land will not be \nview.  used for disposal areas. \nConstruction Phase \nDust, odor, and  \u2022  A dust control program will be formulated and water will be sprayed in all mixing areas \nexhaust emission  where dry materials are extracted, handled, and/or crushed, as well as on road surfaces \nduring dry conditions. \n\u2022  Vehicles delivering materials to and from the construction sites should be covered to \nreduce spills. \n\u2022  All bitumen preparation and loading sites must be over 500 meters downwind from any \ncommunity development, and the contractor must have spill and fire protection \nequipment available to rapidly deal with any accidents. \n\u2022  Vehicles and machinery used for construction are to be regularly maintained so that air \nquality conforms to national standards. \nNoise emission  \u2022  Noise standards at aggregate crushing plants and bitumen preparation sites will be \nstrictly enforced to prevent exceeding of acceptable noise standards 55 dBA for \nresidential areas in the day time and 45 dBA at night and 75 dBA for commercial and 80 \ndBA for industrial areas. Maintenance of machinery and vehicles should be enhanced to \nminimize noise. \n\u2022  Proper scheduling of construction activities to avoid elevated noise levels at night, \nparticularly in sensitive areas such as settlements and health centers. \nFlooding due to  \u2022  In sections along water bodies, irrigation and drainage systems, earth and stones will be \nalteration of  placed away from the channels so that these will not block rivers and streams, resulting \ndrainage  in adverse impact on water quality and flow regime. \nStagnant water as  \u2022  The contractors will take measures to avoid accumulation of standing water by removing \ninsect-borne  old materials such as used tires and storage drums. Owners of water ponds in the \ndisease vectors  vicinity of the Project should be given information on the dangers of waterborne diseases \nin standing water and how to prevent them. \nSiltation and soil  \u2022  Construction materials containing fine particles (e.g., limestone) should be stored in an \nerosion  enclosure such that sediment-laden water does not drain into nearby watercourses, but \nrather percolates slowly into the soil. \n\u2022  On slopes and other potentially erodible places along the roadside, appropriate \nvegetation that retards erosion should be planted. \nWater pollution and  \u2022  Bitumen will not be allowed to enter running or dry streambeds and nor can be disposed \ncontamination from  of in ditches or waste disposal sites prepared by the contractor. Bitumen storage and \nharmful and toxic  mixing areas must be protected against spills and all contaminated soil must be properly \nchemicals  handled according to the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) or other \nacceptable standards. As a minimum, these areas must be contained so that any spills \ncan be immediately contained and cleaned up. \n\u2022  Vehicle maintenance and refueling should be confined to areas in construction sites \ndesigned to contain spilled lubricants and fuels. Waste petroleum products must be \ncollected, stored and taken to approve disposal sites according to MENR requirements. \n\u2022  Dumping of wastes into water bodies will not be allowed. Toxic and harmful construction \nmaterials will be properly stored and protected from rain. \nSewage generation  \u2022  All work sites will be equipped with latrines to be located at least 300 meters from water \nsources or existing residences. \n\u2022  Drinking water will be monitored to ensure that it meets national potable water standards. \n\u2022  Solid waste and garbage will be collected in bins and disposed of daily, according to a \nwaste management plan prepared by the contractor and approved by the PIU. \nGeneration of  \u2022  Contractors will recycle reclaimed asphalt pavement cold mixes or aggregate in granular \nwastes due to  or stabilized surface material for subgrade and base layers and for village access road \nremoval of old  maintenance. The material that cannot be reused will be taken to specific official waste \nasphalt pavement  dumping sites approved by MENR. \nLoss of topsoil  \u2022  The topsoil (about 15 cm) should be kept and refilled after excavation is over to minimize ", " 54  Appendix 12 \nPotential Impact  Mitigation Measures \nthe impact on productive lands and semi-deserts. As much as possible, temporary roads \nwill be made along existing farm tracks to avoid losses to agricultural lands. \nCompaction of soil  \u2022  Whenever possible, construction vehicles should operate within the corridor of impact, \n(i.e. approximately 9 meters to either side of the road centerline) to avoid damage to soil \nand vegetation. \nLoss of trees and  \u2022  A tree-cutting and replanting scheme will be prepared within the first four months of civil \nvegetation cover  works. Landscaping/greening will be undertaken along the project road. Plantation is \nrecommended for 15\u221220 meters strip for a total of 25 km for road greening and \nlandscape development. Specific location and schedule will be formulated during the \ndetailed design. \n\u2022  Asphalt plants will be located away from densely vegetated areas. \nDamage to habitats  \u2022  Hunting and fishing by construction workers will be strictly prohibited. \nand decrease in  \u2022  Stream crossings that are dry during the work period should be kept unobstructed at all \npopulation of  times and the channels should not be altered. \nwildlife and fish  \u2022  Bridge design will ensure unimpeded flows. \n\u2022  Bridge construction should be scheduled in dry season (late summer to mid winter) to \navoid adverse impact on fishery, birds, and river water quality. \nLoss of access and  \u2022  Temporary bypasses should be constructed and maintained during the construction \ndamage to local  period, particularly at bridge crossings. \nroads  \u2022  A grievance redress committee must be formed in association with affected population \nbefore commencement of civil works and advance notice must be given to the \ncommunity about the construction schedule. \n\u2022  Rehabilitation of damaged local roads to their original condition after project completion. \n\u2022  Livestock crossings will be considered in the design. \nTraffic congestion  \u2022  There will be close coordination among contractors, RTSD, and police to ensure smooth \ntraffic flow. \nRoad accidents  \u2022  Speed of construction vehicles will be controlled through road safety education and fines. \n\u2022  Adequate traffic flow will be allowed around construction areas. Proper signage, barriers \nand flag persons for traffic control will be provided. \n\u2022  Scope and schedule of construction, and certain construction activities causing \ndisruptions or access restrictions will be communicated to the public through community \nconsultation and newspaper announcements. \nDeterioration of  \u2022  Contractors will orient workers on appropriate health and safety procedures including \nworkers\u2019 health due  awareness on sexually transmitted infection such as HIV/AIDS. Group consultations will \nto poor work site  be done to raise awareness among the community about these diseases. \nconditions and  \u2022  Contactors will provide appropriate personnel safety gear and will install proper \nspread of diseases  sanitation and waste disposal facilities at construction sites. Workers will also be \nprovided with adequate health care. Work camps will be located away from sensitive \nlocations such as residential areas. \nGeneration of  \u2022  Construction materials should be reused, recycled, or properly disposed of. All worn out \nconstruction wastes  parts, equipment and empty containers must be removed from the site to proper storage \nlocations designated by RTSD. \nOperational Phase   \nAir pollution due to  \u2022  Based on modeling results, minor impacts are expected since air quality will be generally \nvehicle emission  below ambient air quality standards. After road reconstruction, the amount of dust \nand dust  generated will be less than the current case because of improved road conditions. \nPlanting and maintenance of greenbelts along the project road will mitigate the impact. \nNoise  \u2022  Predicted noise levels indicate an increase in 2008 with the implementation of the \nProject. Roadside planting along affected areas using densely leafed shrubs and trees \nshould provide some attenuation (up to 2\u22124dBA). Should monitoring results show \nelevated noise levels in sensitive areas, mitigation measures such as earth berms, \ndense layered plantation to block the noise, or other measures like wooden noise \nbarriers should be considered. \nRoad accidents  \u2022  Road signs and markings, information display board, and streetlights will be properly \nmaintained. \n\u2022  Road safety training will be included in national drivers\u2019 licensing program; and road \nsafety awareness will be integrated in school curriculum. \nContamination from  \u2022  Within 1 week of the commencement of the Project, contingency plans for clean-up of ", "Appendix 12  55\nPotential Impact  Mitigation Measures \nspills due to traffic  spills or oil, fuel, and toxic chemicals, based on a spill contingency plan will prepared by \nmovement and  the consultant for the Government. \naccidents \nFlooding   \u2022  The drainage system will be periodically cleared to ensure unimpeded storm-water flow. \nSource: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance. \n \nE.  Environmental Monitoring and Institutional Requirement \n7.  An  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  was  prepared  to  mitigate  the \npotential environmental impacts of the Project. During construction, environmental monitoring \nwill ensure the protection of embankments from potential soil erosion, borrow pits restoration, \nquarry  activities,  location  of  work  sites  and  material  storages,  location  of  asphalt  plants, \npreservation  of  religiously  sensitive  locations,  community  relations,  and  safety  provisions. \nDuring operation, air, noise, and surface water quality monitoring and greening and landscaping \nof project roads will be important parameters of the monitoring program. In cooperation with the \nproject implementation unit and the Ecology and Safety Unit, the supervision consultant during \nproject implementation will be required to (i) develop an environmental auditing protocol for the \nconstruction  period  and  formulate  a  detailed  monitoring  and  management  plan;  and  \n(ii) supervise the civil works for road improvement and submit quarterly reports based on the \nmonitoring data and laboratory analysis report. The cost for environmental monitoring during \nconstruction and operation is estimated at $636,000. \n \n8.  The agencies involved in executing and monitoring the environmental aspects of the \nProject  include  the  Ecology  and  Safety  Unit  of  RTSD  responsible  for  managing  the \nenvironmental impacts, greening, and landscaping of national roads; RTSD\u2019s district offices; and \nMENR.  The  design  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  incorporating  the  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan into engineering design and the supervision consultant will \nundertake  environmental  monitoring  during  construction.  The  supervision  consultant  will \nsupervise  monitoring  of  mitigation  measures  during  construction.  The  contractors  will  be \nresponsible  for  subcontracting  data  collection  of  environmental  monitoring  to  a  recognized \norganization. Each contractor will be required to nominate an environmental, health, and safety \nspecialist  responsible  for  meeting  the  contractors\u2019  environmental,  health,  and  social \nresponsibilities. \n \nF.  Stakeholder Consultation and Information Disclosure \n9.  The  IEE  process  included  stakeholder  participation  and  consultation  to  help  RTSD \nachieve public acceptance of the Project. In October 2004 and February 2005, stakeholder \nconsultations were conducted in Baku, Borsunlu, Delimemmedly, Ganja, Goranboy, Qazakh, \nand Yevlakh), which involved a wide range of participants (over 150 people) representing the \nGovernment; nongovernment organizations; scientific, education, and health institutions; civil \nsociety; businesses; and media. The consultation process was documented according to ADB\u2019s \nand  the  Government\u2019s  requirements  and  the  recommendations  were  incorporated  in  the \npreliminary design of the Project. The results of the consultations were positive, with people \nconsidering  that  the  Project  will  bring  significant  economic  benefits  to  the  region  and  will \nincrease trade flows. Major concerns were related to damage of local roads during construction, \nenforcement of speed limits, intersection improvement, street lighting, proper traffic signs and \npedestrian crossings, involvement of local people during construction, and quick implementation \nof the Project.  \n ", " 56  Appendix 12 \nG.  Conclusion \n10.  The IEE reveals that no major negative environmental impacts are likely to occur during \nproject implementation and operation after project completion. Recommendations are included \nin an environmental monitoring and management plan to mitigate expected negative impacts \nidentified in the IEE and adequate funds will be provided for this purpose. \n \n11.  The Project will have overall beneficial impacts through better accessibility for cross-\nborder traffic connecting to the Georgian border, increased trade flows in the region, reduced \ntravel time, reduced dust, and improved road safety. Rehabilitation of local roads will also \nenhance  access  of  poor  villages  to  markets,  schools,  health  care  facilities,  and  job \nopportunities.
