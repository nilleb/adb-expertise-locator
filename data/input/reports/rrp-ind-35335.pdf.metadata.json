For  each  subsequent \nsubproject, an IEE will be prepared as one of subproject approval \nrequirements. \n \nSince  2000,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported \nthe  National  Highways  Development  Program  (NHDP),  phase  I \nand phase II, which aims to upgrade about 13,300 kilometers (km) \nof  key  arterial  network  by  the  end  of  2007.  A  program  of  this \nmagnitude  requires  broad-based  policy  actions,  from  building \nincreasing  private  sector \nproject \nparticipation  (PSP),  to  improving  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M).  ADB  has  supported \nthese  policy  actions  using  a \nprogrammatic approach through a multiyear lending program. The \nProject will be the fifth in the series of interventions, supporting the \nlast stage of the institutional strengthening program and financing \nthe upgrading of the north-south corridor. A road safety zone will \nbe implemented, and awareness on the risks of HIV/AIDS (human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome) \nand human trafficking will also be provided. \n \nAlthough  road  density  in  India  is  higher  than  that  in  many \ndeveloping countries, road network standards and conditions are \ninadequate  to  meet  rapidly  growing  freight  and  passenger  traffic. \nOnly  6%  of  national  highways  (NHs)  have  four  or  more  lanes, \nabout  25%  of  NHs  have  poor  surface  conditions,  and  many are \nseriously congested. This situation raises road-user costs; impairs \nroad  safety  and  the  quality  and  frequency  of  transport  services; \nand  limits  roads\u2019  contribution  to  national  development,  economic \ngrowth, and poverty reduction.  \n \nFaced with the NH  system\u2019s  capacity  shortage,  the  Government \nhas  initiated  several  radical  actions,  including  (i)  launching  the \nambitious NHDP, (ii) establishing the National Highways Authority \nof  India  (NHAI),  (iii)  creating  a  central  road  fund,  and  (iv) \npromoting PSP. \n \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nObjective  \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe improved network will encourage economic activity and ease \nthe  mobility  of  people  who  seek  jobs,  but  may  also  potentially \nincrease social risks. Road accidents have continued to increase, \non  average  by  5%  a  year  over  the  past  two  decades.  About  one \nthird  of  fatalities  occur  on  NHs.  Increased  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS \nis  also  a  risk,  as  is  trafficking  of  vulnerable  rural  people  for \nexploitative  labor,  because  the  improved  network  may  facilitate \ntraffickers\u2019 operations across the country. \n \nThe  challenges  facing  NHAI  require  multidimensional  skills. \nManaging about 6,000 km of completed NHs, completing the east-\nwest and north-south corridors by 2007, and upgrading additional \n10,000  km  of  NHDP-III  roads  need  to  be  done  simultaneously \nusing a well-structured mechanism. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  improve  transport  efficiency \nleading  to  expanded  economic  opportunities.    This  objective  will \nbe  achieved  through  (i)  strengthening  NHAI  capacity  for  NH \ndevelopment and O&M; (ii) upgrading and increasing the capacity \nof 566 km of key national arterial corridors, particularly the north-\nsouth  corridor;  (iii)  improving  road  safety;  and  (iv)  preventing \nspread of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \nThe  estimated  total  cost  is  $670.6  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of \ntaxes,  duties,  interest  during  implementation,  and  commitment \ncharges. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $418.6 million, \nand local currency costs at $252.0 million equivalent. \n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development \n\nBank \n\nGovernment \nTotal \n\n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange \n379.1 \n \n39.5 \n418.6 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n20.9 \n \n231.1 \n252.0 \n\nTotal \nCost \n400.0 \n \n270.6 \n670.6 \n\n% \n\n59.6 \n \n40.4 \n100.0   \n\n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $400  million  from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \nfacility,  a \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \ncommitment charge of 0.75%  per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \n \nThe  Government  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  promptly \nto  NHAI.  The  Government  follows  a  current  loan-grant  ratio  of \n20:80. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on the \nloan. \n \nUntil 31 December 2008 \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nlending \n\n\fEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation \nArrangements  \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\niii\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 June 2008 \n\nresponsible \n\n \nNHAI \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  through  the  north-south corridor \nproject  management  unit, \nfor  overall  project \ncoordination.  For  the  institutional-strengthening  component,  the \ngeneral  manager  (administration)  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-\nday implementation. For civil works implementation, three project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established  in  Lalitpur, \nNarsinghpur,  and  Anantpur.  The  road  safety  component  will  be \nimplemented by the corridor management unit. The HIV/AIDS and \nanti-trafficking  component  will  be \nimplemented  by  NHAI\u2019s \nenvironment and social development unit in coordination with the \nNational AIDS Control Organization. \n \nProcurement  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s \ntender  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. The civil works contracts \nwill  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB). \nSupply  contracts  of  over  $500,000  will  be  procured  under  ICB; \n$100,000\u2013500,000,  international  shopping;  and  under  $100,000, \ndirect purchase arrangements. \n \nAll  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \ninstitutional \nConsulting  services  will  be \nstrengthening,  (ii)  construction  supervision,  (iii)  road  safety  zone \nimplementation,  and \ntrafficking \n(iv)  HIV/AIDS  and  human \nawareness \nraising.  Overall,  about  293  person-months\u2019 \ninternational  and  4,625  person-months\u2019  domestic  consultant \ninputs will be required.  \n \nThe  Project  will  support  NHAI  in  its  institutional  strengthening \nefforts  so  that  it  performs  its  mandate  efficiently,  contributing  to \noverall  transport  efficiency.  This  will  improve  the  returns  and \nsustainability of NH investments, and encourage a wide range of \neconomic activities that make use of NH transport services.  \n \nThe  north-south  corridor  intersects  the  golden  quadrilateral  and \neast-west  corridor.  Long-distance  traffic  is  thus  expected  to \nchange  drastically  as  road  users  find  shorter  routes.  Delays  and \nhold-ups at railway crossings and major road intersections will be \nobviated.  Slow  traffic,  congestion,  and  accidents  will  be  reduced \nconsiderably.  The  road  safety  zone  will  provide  a  model  for \nreducing accidents. Overall, the Project will improve the corridor\u2019s \ntransport  efficiency,  speed  up  traffic,  improve  travel  conditions, \nand reduce journey time and vehicle operating costs. \n \n\nrequired \n\nfor \n\n(i) \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Project will spread the benefits of economic development by \ncatalyzing  forward-backward  linkages,  uplifting  the  people  in  the \nproject  area,  most  of  whom  are  poor.  The  immediate  project \nbenefits  for  them  are  skilled  and  unskilled  jobs  during  project \nconstruction.  In  the  long  run,  the  Project  will  bring  the  people \nsocioeconomic benefits and opportunities. \n \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  at  14.9  %. \nThe poverty impact ratio is more than 1, indicating that the Project \nis  pro-poor,  since  total  net  economic  benefits  reaching  the  poor \nwill exceed the total net economic project benefits.  \n \nThe  risk  is  that  NHAI  institutional  strengthening  efforts  may  take \nlonger than expected. This risk has been addressed in the project \ndesign  by  providing  technical  support  to  achieving  NHAI\u2019s \nmedium-term \nobjectives.  The \ninstitutional-strengthening component will help NHAI implement its \nprogram and strengthen NHAI\u2019s program management capability. \n \nThe  risk  of  delayed  implementation  has  been  lessened  by \nadvance action, early establishment of PIUs, and strengthening of \nNHAI\u2019s project management. \n \nThe  risks  associated  with  the  improved  highway  network  have \nbeen eased by auditing road safety, providing a road safety zone, \nand raising awareness of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \n \n \n\nstrengthening \n\ninstitutional \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto India for the National Highway Sector II Project. The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nRoad density is now 1 km/km2\n\n2. \nIndia's  economic  reforms  have  resulted  in  a  real  gross  domestic  product  growth  of \naround  6%  in  the  1990s,  with  an  average  growth  rate  of  about  8%  in  the  decade\u2019s  latter  half. \nAlthough  the  growth  rate  was  much  less  during  the  last  2  years,  demand  for  transport  is \nexpected to grow at about 10% per year. The transport sector is multimodal, and road transport \nis  dominant,  accounting  for  60%  of  freight  movement  and  80%  of  passenger traffic.  The road \nnetwork  totals  some  3.4  million  kilometers  (km),  of  which  65,569  km  are  national  highways \n(NHs).1 The network has grown 8.5 times, from 400,000 km in 1951. The NH network makes up \nabout 1.9% of the country\u2019s road network but carries about 40.0% of total traffic. Over the last \ndecade, the number of automobiles has been growing by 9.0%, and of heavy vehicles by 7.6%. \nIn 2002, India had 59 million vehicles.  \n \n, higher than that in many developing countries. However, \n3. \nthe  standards  and  condition  of  the  road  network  are  inadequate  to  meet  rapidly  growing \ndemand for freight and passenger traffic.  In early 2004, about 31% of the NH network was still \nsingle-lane standard, 63% two-lane, and only 6% four-lane or more. More than 25% of NHs are \nin  poor  surface  condition,  and  many  are  seriously  congested.  Internationally,  a  goods  vehicle \ntravels on average 600 km a day, while in India until recently, only about 250 km a day. Poor \nroad conditions raise road-user costs, impair road safety, and diminish the quality and frequency \nof  transport  services.  Such  conditions  also  limit  roads\u2019  contribution  to  national  development, \neconomic growth, and poverty reduction. The detailed sector overview is in Appendix 2. \n \n4. \nRoad  freight  service  provision  is  a  private  sector  activity.  Entry  into  the  market  is  not \nrestricted. While the Motor Vehicle Act allows state governments to set freight rates, they rarely \ndo so. Thus, in practice, freight rates are not regulated, resulting in intense competition among \ntruckers.  Reductions  in  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs)  from  improved  road  conditions  are \ngenerally passed on to the buyers of freight services. \n \nRoad  passenger  transport  services  are  provided  by  the  public  and private sectors, but \n5. \nthe public sector share has declined to about 20%. State governments control market entry and \nregulate  passenger  fares,  which  are  kept  low  by  political  pressure.  Regional  transport \nauthorities  regulate  safety  and  environmental  aspects  and  are  responsible  for  vehicle \nregistration  and  driver  licensing.  Due  to  these  regulatory  policies,  competition  is  limited. \nAlthough  the  economy  as  a  whole  would  gain  from  VOC  reduction,  since fares are regulated \nand  most  publicly  owned  operators  are  not  covering  their  costs,  only  part  of  this  reduction  is \npassed on to passengers.  \n\n6. \nRoad  accidents  have  continued  to  increase,  on  average  by  5%  a  year  over  the  past  2 \ndecades. In 2003, fatalities numbered about 96,000, and injuries, 400,000. The  fatality rate per \n10,000 vehicles has remained around 20 for the past few years, compared with less than 10 in \n\n                                                 \n1   The NH network totaled 58,112 km until February 2004, when 7,457 km were added. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\nsome  industrialized  Asian  countries.  The  rate  per  million  population  has  continued  to  increase \nfrom 27 in 1971 to 95 in 2003. About one third of fatalities occur on NHs. \n \n7. \nAlthough  the  improved  network  will  promote  economic  activity  and  provide  job \nopportunities,  it  may  also  increase  social  risks,  including  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS.2  HIV/AIDS \ninfection is typically concentrated among poor and marginalized groups, including sex workers, \ndrug users, migrant laborers, and truck drivers. The widespread perception is that these groups, \nparticularly truckers, have been seen to contribute to the rapidly spreading HIV/AIDS epidemic. \nThe  improved  network  may  also  increase  human  trafficking  for  exploitative  labor  by  easing \ntraffickers\u2019 operations across the country. \n  \nB. \n \n8. \nFaced  with  the  highway  system\u2019s  capacity  shortage,  the  Government  has  initiated \nseveral  actions,  including  (i)  launching  ambitious  NH  programs;  (ii)  establishing  the  National \nHighways Authority of India (NHAI); (iii) creating a central road fund; and (iv) promoting private \nsector participation (PSP) in financing, upgrading, operating, and maintaining NHs. \n \n9. \nNational  Highways  Development  Program.  In  1998,  the  Government  launched  the \nNational  Highways  Development  Program  (NHDP)  to  rehabilitate  and  widen  the  golden \nquadrilateral  (about  6,000  km),  connecting  the  major  cities  of  Delhi,  Mumbai,  Kolkata,  and \nChennai. This program has been substantially completed. The second phase of NHDP (NHDP-\nII) consisting of upgrading the north-south corridor (about 4,000 km) and the east-west corridor \n(about 3,300 km) is currently under implementation and expected to be completed by December \n2007. The third phase of NHDP (NHDP-III) is currently under consideration by the Government, \ncovering  about  10,000  km,  and  consisting  of  (i)  corridors  of  high-density  traffic;  (ii)  corridors \nlinking  state  capitals  to  the  NHDP  network;  and  (iii)  roads  providing  access  to  tourist  and \neconomic centers.3 \n \n10. \nSeparation between Policy and Implementation Functions. The Ministry of Shipping, \nRoad  Transport  and  Highways  (MSRTH)  is  responsible  for  developing  and  maintaining  NHs; \nformulating road transport policies; coordinating state roads; and issuing guidelines on highway \nplanning, design, and construction. In 1988, to separate MSRTH\u2019s planning and implementation \nfunctions, NHAI was established as a statutory body.  Initially,  it was given the responsibility for \nbuilding and maintaining the NH network and expressways under externally aided projects and \nPSP. In 1998, NHAI became responsible for implementing the NHDP.  \n \n11. \nRoad  Financing.  To  develop  the  road  network,  a  dedicated  central  road  fund  was \nestablished, mainly supported by an additional excise duty (\u201ccess\u201d) on petrol and diesel, which \ninitially was Rs1.0 per liter, and increased to Rs1.5 in 2003. About one third of the funds are for \nNHs  and  have  been  committed  until  2018  to  implement  the  NHDP-I,  NHDP-II, and service its \ndebt.  To  complete  the  NHDP-I  and  NHDP-II,  NHAI  estimated  that  a  total  of  $33.8  billion  over \nFY1999-2019  is  required:  $15.1  billion  for  capital  financing  and  $18.7  billion  for  debt  service. \nNHAI  is  expected  to  raise  $17.7  billion  from  cess,  $10.7  from  market  borrowings,  $3.6  billion \nfrom external assistance, and $1.8 billion from private sector financing. The proposed NHDP-III \nis intended to be implemented under PSP schemes to the largest extent possible. \n \n\n                                                 \n2   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n3   The  Government  also  launched  an  ambitious  rural  road  improvement  program  to  connect all villages with more \n\nthan 500 people. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nPrivate Sector Participation. PSP success requires a conducive policy and institutional \n12. \nframework. In 1997 MSRTH issued  Guidelines for the Private Sector Participation in the Road \nInfrastructure, and took a series of policy actions, including (i) exempting build-operate-transfer \n(BOT)  investors  from  taxation;  (ii)  indicating  Government  commitment  in  all  preparatory \nactivities,  including  land  acquisition  and  removal  of  utilities;  (iii)  enabling  the  Government  to \nprovide grants of up to 40% of project cost; (iv) allowing foreign direct investments up to 100% \nequity  participation;  (v)  allowing  duty-free  import  of  modern  high-performance  construction \nequipment; and (vi) amending the NH Act to authorize private sector investors to operate a part \nof the NH system and collect tolls under Government regulation. NHAI was also empowered to \nform  joint  ventures  with  private  sector  investors,  form  special-purpose vehicles (SPVs), invest \nand  lend  the  funds  for  such  ventures,  and  raise  funds  by  issuing  debentures  in  the  capital \nmarkets. \n \nC. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nKey Challenges \n\n1. \n \n13. \nProject  Implementation  Capacity.  About  3,970  km  of  NHDP  network  have  been \ncompleted, 400 km will be completed by December 2004, and about 2,600 km will be completed \nby  December  2006.  More  than  6,000  km  of  NHDP-II  have  yet  to  be  awarded.  The  average \ncontract implementation period is 2.5\u20133.0 years. To complete the NHDP-II by the end of 2007 \nas planned, all remaining works have to be awarded by the first semester of 2005. So far, NHAI \nhas issued about 35 contracts for a total of 1,400 km per year on average. To meet the target \ncompletion date, NHAI needs to improve its capacity to prepare and contract out projects. While \nkeeping  the  organization  lean  is  important,  the  magnitude  of  the  remaining  tasks  will  require \nNHAI to revisit its human resources capacity. Managing a large number of consultants engaged \nfor  project  preparation  is  difficult,  sometimes  leading  to  poor-quality  outputs  due  to  lack  of \nsupervision  and  quality  control.  NHAI  has  thus  established  a  technical  review  function \nmechanism,  by  involving  experts  from  outside  NHAI,  for  quality  control.  The  technical  review \nteam\u2019s  role  is  to  review  all  feasibility  reports  and  detailed  project  designs  prepared by NHAI \nconsultants. The final approval is provided by a technical audit team, consisting of chief general \nmanagers; and technical, finance, and environment and social general managers (GMs).   \n \n14. \nNHAI  outsources  construction  supervision  to  private  consulting  firms.  Management \noversight  is  provided  through  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  run  by  NHAI  senior  staff. \nEngineers\u2019 high level of authority, together with the internal audit system, ensures efficient and \nobjective decision-making. Although this has enabled NHAI to improve project implementation, \nas of March 2004, of 78 projects under implementation, 31 were reportedly 2\u201312 months late.  \n \n15. \nNHAI  also  recognizes  that,  while  it  needs  to  strengthen  its  contract  management  and \nsupervision  capacity,  it  also  needs  to  improve  highway  standards  and  the  code  of  practice. \nPlanning,  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  roads  are  generally  based  on  standards  and \ncodes  of  practice  prepared  and  published  by  the  Indian  Roads  Congress.  For  specific \napplication to NH works, MSRTH and/or NHAI also issue instructions and guidelines from time \nto time. However, some of the standards require updating and rationalization to be compatible \nwith the ground situation and international practice. While the regulatory function remains with \nMSRTH, with its experience in developing over 6,000 km of highways, NHAI can better provide \ninput to improve highway standards and the code of practice.  \n \n16. \nGood project preparation and implementation management are also critical for NHAI to \nimplement the proposed NHDP-III. Since it will be implemented under a PSP scheme wherever \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nlean,  outsourcing  of  project  preparation  and \npossible,  and  as  NHAI  should  remain \nimplementation  should  be  explored.  Under  the  ongoing  technical  assistance  (TA),4  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  is  helping  NHAI  prepare  a  mechanism  to  implement  the  proposed \nNHDP-III.  \n \n17. \nOperation and Maintenance. As more highways are completed, effective operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  are  critical.  Newly  upgraded  highways  need  to  be  maintained,  tolls \ncollected efficiently, rights of way kept clear, and road accidents minimized.5 Outsourcing to the \nprivate sector is the best way to ensure effective and efficient O&M.  \n \n18. \nIn  August  2002,  NHAI  awarded  two  long-term  (8-year)  O&M  contracts,  for  NH8  (Delhi-\nJaipur)  and  NH2  (Delhi-Agra).  A  corridor  management  concept  prepared  with  World  Bank \nassistance  is  being  implemented  on  a  pilot  basis  for  NH1  for  about  270  km.  Under  the  ADB \nongoing  project,6 an O&M contract is being developed and will be awarded when upgrading of \nthe  Surat-Manor  section  is  completed  by  June  2005.  The  model  contract  will  be  applied  as \nappropriate on all other ADB-assisted project roads. \n  \n19. \nIn December 2000, the cabinet decided that all four-lane highways under NHAI would be \ntolled, and that NHAI would utilize the toll revenues for O&M and debt service. The initial tariff \nlevels  are  set  (in  1997  prices)  at  Rs0.4,  Rs0.7,  and  Rs1.4  per  km  for  passenger  cars, \nminibuses, and buses or trucks, respectively.7 The toll policy allows annual escalation based on \nwholesale  price  index.  The  current  toll  rates  are  Rs0.535,  Rs0.937,  and  Rs1.874  per  km \n($0.012\u2013$0.042  per  km)  for  passenger  cars,  light  commercial  vehicles,  and  buses  or trucks, \nrespectively.  To  cover  O&M  and  debt  service,  NHAI  must  collect  toll  revenues  through  an \nefficient toll system. Assisted by ADB, a toll system study is ongoing and will be completed by \nJune 2005. \n \n20. \nThe  road  safety  audit  study  is  being  done  under  the  ADB-assisted Western Transport \nCorridor Project. The \u201croad safety zone\u201d concept, which includes overloaded-vehicle control, is \nbeing  developed  under  the  ADB-assisted  National  Highway  Sector  Project  I.8  This  concept \nneeds to be replicated in other NH sections. \n \nAs  several  component  schemes  of  corridor  management  are  being  implemented  on  a \n21. \npilot basis, NHAI should eventually comprehensively evaluate the implementation of long-term \nO&M  contracts,  tolling  system,  and  road  safety  zone  concept.  An  integrated  corridor \nmanagement  program  then  needs  to  be  developed,  incorporating  lessons  from  each  pilot \nscheme. \n \n22. \nis  heavily \ndependent  on  market  borrowings,  i.e.,  at  more  than  30%  of  total  funding  requirements \n(Appendix 3).

Manila \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\nbillion  will  need  to  be  raised  and  bonds  to  be  issued  for  debt  service.  The  market  has  been \nreceptive  to  NHAI  offerings  on  the  strength  of  future  assured  inflow  of  cess  from  the \nGovernment.  However,  given  the  size  of  market  borrowing,  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the \nnational bond and debt market should be assessed. Over the long term, toll revenue will be a \nmajor  source  of  NHAI\u2019s  revenue  to  cover  corridor  management  expenditures  and  other \noperating  expenses.  As  projected  toll  revenue  must  be  collected  effectively,  NHAI  should \ndevelop  and  adopt  an  efficient  tolling  system  as  soon  as  possible.  To  ensure  its  financial \nsustainability, NHAI should also be able to retain toll collection revenue and spend it on O&M. A \nmemorandum of understanding between MSRTH and NHAI to give NHAI the right to retain and \nuse the tolls has been drafted and is under scrutiny of the Ministry of Law. \n \n23. \nThe  proposed  NHDP-III's  financing  plan  may  be  plausible  if  innovative  modalities  for \nPSP  are  devised  to  attract  more  private  sector  investment.  The  ongoing  TA  (footnote  5) \nincludes  exploration  of  possible  financing  modalities  for  the  NHDP-III.  The  hybrid  annuity-toll-\nbased  model  developed  during  processing  of  the  proposed  Project  could  be  used  as  an \nalternative model. \n \n24. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  Totaling  about  $480  million,  8  contracts  have  been \nawarded  as  annuity  concessions,  7  as  toll-based  BOT  concessions,  and  10  to  SPVs.  These \ncover about 1,312 km of the network, which is about 10% of the NHDP-I and NHDP-II or 16% of \nthe contracted network. Annuity and toll-based BOT concessions have offered efficiency gains. \nA  review  of  PSP  in  the  NH  development  mandated  to  NHAI  (Supplementary  Appendix  A) \nillustrates that the schemes successfully transferred the initial financing, construction, and O&M \nrisks to the private sector, thus freeing up resources for social purposes. These efficiency gains \nneed  to  be  considered  in  the  strategic  context  of  estimating  the  cost  of  public  sector  vis -\u00e0-vis \nprivate sector procurement. \n \n25. \nThe  existence  of  large  and  certain  traffic  volumes  is  a  precondition  for  toll-based BOT \nconcessions,  which  was  present  in  the  golden  quadrilateral  corridor.  However,  most  of  the \nremaining highways along the north-south and east-west corridors lack such traffic, so creating \nfinancially viable toll-based BOT concessions is difficult. Although annuity concessions are more \nsuitable,  one  of  the  main  arguments  used  against  the  annuity  scheme  is  that  traffic  risk  is  not \ntransferred  to  the  private  sector.  This  problem  could  be  solved  by  introducing  an  innovative \ndeclining  annuity  combined  with  tolling  concession  model  (see  para.  23).  NHAI  is  taking \nnecessary  actions  to  obtain  the  Government\u2019s  approval  in  adopting  this  new  model,  and  will \nexplore  possibilities  to  pilot  this  model  for  the  high-density  traffic  corridor  under  NHDP-III.  If \nsuccessful, this model may be expanded to the remaining network. In addition, since NHDP-III \nwill be implemented through PPP as much as possible, ADB is providing assistance to explore \nmore alternatives to attract private sector financing (footnote 5). \n \n26. \n(ESDU) will establish a cell exclusively to implement and monitor HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-\ntrafficking  interventions.  A  collaborative  model  between  NHAI  and  the  National  AIDS  Control \nOrganization  has  been  developed,  involving  contribution  of  technical  expertise  by  state  AIDS \ncontrol societies. Assisted by the  World  Bank,  a  consultant  has  been  appointed  to  develop  a \nframework  for  the  cell,  including  staffing  and  budgetary  requirements.  Further  consulting \nassistance will be required to help this cell develop a comprehensive strategy and program to \nprevent and control HIV/AIDS and human trafficking along NHs mandated to NHAI. \n \n \n \n\nHIV/AIDS  and  Human  Trafficking.  The  environment  and  social  development  unit  \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional and Organizational Aspects \n\n \n \n27. \nThe  issues  and  challenges  outlined above raise the question whether NHAI's structure \nand  organization  and  its  internal  processes  are  appropriate  to  meet  its  challenges.  These \naspects  were  reviewed  in  the  World  Bank-assisted  Institutional  Strengthening  Study.  It \nconcludes  that  the  current  arrangement  is  appropriate  but  could  be  made  more  efficient.  The \nstudy\u2019s  recommendations  for  institutional  strengthening  are  summarized  in  a  draft  corporate \nplan for NHAI to be finalized and accepted by the Government. The study and plan are being \nfinalized  to  reflect  comments  and  new  developments  such  as  NHAI\u2019s  new  mandate  over  the \nNHDP-III.  The  corporate  plan\u2019s  measures  should  be  specific  and  time-bound,  and  provide  a \nvehicle to detail and monitor the agreed-on measures to strengthen NHAI.  \n \nThe  study  reviewed  the  legal  status  of  NHAI  and  concluded  that  it,  with  Government \n28. \noversight, has a number of benefits: (i) ability to raise funds from the capital market; (ii) ability to \nfacilitate  corridor  management  for  aspects  that  require  close  coordination with the central and \nstate governments; (iii) flexibility to adopt commercial accounting principles and follow generally \naccepted accounting standards; (iv) ability to promote joint ventures.  \n \n29. \nAlthough  NHAI  has  brought  private  sector  efficiency  to  NH  management,  profit \nmaximization and financial self-sufficiency are not the objectives. NHAI\u2019s mandate will continue \nto  broaden  due  to  several  factors,  including  the  following:  (i)  the  NH  network  remains  grossly \ninadequate  in  many  respects  despite  recent  significant  advances;  (ii)  NH  development  is  on \nexisting  alignments,  with  a  large  proportion  of  traffic  being  local;  (iii)  no  alternative  roads  are \navailable  for  interregional  traffic;  and  (iv)  the  roads  are  considered  a  public  good.  Owing to \nthese  factors,  and  the  fact  that  road  users  already  contribute  significantly  to  road  sector \nrevenues through various user charges other than toll, the scope for mobilizing more resources \nfrom road users, e.g., by increasing toll rates, is limited. NH development will remain dependent \non Government contribution and, therefore, in the medium term, NHAI should remain a statutory \nbody. \n \n30. \nThe  key  challenge  is  to  enhance  NHAI\u2019s  efficiency.  Achievements  should  be \nconsolidated and some key areas should be strengthened. The focus should be to strengthen \n(i) the  external  (authorizing)  environment,  where  policy  parameters  shape  the  conditions  and \nmandates under which NHAI operates; and (ii) NHAI\u2019s organizational structure and processes. \nThe  status,  achievements  of,  and  targets  for  NHAI  strengthening  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. Based on these, NHAI and ADB agreed to work toward achieving the objectives of \nthe medium-term institutional-strengthening framework (Appendix 4) as summarized below. \n \n31.  With  regard  to  the  external  environment,  some  key  short-  and  medium-term priorities \ninclude (i) developing MSRTH\u2019s policy and regulatory function, (ii) incorporating technically and \nformalizing \nfinancially \narrangements  for  NHAI  to  retain  toll  revenues,  (iv)  improving  the  PSP  framework  and \ndeveloping  modalities  suited  to  the  nature  of  the  NH  system  and  its  traffic,  (v)  expanding  and \nimproving  the  input  from  nongovernment  stakeholders  in  oversight  arrangements,  and  (vi) \nmaking NHAI\u2019s human resource policies more flexible. \n \n32.  With regard to NHAI\u2019s internal organization and processes, some key priorities include (i) \nimplementing  an  organizational  structure  based  on  the  two  core  businesses  of  project \nmanagement  and  corridor  management;  (ii)  streamlining  the  project  management  function  by \ncodifying  and  updating  standards  and  guidelines;  (iii)  initiating  pilot  schemes  for  corridor \nmanagement;  (iv)  increasing  the  proportion  of  permanent  staff  for  continuity  in  personnel  for \n\nin  an  agreed-on  corporate  plan,  (iii) \n\nfeasible  program \n\ntargets \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\ncore  functions;  (v)  establishing  management  of  information  technology  and  system  strategies \nand plans; and (vi) strengthening financial management, programming, and budgeting.  \n \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\n3. \n \n33. \nADB,  World  Bank,  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  are  the  main \nexternal  agencies  supporting  NHAI.  ADB  has  provided  four  loans  of  $1.14  billion  total;  World \nBank,  three  loans  of  $1.22  billion  total;  and  JBIC,  one  loan  of  about  $300  million  equivalent. \nNHAI has also attracted private sector financing of about $1.8 billion (Appendix 5).  \n \n34. \nADB and World Bank have been working closely and agreed on a coordinated strategy \nin  assisting  NHAI  and  ensure  that  the  synergy  of  interventions  will  optimize  development \nimpacts.  While  the  World  Bank  is  helping  NHAI  conduct  the  institutional-strengthening study, \npilot  the  corridor  management  concept,  and  prepare  the  road  information  system,  ADB  is \nhelping  conduct  the  tolling  system  study,  develop  an  O&M  contract,  pilot  a  road  safety  zone, \nand strengthen NHAI\u2019s corporate financing capability. \n \n\nLessons Learned \n\n4. \n \n35. \nTo  avoid  unnecessary  delays  in  project  implementation,  several  actions  have  been \napplied, including (i) advance action for procurement of the civil works contracts and recruitment \nof  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  early  establishment  of  PIUs;  (iii)  advance  land  acquisition, \nresettlement, shifting of utilities, and clearance of rights of way; (iv) strict prequalification criteria; \nand  (v)  adoption  of  the  role  of  \u201cengineer\u201d  in  accordance  with  international  best  practice \n(following the Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs-Conseils). Despite the progress achieved, \nthe  last  two  projects  were  delayed  by  prolonged  procurement.  ADB  started  project processing \nbased  on  a  feasibility  study,  but  the  detailed  design  and  bid  documents  were  not  ready  by \nproject  approval.  For  the  proposed  Project,  NHAI  has  arranged  that  the  feasibility  study \nconsultants  also  prepare  the  detailed  design  and  bidding  documents, and ensured that these \ndocuments will be ready by February 2005. Furthermore, ADB has approved a TA to prepare at \nleast two projects for the next 3 years.9 This will help project preparation in advance, and give \nNHAI time to prepare detailed design and bid documents early. \n \n36. \nSome NHAI institutional and policy studies, including on toll strategy and O&M contract \ndevelopment, were delayed. With the completion of about 6,000 km of the NHDP, these studies \nand  other  institutional  strengthening  need  to  be  done  soon  if  NHAI  is  to  meet  its  new \nchallenges. The proposed Project will provide a consultant to facilitate and coordinate all policy-\nrelated activities. As suggested by the project performance audit report of Loan 918-IND,10 the \nProject  will  help  NHAI  evaluate  and  integrate  O&M,  tolling,  and  road  safety  into  a  integrated \ncorridor management concept. \n\n \n5. \n\nADB Sector Strategy\u2014Programmatic Approach \n\n \n37. \nSince  2001,  a  programmatic  approach  has  been  used  to  support  NHAI  capacity \nstrengthening  efforts  in  a  progressive  and  evolutionary  manner.  The  medium-term objectives \nare  to  (i)  strengthen  project  development  and  implementation  capability;  (ii)  promote  PSP  in \nhighway development, tolling, and O&M; (iii) strengthen fund mobilization; (iv) strengthen O&M; \nand  (v)  restructure  NHAI  to  make  it  more  efficient.  The  achievement  of  this  programmatic \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the High Priority National Highways Project. Manila.  \n10  ADB. 2002. Project Performance Audit Report on the Road Improvement Project in India. Manila. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nits \n\napproach  is  assessed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C,  and  concluded  in  the  following \nparagraphs. \n \n38. \nThe  programmatic  approach  is  highly  relevant  to  the  Government\u2019s  priority  to \nexpeditiously  complete  a  modern,  safe  NH  network.  To  perform  its  role,  NHAI  must  have \nsufficient  implementation  capability,  secure  financing,  private  sector  participation,  O&M \ncapability,  and  effective  organization.  This  approach is consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy \nprogram as well as the Government\u2019s transport policy. \n \n39. \nNHAI  is  financially  and  managerially  capable  of  implementing  NHDP  and  of  attracting \nPSP. NHAI has begun to award O&M and corridor management contracts to the private sector, \nand  to  finalize  its  own  corporate  plan  and  institutional  restructuring.  Thus,  the  programmatic \nimmediate  objectives  and  purposes.  However,  NHAI\u2019s \napproach  has  achieved \nimplementation  capability  needs  to  be  strengthened,  particularly since the agency is now also \nresponsible for the NHDP-III, and the NHDP-II is yet to be completed. Corridor management is \nmoving in the right direction but it is still new and, therefore, needs to be continuously overseen \nand  strengthened.  Nevertheless,  the  institutional  restructuring  plan  is  technically  sound  and, \nonce  finalized  and  implemented,  will  enable  NHAI  to  perform  all  its  responsibilities,  including \ncompletion of the NHDP and operation and maintenance of the completed network.  \n \nThe  programmatic  approach  is  a  timely  and  sound  initiative  and  provides  a  clear \n40. \nframework  for  ADB's  and  others'  financial  support,  and  for  Government  and  NHAI  institutional \nstrengthening  and  policy  reform.  The  need  for  regular  reviews  and  possibly  for  midcourse \ncorrections  was  recognized  when  the  approach  was  formulated.  Specific  goals  under  the \ndifferent  policy  areas  and  trigger  points  were  adjusted  during  the  last  three  projects,  providing \nwelcome  flexibility.  However,  the  evolution  of  goals  and  targets  was  not  recorded  in  formal \nunderstandings  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  likely  contributed  to  the  Government \nand  NHAI  giving  more  attention  to  implementing  the  physical  investment  program  at  the \nexpense of institutional and policy reform. To improve the programmatic approach, milestones \nwith an implementation time frame have been agreed on under the Project. The approach has \nto be reviewed regularly, and a completion review is recommended for 2008. \n\n \nNHAI\u2019s exposure, skills, and knowledge in implementing a huge program within a limited \n41. \nperiod;  accessing  market  borrowing;  attracting  and  engaging  the  private  sector;  operating  and \nmaintaining the network; and in sustaining the private sector\u2019s efficiency, result-oriented culture, \nand quick decision making, need to be maintained. The impact of the programmatic approach is \nsustainable  but  not  as  much  as  it  should  be  due  to  frequent  staff  changes.  Therefore,  quality \nstaff should be retained and permanent core staff should be increased. \n \n42. \nThe  challenges  facing  NHAI  require  multidimensional  skills.  Managing  the  completed \nnetwork, completing the NHDP-II in 3.5 years, and implementing the NHDP-III necessitate well-\ndesigned structures and mechanisms. The objectives in the programmatic approach will remain \nrelevant, and ADB will continue to help NHAI pursue them.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n43. \nThe  Project  is  the  fifth  in  the  series  of  interventions,  supporting  the  last  stage  of  the \nNHAI  institutional  strengthening  program  and  financing  the  upgrading  of  the  north-south \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\ncorridor.  The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  transport  efficiency,  contributing  to \nexpansion  of  economic  opportunities.  This  objective  will  be  achieved  through  (i)  strengthening \nNHAI  to  perform  its  core  role  of  development,  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  NH  network \nunder its responsibility; (ii) upgrading and increasing capacity of 566 km of key national arterial \ncorridors,  along  the  north-south  corridor;  and  (iii)  improving  road  safety. 11  The  Project  is  in \naccordance  with  the  strategy  outlined  in  the  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2005-\n2007),  and  also  supports  the  Government's  transport  strategy.  In  NH  subsector,  ADB's \nstrategies  are  to  further  strengthen  project  development  and  implementation  capability  and \nenhance PSP.12 The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional-Strengthening Component \n\n \n44. \nAs  detailed  in  Appendix  6,  the  Project  will  help  NHAI  to  achieve  its  institutional-\nstrengthening objectives (Appendix 4) and ensure that all NHAI\u2019s institutional and policy-related \nactivities,  conducted  with  or  without  external  assistance,  are  consistent  with  the  institutional \nstrengthening  program  to  improve  NHAI\u2019s  efficiency.  The  Project  will  also  include  (i) \nstrengthening  project  management;  and  (ii)  updating  standards  and  the  code  of  practice for \nplanning, design, construction, and maintenance of highways.  \n \n45. \nThe component  will  help  NHAI  facilitate  review  of  project  management  in  the  golden \nquadrilateral  (NHDP-I),  and  draw  lessons  from  the  evaluation,  assess  the  current  and  future \nwork  load,  and  estimate  the  staff  resources  and  skills  mix  required  by  NHAI  to  fulfill  its \nexpanding mandate. As contract management is a core NHAI function, procedures and forms to \nprocure different services, e.g., civil works contracts, feasibility study contracts, detailed design \ncontracts, PPP agreements, O&M concessions, etc., should be reviewed and updated.  \n \nThe  component  will  facilitate  streamlining  of  project preparation and implementation by \n46. \ncodifying  and  updating  existing,  and  developing  new,  guidelines  and  standards  for  highway \nplanning, design, construction, and maintenance. These improved standards and guidelines will \nfacilitate integration of new officers into the PIU teams and provide the basis for effective quality \ncontrol.  \n \n2. \n \nThis  component  will  widen  and  upgrade  566  km  of  subprojects  along  the  north-south \n47. \ncorridor  as  listed  in  Appendix  14,  unless  otherwise mutually agreed between the Government \nand  ADB.  The  project  roads  will  be  widened  to  24  meters,  and  the  pavement  will  be \nstrengthened. Bridges, drainage structures, and culverts will also be improved and replaced as \nnecessary.  The  road  network  will  be  able  to  meet  traffic  demand  for  up  to  20  years.  The \nhighway design features are in Appendix 7. \n \n48. \nThe  component  covers  313  km  of  NH26  (Lalitpur-Lakhnadon)  and  253  km  of  NH7 \n(between  Kurnool  and  Andhra  Pradesh-Karnataka  border),  unless  otherwise  mutually agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB. The roads are part of the NHDP network and determined \n                                                 \n11 The Project has been prepared through Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the National Highway Sector II \n\nHighway Development Component \n\nProject (ADB. 2003. Manila). \n\n12  During  processing  of  the  Project  a  PPP  scheme  has  been  explored,  however,  there  was  no  section  under  the \nProject highways found feasible for attracting the private sector financing. NHAI is exploring possibilities to adopt \nthe proposed hybrid BOT-annuity model for the NHDP-III. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nbased on economic viability and environmental and social concerns. The subprojects are being \nprepared  following  the  requirements  and  procedures  set  forth  in  Appendix  8.  Once  these \nsections are completed, their O&M will be contracted out to the private sector. \n \n\nRoad Safety Component \n\n3. \n \n49. \nThis  component  (Appendix  9)  will  adopt  the  implementation  arrangements  of  the  road \nsafety zone concept, being developed under Loan 2029 (footnote 9).  A section of about 200 km \nalong the north-south corridor will be selected by NHAI and ADB during implementation taking \ninto  consideration  lessons  learnt  from  implementation  of  the  zone  under  Loan  2029.  The \nfindings and recommendations of the ongoing road safety audit study will also be incorporated \ninto  the  component  design.  The  selected  zone  will  be  equipped  with  (i)  an  advanced  traffic \nmanagement system to centrally monitor roads, (ii) weigh-in-motion or static weighing platforms \nto  control  overloading,  (iii)  speed-monitoring  equipment,  and  (iv)  ambulances  and  other  relief \nequipment.  \n \n\nHIV/AIDS and Human-Trafficking Awareness Component \n\n4. \n \n50. \nThis component will develop and implement a program to raise awareness of the risk of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking along project highways (Appendix 10). The component will  (i) \nraise  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  among  construction  workers  and  high-risk  groups,  and \ndisseminate information on early treatment; and (ii) raise awareness of human trafficking among \nvulnerable groups. The HIV/AIDS subcomponent will require close collaboration between NHAI \nand  the  National  AIDS  Control  Organization  (NACO).  The  anti-trafficking  subcomponent  will \ndraw  on  knowledge  and  expertise  from  state  departments  of  social  welfare  and  women  and \nchildren development.  \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n51. \nAs  shown  in  Table  1,  the  estimated  total  cost  is  $670.6  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of \ntaxes, duties, commitment charges, and interest during implementation. Foreign exchange costs \nare  estimated  at  $418.6  million  (62.4%).  Local  currency  costs  are  estimated  at  $252.0  million \nequivalent (37.6%).

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB. \n \nADB's  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  all  consulting  services,  and  a  portion of \n53. \npublic investment civil works and equipment. The Government will finance the foreign exchange \ncost  of  $39.5  million  to  cover  commitment  and  interest  charges.  The  Government  will  also \nfinance  local  currency  costs  of  $231.1  million  equivalent  to  cover  taxes  and  duties;  land \nacquisition,  resettlement,  and  environmental  works;  a  portion  of  public  investment  civil  works \nand  equipment  expenditures;  and \nfor  project  management.  The \nGovernment  will  promptly  make  loan  proceeds  available  to  NHAI.  The  Government  uses  a \ncurrent loan-grant ratio of 20:80. The Government will bear the loan\u2019s foreign exchange risk and \nany shortfall in finances during project implementation. \n\nin-kind  contributions \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign Exchange \n379.1 \n39.5 \n418.6 \n\nLocal Currency \n20.9 \n231.1 \n252.0 \n\nTotal \n400.0 \n270.6 \n670.6 \n\n% \n59.6 \n40.4 \n100.0 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTotal \nSource: Staff estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n54. \nThe Executing Agency of the Project will be NHAI through the already established north-\nsouth  corridor  project  management  unit,  headed  by  chief  GMs  of  the  north-south  corridor, \nassisted by GMs and deputy GMs.  \n \n55. \nFor  the  institutional-strengthening  component,  the  GM  for  administration  will  be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  implementation.  To  further  update  highway  standards  and  codes  of \npractices,  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  MSRTH's  Department  of  Road  Transport  and \nHighways,  with  members  from  NHAI,  Department  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways,  and \nspecialists in road transport and highways will plan, program, review, and direct, the consultant's \nworks.  The  steering  committee  will  be  established  not  later  than  3  months  from  loan \neffectiveness.  The  consultant\u2019s  recommendations  will  be  presented  to  the  steering committee \nfor approval by December 2005. Physical testing and piloting might be necessary. MSRTH will \nprocess the documents for publication by June 2008.  \n \nImplementation arrangements for the highway development component are in Appendix \n56. \n12. Three PIUs will be established under the project management unit, in Lalitpur, Narsinghpur, \nand Anantpur. Each will be responsible for implementing about 150-250 km of roads. The PIU-\n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nNarsinghpur, in the middle of the project corridor, will implement three civil works contracts, and \ncoordinate overall project implementation. This PIU will be headed by a project director, at the \nGM/deputy  GM  level,  assisted  by  a  deputy  GM/manager  for  overall  management  and  a \nmanager  for  resettlement  and  environmental  issues.  For  each  contract,  a  manager  will  be \nassigned.  \n \n57. \nThe PIU-Lalitpur will be responsible for  four civil works contracts, and the PIU-Anantpur, \nfor  all  civil  works  contracts  along  NH7.  Each  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  director  (at \nGM/deputy  GM  level),  assisted  by  a  deputy  GM/manager  for  resettlement  and  environmental \nissues, and a manager for each contract package. \n \n58. \nThe  road  safety  component  will  be  implemented  by  the  existing  corridor  management \nunit. A steering committee, established under the Loan 2029 (footnote 9), headed by the chief \nGM  for  corridor  management  and  consisting  of  representatives  of  NHAI,  MSRTH,  and  other \ncentral and state agencies, will oversee the implementation of this component. \n \nFor the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking component, the GM for estate management will be \n59. \nresponsible  for  overall  implementation  through  NHAI\u2019s  ESDU,  within  which  an  HIV/AIDS-\nprevention  cell  is  being  established  to  develop,  implement,  and  monitor  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-\ntrafficking interventions. The three PIUs will coordinate and monitor program execution, assisted \nby  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  in  close  coordination  with  NACO  and  the  state  aids \ncontrol  societies,  Department  of  Women  and  Child  Development,  and  other  government \nagencies responsible for women and children empowerment.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n60. \nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years. NHAI ensures that most preconstruction \nactivities will be completed by March 2005. The Project, including the road safety component, is \nscheduled for completion in June 2008 (Appendix 13).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nProcurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement \n61. \nand NHAI/Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to ADB. Civil works procurement will be \ncarried  out  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  among  prequalified \nbidders. The indicative contract packages are in Appendix 14. Supply contracts over $500,000 \nwill be procured under ICB; $100,000\u2013500,000, international shopping; and less than $100,000, \ndirect purchase arrangement. \n \n62. \nTo ensure project implementation readiness, as requested by the Government, ADB has \napproved  advance  procurement  action.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of \nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. A  detailed schedule for civil works \nprocurement  has  been  prepared,  and  NHAI  agreed \nthe  schedule \n(Supplementary Appendix E). Considering that the civil works are standard, and the works have \nbeen packaged to enable bidders to prepare their proposals quickly, the period for submission \nof prequalification applications is 45 days, and the bidding period, 60 days. \n \n\nto  strictly \n\nfollow \n\n \n4. \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n63. \nAll  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nconsultants.  To  ensure  project  implementation  readiness,  NHAI  has  started  selection  of \nconstruction  supervision  consultants.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  advance  action \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \nFor  the  institutional-strengthening  component,  a  team  of  consultants  with  expertise  in \n64. \ninstitutional  development,  human  resources  management,  highway  planning,  and  engineering, \nwill be recruited using the simplified technical proposal requirement. The proposal period will be \n45  days,  and  the  evaluation  will  be  done  under  the  quality-  and  cost-based selection (QCBS) \nmethod.  A  team  of  international  (24  person-months)  and  domestic  consultants  (50  person-\nmonths) will implement this component.  \n \n65. \nFor  the  highway  development  component,  four  consulting  teams  will  be  required  for \nconstruction supervision, each handling about three civil works contracts. Each team will have a \nteam  leader;  resident  engineers;  pavement,  materials,  and  bridge  engineers;  road  safety, \nenvironmental,  and  resettlement  specialists;  and  others  (Appendix  15).  For  each  team,  an \ninternational  firm  associated  with  one  or  more  domestic  firms  will  be  recruited  using  the  full \ntechnical proposal requirement. The evaluation will be done under the  QCBS method. The four \npackages will have a total of about 288 person-months\u2019 international and 4,487 person-months\u2019 \ndomestic  inputs.  Considering  that  the  supervision  works  are  straight  forward,  the  proposal \nperiod will be 45 days. \n \n66. \nThe  road  safety  component  will  require  about  24  person-months\u2019 domestic consulting \ninputs  from  three  road  safety  individual  specialists  with  expertise  in enforcement, engineering, \nand evaluation. During the first 6 months, they will (i) assess road safety along the road safety \nzone;  (ii)  establish  a  road  safety  indicator  baseline;  (iii)  recommend  an  implementation \nmechanism and road safety solutions in road safety zone; (iv) propose road safety equipment, \nand  help  NHAI  procure  and  install  the  equipment;  (v)  develop  and  train  implementing  and \nenforcement staff; and (vi) conduct monitoring and evaluation. \n \n67. \nFor  the  HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  component,  three  domestic  individual  consultants \nwill help the HIV/AIDS cell design and implement a program to address HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking along the Project highways.  Three NGOs, one for each PIU, will also be recruited to \nimplement the plan, in liaison with relevant agencies and departments as necessary. The NGOs \nwill also monitor the socioeconomic indicators along the project roads as indicated in the project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n68. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(January 2001) and Disbursement Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-based Loan \nProducts (July 2002), as amended from time to time. An imprest account will be established at \nthe  Reserve  Bank  of  India,  with  an  initial  advance  equivalent  to  the  estimated  eligible  project \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The imprest \naccount  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB. \nStatement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  will  be  used  to  replenish  the  imprest  account  for \nany individual payment under $300,000. \n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nNHAI's  accounting  system  was  established \n\n69. \nin  accordance  with  Government \nrequirements, and its financial statements are prepared in a format prescribed by the Controller \nand  Auditor  General  of  India,  which  audits  NHAI's  financial  statements  annually.  As  a  public \nsector  authority,  the  system  generally  adheres  to  basic  commercial  accounting  practices \ncommonly  employed  in  India.  Accrual  accounting  is  used,  transactions  are  recorded  on  a \nhistorical-cost bas is, and annual balance sheet and profit-and-loss statements are prepared. \n \n70. \nNHAI  and  its  PIUs  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts.  These  and  NHAI  financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by  an \nindependent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  While  the  unaudited  reports and financial statements \nwill be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, the audited \nreports and financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end \nof each fiscal year. The imprest account and SOE will be audited as part of the regular annual \naudit.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  of  the  examination  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  should  be \nseparately  set  out  in  the  auditor\u2019s  report.  NHAI  was  made  aware  of  ADB's  policy  on  delayed \nsubmission and also of the importance of satisfactory and acceptable quality of audited reports. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n71. \nPerformance  indicators  to  be  monitored  under  the  Project are (i) highway capacity, (ii) \nroad  roughness,  (iii)  travel  time,  (iv)  fatality  rate,  (v)  freight  rates,  (vi)  passenger  fares,  (vii) \norigins  and  destinations,  (viii)  freight  types  and  volumes,  (ix)  air  quality,  and  (x)  local  social \neconomies. The baseline values of NH26 and the outline method of data collection, compilation, \nand  analysis  of  these  indicators  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  same  baseline \nindicators for NH7 will be collected as part of the subproject proposal exercise. These indicators \nwill be monitored annually. NHAI, will set up a project performance management system within \n3  months  of  loan  effectiveness  and  with  assistance  of  project  construction  supervision \nconsultants  monitor  and  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  benefits,  progress,  annually  during  Project \nimplementation and within three months of Project completion.   \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n72. \nA project inception mission will be fielded soon after the project loan effectiveness date, \nand  regular  reviews  will  follow  annually.  In  2006,  the  Project  will  require  a  detailed  midterm \nreview  by  the  Government  and  ADB  to  consider  the  Project\u2019s  progress  and  agree  upon  any \nchanges to scope or implementation to achieve the project objectives.  \n \n73. \nNHAI will monitor project preparation and implementation in accordance with the project \nprocessing and implementation schedule and time-bound milestones, and keep ADB informed \nof any significant deviations resulting in the milestones not being met. Assisted by consultants, \nNHAI will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports that include physical and financial progress, \nstatus of land acquisition, resettlement, environmental management, training, public campaigns, \nand  other  activities  critical  to  project  implementation  but  not  within  the  direct  scope  of \nengineering services. The report format will be developed during the inception mission. Within 3 \nmonths  of  physical  completion,  NHAI  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  in  a  format \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nTechnical Aspects \n\nPolicy and Institutional Aspects \n\nA. \n \nThe  north-south  corridor  intersects  the  golden  quadrilateral  and  the  east-west corridor. \n74. \nLong distance traffic patterns will change due to shortened travel routes. The risk of increased \nroad accidents due to faster traffic will be mitigated through road safety audits during design and \nconstruction. The project highways will be upgraded from single- and double-lane roads to four-\nlane  divided  carriageways.  The  Project  will  provide  for  partial  access  control,  segregation  of \nslow traffic from fast, and traffic guidance and safety measures. Delays and hold-ups at railway \ncrossings  and  major  road  intersections  will  be  obviated.  Friction  due  to  slow  traffic,  and \nconsequent congestion and accidents, will be reduced considerably. The road safety zone will \nprovide a model for comprehensively reducing road accidents. Overall, the Project will improve \ntransport  efficiency,  speed  up  traffic,  improve  travel  conditions,  and  reduce  journey  time  and \nVOCs.  The  risk  of  delayed  implementation  has  been  mitigated  by  adopting  advance  action, \nestablishing PIUs early, and strengthening NHAI\u2019s project management functions.  \n \nB. \n \n75. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  NHAI's  institutional  strengthening  and  contribute  to  overall \ntransport  efficiency,  thus  improving  the  returns  and  sustainability  of  investments  in  NHs  and \nencouraging a wide range of other economic activities that make use of them. Overall, these will \nprovide efficient transport and contribute to economic growth.  \n \nThe adoption of the programmatic approach was a timely and sound initiative. Funding \n76. \nneeds  to  be  predictable,  and  the  approach  provides  a  clear  framework  for  ADB  and  other \nfinancial support, and for institutional and policy reform by the Government and NHAI.   \n \nNHAI\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  program  might  not  be  completed  on  time,  thereby \n77. \nleading  to  inadequate  improvement  in  NHAI  performance.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  in  the \nproject  design  by  agreement  with  ADB  on  objectives  to  be  achieved  under  the  medium-term \ninstitutional-strengthening  program.  The  institutional-strengthening  component  will  help  NHAI \nimplement the program and strengthen its project management capability. \n \nC. \n \nThe economic and financial analyses were carried out for the sample roads, consisting \n78. \nof  313  km  on  NH26  (Lalitpur-Lakhnadon)  (Appendix  16),  based  on  the assumptions listed in \nSupplementary  Appendix  G.  The  improved  roads  will  ease  and  speed  up  traffic  flow,  and \nshorten travel time, resulting in lower VOCs.  \n \n79. \nThe  economic analysis considers the estimated costs and benefits during construction \nand  over  20  years  of  operation.  The  estimated  costs  consist  of  investment  and  incremental \noperating  costs.  The  estimated benefits are savings in VOCs and passenger and cargo travel \ntime. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated at 14.9%. A sensitivity and risk \nanalysis  shows  that  the  Project  remains  economically  viable  as  the  EIRR  is  above  the \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%, except for the cases of 20% reduction in benefits and of 20% \nincrease in the Project\u2019s capital cost. The probability of the EIRR falling below 12% is 4.7%.  \n \n80. \nThe  sample  road  was  also  evaluated  to  assess  the  projected  toll  revenues  against \ncapital costs to improve and widen the road, and recurring costs for road operation and routine \n\nEconomic and Financial Aspects \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nSocial Aspects \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nand  periodic  maintenance  over  20  years.  The  financial  rate  of  return  is  calculated  at  3.3%, \nbelow the Project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital in real terms at 4.6%. This implies that this \nsection is not commercially viable and that PSP will be possible only when financial support for \ninvestment is in the form of upfront lump-sum investment or annuity payment during the Project. \nToll revenues will, however, be able to cover recurring costs for road operation, including routine \nand  periodic  maintenance  upon  completion,  which  demonstrates  that  the  project  roads  are \nfinancially sustainable with no further injection of national resources.  \n \nD. \n \n81. \nThe  Project  is  classified  under  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines  (2003).    Sagar-Rajmarg Chouraha section (98 km) has been selected \nas  a  sample  project  road  as  it  has  a  complex  mountain  forest  section  absent  in  other  road \nsections. An initial environmental examination (IEE) for this section and a sector environmental \nassessment were carried out. The summary IEE, including the environmental management plan \n(EMP)  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  The  reports  confirmed  that  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  are  expected  and  that  an  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not \nrequired.  Construction  impacts  will  be  mitigated  in  line  with  the  EMP.  Realignment,  including \nbypasses,  will  prevent  impacts  on  cities,  settlements,  and  forests.  NHAI  will  ensure  that \nmitigation  measures  are  implemented  during  construction  and  operation.  For  each  subproject, \nan  IEE  and  EMP  will  be  prepared  following  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework provided in Supplementary Appendix I. ADB will be given access to all environmental \nassessment documents.  \n \nE. \n \n82. \nA  social  impact  assessment  has  been  carried  out  along  NH26,  which  is  in  Madhya \nPradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  These  states  are  among  the  poorest  in  the  country,  with  poverty \nlevels at 37.06% and 31.22%, respectively, significantly higher than India\u2019s average of 27.09%. \nThe annual per capita income of those living below poverty line in these states is estimated at \nRs3,889.32 (less than $90). The Project will help spread the benefits of economic development \nby catalyzing forward-backward linkages, and will uplift the poor. The immediate project benefits \nfor the poor are skilled and unskilled jobs during project construction. In the long run, the Project \nwill augment the socioeconomic benefits and opportunities available to the poor. The summary \npoverty reduction strategy is in Appendix 17. \n \nLower transport costs will raise profit margins for poor farmers; encourage  them to shift \n83. \nfrom  subsistence  to  commercial  agriculture;  and  lower  the  costs  and  increase  access  to \nschools, medical clinics, employment centers, and other social centers. \n \nA  distribution  analysis  estimated  the  poverty  impact  ratio  by  determining how much of \n84. \nthe  benefits  of  the  improved  highways  are  passed  on  to  the  poor, based on the results of the \nfieldwork  and  economic  analysis,  use  of  the  road  by  the  poor  and  very  poor  via  motorized \ntransit,  and  estimated  degree  of  competition  in  the  motorized passenger and freight transport \nmarkets. Approximately 50% of all bus passengers on the project roads are poor. The estimated \ndirect benefit is Rs15,655 million in present value terms. The net benefit to the economy as a \nwhole is Rs2,779 million. The poverty impact ratio is more than 1, indicating that the Project is \npro-poor since the total net economic benefits reaching the poor will exceed the Project\u2019s total \nnet economic benefits.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\nThe  project  design  avoids  residential  areas  as  much  as  possible,  mainly  by  using \n85. \nbypasses, especially where religious places may have to be moved, and schools, clinics, and \nother  common  property  facilities  are  close  to  the  new  alignments.  Impacts  due  to  diversions \nduring  construction  must  also  be  identified  and  mitigation  measures  proposed.  In accordance \nwith  ADB's  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice,  a  resettlement  plan  of \nLalitpur-Sagar (104 km) was prepared as a sample plan (Appendix 18) including the entitlement \nmatrix  (Supplementary  Appendix J).  At  this  stage,  an  indigenous  people  development  plan  is \nnot warranted. For each subsequent subproject, a resettlement plan will be prepared in line with \nindigenous  people \nframework  (Supplementary  Appendix  K),  and  an \nthe  resettlement \ndevelopment  plan  will  be  prepared  as  necessary  in  accordance  with  the  indigenous  people \ndevelopment framework provided in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n \nThe risks associated with the improved highway network, such as increased incidence of \n86. \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking, are to be mitigated by raising awareness among high-risk and \nother vulnerable groups. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n87. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  NHAI  have  given  the \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Policy \n\n(i) \n\nNHAI  will  undertake  institutional  strengthening  consistent  with  the \nobjectives as set out in Appendix 4. \n\n(ii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  cause  the \nsteering  committee  to  be  established,  for  purposes  of  supporting  the \nprocess  of  updating  the  highway  standards  and  code  of  practice  to  be \npublished by June 2008, which will be adopted by NHAI. \n\nBy  December  2005,  NHAI  will  review  the  report  on  tolling  system  study \nprepared  under  the  Surat-Manor  Tollway  Project  (Loan  1747-IND)  and \nprovide its proposal for adoption of the same, to ADB. \n\n The Government and NHAI will ensure that, not later than 30 June 2005, \nNHAI will be able to retain tolls collected, as its own revenue. \n\n \n2. \n\nHighway Development  \n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  the  subprojects  follow  the  requirements  and \napproval procedures as set out in Appendix 8. \n\nThe Government  will  ensure  timely  and  adequate  counterpart  funds  for \nthe Project.  \n\n(iii)  Within 2 months of loan effectiveness, and in any case before the award \nof civil works contracts under a subproject, whichever is earlier, NHAI will \nensure that the PIUs are adequately staffed.  \n\n(iv) \n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  upon  completion  of  each  subproject,  its  O&M \ncontract  will  be  awarded  to  the  private  sector.

Road  transport  is  dominant, \n1. \naccounting for 60% of freight movement and 80% of passenger traffic; rail accounts for much of \nthe rest. The 10th Development Plan sets forth the following  for the transport sector: (i) capacity \nexpansion  to  meet  the  increases  in  demand;  (ii)  reduction  of  disparities  between  and  within \nstates,  including  integration  of  the  northeastern  states  into  the  economic  mainstream;  (iii) \ntechnology  upgrading  and  modernization; (iv) improved maintenance of assets; (v) increased \nprivate  sector  participation;  (vi)  bringing  competition \ninfrastructure  development, \nmaintenance,  and  service  provision  to  increase  efficiency;  (vii)  emphasizing  safety,  energy \nefficiency, environmental conservation, and mitigation of social impacts; and (viii) improving the \nintermodal mix, in accordance with the comparative advantage of each mode. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  responsibility  for  developing  and  maintaining  the  national  highway  (NH)  system \nrests  with  the  central  Government's  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport  and  Highways \n(MSRTH),  while  state  and  district  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  the  state  and  local \ngovernments. Works on NHs were executed by the central Government and state public works \ndepartments under an agency system. To streamline and accelerate improvement works on the \nNHs,  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  was  created  in  1988  and  made \noperational  in  1995.  It  is  responsible  for  major  upgrading  of  the  NH  network,  through  the \nNational  Highways  Development  Program  (NHDP),  which  includes  (i)  NHDP-I:  the  golden \nquadrilateral  (about  6,000  kilometer  [km]);  and  (ii)  NHDP-II:  the  north-south  corridor  (about \n4,000 km), and east-west corridor (about 3,300 km). Recently the Government launched NHDP-\nIII, consisting of a 10,000 km NHs to integrate the regions, to be implemented by NHAI. NHDP-\nIII covers high-density traffic corridors, state capitals links to NHDP-I and NHDP-II network, and \nroads providing access to economic and tourist centers. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  network  of  national,  state  district,  and  rural  roads  totals  some  3.4  million  km,  of \nwhich only 65,569 km are NHs.13 The network grew 8.5 times, from 400,000 km in 1951. Road \ndensity  is  now  1  km/km2,  which  is  higher  than  in  many  developing  countries.  However,  the \nstandards and conditions of the road network are inadequate to meet rapidly growing demand \nfor freight and passenger traffic. In early 2004, 31% of NHs were 1.0\u20131.5 lane, 63% were 2.0-\nlane, and 6% were 4.0-lane or higher. Over 50% of national and state highways, and more of \nother roads, are in bad condition.  \n \n4. \nNHs carry about 40% of total road traffic. Over the last decade, passenger traffic grew \n7.8%  per  year,  and  freight  traffic  by  7.6%  per  year,  while  the  growth  rate  of  growth  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  was  6.0%.  Traffic  is  projected  to  grow  faster  than  GDP,  which  is  typical  in  the \nearly stages of motorization, and can be expected to continue. \n \n5. \nThe vehicle fleet totaled some 59 million units in 2002. Buses account for 1%, trucks for \n5%,  cars  and  jeeps  for  13%,  and  motorcycles  for  71%.  Auto-rickshaws  (three-wheelers) and \n\nRoad Network, Traffic, and Vehicle Fleet \n\n                                                 \n13  \n\nThe network of national roads totaled 58,112 km until February 2004, when 7,457 km were added. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n23\n\nRoad Freight Services \n\nagricultural tractors and other vehicles made up the remaining 10%. Over the past 10 years, the \ncar  fleet  has  been  growing  at  approximately  9.0%  per  year,  while  heavy  commercial  vehicles \ngrew at 7.6% per year.  \n \nIn  1947,  the  Government  began  to  protect  the  domestic  automobile  manufacturing \n6. \nindustry. To stimulate production of more fuel-efficient, safer, better-quality, affordable vehicles, \nthe  protection  policy  was  eased.  Deregulation  started  with  two-wheelers  in  the  mid-1980s, \nfollowed  by  passenger  cars  and  commercial  vehicles  in  the  1990s.  In  FY2001,  4.75  million \nmotor vehicles were manufactured, a 155% increase over FY1992.  \n  \nD. \n \nProvision  of  road  freight  services  is  a  private  sector  activity.  Market  entry  is  not \n7. \nrestricted. While the Motor Vehicle Act requires prospective truck operators to obtain a permit, \nregional  transport  authorities  usually  grant  permits  to  all  applicants.  So,  in  effect  the  permit \nsystem is used to facilitate collection of state motor vehicle taxes rather than to economically or \ntechnically regulate trucking operations. Motor vehicle taxes are estimated to account for nearly \n10% of state revenue.  \n \n8. \nWhile the Motor Vehicle Act grants state governments the authority to set freight rates, \nthey  rarely  do  so.  Thus,  in  practice  freight  rates  are  not  regulated,  resulting  in  intense \ncompetition among truckers and in passing on of reductions in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) \nfrom improved road conditions to buyers of freight services. \n \nAbout  77%  of  truck  operators  have  fleets  of  no  more  than  five  trucks.  Most  are  family \n9. \nbusinesses.  Truck  operators  with  fleets  of  more  than  20  vehicles  account  for  only  6%  of  the \ntotal, and many use trucks owned by other people, in part to avoid being subject to the Motor \nTransport Workers Act, which limits truckers\u2019 work day to 8 hours. Large fleet operators typically \nhave a network of branches with 12\u201315% of their activity handled by their own trucks, and the \nrest provided by smaller truck operators or brokers. \n \n10. \nThe  trucking  industry\u2019s  efficiency  is  hampered  by  several  factors:  (i)  small  scale  of \noperations, low profitability, and lack of credit, which all contribute to underinvestment in high-\nperformance  trucks  and  result  in  a  high  proportion  of  overage  vehicles;  (ii)  low  level  of \ntransparency  associated  with  the  fragmented  nature  of  the  market,  which  impedes  the  full \nexploitation  of  potential  for  backhaul  cargo;  (iii)  lack  of  sufficient  and  adequate  loading  and \nunloading  facilities,  preventing  transshipment  from  larger  to  smaller  trucks,  which  is  often \nneeded in the periphery of major cities that have truck bans. \n \nE. \n \n11. \nRoad  passenger  transport  services  are  provided  by  the  public  and  private  sectors,  but \nthe share of the public sector has been declining. While the public sector operated 45% of the \nnumber  of  vehicles  in  1980,  its  share  declined  to  21%  in  1999.  Road  passenger  transport  is \nsubject  to  economic,  safety,  and  environmental  regulation.  Economic  regulation  is  the \nresponsibility of the state transport authorities, which control market entry by issuing operating \nlicenses  that  cover  the  service  requirements  (e.g.,  scope  of  business  operations).  The \nauthorities also regulate passenger fares, which are kept low by political pressure. Safety and \nenvironmental  regulation  is  handled  by  regional  transport  authorities.  They  are  responsible for \nregistering vehicles, carrying out safety inspections of vehicles, issuing licenses to professional \ndrivers and conductors, and carrying out inspections of emissions. \n\nRoad Passenger Transport Services \n\n \n\n\f \n24\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n  \n\nRoad Expenditures and Revenues \n\n \n12. \nState  road  transport  undertakings  (SRTUs)  serve  villages,  towns,  and  cities.  Until  the \n1980s, SRTUs dominated passenger transport service. However, owing to a policy of opening \nup  the  market  to  the  private  sector,  their  dominance  has  been  declining.  By  2000,  SRTUs \nowned 118,000 vehicles, while the private sector owned 440,000. Private sector operators own \nsmaller vehicles, including tricycles, and are mostly active in the urban areas. \n \n13. \nCompetition is limited in passenger transport. As fares are regulated and most publicly \nowned  operators  are  not  covering  their  costs,  only  part  of  the  reductions  in  vehicle  operating \ncosts from road improvements will be passed on to passengers. Nevertheless, the economy as \na whole will gain from such reductions.  \n \nF. \n \n14. \nThe central Government funds NH development and maintenance from general taxation, \nwhile  state  governments  fund  state  highways  and  major  district  and  rural  roads.  From  the \nDevelopment  Plan  (1980-1985)  to  the  9th  Development  Plan  (1997-2002),  road  sector \nallocations  increased  11-fold,  from  Rs39  billion  to  Rs475  billion,  while  transport  sector \nallocations  increased  about  seven-fold.  The  road  sector\u2019s  share  in  total  transport  sector \nallocations  increased  from  about  28%  in  the  6th  Development  Plan  to  about  40%  in  the  9th \nDevelopment Plan, reflecting the Government\u2019s commitment to improve highway infrastructure \nto meet the demands of the growing economy and to reduce poverty. \n \n15. \nRevenue  collected  by  the  central  Government  consists  of  import  and  excise  duties  on \nmotor  vehicles  and  accessories,  tires  and  tubes,  and  motor  fuel.  State  revenue  consists  of \nmotor  vehicle  taxes  and  fees,  sales  tax  on  motor  spirits  and  lubricants,  and  taxes  on \npassengers and goods. Total expenditures on roads are estimated to be no higher than 50% of \nrevenues collected from the road transport sector. Part of the excise duty (\u201ccess\u201d) on motor fuel, \nwhich  is  set  at  a  fixed  amount  per  liter,  is  channeled  into  the  Central  Road  Fund  (CRF).  The \nGovernment revamped the fund by increasing the cess to Rs1 per liter for petrol and diesel in \n1999. A further increase to Rs.1.50 per liter was effected in February 2003, which is expected to \nraise Rs90 billion ($2 billion) per annum. These funds are allocated to the different road classes \naccording to a fixed formula stated in the CRF Act of 2000: (i) 50% of the cess on high-speed \ndiesel to develop rural roads; and (ii) 50% of the high-speed diesel plus 100% of petrol for NHs \nand  state  highways  as  follows:  57.5%  for  development  and  maintenance  of  NHs,  30%  for \ndevelopment and maintenance of state roads, and 12.5% for road bridges under or over railway \nlines  and  for  safety  work  on  rail  crossings.  The  revenues  accruing  to  NHs  are  intended \nexclusively to implement the NHDP. Budgetary grants are used to fund the construction of non-\nNHDP national roads and the maintenance of the national network. \n \nG. \n \n16. \nThe  Government\u2019s  approach  to  maintenance  of  NHs  under  NHAI  relies  heavily  on  two \npolicies:  (i)  raising  additional  funds  for  maintenance,  mainly  through  tolling;  and  (ii)  securing \ngreater  private  sector  involvement  to  maintain  the  roads.  As  more  and  more  roads  are \ncompleted under the NHDP, these policies, when properly implemented, should go a long way \nto  improving  network  funding  and  implementation.  Adequate  maintenance  requires  (i) \nestablishment of a comprehensive pavement management system for NHs so that funds can be \njudiciously  allocated;  and  (ii)  development  of  a  planning,  programming,  and  budgeting  system \nthat  treats  highway  expenditures  comprehensively,  based  on  a  detailed  assessment  of  all \nrequirements  for  all  roads,  starting  with  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  and  including \n\nMaintenance \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\nimprovement and upgrading works, bridge improvement and strengthening, and major capacity \nexpansion.  \n \n17. \nConcessions  for  corridor  management  signed  with  private  sector  parties  make  the \nconcessionaire responsible for several functions, including toll collection. Two pilot schemes are \nunder  implementation,  and  new  schemes  that  incorporate  lessons  of  experience  are  under \ndevelopment.  A  road  information  system,  which  has  been  under  development  for  some  time \nwith World Bank financing, is an important step toward an appropriate pavement management \nsystem.  These  initiatives  should  be  pursued  vigorously  so  that  new  policies  can  begin  to  be \nimplemented as and when successive NHDP links are being completed.  \n \nH. \n \n18. \nSince  the  economic  reforms  in  1991,  the  Government  has  actively  promoted  private \nsector financing and management of traditionally public sector activities. The NHAI Act of 1988 \nempowers  the  authority  to  enter  into  any  contract  to  discharge  its  functions.  In  1995,  the \nNational  Highways  Act  of  1956  was  amended  to  (i)  empower  the  central  Government  to  enter \ninto a contract with any private person to develop and maintain an NH or  part thereof; (ii) allow \nthe  person  to  collect  and  retain  fees  for  the  use  of  an  NH,  subject  to  agreement  and  at  rates \nspecified by the central Government; and (iii) allow the person to regulate and control traffic on \nan  NH.  In  1997,  MSRTH  issued  guidelines  for  PSP  in  NHs.  These  were  also  supported  by \npolicy measures to facilitate PSP: (i) according tax incentives to investors in road infrastructure; \n(ii) ensuring NHAI facilitation in relation to all construction preparatory activities, including land \nacquisition  and  removal  of  utilities;  (iii)  enabling  NHAI  to  provide  grants  of  up  to  40%  of  the \nproject  cost;  (iv)  allowing  foreign  direct  investment  of  up  to  100%  of  equity;  and  (v)  allowing \nduty-free import of construction equipment. \n \n19. \nA total of 15 PSP projects have been signed on NH-8 as annuity concessions and 7 as  \nbuild-operate-transfer (BOT) concessions. Ten contracts were also signed under the modality of \nspecial-purpose vehicle. Annuity and toll-based BOT concessions have offered efficiency gains, \nparticularly  as  improved  road  quality  and  availability.  The  schemes  have  proved  successful  in \ntransferring  the  initial  financing,  construction,  and  O&M  risks  to  the  private  sector.  These \nefficiency  gains  need  to  be  considered  in  estimating  the  cost  of  public  vis-\u00e0-vis private sector \ninvestment in the NHDP.  \n \n20. \nLarge  and  certain  traffic  volumes  are  a  precondition  for  toll-based BOT concessions. \nThis  precondition  was  present  in  the  golden  quadrilateral  but  not  in  most  other  highways. \nConsequently,  annuity  concessions  become  the  preferred  modality  for  PSP.  However,  traffic \nrisk  should  be  transferred  to  the  private  sector.  The annuity and BOT concessions have been \nsmall, which is not ideal for O&M. Therefore, (i) other PSP approaches and modalities should be \nexplored  to  mitigate  traffic  risk  and  reduce  the  financing  cost,  and  (ii)  larger  PPP  O&M \nconcessions designed and tested. \n\n \n\n\f \n26\n\nAppendix 3 \n\nNATIONAL HIGHWAYS AUTHORITY OF INDIA\u2019S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND \nSUSTAINABILITY \n\nFinancial Management \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  was  established  under  the  NHAI \nAct  of  1988  to  develop  and  manage  national  highways  (NHs).  NHAI  is  responsible  for \nimplementing the National Highway Development Program Phase I and Phase II (NHDP-I and \nNHDP-II), consisting of 13,300 kilometer [km] of NHs, in 1998\u20132007.1  \n \n2. \nNHAI\u2019s annual financial requirements are submitted to the Ministry of Shipping, Road \nTransport  and  Highways  (MSRTH),  forming  part  of  its  budget,  and  approved  by  Parliament. \nNHAI prepares the budget for each program, segment, package, and activity (e.g., construction \nsupervision, land acquisition, etc) for each quarter. NHAI monitors budget execution at various \nlevels. The project implementation unit (PIU) prepares the physical and financial progress report \nfor  projects  regularly,  and  submits  to  the  head  office  (i)  a  quarterly  fund  use  report,  fund \nrequirement,  trial  balance,  and  bank  reconciliation  statement;  and  (ii)  a  monthly  expenditure \nstatement.  \n \n3. \nPIUs  pay  for  project  construction,  except  for  the  contractors\u2019  mobilization advance \nbill, which is settled and paid by the head office. It transfers funds to the PIUs monthly based on \nthe quarterly budget and on actual expenditures in the monthly statement. NHAI\u2019s physical and \nfinancial performance is also monitored by the task force under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and \nPlanning Commission. \n \n4. \nNHAI\u2019s  accounting  system  is  in  accordance  with  Government  requirements,  and \nNHAI\u2019s financial statements follow the format prescribed by the Comptroller and Auditor General \nof  India  (CAG),  which  audits  NHAI\u2019s  financial  statements  annually.  However,  these  do  not \nprovide  sufficient  information  to  evaluate  NHAI\u2019s  financial  structure  or  performance.  Nor  is \nNHAI\u2019s  accounting  system  adequate  to  manage  the  agency\u2019s  resources.  NHAI  lacks  the \nintegrated physical and financial planning and management systems and integrated accounting \nand  financial  reporting  systems  to  provide  timely  information  to  management  or  to  efficiently \nmanage the agency\u2019s resources or cash flow.14 \n \n5. \nCAG\u2019s  audit  and  certification  of  NHAI\u2019s  financial  statements  are  usually  pending \nabout 8 months following their submission. NHAI thus appointed an external auditor, acceptable \nto the Asian Development Bank, to conduct internal auditing effective in FY2002.  \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nNH  development  and  management  are  two  major  NHAI  operations.  Development \n6. \nexpenditure  is  treated  as  capital  investment  and  is  thus  not  included  in  NHAI\u2019s  operating \nexpenses,  while  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  are  a  recurrent  operating  expense  that \nshould  be  included  in  NHAI\u2019s  income  statement.  As  this  expenditure  does  not  comprise \noperating  expenses  in  the  income  statement,  but  is  offset  against  the  toll  collection  that  is \ncredited  in  the  balance  sheet  as  a  payable  to  the  Government,  the  income  statement  not  an \nadequate basis to assess NHAI financial performance. \n\n                                                 \n1  Recently,  another  10,000  km  of  NHs  (NHDP- III)  have  been  entrusted  to  NHAI.  Since  the  financial  plan  for  implementing \n\nNHDP- III has not been developed, this analysis is limited to NHAI's responsibility for the NHDP- I and NHDP- II. \n\n14  The Asian Development Bank has provided technical assistance to strengthen NHAI\u2019s financial management capacity. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n27\n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\nNHAI financial performance may be measured through budgetary monitoring. Should \n7. \nNHAI become financially autonomous in the long term, with the right to retain toll revenue, the \nonly  viable  parameter  to  evaluate  financial  performance  will  be  NHAI\u2019s  profit.  NHAI\u2019s  income \nstatement should be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. An \nincome  statement  that  reflects  NHAI\u2019s  profitability  is  also  essential  to  raise  funds  from  bond \nmarkets.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nNHAI  projects  that  the  NHDP-I  and  NHDP-II  will  cost  $15.1  billion  over  10  years. \nNHAI  will  raise  $33.8  billion  from  various  funding  sources.  The  balance  of  $18.7  billion \nrepresents debt servicing. Major sources of financing are (i) $17.7 billion from a levy on petrol \nand diesel fuel (52.4%), (ii) $10.7 billion from financial markets (31.7%), (iii) $3.6 billion through \nexternal assistance (10.7%), and (iv) $1.8 billion through private sector participation (5.3%).  \n \n9. \nNHAI\u2019s  cash-flow  projection  does  not  consider  toll  collections  as  a  source  of  funds \nbecause  these  are  remitted  to  the  Government.  However,  NHAI's  right  to  retain  them  will  be \nsanctioned by December 2004, and they will become a major source of funds. O&M expenditure \nwill comprise a major cash outflow for NHAI in the long term. Once toll collections become part \nof  NHAI\u2019s  revenue,  the  need  for  market  borrowings  will  be  substantially  reduced  from  $10.8 \nbillion to $5.0 billion. An additional $3.0 billion will be needed from the market during 2004-2008, \ncompared  with  the  $9.0  billion  that  NHAI  projects,  which  is  feasible  considering  NHAI\u2019s  track \nrecord of raising $1.9 billion for 1999-2003 at an average interest rate of 8.2%. \n \n\nTable A3: Cash Flow Projection, including Toll Revenue  \n ($ million) \n\nItem \nSource of Funds: \n\nFuel Levy \nMarket Borrowing \nExternal Assistance \nPrivate Sector Participation \nToll Revenue \nManagement Fee \n\nTotal \n\nFY1999\u20132003  FY2004\u20132008  FY2009\u20132014  FY2015\u20132019 \n \n5,979 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n6,190 \n1 \n12,170 \n\n \n4,039 \n3,440 \n2,598 \n1,166 \n1,691 \n71 \n13,005 \n\n \n5,805 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n4,839 \n1 \n10,645 \n\n \n1,849 \n1,585 \n971 \n629 \n87 \n22 \n5,143 \n\nUse of Funds: \n\nCapital Works \nDebt Servicing \nCorridor Management \nAdministrative Expense \n\nTotal \n\nNet \n\n \n3,884 \n145 \n171 \n16 \n4,216 \n\n927 \n\n \n11,263 \n2,469 \n843 \n70 \n14,645 \n\n(1,640) \n \n\n \n0 \n7,272 \n2,564 \n113 \n9,949 \n\n696 \n\n \n0 \n1,393 \n2,649 \n117 \n4,159 \n\n8,011 \n\n \n10. \nShould NHAI become financially autonomous, toll revenue must reach the projected \nlevel. The sensitivity analysis shows that a 50% reduction in toll revenue will make it difficult in \nthe long term for NHAI to recover its basic operating expenses for corridor management and for \nadministration. To ensure its financial sustainability, NHAI should be allowed to formally retain \nand spend toll collections. \n\nTotal \n\n \n17,672 \n5,025 \n3,569 \n1,795 \n12,807 \n95 \n40,963 \n\n \n15,147 \n11,279 \n6,227 \n316 \n32,969 \n\n7,994 \n\n \n\n\f2\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nNHAI: MEDIUM-TERM INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING FRAMEWORK  \n \n\nObjectives \n\n\u2022  Develop a new organizational structure based on the two core businesses \u2014project and corridor management \n \n\n\u2022  Establish technical review functions  \n\u2022  Update highway standards and code of practice \n\u2022  Define work load and skill mix requirements of the project implementation unit \n\u2022  Develop an internal rating system of contractors and consultants \n\u2022  Develop a NHDP-III program implementation mechanism  \n\n\u2022  Finalize a contract agreement for developing a pilot corridor management activity \n\u2022  Review the O&M study for Surat-Manor and an O&M implementation plan \n\u2022  Commence a tolling system study  \n\u2022  Develop a tolling system for corridor management on national highways \n\u2022  Implement a road safety zone in north-south corridor  \n\u2022  Review and recommend a road safety system based on the findings of the road safety audit \n\u2022  Integrate the tolling system and road safety concept into a corridor management concept \n\n\u2022  Determine the optimal proportion of permanent staff required \n\u2022  Assess skill-mix requirements for core functions \n\u2022  Establish a permanent officer cadre at levels to achieve optimal organizational efficiency \n\u2022  Develop policies and procedures on (i) recruitment;

The \nconsultant  will  help  NHAI  carry  out  its  institutional  strengthening  activities,  including  planning, \ncoordination,  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  objectives  of  the  action  plan  (Appendix  4)  will \ncover (i) organizational structure, (ii) project management, (iii) corridor management, (iv) human \nresources,  (v)  information  technology  and  system,  and  (vi)  financial  management  and \nprogramming. \n \nStrengthening Project Management Function. The consultant will evaluate the project \n3. \nmanagement  function  of  NHAI  in  the  golden  quadrilateral,  including  lessons  learned  and \nrecommendations  to  improve  effectiveness.  The  consultant  will  assess  the  existing  project \nmanagement-related  workload  and,  based  on  NHAI\u2019s  experience  in  the  golden  quadrilateral, \nestimate the staff resources and skill mix needed to efficiently fulfill NHAI's expanding mandate. \nThe consultant will also  prescribe  and  lay  down  procedures  and  forms  for  procuring  different \nservices, e.g., construction contracts, consultant contracts, PPP and O&M concessions, etc. \n \nUpdating Highway Standards and Code of Practices. Since 1999, modern highways \n4. \nhave  been  designed  and  constructed,  and  a  large  program  of  highway  development  is  in  the \npipeline.  Planning,  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  roads  are  generally  based  on \nestablished  standards  and  codes  of  practice,  prepared  and  published  by  the  Indian  Roads \nCongress.  For  specific  application,  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport  and  Highways \n(MSRTH)  and  NHAI  also  issue  instructions  and  guidelines  from  time  to  time.  However,  some \nstandards  require  updating  and  rationalization  to  be  compatible  with  the  ground  situation  and \ncurrent international practice, and new standards or codes on certain critical aspects need to be \ndeveloped  to  modernize  highway  development.  The  review  may  cover  traffic,  capacity, \ngeometric,  pavement,  expressway  design,  performance-related  maintenance,  public-private \npartnership, road safety, and other aspects, and will be implemented in two stages. \n \n5. \n \n\nStage I will cover the following: \n\n  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\nReview  the  existing  standards  and  codes  of  practice  in  the  context  of ground \nconditions and establish the need to update them and prepare new ones;  \nList  the  standards  and  codes  requiring  update,  based  on  discussions  with  the \nsteering committee;  \nOrganize a workshop for the focus group; and \nDevelop  a  detailed  work  plan  to  review  and  update  the  list  of  standards  and \ncodes, and estimate the inputs and time schedule. \n\nStage II will cover the following: \n\n(a) \n\nFor the approved subjects, update and revise the standards, code, and manual, \nalong with explanatory notes on the justification for and impacts of the revision; \n\n \n6. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n31\n\n \n\n  \nB. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nSubmit  the  revised  and  updated  drafts  through  the  steering  committee  for \napproval; and \nAfter the steering committee approves the drafts, consolidate a detailed report on \nall  the  consultant\u2019s  activities,  the  collected  data  and  analysis  thereof,  and  the \njustification  for  updating  or  developing  standards  and  code,  including  a  copy  of \nthese  as  approved  by  the  steering  committee  and  in  a  form  suitable  for  quick \nprocessing by the Indian Road Congress for publication as a national standard. \n\nImplementation Arrangement \n\n7. \nThe  overall  implementation  of  this  component  will  be  coordinated  by  the  general \nmanager (administration), who will be responsible for day-to-day implementation. With regard to \nthe  update  of  highway  standards  and  the  code  of  practices,  a  steering  committee  chaired  by \nMSRTH,  with  members  drawn  from  NHAI,  MSRTH,  focus  groups,  and  specialists  in  the \nconcerned areas, will be constituted to plan, program, review, direct, and approve the findings of \nthis subcomponent. The recommendations prepared by the consultant, who will be engaged not \nlater  than  4  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  will  be  presented  to  the  steering  committee  for \napproval.  Physical  testing  and  piloting  might  be  necessary.  The  documents will be processed \nthrough MSRTH for publication as national standards by June 2008. \n \n \n.\n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 7  \n\nDESIGN FEATURES AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS \n \n\n \n1. \nThe Project includes widening and upgrading of 566 kilometer (km) stretches into four-\nlane  highways  consisting  313  km  from  Lalitpur  to  Lakhnadon  and  252  km  from  Kurnool  to \nAndhra  Pradesh/Karnataka  Border  along  the  north-south  corridor.  The  project  road  sections \nhave  single-  to  two-lane  carriageway  configurations,  with  flexible  pavement  in  fair  to  poor \ncondition.  Most of the bridges are old and narrow and many are submersible. The road passes \nthrough plain or mildly rolling terrain with small stretches negotiating a hilly section.  \n \n2. \nThe  design  criteria  are  in  accordance  with  the  latest  guidelines  and  circulars  of  the \nMinistry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport  and  Highways  (MSRTH),  and  publications  of  the  Indian \nRoads  Congress  and  Bureau  of  Indian  Standards.  For  aspects  not  covered  by  the  last  two \nagencies\u2014as for comparative evaluation of optimizing critical components such as pavements, \ninterchanges,  etc.\u2014international  standards  such  as  those  of  the  American,  British,  and \nAustralian standards, among others, have been adopted as appropriate. \n\nA detailed description of the design approach is as follows: \n\n \n\n3. \n \n\n(i) \n\nCross  section.  The  highway  cross-section  has  a  dual  carriageway  of  7.25 \nmeters (m), including a 0.25 m kerb shyness, each with 1.50 m paved shoulder \nand 1.00 m unpaved shoulder. A median width of 4.5 m is provided, which could \nbe increased in short stretches up to 12.0 m to save avenues of large trees, or \nreduced to 1.2 m in difficult hilly or built-up areas. The standard roadway width is \n24 m, and the bridges will be wide enough to carry through the carriageways and \nshoulders in each direction, which follow the MSRTH design guidelines for a four-\nlane divided carriageway. \n\nRight-of-way. A right of way of 60 m will be provided in conformity with MSRTH \nguidelines, and to reduce roadside friction. \n\nDesign speed. For plain terrain, the ruling and minimum design speeds are 100 \nand 80 km/hour (hr), respectively, and for rolling terrain, 80 and 65 km/hr. \n\nPavement  design.  Widening  the  carriageways  will  require  200\u2013250 millimeter \n(mm)  granular  sub-base,  200\u2013250  mm  wet  mix  macadam,  80\u2013150 mm dense \nbituminous macadam, and 40\u201350 mm bituminous concrete as per requirements \nof  specific  sections.  Similarly,  strengthening  the  carriageway  will  require  dense \nbituminous  macadam  varying  from  100  to  150  mm,  and  40\u201350 mm bituminous \nconcrete. \n\nBypasses. To avoid densely built-up areas in villages and towns, bypasses are \nproposed,  particularly  for  Lalitpur  (6.9  km),  Babina  (5.6  km),  Sagar  (26.0  km), \nPemukonda  (9  km),  Ulindakonda  (11.5  km),  and  Gooty  (12  km).  The  Lalitpur \nbypass  is  already  of  two-lane  standard  and  will  be  upgraded  to  a  four-lane \ndivided carriageway under the Project. The bypasses will also have a right of way \nof  60  m  and  parallel  service  roads  where  warranted.  Land  boundaries  will  be \nfenced.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nBridges.  The  Project  includes  reconstruction  to  four-lane  standard  of  all \nsubmersible bridges and widening of other bridges in good condition. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n4. \ndesign: \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 7\n\n33\n\n \n\n(vii)  Drainage.  The  Project  will  provide  drainage  and  protection  against  erosion.  At \nhigh-embankment locations, a system of kerb and chute will dispose of surface \nwater. \n\nThe  following  safety  and  roadside  features  will  also  be  incorporated  into  the  highway \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nA  high  degree  of  access  control  will  be  provided  through  grade  separators, \nrailway  over  bridges,  underpasses,  and  fencing.  At  busy  cattle-crossing points, \n2.5 m x 3.5 m box-type structures will be constructed to serve as cattle passes. \n\nBus stops with passenger shelters will be constructed. The designs will provide \nfor  5  m-wide stopping bays and raised footways so that passengers can safely \nexit and enter buses.  \n\nTruck  lay-bys  will  be  constructed  at  traditional  truck  parking  and  loading  & \nunloading locations. These parking lay-bys will provide access routes on and off \nthe main highway, and will be sized to accommodate the need of each location. \n\nGuard rail or crash barrier will be constructed at high-embankment (height > 3 m) \nlocations and at approaches to bridges. \n\nService roads of a carriageway width of 7.0 m or 5.5 m, separated from the main \nhighway carriageway by a drain, will be constructed in urban and built-up areas \nto  segregate  slow-moving  local  traffic  from  fast-moving  traffic  on  the  highway. \nThese service roads, besides effecting access control, will serve the needs of the \nlocal communities and settlements along the highway. \n\nThe  geometrics  of  the  road,  including  all  junctions,  will  be  improved to provide \nturning radius, road markings, traffic signs, traffic signal controls at major urban \njunctions, etc. Urban roads will have footpaths, pedestrian crossings and railings, \ncovered drains, etc. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nSUBPROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES \n \n\nA. \n\nSubproject Requirements \n\n \nRequirements for each subproject follow: \n\n1. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(viii) \n \n(ix) \n\nThe subproject will be part of the National Highway Development Program, with \npriority  given  to  the  north-south  corridor  except  as  otherwise  agreed  to  by  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \n\nThe subprojects will be technically sound, and a feasibility study and preliminary \ndesign will have been prepared. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) \nwill  ensure  that  the  detailed  subproject  report  will  be  prepared  within  no  more \nthan 5 months of subproject approval. Road safety audit will be conducted during \nproject design. \n\nThe  subprojects  will  be  economically  feasible,  and  their  estimated  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  equal  to  or  higher  than  12%,  based  on  the  economic \nanalysis to be conducted in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects  and assumptions laid down in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\nEnvironmental screening will be conducted for all subprojects. Any classified as \ncategory  A \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  2003  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines,  will  not  be  eligible  under  the  Project.  The  subprojects  will  not  pass \nthrough  or  be  within  or  less  than  1  kilometer  (km)  from  protected  areas  as \ndesignated by the Government, including sanctuaries or national parks.  For each \nsubproject,  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report  will  be  prepared, \nincluding  an  environmental  management  plan, \nthe \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (Supplementary Appendix I).  \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nThe  subprojects  will  be  socially  sound  and  include  measures  to  mitigate  any \npossible  social  impacts.  For  each  subproject,  an  initial  poverty  and  social \nassessment  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  Initial \nPoverty and Social Assessment. \n\nResettlement  plans  for  the  subprojects  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  K)  and  ADB's  policy  on \ninvoluntary resettlement.  \n\nIf  any  indigenous  peoples  or  scheduled  tribes  are  likely  to  be  affected \nsignificantly by a subproject, an indigenous people's development plan or special \naction will be prepared following the measures set forth in the indigenous people \ndevelopment framework (Supplementary Appendix L). \n\nAll necessary central and state government approvals will be obtained. \n\nSufficient  Government  counterpart  funding  will  be  allocated  to  implement  the \nsubprojects. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n35\n\nProcedures \n\nB. \n \n2. \n \n\nEach subproject will be prepared and processed in accordance the following procedures: \n\nA  feasibility  study  for  subprojects  will  be  conducted by consultants engaged by \nNHAI, which will fill out checklists (Supplementary Appendix M) for initial poverty \nand  social  assessment,  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  people,  and \nenvironmental screening. These documents will be sent for review to ADB, which \nmay require revisions. \n\nUpon completion of the preliminary design, NHAI will prepare and submit to ADB \na  summary  appraisal  report  (Supplementary  Appendix  N)  for  each  subproject, \ntogether  with  the  required  attachments,  including  a  resettlement  plan,  IEE, \nsummary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategies,  and  indigenous  people \ndevelopment plan or special action if required.  \n\nNHAI will translate into the local language each subproject resettlement plan and \ndisclose it to the affected people before submitting it to ADB. NHAI will revise the \nresettlement  plan  if  required,  based  on  comments  from  the  affected  people  and \nADB.  \n\nNHAI will disclose each subproject summary IEE to the public before submitting it \nto ADB.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nADB  will  review  the  summary  appraisal  reports,  together  with  the  required \nattachments.  If  it  finds  that  the  subproject  does  not  satisfy  eligibility  criteria  and \nprocedures,  or  does  not  comply  with  ADB's  policies,  ADB  may  advise  NHAI  to \nmodify the subprojects. \n\nOrganizational Arrangements \n\nNHAI  will  appraise  the  subprojects,  while  ADB  will  advise  NHAI  to  comply  with  the \n\n \n3. \nBased  on  ADB's  approval,  and  subject  to  any  modification  and  remedial  measures \nrequired by ADB, NHAI will implement the subprojects. NHAI will ensure that ADB has access to \nall  documents  related  to  the  subproject  proposals  and  approval  process.  These  documents \nshould be kept for 5 years after approval. \n \nC. \n \n4. \neligibility criteria and procedures and to follow other relevant policies. \n \n5. \nThe  project  management  unit,  headed  by  the  chief  general  managers  in  charge  of  the \nNorth-South  corridor,  will  process  the  subprojects,  assisted  by  the  technical  audit  team  for \nquality control of subproject preparation and contract implementation. This team will review and \nexamine all technical reports, including feasibility studies, preliminary design reports, IEEs, RPs, \nand  detailed  design  reports,  to  ensure  that  Government  and  ADB  requirements  are  fully  met. \nThe NHAI chair will oversee project activities. \n \n6. \nThe  technical  audit  team  will  evaluate  the  viability  of  each  subproject  and  prepare  a \nsummary appraisal report to be submitted to ADB for approval. This report will require clearance \nfrom  the  concerned  chief  general  manager  and  the  NHAI  chair  before  it  is  submitted  to  ADB \nalong with all necessary attachments. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 9  \n\nROAD SAFETY COMPONENT  \n \n\n1. \nThe road safety zone will be equipped with (i) advanced traffic management systems to \ncentrally  monitor  the  road  situation,  (ii)  weigh-in-motion  or  static  weighing  platforms  for \ncontrolling  overloading,  (iii)  speed-monitoring  equipment,  and  (iv)  ambulances  and  other  relief \nequipment. A steering committee has been established, headed by the chief general manager \nfor  corridor  management  of  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  (NHAI),  with  representatives \nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport  and  Highways,  and  other  central  and  state \nagencies.  \n \n2. \nThe road safety zone concept will be implemented under the proposed Project for a road \nsection of about 200 km to be agreed on between Asian Development Bank (ADB) and  NHAI. \nThe road safety component will consist of (i) provision of consulting services, (ii) procurement of \nroad safety equipment, and (iii) establishment of motor driving training institute. \n \n3. \nA  domestic  consulting  team  will  be  recruited  to  design  (i)  institutional arrangements to \nenforce traffic rules and overloading control, (ii) operational arrangements to provide emergency \nmedical  services,  and  (iii)  integrated  management  of  road  safety  equipment.  The  consultant \nthen  will  (i)  assess  road  safety  issues  along  the  selected  section;  (ii)  establish  a  road  safety \nindicator  baseline;  (iii)  following  the  road  safety  zone  concept,  recommend  solutions  for  the \nselected section; (iv) propose road safety equipment to implement the concept, and help NHAI \nprocure  and  install  the  equipment;  (v)  develop  and  provide  training  for  implementing  and \nenforcement staff; (vi) regularly monitor and evaluate the safety zone; and (vii) establish a motor \ndriving  training  institute.  About  24  person-months  of  consulting  inputs  will  be  required, \ncomprising  three  road  safety  specialists,  with  expertise  in  engineering,  enforcement,  and \nevaluation.  The  tasks  will  be  implemented  over  6  months.  Thereafter,  the  consultants  will \nannually monitor and evaluate the road safety zone for 3 years. The following list of indicative \nroad  safety  equipment  will  be  refined  by  the  consultant  and,  together  with  the  recommended \nconcept, will be reviewed and approved by the road safety committee. \n \n\nTable A9: Indicative Road Safety Equipment \n\n\u2022  Interceptor Vehicles  \n\u2022  Computer Hardware and Software for Accident \n\nData Analysis  \n\n\u2022  Advanced Laser or Video Cameras for Recording  \n\nVehicle Traffic Speed \n\n\u2022  Patrol Vehicles  \n\u2022  Variable Message Signs  \n\u2022  Meteorological System  \n\u2022  Cranes for Disposal of Vehicles  \n\u2022  Ambulances  \n\u2022  Medical and Support Equipment for Trauma and \n\nFirst Aid \n\n\u2022  Emergency Telephone System  \n\u2022  Computer Hardware/Software \n\u2022  Manuals  \n\u2022  Public Awareness Mobile Kits and Vehicles  \n\u2022  Establishment of Motor Driving Training Institute \n\u2022  Traffic Management Laboratory and Black Spot \n\n \n\n \n\nQuantity \n5 \n2 \n \n5 \n \n5 \n\nUnit Price \n$180,000 \n$80,000 \n \n$40,000 \n \n$20,000 \n\n10 \n2 \n4 \n5 \n10 \n \n200 \n\n \n5 \nsets  \n1 \n\n \n\n$7,400 \n$22,500 \n$90,000 \n$40,000 \n$12,100 \n \n$3,700 \n\n \n$100,000 \n \n$1,000,000 \n \n$4,000,000 \n\nTotal Price \n$900,000 \n$160,000 \n \n$200,000 \n \n$100,000 \n\n$74,000 \n$45,000 \n$360,000 \n$200,000 \n$121,000 \n \n$740,000 \n\n$500,000 \n \n$1,000,000 \n\n \n\n \n\n$4,000,000 \n\n \n\n$8,400,000 \n\nEngineering \n \n\nTotal \n\nAnalysis \n\nNote: The quantity and unit price will be confirmed by the consultant during implementation.\n\nEquipment \nEnforcement \n \n\nInformation \n \nEmergency \nResponse \n \n\nEducation \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10\n\n37\n\n \n\nHIV/AIDS AND TRAF FICKING IN WOMEN AND CHILDREN \n\n \nStatistics of the National AIDS15 Control Organization (NACO) for 2001 show that India \n1. \nhas  close  to  4  million  HIV- 16infected  people,  the  highest  in  the  region.  As  of  August  2003, \nMadhya  Pradesh  had  1,024  officially  reported  cases  of  infection,  and  Uttar  Pradesh,  1,083. \nTraffic on National Highway (NH) 26 is not very dense, and it has few rest areas. However, with \nthe  improvement  of  NH26,  traffic  volume  (mainly  trucks)  is  likely  to  increase,  which  may \nintensify  commercial  sex  activities  at  the  rest  areas  used  by  truck  drivers  and  helpers, \nencouraging transmission of the AIDS virus, and human trafficking. \n \n2. \nThe environment and social development unit within the National Highways Authority of \nIndia (NHAI) will establish an HIV/ AIDS cell to implement and monitor anti-HIV/AIDS and anti-\ntrafficking  interventions.  Assisted  by  the  World  Bank,  a  framework  (action  plan)  for  the  cell, \nincluding  its  resource  requirements,  is  being  prepared.  The Project will help the cell (i) design \nand  implement  a  program  to  combat  HIV/AIDS  along  the  project  highways  (NH26  and  NH7). \nThe  Project  will  also  help  NHAI  monitor  socioeconomic  performance  indicators  along  these \nhighways (as indicated in Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n3. \nStrategies.  The  program  will  (i)  combat  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  through \nmultifaceted  programs,  and  (ii)  establish  modes  of  operation  and  procedures  to  mitigate  and \nprevent AIDS and trafficking along the highway corridor. \n \n4. \ndeveloped between NHAI and NACO. Key areas of activities include the following: \n\nCombating  HIV/AIDS.

Approximately  313  km  on \nNH26,  between  Lalitpur  to  Lakhnadon,  were  selected  for  sample  economic  and  financial \nanalysis.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  sample  roads  was  done  by  using  the  highway  and \ndesign maintenance model (HDM-4). The benefits to road users were estimated by comparing \nthe  differences  between  costs  in  the  without-  and  with-project  cases.  Project  roads  will  be \nupgraded  to  dual  two-lane carriageways, resulting in reduced vehicle operating costs (VOCs), \nwhich  will  stimulate  economic  growth.  The  model  compared  the  annual  streams  of  economic \ncapital  and  operating  costs  and  benefits,  and  computes  the  net  present  value  (NPV)  and  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR). All costs and benefits were expressed in 2004 constant \nprices. The analysis covers the construction period and 20 years of operation.  \n \n\n1. \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\nRoad  Condition.  The  road  condition  has  been  investigated  through  topographic, \n3. \npavement condition, and roughness surveys. Based on traffic flow and pavement condition, the \nsample  road  was  divided  into  four  homogeneous  sections.  Surface  roughness  levels,  in \naccordance  with  the  international  roughness  index  (IRI),  for  each  section  are  shown  in  Table \nA16.1.  \n \n\nTable A16.1: Sample Project Road Condition \n\nDescription \n\nDistance  \n(km) \n106.0 \n98.0 \n109.7 \n\nLalitpur-Sagar  \nSagar-Rajmarg  Chauraha \nRajmarg  ChaurahaLakhnadon \n\nAverage Roughness   \nIRI, m/km \n 6.0 \n 9.0 \n10.0 \n\nRoad  \nSection \n1 \n2 \n3 \nIRI = international roughness index, km = kilometer, m = meter. \nSource: Feasibility Study report. \n \n4. \nTraffic Volume . Traffic volume on the project road was measured at various locations. \nEach  traffic  count  was  for  7  days.  Origin-destination  counts  were  also  done  at  some  traffic \nsurvey stations. Survey results were normalized by applying seasonal factors to obtain annual \naverage  daily  traffic  for  the  base  year.  Traffic  counts  were  split  into  motorized  (cars,  pick-up \ntrucks,  buses,  trucks,  light  commercial  vehicles,  and  motorcycles)  and  nonmotorized  traffic \n(bicycles  and  animal-drawn  vehicles).  Traffic  volume  ranged  from  2,594  to  4,693  vehicles  per \nday, with about 84% motorized and 16% nonmotorized.  \n \n5. \nTraffic Growth. Traffic growth rates were based on an analysis of various parameters. \nThe net state domestic product growth was examined and future growth estimated. The income \nelasticity  of  transport  demand  was  used  to  determine  traffic  growth  rate  for  each  vehicle \ncategory.  Traffic  growth  rates  adopted  varied  from  3%  to  12%  per  annum,  depending  on  the \nvehicle  type  and  the  year.  Based  on  the  average  vehicle  composition  for  the  project  road,  the \noverall growth rate is about 8.0% for 2004\u20132009, 8.5% for 2010\u20132014, and 8.0% for 2015 and \nbeyond.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n \n47\n\n2. \n\nCosts and Benefits \n\n6. \nCosts.  Economic  costs  were  derived  from  financial  costs  and  include  costs  for \nconstruction  and  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Economic  costs  exclude  price \ncontingencies,  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  during  construction.  A  standard  conversion  factor  of \n0.9 was applied to financial costs of non-traded inputs to calculate economic prices. A shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.85 was used to obtain the economic costs of unskilled labor. The project \nroads are expected to have an average economic life of 20 years. Incremental O&M costs were \ncalculated  as  the  difference  between  maintenance  requirements  for  the  proposed  four-lane \nhighway  and  existing  two-lane  highway.  In  the  without-  and  with-project  scenarios,  routine \nmaintenance as well as periodical surface renewal will be required.  \n \nBenefits. The upgraded highway will improve traffic flow, increase vehicle speeds, and \n7. \nshorten travel time, all resulting in lower VOCs. The main economic project benefits are (i) VOC \nsavings for normal traffic,17 and (ii) time savings for passengers and cargo transport. Pavement \ndeterioration  and  yearly  VOCs  over  the  life  of  the  investment  were  predicted.  In  with-  and \nwithout-project  cases,  the  IRI  varies  from  year  to  year  according to traffic movement and the \nmaintenance applied, which directly impacts on VOC and level of benefits. Then life-cycle costs \nfor the with- and without-project situations were compared. The NPV and EIRR were computed, \ndiscounting the stream of costs and benefits over 2005\u20132027, and valuing them at present 2004 \nlevels.  \n \n\nTable A16.2: Summary of NPV and EIRR \n\nRoad Section \n\nDescription \n\nLength \n(km) \n\nNPV \n(Rs Million) \n\nSection 1 \nSection 2 \nSection 3 \n\nLalitpur-Sagar  \nSagar-Rajmarg  Chauraha \nRajmarg  Chauraha-Lakhnadon \n\n \n\n \n\n106.0 \n98.0 \n109.7 \nTotal \n\n 24.69 \n 819.42 \n1,888.64 \n2,732.75 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, km = kilometer, NPV = net present value, Rs = rupees. \nSource: Staff analysis. \n \n\n3. \n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\n12.1 \n14.6 \n17.8 \n14.9 \n\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  total  EIRR  was  analyzed  with  respect  to  changes  in  the  benefit-\n8. \nand-cost  streams,  including  (i)  increase  in  construction  costs  by  20%,  (ii)  reduction  in  benefits \nby 20%, (iii) exclusion of the value of time-saving benefits, (iv) delay in project completion by 2 \nyears, and (v) a combination of an increase in capital costs of 20% and a reduction of benefits \nby  20%.  A  further  sensitivity  test  examined  the  effect  of  diverted  traffic  on  the  project  road. \nOrigin-destination surveys, and a traffic assignment model of a previous study, showed that 500 \ntrucks could be diverted from NH7 and NH8 to the project road once it was improved. \n \nThe EIRR for NH26 as a whole is 14.9%. The Project remains economically viable under \n9. \nvarious  changes  in  the  benefit-and-cost  streams  as  the  EIRR  remains  above  the  opportunity \ncost of capital of 12%, except when (i) benefits are reduced by 20%, and (ii) project capital costs \nare increased by 20% and benefits reduced by 20%. Risk analysis shows that these scenarios \nare improbable.  \n                                                 \n17  Normal  traffic  refers  to  projected  traffic  on  the  road  under  the  with- and without-project scenarios.

The  analysis  ran  a  simulation, in which \npossible values of the variables were randomly sampled 5,000 times using a Monte Carlo non-\nstratified  technique.  This  information  was  then  used  to  analyze  every  possible  outcome, \nexecuting  hundreds  of  what-if  scenarios.  In  each,  random  inputs  following  the  defined  input \nprobability  distribution  were  generated,  and  the  resulting  frequency  distributions  presented  in \ngraphical form. The analysis results are in Table A16.4. \n \n\nTable A16.4: Results of Risk Analysis \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n14.9 \n \n12.4 \n11.9 \n12.3 \n13.8 \n10.1 \n14.8 \n\n% \n14.9 \n 4.5 \n10.9 \n16.1 \n13.6 \n\nScenario \nOriginal Base EIRR \nProbability of EIRR Less than 12% \nMinimum EIRR Estimate \nMaximum EIRR Estimate \nMedian EIRR Estimate \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return   \nSource: Staff analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nDistribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio \n\n11. \nThe economic benefits consist of road-user benefits, i.e., VOC savings for normal traffic, \nand  time  savings.  The  distribution  analysis  disaggregates  these  into  benefits  for  passengers \nand  freight  users,  vehicle  owners  and  operators,  labor,18  and  the  Government.  The  following \nwere  estimated:  (i)  how  much  of  the  benefits  for  each  vehicle  category  in  the  analysis  will  be \npassed on to the user of the vehicle, and (ii) ownership of each vehicle category. Field surveys \nwere done along the sample subproject road, and passengers, drivers, and farmers interviewed \nin each district. These surveys yielded a series of assumptions about what will be passed on to \nthe service user. The poverty impact  ratio (PIR) was estimated by determining how much of the \nbenefits to each class of user are passed on to the poor.  \n \n12. \nThe estimated direct benefits to the economy in present value (PV) terms are presented \nusing a discount rate of 12%, representing the sum of the PV of benefits to passengers, freight \nusers, vehicle owners, and the Government. The PIR for the sample road is 1.12. The estimated \ndirect  benefits  of  the  sample  road  are  Rs15,655  million,  in  PV  terms,  representing  the  sum  of \nthe PV of benefits to passengers, freight users, vehicle owners, and the Government. The net \n\n                                                 \n18  As some of the capital and maintenance expenditures will be for local labor, unskilled laborers will gain net benefits \n\nif their wages are higher than their opportunity cost of labor.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n \n49\n\nbenefit  to  the  economy  as  a  whole  is  Rs  2,779  million.  These  are  conservative  estimates, \nbecause only direct project benefits have been considered. Based on the uncertain assumptions \nin  the  PIR  calculation,  a  sensitivity  analysis  of  some  key  assumptions  has  been  done.  The \nsensitivity tests were (i) a 50% increase in competition, and (ii) a 50% decrease in competition \nof passenger and freight services. It shows that increased competition increases the PIR.  \n \n\nTable A16.5: Sensitivity Analysis of Poverty Impact Ratio \n\nItem \nBase Poverty Impact Ratio \n50% Increase in Competition \n50% Reduction in Competition \n\nSource: Staff analysis. \n\nSample Subprojects \n1.12 \n1.22  \n1.02 \n\n \n13. \nA risk analysis was also done on the PIR. The results show that the expected PIR based \non  the  weighted  average  of  all  simulated  combinations  is  1.30.  The  PIRs  range  from  0.36  to \n2.46.  \n \nB. \n\nSummary Financial Analysis \n\n \n\n14. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  calculated on the basis of incremental \nfinancial costs and benefits resulting from the Project over the construction period and 20 years \nof economic benefits. Financial costs and benefits are in 2004 constant prices. \n \n15. \nCosts. Project costs comprise capital costs and (O&M). Capital costs include civil works; \nenvironmental  improvement  works;  land  acquisition,  relocation  of  utilities,  and  resettlement \ncosts;  construction  supervision;  and  taxes  and  duties.  Capital  costs  are  to  be  incurred  over  3 \nyears,  from  2005  to  2007.  O&M  costs  include  annual  routine  maintenance  and  periodic \nmaintenance.  The  costs  used  for  O&M  are  those  used  in  the  economic  evaluation  but  in \nfinancial  prices.  Routine  maintenance  cost  is  about  Rs100,000/km,  and  periodic  maintenance \ncost (applied every 5 years) about Rs2 million/km.  \n \n16. \nBenefits. Toll revenues are based on the traffic levels and growth rates and have been \nprojected at 2004 constant prices. Toll rates are based on those issued by the Ministry of Road \nTransport  and  Highways  in  1997  and  adjusted  to  2004  prices.  Toll  rates  per  kilometer are (i) \nRs0.55  for  cars  or  pick-up  trucks,  (ii)  Rs0.96  for  long  vehicles,  and  (iii)  Rs1.92  for  buses  or \ntrucks. A capture rate of traffic using the toll road is assumed at 75%. \n  \n\n \n1. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n17. \nThe  FIRR  is  calculated  at  3.3%,  below  the  Project\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC) in real terms at 4.6%.19 An FIRR lower than the WACC implies that the sample roads \nare  not  commercially  viable,  mainly  because  of  the  low  level  of traffic, and that private sector \nparticipation  will  be  possible  only  when  NHAI  financially  supports  the  investment  with  an  up-\nfront  lump  sum,  or  with  an  annuity  payment  over  the  project  period.  This  implies  that  national \nresources are transferred to the users in the form of VOC and time savings that are higher than \nthe  price  users  pay.  This  resource  transfer  can  be  justified  as  long  as  the  roads  generate \nreasonable  EIRRs  and  are  chosen  according  to  the  national  priority  for  the  use  of  national \n\n                                                 \n19  The  WACC  was  calculated  based  on  the  following  assumptions:  (i)  69%  Government  funding  at  5%  interest \n(approximately  equal  to  a  10-year  Treasury  Bond  rate),  (ii)  13%  Government  loan  at  13%,  (iii)  18%  NHAI  bond \nissue at 5%, (iv) domestic inflation of 4%, and (v) NHAI\u2019s tax-exempt status to be continued. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nresources.  Toll  revenues,  however,  will  be  able  to  cover  recurring  costs  for  road  operation, \nincluding routine and periodic maintenance upon completion, which demonstrates that the core \nsection will be financially sustainable even with no further injection of national resources. \n \n\nTable A16.6: Summary of FIRR for the Sample Roads \n\nRoad Section \n\nLalitpur - Sagar  \nSagar \u2013 Rajmarg Chauraha \nRajmarg Chauraha  \u2013 Lakhnadon \n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return     \nSource: Staff analysis. \n\nTotal \n  \n\nFIRR  \n(%) \n1.5 \n2.7 \n5.5 \n3.3 \n\n2. \n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis \n\n18. \nSeveral tests were undertaken to determine the sensitivity of the FIRR to changes in toll \nlevels,  traffic  capture  ratio,  traffic  volume  and  traffic  volume  growth  rate,  O&M  costs,  and \ndelayed project completion. The FIRR is most sensitive to reductions in tariff level, traffic growth \nrate  assumptions,  and  rate  of  traffic  capture.  An  appropriate  toll  strategy  as  well  as  verified \ntraffic  growth  assumptions  will  be  critical  to  ensure  the  Projects  financial  viability  and \nsustainability.  Diverting  truck  traffic  from  NH7  and  NH8  to  the  project  road  would  increase  the \nFIRR from 3.3% to 5.0%. \n \n\nTable A16.7: FIRR Sensitivity Test of Sample Subprojects \n\nScenario \n\nBase Case \nSensitivity Tests \n\nCapital Costs Increase by 20% \nDecrease in Toll Levels by 20% \nDecrease in Traffic Growth Rates by 20% \nDecrease in Traffic Capture by 20%  \nDiverted Truck Traffic from NH7 and NH8 \n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Staff analysis. \n\n \nDue to the uncertainties in several key parameters, a risk analysis was also done using \n19. \n@Risk.

Infrastructure  development  encourages  other  development \ninitiatives, which together considerably stimulate economic growth leading to poverty reduction. \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeting Classification: General Intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis   \n \nThe  Project  will  upgrade  566  kilometers  (km)  of  the  key  highway  network,  particularly  the  north-south corridor \nunder  sector  loan  modality.  Poverty  analysis  was  carried  out  along  the  sample  roads  of  about  313  km,  from \nLalitpur to Lakhnadon, covering 2 districts in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and 3 districts in Madhya Pradesh (MP). \n \nThe poverty level in the Project area is between 31% and 37%, significantly higher than India\u2019s average of 27%. \nThe  estimated  annual  per  capita  income  of  those  living  below  poverty  level  is  Rs3,889  (less  than  $90)  in  each \nstate. The poverty incidence in the project districts ranges from 22.8% in Narsimhapur to 51.78% in Sagar. The \nproject area is predominantly rural and passes through a total of 93 villages and small towns and 5 urban areas \nin the two states. The rural poor have limited access to socioeconomic services.  \n \nThe Project aims to connect northern and southern India. Although not a poverty intervention, the Project will, by \nvirtue  of  passing  through  rural  areas  where  a  large  percentage  of  the  population  below  poverty  line  lives,  help \nreduce  poverty  by  encouraging  human  development  and  economic  growth.  Increased  connectivity  with \nmainstream  economic  regions  will  also  help  reduce  regional  disparities  between  fast-growing  and  backward \nstates.  The  economic  analysis  estimated  the  Project\u2019s  net  economic  benefits  as  Rs.2,787  million,  and  the \npoverty impact ratio as more than 1, meaning that the poor will receive most of the gross economic benefits but \ncontribute only a small share of the gross investment costs. This indicates that the Project is highly pro-poor. \n\n  Yes \n   Yes \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nConsultations  and  meetings  with  the  various  project  communities  were  organized  during  the  social  analysis  to \nascertain  their  response  to  road  construction,  the  communities\u2019  needs  and  demands,  an  estimate  of  the \ncommunities\u2019 losses, and steps to mitigate them. Twenty-two focus group discussions were also held with men, \nwomen, farmers, indigenous people, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other disadvantaged groups. \nPublic  participation  through  household  surveys  and  focus  group  meetings  in  the  project  area  highlighted  what \npeople thought would be major project benefits: \n \n\n  No \n  No \n\nBetter roads mean more reliable and cheaper transportation to markets.  \nRural laborers will increase their income during project road construction by working at unskilled \njobs, and will thus be able to purchase consumer goods.  \nBetter access to educational facilities will reduce illiteracy. The project area in MP has a literacy \nrate of 76%  for males and 50% for females, and in UP, 70% and 43%. \nIncreased mobility enables people to look for jobs, even when agricultural work is slow. \nIncreased access to other services will reduce poverty and improve the quality of life. Improved \nroads  will  give  the  poor  access  to  services,  decrease  travel  time,  and  ensure  that  medical \nfacilities can be reached efficiently.  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n(vi) \n\nA large part of the traffic on the road is freight, mostly carrying agricultural produce. Reductions \nin  freight  vehicle  operators\u2019  costs  may  be  passed  on  to  farmers  or  shippers  as  lower  freight \nrates. A fall in the cost of moving freight will also reduce product costs. \n\n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nBased  on  the  premise  that  no  development  activity  can  be  gender  neutral,  gender  participation  was  ensured \nduring  the  social  study  by  a  gender  analysis  to  see  how  the  Project  would  impact  on  women.  The  Project  will \nbenefit  men  and  women,  and  offer  women  special  benefits  by  increasing  girls\u2019  access  middle-  and  higher-level \neducation, and women\u2019s and children\u2019s access to improved local services and high levels of health care outside \nthe  village.  Focus  group  discussions  with  the  women  of  various  castes  and  communities  revealed  that  they  all \nfavored  construction  of  a  road.  However,  they  raised  some  concerns  about  the  risk  of  human  trafficking  due  to \nincreased  vehicular  movement,  and  of  their  children,  especially  girls,  becoming  easy  targets.  A  separate  anti-\ntrafficking program will be required in the project area. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\nE.

Local \nnongovernment  organizations  will  undertake  an \nHIV/AIDS 20 prevention program, including information \ncampaigns, awareness raising, and other measures to \ncounter the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in \nthe project area. \n\nincluding \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n Yes \n No \n\n Yes \n No  \n\n Yes \n No \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\n                                                 \n20  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n53\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN (LALITPUR-SAGAR) \n\n \n1. \nThe sample subproject road begins at the end of Lalitpur bypass (kilometer [km] 94) and \nends at   km 198 of national highway (NH) 26. The project road is 104 km long, passing through \nLalitpur in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Sagar in Madhya Pradesh (MP). \n\n2. \nThe average right of way on NH26 is 35 meters (m) in the UP section (40 km) and 25 m \nin the MP section (64 km). Thus, more land has to be acquired to widen the road to a four- to \nsix-lane  dual  carriageway.  Five  village  bypasses  and  one  major  bypass  for  Sagar  will  require \nthe  acquisition  of  a  60  m-wide  strip  of  land.  Other  facilities  such  as  underpasses,  flyovers, \nservice roads, access roads, bus bays, truck parking, and toll plazas are proposed. \n\nA. \n\nPROJECT IMPACTS  \n\n3. \nLand Acquisition.  Efforts have been made to minimize displacement and disruption of \nlivelihoods.  Alternative  widening  options  were  considered  and  socially  viable  alignments \nfinalized for the settlement and sensitive areas, based on social impact assessments and public \nconsultations.  However,  an  estimated  390  hectares  (ha)  have  to  be  acquired  to  (i) widen the \nexisting right of way (about 265 ha); (ii) improve intersections and construct bypasses to avoid \ncongestion in urban stretches and reduce accidents at major intersections (about 134 ha); and \n(iii)  provide  rest  areas,  toll  plazas,  truck  terminals,  bus  bays,  and  utility  centers  (about  1  ha). \nDetails of these requirements will be determined after the designs have been finalized. \n \n4. \nType of Losses.  The  census  and  socioeconomic  survey  of  the  project-affected area \nenumerated  2,077  project-affected  households  (11,391  affected  people),  of  which  1,440  are \nagricultural landholders. Based on the census and socioeconomic surveys, a social profile has \nbeen  outlined  for  the  project  area.  The  census  survey  is  limited  to  non-titleholders. Titleholder \nstructures and the census results of landholders will be incorporated into the final report. Most \nstructures  are  owner  occupied.  Only  41  squatters  are  enumerated  in  the  corridor  of  impact \nbecause the project road avoids many settled areas. \n\nTable A18.1: Social Profile \n\nProperty \nResidential \n \n\nCommercial \n \n\nTotal Residential \n\nTotal Commercial \n\nDistrict \nLalitpur \nSagar \n \nLalitpur \nSagar \n \n\nOwner \n260 \n170 \n430 \n78 \n86 \n164 \n\nTenant \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1 \n4 \n5 \n\nSquatter \n2 \n2 \n4 \n21 \n20 \n41 \n\nTotal \n262 \n172 \n434 \n100 \n110 \n210 \n\n \nTable  A18.2: Type of Loss \n\nType of Loss \nResidential structure \nCommercial structure \nResidential cum commercial structure \nCommunity structure \nReligious structure \nGovernment structure \nOther private structurea \n\nTotal \n432 \n156 \n25 \n1 \n10 \n31 \n24 \n679 \na Includes boundary walls, foundations, abandoned structures, cattle sheds etc. \n\nLalitpur \n260 \n68 \n17 \n1 \n5 \n18 \n14 \n383 \n\nSagar \n172 \n88 \n8 \n0 \n5 \n13 \n10 \n296 \n\nTotal \n\nPercentage \n\n63.62 \n22.97 \n3.68 \n0.15 \n1.47 \n4.57 \n3.54 \n100.00 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nImpacts  on  Indigenous  and  Vulnerable  Groups.  Affected  people  belonging  to \n6. \nvulnerable  categories\u2014below  the  poverty  line,  scheduled  castes,  scheduled  tribes,  other \nbackward castes, and women-headed households are considered socially vulnerable and thus \nneed special consideration so that they can benefit from the Project. The titleholders and non-\ntitleholders  include  303  people  below  poverty  line,  38  members  of  scheduled  castes,  8 \nmembers of scheduled tribes, and 1 household headed by a physically handicapped person. \n\nTable A18.3: Socially Vulnerable Groups \n\nDistrict \n\nLalitpur \nSagar \n\nTotal \n\nVulnerable Group (household) \n\nSC \n22 \n16 \n38 \n\nST \n4 \n4 \n8 \n\nOBC \n123 \n55 \n178 \n\nWHH \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\nPHH \n1 \n0 \n1 \n\nBPL = below poverty line, OBC = other backward cast, PHH = physically handicapped headed household, SC = \nscheduled cast, ST = scheduled tribe, WHH = women-headed household. \na This includes some households from other categories, which are not presented in respective categories. \n\nBPLa \n169 \n134 \n303 \n\n \n\n7. \nThe scheduled tribe households affected by the Project are engaged in small business \nor  work  as  laborers.  They  migrated  from  Rajasthan  several  generations  ago  and  make  their \nliving  like  the  general  affected  population.  The  surveys  and  other  data  sources  show  that  the \nscheduled  tribe  population  directly  impacted  by  the  Project  is  similar  to  the  overall  population \nand assimilated into the local communities. The scheduled tribes share their sources of water, \nfolklore, food, infrastructure, and other belongings with the rest of the community. These groups \nare also open to new ideas such as family planning and formal education.  Most of these tribes \nhave a nuclear family norm. While scheduled tribes meet the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ndefinition  of  indigenous\u2014descended  from  a  specific  population  group\u2014they  do  not  maintain \ndistinct social or cultural identities, and freely interact with the mainstream population. \n\nGender Issues. Women\u2019s participation in economic activities is almost negligible. Most \n8. \nproject-affected  women  do  not  have  any  financial  decision-making power in their households, \nbut their opinion is sought for children\u2019s health care or day-to-day activities or social functions. \nThe project resettlement policy provides for women to be involved in sustainable development. \nParticipation  of  women  in  the  Project  is  envisaged  in  (i)  planning;  (ii)  ensuring  that \ncompensation  for  land  and  assets  is  the  same  for  all  affected  families;  (iii)  consulting  and \nparticipating  in  group  activities  to  gain  access  and  control  over  resources  as  a  part  of  the \nresettlement  plan;  and  (d)  issuing  identity  cards,  opening  bank  accounts,  and  receiving \ncompensation  payments.  The  entitlement  framework  considers  women-headed households as \nvulnerable and compensates and helps them.  \n\nResettlement Principles and Compensation  \n\nB. \n \n9. \nThe resettlement plan is based on the resettlement and rehabilitation framework adopted \nby  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  for  ADB-funded  projects,  complying  with \nADB  guidelines.  The  plan  aims  to  adequately  compensate  all  types  of  losses  and  impacts \nresulting  from  the  Project,  and  to  restore  and  improve  the  economic condition of the affected \npopulation.  The  entitlement  policy  recognizes  all  types  of  affected  people,  including  squatters, \nvulnerable  encroachers,  titleholders,  and  kiosk  owners.  All  squatters,  vulnerable  encroachers, \nand  kiosk  owners  present  before  the  cut-off  date  will  be  entitled  to  assistance.  Barring  kiosk \nowners,  others  will  be  paid  the  replacement  cost  for  structures,  and  shifting  and  transition \nallowances. Kiosk owners will receive a lump sum as a shifting allowance. Training will be given \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 18 \n\n55\n\nto people losing commercial activities. Titleholders losing structures will be paid to replace them, \nincluding the cost of homestead land and trees, and shifting and transition allowances. Affected \npeoples losing land will be paid to replace land lost, and a transitional allowance. Tenants will \nreceive  shifting  allowances,  rental  allowance,  deposits,  and  compensation  for  erected \nstructures,  if  any.  Material  can  be  salvaged  at  no  cost.  All  incidental  costs\u2014registration cost, \nstamp  duty,  etc.\u2014will  be  borne  by  the  Project.  It  will  rebuild  community  utilities  and \ninfrastructure that are to be dismantled. The policy also asserts an integrated income restoration \nstrategy for affected peoples losing their source of income. Vulnerable persons will get a one-\ntime  economic  rehabilitation  grant  to  establish  their  businesses  and  livelihood.  All  common \nproperty resources will be replaced before demolition of the old ones. Specific entitlements for \nthe  different  categories  of  losses  are  contained  in  the  entitlement  matrix  (Supplementary \nAppendix J). \n\nStakeholder Participation, Disclosure of the Resettlement Plan, and Grievances  \n\nC. \n \nPublic consultations were held with various sections of affected people such as traders, \n10. \nwomen,  village  elders,  panchayat  members,  government  officials,  and  local  voluntary \norganizations.21 These consultations will continue during project implementation. People in the \ncommunity  generally  agreed  that  the  highway  should  be  widened,  and  highly  appreciated  the \nconsultation.  Issues  related  to  safety,  compensation,  income  restoration,  job  creation, \nHIV/AIDS, trafficking of women, information flow, grievance redress, role of administration, etc. \nwere discussed. Transparency in project implementation was also raised. The resettlement plan \naddresses  all \ninstitutional-\nstrengthening  measures.  The  RP  has  been  disclosed  at  panchayats,  block  offices,  district \nmagistrates\u2019 offices, and project implementation units (PIUs), in English and Hindi. \n\nissues  raised  during  public  consultation  and  recommends \n\n11. \nAll  efforts  will  be  made  to  settle  affected  people\u2019s  grievances  as  amicably  as  possible. \nOut-of-court  settlement  is  preferred  since  this  expedites  dispute  settlement  and  helps  timely \nproject implementation. Grievance redress committees (GRCs) will be set up at the district level, \ncomprising  representatives  of  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  public  agencies \nrepresentatives; women\u2019s groups, squatters, and vulnerable affected peoples; line departments \nand  affected  people,  especially  women;  and  a  representative  of  the  respective  district \nadministrations. At least two people from each group will be in the GRC. Women will make up at \nleast  a  third  of  GRC  members.  Investigations  will  be  thorough  enough  to  satisfy  affected \npeoples. The GRC will meet quarterly or more frequently as required and respond a grievance \nin 15 days. It will continue to function during the entire life of the Project, including the defects \nliability  periods,  to  (i)  help  affected  peoples  solve  problems  arising  out  of  land  and  property \nacquisition; (ii) record the grievances, and categorize, prioritize, and solve them within a month; \n(iii)  inform  PIUs  of  serious  cases  within  an  appropriate  time  frame;  and  (iv)  report  to  the \naggrieved parties about progress on their grievances and the PIUs\u2019 decisions. \n\nRelocation Site Development and Rehabilitation Assistance \n\nD. \n \n12. \nRequirements for relocating affected people will be known only after the census surveys \nare  completed.  The  final  RP  will  include  more  details  on  this.  Displaced  titleholders  and \nsquatters losing residential and commercial properties may opt for resettlement sites, preferably \nclose to where they lived before the Project. The RP provides residential plots of all squatters, \nwho may choose self-relocation with compensation and related assistance. PIUs and NGOs will \ndetermine  if  each  household  can  find  replacement  land  for  a  dwelling,  and,  if  the  household \n                                                 \n21 A panchayat means a local government body, lower than a village. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\ncannot, NHAI will provide the land. Relocation sites will be selected in consultation with affected \nfamilies  and  panchayat  members.  All  identified  land  will  be  free  of  encroachment  and  other \nencumbrances.  NGOs  will  explore  the  possibility  of  land  for  resettlement  sites.  As  most \ndisplaced  affected  peoples  have  opted  for  cash  compensation  and  self-relocation,  they  will \nreceive support from the Project during relocation and also receive compensation for structures, \nand  shifting  and  income  assistance.  Wherever  resettlement  sites  are  developed,  additional \nsupport will be provided, including civic amenities such as wells, tube wells for drinking water, \nsanitary  facilities,  and  community  halls  to  facilitate  resettler-host  relationships.  If  a  group  has \nalready identified a potential site, NGOs will visit it along with community representatives to see \nif  it  is  adequate  and  suitable,  and  collect  information  on  its  title  and  availability  from  the  local \nrevenue department.  \n\nImplementation Framework and Budget \n\nE. \n \n13. \nNHAI\u2019s environment and social development unit (ESDU) will coordinate and supervise \nresettlement. Resettlement  and  rehabilitation  cells  will  be  established  under  PIUs.  Each  PIU, \nheaded  by  a  project  director  or  a  project  manager,  will  be  supported  by  a  manager  for \nresettlement and environmental issues. Experienced NGOs (one per package) will be engaged \nto  implement  resettlement  activities  and  coordinate  with  other  relevant  departments  and \nstakeholders  in  the  Project.  The  NGOs  will  also  organize  and  conduct  training  programs, \nconduct  awareness  campaigns,  verify  affected  peoples  and  their  assets,  and  help  settle \ndisputes.  At  the  district  level  GRCs  will  help  the  PIU  resolve  disputes  and  implement  the \nresettlement plan. Additional staff for resettlement will be provided as necessary to improve the \nESDU\u2019s capacity.  \n\nResettlement  will  take  40  months,  including  planning,  surveying,  assessing,  policy \n15. \ndevelopment,  institution  identification,  affected  people\u2019s  participation,  income  restoration,  and \nother  resettlement  activities.  For  each  section,  compensation  for  acquired  assets  will  be  paid \nbefore construction begins, and resettlement sites built before people are relocated. \n\n16. \nThe  resettlement  budget  of  Rs.360  million  covers  (i)  compensation  (62.7%),  (ii) \nsupplementary assistance (21.0%), (iii) replacement of common property resources (6.0%), (iv) \nresettlement implementation support (6.8%), and (v) contingencies (3.5%).  \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nF. \n \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  will  be  in  place  as  specified  in  the  resettlement  plan. \n17. \nThe  PIU  will  carry  out  internal  monitoring,  while  an  external  monitoring  agency  (EMA)  will \nconduct  third-party  monitoring  and  midterm  and  end-term  evaluation.  The  EMA  will  submit \nperiodic  progress  reports  to  NHAI,  which  will  then  submit  them  to  ADB  in  the  first  year  of \nmonitoring, after which the EMA will submit quarterly reports. The EMA will carry out a midterm \nevaluation  based  on  a  25%  sample  of  affected  peoples,  covering  titleholders  and  non-\ntitleholders, at the end of eighteenth month of the contract. At the end of the third year, end-line \nevaluation  will  be  carried  out.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  formats  are  given  in the resettlement \nplan. \n\nG. \n\nEntitlement Matrix \n\nThe  entitlement  matrix  describes  the  principles  and  approach  to  be  followed  in \n18. \ncompensating  affected  people.  The  matrix  (Supplementary  Appendix  J)  has  been  developed \nbased on NHAI and ADB guidelines on involuntary resettlement. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 November 2004) \n", "Currency Unit \nRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \n \n$0.0221 \n \nRs45.15 \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nBOT \nCAG \nEIRR \nEMA \nESDU \nGDP \nGM \nGRC \nICB \nIEC \nIEE \nJBIC \nLIBOR \nMSRTH \nNACO \nNGO \nNH \nNHAI \nNHDP \nO&M \nPIR \nPIU \nPPP \nPSP \nPV \nQCBS \nRFP \nRFQ \nSOE \nSPV \nSRTU \nTA \nVOC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nbuild-operate-transfer \nComptroller and Auditor General of India \neconomic internal rate of return \nexternal monitoring agency \nenvironment and social development unit \ngross domestic product \ngeneral manager \ngrievance redress committee \ninternational competitive bidding \ninformation, education, and communication \ninitial environmental examination \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMinistry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways \nNational Acquired-immunodeficiency-syndrome Control Organization \nnongovernment organization \nnational highway \nNational Highways Authority of India \nNational Highways Development Program \noperation and maintenance \npoverty impact ratio  \nproject implementation unit \npublic-private partnership \nprivate sector participation \npresent value \nquality- and cost-based selection  \nrequest for proposals \nrequest for qualification \nstatement of expenditure \nspecial-purpose vehicle \nstate road transport undertaking \ntechnical assistance \nvehicle operating cost \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 March. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by A.
