It will help to improve access to and quality of\nessential preventive, promotive and curative health services at village,\nhealth center and district levels in 34 underdeveloped districts with 0.9\nmillion people; and improve referral services for 1.7 million people. The\nProject will also strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of\nHealth (MOH) and all provinces in the Lao PDR to develop PHC.\nClassification: Primary: Poverty Reduction\nSecondary: Gender and Development\nEnvironmental Environmental category: C\nAssessment:\nEnvironmental implications were reviewed and no adverse environmental\nimpacts were identified.\nRationale: Rationale\nWith a per capita income of $283 and half of the population living in\npoverty, Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in the Asia and Pacific\nRegion.  The  rural  poor,  in  particular  women  and  children,  ethnic\nminorities and other vulnerable groups living in the inaccessible northern\nhills, suffer from extremely poor health. Life expectancy of only 53 years\nis the lowest in the region. Most sickness and deaths are from common\ncommunicable diseases such as malaria, acute respiratory infections,\ndiarrhea and measles, most of which are preventable or easily curable.\nMaternal and infant mortality and fertility are among the highest in the\nregion, yet reproductive health services are not readily available. The\nexisting network of health facilities has inadequate coverage and mainly\nprovides  a  limited  range  of  curative  services  of  often  sub-standard\nquality. As much as half of the rural population do not have access to\npreventive and promotive services and first referral care, in particular in\nthe northern hills.\nThe Government, as a cornerstone  of  its  social policy,  accords high\npriority to the improvement of the health status of the population. PHC\nhas been identified as the most cost-effective approach to provide basic\nhealth services. The Government recently approved a PHC policy that\naims to make a basic package of health care available to the entire\npopulation, and restructured MOH in support of PHC. The Government\nhas  requested  ADB  to  support  expansion  and  improvement  of  PHC\ndelivery,  strengthen  PHC  planning  and  management,  and  develop\neffective financing  mechanisms.  The  Project  is  specially  designed  to\nimprove the health status of women and children, ethnic minorities and\nthe rural poor.", "iii\nObjectives and The Project will contribute to the Government\u2019s goals of improving the\nScope: health status and reduce poverty of the population of Lao PDR. The\nProject  will  improve  PHC  for  the  rural  poor  by  (i) expanding  and\nimproving the quality of PHC in the northern region, and (ii) strengthening\nthe institutional capacity for PHC.\nThe Project will target women and children, ethnic minorities and the rural\npoor  by  (i)  increasing  their  physical,  social  and  financial  access  to\nessential services, (ii) focussing on interventions and diseases that affect\nthem disproportionally, and (iii) improving the quality of services for these\ngroups.  The  Project  will  give  priority  to  cost-effective  interventions\nbenefiting women and children including health promotion, reproductive\nhealth  care,  the prevention  and treatment of  common  infections  and\nmicronutrient deficiencies, and first referral services.\nComponent  1  will  develop  PHC  in  the  northern  provinces  by\n(i) increasing  access  to  PHC  at  health  center  and  village  levels;\n(ii) improving the quality of PHC including training of ethnic minorities\nstaff, (iii) strengthening reproductive health services, and (iv) supporting\nvillage health care and promotion.\nComponent  2  will  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  for  PHC\nnationwide  by  (i)  strengthening  PHC  coordination,  (ii) standardizing\nmanagement  systems,  (iii)  supporting  staff  development  for  PHC\nmanagement, and (iv) testing innovative financing approaches.\nCost Estimates: The total cost of the Project including physical and price contingencies,\nand interest charges during implementation is estimated at $25 million\nequivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $10.7  million\nequivalent  (43  percent)  and  local  currency  cost  of  $14.3  million\nequivalent (57 percent).\nFinancing Plan: ($ million)\n                                Foreign             Local             Total\nSource                  Exchange        Currency           Cost            Percent\nADB 10.7 9.3 20.0 80\nGovernment 0.0 5.0 5.0 20\nTotal 10.7 14.3 25.0 100\nLoan Amount and The equivalent of SDR14,956,000 ($20 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s\nTerms: Special Fund.

The central Project\nManagement Office will be located in the PHC and Rural Development\nDivision of the Cabinet. The Director of this Division, who is responsible\nfor planning, coordination, and monitoring PHC in the country, will be the\nProject Director. There will be steering committees in all the provinces\nconsisting of representatives of the provincial health service, the planning\nand  budgeting  department,  and  beneficiaries.  There  will  be  eight\nprovincial  Project  Implementation  Offices  to  assist  the  Project\nManagement Office in implementing component 1. Component 2 will be\nmanaged centrally.\nProcurement: All ADB-financed procurement for the Project will be in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Related equipment and material will\nbe combined into packages to simplify procurement. Supply contracts\ncosting more than $500,000 will be procured by international competitive\nbidding procedures. Supply contracts at $500,000 equivalent or less will\nfollow international shopping procedures, except for some equipment and\nsupplies like hostel beds and furniture, that are locally manufactured and\nunlikely to attract foreign suppliers. These will be procured through local\ncompetitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures\nacceptable to ADB. Packages of less than $100,000 may be procured on\na direct purchase basis. Equipment and materials required at provincial\nlevel and costing less than $10,000 may be procured by the Project\nImplementation Office according to Government procedures acceptable\nto ADB.\nThe  Project  includes  construction  of  41  health  centers  and  seven\nhospitals;  and  renovation  or  upgrading  of  six  health  centers  and  17\nhospitals.  The  health  facilities  are  located  in  remote  and  scattered\nlocations and are unlikely  to  attract  international bidders.  Civil  works\ncontracts  will  be  awarded  according  to  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. However, if any package is estimated to\ncost $1.0 million or more, international competitive bidding procedures\nwill be followed.\nConsulting Services: All consultants financed under the loan will be selected and engaged in\naccordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  on  the  recruitment  of  domestic\nconsultants. Six international and six domestic individual consultants and\none domestic firms will be provided. The international consultants will\ninclude  chief  technical  adviser  (36  person-months),  education  and\ntraining specialist (6 person-months), management specialist (12 person-\nmonths),  health  sector  financing  specialist  (6  person-months),\nprocurement  specialist  (6  person-months)  and  architect  (6  person-\nmonths).

The  Project  will focus  on  reducing  poverty  by\nmeeting the health and birth spacing needs of the rural poor. This will be\ndone by placing new health facilities near large pockets of in particular\nunderserved ethnic minorities, by training local people to make services\nmore accessible and acceptable, by focussing on reproductive health\nservices for women and children, and by reducing the cost of health\nservices for the poor. The Project will primarily benefit a population of 0.9\nmillion people in 34 out of 61 districts, and improve referral services for\n1.7 million people in the eight northern provinces. About 60 percent of the\npopulation is estimated to live below the poverty line in the targeted\nnorthern  provinces.

PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan to\nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Primary Health Care Expansion Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has developed a\nprimary health care (PHC) policy1 to improve the health of its citizens based on the concepts of\nparticipation, equity, and sustainability. The Government has received Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) support for a PHC project2 in 2 of 18 provinces3 in the Lao PDR, and has requested support\nfor (i) expanding PHC to the entire northern region, and (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity\nfor PHC management nationwide. Project preparatory technical assistance (TA)4 for the PHC\nExpansion Project was approved in May 1998, and implemented between February and December\n1999. The Bank undertook Fact-finding from 17 January to 5 February 2000 and Appraisal from 24\nApril  to  12  May  2000.  Throughout  the  Project  preparation  and  appraisal,  there  was  close\nconsultation and coordination with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other ministries; Government\nofficials at provincial and district levels; multilateral and bilateral funding agencies; nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs);  health  workers;  community  representatives;  and  potential  beneficiaries\nincluding people from ethnic minorities. This report is based on Government inputs, the TA report,\nand Fact-finding and Appraisal Missions. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. Economic and Social Context\n3. Lao PDR is a hilly and forested country located centrally in the Greater Mekong Region. It\nhas a low population density of 21 persons per square kilometer, a population of about 5.2 million\nand a population growth rate of about 2.5 percent per year.5 Based on a recent ADB analysis of the\nLao Expenditure and Consumption Surveys of 1992-93 and 1997-98, the poverty incidence may\nhave declined from 63 percent poor and 41 percent very poor in 1992-93 to 47 percent poor and\n25 percent very poor in 1997-98.6 While the 1997 economic crisis spurred the economy in the Lao\nPDR, the average per capita income has been declining due to inflation and is currently estimated\nat $283 per year. The poorest provinces are in the northern region, with an estimated 62 percent\npoor and 38 percent very poor in 1997-98. This analysis also found that the 16 percent reduction in\npoor people was due to 23 percent growth less 7 percent increase in inequality. The increase in\nconsumption in the lowest quintile was small, suggesting that economic growth had less impact on\nthe very poor. The Government is addressing poverty through gradual economic reforms, social\nservices development, and investment in priority infrastructure such as roads and hydropower.\nWhile long-term prospects for the country\u2019s economy are favorable, the Government is currently\nfacing a serious financial crisis.\n4. The 85 percent of the rural population comprises some 47 distinct ethnic groups. The ethnic\nLao  constitute  about  half  the population,  and engage  in  agriculture,  fishing,  and  commercial\nactivities in the fertile lowlands of the Mekong and its tributaries. The ethnic minorities mainly live in\nthe hills, where infrastructure is underdeveloped and access to services is poor, particularly in the\n                                                       \n1  Ministry of Health (MOH).

The hill tribes are mainly subsistence farmers with occasional cash crops, who, in\naddition, exploit the abundant forests. The highland provinces in the north score lowest in terms of\nper capita income, and the northern region accounts for 30 percent of the poor in the Lao PDR. Per\nthe 1995 census, the literacy rate among the Lao and other Tai-Kadai was 70 percent, the Mon-\nKhmer 38 percent, the Hmong 27 percent, and the Tibeto-Burman 4 percent. Gender differences\nare more apparent among the ethnic minorities. The literacy rate for Mon-Khmer females is 20\npercent, and for Hmong females 9 percent. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\nhuman development report for 1998 ranks the Lao PDR 136th of 175 countries.\n2. Health Status\n5. Compared with other countries in the region, mortality and fertility in the Lao PDR are high.\nThe 1995 population census reported a child mortality rate (children less than five years of age) of\n170 per 1,000 live births. The Government estimates that the infant mortality rate has declined\nfrom 104 to 85 infant deaths per 1,000 live births since 1995 (footnote 5), and the maternal\nmortality ratio from 656 to 490 per 100,000 live births since 1993.7 Only Cambodia has higher\nreported infant and maternal mortality rates, and the life expectancy of 53 years at birth is the\nlowest in the Mekong region. The three geographical regions in the Lao PDR (north, central, and\nsouth) have significant disparities in health status. The north has the highest infant, child, and\nmaternal mortality; and the lowest life expectancy and literacy rates, according to UNDP data. The\ntotal fertility rate is estimated to have declined from 5.6 to 4.5 children per woman since 1995,\nwhich is still high.8 The immediate causes of high mortality seen in the Lao PDR are typical for a\ncountry before the transition from high to low fertility and communicable to welfare diseases. High\nlevels of fertility place women at increased risk of maternal morbidity, disability, and mortality,\nespecially in case of early pregnancy, short birth intervals, high parity, malnutrition, illness, and lack\nof routine and emergency obstetric care, all of which are common problems in the Lao PDR.\n6. Common causes of mortality among children are preventable or easily curable conditions\nsuch as malaria, respiratory and intestinal infections, and complications of childbirth. Malaria is a\nserious health problem with an estimated 1.4 million cases and 14,000 deaths per year, with young\nchildren  and  pregnant  and  breast  feeding  mothers  most  at  risk  from  malaria.9  Respiratory\ninfections and diarrheal diseases cause respectively 5,500 and 4,000 deaths annually of children\nunder five years. The risk of infection is exacerbated by undernutrition. Nearly one third of Lao\nhouseholds experience insufficient food intake, with women and children suffering most. About 20\npercent of babies  born alive have  low  birth  weight  (below  2.5 kg.),  in part due to  maternal\nmalnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. An estimated 41 percent of children under the age of\nfive years suffer from undernutrition; and 12 percent are severely malnourished (footnote 9).\n7. Among adults, infections and pregnancy complications are major public health problems.\nObstetrical complications during delivery are common, averaging about 10 percent of all deliveries,\nand are most frequent in the remote northern provinces. The Lao Social Indicator Survey in 1993\nfound that three-fourths of maternal deaths occur within six weeks of delivery, and one-fourth occur\nduring pregnancy (footnote 7). Deaths during pregnancy result from complications of induced\nabortion (28 percent); infectious diseases including malaria (25 percent); and other problems such\nas hemorrhage, abnormal presentation, and spontaneous abortion (22 percent). Tuberculosis is\nalso a major public health problem and common cause of death. The population is also facing an\nHIV/AIDS  epidemic  as  international  travel  is  increasing.  According  to  the  Committee  for  the\nPrevention of AIDS, out of 47,762 patients tested up to December 1999, 367 were found to be HIV-\n                                                       \n7\nPhimmasone K., et. al..

Surveys, routine\nblood screening, and behavioral surveillance are not yet done. Key indicators are in Appendix 2.\n3. Health Sector Organization\n8. The Lao PDR is divided into 3 regions, 18 provinces (including Xaysombaun Special Zone\nand Vientiane Municipality), and 141 districts. Provinces vary in size from about 70,000 to 700,000\npeople and have 5 to 12 districts, with 10,000 to 100,000 people per district. MOH is at the apex of\na public health system of provincial and district hospitals, and health centers at the subdistrict level.\n9. MOH is responsible for health sector planning, policy development, coordination, external\nfinancing, and evaluation. It was recently reorganized and contains seven departments: (i) Cabinet,\n(ii) Human Resources, (iii) Inspection, (iv) Planning and Budgeting, (v) Curative, (vi) Hygiene and\nPrevention, and (vii) Food and Drug. The Inspection and Planning and Budgeting departments\nwere introduced recently. The new structure includes the MOH Steering Committee for Monitoring\nInternational  Assistance,  composed  of  the  minister  and  vice-ministers  and  directors  of  all\ndepartments. The PHC and Rural Development Division was recently established in the Cabinet to\ncoordinate PHC projects and foreign assistance for PHC (para. 29). At least 12 vertical programs\nare managed by technical institutes and MOH departments, including programs for (i) pediatric\ninfectious diseases, (ii) malaria control, (iii) control of diarrheal diseases, (iv) control of acute\nrespiratory  infections,  (v) reproductive health,  (vi) micronutrient  deficiencies  and  breastfeeding,\n(vii) control  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  (viii) essential  drugs  supply,\n(ix) primary eye care, (x) tuberculosis control, (xi) schistosomiasis control, and (xii) water supply\nand sanitation.\n10. The provincial health office has administrative and technical responsibility for all health\nservices in the province, including the provincial and district hospitals, the network of primary care\nfacilities, implementation of vertical programs, and private sector regulation and inspection. The\norganization and resources of health services vary significantly among provinces. The provincial\nhospital provides general referral services including emergency care and surgery. The provincial\nhealth system in the Lao PDR is similar to a district health system by World Health Organization\n(WHO) standards. Due to the basic level of services and training capacity at the provincial level,\nthe Government plans to strengthen the three regional centers to provide advanced training and\nspecialist referral services such as eye and ear surgery, orthopedics, and gynecology.\n11. The district health office is responsible for coordinating health services in the district. The\ndistrict hospital is comparable to a health center in many other countries, providing outpatient care,\nbasic inpatient care with 10-15 beds, a maternal and child health (MCH) clinic, outreach services,\nand logistic support and supervision of services in the district. Each district has 50-100 villages.\nBecause  access  to  many  villages  is difficult,  MOH  has begun  constructing  subdistrict  health\ncenters serving clusters of villages. These are  staffed by nurse  auxiliaries and  sometimes  a\nmedical assistant to provide basic curative care, mother and child care, and supervision of village\nhealth workers. The geographic coverage of public health services is less than half the population.\n12. Based on the TA, 33 percent of the population, when ill, first seeks care from the private or\ninformal sector, compared with 28 percent visiting a government facility first (footnote 4). The\ninformal sector includes drug sellers, birth attendants, traditional healers, and herbalists. There are\nalso many  retired  nurse auxiliaries  previously  supported by  the  agricultural  cooperatives that\ncovered nearly the entire country. These village health care providers (VHPs) are an important\nsource of curative care for the villagers.\n4. Primary Health Care\n13. Following  liberation  in  1975,  basic  health  care  coverage  was  achieved  through  the\ncommune system. After the New Economic Mechanism was adopted in 1989, introducing reforms", "4\ntoward a market economy, the commune system collapsed and funding for health centers dried up,\nresulting in a dramatic decrease in access to basic health care. MOH responded by setting up\ntechnical institutes to implement selective health interventions through vertical programs. At the\nsame time, MOH started rebuilding its network of district hospitals and health centers to develop\nPHC.  Many  small  projects  resulted  in  a  wide  variety  of  PHC  delivery  strategies  with  little\nstandardization,  reflecting preferences of external  funding  agencies.  The  result  is  an  uneven\ndistribution of externally assisted districts adjacent to districts with virtually no PHC support. Since\nthe 1990s, MOH has been making efforts to increase PHC coverage with large-scale projects.\nCurrently, systematic efforts are being made in 7 provinces to increase PHC coverage with the\nhelp of external funding. However, in the remaining 11 provinces, PHC delivery essentially is a\nholdover from the past, and none of the provinces have achieved adequate PHC coverage, in\nparticular affecting ethnic minority populations.\n14. The  vertical  programs  for  health  education,  malaria  control,  rural  water  supply,\nimmunization,  and  reproductive  health  have  not  succeeded  in  reaching  a  large  part  of  the\npopulation due to lack of local ownership, irregularity of services, and operational and resource\nconstraints. The malaria control program effectively reached 24 percent of villages, and half the\npopulation  have  access to  clean  water.  Only  32  percent  of  children  12-23  months  are  fully\nimmunized. Of women of reproductive age, half are fully immunized with tetanus toxoid. Among\nmarried couples of reproductive age, 23 percent use modern contraceptives, compared with 64\npercent  wanting  to  space  births  or  avoid  more  pregnancies.  However,  knowledge  about\ncontraceptive methods is low. In the household survey in 11 provinces, only 33 percent of married\nwomen aged 15-49 could name at least one modern contraceptive method (footnote 4).\n15. Outpatient services in public health facilities are underused due to poor quality of care,\nlimited range of services, and lack of drugs. Each health center has on average 10 outpatients per\nday. There are 68 consultations per 1,000 population per year at district level and 214 at provincial\nlevel. A district hospital will admit on average 450 people per year and a provincial hospital 2,300.\nThe bed occupancy rate at district and provincial levels is about 40 percent. Surgical operations\nand deliveries performed in hospitals are still low (footnote 7). Surgical services are limited to\nprovincial hospitals and few district hospitals, as most district hospitals do not have the staff,\noperating funds, and patient volume to sustain these services. Most health centers perform poorly\nin MCH and birth spacing services. Health education and growth monitoring are usually not done.\nImmunization is provided on an outreach basis only once a year. About 72 percent of mothers\ndeliver at home, 7 percent in a hospital, and only 16 percent deliver with the help of a trained\nmedical practitioner. Despite high demand,  birth  spacing  services are not  available  in  health\ncenters and at the village level that would be more accessible to women. Tuberculosis affects the\npoor disproportionately. However, diagnosis and treatment for the disease are only available at\nprovincial level, making it difficult for the rural poor to access these services.\n5. Health Sector Financing\n16. Government spending in the health sector has been increasing in real terms since the early\n1990s to 1997/98, following which it decreased in real terms as nominal increases did not keep up\nwith inflation. Public health spending as a share of total Government spending has declined since\nthen  from  about  3  to  2  percent,  while  public  sector  funding  from  other  sources  increased.\nAccording to 1997/98 data, the Government allocated the equivalent of $6.4 million to the health\nsector, or 0.36 percent of gross domestic product. Total expenditures on health from both public\nand private sources including for external sources amounted to $55.8 million; about 3.2 percent of\ngross domestic product or $11.50 per capita. Households financed the major share, 58.1 percent\nof total expenditures, or $6.70 per person per year, mainly for medicines. External  agencies\n(including NGOs) financed 30.4 percent. The Government contributed 11.5 percent or $1.3 per\nperson per year.", "5\n17. User fees were introduced in 1995 via the Prime Minister\u2019s Decree (PMD) 52, primarily to\novercome the chronic drug shortage in public facilities. User fees for hospital services relate to (i)\nthe sale of drugs (77 percent), (ii) fees for treatment (10 percent), (iii) diagnostic tests (9 percent),\nand (iv) other fees (4 percent). To contain costs at the health center level, PMD 52 only permits\ncollection of fees for drugs but not for services. Fifty eight percent of patients at national and\nprovincial hospitals are eligible for free or subsidized services. These include civil servants (who\nmake an indirect contribution through social security payments), students, and monks. Poor people\nare also provided subsidized services in hospitals. About 40 percent of patients receive subsidized\nservices in district hospitals, and in health centers this is even less (as discussed in para. 31). The\npoorest household quartile was spending on average $2.4 on health care per month, compared to\n$4.2 by the second quartile, $5 for the third quartile, and $5.5 for the wealthiest group. While the\npoor are more likely to capture subsidized services, the low expenditure for the poor may also\nsuggests that they use health services less.\n18. Data collected for hospitals indicates that revenue from user fees is not only substituting for\nlower levels of government funding, but is adding real resources for the operations of these\nfacilities. User fees for drugs contribute 39 percent of the operational budget of district hospitals,10\nexcluding salaries. So far there is no evidence that the introduction of user charges has had a\ndetrimental effect on overall use of hospitals. On the contrary, patient attendance tends to increase\nfollowing introduction of a revolving drug fund, and this pattern is found across ethnic groups. In\nPak Ou hospital, utilization rates for disadvantaged ethnic groups, women, and children increased.\nAfter  introducing  user fees. When  the  distance of the  villages from  the  district  hospital  was\nadjusted, the finding indicates that access and quality of care are more important determinants of\nutilization than ethnic group or income. Only civil servants, which had received free care before the\nintroduction of the revolving drug fund, used services less.\n6. Key Issues\n19. PHC  delivery  by  programs  and  services  is  handicapped  by  the  country\u2019s  poor\ncommunication network, the remoteness of its villages, the multiethnic society, the difficult working\nconditions  of  the  civil  servants,  weak  staff  training,  and  financial  constraints.  These  factors\ncontribute to poor access to PHC, unsatisfactory quality of care, unavailability of reproductive\nhealth services, low utilization of services by ethnic minorities, limited PHC management capacity,\nand low salaries and inadequate operational funds for PHC.\nLimited Access to PHC\n20. The network of PHC facilities is unevenly distributed, reflecting the pattern of external\nsupport. Many villages are more than half a day\u2019s travel from the nearest health facility, and more\nthan a day\u2019s travel from emergency services. Poor people are reluctant to spend time traveling for\nmedical attention as they loose time to work for food. The study of specific utilization rates per\ncommune in Pakkading district hospital11 shows that the rate is directly linked to the distance,\ntransportation  possibilities,  and  access  to  other  services.  The  pattern  is  the  same  for\nhospitalization in Vangvieng hospital12 where 60 percent of inpatients live near the hospital.\n21. The  northern  region  is  mountainous  and  inaccessible,  and  health  education  and\nimmunization coverage of the population in this region is low, in particular among ethnic minorities.\nAccess to PHC is irregular and unsystematic, especially in Bokeo, Houaphan, Louang Namtha,\nand Phongsali provinces. More than 60 percent of the population in these four provinces have no\n                                                       \n10 Dalaloy, P., Minister of Health.

These provinces scored lowest on indicators of PHC service delivery and\npreventive health service outcomes. Of 11 provinces surveyed during the TA (footnote 4), only 32\nof 85 districts have satisfactory PHC coverage. For example, in Phongsali Province, only 11\npercent of villages are within one hour\u2019s travel of a public health facility, and 46 percent within four\nhours of a hospital. An estimate of health personnel productivity in a district hospital13 showed\nproductivity of only 25 percent of capacity. Therefore, adding health centers to increase access\nwould not require a net increase in staff.\nInadequate Quality of Care\n22. Demand for services depends on the quality of care, which to a large extent is determined\nby the availability of skilled staff and medicines. A generic problem in the public health system is\nthe poor skills of health personnel. A survey among health personnel working at district hospitals in\nXieng Khouang and Oudomxai revealed that many health workers were unable to diagnose and\ntreat common diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections according to the\nWHO guidelines used in the Lao PDR (footnote 2). Medical personnel lack guidelines to diagnose\nand treat common illnesses effectively, and supervision is either not done or erratic. In addition,\nGovernment salaries are so low that most staff can ill afford to work full time in a health facility, or\nbe posted to a remote health centers where they cannot earn an additional income. Health centers\nare staffed mostly by less qualified staff whose training has not adequately prepared them for\nclinical or managerial responsibilities. Therefore, new facilities need to be placed strategically to\ntake  into  account  the  socioeconomic  constraints  of  staff,  and  adequate  compensation  and\nincentives should be provided, in particular for staff working in remote locations.\n23. Medicines and birth spacing commodities are in short supply due to funding, procurement\nand distribution constraints. The introduction of user charges has improved the availability of drugs\nfor hospital patients. However, the Government budget to subsidize drugs has remained small.\nProcurement and distribution constraints have made the availability of medicines very irregular. In\ngeneral, the hilly terrain, scattered population, and poor infrastructure makes it more difficult to\noperate  remote  health  facilities  and  provide  quality  services.  This  needs  to  be  taken  into\nconsideration when planning the extension of the network of health services.\nLack of Reproductive Health Services\n24. Maternal morbidity, mortality and disability are unacceptably high, and there is a large\nunmet demand for birth spacing. In addition, there are increasing risks of an HIV/AIDS epidemic for\nwhich the population is ill prepared. The provinces are trying to address the gap in reproductive\nhealth  services  by  operating  a  separate  program  in  each  province  managed  by  a  team  of\nprofessional and dedicated staff. In addition, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities\n(UNFPA) and other external agencies support MOH to strengthen the reproductive health program.\n25. However, at the health center  level  services  are  mostly  curative,  and  MCH  and birth\nspacing services are generally not available or are provided irregularly at limited hours. Reasons\ninclude lack of trained staff, equipment, and supplies. Also at first referral level, the facilities for\nroutine delivery and emergency obstetric care are highly inadequate, lacking all kinds of equipment\nand supplies. In addition, the operating budget for MCH and birth spacing services is inadequate\nso that staff training, supervision, and campaigns are severely restricted. For example, in Louang\nNamtha Province the entire operating budget for the MCH team was estimated at $450 per month.\nThese are compelling arguments to support expanding MCH services and improve its financing.\n                                                       \n13Noel, A. Pakkading, Experi\u00e9nce de Recouvrement des Co\u00fbts dans un H\u00f4spital de District au Laos. CCL. 1992.\nVientiane.", "7\nLow Use of Health Services by Ethnic Minorities\n26. Specific factors affect low use of health services by ethnic minorities. First, the geographical\ndistribution of health facilities affects the use of health services by ethnic minorities. The ethnic\nminorities more often live in scattered hamlets in remote and mountainous areas that have very\npoor infrastructure and that are only accessible in the dry season. It is very difficult and expensive\nto provide health services in these areas. While the majority ethnic group mostly  live  in the\nlowlands, the ethnic minorities mainly live on the slopes such as Mon-Khmer, and top of the hills\nsuch as the Hmong and the very poor Tibeto-Burman groups. They need certain essential services\nthat are often not in the standard package of health centers, such as iodine supplementation and\ntuberculosis  treatment.  Ethnic  groups  living  in  remote  areas  may  also  not  know  about  the\navailability of modern health services, or not have the time and energy to seek treatment a day\u2019s\nwalk or more from their home, requiring them to sleep overnight at the health center.\n27. Also where health services are accessible, use by ethnic minorities may still be low. In\naddition to concerns about the appropriateness of the health services, they often cite poverty as a\nreason for not seeking medical treatment, or fear they will not be able to pay for the services. Most\nethnic minorities subsist on shifting cultivation, hunting, and collecting forest products. Less than\n10 percent are engaged in commercial activities, and households often do not have cash or goods\nto pay for transport, consultation, and any medicines required. Sociocultural factors may also affect\nutilization of health services. An important factor is language, as more than 85 percent of minority\nfemales do not speak Lao, while less than 5 percent of health workers come from an ethnic\nminority  background.  Ethnic  groups  also  rely  on  spiritual  healing,  particularly  where  modern\ntreatment is unavailable. The differences in views between staff and ethnic minorities may also\naffect the relationship. Accordingly, it is important to train local people as health staff. Most villages\nhave  at  least  one  private-sector  VHP,  who  may  be  a  medical  practitioner,  birth  attendant,\ntraditional healer or volunteer from the community. While VHPs are locally accepted as health care\nproviders, their practices are unregulated, their skills questionable, and their supplies limited. They\nusually do not provide preventive and promotive services. There are many possible causes of low\nuse by ethnic minorities, and each situation should be assessed separately.\nWeak PHC Management Capacity\n28.  The PHC management system is in its infancy and PHC management capacity is limited.\nUntil recently, MOH did not have an organizational entity empowered to coordinate PHC services,\nprograms, and projects funded by external agencies. Many projects followed their own design from\nwhich much has been learned, but the projects are difficult to coordinate and monitor. More than\nhalf the managers have not been trained in public health management. Essential management\nsystems, such as for planning, monitoring, and supervision are not available or not being used for\ndecision making by the managers, as these are often complex or irrelevant. Weak management\ncapacity has resulted in inadequate coordination, standardization, monitoring, and comparability;\nand management is essentially reactive.\n29. When MOH was reorganized under PMD 20 in 1999, the MOH Steering Committee for the\nSupervision  of  International  Cooperation  was  created  (para.  9)  under  the  supervision  of  the\nMinister of Health. It is empowered to make strategic policy decisions for the health sector. A PHC\nand Rural Development Division has been created in the Cabinet to coordinate the national PHC\nprogram,  including  planning,  coordination  of  external  assistance,  monitoring  and  evaluation.\nProvincial PHC coordination units will be established in all provincial health offices. This will be the\nfirst time that distinct organizational units will be in place to coordinate PHC activities.\nInsufficient Financing of PHC\n30. The $11.50 per capita spending on all curative and preventive health care in the Lao PDR\nfalls well short of the estimated $15.00 per capita required to provide essential PHC services", "8\nalone.14  Government  financing  of  health  care  in  the  Lao  PDR  through  direct  subsidies  has\nincreased since the early 1990s in nominal terms. However, inflation has decreased the real\npurchasing power of these increases, and the level of real Government subsidies has decreased.\n31. Following PMD 52, fees are charged for drugs, treatment, laboratory tests, x-rays, hospital\nrooms, medical supplies, and documents. The fees cover supplies only, with a mark-up of about 25\npercent for management, transport, and pilferage. Other variable and fixed costs of providing the\nservice are not included in the price, and the prices charged for services in hospitals have not kept\nup with inflation. Prices that do not sufficiently offset these costs result in PHC services that are not\nsustainable, and do not allow savings for cross-subsidization. PMD 52 also provides that 20\npercent of fees collected for services are passed on to the central Government. This \u201ctax\u201d could be\nused for cross-subsidy among provinces and monitoring of revenue, but should preferably be\nretained locally.\n32. Although the Government is committed to affordable health services for all, it is increasingly\ndepending on the public to pay for health services. However, the poor may not be able to fully pay\nfor inpatient services and procedures such as caesarian sections for catastrophic illnesses, and\nmay be reluctant to use outpatient care because of user charges. Fortunately, many needy hospital\npatients receive subsidized treatment. However, health center staff are more reluctant to wave or\nreduce charges as supplies are limited and it is socially difficult to help some and exclude others at\nthe community level. The possible effect of user charges on the public in general and the poor and\nethnic minorities in particular needs to be examined thoroughly in order to plan for improvements.\nB. Government Policy and Plans\n33. The  Lao  People\u2019s  Revolutionary  Party  Congress  aims  to  ensure  that  health  service\nprovision is expanded to the entire population at the grassroots level; the quality of health services\nis  improved;  and  vulnerable  groups,  including  mothers  and  children,  receive  more  attention.\nConsistent with this mandate, MOH has adopted the PHC approach, which aims to achieve the\ninternational goal of \u201chealth for all\u201d by making basic health services, including first referral care,\navailable  to  the  entire  population  in  an  integrated  manner  and  with  full  participation  of  the\ncommunity. With ADB support, MOH has prepared a PHC policy (see footnote 1) that describes\nthe  strategic  priorities,  delivery  system,  and  organizational  structures  that  will  guide  PHC\nexpansion  in  the future.  The policy,  approved  in  February  2000,  provides  a  clear  vision  for\nstrengthening the health system, capacity building, mobilizing resources, and improving health\nsector performance toward health for all. The Cabinet of MOH has recently been assigned to\ncoordinate  the  implementation  of  the  policy.  For  this  purpose,  the  new  PHC  and  Rural\nDevelopment Division has been created as one of the five divisions of the Cabinet. The division will\nprovide PHC guidelines, coordinate PHC programs and externally funded PHC activities, and\nmonitor and evaluate PHC. The Government will also establish provincial PHC coordination units\nto strengthen the coordination of services, vertical programs, and projects at the provincial level.\n34. The PHC policy identifies nine basic components of PHC: (i) improvements in quality and\nexpansion  of  the  network  of  health  facilities;  (ii)  health  education;  (iii)  clean  water  and\nenvironmental sanitation; (iv) immunization; (v) MCH and birth spacing services; (vi) nutrition;\n(vii) prevention and control of common diseases; (viii) treatment of the most common diseases;\nand (ix) essential drugs and revolving drug funds.\n35. According to the PHC Policy and Investment Plan, the design of the PHC network begins at\nthe grassroots level and progressively grows to regional PHC referral facilities. Each level is\nresponsible for providing PHC services, and supporting, supervising, coordinating, and referring\npatients in a systematic fashion. Trained private sector VHPs with essential drug kits are planned\nfor villages that do not have access to government health centers. Strategically placed health\n                                                       \n141993 World Bank estimate adjusted for inflation rate to 1997/98 dollars for comparison purposes.", "9\ncenters with three or more trained health workers will serve clusters of villages. Small district\nhospitals with 15-20 beds are designed to serve as the first level of PHC referral. Provincial\nhospitals and regional referral facilities are responsible for more advanced medical treatments.\n36. The policy framework and political commitment for birth spacing has improved recently. In\nNovember 1999, the Government adopted the National Population and Development Policy, which\nrecognized the adverse consequences of high fertility to the health of Lao women and children,\nand to the economy and well-being of the family. The policy aims to (i) achieve a rate of population\ngrowth compatible with socioeconomic development; (ii) motivate and assist people to improve\ntheir quality of life by ensuring safe motherhood, reducing morbidity and mortality associated with\nthe reproductive health system, and enabling couples to freely and responsibly decide upon the\nnumber and spacing of their children; (iii) improve the status of women and ethnic populations by\neliminating  disparities;  (iv) promote  a  balanced  population  distribution;  and  (v)  incorporate\npopulation factors and concerns in all policies and plans.\n37. Based on the PHC investment plan, MOH is planning to mobilize additional funds from\ninternal and external sources to develop PHC. In addition, MOH is planning to revise PMD 52 to\nstreamline cost recovery in hospitals and drug revolving funds in health centers. This will be based\non further analysis of sources and uses of funds in health facilities and pilot tests in selected\nfacilities. Following developments in the formal sector, MOH is also planning to develop risk-\npooling schemes in the informal sector.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n38. The Lao PDR is receiving substantial external assistance in the health sector, and such\nassistance accounted for an estimated 30.4 percent of total health expenditures in 1998. Major\nfunding agencies are the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAid), the European\nCommission, the Germanische Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), the World Bank and United\nNations agencies. Fifteen agencies provide 71 percent of foreign assistance to the health sector\nand 87 percent of the foreign assistance for PHC. Multilateral assistance contributed about $5.1\nmillion or 37 percent and bilateral assistance about $8.6 million or 63 percent. A list of projects with\nsource of funding, outcome, and lesson learned is in Appendix 3.\n39. The first ADB loan to the Lao PDR health sector was the PHC Project in 1995, which\ninstalled a PHC network of health centers and district hospitals in Xieng Khouang and Oudomxai\nprovinces. Concurrently, the World Bank funded the Health System Reform and Malaria Control\nProject  in Savannakhet, Xekong, the  Xaysomboune Special  Zone, and  the  Boloven  Plateau.\nAusAid is supporting two PHC projects: the Health and Social  Development  Project  in  three\ndistricts of Phongsali Province and five districts of Houaphan Province, which commenced in 1997;\nand the Sayaburi PHC Project being implemented through Save the Children Fund Australia, which\ncommenced in 1991. These projects are in the proposed project area and can be considered as\nsuccessful pilot projects. The GTZ-supported Lao-German Family Health Project in Bolikhamxay\nProvince started in 1996 and has innovative features from which much can be learned. The Swiss\nRed  Cross  supports  PHC  in  Louang  Phrabang  and  M\u00e9decins  Sans  Fronti\u00e8res  in  Bokeo,\nChampassak, and Xekong provinces. In addition, there are many small NGO managed PHC\nprojects supported by bilateral and other funding agencies that are very diverse in their approach.\n40. Support for vertical programs is also substantial. The Expanded Program of Immunization\nreceives financial support from AusAid, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA),\nLuxembourg, UNICEF, and WHO. The nationwide malaria control program receives assistance\nfrom the European Union, JICA, and the World Bank. UNFPA\u2019s Second Country Program will\nexpand reproductive health training throughout the country but the budget is insufficient to supply\ncontraceptives for the whole country. United Nations agencies against AIDS (UNAIDS) supports\nthe HIV/AIDS control program. A consortium, including ADB, GTZ, JICA, the Swedish International\nDevelopment Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank, assists the Clean Water Program.", "10\n41. The  various  external  interests  have  led  to  a  potpourri  of  PHC  projects  with  different\nimplementation strategies. Much has been learned from this diversity, including the need to tailor\nprojects to local conditions and population characteristics. The disadvantages are the substantial\ngaps in coverage, the difficulties in integrating the projects in the network of PHC services, and\nproblems  replicating  and  sustaining  these  services.  In  particular  monitoring,  supply,  and\naccounting systems need to be standardized.\nD. Lessons Learned\n42. Through its first loan to the Lao PDR health sector, ADB has gained valuable experience.\nThe first ADB project was implemented on time and led to a marked increase in use of health\nservices and in health outcomes in the targeted population. Important lessons learned, along with\nthose gained from partner organizations, include the following.\n(i)  Expansion of the public health system through subdistrict health centers and training\nof private sector VHPs significantly increases accessibility to basic health services.\n(ii)  Construction of health centers in remote and inaccessible areas of the mountainous\nnorthern provinces in the Lao PDR is a major undertaking. In consultation with the\ncommunity, health centers should be placed strategically to maximize accessible for\npatients, staff, supplies and supervision.\n(iii)  The  success of health centers depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  deploy\ncompetent health personnel from the province or district. A health center should not\nbe constructed until all staff have been assigned. A health center should have three\nfull-time staff, so that two can travel together for outreach activities in the villages.\n(iv)  Successful PHC projects require a project management structure that decentralizes\nresponsibility and authority from the central level to the provinces where activities\nare being implemented. It is not possible to successfully manage projects  with\nheavily centralized management and disbursement procedures.\n(v)  Successful PHC projects depend on the ability to procure civil works, medicines,\nother  supplies,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  expeditiously.  Delays  in\nprocurement translate into exponential delays in implementation. Large-scale PHC\nprojects  need  a  procurement  unit  with  competent  staff  using  streamlined\nprocurement procedures to deliver the goods on time.\n(vi)  Cost recovery for health care goods and services is used widely in the Lao PDR at\nevery level. At provincial hospitals and district hospitals, cost recovery fees account\nfor 60 percent of operating revenue. Every PHC project in the Lao PDR has some\nform of cost recovery at health centers. In Khammouan and Borikhamxai provinces,\nvillage health volunteers are successfully charging for essential drugs. VHPs are\nalso routinely charging for their services.\n(vii)  Sustainability of PHC projects must be well-planned during project design. Human\nand financial resources required to sustain the PHC projects must be accurately\nforecast and proven methods, such as cost recovery, carefully integrated in the\ndesign to ensure continued operation.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n43. Within the overarching goal of poverty reduction, ADB\u2019s operational strategy for the Lao\nPDR  aims  to  (i)  support  sustainable  economic  growth  and  investments  supporting  the  local", "11\neconomy; and (ii) strengthen the policy and institutional framework necessary to convert aggregate\nincome growth into balanced, equitable, and sustainable growth. ADB also gives high priority to\nwomen\u2019s development and population planning, and improving governance. ADB\u2019s assistance in\nthe health sector supports policy reform, institutional development, and provision of PHC to provide\nequitable  services  and  support  human  development.  ADB\u2019s  overall  health  sector  policy15\nemphasizes a focus on PHC to increase cost-effectiveness of investments; reach the poor, women,\nand other vulnerable groups; and improve governance in the sector.\n44. During the last four years, ADB has focused on the improvement of PHC in two rural\nprovinces. The PHC project was designed explicitly to pilot test a mechanism for establishing a\nrural PHC system based on health centers at the subdistrict level staffed and supervised by trained\nand full-time MOH personnel. During the 1997 country programming mission, the Government\nindicated that it gave high priority to the development of PHC and, accordingly, ADB\u2019s Lao PDR\ncountry assistance plan includes the PHC Expansion Project.\n45. ADB is supporting the PHC policy and institutional capacity of the Government to ensure\nthat PHC investments are effective, efficient, equitably distributed, and sustainable. ADB plans\nsupport to expand the PHC network and referral facilities to rural geographical areas where little or\nno access to PHC services exist. ADB also plans to support the Government with institutional\ncapacity building for PHC management and to strengthen health sector financing.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n46. Extensive policy dialogue was held with MOH about making effective and affordable health\nservices available to the entire population. Key policy themes that have been discussed between\nthe ADB Mission and MOH are (i) targeting  disadvantaged populations  including  women  and\nchildren, the poor and ethnic minorities; (ii) capacity building to improve health sector performance;\nand (iii) improving financial sustainability and efficiency of public health services.\n47. Targeting Disadvantaged Populations. Within the context of poverty reduction and the\nright to health care for all, ADB discussed the Government\u2019s approach to make essential health\ncare available to all. The Government is pursuing this through (i) strengthening the policy and\nstrategic framework for PHC, (ii) targeted health services and human resources developments, and\n(iii) improving affordability of services for the poor.\n(i)  The  development  of  PHC  policy  guidelines  and  an  investment  plan,  and  the\npreparation of provincial plans and budgets will help focus on the needs of the\ndisadvantaged. ADB will support this through a proposed advisory TA. In addition,\nthe Project will support regular evaluation of health services benefits to the poor and\nethic minorities.\n(ii)  MOH will give high priority to placement of health facilities in poor and underserved\npopulations, in particular ethnic minorities, and will give high priority to services\nbenefiting the poor most. MOH and ADB concur on the need to increase indigenous\nstaff and female staff in areas populated by ethnic minorities, to ensure acceptability\nof services. An ethnic minorities plan was prepared and it was agreed to establish\nthree provincial training programs in the northern  area especially for  candidate\nhealth workers from ethnic minority groups. The programs will become operational\nwithin two years of loan effectiveness.\n(iii)  The Project will support MOH to provide affordable PHC for the poor through the\nprovision  of  low  cost  drugs,  more  accessible  services  that  reduce  travel  and\nopportunity costs, and exploration of alternative financing mechanisms.

Manila: ADB.", "12\ndialogue was held on ways to ensure that user charges do not undermine use of\nservices  by  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities.  With  the  support  of  the  proposed\nadvisory TA and the Project, financial studies will be done to test strategies to\nimprove the subsidy system at both hospitals and health center levels.\n48. Capacity Building. ADB and MOH discussed the capacity constraints to implementing the\nnew PHC policy and improving the health sector\u2019s performance. ADB will assist MOH with advisory\nTA for capacity building in PHC to build the capacity of the PHC coordination units in the provinces\nand  develop  PHC  management  systems  within  the  next  three  years.  The  Project  will  build\nprovincial  and  district PHC  management  capacity,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  decision  to\ndelegate  strategic  planning  to  the  provinces  and  eventually  make  districts  responsible  for\nbudgeting and implementation.\n49. Financial Sustainability and Efficiency. Extensive policy dialogue was held on improving\ncost-effectiveness, cost containment, and financing in the health sector.\n(i) MOH  will  improve  health  sector  spending by allocating  more  of  the  budget  to\ninterventions  of  high  cost-effectiveness,  in  particular  preventive  and  promotive\nservices.  The  budget  for  MCH  services,  including  for  immunization,  safe\nmotherhood,  birth  spacing  and  HIV/AIDS  education,  is  low  and  needs  to  be\nincreased. This issue has been taken up in the PHC policy of MOH and during the\nproject design, and will be incorporated in the annual provincial health budgets.\n(ii)  In terms of cost containment, MOH will continue to limit the recruitment of staff in\ngeneral, but train and recruit ethnic minority staff for ethnic minority populations.\nMOH is also containing the expansion of the network of health facilities. Extensive\nmapping is being done to select locations for new health facilities that are in areas\nwith needy populations, that can be properly managed and supervised, and to which\nexcess hospital staff can be posted. Realizing that international standards are not\nattainable in the short term, the priority is to give households access to health\nservices within half a day\u2019s walk, with the option of an overnight stay, at locations\nthat  are  convenient  for  patients  and  staff.  To  make  basic  health  care  more\naccessible  in  scattered  and  small  hamlets,  MOH  will  train  VHPs  and  expand\noutreach services in a phased manner.\n(iii)  In the next three years, MOH will be exploring various strategies to improve health\nsector financing with the support of the proposed advisory TA and the Project. The\nproposed strategies will focus on streamlining cost recovery systems at hospital\nlevel, establishing drug revolving funds at the health center and village levels, and\ndeveloping a provincial risk pooling system for the informal sector in addition to\nsimilar efforts in the formal sector.\nIV.THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n50. The Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in the Asian and Pacific Region, with half of\nthe population living in poverty. The rural poor, in particular women and children and ethnic\nminorities living in the inaccessible northern hills, suffer from extremely poor health. The network of\nhealth facilities in the northern provinces has inadequate coverage and provides a limited range of\ncurative services of substandard quality. More than half the rural population do not have access to\npreventive and promotive services and first referral care in these northern provinces.", "13\n51. The  Government,  as  a  cornerstone  of  its  social  policy,  accords  high  priority  to  the\nimprovement of the health status of the population. PHC has been identified as the most cost-\neffective approach to provide basic health services. The Government recently approved a PHC\npolicy that aims to make a basic package of health care available to the entire population, and\nrestructured MOH in support of PHC. The Government has requested ADB to support expansion\nand  improvement  of  PHC  delivery,  strengthening  of  PHC  planning  and  management,  and\ndevelopment of effective financing mechanisms. The Government gives high priority to improving\nthe health status of women and children, ethnic minorities, and the rural poor.\n52. Several strategies to reach the scattered rural population have been considered, including\nthe construction of many small health centers, the provision of mobile clinics, training of volunteers,\ntraining of paid village health workers, and partnership with private VHPs. ADB\u2019s first PHC Project\ndemonstrated that, while recognizing the needs of some of the poorest ethnic minorities, it was not\nfeasible and cost-effective to build facilities and employ full-time staff in low-density populations\nliving in remote locations. Instead, the Project will selectively expand the network of public facilities\nin strategic locations that are both accessible for Government staff and as close to the target\npopulation  as  possible.  To  increase  access  to  rural  villagers  in  general  and  ethnic  minority\npopulations in particular, the Project will explore partnerships with VHPs. As routine curative care\nwill  be  shared  with  VHPs, public  resources  can  then be  more equitably allocated  to  priority\ninterventions and subsidies for the poor. Forming partnerships with private sector providers instead\nof recruiting paid village health workers also avoids recruiting more health staff, and increases the\nlikelihood of sustaining service delivery.\n53. Under the current PHC project, contractual workers were hired to staff new health centers.\nThe disadvantage  of  this  approach  is  the  low  quality  of  these  contractual  workers,  and  the\nadditional  recurrent  cost  it  imposes.  Productivity  of  health  personnel  could  be  increased  by\nredistributing excess personnel to peripheral health centers. However, most health staff depend on\nadditional sources of income to supplement the low Government salary and cannot afford to move\nto a place where they cannot augment their income. To make redistribution possible on a voluntary\nbasis, transferred staff will be offered incentives and, where needed, a hardship allowance. In all\nprovinces, the population is a patchwork of ethnic groups. For example, 24 ethnic minority groups\nmake up 90 percent of the population in Phongsali Province. However, few health workers are from\nthese ethnic minorities, causing cultural and language barriers in delivering services. The Project\nwill therefore increase the training of ethnic minorities, so that health centers will have at least one\nstaff likely to speak the local language.\n54. To ensure that health facilities are being used adequately, the quality of care needs to be\nimproved.  An  evaluation  of  beneficiary  perceptions16  revealed  that  beneficiaries  perceive  the\navailability of drugs, the presence of qualified staff, and good contact with health workers as\nindicators of quality. In one project,17 use increased by 75 percent in Pakkading district hospital, 51\npercent in Pak Ou district hospital, and 46 percent in Paksan provincial hospital when the quality of\ncare improved with the help of revolving drug funds that were making quality drugs available at\nprices lower than those at private pharmacies.18 Accordingly, a comprehensive approach will be\nfollowed to improve the quality of PHC services, including staff development at all levels, improving\nsupply systems and supervision, and strengthening the role of the provincial hospitals in quality\ncontrol.\n55. The development of an integrated PHC system delivering more comprehensive services\nrequires more capacity at the provincial and district levels than a patchwork of centrally controlled\nprograms and projects. It is therefore necessary to develop a new PHC management structure and\nmanagement systems and skills in support of PHC. With the expansion of health services, it is also\n                                                       \n16Chanthala P, Phoutthalath V.

Objectives and Scope\n56. The Project will assist the Government to improve the health status and reduce poverty of\nthe rural people of the Lao PDR. The Project objective is to improve PHC coverage for the rural\npoor  by  (i) expanding  and  improving  the  quality  of  PHC  in  the  northern  region,  and\n(ii) strengthening the institutional capacity for PHC. Provinces in the north were chosen for the first\ncomponent because of the (i) poor health status, in particular among the ethnic minorities; and\n(ii) large gaps in the PHC coverage. The second component is nationwide, as the Government\nwants all provinces to fully participate in and contribute to the nationwide process of planning PHC\ndevelopment  and  integration  of  services  under  the  new  PHC  policy.  To  do  so  requires\nstrengthening of the provincial capacity for PHC coordination.\n57. The  Project  will  target  women  and  children,  ethnic  minorities,  and  the  rural  poor  by\n(i) increasing their physical, social, and financial access to essential services; (ii) focusing on\ninterventions and diseases that affect them mostly; and (iii) improving the quality of services for\nthese groups. The Project will give priority to cost-effective interventions benefiting women and\nchildren including health promotion, MCH and birth spacing services, the prevention and treatment\nof common infections and micronutrient deficiencies, and first referral services.\n1. Component 1: Improving Access to Quality PHC in the northern region\n58. The  first  component  will  develop  PHC  in  eight  provinces  in  the  northern  region  by\n(i) increasing access to PHC, (ii) improving the quality of care, (iii) strengthening reproductive\nhealth services, and (iv) promoting village health care. The Project will support PHC development\nat all levels in six provinces, namely Bokeo, Houaphan, Louang Namtha, Oudomxai, Phongsali and\nXieng Khouang. In addition, the Project will support the improvement of referral services in these\nprovinces and Louang Phrabang and Sayaburi. The total population of the eight provinces is 1.7\nmillion, about 62 percent of who are poor and 38 percent very poor. 19 Project activities below the\nprovincial level will be limited to 34 out of 61 districts, complementary to the PHC support of other\nexternal agencies, with a total population of 0.9 million.\na. Increasing Access to Primary Health Care\n59. Essential Primary Care. MOH plans to provide comprehensive packages of essential\nprimary care services in all district hospitals and several strategically located health centers in each\ndistrict (the packages are summarized in Appendix 4). To improve coverage of health services, the\nProject will construct two type A and 39 type B health centers, and renovate six health centers to\nfill the gaps in the network of health services in the northern area. The facilities will include staff\nquarters, overnight accommodation, and water supply if needed. Type B health centers will have\nthree rooms: one for curative care, one for MCH and birth spacing services, and one for overnight\naccommodation, observation and care. Type A health centers will have six rooms. A total of 57\nhealth  centers  will  be  equipped.  The  health  centers  will  support  outreach  services  including\nimmunization, drug kit supply to VHPs, and training and supervision of health staff and VHPs. The\nProject will also construct 5 district hospitals, renovate or upgrade 11, and equip 18. In total, 42\ndistrict health services will be supported with motorcycles, equipment, and supplies.\n60. The expansion of the network of PHC facilities is kept modest to ensure cost-effective\nprovision of health services. The location of new facilities is based on an extensive mapping and\nconsultation exercise that examines population density, location of ethnic minorities, coverage of\n                                                       \n19 Based on the latest analysis of the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey of 1997-98 (footnote 6), 59.3 percent of\nthe population in these eight provinces is considered poor and 24.6 percent very poor.", "15\nexisting facilities, plans for expansion of rural access roads,20 and consultation with local authorities\nand  beneficiaries.  It  is  closely  coordinated  with  other  external  assistance  projects  in  these\nprovinces to ensure that there is no overlap in services. Construction of health centers will require\nan agreement with the local community representatives. Construction will not start until a person of\nthe predominant ethnic minority has started training to become a member of the health staff. The\ncommunity will, where feasible, contribute labor and materials for the health center and construct\nstaff houses. This contribution is estimated to be up to 18 percent of construction costs.\n61. First Referral Services. The provinces have an average population of about 250,000,\ncomparable to small districts in many other countries. The provincial hospitals provide first referral\nservices, including basic obstetric and surgical services, and staff training. To improve first referral\nservices, the Project will upgrade Louang Phrabang, Phongsali and Sayaburi hospitals; renovate\nBokeo, Houaphan, and Xieng Khouang hospitals; and construct new hospitals in Louang Namtha\nand Oudomxai because of the deplorable state of their current hospitals. Construction will include\nfacilities for MCH and birth spacing clinics; basic surgical, obstetric, pediatric, and medical inpatient\ncare; laboratory services; and staff training. The Project will also support the expansion of first\nreferral services to seven of the larger district hospitals. These district hospitals will be provided\nwith facilities and equipment for emergency surgical services, including obstetric surgery. The\nProject will also provide scholarships for postgraduate training of medical officers and nurses in\nsurgery and anesthesia and will establish laboratory services, including blood transfusion services,\nfor the seven hospitals. Telecommunication and ambulance services will be made available in at\nleast nine district hospitals.\n  b. Improving Quality of Care\n62. Delivering quality health care depends on many factors including staff availability, staff skills\nand  motivation,  adequacy  of  equipment  and  supplies,  regular  supervision,  and  competent\nmanagement. The Project will address several shortfalls to improve the quality of services.\n63. Staff Redistribution. The plan is to have one medical assistant or nurse and two auxiliary\nnurses in each health center, including at least one female and one person from the predominant\nethnic minority in the area. To compensate for the shortage of staff in health centers, the Project\nwill support redistribution of excess hospital staff who volunteer to go to health centers. To make\nthis possible with low salaries, staff will be provided with incentives to compensate for loss of\nincome, including possibly accommodation, motorcycle or bicycle, training, certificate for good\nperformance, and promotion opportunities. In addition, staff working in remote health centers will\nreceive a hardship allowance. Staff will be transferred back to a hospital if they request for a\ntransfer after two to three years of service in a remote location. Rewards for good performance will\nbe provided in a transparent and objective manner based on reports of supervision visits, patient\nsatisfaction and community evaluation. Staff doing fieldwork and supervision will be provided a\nsmall per diem and compensation for transport expenses.\n64. Preservice Training. To compensate for the shortage of staff from ethnic minorities, the\nProject will increase the regional training capacity for auxiliary nurses or equivalent staff. Training\nprograms will be established in Louang Phrabang, Oudomxai, and Xieng Khouang. Priority will be\ngiven to selecting ethnic minority staff living near health centers. They will sign an agreement with\nthe Government that they will work in the health center near their home for at least five years\nfollowing completion of training. In return, the Government will agree to employ the ethnic minority\npersons within three months following successful completion of the training. Civil works for a health\ncenter under the Project will not be started until a person from an underrepresented ethnic minority\nfrom the catchment area of the health center has been admitted to the training program. Selected\nethnic minority persons should have basic education to be eligible for the one-year technical\ntraining program. Those with insufficient basic education will be sponsored to obtain preparatory\n                                                       \n20 Including ADB\u2019s proposed Lao Rural Access Road Project.", "16\ngeneral education. The schools in Oudomxai and Xieng Khouang will be upgraded so that all\nschools have two classrooms and dormitories for a total of 40 people, including for in-service\ntraining. The Project will also support the three schools with regional teacher training, allowances\nfor about 240 students, equipment, furniture, and training material.\n65. In-Service  Training.  The  Project  will  seek  to  institutionalize  in-service  training  in  the\ntargeted provinces based on the lessons learned from other projects, with the general purpose of\nmaking skilled staff available at all levels. The focus will be on general management of services,\nMCH,  birth  spacing,  management  of  common  infections,  and  training  and  support  of  VHPs.\nProvincial and district staff will be trained in management, supervision, and clinical care. The\ntraining program will be managed by the provincial health offices in collaboration with all external\nagencies active in the province. Consulting services will be provided to institutionalize the training\nprogram. Five provinces will be provided with in-service training facilities, with one classroom and\ndormitory for 20 people as part of the provincial hospital complex. The indicative training program\nis in Appendix 5.\n66. Supervision. The Project will support the provincial team to conduct monthly supervision of\ndistrict activities, and the district team to supervise health centers monthly, using a supervisory\nchecklist that allows assessment and aggregation of performance of the PHC program and clinical\npractices. Eight provincial and nine interdistrict teams will be provided a four-wheel drive pick-up\nvehicle  for  supervision  and  supplies.  Regional  training  teams  will  be  supported  to  ensure\ncontinuing education of tutors. Village committees will be provided basic orientation to increase\ntheir role in health center management, including monitoring the revolving drug fund and ensuring\nthat the very poor receive services. Quality of care will also be monitored through special studies\nsuch as on patient satisfaction and management skills.\n67. Supplies  and  Cost  Recovery.  The  Project  will  provide,  for  all  levels  of  services,\nadministrative  and  medical  equipment  and  furniture,  medical  and  office  supplies,  and\ndemonstration and education materials. For health centers, the Project will provide essential drugs\nand consumables in kits for treatment of 1,000 people, with adequate stock for at least one year. A\ncost recovery system based on a revolving fund will be established where not already existing.\nAdditional supplies have been budgeted for subsequent years for poor patients and to compensate\nfor  inflation.  Drug  kits  will  be  resupplied  locally  with  the  support  of  the  central  office  for\nprocurement, logistics, and quality control. The Project will also provide a one-year initial supply of\nessential drugs and consumables for district hospitals.\nc. Strengthening Reproductive Health Services\n68. The Project will collaborate with UNFPA in developing reproductive health services in the\neight provinces in the northern area. UNFPA will provide training in reproductive health education,\nantenatal care, the management of normal and complicated delivery, postnatal care, birth spacing,\nand management of reproductive and urinary tract infections. Reproductive health training will also\nbe incorporated in general in-service training of health staff. The health centers to be constructed\nwill provide examination space for maternal check-up, which can also be used for emergency\ndelivery. Overnight accommodation will be available in the health centers for those patients who\ncannot return the same day, or need additional observation, care, and referral. In addition to\nfacility-based services, the Project will initially explore in one province the feasibility of mobile\nreproductive health services, using the provincial hospital team.\n69. To support the reproductive health program in the northern area, the Project will purchase\ncontraceptives and other supplies, where applicable using the UNFPA global procurement system.\nThe Project will also provide, on a declining scale, financial support for the operational costs of\nexpanding reproductive health services in the eight targeted provinces as part of the Government\ncounterpart contribution, where not available from other sources. This includes field travel and\ntraining costs of staff providing MCH and birth spacing services and procurement of vaccines. To", "17\nbuild up long-term capacity for health services development, the Project will also support four\nregional fellowships for postgraduate training in reproductive health care.\nd.  Promoting Village Health Care\n70. The Government proposes in its PHC policy to promote village health care, in particular to\nreach small and isolated communities where it is not cost-effective to place health centers. In view\nof the basic needs and dispersion of the population, this is a high priority. Good examples of such\nprograms exist. Save the Children Fund Australia, AusAid, GTZ and other agencies are training\nVHPs in several provinces. The Project will explore whether the Government system has the\ncapacity to support VHPs, and whether VHPs are willing to work with the Government in some\nform of public-private partnership. The Project will, based on need and demand, seek to improve\nvillage-based health education and health care in isolated villages, in particular among remote\nethnic minorities not having access to regular services. This will include (i) facilitating support and\nmonitoring of the village committee; (ii) health, nutrition, and birth spacing promotion; (iii) basic\nhealth services through VHPs and birth attendants; and (iv) other activities to promote village\nhealth. Where possible, this will  be done  in  collaboration  with  NGOs and other  Government\nservices operating in these provinces. Provincial and district teams will be trained in community\ndevelopment, teaching methods, and village health care. The district team, with support from the\nprovincial team, will be responsible for planning, implementing, and monitoring the village health\ncare promotion.\n71. Village Committee Support. The district health team will select one or two health centers\neach year to be assisted in the development of village-based health activities. All or a cluster of\nvillages will be selected in the catchment area of the health center. Participation of villages will be\non a voluntary basis depending on interest in participation and staff constraints. Priority will be\ngiven to poor villages of ethnic minorities not having easy access to health services. Following\nidentification and selection of interested villages, the district PHC team will discuss the options with\nthe village committee and health care providers, and make a social contract for a basic package of\nneeds-based health care activities to be made available and sustained at village level. The village\ncommittee will be responsible for overseeing implementation, including identifying health education\npriorities, monitoring drug prices, and ensuring that the very poor receive adequate care at minimal\ncost.\n72. VHP Training. Most villages have at least one health practitioner, who may be a retired\nhealth worker, drug dispenser, traditional birth attendant, village health volunteer, or traditional\nhealer. The village committee will seek interested persons among the existing health practitioners\nor other suitable candidates to provide basic health services and health promotion. Additional skills\nsuch as for maternal care may be added after one or two years of satisfactory performance. The\nVHP should preferably be female, married or otherwise settled, and have the ability to learn. The\nVHP will have a small income from the sale of drugs. About 1,200 VHPs will undergo phased\ntraining for 1-3 months at the health center level. VHPs will be provided a per diem during training.\nTraining will start in Xieng Khouang and Oudomxai provinces, where a health center network and\ntraining capacity have been established.\n73. Drug Revolving Fund. VHPs will provide standard care for 5-10 common illnesses\u2014\ndepending on the training of the provider\u2014such as for malaria and respiratory tract infections. The\nProject will establish a revolving drug fund by training the VHP and providing an initial supply of\ndrugs. VHPs will be allowed to sell the drugs for a reasonable mark-up and adjustment for inflation.\nThe Government will periodically update guidelines regarding the minimal range of essential drugs\nto have in stock. The Government will also provide guidelines regarding prices of drugs but will\notherwise leave the monitoring of drug prices to the village committee. Proceeds from the sale of\ndrugs will be used to purchase new supplies from approved sources providing quality drugs. The\nvillage health committee will be asked to arrange community assistance for families who can not\nafford to pay for drugs.", "18\n74. Village  Health  Volunteers.  The  Project  will  also  support  health  education  efforts  to\nimprove the village environment based on local priorities. About 5,000 volunteers will be identified\nand trained at the health center to promote health on such topics as personal hygiene, clean water\nand sanitation, immunization, nutrition, reproductive health, use of mosquito nets, drug addiction,\nuse of health services, and timely referral. The Project will support small-scale water supply and\nsanitation if technical support can be obtained and no other funding source is available.\n2. Component 2: Institutional Capacity Building for PHC\n75. The Project will strengthen MOH\u2019s capacity to develop PHC in accordance with the PHC\npolicy. The Project will support MOH to better coordinate PHC delivered through vertical programs;\nprojects funded by external agencies; and services offered at the district hospitals, health centers,\nand village levels. This will be done by strengthening the national and provincial organizational\nstructures established by MOH. The Project will support MOH to (i) develop PHC coordination\nstructures, (ii) strengthen PHC management systems, (iii) build capacity through staff development,\nand (iv) test innovative financing approaches. The Project will closely coordinate activities with\nother externally assistance projects in the provinces to ensure complementarity.\n   \na. Strengthening PHC Coordination\n76. The Project will provide resources to activate the PHC coordination network at the central,\nprovincial, and district levels. The MOH PHC policy mandates the PHC and Rural Development\nDivision and 18 provincial PHC coordination units in the provincial health service. The division has\nbeen established in the Cabinet under the supervision of the MOH steering committee. A director\nhas  been  assigned  and  staff  appointments  are  forthcoming.  The  division  is  responsible  for\nplanning,  coordinating,  supervising,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  all  PHC  activities  and  for\ncoordinating international assistance for the PHC program. The Project will assist the start-up of\nthe central PHC and Rural Development Division by providing support for (i) contracted staff;\n(ii) facilities, equipment, furniture, and vehicles; (iii) meetings and workshops; (iv) supervision of\nPHC activities in the provinces; (v) a PHC research agenda; and (vi) routine operating costs.\n77. The Government plans to establish provincial PHC coordination units in the provincial\nhealth offices to better coordinate PHC activities in the provinces. These units will be established\nwithin one year after the commencement of the loan. The Project will assist with the formation and\nactivation of 18 provincial PHC coordination units by providing for (i)  construction or renovation of\nmodest  office  space  in  eight  provinces;  (ii)  office  equipment  and  furniture,  vehicles,  and\ncommunications  equipment;  (iii)  annual  planning  meetings;  and  (iv)  routine  operating  costs.\nFollowing staff training, MOH will provide these units with the authority to effectively coordinate\nservices, projects, and vertical programs delivered under other organizational entities in MOH.\n78. The PHC coordination network will also contain the project management structure for the\nProject (Appendix 6). The project management office (PMO) will be located in the PHC and Rural\nDevelopment Division, MOH. The project implementation offices (PIOs) will be located in the\nprovincial health offices in eight provinces under component 1 of the Project. The PMO and PIOs\nwill be provided facilities, equipment, vehicles, and staff to handle PHC program management and\nproject implementation. PMO and PIOs will assist provinces to develop five-year health plans and\nannual plans for the provinces for aggregation at national level. These plans will include all major\nvertical program and project activities of external agencies.\nb. Standardizing PHC Management System\n79. To complement the nationwide network for PHC coordination, the Project will assist MOH to\nadapt standardized management systems that can be used in all PHC activities throughout the\ncountry regardless of the source of funding. A multitude of management systems are currently", "19\nbeing used by projects, programs, and services, which makes it difficult to develop, coordinate, and\nmonitor PHC. The MOH PHC and Rural Development Division, in collaboration with other divisions\nin MOH, will review and evaluate management systems used in the services, programs, and projects\nfor relevance, utility, and ease of implementation. These will be developed into coherent system\ndesigns,  standard  operating  procedures,  and  guidelines  that  will  be  tested  and  disseminated\nnationwide in coordination with other divisions and external agencies.\n80. Priority will be given to management systems for (i) planning and budgeting, (ii) financial\nmanagement, (iii) office procedures, (iv) supervision, and (v) monitoring and evaluation. Improved\nplanning and budgeting helps to identify priorities, rationalize spending, set milestones, and conform\nto the Lao PDR Government fiscal year that integrates plans and budgets from Government and\nexternal assistance. Cost recovery needs streamlining, with clear guidelines for pricing drugs and\nservices and for any subsidy. Clear guidelines are needed for office operations such as information\nstorage,  communications,  and  reporting.  Supervision  of  PHC  will  use  simple  checklists  for\nsupervising  PHC  programs  at  all  levels.  The  current  health  information  system  needs  to  be\nstandardized  and  simplified  as  it  is  fragmented,  replicates  information  collection,  and  collects\ninformation  of  limited  use  and  validity.  PHC  will  be  evaluated  using  uniform  indicators  and\nstandardized methodologies so that performance can be evaluated among provinces and projects.\n81. Consultants for management and monitoring will be hired to work with MOH personnel to\ndevelop the standardized systems. They will implement the systems that will be designed under\nthe proposed advisory TA for capacity building for PHC. Proposed systems will be reviewed and\nmodified in national workshops with participation from each province and funding agencies. The\nProject will provide follow-up and on-the-job training once staff have received basic training and the\nsystems have been introduced. The Project will also assist MOH\u2019s Human Resources Department\nto (i) disseminate organizational and personnel guidelines that were developed based on analyses\nconducted under the Civil Service Reform Program, and (ii) monitor their implementation.\nc. Staff Development for PHC Management\n82. The Project will improve management capacity among central and provincial PHC staff\nthrough a series of in-country training programs and study tours; annual conferences on PHC;\nworkshops, regional, and international study tours and conferences; and overseas fellowships for\ndegree-level training fields related to public health management. The Project will support (i) a PHC\nmanagement course for provincial and district health office staff, (ii) a WHO hospital management\ncourse to train hospital staff in hospital finance and management, and (iii) an accounting and cost\nrecovery course for health center staff. These courses will be offered at the central MOH training\ncenters (School for Health Personnel, School of Public Health, or central tertiary hospitals) or at\nregional training centers or PHC referral facilities (Appendix 5).\n83. The  in-country,  regional,  and  international  study  tours  and  conferences  will  expose\nmanagers to innovative management practices in other provinces and countries and allow them to\nexchange experiences. Based on a set of criteria agreed between MOH and ADB, the Project will\nsupport (i) 11 people to obtain masters degrees in public health in the region; and (ii) 4 with\nfellowships to attend overseas graduate-level programs abroad in public planning and finance, and\nhuman resource development. English language training will also be offered to planning staff.\n84. A PHC conference will be held once every two years so that provincial governors and\nhealth staff can discuss policy issues, and review performance of all provinces using standard\nindicators  for  supervision  and  evaluation.  These  will  be  held  in  conjunction  with  the  annual\nplanning meetings. The training courses to be offered are PHC and hospital management, cost\nrecovery guidelines and methods, fellowships, language courses, and local and international study\ntours and conferences.", "20\nd. Testing Innovative Financing Approaches\n85. The Project will test three strategies to improve PHC financing. The Project will explore\n(i) streamlining cost recovery for hospital services, (ii) a revolving drug fund for health centers and\nat village-level, and (iii) a provincial health care subscription system. Each of these reforms derives\nfrom and is designed to build on the success of cost recovery efforts in the public PHC network.\nWhere risk pooling is introduced, patients will have the option of either fee-for-service or annual\nprepayment of a subscription fee with a substantial discount on fee-for-service. The options will be\ncarefully evaluated for possible replication nationwide. MOH will actively pursue a change in policy\nto abolish the 20 percent tax levied on user charges. at present in all provinces with a detailed\nprovincial health budget, and where a pilot project for health sector financing is being introduced.\n86.  The Project will streamline cost recovery systems in hospitals. The proposed advisory TA\nwill develop the design for a hospital study funded under the Project to determine the sources and\nuses of funds to improve budgeting, allocation of funds, and pricing of services. The study will\n(i) consider  mechanisms  to  subsidize  services  for  the  poor  and  services  with  externalities;\n(ii) determine whether provision of reduced fees for the poor should continue on the basis of an\ninformal  assessment  and  exemption  system  or  whether  it  should  be  replaced  with  a  more\ntransparent system, involving higher overheads; and (iii) explore the possibilities of paying for staff\nincentives and operational expenses.\n87. To improve access to drugs in more remote communities, the Project will explore whether a\nrevolving drug fund can be established at the village level. VHPs will be provided with an initial\nsupply  of  drugs  for  common  illnesses.  The  VHP  will  be  allowed  a  mark-up  to  pay  for  full\nreplacement  of  used  stock  and  additional  cost  of  service  delivery  and  inflation.  VHPs  will\nperiodically  be  provided  with  guidelines  for  drug  prices.  The  Project  will  also  test  whether\npreventive and promotive services, such as for immunization, can be included in the VHP support\npackage. Different options will be explored to make drugs affordable for the very poor. The most\npromising  option  is  to  make  an  agreement  with  the  community  organization  to  arrange  for\nassistance for the very poor as a condition for assistance. Other options under consideration are a\npostpayment system, an annual Government supplement for the VHP, and a voucher system.\n88. Based on a design developed under the proposed advisory TA, the Project will explore the\npossibility of establishing a provincial health care subscription system in Louang Phrabang using\nan annual subscription fee to introduce risk pooling against catastrophic illness, promote quality of\ncare  and  preventive  services,  and  increase  health  sector  financing.  Complementary  to  the\ndevelopments in the formal sector, this scheme will test the possibility of people contributing to a\nprovincial public health fund to obtain services at a discounted rate in the provincial health system.\nFree health cards will be issued to the very poor. Collected fees will be redistributed according to\nuse of services. The study will include the design of accounting and outcome monitor systems.\nC. Cost Estimates\n89. The total cost of the Project including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and duties\nis estimated at $25 million equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of $10.7 million equivalent\n(43 percent) and local currency cost of $14.3 million equivalent (57 percent).

Financing Plan\n90. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR14,956,000 ($20 million equivalent) from its\nSpecial Funds resources to finance up to 80 percent of the total project cost. This will cover the\ntotal foreign exchange cost and an estimated $9.3 million equivalent in local currency costs (65\npercent of the total local currency cost). The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The Government will finance $5.0 million equivalent of the\nproject cost. The Government contribution for civil works and recurrent costs to sustain project\nactivities after project completion will in part be financed from the eight provincial budgets. The\nGovernment financing includes a community contribution for labor and building materials valued at\n$0.2 million and land valued at $1.3 million for the plots of new health facilities. An annual financing\nplan is in Appendix 7.", "22\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Cost Percent\nExchange Currency\nADB 10.7 9.3 20.0 80\nGovernment and 0.0   5.0 5.0 20\ncommunities\nTotal 10.7 14.3 25.0 100\n            Source: Staff estimates.\n91. The provision of financing for local currency cost is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local\ncurrency financing policy.21 Assistance is required to meet the local currency cost of development\nprojects because a low level of per capita income constrains national savings and public finance is\nunder pressure. The  Government  is  taking  steps  to  improve  the  rate  of  national  savings by\nenhancing revenue collections, improving the efficiency of public expenditure and incentives for\nprivate sector participation in revenue-generating capital market reforms, and encouraging private\nsector  participation  in  revenue-generating  public  sector  projects.  Although  these  efforts  are\nexpected to increase national savings, a significant resource gap will continue for some time\nbecause of  the  need for  large  capital  investments.  Thus,  ADB  assistance  for  local  currency\nexpenditures related to the Project from an economic perspective is justified.\n92. From a technical perspective, the high level of financing of local currency costs is justified\nfor  a  number  of  reasons.  First,  PHC  services  to  be  provided  under  the  Project  are  of\ndisproportionate benefit to the poor but involve few foreign exchange costs. Second, many of the\ninputs required for PHC services are local, and thus the foreign exchange cost is modest. Third,\nthe Project supports interaction of the Government with the private sector at the village level\nthrough partnerships with village health providers, and the nature of the support is aimed at\nproviding services at the grassroots level with locally procured goods and services. \nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1.   Project Management\n93. MOH will be the Executing Agency for the Project (para. 106). The steering committee for\nthe Project will be the MOH Steering Committee for Monitoring International Assistance, composed\nof the Minister, Vice-Ministers, and directors of the departments in MOH, with representation of the\nMinistry  of  Finance,  the  State  Planning  Committee,  and  the  Committee  for  Investment  and\nCooperation.  The  PMO  (para.  78)  will  have  two  project  coordinators,  four  assistant  project\ncoordinators, three accounts assistants, administrative and statistical staff, and support staff.\n94. Each of the eight provinces will have a provincial health steering committee headed by the\nvice-governor  with  representation  of  the  provincial  health  office,  the  planning  and  budgeting\ndepartment, and beneficiaries. PIOs will be established in the provincial health offices of the eight\nproject provinces. The deputy provincial health officer or another person of comparable authority\nwill be the PIO head and project coordinator for the province. The PIOs will have about five\nadditional staff members, including an accounts assistant. The central and provincial steering\ncommittees will provide policy support and guidance for project implementation based on the\noverall strategic framework for PHC development. The committees will institutionalize the use of\nfive-year plans and annual rolling plans, conduct annual reviews, and approve annual project\nimplementation plans and budgets.\n                                                       \n21R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects. 3 January 1995.", "23\n95. The director of the PHC and Rural Development Division, who will also be the project\ndirector, will assist the provincial health offices to prepare five-year plans and annual rolling plans\nfor PHC, and aggregate these to prepare the national five-year plan for PHC and annual rolling\nplan for approval of MOH. These plans will include the major sources of external financing for the\nvarious PHC activities for each province. The director will also (i) coordinate PHC management\nand services; (ii) coordinate the various PHC projects; (iii) monitor and evaluate PHC development,\nand  (iv)  identify  studies,  policy  development,  and  capacity  building  needed  to  support  PHC\ndevelopment. The project coordinators in the PMO and the provincial PIOs will report to the project\ndirector and will be responsible for project management and implementation.\n96. The PMO will be responsible for overall project planning, implementation, and monitoring,\nincluding procurement of equipment and civil works, recruitment of consultants, disbursement of\nfunds according to the approved annual implementation plan, reporting, and benefit monitoring and\nevaluation. PIOs will assist each provincial health office (and PHC coordination unit following its\nestablishment) to plan, implement, and monitor delegated project activities (such as training and\nlocal procurement). PIOs will prepare five-year plans and annual rolling plans for the Project as\npart of the five-year provincial health plan.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n97. The Project will be implemented over a period of six years, from the end of 2000 to the end\nof 2006. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.\n3. Procurement of Goods and Services\n98. All procurement for the ADB-financed portions of the Project will be in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  under  the\nguidance and supervision of the MOH steering committee. The PMO will set up a procurement unit\nin PMO and will be assisted by procurement consultants. The PMO will (i) propose bid packages\nand  procurement  methods;  (ii)  prepare  detailed  materials  lists  and  specifications;  (iii)  where\napplicable,  determine  prequalification  criteria,  evaluation  criteria,  and  completion  of  delivery\nperiods; and (iv) evaluate bids, determine the lowest evaluated and substantially responsive bids,\nand certify payments. MOH will approve contracts and certify payments. Copies of all contracts and\nsupporting documents will be forwarded to ADB for record and where necessary for approval.\na.  Civil Works\n99. The Project includes construction of small hospitals and health centers, which are in remote\nand scattered locations and are unlikely to attract international bidders. Civil works contracts will be\nawarded according to local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. However, if any\npackage is estimated to cost more than $1.0 million, international competitive bidding procedures\nwill be followed. A domestic firm under supervision of an international architect consultant will\nprepare the plans for civil works. A summary of civil works is in Appendix 9.\nb.  Equipment and Materials\n100. Under the Project, related equipment and material  will be combined  into packages to\nsimplify  procurement.  Supply  contracts  costing  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  by\ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Supply contracts of $500,000 equivalent or less will\nfollow international shopping procedures, except for some equipment and supplies such as hostel\nbeds and furniture, which are locally manufactured and unlikely to attract foreign suppliers. These\nwill be procured through local competitive bidding in accordance with Government procedures\nacceptable to ADB. Packages of less than $100,000 may be directly purchased. Equipment and\nmaterials required at the provincial level and costing less than $10,000 may be procured by the", "24\nPIO according to Government procedures acceptable to ADB. The indicative list of equipment,\ndrugs, and supplies to be procured is in Appendix 10.\nc. Consulting Services\n101. The Project will support about 72 person-months of international and about 492 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. International consultants will include a chief technical\nadviser  (36  person-months),  an  education  and  training  specialist  (6  person-months),  a\nmanagement specialist (12 person-months), a health sector financing specialist (6 person-months),\na procurement specialist (6 person-months), and an architect (6 person-months), all based in PMO\nin Vientiane.22 Domestic individual consultants will include an education and training specialist (72\nperson-months), a management specialist (72 person-months), a health sector financing specialist\n(72 person-months), a procurement specialist (72 person-months), an accountant (72 person-\nmonths), and a monitoring and evaluation specialist (72 person-months). A domestic architectural\nfirm will be contracted for five years for building design and construction supervision of health\nfacilities. International and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB on the\nrecruitment of domestic consultants. The terms of reference are in Appendix 11.\n4. Accounts and Auditing\n102. The Government, acting through MOH, will maintain records and accounts adequate to\nidentify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. The provincial health offices\nwill  also  maintain  accounts  for  relevant  project  activities  following  the  same  standards.  In\ncoordination  with other  TA,  the  Government  will  hire  a  local  consultant  to  bring  the  Project\naccounting system up to international accounting standards in the first year.23 MOH will (i) maintain\nseparate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited in\naccordance with international auditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) provide\nADB, not later than 12 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited\naccounts and financial statements and the report of the auditor on these. In addition to the internal\ncontrol arrangements of the department and annual audits of the Government, ADB may request\nthe Government to arrange for an independent audit, either local or international, to be financed\nfrom loan proceeds.\n5. Disbursement Procedures\n103. To  expedite  project  implementation, ADB  will  deposit an  initial  amount  not  exceeding\n$500,000 into an imprest account with the Bank of Lao under the authority of the Ministry of\nFinance.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook of  June 1996,  as  amended, and  with\ndetailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The statement of expenditure\nprocedure may be used for reimbursements of eligible local and foreign expenditures under the\nProject not exceeding $100,000 and to liquidate advances made into the imprest accounts in\naccordance with the same guidelines. Expenditures for contracts larger than $100,000 equivalent\nshould use the direct payment and commitment letter procedures for withdrawing loan funds.\nBecause project activities will take place in dispersed geographic areas where communication is\ndifficult, simple mechanisms are required to disburse small funds quickly through decentralized\ndecision making while maintaining acceptable levels of financial control. Accordingly, subaccounts\nwill be established and managed in the PMO and in the eight provincial PIOs following the same\nguidelines. The initial amount in PMO will not exceed $50,000 and in PIOs will not exceed $10,000.\n                                                       \n22AusAid is considering supporting reputed international  NGOs  to  provide  TA to  facilitate  capacity  building  and\ndevelopment of PHC at the provincial level.\n23TA 3309-LAO: Enhancing Government\u2019s Accounting Regulation and Facilities, for $700,000, approved on 25 Nov 99;\nTA 5799: Social Impact Assessment of the Financial Crisis in Selected DMCs for $500,000, approved on 22 July 98.", "25\n6. Reporting\n104. The PMO will prepare the Project\u2019s annual plans for ADB\u2019s concurrence. The PMO will also\nprepare quarterly monitoring reports, and submit them to ADB within one month of the end of each\nquarter. The reports will include (i) progress made including aspects of quality; (ii) delays and\nproblems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  the  issues;  (iii) compliance  with  loan\ncovenants; (iv) proposed program of activities and inputs required during the next three months,\nand (v) maintenance and repairs. Each PIO will report to PMO. Within six months of physical\ncompletion of the Project, the Government will submit to ADB a project completion report. The\nreport will include the costs and compliance with loan covenants.\n7. Midterm Review of the Project\n105. In addition to regular reviews, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm\nreview of the Project after three years of implementation. This will be preceded by an MOH report\ndescribing the project progress and issues, a midterm household survey in two of the selected\nprovinces, and group discussions with health staff and potential beneficiaries. These will indicate\nthe progress toward quantitative and qualitative targets, and likely project impact and sustainability.\nThe midterm review will appraise the project scope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements,\nand compliance with loan covenants and assurances, and identify any issues to be addressed to\nimprove project impact and sustainability. The Government and ADB will jointly decide on any\nchanges needed in the design and implementation of the Project.\nF. Executing Agency\n106. MOH has gained experience with project implementation in the first ADB loan to the Lao\nPDR health sector, which will be completed on schedule and has generally achieved its objectives.\nThe Ministry of Finance will delegate the necessary financial authority to MOH in view of the strong\nperformance of MOH as an executing agency. To address procurement constraints, a procurement\nunit will be established in MOH. As with other projects in the Lao PDR, successful implementation\nwill  depend  on  the  timely  availability  and  quality  of  project  staff,  and  MOH  will  ensure  that\ncompetent  administrative  and  technical  project  staff  are  available  for  the  Project  during\nimplementation. ADB will assist in capacity building for PHC through a proposed advisory TA. The\nProject itself provides for substantial international and domestic consulting services to assist in\nProject implementation.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n107. The Project will have minimal adverse environmental impacts. The Project will support the\nremoval and disposal of asbestos roofing material from Louang Phrabang hospital according to\nWHO standards. The Government will ensure that proper waste disposal is included in the design\nof health facilities. Refuse handling and disposal measures for hazardous medical waste, e.g.,\nsyringes and needles, will be specifically addressed in the design and operation of the health\nfacilities. The Project will provide training and guidelines for provincial and district health office staff\nto ensure proper medical waste management in all health facilities under their responsibility.\n2. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n108. The  Project  does  not  envisage  land  acquisition  or  relocation  of  households,  as  all\nconstruction is expected to be on Government land. Land for hospital construction is already\navailable, and very little land is required for new health centers, which need about 0.25 hectare\neach. Any negative impacts such as involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized in the\nProject. The Government has assured ADB that no health centers to be constructed under this", "26\nProject will involve resettlement of any people. Before any construction is started, the Government\nwill confirm that the plot for construction is Government property and not under lease or otherwise\nin  private  use.  However,  if  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable  and  involves  minor  land\nacquisition, relocation, or loss of other assets (e.g., crops), appropriate compensation will be\nnegotiated with representation of the affected persons, in accordance with the Government\u2019s and\nADB\u2019s policies, and will be implemented accordingly. If a health center needs to be relocated, the\nsame assurance will apply. A short resettlement and land acquisition plan has been prepared in\ncase of involuntary resettlement under the Project.\n3. Social Analysis\na. Poverty\n109. Based on the ADB analysis of the 1997-98 Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey,\nabout  47  percent of the  population  are  poor and 25 percent  are  very  poor;  in  the  northern\nprovinces about 62 percent are poor and 38 percent are very poor. The very poor are those with a\nlower consumption equivalent than the cost of a basic food package. In particular, this includes\nsingle parents, parents with many young children, and families with chronically ill or disabled\npersons and drug addicts. For poor families, any loss of labor leads systematically to the reduction\nof the family\u2019s production capacity and, consequently, food shortage and impoverishment. The very\npoor  are  not  primarily  determined  by  location  and  ethnic  group,  but  by  the  socioeconomic\nconditions of the household. Thus, very poor families may be found in any village and this must be\ntaken into account in planning and financing health care.\n110. The Project will directly address poverty by (i) operating in areas mainly populated by poor\nethnic minorities; (ii) focusing on the provision of basic services at the village level where the poor\nare  more  likely to  capture  the benefits of Government  subsidies;  (iii)  selectively  investing  in\nservices  that  directly  support  PHC;  (iv) addressing  diseases  such  as  diarrhea,  micronutrient\ndeficiencies, and  malaria,  which disproportionately  affect  the  poor;  and  (v) identifying,  setting\ntargets, and monitoring the Project\u2019s impact on the very poor through village committees and\nsurveys. It is expected that 75 percent of the project beneficiaries will be poor or very poor.\n111. The Project will also seek to increase equity by (i) making cost recovery more transparent,\nefficient and equitable in hospitals, (ii) introducing a revolving drug fund at village  level  with\narrangements to make health care affordable for the poor, (iii) testing risk pooling through a pilot\nprepayment  system,  (iv)  retaining  revenue  from  cost  recovery  for  improving  the  affordability,\nefficiency and quality of services, (v) increasing the role of communities in assisting the very poor,\nand (vi) targeting a larger share of Government resources for services to benefit the poor.\nb. Ethnic Minorities\n112. Ethnic minorities constitute about 34 percent of the population overall and 60 percent of the\npopulation in the northern provinces. The first component of the Project, because of its focus on\naccess, will mainly be targeting ethnic minorities. The Project will locate facilities near underserved\nethnic minorities, provide scholarships for training of auxiliary nurses or equivalent staff belonging\nto ethnic minorities, post at least one person speaking the local language in each health facility,\nand increase outreach services and support VHPs in remote ethnic minority villages. Studies are\nbeing conducted to determine if there are specific cultural perceptions regarding health and health\nservices that inhibit adequate levels of health care among minorities.24 Affordability problems exist\nin most ethnic communities, although the coping mechanisms vary. To overcome the cash flow\nproblem for medical care, a postpayment system is being tested by a GTZ-supported project and\nmay become available for replication. However, informal postpayment systems already exist, and\n                                                       \n24 TA 5794-REG: Study of Health and Education Needs of Ethnic Minorities in the Greater Mekong Region, for $800,000,\napproved on 30 Jun 98.", "27\ncould be facilitated by providing subsidized drugs. Adequate stocks of drugs should be provided to\nremote ethnic communities before the rainy season, when access deteriorates. Each province will\nidentify priorities for ethnic minorities and incorporate these in the provincial project implementation\nplan. The social analysis and ethnic minorities strategy are in Appendix 12.\nc.  Gender\n113. The TA identified major issues concerning women\u2019s health knowledge, immunization, use of\nservices, health behavior, and literacy  rates.  The Project  will address  women\u2019s health through\nspecific targeted services such as prenatal care, obstetrical care, birth spacing, and treatment of\nobstetrical complications and reproductive tract infections. Family health improvements resulting from\nthe Project are expected to benefit women by reducing the time spent caring for family members.\nAlso, the Project will endeavor to select women as VHPs, volunteers, and trainees to become a\nhealth staff. Very few women from some ethnic minorities have basic education, and scholarships will\nbe available to provide them with additional basic education before technical training. Health centers\nhave been designed to provide privacy for women during examination and treatment, and gender\nissues will be incorporated in the training courses. Women\u2019s use of health services will be monitored\nwith specific indicators. The project management will also seek to appoint female staff.\nd. Stakeholder Participation\n114. Stakeholders were extensively consulted and involved during the preparation of the Project.\nResults of group discussions with beneficiaries in catchment areas of the first ADB health sector\nloan in the Lao PDR were used in the project design. This information was supplemented with a\nhousehold  survey  in  11  provinces,  which provided  data  on  health  service  availability,  health\nseeking  behaviors,  and  financing  of  health  events.  Major  PHC  projects  in  the  country  were\nreviewed  in  detail  and  discussions  were  held  with  external  funding  agency  representatives\nconcerning project management issues, supervision, project evaluation, and lessons learned. An\nMOH team visited the provinces where the Project will be implemented, consulted with local\nofficials, and conducted a detailed needs assessment. Finally, MOH provided substantial guidance\nfor the project design through the MOH steering committee and otherwise.\n115. During implementation of the Project, the beneficiaries will participate in four ways: (i) in the\nselection of sites and the construction of health centers; (ii) in identifying and following up priorities\nfor village health care and promotion; (iii) in selecting and monitoring VHPs and volunteers; and\n(iv) in making arrangements for health care for the very poor. Project evaluation will obtain the\nviews of beneficiaries through focus group discussions and surveys.\ne. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n116. Benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) will play an important role in the success of the\nProject by helping it to remain focused on achievable goals and monitor progress. In keeping with\nADB\u2019s Handbook on BME, the Project has (i) collected benchmarks, (ii) planned additional studies\nfor analysis and to obtain beneficiary perceptions, (iii) selected a short list of verifiable indicators for\nmonitoring and evaluation, and (iv) planned surveys for impact assessment. A summary is in\nAppendix 13.\n117. A set of indicators has been selected to evaluate achievements of the Project. Those\nindicators will be collected through health facility surveys, village surveys, and households surveys\ncarried out on a scale large enough to allow provincial comparison. The household surveys will\ninclude two nonproject provinces for comparison. Key indicators will be disaggregated by a wealth\nindex to determine whether project benefits are reaching the poor. The chief technical adviser and\na domestic monitoring and evaluation consultant will supervise project evaluation. Data collection", "28\nwill be carried out by the implementing agency, and analysis and reporting will be the responsibility\nof the consultants.\n118. Routine monitoring and supervision will use a standardized health information system that\nwill be developed under the Project for use in all PHC projects in the Lao PDR. The information\nsystem will track project inputs and service processes and outputs, aggregated by district. The\nsupervision system will track performance and quality of service at all levels using a standardized\nchecklist of indicators. Client satisfaction will be monitored through surveys, supervision visits, and\ngroup discussions. The PMO will have overall responsibility for data collection, analysis, and\nreporting to all interested parties, including ADB.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analysis\n119. The economic rationale for public intervention in PHC service is strong: public intervention\nprovides substantial externalities, compensates for market failure by informational imperfection,\nallows risk pooling, and provides a safety net for the poor. Many studies, including a 1993 World\nBank  study25,  confirm  a  significant positive  relationship  between  health  status  and  economic\nproductivity. Improvements in the health status of the poor will increase their incomes by improving\nthe productivity of workers, reducing the occurrence of catastrophic illnesses that leave them\ndestitute, and allowing children to learn more and thereby enjoy higher productivity and future\nearnings.\n120. The  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  significantly  to  poverty  reduction.  The  targeted\nprovinces have the high poverty incidence of 62 percent compared with the national average of 47\npercent,  and  ethnic  minorities  comprise  60  percent  of  the  population  in  these  provinces.\nFurthermore, the Project is likely to benefit the poor more than this number indicates, because the\npoor are more prone to common communicable diseases and use services as much as others.\nWhile the Project will service all segments of the population in the project provinces, the poor are\nexpected to receive a high proportion of the benefits by reducing their cost for health services and\nbenefiting most from these services. Within the targeted populations, the Project will mostly benefit\nwomen and children, who suffer most from disease and malnutrition. The Project will focus on\nservices that benefit women and children, in particular reproductive health services including birth\nspacing. Reproductive health services help to improve survival of mothers and children; reduce\npoverty; and improve nutrition, learning capacity, and educational opportunities for children.\n121. The Project will improve the efficiency of PHC service delivery in rural areas of the Lao\nPDR by (i) rationalizing the spatial distribution of staff and physical facilities, (ii)  providing services\nthat are either public goods or have large positive externalities, (iii) enabling partnership at the\ngrassroots level with VHPs, and (iv) focusing resources on expansion of the PHC network to\ninclude cost-effective interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality. Cost-effectiveness analysis\nindicates that the cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) 26 saved is $21 following a favorable\nscenario, and $48 following an unfavorable scenario. This is well within the range of $75 per DALY\nsaved for priority interventions listed in ADB\u2019s Policy for the Health Sector. See Appendix 14 for\ndetails.\n122. Expanding access and introducing new facilities and services under the Project raises the\nissue of whether these developments can be financially sustained after the Project is completed.\nUpon completion of the physical investments, the average annual recurrent expenditure needed to\nsustain the Project activities is estimated at $245,500, to (i) maintain buildings, equipment, and\n                                                       \n25 World Bank. Lao PDR Social Development Assessment Strategy, Report No. 13992-LA. 1995. Washington DC.\n26\nThe DALY is a composite index of the years of healthy life lost due to morbidity, mortality and disability, and the\nbenefits that can be achieved by saving lost years.", "29\nvehicles; and (ii) supervise health care workers at rural health units and VHPs. This amount is\nestimated to be about 8 percent of the annual Government recurrent expenditure on the health\nsector. Given the overall significance of externally assisted projects in health sector investments in\nthe Lao PDR, the overall prospect for sustainability is favorable. Also MOH has committed to\nallocate more budget to promotive and preventive services, although the risk of macroeconomic\ninstability  will  be  beyond  the  control  of  MOH.  The  provincial  governments  have  agreed  to\ncontribute financially to the Project, in particular for civil works construction and maintenance, and\nrecurrent costs of MCH services. Because some provinces will have difficulty generating  the\nrequired financial inflows through cost recovery efforts, the central MOH will have to reallocate\nbudgetary resources among the provinces.\n123. The Project employs specific mechanisms to increase financial sustainability: (i) increased\nrevenue from cost recovery from those who can afford to pay for the services, through more\naccurate pricing of services based on total costs of goods and service provision; (ii) increased cost\nrecovery from more accurate replacement cost pricing to keep up with inflation for drugs and other\nmedical consumables; (iii) partnerships with VHPs for revolving funds with full replacement cost\npricing for those who can afford the payment; (iv) increased cost recovery revenue from the pricing\nof hospital services that currently are not routinely charged to patients; (v) increased retention of\ncost recovery revenue by exempting the public health sector revenue from taxes; (vi) increased\nrevenue from a provincial subscription system; and (vii) Government assurances that public health\nsubsidies will not decrease in real terms in the future.\nB. Environment\n124. The Project will have a beneficial environmental impact through its contribution to reducing\nrural population growth by reducing the number of people depending on slash-and-burn cultivation\nand exploitation of the forest. Health education on sanitation and waste disposal is also expected\nto improve living conditions, reduce pests, and contain the spread of common diseases such as\nmalaria.\nC. Social Dimensions and Poverty Impact\n125. Over 85 percent of the Lao PDR population resides in the rural areas, with 90 percent of\nincome-earning adults depending on agriculture for their livelihood. According to the social analysis\ndone during the TA, most families in the villages in the project provinces in the north are poor\nsubsistence farmers, who live below or near the poverty line. They depend on subsistence farming\nfor their survival, which in turn depends heavily on the availability of a healthy labor force in the\nfamily. Any serious disease or death in the family may throw the family into deep poverty. Half of\nwomen in the project provinces in the north could not read and that there are periodic food\nshortages. Access to basic amenities is low in the Lao PDR, with only 49 percent of the rural\npopulation having access to clean water, 32 percent having access to latrines, and 28 percent of\nhouseholds have electricity for lighting (footnote 9).\n126. The TA household survey found that the average total monthly household expenditure for\nhealth care is about KN33,000, or about KN400,000 per year. On an annual per capita basis, this\namount represents about $7.50 per person per year, or 2.5 percent of the total annual per capita\nexpenditures, which suggests that health care is affordable for  most families  if  there  are  no\ncatastrophic illnesses in the family. Improved health and better access to PHC services will reduce\nthese direct expenditures on health care, decrease the indirect costs associated with seeking\nhealth  care,  decrease  workdays  lost  due  to  disease,  and  increase  productivity.  Savings  in\nhousehold expenditures will help reduce food shortages and impoverishment.\n127. The Project will improve primary care of about 0.9 million people in 34 districts and improve\nreferral services for 1.7 million people living in the eight northern provinces by helping to provide\nPHC consisting of proven high impact, cost-effective services. The interventions will benefit mostly", "30\nthe poor, women, children, and ethnic minorities by easing their large burdens of disease. Based\non the DALY lost due to mortality, morbidity, and disability, the Project will reduce more than 30\npercent of the burden of disease for women and children. For example, the Project will address\n(i) maternal  emergency  conditions  such  as  hemorrhage,  sepsis,  and  obstructed  labor;  and\n(ii) facilitate immunizations for childhood diseases and treatment of malaria and acute respiratory\ninfections, and thereby have a significant impact on MCH status. The Project will protect children\nduring  a  vulnerable  time  in  their  lives,  thus  improving  their  intellectual  and  psychomotor\ndevelopment and consequently increasing the returns to investments in education. In addition, the\nProject will address problems that affect the health status of all members of the population, such as\ndiarrhea, respiratory infections, malaria, and sexually transmitted diseases. Improved health status\nof the adult working population from these interventions will lead to increased productivity.\nD. Institutional Sustainability\n128. Many agencies and NGOs are conducting a wide variety of PHC activities at every level of\nthe network. The Project will build capacity at the central, provincial, and district levels to plan,\ncoordinate and monitor PHC activities. The Project will also support planning for further expansion\nof the PHC network, in accordance with the PHC policy guidelines, strategic framework, and\ninvestment to be developed with the help of the proposed advisory TA for Capacity Building for\nPHC.\n129. The  Project  will  train  managerial  staff  in  financial  management,  procurement,  and\ninternational accounting standards; help set up a PHC coordination unit in each province to focus\non key issues such as planning and budgeting, in-service training, and supervision and integration\nof PHC services; and standardize management procedures and systems to improve efficiency and\ncoordination  of  the PHC  network  at  all  levels.  The  assistance  to  PHC  coordination  includes\n(i) office renovation and equipment, information systems, and vehicles for supervision of PHC\nactivities;  (ii) standardization  and  implementation  of  PHC  management  information  systems\nincluding health information and cost recovery reporting systems; (iii) PHC management training;\nand (iv) testing of innovative approaches to PHC financing. Through these activities, the Project\nwill improve PHC coordination and management, and enhance sustainability of the Government\u2019s\nactivities in the PHC sector.\nE. Risks\n130. Four Project-related risks could affect implementation of the Project and sustainability of its\nbenefits.\n131. Financial Management. The first PHC project was affected by inadequate delegation of\nfinancial management authority, but succeeded in streamlining financial management procedures.\nMOH will be given increased financial management authority, including management of the project\nimprest account.\n132. Procurement Capacity. The capacity for procurement procedures of goods and services in\nMOH is still weak. The Project will set up a procurement unit and will have consultants to assist\nwith procurement. The Project will also assist MOH to improve general procurement capacity in\nMOH.\n133. Staff for Health Centers. While there is excess health staff, they are underpaid and\ngenerally not willing to be relocated to places where they can not generate additional income. The\nGovernment has agreed to provide incentives for staff to be relocated, and is  considering a\nproposal for a hardship allowance to be paid to staff posted in remote locations. In addition, the\nGovernment has agreed to increase training of persons from ethnic minorities to work within their\ncommunities.", "31\n134. Financial Constraints. The Government is in a tight fiscal situation, although its long-term\neconomic prospects are good. This may affect counterpart funding and financial sustainability. The\nproposed expansion of the network of health facilities has been rationalized in view of the recurrent\ncost implications. A financial plan has been prepared examining counterpart fund requirements\nincluding the provincial contributions, and recurrent cost requirements in comparison to public\nhealth sector expenditures after project completion.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n135. The Government has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard assurances\nthat will be incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  The Government will have established provincial PHC coordination units or have\nmade other arrangements to ensure strong provincial PHC coordination within one\nyear of the effective date of the loan.\n(ii)  The targeted provinces  will  prepare  annual operational  plans for  the  provincial\nhealth sector, including budgets identifying sources and uses of funds.\n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the health budget for the targeted provinces will be\nmaintained at the level of fiscal year 2000 or increased in real terms, and that the\nprovincial health sector budgets will allocate sufficient funds for the recurrent costs\nresulting from the Project, in particular for MCH and birth spacing services.\n(iv)  Within two years of the loan effectiveness date, the Government will issue new cost\nrecovery guidelines that make provision of services affordable for the very poor.\n(v)  The Government will ensure that counterpart funds, including from the provinces,\nare available in time and according to the estimates agreed upon with the MOH\nsteering committee each year as per the project implementation plan.\n(vi)  Within six months of the effective date of the loan, MOH will have established a\nproject  procurement  unit  and  developed  guidelines  to  streamline  procurement\nprocedures and guarantee timely arrival of goods and services in accordance with\nthe project implementation plan.\n(vii)  The targeted provinces will prepare a comprehensive plan for all new and renovated\nhealth facilities including a maintenance plan prior to the commencement of the\nconstruction, and ensure that this plan is implemented during and after project\nimplementation.\n(viii)  The provinces will ensure that any unavoidable involuntary resettlement and land\nacquisition by the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB policies and\nguidelines.\n(ix)  The Government will ensure that proper waste disposal is included in the design of\nhealth facilities. Refuse handling and disposal measures for hazardous medical\nwaste such as syringes and needles will be specifically addressed in the design and\noperation of health facilities.\n(x)  The provinces will ensure that for all new health facilities to be constructed, a\nstaffing plan is available and approved prior to commencement of construction. In\nparticular,  they  will  ensure  that  construction  of  health  centers  to  serve  ethnic\nminorities will not start before a person from the local ethnic minority has been\nidentified as a proposed staff member for the facility, and has started training.", "32\n(xi)  Within one year of the loan effectiveness date, the Government will have identified\ncandidate trainees, particularly from ethnic minorities, to participate in the training\nprogram that will impart skills equivalent to those of auxiliary nurses. Within two\nyears of the loan effectiveness date, training will have started in each of the project\nprovinces and the Government will have developed a staffing plan that will include\nthe placement of trainees, especially of ethnic minorities who have completed the\ntraining program.\n(xii)  ADB may request the Government to arrange for an independent audit, either local\nor international, to be financed from loan proceeds.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n136. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB and\nrecommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing\nRights 14,956,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Primary Health Care Expansion\nProject, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at\nthe rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and\nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft\nLoan Agreement presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n31 July 2000", "33\nAPPENDIXES\nNo. Title                     Page      Cited on\n                                     (page, para.)\n         \n1  Project Framework              34            1,    2\n2  Key Indicators     37            3,    7\n3  Major External Assistance in the Lao PDR     38            9,   38\nHealth Sector\n4  Primary Health Care Packages 40          14,   59\n5 Indicative Training Plan   42          16,   65\n         19,   82\n6 Project Organization     45          18,   78\n7 Cost Estimates and Financing Plan     46          21,   90\n8 Project Implementation Schedule     49          23,   97\n9 Civil Works Summary         51          23,   99\n10 Equipment, Drugs, and Supplies           52          24, 100\n11 Indicative Terms of Reference of Consultants  54          24, 101\n12 Social Analysis and Ethnic Minorities Strategy 57          27, 112\n13 Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation     66          27, 116\n14 Economic Analysis 69          28, 121\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available upon request)\nSupplementary Appendix: A: Lessons learned\nSupplementary Appendix B: Indicative List of Equipment, Drugs, and Supplies\nSupplementary Appendix C: Civil Works Plan\nSupplementary Appendix D: Terms of Reference of Government Counterparts\nSupplementary Appendix E: Short Resettlement and Land Acquisition Plan", "34\nAppendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Project Targets Monitoring Assumptions and Risks\n(Verifiable Indicators) Mechanisms\nGoal: In six years:\nTo improve the health (cid:132) infant mortality rate reduced (cid:132)  Household survey (cid:132) Political stability.\nstatus of the people in from 104 to 75/1,000 live births, (cid:132)  Population census (cid:132) Positive socioeconomic\nthe Lao People\u2019s (cid:132) infant mortality rate among poor (cid:132)  Evaluation development.\nDemocratic Republic reduced from 140 to 100/1,000 (cid:132) Supportive policy\nbased on equity, live births, environment.\nparticipation, and (cid:132) maternal mortality ratio reduced (cid:132) Continuing institutional\nsustainability. from 490 to 355 per 100,000 capacity development.\nlive births, (cid:132) Maternal mortality ratio\n(cid:132) primary health care (PHC) measures trends, and is not\nmanagement is integrated, and an appropriate indicator to\n(cid:132) public PHC pending increased measure project impact.\nby 50 percent  in real terms.\nObjective/Purpose:\nTo improve the PHC (cid:132) Use of health facilities doubled (cid:132)  Household survey (cid:132) Targets include inputs from\ncoverage, in particular of for poor (cid:132)  Health facility other programs and\nwomen and infants, the (cid:132) Recall of key facts about checks and exit agencies.\npoor, and ethnic malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, interviews (cid:132) Project reaches targeted\nminorities in northern nutrition, immunization, (cid:132)  Household survey population and obtains\nareas.

Ethnic Groups in the Population\n1. The current population of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is estimated\nat about 5.2 million people, with a low population density of 21 people per square kilometer. The\n1995  census  categorizes  the  population  into  47  different  ethnic  groups,  classified  in  four\nlinguistic groups. These are the Tai-Kadai including the Lao, Phutai, and Leu (66.2 percent); the\nAustro-Asiatic  group  of  Mon-Kmer  and  Viet-Muang  (23.0  percent);  the  Hmong-Yao  (7.4\npercent); and the Tibeto-Burman and Hor Han (2.7). All those not belonging to the Tai-Kadai\nlanguage group are considered as ethnic minorities. They comprise about 60 percent of the total\npopulation of 1.7 million in the eight targeted provinces, as shown in Table A12.1. Vientiane\nProvince is added for comparison.\nTable A12.1: Ethnic Groups by Province\nProvince Proportion of Ethnic Groups in Province Proportion\nEthnic\nMinorities\nPhongsali Lao 4,3; Phutai 5,3; Leu 8,9; Kor 20; Phounoy 19,4;    81,5\nKmu 24,4; Yao 3,3; Ho 4,7 Others 9,7\nLouang Namtha Leu 15,8; Phutai 12,6; Lao 2,3; Kmu 24,7; Kor 24; Yao    69,3\n3,3; Hmong 4,4; Others 12,9\nOudomxai Kmu 58; Hmong 13.1; Leu 12.2; Others 16.7    83.5\nBokeo Kmu 23,8; Leu 20.6; Nhuan 4,6; Lao 13.4; Hmong    42,2\n10,1; Lamet 10,8, Mousseu 6,2 Others 23,9\nLouang Phrabang Kmu 45.9; Lao 28.6; Phutai 4,8; Leu 3,1 Hmong 15.2,    63,5\nOthers 2,4\nHouaphan Phutai 31.5, Lao 30, Hmong 20.3, Kmu 10,6 Others    38,5\n7,6\nXieng Khouang Lao 44.3, Hmong 34.2, Phutai 10.2; Others 11.3    45,5\nSayaburi Leu 26.9, Kmu 20; Lao 19, Others 34.1    54,1\nVientiane Province Lao 63,8; Phutai 14; Hmong 7,6; Kmu 12,5; Others 2,1    22,2\nSource: National Census. 1995.\nB. Profile of Ethnic Groups\n2. The National Statistic Census 1995 indicates that the Tai-Kadai group is better off than\nthe  other  language  groups.  The  Mon-Kmer  are  considered  poor,  and  the  Tibeto-Burman\npopulation very poor. However, dividing populations by ethnic group and place of living masks\nthe large variety of cultures and social organizations within these groups. Several clans, while\nliving  in  remote  mountains,  are  well  organized,  opportunistic,  and  better  off.  Table  A12.2\nprovides a generalized profile of the four ethnic groups.\n3. The Tai-Kadai is the leading group and mostly live in the south and center plains of the\nMekong River and its contributors. In addition to having rainfed terraces provide a staple rice\nsupply, they engage in cash crops production, raising animals, weaving, basket making, and\nsewing. They also dominate the civil service and the commercial sector and make up a large\npart of the urban population. Migrants from surrounding countries tend to settle in urban areas\nto engage in commercial and skilled labor activities.", "58\nAppendix 12, page 2\n4. The Mon-Khmer represent the traditional inhabitants of the Lao PDR. They usually live\non the slopes of mountains, in forests and valleys. They have a more traditional lifestyle of\nshifting cultivation, hunting, and collecting forest products for their own consumption. If food\nbecomes inadequate or cash is required, they will work as casual laborer for the Lao in the rice\nfields. The shifting cultivation they practice allows for the forest to regenerate, and usually does\nnot require resettlement. However, resettlement may follow an outbreak of malaria or diarrhea.\nMost Mon-Kmer are animists and the forests play an important role in their spiritual world.\nTable A12.2: Socioeconomic Profile of Ethnic Minorities in the Lao PDR\nGroups Main Location Economic Activities and Literacy Cultural\nand Access Status Rate Characteristic\nTai-Kadai Lowland: plains Mostly settled farmers 72.9 Buddhists and\nof  Mekong with rice and cash crops, nonreligious\nRiver and commercial and off farm groups, living in\ncontributors and activities. large villages with\nmain roads Generally less poor. modern lifestyle\nHmong- Upland: Most practice migrant 36.9 Animists.

The Hmong-Yao have mainly settled at high altitude in the northern mountains. They are\na relatively better off group. They engage in agricultural and off farm activities, and produce dry\nrice, maize, ginger, poppy, pigs, and clothes. The Hmong usually practice an environmentally\nharmful shifting cultivation that forces them to move to a new location. Many Hmong families\nreceive  overseas  remittances  from  relatives  who  migrated  to  the  United  States.  The\nGovernment is trying to resettle Hmong villages by building social services in new locations.\n6. The Tibeto-Burman groups, most of whom also live at higher altitude, are considered the\npoorest. In addition to slash and burn cultivation, hunting and collection of forest products,\npoverty has increasingly driven them out of isolation and into the marginal commercial activities\nof towns such as selling firewood. They are few in number and many of these ethnic groups are\nlikely to disappear within the next decades.", "59\nAppendix 12, page 3\nC. Distribution of Poverty\n7. In a 1995 study, the Word Bank estimated that 46 percent of the Lao PDR population\nlives below the poverty line of $14 per month, and 27 percent lives below a second poverty line\nand can be classified as very poor. The study suggests that poverty in the northern area is\nslightly less than in the south, but recent developments suggest that the south is more rapidly\ndeveloping than the north. The environment of the population determines to a large extent their\nliving conditions, agricultural productivity, access to services, and development potential. Most\nof the ethnic minorities are located in poorly accessible areas and have less access to services,\nas reflected in their education and health status.\n8. However, an analysis of a household survey by level of poverty, defined as rice shortage\nduring the last year, indicated that poverty is not confined to remote villages or villages of ethnic\nminorities.  This  confirms  village  studies  suggesting  that  every  village,  whether  remote  or\naccessible, has poor households, and that poverty is linked to social conditions (addiction,\nsingle parent, age profile, relatives overseas) and land and labor availability in the individual\nhouseholds. Each village is likely to have some households that cannot produce enough and\nare trapped in poverty and lack of food.  An effort to reach the very poor would therefore need to\ntarget individual households, in addition to some specific and small ethnic minorities.\nD. Health Needs\n9. According to the national statistic census of 1995, the infant mortality rate is 104 deaths\nper 1,000 live births. The north has the highest infant, child, and maternal mortality rates; and\nthe lowest life expectancy rate. For example, Louang Phrabang province with a 45 percent Mon-\nKmer people, has an infant mortality rate of 132 infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared to\n72 for Vientiane Municipality. Table A12.3 illustrates the major differences in infant and child\nmortality among different socioeconomic groups. It suggests major differences in child health\nstatus between income, education, and ethnic groups.\n10. The maternal mortality ratio in Louang Namtha was 1,595 per 100,000 live births in\n1995, implying that the lifetime risk of a woman dying of complications of pregnancy and\nchildbirth is one in 10. About three fourths of deaths occur within six weeks of delivery, and one\nfourth during pregnancy. Emergency care is often delayed for people living in the hills, as they\nhave poor access to referral services, in particular during the rainy season. The importance of\ncultural and financial factors affecting referral is not clear. While birth spacing is practiced by 23\npercent of couples, there is a high demand for birth spacing services.\n11. Malaria, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections are the major causes of\nmortality and morbidity in the Lao PDR. Epidemiological variations are associated with the\naltitude at which people live, with diarrheal diseases being more common in the lowland, and\nrespiratory infections in the highlands, in particular among the Hmong-Mien and Tibeto-Burman\ngroups.  Malaria  causes  high  mortality  among  children  and  pregnant  women  in  all  rural\npopulations. About one third of Lao households experience insufficient food intake. According to\na United Nations Children\u2019s Fund survey, 41 percent of children are undernourished, and 12\npercent are severely malnourished. The risk of malnutrition peaks at 18-23 months.

National Statistics Center.\nE. Health Demands\n12. Differences in health status are associated with variations in living conditions and social\nservices. Table A12.4 suggests that the incidence of illness among ethnic groups is not so\ndifferent, but that there are major variations in the coverage of essential services, likely resulting\nin different outcomes. Modern curative care is generally accepted and used if available, except\namong some remote living populations. Demand for preventive services is still lower among\nethnic  minorities, perhaps  due  to  less  awareness  about  their  benefits.  However,  with  the\nexception of contraception, the use of preventive services is equally distributed among the poor\nand nonpoor. Available data show some variations in the demand for health services among\nethnic groups. For example, there is more demand for birth spacing and treated mosquito\nnetting  among  Mon-Khmer  groups.  The  Hmong-Yao  give  higher  priority  to  the  local\nmanagement of infections. Iodine supplementation is given high  priority among  the  Tibeto\nBurman group.\nTable A12.4: Coverage of Health Education and Services among Ethnic Groups\nTai- Mon- Hmong- Tibeto\nIndicator Kadai Kmer Mien Burman\nMonthly illness incidence 7 12 9 10\nChildren 12-23 months fully immunized 38 8 7 21\nWomen 15-49 yrs who had two doses of TT 65 51 12 38\nChildren under-five who received two capsules 38 18 15 37\nof vitamin A in the last year\nWomen who know about treatment of diarrhea 14 8 3 4\nat home\nWomen who know at least one contraceptive 45 23 7 11\nmethod\nWomen not able to read a simple sentence 20 51 87 77\nPersons using a bed net at night 98 72 43 44\nSource: Project Preparatory Technical Assistance Household Survey.", "61\nAppendix 12, page 5\n13. Sociocultural Barriers. These are reasons for not attending public health services.\nIsolated minorities have strong traditional cultural beliefs about ill health and its causes, and\nprefer the intervention of spiritual healers for many of their health problems. These beliefs vary\namong ethnic minorities and need to be identified and understood in each situation before\ninterventions can be planned for. Because of strong belief systems, modern health services for\ncertain isolated communities are more difficult to implement. In terms of social barriers, there\nare major language barriers for females of the Hmong-Yao, Mon-Khmer, and Tibeto Burman\ngroups who do not speak Lao while most staff are of Lao origin and do not speak the local\nlanguage. This barrier could be overcome by selecting local persons to be trained as a health\nworker. There is no evidence of major gender differences in accessing services, but privacy of\ncare for women and the presence of female staff are important.\n14. Travel and Opportunity Costs. Access is a major determinant for the use of services\nbecause of the cost of transportation, overnight stay, and lost labor. Improving access will\ndisproportionally benefit ethnic minorities and the poor, as new facilities would be placed where\nno services are currently available. Physical access in using health services is illustrated in\nTable A12.5. Ethnic minorities have less access to health centers and district headquarters\nwhich have emergency services. The Hmong-Yao and Tibeto Burman groups, about 25 percent\nof the targeted population, have least access to basic health services, as they often live more\nthan a day\u2019s travel from a health facility. At the same time, it is not cost-effective to construct a\nlarge number of health centers. The facilities will therefore need to be strategically located to\nachieve  maximum  benefit.  The  villagers  are  also  requesting  reactivation  of  former  health\nworkers living in the villages. While nongovernment organizations have been successful in\ndoing this, it needs to be explored if the Government can support such services.\nTable A12.5: Access to Health Services (percent)\nTai- Mon- Hmong- Tibeto\nIndicator Kadai Kmer Mien Burman\nPersons using a government facility first when 46 22 23 18\nsick\nVillages accessible by road 87 53 35 50\nVillages within 4 hrs of district headquarter 85 66 45 47\nVillages within 1 hr of health center 62 33 9 16\nVillages within 1 hr of private pharmacy 79 48 13 26\nVillages having a village health provider 96 80 74 56\n15. Cost Recovery. Affordability is a major constraint to the use of health services. The\nhousehold  survey did not find  major  differences  in  health  seeking behavior  among  ethnic\nminorities, and poor and nonpoor, but it did find major differences in expenditure for illness,\nwhich may suggest a difference in quality of care. The poorest household quartile spend an\nestimated $2.4 per month, compared to $4.2 by the second quartile, $5.0 for the third quartile,\nand $5.5 for the wealthiest group. However, 55 percent of poor households did not have enough\nmoney to pay for health care when a household member became seriously ill compared to 26\npercent in the nonpoor group (Table A12.6). Most hospitals have an informal arrangement to\nsubsidize services for those who cannot afford these, but it is not clear to what extent this is\nadequate. At health center and village levels, staff are reluctant to give discount for drugs to the\nvery poor, as it would be difficult to manage pressures from others for discounted drug prices.", "62\nAppendix 12, page 6\nTable A12.6: Affordability of Health Services (percent)\nTai- Mon- Hmong- Tibeto\nIndicator Kadai Kmer Mien Burman\nHouseholds making health expenditure during 45 57 41 33\nlast month\nVillages with a mutual fund 76 52 23 22\nSource: Project Preparatory Technical Assistance. Household Survey.\n16. The introduction of cost recovery for drugs has increased outpatient utilization, except by\ncivil servants. The reason is that drugs became available. For the Lao-Phoutai, the price of\ndrugs  and treatment  is  an  important  determinant  in  the  choice  between  public  or  private\nservices where both are available. The price of drugs and treatment may also affect the choice\nbetween modern treatment and traditional healing. Modern treatment may be more of a problem\nfor the Mon-Khmer and Tibeto Burman who are poorer, and for the very poor in most villages.\nMany patients may not be able to afford inpatient care on the basis of full cost recovery. Many\npatients will not have enough cash to pay for services in an emergency. Hence, the Government\nhas  an  important  role  to  ensure  that  inpatient  care  for  catastrophic  illnesses  such  as\ncomplications of pregnancy and childbirth are available and affordable for the poor.\n17. Community Support. Hospital staff use an informal system to determine whether a\npatient should receive subsidized care or not. This is more difficult at health center level, as\nhealth center staff are concerned that many patients will demand subsidized care and will\ncomplain if they do not receive it. Besides, it will be difficult for health staff to determine who is\nvery poor. The most viable option at present seems to be to make the community responsible\nfor  identifying  and  supporting  the  very  poor,  in  return  for  Government  subsidy  for  the\ncommunity. However, the tradition of communities supporting their members appears to vary.\nThe Tai-Kadai and Mon-Kmer often receive support from family members for health care, while\nthe  Hmong-Mien  and  Tibeto-Burman  depend  more  on  the  sale  of  household  goods.  The\nHmong-Mien and Tibeto-Burman groups also have less access to mutual funds than the Tai-\nKadai and Mon-Kmer. This suggests that community support for the very poor may be more\ndifficult  to  organize  among  the  Hmong-Mien  and  the  Tibeto  Burman  groups.  In  some\ncommunities, an informal mutual fund or credit system is used to allow households to pay later\nfor services, allowing time to arrange for contributions from relatives or sale of livestock or other\nassets. Formalizing such a system is being studied in Borikhamxai Province with the help of the\nGerman Technical Cooperation (GTZ). In this pilot project, the village committees were asked to\nlook after the very poor and make adjustments for inflation. Despite high inflation and high level\nof poverty in some villages, most village committees managed to do so.\n18. Community Perceptions. In 1998, a study documented the perceptions of local leaders\nand community health workers regarding the quality of care at public health centers. The study\nwas carried out in two northern provinces, Xieng Khouang and Oudomxai, with 70 percent\nethnic minorities. Out of 1,762 households interviewed in 97 villages, 62 percent were using a\npublic health center. Patients using the facilities indicated that, as they travel for a long distance,\nit is important that the health center has drugs available. The price of drugs was generally\nacceptable, being less than from private sources. The proportion of patients unable to pay for\ndrugs at a health center is believed to be small, and those who do not have the cash are\ngenerally allowed to pay later. Thirty one percent of the patients reported that they did not\nalways find staff at the health center. Health workers were generally polite to patients (85\npercent). No cases of informal payments were reported. Local leaders were asked what they\nwould like to see improved in the health centers. A summary of recommendations is in Table\nA12.7.", "63\nAppendix 12, page 7\nTable A12.7: Recommendations of Local Leaders to Improve the Quality of Services\nServices 24  hour  services;  outreach  services  for  pregnant  women  and  birth  spacing;\nprivacy for delivery; promotion of healthy lifestyle; and advice on pit latrines.\nStaff At least one better trained staff in a health center; health workers with hill-tribe\nbackground; female workers for family planning services.\nFacilities Better water supply, and more space for inpatient care\nDrugs A larger variety of drugs; drugs for emergencies; syrups for children; clear drug\npricing guidelines; reduced drug prices; proper instructions on the use the drugs.\nSource: ADB PHC Project. Perception of Health Services Survey. 1998.\n19. Staff  Perceptions.  Health  workers  were asked  in  structured  interviews  about  their\nperceptions. Of 27 health workers interviewed, 18 were willing to remain or stay longer in the\nhealth facility. More than half the health workers were satisfied with living conditions. The\nreasons mentioned were (i) living in own area, (ii) local authorities provide strong support,\n(iii) provision of land and house, (iv) expecting to get employment (for contract workers), and\n(v) community appreciation. About 20 percent of health workers indicated they faced difficulty in\nthe health center. Reasons given were (i) lack of notification and information about the length of\nthe  assignment,  (ii)  not  being  from  the  area,  (iii)  lack  of  attention  from  local  authorities,\n(iv) family problems, (v) lack of refresher training, (vi) the health center being far way from any\ncommunity, (vii) no rewards for working in a remote and difficult location, and (viii) the land\nprovided  not  being  arable.  Most  health  workers  agreed  that  outreach  activities  are  very\nimportant, but only 9 of 27 health workers had done these, and only 3 of them regularly.\nReasons for not going on outreach are heavy workload, lack of staff to run the health center,\nand discomfort with doing a field visit alone.\nF. Ethnic Minorities Strategy\n20. The Project proposes four strategies to increase access of ethnic minorities to PHC:\n(i)  increasing physical access by targeting ethnic minority populations,\n(ii)  making services appropriate to the needs of the ethnic minorities,\n(iii)  making services socially acceptable through training and participation, and\n(iv)  improving affordability of services through new financing arrangements.\n.\n21. Accessible Services. The Project is aiming to expand primary health care (PHC) in the\nnorthern region, where ethnic minorities constitute about 60 percent of the population. This is\nthe poorest region in the country. Extensive mapping of communities and services is ongoing.\nThe provincial steering committee will plan for providing health facilities near ethnic populations.\nPlacing new facilities near ethnic populations will be balanced with considerations of operational\nfeasibility and cost-effectiveness. To improve accessibility for remote communities, the Project\nwill increase outreach services and village-based care and promotion.  The targets are in Table\nA12.8.\n22. Appropriate Services. The Project will provide packages of interventions, training, and\ndrugs that address the common health problems of particular ethnic minorities, e.g., the initial\nmanagement  of  pneumonia  and  iodine  deficiency  at  village  level  for  the  high  altitude\npopulations, and training of birth attendants among those tribes using these services. Where", "64\nAppendix 12, page 8\nfeasible, a medical assistant will be posted so that a wider range of services can be made\navailable. The project facilities will also provide accommodation for overnight stay for patients\nliving far away. Opening hours of services will be extended to provide better time coverage.\nTable A12.8: Targeted Villages by Ethnic Group\nProvince Total Ethnic Population Total Estimated\nPopulation Targeted Ethnic Villages\nVillages\nPhongsali 53,490 Kor 21,390 231 Kor 92\nPhounoi 18,180 Phounoi 78\nKmu 12,830 Kmu 55\nHmong/Yao 283 Hmong/Yao 3\nOthers 122 Others 3\nLouang 40,150 Leu 20,475 168 Leu 85\nNamtha Kor 9,635 Kor 40\nKmu 9,635 Kmu 40\nHmong/Yao 283 Hmong/Yao 2\nOthers 122 Others 1\nOudomxai 147,150 Kmu 85,350 560 Kmu 324\nHmong 19,130 Hmong 78\nLeu 19,130 Leu 67\nOthers 23,540 Others 91\nBokeo 39,760 Kmu 13,520 242 Kmu 82\nLeu 8,350 Leu 48\nLao 5,170 Lao 31\nNhuan 6,360 Nhuan 36\nHmong 2,390 Hmong 15\nOthers 3,970 Others 30\nHouaphan 85, 630 Phoutai 26,545 322 Phutai 103\nLao, 25,690 Lao 96\nHmong 17,980 Hmong 67\nOthers 15,415 Others 56\nXieng Khouang 140,430 Lao 61,790 350 Lao 154\nHmong 17,980 Hmong 122\nPhoutai 15,450 Phoutai 39\nOthers 15,430 Others 35\nThe target population is estimated based on the percentage of each ethnic groups indicated in the National Statistic\nPopulation Census 1995.\n23. Acceptable Services. For each ethnic group, specific cultural issues will be identified at\nthe local level, where necessary through additional studies, and incorporated in the local design\nfor making services more acceptable. The provincial steering committee will ensure that this is\ndone for each targeted district as part of the annual provincial plan. The Project will also\nredistribute staff speaking the local language and train additional persons belonging to the\nethnic monitories as auxiliary nurses and village health providers. Training targets are in Table\nA12.9.\n24. Affordable  Services.  To  improve  financial  access,  the  Project  will  set  up  a  drug\nrevolving fund at the village level that will provide drugs at a cost lower than that provided by the\nprivate sector. Given the problems identified in providing subsidy or discounted services to the\nvery poor, community organizations will be asked to make arrangements to assist the very poor", "65\nAppendix 12, page 9\nas the communities\u2019 contribution to establishing the drug revolving fund. The improvement of\naccess of health services will also make services more affordable, as travel and opportunity\ncosts will reduce. Options for using the village mutual funds as a post-payment system and\nmaking hospitals services more affordable will be explored.\nTable A12.9: Training Targets for Village Health Workers and Health Staff\nProvince Ethnic No. of Village Health Number of Health Staff\nGroup Workers to be Trained to be Trained\nTotal Female Total Female\nPhongsali Kor 106 32 34 10\nPhounoi 90 45 22 11\nKmu 63 31 16 8\nHmong/Yao 3 1 2 1\nHor 3 1 2 1\nLouang Leu 58 29 14 7\nNamtha Kor 42 12 14 4\nKmu 43 21 14 7\nTaidam 36 18 9 4\nHmong/Yao 8 2 1 0\nLaohouay 7 1 1 0\nOudomxai Kmu 373 186 92 46\nHmong 83 25 28 8\nLeu 83 41 20 10\nHor 40 12 14 4\nPhoutai 30 15 8 4\nOthers 40 12 14 5\nBokeo Kmu 52 26 13 6\nLeu 44 22 11 5\nNhuan 23 11 6 3\nLao 20 10 5 2\nHmong 9 4 2 1\nKui 6 1 2 0\nOthers 4 1 8 2\nHouaphan Phoutai 114 57 28 14\nLao 111 55 28 14\nHmong 74 22 26 8\nTaidam 37 17 9 4\nOthers 34 10 11 4\nXieng Lao 177 88 44 22\nKhouang Hmong 137 41 46 14\nPhoutai 41 20 10 5\nKmu 16 8 5 2\nOthers 33 10 11 3", "66\nAppendix 13, page 1\nBENEFIT MONITORING AND EVALUATION\n1. The purpose of the benefit monitoring and evaluation system is to (i) provide essential,\naccurate, timely, and systematized information on the quantitative and qualitative performance\nof the Project components; (ii) ensure that problems and opportunities are identified, analyzed,\nshared, and responded to in a timely manner; and (iii) make the Project\u2019s impact known one\nyear after completion of the Project. The indicators will be based on the concept of input,\nprocess, coverage, and impact. Inputs include hardware and software including policies and\nguidelines. The process refers to the quantity and quality of activities performed. Output refers\nto the product of the services and management as measured at the point of delivery and\nincluded utilization of services, a key indicator of this Project, and client satisfaction (patients,\nstaff, others). Coverage refers to the proportion of a population having used a particular\nservice, e.g., the proportion of children immunized or couples using modern contraceptives.\nImpact refers to the change in the health status within the targeted population, e.g., reduction\nin infant mortality rate and fertility.\n2. Component 1, improved access to quality primary health care (PHC), will be monitored\nfor inputs, process, and output indicators using an improved version of the existing health\ninformation system. The provincial health office will be assisted to strengthen the provincial\nmonitoring system for health services. In addition, a health facility survey will be done at the\nbeginning,  at  midterm,  and  on  completion  of  the  Project.  The  survey  will  include  an\nassessment of training needs and staff skills. This will be supplemented by spotchecking of\nfacilities, covering all facilities each year, as part of supervision. A standardized checklist will\nbe used for yearly aggregation, similar to the one being used for the facility survey. For village-\nlevel  activities,  simple  activities  and  supply  request  forms  will  be  used  (visual  for  birth\nattendants, as most are illiterate). Beneficiary perceptions will be obtained through focus group\ndiscussions at village level and exit interviews during health facility surveys.\n3. The Project will rely on its own household surveys to assess coverage and impact,\nincluding a baseline survey in eight provinces (six project provinces and two controls) the first\nyear of project implementation, a midterm survey in three selected provinces before midterm\nreview scheduled toward the end of year three, and a repeat survey in the eight provinces in\nyear six. The survey will follow the World Health Organization (WHO) standard cluster survey\nused for immunization. It will be of sufficient size to measure the more frequent phenomena\nsuch as infant mortality for each province. Maternal mortality will be monitored separately from\ncensus information. Special studies will be done to probe into determinants of use of services.\n4. Component 2 mainly involves systems development and capacity building and will be\nmonitored in terms of products, activities of the provincial health offices, and use of  the\nproducts  by  the  health  services  in  all  provinces.  For  this  purpose,  the  provincial  project\nimplementation offices will each month complete a separate primary health care management\nmonitoring form. The project management office will be responsible for aggregation of the\ninformation of the 18 provinces. Qualitative studies will be carried to probe deeper into some of\nthe reasons for poor or good performance.", "67\nAppendix 13, page 2\nTable A13.1: Estimated Baseline Values and Targets in 6 Provinces\nIndicator Baseline  2000 Target 2006 Source\nImpact\nCrude Birth Rate/1,000 persons 41 36 Survey\nInfant Mortality Rate/1,000 live births 104 75 Survey\nMaternal Mortality Rate/100,000 live births* 490 355 Census\nCoverage\nContraceptive Prevalence Rate 23 percent 45 percent HHS\nHouseholds Using Iodized Salt 67 percent 90 percent HHS\nChildren  under  Five  Sleeping  under  Treated 14 percent 35 percent HHS\nMosquito Nets\nEligible Children Fully Immunized 32 percent 68 percent HHS\nOutput\nHealth Facility Attendance (Baseline) 40 percent HIS/HFSS\nincrease\nMCH-FP Attendance (Baseline) 60 percent HIS/HFSS\nincrease\nVillage Health Care Providers Attendance (Baseline) Double HIS/HFSS\nHospital Deliveries 10 percent 20 percent HIS/HFSS\nProcess\nHealth Centers with MCH-FP Services 20 percent 50 percent HIS/HFSS\nVillage Visits by Quarter 10 percent 60 percent HIS\nVillages with Functioning Village Health 5 percent 40 percent HIS\nCommittees\nNumber of District Hospitals for Major Surgery 2 8 HIS\nSupervision Visits by Quarter 30 percent 80 percent HIS\nHIS Reports Received 50 percent 90 percent HIS\nInputs\nNumber of Village Health Providers Trained 0 1200 PIO\nNumber of Ethnic Minority Staff Trained 0 100\nNumber of Health Centers Equipped 0 50 PIO\nTargeted Health Center Kits Supplied/year 0 85 PIO\nTargeted Drug Revolving Kits Supplied/year 0 70 PIO\n* Maternal Mortality Rate, actually a ratio, is difficult to measure and not a good indicator to measure project\nimpact.

This appendix summarizes the Project\u2019s economic rationale and benefits, including an\nanalysis  of  the  cost-effectiveness,  and  assesses  the  Project\u2019s  financial  sustainability  and\nbenefits.\nA.  Economic Rationale\n2. The Project will improve (i) the health status of about 0.9 million people living in six\nproject provinces by helping to expand and improve primary health care (PHC) services, and\n(ii) referral services for 1.7 million people living in the eight northern provinces. The interventions\nare targeted specifically at the poor and ethnic minorities (both about 60 percent of the target\npopulation), and address conditions that impose a  large disease  burden  such  as  malaria,\nrespiratory  infections,  diarrhea,  and  micronutrient  deficiencies.  The  Project  will  address\nproblems that account for more than 30 percent of the burden of disease for women and\nchildren,  in  particular  reproductive  health  care.  The  Project  will  protect  children  during  a\nvulnerable time in their lives, thus improving their intellectual and psychomotor development.\n3. The  economic  rationale  for  public  intervention  in  PHC  service  is  strong  and  well\nestablished. First, PHC services, especially immunization, are mostly public goods or have large\npositive externalities, and will not be adequately provided by the private sector. Second, PHC\nservices are marked by informational imperfection, e.g., long-run effects of early childhood or\nmothers\u2019 health status, leading to low levels of demand, and poor supply response from the\nprivate  sector.  Third,  the failure  of  insurance  markets for basic  health  care, e.g.,  delivery\ncomplications, puts poor households at high risk of catastrophic expenditure and this risk can be\nsignificantly reduced by improved public PHC. Fourth, PHC services can contribute significantly\nto poverty reduction among the less endowed segments of the population, and therefore, there\nis a redistributive and safety-net rationale for public intervention. Finally, PHC services can be\nprovided publicly in a relatively inexpensive and sustainable manner under an appropriate\ndelivery design and financing arrangements.\n4. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) household survey found that the\naverage household expenditure is about $6.70 per person per year, and 77 percent of this is\nspent on drugs. This shows little room for average households in the project areas to spend on\npreventive health care, unless supported by public sector intervention. Their overall health\nneeds would be better served by spending more of their time and limited financial resources on\npreventive care than curative care. The market failure in PHC services is exacerbated by the\nremoteness of the population and the quality gap between the beneficiaries\u2019 expectation and\navailable supplies. Major findings of the household survey indicate that (i) the ethnic minorities\nare  in  more  remote and  less  accessible areas  than  the  majority  Tai-Kadai group;  (ii)  the\naccessibility to services and preventive outcomes are lower in ethnic minorities; (iii) the disease\nburden is slightly higher for ethnic minorities; and (iv) the literacy rate and level of health\nknowledge among ethnic women are very low. These suggest the need for public intervention to\nenhance knowledge and therefore realize potential demand for PHC services on the demand\nside and improve access and quality on the supply side. Based on the experience of the first\nPHC project, the Project will improve the efficiency of PHC service delivery in rural areas by\nrationalizing the spatial distribution of physical facilities according to topography, population\ndensity, population growth rates, and proximity to the poor and ethnic minorities. Also, the\nProject will concentrate on the provision of services that are either public goods or have large\npositive externalities, such as the prevention and treatment of contagious diseases.", "70\nAppendix 14, page 2\n5. The PPTA village survey found that village health care providers (VHPs) are present at a\nhigh rate among all ethnic groups (the minimum is among Tibeto-Burman group, with one VHP\nin 56 percent of villages). However, they need some incentive and training to take on PHC\nservices to serve villagers effectively. The Project will reach out to these VHPs and enable their\nparticipation in the provision at the grassroots level. Due to the absence of private sector\nproviders of PHC services and also near-absence of private health services, except sellers of\ndrugs, the Project is not likely to infringe on activities of private sector providers. Conversely, the\nProject is likely to enhance the awareness of rural population about the importance of health\ncare in general, leading to higher willingness to  pay for  health  care,  which  may  result  in\nattracting better-quality private providers of basic curative services.\n6. Another market failure aspect, economies of scale of health information provision and\nsupervision, will be addressed by the Project\u2019s support for the establishment of new PHC\ncoordination units at the central, regional, and provincial levels. Many external agencies and\nnongovernment organizations are conducting a wide variety of PHC activities at every level of\nthe  network,  and the  Project  will  enable  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  to  coordinate  and\norchestrate these current activities and plan for further expansion of the PHC  network,  in\naccordance  with  the  PHC  policy.  Especially,  standardization  and  implementation  of  PHC\nmanagement  information  systems  such  as  health  information  and  cost  recovery  reporting\nsystems will help exploit the economies of scale or scope, and improve efficiency.\n7. The Project has been specifically designed to reduce poverty by meeting the health\nneeds of the rural poor and ethnic minorities. While the Project aims to provide preventive\nservices to all segments of the population in the project provinces, the poor will receive a\ndisproportionate benefit by getting better access to services at a lower cost. The Project will\nfurther streamline cost recovery mechanisms to improve cross-subsidy to the very poor. The\nProject will provide for PHC targeted services to the poor as a result of several design features\nsuch as VHP mobilization, training support for indigenous people to become auxiliary nurses,\nand local contribution to staff houses at subdistrict health units. The Project also has been\ndesigned to benefit women. Women will constitute a priority group of the Project beneficiaries,\nwith specific interventions aimed at improving women\u2019s health (e.g., birth spacing, supplies of\ncontraceptives, and mobile teams to assist delivery emergency).\n8. Overall, the Project focuses its resources on proven high health impact, cost-effective\ninterventions for reducing morbidity and mortality. At the same time, the Project will explore\ninnovative  financing  options  at  various  levels.  The  PPTA  social  analysis  indicates  high\nwillingness to share costs of health services but the willingness to pay is linked with the quality\nof services provided. The Project includes development of cost recovery and incentive systems\nat the provincial hospital level to explore improved financing of better-quality basic referral-level\nservices, which will in turn enhance the user trust in the PHC network as a whole.\nB. Economic Benefits\n9. Through a number of channels, the PHC expansion will bring about economic benefits\nby  improving  the  health  status  of  children  and  adults  (especially  women)  by  decreasing\nmorbidity and mortality. For example, improvement in health status will lead to: (i) enhance the\nhuman capital base and labor productivity of the country\u2019s workforce; (ii) increase the future\nsavings  rate  and  capital  formation  by  reducing  the  household  health  care  expenditures;\n(iii) improve physical and intellectual development, thereby increasing returns to education for\nchildren; and (iv) allow the poor to escape from the vicious loop of low health status, large\nnumber of children, low educational input, and low productivity.", "71\nAppendix 14, page 3\nC. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\n10. Cost-effectiveness  of  health  interventions  is  often  measured  as  cost  per  disability\nadjusted life years (DALYs) saved. A DALY is a measure that combines mortality, morbidity,\nand disability weighted for years of life saved at different ages, with social preference in favor of\nworking-age  years  reflected  in  the  implicit  weights.  Despite  limitations,  DALYs  provide  a\nquantification of the burden of disease comparable across alternative health interventions and\nare increasingly used in developing countries. For the purpose of analysis, DALYs are used to\nindicate the current burden of disease from a selected set of medical conditions addressed by\nthe Project. For accuracy, DALYs should be calculated from data specific to the country. The\nrequisite data for these calculations is not yet available in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n(Lao PDR), and a second-best approach for the estimation of DALYs has been taken.\n11. The greatest difficulty in economic analysis of health projects lies in the uncertainties of\nthe reduction of disease burden, or saving in the otherwise lost DALYs every year in this case,\nspecifically accruable to the Project. The incremental DALYs saved due to the Project also\ndepend on the assumed counterfactual scenario without the Project. For the current Project,\nPHC services are targeted primarily to the poor and the new pricing policy on medical fees and\nconsumables will not significantly influence the target population\u2019s use of the PHC services.\nHere, the \u201cbefore-project\u201d baseline health situation  is  simply  taken as  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d\nsituation and different scenarios (low, moderate, and high) have been prepared to test the\nrobustness of cost-effectiveness indicators to different effective PHC coverage of the target\npopulation. The low scenario assumes that the percentage of the target population reached and\nfull impact of the PHC intervention on mortality and morbidity realized will gradually increase to\n10 percent during the project implementation and stay so thereafter. The moderate and high\nscenarios assume the percentage will gradually increase to 15 and 20 percent, respectively,\nduring the project implementation period and stay so thereafter. The project life is assumed to\nbe 15 years, beyond which the project investments will cease to yield health benefits and leave\nno residual value.\n12. Both financial and economic costs per DALY saved are calculated based on a range of\nassumptions and conversions described in the main text.  The Project\u2019s costs stream and output\n(DALY saved) streams are summarized in Table A14.1.\nTable A14.1: DALYs Saved\nFinancial Cost per DALY saved Economic Cost per DALY saved\nLow Scenario:           $49.02/DALY Low Scenario:           $45.82/DALY\nModerate Scenario:  $30.08/DALY Moderate Scenario:  $28.11/DALY\nHigh Scenario:         $22.56/DALY High Scenario:         $21.09/DALY\nADB\u2019s Policy for the Health Sector lists costs per DALY saved for some comparable health\ninterventions as follows: immunization at $25, family planning at $25-75, malaria prevention\nusing impregnated mosquito nets at $15-20. The high scenario cost is considered well within the\nacceptable range compared with the international norm. The low scenario cost is somewhat\nhigher than the international comparator, which may be explained by the assumptions regarding\nthe cost of services, in particular family planning services, which appears quite high, and the\ngeographical condition in the Lao PDR. This would justify relatively higher cost per DALY saved.", "72\nAppendix 14, page 4\nD. Financial Sustainability\n1. Fiscal Impact\n13. Health sector projects are normally net users of government income. The magnitude of\ntheir fiscal impact must be put in the context of the total government health budget to establish\nwhether there is a financial gap that must be bridged either by higher taxation, borrowing, or\nuser charges. Fiscal affordability of the recurrent project expenditure needs especially to be\nestablished. Such analysis should ideally be broken down to the smallest budgetary unit. For\nthe Project, an attempt has been made to assess the financial sustainability by province. The\ncurrent Project is unlikely to be subject to a major fungibility problem.\n14. Upon completion of the physical investments, the average annual recurrent expenditure\nneeded to sustain the Project activities is estimated at $245,500, comprised of maintaining costs\nof buildings, equipment, and vehicles, and operational costs of supervising health care workers\nat rural health units and VHPs. This amount is broken down by province as in Table A14.2.\nAlso, using the 1997/98 expenditure data as a guide (data from more recent years have not\nbeen obtainable from the Government), annual health sector recurrent expenditure by province\nwas estimated as shown in the table. Although it is difficult to predict with precision, the overall\nincremental recurrent costs associated with the Project is estimated to be about 8 percent of the\nannual government health expenditure. The overall prospect for sustainability is favorable as\nMOH has committed to allocate more budget to promotive and preventive services, although the\nrisk of macroeconomic instability will be beyond MOH\u2019s control, as has been observed during\n1997-1999. The six provinces with a comprehensive development program will require 10-16\npercent incremental recurrent costs to sustain project activities.\nTable A14.4: Recurrent Cost and Budget Projection by Province\n1997/98 Adjusted to\n($1000 Costant 2000 2004-6 Estimated 2000 by Project\nPrices) Recurrent 3.7Percent cost\n2004 2005 2006 Average Health International Percentage\nExpenditure Inflation Share in\nthe Budget\nBokeo 20.9 16.2 19.0    18.7    111.5    115.6  16\nLouang Namtha 20.1 18.5 17.9    18.8    178.0    184.6  10\nPhongsali 16.1 15.4 13.7    15.1    124.6    129.2  12\nHouaphan 18.8 17.4 16.7    17.6    169.1    175.3  10\nOudomxai 25.9 23.4 23.9    24.4    189.7    196.7  12\nXieng Khouang 23.4 20.9 22.1    22.1    162.9    168.9  13\nLouang Phrabang 14.0 11.6 12.3    12.6    297.5    308.5    4\nSayaburi 7.2 7.5 7.9      7.6    229.4    237.8    3\nOther Provinces 101.5 125.2 98.9 108.5 1,345.0 1,394.8    8\nand Central\nMOH\n   Total 247.9 256.2 232.4 245.5 2,807.5 2,911.3    8\n2. Cost Recovery\n15. In  addition  to  the  Government  assurance  that  public  health  expenditures  will  be\nmaintained or increased in real terms, the Project employs the following specific mechanisms to\nincrease the likelihood of financial sustainability.\n(i)  increased cost recovery revenue from those able to pay, through more accurate\npricing of services based on total costs of goods and service provision;", "73\nAppendix 14, page 5\n(ii)  increased cost recovery revenue from more accurate replacement cost pricing to\nkeep up with inflation for drugs and other medical consumables;\n(iii)  public-private partnerships with VHPs for revolving funds with full replacement\ncost pricing;\n(iv)  increased cost recovery revenue from the pricing of hospital services, which\ncurrently are not routinely charged for;\n(v)  increased retention of cost recovery revenue by exempting public health sector\nrevenue from provincial taxes; and\n(vi)  increased revenue from provincial health services subscription system to reduce\nthe financial risks of hospitalization and chronic illness.\n16. Since Prime Minister Decree 52 was implemented, cost recovery systems for drugs,\nother medical consumables, and services have been moving from an experimental stage to a\nmore developed and systematic approach in the more advanced central and regional hospitals.\nCost recovery in these hospitals is substantial and increasing. Currently, fees are charged for\ndrugs, treatment, laboratory tests, x-rays, hospital rooms, medical supplies, and documents in\ncentral, regional, provincial, and some district hospitals. Drugs are paid into revolving drug fund\n(RDF) at virtually every level of the public health care system. The level of cost recovery through\nRDF and fees collected for medial consumables and services averages about 60 percent of\nrevenue at major hospitals, and about 36 percent at successful district hospitals. Smaller and\nremote provincial and district hospitals are thought to recover lower percentages of operating\ncosts. (Findings from facility visits during the fact-finding mission are available upon request.)\n17. Using  secondary  data  in  reports  on  the  number  of  outpatients  and  inpatients  at\nrepresentative provincial and district hospitals, the PPTA social analysis attempted a rough\nquantitative analysis of use to cost recovery adoption. The analysis found that in all hospitals for\nwhich the data were collected, implementation of RDFs were associated with better quality\ndrugs and lower cost than available in private pharmacies.\n18. Some groups in the population are more sensitive to the implementation of cost recovery\nsystems. These groups are the poor, women, children, and ethnic minorities. Data collected at\nPak Ou district hospital in Xieng Khouang province, specifically for outpatient visits, show that\nan increased use by each group after RDF was implemented in 1995. Thus, RDF did not lead to\na fall in use by sensitive groups. Regarding the variation in use among different groups, most of\nthe Mon-Kmer and Hmong-Mien villages are in the remotest zone and the first barrier to access\nfor these ethnic groups is geographic. Use by these groups is less sensitive to a variation of\nservice quality at the hospital.\n19. Initial experimentation with RDF led to some failures, but these failures taught valuable\nlessons, including the needs: (i) to establish and enforce simple accounting systems, (ii) for\ntraining, especially at the district and lower levels in the accounting system; (iii) for oversight for\npricing and procurement by a capable, trained fund manager in PHOs; (iv) to price drugs based\non drug cost, to safeguard against inflation; and (v) to stockpile drugs and other supplies, not\nmoney. Regarding treatment fees, there are also lessons to be learned. Although the current\ngovernment policy encourages treatment fees to be charged for professional medical services,\nvery  few  hospitals  do  so.  This,  combined  with  low  salaries  for  medical  professionals,\ndiscourages doctors, nurses, and other trained personnel from dedicating themselves to public\nhospital duties, and encourages them to take second jobs to supplement their income.\n20. The prices paid for drugs, medical consumables, and other items in public hospitals and\nhealth centers are based on the cost to buy the supplies. As far as the provincial and district\nhospitals visited by the fact-finding mission, charges for various services including the markup", "74\nAppendix 14, page 6\nfor drugs (25 percent markup on drugs: 5 percent for logistics and transportation; 10 percent for\nlost or stolen drugs; and 10 percent for administration costs) appeared to be more or less\nuniform.  However,  on  the  \u201ctax\u201d  side,  the  PPTA  report  indicates  that  there  are  different\ninterpretations of the decree.\n21. Under Decree 52, hospitals are supposed to identify the poor on the basis of a card or\ndocument issued by the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare or by the village head. However,\nthe administrative costs of \u201cmeans testing\u201d systems outweigh the benefits of collected fees from\nthose who actually pay. In the Lao PDR, a common sense approach that minimizes costs and\nprotects the poor is being used at most of the major hospitals examined. This informal system\nappears to have evolved on its own merit, and in the short to medium run, seems to be the only\nfeasible option given the current lack of official proof of the income level and high administrative\ncosts  and  management  capacity  required  for  systematic  document-based  formal  system.\nHowever, in the long run, a document-based transparent system will be necessary.\n22. A detailed design for the proposed cost recovery measures will be studied and pilot\ntested during project implementation under the financing option component. (Preliminary terms\nof reference are available upon request.) Basic principles for cost recovery have been prepared.\n23. The Government will have to provide subsidy to most of the PHC services in the medium\nterm as only limited revenue can be raised even from the nonpoor  in  the  Lao PDR.  For\nexample, a living allowance for staff at subdistrict health centers will have to be provided by the\nGovernment,  while  drug  supply  will  primarily  be  financed  through  cost  recovery  and\nGovernment subsidy in case of unexpected depletion. In the long run, risk-pooling schemes\nshould  be  expanded  so  that  health  financing  becomes  more  self-sustainable  without\nGovernment subsidy.\n24. MOH has proposed that the 20 percent \u201ctax\u201d be abolished so that 100 percent of cost\nrecovery revenue can be retained at the point of collection. Taxing nonprofit entities seems to\nhave little rationale. The appraisal mission could not confirm the specific use of these taxes. The\ncollected taxes probably go back to the general Ministry of Finance coffer and no earmarking is\ndone.  Even  if  the  Government\u2019s  purpose  is  to  use  the  collected  tax  solely  for  PHC  and\npreventive care, it would still be more efficient and reduce administrative costs to retain them at\nthe point of collection and supervise the hospitals and accounting staff to direct the money for\nspecific purposes such as maternal child care and family planning. This issue needs follow-up\nduring the project implementation.\nE.  Poverty Impact Analysis\n1. Poverty Incidence\n25. Although the Lao PDR is generally recognized as one of the poorest countries in the\nAsian and Pacific Region, consistent data are not available to properly establish the country\u2019s\npoverty line and poverty incidence. The Government has yet to decide upon an official poverty\nline. Two poverty lines developed by the World Bank and the Swedish Statistics Office give\nconflicting  results  on poverty  incidence.  The PPTA  household  survey  chose  rice  shortage\n(whether the household had enough rice during the last year) as an indicator of poverty. Field\nsurveys found that poverty in rural villages in the Lao PDR in subsistence production is mainly\nlinked with lack of workforce and land shortage. Lack of both combined is best reflected in rice\nshortage. But  this  does  not allow  comparison between provinces and  regions.  The  Asian\nDevelopment Bank  study  in  May  2000  attempted  to  make  the  calculation  of  poverty  line\nconsistent between the 1992/93 Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS1) and the", "75\nAppendix 14, page 7\n1997/98 update (LECS2) based on which the average total poverty line for the Lao PDR is\nestimated to be KR20,911 per person per month in 1997/98 prices (about $9 as opposed to the\nWorld Bank criterion of $14). Taking this poverty line for the current analysis, poverty incidences\nin the target provinces are given on Table A14.3.\nTable A14.3: Percentage of Poor by Province\n1992/93 1997/98 Change Number of Districts\nwith Majority Poor\nBokeo 70.4 51.0 -19.4 3 out of 5\nLouang Namtha 74.3 66.8 -7.5 3 out of 5\nPhongsali 94.8 71.7 -23.1 6 out of 7\nHouaphan 90.7 81.3 -9.4 6 out of 6\nOudomxai 70.8 77.5 6.7 7 out of 7\nXieng Khouang 72.8 42.5 -30.3 4 out of 7\nLuang Phrabang 81.9 61.2 -20.7 8 out of 10\nSayaburi 50.6 31.9 -18.7 3 out of 10\nLao PDR 62.7 46.9 -15.8 74 out of 128\n26. There was a remarkable reduction in poverty incidence during the mid-1990s. Although\nthe rich seem to have benefited more than the poor, the benefits of economic growth have\neffectively trickled down during this period. Among the four regions of the country, the northern\nregion has the highest poverty incidence at 61.7 percent (down from 76.5 percent). The poverty\nincidence in Vientiane Municipality has been the lowest at 8.4 percent (down from 27.4 percent).\nThe numbers for the central and southern regions are 42.4 percent (down from 59.5 percent)\nand 53.5 percent (down from 67.6 percent), respectively. In addition to this large variation\nbetween regions, there are also differences between provinces. Among those with the highest\npoverty  incidence  are  the  project  target  provinces  such  as  Phongsali,  Houaphan,  and\nOudomxai. The differential performances in the reduction of poverty incidence appears to be\nassociated strongly with the degree of access to markets, including overseas markets, in the\nPRC, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\n2. Differential Project Impact\n27. The  percentages  of  the  poor  in  the  above  Table  A14.3  can  be  considered  an\napproximation of a \u201cpoverty impact ratio\u201d based on population headcount in the target provinces;\nthus, 62 percent of the project benefits are considered to go to the poor. But this simple\ninterpretation assumes that the burden of diseases are distributed in a simple proportion of the\npopulation and the project services are used by everyone equally. In reality, the Project is very\nlikely to benefit the poor more than this number indicates, because  (i) the burden of disease is\nmore than proportionately affecting the poor, (ii) the analysis found that poverty is not linked with\nthe degree of remoteness of villages, and (iii) project services at lower level health facilities will\ncreate access to the poor who cannot currently afford the travel cost and effectively constitute\neconomic subsidy targeted at them."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20000823100114Z", "Creator": "PSCRIPT.DRV Version 4.0", "ModDate": "D:20131112194431+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R153-00RRP.doc"}}
