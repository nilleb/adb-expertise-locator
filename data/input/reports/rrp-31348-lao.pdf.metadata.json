It will help to improve access to and quality of\nessential  preventive,  promotive  and  curative  health  services  at  village,\nhealth  center  and  district  levels  in  34  underdeveloped  districts  with  0.9\nmillion  people; and  improve  referral  services  for  1.7  million  people.  The\nProject  will  also  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of\nHealth (MOH) and all provinces in the Lao PDR to develop PHC.\n\nClassification:\n\nEnvironmental\nAssessment:\n\nPrimary: Poverty Reduction\nSecondary: Gender and Development\n\nEnvironmental category: C\n\nEnvironmental implications were reviewed and no adverse environmental\nimpacts were identified.\n\nRationale:\n\nRationale\n\nWith  a  per  capita  income  of  $283  and  half  of  the  population  living  in\npoverty, Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in the Asia and Pacific\nRegion.  The  rural  poor,  in  particular  women  and  children,  ethnic\nminorities and other vulnerable groups living in the inaccessible northern\nhills, suffer from extremely poor health. Life expectancy of only 53 years\nis the lowest in the region. Most sickness and deaths are from  common\ncommunicable  diseases  such  as  malaria,  acute  respiratory  infections,\ndiarrhea and  measles,  most  of  which  are  preventable  or  easily  curable.\nMaternal  and  infant  mortality  and  fertility  are  among  the  highest  in  the\nregion,  yet  reproductive  health  services  are  not  readily  available.  The\nexisting network of health facilities has inadequate coverage and  mainly\nprovides  a  limited  range  of  curative  services  of  often  sub-standard\nquality.  As  much  as  half  of  the  rural  population  do  not  have  access  to\npreventive  and  promotive  services  and first  referral  care,  in particular  in\nthe northern hills.\n\nThe  Government,  as  a  cornerstone  of  its  social  policy,  accords  high\npriority  to  the  improvement  of  the  health  status  of  the  population.  PHC\nhas been identified as the most cost-effective approach to provide basic\nhealth  services.  The  Government  recently  approved  a  PHC  policy  that\naims  to  make  a  basic  package  of  health  care  available  to  the  entire\npopulation,  and  restructured  MOH  in  support  of  PHC.  The  Government\nhas  requested  ADB  to  support  expansion  and  improvement  of  PHC\ndelivery,  strengthen  PHC  planning  and  management,  and  develop\neffective  financing  mechanisms.  The  Project  is  specially  designed  to\nimprove  the  health  status  of  women  and  children,  ethnic  minorities  and\nthe rural poor.\n\n\fObjectives and\nScope:\n\nCost Estimates:\n\niii\n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  goals  of  improving  the\nhealth  status  and  reduce  poverty  of  the  population  of  Lao  PDR.  The\nProject  will  improve  PHC  for  the  rural  poor  by  (i) expanding  and\nimproving the quality of PHC in the northern region, and (ii) strengthening\nthe institutional capacity for PHC.\n\nThe Project will target women and children, ethnic minorities and the rural\npoor  by  (i)  increasing  their  physical,  social  and  financial  access  to\nessential services, (ii) focussing on interventions and diseases that affect\nthem disproportionally, and (iii) improving the quality of services for these\ngroups.  The  Project  will  give  priority  to  cost-effective  interventions\nbenefiting  women  and  children  including  health  promotion,  reproductive\nhealth  care,  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  common  infections  and\nmicronutrient deficiencies, and first referral services.\n\nthe  northern  provinces  by\nComponent  1  will  develop  PHC \n(i) increasing  access  to  PHC  at  health  center  and  village  levels;\n(ii) improving  the  quality  of  PHC  including  training  of  ethnic  minorities\nstaff, (iii)  strengthening  reproductive  health  services,  and  (iv)  supporting\nvillage health care and promotion.\n\nin \n\nComponent  2  will  strengthen \nfor  PHC\nthe \nnationwide  by  (i)  strengthening  PHC  coordination,  (ii) standardizing\nmanagement  systems,  (iii)  supporting  staff  development  for  PHC\nmanagement, and (iv) testing innovative financing approaches.\n\ninstitutional  capacity \n\nThe total  cost of  the  Project  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,\nand  interest  charges  during  implementation  is  estimated  at  $25  million\nequivalent,  comprising  a \nforeign  exchange  cost  of  $10.7  million\nequivalent  (43  percent)  and  local  currency  cost  of  $14.3  million\nequivalent (57 percent).\n\n                                Foreign             Local             Total\nSource                  Exchange        Currency           Cost            Percent\n\nADB\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\n10.7\n0.0\n\n10.7\n\n9.3\n5.0\n\n14.3\n\n20.0\n5.0\n\n25.0\n\n80\n20\n\n100\n\nFinancing Plan:\n\n($ million)\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms:\n\nThe  equivalent  of  SDR14,956,000  ($20  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s\nSpecial  Fund.

The central Project\nManagement  Office  will  be  located  in  the  PHC  and  Rural  Development\nDivision of the Cabinet. The Director of this Division, who is  responsible\nfor planning, coordination, and monitoring PHC in the country, will be the\nProject  Director.  There  will  be  steering  committees  in  all  the  provinces\nconsisting of representatives of the provincial health service, the planning\nand  budgeting  department,  and  beneficiaries.  There  will  be  eight\nthe  Project\nprovincial  Project \nManagement Office in implementing component 1. Component  2  will be\nmanaged centrally.\n\nImplementation  Offices \n\nto  assist \n\nAll ADB-financed procurement for the Project  will  be  in accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  Related equipment and  material  will\nbe  combined  into  packages  to  simplify  procurement.  Supply  contracts\ncosting more than $500,000 will be procured by international competitive\nbidding procedures. Supply contracts at $500,000 equivalent or less  will\nfollow international shopping procedures, except for some equipment and\nsupplies like hostel beds and furniture, that are locally manufactured and\nunlikely to attract foreign suppliers. These will be procured through local\ncompetitive  bidding \nin  accordance  with  Government  procedures\nacceptable to ADB. Packages of less than $100,000 may be procured on\na  direct purchase  basis. Equipment  and  materials  required  at  provincial\nlevel  and  costing  less  than  $10,000  may  be  procured  by  the  Project\nImplementation  Office  according  to  Government  procedures  acceptable\nto ADB.\n\nThe  Project  includes  construction  of  41  health  centers  and  seven\nhospitals;  and  renovation  or  upgrading  of  six  health  centers  and  17\nhospitals.  The  health  facilities  are  located  in  remote  and  scattered\nlocations  and  are  unlikely  to  attract  international  bidders.  Civil  works\ncontracts  will  be  awarded  according  to  local  competitive  bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. However, if any package is estimated to\ncost  $1.0  million  or  more,  international  competitive  bidding  procedures\nwill be followed.\n\nConsulting Services: All consultants financed under  the  loan  will  be  selected  and engaged  in\naccordance  with  ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\nprocedures  acceptable \nthe  recruitment  of  domestic\nconsultants. Six international and six domestic individual consultants and\none  domestic  firms  will  be  provided.  The  international  consultants  will\ninclude  chief  technical  adviser  (36  person-months),  education  and\ntraining specialist (6 person-months), management specialist (12 person-\nmonths),  health  sector \n(6  person-months),\nprocurement  specialist  (6  person-months)  and  architect  (6  person-\nmonths).

A  domestic  firm  will  be  contracted  for  five  years  for\nbuilding design and construction supervision.\n\nThe Project aims to provide services to all segments of the population in\nthe  project  provinces.  The  Project  will  focus  on  reducing  poverty  by\nmeeting the health and birth spacing needs of the rural poor. This will be\ndone  by  placing  new  health  facilities  near  large  pockets  of  in  particular\nunderserved ethnic minorities, by  training  local  people to  make  services\nmore  accessible  and  acceptable,  by  focussing  on  reproductive  health\nservices  for  women  and  children,  and  by  reducing  the  cost  of  health\nservices for the poor. The Project will primarily benefit a population of 0.9\nmillion people in 34  out  of  61  districts, and  improve  referral  services for\n1.7 million people in the eight northern provinces. About 60 percent of the\npopulation  is  estimated  to  live  below  the  poverty  line  in  the  targeted\nnorthern  provinces.  The  project  will  also  benefit  the  poor  in  other\nprovinces  of  the  country  by  improving  PHC  management  for  better\neffectiveness, efficiency and equity of PHC.\n\n\fv\ni\n\fI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan to\n\n1.\nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Primary Health Care Expansion Project.\n\nI. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  has  developed  a\nprimary  health  care  (PHC) policy1  to  improve  the  health  of  its  citizens  based  on  the  concepts  of\nparticipation,  equity,  and  sustainability.  The  Government  has  received  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) support for a PHC project2 in 2 of 18 provinces3 in the Lao PDR, and has requested support\nfor (i) expanding PHC to the entire northern region, and (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity\nfor  PHC  management  nationwide.  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)4  for  the  PHC\nExpansion Project was approved in May 1998, and implemented between February and December\n1999. The Bank undertook Fact-finding from 17 January to 5 February 2000 and Appraisal from 24\nApril  to  12  May  2000.  Throughout  the  Project  preparation  and  appraisal,  there  was  close\nconsultation and coordination with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other ministries; Government\nofficials at provincial and district levels; multilateral and bilateral funding agencies; nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs);  health  workers;  community  representatives;  and  potential  beneficiaries\nincluding people from ethnic minorities. This report is based on Government inputs, the TA report,\nand Fact-finding and Appraisal Missions. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nEconomic and Social Context\n\n3.\nLao PDR is a hilly and forested country located centrally in the Greater Mekong Region. It\nhas a low population density of 21 persons per square kilometer, a population of about 5.2 million\nand a population growth rate of about 2.5 percent per year.5 Based on a recent ADB analysis of the\nLao  Expenditure  and  Consumption  Surveys of 1992-93  and  1997-98,  the  poverty  incidence  may\nhave declined from 63 percent poor and 41 percent very poor in 1992-93 to 47 percent poor and\n25 percent very poor in 1997-98.6 While the 1997 economic crisis spurred the economy in the Lao\nPDR, the average per capita income has been declining due to inflation and is currently estimated\nat $283 per year. The poorest provinces are in the northern region, with an estimated 62 percent\npoor and 38 percent very poor in 1997-98. This analysis also found that the 16 percent reduction in\npoor people was due to  23 percent  growth  less 7  percent  increase  in  inequality.  The  increase  in\nconsumption in the lowest quintile was small, suggesting that economic growth had less impact on\nthe  very  poor.  The  Government  is  addressing  poverty  through  gradual  economic  reforms,  social\nservices  development,  and  investment  in  priority  infrastructure  such  as  roads  and  hydropower.\nWhile  long-term  prospects  for  the  country\u2019s  economy  are  favorable,  the  Government  is  currently\nfacing a serious financial crisis.\n\n4.\nThe 85 percent of the rural population comprises some 47 distinct ethnic groups. The ethnic\nLao  constitute  about  half  the  population,  and  engage  in  agriculture,  fishing,  and  commercial\nactivities in the fertile lowlands of the Mekong and its tributaries. The ethnic minorities mainly live in\nthe hills, where infrastructure is underdeveloped and access to services is poor, particularly in the\n\n                                                       \n1  Ministry of Health (MOH).

This  is  an  analysis  of  the  Lao  Expenditure  and  Consumption\n\nSurveys in 1992-93 and 1997-1998, by the Government of the Lao PDR.\n\n\f2\n\nrainy  season.  The hill  tribes are  mainly  subsistence farmers  with  occasional  cash  crops,  who,  in\naddition, exploit the abundant forests. The highland provinces in the north score lowest in terms of\nper capita income, and the northern region accounts for 30 percent of the poor in the Lao PDR. Per\nthe 1995 census, the literacy rate among the Lao and  other  Tai-Kadai  was 70  percent, the  Mon-\nKhmer 38 percent, the Hmong 27 percent, and the Tibeto-Burman 4 percent. Gender  differences\nare  more  apparent  among  the  ethnic  minorities.  The  literacy  rate  for  Mon-Khmer  females  is  20\npercent, and for Hmong females 9 percent. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\nhuman development report for 1998 ranks the Lao PDR 136th of 175 countries.\n\n2.\n\nHealth Status\n\n5.\nCompared with other countries in the region, mortality and fertility in the Lao PDR are high.\nThe 1995 population census reported a child mortality rate (children less than five years of age) of\n170  per  1,000  live  births.  The  Government  estimates  that  the  infant  mortality  rate  has  declined\nfrom  104  to  85  infant  deaths  per  1,000  live  births  since  1995  (footnote  5),  and  the  maternal\nmortality  ratio  from  656  to  490  per  100,000  live  births  since  1993.7  Only  Cambodia  has  higher\nreported  infant  and  maternal  mortality  rates,  and  the  life  expectancy  of  53  years  at  birth  is  the\nlowest in the Mekong region. The three geographical regions in the Lao PDR (north, central, and\nsouth)  have  significant  disparities  in  health  status.  The  north  has  the  highest  infant,  child,  and\nmaternal mortality; and the lowest life expectancy and literacy rates, according to UNDP data. The\ntotal  fertility  rate  is  estimated  to  have  declined  from  5.6  to  4.5  children  per  woman  since  1995,\nwhich is still high.8 The immediate causes of high mortality seen in the Lao PDR are typical for a\ncountry before the transition from high to low fertility and communicable to welfare diseases. High\nlevels  of  fertility  place  women  at  increased  risk  of  maternal  morbidity,  disability,  and  mortality,\nespecially in case of early pregnancy, short birth intervals, high parity, malnutrition, illness, and lack\nof routine and emergency obstetric care, all of which are common problems in the Lao PDR.\n\n6.\nCommon  causes of  mortality  among  children  are  preventable or  easily  curable  conditions\nsuch as malaria, respiratory and intestinal infections, and  complications of  childbirth.  Malaria  is a\nserious health problem with an estimated 1.4 million cases and 14,000 deaths per year, with young\nchildren  and  pregnant  and  breast  feeding  mothers  most  at  risk  from  malaria.9  Respiratory\ninfections and diarrheal diseases cause respectively 5,500 and 4,000 deaths annually of  children\nunder  five  years.  The  risk  of  infection  is  exacerbated  by  undernutrition.  Nearly  one  third  of  Lao\nhouseholds experience insufficient food intake, with women and children suffering most. About 20\npercent  of  babies  born  alive  have  low  birth  weight  (below  2.5  kg.),  in  part  due  to  maternal\nmalnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. An  estimated  41  percent of  children under  the  age of\nfive years suffer from undernutrition; and 12 percent are severely malnourished (footnote 9).\n\n7.\nAmong  adults,  infections  and  pregnancy  complications  are  major  public  health  problems.\nObstetrical complications during delivery are common, averaging about 10 percent of all deliveries,\nand are most frequent in the remote northern provinces. The Lao Social Indicator Survey in 1993\nfound that three-fourths of maternal deaths occur within six weeks of delivery, and one-fourth occur\nduring  pregnancy  (footnote  7).  Deaths  during  pregnancy  result  from  complications  of  induced\nabortion (28 percent); infectious diseases including malaria (25 percent); and other problems such\nas  hemorrhage,  abnormal  presentation,  and  spontaneous  abortion  (22  percent).  Tuberculosis  is\nalso a major public health problem and common cause of death. The population is also facing an\nHIV/AIDS  epidemic  as  international  travel  is  increasing.  According  to  the  Committee  for  the\nPrevention of AIDS, out of 47,762 patients tested up to December 1999, 367 were found to be HIV-\n\n                                                       \n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nPhimmasone K., et. al..

Provinces vary in size from about 70,000 to 700,000\npeople and have 5 to 12 districts, with 10,000 to 100,000 people per district. MOH is at the apex of\na public health system of provincial and district hospitals, and health centers at the subdistrict level.\n\n9.\nMOH  is  responsible for health  sector planning, policy development,  coordination,  external\nfinancing, and evaluation. It was recently reorganized and contains seven departments: (i) Cabinet,\n(ii) Human Resources, (iii)  Inspection,  (iv)  Planning and Budgeting,  (v) Curative,  (vi) Hygiene and\nPrevention,  and  (vii)  Food  and  Drug.  The  Inspection  and  Planning  and  Budgeting  departments\nwere introduced recently. The new structure includes the MOH Steering Committee for Monitoring\nInternational  Assistance,  composed  of  the  minister  and  vice-ministers  and  directors  of  all\ndepartments. The PHC and Rural Development Division was recently established in the Cabinet to\ncoordinate PHC projects and foreign assistance for PHC (para. 29). At least 12 vertical programs\nare  managed  by  technical  institutes  and  MOH  departments,  including  programs  for  (i)  pediatric\ninfectious  diseases,  (ii)  malaria  control,  (iii)  control  of  diarrheal  diseases,  (iv)  control  of  acute\nrespiratory  infections,  (v) reproductive  health,  (vi) micronutrient  deficiencies  and  breastfeeding,\ntransmitted  diseases,  (viii) essential  drugs  supply,\n(vii) control  of  HIV/AIDS  and  sexually \n(ix) primary  eye  care,  (x) tuberculosis  control,  (xi) schistosomiasis  control,  and  (xii)  water  supply\nand sanitation.\n\nThe  provincial  health  office  has  administrative  and  technical  responsibility  for  all  health\n10.\nservices in the province, including the provincial and district hospitals, the network of primary care\nfacilities,  implementation  of  vertical  programs,  and  private  sector  regulation  and  inspection.  The\norganization  and  resources  of  health  services  vary  significantly  among  provinces.  The  provincial\nhospital provides general  referral  services  including  emergency  care  and  surgery.  The  provincial\nhealth system in the Lao PDR is similar to a  district  health  system by World  Health  Organization\n(WHO) standards. Due to the  basic  level of  services and  training  capacity at the  provincial  level,\nthe  Government  plans to strengthen  the  three  regional  centers  to  provide  advanced  training  and\nspecialist referral services such as eye and ear surgery, orthopedics, and gynecology.\n\n11.\nThe district health office is  responsible for  coordinating  health  services  in  the  district.  The\ndistrict hospital is comparable to a health center in many other countries, providing outpatient care,\nbasic inpatient care with 10-15 beds, a maternal and child health (MCH) clinic, outreach services,\nand  logistic  support  and  supervision  of  services  in  the  district.  Each  district  has  50-100  villages.\nBecause  access  to  many  villages  is  difficult,  MOH  has  begun  constructing  subdistrict  health\ncenters  serving  clusters  of  villages.  These  are  staffed  by  nurse  auxiliaries  and  sometimes  a\nmedical assistant to provide basic curative care, mother and child care, and supervision of village\nhealth workers. The geographic coverage of public health services is less than half the population.\n\n12.\nBased on the TA, 33 percent of the population, when ill, first seeks care from the private or\ninformal  sector,  compared  with  28  percent  visiting  a  government  facility  first  (footnote  4).  The\ninformal sector includes drug sellers, birth attendants, traditional healers, and herbalists. There are\nalso  many  retired  nurse  auxiliaries  previously  supported  by  the  agricultural  cooperatives  that\ncovered  nearly  the  entire  country.  These  village  health  care  providers  (VHPs)  are  an  important\nsource of curative care for the villagers.\n\n4.\n\nPrimary Health Care\n\nFollowing  liberation  in  1975,  basic  health  care  coverage  was  achieved  through  the\n13.\ncommune system. After the New Economic Mechanism was adopted in 1989, introducing reforms\n\n\f4\n\ntoward a market economy, the commune system collapsed and funding for health centers dried up,\nresulting  in  a  dramatic  decrease  in  access  to  basic  health  care.  MOH  responded  by  setting  up\ntechnical  institutes  to  implement  selective  health  interventions  through  vertical  programs.  At  the\nsame time, MOH started rebuilding  its  network of  district hospitals  and  health  centers  to develop\nPHC.  Many  small  projects  resulted  in  a  wide  variety  of  PHC  delivery  strategies  with  little\nstandardization,  reflecting  preferences  of  external  funding  agencies.  The  result  is  an  uneven\ndistribution of externally assisted districts adjacent to districts with virtually no PHC support. Since\nthe  1990s,  MOH  has  been  making  efforts  to  increase  PHC  coverage  with  large-scale  projects.\nCurrently,  systematic  efforts  are  being  made  in  7  provinces  to  increase  PHC  coverage  with  the\nhelp  of  external  funding.  However,  in  the  remaining  11  provinces,  PHC  delivery  essentially  is  a\nholdover  from  the  past,  and  none  of  the  provinces  have  achieved  adequate  PHC  coverage,  in\nparticular affecting ethnic minority populations.\n\nThe  vertical  programs \n\nfor  health  education,  malaria  control,  rural  water  supply,\n14.\nimmunization,  and  reproductive  health  have  not  succeeded  in  reaching  a  large  part  of  the\npopulation  due  to  lack  of  local  ownership,  irregularity  of  services,  and  operational  and  resource\nconstraints.  The  malaria  control  program  effectively  reached  24  percent  of  villages,  and  half  the\npopulation  have  access  to  clean  water.  Only  32  percent  of  children  12-23  months  are  fully\nimmunized.  Of  women  of  reproductive  age,  half  are  fully  immunized  with  tetanus  toxoid.  Among\nmarried  couples  of  reproductive  age,  23  percent  use  modern  contraceptives,  compared  with  64\npercent  wanting  to  space  births  or  avoid  more  pregnancies.  However,  knowledge  about\ncontraceptive methods is low. In the household survey in 11 provinces, only 33 percent of married\nwomen aged 15-49 could name at least one modern contraceptive method (footnote 4).\n\n15.\nOutpatient  services  in  public  health  facilities  are  underused  due  to  poor  quality  of  care,\nlimited range of services, and lack of drugs. Each health center has on average 10 outpatients per\nday. There are 68 consultations per 1,000 population per year at district level and 214 at provincial\nlevel. A district hospital will admit on average 450 people per year and a provincial hospital 2,300.\nThe bed occupancy  rate  at  district  and provincial  levels  is  about  40  percent.  Surgical  operations\nand  deliveries  performed  in  hospitals  are  still  low  (footnote  7).  Surgical  services  are  limited  to\nprovincial  hospitals  and  few  district  hospitals,  as  most  district  hospitals  do  not  have  the  staff,\noperating funds, and patient volume to sustain these services. Most health centers perform poorly\nin MCH and birth spacing services. Health education and growth monitoring are usually not done.\nImmunization  is  provided  on  an  outreach  basis  only  once  a  year.  About  72  percent  of  mothers\ndeliver  at  home,  7  percent  in  a  hospital,  and  only  16  percent  deliver  with  the  help  of  a  trained\nmedical  practitioner.  Despite  high  demand,  birth  spacing  services  are  not  available  in  health\ncenters and at the village level that would be more accessible to women. Tuberculosis affects the\npoor  disproportionately.  However,  diagnosis  and  treatment  for  the  disease  are  only  available  at\nprovincial level, making it difficult for the rural poor to access these services.\n\n5.\n\nHealth Sector Financing\n\n16.\nGovernment spending in the health sector has been increasing in real terms since the early\n1990s to 1997/98, following which it decreased in real terms as nominal increases did not keep up\nwith inflation. Public health spending as a share of total Government spending has declined since\nthen  from  about  3  to  2  percent,  while  public  sector  funding  from  other  sources  increased.\nAccording to 1997/98 data, the Government allocated  the  equivalent  of  $6.4  million to the health\nsector,  or 0.36 percent  of  gross domestic  product.  Total expenditures  on health from both  public\nand private sources including for external sources amounted to $55.8 million; about 3.2 percent of\ngross domestic product or $11.50 per capita. Households financed the major share, 58.1 percent\nof  total  expenditures,  or  $6.70  per  person  per  year,  mainly  for  medicines.  External  agencies\n(including  NGOs)  financed  30.4  percent.  The  Government  contributed  11.5  percent  or  $1.3  per\nperson per year.\n\n\f5\n\nUser fees were introduced in 1995 via the Prime Minister\u2019s Decree (PMD) 52, primarily to\n17.\novercome the chronic drug shortage in public facilities. User fees for hospital services relate to (i)\nthe sale of drugs (77 percent), (ii) fees for treatment (10 percent), (iii) diagnostic tests (9 percent),\nand (iv)  other fees  (4 percent).  To  contain  costs at the health center  level,  PMD  52 only  permits\ncollection  of  fees  for  drugs  but  not  for  services.  Fifty  eight  percent  of  patients  at  national  and\nprovincial  hospitals are eligible for free  or  subsidized  services.  These  include  civil  servants  (who\nmake an indirect contribution through social security payments), students, and monks. Poor people\nare also provided subsidized services in hospitals. About 40 percent of patients receive subsidized\nservices in district hospitals, and in health centers this is even less (as discussed in para. 31). The\npoorest household quartile was spending on average $2.4 on health care per month, compared to\n$4.2 by the second quartile, $5 for the third quartile, and $5.5 for the wealthiest group. While the\npoor  are  more  likely  to  capture  subsidized  services,  the  low  expenditure  for  the  poor  may  also\nsuggests that they use health services less.\n\n18.\nData collected for hospitals indicates that revenue from user fees is not only substituting for\nlower  levels  of  government  funding,  but  is  adding  real  resources  for  the  operations  of  these\nfacilities. User fees for drugs contribute 39 percent of the operational budget of district hospitals,10\nexcluding  salaries.  So  far  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  introduction  of  user  charges  has  had  a\ndetrimental effect on overall use of hospitals. On the contrary, patient attendance tends to increase\nfollowing  introduction of a  revolving drug fund,  and this  pattern  is found across ethnic groups.  In\nPak Ou hospital, utilization rates for disadvantaged ethnic groups, women, and children increased.\nAfter  introducing  user  fees.  When  the  distance  of  the  villages  from  the  district  hospital  was\nadjusted, the finding indicates that access and quality of care are more important determinants of\nutilization than ethnic group or income. Only civil servants, which had received free care before the\nintroduction of the revolving drug fund, used services less.\n\n6.\n\nKey Issues\n\nPHC  delivery  by  programs  and  services \n\nthe  country\u2019s  poor\n19.\ncommunication network, the remoteness of its villages, the multiethnic society, the difficult working\nconditions  of  the  civil  servants,  weak  staff  training,  and  financial  constraints.  These  factors\ncontribute  to  poor  access  to  PHC,  unsatisfactory  quality  of  care,  unavailability  of  reproductive\nhealth services, low utilization of services by ethnic minorities, limited PHC management capacity,\nand low salaries and inadequate operational funds for PHC.\n\nis  handicapped  by \n\nLimited Access to PHC\n\n20.\nThe  network  of  PHC  facilities  is  unevenly  distributed,  reflecting  the  pattern  of  external\nsupport. Many villages are more than half a day\u2019s travel from the nearest health facility, and more\nthan a day\u2019s travel from emergency services. Poor people are reluctant to spend time traveling for\nmedical  attention  as  they  loose  time  to  work  for  food.  The  study  of  specific  utilization  rates  per\ncommune  in  Pakkading  district  hospital11  shows  that  the  rate  is  directly  linked  to  the  distance,\ntransportation  possibilities,  and  access  to  other  services.  The  pattern  is \nthe  same  for\nhospitalization in Vangvieng hospital12 where 60 percent of inpatients live near the hospital.\n\n21.\nThe  northern  region  is  mountainous  and  inaccessible,  and  health  education  and\nimmunization coverage of the population in this region is low, in particular among ethnic minorities.\nAccess  to  PHC  is  irregular  and  unsystematic,  especially  in  Bokeo,  Houaphan,  Louang  Namtha,\nand Phongsali provinces. More than 60 percent of the population in these four provinces have no\n                                                       \n10 Dalaloy, P., Minister of Health.

These  provinces  scored  lowest on  indicators  of  PHC  service delivery  and\npreventive health service outcomes. Of 11 provinces surveyed during the TA (footnote 4), only 32\nof  85  districts  have  satisfactory  PHC  coverage.  For  example,  in  Phongsali  Province,  only  11\npercent of villages are within one hour\u2019s travel of a public health facility, and 46 percent within four\nhours  of  a  hospital.  An  estimate  of  health  personnel  productivity  in  a  district  hospital13  showed\nproductivity  of  only  25  percent  of  capacity.  Therefore,  adding  health  centers  to  increase  access\nwould not require a net increase in staff.\n\nInadequate Quality of Care\n\n22.\nDemand for services depends on the quality of care, which to a large extent is determined\nby the availability of skilled staff and medicines. A generic problem in the public health system  is\nthe poor skills of health personnel. A survey among health personnel working at district hospitals in\nXieng  Khouang  and  Oudomxai  revealed  that  many  health  workers  were  unable  to  diagnose  and\ntreat common diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections according to the\nWHO guidelines used in the Lao PDR (footnote 2). Medical personnel lack guidelines to diagnose\nand  treat  common  illnesses  effectively,  and  supervision  is  either  not  done  or  erratic.  In  addition,\nGovernment salaries are so low that most staff can ill afford to work full time in a health facility, or\nbe posted to a remote health centers where they cannot earn an additional income. Health centers\nare  staffed  mostly  by  less  qualified  staff  whose  training  has  not  adequately  prepared  them  for\nclinical  or  managerial  responsibilities.  Therefore,  new  facilities  need  to  be  placed  strategically  to\ntake  into  account  the  socioeconomic  constraints  of  staff,  and  adequate  compensation  and\nincentives should be provided, in particular for staff working in remote locations.\n\n23.\nMedicines and birth spacing commodities are in short supply due to funding, procurement\nand distribution constraints. The introduction of user charges has improved the availability of drugs\nfor  hospital  patients.  However,  the  Government  budget  to  subsidize  drugs  has  remained  small.\nProcurement and distribution constraints have made the availability of medicines very irregular. In\ngeneral,  the  hilly  terrain,  scattered  population,  and  poor  infrastructure  makes  it  more  difficult  to\noperate  remote  health  facilities  and  provide  quality  services.  This  needs  to  be  taken  into\nconsideration when planning the extension of the network of health services.\n\nLack of Reproductive Health Services\n\n24.\nMaternal  morbidity,  mortality  and  disability  are  unacceptably  high,  and  there  is  a  large\nunmet demand for birth spacing. In addition, there are increasing risks of an HIV/AIDS epidemic for\nwhich  the  population  is  ill  prepared.  The  provinces  are  trying  to  address  the  gap  in  reproductive\nhealth  services  by  operating  a  separate  program  in  each  province  managed  by  a  team  of\nprofessional  and  dedicated  staff.  In  addition,  the  United  Nations  Fund  for  Population  Activities\n(UNFPA) and other external agencies support MOH to strengthen the reproductive health program.\n\nHowever,  at  the  health  center  level  services  are  mostly  curative,  and  MCH  and  birth\n25.\nspacing services are generally not available or are provided  irregularly  at  limited  hours.  Reasons\ninclude  lack  of  trained  staff,  equipment,  and  supplies.  Also  at  first  referral  level,  the  facilities  for\nroutine delivery and emergency obstetric care are highly inadequate, lacking all kinds of equipment\nand supplies. In addition, the operating budget for MCH and birth spacing services  is  inadequate\nso that staff training, supervision, and campaigns are severely restricted. For example, in Louang\nNamtha Province the entire operating budget for the MCH team was estimated at $450 per month.\nThese are compelling arguments to support expanding MCH services and improve its financing.\n\n                                                       \n13 Noel,  A.

CCL.  1992.\n\nVientiane.\n\n\fLow Use of Health Services by Ethnic Minorities\n\n7\n\n26.\nSpecific factors affect low use of health services by ethnic minorities. First, the geographical\ndistribution  of  health  facilities  affects  the  use  of  health  services  by  ethnic  minorities.  The  ethnic\nminorities  more often  live  in  scattered  hamlets  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas  that  have  very\npoor infrastructure and that are only accessible in the dry season. It is very difficult and expensive\nto  provide  health  services  in  these  areas.  While  the  majority  ethnic  group  mostly  live  in  the\nlowlands, the ethnic minorities mainly live on the slopes such as Mon-Khmer, and top of  the hills\nsuch as the Hmong and the very poor Tibeto-Burman groups. They need certain essential services\nthat are often not in the standard package of health centers, such as iodine supplementation and\ntuberculosis  treatment.  Ethnic  groups  living  in  remote  areas  may  also  not  know  about  the\navailability of modern health services, or not have the time and energy to seek treatment a day\u2019s\nwalk or more from their home, requiring them to sleep overnight at the health center.\n\n27.\nAlso  where  health  services  are  accessible,  use  by  ethnic  minorities  may  still  be  low.  In\naddition to concerns about the appropriateness of the health services, they often cite poverty as a\nreason for not seeking medical treatment, or fear they will not be able to pay for the services. Most\nethnic  minorities  subsist  on  shifting  cultivation,  hunting, and  collecting forest  products.  Less  than\n10 percent are engaged in commercial activities, and households often do not have cash or goods\nto pay for transport, consultation, and any medicines required. Sociocultural factors may also affect\nutilization of health services. An important factor is language, as more than 85 percent of minority\nfemales  do  not  speak  Lao,  while  less  than  5  percent  of  health  workers  come  from  an  ethnic\nminority  background.  Ethnic  groups  also  rely  on  spiritual  healing,  particularly  where  modern\ntreatment  is  unavailable.  The  differences  in  views  between  staff  and  ethnic  minorities  may  also\naffect the relationship. Accordingly, it is important to train local people as health staff. Most villages\nhave  at  least  one  private-sector  VHP,  who  may  be  a  medical  practitioner,  birth  attendant,\ntraditional healer or volunteer from the community. While VHPs are locally accepted as health care\nproviders, their practices are unregulated, their skills questionable, and their supplies limited. They\nusually do not provide preventive and promotive services. There are many possible causes of low\nuse by ethnic minorities, and each situation should be assessed separately.\n\nWeak PHC Management Capacity\n\n The PHC management system is in its infancy and PHC management capacity is limited.\n28.\nUntil recently, MOH did not have an organizational entity empowered to coordinate PHC services,\nprograms, and projects funded by external agencies. Many projects followed their own design from\nwhich much has been learned, but the projects are difficult to coordinate and  monitor.  More  than\nhalf  the  managers  have  not  been  trained  in  public  health  management.  Essential  management\nsystems, such as for planning, monitoring, and supervision are not available or not being used for\ndecision  making  by  the  managers,  as  these  are  often  complex  or  irrelevant. Weak  management\ncapacity  has  resulted  in  inadequate  coordination,  standardization,  monitoring,  and  comparability;\nand management is essentially reactive.\n\n29. When MOH was reorganized under PMD 20 in 1999, the MOH Steering Committee for the\nSupervision  of  International  Cooperation  was  created  (para.  9)  under  the  supervision  of  the\nMinister of Health. It is empowered to make strategic policy decisions for the health sector. A PHC\nand Rural Development Division has been created in the Cabinet to coordinate the national PHC\nprogram,  including  planning,  coordination  of  external  assistance,  monitoring  and  evaluation.\nProvincial PHC coordination units will be established in all provincial health offices. This will be the\nfirst time that distinct organizational units will be in place to coordinate PHC activities.\n\nInsufficient Financing of PHC\n\nThe $11.50 per capita spending on all curative and preventive health care in the Lao PDR\n30.\nfalls  well  short  of  the  estimated  $15.00  per  capita  required  to  provide  essential  PHC  services\n\n\f8\n\nalone.14  Government  financing  of  health  care  in  the  Lao  PDR  through  direct  subsidies  has\nincreased  since  the  early  1990s  in  nominal  terms.  However,  inflation  has  decreased  the  real\npurchasing power of these increases, and the level of real Government subsidies has decreased.\n\n31.\nFollowing PMD 52, fees are charged for drugs, treatment, laboratory tests, x-rays, hospital\nrooms, medical supplies, and documents. The fees cover supplies only, with a mark-up of about 25\npercent for management, transport, and pilferage. Other variable and fixed costs  of  providing  the\nservice are not included in the price, and the prices charged for services in hospitals have not kept\nup with inflation. Prices that do not sufficiently offset these costs result in PHC services that are not\nsustainable,  and  do  not  allow  savings  for  cross-subsidization.  PMD  52  also  provides  that  20\npercent of fees collected for services are passed on to the central Government. This \u201ctax\u201d could be\nused  for  cross-subsidy  among  provinces  and  monitoring  of  revenue,  but  should  preferably  be\nretained locally.\n\n32.\nAlthough the Government is committed to affordable health services for all, it is increasingly\ndepending on the public to pay for health services. However, the poor may not be able to fully pay\nfor  inpatient  services  and  procedures  such  as  caesarian  sections  for  catastrophic  illnesses,  and\nmay be reluctant to use outpatient care because of user charges. Fortunately, many needy hospital\npatients receive subsidized treatment. However, health center staff are more reluctant to wave or\nreduce charges as supplies are limited and it is socially difficult to help some and exclude others at\nthe community level. The possible effect of user charges on the public in general and the poor and\nethnic minorities in particular needs to be examined thoroughly in order to plan for improvements.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policy and Plans\n\nThe  Lao  People\u2019s  Revolutionary  Party  Congress  aims  to  ensure  that  health  service\n33.\nprovision is expanded to the entire population at the grassroots level; the quality of health services\nis  improved;  and  vulnerable  groups,  including  mothers  and  children,  receive  more  attention.\nConsistent  with  this  mandate,  MOH  has  adopted  the  PHC  approach,  which  aims  to  achieve  the\ninternational  goal  of  \u201chealth  for  all\u201d  by  making  basic  health  services,  including  first  referral  care,\navailable  to  the  entire  population  in  an  integrated  manner  and  with  full  participation  of  the\ncommunity. With  ADB  support,  MOH  has prepared  a  PHC policy  (see  footnote  1)  that  describes\nthe  strategic  priorities,  delivery  system,  and  organizational  structures  that  will  guide  PHC\nexpansion  in  the  future.  The  policy,  approved  in  February  2000,  provides  a  clear  vision  for\nstrengthening  the  health  system,  capacity  building,  mobilizing  resources,  and  improving  health\nsector  performance  toward  health  for  all.  The  Cabinet  of  MOH  has  recently  been  assigned  to\ncoordinate  the  implementation  of  the  policy.  For  this  purpose,  the  new  PHC  and  Rural\nDevelopment Division has been created as one of the five divisions of the Cabinet. The division will\nprovide  PHC  guidelines,  coordinate  PHC  programs  and  externally  funded  PHC  activities,  and\nmonitor and evaluate PHC. The Government will also establish provincial PHC coordination units\nto strengthen the coordination of services, vertical programs, and projects at the provincial level.\n\n34.\nThe PHC policy identifies nine  basic  components  of  PHC:  (i) improvements  in quality  and\nexpansion  of  the  network  of  health  facilities;  (ii)  health  education;  (iii)  clean  water  and\nenvironmental  sanitation;  (iv)  immunization;  (v)  MCH  and  birth  spacing  services;  (vi)  nutrition;\n(vii) prevention  and  control  of  common  diseases;  (viii)  treatment  of  the  most  common  diseases;\nand (ix) essential drugs and revolving drug funds.\n\n35.\nAccording to the PHC Policy and Investment Plan, the design of the PHC network begins at\nthe  grassroots  level  and  progressively  grows  to  regional  PHC  referral  facilities.  Each  level  is\nresponsible  for  providing  PHC  services,  and  supporting,  supervising,  coordinating,  and  referring\npatients in a systematic fashion. Trained private sector VHPs with essential drug kits are planned\nfor  villages  that  do  not  have  access  to  government  health  centers.  Strategically  placed  health\n\n                                                       \n14 1993 World Bank estimate adjusted for inflation rate to 1997/98 dollars for comparison purposes.\n\n\f9\n\ncenters  with  three  or  more  trained  health  workers  will  serve  clusters  of  villages.  Small  district\nhospitals  with  15-20  beds  are  designed  to  serve  as  the  first  level  of  PHC  referral.  Provincial\nhospitals and regional referral facilities are responsible for more advanced medical treatments.\n\n36.\nThe policy framework and political commitment for birth spacing has improved recently. In\nNovember 1999, the Government adopted the National Population and Development Policy, which\nrecognized  the  adverse  consequences  of  high  fertility  to  the  health  of  Lao  women  and  children,\nand to the economy and well-being of the family. The policy aims to (i) achieve a rate of population\ngrowth  compatible  with  socioeconomic  development;  (ii)  motivate  and  assist  people  to  improve\ntheir quality of life by ensuring safe motherhood, reducing morbidity and mortality associated with\nthe  reproductive  health  system,  and  enabling  couples  to  freely  and  responsibly  decide  upon  the\nnumber and spacing of their children; (iii) improve the status of women and ethnic populations by\neliminating  disparities;  (iv) promote  a  balanced  population  distribution;  and  (v)  incorporate\npopulation factors and concerns in all policies and plans.\n\n37.\nBased  on  the  PHC  investment  plan,  MOH  is  planning  to  mobilize  additional  funds  from\ninternal and external sources to develop PHC. In addition, MOH  is  planning  to  revise  PMD  52  to\nstreamline cost recovery in hospitals and drug revolving funds in health centers. This will be based\non  further  analysis  of  sources  and  uses  of  funds  in  health  facilities  and  pilot  tests  in  selected\nfacilities.  Following  developments  in  the  formal  sector,  MOH  is  also  planning  to  develop  risk-\npooling schemes in the informal sector.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n38.\nThe  Lao  PDR  is  receiving  substantial  external  assistance  in  the  health  sector,  and  such\nassistance  accounted  for  an  estimated  30.4  percent  of  total  health  expenditures  in  1998.  Major\nfunding agencies are the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAid), the European\nCommission,  the  Germanische  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  the  World  Bank  and  United\nNations  agencies.  Fifteen agencies provide  71 percent  of foreign  assistance  to  the  health  sector\nand  87 percent  of  the foreign  assistance  for  PHC.  Multilateral  assistance  contributed  about  $5.1\nmillion or 37 percent and bilateral assistance about $8.6 million or 63 percent. A list of projects with\nsource of funding, outcome, and lesson learned is in Appendix 3.\n\nThe  first  ADB  loan  to  the  Lao  PDR  health  sector  was  the  PHC  Project  in  1995,  which\n39.\ninstalled a PHC network of health centers and district hospitals in Xieng Khouang and Oudomxai\nprovinces.  Concurrently,  the  World  Bank  funded  the  Health  System  Reform  and  Malaria  Control\nProject  in  Savannakhet,  Xekong,  the  Xaysomboune  Special  Zone,  and  the  Boloven  Plateau.\nAusAid  is  supporting  two  PHC  projects:  the  Health  and  Social  Development  Project  in  three\ndistricts of Phongsali Province and five districts of Houaphan Province, which commenced in 1997;\nand the Sayaburi PHC Project being implemented through Save the Children Fund Australia, which\ncommenced in 1991. These projects  are  in  the  proposed  project  area and  can be  considered  as\nsuccessful pilot  projects.  The  GTZ-supported  Lao-German  Family  Health  Project  in  Bolikhamxay\nProvince started in 1996 and has innovative features from which much can be learned. The Swiss\nRed  Cross  supports  PHC  in  Louang  Phrabang  and  M\u00e9decins  Sans  Fronti\u00e8res  in  Bokeo,\nChampassak,  and  Xekong  provinces.  In  addition,  there  are  many  small  NGO  managed  PHC\nprojects supported by bilateral and other funding agencies that are very diverse in their approach.\n\n40.\nSupport for vertical programs is also substantial. The Expanded Program  of  Immunization\nreceives  financial  support  from  AusAid,  the  Japanese  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),\nLuxembourg,  UNICEF,  and  WHO.  The  nationwide  malaria  control  program  receives  assistance\nfrom  the  European  Union,  JICA,  and  the  World  Bank.  UNFPA\u2019s  Second  Country  Program  will\nexpand reproductive health training throughout the country but the budget is insufficient to supply\ncontraceptives  for  the  whole  country.  United  Nations  agencies  against  AIDS  (UNAIDS)  supports\nthe HIV/AIDS control program. A consortium, including ADB, GTZ, JICA, the Swedish International\nDevelopment Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank, assists the Clean Water Program.\n\n\f10\n\nThe  various  external  interests  have  led  to  a  potpourri  of  PHC  projects  with  different\n41.\nimplementation strategies. Much has been learned from this diversity, including the need to  tailor\nprojects to local  conditions  and  population  characteristics.  The disadvantages are  the  substantial\ngaps  in  coverage,  the  difficulties  in  integrating  the  projects  in  the  network  of  PHC  services,  and\nproblems  replicating  and  sustaining  these  services.  In  particular  monitoring,  supply,  and\naccounting systems need to be standardized.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n42.\nThrough its first loan to the Lao PDR health sector, ADB has gained valuable experience.\nThe  first  ADB  project  was  implemented  on  time  and  led  to  a  marked  increase  in  use  of  health\nservices and in health outcomes in the targeted population. Important lessons learned, along with\nthose gained from partner organizations, include the following.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nExpansion of the public health system through subdistrict health centers and training\nof private sector VHPs significantly increases accessibility to basic health services.\n\nConstruction of health centers in remote and inaccessible areas of the mountainous\nnorthern provinces in the Lao PDR is a major undertaking. In consultation with the\ncommunity, health centers should be placed strategically to maximize accessible for\npatients, staff, supplies and supervision.\n\nThe  success  of  health  centers  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  deploy\ncompetent health personnel from the province or district. A health center should not\nbe constructed until all staff have been assigned. A health center should have three\nfull-time staff, so that two can travel together for outreach activities in the villages.\n\nSuccessful PHC projects require a project management structure that decentralizes\nresponsibility  and  authority  from  the  central  level  to  the  provinces  where  activities\nare  being  implemented.  It  is  not  possible  to  successfully  manage  projects  with\nheavily centralized management and disbursement procedures.\n\nSuccessful  PHC  projects  depend  on  the  ability  to  procure  civil  works,  medicines,\nother  supplies,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  expeditiously.  Delays  in\nprocurement translate into  exponential  delays  in  implementation.  Large-scale  PHC\nprojects  need  a  procurement  unit  with  competent  staff  using  streamlined\nprocurement procedures to deliver the goods on time.\n\nCost recovery for health care goods and services is used widely in the Lao PDR at\nevery level. At provincial hospitals and district hospitals, cost recovery fees account\nfor 60 percent of operating revenue. Every PHC project in the Lao PDR has some\nform of cost recovery at health centers. In Khammouan and Borikhamxai provinces,\nvillage  health  volunteers  are  successfully  charging  for  essential  drugs.  VHPs  are\nalso routinely charging for their services.\n\n(vii) \n\nSustainability of PHC  projects  must  be  well-planned during  project design.  Human\nand  financial  resources  required  to  sustain  the  PHC  projects  must  be  accurately\nforecast  and  proven  methods,  such  as  cost  recovery,  carefully  integrated  in  the\ndesign to ensure continued operation.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n\n43. Within  the  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction,  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  Lao\nPDR  aims  to  (i)  support  sustainable  economic  growth  and  investments  supporting  the  local\n\n\f11\n\neconomy; and (ii) strengthen the policy and institutional framework necessary to convert aggregate\nincome  growth  into  balanced,  equitable,  and  sustainable  growth.  ADB  also  gives  high  priority  to\nwomen\u2019s development and  population  planning,  and  improving  governance.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in\nthe health sector supports policy reform, institutional development, and provision of PHC to provide\nequitable  services  and  support  human  development.  ADB\u2019s  overall  health  sector  policy15\nemphasizes a focus on PHC to increase cost-effectiveness of investments; reach the poor, women,\nand other vulnerable groups; and improve governance in the sector.\n\n44.\nDuring  the  last  four  years,  ADB  has  focused  on  the  improvement  of  PHC  in  two  rural\nprovinces.  The  PHC  project  was  designed  explicitly  to  pilot  test  a  mechanism  for  establishing  a\nrural PHC system based on health centers at the subdistrict level staffed and supervised by trained\nand  full-time  MOH  personnel.  During  the  1997  country  programming  mission,  the  Government\nindicated  that  it gave  high  priority to the  development  of  PHC and, accordingly,  ADB\u2019s  Lao  PDR\ncountry assistance plan includes the PHC Expansion Project.\n\n45.\nADB  is  supporting the  PHC  policy  and  institutional capacity  of  the  Government  to  ensure\nthat  PHC  investments  are  effective,  efficient,  equitably  distributed,  and  sustainable.  ADB  plans\nsupport to expand the PHC network and referral facilities to rural geographical areas where little or\nno  access  to  PHC  services  exist.  ADB  also  plans  to  support  the  Government  with  institutional\ncapacity building for PHC management and to strengthen health sector financing.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n46.\nExtensive policy dialogue was held with MOH about making effective and affordable health\nservices available to the entire population. Key policy themes that have been discussed  between\nthe  ADB  Mission  and  MOH  are  (i) targeting  disadvantaged  populations  including  women  and\nchildren, the poor and ethnic minorities; (ii) capacity building to improve health sector performance;\nand (iii) improving financial sustainability and efficiency of public health services.\n\nTargeting  Disadvantaged  Populations.  Within  the  context  of  poverty  reduction  and  the\n47.\nright  to  health  care  for  all,  ADB  discussed  the  Government\u2019s  approach  to  make  essential  health\ncare  available  to  all.  The  Government  is  pursuing  this  through  (i)  strengthening  the  policy  and\nstrategic framework for PHC, (ii) targeted health services and human resources developments, and\n(iii) improving affordability of services for the poor.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  development  of  PHC  policy  guidelines  and  an  investment  plan,  and  the\npreparation  of  provincial  plans  and  budgets  will  help  focus  on  the  needs  of  the\ndisadvantaged. ADB will support this through a proposed advisory  TA.  In  addition,\nthe Project will support regular evaluation of health services benefits to the poor and\nethic minorities.\n\nMOH will give high priority to placement of health facilities in poor and underserved\npopulations,  in  particular  ethnic  minorities,  and  will  give  high  priority  to  services\nbenefiting the poor most. MOH and ADB concur on the need to increase indigenous\nstaff and female staff in areas populated by ethnic minorities, to ensure acceptability\nof services. An ethnic minorities plan was prepared and it  was agreed  to  establish\nthree  provincial  training  programs  in  the  northern  area  especially  for  candidate\nhealth workers from ethnic minority groups. The programs  will  become operational\nwithin two years of loan effectiveness.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Project  will  support  MOH  to  provide  affordable  PHC  for  the  poor  through  the\nprovision  of  low  cost  drugs,  more  accessible  services  that  reduce  travel  and\nopportunity  costs,  and  exploration  of  alternative  financing  mechanisms.  Extensive\n\n                                                       \n15 ADB. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector. Manila: ADB.\n\n\f12\n\ndialogue  was  held  on  ways  to  ensure  that  user  charges  do  not  undermine  use  of\nservices  by  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities.  With  the  support  of  the  proposed\nadvisory  TA  and  the  Project,  financial  studies  will  be  done  to  test  strategies  to\nimprove the subsidy system at both hospitals and health center levels.\n\nCapacity Building. ADB and MOH discussed the capacity constraints to implementing the\n48.\nnew PHC policy and improving the health sector\u2019s performance. ADB will assist MOH with advisory\nTA for capacity building in PHC to build the capacity of the PHC coordination units in the provinces\nand  develop  PHC  management  systems  within  the  next  three  years.  The  Project  will  build\nprovincial  and  district  PHC  management  capacity,  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  decision  to\ndelegate  strategic  planning  to  the  provinces  and  eventually  make  districts  responsible  for\nbudgeting and implementation.\n\nFinancial Sustainability and Efficiency. Extensive policy dialogue was held on improving\n\n49.\ncost-effectiveness, cost containment, and financing in the health sector.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\nMOH  will  improve  health  sector  spending  by  allocating  more  of  the  budget  to\ninterventions  of  high  cost-effectiveness,  in  particular  preventive  and  promotive\nservices.  The  budget \nimmunization,  safe\nmotherhood,  birth  spacing  and  HIV/AIDS  education,  is  low  and  needs  to  be\nincreased. This issue has been taken up in the PHC policy of MOH and during the\nproject design, and will be incorporated in the annual provincial health budgets.\n\nfor  MCH  services, \n\nincluding \n\nfor \n\nIn  terms  of  cost  containment,  MOH  will  continue  to  limit  the  recruitment  of  staff  in\ngeneral,  but  train  and  recruit  ethnic  minority  staff  for  ethnic  minority  populations.\nMOH is also containing the expansion of the network of health facilities. Extensive\nmapping is being done to select locations for new health facilities that are in areas\nwith needy populations, that can be properly managed and supervised, and to which\nexcess  hospital  staff  can be posted.  Realizing  that  international  standards  are  not\nattainable  in  the  short  term,  the  priority  is  to  give  households  access  to  health\nservices  within half  a day\u2019s  walk,  with the  option of an  overnight stay,  at  locations\nthat  are  convenient  for  patients  and  staff.  To  make  basic  health  care  more\naccessible  in  scattered  and  small  hamlets,  MOH  will  train  VHPs  and  expand\noutreach services in a phased manner.\n\n(iii) \n\nIn the next three years, MOH will be exploring various strategies to improve health\nsector financing with the support of the proposed advisory TA and the Project. The\nproposed  strategies  will  focus  on  streamlining  cost  recovery  systems  at  hospital\nlevel, establishing drug revolving funds at the health  center and  village  levels,  and\ndeveloping  a  provincial  risk  pooling  system  for  the  informal  sector  in  addition  to\nsimilar efforts in the formal sector.\n\nIV.THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n50.\nThe Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in the Asian and Pacific Region, with half of\nthe  population  living  in  poverty.  The  rural  poor,  in  particular  women  and  children  and  ethnic\nminorities living in the inaccessible northern hills, suffer from extremely poor health. The network of\nhealth facilities in the northern provinces has inadequate coverage and provides a limited range of\ncurative services of substandard quality. More than half the rural population do not have access to\npreventive and promotive services and first referral care in these northern provinces.\n\n\f13\n\n51.\nThe  Government,  as  a  cornerstone  of  its  social  policy,  accords  high  priority  to  the\nimprovement  of  the  health  status  of  the  population.  PHC  has  been  identified  as  the  most  cost-\neffective  approach  to  provide  basic  health  services.  The  Government  recently  approved  a  PHC\npolicy  that  aims  to  make  a  basic  package  of  health  care  available  to  the  entire  population,  and\nrestructured MOH in support of PHC. The Government has requested ADB to support  expansion\nand  improvement  of  PHC  delivery,  strengthening  of  PHC  planning  and  management,  and\ndevelopment of effective financing mechanisms. The Government gives high priority to  improving\nthe health status of women and children, ethnic minorities, and the rural poor.\n\nSeveral strategies to reach the scattered rural population have been considered, including\n52.\nthe construction of many small health centers, the provision of mobile clinics, training of volunteers,\ntraining of paid village health workers, and partnership with private VHPs. ADB\u2019s first PHC Project\ndemonstrated that, while recognizing the needs of some of the poorest ethnic minorities, it was not\nfeasible  and  cost-effective  to  build  facilities  and  employ  full-time  staff  in  low-density  populations\nliving in remote locations. Instead, the Project will selectively expand the network of public facilities\nin  strategic  locations  that  are  both  accessible  for  Government  staff  and  as  close  to  the  target\npopulation  as  possible.  To  increase  access  to  rural  villagers  in  general  and  ethnic  minority\npopulations in particular, the Project will explore partnerships with VHPs. As routine curative care\nwill  be  shared  with  VHPs,  public  resources  can  then  be  more  equitably  allocated  to  priority\ninterventions and subsidies for the poor. Forming partnerships with private sector providers instead\nof recruiting paid village health workers also avoids recruiting more health staff, and increases the\nlikelihood of sustaining service delivery.\n\n53.\nUnder the current PHC project, contractual workers were hired to staff new health centers.\nThe  disadvantage  of  this  approach  is  the  low  quality  of  these  contractual  workers,  and  the\nadditional  recurrent  cost  it  imposes.  Productivity  of  health  personnel  could  be  increased  by\nredistributing excess personnel to peripheral health centers. However, most health staff depend on\nadditional sources of income to supplement the low Government salary and cannot afford to move\nto a place where they cannot augment their income. To make redistribution possible on a voluntary\nbasis, transferred staff will be offered incentives and, where needed, a  hardship allowance.  In all\nprovinces, the population is a patchwork of ethnic groups. For example, 24 ethnic minority groups\nmake up 90 percent of the population in Phongsali Province. However, few health workers are from\nthese ethnic minorities, causing cultural and language barriers  in delivering  services.  The Project\nwill therefore increase the training of ethnic minorities, so that health centers will have at least one\nstaff likely to speak the local language.\n\n54.\nTo ensure that health facilities are being used adequately, the quality of care needs to be\nimproved.  An  evaluation  of  beneficiary  perceptions16  revealed  that  beneficiaries  perceive  the\navailability  of  drugs,  the  presence  of  qualified  staff,  and  good  contact  with  health  workers  as\nindicators of quality. In one project,17 use increased by 75 percent in Pakkading district hospital, 51\npercent in Pak Ou district hospital, and 46 percent in Paksan provincial hospital when the quality of\ncare  improved  with  the  help  of  revolving  drug  funds  that  were  making  quality  drugs  available  at\nprices  lower  than  those  at  private  pharmacies.18  Accordingly,  a  comprehensive  approach  will  be\nfollowed to improve the quality of PHC services, including staff development at all levels, improving\nsupply  systems  and  supervision,  and  strengthening  the  role  of  the  provincial  hospitals  in  quality\ncontrol.\n\n55.\nThe  development  of  an  integrated  PHC  system  delivering  more  comprehensive  services\nrequires more capacity at the provincial and district levels than a patchwork of centrally controlled\nprograms and projects. It is therefore necessary to develop a new PHC management structure and\nmanagement systems and skills in support of PHC. With the expansion of health services, it is also\n                                                       \n16 Chanthala  P,  Phoutthalath  V.

The Project  objective  is  to  improve  PHC  coverage for  the  rural\npoor  by  (i) expanding  and \nthe  northern  region,  and\n(ii) strengthening the institutional capacity for PHC. Provinces in the north were chosen for the first\ncomponent  because  of  the  (i) poor  health  status,  in  particular  among  the  ethnic  minorities;  and\n(ii) large  gaps  in  the  PHC  coverage.  The  second  component  is  nationwide,  as  the  Government\nwants all provinces to fully participate in and contribute to the nationwide process of planning PHC\ndevelopment  and  integration  of  services  under  the  new  PHC  policy.  To  do  so  requires\nstrengthening of the provincial capacity for PHC coordination.\n\nthe  quality  of  PHC \n\nimproving \n\nin \n\n57.\nThe  Project  will  target  women  and  children,  ethnic  minorities,  and  the  rural  poor  by\n(i) increasing  their  physical,  social,  and  financial  access  to  essential  services;  (ii)  focusing  on\ninterventions  and  diseases  that  affect  them  mostly;  and  (iii)  improving  the  quality  of  services  for\nthese  groups.  The  Project  will  give  priority  to  cost-effective  interventions  benefiting  women  and\nchildren including health promotion, MCH and birth spacing services, the prevention and treatment\nof common infections and micronutrient deficiencies, and first referral services.\n\n1.\n\nComponent 1: Improving Access to Quality PHC in the northern region\n\n58.\nThe  first  component  will  develop  PHC  in  eight  provinces  in  the  northern  region  by\n(i) increasing  access  to  PHC,  (ii) improving  the  quality  of  care,  (iii)  strengthening  reproductive\nhealth services, and (iv) promoting village health care. The Project will support PHC development\nat all levels in six provinces, namely Bokeo, Houaphan, Louang Namtha, Oudomxai, Phongsali and\nXieng Khouang. In addition, the Project will support the improvement of referral services in these\nprovinces and Louang Phrabang and Sayaburi.  The  total population of  the  eight  provinces  is  1.7\nmillion, about 62 percent of who are poor and 38 percent very poor. 19 Project activities below the\nprovincial level will be limited to 34 out of 61 districts, complementary to the PHC support of other\nexternal agencies, with a total population of 0.9 million.\n\na.\n\nIncreasing Access to Primary Health Care\n\n59.\nEssential  Primary  Care.  MOH  plans  to  provide  comprehensive  packages  of  essential\nprimary care services in all district hospitals and several strategically located health centers in each\ndistrict (the packages are summarized in Appendix 4). To improve coverage of health services, the\nProject will construct two type A and 39 type B health centers, and renovate six health centers to\nfill the  gaps  in  the  network of health  services  in  the northern  area.  The facilities  will  include  staff\nquarters, overnight accommodation, and water supply if needed.  Type B health  centers  will  have\nthree rooms: one for curative care, one for MCH and birth spacing services, and one for overnight\naccommodation,  observation  and  care.  Type  A  health  centers  will  have  six  rooms.  A  total  of  57\nhealth  centers  will  be  equipped.  The  health  centers  will  support  outreach  services  including\nimmunization, drug kit supply to VHPs, and training and supervision of health staff and VHPs. The\nProject  will  also construct  5  district hospitals,  renovate or  upgrade  11,  and  equip  18.  In  total,  42\ndistrict health services will be supported with motorcycles, equipment, and supplies.\n\nThe  expansion  of  the  network  of  PHC  facilities  is  kept  modest  to  ensure  cost-effective\n60.\nprovision of health services. The location of new facilities is based on an extensive  mapping and\nconsultation  exercise that examines population density,  location  of  ethnic  minorities,  coverage  of\n\n                                                       \n19 Based on the latest analysis of the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey of 1997-98 (footnote 6), 59.3 percent of\n\nthe population in these eight provinces is considered poor and 24.6 percent very poor.\n\n\f15\n\nexisting facilities, plans for expansion of rural access roads,20 and consultation with local authorities\nand  beneficiaries.  It  is  closely  coordinated  with  other  external  assistance  projects  in  these\nprovinces to ensure that there is no overlap in services. Construction of health centers will require\nan agreement with the local community representatives. Construction will not start until a person of\nthe predominant ethnic minority has started training to become a member of the health staff. The\ncommunity will, where feasible, contribute labor and materials for the health center and  construct\nstaff houses. This contribution is estimated to be up to 18 percent of construction costs.\n\n61.\nFirst  Referral  Services.  The  provinces  have  an  average  population  of  about  250,000,\ncomparable to small districts in many other countries. The provincial hospitals provide first referral\nservices, including basic obstetric and surgical services, and staff training. To improve first referral\nservices, the  Project  will  upgrade Louang  Phrabang, Phongsali  and  Sayaburi  hospitals;  renovate\nBokeo, Houaphan, and Xieng Khouang hospitals; and construct new hospitals in Louang Namtha\nand Oudomxai because of the deplorable state of their current hospitals. Construction will include\nfacilities for MCH and birth spacing clinics; basic surgical, obstetric, pediatric, and medical inpatient\ncare;  laboratory  services;  and  staff  training.  The  Project  will  also  support  the  expansion  of  first\nreferral  services to  seven  of  the  larger  district  hospitals.  These  district  hospitals  will  be  provided\nwith  facilities  and  equipment  for  emergency  surgical  services,  including  obstetric  surgery.  The\nProject  will  also  provide  scholarships  for  postgraduate  training  of  medical  officers  and  nurses  in\nsurgery and anesthesia and will establish laboratory services, including blood transfusion services,\nfor the seven hospitals. Telecommunication  and  ambulance  services  will  be  made  available  in  at\nleast nine district hospitals.\n\n \n\nb.\n\nImproving Quality of Care\n\nDelivering quality health care depends on many factors including staff availability, staff skills\n62.\nand  motivation,  adequacy  of  equipment  and  supplies,  regular  supervision,  and  competent\nmanagement. The Project will address several shortfalls to improve the quality of services.\n\nStaff Redistribution. The plan is to have one medical assistant or nurse and two auxiliary\n63.\nnurses in each health center, including at least one female and one person from the predominant\nethnic minority in the area. To compensate for the shortage of staff in health centers, the  Project\nwill support redistribution of excess hospital staff who volunteer to go to health centers. To  make\nthis  possible  with  low  salaries,  staff  will  be  provided  with  incentives  to  compensate  for  loss  of\nincome,  including  possibly  accommodation,  motorcycle  or  bicycle,  training,  certificate  for  good\nperformance, and promotion  opportunities.  In  addition,  staff  working  in  remote health centers  will\nreceive  a  hardship  allowance.  Staff  will  be  transferred  back  to  a  hospital  if  they  request  for  a\ntransfer after two to three years of service in a remote location. Rewards for good performance will\nbe provided in a transparent and objective manner based on reports of supervision  visits, patient\nsatisfaction  and  community  evaluation.  Staff  doing  fieldwork  and  supervision  will  be  provided  a\nsmall per diem and compensation for transport expenses.\n\n64.\nPreservice Training.  To  compensate  for  the  shortage  of  staff  from  ethnic  minorities,  the\nProject will increase the regional training capacity for auxiliary nurses or equivalent staff. Training\nprograms will be established in Louang Phrabang, Oudomxai, and Xieng Khouang. Priority will be\ngiven to selecting ethnic minority staff living near health centers. They will sign an agreement with\nthe  Government  that  they  will  work  in  the  health  center  near  their  home  for  at  least  five  years\nfollowing completion of training. In return, the Government will agree to employ the ethnic minority\npersons within three months following successful completion of the training. Civil works for a health\ncenter under the Project will not be started until a person from an underrepresented ethnic minority\nfrom the catchment area of the health center has been admitted to the training program. Selected\nethnic  minority  persons  should  have  basic  education  to  be  eligible  for  the  one-year  technical\ntraining  program.  Those  with  insufficient basic  education  will  be  sponsored  to  obtain  preparatory\n\n                                                       \n20 Including ADB\u2019s proposed Lao Rural Access Road Project.\n\n\f16\n\ngeneral  education.  The  schools  in  Oudomxai  and  Xieng  Khouang  will  be  upgraded  so  that  all\nschools  have  two  classrooms  and  dormitories  for  a  total  of  40  people,  including  for  in-service\ntraining. The Project will also support the three schools with regional teacher training, allowances\nfor about 240 students, equipment, furniture, and training material.\n\nIn-Service  Training.  The  Project  will  seek  to  institutionalize  in-service  training  in  the\n65.\ntargeted provinces based on the lessons learned from other projects, with the general purpose of\nmaking skilled staff available at all levels. The focus  will be on  general  management  of  services,\nMCH,  birth  spacing,  management  of  common  infections,  and  training  and  support  of  VHPs.\nProvincial  and  district  staff  will  be  trained  in  management,  supervision,  and  clinical  care.  The\ntraining program will be managed by the provincial health offices in collaboration with all external\nagencies active in the province. Consulting services will be provided to institutionalize the training\nprogram. Five provinces will be provided with in-service training facilities, with one classroom and\ndormitory for 20 people as part of the provincial hospital complex. The indicative training program\nis in Appendix 5.\n\n66.\nSupervision. The Project will support the provincial team to conduct monthly supervision of\ndistrict  activities,  and  the  district  team  to  supervise  health  centers  monthly,  using  a  supervisory\nchecklist that allows assessment and aggregation of performance of the PHC program and clinical\npractices. Eight provincial  and nine  interdistrict  teams  will  be provided  a four-wheel  drive  pick-up\nvehicle  for  supervision  and  supplies.  Regional  training  teams  will  be  supported  to  ensure\ncontinuing  education  of  tutors.  Village  committees  will  be  provided  basic  orientation  to  increase\ntheir role in health center management, including monitoring the revolving drug fund and ensuring\nthat the very poor receive services. Quality of care will also be monitored through special studies\nsuch as on patient satisfaction and management skills.\n\nSupplies  and  Cost  Recovery.  The  Project  will  provide,  for  all  levels  of  services,\n67.\nadministrative  and  medical  equipment  and \nfurniture,  medical  and  office  supplies,  and\ndemonstration and education materials. For health centers, the Project will provide essential drugs\nand consumables in kits for treatment of 1,000 people, with adequate stock for at least one year. A\ncost  recovery  system  based  on  a  revolving  fund  will  be  established  where  not  already  existing.\nAdditional supplies have been budgeted for subsequent years for poor patients and to compensate\nfor  inflation.  Drug  kits  will  be  resupplied  locally  with  the  support  of  the  central  office  for\nprocurement, logistics, and quality control. The Project will also provide a one-year initial supply of\nessential drugs and consumables for district hospitals.\n\nc.\n\nStrengthening Reproductive Health Services\n\n68.\nThe Project will  collaborate  with  UNFPA  in developing  reproductive  health  services  in  the\neight provinces in the northern area. UNFPA will provide training in reproductive health education,\nantenatal care, the management of normal and complicated delivery, postnatal care, birth spacing,\nand management of reproductive and urinary tract infections. Reproductive health training will also\nbe incorporated in general in-service training of health staff. The health centers to be constructed\nwill  provide  examination  space  for  maternal  check-up,  which  can  also  be  used  for  emergency\ndelivery.  Overnight accommodation  will  be  available  in  the  health  centers  for  those  patients  who\ncannot  return  the  same  day,  or  need  additional  observation,  care,  and  referral.  In  addition  to\nfacility-based  services,  the  Project  will  initially  explore  in  one  province  the  feasibility  of  mobile\nreproductive health services, using the provincial hospital team.\n\nTo support the reproductive health program in the northern area, the Project will purchase\n69.\ncontraceptives and other supplies, where applicable using the UNFPA global procurement system.\nThe  Project  will  also  provide,  on  a  declining  scale,  financial  support  for  the  operational  costs  of\nexpanding reproductive health services in the eight targeted provinces as part of the Government\ncounterpart  contribution,  where  not  available  from  other  sources.  This  includes  field  travel  and\ntraining costs of staff providing MCH and birth spacing services and procurement of vaccines. To\n\n\f17\n\nbuild  up  long-term  capacity  for  health  services  development,  the  Project  will  also  support  four\nregional fellowships for postgraduate training in reproductive health care.\n\nd.  Promoting Village Health Care\n\nThe Government proposes in its PHC policy to promote village health care, in particular to\n70.\nreach small and isolated communities where it is not cost-effective to place health centers. In view\nof the basic needs and dispersion of the population, this is a high priority. Good examples of such\nprograms  exist.  Save  the  Children  Fund  Australia,  AusAid,  GTZ  and  other  agencies  are  training\nVHPs  in  several  provinces.  The  Project  will  explore  whether  the  Government  system  has  the\ncapacity  to  support  VHPs,  and  whether  VHPs  are  willing  to  work  with  the  Government  in  some\nform of public-private partnership. The Project will, based on need and demand, seek  to  improve\nvillage-based  health  education  and  health  care  in  isolated  villages,  in  particular  among  remote\nethnic minorities not having access to regular services. This will include (i) facilitating support and\nmonitoring  of  the  village  committee;  (ii) health,  nutrition,  and  birth  spacing  promotion;  (iii)  basic\nhealth  services  through  VHPs  and  birth  attendants;  and  (iv) other  activities  to  promote  village\nhealth.  Where  possible,  this  will  be  done  in  collaboration  with  NGOs  and  other  Government\nservices  operating  in  these  provinces.  Provincial  and  district  teams  will  be  trained  in  community\ndevelopment, teaching methods, and village health care. The district  team,  with support from  the\nprovincial  team,  will  be  responsible for  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  the  village  health\ncare promotion.\n\n71.\nVillage Committee Support. The district health team will select one or two health centers\neach  year  to be assisted  in  the  development  of  village-based  health  activities.  All  or  a  cluster  of\nvillages will be selected in the catchment area of the health center. Participation of villages will be\non  a  voluntary  basis  depending  on  interest  in  participation  and  staff  constraints.  Priority  will  be\ngiven  to  poor  villages  of  ethnic  minorities  not  having  easy  access  to  health  services.  Following\nidentification and selection of interested villages, the district PHC team will discuss the options with\nthe village committee and health care providers, and make a social contract for a basic package of\nneeds-based health care activities to be made available and sustained at village level. The village\ncommittee will be responsible for overseeing implementation, including identifying health education\npriorities, monitoring drug prices, and ensuring that the very poor receive adequate care at minimal\ncost.\n\n72.\nVHP  Training.  Most  villages  have  at  least  one  health  practitioner,  who  may  be  a  retired\nhealth  worker,  drug  dispenser,  traditional  birth  attendant,  village  health  volunteer,  or  traditional\nhealer. The village committee will seek interested persons among the existing health practitioners\nor other suitable candidates to provide basic health services and health promotion. Additional skills\nsuch as for maternal care may be added after one or two years of satisfactory performance. The\nVHP should preferably be female, married or otherwise settled, and have the ability to learn. The\nVHP  will  have  a  small  income  from  the  sale  of  drugs.  About  1,200  VHPs  will  undergo  phased\ntraining for 1-3 months at the health center level. VHPs will be provided a per diem during training.\nTraining will start in Xieng Khouang and Oudomxai provinces, where a health center network and\ntraining capacity have been established.\n\nDrug  Revolving  Fund.  VHPs  will  provide  standard  care  for  5-10  common  illnesses\u2014\n73.\ndepending on the training of the provider\u2014such as for malaria and respiratory tract infections. The\nProject  will  establish  a  revolving drug fund  by  training  the VHP and providing  an  initial  supply  of\ndrugs. VHPs will be allowed to sell the drugs for a reasonable mark-up and adjustment for inflation.\nThe Government will periodically update guidelines regarding the minimal range of essential drugs\nto  have  in  stock.  The  Government  will  also  provide  guidelines  regarding  prices  of  drugs  but  will\notherwise leave the monitoring of drug prices to the village committee. Proceeds from the sale of\ndrugs will be used to purchase new supplies from approved sources providing quality drugs. The\nvillage health committee will be asked to arrange  community  assistance for families  who  can  not\nafford to pay for drugs.\n\n\f18\n\nVillage  Health  Volunteers.  The  Project  will  also  support  health  education  efforts  to\n74.\nimprove the village environment based on local priorities. About 5,000 volunteers will be identified\nand trained at the health center to promote health on such topics as personal hygiene, clean water\nand sanitation, immunization, nutrition, reproductive health, use of  mosquito  nets,  drug addiction,\nuse of health  services, and  timely  referral.  The Project  will  support  small-scale  water  supply  and\nsanitation if technical support can be obtained and no other funding source is available.\n\n2.\n\nComponent 2: Institutional Capacity Building for PHC\n\n75.\nThe Project  will  strengthen  MOH\u2019s  capacity  to  develop  PHC  in  accordance  with  the  PHC\npolicy. The Project will support MOH to better coordinate PHC delivered through vertical programs;\nprojects funded by external agencies; and services offered at the district hospitals, health centers,\nand  village  levels.  This  will  be  done  by  strengthening  the  national  and  provincial  organizational\nstructures  established  by  MOH.  The  Project  will  support  MOH  to  (i)  develop  PHC  coordination\nstructures, (ii) strengthen PHC management systems, (iii) build capacity through staff development,\nand  (iv)  test  innovative  financing  approaches.  The  Project  will  closely  coordinate  activities  with\nother externally assistance projects in the provinces to ensure complementarity.\n   \n\na.\n\nStrengthening PHC Coordination\n\nThe Project will provide resources to activate the PHC coordination network at the central,\n76.\nprovincial,  and  district  levels.  The  MOH  PHC  policy  mandates  the  PHC  and  Rural  Development\nDivision and 18 provincial PHC coordination units in the provincial health service. The division has\nbeen established in the Cabinet under the supervision of the MOH steering committee. A director\nhas  been  assigned  and  staff  appointments  are  forthcoming.  The  division  is  responsible  for\nplanning,  coordinating,  supervising,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  all  PHC  activities  and  for\ncoordinating  international assistance for  the PHC  program.  The  Project  will  assist  the  start-up  of\nthe  central  PHC  and  Rural  Development  Division  by  providing  support  for  (i)  contracted  staff;\n(ii) facilities,  equipment,  furniture,  and  vehicles;  (iii) meetings  and  workshops;  (iv) supervision  of\nPHC activities in the provinces; (v) a PHC research agenda; and (vi) routine operating costs.\n\n77.\nThe  Government  plans  to  establish  provincial  PHC  coordination  units  in  the  provincial\nhealth offices to better coordinate PHC activities in the provinces. These units will be established\nwithin one year after the commencement of the loan. The Project will assist with the formation and\nactivation of 18 provincial PHC coordination units by providing for (i)  construction or renovation of\nmodest  office  space  in  eight  provinces;  (ii)  office  equipment  and  furniture,  vehicles,  and\ncommunications  equipment;  (iii)  annual  planning  meetings;  and  (iv)  routine  operating  costs.\nFollowing  staff  training,  MOH  will  provide  these  units  with  the  authority  to  effectively  coordinate\nservices, projects, and vertical programs delivered under other organizational entities in MOH.\n\nThe PHC  coordination network  will  also  contain  the project  management  structure for  the\n78.\nProject (Appendix 6). The project management office (PMO) will be located in the PHC and Rural\nDevelopment  Division,  MOH.  The  project  implementation  offices  (PIOs)  will  be  located  in  the\nprovincial health offices in eight provinces under component 1 of the Project. The PMO and PIOs\nwill be provided facilities, equipment, vehicles, and staff to handle PHC program management and\nproject implementation. PMO and PIOs will assist provinces to develop five-year health plans and\nannual plans for the provinces for aggregation at national level. These plans will include all major\nvertical program and project activities of external agencies.\n\nb.\n\nStandardizing PHC Management System\n\n79.\nTo complement the nationwide network for PHC coordination, the Project will assist MOH to\nadapt  standardized  management  systems  that  can  be  used  in  all  PHC  activities  throughout  the\ncountry  regardless  of  the  source  of  funding.  A  multitude  of  management  systems  are  currently\n\n\f19\n\nbeing used by projects, programs, and services, which makes it difficult to develop, coordinate, and\nmonitor PHC. The MOH PHC and Rural Development Division, in collaboration with other divisions\nin MOH, will review and evaluate management systems used in the services, programs, and projects\nfor  relevance,  utility,  and  ease  of  implementation.  These  will  be  developed  into  coherent  system\ndesigns,  standard  operating  procedures,  and  guidelines  that  will  be  tested  and  disseminated\nnationwide in coordination with other divisions and external agencies.\n\n80.\nPriority  will  be  given  to  management  systems  for  (i)  planning  and  budgeting,  (ii)  financial\nmanagement,  (iii)  office  procedures,  (iv)  supervision,  and  (v)  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Improved\nplanning and budgeting helps to identify priorities, rationalize spending, set milestones, and conform\nto  the  Lao  PDR  Government  fiscal  year  that  integrates  plans  and  budgets  from  Government  and\nexternal  assistance.  Cost  recovery  needs  streamlining,  with  clear  guidelines  for  pricing  drugs  and\nservices and for any subsidy. Clear guidelines are needed for office operations such as information\nstorage,  communications,  and  reporting.  Supervision  of  PHC  will  use  simple  checklists  for\nsupervising  PHC  programs  at  all  levels.  The  current  health  information  system  needs  to  be\nstandardized  and  simplified  as  it  is  fragmented,  replicates  information  collection,  and  collects\ninformation  of  limited  use  and  validity.  PHC  will  be  evaluated  using  uniform  indicators  and\nstandardized methodologies so that performance can be evaluated among provinces and projects.\n\n81.\nConsultants for management and monitoring  will  be  hired to  work  with  MOH  personnel  to\ndevelop  the  standardized  systems.  They  will  implement  the  systems  that  will  be  designed  under\nthe proposed advisory TA for  capacity building for  PHC.  Proposed  systems  will  be  reviewed and\nmodified  in  national  workshops  with  participation  from  each  province  and  funding  agencies.  The\nProject will provide follow-up and on-the-job training once staff have received basic training and the\nsystems have been introduced. The Project will also assist MOH\u2019s Human Resources Department\nto (i) disseminate organizational and personnel guidelines that were developed based on analyses\nconducted under the Civil Service Reform Program, and (ii) monitor their implementation.\n\nc.\n\nStaff Development for PHC Management\n\n82.\nThe  Project  will  improve  management  capacity  among  central  and  provincial  PHC  staff\nthrough  a  series  of  in-country  training  programs  and  study  tours;  annual  conferences  on  PHC;\nworkshops, regional, and international study tours and conferences; and overseas fellowships for\ndegree-level training fields related to public health management. The Project will support (i) a PHC\nmanagement course for provincial and district health office staff, (ii) a WHO hospital management\ncourse to train hospital staff in hospital finance and management, and (iii) an accounting and cost\nrecovery course for health center staff. These courses will be offered at the central MOH training\ncenters  (School for  Health Personnel,  School  of  Public  Health,  or  central  tertiary  hospitals)  or  at\nregional training centers or PHC referral facilities (Appendix 5).\n\n83.\nThe  in-country,  regional,  and  international  study  tours  and  conferences  will  expose\nmanagers to innovative management practices in other provinces and countries and allow them to\nexchange experiences. Based on a set of criteria agreed between MOH and ADB, the Project will\nsupport  (i)  11  people  to  obtain  masters  degrees  in  public  health  in  the  region;  and  (ii)  4  with\nfellowships to attend overseas graduate-level programs abroad in public planning and finance, and\nhuman resource development. English language training will also be offered to planning staff.\n\n84.\nA  PHC  conference  will  be  held  once  every  two  years  so  that  provincial  governors  and\nhealth  staff  can  discuss  policy  issues,  and  review  performance  of  all  provinces  using  standard\nindicators  for  supervision  and  evaluation.  These  will  be  held  in  conjunction  with  the  annual\nplanning  meetings.  The  training  courses  to  be  offered  are  PHC  and  hospital  management,  cost\nrecovery guidelines and methods, fellowships, language courses, and local and international study\ntours and conferences.\n\n\fd.\n\nTesting Innovative Financing Approaches\n\n20\n\n85.\nThe  Project  will  test  three  strategies  to  improve  PHC  financing.  The  Project  will  explore\n(i) streamlining cost recovery for hospital services, (ii) a revolving drug fund for health centers and\nat village-level, and (iii) a provincial health care subscription system. Each of these reforms derives\nfrom and is designed to build on the success of  cost  recovery  efforts  in the  public PHC  network.\nWhere  risk pooling  is  introduced,  patients  will  have  the  option  of  either  fee-for-service  or  annual\nprepayment of a subscription fee with a substantial discount on fee-for-service. The options will be\ncarefully evaluated for possible replication nationwide. MOH will actively pursue a change in policy\nto  abolish  the  20  percent  tax  levied  on  user  charges.  at  present  in  all  provinces  with  a  detailed\nprovincial health budget, and where a pilot project for health sector financing is being introduced.\n\n86.\n The Project will streamline cost recovery systems in hospitals. The proposed advisory TA\nwill develop the design for a hospital study funded under the Project to determine the sources and\nuses  of  funds  to  improve  budgeting,  allocation  of  funds,  and  pricing  of  services.  The  study  will\n(i) consider  mechanisms  to  subsidize  services  for  the  poor  and  services  with  externalities;\n(ii) determine  whether  provision  of  reduced  fees  for  the  poor  should  continue  on  the  basis  of  an\ninformal  assessment  and  exemption  system  or  whether  it  should  be  replaced  with  a  more\ntransparent system, involving higher overheads; and (iii) explore the possibilities of paying for staff\nincentives and operational expenses.\n\nTo improve access to drugs in more remote communities, the Project will explore whether a\n87.\nrevolving  drug  fund  can  be  established  at  the  village  level.  VHPs  will  be  provided  with  an  initial\nsupply  of  drugs  for  common  illnesses.  The  VHP  will  be  allowed  a  mark-up  to  pay  for  full\nreplacement  of  used  stock  and  additional  cost  of  service  delivery  and  inflation.  VHPs  will\nperiodically  be  provided  with  guidelines  for  drug  prices.  The  Project  will  also  test  whether\npreventive and promotive services, such as for immunization, can be included in the VHP support\npackage. Different options will be explored to make drugs affordable for the  very  poor.  The  most\npromising  option  is  to  make  an  agreement  with  the  community  organization  to  arrange  for\nassistance for the very poor as a condition for assistance. Other options under consideration are a\npostpayment system, an annual Government supplement for the VHP, and a voucher system.\n\n88.\nBased on a design developed under the proposed advisory TA, the Project will explore the\npossibility of establishing  a  provincial health  care  subscription  system  in  Louang  Phrabang using\nan annual subscription fee to introduce risk pooling against catastrophic illness, promote quality of\ncare  and  preventive  services,  and  increase  health  sector  financing.  Complementary  to  the\ndevelopments in the formal sector, this scheme will test the possibility of people contributing to  a\nprovincial public health fund to obtain services at a discounted rate in the provincial health system.\nFree health cards will be issued to the very poor. Collected fees will be redistributed according to\nuse of services. The study will include the design of accounting and outcome monitor systems.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n89.\nThe total cost of the Project including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and duties\nis estimated at $25 million equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of $10.7 million equivalent\n(43 percent) and local currency cost of $14.3 million equivalent (57 percent).

This  will  cover  the\ntotal  foreign  exchange  cost  and  an  estimated  $9.3  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  (65\npercent of the total local currency cost). The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The Government will finance $5.0 million equivalent of the\nproject  cost.  The  Government  contribution  for  civil  works  and  recurrent  costs  to  sustain  project\nactivities  after  project  completion  will  in  part  be  financed  from  the  eight  provincial  budgets.  The\nGovernment financing includes a community contribution for labor and building materials valued at\n$0.2 million and land valued at $1.3 million for the plots of new health facilities. An annual financing\nplan is in Appendix 7.\n\n\f22\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nADB\nGovernment and\ncommunities\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal Cost\n\nPercent\n\n10.7\n0.0\n\n10.7\n\n9.3\n  5.0\n\n14.3\n\n20.0\n5.0\n\n25.0\n\n80\n20\n\n100\n\n     \n\n      Source: Staff estimates.\n\n91.\nThe provision of financing for local currency cost is considered justified under ADB\u2019s local\ncurrency financing policy.21 Assistance is required to meet the local currency cost of development\nprojects because a low level of per capita income constrains national savings and public finance is\nunder  pressure.  The  Government  is  taking  steps  to  improve  the  rate  of  national  savings  by\nenhancing  revenue  collections,  improving  the  efficiency  of  public  expenditure  and  incentives  for\nprivate sector participation in revenue-generating capital market reforms, and encouraging private\nsector  participation  in  revenue-generating  public  sector  projects.  Although  these  efforts  are\nexpected  to  increase  national  savings,  a  significant  resource  gap  will  continue  for  some  time\nbecause  of  the  need  for  large  capital  investments.  Thus,  ADB  assistance  for  local  currency\nexpenditures related to the Project from an economic perspective is justified.\n\n92.\nFrom a technical perspective, the high level of financing of local currency costs is justified\nfor  a  number  of  reasons.  First,  PHC  services  to  be  provided  under  the  Project  are  of\ndisproportionate benefit to the poor but involve few foreign exchange costs. Second, many of the\ninputs required for  PHC services  are  local,  and  thus the foreign exchange  cost  is  modest.  Third,\nthe  Project  supports  interaction  of  the  Government  with  the  private  sector  at  the  village  level\nthrough  partnerships  with  village  health  providers,  and  the  nature  of  the  support  is  aimed  at\nproviding services at the grassroots level with locally procured goods and services. \n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.  \n\nProject Management\n\n93.\nMOH will be the Executing Agency for the Project (para. 106). The steering committee for\nthe Project will be the MOH Steering Committee for Monitoring International Assistance, composed\nof the Minister, Vice-Ministers, and directors of the departments in MOH, with representation of the\nMinistry  of  Finance,  the  State  Planning  Committee,  and  the  Committee  for  Investment  and\nCooperation.  The  PMO  (para.  78)  will  have  two  project  coordinators,  four  assistant  project\ncoordinators, three accounts assistants, administrative and statistical staff, and support staff.\n\n94.\nEach of the eight provinces will have a provincial health steering committee headed by the\nvice-governor  with  representation  of  the  provincial  health  office,  the  planning  and  budgeting\ndepartment, and beneficiaries. PIOs will be established in the provincial health offices of the eight\nproject  provinces.  The deputy provincial  health officer  or another person of  comparable  authority\nwill  be  the  PIO  head  and  project  coordinator  for  the  province.  The  PIOs  will  have  about  five\nadditional  staff  members,  including  an  accounts  assistant.  The  central  and  provincial  steering\ncommittees  will  provide  policy  support  and  guidance  for  project  implementation  based  on  the\noverall  strategic framework for  PHC  development.  The  committees  will  institutionalize  the  use  of\nfive-year  plans  and  annual  rolling  plans,  conduct  annual  reviews,  and  approve  annual  project\nimplementation plans and budgets.\n\n                                                       \n21 R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects. 3 January 1995.\n\n\f23\n\n95.\nThe  director  of  the  PHC  and  Rural  Development  Division,  who  will  also  be  the  project\ndirector, will assist the provincial health offices to prepare five-year plans and annual rolling plans\nfor  PHC,  and  aggregate  these  to  prepare  the  national  five-year  plan  for  PHC  and  annual  rolling\nplan for approval of MOH. These plans will include the major sources of external financing for the\nvarious  PHC  activities  for  each  province.  The  director  will  also  (i) coordinate  PHC  management\nand services; (ii) coordinate the various PHC projects; (iii) monitor and evaluate PHC development,\nand  (iv)  identify  studies,  policy  development,  and  capacity  building  needed  to  support  PHC\ndevelopment. The project coordinators in the PMO and the provincial PIOs will report to the project\ndirector and will be responsible for project management and implementation.\n\n96.\nThe PMO will be responsible for overall project  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring,\nincluding  procurement  of  equipment  and  civil  works,  recruitment  of  consultants,  disbursement  of\nfunds according to the approved annual implementation plan, reporting, and benefit monitoring and\nevaluation.  PIOs  will  assist  each  provincial  health  office  (and  PHC  coordination  unit  following  its\nestablishment) to plan,  implement, and  monitor  delegated  project  activities  (such  as  training  and\nlocal  procurement).  PIOs  will  prepare  five-year  plans  and  annual  rolling  plans  for  the  Project  as\npart of the five-year provincial health plan.\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nThe Project will be implemented over a period of six years, from the end of 2000 to the end\n\n97.\nof 2006. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement of Goods and Services\n\nAll  procurement  for  the  ADB-financed  portions  of  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with\n98.\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  procurement  under  the\nguidance and supervision of the MOH steering committee. The PMO will set up a procurement unit\nin PMO and will be assisted by procurement consultants. The PMO will (i) propose bid packages\nand  procurement  methods;  (ii)  prepare  detailed  materials  lists  and  specifications;  (iii)  where\napplicable,  determine  prequalification  criteria,  evaluation  criteria,  and  completion  of  delivery\nperiods; and (iv) evaluate bids, determine the lowest evaluated and substantially responsive bids,\nand certify payments. MOH will approve contracts and certify payments. Copies of all contracts and\nsupporting documents will be forwarded to ADB for record and where necessary for approval.\n\na. \n\nCivil Works\n\nThe Project includes construction of small hospitals and health centers, which are in remote\n99.\nand scattered locations and are unlikely to attract international bidders. Civil works contracts will be\nawarded  according  to  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  However,  if  any\npackage is estimated to cost more than $1.0 million, international competitive bidding procedures\nwill  be  followed.  A  domestic  firm  under  supervision  of  an  international  architect  consultant  will\nprepare the plans for civil works. A summary of civil works is in Appendix 9.\n\nb. \n\nEquipment and Materials\n\n100. Under  the  Project,  related  equipment  and  material  will  be  combined  into  packages  to\nsimplify  procurement.  Supply  contracts  costing  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  by\ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Supply contracts of $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will\nfollow international shopping procedures, except for some equipment and supplies such as hostel\nbeds and furniture, which are locally manufactured and unlikely to attract foreign suppliers. These\nwill  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  Government  procedures\nacceptable  to  ADB.  Packages of  less  than  $100,000  may  be  directly  purchased.  Equipment  and\nmaterials  required  at  the provincial  level  and  costing  less  than  $10,000  may  be  procured  by  the\n\n\fPIO  according  to  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  indicative  list  of  equipment,\ndrugs, and supplies to be procured is in Appendix 10.\n\n24\n\nc.\n\nConsulting Services\n\nThe  Project  will  support  about  72  person-months  of  international  and  about  492  person-\n101.\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services.  International  consultants  will  include  a  chief  technical\nadviser  (36  person-months),  an  education  and \ntraining  specialist  (6  person-months),  a\nmanagement specialist (12 person-months), a health sector financing specialist (6 person-months),\na procurement specialist (6 person-months), and an architect (6 person-months), all based in PMO\nin Vientiane.22 Domestic individual consultants will include an education and training specialist (72\nperson-months), a management specialist (72 person-months), a health sector financing specialist\n(72  person-months),  a  procurement  specialist  (72  person-months),  an  accountant  (72  person-\nmonths), and a monitoring and evaluation specialist (72 person-months). A domestic architectural\nfirm  will  be  contracted  for  five  years  for  building  design  and  construction  supervision  of  health\nfacilities. International and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  on  the\nrecruitment of domestic consultants. The terms of reference are in Appendix 11.\n\n4.\n\nAccounts and Auditing\n\nThe  Government,  acting  through  MOH,  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to\n102.\nidentify goods and  services financed from  the  proceeds of the  loan.  The provincial  health offices\nwill  also  maintain  accounts  for  relevant  project  activities  following  the  same  standards.  In\ncoordination  with  other  TA,  the  Government  will  hire  a  local  consultant  to  bring  the  Project\naccounting system up to international accounting standards in the first year.23 MOH will (i) maintain\nseparate accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited in\naccordance  with  international  auditing standards by auditors  acceptable  to ADB;  and  (iii)  provide\nADB,  not  later  than  12  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited\naccounts and financial statements and the report of the auditor on these. In addition to the internal\ncontrol arrangements of the department and annual audits of the Government, ADB may  request\nthe  Government  to  arrange for  an  independent audit, either  local  or  international,  to  be  financed\nfrom loan proceeds.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n103.\nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  will  deposit  an  initial  amount  not  exceeding\n$500,000  into  an  imprest  account  with  the  Bank  of  Lao  under  the  authority  of  the  Ministry  of\nFinance.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook  of  June  1996,  as  amended,  and  with\ndetailed  arrangements agreed  upon by  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  statement  of  expenditure\nprocedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursements  of  eligible  local  and  foreign  expenditures  under  the\nProject  not  exceeding  $100,000  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  accounts  in\naccordance with the same guidelines. Expenditures for contracts larger than $100,000 equivalent\nshould  use  the  direct  payment  and  commitment  letter  procedures  for  withdrawing  loan  funds.\nBecause  project  activities  will  take place  in  dispersed geographic  areas  where  communication  is\ndifficult,  simple  mechanisms  are  required  to  disburse  small  funds  quickly  through  decentralized\ndecision making while maintaining acceptable levels of financial control. Accordingly, subaccounts\nwill be established and managed in the PMO and in the eight provincial PIOs following the same\nguidelines. The initial amount in PMO will not exceed $50,000 and in PIOs will not exceed $10,000.\n\n                                                       \n22 AusAid  is  considering  supporting  reputed  international  NGOs  to  provide  TA  to  facilitate  capacity  building  and\n\ndevelopment of PHC at the provincial level.\n\n23 TA 3309-LAO: Enhancing Government\u2019s Accounting Regulation and Facilities, for $700,000, approved on 25 Nov 99;\nTA 5799: Social Impact Assessment of the Financial Crisis in Selected DMCs for $500,000, approved on 22 July 98.\n\n\f6.\n\nReporting\n\n25\n\n104.\nThe PMO will prepare the Project\u2019s annual plans for ADB\u2019s concurrence. The PMO will also\nprepare quarterly monitoring reports, and submit them to ADB within one month of the end of each\nquarter.  The  reports  will  include  (i)  progress  made  including  aspects  of  quality;  (ii)  delays  and\nproblems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  the  issues;  (iii) compliance  with  loan\ncovenants;  (iv)  proposed program of activities  and  inputs  required  during  the  next  three  months,\nand  (v)  maintenance  and  repairs.  Each  PIO  will  report  to  PMO.  Within  six  months  of  physical\ncompletion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report.  The\nreport will include the costs and compliance with loan covenants.\n\n7.\n\nMidterm Review of the Project\n\nIn  addition  to  regular  reviews,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm\n105.\nreview of the Project after three years of implementation. This will be preceded by an MOH report\ndescribing  the  project  progress  and  issues,  a  midterm  household  survey  in  two  of  the  selected\nprovinces, and group discussions with health  staff  and potential beneficiaries.  These  will  indicate\nthe progress toward quantitative and qualitative targets, and likely project impact and sustainability.\nThe midterm review will appraise the project scope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements,\nand compliance with loan covenants and assurances, and identify any issues to be addressed to\nimprove  project  impact  and  sustainability.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  decide  on  any\nchanges needed in the design and implementation of the Project.\n\nF.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n106. MOH  has  gained experience  with project  implementation  in  the  first  ADB  loan  to  the  Lao\nPDR health sector, which will be completed on schedule and has generally achieved its objectives.\nThe Ministry of Finance will delegate the necessary financial authority to MOH in view of the strong\nperformance of MOH as an executing agency. To address procurement constraints, a procurement\nunit will be established in MOH. As with other projects in the Lao PDR, successful implementation\nwill  depend  on  the  timely  availability  and  quality  of  project  staff,  and  MOH  will  ensure  that\ncompetent  administrative  and  technical  project  staff  are  available  for  the  Project  during\nimplementation. ADB will assist in capacity building for PHC through a proposed advisory TA. The\nProject  itself  provides  for  substantial  international  and  domestic  consulting  services  to  assist  in\nProject implementation.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n107.\nThe Project will have minimal adverse environmental impacts. The Project will support the\nremoval  and  disposal  of  asbestos  roofing  material  from  Louang  Phrabang  hospital  according  to\nWHO standards. The Government will ensure that proper waste disposal is included in the design\nof  health  facilities.  Refuse  handling  and  disposal  measures  for  hazardous  medical  waste,  e.g.,\nsyringes  and  needles,  will  be  specifically  addressed  in  the  design  and  operation  of  the  health\nfacilities. The Project will provide training and guidelines for provincial and district health office staff\nto ensure proper medical waste management in all health facilities under their responsibility.\n\n2.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n108.\nThe  Project  does  not  envisage  land  acquisition  or  relocation  of  households,  as  all\nconstruction  is  expected  to  be  on  Government  land.  Land  for  hospital  construction  is  already\navailable,  and  very  little  land  is  required  for  new  health  centers,  which  need  about  0.25  hectare\neach. Any negative  impacts  such as  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided  or  minimized  in  the\nProject.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  no  health  centers  to  be  constructed  under  this\n\n\f26\n\nProject will involve resettlement of any people. Before any construction is started, the Government\nwill confirm that the plot for construction is Government property and not under lease or otherwise\nin  private  use.  However,  if  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable  and  involves  minor  land\nacquisition,  relocation,  or  loss  of  other  assets  (e.g.,  crops),  appropriate  compensation  will  be\nnegotiated with representation of the affected persons, in accordance with the Government\u2019s and\nADB\u2019s policies, and will be implemented accordingly. If a health center needs to be relocated, the\nsame assurance  will  apply.  A  short  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  plan  has  been  prepared  in\ncase of involuntary resettlement under the Project.\n\n3.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\na.\n\nPoverty\n\n109. Based  on  the  ADB  analysis  of  the  1997-98  Lao  Expenditure  and  Consumption  Survey,\nabout  47  percent  of  the  population  are  poor  and  25  percent  are  very  poor;  in  the  northern\nprovinces about 62 percent are poor and 38 percent are very poor. The very poor are those with a\nlower  consumption  equivalent  than  the  cost  of  a  basic  food  package.  In  particular,  this  includes\nsingle  parents,  parents  with  many  young  children,  and  families  with  chronically  ill  or  disabled\npersons and drug addicts. For poor families, any loss of labor leads systematically to the reduction\nof the family\u2019s production capacity and, consequently, food shortage and impoverishment. The very\npoor  are  not  primarily  determined  by  location  and  ethnic  group,  but  by  the  socioeconomic\nconditions of the household. Thus, very poor families may be found in any village and this must be\ntaken into account in planning and financing health care.\n\n110.\nThe Project will directly address poverty by (i) operating in areas mainly populated by poor\nethnic minorities; (ii) focusing on the provision of basic services at the village level where the poor\nare  more  likely  to  capture  the  benefits  of  Government  subsidies;  (iii)  selectively  investing  in\nservices  that  directly  support  PHC;  (iv) addressing  diseases  such  as  diarrhea,  micronutrient\ndeficiencies,  and  malaria,  which  disproportionately  affect  the  poor;  and  (v) identifying,  setting\ntargets,  and  monitoring  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on  the  very  poor  through  village  committees  and\nsurveys. It is expected that 75 percent of the project beneficiaries will be poor or very poor.\n\n111.\nThe Project will also seek to increase equity by (i) making cost recovery more transparent,\nefficient  and  equitable  in  hospitals,  (ii)  introducing  a  revolving  drug  fund  at  village  level  with\narrangements to make health care affordable for the poor, (iii)  testing  risk pooling  through  a pilot\nprepayment  system,  (iv)  retaining  revenue  from  cost  recovery  for  improving  the  affordability,\nefficiency and quality of services, (v) increasing the role of communities in assisting the very poor,\nand (vi) targeting a larger share of Government resources for services to benefit the poor.\n\nb.\n\nEthnic Minorities\n\n112. Ethnic minorities constitute about 34 percent of the population overall and 60 percent of the\npopulation in the  northern  provinces.  The first  component of the  Project,  because  of  its focus  on\naccess, will mainly be targeting ethnic minorities. The Project will locate facilities near underserved\nethnic minorities, provide scholarships for training of auxiliary nurses or equivalent staff belonging\nto ethnic  minorities, post at  least  one person  speaking the  local  language  in  each  health  facility,\nand increase outreach services and support VHPs in remote ethnic  minority villages. Studies  are\nbeing conducted to determine if there are specific cultural perceptions regarding health and health\nservices that inhibit adequate levels of health care among minorities.24 Affordability problems exist\nin  most  ethnic  communities,  although  the  coping  mechanisms  vary.  To  overcome  the  cash  flow\nproblem for medical care, a postpayment system is being tested by a GTZ-supported project and\nmay become available for replication. However, informal postpayment systems already exist, and\n\n                                                       \n24 TA 5794-REG: Study of Health and Education Needs of Ethnic Minorities in the Greater Mekong Region, for $800,000,\n\napproved on 30 Jun 98.\n\n\f27\n\ncould be facilitated by providing subsidized drugs. Adequate stocks of drugs should be provided to\nremote ethnic communities before the rainy season, when access deteriorates. Each province will\nidentify priorities for ethnic minorities and incorporate these in the provincial project implementation\nplan. The social analysis and ethnic minorities strategy are in Appendix 12.\n\nc. \n\nGender\n\n113.\nThe TA identified major issues concerning women\u2019s health knowledge, immunization, use of\nservices,  health  behavior,  and  literacy  rates.  The  Project  will  address  women\u2019s  health  through\nspecific  targeted  services  such  as  prenatal  care,  obstetrical  care,  birth  spacing,  and  treatment  of\nobstetrical complications and reproductive tract infections. Family health improvements resulting from\nthe Project are  expected  to  benefit  women  by  reducing  the  time  spent  caring  for  family  members.\nAlso,  the  Project  will  endeavor  to  select  women  as  VHPs,  volunteers,  and  trainees  to  become  a\nhealth staff. Very few women from some ethnic minorities have basic education, and scholarships will\nbe available to provide them with additional basic education before technical training. Health centers\nhave  been  designed  to  provide  privacy  for  women  during  examination  and  treatment,  and  gender\nissues will be incorporated in the training courses. Women\u2019s use of health services will be monitored\nwith specific indicators. The project management will also seek to appoint female staff.\n\nd.\n\nStakeholder Participation\n\n114. Stakeholders were extensively consulted and involved during the preparation of the Project.\nResults of group discussions with  beneficiaries  in  catchment areas  of  the first  ADB  health  sector\nloan in the Lao PDR were used in  the project  design.  This  information  was  supplemented  with  a\nhousehold  survey  in  11  provinces,  which  provided  data  on  health  service  availability,  health\nseeking  behaviors,  and  financing  of  health  events.  Major  PHC  projects  in  the  country  were\nreviewed  in  detail  and  discussions  were  held  with  external  funding  agency  representatives\nconcerning project  management  issues,  supervision,  project  evaluation, and  lessons  learned.  An\nMOH  team  visited  the  provinces  where  the  Project  will  be  implemented,  consulted  with  local\nofficials, and conducted a detailed needs assessment. Finally, MOH provided substantial guidance\nfor the project design through the MOH steering committee and otherwise.\n\n115. During implementation of the Project, the beneficiaries will participate in four ways: (i) in the\nselection of sites and the construction of health centers; (ii) in identifying and following up priorities\nfor  village health  care  and promotion;  (iii)  in  selecting  and  monitoring  VHPs  and  volunteers;  and\n(iv) in  making  arrangements  for  health  care  for  the  very  poor.  Project  evaluation  will  obtain  the\nviews of beneficiaries through focus group discussions and surveys.\n\ne.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n116. Benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  will  play  an  important  role  in  the  success  of  the\nProject by helping it to remain focused on achievable goals and monitor progress. In keeping with\nADB\u2019s Handbook on BME, the Project has (i) collected benchmarks, (ii) planned additional studies\nfor analysis and to obtain beneficiary perceptions, (iii) selected a short list of verifiable indicators for\nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (iv) planned  surveys  for  impact  assessment.  A  summary  is  in\nAppendix 13.\n\n117. A  set  of  indicators  has  been  selected  to  evaluate  achievements  of  the  Project.  Those\nindicators will be collected through health facility surveys, village surveys, and households surveys\ncarried  out  on  a  scale  large  enough  to  allow  provincial  comparison.  The  household  surveys  will\ninclude two nonproject provinces for comparison. Key indicators will be disaggregated by a wealth\nindex to determine whether project benefits are reaching the poor. The chief technical adviser and\na domestic monitoring and evaluation consultant will supervise project evaluation. Data  collection\n\n\f28\n\nwill be carried out by the implementing agency, and analysis and reporting will be the responsibility\nof the consultants.\n\n118. Routine monitoring and supervision will use a standardized health information system that\nwill  be  developed  under  the Project for  use  in  all PHC  projects  in  the  Lao PDR.  The  information\nsystem  will  track  project  inputs  and  service  processes  and  outputs,  aggregated  by  district.  The\nsupervision system will track performance and quality of service at all levels using a standardized\nchecklist of indicators. Client satisfaction will be monitored through surveys, supervision visits, and\ngroup  discussions.  The  PMO  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  data  collection,  analysis,  and\nreporting to all interested parties, including ADB.\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\n119.\nThe economic rationale for public intervention in PHC service is strong: public intervention\nprovides  substantial  externalities,  compensates  for  market  failure  by  informational  imperfection,\nallows risk pooling, and provides a safety net for the poor. Many studies, including a  1993 World\nBank  study25,  confirm  a  significant  positive  relationship  between  health  status  and  economic\nproductivity. Improvements in the health status of the poor will increase their incomes by improving\nthe  productivity  of  workers,  reducing  the  occurrence  of  catastrophic  illnesses  that  leave  them\ndestitute,  and  allowing  children  to  learn  more  and  thereby  enjoy  higher  productivity  and  future\nearnings.\n\n120.\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  significantly  to  poverty  reduction.  The  targeted\nprovinces have the high poverty incidence of 62 percent compared with the national average of 47\npercent,  and  ethnic  minorities  comprise  60  percent  of  the  population  in  these  provinces.\nFurthermore, the Project is likely to benefit the poor more than this number indicates, because the\npoor  are  more  prone  to  common  communicable  diseases  and  use  services  as  much  as  others.\nWhile the Project will service all segments of the population in the project provinces, the poor are\nexpected to receive a high proportion of the benefits by reducing their cost for health services and\nbenefiting most from these services. Within the targeted populations, the Project will mostly benefit\nwomen  and  children,  who  suffer  most  from  disease  and  malnutrition.  The  Project  will  focus  on\nservices that benefit women and children, in particular reproductive health services including birth\nspacing.  Reproductive  health  services  help  to  improve  survival  of  mothers  and  children;  reduce\npoverty; and improve nutrition, learning capacity, and educational opportunities for children.\n\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  efficiency  of  PHC  service  delivery  in  rural  areas  of  the  Lao\n121.\nPDR by (i) rationalizing the spatial distribution of staff and physical facilities, (ii)  providing services\nthat  are  either  public  goods  or  have  large  positive  externalities,  (iii)  enabling  partnership  at  the\ngrassroots  level  with  VHPs,  and  (iv)  focusing  resources  on  expansion  of  the  PHC  network  to\ninclude cost-effective interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality. Cost-effectiveness analysis\nindicates that the cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) 26 saved is $21 following a favorable\nscenario, and $48 following an unfavorable scenario. This is well within the range of $75 per DALY\nsaved for  priority  interventions  listed  in  ADB\u2019s Policy for the Health Sector.  See  Appendix  14  for\ndetails.\n\n122. Expanding access and introducing new facilities and services under the Project raises the\nissue of whether these developments  can be financially  sustained  after  the  Project  is completed.\nUpon completion of the physical investments, the average annual recurrent expenditure needed to\nsustain  the  Project  activities  is  estimated  at  $245,500,  to  (i)  maintain  buildings,  equipment,  and\n\n                                                       \n25 World Bank. Lao PDR Social Development Assessment Strategy, Report No. 13992-LA. 1995. Washington DC.\n26\n\nThe  DALY  is  a  composite  index  of  the  years  of  healthy  life  lost  due  to  morbidity,  mortality  and  disability,  and  the\nbenefits that can be achieved by saving lost years.\n\n\f29\n\nvehicles;  and  (ii)  supervise  health  care  workers  at  rural  health  units  and  VHPs.  This  amount  is\nestimated  to  be  about  8  percent  of  the  annual  Government  recurrent  expenditure  on  the  health\nsector. Given the overall significance of externally assisted projects in health sector investments in\nthe  Lao  PDR,  the  overall  prospect  for  sustainability  is  favorable.  Also  MOH  has  committed  to\nallocate  more  budget  to  promotive  and  preventive  services,  although  the  risk  of  macroeconomic\ninstability  will  be  beyond  the  control  of  MOH.  The  provincial  governments  have  agreed  to\ncontribute financially to the Project, in particular for civil works construction and maintenance, and\nrecurrent  costs  of  MCH  services.  Because  some  provinces  will  have  difficulty  generating  the\nrequired  financial  inflows  through  cost  recovery  efforts,  the  central  MOH  will  have  to  reallocate\nbudgetary resources among the provinces.\n\n123.\nThe Project employs specific mechanisms to increase financial sustainability: (i) increased\nrevenue  from  cost  recovery  from  those  who  can  afford  to  pay  for  the  services,  through  more\naccurate pricing of services based on total costs of goods and service provision; (ii) increased cost\nrecovery from more accurate replacement cost pricing to keep up with inflation for drugs and other\nmedical  consumables;  (iii)  partnerships  with  VHPs  for  revolving  funds  with  full  replacement  cost\npricing for those who can afford the payment; (iv) increased cost recovery revenue from the pricing\nof hospital services that currently  are  not  routinely  charged to patients;  (v)  increased  retention  of\ncost  recovery  revenue  by  exempting  the  public  health  sector  revenue  from  taxes;  (vi)  increased\nrevenue from a provincial subscription system; and (vii) Government assurances that public health\nsubsidies will not decrease in real terms in the future.\n\nB.\n\nEnvironment\n\n124.\nThe Project will have a beneficial environmental impact through its contribution to reducing\nrural population growth by reducing the number of people depending on slash-and-burn cultivation\nand exploitation of the forest. Health education on sanitation and waste disposal is also expected\nto  improve  living  conditions,  reduce  pests,  and  contain  the  spread  of  common  diseases  such  as\nmalaria.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Dimensions and Poverty Impact\n\n125. Over 85 percent of the Lao PDR  population  resides  in  the  rural  areas,  with 90  percent of\nincome-earning adults depending on agriculture for their livelihood. According to the social analysis\ndone  during  the  TA,  most  families  in  the  villages  in  the  project  provinces  in  the  north  are  poor\nsubsistence farmers, who live below or near the poverty line. They depend on subsistence farming\nfor  their  survival,  which  in  turn depends  heavily on the availability  of  a  healthy  labor  force  in  the\nfamily. Any serious disease or death in the family may throw the family into deep poverty. Half of\nwomen  in  the  project  provinces  in  the  north  could  not  read  and  that  there  are  periodic  food\nshortages.  Access  to  basic  amenities  is  low  in  the  Lao  PDR,  with  only  49  percent  of  the  rural\npopulation having access to clean water, 32 percent having access to latrines, and 28 percent of\nhouseholds have electricity for lighting (footnote 9).\n\n126.\nThe TA household survey found that the average total monthly household  expenditure for\nhealth care is about KN33,000, or about KN400,000 per year. On an annual per capita basis, this\namount represents about $7.50 per person per year, or 2.5 percent of the total annual per capita\nexpenditures,  which  suggests  that  health  care  is  affordable  for  most  families  if  there  are  no\ncatastrophic illnesses in the family. Improved health and better access to PHC services will reduce\nthese  direct  expenditures  on  health  care,  decrease  the  indirect  costs  associated  with  seeking\nhealth  care,  decrease  workdays  lost  due  to  disease,  and  increase  productivity.  Savings  in\nhousehold expenditures will help reduce food shortages and impoverishment.\n\n127.\nThe Project will improve primary care of about 0.9 million people in 34 districts and improve\nreferral services for 1.7 million people living in the eight  northern provinces by helping  to  provide\nPHC consisting of proven high impact, cost-effective services. The interventions will benefit mostly\n\n\f30\n\nthe poor, women, children, and ethnic minorities by easing their large burdens of disease. Based\non the  DALY  lost due  to  mortality,  morbidity, and disability,  the Project  will  reduce  more  than  30\npercent of the burden  of  disease  for  women  and  children.  For  example,  the  Project  will  address\n(i) maternal  emergency  conditions  such  as  hemorrhage,  sepsis,  and  obstructed  labor;  and\n(ii) facilitate immunizations for childhood diseases and  treatment of  malaria and acute  respiratory\ninfections, and thereby have a significant impact on MCH status. The Project will protect children\nduring  a  vulnerable  time  in  their  lives,  thus  improving  their  intellectual  and  psychomotor\ndevelopment and consequently increasing the returns to investments in education. In addition, the\nProject will address problems that affect the health status of all members of the population, such as\ndiarrhea, respiratory infections, malaria, and sexually transmitted diseases. Improved health status\nof the adult working population from these interventions will lead to increased productivity.\n\nD.\n\nInstitutional Sustainability\n\n128. Many agencies and NGOs are conducting a wide variety of PHC activities at every level of\nthe  network.  The  Project  will  build  capacity  at  the  central,  provincial,  and  district  levels  to  plan,\ncoordinate and monitor PHC activities. The Project will also support planning for further expansion\nof  the  PHC  network,  in  accordance  with  the  PHC  policy  guidelines,  strategic  framework,  and\ninvestment  to  be  developed  with  the  help  of  the  proposed  advisory  TA  for  Capacity  Building  for\nPHC.\n\nThe  Project  will  train  managerial  staff  in  financial  management,  procurement,  and\n129.\ninternational accounting standards; help set up a PHC coordination unit in each province to focus\non key issues such as planning and budgeting, in-service training, and supervision and integration\nof PHC services; and standardize management procedures and systems to improve efficiency and\ncoordination  of  the  PHC  network  at  all  levels.  The  assistance  to  PHC  coordination  includes\n(i) office  renovation  and  equipment,  information  systems,  and  vehicles  for  supervision  of  PHC\nactivities;  (ii) standardization  and  implementation  of  PHC  management  information  systems\nincluding health information and cost  recovery  reporting  systems;  (iii)  PHC  management training;\nand  (iv)  testing  of  innovative  approaches  to  PHC  financing.  Through  these  activities,  the  Project\nwill improve PHC coordination and management, and enhance sustainability of the Government\u2019s\nactivities in the PHC sector.\n\nE.\n\nRisks\n\n130.\nbenefits.\n\nFour Project-related risks could affect implementation of the Project and sustainability of its\n\n131.\nFinancial  Management.  The  first  PHC  project  was  affected  by  inadequate  delegation  of\nfinancial management authority, but succeeded in streamlining financial management procedures.\nMOH will be given increased financial management authority, including management of the project\nimprest account.\n\n132. Procurement Capacity. The capacity for procurement procedures of goods and services in\nMOH  is  still  weak.  The Project  will  set  up a  procurement  unit and  will  have  consultants  to  assist\nwith  procurement.  The  Project  will  also  assist  MOH  to  improve  general  procurement  capacity  in\nMOH.\n\n133. Staff  for  Health  Centers.  While  there  is  excess  health  staff,  they  are  underpaid  and\ngenerally not willing to be relocated to places where they can not generate additional income. The\nGovernment  has  agreed  to  provide  incentives  for  staff  to  be  relocated,  and  is  considering  a\nproposal for a hardship  allowance  to be paid  to  staff posted  in  remote  locations.  In  addition,  the\nGovernment has agreed to increase training of persons from ethnic minorities to work within their\ncommunities.\n\n\f31\n\n134.\nFinancial Constraints. The Government is in a tight fiscal situation, although its long-term\neconomic prospects are good. This may affect counterpart funding and financial sustainability. The\nproposed expansion of the network of health facilities has been rationalized in view of the recurrent\ncost  implications.  A  financial  plan  has  been  prepared  examining  counterpart  fund  requirements\nincluding  the  provincial  contributions,  and  recurrent  cost  requirements  in  comparison  to  public\nhealth sector expenditures after project completion.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard assurances\n\n135.\nthat will be incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  have  established  provincial  PHC  coordination  units  or  have\nmade other arrangements to ensure strong provincial PHC coordination within one\nyear of the effective date of the loan.\n\nThe  targeted  provinces  will  prepare  annual  operational  plans  for  the  provincial\nhealth sector, including budgets identifying sources and uses of funds.\n\nThe Government will ensure that the health budget for the targeted provinces will be\nmaintained at the level of fiscal year  2000 or  increased  in  real  terms,  and that  the\nprovincial health sector budgets will allocate sufficient funds for the recurrent costs\nresulting from the Project, in particular for MCH and birth spacing services.\n\n(iv)  Within two years of the loan effectiveness date, the Government will issue new cost\n\nrecovery guidelines that make provision of services affordable for the very poor.\n\n(v) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  counterpart  funds,  including  from  the  provinces,\nare  available  in  time  and  according  to  the  estimates  agreed  upon  with  the  MOH\nsteering committee each year as per the project implementation plan.\n\n(vi)  Within  six  months  of  the  effective  date  of  the  loan,  MOH  will  have  established  a\nproject  procurement  unit  and  developed  guidelines  to  streamline  procurement\nprocedures and guarantee timely arrival  of  goods  and  services  in  accordance  with\nthe project implementation plan.\n\n(vii) \n\nThe targeted provinces will prepare a comprehensive plan for all new and renovated\nhealth  facilities  including  a  maintenance  plan  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the\nconstruction,  and  ensure  that  this  plan  is  implemented  during  and  after  project\nimplementation.\n\n(viii)  The  provinces  will  ensure  that  any  unavoidable  involuntary  resettlement  and  land\nacquisition  by  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB  policies  and\nguidelines.\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nThe Government will ensure that proper waste disposal is included in the design of\nhealth  facilities.  Refuse  handling  and  disposal  measures  for  hazardous  medical\nwaste such as syringes and needles will be specifically addressed in the design and\noperation of health facilities.\n\nThe  provinces  will  ensure  that  for  all  new  health  facilities  to  be  constructed,  a\nstaffing  plan  is available  and  approved  prior  to  commencement  of  construction.  In\nparticular,  they  will  ensure  that  construction  of  health  centers  to  serve  ethnic\nminorities  will  not  start  before  a  person  from  the  local  ethnic  minority  has  been\nidentified as a proposed staff member for the facility, and has started training.\n\n\f32\n\n(xi)  Within one year of the loan effectiveness date, the Government will have identified\ncandidate  trainees,  particularly  from  ethnic  minorities,  to  participate  in  the  training\nprogram  that  will  impart  skills  equivalent  to  those  of  auxiliary  nurses.  Within  two\nyears of the loan effectiveness date, training will have started in each of the project\nprovinces and the Government will have developed a staffing plan that will include\nthe  placement of  trainees,  especially  of  ethnic  minorities  who  have  completed  the\ntraining program.\n\n(xii) \n\nADB may request the Government to arrange for an independent audit, either local\nor international, to be financed from loan proceeds.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n136.\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB and\nrecommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing\nRights 14,956,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Primary Health Care Expansion\nProject, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge at\nthe rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and\nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance  with those set forth  in the draft\nLoan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n31 July 2000\n\nTADAO

The\n1995  census  categorizes  the  population  into  47  different  ethnic  groups,  classified  in  four\nlinguistic groups. These are the Tai-Kadai including the Lao, Phutai, and Leu (66.2 percent); the\nAustro-Asiatic  group  of  Mon-Kmer  and  Viet-Muang  (23.0  percent);  the  Hmong-Yao  (7.4\npercent); and the  Tibeto-Burman  and  Hor  Han  (2.7).  All  those  not  belonging  to  the  Tai-Kadai\nlanguage group are considered as ethnic minorities. They comprise about 60 percent of the total\npopulation  of  1.7  million  in  the  eight  targeted  provinces,  as  shown  in  Table  A12.1.  Vientiane\nProvince is added for comparison.\n\nProvince\n\nPhongsali\n\nLouang Namtha\n\nOudomxai\nBokeo\n\nLouang Phrabang\n\nHouaphan\n\nProportion\nEthnic\nMinorities\n   81,5\n\nTable A12.1: Ethnic Groups by Province\n\nProportion of Ethnic Groups in Province\n\nLao 4,3; Phutai 5,3; Leu 8,9; Kor 20; Phounoy 19,4;\nKmu 24,4; Yao 3,3; Ho 4,7 Others 9,7\nLeu 15,8; Phutai 12,6; Lao 2,3; Kmu 24,7; Kor 24; Yao\n3,3; Hmong 4,4; Others 12,9\nKmu 58; Hmong 13.1; Leu 12.2; Others 16.7\nKmu 23,8; Leu 20.6; Nhuan 4,6; Lao 13.4; Hmong\n10,1; Lamet 10,8, Mousseu 6,2 Others 23,9\nKmu 45.9; Lao 28.6; Phutai 4,8; Leu 3,1 Hmong 15.2,\nOthers 2,4\nPhutai 31.5, Lao 30, Hmong 20.3, Kmu 10,6 Others\n7,6\nLao 44.3, Hmong 34.2, Phutai 10.2; Others 11.3\nLeu 26.9, Kmu 20; Lao 19, Others 34.1\nLao 63,8; Phutai 14; Hmong 7,6; Kmu 12,5; Others 2,1\n\n   69,3\n\n   83.5\n   42,2\n\n   63,5\n\n   38,5\n\n   45,5\n   54,1\n   22,2\n\nXieng Khouang\nSayaburi\nVientiane Province\nSource: National Census. 1995.\n\nB.\n\nProfile of Ethnic Groups\n\n2.\nThe National Statistic Census 1995 indicates that the Tai-Kadai group is better off than\nthe  other  language  groups.  The  Mon-Kmer  are  considered  poor,  and  the  Tibeto-Burman\npopulation very poor. However, dividing populations by ethnic group and place of living masks\nthe large variety of cultures and social organizations within  these  groups. Several  clans,  while\nliving  in  remote  mountains,  are  well  organized,  opportunistic,  and  better  off.  Table  A12.2\nprovides a generalized profile of the four ethnic groups.\n\n3.\nThe Tai-Kadai is the leading group and mostly live in the south and center plains of the\nMekong  River  and  its  contributors.  In  addition  to  having  rainfed  terraces  provide  a  staple  rice\nsupply,  they  engage  in  cash  crops  production,  raising  animals,  weaving,  basket  making,  and\nsewing.  They also dominate  the  civil  service  and  the  commercial  sector  and  make  up  a  large\npart of the urban population. Migrants from surrounding countries tend to settle in urban areas\nto engage in commercial and skilled labor activities.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nThe Mon-Khmer represent the traditional inhabitants of the Lao PDR. They usually  live\n4.\non  the  slopes  of  mountains,  in  forests  and  valleys.  They  have  a  more  traditional  lifestyle  of\nshifting  cultivation,  hunting,  and  collecting  forest  products  for  their  own  consumption.  If  food\nbecomes inadequate or cash is required, they will work as casual laborer for the Lao in the rice\nfields. The shifting cultivation they practice allows for the forest to regenerate, and usually does\nnot require resettlement. However, resettlement may follow an outbreak of malaria or diarrhea.\nMost Mon-Kmer are animists and the forests play an important role in their spiritual world.\n\nTable A12.2: Socioeconomic Profile of Ethnic Minorities in the Lao PDR\nCultural\nCharacteristic\n\nEconomic Activities and\nStatus\n\nLiteracy\nRate\n\nGroups\n\nTai-Kadai\n\nHmong-\nYao\n\nMain Location\nand Access\nLowland: plains\nof  Mekong\nRiver and\ncontributors and\nmain roads\nUpland:\nOn top of hills;\nsometimes with\nroad access\n\nMon-Kmer Midland: in\nforests and\nvalleys and\nalong smaller\nrivers; poor\naccess\n\nTibeto-\nBurman\n\nUpland: most in\nforests, some\nnear towns\nMixed\n\nMostly settled farmers\nwith rice and cash crops,\ncommercial and off farm\nactivities.\nGenerally less poor.\nMost practice migrant\nshifting cultivation, partly\nwith cash crops including\npoppy, forest exploitation,\noverseas remittances.\nPoor and nonpoor.\nMostly settled shifting\ncultivation farmers\nproducing dry rice and\noccasional cash crop with\nsupplementary food from\nhunting, fishing, gathering\nand cash from farm labor.\nGenerally poor.\nSubsistence farmers\nforest exploitation and\nhawkers.

They are\n5.\na relatively better off group. They engage in agricultural and off farm activities, and produce dry\nrice,  maize, ginger, poppy,  pigs, and  clothes.  The  Hmong  usually  practice  an  environmentally\nharmful shifting  cultivation  that  forces  them  to  move  to  a  new  location.  Many  Hmong  families\nreceive  overseas  remittances  from  relatives  who  migrated  to  the  United  States.  The\nGovernment is trying to resettle Hmong villages by building social services in new locations.\n\nThe Tibeto-Burman groups, most of whom also live at higher altitude, are considered the\n6.\npoorest.  In  addition  to  slash  and  burn  cultivation,  hunting  and  collection  of  forest  products,\npoverty has increasingly driven them out of isolation and into the marginal commercial activities\nof towns such as selling firewood. They are few in number and many of these ethnic groups are\nlikely to disappear within the next decades.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nC.\n\nDistribution of Poverty\n\n7.\nIn  a  1995  study,  the Word  Bank estimated  that  46  percent of  the Lao  PDR  population\nlives below the poverty line of $14 per month, and 27 percent lives below a second poverty line\nand  can  be  classified  as  very  poor.  The  study  suggests  that  poverty  in  the  northern  area  is\nslightly less than in the south, but recent developments suggest that the south is  more  rapidly\ndeveloping than the north. The environment of the population determines to a large extent their\nliving conditions, agricultural productivity, access to services, and  development  potential.  Most\nof the ethnic minorities are located in poorly accessible areas and have less access to services,\nas reflected in their education and health status.\n\n8.\nHowever, an analysis of a household survey by level of poverty, defined as rice shortage\nduring the last year, indicated that poverty is not confined to remote villages or villages of ethnic\nminorities.  This  confirms  village  studies  suggesting  that  every  village,  whether  remote  or\naccessible,  has  poor  households,  and  that  poverty  is  linked  to  social  conditions  (addiction,\nsingle  parent,  age  profile,  relatives  overseas)  and  land  and  labor  availability  in  the  individual\nhouseholds. Each  village  is  likely  to  have  some  households  that  cannot  produce  enough  and\nare trapped in poverty and lack of food.  An effort to reach the very poor would therefore need to\ntarget individual households, in addition to some specific and small ethnic minorities.\n\nD.\n\nHealth Needs\n\n9.\nAccording to the national statistic census of 1995, the infant mortality rate is 104 deaths\nper 1,000 live births. The north has the highest infant, child, and  maternal  mortality  rates; and\nthe lowest life expectancy rate. For example, Louang Phrabang province with a 45 percent Mon-\nKmer people, has an infant mortality rate of 132 infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared to\n72  for  Vientiane  Municipality.  Table  A12.3  illustrates  the  major  differences  in  infant  and  child\nmortality  among  different  socioeconomic  groups.  It  suggests  major  differences  in  child  health\nstatus between income, education, and ethnic groups.\n\n10.\nThe  maternal  mortality  ratio  in  Louang  Namtha  was  1,595  per  100,000  live  births  in\n1995,  implying  that  the  lifetime  risk  of  a  woman  dying  of  complications  of  pregnancy  and\nchildbirth is one in 10. About three fourths of deaths occur within six weeks of delivery, and one\nfourth during pregnancy. Emergency care is often delayed for people living in the hills, as they\nhave poor access to referral services, in particular during the rainy season. The importance of\ncultural and financial factors affecting referral is not clear. While birth spacing is practiced by 23\npercent of couples, there is a high demand for birth spacing services.\n\n11.\nMalaria,  diarrheal  diseases,  and  acute  respiratory  infections  are  the  major  causes  of\nmortality  and  morbidity  in  the  Lao  PDR.  Epidemiological  variations  are  associated  with  the\naltitude at  which  people  live,  with  diarrheal  diseases  being  more  common  in the  lowland,  and\nrespiratory infections in the highlands, in particular among the Hmong-Mien and Tibeto-Burman\ngroups.  Malaria  causes  high  mortality  among  children  and  pregnant  women  in  all  rural\npopulations. About one third of Lao households experience insufficient food intake. According to\na  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  survey,  41  percent  of  children  are  undernourished,  and  12\npercent are severely  malnourished.  The  risk  of  malnutrition peaks at  18-23  months.  About  20\npercent  of  infants  are  born  malnourished.  Iodine  deficiency  is  widespread  in  the  Lao  PDR,\naffecting 65 percent of the population, in particular isolated ethnic minorities without access  to\niodized salt. Malnutrition is particularly prominent among the Kor and Kmu people.\n\n\fTable A12.3: Infant and Child Mortality Rate by Socioeconomic Categories\n\nInfant Mortality Rate per\n1,000 live births\n\nChild Mortality Rate per\n1,000 live births\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\n60\n\n115\n147\n\n78\n136\n\n82\n148\n\n147\n70\n\n161\n230\n\n102\n200\n\n108\n250\n\n207\n85\n\nCategory\n\nEthnic group:\n      Tai-Kadai\n      Ethnic Minorities\nPlace of residence:\n      Urban\n      Rural\nFamily Income\n      Well-to-do\n      Poor\nMother\u2019s education\n      No education\n      More than primary\neducation\n\nOccupation\n      Agriculture\n      Other occupation\nSource: Fertility and Birth Spacing Survey Lao PDR. 1993.

Table  A12.4  suggests  that  the  incidence  of  illness  among  ethnic  groups  is  not  so\ndifferent, but that there are major variations in the coverage of essential services, likely resulting\nin different outcomes. Modern curative care is generally accepted and used if available, except\namong  some  remote  living  populations.  Demand  for  preventive  services  is  still  lower  among\nethnic  minorities,  perhaps  due  to  less  awareness  about  their  benefits.  However,  with  the\nexception of contraception, the use of preventive services is equally distributed among the poor\nand  nonpoor.  Available  data  show  some  variations  in  the  demand  for  health  services  among\nethnic  groups.  For  example,  there  is  more  demand  for  birth  spacing  and  treated  mosquito\nnetting  among  Mon-Khmer  groups.  The  Hmong-Yao  give  higher  priority  to  the  local\nmanagement  of  infections.  Iodine  supplementation  is  given  high  priority  among  the  Tibeto\nBurman group.\n\nTable A12.4: Coverage of Health Education and Services among Ethnic Groups\nTibeto\nBurman\n10\n21\n38\n37\n\nIndicator\nMonthly illness incidence\nChildren 12-23 months fully immunized\nWomen 15-49 yrs who had two doses of TT\nChildren under-five who received two capsules\n\nHmong-\nMien\n9\n7\n12\n15\n\nTai-\nKadai\n7\n38\n65\n38\n\nMon-\nKmer\n12\n8\n51\n18\n\nof vitamin A in the last year\n\nWomen who know about treatment of diarrhea\n\nWomen who know at least one contraceptive\n\nat home\n\nmethod\n\n14\n\n45\n\nWomen not able to read a simple sentence\nPersons using a bed net at night\nSource: Project Preparatory Technical Assistance Household Survey.\n\n20\n98\n\n8\n\n23\n\n51\n72\n\n3\n\n7\n\n87\n43\n\n4\n\n11\n\n77\n44\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\n13.\nSociocultural  Barriers.  These  are  reasons  for  not  attending  public  health  services.\nIsolated  minorities  have  strong  traditional  cultural  beliefs  about  ill  health  and  its  causes,  and\nprefer the intervention of spiritual healers for many of their health problems. These beliefs vary\namong  ethnic  minorities  and  need  to  be  identified  and  understood  in  each  situation  before\ninterventions can be planned for. Because of strong belief systems, modern health services for\ncertain  isolated  communities are  more  difficult  to  implement.  In  terms  of  social  barriers,  there\nare  major  language  barriers  for  females  of  the  Hmong-Yao,  Mon-Khmer,  and  Tibeto  Burman\ngroups  who  do  not  speak  Lao  while  most  staff  are  of  Lao  origin  and  do  not  speak  the  local\nlanguage. This barrier could be overcome by selecting local persons to be trained as a health\nworker. There is no evidence of major gender differences in accessing services, but privacy of\ncare for women and the presence of female staff are important.\n\n14.\nTravel and Opportunity Costs. Access is a major determinant for the use  of  services\nbecause  of  the  cost  of  transportation,  overnight  stay,  and  lost  labor.  Improving  access  will\ndisproportionally benefit ethnic minorities and the poor, as new facilities would be placed where\nno  services  are  currently  available.  Physical  access  in  using  health  services  is  illustrated  in\nTable  A12.5.  Ethnic  minorities  have  less  access  to  health  centers  and  district  headquarters\nwhich have emergency services. The Hmong-Yao and Tibeto Burman groups, about 25 percent\nof the targeted population, have least access to basic health services, as  they  often  live  more\nthan a day\u2019s travel from a health facility. At the same time, it is not cost-effective to construct a\nlarge number of health  centers.  The  facilities  will  therefore  need  to  be  strategically  located  to\nachieve  maximum  benefit.  The  villagers  are  also  requesting  reactivation  of  former  health\nworkers  living  in  the  villages.  While  nongovernment  organizations  have  been  successful  in\ndoing this, it needs to be explored if the Government can support such services.\n\nTable A12.5: Access to Health Services (percent)\n\nIndicator\nPersons using a government facility first when\n\nsick\n\nVillages accessible by road\nVillages within 4 hrs of district headquarter\nVillages within 1 hr of health center\nVillages within 1 hr of private pharmacy\nVillages having a village health provider\n\nTai-\nKadai\n46\n\nMon-\nKmer\n22\n\nHmong-\nMien\n23\n\nTibeto\nBurman\n18\n\n87\n85\n62\n79\n96\n\n53\n66\n33\n48\n80\n\n35\n45\n9\n13\n74\n\n50\n47\n16\n26\n56\n\n15.\nCost  Recovery.  Affordability  is  a  major  constraint  to  the  use  of  health  services.  The\nhousehold  survey  did  not  find  major  differences  in  health  seeking  behavior  among  ethnic\nminorities,  and  poor  and  nonpoor,  but  it  did  find  major  differences  in  expenditure  for  illness,\nwhich  may  suggest  a  difference  in  quality  of  care.  The  poorest  household  quartile  spend  an\nestimated $2.4 per month, compared to $4.2 by the second quartile, $5.0 for the third quartile,\nand $5.5 for the wealthiest group. However, 55 percent of poor households did not have enough\nmoney to pay for health care when a household member became seriously ill compared to 26\npercent  in  the  nonpoor  group  (Table  A12.6).  Most  hospitals  have  an  informal  arrangement  to\nsubsidize  services for  those  who  cannot  afford  these,  but  it  is  not  clear  to  what  extent  this  is\nadequate. At health center and village levels, staff are reluctant to give discount for drugs to the\nvery poor, as it would be difficult to manage pressures from others for discounted drug prices.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 12, page 6\n\nTable A12.6: Affordability of Health Services (percent)\n\nIndicator\nHouseholds making health expenditure during\n\nlast month\n\nTai-\nKadai\n45\n\nMon-\nKmer\n57\n\nHmong-\nMien\n41\n\nTibeto\nBurman\n33\n\nVillages with a mutual fund\nSource: Project Preparatory Technical Assistance. Household Survey.\n\n76\n\n52\n\n23\n\n22\n\nThe introduction of cost recovery for drugs has increased outpatient utilization, except by\n16.\ncivil  servants.  The  reason  is  that  drugs  became  available.  For  the  Lao-Phoutai,  the  price  of\ndrugs  and  treatment  is  an  important  determinant  in  the  choice  between  public  or  private\nservices where both are available. The price of drugs and treatment may also affect the choice\nbetween modern treatment and traditional healing. Modern treatment may be more of a problem\nfor the Mon-Khmer and Tibeto Burman who are poorer, and for the very poor in most villages.\nMany patients may not be able to afford inpatient care on the basis of full cost recovery. Many\npatients will not have enough cash to pay for services in an emergency. Hence, the Government\nhas  an  important  role  to  ensure  that  inpatient  care  for  catastrophic  illnesses  such  as\ncomplications of pregnancy and childbirth are available and affordable for the poor.\n\n17.\nCommunity  Support.  Hospital  staff  use  an  informal  system  to  determine  whether  a\npatient  should  receive  subsidized  care  or  not.  This  is  more  difficult  at  health  center  level,  as\nhealth  center  staff  are  concerned  that  many  patients  will  demand  subsidized  care  and  will\ncomplain if they do not receive it. Besides, it will be difficult for health staff to determine who is\nvery poor. The most viable option at present seems to be to make the community responsible\nfor  identifying  and  supporting  the  very  poor,  in  return  for  Government  subsidy  for  the\ncommunity.  However,  the tradition  of  communities  supporting  their  members  appears  to  vary.\nThe Tai-Kadai and Mon-Kmer often receive support from family members for health care, while\nthe  Hmong-Mien  and  Tibeto-Burman  depend  more  on  the  sale  of  household  goods.  The\nHmong-Mien  and  Tibeto-Burman  groups  also  have  less  access  to  mutual  funds  than  the  Tai-\nKadai  and  Mon-Kmer.  This  suggests  that  community  support  for  the  very  poor  may  be  more\ndifficult  to  organize  among  the  Hmong-Mien  and  the  Tibeto  Burman  groups.  In  some\ncommunities, an informal mutual fund or credit system is used to allow households to pay later\nfor services, allowing time to arrange for contributions from relatives or sale of livestock or other\nassets. Formalizing such a system is being studied in Borikhamxai Province with the help of the\nGerman Technical Cooperation (GTZ). In this pilot project, the village committees were asked to\nlook after the very poor and make adjustments for inflation. Despite high inflation and high level\nof poverty in some villages, most village committees managed to do so.\n\n18.\nCommunity Perceptions. In 1998, a study documented the perceptions of local leaders\nand community health workers regarding the quality of care at public health centers. The study\nwas  carried  out  in  two  northern  provinces,  Xieng  Khouang  and  Oudomxai,  with  70  percent\nethnic minorities. Out of 1,762 households interviewed in 97 villages, 62 percent were using  a\npublic health center. Patients using the facilities indicated that, as they travel for a long distance,\nit  is  important  that  the  health  center  has  drugs  available.  The  price  of  drugs  was  generally\nacceptable, being less than from private sources.  The  proportion  of  patients unable  to pay for\ndrugs  at  a  health  center  is  believed  to  be  small,  and  those  who  do  not  have  the  cash  are\ngenerally  allowed  to  pay  later.  Thirty  one  percent  of  the  patients  reported  that  they  did  not\nalways  find  staff  at  the  health  center.  Health  workers  were  generally  polite  to  patients  (85\npercent).  No  cases  of  informal  payments  were  reported.  Local  leaders  were  asked  what  they\nwould  like  to  see  improved  in  the health  centers. A  summary  of  recommendations  is  in  Table\nA12.7.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 12, page 7\n\nTable A12.7: Recommendations of Local Leaders to Improve the Quality of Services\n\nServices\n\nStaff\n\nFacilities\nDrugs\n\n24  hour  services;  outreach  services  for  pregnant  women  and  birth  spacing;\nprivacy for delivery; promotion of healthy lifestyle; and advice on pit latrines.\nAt  least  one  better  trained  staff  in  a  health  center;  health  workers  with  hill-tribe\nbackground; female workers for family planning services.\nBetter water supply, and more space for inpatient care\nA  larger  variety of drugs; drugs  for  emergencies;  syrups  for  children;  clear  drug\npricing guidelines; reduced drug prices; proper instructions on the use the drugs.\n\nSource: ADB PHC Project. Perception of Health Services Survey. 1998.\n\n19.\nStaff  Perceptions.  Health  workers  were  asked  in  structured  interviews  about  their\nperceptions.  Of  27  health  workers  interviewed,  18  were  willing  to  remain  or  stay  longer  in  the\nhealth  facility.  More  than  half  the  health  workers  were  satisfied  with  living  conditions.  The\nreasons  mentioned  were  (i)  living  in  own  area,  (ii)  local  authorities  provide  strong  support,\n(iii) provision  of  land  and  house,  (iv)  expecting  to  get  employment  (for  contract  workers),  and\n(v) community appreciation. About 20 percent of health workers indicated they faced difficulty in\nthe health center. Reasons given were (i) lack of notification and information about the length of\nthe  assignment,  (ii)  not  being  from  the  area,  (iii)  lack  of  attention  from  local  authorities,\n(iv) family problems, (v) lack of refresher training, (vi) the health center being far way from any\ncommunity,  (vii)  no  rewards  for  working  in  a  remote  and  difficult  location,  and  (viii)  the  land\nprovided  not  being  arable.  Most  health  workers  agreed  that  outreach  activities  are  very\nimportant,  but  only  9  of  27  health  workers  had  done  these,  and  only  3  of  them  regularly.\nReasons for not  going  on outreach are heavy  workload,  lack of  staff  to  run  the  health  center,\nand discomfort with doing a field visit alone.\n\nF.\n\nEthnic Minorities Strategy\n\n20.\n\nThe Project proposes four strategies to increase access of ethnic minorities to PHC:\n\n(i) \n\nincreasing physical access by targeting ethnic minority populations,\n\n(ii) \n\nmaking services appropriate to the needs of the ethnic minorities,\n\n(iii) \n\nmaking services socially acceptable through training and participation, and\n\n(iv) \n\nimproving affordability of services through new financing arrangements.\n\n.\n21.\nAccessible Services. The Project is aiming to expand primary health care (PHC) in the\nnorthern  region,  where ethnic  minorities  constitute about 60 percent  of  the  population.  This  is\nthe poorest region in the country. Extensive mapping of communities and services  is  ongoing.\nThe provincial steering committee will plan for providing health facilities near ethnic populations.\nPlacing new facilities near ethnic populations will be balanced with considerations of operational\nfeasibility and cost-effectiveness. To improve accessibility for  remote  communities,  the  Project\nwill increase outreach services and village-based care and promotion.  The targets are in Table\nA12.8.\n\n22.\nAppropriate Services. The Project will provide packages of interventions, training, and\ndrugs that address the  common  health problems of particular  ethnic  minorities, e.g., the  initial\nmanagement  of  pneumonia  and  iodine  deficiency  at  village  level  for  the  high  altitude\npopulations,  and  training  of  birth  attendants  among  those  tribes  using  these  services.  Where\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 12, page 8\n\nfeasible,  a  medical  assistant  will  be  posted  so  that  a  wider  range  of  services  can  be  made\navailable.  The  project facilities  will  also  provide  accommodation for overnight  stay  for  patients\nliving far away. Opening hours of services will be extended to provide better time coverage.\n\nProvince\n\nPhongsali\n\nTotal\nPopulation\n\nTable A12.8: Targeted Villages by Ethnic Group\nTotal\nTargeted\nVillages\n231\n\nEthnic Population\n\n53,490\n\nEstimated\nEthnic Villages\n\nLouang\nNamtha\n\n40,150\n\nOudomxai\n\n147,150\n\nBokeo\n\n39,760\n\nHouaphan\n\n85, 630 Phoutai 26,545\n\nXieng Khouang\n\n140,430\n\nKor 21,390\nPhounoi 18,180\nKmu 12,830\nHmong/Yao 283\nOthers 122\nLeu 20,475\nKor 9,635\nKmu 9,635\nHmong/Yao 283\nOthers 122\nKmu 85,350\nHmong 19,130\nLeu 19,130\nOthers 23,540\nKmu 13,520\nLeu 8,350\nLao 5,170\nNhuan 6,360\nHmong 2,390\nOthers 3,970\n\nLao, 25,690\nHmong 17,980\nOthers 15,415\nLao 61,790\nHmong 17,980\nPhoutai 15,450\nOthers 15,430\n\nKor 92\nPhounoi 78\nKmu 55\nHmong/Yao 3\nOthers 3\nLeu 85\nKor 40\nKmu 40\nHmong/Yao 2\nOthers 1\nKmu 324\nHmong 78\nLeu 67\nOthers 91\nKmu 82\nLeu 48\nLao 31\nNhuan 36\nHmong 15\nOthers 30\nPhutai 103\nLao 96\nHmong 67\nOthers 56\nLao 154\nHmong 122\nPhoutai 39\nOthers 35\n\n168\n\n560\n\n242\n\n322\n\n350\n\nThe target population is estimated based on the percentage of each ethnic  groups  indicated in the  National  Statistic\nPopulation Census 1995.\n\n23.\nAcceptable Services.

The provincial steering committee will ensure that this is\ndone  for  each  targeted  district  as  part  of  the  annual  provincial  plan.  The  Project  will  also\nredistribute  staff  speaking  the  local  language  and  train  additional  persons  belonging  to  the\nethnic monitories as auxiliary nurses and village health providers.

To  improve  financial  access,  the  Project  will  set  up  a  drug\nrevolving fund at the village level that will provide drugs at a cost lower than that provided by the\nprivate sector. Given the problems identified in providing subsidy or discounted services to the\nvery poor, community organizations will be asked to make arrangements to assist the very poor\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 12, page 9\n\nas  the  communities\u2019  contribution  to  establishing  the  drug  revolving  fund.  The  improvement  of\naccess  of  health  services  will  also  make  services  more  affordable,  as  travel  and  opportunity\ncosts  will  reduce.  Options  for  using  the  village  mutual  funds  as  a  post-payment  system  and\nmaking hospitals services more affordable will be explored.\n\nTable A12.9: Training Targets for Village Health Workers and Health Staff\n\nProvince\n\nPhongsali\n\nLouang\nNamtha\n\nOudomxai\n\nBokeo\n\nHouaphan\n\nXieng\nKhouang\n\nEthnic\nGroup\n\nKor\nPhounoi\nKmu\nHmong/Yao\nHor\nLeu\nKor\nKmu\nTaidam\nHmong/Yao\nLaohouay\nKmu\nHmong\nLeu\nHor\nPhoutai\nOthers\nKmu\nLeu\nNhuan\nLao\nHmong\nKui\nOthers\nPhoutai\nLao\nHmong\nTaidam\nOthers\nLao\nHmong\nPhoutai\nKmu\nOthers\n\nNo. of Village Health\nWorkers to be Trained\nFemale\nTotal\n32\n106\n45\n90\n31\n63\n1\n3\n1\n3\n29\n58\n12\n42\n21\n43\n18\n36\n2\n8\n1\n7\n186\n373\n25\n83\n41\n83\n12\n40\n15\n30\n12\n40\n26\n52\n22\n44\n11\n23\n10\n20\n4\n9\n1\n6\n1\n4\n57\n114\n55\n111\n22\n74\n17\n37\n10\n34\n88\n177\n41\n137\n20\n41\n8\n16\n10\n33\n\nNumber of Health Staff\nto be Trained\n\nTotal\n34\n22\n16\n2\n2\n14\n14\n14\n9\n1\n1\n92\n28\n20\n14\n8\n14\n13\n11\n6\n5\n2\n2\n8\n28\n28\n26\n9\n11\n44\n46\n10\n5\n11\n\nFemale\n10\n11\n8\n1\n1\n7\n4\n7\n4\n0\n0\n46\n8\n10\n4\n4\n5\n6\n5\n3\n2\n1\n0\n2\n14\n14\n8\n4\n4\n22\n14\n5\n2\n3\n\n\f66\n\nBENEFIT MONITORING AND EVALUATION\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\n1.\nThe purpose of the benefit monitoring and evaluation system is to (i) provide essential,\naccurate, timely, and systematized information on the quantitative and qualitative performance\nof the Project components; (ii) ensure that problems and opportunities are identified, analyzed,\nshared, and responded to in a  timely  manner;  and  (iii)  make  the  Project\u2019s  impact  known  one\nyear  after  completion  of  the  Project.  The  indicators  will  be  based  on  the  concept  of  input,\nprocess,  coverage,  and  impact.  Inputs  include  hardware  and  software  including  policies  and\nguidelines. The process refers to the quantity and quality of activities performed. Output refers\nto  the  product  of  the  services  and  management  as  measured  at  the  point  of  delivery  and\nincluded utilization of services, a key indicator of this Project, and client satisfaction (patients,\nstaff,  others).  Coverage  refers  to  the  proportion  of  a  population  having  used  a  particular\nservice,  e.g.,  the  proportion  of  children  immunized  or  couples  using  modern  contraceptives.\nImpact refers to the change in the health status within the targeted population, e.g., reduction\nin infant mortality rate and fertility.\n\n2.\nComponent 1, improved access to quality primary health care (PHC), will be monitored\nfor  inputs,  process,  and  output  indicators  using  an  improved  version  of  the  existing  health\ninformation  system.  The  provincial  health  office  will  be  assisted  to  strengthen  the  provincial\nmonitoring system  for  health  services.  In  addition,  a  health  facility  survey  will  be  done  at  the\nbeginning,  at  midterm,  and  on  completion  of  the  Project.  The  survey  will  include  an\nassessment  of  training  needs  and  staff  skills.  This  will  be  supplemented  by  spotchecking  of\nfacilities, covering all facilities each year,  as  part  of  supervision.  A  standardized  checklist  will\nbe used for yearly aggregation, similar to the one being used for the facility survey. For village-\nlevel  activities,  simple  activities  and  supply  request  forms  will  be  used  (visual  for  birth\nattendants, as most are illiterate). Beneficiary perceptions will be obtained through focus group\ndiscussions at village level and exit interviews during health facility surveys.\n\n3.\nThe  Project  will  rely  on  its  own  household  surveys  to  assess  coverage  and  impact,\nincluding a baseline survey in eight provinces (six project provinces and two controls) the first\nyear of project  implementation,  a  midterm  survey  in  three  selected  provinces  before  midterm\nreview scheduled toward the end of year three, and a repeat survey in the eight provinces in\nyear six. The survey will follow the World Health Organization (WHO) standard cluster survey\nused  for  immunization.  It  will  be  of  sufficient  size  to  measure  the  more  frequent  phenomena\nsuch as infant mortality for each province. Maternal mortality will be monitored separately from\ncensus information. Special studies will be done to probe into determinants of use of services.\n\n4.\nComponent  2  mainly  involves  systems  development  and  capacity  building  and  will  be\nmonitored  in  terms  of  products,  activities  of  the  provincial  health  offices,  and  use  of  the\nproducts  by  the  health  services  in  all  provinces.  For  this  purpose,  the  provincial  project\nimplementation offices will each month complete a separate primary health care management\nmonitoring  form.  The  project  management  office  will  be  responsible  for  aggregation  of  the\ninformation of the 18 provinces. Qualitative studies will be carried to probe deeper into some of\nthe reasons for poor or good performance.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nCoverage\n\nContraceptive Prevalence Rate\n\nHouseholds Using Iodized Salt\n\nMosquito Nets\n\nOutput\n\nHealth Facility Attendance\n\nMCH-FP Attendance\n\nHospital Deliveries\n\nProcess\n\nTable A13.1: Estimated Baseline Values and Targets in 6 Provinces\n\nBaseline  2000 Target 2006\n\nSource\n\nIndicator\n\nImpact\n\nCrude Birth Rate/1,000 persons\n\nInfant Mortality Rate/1,000 live births\n\nMaternal Mortality Rate/100,000 live births*\n\n41\n\n104\n\n490\n\n36\n\n75\n\n355\n\nSurvey\n\nSurvey\n\nCensus\n\nChildren  under  Five  Sleeping  under  Treated\n\n14 percent\n\n35 percent\n\n23 percent\n\n45 percent\n\n67 percent\n\n90 percent\n\nHHS\n\nHHS\n\nHHS\n\nEligible Children Fully Immunized\n\n32 percent\n\n68 percent\n\nHHS\n\nVillage Health Care Providers Attendance\n\n(Baseline)\n\nDouble\n\nHIS/HFSS\n\nHealth Centers with MCH-FP Services\n\n20 percent\n\n50 percent\n\nHIS/HFSS\n\nVillage Visits by Quarter\n\n10 percent\n\n60 percent\n\nVillages with Functioning Village Health\n\n5 percent\n\n40 percent\n\nCommittees\n\nNumber of District Hospitals for Major Surgery\n\n8\n\n(Baseline)\n\n(Baseline)\n\n40 percent\nincrease\n\n60 percent\nincrease\n\nHIS/HFSS\n\nHIS/HFSS\n\n10 percent\n\n20 percent\n\nHIS/HFSS\n\n30 percent\n\n80 percent\n\n50 percent\n\n90 percent\n\nHIS\n\nHIS\n\nHIS\n\nHIS\n\nHIS\n\nPIO\n\nPIO\n\nPIO\n\nPIO\n\n1200\n\n100\n\n50\n\n85\n\n70\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nSupervision Visits by Quarter\n\nHIS Reports Received\n\nInputs\n\nNumber of Village Health Providers Trained\n\nNumber of Ethnic Minority Staff Trained\n\nNumber of Health Centers Equipped\n\nTargeted Health Center Kits Supplied/year\n\nTargeted Drug Revolving Kits Supplied/year\n\n*  Maternal  Mortality  Rate,  actually  a  ratio,  is  difficult  to  measure  and  not  a  good  indicator  to  measure  project\nimpact.

The interventions\nare targeted specifically at  the poor and  ethnic  minorities  (both  about 60  percent of  the  target\npopulation),  and  address  conditions  that  impose  a  large  disease  burden  such  as  malaria,\nrespiratory  infections,  diarrhea,  and  micronutrient  deficiencies.  The  Project  will  address\nproblems  that  account  for  more  than  30  percent  of  the  burden  of  disease  for  women  and\nchildren,  in  particular  reproductive  health  care.  The  Project  will  protect  children  during  a\nvulnerable time in their lives, thus improving their intellectual and psychomotor development.\n\n3.\nThe  economic  rationale  for  public  intervention  in  PHC  service  is  strong  and  well\nestablished. First, PHC services, especially immunization, are mostly public goods or have large\npositive externalities,  and  will  not  be adequately provided  by  the private  sector.  Second,  PHC\nservices are  marked  by  informational  imperfection,  e.g.,  long-run  effects  of  early  childhood  or\nmothers\u2019  health  status,  leading  to  low  levels  of  demand,  and  poor  supply  response  from  the\nprivate  sector.  Third,  the  failure  of  insurance  markets  for  basic  health  care,  e.g.,  delivery\ncomplications, puts poor households at high risk of catastrophic expenditure and this risk can be\nsignificantly reduced by improved public PHC. Fourth, PHC services can contribute significantly\nto poverty reduction among the less endowed segments of the population, and therefore, there\nis a redistributive and safety-net rationale for public intervention. Finally, PHC services  can  be\nprovided  publicly  in  a  relatively  inexpensive  and  sustainable  manner  under  an  appropriate\ndelivery design and financing arrangements.\n\n4.\nThe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  household  survey  found  that  the\naverage  household expenditure  is about  $6.70  per  person  per  year,  and  77  percent  of  this  is\nspent on drugs. This shows little room for average households in the project areas to spend on\npreventive  health  care,  unless  supported  by  public  sector  intervention.  Their  overall  health\nneeds would be better served by spending more of their time and limited financial resources on\npreventive  care  than  curative  care.  The  market failure  in  PHC  services  is  exacerbated  by  the\nremoteness  of  the  population  and  the  quality  gap  between  the  beneficiaries\u2019  expectation  and\navailable supplies. Major findings of the household survey indicate that (i) the ethnic minorities\nare  in  more  remote  and  less  accessible  areas  than  the  majority  Tai-Kadai  group;  (ii)  the\naccessibility to services and preventive outcomes are lower in ethnic minorities; (iii) the disease\nburden  is  slightly  higher  for  ethnic  minorities;  and  (iv)  the  literacy  rate  and  level  of  health\nknowledge among ethnic women are very low. These suggest the need for public intervention to\nenhance knowledge  and therefore  realize  potential  demand  for  PHC  services  on  the  demand\nside and  improve access  and  quality  on  the  supply  side.  Based on the  experience  of  the  first\nPHC  project,  the  Project  will  improve  the  efficiency  of  PHC  service  delivery  in  rural  areas  by\nrationalizing  the  spatial  distribution  of  physical  facilities  according  to  topography,  population\ndensity,  population  growth  rates,  and  proximity  to  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities.  Also,  the\nProject will concentrate on the provision of services that are either public goods  or have  large\npositive externalities, such as the prevention and treatment of contagious diseases.\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nThe PPTA village survey found that village health care providers (VHPs) are present at a\n5.\nhigh rate among all ethnic groups (the minimum is among Tibeto-Burman group, with one VHP\nin  56  percent  of  villages).  However,  they  need  some  incentive  and  training  to  take  on  PHC\nservices to serve villagers effectively. The Project will reach out to these VHPs and enable their\nparticipation  in  the  provision  at  the  grassroots  level.  Due  to  the  absence  of  private  sector\nproviders of  PHC  services  and also  near-absence  of  private health  services, except  sellers of\ndrugs, the Project is not likely to infringe on activities of private sector providers. Conversely, the\nProject  is  likely  to  enhance  the  awareness  of  rural  population  about  the  importance  of  health\ncare  in  general,  leading  to  higher  willingness  to  pay  for  health  care,  which  may  result  in\nattracting better-quality private providers of basic curative services.\n\n6.\nAnother  market  failure  aspect,  economies  of  scale  of  health  information  provision  and\nsupervision,  will  be  addressed  by  the  Project\u2019s  support  for  the  establishment  of  new  PHC\ncoordination  units  at  the  central,  regional,  and  provincial  levels.  Many  external  agencies  and\nnongovernment organizations are conducting a wide variety of PHC  activities at every  level  of\nthe  network,  and  the  Project  will  enable  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  to  coordinate  and\norchestrate  these  current  activities  and  plan  for  further  expansion  of  the  PHC  network,  in\naccordance  with  the  PHC  policy.  Especially,  standardization  and  implementation  of  PHC\nmanagement  information  systems  such  as  health  information  and  cost  recovery  reporting\nsystems will help exploit the economies of scale or scope, and improve efficiency.\n\n7.\nThe  Project  has  been  specifically  designed  to  reduce  poverty  by  meeting  the  health\nneeds  of  the  rural  poor  and  ethnic  minorities.  While  the  Project  aims  to  provide  preventive\nservices  to  all  segments  of  the  population  in  the  project  provinces,  the  poor  will  receive  a\ndisproportionate  benefit  by  getting  better  access  to  services  at  a  lower  cost.  The  Project  will\nfurther  streamline  cost  recovery  mechanisms  to  improve  cross-subsidy  to  the  very  poor.  The\nProject will provide for PHC targeted services to the poor as a result of several design features\nsuch as VHP  mobilization,  training  support  for  indigenous  people  to  become  auxiliary  nurses,\nand  local  contribution  to  staff  houses  at  subdistrict  health  units.  The  Project  also  has  been\ndesigned to benefit women. Women will constitute a priority group of the Project beneficiaries,\nwith  specific  interventions  aimed at  improving  women\u2019s health  (e.g.,  birth  spacing,  supplies  of\ncontraceptives, and mobile teams to assist delivery emergency).\n\n8.\nOverall,  the  Project  focuses  its  resources  on  proven  high  health  impact,  cost-effective\ninterventions  for  reducing  morbidity  and  mortality.  At  the  same  time,  the  Project  will  explore\ninnovative  financing  options  at  various  levels.  The  PPTA  social  analysis  indicates  high\nwillingness to share costs of health services but the willingness to pay is linked with the quality\nof services provided. The Project includes development of cost recovery and incentive systems\nat the provincial hospital level to explore improved financing of better-quality basic referral-level\nservices, which will in turn enhance the user trust in the PHC network as a whole.\n\nB.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\n9.\nThrough a number of channels, the PHC expansion  will  bring  about economic  benefits\nby  improving  the  health  status  of  children  and  adults  (especially  women)  by  decreasing\nmorbidity and mortality. For example, improvement in health status will lead to: (i) enhance the\nhuman  capital  base  and  labor  productivity  of  the  country\u2019s  workforce;  (ii)  increase  the  future\nsavings  rate  and  capital  formation  by  reducing  the  household  health  care  expenditures;\n(iii) improve  physical  and  intellectual development,  thereby  increasing  returns  to  education  for\nchildren;  and  (iv)  allow  the  poor  to  escape  from  the  vicious  loop  of  low  health  status,  large\nnumber of children, low educational input, and low productivity.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nC.\n\nCost-Effectiveness Analysis\n\n10.\nCost-effectiveness  of  health  interventions  is  often  measured  as  cost  per  disability\nadjusted  life  years  (DALYs)  saved.  A  DALY  is  a  measure  that  combines  mortality,  morbidity,\nand disability weighted for years of life saved at different ages, with social preference in favor of\nworking-age  years  reflected  in  the  implicit  weights.  Despite  limitations,  DALYs  provide  a\nquantification of the burden of disease  comparable  across  alternative  health  interventions  and\nare increasingly used in developing countries. For the purpose of analysis, DALYs are used to\nindicate the current burden of disease from a selected set of medical conditions addressed by\nthe  Project.  For accuracy,  DALYs  should be  calculated from  data  specific  to  the  country.  The\nrequisite data for these calculations is not yet available in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n(Lao PDR), and a second-best approach for the estimation of DALYs has been taken.\n\n11.\nThe greatest difficulty in economic analysis of health projects lies in the uncertainties of\nthe reduction of disease burden, or saving in the otherwise lost DALYs every year in this case,\nspecifically  accruable  to  the  Project.  The  incremental  DALYs  saved  due  to  the  Project  also\ndepend  on  the  assumed  counterfactual  scenario  without  the  Project.  For  the  current  Project,\nPHC services are targeted primarily to the poor and the new pricing policy on medical fees and\nconsumables  will  not  significantly  influence  the  target  population\u2019s  use  of  the  PHC  services.\nHere,  the  \u201cbefore-project\u201d  baseline  health  situation  is  simply  taken  as  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d\nsituation  and  different  scenarios  (low,  moderate,  and  high)  have  been  prepared  to  test  the\nrobustness  of  cost-effectiveness  indicators  to  different  effective  PHC  coverage  of  the  target\npopulation. The low scenario assumes that the percentage of the target population reached and\nfull impact of the PHC intervention on mortality and morbidity realized will gradually increase to\n10  percent  during  the  project  implementation  and  stay  so  thereafter.  The  moderate  and  high\nscenarios  assume  the  percentage  will  gradually  increase  to  15  and  20  percent,  respectively,\nduring the project implementation period and stay so thereafter. The project life is assumed to\nbe 15 years, beyond which the project investments will cease to yield health benefits and leave\nno residual value.\n\n12.\nBoth financial and economic costs per DALY saved are calculated based on a range of\nassumptions and conversions described in the main text.  The Project\u2019s costs stream and output\n(DALY saved) streams are summarized in Table A14.1.\n\nTable A14.1: DALYs Saved\n\nFinancial Cost per DALY saved\nLow Scenario:           $49.02/DALY\n\nEconomic Cost per DALY saved\nLow Scenario:           $45.82/DALY\n\nModerate Scenario:  $30.08/DALY\n\nModerate Scenario:  $28.11/DALY\n\nHigh Scenario:         $22.56/DALY\n\nHigh Scenario:         $21.09/DALY\n\nADB\u2019s  Policy for the Health Sector  lists  costs  per  DALY  saved  for  some  comparable  health\ninterventions  as  follows:  immunization  at  $25,  family  planning  at  $25-75,  malaria  prevention\nusing impregnated mosquito nets at $15-20. The high scenario cost is considered well within the\nacceptable  range  compared  with  the  international  norm.  The  low  scenario  cost  is  somewhat\nhigher than the international comparator, which may be explained by the assumptions regarding\nthe  cost  of  services,  in  particular  family  planning  services,  which  appears  quite  high,  and  the\ngeographical condition in the Lao PDR. This would justify relatively higher cost per DALY saved.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\nD.\n\nFinancial Sustainability\n\n1.\n\nFiscal Impact\n\nHealth sector projects are normally net users of government income. The magnitude of\n13.\ntheir fiscal impact must be put in the context of the total government health budget to establish\nwhether  there  is  a  financial  gap  that  must  be  bridged  either  by  higher  taxation,  borrowing,  or\nuser  charges.  Fiscal  affordability  of  the  recurrent  project  expenditure  needs  especially  to  be\nestablished.  Such  analysis  should  ideally  be  broken  down  to  the  smallest  budgetary  unit.  For\nthe Project, an  attempt has  been  made  to  assess the financial  sustainability  by  province.  The\ncurrent Project is unlikely to be subject to a major fungibility problem.\n\nUpon completion of the physical investments, the average annual recurrent expenditure\n14.\nneeded to sustain the Project activities is estimated at $245,500, comprised of maintaining costs\nof buildings, equipment, and vehicles, and operational costs of supervising health care workers\nat  rural  health  units  and  VHPs.  This  amount  is  broken  down  by  province  as  in  Table  A14.2.\nAlso,  using  the  1997/98  expenditure  data  as  a  guide  (data  from  more  recent  years  have  not\nbeen obtainable from the Government), annual health sector recurrent expenditure by province\nwas estimated as shown in the table. Although it is difficult to predict with precision, the overall\nincremental recurrent costs associated with the Project is estimated to be about 8 percent of the\nannual  government  health  expenditure.  The  overall  prospect  for  sustainability  is  favorable  as\nMOH has committed to allocate more budget to promotive and preventive services, although the\nrisk  of  macroeconomic  instability  will  be  beyond  MOH\u2019s  control,  as  has been  observed  during\n1997-1999.  The  six  provinces  with  a  comprehensive  development  program  will  require  10-16\npercent incremental recurrent costs to sustain project activities.\n\nTable A14.4: Recurrent Cost and Budget Projection by Province\n\n($1000 Costant 2000\nPrices)\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\nAverage\n\n2004-6\n\n1997/98\nEstimated\nRecurrent\nHealth\nExpenditure\n\nAdjusted to\n2000 by\n3.7Percent\nInternational\nInflation\n\n20.9\n20.1\n16.1\n18.8\n25.9\n23.4\n14.0\n7.2\n101.5\n\n16.2\n18.5\n15.4\n17.4\n23.4\n20.9\n11.6\n7.5\n125.2\n\n19.0\n17.9\n13.7\n16.7\n23.9\n22.1\n12.3\n7.9\n98.9\n\n   18.7\n   18.8\n   15.1\n   17.6\n   24.4\n   22.1\n   12.6\n     7.6\n108.5\n\n   111.5\n   178.0\n   124.6\n   169.1\n   189.7\n   162.9\n   297.5\n   229.4\n1,345.0\n\n   115.6\n   184.6\n   129.2\n   175.3\n   196.7\n   168.9\n   308.5\n   237.8\n1,394.8\n\nBokeo\nLouang Namtha\nPhongsali\nHouaphan\nOudomxai\nXieng Khouang\nLouang Phrabang\nSayaburi\nOther Provinces\nand Central\nMOH\n   Total\n\n2.\n\nCost Recovery\n\n247.9\n\n256.2 232.4\n\n245.5\n\n2,807.5\n\n2,911.3\n\n   8\n\nProject\ncost\nPercentage\nShare in\nthe Budget\n 16\n 10\n 12\n 10\n 12\n 13\n   4\n   3\n   8\n\n15.\nIn  addition  to  the  Government  assurance  that  public  health  expenditures  will  be\nmaintained or increased in real terms, the Project employs the following specific mechanisms to\nincrease the likelihood of financial sustainability.\n\n(i) \n\nincreased cost recovery revenue from those able to pay, through more accurate\npricing of services based on total costs of goods and service provision;\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 14, page 5\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nincreased cost recovery revenue from more accurate replacement cost pricing to\nkeep up with inflation for drugs and other medical consumables;\npublic-private  partnerships  with  VHPs  for  revolving  funds  with  full  replacement\ncost pricing;\nincreased  cost  recovery  revenue  from  the  pricing  of  hospital  services,  which\ncurrently are not routinely charged for;\nincreased  retention of  cost  recovery  revenue  by  exempting  public  health  sector\nrevenue from provincial taxes; and\nincreased revenue from provincial health services subscription system to reduce\nthe financial risks of hospitalization and chronic illness.\n\n16.\nSince  Prime  Minister  Decree  52  was  implemented,  cost  recovery  systems  for  drugs,\nother medical  consumables,  and  services  have  been  moving from an experimental  stage to  a\nmore developed and systematic approach in the more advanced central and regional hospitals.\nCost recovery  in  these hospitals  is  substantial and  increasing.  Currently, fees  are  charged for\ndrugs, treatment, laboratory tests,  x-rays,  hospital  rooms,  medical  supplies, and documents  in\ncentral, regional, provincial, and some district hospitals. Drugs are paid into revolving drug fund\n(RDF) at virtually every level of the public health care system. The level of cost recovery through\nRDF  and  fees  collected  for  medial  consumables  and  services  averages  about  60  percent  of\nrevenue  at  major hospitals, and  about 36  percent  at  successful  district hospitals.  Smaller  and\nremote  provincial and district  hospitals  are  thought  to  recover  lower  percentages  of  operating\ncosts. (Findings from facility visits during the fact-finding mission are available upon request.)\n\n17.\nUsing  secondary  data  in  reports  on  the  number  of  outpatients  and  inpatients  at\nrepresentative  provincial  and  district  hospitals,  the  PPTA  social  analysis  attempted  a  rough\nquantitative analysis of use to cost recovery adoption. The analysis found that in all hospitals for\nwhich  the  data  were  collected,  implementation  of  RDFs  were  associated  with  better  quality\ndrugs and lower cost than available in private pharmacies.\n\n18.\nSome groups in the population are more sensitive to the implementation of cost recovery\nsystems. These groups are the poor, women, children, and ethnic minorities. Data collected at\nPak Ou district hospital in Xieng Khouang province, specifically for  outpatient  visits,  show  that\nan increased use by each group after RDF was implemented in 1995. Thus, RDF did not lead to\na fall in use by sensitive groups. Regarding the variation in use among different groups, most of\nthe Mon-Kmer and Hmong-Mien villages are in the remotest zone and the first barrier to access\nfor  these  ethnic  groups  is  geographic.  Use  by  these  groups  is  less  sensitive  to  a  variation  of\nservice quality at the hospital.\n\n19.\nInitial experimentation with RDF led to some failures, but these failures taught valuable\nlessons,  including  the  needs:  (i)  to  establish  and  enforce  simple  accounting  systems,  (ii)  for\ntraining, especially at the district and lower levels in the accounting system; (iii) for oversight for\npricing and procurement by a capable, trained fund manager in PHOs; (iv) to price drugs based\non drug cost, to  safeguard  against  inflation;  and  (v)  to  stockpile  drugs and other  supplies, not\nmoney.  Regarding  treatment  fees,  there  are  also  lessons  to  be  learned.  Although  the  current\ngovernment policy encourages treatment fees to be charged for professional medical services,\nvery  few  hospitals  do  so.  This,  combined  with  low  salaries  for  medical  professionals,\ndiscourages doctors, nurses, and other trained personnel from dedicating themselves to public\nhospital duties, and encourages them to take second jobs to supplement their income.\n\n20.\nThe prices paid for drugs, medical consumables, and other items in public hospitals and\nhealth  centers are based  on  the  cost  to  buy the  supplies. As far  as  the  provincial  and  district\nhospitals visited by the fact-finding mission, charges for various  services  including  the  markup\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 14, page 6\n\nfor drugs (25 percent markup on drugs: 5 percent for logistics and transportation; 10 percent for\nlost  or  stolen  drugs;  and  10  percent  for  administration  costs)  appeared  to  be  more  or  less\nuniform.  However,  on  the  \u201ctax\u201d  side,  the  PPTA  report  indicates  that  there  are  different\ninterpretations of the decree.\n\n21.\nUnder Decree 52, hospitals are supposed to identify the poor on the basis of a card or\ndocument issued by the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare or by the village head. However,\nthe administrative costs of \u201cmeans testing\u201d systems outweigh the benefits of collected fees from\nthose who actually pay. In the Lao PDR, a common sense approach that minimizes costs and\nprotects the poor is being used at most of the major hospitals examined. This informal system\nappears to have evolved on its own merit, and in the short to medium run, seems to be the only\nfeasible option given the current lack of official proof of the income level and high administrative\ncosts  and  management  capacity  required  for  systematic  document-based  formal  system.\nHowever, in the long run, a document-based transparent system will be necessary.\n\n22.\nA  detailed  design  for  the  proposed  cost  recovery  measures  will  be  studied  and  pilot\ntested during project implementation under the financing option component. (Preliminary terms\nof reference are available upon request.) Basic principles for cost recovery have been prepared.\n\n23.\nThe Government will have to provide subsidy to most of the PHC services in the medium\nterm  as  only  limited  revenue  can  be  raised  even  from  the  nonpoor  in  the  Lao  PDR.  For\nexample, a living allowance for staff at subdistrict health centers will have to be provided by the\nGovernment,  while  drug  supply  will  primarily  be  financed  through  cost  recovery  and\nGovernment  subsidy  in  case  of  unexpected  depletion.  In  the  long  run,  risk-pooling  schemes\nshould  be  expanded  so  that  health  financing  becomes  more  self-sustainable  without\nGovernment subsidy.\n\n24.\nMOH  has  proposed  that  the 20  percent  \u201ctax\u201d  be  abolished  so  that  100  percent  of  cost\nrecovery revenue can be retained at the point of  collection.  Taxing nonprofit entities  seems  to\nhave little rationale. The appraisal mission could not confirm the specific use of these taxes. The\ncollected taxes probably go back to the general Ministry of Finance coffer and no earmarking is\ndone.  Even  if  the  Government\u2019s  purpose  is  to  use  the  collected  tax  solely  for  PHC  and\npreventive care, it would still be more efficient and reduce administrative costs to retain them at\nthe point of collection and supervise the hospitals and accounting staff to direct the money for\nspecific purposes such as maternal child care and family planning. This issue needs follow-up\nduring the project implementation.\n\nE. \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis\n\n1.\n\nPoverty Incidence\n\n25.\nAlthough  the  Lao  PDR  is  generally  recognized  as  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the\nAsian and Pacific Region,  consistent data are not  available  to properly  establish  the  country\u2019s\npoverty line and poverty incidence. The Government has yet to decide upon an official poverty\nline.  Two  poverty  lines  developed  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  Swedish  Statistics  Office  give\nconflicting  results  on  poverty  incidence.  The  PPTA  household  survey  chose  rice  shortage\n(whether the household had enough rice during the last year) as an indicator of poverty.  Field\nsurveys found that poverty in rural villages in the Lao PDR in subsistence production is mainly\nlinked with lack of workforce and land shortage. Lack of both combined is best reflected in rice\nshortage.  But  this  does  not  allow  comparison  between  provinces  and  regions.  The  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  study  in  May  2000  attempted  to  make  the  calculation  of  poverty  line\nconsistent  between  the  1992/93  Lao  Expenditure  and  Consumption  Survey  (LECS1)  and  the\n\n\f1997/98  update  (LECS2)  based  on  which  the  average  total  poverty  line  for  the  Lao  PDR  is\nestimated to be KR20,911 per person per month in 1997/98 prices (about $9 as opposed to the\nWorld Bank criterion of $14). Taking this poverty line for the current analysis, poverty incidences\nin the target provinces are given on Table A14.3.\n\nAppendix 14, page 7\n\nTable A14.3: Percentage of Poor by Province\n\n1992/93\n\n1997/98\n\nBokeo\nLouang Namtha\nPhongsali\nHouaphan\nOudomxai\nXieng Khouang\nLuang Phrabang\nSayaburi\nLao PDR\n\n70.4\n74.3\n94.8\n90.7\n70.8\n72.8\n81.9\n50.6\n62.7\n\nChange Number of Districts\nwith Majority Poor\n3 out of 5\n3 out of 5\n6 out of 7\n6 out of 6\n7 out of 7\n4 out of 7\n8 out of 10\n3 out of 10\n74 out of 128\n\n-19.4\n-7.5\n-23.1\n-9.4\n6.7\n-30.3\n-20.7\n-18.7\n-15.8\n\n75\n\n51.0\n66.8\n71.7\n81.3\n77.5\n42.5\n61.2\n31.9\n46.9\n\n26.\nThere was a remarkable reduction in poverty incidence during the mid-1990s. Although\nthe  rich  seem  to  have  benefited  more  than  the  poor,  the  benefits  of  economic  growth  have\neffectively trickled down during this period. Among the four regions of the country, the northern\nregion has the highest poverty incidence at 61.7 percent (down from 76.5 percent). The poverty\nincidence in Vientiane Municipality has been the lowest at 8.4 percent (down from 27.4 percent).\nThe numbers for  the  central and  southern  regions  are 42.4 percent  (down from  59.5  percent)\nand  53.5  percent  (down  from  67.6  percent),  respectively.  In  addition  to  this  large  variation\nbetween regions, there are also differences between provinces. Among those with the highest\npoverty  incidence  are  the  project  target  provinces  such  as  Phongsali,  Houaphan,  and\nOudomxai.  The  differential  performances  in  the  reduction  of  poverty  incidence  appears  to  be\nassociated  strongly  with  the  degree  of  access  to  markets,  including  overseas  markets,  in  the\nPRC, Thailand, and Viet Nam.\n\n2. Differential Project Impact\n\n27.\nThe  percentages  of  the  poor  in  the  above  Table  A14.3  can  be  considered  an\napproximation of a \u201cpoverty impact ratio\u201d based on population headcount in the target provinces;\nthus,  62  percent  of  the  project  benefits  are  considered  to  go  to  the  poor.  But  this  simple\ninterpretation assumes that the burden of diseases are distributed in a simple proportion of the\npopulation and the project services are used by everyone equally. In reality, the Project is very\nlikely to benefit the poor more than this number indicates, because  (i) the burden of disease is\nmore than proportionately affecting the poor, (ii) the analysis found that poverty is not linked with\nthe degree of remoteness of villages, and (iii) project services at lower level health facilities will\ncreate access to the poor who cannot currently afford the travel cost and effectively  constitute\neconomic subsidy targeted at them.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 14 July 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nKN1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Kip (KN)\n$0.0001262\nKN7,920\n", "For the purpose of calculations in this Report, an exchange rate of $1.00=KN7,500 has\n", "been used.
