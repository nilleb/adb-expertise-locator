THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Economic Recovery Support Program. \n \n2.  The program will help Tonga restore and accelerate inclusive growth, which has been \nadversely affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The program aims to \nachieve this by (i) strengthening fiscal management, (ii) improving the enabling environment for \nthe  private  sector,  and  (iii)  enhancing  human  resource  management.  It  builds  on  reforms \nsupported by Asian Development Bank (ADB) programs since 2009 and ongoing discussions with \nthe government.1 A single tranche stand-alone policy-based grant is proposed under the program \nas key reforms intended to improve debt management, limit public wage bill growth, attract foreign \nand domestic investment, promote greater labor force participation by women and better manage \nscarce labor resources through improved mobility institutions are already under implementation. \nThe program was developed in collaboration with the World Bank and the governments of \nAustralia and New Zealand, who also provide budget support and technical assistance (TA) to \nTonga to support its reform agenda. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development context. Tonga\u2019s population of about 107,000 is dispersed across 36 of its \n172 islands in the South Pacific, with a quarter of the population in the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa. Tonga \nfaces many structural challenges because of its geographic remoteness, small size, and exposure \nto disasters caused by natural hazards. These factors reduce competitiveness by raising the costs \nof production and public service delivery, lower private sector participation in economic activity, \nand constrain institutional capacity development, hampering growth.2 \n \n4.  The public sector is the major driver of the economy, providing infrastructure and public \nservices. Public sector resources help sustain growth, manage risks, and reduce poverty. Private \nsector growth is constrained by a weak business environment, low foreign investment inflows, \nand skilled labor shortages.3 While women have higher participation rates than men in education \nat all levels, their labor force participation is 14 percentage points lower than men.4 Gender-based \nviolence (GBV) is a key barrier to women\u2019s participation, including in the labor force: of ever-\npartnered women aged 15\u201349 years, 40% have experienced intimate partner violence.5 Extreme \npoverty is rare, but there is significant material deprivation and vulnerability, especially in rural \nareas. Migration and remittances help alleviate poverty and finance the current account deficit. \nIn fiscal year (FY) 2019, Tonga received remittances of 27.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), \ncompared with a Pacific average of 7.2%, with an estimated 5,774 workers (about 14% of the \ntotal domestic workforce) engaged in seasonal worker schemes in Australia and New Zealand. \n \n1   ADB.

Economic growth. Although Tonga has not recorded any case of COVID-19, border \nclosures and reduced economic activity because of the pandemic have exacerbated Tonga\u2019s \ndevelopment challenges. Tonga recorded successive years of growth between FY2015 and \nFY2019, averaging 2.4%. Along with Tropical Cyclone Harold in April 2020, the COVID-19 \npandemic, however, caused the economy to contract by 0.8% of GDP in FY2020.6 As the \npandemic continued, declines in tourism and delays on construction projects hit the private sector \nhard, affected employment, and caused a deeper contraction estimated at 5.3% in FY2021.7 \nRecovery of growth (projected at 1.8% in FY2022) will depend largely on reopening borders and \nresuming tourism, underpinned by the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.8 \n \n6.  Macroeconomic management. The government has maintained a generally prudent \nfiscal  stance  during  2017\u20132020.  Stable  revenue  collections  despite  frequent  disasters, \nexpenditure controls, and strong policy reforms that attracted support from development partners, \nled to fiscal surpluses in FY2017\u2013FY2020.9 This helped build up cash reserves, which contributed \nto financing the government\u2019s COVID-19 response, while containing external debt at 40.1% of \nGDP in FY2021, well below the government\u2019s ceiling of 50.0%. However, government spending \nincreased in FY2021 and is projected to expand further in FY2022 as health-related expenditures \nramp up and a recovery package to support productive sectors and vulnerable populations is \ndisbursed.  Revenues  fell  in  FY2021  and  only  a  modest  recovery  is  forecast  in  FY2022. \nConsequently, Tonga had fiscal deficits estimated at 1.0% of GDP in FY2021 and projected at \n1.6% of GDP in FY2022. The risk of debt distress is rated high; this does not indicate that the \ndebt position has deteriorated, but mostly reflects the potential effects of future disasters on fiscal \nand debt dynamics.10 \n \n7.  Overall, ADB assesses that the macroeconomic outlook is stable and debt is sustainable. \nEconomic growth is expected to revive in FY2022, supported by stimulus expenditures and \npolicies.11 The government is committed to improving expenditure composition and efficiency and \nshoring up revenues. Fiscal deficits are projected until FY2024 but will remain at manageable \nlevels that can be financed through government\u2019s cash reserves, concessional borrowing from \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF), and continued support from development partners for the \ngovernment\u2019s reforms. Starting in FY2022, public debt is projected to decline from the FY2021 \npeak of 46.3% of GDP. External debt will also decline from FY2022 in line with the government\u2019s \nMedium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) and remain below 40% of GDP as recommended by the \nIMF. This is consistent with the IMF\u2019s assessment that the government\u2019s policy agenda broadly \nsupports priorities for achieving higher budget surpluses to stabilize debt dynamics and achieve \n \n6   ADB. 2021.

Manila. \n7   While data on employment impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are not available, an estimated 43% of salaried \nworkers in Tonga depend on the private sector for their livelihoods and could potentially have been affected. \n8   As of 13 September 2021, 44% of Tonga\u2019s population had received their first dose, and 26% had received both doses \nof COVID-19 vaccination.

However, debt remains sustainable. \n11 Agriculture, construction, and tourism (which contributed about 15% of GDP pre-pandemic) are expected to recover \nin FY2022. \n ", "3 \n \ndevelopment goals.12 However, downside risks from the continuation of the COVID-19 crisis \nremain high. \n \n8.  Key constraints. The government recognizes that an inclusive economic recovery and \nsubsequent acceleration of economic growth are constrained by several interrelated factors, \nincluding (i) limited fiscal space for sustaining growth and poverty reduction, (ii) a weak enabling \nenvironment for the private sector, and (iii) inefficient management of Tonga\u2019s human resources. \n \n9.  Limited fiscal space. Rising expenditure requirements in the face of limited revenue \ngrowth mean that recovery efforts must be underpinned by strong fiscal management. Specific \nattention to managing public debt is particularly important with the government projecting fiscal \ndeficits until FY2024. As of June 2021, debt remains low-cost and manageable. However, debt \nrepayments are expected to spike starting in FY2024, and most of these will need to be refinanced \nwith new borrowing. Further, more than 85% of debt is denominated in foreign currency and is \nexposed to exchange rate risks. While domestic debt is less than 15% of total public debt, the \naverage term to maturity is low (2.6 years) and the small size of the domestic market means that \nrefinancing risk is high. The government must also better manage government guarantees, \nestimated at about 4% of GDP. While contingent liabilities enable projects to be financed without \nincurring immediate public debt, they create fiscal risks and could increase debt if they are called. \nGuarantees also introduce moral hazard risks because they reduce the private sector\u2019s incentives \nto scrutinize the viability of projects, increasing chances that they may in fact be called.13 \nHowever, there are no clear criteria for cabinet approval of guarantees and the framework for \nmanaging them was weak. \n \n10.  Efforts to maintain critical public expenditures are hampered by a growing public sector \nwage bill. After declining from 12.7% of GDP in FY2017 to 11.6% in FY2019, the total wage bill \nfor public sector employees is estimated to have gone up to 14.0% of GDP in FY2021 (footnote \n9). While the government has instituted strict controls on recruitment, implementation is weakened \nbecause of incomplete and inconsistent employment registers. There is a significant disparity\u2014\nabout 9.1% of the workforce\u2014between the Public Service Commission (PSC) establishment list \nand the list that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has in their budgeting and payroll system. The \nabsence of a link between the two lists has allowed people in positions formally unapproved by \nthe PSC to draw a salary. Another issue is that overtime payments grew substantially in FY2021.14 \nAs of 2021, overtime is payable to all staff below the level of chief executive officer, on the \napproval of the chief executive officer, with no limits on accrual. Many staff claim more than 4 \nhours overtime each day of the work year, making this not just a fiscal problem but also an \noccupational health and safety issue. \n \n11.  Public financial management (PFM) systems are generally functional and support basic \nservice delivery. A gender-responsive public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) \nassessment, however, identified several areas for improvement.15 Many of these relate to budget \nreliability,  public  availability  of  fiscal  information,  and  audits  (footnote  9).  The  government \nproduces an annual medium-term fiscal framework to improve policy-based fiscal strategy and \nbudgeting.  However,  budget  proposals,  budget  execution  reports,  audit  reports,  and \nmacroeconomic  forecasts  are  not  publicly  released,  constraining  fiscal  transparency.  The \n \n12 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the linked documents in Appendix 2). Based on the \nIMF assessment, long-term debt sustainability hinges on continued donor support in the form of grants, debt relief to \nfinance substantial fiscal and external gaps, and sizeable fiscal adjustment. \n13 ADB.

Washington, DC. \n ", "4 \n \nassessment also highlighted the need for gender-responsive budgeting training for ministries and \nthe collection of sex-disaggregated data in ministry annual reporting. \n \n12.  Weak enabling environment for the private sector. The expansion of the private sector \nwill be important to accelerate economic growth and create new jobs. A stronger private sector \nwill also help to broaden the tax base and increase fiscal resilience. A key constraint facing \nbusinesses in Tonga is access to finance, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.16 \nDeveloping nonbank financial institutions that complement the formal banking sector could help. \nHowever, this would require improved supervision of nonbank financial institutions to control \ngrowing risks to financial sector stability, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.17 As of 2021, \ncredit unions, the main nonbank financial intermediaries, are outside the purview of the National \nReserve Bank. A more conducive business climate for foreign and domestic investments will also \nhelp  private  sector  growth.  However,  Tonga  lacked  an  international  arbitration  legislative \nframework, which discouraged foreign investment by raising the costs and uncertainty associated \nwith international business agreements.18 Despite recent streamlining of registration process, \nburdensome regulations for foreign investment continue to deter investors. \n \n13.  A  reliable,  sustainable,  and  affordable  supply  of  energy  is  important  for  recovery. \nReliability of energy supply and cost and transparency of tariffs are constraints for businesses \n(footnote 16). More than 91% of Tonga\u2019s grid-connected electricity demand is supplied by \ngenerators fueled by imported diesel. Petroleum dependency makes Tonga vulnerable to oil price \nchanges, and high system losses raise costs.19 There is a need for a vision for the energy sector \nand strategic planning and coordination among agencies to mitigate the difficulties Tonga faces \nbecause of its location. However, the energy sector lacks a coherent institutional and regulatory \nframework, with multiple legislations governing renewables, gas, petroleum, and electricity.20 \n \n14.  Inefficient  management  of  human  resources.  Because  of  the  small  labor  force, \nimproving the supply of skilled workers is critical to support growth. This will require stronger \nfemale labor force participation, which is constrained by sexual harassment in the workplace. \nThere is no specific policy to address this, even in the public sector where 42% of employees are \nwomen.21 Another important channel for generating employment and helping workers acquire \nskills is circular migration. Strategic labor supply management and  targeted marketing are \nimportant to increase opportunities while minimizing negative social impact from migration. \nHowever,  there  are  weaknesses  in  recruiting  potential  migrant  workers,  providing  them \nappropriate pre-departure training and skills, and facilitating migration. The government also lacks \nclear gender-balanced selection procedures that would allow women to take full advantage of \nopportunities abroad. ADB\u2019s 2020 budget support program supported cabinet approval of a Labor \nMobility Policy for managing low-skilled and semiskilled labor flows abroad.22 It also supported \ncabinet approval of a complementary technical and vocational education and training sector \n \n16 Private Sector Development Initiative. 2020.

Alignment with national and ADB strategy. The proposed program aligns with the \nTonga Strategic Development Framework, 2015\u20132025 that has adopted a vision for \u201ca more \nprogressive Tonga supporting a higher quality of life for all.\u201d24 This vision is translated into five \npillars, of which \u201ceconomic institutions\u201d seek to address constraints to more inclusive, sustainable, \nand resilient economic growth, including through improved macroeconomic management and \nincreased access to economic opportunities. The government has also moved to mitigate the \nmacroeconomic and social risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 priorities of strengthening governance and institutional capacity and \naccelerating progress in gender equality.25 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach for 12 \nsmall Pacific island countries, 2021\u20132025 that seeks to support developing member economies \nin preparing for and responding to shocks and promoting inclusive private sector growth.26 \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n16.  Program description. The program supports Tonga\u2019s ongoing reforms, as reflected in \nthe Joint Policy Reform Matrix (JPRM) framework (para. 26), to restore and accelerate inclusive \neconomic growth led by the private sector, which has been impacted by COVID-19. The program \ncomprises 10 prior policy actions under three reform areas. Specific policy actions are prioritized \nbased on government needs and build on reforms supported under previous programs while \nresponding to policy challenges intensified by COVID-19.27 All policy actions under the program \nhave been completed. \n \n17.  Reform area 1: Fiscal management. The government recognizes that strategic public \ndebt management, sound expenditure controls, and strong PFM systems that promote fiscal \ndiscipline will provide macroeconomic stability and enable private sector growth. As prior policy \nactions under the program, the cabinet approved and the MOF commenced implementation of  \n(i) an MTDS to guide borrowing and public debt management during 2021\u20132025, including rules \nfor no new non-concessional external borrowing; and (ii) a new Government Guarantee Policy to \ncontain contingent liabilities by providing a framework for and transparency in procedures for \nguaranteeing loans. The cabinet also (i) established and operationalized a consolidated and sex-\ndisaggregated  employment  registry  to  strengthen  controls  on  the  public  sector  wage  bill;  \n(ii) approved amending the government\u2019s overtime policy to control, monitor, and limit the cost of \novertime payments to public servants; and (iii) approved a rolling time-bound PFM action plan, \nwhich is now under implementation by the MOF, as part of Tonga\u2019s overall PFM reform program.  \n \n18.  The MTDS commits the government to not taking on any new non-concessional external \nborrowing, and  building  reserves along  the whole  strategy  period to  finance external  debt \n \n23 Government of Tonga. 2019. National Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Policy Framework. \nNuku\u2019alofa. Implementation requires revamping the Tonga National Quality Assessment Board and providing it with \nthe legal basis to carry out its core mandate. The board is responsible for developing a national qualifications \nframework, establishing appropriate policies, monitoring and reviewing compulsory education and training, and \nregistering and providing accreditation to providers. \n24 Government of Tonga. 2015.

The  Government \nGuarantee Policy lays down minimum criteria, additional guidelines, and information requirements \nthat will be used to evaluate a request for a government guarantee; the fees it will charge and \nother obligations it may impose on the borrower; and guidelines for public disclosure. It makes \nclear that the approval of any guarantee by the cabinet will be based on the soundness of \ngovernment finances, including projected debt sustainability. It is under implementation, with all \nnew government guarantees to be approved based on the policy. Both documents have been \npublicly disclosed as part of the prior actions to increase fiscal transparency. \n \n19.  Two of the prior actions in this reform area are intended to improve expenditure control. \nUnifying the PSC and the MOF lists into one employment register as a real time database of \napproved roles with approved salary band levels, and identifying who is filling the position and \nlinking this with the payroll system, is critical to controlling the size of the government workforce. \nIn addition, collection of sex-disaggregated data through the employment registry will allow for \nthe  analysis  of  gender  statistics  relating  to  public  sector  employment.  To  ensure  that  the \nemployment register is maintained and kept up-to-date on a regular basis, the PSC is required to \nprovide the cabinet with annual updates. The cabinet also approved amending the government\u2019s \novertime policy, with the PSC and the MOF working out caps on overtime hours. Limiting overtime \naccrual is important to limit wage bill growth and aligned with good practice across the world. An \novertime cap at 20 hours per fortnight per worker, and setting up two levels of control to monitor \novertime payments\u2014at the line ministry and at the MOF levels\u2014is proposed for implementation \nin  a  phased  manner.  Setting  a  limit  on  overtime  per  worker  each  fortnight,  along  with \noperationalizing the unified employment register, will save the government an estimated 0.5% of \nGDP. \n \n20.  Finally, a gender-responsive PFM action plan received cabinet approval and is being \nimplemented. It is a live document, developed on a rolling basis, with the initial set of actions to \nbe implemented during 2021\u20132023.30 The plan prioritizes necessary measures under each pillar \nand  identifies  key  tasks,  responsible  officers,  timelines,  capacity  development  needs,  and \nestimated costs. Capacity building of budget officers is ongoing, macro-fiscal models have been \nstrengthened, and publication and disclosure of fiscal information has improved. Work has also \nbegun on reviewing the existing PFM Act with a view to amending it by late 2022 to modernize \nPFM.31 A PFM advisor has been appointed in the MOF to oversee implementation, and a steering \ncommittee  has  been  set  up  to  monitor  progress  on  a  quarterly  basis. 32 Steps  towards \nimplementing gender-responsive budgeting have also begun.33\n \n21.  Reform area 2: Business environment for the private sector. The government is \n \n28  These two constitute policy actions under the Sustainable Development Finance Policy adopted by ADB. \n29  The benchmarks are the share of public debt in foreign currency and the average time to maturity of domestic debt. \n30 The main pillars of the plan include strengthening (i) budget reliability, (ii) transparency of public finances, (iii) \nmanagement of assets and liabilities including public debt management and reporting, (iv) policy-based fiscal \nstrategy and budgeting, (v) predictability and control in budget execution, (vi) accounting and reporting, (vii) external \nscrutiny and audit and (viii) strengthening the enabling environment including through updating the existing PFM Act. \n31 Government of Tonga.

The program supported the preparation of three key legislative reforms \nthat will support private sector growth: \n(i)  The Parliament passed the Credit Unions Bill, 2021 to register, license, supervise, \nand regulate nonbank financial institutions by bringing them under the purview of \nthe National Reserve Bank. This will support efforts to enhance financial inclusion \nand  access  to  finance  for  the  private  sector  by  developing  credit  unions  to \nencourage savings and promote lending, especially in rural and remote islands \nwithout banks. This will also help better monitor financial sector vulnerabilities, \nwhich may be exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic impacts. \n(ii)  The Parliament passed the International Arbitration Act, 2020. The act will facilitate \nfair and timely resolution of commercial disputes through transparent arbitration \nprocesses, provide recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards, and bring \nTonga in accord with the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and \nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958). \n(iii)  The Parliament passed the Energy Bill, 2021 that will provide an institutional, \nregulatory, and policy framework for the Tonga energy sector, including electricity, \npetroleum, gas, renewable energy, and other energy sources. The bill envisages \nthe creation of a new ministry of energy to provide policy direction for the entire \nsector, a new energy commission responsible for regulating price and non-price \nelements  (health,  safety,  and  environment),  and  a  department  of  energy \nresponsible for implementing and enforcing the bill\u2019s provisions. It clarifies the roles \nand responsibilities of key stakeholders and seeks to facilitate more private sector \ninvestment  in  Tonga\u2019s  electricity  sector  by  providing  suitable  investment \nincentives. It also includes explicit provisions to ensure women\u2019s participation in \nenergy policy and decision-making. \n \n22.  Reform area 3: Human resource management. As a prior action, the cabinet approved \na sexual harassment policy to address sexual harassment in government offices. The policy \ndefines sexual harassment, sets out procedures for addressing complaints, and describes the \nroles and responsibilities of stakeholders. The policy is a first for the public service in Tonga, and \naligns with requirements under the Employment Relations Act, 2020 that specifically calls for \npolicies to eliminate sexual harassment at the workplace.34 It is under implementation, with all \nnew sexual harassment cases to be handled following the provisions in the policy. As a prior \naction, the government also adopted a new gender-sensitive labor mobility operations manual to \nenhance  management  and  core  services  of  Tonga\u2019s  Labor  Sending  Unit,  required  to \noperationalize  the  Tonga  Labor  Mobility  Policy  (para.  14). 35 The  Labor  Sending  Unit  is \nimplementing the operations manual. As part of the prior action, a steering committee was \nestablished  and  operationalized  to  provide  high-level  leadership  and  oversight  to  the \nimplementation of the Labor Mobility Policy; the committee is chaired by the Minister for Internal \nAffairs and co-chaired by the Minister for Trade and Economic Development.  \n \n23.  Post-program  partnership  framework.  ADB\u2019s  long  engagement  with  Tonga  has \ndeveloped strong relationships and government ownership of reforms. Regular dialogue helped \n \n34 Government of Tonga. 2020. Employment Relations Bill 2020. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n35 The Labor Sending Unit oversees operational procedures to guide immigration. The Labor Mobility Policy is being \noperationalized through implementation of the operations manual, which includes processes to cover the full course \nof labor mobility, including reformed procedures for recruitment and selection, pre-departure training, and the \nestablishment of work-ready pools, with a special focus on increasing female participation in work-ready pools. It \nalso strengthens data management processes and systems to better inform policy decisions, optimize operations, \nand reduce costs. \n ", "8 \n \nto institutionalize reforms and provided an opportunity to build on them. To further ensure \nsustainability and desired medium-term impacts from actions initiated under the program, ADB \nhas developed a post-program partnership framework with the government. Under reform area 1, \nthe government commits to following its MTDS and regular tracking of monitorable indicators \nidentified in it. The government will sustain the operations of the consolidated employment register \nso that there is a single source of information about approved roles across the public service. \nThe limits of 20 hours per fortnight per worker on overtime hours claimed will be implemented by \nthe PSC, based on the cabinet approval under the program. The government will regularly monitor \nimplementation of the PFM action plan, and update and extend it as needed. It will also seek TA \nsupport and commence implementation of gender-responsive budgeting training for ministries. \nThe government will review tax exemptions to assess viability of removing them to shore up \nrevenue mobilization. Under reform area 2, the government agrees to set up and capacitate the \nenergy commission to regulate energy price and quality, following the enactment of the Energy \nBill, 2021. The government will also further simplify foreign investment regulations to align with \nthe  Foreign  Investment  Act,  2020.36 Under  reform  area  3,  the  post-program  partnership \nframework will evaluate implementation of the sexual harassment policy, including awareness-\nraising sessions and training, and continue improving the technical and vocational education \nsystem.  The  government  will  continue  efforts  to  strengthen  the  Tonga  National  Quality \nAssessment Board, including through providing a legal basis for its operation. ADB and partners \nwill continue close policy dialogue with the government and support its reform efforts through TA \nas necessary. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The program builds on reforms supported by earlier ADB TA and \nprograms (footnotes 1 and 27). On fiscal management, past engagement improved civil service \nperformance management to control the wage bill; introduced a new debt management law and \nmedium-term  fiscal  targets;  and  strengthened  PFM,  including  by  conducting  a  PEFA  in \npartnership with the IMF to identify priorities in future PFM reform planning. ADB TA mobilized \neconomic and PFM advisors to help formulate development strategies.37 On private sector \ndevelopment, ADB\u2019s advisory services helped strengthen corporate governance practices and \ncommercialize selected state-owned enterprises to improve service delivery and reduce the \nburden on the budget.38 They built the foundations for an enabling environment for foreign direct \ninvestment by supporting the approval of the Foreign Investment Act, 2020 and helping develop \nregulations to implement it.39 Earlier programs also built the foundations for energy sector reform \nand improved regulatory practices. On human resources, ADB\u2019s previous policy-based grant \nhelped develop a gender-sensitive labor mobility framework and improve the technical and \nvocational education and training sector. Specifically for the program, ADB TA helped develop \neconomic  and  fiscal  forecasting  and  planning  models  that  supported  MTDS  preparation.40 \nTA support has been provided for developing the International Arbitration Act, 2020. The program \ncomplements ADB\u2019s support to Tonga\u2019s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.41 \n \n25.  Lessons. This program reflects lessons from previous policy-based operations, including \n \n36 Government of Tonga. 2020. Foreign Investment Act 2020. Nuku\u2019alofa \n37 ADB. 2013.

In May 2021, \nADB provided a $5.5 million grant to Tonga to help roll out COVID-19 vaccines. ADB.

Regional: Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 2). \n ", "9 \n \n(i) budget support can achieve results if there is strong government ownership; (ii) coordination \nwith development partners is critical, especially in sectors where ADB has limited engagement; \n(iii) TA, provided in parallel to budget support programs, aids the implementation of reform; \n(iv) flexibility helps ensure that policy actions remain relevant, especially with upcoming elections \nand continuance of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can lead to changing reform \nareas and uncertainty; and (v) limiting reforms to a few substantive actions avoids overloading \nnational capacity.42 Based on these lessons, the program focuses on policy actions prioritized by \nthe government to avoid overloading limited capacity, builds on earlier reforms for sustainability, \nand accommodates political economy considerations in its design. \n \n26.  Development partner coordination. The JPRM forms the basis for reforms supported \nunder the program, and the process provides an effective platform to coordinate support among \nkey development partners.43 ADB, the World Bank, and the governments of Australia and New \nZealand coordinate budget support and related TA through the JPRM process, with the European \nUnion also participating.44 ADB has worked with partners through the JPRM process since 2011, \nand this has helped design policy actions and TA based on government priorities. Similar to past \nprograms, the JPRM process brought together key ministries and development partners to map \nout critical constraints, design specific policy actions and TA measures, and monitor reform \nimplementation for the program. ADB holds discussions on policy issues and macroeconomic \nprojections with the IMF during their annual Article IV consultations and discussed the reform \nprogram with the IMF. The IMF provided an assessment letter for the program (footnote 12). \n \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n27.  The program is aligned with the following overarching development objective: a more \nprogressive  Tonga  supporting  a  higher  quality  of  life  for  all  (footnote  24).  The  expected \ndevelopment outcome is to restore and accelerate inclusive private sector-led economic growth \nin Tonga. Supported by program reforms, it is expected that Tonga will not take on any new non-\nconcessional  debt,  the  public  sector  wage  bill  will  come  down,  and  PFM  systems  will  be \nstrengthened, all of which will improve fiscal sustainability for better development outcomes. \nFurther, the frameworks for the energy sector and for arbitration of international commercial \ndisputes are expected to be improved, the supervision of nonbank financial institutions to be \nenhanced, and the number of workers in work-ready pools to increase. These measures will help \nensure better access to finance, higher skill levels for workers, and a better business environment, \nwhich are expected to spur private sector-led growth.45 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n28.  Tonga\u2019s  economy  is  strongly  impacted  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  In  FY2022, \ngovernment expenditures are expected to go up to 51.0% of GDP because of continued efforts \nto build health preparedness, support key economic sectors, and increase capital spending. \nDomestic revenues are expected to be 24.0% of GDP, resulting in a fiscal deficit (excluding \n \n42 Independent Evaluation Department. 2015.

The JPRM process brings \ntogether key development partners and government counterparts to define a medium-term program of reform actions \nin line with government priorities. Development partners align their own policy-based budget support programs with \nthe JPRM, with each partner disbursing against completion of selected reforms laid out in the overall JPRM. \n44 The European Union coordinates TA and policy dialogue through the JPRM process, but not its budget support. \n45 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \ngrants) of 27.0% of GDP (Table 1). This is equivalent to development financing needs of about \n$130.5 million for FY2022. The government expects to finance this through mobilization of \nexternal grants, a possible concessional loan from the IMF Rapid Credit Facility, and domestic \nborrowing. ADB\u2019s budget support through the program is expected to help meet Tonga\u2019s FY2022 \ndevelopment financing needs. General budget support grants of $23.4 million from other JPRM \npartners are planned for calendar year 2021: World Bank expects to disburse $5.0 million, while \nthe government of Australia has provided $10.8 million equivalent and the government of New \nZealand $7.6 million equivalent in June 2021.46 \n \nTable 1: Development Financing Needs, FY2021\u2013FY2022 \n  FY2021e  FY2022p \nItem  $ million  % of GDP  $ million  % of GDP \nRevenues (tax and non-tax)  106.9  23.1  115.8  24.0 \nTotal expenditure  200.4  43.3  246.3  51.0 \nFiscal deficit (excluding grants)  (93.5)  (20.2)  (130.5)  (27.0) \nExternal grants  88.8  19.2  122.7  25.4 \n      Of which ADB policy-based grant  12.2  2.6  5.0  1.1 \nNet lending (borrowing requirement  (4.7)  (1.0)  (7.9)  (1.6) \nNet change in reserves (drawdown)  2.0  0.4  (2.3)  (0.5) \nNet acquisition of financial liabilities  6.5  1.4  5.5  1.1 \n      Domestic borrowing  0.0  0.0  0.4  0.1 \n      External borrowing  6.5  1.4  5.2  1.1 \n( ) = negative, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projected. \nSources: Government of Tonga Budget Statement for year ending 30 June 2022; and Asian Development Bank \nestimates. \n \n29.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $5 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the program. ADB grant proceeds \nwill support development financing needs, excluding ineligible items. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The government\u2019s budget support management committee leads the JPRM process, with \nthe MOF as the executing agency. The committee is responsible for providing overall guidance \nand for coordinating program implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The MOF, Ministry of \nInternal Affairs, the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development, and the PSC are implementing \nagencies for the program actions. JPRM partners\u2019 forums are held twice a year, allow all major \npartners  to  discuss  the  government\u2019s  reform  priorities  and  coordinate  assistance.  This  is \ncomplemented  by  bilateral  consultations  and  cross-partner  dialogue.  The  government  also \nconsults with the private sector and civil society on individual reform initiatives as needed. ADB \nis consulting with the government and other partners on the possibility of hiring an independent \nagency to monitor reform progress. The program is implemented from July 2020 to September \n2021. ADB will monitor the implementation of reforms under the  post-program partnership \nframework. The proceeds of the policy-based grant will be withdrawn, upon effectiveness, in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n \n46  JPRM support from Australia and New Zealand has been accounted in FY2021. The World Bank expects to disburse \nits JPRM grants in November 2021 through the proposed Resilience Development Policy Operation, subprogram 2. \nDevelopment partners support overlapping sets of policy actions within the overall JPRM, for disbursement of their \nrespective budget support funds. Amounts are converted to dollar equivalent using exchange rate as of 10 May 2021. \n ", "11 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n31.  Governance. Despite capacity limitations, the 2020 PEFA assessment indicated that \nTonga\u2019s PFM system is generally functional and supports basic service delivery. The government \ncan implement its budget, but there are some accounting, financial reporting, and auditing \nweaknesses (footnote 9). The main issues relate to budget reliability with variances in aggregate \nexpenditure and revenue relative to the budget. Public availability of fiscal information was also \nidentified as an issue.47 Reform area 1 of this program, complemented by development partner \nTA, will address some of these weaknesses. The World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators \nrank Tonga in the 41.8th percentile on control of corruption in 2019.48 Tonga has taken steps to \nstrengthen anticorruption measures, including creating the Parliament Standing Committee on \nAnti-Corruption and acceding to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. \n \n32.  Poverty and social. The public sector is a key provider of services to low-income \nhouseholds, and reform area 1 will help ensure that the government has the fiscal resources to \nrespond to future economic shocks and disasters (which disproportionately affect the poor) while \nmaintaining critical public services. Reform area 2 will aim to enhance private sector investments, \nwhich should create more employment opportunities, including for the poor. Reform area 3 will \ncreate opportunities for women to participate more actively in the work force and increase poor \nhouseholds\u2019 access to overseas employment opportunities and the associated remitted income. \n \n33.  Gender. This program is classified some gender elements and includes proactive policy \nactions that directly address key gender gaps, particularly in supporting women\u2019s economic \nempowerment and addressing GBV. The key action is the adoption of a groundbreaking public \nservice sexual harassment policy that not only provides mechanisms to respond to work-based \nsexual harassment and abuse, but also sets an important normative standard for respectful and \nsafe workplaces in Tonga. Besides addressing a significant form of GBV, the policy also tackles \na key barrier to women\u2019s employment and economic empowerment. ADB TA is helping implement \nthe sexual harassment policy.49 Significant gender mainstreaming in overseas labor opportunities \nis another key action.50 In FY2016, only one in 10 workers in the overseas employment program \nwas a woman. In addition, establishing more gender-balanced work-ready pools will support new \nopportunities  for  Tongan  women.  Other  actions  include  establishing  a  sex-disaggregated \nemployment register and payroll that will allow collection and analysis of gender data and statistics \nfor public sector employment and gender mainstreaming in the Energy Bill, 2021.51 \n \n34.  Safeguards.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  this  program  is \nclassified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. The prior policy actions have \nbeen assessed and are not expected to result in or lead to involuntary resettlement, or negatively \naffect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \n \n47 Although budget documents are tabled in Parliament, these are generally not uploaded to a government website \nuntil sometime after the budget has been approved, making access difficult. \n48 World Bank.

While we \nare fortunate to have remained COVID-19 free hitherto, the virus continues to have a \nprofound impact on our economy and society. We have recorded negative growth rates \nfor the last two fiscal years FY2020 and FY2021. This comes even as we were still \nrecovering from the devastating effects of Tropical Cyclone Gita in 2018, Cyclone Tino \nin  January  2020  and  Cyclone  Harold  in  April  2020  that  caused  damage  to  key \ninfrastructure and livelihoods and highlighted our vulnerability to disasters caused by \nnatural hazards. \nGovernment has and will continue to prioritize prevention and protection against the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, as the first and foremost priority considering the context of the \nTongan economy including vulnerability and limited resources. It is encouraging to note \nthe availability  of vaccines  against COVID-19  which  are  being  rolled  out  rapidly  in \nTonga  and  across  the  world.  This  will  be  critical  to  our  recovery.  I  would  like  to \nacknowledge  our  appreciation  to  Asian Development Bank  (ADB)  for  their  support \ntowards this effort, through the fast disbursal of grants from the Asia Pacific Disaster \nResilience fund and the Pacific Disaster Resilience program. We also acknowledge the \nbudget  support  ADB  extended  to  us  in  FY2021  through  the  Strengthening \nMacroeconomic Resilience Program. \nWe are also guided by the Tonga Strategic Development Framework 2015-2025, that \nespouses a vision for \"a more progressive Tonga supporting a higher quality of life for \nall.\" Government recognizes that addressing constraints to more inclusive, sustainable, \nand resilient economic growth will be key to achieving this objective.  We have been \nimplementing  an  ambitious  reform  program  over  the  past  decade  that  has  helped \nstrengthened our public financial management systems, increased tax collections, and \nimproved public enterprise performance. Our debt position has stabilized, allocation of \npublic resources is more strategic, and their use more efficient. Efforts to improve the \npolicy and regulatory environment for the private sector have also led to substantial \nimprovements in the ease of doing business. ", "Appendix 3  19 \nWe are encouraged by the strong support from the ADB and our development partners \nto  continue  these  reform  efforts.  Since  2011,  the  government  and  development \npartners have been working together through the Joint Policy Reform Matrix process to \nprioritize, implement and monitor reforms that are critical for Tonga's sustainable and \ninclusive  development.  Closely  aligned  to  the  priorities  of  the  Tonga  Strategic \nDevelopment Framework,  the Joint Policy Reform Matrix aims to strengthen Tonga's \nfiscal management and promote private-sector led growth. This will not only assist us in \nthe current crisis but establish stronger systems to manage future risks. \nHowever,  the  ongoing  coronavirus  pandemic  threatens  to  reverse  our  hard-fought \npoverty  alleviation  and  development  gains.  All  our  key  economic  sectors  including \nagriculture, fisheries and tourism have seen significant drops in growth.  Government's \nfiscal  policy  is  fundamental  in  managing  available  limited  resources,  supporting \ndevelopment activities and growth, upholding the quality of the public service deliveries, \nand sustaining conducing environment for the private sector to grow. \nIn  FY2021,  government  prioritized  health  expenditures  to  support  preparedness  in \nrelation to COVID-19. It also implemented the Economic and Social Stimulus Package \nto  protect  vulnerable  social  segments  and  productive  sectors  of  the  economy. \nAdditionally, government granted financial support towards key sectors' recovery plans \nincluding  public  roads  maintenance  and  key  transport  infrastructures.  Government \nBudgets FY2022-FY2024 will similarly continue to build on current efforts to support \nmedium-term economic recovery, rejuvenate private sector activity, protect and create \njobs,  and maintain overall macro-fiscal sustainability.  At the same time,  government \nrevenue  streams  declined  in  FY2021  and  are  expected  to  only  recover  slowly  as \nbusinesses and economic activity recover.  Consequently, after many years of running \nbudget surpluses, government forecasts running budget deficits till FY2024. \nA stand-alone policy-based grant requested for the current year's budget support would \nhelp the government provide fiscal resources to help Tonga restore inclusive growth led \nby the private sector, which has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nWe recognize that with fiscal deficits projected over the next few years, attention must \nbe paid managing public debt.  Debt currently remains low cost and at manageable \nlevels, however our limited access to debt markets and the small size of the economy, \nmean  that  managing  debt  through  proper  planning  is  imperative.  Government \nconsequently started implementation of a medium-term debt strategy. This commits us \nto keep debt low cost by not taking on any debt except on extremely concessional \nterms  and  to  build  reserves  to  finance  upcoming  external  debt  repayments.  The \nsituation will remain fluid in the medium term,  so we will be regularly monitoring its \nsustainability and risk against monitorable indicators. To complement this, we are also \nimplementing a new  government  guarantee  policy  consistent with international good \npractice,  that provides transparency by clarifying government guidelines for providing \nguarantees;  the fees we will charge and for  public  disclosure of all guarantees  we \nprovide. All future approvals will also take account of projected debt sustainability. \nGovernment  is  committed  to  improving  expenditure  composition  so  that  scarce \nresources can be used towards our development priorities. A critical element of this is \ncontrolling  the  public  wage  bill.  Government  undertook  a  study  to  understand  the \ncauses behind this and possible remedies. We have now taken steps to implement its \nrecommendations. One important part of this is re-establishing a unified employment \nregister between the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service Commission which was \nnot being maintained. Government has operationalized a unified register, and directed \nthe Public Service Commission to provide an annual update to Cabinet on the status of ", "20  Appendix 3 \nthe register to ensure its sustainability. This measure will help us eliminate roles that \nhave not been approved,  and stop unapproved growth in positions.  Cabinet has also \napproved  amending  the  government's  overtime  policy  to  control  excess  growth  in \novertime payments. This is aligned with good practice across the world. \nTonga has made significant gains in public finance management (PFM) over the past \ndecade however, challenges remain.  In January 2020, the Ministry of Finance, together \nwith the International Monetary Fund,  approved and published the Public Expenditure \nand Financial  Assessment Agile and  Gender  Responsive  Budgeting  Assessment to \nidentify  priorities for  the  government  PFM  roadmap  improvements.  Subsequently  a \nPFM reform strategy was developed through a consultative approach and government \nis now implementing a PFM action plan to address weaknesses. Necessary measures \nand  expected  outcomes  under  each  pillar  have  been  prioritized,  and  key  tasks, \nresponsible  officers,  timelines,  capacity  development  needs  and  estimated  costs \nidentified. To ensure time-bound implementation, a steering committee has been set up \nunder my chairmanship to monitor progress on a regular basis. \nAn important pillar of our recovery program is to improve the business and investment \nclimate and stimulate new private investment. Government has submitted to Parliament \nfor  its  enactment,  a  Credit  Unions  Bill  to  regulate  nonbank  financial  institutions  by \nbringing them under the purview of the National Reserve Bank. This will support efforts \nto  enhance  financial  inclusion  and  access  to  finance for  the  private  sector  through \ndevelopment of Credit Unions, especially in rural and remote islands where there are \nno banks. It will also help better monitoring of financial sector vulnerabilities, as strongly \nrecommended by the International Monetary Fund. \nParliament  recently  approved  the  International  Arbitration  Act  2020.  The  Act  will \nfacilitate fair and timely resolution of  disputes through arbitration and bring Tonga in \naccord  with  the  United  Nation  Convention  on  the  Recognition  and  Enforcement  of \nForeign  Arbitral  Awards  (1958).  We  recognize  the  support  provided  by  ADB  in \ndeveloping this piece of legislation. \nGovernment also submitted for Parliament's enactment, an Energy Bill that will provide \nan institutional,  regulatory and policy framework for the Tonga's energy sector.  Key \nfeatures of the bill are aligned with global best practice and are intended to support \nenergy  resilience,  affordability,  access,  reliability,  and  sustainability  and  create  new \nopportunities for the private sector. A new Ministry for Energy will be set up to focus \nattention on this important sector. \nFinally, our human resources are limited, and we must utilize them optimally to sustain \ngrowth.  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  supporting  more  women  into \nentering the workforce. We also understand that gender-based violence could be a key \ndeterrent.  To address this, government has approved a sexual harassment policy to \naddress sexual harassment in government offices,  a first for the country.  The policy \ndefines  sexual  harassment,  sets  out  procedures  for  addressing  complaints  and \ndescribes the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders. In the coming months, we will \nalso be conducting training and launching an awareness raising campaign to ensure \nthe greatest benefit from this initiative. \nWe  also  want  to  take  better  advantage  of  the  opportunities  that  seasonal  worker \nschemes in Australia and  New Zealand offer us. Through support from the previous \nADB  program,  government  adopted  a  Labor  Mobility  Policy.  We  have  now  started \nimplementation  of  the  policy  through  operationalizing  a  Labor  Mobility  Steering \nCommittee to provide high level leadership and oversight. The committee is chaired by ", "Appendix 3  21 \nthe Ministry of Internal Affairs and co-chaired by the Ministry of Trade and Economic \nDevelopment,  and  brings  together  relevant  stakeholders.  On  the  advice  of  the \ncommittee, government also adopted a new gender sensitive Labor Mobility Operations \nManual  to  enhance  management  and  core  services  of  Tonga's  labor  mobility \ninstitutions.  The operations manual includes processes that covers the full course of \nlabor  mobility  including  reformed  procedures  for  recruitment  and  selection,  pre\u00ad\ndeparture training, and the establishment of work-ready pools, with a special focus on \nincreasing female participation in work-ready pools. \nThe government is firmly committed to implementing this program to support Tonga's \neconomic recovery efforts. We look forward to working closely with ADB and continue \nactive  engagement  with  other  partners  to  assist  Tonga's  rapid  recovery  from  the \neconomic difficulties of the coronavirus pandemic,  and to promote further reforms to \nachieve longer-term growth. We also would be happy to continue our partnership with \nthe ADB beyond the program to enhance and sustain our reform efforts. \nYours sincerely, \navem \nr Finance "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20211014182147+12'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "tonga, fiscal resilience, sustainable development, inclusive growth, public debt management, poverty reduction, pandemic, 55016-001, grant 0807, adb projects, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20211108135532+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.53.3", "Subject": "The program will help Tonga restore and accelerate inclusive growth, which has been adversely affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
