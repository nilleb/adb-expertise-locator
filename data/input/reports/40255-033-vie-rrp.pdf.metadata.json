THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia, \nboth to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Mekong Delta Region Connectivity \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve connectivity in the Mekong Delta Region and provide efficient \naccess from Ho Chi Minh City to the Southern Coastal Region through construction of a section \nof  the  Second  Southern  Highway  (SSH)  comprising  two  cable-stayed  bridges  across  the \nMekong River, one at Cao Lanh and the other at Vam Cong, and associated roads. \n \n3.  The  project  is  located  on  the  boundaries  of  An  Giang,  Can  Tho,  and  Dong  Thap \nprovinces to the west of the Mekong Delta Region. The bridges will be constructed to six-lane \ncarriageway standard, with two lanes initially reserved for motorcycle traffic. The interconnecting \nroad will be constructed to four-lane standard, to be widened to six-lane standard in the future. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Australia are proposed to finance \nthe Cao Lanh bridge and the interconnecting road, and the Government of Korea to provide \nparallel financing for the Vam Cong bridge and its associated road works.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n4.  Viet Nam has a rapidly growing export-led economy; it is the world\u2019s second largest rice \nexporter. The economy of the Mekong Delta, a key economic region, relies mainly on agro-\nindustry and other light industries. The Mekong Delta produces more than 60% of Viet Nam\u2019s \nagricultural and fishery outputs, and is the country\u2019s third largest producer of light industrial \ngoods. Consequently, rapidly growing motorization with an inefficient transport network will soon \nlead to severe congestion of the sole arterial link\u2014National Highway 1A\u2014a four-lane single \ncarriageway road that cannot be widened due to dense inhabitation. Severe congestion could \nnegatively affect domestic food distribution as well as Viet Nam\u2019s exports, and would certainly \nincrease the cost of food and exports. To sustain economic development of this region, the \ngovernment plans to construct a parallel arterial link from Ho Chi Minh City to the Mekong Delta \nand southern coastal provinces. \n \n5.  The government\u2019s expressway development plan identifies the SSH as a key artery for \ndevelopment of the Mekong Delta.3 The SSH connects Ho Chi Minh City through the Mekong \nDelta to the southern coastal region and serves as an alternative to National Highway 1A. It also \nprovides  access  to  the  region\u2019s  western  provinces,  and  connects  to  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  Southern  Coastal  Corridor  in  An  Giang  province,  which  connects  to  highway \nnetworks in Cambodia and Thailand. The project will help diversify and develop the region\u2019s \neconomy  into  the  western  provinces.  The  western  provinces  are  predominantly  rural  and \nrelatively poor. This is primarily due to poor connectivity, which has resulted in the region\u2019s \nindustries locating and concentrating in the southeastern provinces along National Highway 1A.  \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2007. Technical \nAssistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Central Mekong Delta Region Connectivity \nProject (TA 7045-VIE). Manila. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of Viet Nam. 2008. Decision 1734/QD-TTg, Approval of Viet Nam\u2019s Expressways Development Plan \nup to 2020 and Beyond. ", "2 \n6.  The two-lane SSH is currently constrained by ferry crossings at Cao Lanh and Vam \nCong, which are slow and cause traffic delays. The government plans to remove the bottlenecks \ncaused by these ferries and, more generally, improve connectivity in the Mekong Delta by \nconstructing a section of the SSH between Cao Lanh (on the northern bank of the Tien branch \nof the Mekong River) and Long Xuyen (on the southern bank of the Hau branch).  \n \n7.  ADB is assisting the government to realize its transport investment program, increase \ntransport efficiency, and reduce transport costs. ADB\u2019s strategy for Viet Nam focuses on (i) \nalignment with the priorities of the government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2011\u2013\n2015 as they intersect with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, (ii) investments that offer value-addition and \ninnovative solutions, (iii) support for the government's commitment to economic restructuring \nand related reforms, and (iv) strategic partnerships with development partners to implement \ncommitments under the Paris Declaration.4 The government identifies the project as a high \npriority and included it in its 5-year plan.  The governments of Australia and the Republic of \nKorea, in support of their bilateral partnerships, have committed to provide financial support; for \nboth development partners, this is the largest amount provided for a single project in Viet Nam. \n \n8.  The  project  is  expected  to  bring  inclusive  development  to  areas  that  are  poorly \nconnected to major population centers, improve access to basic social and health services, \nincrease national food security by stimulating the local agro-industry and boosting exports, \nfacilitate private sector investment, and extend regional connectivity to neighboring Cambodia \nand the Greater Mekong Subregion, as well as to Viet Nam\u2019s major inland ports in the Mekong \nDelta. An estimated 170,000 road users will benefit daily from the project; the 5 million residents \nof An Giang, Can Tho, and Dong Thap provinces will benefit from improved living standards.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The expected impact is improved and sustainable transport connectivity contributing to \ninclusive development in the Central Mekong Delta Region. The expected outcome is improved \nroad transport access and travel time across and within the Central Mekong Delta Region.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project will build a section of the SSH, including two cable-stayed bridges with a \ncombined length of about 5 kilometers (km) and associated access and interconnecting roads \nwith a total length of about 26 km, and provide systems for bridge health monitoring, traffic \nmanagement, and emergency response. The project comprises component 1, Cao Lanh bridge \n(2.0 km) and approach roads (5.8 km); component 2, interconnecting road (15.7 km); and \ncomponent 3, Vam Cong bridge (3.0 km) and approach roads (4.5 km) to be financed by the \nExport\u2013Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM).5 This output will be achieved through construction, \nassociated project management, and safeguard implementation and monitoring activities.6 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $860 million (Table 1). \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2011.

The government  has requested  a  loan  of $410  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project.7 The loan will have a 31-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  6  years  (straight-line  repayment  method),  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year on the undisbursed loan amount (the interest and other \ncharges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. The average loan maturity is 18.75 years, and the maturity \npremium payable to ADB is 0.20% per annum.  \n \n13.  The  government  has  asked  ADB  to  finance  part  of  the  land  acquisition  cost  and \nresettlement expenses through retroactive financing, as well as part of the taxes. The eligibility \nof these items for ADB financing was determined through a due diligence assessment, which \nfocused on (i) the expected productive nature of land to be acquired, (ii) suitability of land \nmarket conditions, (iii) adequacy of administrative arrangements to ensure transparent and \nefficient transfer of funds, (iv) risk profile of the transaction, (v) soundness of the monitoring and \nevaluation  arrangements,  and  (vi)  the  country  partnership  strategy  recommendation  for \nfinancing  taxes  that  apply  to  ADB-financed  expenditures.  Based  on  the  results  of  the \nassessments, ADB concluded that all requirements had been met.8  \n \n                                                \n7  Including transportation, insurance, and bank charges.  \n8  Due Diligence for Land Acquisition and Resettlement Financing (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n ", "4 \n14.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The Government of Australia, through the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID), will provide grant cofinancing of A$128 million. \nADB will administer the grant, equivalent to $134 million at the exchange rate prevailing at the \ntime of fact-finding; it will be denominated in US dollars pursuant to ADB\u2019s standard accounting \npractices.9 AusAID will jointly cofinance the cost of civil works with ADB based on different ratios \nfor each cost category and/or subcategory. The Government of the Republic of Korea, through \nKEXIM,  will  provide  a  tied-parallel  loan  of  $260  million  equivalent  for  component  3.  The \nGovernment of Viet Nam will finance all costs for project management; unexploded ordnance \nclearance;  and  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  taxes,  and  duties  for  the  KEXIM-financed \ncomponent 3.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Transport (MOT) will be the executing agency. Cuu Long Corporation for \nInvestment, Development and Project Management of Infrastructure (Cuu Long CIPM), under \nMOT, will be the implementing agency and will be responsible for the direct supervision and \nday-to-day project implementation. The provincial peoples committees in Dong Thap province \nand Can Tho city and their respective centers for land fund development will implement the \nproject\u2019s resettlement plans.  \n \n16.  A project coordinating committee (PCC) will provide overall direction and management. \nIt will be responsible for ensuring coordination across all aspects of project implementation; \nresolving technical and contractual issues as they arise; and monitoring implementation of the \nproject\u2019s safeguard programs, in particular programs for addressing involuntary resettlement \nand  environmental  impact  mitigation.  The  PCC  will  meet  semiannually  during  project \nimplementation, when possible coinciding with the cofinanciers\u2019 joint review missions. \n \n17.  The MOT vice-minister responsible for the project will chair the PCC. PCC members will \ninclude representatives of the cofinanciers, the provinces within the project area, and relevant \ncentral  government  ministries  and  agencies.  The  Cuu  Long  CIPM  will  act  as  the  PCC \nsecretariat in coordination with relevant MOT departments. The vice chairs of the respective \nprovincial peoples committees will chair the provincial coordination meetings to implement the \nproject\u2019s social programs.  \n \n18.  Associated  with  the  project,  ADB  approved  a  detailed  design  and  implementation \nsupport technical assistance (DDIS-TA), fully financed by the Government of Australia.10 This \n                                                \n9  This amount may be adjusted for currency fluctuations to match the grant amount received by ADB.  \n10 ADB. 2011.

Manila (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nDDIS-TA has met two fundamental project needs: (i) prepared detailed designs and bidding \ndocuments  for  the  portion  of  the  project  to  be  financed  by  ADB  and  the  Government  of \nAustralia; and (ii) prepared social, resettlement, and environmental planning documents for the \nentire  project.  The  DDIS-TA  (i)  has  reduced  start-up  delays  and  will  expedite  project \nimplementation; (ii) responds to the government\u2019s target for construction and commissioning of \nthe project during 2013\u20132017; (iii) has reduced the cost of ADB financing to the government by \nadvancing project readiness; and (iv) includes construction supervision services and capacity \nbuilding support, which are critical for successful  project implementation. Procurement and \nsafeguard implementation, also under the DDIS-TA, are well advanced. In summary, the project \nhas  achieved  a  high  level  of  readiness,  and  construction  activities  are  expected  to  start \nimmediately after loan and grant effectiveness. \n \n19.  Procurement  of  works  financed  by  ADB  and  AusAID  are  being  undertaken  under \nadvance action. International competitive bidding procedures are being applied for the project\u2019s \ncivil works. Any additional works or goods that may be required during project implementation \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). All required consulting services, including preparation of detailed designs and \nprocurement,  construction  supervision,  safeguard  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nstrengthening the institutional and operating capacity of Cuu Long CIPM were engaged under \nthe DDIS-TA. The engagement of any additional consulting services for project components \nfunded by ADB and AusAID, will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time).11 ADB approved the procurement plan \nprepared under the DDIS-TA on 18 December 2012. Works, goods, and services under the \nKEXIM-financed contracts will be procured following KEXIM\u2019s procurement procedures and \npractices. \n \n20.  For the KEXIM-financed component 3, the cofinanciers agreed that a single process for \nthe  assessment  of  social  and  environmental  impacts,  the  preparation  of  safeguard \ndocumentation, and adherence to consultation and disclosure requirements will be governed by \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009, SPS) and KEXIM\u2019s safeguard requirements. In the \nevent of differences between ADB and KEXIM requirements, the ADB\u2019s SPS will govern. During \nproject  implementation,  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  due  diligence,  reviewing \ndocuments, and supervising project activities for all the project components in accordance with \nADB's SPS. KEXIM will be responsible for conducting due diligence, reviewing documents, and \nsupervising other activities that are not required by ADB's SPS but may be required by KEXIM. \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.12 \n                                                \n11 Checklists  for  actions  required  to  contract  consultants  by  method  available  in  e-Handbook  on  Project \nImplementation at http://www.adb.org/documents/handbooks/project-implementation/ \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2013\u2013December 2017 (not including defects liability period) \nEstimated completion date  December 2019 (financial closing date: June 2020)a \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project Coordination Committee \nVice-minister of transport (chair)  \nDirector general, Cuu Long Corporation for Investment, Development and \nProject Management of Infrastructure (Cuu Long CIPM) \nRelevant central government agencies \nDong Thap province chair and Can Tho city chair \nRepresentatives of ADB, AusAID, and KEXIM (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport \n(iii)  Key implementing  Cuu Long CIPM (for project implementation) \nagencies  Provincial peoples committees in Dong Thap province and Can Tho city \n(for resettlement implementation) \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Division under (iii), Ho Chi Minh City, 20 staff  \nProcurement  International  1 ICB for Cao Lanh bridge  $349 million \ncompetitive bidding  2 ICB individual packages for \n(ICB)  bridge approach roads \n1 ICB multiple contract package \nfor interconnecting road (3 lots) \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advanced contracting and retroactive financing were requested to procure \nadvance contracting  civil works contracts.

The project is located within the heart of the Mekong Delta\u2014a region characterized by \nan  extensive  inland  waterway  network  that  serves  irrigation,  international  navigation, \ntransportation, and many other domestic purposes. The waterway network connects with the \nMekong River, which at the project site exists as two separate branches, the Hau and the Tien. \n ", "7 \nA road constructed through this area requires multiple bridges to cross the two main branches \nof the Mekong River and many smaller canals and river channels. \n \n24.  For  the  two  main  river  crossings,  the  proposed  cable-stayed  bridge  structures  are \nappropriate  and  dictated  mainly  by  the  need  for  large  horizontal  and  vertical  navigation \nclearance. The bridges are within the scale of similar structures, including the My Thuan and Can \nTho  bridges  located  downstream  from  the  project  site,  and  will  be  constructed  to  six-lane \nconfiguration with one lane on each side reserved for motorcycle use. The project includes  \n26 small to medium-sized bridges, 6 of which provide for navigational requirements. For the \ninterconnecting road and smaller bridges, the selected alignment and cross-section standards are \nappropriate for the intended traffic use and forecast traffic volume, and will be constructed to four-\nlane configuration with a directional separation median. The road sections are access controlled, \nwhich  provides  for  safe  crossing,  merging,  and  diverging  traffic  movements.  Passage  for \npedestrians, nonmotorized traffic, and agricultural equipment is provided by dedicated crossings \nunder the bridges, at an average of one crossing per kilometer. The detailed designs address all \ntechnical and design aspects, and an independent proof-check certificate was issued. A road \nsafety audit has also been undertaken and incorporated in the project\u2019s detailed designs.13 \n \n25.  The Mekong Delta is identified as one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable regions to climate \nchange. Predicted changes to the climate of the delta area, and more generally to the Mekong \nRiver catchment upstream of the delta, could increase both the magnitude and frequency of \nfloods and storms and induce greater seasonal variability in weather patterns. Taken together, \nthese risks potentially reduce the intended design life of large infrastructure works. The project\u2019s \ntechnical designs include climate change adaptation measures to mitigate these risks. The \nadaptation features include increased height for road embankments and larger clearance for \nbridges based on recommendations of the government\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources and \nEnvironment, supported by studies conducted by the design consultants and parallel regional \ntechnical assistance commissioned by ADB.14 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of return of 17%. The \nsensitivity analysis shows that the project is resilient to likely variations in critical parameters \nand remains economically viable with an economic internal rate of return of 12.7% when all \nsensitivity parameters are concurrently set to their lowest values. The risk analysis shows less \nthan a 1% risk that the project\u2019s economic internal rate of return will fall below ADB's cutoff rate \nfor economic viability of 12%.15 \n  \n27.  The project will not generate revenue. Financial analysis assessed the project owner\u2019s \nfinancial capacity to sustainably maintain the project. Until 2013, road maintenance funding was \nallocated from the national budget and increased from D1,537 billion to D4,377 billion during \n2007\u20132013 for the entire national road network (18,000 km) in line with the prevailing national \ninflation rates. This  met  about  50%  of  the  required  road maintenance  needs,  and  budget \nplanning and allocation normally followed set timelines and procedures without many delays. In \n2013,  the  government,  as  part  of  overall  road  subsector  reform  and  transition  to  a  more \nsustainable maintenance program, introduced a road fund, financed from a combination of \nvehicle registration fees and budgetary allocations. Specific to this project, the government\u2019s \n                                                \n13 Road Safety Audit Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2012. Draft Final Report. Central Mekong Delta Region Connectivity Project: Rapid Climate Change Threat \nand Vulnerability Assessment. Manila (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15 Economic and Financial Analyses (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \npolicies and regulations for operation and maintenance (O&M) of large and complex transport \ninfrastructure require that O&M budgets be prioritized and allocated based on the performance-\nbased plans developed specifically for such projects. The DDIS-TA will prepare an O&M plan \nand manuals for the project. The government has provided assurances that an O&M plan will be \ndeveloped, implemented, and financed to ensure long-term sustainability of the project facilities. \n \nC.  Governance \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. The specific policy requirements and necessary measures are described in \nthe project administration manual (footnote 12). The findings of the financial and procurement \ncapacity assessment of the implementing agency indicate that Cuu Long CIPM (i) employs 115 \nstaff  with  seven  project  management  divisions;  (ii)  has  sufficient  financial  administration  and \nprocurement capacity to efficiently manage the project; and (iii) has successfully implemented \nmajor development partner-funded projects, including the My Thuan cable-stayed bridge financed \nby the Government of Australia and the Can Tho cable-stayed bridge funded by the Government of \nJapan,  and  is  currently  implementing  the  ADB-financed  Southern  Coastal  Corridor  Project \ncofinanced  by  the  governments  of  Australia  and  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  financial  and \nprocurement management assessments do not identify any major outstanding risks or issues.16 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  A social impact assessment prepared for the project identifies the following as potentially \nsignificant adverse project impacts: (i) land acquisition and resettlement, (ii) changed livelihoods \nassociated with disruption of ferry traffic and changed traffic flow, (iii) access to and mobility on \nlocal roads once the highway and bridges are constructed, (iv) road safety, and (v) risk of \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  The  assessment  also  highlights  that  women  are  more \nvulnerable to hardship due to the loss of economic and social base caused by land acquisition, \nrelocation, and livelihood impacts. \n \n30.  Based on the social impact assessment, a social action plan (SAP) was prepared to \nensure that the project\u2019s social benefits are maximized and its adverse impacts are mitigated, if \nthey cannot be avoided. It incorporates gender inclusive interventions related to the prevention \nof HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The SAP is estimated to cost $1.2 million; it is financed \noutside of the project scope under the DDIS-TA. In addition, a subproject financed by the \nGender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund  is  supporting  the  economic  empowerment  of \nwomen residing near the project area, as well as reducing their vulnerability and exposure to \nrisks as a result of increased physical connectivity.17 Gender issues are integrated into the \nresettlement  plan,  including  actions  to  ensure  that  all  compensation  payments  and  cash \nassistance are provided jointly in the name of husband and wife. In addition, contractors will be \nencouraged to employ women and provide equal pay for equal work. Under the DDIS-TA, \nfemale project implementation personnel of Cuu Long CIPM will undergo training programs \nrelevant to the project activities. Since most gender-specific actions are undertaken outside the \nproject scope, for gender classification the project is categorized as having no gender element. \n \n                                                \n16 Financial Management Assessment and Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked \ndocument in Appendix 2).   \n17 ADB. 2007. Promoting Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment. Manila.  \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS,  the  project  is  categorized  as  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement and environment. As the project is not expected to affect any ethnic minorities, it is \ncategorized as C for indigenous peoples. \n \n32.  Resettlement plans for Can Tho city and Dong Thap province, based on ADB\u2019s SPS, \nwere prepared under the DDIS-TA, and posted on ADB\u2019s website on 9 April 2013. The project \nwill require a total land area of 255 hectares. Land acquisition will affect 7,139 people (1,555 \nhouseholds). About 1,000 of these households will lose productive land and 558 households will \nrequire relocation.18 A grievance redress mechanism to address resettlement-related complaints \nwas established under the people\u2019s committees of the project provinces. The income restoration \nprograms, which are part of the project\u2019s resettlement plans, will be funded under the DDIS-TA \nand will be implemented over 2 years during 2013\u20132014. \n \n33.  A draft environmental impact assessment and environment management plan, based on \nADB\u2019s SPS, were prepared under the DDIS-TA, and posted on ADB\u2019s website on 22 January \n2013. The project alignment will traverse mostly agricultural land and the fringes of urban areas. \nThere is little natural landscape along the alignment. No forests, conservation areas, or reserves \nare in the vicinity of the project. The air quality data along two existing roads close to the project \nalignment show an increasing trend of particulate concentration due to the increasing number of \nvehicles  and  motorcycles  using  the  ferries  and  vehicles  idling  during  ferry  loading  and \nunloading.  The  environmental  management  plan  includes  detailed  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures and corresponding monitoring requirements to avoid or minimize adverse impacts \nduring  various  project  phases.  The  government  has  assured  ADB  that  consultations  with \naffected  persons  will  continue  during  project  operation  to  ensure  that  actual  impacts  are \nadequately addressed. The DDIS-TA includes an environmental awareness raising and training \nprogram to improve the environmental management capacity of Cuu Long CIPM. \n \n34.  Civil society, including project-affected people, and various government agencies from \nthe project provinces were consulted during 2009\u20132012. The project contractors will develop a \ngrievance redress mechanism for environmental management prior to commencement of civil \nworks. In addition, under the DDIS-TA, international external resettlement and environmental \nmonitoring  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  verify  the  activities  related  to  resettlement  and \nenvironment safeguard compliance. The external monitoring will be done on an annual basis for \nenvironment and on a semiannual basis for resettlement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  A risk assessment and risk management plan was prepared.19 The major risks associated \nwith the project, when mitigated, are low and  include (i) project road and bridges not built, \nmaintained, and operated to the specified standards; (ii) major traffic accidents and ship collision \nwith the bridges; (iii) impact of climate change; (iv) procurement and corruption; (v) environmental, \nsocial, and resettlement issues; and (vi) unforeseen construction delays. The risk of substandard \nconstruction quality is mitigated through design and procurement arrangements that require the \ndesigners and civil works contractors to meet strict qualifications. In addition, technical designs \nincorporate provisions for climate change adaptation, safety and emergency response systems, \nand have been proof-checked by an independent consultant. The government has provided an \n                                                \n18 A single household may lose both productive land and dwelling.  \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nassurance that an O&M plan will be developed, implemented, and resourced to ensure long-term \nsustainability of the project facilities. The risks associated with procurement and corruption are low \nas all procurement activities are in advanced stage. ADB and AusAID will jointly monitor all \nprocurement activities to ensure full compliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Up-to-date \ninformation related to procurement, safeguard monitoring, and financial audit will be disclosed on \nADB\u2019s website as required by ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy, as well as on Cuu Long \nCIPM\u2019s project website. The environmental, social, and resettlement related risks will be managed \nthrough joint ADB\u2013AusAID monitoring of the environment management plan, SAP, resettlement \nplans, and income restoration programs during implementation. Unforeseen construction delays \nwill be mitigated through provisions in the construction contracts. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n36.  The government and MOT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n37.  The government and MOT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n38.  MOT, through Cuu Long CIPM, will confirm to ADB in writing prior to issuing a site \npossession notice to a contractor for commencing work on a specific section of a contract that \n(i) payment of compensation has been fully disbursed to the affected people and rehabilitation \nmeasures are in place for that specific section in accordance with the project\u2019s resettlement \nplans; (ii) affected people who were compensated for that specific section have vacated the site; \nand (iii) the specific section of the project is free from any encumbrances. \n \n39.  The ADB loan and the Government of Australia grant will not become effective until the \nGovernment of Viet Nam confirms in writing to ADB that adequate funding for component 3 has \nbeen secured on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $410,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central \nMekong Delta Region Connectivity Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 31 years, including a grace period \nof 6 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \nA$128,000,000 as provided in paragraph 14 of this report, to the Socialist Republic \nof  Viet  Nam for the  Central  Mekong  Delta  Region  Connectivity  Project, to  be \nprovided by the Government of Australia. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n11 July 2013\n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved and  Share of secondary sector  Traffic and travel time  Government\u2019s \nsustainable  employment in Dong Thap,  surveys   investment programs in \ntransport  Can Tho, and An Giang    the Mekong Delta \nconnectivity  provinces increased from  Reports from review  Region under its Socio-\ncontributing to  an average of 12% in 2013  missions   Economic Development \ninclusive  to an average of 25% in    Plan and Expressway \ndevelopment in the  2025a  Reports from the DDIS- Development Plan are \nCentral Mekong    TA consultant   implemented as \nDelta Region  170,000 road users benefit    planned  \ndaily from the project by  Project completion report \n \n2020; the number increases   \nby 5.8% per annum  Independent resettlement \nthereafter   monitoring, and benefits \n  monitoring and evaluation \n5 million residents of An  report \nGiang, Can Tho, and Dong \nThap provinces benefit from \nimproved living standards \nby 2020 and onwards \n \nAdequate operation and \nmaintenance and climate \nresilience awareness \nincreased and, as a result, \nlevel of service expressed \nin International Roughness \nIndex, maintained under 4 \nm/km during the project life \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved road  20,000 passenger car units  Traffic and travel time  Parts of the Second \ntransport access  including 4,000 goods  surveys   Southern Highway and \nand travel time  vehicles per day use the    GMS Southern Coastal \nacross and within  project roads and bridges in  Reports from the DDIS- Corridor are completed \nthe Central  2020   TA consultant  as planned  \nMekong Delta     \n \nRegion  Travel time from Ho Chi  Project completion report  \nMinh City to Long Xuyen    Risks \nreduced from 3\u20133.5 hours in  Reports from review  Project road and \n2013 to 2.5 hours by the  missions   bridges not built, \nend of 2017    maintained, and \n  operated to the \nTravel time from Cao Lanh  specified standards  \nferry to Vam Cong ferry \nMajor traffic and ship \nreduced from 1\u20131.5 hours in \ncollision accidents \n2013 to 30 minutes by the \nend of 2017  Inaccessibility of road \n  and bridges due to \nTravel distance from Cao  climate change impacts  \nLanh to Long Xuyen \nreduced from 35.4 km in \n2013 to 29 km by the end of \n2017 \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
