The bridges will be constructed to six-lane \ncarriageway standard, with two lanes initially reserved for motorcycle traffic. The interconnecting \nroad will be constructed to four-lane standard, to be widened to six-lane standard in the future. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Australia are proposed to finance \nthe  Cao  Lanh  bridge  and  the  interconnecting  road,  and  the  Government  of  Korea  to  provide \nparallel financing for the Vam Cong bridge and its associated road works.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nViet Nam has a rapidly growing export-led economy; it is the world\u2019s second largest rice \n4. \nexporter.  The  economy  of  the  Mekong  Delta,  a  key  economic  region,  relies  mainly  on  agro-\nindustry  and  other  light  industries.  The  Mekong  Delta  produces  more  than  60%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nagricultural  and  fishery  outputs,  and  is  the  country\u2019s  third  largest  producer  of  light  industrial \ngoods. Consequently, rapidly growing motorization with an inefficient transport network will soon \nlead  to  severe  congestion  of  the  sole  arterial  link\u2014National  Highway  1A\u2014a  four-lane  single \ncarriageway  road  that  cannot  be  widened  due  to  dense  inhabitation.  Severe  congestion  could \nnegatively  affect  domestic food  distribution  as  well  as Viet  Nam\u2019s  exports,  and  would certainly \nincrease  the  cost  of  food  and  exports.  To  sustain  economic  development  of  this  region,  the \ngovernment plans to construct a parallel arterial link from Ho Chi Minh City to the Mekong Delta \nand southern coastal provinces. \n \nThe government\u2019s expressway development plan identifies the SSH as a key artery for \n5. \ndevelopment  of  the  Mekong  Delta.3 The  SSH  connects  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  through  the  Mekong \nDelta to the southern coastal region and serves as an alternative to National Highway 1A. It also \nprovides  access  to  the  region\u2019s  western  provinces,  and  connects  to  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  Southern  Coastal  Corridor  in  An  Giang  province,  which  connects  to  highway \nnetworks  in  Cambodia  and  Thailand.  The  project  will  help  diversify  and  develop  the  region\u2019s \neconomy  into  the  western  provinces.  The  western  provinces  are  predominantly  rural  and \nrelatively  poor.  This  is  primarily  due  to  poor  connectivity,  which  has  resulted  in  the  region\u2019s \nindustries locating and concentrating in the southeastern provinces along National Highway 1A.  \n\n                                                \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2007.  Technical \nAssistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Preparing  the  Central  Mekong  Delta  Region  Connectivity \nProject (TA 7045-VIE). Manila. \n\n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of Viet Nam. 2008. Decision 1734/QD-TTg, Approval of Viet Nam\u2019s Expressways Development Plan \n\nup to 2020 and Beyond. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  two-lane  SSH  is  currently  constrained  by  ferry  crossings  at  Cao  Lanh  and  Vam \n6. \nCong, which are slow and cause traffic delays. The government plans to remove the bottlenecks \ncaused  by  these  ferries  and,  more  generally,  improve  connectivity  in  the  Mekong  Delta  by \nconstructing a section of the SSH between Cao Lanh (on the northern bank of the Tien branch \nof the Mekong River) and Long Xuyen (on the southern bank of the Hau branch).  \n \n7. \nADB  is  assisting  the  government  to  realize  its  transport  investment  program,  increase \ntransport  efficiency,  and  reduce  transport  costs.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  Viet  Nam  focuses  on  (i) \nalignment  with  the  priorities  of  the  government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u2013\n2015 as they intersect with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, (ii) investments that offer value-addition and \ninnovative  solutions,  (iii)  support  for  the  government's  commitment  to  economic  restructuring \nand  related  reforms,  and  (iv)  strategic  partnerships  with  development  partners  to  implement \ncommitments  under  the  Paris  Declaration.4 The  government  identifies  the  project  as  a  high \npriority  and  included  it  in  its  5-year  plan.    The  governments  of  Australia  and  the  Republic  of \nKorea, in support of their bilateral partnerships, have committed to provide financial support; for \nboth development partners, this is the largest amount provided for a single project in Viet Nam. \n \n8. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  bring  inclusive  development  to  areas  that  are  poorly \nconnected  to  major  population  centers,  improve  access  to  basic  social  and  health  services, \nincrease  national  food  security  by  stimulating  the  local  agro-industry  and  boosting  exports, \nfacilitate  private  sector  investment,  and  extend  regional  connectivity  to  neighboring  Cambodia \nand the Greater Mekong Subregion, as well as to Viet Nam\u2019s major inland ports in the Mekong \nDelta. An estimated 170,000 road users will benefit daily from the project; the 5 million residents \nof An Giang, Can Tho, and Dong Thap provinces will benefit from improved living standards.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe  expected  impact  is improved  and sustainable  transport connectivity  contributing to \ninclusive development in the Central Mekong Delta Region. The expected outcome is improved \nroad transport access and travel time across and within the Central Mekong Delta Region.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe  project  will  build  a  section  of  the  SSH,  including  two  cable-stayed  bridges  with  a \ncombined length  of  about  5 kilometers (km)  and  associated  access  and interconnecting  roads \nwith  a  total  length  of  about  26  km,  and  provide  systems  for  bridge  health  monitoring,  traffic \nmanagement, and emergency response. The project comprises component 1, Cao Lanh bridge \n(2.0  km)  and  approach  roads  (5.8  km);  component  2,  interconnecting  road  (15.7  km);  and \ncomponent  3,  Vam  Cong  bridge  (3.0 km)  and  approach  roads  (4.5  km)  to  be  financed  by  the \nExport\u2013Import  Bank  of  Korea  (KEXIM). 5 This  output  will  be  achieved  through  construction, \nassociated project management, and safeguard implementation and monitoring activities.6 \n \nD. \n \n11. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $860 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. 2011.

The  DDIS-TA  (i)  has  reduced  start-up  delays  and  will  expedite  project \nimplementation; (ii) responds to the government\u2019s target for construction and commissioning of \nthe project during 2013\u20132017; (iii) has reduced the cost of ADB financing to the government by \nadvancing  project  readiness;  and  (iv)  includes  construction  supervision  services  and  capacity \nbuilding  support,  which  are  critical  for  successful  project  implementation.  Procurement  and \nsafeguard implementation, also under the DDIS-TA, are well advanced. In summary, the project \nhas  achieved  a  high  level  of  readiness,  and  construction  activities  are  expected  to  start \nimmediately after loan and grant effectiveness. \n \nProcurement  of  works  financed  by  ADB  and  AusAID  are  being  undertaken  under \n19. \nadvance action. International competitive bidding procedures are being applied for the project\u2019s \ncivil  works.  Any  additional  works  or goods  that may  be required  during project  implementation \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from \ntime  to  time).  All  required  consulting  services,  including  preparation  of  detailed  designs  and \nprocurement, \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and \nstrengthening  the  institutional  and operating  capacity  of  Cuu  Long  CIPM  were  engaged  under \nthe  DDIS-TA.  The  engagement  of  any  additional  consulting  services  for  project  components \nfunded  by  ADB  and  AusAID,  will  be  recruited  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). 11 ADB  approved  the  procurement  plan \nprepared  under  the  DDIS-TA  on  18  December  2012.  Works,  goods,  and  services  under  the \nKEXIM-financed  contracts  will  be  procured  following  KEXIM\u2019s  procurement  procedures  and \npractices. \n \nFor the KEXIM-financed component 3, the cofinanciers agreed that a single process for \n20. \nthe  assessment  of  social  and  environmental \nthe  preparation  of  safeguard \ndocumentation, and adherence to consultation and disclosure requirements will be governed by \nADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009,  SPS)  and  KEXIM\u2019s  safeguard  requirements.  In  the \nevent of differences between ADB and KEXIM requirements, the ADB\u2019s SPS will govern. During \nproject  implementation,  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  due  diligence,  reviewing \ndocuments, and supervising project activities for all the project components in accordance with \nADB's SPS. KEXIM will be responsible for conducting due diligence, reviewing documents, and \nsupervising other activities that are not required by ADB's SPS but may be required by KEXIM. \n \n21. \nthe project administration manual.12 \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nsupervision, \n\nsafeguard \n\nimpacts, \n\n                                                \n11 Checklists  for  actions  required  to  contract  consultants  by  method  available  in  e-Handbook  on  Project \n\nImplementation at http://www.adb.org/documents/handbooks/project-implementation/ \n\n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nSeptember 2013\u2013December 2017 (not including defects liability period) \nDecember 2019 (financial closing date: June 2020)a \n\nProject Coordination Committee \nVice-minister of transport (chair)  \nDirector general, Cuu Long Corporation for Investment, Development and \nProject Management of Infrastructure (Cuu Long CIPM) \nRelevant central government agencies \nDong Thap province chair and Can Tho city chair \nRepresentatives of ADB, AusAID, and KEXIM (members) \nMinistry of Transport \nCuu Long CIPM (for project implementation) \nProvincial  peoples  committees  in  Dong  Thap  province  and  Can  Tho  city \n(for resettlement implementation) \nDivision under (iii), Ho Chi Minh City, 20 staff  \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \n(ICB) \n\n1 ICB for Cao Lanh bridge \n2 ICB individual packages for \nbridge approach roads \n1 ICB multiple contract package \nfor interconnecting road (3 lots) \nAdvanced contracting and retroactive financing were requested to procure \ncivil works contracts. Retroactive financing of up to 20% of loan and grant \namounts will finance eligible project expenditures for civil works, land \nacquisition and resettlement, incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not \nearlier than 12 months before loan signing. \nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB.  \n\n$349 million \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AusAID  =  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  KEXIM  =  Export\u2013\nImport Bank of Korea. \na Final disbursement from loan and grant accounts equivalent to the amount of retention money in civil works will be \nmade at the end of defects liability period. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n22. \nThe government will allocate budget to MOT for land acquisition and resettlement. The \namount disbursed by MOT for eligible expenditures related to land acquisition and resettlement \nincurred during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to signing of the ADB loan agreement \nwill  be  financed  retroactively  from  the  ADB  loan  once the  loan  is  effective,  provided  that  such \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  expenses  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  applicable  policies.  The \ngovernment acknowledges that any concurrence by ADB to finance eligible project expenditures \nretroactively does not commit ADB to finance such expenses or the project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nThe  project  is  located  within the  heart  of the  Mekong Delta\u2014a  region  characterized  by \n23. \nan  extensive \ninternational  navigation, \nthat  serves \ntransportation,  and  many  other  domestic  purposes.  The  waterway  network  connects  with  the \nMekong River, which at the project site exists as two separate branches, the Hau and the Tien. \n\ninland  waterway  network \n\nirrigation, \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fA road constructed through this area requires multiple bridges to cross the two main branches \nof the Mekong River and many smaller canals and river channels. \n \n24. \nFor  the  two  main  river  crossings,  the  proposed  cable-stayed  bridge  structures  are \nappropriate  and  dictated  mainly  by  the  need  for  large  horizontal  and  vertical  navigation \nclearance. The bridges are within the scale of similar structures, including the My Thuan and Can \nTho  bridges  located  downstream  from  the  project  site,  and  will  be  constructed  to  six-lane \nconfiguration  with  one  lane  on  each  side  reserved  for  motorcycle  use.  The  project  includes  \n26  small  to  medium-sized  bridges,  6  of  which  provide  for  navigational  requirements.  For  the \ninterconnecting road and smaller bridges, the selected alignment and cross-section standards are \nappropriate for the intended traffic use and forecast traffic volume, and will be constructed to four-\nlane configuration with a directional separation median. The road sections are access controlled, \nwhich  provides  for  safe  crossing,  merging,  and  diverging  traffic  movements.  Passage  for \npedestrians, nonmotorized traffic, and agricultural equipment is provided by dedicated  crossings \nunder the bridges, at an average of one crossing per kilometer. The detailed designs address all \ntechnical  and  design  aspects,  and  an  independent  proof-check  certificate  was  issued.  A  road \nsafety audit has also been undertaken and incorporated in the project\u2019s detailed designs.13 \n \n25. \nThe Mekong Delta is identified as one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable regions to climate \nchange. Predicted changes to the climate of the delta area, and more generally to the Mekong \nRiver  catchment  upstream  of  the  delta,  could  increase  both  the  magnitude  and  frequency  of \nfloods and storms and induce greater seasonal variability in weather patterns. Taken together, \nthese risks potentially reduce the intended design life of large infrastructure works. The project\u2019s \ntechnical  designs  include  climate  change  adaptation  measures  to  mitigate  these  risks.  The \nadaptation  features  include  increased  height  for  road  embankments  and  larger  clearance  for \nbridges  based  on  recommendations  of  the  government\u2019s  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment,  supported  by  studies  conducted  by  the  design  consultants  and  parallel  regional \ntechnical assistance commissioned by ADB.14 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n26. \nThe project is economically viable with an economic internal rate of return of  17%. The \nsensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is  resilient  to  likely  variations  in  critical  parameters \nand  remains  economically  viable  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  12.7%  when  all \nsensitivity parameters are concurrently set to their lowest values. The risk analysis shows less \nthan a 1% risk that the project\u2019s economic internal rate of return will fall below ADB's cutoff rate \nfor economic viability of 12%.15 \n  \n27. \nThe  project  will  not  generate  revenue.  Financial  analysis  assessed  the  project  owner\u2019s \nfinancial capacity to sustainably maintain the project. Until 2013, road maintenance funding was \nallocated  from  the  national  budget  and  increased  from  D1,537  billion  to  D4,377  billion  during \n2007\u20132013 for the entire national road network (18,000 km) in line with the prevailing national \ninflation  rates.  This  met  about  50%  of  the  required  road  maintenance  needs,  and  budget \nplanning and allocation normally followed set timelines and procedures without many delays. In \n2013,  the  government,  as  part  of  overall  road  subsector  reform  and  transition  to  a  more \nsustainable  maintenance  program,  introduced  a  road  fund,  financed  from  a  combination  of \nvehicle  registration  fees  and  budgetary  allocations.  Specific  to  this  project,  the  government\u2019s \n                                                \n13 Road Safety Audit Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2012. Draft Final Report. Central Mekong Delta Region Connectivity Project: Rapid Climate Change Threat \n\nand Vulnerability Assessment. Manila (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n15 Economic and Financial Analyses (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fpolicies  and  regulations  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  large  and  complex  transport \ninfrastructure require that O&M budgets be prioritized and allocated based on the performance-\nbased  plans  developed  specifically  for  such  projects.  The  DDIS-TA  will  prepare  an  O&M  plan \nand manuals for the project. The government has provided assurances that an O&M plan will be \ndeveloped, implemented, and financed to ensure long-term sustainability of the project facilities. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended to  date)  was  explained to and  discussed \n28. \nwith the government. The specific policy requirements and necessary measures are described in \nthe  project  administration  manual  (footnote  12).  The  findings  of  the  financial  and  procurement \ncapacity  assessment  of  the  implementing  agency  indicate  that  Cuu  Long  CIPM  (i)  employs  115 \nstaff  with  seven  project  management  divisions;  (ii)  has  sufficient  financial  administration  and \nprocurement  capacity  to  efficiently  manage  the  project;  and  (iii)  has  successfully  implemented \nmajor development partner-funded projects, including the My Thuan cable-stayed bridge financed \nby the Government of Australia and the Can Tho cable-stayed bridge funded by the Government of \nJapan,  and  is  currently  implementing  the  ADB-financed  Southern  Coastal  Corridor  Project \ncofinanced  by  the  governments  of  Australia  and  the  Republic  of  Korea.  The  financial  and \nprocurement management assessments do not identify any major outstanding risks or issues.16 \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n29. \nA social impact assessment prepared for the project identifies the following as potentially \nsignificant adverse project impacts: (i) land acquisition and resettlement, (ii) changed livelihoods \nassociated with disruption of ferry traffic and changed traffic flow, (iii) access to and mobility on \nlocal  roads  once  the  highway  and  bridges  are  constructed,  (iv)  road  safety,  and  (v)  risk  of \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  The  assessment  also  highlights  that  women  are  more \nvulnerable to hardship due to the loss of economic and social base caused by land acquisition, \nrelocation, and livelihood impacts. \n \n30. \nBased  on  the  social  impact  assessment,  a  social  action  plan  (SAP)  was  prepared  to \nensure that the project\u2019s social benefits are maximized and its adverse impacts are mitigated, if \nthey cannot be avoided. It incorporates gender inclusive interventions related to the prevention \nof  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  The  SAP  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.2  million;  it  is  financed \noutside  of  the  project  scope  under  the  DDIS-TA.  In  addition,  a  subproject  financed  by  the \nGender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund  is  supporting  the  economic  empowerment  of \nwomen  residing  near  the  project  area,  as  well  as  reducing  their  vulnerability  and  exposure  to \nrisks  as  a  result  of  increased  physical  connectivity. 17 Gender  issues  are  integrated  into  the \nresettlement  plan,  including  actions  to  ensure  that  all  compensation  payments  and  cash \nassistance are provided jointly in the name of husband and wife. In addition, contractors will be \nencouraged  to  employ  women  and  provide  equal  pay  for  equal  work.  Under  the  DDIS-TA, \nfemale  project  implementation  personnel  of  Cuu  Long  CIPM  will  undergo  training  programs \nrelevant to the project activities. Since most gender-specific actions are undertaken outside the \nproject scope, for gender classification the project is categorized as having no gender element. \n \n\n                                                \n16 Financial  Management  Assessment  and  Procurement  Capacity  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocument in Appendix 2).   \n\n17 ADB. 2007.

As the project is not expected to affect any ethnic minorities, it is \ncategorized as C for indigenous peoples. \n \n32. \nResettlement  plans  for  Can  Tho  city  and  Dong  Thap  province,  based  on  ADB\u2019s  SPS, \nwere prepared under the DDIS-TA, and posted on ADB\u2019s website on 9 April 2013. The project \nwill  require  a  total  land  area  of  255  hectares.  Land  acquisition  will  affect  7,139  people  (1,555 \nhouseholds). About 1,000 of these households will lose productive land and 558 households will \nrequire relocation.18 A grievance redress mechanism to address resettlement-related complaints \nwas established under the people\u2019s committees of the project provinces. The income restoration \nprograms, which are part of the project\u2019s resettlement plans, will be funded under the DDIS-TA \nand will be implemented over 2 years during 2013\u20132014. \n \n33. \nA draft environmental impact assessment and environment management plan, based on \nADB\u2019s  SPS,  were  prepared  under  the  DDIS-TA,  and  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  22  January \n2013. The project alignment will traverse mostly agricultural land and the fringes of urban areas. \nThere is little natural landscape along the alignment. No forests, conservation areas, or reserves \nare in the vicinity of the project. The air quality data along two existing roads close to the project \nalignment show an increasing trend of particulate concentration due to the increasing number of \nvehicles  and  motorcycles  using  the  ferries  and  vehicles  idling  during  ferry  loading  and \nunloading.  The  environmental  management  plan  includes  detailed  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures  and  corresponding  monitoring  requirements  to  avoid  or  minimize  adverse  impacts \nduring  various  project  phases.  The  government  has  assured  ADB  that  consultations  with \naffected  persons  will  continue  during  project  operation  to  ensure  that  actual  impacts  are \nadequately addressed. The DDIS-TA includes an environmental awareness raising and training \nprogram to improve the environmental management capacity of Cuu Long CIPM. \n \n34. \nCivil  society,  including  project-affected  people,  and  various  government  agencies  from \nthe project provinces were consulted during 2009\u20132012. The project contractors will develop a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  for  environmental  management  prior  to  commencement  of  civil \nworks.  In  addition,  under  the  DDIS-TA,  international  external  resettlement  and  environmental \nmonitoring  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  verify  the  activities  related  to  resettlement  and \nenvironment safeguard compliance. The external monitoring will be done on an annual basis for \nenvironment and on a semiannual basis for resettlement. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\nA risk assessment and risk management plan was prepared.19 The major risks associated \n35. \nwith  the  project,  when  mitigated,  are  low  and  include  (i)  project  road  and  bridges  not  built, \nmaintained, and operated to the specified standards; (ii) major traffic accidents and ship collision \nwith the bridges; (iii) impact of climate change; (iv) procurement and corruption; (v) environmental, \nsocial, and resettlement issues; and (vi) unforeseen construction delays. The risk of substandard \nconstruction  quality  is  mitigated  through  design  and  procurement  arrangements  that  require  the \ndesigners  and  civil  works  contractors  to  meet  strict  qualifications.  In  addition,  technical  designs \nincorporate  provisions  for  climate  change  adaptation,  safety  and  emergency  response  systems, \nand  have  been  proof-checked  by  an  independent  consultant.  The  government  has  provided  an \n\n                                                \n18 A single household may lose both productive land and dwelling.  \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nassurance that an O&M plan will be developed, implemented, and resourced to ensure long-term \nsustainability of the project facilities. The risks associated with procurement and corruption are low \nas  all  procurement  activities  are  in  advanced  stage.  ADB  and  AusAID  will  jointly  monitor  all \nprocurement activities to ensure full compliance  with ADB\u2019s  Procurement Guidelines. Up-to-date \ninformation related to procurement, safeguard monitoring, and financial audit will be disclosed on \nADB\u2019s  website  as  required  by  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy,  as  well  as  on  Cuu  Long \nCIPM\u2019s project website. The environmental, social, and resettlement related risks will be managed \nthrough  joint  ADB\u2013AusAID  monitoring  of  the  environment  management  plan,  SAP,  resettlement \nplans,  and  income  restoration  programs  during  implementation.  Unforeseen  construction  delays \nwill be mitigated through provisions in the construction contracts. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government and MOT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\n36. \nThe  government  and  MOT  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n37. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n38.
