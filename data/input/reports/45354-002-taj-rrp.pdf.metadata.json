It  frequently  experiences  extreme  climate  events  such  as \nintense  spring  rainfall,  excessive  melt-waters  from  large  snow  accumulations,  droughts,  and \noccasionally devastating glacial lake outburst floods. These cause mudflows, floods, reduced water \navailability, avalanches, landslides, and rockfalls.  \n\n3. \nWith  a  population  of  approximately  1.27  million,  the  Pyanj  River  Basin  (114,500  square \nkilometers)  is  the  largest  of  the  five  principal  basins  of  Tajikistan  (Pyanj,  Vakhsh,  Kafernigan, \nZerevshan, and Syr Darya). It has a large range of altitude, from 300\u2013350 meters (m) in the semi-\narid lowlands of southern Khatlon to more than 7,000 m in the Pamir and Hindu-Kush mountains. It \nis also the bread-basket of Tajikistan, containing a large portion of the country\u2019s agricultural land. \nCommunities located in the Pyanj River Basin are already experiencing extreme climatic events.3 \nIn  the  mountainous  Gorno  Badakhsan  oblast  (province),  droughts,  avalanches,  landslides, \nrockfalls,  and  violent  winds  are  routine  events  which  disrupt  social  and  economic  life,  damage \nhouses  and  infrastructure,  and  erode  land.  Occasional  but  devastating  flash  floods  are  released \nwhen  temporary  glacial  lakes,  created  by  glacier  surges  in  the  Pamir  Mountains,  burst  without \nwarning (glacier lake outburst flood). In the hills, lowlands, and flood plains of the eastern Khatlon \nregion,  droughts  caused  by  decreased  snowfall,  and  mudflows  and  floods  caused  by  intense \nspring rain, occur annually. These hazards routinely destroy land, crops, and infrastructure and, in \nthe worst cases, take lives. \n\nRecent  studies  (footnote  3)  indicated  that  projected  rise  in  temperature  of  up  to  2  degree \n4. \nCelsius by 2050 will result in glacial melt and early snow melt. The runoff peak is likely to shift from \nthe current late spring and early summer towards late winter and early spring runoff regime. This \nshift has significant repercussions for farming practices and water resources management because \nit leads to a major water deficit during the crop growing season. Increasing risks from hazards such \nas  catastrophic  flooding  due  to  glacial  lake  outbursts,  destabilizations  of  mountain  slopes,  and \nmore landslides will result in a progressive increase in economic losses and risk to the population, \nand  reduce  the  ability  of  communities  located  in  the  Pyanj  River  Basin  to  move  out  of  poverty. \nThese  adverse  effects  will  be  exacerbated  by  an  increase  in  water  demand  resulting  from \nincreased  evapotranspiration  and  a  projected  25%  population  increase  by  2050.4  Water \ninfrastructure  in  the  Pyanj  River  Basin  is  in  a  state  of  disrepair.  Irrigation  systems  and  flood \n\n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB.  2010.

Planning  and \nmaintenance  capacity  at  the  jamoat  (subdistrict)  and  community  level  is  very  weak.  Financial \nresources for subsector-specific development planning and operation and maintenance (O&M) are \nabsent. National and local institutions lack climate change risk management skills. In addition, the \nPyanj  River  Basin  faces  particular  development  challenges  arising  from  the  high  rate  of  out-\nmigration  by  males  and  the  consequent  prevalence  of  households  headed  by  women.  Main \nbarriers  to  climate  resilience  include  the  lack  of  information  on  climate  change  impacts  on  water \nresources, limited availability of financial resources to introduce resilient practices, absence of risk \ntransfer mechanisms, and limited women\u2019s involvement in decision making.   \n\n5. \nAs  a  result  of  its  high  exposure  and  its  limited  capacity  to  anticipate  and  manage  climate \nchange risks, Tajikistan is a beneficiary of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience\u2015a multilateral \nprogram financed by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) that aims to increase climate resilience in \ndeveloping countries. Building climate change resilience in the Pyanj River Basin was identified as \na  priority  in  the  extensive  consultations5  that  the  government  has  conducted  in  partnership  with \nADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  since  2009,  as \npart  of the first  phase  of  the  Pilot  Program for  Climate  Resilience.  Priorities  identified  include the \nneed for a better coordinated and strategic approach to water resources management in the Pyanj \nRiver  Basin,  encompassing  (i)  improved  access  to  water  resources  through  climate-resilient \ninfrastructure for irrigation, drainage, water supply, and storage; (ii) increased resilience to extreme \nclimate events through flood protection, early warning systems, and risk transfer mechanisms; and \n(iii) improved access to information and financial resources, particularly for women. \n\nThe  proposed  project  is  consistent  with  the  Tajikistan  country  partnership  strategy,  2010\u2013\n6. \n20146 and is included in the Tajikistan country operations business plan, 2013\u20132014.7 This project \nis also in line with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework, Strategy 2020.8 The project design reflects \nlessons from previous ADB interventions in the country.9 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n7. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  improved  livelihoods  of  Pyanj  River  Basin  communities \nvulnerable to climate variability and change. The project\u2019s outcome will be reduced adverse effects \nof climate variability and climate change in 59 villages in 19 jamoats in the Pyanj River Basin. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n8. \nThe project has four outputs. Output 1 is flood protection infrastructure climate-proofed in 10 \njamoats.10  It  will  (i)  upgrade  and  climate-proof  flood  and  mudflow  protection  infrastructure  in  10 \nlocations,  including  riverbank  reinforcement,  embankment  reconstruction,  restoration  of  stream \nbeds,  terracing  and  planting  of  trees,  and  soil  stabilization;  (ii)  establish  O&M  practices,  develop \n\n                                                \n5  The  consultations  engaged  over  1,400  stakeholders  from  government  agencies,  international  organizations,  donors, \n\ncivil society, and communities living in the Pyanj River Basin.  \n\n6   ADB. 2010.

PFIs will provide a minimum of 10% of each subloan amount, increasing \nthe total amount made available to subborrowers to at least $3 million equivalent. Relending to the \nPFIs  will  be  based  on  a  5-year  repayment  term  and  an  interest  rate  based  on  the  prevailing \nNational Bank of Tajikistan refinancing rate.13 Subloans to subborrowers will (i) cover a maximum \nof  90%  of  the  eligible  subproject  cost;  (ii)  be  for  amounts  of  up  to  TJS150,000;  (iii)  have  a \nrepayment term of up to 5 years; and (iv) carry a market-based interest rate. At least 50% of the \nsubloans will be for amounts of TJS5,000 or less, and at least 30% of the total number of subloans \nwill  be  to  women  or  organizations  having  substantial  female  ownership.  PFIs  will  undertake \nindependent  assessment  of  subborrowers,  including  creditworthiness.  All  proposed  subloans  in \nexcess  of  TJS100,000 will  require  ADB  approval  and  ADB  will  undertake  prior  review  of  the  first \nthree  subloans  issued  by  each  PFI  for  each  credit  line.  Following  project  completion,  MOF  will \nrecycle  the  credit  line  funds  for  the  same  purposes  as  utilized  under  the  project  for  a  minimum \nadditional period of 6 years.

Half of the total funds ($1.4 million) will be \nallocated  to  IMON  International  and  OXUS  in  equal  amounts.  The  remaining  total  funds  will  be \nallocated by MOF, subject to ADB concurrence, to selected and eligible MFIs. \n\n17. \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  of  civil  work  will \nrequire seven contracts totaling $10.3 million, comprising four contracts for irrigation and flood and \nmudflow  protection infrastructure  totaling  $7.5 million  with  international  competitive bidding,  three \ncontracts  for  water  supply  infrastructure,  of  which  two  contracts  totaling  $2.1  million  with \ninternational and one contract totalling $0.7 million with national competitive bidding. Procurement \nof  goods  will  require  seven  contracts  totaling  $1.8  million,  comprising  heavy  machinery  totaling \n$0.9 million and drip irrigation equipment totaling $0.6 million with international competitive bidding, \nand  vehicles  and  office  furniture  totaling  $0.3  million  with  shopping  method.  Procurement  of \nconsulting  services  totaling  $2.4  million  will  require  four  contracts  for  project  implementation \nsupport,  engineering  supervision,  and  capacity  building  of  community  organizations.  A \nprocurement plan is included in the project administration manual. \n\n18. \nThe  project  will  provide  management  support  and  assistance  to  ensure  that  project \nimplementation  fully  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  operational  requirements  in  terms  of \nfinancial  management,  fund  disbursement,  procurement  procedures,  social  and  environment \nsafeguards,  and  O&M.  This  will  include  external  financial  audit  and  monitoring  of  social  and \nenvironment safeguards. A team of international and national consultants  will be engaged by the \nexecuting  agencies  to  provide  management  support  during  project  implementation.  A  team  of \ninternational and national consultants from nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be engaged \nby  the  executing  agencies  to  carry  out  the  capacity  building  work  in  support  of  the  outputs.19  All \nconsultants and NGOs will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n\n19. \nAn estimated 229 person-months of consulting services will be required to support the PMO \nunder the MLRWR (31 person-months international, including 5 person-months from an NGO; 198 \nperson-months  national,  including  116  person-months  from  an  NGO)  to  (i)  facilitate  project \nmanagement  and  implementation,  (ii)  strengthen  the  institutional  and  operational  capacity  of  the \nexecuting  agency,  and  (iii)  carry  out  capacity  building  of  community  groups.  The  consulting \nservices will be provided by international consulting firms, national consulting firm(s), and NGO(s). \nAn  estimated  120  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  support  the  project \nimplementation  group  under  the  KMK  (18  person-months  international,  including  2.5  person-\n\n                                                \n17 Financial Analysis of Candidate Microfinance Institutions (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Microdeposit  Organization  IMON  International  and  Microloan  Organization  OXUS  are  limited  liability  companies \n\nestablished under the Law on Microfinance Organizations, 2012.  \n\n19 National  and  international  NGOs  have  long-standing  experience  of  mobilizing  and  increasing  resilience  to  climate \nchange  of  communities  in  the  Pyanj  River  Basin.

An estimated 87 person-months of consulting services will be required to support the PMO \nunder the MOF (10 person-months international, 77 person-months national) to (i) facilitate project \nmanagement  and  implementation,  (ii)  strengthen  the  institutional  and  operational  capacity  of  the \nexecuting  agency,  (iii)  carry  out  feasibility  studies  and  technical  assessments,  and  (iv)  build \ncapacity of PFIs and potential borrowers and savers. \n\n20. \nEach  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method \nwith  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  Full  technical  proposals  will  be  required  for  each  consulting \nservice  under  the  MLRWR  and  KMK.  Simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  required  for  each \nconsulting  service  under  the  MOF.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  to  be  engaged \nunder the project are in the project administration manual.  \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n21. \nA  climate  vulnerability,  impact,  and  adaptation  assessment  was  carried  out  to  identify \npriority communities that are particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change, with a focus \non  water  resources.  A  methodology  was  developed  to  identify  and  rank  the  most  vulnerable \ncommunities, and for each identified community prioritize adaptation measures (subprojects). Key \ncriteria  for  prioritizing  communities  included  (i)  exposure  (magnitude  and  frequency)  to  climate \nshocks  (drought,  flood,  mudslide,  etc.);  and  (ii)  technical,  financial,  and  human  capacity  to \nanticipate and manage climate risks. Key criteria for prioritizing subprojects included effectiveness \nin  reducing  climate  risks,  and  replication  potential.  Community  participation,  including  women, \nensured that perspectives and insights of people whose livelihoods are being affected by changes \nin climate are reflected in the specific adaptation measures under the project. \n\n22. \nA technical feasibility assessment was carried out to assess the technical feasibility of the \nsubprojects, including preliminary engineering design of the infrastructure components. Twenty-two \nsubprojects  were  selected  based  on  field  assessments  and  local  experience,  including  10  flood \nand  mudflow  subprojects,  5  irrigation  subprojects,  and  7  rural  drinking  water  supply  subprojects. \nThe  flood  and  mudflow  subprojects  will  comprise  (i)  constructing  and  upgrading  riverbank \nprotection,  including  forestation  of  embankments  and  soil  stabilization;  (ii)  providing  for  heavy \nmachinery  to  maintain  the  restored  flood  protection  and  irrigation  facilities;  (iii)  training  local \nauthorities  and  communities,  and  (iv)  establishing  early  warning  systems  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement  committees.  The  irrigation  subprojects  will  comprise  (i)  modernizing  and  climate-\nproofing irrigation infrastructure, (ii) modernizing and climate-proofing one existing pumping station \nand upstream delivery canal, (iii) constructing new infrastructure for piped drip-type irrigation, and \n(iv) agricultural extension services and training water users\u2019 associations. The rural drinking water \nsupply  subprojects  will  comprise  (i)  upgrading  ground  water  sources  and  protecting  them  from \nflood  risk  and  contamination,  (ii)  storage  equivalent  to  1  day\u2019s  demand,  (iii)  providing  dedicated \npumping mains, (iv) upgrading communal water points with self-closing taps, and (v) establishing \nand training water consumer groups. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nThe economic internal rate of return for the project was estimated at 18% and the economic \nnet  present  value  at  the  discount  rate  of  12%  was  $7.8  million.  The  project  will  bring  social \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f8      \n\n \n\nbenefits,  particularly  for  poorer  beneficiaries,  by  reducing  (i)  losses  of  agricultural  land,  personal \nproperty, houses, and livestock and consequent damage to family living conditions; (ii) declines in \nincome levels; (iii) emergence of disease; (iv) decrease in agricultural crop yields; (v) deterioration \nof  drinking  water;  and  (vi)  levels  of  migration.  The  project  is  likely  to  have  a  significant  positive \nimpact on agricultural productivities, soil and water resources, public health, and rural livelihoods.20 \n\n24. \nFinancial  and  integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted  on  four  MFIs  (para.  16).  The \nassessment comprised review of (i) credit and risk management policies, operating systems, and \nprocedures  to  prudently  make  loans;  (ii)  corporate  and  financial  governance  and  management \npractices;  (iii)  sound  business  objectives  and  strategy;  (iv)  ability  to  assess  creditworthiness  of \nborrowers  and  determine  market-based  loan  terms;  (v)  policies  and  measures  for  anti-money \nlaundering and combating the financing of terrorism; (vi) environment and social management; and \n(vii)  other  requirements. As  a result, two MFIs  have been  selected  to  participate  in the  project.  It \nwill be a condition of disbursement of credit line funds to PFIs that adequate anti-money laundering \nand combating the financing of terrorism customer due diligence measures are in place. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nAn  assessment  carried  out  from  January  to  March  2013  confirmed  that  the  executing \nagencies\u2019  procurement  capacity  and  financial  management  capacity  are  sufficient  to  manage \ninternational  procurement  and funds flow  arrangements,  accounting,  internal  and  external  audits, \nand  information.  Obstacles  identified  include  less  transparent  operations,  outdated  operational \ntools,  and  a  skills  gap.  Implementation  support  will  be  provided  by  consulting  services  to  ensure \nthat  the  project\u2019s  financial  management,  procurement,  accounting,  monitoring,  reporting,  and \nauditing requirements are met.  \n\n26. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  discussed  with  the  three \nexecuting  agencies  and  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.  \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  Tajikistan\u2019s  National  Development  Strategy,  2007-2015  and \nPoverty  Reduction Strategy,  2010\u20132012.  It  will  improve the  livelihoods  of  over  100,000  people  in \nthe Pyanj River Basin by reducing and reversing (i) livelihood losses and declining income levels, \n(ii) lack of access to essential services, (iii) employment-related out-migration, and (iv) vulnerability \nto waterborne diseases. Women are particularly vulnerable in the project areas. High rates of male \nmigration  have  resulted  in  high  engagement  of  the  female  population  in  agriculture.  However, \nwomen have little access to financial resources and information to switch to more climate-resilient \nlivelihoods.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender mainstreaming,  and includes a gender \naction  plan  to  ensure  women  are  actively  involved  in,  and  benefit  from,  all  project  components. \nWomen will benefit from the project through improved access to water resources for irrigation and \ndrinking water supply, enhanced knowledge of climate-resilient agriculture, and increased access \nto  micro  deposits  and  credit  lines  for  climate-resilient  economic  activities.  The  project  will  assist \nwomen  in  accessing  the  micro  credit  they  need  to  undertake  adaptive  measures  and  build \nresilience;  and  support  the  active  participation  of  women  in  irrigation  water  users\u2019  association, \ndisaster risk management committees, and drinking water consumer groups. \n\n                                                \n20 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  The  infrastructure  subprojects  are \nexpected to have limited site-specific adverse environmental impacts during both construction and \noperation,  and  are  located  outside  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Two  initial  environmental \nexaminations  have  been  prepared,  one  by  the  MLRWR  for  the  flood  protection  and  irrigation \nsubprojects  and  one  by  the  KMK  for  the  water  supply  subprojects,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Adequate  mitigation  measures  for  each  subproject  will  be \nthrough  site-specific  environmental  management  plans  based  on  generic \nimplemented \nenvironmental management plans for water supply, flood management, and irrigation components. \nSite-specific  environmental  management  plans  will  be  prepared  by  contractors,  and  approved  by \nthe PMO in the MLRWR and the project implementation group in the KMK. Consultants will assist \nthe MLRWR and KMK in strengthening institutional capacity to manage environmental impacts.  \n\n29. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  have  only  nonsignificant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts  and  is  classified  involuntary  resettlement  category  B,  according  to  the  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  engineering  design  of  the  infrastructure  subprojects  under  the  project  has \nnot  yet  advanced  to  a  stage  where  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  on  individual  or \ncollective  land  users  can  be  identified.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  has  been \nprepared  in  lieu  of  land  acquisition  resettlement  plans.21  During  project  implementation,  each \nsubproject  will  be  screened  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  For  subprojects  with \nsuch  impacts,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  before  the  commencement  of \ncivil  works.  For  subprojects  involving  the  rehabilitation  of  existing  facilities,  due  diligence  will  be \nconducted  to  determine  past  or  present  social  safeguard  concerns  and  to  identify  corrective \nactions,  as  necessary.  Capacity  building  on  social  safeguards  will  be  provided  to  the  executing \nagencies through ongoing ADB technical assistance.22  \n\nThe  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Project  preparation  activities \n\n30. \nhave determined that there will be no indigenous peoples issues associated with the project. \n\nBefore  receiving  their  first  disbursement  under  the  proposed  project,  PFIs  will  establish  a \n31. \nbasic environmental and social management system to screen out subprojects including activities \nlisted in ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List and posing more than minimal environmental \nand social risks.23 Each PFI will be required to designate at least one staff member responsible for \nthe  implementation  of  its  environmental  and  social  management  system.  Only  subprojects \ncategorized C for environment and social impacts will be eligible for financing under the project.  \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32. \nThe  project  carries  manageable  risks  that  will  be  mitigated  during  implementation.  Main \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.24 \n\n                                                \n21 ADB. 2008.
