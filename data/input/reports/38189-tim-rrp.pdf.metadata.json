The Project is \nbeing proposed under a sector modality. \n\nTimor-Leste is one of the least developed countries in the world. Per \ncapita  gross  domestic  product  (non-oil)  was  estimated  at  $370  in \n2006 and has fallen in most years since 2001. Timor-Leste\u2019s human \ndevelopment  index  remains  the  lowest  amongst  Southeast  Asian \ncountries. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for water \nsupply  in  Timor-Leste  is  to  increase  the  proportion  of  people  with \nimproved  access  to  water  from  44%  to  78%.  Coverage  of  24-hour \nsafe water supply in Dili city remains low at 25\u201330%. About 50% of \nthe water that is produced and distributed to Dili is lost through leaks \nand  pilferage.  Nonrevenue  water  is  about  85%.  The  Government\u2019s \ndraft  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  investment  plan  for  2008\u2013\n2012, will guide national budget decisions.  Dili is a priority district in \nthe  investment  plan.  The  Dili  water  supply  system  has  good  water \nproduction and good main distribution infrastructure. With reasonable \ninvestments  in  tertiary  distribution  and  more  attention  to  customer \nservice,  the  system  could  achieve  technical  and  financial  self-\nsustainability. The proposed sector Project is the first step. \n\nRationale \n\n\fThe proposed Project will use a zonal approach to totally rehabilitate \nthe  tertiary  network  and  connections  in  six  subzones,  each  with \n1,000  connections.  The  Government  will  use  its  own  finances  to \nimplement  the  zonal  approach  in  the  remainder  of  the  Dili  service \narea,  and  then  the  second  city,  Baucau,  followed  by  other  district \ntowns.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Dili  Water  Supply \nPerformance  Improvement  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  build \ncapacity in the National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation \nunaccounted-for-water \n(DNSAS) \nreduction; and better business planning, management and reporting. \nAnother  ADB  TA,  Infrastructure  Project  Management,  will  build \nproject  management  capacity  in  DNSAS,  including  for  managing \nenvironmental and social risks.  \n \nADB\u2019s country program and strategy update for 2006\u20132008 identifies \ninfrastructure development and management as the primary focus of \nADB support to Timor-Leste. As a post-conflict country, Timor-Leste \nis eligible for grant financing from the Asian Development Fund. \n\ndemand  management; \n\nfor \n\nThe  Project  is  expected  to  improve  water  supply  services  for \nhouseholds,  businesses  and  institutions  in  Dili  city.  The  expected \noutcome is improved hydraulic management of the Dili water supply \nsystem and more efficient tertiary distribution. \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $7.5  million,  including \ncontingencies, taxes and duties.  \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n\n \n\nTotal ($ million) \n6.0 \n1.5 \n7.5 \n\nPercent \n     80 \n     20 \n    100 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nProject Investment \nPlan  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nGrant Amount  \n\nA  grant  of  $6,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  will  be \ntotal  project  cost.

Before the Indonesian administration, Timor-Leste was a colony of Portugal for almost \n400 years. Infrastructure investment was scant during the Portuguese era. Likewise, water supply \nand sanitation services were limited, serving only certain parts of a few urban centers, including \nthe capital, Dili.  Under Indonesian administration from 1975 to 1999, East Timor benefited from \nlarge  centrally  financed  infrastructure  investments,  including  rural  and  urban  water  supply  and \nsanitation (WSS). A semi-autonomous local government water enterprise managed the Dili public \npiped  water  supply  system  and  was  supported  by  central  budget  subsidies  through  to  1999. \nNevertheless,  by  1998,  only  41%  of  Dili  residents  had  access  to  piped  water  of  varying  quality \nand reliability, and 44% still used shallow or deep wells.  \n \nThe Dili water enterprise and most district WSS facilities were badly damaged during the \n3. \nIndonesian  withdrawal  in  1999.  By  the  time  the  first  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project1 was approved in July 2000, emergency repairs had \nenabled  parts  of  the  Dili  water  supply  system  to  be  recommissioned.  A  second  phase  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project2 was approved in July 2001. The total budget of both \nphases  was  $9.0  million,  spread  across  all  13  districts.  In  addition  to  physical  rehabilitation  of \nwater  supplies,  the  WSS  Rehabilitation  projects  rehabilitated,  restored,  reequipped,  and  trained \nstaff of the newly constituted United Nations-administered Office of Water and Sanitation, which \nlater  became  the  Government  of  Timor-Leste\u2019s  Water  and  Sanitation  Service,  and  is  now  the \nNational  Directorate  for  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (DNSAS).  The  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  other  development \nassistance  agencies,  and  international  nongovernment  organizations,  also  invested  in  WSS \nrehabilitation in rural and urban areas. \n \n4. \nSupport  for  WSS  rehabilitation  in  Timor-Leste  since  2000,  including  the  two  ADB-\nimplemented  WSS  rehabilitation  projects  has  generally  only  been  partly  successful.3 The  main \nshortcoming\u2014as  it  was  during  the  Indonesian  administration\u2014has  been  lack  of  sustainability. \nCommunity-managed  systems  in  rural  areas  have  not  proven  sustainable.  And  inadequate \noperations and maintenance (O&M) funding and expertise have reduced returns on urban water \nsupply investments. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for access to safe water in \nTimor-Leste  are  to  increase  access  in  rural  areas  from  51%  in  2001  to  75%  in  2015;  and  from \n72%  to  86%  in  urban  areas.  But  many  rural  water  supply  systems  have  failed  and  urban  water \nsupplies are typically intermittent and of varying quality. DNSAS estimates that in 2007, access to \nclean water supply is approximately 43% nationally, 45% in urban and peri-urban areas, and 41% \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2000.

Although the statistical disparities partly result from definitional inconsistencies, the \nMDG baseline estimates are likely too high.    \n \n5. \nSince 2000, about $30 million has been invested in Dili for water production, primary and \nsecondary  distribution,  and  connections;  $5  million  has  been  spent  on  establishing  and \nstrengthening DNSAS. Despite this, less than 30% of Dili households enjoy a 24-hour safe water \nsupply, compared with the Government\u2019s National Development Plan (NDP) target of 80% of the \nurban  population  with  access  to  a safe  piped water  supply  by  2020.4 More  than  50%  of  the  Dili \nwater supply system experiences high leakage, low or variable pressure, and intermittent supply \nwith  water  available  for  between  3  and  16  hours  per  day.  Complaints  of  no  water  and  low \npressure  make  up  one  third  of  consumer  complaints.  Water  sources,  treatment  plants,  and \ntransmission mains have sufficient capacity to meet Dili city\u2019s water needs for several years. The \nprimary and secondary distribution system is now in generally good condition. The poor service is \nlargely  caused  by  (i)  lack  of  tertiary  pipes  (reticulation),  (ii)  poor  condition  of  tertiary  pipes  and \nservice  connections,  and  (iii)  inadequate  demand  management.  In  August  2007,  with  no  water \nbills being issued by DNSAS and no payments made by consumers, nonrevenue water (NRW)5 \nwas  technically  100%.  However,  an  estimated  total  of  15%  of  all  water  supplied  to  the  Dili  city \nwater  supply  was  reticulated  through  consumers\u2019  meters,  and  if  this  water  had  been  billed  and \npaid  for,  NRW  would  stand  at  85%.  Meanwhile,  unaccounted  for  water6 is  estimated  at  70%  in \nFY2007. By comparison, average NRW for urban water supplies in Southeast Asian countries is \n29%. This is discussed in the Dili City Water Supply Study (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n6. \nImproving water supplies in Dili is now an urgent priority: (i) Dili\u2019s water supply operations \nare Timor-Leste\u2019s biggest drain on WSS sector financial, technical and management resources, \nand divert resources away from small towns and rural areas; (ii) returns on investments by JICA \nand  others  are  low  but  could  be  greatly  increased  by  relatively  modest  investments  in  Dili\u2019s \ntertiary  network;  (iii)  Dili  has  the  most  potential  in  Timor-Leste  to  be  a  successful  and  self-\nsustaining  water  supply  operation;  (iv)  rural\u2013urban  migration  in  Timor-Leste  is  rapid  and  Dili  is \ngrowing fast; and (iv) donor attention is almost entirely on rural, not urban WSS.    \n \n7. \nThe  sector  Project  will  complete  the  vertical  integrity  of  Dili\u2019s  water  supply  system  in \nselected  zones,  and  improve  system  management  and  customer  relations  in  order  to  achieve \nefficient delivery to regularized customers, including low-income households.  \n \nB. \n\n \nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nAs  a \n\nrecently \n\nindependent,  post-conflict  county,  Timor-Leste \n\n8. \nfaces  uncommon \ndevelopment  challenges.  The  first  constitutional  Government  after  independence  adopted  the \nNDP 2002\u20132020, which incorporates a national poverty reduction strategy. The new Government \nis preparing a 5-year NDP for 2008\u20132012. The previous system of annually updated 5-year rolling \nsector investment plans, and annual action plans is under review. The planning is sound, but the \ndifficulty  is  translating  these  plans  and  programs  into  tangible  benefits  for  ordinary  citizens.  For \nthe  WSS  sector,  and  specifically  for  urban  water  supply,  achieving  tangible,  sustainable \ndevelopment  results  is  constrained  by  (i)  inadequate  capital  investment;  (ii)  inadequate  O&M \nfunding;  (iii)  limited  human  resources  to  plan,  implement  and  manage  water  supplies;  and  (iv) \ndifficult customer relations. Finally, the 2006 political crisis and civil unrest severely damaged the \nGovernment\u2019s ability to deliver public services, particularly in Dili and specifically water supplies.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Planning Commission of East Timor. 2002. East Timor National Development Plan. Dili. \n5  Nonrevenue  water is measured as the difference between water supplied and  water sold (i.e., billed irrespective of \n\nwhether it is paid for or not) expressed as a percentage of water supplied by the water production facilities. \n\n6  Unaccounted-for water is water that is lost to the system through leaks and pilferage. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n1. \n\nProblems \n\n9. \nInadequate  Capital  Investment.  Approximately  $55  million  was  spent  on  urban  water \nsupply investments from 2000 to 2007, mostly funded by donors, notably contributors to the Trust \nFund for East Timor, and JICA, German Technical Cooperation, Portugal Cooperation, and other \nofficial  and  nongovernment  agencies  and  organizations.  With  increasing  fiscal  strength,  the \nGovernment has started appropriating budgets for urban water supply capital works, amounting to \nabout $500,000 annually. The funding has been sufficient only to rehabilitate high priority facilities \nsuch  as  deep  wells,  water  intakes,  transmission  mains,  water  treatment  plants,  and  primary \ndistribution mains in Dili and some  district centers. Funding has been inadequate to rehabilitate \nsecondary  and  tertiary  distribution. Suboptimal  investment  strategies  have  exacerbated  the  lack \nof  funding.  First,  capital  works  focused  on  upstream  facilities  before  rehabilitating  downstream \nnetworks,  meaning  that the  additional  water  produced  is  mostly  lost.  Second,  investments  have \nbeen  spread  too  thinly,  resulting  in  only  partial  rehabilitation  of  many  systems  that  still  cannot \noperate effectively. These strategies have had a damaging financial impact on DNSAS, as legal \nwater sales decline while water production costs increase.     \n \nInadequate Operations and Maintenance Funding. Legal water sales cover only 5% of \n10. \nDNSAS  operating  costs,  leaving  O&M  funding  almost  completely  reliant  on  Government \nsubsidies.  In  FY2007,  $1.8  million  was  budgeted  for  urban  water  and  sanitation  recurrent \nexpenses across Dili, Baucau and 11 other district centers. About 60% is directly allocated for Dili \nwater  supply  O&M.  This  equates  to  about  $0.11  per  cubic  meter  (m3)  of  water  produced, \ncompared  with  the  Southeast  Asian  average  of  $0.19/m3.  The  net  result  is  accelerated \ndegradation  of  plant,  equipment,  pipes  and  fittings;  and  an  inexorable  decline  in  system \nfunctionality and service quality.  \n \n11. \nLimited  Human  Resources.  DNSAS  has  a  staff  cap  of  174  full-time  regular  staff;  \ncurrently 155 positions are filled. It also retains 54 temporary staff. Of these, 77 permanent and \n19 temporary staff members are employed at Dili locations. Nevertheless, with a bias in favor of \nDili operations, DNSAS has a relatively high number of staff per 1,000 connections ratio of 10.5 \nfor  Dili.  But  the  measure  excludes  possibly  thousands  of  unauthorized  water  connections, \nmeaning that the actual ratio is significantly lower. The larger problem is that many staff members \nhave  limited  water  supply  experience  and  qualifications,  especially  in  critical  areas  such  as \nsystem hydraulic planning and management, and leak detection. DNSAS also has too few field-\nbased caretakers who can intensively monitor water supplies.  \n \n12. \nDifficult Customer Relations. DNSAS receives about 180 complaints per month from Dili \ncustomers,  about  lack  of  water,  no  meter,  broken  meter,  leaks,  low  pressure,  and  dirty  water. \nAccountability  to  service  users  is  limited:  for  instance,  receipt  of  customer  service  requests  and \ncomplaints is restricted to business hours and only available in one location. Service quality is not \nroutinely monitored, and no standards have been developed for response times. DNSAS does not \nsurvey  or  methodically  solicit  the  view  of  its  customers.  Invoicing  and  payment  arrangements \nwere  not  \u201cconsumer-friendly\u201d  when  consumers  were  being  billed  for  water  for  a  period  of \napproximately 16 months up to April 2006. DNSAS management is aware of these shortcomings \nbut lacks the resources to address them. \n \n13. \n2006  National  Crisis. Following the 2006 political crisis and civil disturbances, some Dili \nneighborhoods remain openly hostile to officials and outsiders, they are unwilling to cooperate on \npublic  goods  issues,  and  have  reduced  incomes.  The  disturbances  affected  DNSAS  staff  and \nmanagement  personally  degraded  overall  DNSAS  capability  and  destroyed  and  damaged \nDNSAS valves, meters, and pipes. For several months after May 2006, DNSAS in Dili operated \non an emergency footing as it struggled to keep water production and distribution from collapsing \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\fcompletely, and meanwhile worked with aid agencies to deliver water and sanitation services to \n70,000  internally  displaced  persons  in  a  dozen  camps.  DNSAS  is  recovering  and  with  the \npresence of international forces Dili is mostly calm, but the situation is not fully normalized. \n \nImplications for Economic Development and Poverty. Unreliable urban water supply is \n14. \none  of  several  constraints  slowing  economic  development  in  Dili  and  other  urban  centers.  The \nconstraining  effects  of  water  supplies  cannot  be  quantified,  suffice  that  it  is  probably  a  lesser \nconstraint  than  the  difficulty  of  doing  business,  legal  risks,  high  economic  costs,  low  skills,  and \nunreliable  electric  power.  More  important  is  the  strong  link  between  urban  water  supplies  and \npoverty in Timor-Leste. Approximately 75% of Dili residents live in low-income informal areas with \nthe  lowest  water  supply  service.  Unreliable  or  nonexistent  piped  water  supply  increases  their \nfinancial costs of obtaining clean water, increases morbidity and health costs, and requires time \nfor water collection and transportation.  \n \n \n\nOpportunities \n\n2. \n\n15. \nNational  Planning  Context.  Timor-Leste subscribes to the MDG targets for WSS; has a \nwell-formulated  NDP  with  an  embedded  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  with  WSS  targets; \nhas  an  annually  updated  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  program;  and  has  WSS  policies \ncovering, for instance, service requirements for different classes of customers and beneficiaries in \ndifferent  geographic  contexts.  An  NDP  objective  is  to  provide  adequate,  safe,  and  sustainable \nwater  supplies  for  Dili  communities  and  major  urban  centers  in  the  districts,  with  the  aim  of  full \ncost recovery from the users of the water supply (NDP footnotes, p. 275). The NDP 2020 target \n(recently brought forward to 2015) is for 80% of Timor-Leste\u2019s urban population to have access to \nsafe  piped  water  (NDP  page  280).  The  target  implies  24-hour  continuous  service  to  household \nconnections.  Listed  NDP  projects  include  (i)  capital  works,  rehabilitation  of  Dili  headworks  and \ndistribution;  (ii)  O&M  and  service  improvements  of  new  connections  in  Dili;  and  (iii)  resolution, \nremoval  of  illegal  connections  in  Dili.  The  draft  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  investment \nprogram  2008\u20132012  provides  for  accelerated WSS  investments  in  six  priority  districts,  including \nDili  and  Baucau.  Appendix  2  provides  an  analysis  of  the  WSS  sector  in  Timor-Leste,  detailing \nespecially the situation in Dili. \n \nLessons  Learned.  Regional  experience 7  clearly  indicates  that  good  governance  and \n16. \nadequate operating revenues are crucial prerequisites for sustaining good urban water supplies, \nespecially for the underserved poor. This applies to DNSAS, but the way forward is complicated \nby the post-crisis social and economic situation in Dili. The ADB project performance audit report \nfor phases I and II of the Water Supply and Sanitation Project (footnote 3) notes that investments \nwere  spread  too  thinly  across  too  many  subprojects,  which  ultimately  reduced  development \nresults.  The  report  notes  the  failure  to  re-impose  charges  for  urban  water  services.  It \nrecommends  that  ADB  support  urban  WSS  investments  rather  than  rural,  as  well  as  DNSAS \ncapacity building.   \n \n17. \nOptions and Asian Development Bank Strategy. Most donor support for WSS in Timor-\nLeste targets rural areas; soon, no major support for urban WSS will be ongoing or planned. ADB \nsupport  for  urban  water  supply  is  needed  to  help  the  Government  achieve  its  NDP  and  MDG \ntargets; this is consistent with the PPAR recommendation.  \n \n18. \nDonor  support  for  urban  water  supply  in  Timor-Leste  has  been  spread  over  too  many \nsystems and across too much of each system. Only some components of each system have been \n\n                                                 \n7  McIntosh,  A.  2003.  Asian  Water  Supplies:  Reaching  the  Urban  Poor.  Manila.  Asian  Development  Bank  and \n\nInternational Water Association Publishing. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fimproved  (typically  upstream  facilities)  and  these  incomplete  systems  have  not  been  able  to \nsustain  improved  water  supplies  to  most  households.  Also,  DNSAS  lacks  the  resources  to \nproperly  operate  and  maintain  the  Dili  and  12  district  urban  systems.  Learning  from  this  and \nglobal experience, the preferred approach is to concentrate efforts in Dili first; and to use a zonal \napproach to solving Dili\u2019s water supply problems. While Dili is presently DNSAS\u2019s biggest drain on \nresources,  it  could  be  DNSAS\u2019s  largest  water  sales  market,  able  eventually  to  cross-subsidize \nsanitation and poorer rural water supply operations. The zonal approach concentrates efforts on \njust a few hydraulically defined zones at a time, getting them operating properly, and then moving \non to the next zone(s) to be upgraded. The process is gradually introduced through a city until the \nentire  system  is  functioning  efficiently.  The  zonal  approach  suits  ADB\u2019s  sector  grant  modality \nsince it takes a geographic slice and a time slice (2008\u20132010) of the Government\u2019s urban water \nsupply  development  program  guided  by  the  draft  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  investment \nplan 2008\u20132012. Once demonstrated as an effective approach, it will be refined and implemented \nthroughout  the  rest  of  Dili,  in  Baucau,  and  in  other  district  centers  funded  mostly  by  the \nGovernment under an accelerated NDP.  \n \n19.  Wastewater  collection  and  disposal  is  almost  entirely  a  private  responsibility  in  Timor-\nLeste  cities  and  towns.  No  sewerage  or  government-operated  communal  septic  tanks  are \navailable. Households and businesses provide for their own on-site treatment and disposal, with \nvarying  effectiveness  and  adequacy;  only  one  government-operated  septage8 treatment  facility \nserves  Dili.  DNSAS  currently  lacks  the  financial  and  technical  capacity  to  develop  and  manage \npublic wastewater management systems. This undesirable situation will have to be addressed as \nsettlement  densities  increase  in  Dili.  But  for  now,  efforts  should  focus  on  improving  hydraulic \nmanagement and reducing water losses in Dili. This involves no increase in water supplied to the \nurban area and therefore no additional wastewater. \n \n20. \nImproving water supplies in Dili will need to reflect post-crisis political, technical, financial \nand  social  realities.  A  conventional  strategy  to  mass  install  meters  and  bill  and  collect  from  all \ncustomers will not be immediately practical. While political will to immediately improve DNSAS is \nstrong,  improving  revenue  performance  requires  a  more  gradual  and  selective  strategy.  Since \nmetering,  billing  and  collecting  are  important  demand  management  elements,  the  postcrisis \nenvironment  in  Dili  poses  special  challenges  for  sustaining  water  supply  improvements.  A  start \ncan  be  made  with  commercial  and  bulk  customers  and  relatively  well-off  households  in  formal \nneighborhoods.  \n \n21. \nThe  Government  has  a  long-term  aim  to  build  financial  and  administrative  autonomy  in \nDNSAS,  possibly  as  a  public  corporation  utilizing  a  management  contract.  A  technically  and \nfinancially  successful  Dili  water  supply  operation  is  essential  for  achieving  this.  ADB  has \napproved  a  technical  assistance  (TA) 9 to  improve  the  performance  of  the  Dili  water  supply, \ncomplementing  the  Project.  The  opportunities  and  recommendations  for  DNSAS  performance \nimprovement are discussed in Appendix 3 and elaborated in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n22. \nExternal Assistance. Since 2003, only the Government of Japan and JICA have financed \nmajor  water  supply  investments  in  Dili;  the  Government  of  Portugal  through  Aguas  de  Portugal \nTimor-Leste, and the German Technical Cooperation upgraded components of the water supply \nsystem in the second city, Baucau. JICA\u2019s program in Dili is now complete, having rehabilitated all \nthe  city\u2019s  smaller  water  treatment  plants  and  built  a  new  central  water  treatment  plant  with  a \ncapacity  of  6,000  m3  per  day.  Distribution  has  been  improved  to  all  of  Dili\u2019s  10  water  supply \nzones,  but  there  was  only  limited  work  on  tertiary  distribution  to  consumers  within  zones. \n                                                 \n8  Septage is the sludge removed from household, commercial, and communal septic tanks. \n9  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to Timor-Leste for Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement. Manila. \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\fAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development,  ADB,  Aguas  de  Portugal,  and  JICA  are \nproviding  capacity  building  support  for  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  (MOI)  and  DNSAS  (urban), \nincluding  sector  policy  development,  water  catchment  management,  water  supply  system \nmanagement, and water supply technician training. External assistance to the urban water supply \nsector in Timor-Leste is set out in Appendix 4.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n23. \nThe  intended  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  water  supply  services  for  households, \nbusinesses and institutions in Dili city. The intended outcome is improved hydraulic management \nof  the  Dili  city  water  supply  system  and  more  efficient  tertiary  distribution.  The  project  area \ncomprises all 10 water supply zones of the Dili city water supply service area. Within the project \narea, tertiary distribution improvements will be concentrated in six subzones together comprising \napproximately 12% of the total service area, 31% of the total population of the service area, 30% \nof total connections, and 21% of the total water supplied. The six target subzones are all supplied \nby  the  primary  and  secondary  tertiary  distribution  system,  have  a  mix  of  consumer  types, \ncomprise  about  60%  low  income  households, are  less  affected  by  ongoing  civil  unrest,  and  are \ntechnically suited to improved hydraulic control and tertiary distribution.  The sector Project takes \na  time  slice  and  a  geographic  slice  of  the  Government\u2019s  draft  2008\u20132012  sector  investment \nprogram to improve water supply services across all of Dili city and Baucau. ADB has approved \nTA  projects10   which  will  ensure  that  the  Government  has  the  necessary  capacity  to  implement \nthe sector program.   \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n24. \nThe Project\u2019s outputs in six subzones of three target water supply zones will be replicated \nprogressively  across  Dili\u2019s  remaining  seven  zones,  the  Baucau  city  service  area,  and  in  other \ndistrict  centers.  The  Project  has  three  components:  (component  1)  subzone  water  supplies\u2014\nwater losses reduced and controlled in subzones of three target water supply zones; (component \n2) citywide water supplies\u2014visible leaks reduced and strategic improvements to the pipe network, \nand  commercial  and  bulk  customers  metered  in  all  10  zones;  and  (component  3)  capacity \nbuilding\u2014skill  of  DNSAS  technical  and  O&M  staff  upgraded  in  leak  detection,  leak  reduction, \ndistribution planning, and distribution management. Key activities include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSubzone  water  supplies.  Plan,  design  and  implement  leak  detection,  reduction, \nand control program, together with the DNSAS demand management (NRW) task \nforce,11 and help DNSAS recruit and train three leak detection teams. Procure and \ninstall  pipes,  fittings,  and  other  materials,  including  minor  trenching;  and  inspect, \nrepair or replace faulty distribution valves and bulk meters. Create physical zones \nand subzones by installing valves and other works. Connect un-served households \nand businesses. Inspect, replace or install meters on all authorized connections in \ntarget zones. \nCity-wide  water  supplies.  Identify  and  repair  visible  leaks  and  open  pipe \ndischarges.  Inspect,  replace,  or  install  meters  on  all  authorized  commercial  and \nbulk  connections.  Repair  or  replace  unserviceable  chlorination  equipment  at \n\n                                                 \n10  Footnote  9  and  ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to  Timor-Leste  for  Infrastructure  Project  Management  (TA  4942-\n\nTIM, cofinanced by the Government of Australia). Manila. \n\n11  The  DNSAS  demand  management  task  force  will  be  established  with  support  from  the  Dili  Water  Supply \n\nPerformance Improvement TA (footnote 9). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\ngroundwater  sources.  Relocate  existing  water  service  connections  to  allow  the \ndisconnection of old leaking water mains. \nCapacity  building  (in  addition  to  the  ADB  TA  4869-TIM:  Dili  Water  Supply \nPerformance Improvement TA [footnote 9]). Provide formal training and on-the-job \ntraining  for  leak  detection  teams,  and  ongoing  support  and  on-the-job  training  in \ndistribution planning and management. \n\n \nC. \n\nAsian Development Fund IX Grant Component  \n\nThe  entire  ADB  contribution  will  be  an  Asian  Development  Fund  IX  grant.  As  a  low- \n25. \nincome,  post-conflict  country,  Timor-Leste  is  eligible  for  Asian  Development  Fund  IX  grants \nequivalent  to  40%  of  its  overall  ADF  IX  entitlement.  The  Government  has  no  experience  and \nlimited capacity to manage external debt. Because of the post-crisis situation in Dili, the Project\u2019s \nfinancial  rate  of  return  will  be  relatively  low.  Most  direct  beneficiaries  will  be  low-income \nhouseholds.  \n \n26. \nThe Project justifies Asian Development Fund grant assistance, even for a fiscally strong \ngovernment. First, financing the Project enables ADB to help apply, refine, and demonstrate an \napproach  to  improving  urban  water  supplies,  where  there  currently  is  no  approach.  The  sector \nmodality will allow lessons learned from the three core subprojects to be designed into the three \nfollow-on  candidate  subprojects;  and  for  the  approach  to  be  replicated  using  Government \nresources  throughout  the  urban  water  supply  sector.  Second,  the  Project  is  a  vehicle  for \ndelivering  on-the-job  and  classroom  capacity  building  essential  for  permanently  reducing  water \nlosses.     \n \nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n27. \nPost  Conflict  Support. Preparation of the Project was suspended in mid-2006 because \nof civil unrest throughout Dili and the emergency pressures on the implementing agency, DNSAS. \nEighteen  months  later,  the  United  Nations  retains  executive  policing  powers,  particularly  in  Dili, \nand  armed  foreign  troops  provide  a  stabilization  force.  About  40,000  residents  of  Dili  remain \ndisplaced,  and  some  neighborhoods  are  hostile  to  outsiders  and  officials.  The  project  design \nadapts  to  these  challenges.  The  project  scope  and  approach  is  simplified  by  (i)  focusing  on \nimproving water supplies to consumers in areas already served, albeit poorly; (ii) not attempting \nto  expand  the  Dili  service  area;  (iii)  not  introducing  new  community-based  management \narrangements or innovations, particularly for informal neighborhoods; and (iv) limiting early billing \nand  collection  efforts  to  commercial,  institutional,  and  large  customers.  Since  no  extra  water  is \nprovided  to  the  service  area,  no  sanitation  component  is  included.  Zone  selection  considers \nneighborhood stability and security.     \n \n28. \nComplementing  JICA  Investments.  JICA  and  the  Government  of  Japan  have  funded \napproximately  $25  million  equivalent  of  rehabilitation  and  improvements  to  the  Dili  water  supply \nsystem  since  2000.  These  investments  ensure  that  an  adequate  supply  of  clean  and  reliable \nwater can now be distributed to most zones. The Project builds on this by ensuring this water is \ndelivered legally and accountably to customers in three of the zones, and thereafter to customers \nin all zones.  \n \n29. \nZonal  Approach,  Leak  Detection  Teams,  and  Caretakers.  The  zonal  approach  will \nmaximize  development  results  by  getting  the  system  functioning  correctly  in  subzones  in  three \ntarget  water  supply  zones.  Consumers  in  other  zones  will  demand  the  same.  The  Project  will \nprovide  demand  management  specialists  and  leak  detection  technicians  with  water  utility \noperations experience to train and give hands-on support to DNSAS\u2019s three leak detection teams. \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\fThe  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement  TA  (footnote  9)  will  help  DNSAS  recruit  and \ntrain six subzone caretakers (approximately one caretaker per 1,000 connections) who will work \nalongside  project  staff  in  the  field.  Each  subzone  caretaker  will  be  responsible  for  managing \nO&M, NRW control, and customer relations in the concerned subzone. \n \n30. \nSustainability.  The  Project  and  the  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement    TA \nincorporate measures to ensure the project outcome is sustained beyond project completion: (i) \nthe  demand  management  task  force  that  the  TA  will  help  establish  within  DNSAS  will  be \nmandated to work to reduce NRW in other zones in Dili, (ii) the Project will plan and prepare work \nplans and targets for NRW reduction in the next target zones, (iii) leak detection teams will have \ntheir contracts extended or will be recruited as DNSAS staff, (iv) MOI and DNSAS will outsource \nmost  NRW  work,  and  (v)  permanent  subzone  caretakers  will  continue  NRW  monitoring  and \ncontrol in the completed sub-zones. Learning from earlier project experiences, sustainability will \nbe enhanced by appropriate targeting of project resources.    \n \n31. \nAlignment  with  Government  Procedures  and  Systems.  The  Project  will  not  have  a \nseparate  project  management  unit.  The  project  team  leader  will  work  within  the  Dili  Water  and \nSanitation Division, DNSAS; project team technical staff will work in the divisions and units of their \ndirect DNSAS counterparts; and procurement and financial management project staff will work in \nthe Corporate Services Directorate of MOI. This approach will ensure that skills and technology \nare passed on to DNSAS and MOI staff.    \n \n32. \nFinancing  Arrangements.  Use  of  the  sector  modality  will  give  DNSAS  financing \npredictability  while  ensuring  sufficient  flexibility  to  sequence  tertiary  distribution  upgrading \naccording  to  prevailing  conditions,  which  can  be  less  predictable.  With  project  experience  for \nthree  zones  in  Dili,  DNSAS  will  be  able  to  accurately  define  scope  and  estimate  costs  for \nimplementing the program through the remaining seven zones in Dili, Baucau, and elsewhere. \n \nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n33. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $7.5  million,  including  contingencies,  and \ntaxes  and  duties  of  $0.275  million.  The  project  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1  and \ndetailed in Appendix 5.   \n \nF. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n34. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $6,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  to  finance  80%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining \n$1,500,000 (20%).

MOI  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  responsible  for  overall  project  management.  DNSAS \nwill be the Implementing Agency, responsible for day-to-day project implementation. To the extent \npossible,  project  management  will  align  with  existing  MOI  and  DNSAS  structures  and  use  their \nsystems  and  processes.  No  separate  and  distinct  project  management  unit  will  be  set  up.  The \nproject team will be headed by a long-term international project team leader who will be located \nwithin the Dili Water and Sanitation Division, DNSAS. The project team will comprise (i) two water \nsupply  engineers  (including  the  project  team  leader)  undertaking  planning,  preparing  bid \ndocuments,  and  managing  contracts,  and  who  will  be  located  in  the  Dili  Water  and  Sanitation \nDivision,  DNSAS;  (ii)  two  financial  management  specialists  will  be  located  within  the  MOI \nCorporate Services Directorate; and (iii) two monitoring and evaluation specialists will be located \nwithin  the  Development  and  Planning  Division  of  DNSAS.  Project-funded  procurement  will  be \nhandled by the Procurement Division, within MOI, with support from the project team. The project \nteam leader will be responsible for coordinating all project inputs and will oversee and contribute \nto  (i)  bidding  processes,  (ii)  contract  management,  (iii)  implementation  progress  monitoring,  (iv) \npreparation  of  withdrawal  applications,  (v)  preparation  of  project  progress  reports  and  project \ncompletion  report,  (vi)  maintenance  of  project  accounts  and  grant  financial  records  for  auditing, \nand  (vii)  monitoring  of  the  Project\u2019s  socioeconomic  impacts.  The  project  team  leader  will  report \n\n \n\n\fdirectly  to  DNSAS  director  and  to  the  MOI  director  of  Corporate  Services.  Outline  terms  of \nreference for consulting services are presented in Appendix 6. \n \nThe  ADB  Infrastructure  Project  Management  TA  (footnote  10)  will  support  project \n36. \nmanagement of the Government-funded infrastructure capital program. This capacity-building TA \nwill place project management engineers, procurement specialists, and other specialists in MOI. \nA  TA-funded  procurement  specialist  will  be  available  to  assist  the  project  team  and  the \nProcurement Division of the MOI  Corporate Services Directorate undertake procurement for the \nto  help  DNSAS  undertake \nProject.  TA-funded  safeguard  specialists  will  be  available \nenvironmental and social impact assessment and management for the Project.  \n \n37. \nThe  results  of  the  financial  management  assessment  (FMA),  which  was  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005)  during  project \npreparation, are summarized in Appendix 3. The sector Project's capacity-building component is \ndesigned  to  address  weaknesses  identified  by  assessment.  These  initiatives  will  supplement \nsupport from the Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement TA to strengthen DNSAS corporate \ngovernance  and  financial  management  capacity.  As  a  consequence  of  these  initiatives  and  the \nseparate  accounting  arrangements  recommended,  the  proposed  project  financial  management \narrangements for the Project are considered satisfactory. \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation and Selection \n\n38. \nCandidate Subproject Preparation. Three core subprojects have been identified, one in \neach of the three target water supply zones. Procedures for the selection of target water supply \nzones  and  subproject  subzones  are  explained  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Both  the  water \nsupply  zones  within  the  Dili  water  supply  system  and  the  subproject  subzones  were  selected \npartly  for  their  hydraulic  properties  within  the  pipe  network.  The  work  within  the  subzones  is \ndetailed in the subproject appraisal reports (Supplementary Appendix D) and involves a technical \nand  customer-based  approach  to  implementing  a  total  management  package  for  water  supply \nwithin the subzones. Work will include (i) the installation of bulk meters to measure water supplied \nto  the  subzone;  (ii)  repair,  replacement,  or  installation  of  tertiary  water  pipes  servicing  the \nsubzone;  (iii)  repair,  replacement,  or  installation  of  metered  water  service  connections  to  all \nconsumers with immediate access to tertiary mains; (iv) refurbishment or installation of communal \nwater  facilities  to  serve  consumers  without  immediate  access  to  tertiary  water  mains;  and  (v) \nsignificant customer and consumer consultation and preparation.  \n \n39. \nThree additional candidate subprojects were identified and will be confirmed during project \nimplementation  based  on  technical,  social,  and  other  considerations.  Sequencing  will  not  be  a \nsignificant  issue  since  the  entire  Project  will  be  completed  in  29  months.  The  project  team  will \nhelp DNSAS prepare a subproject appraisal report for each candidate subproject. Each appraisal \nreport  will  provide  technical  analysis  and  description,  rationale,  scope  and  components,  cost \nestimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, an initial environmental examination, \na resettlement plan, if required, and social and poverty impact assessment. The level of analysis \nand detail will be consistent with the size and characteristics of the subproject and the capacity of \nDNSAS to manage a similar program in other zones after project completion. DNSAS will submit \neach  appraisal  report  for  review  and  approval  by  ADB  on  a  no-objection  basis.  Implementation \nmay proceed after endorsement by ADB and the MOI minister.  \n \nA  feasibility  study  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  was  prepared  for  project  activities  to \n40. \noperate throughout the Dili water supply system. This work will involve the (i) repair of all obvious \nleaks;  (ii)  repair  or  replacement  of  existing  stop  valves  and  bulk  meters,  as  necessary,  and  the \ninstallation  of  additional  stop  valves  and  bulk  meters  to  enhance  system  management;  (iii) \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEligibility  Criteria. DNSAS and MOI, in consultation with the project team, will appraise \n\ntransfer of service connections from old pipes to parallel new pipes to allow the disconnection of \nthe old pipes; and (iv) metering of all commercial premises and bulk water outlets.   \n \n41. \nsubprojects in accordance with eligibility criteria and procedures outlined in Appendix 7. \n \n42. \nSubproject  and  Safeguard  Plan  Approvals.  Subprojects  are  not  expected  to  require \nland acquisition or resettlement but a precautionary land acquisition and resettlement framework \n(LARF)  was  prepared.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  (EARP)  provides \nguidance  for  preparing  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  candidate  subprojects,  and \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  institutional  responsibilities  for  environmental  management  of  the \nProject. Prior to the signing of supply and civil works contracts and the commencement of works \nand installation, MOI will submit to ADB for review and no-objection approval, the IEE related to \nthe subprojects. No indigenous peoples reside in Dili city as minority groups and no indigenous \npeoples  will  be  affected  by  project  activities.  Accordingly,  no  indigenous  peoples  plan  was \nprepared. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n43. \nProject implementation is scheduled to commence on 1 July 2008 and to operate over a \nperiod of twenty-nine months until 30 November 2010. Preconstruction activities for the three core \nsubprojects\u2014detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  tendering,  and  awarding  of \ncontracts for the first batch of subprojects\u2014will start around August 2008. Commencement of civil \nworks  is  targeted  for  January  2009,  with  completion  in  November  2010.  The  implementation \nschedule is attached as Appendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n44. \nThe  equipment,  materials,  and  works  financed by  the  proceeds  of  the ADB  grant  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  \n \n45. \nADB\u2019s standard bid documents will be used for procuring ADB-financed goods and works. \nBefore commencement of national competitive bidding procurement, ADB and the grant recipient \nwill  review  the  grant  recipient\u2019s  procurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB \nrequirements. Any necessary modifications or clarifications of the grant recipient\u2019s procedure will \nbe  documented  in  the  procurement  plan.  Requirement  of  any  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement plans (EMMPs) will be reflected in all civil works bidding and contract documents. \nProject implementation consultants will be recruited as soon as possible after grant effectiveness. \nThe procurement plan outlines (i) particular contracts for goods and works, (ii) proposed method \nfor procurement of goods and works financed by ADB, and (iii) related ADB review procedures. \nMOI,  with  ADB  approval,  will  update  the  procurement  plan  as  needed  for  the  duration  of  the \nProject. The procurement plan and contract packages are detailed in Appendix 9. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsulting  services  are  organized \n\n46. \nfor  project \nin \nimplementation  support  will  engage  international  and  national  consultants  for  (i)  project \nmanagement;  (ii)  in-field  mentoring  of  leak  detection  teams  and  subzone  caretakers;  (iii) \nsocioeconomic  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  (iv)  project  financial  management,  reporting  and \nauditing.  The  second  package  will  engage  international  and  national  consultants  to  prepare \ndetailed  engineering  design  and  documentation,  and  undertake  construction  supervision. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \n\ntwo  packages.  The  package \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\fConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by \nfirms  selected  through  international  competition  using  quality-and-cost-based  selection  with  a \nquality  to  cost  weighting  of  80:20.  A  total  of  104  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired for project implementation.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n47. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  MOI  and  DNSAS.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  grant  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  Building  customer \nawareness  and  empowerment  can  reduce  the  risk  of  corruption  in  water  supply  projects  and \nservice  delivery.  The  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement  TA  will  help  build  consumer \nadvocacy among DNSAS customers.    \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nto \n\ntime \n\nfrom \n\ntime).  To \n\nThe grant proceeds for the sector Project will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \n48. \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended \nfacilitate  project \nimplementation  and  funds  flow,  a  project  imprest  account  will  be  opened  at  a  domestic \ncommercial bank in Dili, acceptable to ADB. The financial management assessment indicates that \nDNSAS has limited capacity in internal control in financial management and so MOI will manage \nthe imprest account with assistance from the project implementation consultant firm. The imprest \naccount will be exclusively used to finance, as required, ADB\u2019s share of reasonable and eligible \nexpenditures under the (i) leak detection and repair works, (ii) installation of valve covers, marker \nposts, meter chambers, valves and meters; sundry repair and replacement works; and installation \nof  chlorination  equipment,  and  (iii)  project  management  and  capacity  development.  The  direct \npayment  procedures  will  apply  for  all  other  civil  works,  supplies  and  consulting  contracts  under \nthe  Project.  The  initial  advance  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  either  6 \nmonths  of  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest  account  or  $100,000, \nwhichever is lower. If the Government initially funds eligible expenditures from its own resources, \nreimbursement procedures will be used.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49.  MOI, through the project implementation consultant, will maintain a separate account for \nthe  Project  and  prepare  separate  financial  statements,  indicating  sources  and  application  of \nfunds,  and  have  them  audited  by  the  international  accountant  engaged  by  the  Project.  The \naudited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after \nthe end of  each financial year.  MOI, through the project implementation consultant, will prepare \nand  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and  a  project  completion  report  within  3 \nmonths after the project completion. The ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers  failure  to  submit  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  due  dates  has  been  explained.  If \nsubmission  of  an  audited  financial  statement  is  delayed  more  than  6  months,  ADB  may  not \napprove new contract awards. If the delay is more than 12 months, grant disbursements may be \nsuspended  or  the  grant  may  be  canceled.  A  separate  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  use  of  the  imprest \naccount procedure will be included in the audit report. \n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n50.  MOI  will  establish  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  to  facilitate  the  reporting \nrequirements.  The  system  will  assess  progress  and  implementation  of  the  Project,  including \ncompliance with  subproject  EMMPs,  and  compliance  with  covenants  of  the  grant  agreement.  In \nconjunction  with  the  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement  TA,  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  system  will  help  DNSAS  monitor  its  operational  efficiency,  financial  position,  and \nprojections to enable performance benchmarking against other utilities.  \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n51. \nThe  Project  will  be  reviewed  every  6  months.  Each  review  will  cover  all  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental and social, economic, financial, and other \nrelevant  aspects  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  performance  of  the  Project  and  its  continuing \nviability. MOI and ADB will undertake a mid-term review 14 months after the start of the project \nimplementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n52. \nThe  Project  will  sustainably  improve  water  supply  services  for  households,  businesses, \nand  institutions  in  Dili  city.  Sector  project  investments  in  valves,  meters,  distribution  pipes  and \nconnections  will  enable  DNSAS  to  improve  hydraulic  efficiencies,  reduce  operating  costs,  and \nmanage  demand  including  reducing  water  losses.  Together  with  the  Dili  Water  Supply \nPerformance Improvement TA, DNSAS will halt and reverse the decline in water sales revenues, \nand  improve  its  technical  and  commercial  performance,  preparing  for  an  eventual  possible \nmanagement  contract.  The  Project  comprises  individual  subproject  investments  for  defined \nhydraulic  subzones  and  neighborhoods.  The  subprojects  introduce  the  Government\u2019s  medium-\nterm  urban  WSS  program  for  improving  urban  water  supplies  in  all  of  Dili,  Baucau,  and  in  all \ndistrict centers.     \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n53. \nHouseholds  without  a  piped  connection  (62%  of  project  area)  rely  on  shallow  wells, \nshallow tubewells, springs, neighbors\u2019 taps, and public tanks. In Dili, all zones suffer from water \nstress  in  the  dry  season.  Consequently,  during  the  dry  months  obtaining  water  for  basic  needs \nbecomes more time consuming as households have to go farther to find a water source. Similarly, \nconnected  households  with  intermittent  supply  must  obtain  water  from  secondary  sources  once \nstored  water  is  used.  Non-domestic  water  supply  customers  will  benefit  financially  due  to  an \nimproved supply without the need to resort to more costly tanker supplies. \n \n54. \nEconomic  benefits  arise  from  increases  in  improved  water  supply  to  both  piped  and \nnonpiped domestic users and commercial customers from reduction in time and costs of obtaining \nwater.  In  addition,  a  reduction  in  water  losses  from  an  estimated  70%\u201325%  in  the  subzone \nsubproject areas allows more water to be available in other areas of the city and/or a reduction in \npumping, chemical, and O&M costs as less water production is required. Households using clean \npotable  water  rather  than  water  from  polluted  shallow  wells  and  streams  will  experience  health \nbenefits.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  high  incidence  of  malaria  and  dengue  fever  in  Dili  since \nreducing leaks will reduce pooling and more reliable piped supplies will reduce household water \nstorage. \n \n55. \nAn economic analysis of the three core subprojects based on time and cost savings was \ncompleted (Appendix 10). The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 20.2% and the economic \nnet  present  value  (ENPV)  at  12%  is  $1.34  million.  An  analysis  to  test  the  sensitivity  of  the \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\feconomic internal rate of return of the combined subzone subprojects to adverse changes in key \nvariables  demonstrates  the  results  are  robust  to  adverse  changes.  The  variables  tested  are \nincreases (+10%) in capital and O&M costs, reduction in subproject benefits (-10%), and a 2-year \ndelay in project implementation and benefits. In the case of the 2-year delay, with costs spread \nover an extra 2 years and a further 20% to reflect additional costs incurred, the economic internal \nrate of return falls to 13.4%.  \n \n56. \nAppendix 10 also presents the financial analysis which considers project-related revenue \nand chemical and electricity savings costs from water-loss reductions. The financial internal rate \nof return (FIRR) is calculated at 2.5% for the subprojects and the financial net present value at the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  is  computed  as  $0.56  million.  The  FIRR  compares \nfavorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 1.0%, substantiating the Project\u2019s \nfinancial  viability.  The  average  incremental  financial  cost  is  $0.25  per  m3  compared  with  the \naverage  financial  tariff  of  $0.29  per  m3.  The  sensitivity  analyses  demonstrates  the  results  are \nrobust to standard sensitivities, but if the Project is delayed 2 years and costs increase by 20%, \nthen the FIRR falls to 1.2%; if the collection efficiency falls to 70% instead of the assumed 90%, \nthe FIRR falls to 1.1%. \n \n57. \nThus  the  Project  is  most  sensitive  to  delays  and  consequent  corresponding  cost \nincreases. Accordingly, efforts have been made in project design to avoid such delays and cost \nincreases.  These  are  detailed  in  the  subproject  appraisal  report  (Supplementary  Appendix  D). \nThe economic and financial analyses are detailed in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n58. \nDNSAS has limited autonomy in decision-making other than for basic operating matters. \nAll  financing,  fees  and  charges,  staffing,  infrastructure  development  and  procurement  decisions \nrequire  the  prior  approval  of  MOI,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  or  Ministry  of  State \nAdministration.  The  annual  budget  for  all  Government  departments  is  set  out  in  the  General \nBudget  of \nfinancial  management,  and \nappropriations. A Banking and Payments Authority makes all Government payments. Treasury (a \ndepartment within MOF) receives all Government revenues, acts as paymaster and performs the \naccounting function of Government. Accordingly, DNSAS is required to submit all applications for \nongoing  day-to-day  funding  to  MOF,  all  revenues  collected  are  banked  and  passed  directly  to \nTreasury.  \n \n59. \nFor  the  12  months  ending  30  June  2007,  DNSAS\u2019s  total  budget  was  $3.1  million,  with \n$1.823 million for operations. Dili water supply accounts for $1.104 million (60.6%) to cover water, \nwastewater  management,  and  solid  waste  services.  Cost  recovery  from  users  through  water \ntariffs has been limited. Since independence, customers have only been billed for a period of 16 \nmonths,  November  2004\u2013April  2006.  In  the  12  months  ending  30  June  2006,  $58,000  was \ncollected from customers, representing 7% of Dili water supply operating costs. \n \n60. \nFinancial projections prepared for Dili show that cost recovery of operating costs would be \nachieved  by  2017,  following  full  metering  of  all  customers  by  2014  and  a  tariff  increase  in  real \nterms of 29% in 2014. This would ensure financial sustainability of Dili\u2019s operations. The current \nDili  tariff  has  a  lifeline  block  up  to  14  m3  at  a  lower  tariff  to  protect  the  poor  and  ensure  water \ncharges  are  affordable.  Following  the  tariff  increase,  the  monthly  water  bill  of  low-income \nconsumers for 14 m3 would represent 3.2% of household income compared with 3.0% under the \ncurrent tariff. For an average income household consuming 25 m3 per month, the water bill would \nrepresent 3.7% of household income, a similar level to the tariff in FY2008. (The DNSAS financial \nanalysis and tariffs are detailed in Appendix 11 and Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n\nthe  State.  MOF  regulations  cover  budget  and \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n61. \nThe due diligence undertaken for the three subprojects appraised does not indicate land \nacquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  Due  diligence  to  be  undertaken  for  candidate \nsubprojects should not identify any land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts. However, \na LARF was prepared (Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix G). It provides a mechanism to \nscreen candidate subprojects and\u2014if the need arises\u2014provide guidance on how to prepare and \nimplement  subsequent  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  procedures.  Dili  city  contains  no \nindigenous peoples at present, thus, no indigenous peoples will be impacted by the Project. With \nsupport from the Dili Infrastructure Project Management TA, MOI and DNSAS will strengthen their \nenvironmental and social impact assessment and management capabilities and TA specialists will \nbe available to support project implementation. In keeping with the Project\u2019s alignment principles, \nenvironmental  and  other  safeguard  considerations  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  DNSAS \nDevelopment and Planning Division, Division of Administration, Dili Water and Sanitation Division \n(for  planning  and  implementation),  and  the  MOI  Corporate  Services  Directorate  (for  oversight). \nThe Project will finance and help build skills and systems in a new Environment and Social Unit, \nto be located in the DNSAS Development and Planning Division. \n \n \n\nSocial and Gender \n\n1. \n\nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy was developed based on the findings of \n62. \nan initial poverty reduction and social assessment, and social surveys. During project preparation, \nparticipatory  approaches  were  undertaken,  including  consultations  with  representatives  of \ncommunities,  government  agencies,  and  other  stakeholders.  Focus  group  consultations  were \nheld  with  women.  Women  indicated  a  high  willingness  to  pay  for  improved  water  supplies  and \nwomen  are  expected  to  benefit  disproportionately  from  improved  water  supply  services.  All \nreasonable and  necessary  steps  will  be taken  to  encourage  women  living  in  the  project  area  to \nparticipate in the final design and implementation of subprojects and in the selection and design \nof  candidate  subprojects  (paragraph  69).  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is \npresented  in  Appendix  13  and  the  findings  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  and  subsequent \nrecommendations  are  set  out  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  Socio  economic  profiles  of  each \ncore subproject are also included in subproject appraisal reports (Supplementary Appendix D). In \nthe  subzone  1,  it  is  estimated  that  23%  of  households  have  per  capita  incomes  below  the \nNational poverty line of $0.55 per day and 30% have per capita incomes between $0.55 and $1.0 \nper  day.  In  subzones  2  and  3,  the  equivalent  estimates  are  36%  and  27%,  and  24%  and  39% \nrespectively.  \n \n \n\nEnvironmental \n\n2. \n\n63. \nThe  proposed  core  subprojects  are  categorized  as  environmental  category  B.  IEEs  and \nthe  EMMPs  were  prepared  for  the  core  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental requirements as set out in the applicable laws and regulations.12 A summary IEE is \nattached  as  Appendix  14  and  IEEs  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  The  proposed  core \nsubprojects will be located in urban areas and have no sensitive environmental implications. No \nsignificant cumulative impacts are identified. Moreover, the proposed core subprojects are limited \nto  rehabilitation  of  the  existing  facilities.  All  potential  environmental  impacts  can  be  properly \nmitigated and minimized to acceptable levels.  \n                                                 \n12 Timor-Leste is building an environmental legal framework, including an environmental impact assessment  law. Until \nlaws are promulgated, environmental matters are governed by applicable regulations of the United Nations Transition \nAuthority for East Timor. Indonesian laws, which were in force up to 1999 and that have broader coverage than the \nUnited Nations regulations, lack the political legitimacy for them to be enforced in Timor-Leste. \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\flegislation \n\n  \n64. \nThe  IEEs  and  EMMPs,  which  will  be  prepared  for  all  candidate  subprojects,  will  be \nincluded  in  the  feasibility  reports  for  submission  to  ADB  and  to  the  secretary  of  state  for \nenvironment  after  Timor-Leste\u2019s  environmental  management  enabling \nis \npromulgated.13 An EMMP will be required for subprojects classified as environmental category B. \nSubproject feasibility reports will identify adequate funding for EMMPs. Subproject EMMPs will be \nreflected  in  the  bid  documents,  incorporated  into  project  design,  and  included  in  contractors\u2019 \ncontracts  for  subprojects.  The  project  team  and  contractors  will  be  guided  by  the  EMMPs  in \nfor  reporting \nmanaging  and  monitoring \nenvironmental  compliance.  Civil  works  and  supply  contracts  may  only  be  signed  and  works \ncommence after the IEE reports of subprojects are approved by ADB. \n \nAn EARP prepared in accordance with the ADB guidelines will guide the preparation and \n65. \napproval  procedures  of  environmental  assessments  of  candidate  subprojects  under  DNSAS\u2019s \nurban  water  supply  program,  and  describe  institutional  responsibilities  for  environmental \nmanagement. The EARP is detailed in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nC. \n\nimpacts.  The  EMMP  will \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\ninclude  requirements \n\n66. \nCivil  Disorder  in  Dili.  Escalating civil disorder and violence in Dili would disrupt project \nimplementation  and  make  maintaining  improved  services  and  improving  financial  performance \ndifficult  for  DNSAS.  Timor-Leste  is  now  politically  stable  following  successful  presidential  and \nparliamentary  elections  earlier  in  2007;  the  new  Government  is  functioning  normally.  Internally \ndisplaced people are being resettled. Some United Nations policing is likely for several years.   \n \nRetention  of  Leak  Detection  Teams  and  Caretakers.  Keeping  water  losses  low  and \n67. \nextending  the  leak  detection  program  to  other  zones  requires  DNSAS  to  retain  the  three  leak \ndetection  teams  after  the  Project.  Likewise,  the  six  subzone  caretakers  recruited  and  trained \nunder  the  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement  TA  must  be  retained  permanently  by \nDNSAS to sustain the Project approach in the three target zones: reliable supply of clean water to \nthe  houses  or  businesses  in  exchange  for  on-time  payment  of  a  fair  tariff.  The  minister  of \ninfrastructure provided an assurance of both these requirements. If the DNSAS staff ceiling is to \nbe exceeded, the additional personnel will be retained on long-term contracts or the work could \nbe outsourced to a local nongovernment organization. \n \n68. \nRevenue  Performance:  Retention  of  Revenues.  Project  sustainability  and  success \ndepends critically on customers in Dili paying for their improved water supply service.  The project \ndesign  mitigates  this  risk  as  follows  (Supplementary  Appendixes  B  and  D):  (i)  households, \nincluding low income women households, confirmed in discussions and surveys their willingness \nto pay for water, provided the service is good and reliable\u2014the subzone approach is designed to \nachieve  good  reliable  water  supplies  to  customers;  (ii)    subzone  caretakers  will  intensively \nmanage  services  and  customer  relations  in  each  subzone,  including  (a)  monitoring  service \nquality,  (b)  taking  and  responding  to  customer  needs  and  complaints,  (c)  helping  with  minor \nrepairs, including meters, (d) helping with billing and collections, (e) reporting illegal connections, \nand (f) delivering outreach messages encouraging good water use practices and the need to pay \nwater bills; (iii)  regularize and meter and re-meter all connections in subzones and all commercial \nconnections  in  Dili;  (iv)  reinstitute  billing  and  collections  in  accordance  with  Ministerial  Order \n1/2004  on  schedule  of  fees  and  charges,  initially  focusing  on  high  usage  customers;  and  (v) \n                                                 \n13 The  environmental  impact  assessment  bill  is  likely  to  be  promulgated  in  2008.  Under  the  bill,  the  responsible \nauthority for issuing EIAs and approvals will be the secretary of state for environment within the ministry of economic \nand  development.  Ahead  of  the  EIA  law,  there  remains  no  clear  responsibility  for  environmental  assessments  and \napprovals within the Government. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fstrengthen  DNSAS\u2019s  support  services  section  (meter  management)  and  customer  services \nsection  through  the  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement  TA.  DNSAS  management \nconfirmed  its  willingness  to  disconnect  delinquent  accounts,  pursuant  to  Decree  Law  4/2004  on \nWater  Supply  for  Public  Consumption.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  revenue \nperformance  and  reducing  subsidies  for  water  (and  electricity)  services,  but  much  depends  on \nsecurity  conditions  in  Dili  (paragraph  66).  As  revenues  build,  DNSAS  should  be  designated  a \nrevenue-retaining  agency  rather  than  have  its  revenues  go  into  the  state  consolidated  revenue \naccount.  This  reform  element  is  included  in  a  draft  ministerial  order  for  the  \u201creinstitution\u201d  of \nDNSAS as an independent public entity prepare in 2004. Water tariffs are discussed in Appendix \n11 and elaborated, together with a discussion on DNSAS finances, in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n69. \nCommitment  to  Concentrated  Investments,  Zonal  Approach.  Dili  city  water  supply \nservices  should  not  be  extended  into  new  areas  prematurely;  doing  this  would  compromise  the \nsystem  hydraulically  and  would  reduce  the  efficacy  of  the  zonal  approach.  Investments  should \nconcentrate on rolling out the subzone process until the entire program is completed.   \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n70. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nCounterpart  financing.  The Government will make available on a timely basis a \ntotal of $1.5 million from its ordinary budgetary allocations as counterpart financing \nto ensure timely completion of the Project. \nProject  management.  The  Government,  through  MOI,  will  arrange  the  project \nteam  to  be  located  in  the  Corporate  Services  Directorate  of  MOI  and  in  DNSAS, \nand will provide office accommodation for all members of the project team, and will \nensure  close  cooperation  between  the  project  team  and  MOI  and  DNSAS  staff, \nincluding  provision  of  all  necessary  data  and  information  to  the  project  team  in  a \ntimely manner. \nEnvironment.  The  Government,  through  DNSAS  will  ensure  that  for  every \nsubproject:  (a)  an  IEE,  environmental  impact  assessment  (as  necessary),  and \nEMMP  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  project  EARP,  consistent  with  (1) \napplicable  national  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and  guidelines,  as and  when \nsuch laws, regulations and guidelines are adopted and become effective, and (2) \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); (b) the EMMP in the IEE is part of the bidding \ndocuments  and  civil  works  contracts;  (c)  any  adverse  environmental  impacts \narising  from  the  Project  are  minimized  by  implementing  the  agreed  mitigation \nmeasures;  and  (d)  environmental  monitoring  is  done  by  the  construction \nsupervision team. Prior to signing of any works contract under the subproject and \nthe commencement of works, MOI shall submit to ADB for review and approval on \na no-objection basis, the IEE related to the subproject. \nSubproject approval. All subprojects will be prepared, selected and submitted for \napproval by ADB in accordance with the procedures and eligibility criteria agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB. The Government will ensure that DNSAS will \nsubmit  a  SPAR  for  each  candidate  subproject  to  ADB  for  no-objection  approval \nbefore  proceeding  with  detailed  engineering  design  and  construction  of  the \nsubproject.  \nProject performance monitoring and evaluation. The Government, through the \nproject team, assisted by the international and national consultants engaged under \nthe Project, will monitor and evaluate project impacts. The Government will discuss \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\nand  agree  with  ADB  on  the  indicators  and  baseline  data  prepared  by  these \nconsultants  prior  to  the  commencement  of  civil  works,  and  will  ensure  that  the \nconsultants  monitor  and  compare  the  data  during  project  implementation  and  at \nproject  completion.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  indicators  and  baseline  data  will \nmake full use of gender-disaggregated data and information. \nAll  works  within  existing  easements.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  all \nsubproject  works  are  undertaken  within  existing  water  supply  facility  sites, \neasements,  and  public  rights-of-way,  and  that  (b)  all  subprojects  are  screened  in \nview of potential resettlement impacts in accordance with the LARF (Appendix 12 \nand  Supplementary  Appendix  G)  to  ensure  no  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  is \nrequired.  If  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  the \nGovernment  will  (a)  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  the  LARF;  (b)  submit  it  to  ADB  for \napproval  prior  to  civil  works  contract  award;  and  (c)  ensure  that  payment  of \ncompensation or relocation to new sites have been satisfactorily completed prior to \nland  acquisition  activities  and  demolition.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nresettlement  plan  will  include  detailed  measurement  surveys,  compensation  unit \nrates  based  on  replacement  cost  surveys  for  all  categories  of  losses  and \nallowances,  and  a  final  database  of  affected  persons.  The  Government  will  also \nensure  that  timely  and  adequate  budgetary  support  is  fully  committed  and  made \navailable to cover the costs of land acquisition, resettlement, and relocation within \nthe project implementation period. \n\n(vii)  Retention of project staff. The Government will cause MOI to retain as regular or \ncontractual  staff  of  DNSAS,  or  contract  through  a  firm  or  nongovernment \norganization,  all  nine  members  of  the  three  leak  detection  teams  and  all  six \nsubzone  caretakers  (one  subzone  caretaker  for  approximately  every  1,000 \nconnections throughout the project area) recruited and trained under the Dili Water \nSupply  Performance  Improvement  TA,  provided  that  those  retained  will  have \nperformed their duties satisfactorily. \n\n(viii)  Operation  and  maintenance  budget.  The  Government  will  make \n\ntimely \nbudgetary  allocations  to  DNSAS  for  costs  related  to  subzone  O&M,  estimated  at \naround $17,000 per annum per subzone. \nDNSAS institutional development. The Government will, by 30 November 2009, \nhave  approved  a  ministerial  order  setting  out  a  roadmap  for  organizing  DNSAS \ninto  an  independent  public  entity  with  appropriate  management,  technical,  and \nfinancial autonomy.   \nDNSAS  revenue  performance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  by  31 \nDecember 2009, DNSAS has reinstituted its revenue improvement program, with a \ntarget  to  increase  during  FY2010  the  number  of  billed  customers  by  a  minimum \n20% and the amount of gross water supply revenue by 30%. The Government will \nensure that the demand management task force, established within DNSAS under \nthe  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement  TA,  is  mandated  to  carry  on \nreducing NRW in other water zones in the project area. \nDNSAS  performance  benchmarking.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  by  30 \nNovember  2009,  DNSAS  has  instituted  a  performance  benchmarking  program, \npreferably  in  association  with  the  World  Bank-supported  IBNet  for  water  and \nsanitation utilities (Supplementary Appendix B). \nPublic  consultation  and  participation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that:  (a) \nadequate  public  consultations  are  conducted  with  local  communities  on  certain \naspects  of  the  Project  during  implementation,  including  but  not  limited  to  the \narrangements for bill paying and provision of water for houses without direct street \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n\fin \n\nthe  project  area \n\naccess;  (b)  all  reasonable  and  necessary  steps  are  taken  to  encourage  women \nliving \nthe  preparation,  design  and \nimplementation  of  subprojects;  and  (c)  women  are  primary  targets  for  any \ncommunity-based  promotion  activities,  including  but  not  limited  to  activities \ndesigned to promote good water use behavior. \n\nto  participate \n\nin \n\n(xiii)  Labor  standards. The Government will ensure that all installation and civil works \ncontracts  under  the  Project  incorporate  provisions  to  ensure  that  contractors \ncomply with the Government\u2019s applicable labor laws and regulations. In particular, \nall installation and civil works contractors engaged for subprojects will be required \nto  (a)  provide  equal  employment  opportunity  to  male  and  female  employees,  (b) \nprovide equal pay to male and female employees for work of equal value, and (c) \nnot employ child labor in the subprojects work. \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n71. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \nthe  equivalent  of  $6,000,000  to  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources for the Dili Urban Water Supply Sector Project, on terms and conditions that are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Grant  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n26 November 2007 \n \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f \n20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \nImproved water supply \nservices for households, \nbusinesses, and \ninstitutions in Dili city  \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nDNSAS customer \nregistration records, \nconsumption records and \nfield surveys \n \nDNSAS customer \ncomplaints records  \nStructured customer \nsurveys, gender \ndisaggregated  \n\n \nPercentage of Dili \npopulation receiving 24-\nhour piped water supply \nincreased from 25% in \n2007 to 80% by 2015 \n \nCustomer satisfaction with \nDili piped water supply \nservices improved, with less \nthan 180 complaints per \n1,000 customers per year by \n2015 \n \nWomen perceive significant \nbenefits from improved \nwater supply services to \ntheir households \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nNRW ratio for Dili city water \nsupply reduced from 95% to \n40\u201350% by month 29 \n \nNRM ratio for the three \ntarget zones reduced from \n95% to 25\u201330% by month \n29 \n \nPercentage of the population \nin the three target zones \nreceiving 24-hour piped \nwater supply increased from \n40% in 2006 to 80% by 2009 \n \nProcurement contracts let, \nNRW targets set and work \nplans in place for ongoing \nleak detection and NRW \nreduction work in future \ntarget zones by month 29 \n \n\nWater loss reduction and \ncontrol program completed \nin three target zones by \nmonth 29, including (i) six \nsubzones in the three target \nzones metered and \ncontrolled by valves; \n(ii) 51 km of tertiary pipes \n\nOutcome \nImproved hydraulic \nmanagement of the Dili \nwater supply system \nand more efficient \ntertiary distribution \n\nOutputs \n1.

Under  the  fourth  constitutional  Government  sworn  into  office  in \nAugust 2007, the new Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) has primary responsibility for managing \nwater supply and sanitation (WSS) in Timor-Leste. The secretary of state for electricity, water, \nand  urbanization  reports  to  the  minister.  An  MOI  organic  law  is  being  prepared  to  clarify \nprecise  arrangements,  roles,  and  responsibilities  for  the  various  offices  that  will  directly  and \nindirectly  influence  WSS  sector  development,  for  instance  the  previous  Corporate  Services \nDirectorate of the previous responsible ministry. The National Directorate for Water Supply and \nSanitation (DNSAS) is responsible for developing, managing, operating, and maintaining urban \nand rural WSS systems throughout Timor-Leste. It manages 13 urban water supply systems, \nthe  largest  being  Dili  city.  DNSAS  is  a  directorate  within  MOI,  with  no  financial  and  little \nmanagerial  autonomy.  Other  important  stakeholder  agencies  include  (i)  Office  of  the  Prime \nMinister  and  Council  of  Ministers  (COM),  for  policy,  planning,  and  regulation;  (ii) Ministry  of \nEconomy  and  Development  for  environmental  protection  and  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forests, \nand  Fisheries  for  water  resources  management;  (iii)  Ministry  of  Health  for  public  health  and \ncommunity education and awareness; and (iv) other MOI directorates for urban drainage and \nother local environmental aspects. \n \n2. \nLegislative Framework. In February 2004, COM adopted the Water Services Decree, \nwhich  provides  for  the  management  of  water  services  delivery,  including  provisions  for  the \nidentification of areas to be supplied and application of service user charges. Two subsidiary \nministerial diplomas concurrently set water supply tariffs for Dili and main towns in districts, and \nformalized management arrangements for multivillage piped water systems in rural areas. The \nWater  Services  Decree  allows  for  the  corporatization  of  DNSAS.  Other  relevant  legislation \nincludes (i) sanitation management decree (drafted but not yet considered by COM); (ii) Public \nSanitation  Decree  (2005);  (iii)  national  water  policy  and  legislative  framework  (drafted  and \nconsidered,  but  not  yet  passed  by  COM);  (iv)  law  on  environmental  impact  assessment  and \nguidelines (drafted but not yet considered by COM); (v) law on pollution control (drafted but not \nyet considered by COM); and (vi) law on protected areas (under discussion). \n \n3. \nAccess to Water Supply. National estimates of access to water supply in Timor-Leste \nare  not  reliable  because  of  definitional  inconsistencies  and  data  gaps. 1 But  two  things  are \nclear:  access  nationally  is  low  by  regional  standards,  and  access  overall  has  improved  little \nsince restoration of independence in 2002, and in many areas has worsened. In 2001, access \nto water varied across Timor-Leste. About 42% of the population of the western districts had \naccess to safe water, 48% in central districts, and 50% in eastern districts. The 2003 figures in \nTable  A2.1  are  derived  from  interviews  with  DNSAS  staff,  adjusted  for  ongoing  projects.  But \nrehabilitated and new rural (piped) water supply systems in Timor-Leste have been difficult to \nsustain and the figures are not adjusted for probable system failures. Access to safe water in \nurban  centers  has  probably  declined  since  2001,  again  because  systems  have  been \ninadequately maintained and have lost service efficiency. Earlier estimates for access to safe \nwater  could  have  been  too  optimistic.  An  informal  survey  in  December  2004  indicated  that \nabout 41% of the urban population and 30% of the rural population had access to safe water. \n\n                                                 \n1  A thorough discussion of definitional issues and data gaps is available in the draft Water Supply and Sanitation: \n\nPriorities and Proposed Sector Investment Program, September 2007 (Update 2007). \n\n \n\n\f \n24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nOf households with access to safe water supply, the United Nations Development Programme2 \nestimated in 2004 that only 13% had piped house connections and 16% used community taps. \nThe remainder mostly used protected wells and spring sources.   \n \nAccess  to  Sanitation.  In  2001,  only  42%  of  the  overall  population  had  access  to \n4. \nadequate sanitation.3 In 2001, almost 45% (and 49% in 2002) indicated they did not use any \nform  of  toilet  facility,  instead  using ponds,  fields,  etc.,  for  their  sanitary  needs.  In  rural  areas, \nanecdotal reports from health and other professionals indicate rural access may still be below \n10%, especially in western districts. In urban areas, the 2002 survey suggests that a significant \n22% of the total urban population did not have access to any toilet facility, with another 21% \nusing open pits without septic tanks. In Dili, 31% did not have a septic tank connected to their \ntoilet facility. The Timor-Leste Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Report 2004 cited access \nto sanitation as 19% total, 44% urban, and 10% rural in 2001. \n \n\n2. \n\nDili Water Supply \n\n5. \nWater  Supply  Infrastructure.  Dili  city\u2019s  water  supply  system  comprises  four  river \nintakes, nine functioning deep bores, 31 kilometers (km) of raw water transmission mains, four \nwater  treatment  plants,  seven  service  reservoirs,  and  200  km  of  distribution  mains.  The \ndistribution  network  is  divided  into  10  water  supply  zones.  While  some  are  separate  zones \ncontrolled  by  boundary  valves,  others  are  theoretical  zones  only.  Over  the  past  5  years,  the \nGovernment  of  Timor-Leste,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB), and other donors have made substantial investments4 in raw water transmission \ncapacity, water treatment plant capacity, and the distribution network in 8 of the service area\u2019s \n10  water  supply  zones.  These  elements  of  Dili\u2019s  water  supply  system  are  in  reasonable \ncondition and have adequate capacity, although raw water intakes and transmission mains are \noccasionally damaged by floods and landslides. But tertiary pipes and service connections are \nin  poor  condition  and  contribute  substantially  to  the  high  leakage  rates.  The  distribution \nnetwork reaches about 80% of the entire Dili water service area (the 10 water supply zones).  \n \n6. \nService. DNSAS estimates (March 2006) that only about 43% of Dili\u2019s households have \nauthorized piped water supply connections, while a further 10% use public taps or tanks (Table \nA2.1). An estimated 22% of households have unauthorized connections. In total, around 87% \nof  households  take  water  directly  from  the  piped  water  supply  system.  In  zone  3  and \nelsewhere, smallholder farmers use DNSAS treated piped water for crop irrigation. Only about \n25%\u201330%  of  DNSAS  authorized  customers,  mainly  in  zones  1  and  10,  have  24-hour  supply \nwith  good  pressure.  The  other  zones  experience  high  leakage,  low  or  variable  pressure,  and \nintermittent  supply  with  water  available  for  only  about  10\u201316  hours  per  day.  Many  urban \nneighborhoods,  particularly  in  low-income  areas,  rely  on  contaminated  water  from  shallow \nwells  or  boreholes  and  streams.  The  poor  service  and  low  coverage  are  largely  caused  by \n\n                                                 \n2  United Nations Development Programme. 2004. Timor-Leste Human Development Report: Paths Out of Poverty. \n\nDili. \n\n3  The definition of adequate sanitation is an adequate excreta disposal facility, such as a connection to a sewer or \nseptic tank system, a pour-flush toilet, or a simple pit or \u201cVIP\u201d latrine. An excreta disposal system is considered \nadequate if it is private or shared (but not public) and it can effectively prevent human, animal, and insect contact \nwith excreta. \n\n4  Recent  and  ongoing  construction  works  in  April  2006:  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  -funded  project \nhas completed distribution system upgrading in zone 4, and continues to upgrade distribution in zones 1, 3, 5, 6, \n7,  and  8,  which  is  scheduled  for  completion  by  September  2006.  ADB  had  previously  upgraded  the  distribution \nnetwork in zone 10. DNSAS is replacing some tertiary pipes in zones 2 and 4, and is reinstalling meters in zones \n1, 2, 3, and 4. DNSAS also plans to relocate a package water treatment plant from Benamau to treat raw water \nfrom Maloa intake, which currently supplies raw water to a 60 cubic meter service reservoir servicing a small part \nof the system. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\n(i) lack  of  tertiary  pipes;  (ii)  poor  condition  of  tertiary  pipes  and  service  connections,  and; \n(iii) poor demand management.

The  shortfall  in  supply  comes  from  nine  functioning  deep \nboreholes  that  supply  adequate  quality  water  without  treatment  other  than  chlorination. \nGenerally,  Dili\u2019s  piped  water  supply  is  not  safe  to  drink  directly  from  the  tap.  Many  urban \nhouseholds  use  alternative  more  reliable  supplies.  Water  quality  is  acceptable  at  treatment \nplant  outlets,  but  quickly  deteriorates  within  the  distribution  system  due  to  low  or  negative \npressure and lack of adequate watermain maintenance. More than half of Dili households rely \non shallow wells for water supply\u2014solely reliant or to supplement the piped water supply\u2014and \nmost premises have some form of storage to collect water when flowing from the piped system \n(Table A2.2). About 3% of households rely on tanker trucks.

The \nsurveys  included  housing  inventory;  assessment;  socioeconomic  attributes;  areas  of  high,  medium,  and  low \npriority;  key  issues  and  neighborhood  priorities;  infrastructure  condition;  basic  service  delivery;  and  upgrading \nneeds.

Improved  water  supply  was  consistently  the  highest  development  priority  of \nrespondents.  The  project  estimated  that  some  98  underserved  areas  with  about  46,000 \nresidents (i.e., 28% of the total urban population) across the city would require upgrading in the \nshort to medium term, and recommended a 4-year upgrading program at an estimated cost of \n$3.59 million,6 including about $0.40 million for water supply and $0.48 million for sanitation. \n \n9. \nWater  Meters.  Only  22%  (2,350)  of  9,972  authorized  customers  have  operating \nmetered connections. Many existing meters are broken or faulty; some have been deliberately \ndamaged,  removed,  or  tampered  with  to  produce  faulty  readings.  To  meter  all  currently \nnonmetered  Dili  connections  in  the  medium  term  would  require  around  1,800  meters  to  be \ninstalled  each  year  over  the  next  4  years.

Water  Balance.  Dili\u2019s  water  supply  system  is  losing  massive  amounts  of  water  and \nmoney,  and  relies  almost  entirely  on  government  subsidies.  In  September  2007,  nonrevenue \nwater7 was 100%, as no consumers were being billed for water used and no payments were \nreceived  (Table  A2.4).  Nevertheless  15%  of  the  water  distributed  from  headworks  was \nreticulated  through  water  meters  and  if  this  water  was  billed  and  paid  for,  a  theoretical \nnonrevenue  water  of  85%  is  calculated  and  used  for  this  exercise.  Other  water  losses  are \naround  70%.  DNSAS  commenced  billing  and  collecting  revenue  from  its  Dili  water  supply \ncustomers in 2005, in line with the Water Services Decree 2004. By then, only 2,350 (24%) of \n\n                                                 \n6  Direct costs exclude administration, consultants, and contingencies. The project estimated unit upgrading costs of \n$450  per  dwelling  unit  for  5,950  dwelling  units  (7,970  households)  in  98  target  communities.  The  unit  costs  for \nwater supply were $50 per dwelling unit and for sanitation $60.  \n\n7   Nonrevenue water is the difference between water supplied and water sold (i.e., billed irrespective of whether it is \n\npaid for or not) expressed as a percentage of water supplied by the water production facilities. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nauthorized customers were metered, and in March 2006 only 9% of metered customers (about \n2%  of  all  authorized  customers)  paid  for  piped  water.  The  number  of  paying  customers \ndecreased  inexplicably  from  about  900  to  195  between  January  and  March  2006.  From  the \nonset of the national crisis in April 2006 until now, billing and collections ceased. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nSystem \nInput \nVolume \n100% \n919,494 \nm3/ month \n \n \n\nBilled Metered Consumption \n(not paid) \n\nBilled Metered Consumption \n(paid) \n\nBilled \nAuthorized \nConsumption \n15% \n137,924 \nm3/month \n\nFigure A24: Water Balance for Dili City in September 2007  \n \n0% \nAuthorized \n0  \nm3/month \nConsumption \n30% \n15% \n275,848 \n137,924 \nm3/month \nm3/month \n \n0% \n0  \nm3/month \n0% \n0 \nm3/month \n15% \n137,924 \nm3/month \nNot Known \nNot Known \n\nUnbilled \nAuthorized \nConsumption \n15% \n137,924 \n\nUnbilled Metered Consumption \n \n\nUnbilled Nonmetered Consumption \n\nBilled Nonmetered Consumption \n\n \n \nWater Losses \n70% \n643,646 \nm3/month \n \n\nApparent \nLosses \nNot Known \n \n \nPhysical \nLosses \nNot Known \n\nUnauthorized Consumption \nMetering Inaccuracies \n \nLeakage on Transmission and \nDistribution Mains \nLeakage and Overflows at Storage \nTanks \nLeakage on Service Connections up \nto the Customers\u2019 Meters \n\nNot Known \n\nNot Known \n\nNot Known \n\nRevenue \nWater \n15% \n137,924 \nm3/month \n \n \n\n \n \n \nNon-\nrevenue \nWater \n15 plus \n70% \nunknowns \n= \n85% \n781,570 \nm3/month \n \n\nAssistance to Timor-Leste for Preparing the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation.

The  Dili  water  supply  and  DNSAS \nperformance  indicators  and  comparisons  with  Southeast  Asian  averages  are  discussed  in \nAppendix 3, and in some detail in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \nB. \n\nSector Policy and Programming \n\n1. \n\nSector Investment Plan Update 2007 \n\n12. \nThe  draft  WSS  sector  investment  program  2008\u20132012  was  completed  in  September \n2007 and by project fact-finding was being considered by the new Government. The 17 sector \ninvestment  programs/update  reports  produced  each  year  have  been  the  Government\u2019s  key \nprogram budgeting tool since 2004; they underpin the formulation of annual national budgets \nand  include  a  5-year  rolling  investment  plan.  The  draft  2008\u20132012  plan  comprises  a \ncomprehensive  and  technically  sound  national  WSS  strategy  and  the  Government\u2019s  WSS \nsector planning and budgeting. \n \n13. \nSince  before  the  2006  national  crisis\u2014and  especially  since\u2014the  Government  and \ndevelopment  partners  have  recognized  the  urgent  need  for  the  Government  to  execute  an \naccelerated program of public works in order to create jobs and improve service delivery. The \nFY2007  national  budget  quadrupled  the  national  capital  development  program.  The  new \nGovernment  is  likely  to  continue  with  this  policy  and  the  WSS  sector  investment  program \n2008\u20132012 assumes some kind of a program for accelerated national development. It includes \nDili city among several target districts for accelerated WSS investments. It explicitly programs \n\n \n\n\f \n28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nfor the replication of the zonal approach being tested and demonstrated by the ADB-supported \nDili  Urban  Water  Supply  Sector  Project.  The  Project  will  cover  only  six  subzones  spread \naround three of Dili\u2019s 10 water supply zones\u2014covering about 26% of Dili customers (in addition \nto  the  approximately  10%  of  customers  already  adequately  served).  The  sector  investment \nprogram provides for the zonal approach to be replicated in the remaining Dili city water supply \nzones until the entire network is technically sound and properly managed. The approach would \nthen be replicated in Baucau and other urban centers in the remaining four priority districts.  \n \n\n2. \n\nContext for the ADB Sector Grant \n\n14. \nThe draft WSS sector investment program 2008\u20132012 provides a proper context for an \nADB  sector  grant.  The  purpose  of  a  sector  loan  or  grant  is  to  assist  in  developing  a  specific \nsector or subsector by financing a part of the investment planned by the Government. This type \nof  ADB  support  takes  a  time  slice  or  geographic  slice  of  the  wider  investment  program.  The \nsector  Project\u2019s  water  supply  subzone  approach  fits  with  the  usual  subproject  modality  that \nunderpins a sectorwide investment program and ADB sector loan or grant.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29\n\nPERFORMANCE OF NATIONAL DIRECTORATE FOR WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION \n \n\nA. \n\nAgencies within the Urban Water Supply Sector \n\n1. \n\nMinisterial Arrangements \n\n1. \nResponsibilities of ministries and their line agencies in the water and related sectors were \nrestructured  on  8  August  2007.  Until  then,  the  National  Directorate  for  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation (DNSAS) was a line agency of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Minerals and Energy \nPolicy. In a major government reshuffle, the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) was created covering \nthe  responsibilities  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications, \nand  the  water  supply,  sanitation  and  electricity  generation  and  distribution  responsibilities  of  the \nMinistry  of  Natural  Resources,  Minerals  and  Energy  Policy.  Secretaries  for  state  were  created \nwithin MOI with the head of each secretary for state reporting to the minister. DNSAS reports to \nthe secretary of state responsible for water supply and sanitation, electricity, and urban planning. \n \n2. \nUntil  September  2007,  financial  management,  including  procurement,  was  controlled  by \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF). This responsibility will be devolved to line ministries that have not \nyet been identified. Within MOI, financial, budgeting, and procurement responsibility will probably \nbe retained at the ministerial level, but it may be devolved to the respective secretaries of state. \nThe  Ministry  of  State  Administration  controls  staffing  but  is  still  developing  its  public  service \nstaffing procedures for recruitment, motivation, appraisal, training, and discipline. A consolidated \nfund of Timor-Leste has been established. In accordance with government annual budget papers, \na  banking  and  payments  authority  makes  all  government  payments.  Treasury  receives  all \ngovernment revenues, acts as paymaster, and performs the accounting function of government.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation \n\n3. \nDNSAS manages urban water supply systems in the 13 district capital towns\u2014the largest \nbeing Dili City with a population of approximately 165,000\u2014and a small but expanding number of \nsystems  in  smaller  district  centers.  Due  to  resource  constraints,  its  rural  water  supply  activities \nhave  relied  heavily  on  the  support  of  development  partners  and  nongovernment  organizations. \nThe  Project  will  rely  on  DNSAS  as  the  project  Implementing  Agency,  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation. Project management will fit within existing DNSAS structures and will use existing \nsystems and processes. \n \n4. \nDNSAS  organizational  development  is  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  B.  Although  established  with  a  strategic  plan  and  organization  structure  suited  to \nexpected  early  corporatization,  DNSAS  continues  to  operate  as  a  government  department.  As \nexpected  of  a  government  directorate,  DNSAS  has  limited  autonomy  in  decision  making  other \nthan for basic operations and exhibits little accountability to service users. All financing, fees and \ncharges,  staffing,  infrastructure  development,  and  procurement  decisions  require  the  prior \napproval of higher level agencies. \n \n5. \nDNSAS has 209 allocated staff positions, compared with 174 in 2005, and an urban water \nsupply  infrastructure  asset  base  estimated  at  almost  $50  million.  Its  2005\u20132006  total  operating \nbudget\u2014covering  urban  water,  urban  sanitation,  rural  water,  and  sanitation\u2014was  just  under  $2 \nmillion (up $0.6 million from 2004/05) with another $1.8 million for capital works (up $0.7 million). \nThe  Government  heavily  subsidizes  its  operations  and  fully  funds  its  development  expenditures \n(in  addition  to  external  support).

The directorate\u2019s \nrole  is  to  make  policy  and  legislative  recommendations  to  the  Government,  and  coordinate  and \nmonitor water service delivery.  \n\n  \nAnalysis of Organizational Strengths and Weaknesses \n\nB. \n\n1. \n\nStrengths \n\n8. \nDNSAS  senior  staff  members  exhibit  a  strong  sense  of  organizational  loyalty  and  pride. \nSenior  managers  meet  weekly  and  organizational  challenges  are  usually  openly  discussed  and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31\n\ndecisions reached by concensus; although some autocratic and ad-hoc decisions occur at other \ntimes, often as a result of urgent ministerial direction. Senior staff members have a strong belief \nthat ongoing procedural changes will allow both MOI and DNSAS increased autonomy in human \nresource  management  and  more  rapid  ministerial-level  procurement  arrangements, \nthus \nimproving organization performance. \n \n9. \nMuch  reliance  is  placed  on  the  well-documented  organization  structure  and  chains  of \ncommand  are  well  understood.  Of  particular  significance  is  that  the  organizational  structure \ncurrently  in  place,  was  developed  by  DNSAS  itself.  While  this  structure  is  not  completely  in  line \nwith recommendations,1 the structure is operational and workable. The sense of ownership of the \nstructure in place is strong. Job descriptions are available for most positions, but are not routinely \nreferred  to or  well-linked  to  operating  procedures.  No  established  system  of  formal  performance \nappraisal is in place. \n \n10. \nDNSAS  staff  members  have  demonstrated  great  acceptance  of  most  new  systems  and \nprocedures imposed provided they have understood the need for change and the processes to be \nfollowed.  DNSAS  is  highly  regarded  as  more  capable  in  budget  preparation  and  quarterly \nreporting than most other agencies.  \n \n11.  With the assistance of the two ADB-managed trust funds for water supply and sanitation \nrehabilitation  projects  in  2001/02,  DNSAS  established  a  system  of  guidelines,  procedures, \nstandard  specifications,  and  drawings  for  community  water  supply  and  sanitation  and  for  urban \nwater supply. The community water supply guidelines have been well utilized and were recently \nupdated  by  DNSAS.  These  guidelines  have  been  well  promoted  and  accepted  by  development \npartners. They are viewed as good practice for similar activities in other countries. Urban technical \nguidelines and standards are discussed in Supplementary Appendix D. \n  \n\n2. \n\nWeaknesses   \n\nOrganizational  weaknesses  perceived  by  staff  all  relate  to  lack  of  autonomy  to  perform \n12. \nprocurement,  human  resource  management,  and  other  functions  that  would  allow  them  to  do  a \n\u201cbetter\u201d  job.  Examples  given  include  slow  procurement,  financially  constrained  emergency \nresponses,  and  inability  to  recruit  budgeted  staff.  This  is  reinforced  by  the  very  poor  DNSAS \nbudget execution,2 and underspending of staffing budgets. However ongoing changes concerning \nthe devolution of responsibility from MOF to MOI, and within MOI, may help, in part, to overcome \nthese weaknesses.  \n \n13.  Many  existing  organizational  deficiencies  are  not  recognized  by  DNSAS  staff  as \nweaknesses that need to be addressed. These include \n \n\nlimited strategic planning;  \nlimited monitoring and reporting of performance; \nfew embedded systems and operating procedures;  \nlimited means to identify future infrastructure development, rehabilitation, operation \nand maintenance costs; and  \nlack of accountability to service users. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  Timor-Leste  for  Integrated  Water  Resource  Management  Project.  Manila  (TA \n\n3986-TIM).  \n\n2  The  DNSAS  2004\u20132005  annual  reports  show  an  operating  budget  execution  of  86%;  however,  when  end  of  year \ncarryover  commitments  are  removed  the  figure  is  47%.  Capital  budget  execution  was  similarly  shown  as  51%; \nhowever, actual capital expenditure at the end of the year was 0%. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDNSAS  has  experienced  enormous  organizational  change  over  the  past  6  years.  Many \n14. \nstaff members have been rapidly promoted to positions with responsibilities far in excess of their \nprevious  experience.  Analytical  thinking,  planning,  and  problem-solving  abilities  have  improved, \nbut the room for further improvement is significant.  \n \n\nProject Reaction to Strengths and Weaknesses \n\n \n3. \n\n15. \nThe  Project  will  build  on  the  identified  DNSAS  strengths  and  provide  support  in  areas \nidentified  as  weaknesses.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  DNSAS  through  its  three  existing \ndivisions.  No  special  project  management  unit  will  be  established  and  all  technology  transfer \nresulting from project implementation will benefit these three divisions. \n \n16. \nThe  Government  prefers  DNSAS  to  eventually  become  an  independent  public  entity \nexercising  management,  technical,  and  financial  economy.  To  this  end,  ADB  sought  the \nassurance of the Government and MOI, that by 31 December 2009, a draft ministerial order will \nbe  submitted  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  setting  out  a  road  map  for  graduating  DNSAS  to  that \nstatus. \n \n17. \nCapacity  building  is  integrated  with  project  activities  with  all  members  of  the  team  of \nimplementation  consultants  working  collaboratively  with  their  DNSAS  counterpart(s).  Further,  a \npackage  of  technical  assistance3 specifically  aimed  at  enhancing  DNSAS  capacity  has  already \nbeen approved and will be in the field concurrent with the Project. \n \n18. \nExisiting comprehensive technical standards, drawings, specifications, and guidelines, with \nsome  minor  modifications,  have  been  developed  in  consultation  with  DNSAS  staff  members. \nThese will be adopted as DNSAS documents and be followed by the Project. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\nA financial management assessment questionnaire and interviews were used to review the \n19. \npresent standing of financial management of DNSAS. The completed questionnaire and interview \nfindings are set out in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Management  \n\nSupplementary  Appendix  K,  discusses  in  detail  DNSAS  financial  management  issues \n\n20. \nunder these headings: accounting, budgeting, and auditing. \n \nDuring  project  implementation,  the  Project  will  need  to  develop  accounting  and  reporting \n21. \nsystems 4 to  enable  generation  of  suitable  financial  reports  including  total  project  expenditure \nincurred,  amount  eligible  for  ADB  financing,  amount  already  claimed  from  ADB,  amount \nreimbursed by ADB, and amount disallowed and/or pending for reimbursement.  \n \n22. \nDetailed budgets are prepared by each unit and division of DNSAS and compiled by the \nfinance  division.  These  are  forwarded  to  MOI  for  approval  and  then  finally  to  MOF.  The  overall \nbudget  is  approved  by  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  finally  by  Parliament.  Any  changes  to  the \nbudget must be approved by Treasury, which can only authorize changes of plus or minus 15%.  \n \n23. \nDNSAS  has  no  internal  audit  function.  Special  audits  of  DNSAS  projects  may  be \nundertaken  by  MOI  or  MOF,  but  this  is  not  common.  DNSAS  is  not  required  to  have  its  own \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to Timor-Leste for Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement.

The \nProject will need to arrange for an independent audit of project finances and transactions. \n \n\n2. \n\nConclusion  \n\n24. \nThe  financial  sustainability  of  the  Dili  urban  water  sector  is  dependent  on  (i)  developing \nsubzone  projects  with  improved  water  supply  services;  (ii)  metering  and  billing  households  and \nnondomestic customers in the subzone project areas, and payment for improved water services; \n(iii) reducing water losses over the whole Dili water supply system; and (iv) billing all commercial \ncustomers. The physical intervention under the sector Project plus ongoing capacity development \nwill  result  in  improved  cost  recovery  and  financial  sustainability  of  the  Dili  urban  water  supply \nsystem. \n \n25. \nIn  terms  of  financial  management,  DNSAS  financial,  accounting,  and  reporting  systems \nare  part  of  the  overall  government  accounting  system.  DNSAS  has  limited  financial  autonomy. \nThe government accounting system provides adequate safeguards over the control and reporting \nof government expenditure against annual budget heads.  \n \n26. \nHowever,  in  terms  of  project  accounting  and  reporting,  the  Project  will  need  to  maintain \nseparate accounts and prepare separate financial statements. These will then need to be audited \nby an international accountant engaged by the Project.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR \n \n\n1. \nInternational  donors  active  in  the  water  supply  sector  and  water  resources  in  Timor-Leste \ninclude  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID),  European  Commission,  French  Cooperation,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \n(JICA), New Zealand International Aid & Development Agency, Norwegian Water Resources and \nEnergy  Directorate,  Portugal  Cooperation,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  \nWorld  Bank,  various  United  Nations  agencies,  and  World  Health  Organization.  Most  of  these \npartners are only active in the rural areas of Timor-Leste and unless they have implications for the \nactivities  of  the  Dili  Urban  Water  Supply  Sector  Project  are  not  discussed  in  this  appendix.  The \nGovernment  of  Portugal,  through  Aguas  de  Portugal  Timor-Leste  (Portugal  Water  Timor-Leste), \nand the German Technical Cooperation upgraded components of the water supply system in the \nsecond city, Baucau. \n \nA. \n\nExternal Assistance with Implications for the Project \n\n1. \n\nUnited Nations \n\n2. \nThe  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  (UNTAET)  established  an \nOffice of Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) in 2001 as the government agency responsible for \ndeveloping,  managing,  operating,  and  maintaining  urban  and  rural  water  supply  systems \nthroughout  Timor-Leste.  The  office  also  played  a  key  coordination  role  with  the  activities  of  the \nmultidonor Trust Fund for East Timor. UNTAET formulated sector policies and a legal framework \n(Appendix 2). Phases I and II of the Water Supply and Rehabilitation Project were funded by the \ntrust fund and administered by ADB (paras. 4\u20135). \n \n\n2. \n\nAustralian Agency for International Development  \n\n3. \nAusAid  recently  completed  its  Community  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  after  5 \nyears of implementation in Cova Lima, Bobonaro, and Viqueque districts. This project focused on \ninstalling  small  village  and  multivillage  gravity-flow  systems,  and  establishing  community-based \nongoing management arrangements. A successor project, the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject  commenced  in  September  2007,  with  AusAID  committing  $45  million  equivalent  over  10 \nyears.  AusAID  support  includes  capacity  building  for  the  National  Directorate  for  Water  Supply \nand  Sanitation  (DNSAS)  and  the  Ministry  of  Health.  The  project  implementation  consultants,  as \nwell  as  consultants  engaged  under  the  ADB  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement \ntechnical  assistance  (TA), 1 should  coordinate  closely  with  the  Community  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Project.  \n \n\n3. \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\n4. \nThe  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Rehabilitation  Project,  phase  I  operated  from  August \n2000  until  December  2001.2 With  a  budget  of  $4.5  million,  the  project  objective  was  to  provide \nsustainable water supply and sanitation using appropriate technology. The scope was to restore \ndamaged  water  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure,  and  build  institutional  capacity  to  manage \nand operate the system. Among its outputs, the project produced many standards and standard \ndrawings,  which  DNSAS  has  adopted.  These  standards  will  be  adopted  and  followed  by  the \nsector Project with some minor improvements to reduce the impact of intentional damage. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006.

Manila (Grant 8185-TIM).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\nThe Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project, phase II operated from July 2001 \n5. \nuntil 30 April 2003.3 This project also had a budget of $4.5 million with objectives to improve the \ncapacity  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  services;  and  help  implement  priority  projects  in  Dili, \ndistricts, subdistricts, and villages. \n \n6. \nThe  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  TA  operated  from  March  2004  until \nFebruary 2006.4 It was to create a national water policy to lead to the adoption and progressive \nimplementation of an integrated approach to water resource management in Timor-Leste. A draft \nnational water resources policy was prepared and endorsed by the project steering committee and \nthe Prime Minister; however, the policy has yet to be formally adopted.  \n \n7. \nThe ongoing Infrastructure Sectors Capacity Development TA aims to improve the delivery \nof  infrastructure  services,  including  water  supply,  by  providing  training  and  logistical  support  to \nrelevant ministries.5 The Infrastructure Project Management TA supports project management of \nthe  Government\u2019s  own-funded  infrastructure  capital  program. 6  A  TA-funded  procurement \nspecialist will be available to assist the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) in undertaking procurement \nfor  the  Project.  TA-funded  safeguard  specialists  will  be  available  to  help  DNSAS  undertake \nenvironmental  and  social  impact  assessment  and  management  for  the  Project.  The  Dili  Water \nSupply Performance Improvement TA (footnote 1) is intended to directly support the Project. The \nTA  will  provide  formal  and  informal  training  for  (i)  reduction  of  nonrevenue  water,  (ii)  network \nmodeling  and  drawing  office  management,  (iii)  water  meter  management,  (iv) customer  service, \nand (v) distribution planning and management.  \n \n\n4. \n\nJapan International Cooperation Agency \n\nJICA  has  invested  heavily  in  urban  water  supply  infrastructure  and  has  a  program \n8. \ncontinuing in district towns. Total JICA investment in Dili is approximately $25 million equivalent. \nRecent  JICA  support  has  rehabilitated  or  replaced  headworks,  water  treatment  plants,  and \nreservoirs.  A  comprehensive  network  of  primary  and  secondary  water  mains  has  been \nconstructed  throughout  all  10  zones  of  the  Dili  water  supply  system.  In  many  cases,  these  new \ngalvanized  steel  mains  have  yet  to  be  connected  to  the  existing  network  of  mains,  and  tertiary \nmains serving neighborhoods do not exist. This JICA program in Dili has concluded.  \n \nJICA also proposes a study on community-based integrated watershed management. The \n9. \nobjectives of this study are to develop a community-based watershed management plan for Laclo \nand Comoro river basins, both of which are in the Dili urban water supply catchment; and prepare \ncommunity-based watershed management guidelines for use in other areas. \n \n10. \nJICA intends to conduct capacity development work within DNSAS aimed at improving the \nmanagement,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  new  water  supply  infrastructure.  The  assistance  is \nlikely to target the operations of water treatment plants.    \n \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.    2001.

Project  design \nshould ensure stakeholders fully understand the distinction between policy formulation and policy \nimplementation, and implementation support should be fully resourced. Awareness raising should \nbe continuous and appropriately resourced. Project design should capture synergy  opportunities \namong  complementary  externally  supported  programs.  Legislation  and  formal  national  policy \nshould be drafted first in the Portuguese language.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n Item \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \n \n \nC. \n \n \n\u2014 =   \na  \nb  \nc \nd \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n($\u2019000) \n \n\n \n\n \n\nInvestment Costs a  \n1  Mechanical and Equipment (plus installation) \na.

Its  outputs  in  three  target  water  supply  zones \nwill be replicated progressively across the remainder of Dili\u2019s seven zones, the Bacau city service \narea, and other district centers. The technically oriented capacity building outputs will support this \nrollout.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-supported  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance \nImprovement technical assistance (TA) project will directly support the sector Project.1 The TA will \nprovide  formal  and  informal  training  for  (i)  the  reduction  of  nonrevenue  water,  (ii)  network \nmodeling  and  drawing  office  management,  (iii)  water  meter  management,  (iv)  customer  service, \n(v) customer relations, and (vi) distribution planning and management.  \n \nProject detailed engineering design and documentation, and construction supervision will \n2. \nbe  undertaken  by  a  firm  procured  by  the  Government,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  This  package  is  expected  to \ninclude one international resident engineer and one national water supply engineer, each for the \nduration  of  the  Project, as  well  as  a  national  survey  and  design  technician  for  15 months  and  a \nnational  construction  superviser  for  26  months.  Together  with  necessary  logistical  support,  the \nestimated cost of the design and construction supervision consulting services is $723,350.  \n \nThe  remainder  of  these  outline  terms  of  reference  relates  to  consulting  services  to  help \n3. \nDNSAS  implement  the  Project  and  is  separate  from  the  design  and  construction  supervision \nconsultant services package. \n \nA. \n\nScope \n\n4. \nConsultants engaged for project implementation will support the operations divisions of the \nNational  Directorate  for  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (DNSAS)  in  (i)  project  management, \n(ii) definition of candidate subprojects, (iii) preparation of bidding documents, (iv) socioeconomic \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  (v)  project  accounting,  and  (vi) financial  reporting  and  auditing. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). All project implementation consulting services \nwill be provided by a firm selected through international competition using quality-and cost-based \nselection.  A  total  of  104  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  project \nimplementation. The estimated cost of consulting services is $1,036,300 (Table A6).  \n \nB. \n\nDeployment of Consultants \n\n5. \nThe Project is scheduled to commence on 1 July 2008 and to operate over 29 months until \n30 November 2010. The wet season months of December to March inclusive, are characterized \nby  monsoonal  rains  and  this  was  considered  in  preparing  the  project  implementation  schedule, \nand accordingly, the schedule of inputs by project implementation consultants. \n \n6. \nThe assignments of the consultants will require substantial experience in their respective \nfields.  Preference  will  be  given  to  international  consultants  with  experience  in  Southeast  Asia; \nfluency in English will be essential for all consultants.  \n \n7. \nFour  international  consultants  (total  of  36  person-months)  and  six  national  consultants \n(68 person-months) are to be engaged (Figure A6). The international consultants will include (i) a \nproject  management  specialist  who  will  be  the  team  leader\u201427  person-months  provided \nthroughout  the  life  of  the  Project  with  two  1-month  breaks  during  the  wet  season  of  2009  and \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Dili  city  was \nselected  because  it  has  the  largest  water  and  financial  losses.  If  Dili  remains  such  a  drain  on \nresources,  the  National  Directorate  for  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (DNSAS)  will  be  unable  to \ncommit sufficient resources to improve water supplies in other urban centers and rural areas.  \n \n2. \nDili  city  is  divided  into  10  geographic  water  supply  zones.  Three  zones  (2,  4,  and  5)  are \nselected  for  candidate  subprojects.  Subprojects  have  been  selected  in  subzones  within  each  of \nthese three water supply zones, Subzone boundaries will be determined by the technical location \nof  the  existing  water  supply  pipe  network,  as  well  as  the  location  of  control  valves.  Subzones \nconsist of a discreet section within the water supply network where water flow can be controlled \nand managed. Each subzone, or subproject, will include approximately 1,000 water services. \n \nWhile the technical reasons for the selection of subzones took precedence, consideration \n3. \nwas also given to the social and political implications of subzone sites and boundaries. Hydraulic \nboundaries cannot always be contiguous with suco (neighborhood administration) boundaries; the \nmanagement  of  water  supply  in  a  subzone  will  increase  in  difficulty  as  the  number  of  sucos \nincreases. Similarly, if cost recovery, either in total or in part, is to be an output of the subproject, \nthen the socioeconomic status of the households within the subzone will be a key consideration. \nThe upgrading of subzones throughout the Dili water supply area is the ultimate aim of the sector \nProject. Issues of local political boundaries and socioeconomics affecting affordability and security \nmust be addressed.   \n \nA.   \n\nProcedures for Subproject Selection  \n\n4. \nThe Development and Planning Division of DNSAS will identify candidate subprojects that \nmeet the established criteria (paras. 6\u20138). The division will obtain DNSAS approval to assess the \nfeasibility  of  the  candidate  subprojects.  DNSAS  will  then  prepare  a  subproject  appraisal  report \n(SPAR) or feasibility study for each candidate subproject. SPAR will provide  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\ntechnical analysis and description,  \nsubproject rationale,  \nscope and components, \ncost estimates and financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, \nan initial environmental examination, and \na resettlement plan, as required. \n\n \n5. \nDNSAS  will  submit  each  SPAR  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  review  and \napproval  on  a  no-objection  basis.  The  SPAR  will  contain  sufficient  evidence  of  the  candidate \nsubproject\u2019s eligibility under the agreed criteria and be prepared in accordance with the detail and \nquality required to enable ADB to assess the viability and suitability of the subproject.

Its  outputs  in  six  water  supply  subzones  will  be  replicated \nprogressively throughout Dili, the second city, Bacau, and in other district centers. The Project\u2019s \nintended outputs are (i) water losses reduced and controlled in six subzones within Dili; (ii) visible \nleaks reduced and commercial and bulk customers metered in all 10 zones in Dili; and (iii) skills of \nNational  Directorate  for  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (DNSAS)  technical  and  operations  and \nmaintenance  staff  upgraded  in  leak  detection,  leak  reduction,  distribution  planning,  and \ndistribution management. Subproject Appraisal Reports (SPARS) have been prepared for the first \nthree  subprojects  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The  remaining  three  SPARs  will  be  prepared \nduring Project implementation.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Implementation Schedule \n\n2. \nProject implementation is scheduled to commence on 1 July 2008 and to operate over a \nperiod of 29 months until 30 November 2010. The rainy season months of December to March, \ninclusive,  are  characterized  by  monsoonal  rains.  This  and  the  large  number  of  religious  and \nnational holidays in the last few weeks of the year have been taken into account in preparing the \nproject  implementation  schedule,  as  well  as  schedule  of  inputs  by  the  project  implementation \nconsultants.  The  schedules  for  project  implementation  consultants  can  be  found  in  Appendix  6, \nand the project implementation schedule is set out in Figure A8.  \n \n\nFigure A8: Project Implementation Schedule \n\nItem \n \nWet Season \n \nProject Preimplementation \n \nProject Implementation \n \nComponent One \nWater Loss Reduction in Target Zones \nImplement Core Subproject 1 \nImplement Core Subproject 2 \nImplement Core Subproject 3 \nDesign and Implement Subproject 4 \nDesign and Implement Subproject 5 \nDesign and Implement Subproject 6 \n \nComponent Two  \nReduce Water Loss and Install Commercial \nMetering in all 10 Water Zones \n \nComponent Three \nDNSAS Staff Skills Upgrade \n \n\n2008 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDNSAS = National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation. \n\n           Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n49\n\nPROCUREMENT PLAN AND CONTRACT PACKAGES \n \n\n     Project Information \n\nCountry \nName of Recipient \nProject Name \nGrant Reference \nDate of Effectiveness \nAmount US$ (total from all financiers): \nOf which Committed, US$ \nExecuting Agency \nApproval Date of Original Procurement Plan \nApproval of Most Recent Procurement Plan \nPublication for Local Advertisement  \nPeriod Covered by this Plan \n\ntbd = to be determined. \n \n\nProcurement Methods \nICB works \nICB goods \nNCB works \nNCB goods \n\nTimor-Leste  \nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste  \nDili Urban Water Supply Sector Project \nProject No. 38212 \ntbd \n$7,500,000 \ntbd \nMinistry of Infrastructure \ntbd \ntbd \ntbd \n18 months from signing of the Grant Agreement \n\nTo be used above/below ($) \nAt least $1,000,000  \nAt least $500,000  \nLess than $1,000,000   \nLess than $500,000  \n\n     Procurement Thresholds, Goods and Related Services, Works, and Supply and Install \n\nICB = international competitive bidding, NCB = national competitive bidding \n \n\n     Procurement Thresholds, Consultants Services \n\nProcurement Methods \nQuality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) \n\nTo be used above/below ($) \nAt least $200,000 \n\nList of Contract Packages in Excess of $100,000, Goods, Works, and Consulting Services \n \n\n \n\n \n \nRef \n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n \nContract \nDescription \nInstallation of \nwater supply \ninfrastructure \nProcurement of \npipes, fittings, \netc. \n\nProcurement of \nequipment and \nimplement \nprogram \nConsulting \nservices \n\n \nEstimated \nCost ($) \n2,385,000 \n(three \ncontracts) \n1,850,000 \n(two to three \ncontracts) \n\n125,000 \n(one contract) \n\n1,759,650 (two \nor three \ncontracts) \n\n \nProcurement \nMethod \nICB and NCB \n\nICB \n\nNCB \n\nExpected Date \nof \nAdvertisement \n3rd quarter 2008 \n4th quarter 2008 \n1st quarter 2009 \n3rd quarter 2008 \n(3rd quarter \n2008) \n1st quarter 2009 \n3rd quarter 2008 \n\n \nPrior \nReview  \nYes \n\n \n\n \n \nComments \n\nYes \n\nFinanced by ADB \n\nYes \n\nFinanced by ADB \n\nQCBS \n\n1st quarter 2008 \n3rd quarter 2008 \n\nYes \n\nFinanced by ADB \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, NCB = national competitive bidding, QCBS = \nquality- and cost-based selection. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fProposed Detailed Contract Packages \n \n\nAggregate Total \nCost Estimate \n($) \n\nMode of \nProcurement \n\nResponsible \nAgency \n\n5\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n9\n \n\ni\n\nDescription \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

Connected \nhouseholds receive an intermittent supply and often need to supplement their supplies with water \nfrom  neighbors  or  from  local  sources  such  as  wells  and  streams.  Overall  technical  and \nnontechnichal water losses are now estimated at 70% of water production. \n \nThe Project will complete the vertical integrity of the Dili water supply system in targeted \n3. \nzones, where subzone subproject areas have been selected. In these subzone areas, all leaks will \nbe repaired; tertiary reticulation refurbished, replaced, or installed; all households and businesses \nmetered;  and  24-hour  water  supply  with  good  pressure  provided.  Thus  physical  improvements \ntogether with improved system management and customer relations will achieve efficient delivery \nto regularized poor and nonpoor customers.   \n \n4. \nEconomic and health benefits will result from improved services. For this improved service, \ncustomers are expected to be willing to pay a tariff1 and will be billed accordingly. In addition for \nall  zones,  the  Project  will  repair  identified  leaks,  install  valves  and  master  meters,  implement \nlogical  improvements  to  the  pipe  network,  and  meter  all  commercial  customers  who  will  be \nexpected to pay the water tariff.   \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Assumptions \n\n5. \nFor the present study, the following assumptions are adopted (i) all costs are expressed in \nmid-2007 prices; (ii) tertiary pipes and fittings are assumed to have a useful economic life of 30 \nyears after construction; (iii) the Project is analyzed over 22 years from 2008 to 2029, or 20 years \nafter  construction  with  residual  values  assumed  in  year  20  for  project  assets  of  10  years; \n(iv) meters are assumed to be replaced every 5 years at a cost of $30 every 5 years; (v) the real \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  employed  in  the  economic  analysis  is  12%;  (vi)  capital  costs  include \nphysical  contingencies,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  (no  financing  charges  are  applicable  as \nthe funds are provided as a grant); (vii) a standard conversion factor of 1.0 and a shadow wage \nrate of 0.50 are assumed; (viii) taxes and duties on imported pipes and fittings are 6.0% and sales \ntax  6.0%,  a  total  of  12.0%  on  materials;  (ix)  water  losses  in  the  subzone  subproject  areas  are \nassumed  at  25%  compared  with  70%  in  the  without-Project  situation;  (x) operation  and \nmaintenance costs for the subzone subprojects are assumed at 2.5% of project capital costs, plus \nadditional maintenance and clerical staff. \n \n\n3. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n6. \nThe subzone subproject areas were selected using the given criteria with the main feature \nbeing  to  select  areas  where  water  supply  was  available  and  the  system  could  be  improved  in \n\n                                                 \n1  In  2005,  $32,000  revenue  was  collected  for  piped  water  sales  from  those  billed  and  paying  (2%  of  uses),  and \n\nrepresented 2.6% of operating costs; in 2006, $58,000 collected represented 7.5%. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\norder to demonstrate that customers would be willing to pay for an improved water supply. This \nmodel  is  to  be  progressively  replicated  in  the  Dili  area  and  in  district  towns  in  the  future. \nConsiderable  investment  has  been  made  in  water  sources,  water  treatment,  and  bulk \ntransmission  mains  in  Dili.  However,  unless  investment  in  the  tertiary  network,  customer \nconnections,  and  metering  is  undertaken,  the  benefits  of  this  additional  investment  and  water \nsupply  cannot  be  realized.  Accordingly,  investments  in  leak  reduction,  upgrading  tertiary \nconnections,  and  metering  are  necessary  throughout  the  Dili  urban  area  and  in  the  subzone \nsubproject areas selected.  \n \n\n2. \n\nWater Demand Projections \n\n7. \nDemand  projections  for  2008\u20132020  in  three  subproject  areas  were  prepared  in  line  with \nADB  guidelines,  which  relate  demand  to  expected  future  increases  in  income  and  changes  in \nwater price. Water demand forecasts are based on the estimated number of potential connections \nin  2007  multiplied  by  the  estimated  consumption,  which  is  70  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd)  for \ndomestic  connections  and  1,000  lpd/connection  for  commercial  connections.  No  additional \ncustomers are assumed over the forecast period.2 The inclusion of both price and income effects \nresults  in  consumption  increases  in  excess  of  the  lifeline  block  of  70  lpcd.  The  conservative \nassumption  adopted  is  that  households  take  advantage  of  the  lifeline  block  up  to  70  lpcd  or  14 \ncubic  meters  (m3)  per  month,  while  consumption  above  this  may  be  met  by  existing  nonpiped \nsources rather than an increase in piped water consumption.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Costs  \n\n8. \nCapital  costs  are  based  on  estimates  of  costs  of  rehabilitating  the  tertiary  piped  network \nand  household  connections,  plus  providing  connections  and  meters  under  the  Project  to  all \nunconnected  households  in  the  subproject  areas.  In  addition,  project  management  and  detailed \ndesign  are  allocated  to  each  subzone  subproject.  Adequate  water  supply  is  available  in  the \nwithout-project situation. Accordingly incremental operating costs for the subzone subprojects are \nassumed  to  be  (i)  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  maintaining  pipes  and  connections  at \n2.5% of project capital costs, (ii) replacement of meters every 5 years at a cost of $30 per meter, \n(iii)  chlorination  of  all  water  at  a cost  of  $0.0069/m3,  and  (iv)  provision  of  additional  caretaker  or \nmaintenance staff and clerical staff.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n9. \nBenefits are associated with (i) providing household connections (62.4% of households in \nproject  zones)  using  nonpiped  sources,  (ii)  improving  water  supply  treatment  and  distribution  by \nproviding  24-hour  service  in  areas  currently  experiencing  interrupted  service,  (iii)  increasing \nsecurity  of  supply,  (iv)  improving  drinking  water  quality,  (v)  improving  system  pressure,  and  \n(vi)  reducing  risk  of  exposure  to  waterborne  pathogens.  Decreased  water  losses  will  reduce \npumping  costs,  and  chemical  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  as  less  water  production  is \nrequired to meet water sales. Nondomestic water supply customers will benefit financially due to \nan improved supply without the need to resort to more costly tanker supplies. \n \n10. \ninclude the following: \n\nThe  valuation  of  benefits  is  based  on  the  water  supply  characteristics  of  each  zone  and \n\n                                                 \n2  Housing in Dili is relatively low density, but in the subproject areas chosen new or additional house construction on \nexisting  sites  is  not  anticipated.  Regarding  daily  water  consumption,  surveys  indicated  that  many  households  may \ncontinue  to  use  wells  for  clothes  washing  and  the  like,  so  that  overall  consumption  may  not  increase  above  levels \nproposed. However, there was a clear indication that such sources were not satisfactory and in case of hand pumps, \nphysically  demanding,  so  that  households  preferred  a  piped  connection.  But  some  use  of  non-piped  sources  may \ncontinue. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n53\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTime savings to collect water. Time taken in collecting a household\u2019s daily water \nrequirements was obtained as part of the socioeconomic survey, with an average \ndaily time of 90 minutes to collect an estimated 200 liters per household per day.  \nCost and maintenance of existing nonpiped facilities. Where households obtain \nwater from wells, both dug wells and tubewells (either with electric pumps or hand \npumps),  the  cost  of  providing  the  well, 3  maintenance,  and  electricity  are  be \nincluded as part of the without-project costs. \n\n(iii)  Costs of storage. The cost of buckets and storage facilities in houses is included \n\nin the without-project water supply costs at $20 per household.  \n\n(iv)  Boiling  water.  Most  households  boil  water  for  drinking  purposes  (assumed  at  \n5 lpcd) with these costs included in the without-project water supply costs.  \nBottled  water.  Use  of  bottled  water  is  widespread  (representing  0.5%  of \nconsumption) with the average at 0.95 liters per household per day. This is valued \nconservatively at $53 per m3.  \n\n(v) \n\n  \n11. \nThe  cost  of  water  consumption  in  the  without-Project  situation  that  is  displaced  by  piped \nwater supply results in resource cost savings. The convenience of a piped water source results in \ngreater  use  of  piped  water  than  that  in  the  without-Project  situation.  Also  improved  sanitation \npractices  will  lead  to  increased  water  use.  This  additional  water  consumption  is  incremental \nconsumption  induced  by  piped  water  supplies  as  a  result  of  lower  costs  and  other  positive \nexternalities  (such  as  improved  hygiene  practices  and  greater  convenience)  and  is  valued  in \nterms  of  willingness  to  pay.  The  resource  costs  of  water  in  the  without-Project  situation  is  an \nindication of the willingness to pay for the quantity of water consumed.  \n \nThe survey indicates the unskilled labor rate for casual labor at around $2.00 per day, with \n12. \na shadow wage rate factor of 0.50 assumed). Time savings combined with the cost of alternative \nwater sources results in a cost per m3 ranging from $2.2 to $2.8 per m3 to meet around 20 lpcd or \n$13.14\u2013$16.74  per  month  for  6  m3.  In  the  project  situation,  households  are  assumed  to  take \nadvantage of the 70 lpcd available within the lifeline block and consume up to 14.0 m3/month; at a \ntariff of $0.20 per m3, this represents a cost of $2.8 per month. \n \n13. \nThe  present  situation  with  and  without  the  Project  provides  a  basis  for  deriving  a \nhousehold  demand  curve  and  estimating  economic  benefits  of  incremental  consumption.  Using \nthe semi-log function,4 the economic benefit to households is estimated as $1.06 to $1.31 per m3. \nIn the case of commercial customers, the cost of tankering water of around $1.00 per m3 is used \nas  basis  of  benefit  valuation.  This  level  of  benefit  is  used  to  value  all  household  consumption \nwithout a piped connection, which represents approximately 60% of all domestic consumers in the \nsubzone. In the case of households with a piped connection, their hours of supply from the survey \nand whether the service was adequate were examined and a proportion of the economic benefit \nallocated to this consumption. Overall, this represents a further 6.9\u201310.3% of consumption valued \nat the  willingness to pay (WTP) value. \n \n14. \nEconomic  benefits  also  arise  from  a  reduction  in  water  production  requirements  with  the \nreduction  in  water  losses  in  the  subzone  subproject  areas  from  70%  to  25%.  The  reduction  in \nwater  production  will  result  in  savings  in  direct  electricity  pumping  costs  for  both  groundwater \n\n                                                 \n3  The  capital  cost  of  each  water  supply  option  is  expressed  as  an  annuity  at  12%  based  on  the  expected  life  of  the \n\n4  For derivation of the curve and benefit area under the curve, see Choynowski, Peter. 2002.

The EIRR of the Project exceeds 12%. The economic net present value at 12% is \n$1.336  million.  The  average  incremental  economic  cost  is  $0.86  per  m3.  An  analysis  to  test  the \nsensitivity of the EIRR of the combined subzone subprojects to adverse changes in key variables \nwas  undertaken.  The  variables  tested  were  increases  (+10%)  in  capital  and  operation  and \nmaintenance costs,  reduction in subproject benefits (\u201310%), and a 2-year delay.  \n \n16. \nThe  three  pilot  subprojects  are  most  sensitive  to  a  reduction  in  benefits,  with  the  EIRR \nfalling  to  18.8%  (Table  A10.1).  However,  where  delays  also  result  in  real  capital  cost  increases \n(20%)  and  a  2-year  delay  in  benefits  if  the  improvements  are  commissioned  later,  the  EIRR \ndeclines to 13.4%. Accordingly, efforts must be made in subproject design to avoid such delays \nand cost increases. Where water losses in the subproject areas are only reduced to 40%, rather \nthan 25%, then the EIRR falls to 19.8%. \n \n17. \nThe calculation of benefits was also examined, and where the value of time savings were \nhalved from $2.00 per day to $1.00 per day (or alternatively the shadow wage rate factor SWRF of \n0.50 halved to 0.25), then the EIRR fell to 18.5%. Where the value of time was reduced to zero so \nthat the domestic WTP was based on the cost of nonpiped water sources, wells, pumps, cost of \nboiling water, etc., the EIRR falls to 16.8% suggesting the results are not sensitive to the value of \ntime adopted in the analysis. In the case of commercial customers, if their WTP based on tanker \ndeliveries at $1.00 per m3 was reduced to the current commercial tariff of $0.60 per m3, the EIRR \nfalls to 19.1%. If the last two sensitivities are combined, namely zero value of time used in cost of \ncollecting  water  in  the  case  of  domestic  customers  and  commercial  customers  WTP  based  on \ncurrent tariff, then the EIRR falls to 15.7%. This indicates that the analysis is robust to the basis of \nbenefit calculation. \n \n\nTable A 10.1: Economic and Sensitivity Analyses for Three Subzone Sector Projects \nENPV \n$'000 \n\nSensitivity Analyses \n  \n\nEIRR \n% \n\nSV \n% \n\nSI \n% \n\n  \n\n+10% \n+10% \n\u201310% \n\nBase Case \n(i) Capital \n(ii) Operating \n(iii) Benefits \n(iv) All the above \n(v) Two-year delay \n(vi) Water losses 40% \n(vii) Reduce value of time by half \n(viii) Reduce value of time to zero \n(ix) Commercial WTP at tariff \n  \nEOCC \n\n1,336  \n1,135  \n1,293  \n958  \n715  \n310  \n1,269  \n1,051  \n765  \n1,144  \n\n  \n\n20.2 \n18. \n19.9 \n18.0 \n16.1 \n13.4 \n19.8 \n18.5 \n16.8 \n19.1 \n12.0 \n\n8.7 \n1.2 \n10.8 \n\n46.5 \n343.0 \n(37.4) \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n(  )  =  negative,  EIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  ENPV  =  economic  net  present  value,  EOCC  = \neconomic opportunity cost of capital, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value , WTP = willingness to \npay. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n55\n\nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\n18. \nFinancial  analysis  was  undertaken  of  the  three  subzone  pilot  subprojects  of  the  sector \nProject.  Financial  benefits  result  from  the  billing  and  payment  of  water  bills  in  the  subzone \nsubproject  areas  at  the  existing  tariff  (Appendix  11,  Table  A11.3)  for  domestic,  social,  and \ncommercial customers. Following the conflicts in 2006, all metering and billing of water customers \nwas suspended in April 2006 due to little incentive on the part of DNSAS to enforce payment from \na small proportion of the population.   \n \nAn optimistic revenue estimate, with the current declining water service, is for DNSAS to \n19. \nmaintain revenue at $50,000 per annum, with $20,000 more likely. Therefore, in the case of the \nsubzone  subprojects  an  allowance  has  been  made  to  reflect  the  fact  that  some  revenues  might \ncontinue to be paid. The initial three subzone subprojects represent about 13% of the population, \nbut  possibly  25%  of  revenue  potential  as  zones  2  and  5  have  some  commercial  customers. \nTherefore, 25% of $50,000 or $12,500 is assumed over the three zones.  \n \n20. \nAn allowance is made for collection efficiency, that is, the amount of billed water charges \nactually collected, assuming 50% in the first year (2010) increasing to 90% by year 4 (2013). In \naddition, DNSAS would benefit from reduced water losses from 70% to 25%, and from savings in \nelectricity and chemical costs as a result of a reduction in both technical and nontechnical losses.  \n \n\n1. \n\nCalculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n21. \nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated based on the opportunity cost \nto  the  Government  of  providing  equity  to  the  Project  and  adopting  the  same  value  for  the  ADB \ngrant  funding.  In  the  absence  of  any  Government  domestic  bond  market,  the  return  on  the \nGovernment's  investments  in  the  Petroleum  Fund  of  Timor-Leste  was  taken  as  a  proxy  for  the \nopportunity cost of capital. The Petroleum Fund will, in the future, be one of  the main sources of \nGovernment development financing. The average return on investments in 2006 in the fund of US \ntreasury bonds is estimated at around 5%. After adjusting for domestic inflation (4%), the WACC \nis 1.0% (Table A10.2). \n \n\nTable A10.2: Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n\nItem  \nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting \nNominal Cost \nInflation Rate \nReal Cost  \nWeighted Component of WACC \n\nADB Grant \n6.00 \n80.00 \n5.00 \n4.00 \n0.96 \n0.77 \n\nGovernment Equity \n\nTotal \n\n1.50 \n20.00 \n5.00 \n4.00 \n0.96 \n0.19 \n\n7.50 \n100.00 \n  \n  \n  \n1.00 \n\nADB =  Asian Development Bank , WACC =  weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nResults of Financial Analysis \n\n22. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for  the  three  subprojects  is  2.5%  for  the  pilot \nsubprojects, with benefits derived from revenues (at current tariffs) from water sales and savings \nin  chemical  and  electricity  costs  as  a  result  of  reduced  water  losses.  This  rate  compares \nfavourably with the estimated WACC at 1.0%, substantiating the financial viability of the Project. \nThe average incremental financial cost is $0.27 per m3 compared with  average  financial  tariff of \n$0.25 per m3. The financial net present value at the WACC is $ 0.588 million.  \n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSeparate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of the FIRR and financial net \n23. \npresent  value  to  adverse  changes  in  key  variables.  The  variables  considered  for  the  sensitivity \nanalyses  are  a  10%  increase  in  capital  costs,  10%  increase  in  O&M  costs,    10%  decrease  in \nbenefits,  and  2-year  implementation  delay  with  a  20%  increase  in  costs.  The  results  are  robust \nwith  the  standard  sensitivities  exceeding  the  WACC  (Table  A10.3).  However,  a  project-specific \nsensitivity  that  reflects  cost  increases  (20%)  and  a  2-year  delay  results  in  the  FIRR  declining  to \n1.2%. Thus the Project is most sensitive to delays associated with corresponding cost increases. \nAccordingly,  efforts  must  be  made  in  project  design  to  avoid  delays  and  cost  increases.  A  key \nobjective of the subzone projects is to reduce water losses. However, where water losses in the \nsubproject areas are only reduced to 40%, rather than 25%, then the EIRR falls to 1.9%. \n \n24. \nAnother  project-specific  sensitivity  relates  to  collection  efficiency.  The  analysis  assumes \nthat  a  collection  efficiency  of  90%  is  achieved  by  year  4  of  each  subproject.  This  is  considered \nachievable with the institutional and technichal support provided under the Project and associated \nprojects,  plus  expected household wiilingness  to  pay  for  the  24-hour  provision  of good  pressure \nand  clean  water.  The  senstivity  indicates  that  where  collection  efficiency  falls  to  an  average  of \n80%,  then  the  FIRR  is  1.8%;  however  at  70%  collection  efficiency  the  FIRR  falls  to  1.1%. \nConsequently,  at  collection  efficiencies  less  than  70%,  the  FIRR  will  be  lower  than  the  WACC. \nThe results are very sensitive to collection efficiency; every effort is needed, including adherence \nto disconnection policies, to ensure that more than 70% and preferably a collection efficiency of \n90% is achieved. \n \n\n  \n\nTable A10.3: Financial Analysis and Sensitivity for Subzone Core Subprojects \nFNPV \n$'000 \n558  \n370  \n437  \n193  \n(116)  \n125  \n333  \n319  \n64  \n\n \nSensitivity Analyses  \nBase Case \n(i) Capital \n(ii) Operating \n(iii) Benefits \n(iv) All the above \n(v) Two-year delay \n(vi) Water losses 40% \n(vii) Collection efficiency 80% \n(viii) Collection efficiency 70% \nWACC \n\nSV \n% \n  \n25.7 \n47.1 \n(15.5) \n  \n  \n \n \n \n\nFIRR \n% \n2.5 \n1.9 \n2.1 \n1.5 \n0.7 \n1.2 \n1.9 \n1.8 \n1.1 \n1.0 \n\nSI \n% \n  \n23.7 \n12.9 \n39.4 \n\n+10% \n+10% \n\u201310% \n\n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n(  )  =  negative  value,  FIRR  =  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  FNPV  =  financial  net  present  value,  SI  = \nsensitivity indicator, SV = switching value, WACC = weighted average cost of capital.                        . \nSource:  ADB.  2005.

In FY2007, Dili accounted for about 81% \nof the DNSAS operating budget. If sanitation services are added to the total, then Dili represents \nabout  74%  of  DNSAS\u2019s  overall  operating  budget.  Operation  and  maintenance  materials  and \nequipment make up the largest item of expenditure at $0.516 million (47%) and include materials \nrequired  for  leak  repairs,  maintenance  of  water  treatment  plants,  contractor  payments,  etc.; \nfollowed  by  electricity  and  fuel  (22%);  other  operating  expenses  (including  internally  displaced \npersons camps) 15%; and staff costs of 10%. \n \nC. \n\nWater Tariffs and Revenue Generation \n\n4. \nIn  February  2004,  the  Council  of  Ministers  approved  the  current  tariff  structure,  with \ncharges levied for each cubic meter consumed on a monthly basis, for Dili urban area and district \ntowns (Table A11.3).

With  the  disturbances  in  April  2006,  all  billing  of  Dili \ncustomers  ceased.  DNSAS  revenue  generation  is  set  out  in  Table  A11.4  and  shows  that  in \nFY2005  water  billing  revenues  accounted  for  $32,400  (39%  of  revenues)  and  in  FY2006  water \nbilling  revenues  increased  to  $58,000  (55%  of  total  revenues).  In  2006,  revenues  of  $105,300 \nrepresented about 12.6% of the Dili water supply operating costs, with water tariffs representing \n7.0%.  \n \n6. \nThe  2004  decree  also  provided  charges  for  water  connections  for  Dili  and  districts,  with \nthose  for  the  districts  lower  in  recognition  of  lower  incomes  and  the  need  to  encourage \nconnections. Domestic customers may pay 50% upfront and the balance in installments over the \nfollowing  12  months.  All  other  customer  classes,  including  social,  are  required  to  pay  the \nconnection fee upfront. The project estimate is $192.2 for a 15 mm diameter connection, while the \nDNSAS  cost  would  be  $153.30  (where  households  undertake  their  own  excavation  and \nbackfilling)  compared  with  $55  per  domestic  connection  charge.

The  Water  Law  also  provides  for  disconnection  and \nreconnection policies (Section 15) for nonpayment of water tariffs, connection fees, or interfering \nwith  and/or  damaging  a  connection.  However,  to  date  such  regulations  have  not  been  enforced \nand enforcement capacity has generally been lacking. \n \n9. \nThese  may  be  compared  with  tariff  policies  and  objectives  developed  related  to \ninternational best practice. These objectives3 are of particular importance in developing water tariff \nstructures  and  levels  for  Dili,  namely  (i)  financial  sustainability  and  cost  recovery,  (ii)  economic \nefficiency, (iii) price equity, (iv) administrative efficiency and good governance, and (v) affordability \nand universal access. The Water Services Decree Law 4/2004 overall tariff policy objectives are in \naccord with international best practice (Supplementary Appendix K). \n \n10. \nAn estimate of the capital and operating costs for Dili was used to assess tariffs to meet \nO&M 4  costs,  O&M  plus  depreciation, 5  and  a  5%  return  on  net  fixed  assets.  Assuming  the \npostproject reduction in water losses at 25% (compared with 70% now) and a collection efficiency \nof 90% (compared with less than 10% when billing ceased in April 2006), a tariff of $0.19 per m3 \nwould be required to cover O&M costs, $0.40 per m3  to cover O&M plus depreciation; and $0.56 \nper m3 to achieve a 5% rate of return.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The water supply legislation framework was developed with external assistance in 2001. \n2  Decree-Law 2004/4 was approved in 2004 \n3  ADB. 2006.

In the case of the \nsocial category of customers, the current tariff of $0.15 per m3 would not cover cash O&M costs, \nhowever,  social  customers  are  expected  to  represent  1.25%  of  customers.  The  average  tariff  in \nthe  subzone  areas  is  $0.25  per  m3  meaning  that  overall  O&M  costs  are  recovered  with  cross \nsubsidy from commercial and industrial to the domestic and social customer categories. \n \n12. \nIn view of the current economic situation in Dili, the current tariff structure is recommended \nto  be  adopted  in  the  subzone  subprojects.  With  a  reduction  in  water  losses  to  25%  (and  a \ncollection  efficiency  of  90%),  this  tariff  structure  would  recover  operating  costs,  which  is  the \nfinancial  objective  of  current  water  tariff  policy  of  the  Public  Water  Supply  Decree.  In  addition, \nwater connections are to be free for households participating in the subprojects as an incentive to \nparticipate.  This  is  seen  as  equitable  where  exiting  customers  with  damaged  connections  and \nmeters  would  have  these  replaced  under  the  Project.  The  project  capital  costs  provide  for  new \nconnections  as  well  as  replacement  items.  The  objective  is  to  instill  a  payment  for  service \nphilosophy in customers in the subzone areas. Tariffs can be adjusted in the future as economic \ncircumstances improve and household incomes in Dili increase. \n \nE. \n\nFinancial Impact of the Project on DNSAS Dili Operations \n\nThe objective is to have Dili water supply providing a 24-hour service by 2014 with good \n13. \npressure  treated  water,  with  all  customers  metered  and  charged  a  tariff.  This  would  allow  water \nproduction to be measured in terms of metered sales. Prior to this, where only those domestic and \nsocial customers within the subzone subprojects were metered, and commercial customers in all \nzones, domestic water use could not be limited so that there would be wastage, with production \nassumed  at  maximum  for  the  system,  rather  than  that  required  to  meet  metered  sales  (and \nlosses). Consequently by 2014, when all customers are metered and billed, production would be \nrelated to sales and average water losses of 35%.  \n \n14. \nAs  limited  information  is  available  on  DNSAS  district  operations,  projections  of  DNSAS \noperations  were  prepared  for  Dili  only.  As  Treasury  operates  on  a  cash  accounting  basis, \ndepreciation was excluded. No balance sheet information is available with all DNSAS accounting \nundertaken by Treasury with DNSAS allocated all operating and capital requirements through the \nstate budget. Projections of revenues and expenditures were prepared (in constant 2007 prices) \nfor  2008\u20132020  with  the  objective  of  achieving  coverage  of  operating  costs  through  the  tariff  by \n2017. Forecasts of water demand are based on population projections for Dili assuming a 5% per \nannum  population  growth  rate,  with  revenue  projections  based  on  metering  and  billing  all \ncustomers  in  subzone  subprojects  and  all  commercial  customers  throughout  Dili.  A  collection \nefficiency  of  50%  in  the  first  year  rising  to  90%  after  4  years  is  assumed  for  DNSAS  revenue \ngeneration. \n \n \n\nCapital Expenditure  \n\n1. \n\n15. \nTable  A11.5  summarizes  capital  expenditure  under  the  Project  and  ongoing  expenditure \nover the forecast period. Projected capital expenditure totals $17.1 million during 2008\u20132020 (in \n2007  prices).  The  Project  will  provide  $7.5  million  during  2008\u20132010  with  an  estimated  $9.60 \nmillion required for the remainder of the period.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n61\n\nIn the future, DNSAS is to receive $2.0 million per annum for capital expenditure from the \n16. \nstate budget, which would cover some of the balance.6 A second subzone improvement project is \nassumed  to  commence  in  2010,  while  upgrading  the  whole  network  would  also  continue.  This \nmay involve an overall project cost of $5.0 million, which may require external funding assistance \nwhere  DNSAS  has  available  from  the  state  budget  about  $1.0  million  for  Dili  per  annum. \nThereafter, during 2013\u20132020, DNSAS should be able to fund capital expenditure out of its state \nbudget allocation, as it would be less than $1.0 million per annum, and new connections have an \nelement of cost recovery (20%). \n\n \nTable A11.5: Estimated Capital Expenditure Dili Water Supply  \n(FY ended 30 June, $\u2019000) \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\n2020 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n1,477.1 \n\n369.3 \n\n  1,284.0 \n\n321.0 \n\n  1,284.0 \n\n321.0 \n\n  1,284.0 \n\n321.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,266.9 \n\n316.7 \n\n500.0 \n\n500.0 \n\n540.5 \n\n540.5 \n\n270.2 \n\n100.0 \n\n50.0 \n\n50.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  150.0  100.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0 \n\n55.7 \n\n55.7 \n\n609.9 \n\n602.9  174.5  184.5  456.7  494.1  534.1  576.8 \n\n3,440.1  2,666.1  2,475.2  2,305.0  1,573.9  1,252.9  274.5  284.5  586.7  594.1  784.1  776.8  100.0 \n\nItem \nSubzone sector  \n   projects \nADB Year 1  \n(3 zones) \nADB Year 1  \n(3 zones) \nNew Year 3  \n(3 zones) \nNew Year 4  \n(3 zones) \nMetering  \n   domestic \nAll zones  \n   improvements \n\nDetailed design \nEquipment and  \n   miscellaneous \nWater  \n   production \nTotal Capital   \n   Grants \n\n \n \n\nNote: All figures are calculated in 2007 prices. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2.  Results of Financial Projections \n\n \n\nOver  the  whole  Dili  water  supply  service  area  (compared  with  subzones)  with  increased \n17. \noperating costs to provide improved services, the existing tariff revenues would only meet 80% of \noperating costs in 2017 and 90% by 2020. Real tariff7 increases of 29% in 2014 to cover operating \nshortfalls by 2017 are set out in Table A11.6. The largest increase (65%) is proposed in the social \ncategory  to  bring  the  tariff  into  line  with  the  lifeline  domestic  category,  followed  by  commercial \n(50%),  with  the  domestic  lifeline  increased  by  25%  to  $0.25  per  m3,  and  then  above  14  m3  per \nmonth by 25% to $0.50 per m3.8 The tariff for public taps would remain at the present tariff. The \nprovision of lifeline block and public taps should be adequate protection for the poor. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n6  Although this amount is to cover all other DNSAS projects in Timor-Leste district towns etc., if 50% were allocated to \n\nDili from 2010 to 2020, this would amount to $11.0 million, which would be adequate. \n\n7  Any actual tariff adjustments would need to take into account any inflationary increases in costs during 2008\u20132014. \n8  Were  the  tariff  structure  is  also  to  be  revised,  then  the  lifeline  block  should  be  reduced  from  14  m3  to  10  m3  per \nmonth, a second block of 10 m3 to 20 m3 per month at $0.50 per m3 included, with all consumption above 20.0 m3 per \nmonth  charged  at  the  commercial  rate  of  $0.90  per  m3.  In  addition,  churches  and  mosques  and  other  social \nnonrevenue generating activities should be included in a tariff category with the same structure as domestic. On the \nother hand, all government departments and agencies should be treated as commercial and pay a flat tariff with the \namount provided in their state budget funding.

The  revised  water  tariff  results  in  a \nmonthly  charge  for  25  m3  of  $8.9  per  month  in  2015  compared  with  $7.1  per  month  with  the \ncurrent tariff, representing 3.7% of average household income, which is similar to the current tariff, \nwhere incomes grow at 3.75% per annum.10 In the case of a low-income household, the monthly \ncharge is now $3.5 per month compared with $2.8 per month, which represents 3.2% of income \nfor a low (bottom quartile) income household compared with 3.0% under the current tariff, where \nincomes grow at 2.5% per annum. At these levels, current water tariffs are regarded as affordable, \nand below the 4\u20135% affordability threshold. \n\n                                                 \n9   This assumes any impact on consumption due to real price increases. However, income elasticity of demand effects \nover  the  period  would  probably  mean  that  increases  in  consumption  would  offset  any  price  elasticity  of  demand \neffects related to the tariff increase. \n\n10  Assuming real increase in gross domestic product of 5.0% per annum over the forecast period. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n63\n\nSUMMARY OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\n \n1. \nThe  due  diligence  undertaken  for  the  three  core  subprojects  appraised  show  no  land \nacquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  Due  diligence  to  be  undertaken  for  candidate \nsubprojects should show there to be no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts, and \nthe  Project\u2019s  agreed  subproject  selection  criteria  preclude  any  candidate  subproject  that  would \nrequire  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  However,  since  the  Project  uses  a  sector \nmodality,  a  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Framework  (LARF)  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance with the ADB Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Operations Manual Section \nF2/IBP on involuntary resettlement (2006). The LARF will be available to guide later Government-\nfunded  urban  water  supply  improvements  in  Dili  and  other  centers.  The  LARF  provides  a \nmechanism to screen candidate subprojects and\u2013if the need arises\u2014provide guidance on how to \nprepare  and  implement  subsequent  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  procedures  (LARP).  This \nAppendix summarizes the full LARF contained in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n2. \nLand  ownership  issues  in  Timor-Leste  are  clouded  by  inadequate  legal  and  regulation \nframework  resulting  in  insecure  land  and  property  rights. 1  The  principles  and  policies  on  land \nacquisition and compensation under this LARF are therefore based on the ADB policy. \n \n3. \nNotwithstanding the ineligibility under the Project of candidate subprojects with possible land \nacquisition  or  resettlement  requirements,  subproject  implementation  will  comply  with  the  agreed \npolicy  principles  contained  in  paragraph  9  of  Supplementary  Appendix  G,  and  with  due \nconsideration of the customs and traditions of the people in the subproject site. For any subproject \nwith possible resettlement impacts, DNSAS will carry out (or commission consultants to carry out) \na social impact assessment, based on preliminary technical designs. The LARP will also include \nmeasures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of vulnerable groups are \nidentified, and ensure that land acquisition and resettlement does not disadvantage them.  \n \nSubproject screening is used to identify the types and nature of potential impacts related to \n4. \nthe  activities  proposed  under  the  Project,  and  to  provide  adequate  measures  to  address  these \nimpacts which ensure that potential affected persons are (i) informed of their options and rights; \n(ii) included in the consultation and participation in the selection of alternatives; and (iii) provided \nwith  prompt  and  effective  compensation  at  full  replacement  cost  for  losses  of  land,  assets  and \naccess  to  assets  and  livelihoods  attributable  to  the  subproject(s).  The  screening  process  will be \ncompleted by the project implementation team and be reviewed and cleared by ADB.  \n \nThe  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  used  to  identify  eligible  households  and \n5. \nindividuals, and the cut-off date associated with it (the end of the survey), is used to discourage \nany  party  to  take  advantage  of  the  compensation  measures  as  people  moving  into  the  area  or \nstarting  to  use  resources  after  the  cut-off  date  are  not  eligible  for  compensation  and  livelihood \nrestoration.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nTimor-Leste  is  one  of  the  poorest  nations  in  the  world.  The  Government  has  a  clearly  defined  strategy  for  poverty  reduction, \nwhich  includes  improvement  of  basic  social  services  to  poor  households  and  enhancement  of  national  and  local  institutional \ncapacities.  The  Dili  Urban  Water  Supply  Sector  Project  will  result  in  leak  reduction  and  improved  pipe  networks  across  the \nwhole of Dili city, and intensive water supply improvement in six subzone subprojects. At the same time, capacity of staff of the \nNational Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation (DNSAS) to manage and sustain the water system will be enhanced, so \nthat gains made during the Project can be sustained and extended in the future. Thus the Project focus reflects two of the key \nareas of the Government\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy.  \n \nThe  combination  of  technical  improvements  and  enhancement  of  staff  capacity  will  enable  DNSAS  to  provide  Dili  with  an \neconomically more efficient water system and thus release some of the resources that DNSAS is currently forced to commit to \nthe provision of urban water services, enabling these resources to be used to improve services in rural areas, where more than \n40% of people are estimated to live in poverty. The reduction in water-related illnesses anticipated to result from an improved \nwater system in Dili should also result in savings to the national health situation, which currently supplies free medical treatment \nto Dili residents.   \n\n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nUrban  water  supply  can  be  linked  to  poverty  in  Timor-Leste  in  a  number  of  ways:  (i)  poor  infrastructure  is  a  barrier  to  local \neconomic development and hence can limit job creation in a situation where unemployment is very high and growing annually; \n(ii)  high  urban  water  costs  detract  from  the  provision  of  water  to  rural  areas,  further  limiting  development;  (iii)  excessive \nleakages  can  lead  to  stagnant  water  that  can  attract  malarial  and  dengue  mosquitoes,  thus  increasing  the  risk  of  mosquito-\nborne illnesses, the occurrence of which can impact on both household productivity and national health costs; (iv) the time taken \nto access water for domestic use can be an added burden on households, especially for women; and (v) limited access to safe \nwater can increase the risk of waterborne diseases and reduce hygiene, potentially reducing household productivity.  \n \nThe Project  will directly or  indirectly impact  on each  of these links to poverty. The entire population of Dili city  will receive  an \nimproved  water  supply  with  a  major  reduction  in  leakages.  This  should,  in  turn,  result  in  a  significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of \nmosquito-transmitted diseases. The consequences of this reduction of leakages will directly affect some 160,000 people in Dili, \nof whom in 2004 more than 14% are estimated to have been living below the national poverty line of $0.55 per day. As a result \nof the lower incidence of disease, income earners will have fewer days lost from work due to illness, a consequence of illness \nthat usually disproportionately affects poorer households.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s subprojects will result in additional improvements in the water supply in the six subproject areas. The subprojects \nare not located in the poorest water zones in Dili; in the September 2007 socioeconomic survey 27% of households interviewed \nhad a per capita income below the national poverty line ($15.44 per month). About 4,000 residents live in each of the subproject \nareas.  For  many  of  these  residents,  these  additional  improvements  in  water  supply  will  bring  benefits  in  terms  of  added \nconvenience and reduced costs. A total of 64% of those interviewed did not have a DNSAS water connection and had primary \nsources  of  water  ranging  from  private  bore  wells  with  electric  or  hand  pumps,  to  shallow  wells  with  buckets,  all  of  which  to  a \nvarying extent are subject to contamination. For the 64% of households surveyed that did not have a piped water service at their \nhome, the median time that members as a whole spent on collecting water from their primary source was 90 minutes per day. In \naddition, approximately 25% of the households interviewed, including 31% of those with a DNSAS household connection, had \nto supplement their primary source of water with a secondary source. In some cases this could take up to 2 hours per day. Apart \nfrom the opportunity costs, the direct costs incurred in obtaining water from sources other than a DNSAS connection can include \n(i) cost of drilling a shallow well ($100 or more), (ii) cost of either an electric pump (around $250 and lasting 10 years) or hand \npump ($45 and lasting 6 years), (iii) cost of repairs and maintenance to the pump and well, and (iv) cost of purchasing bottled \nwater (purchased by 42% of households) at a median cost of between $0.50 and $1.00 per day depending on the location.    \n \nThe combined effect of improved quality of water in the pipe network, increased number of DNSAS household connections, and \nelimination of the need to supplement piped water with water from potentially contaminated sources will result in reduced risks \nof both water-washed and  waterborne diseases, as well as mosquito-borne diseases, in the subproject areas. This is likely to \ndisproportionately benefit the lower per capita income households. The survey results indicate that members of households with \nper capita incomes below the national poverty line were more likely to have experienced one or more days of illnesses that they \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nattributed to water-related causes than those whose incomes were $1.00 per day or more (78% compared to 53%). In addition, \ncivil  works  required  to  improve  the  network  and  to  connect  households  to  the  system  and  install  meters  will  provide  an \nestimated 300 local residents with income-generating opportunities.  \n \nBecause of the close link between Timor-Leste\u2019s National Development Plan and its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nthe Project will directly or indirectly assist Timor-Leste meet a number of its MDGs, including the goals of (i) ensuring that 86% \nof the urban population have access to safe drinking water by 2015; (ii) reducing the percentage of people earning less than $1 \nper day from 21% in 2001 to 14% by 2015, and (iii) reducing the mortality rate among children under 5 by two thirds between \n1990 and 2015 (not only does a poor water supply directly contribute to the risk of a number of illnesses, but in situations where \nit results in recurrent bouts of diarrhoea it can lead to malnutrition in children, making them more vulnerable to other illnesses.)  \n2. Design Features.  \nThe Project does not have any features directly targeting poverty reduction. However, to maximize its potential benefits to poor \nhouseholds,  the  Project  will  collaborate  with  other  agencies  to  promote  responsible  community  water-use  behavior.  Such \nbehavior  will  contribute  to  cost  savings  and  the  prevention  of  waterborne  and  mosquito-carried  diseases.  These  factors  will \nmotivate behavioral change.  \n \nContractors  carrying  out  construction  work  will  be  required  to  employ  people  from  the  suco  (neighborhood)  in  which  they  are \nworking  for  unskilled  laboring  jobs.  This  will  include  a  disproportionately  large  number  of  people  from  the  lowest  income \nhouseholds.  \n \nThe  existing  tariff  structure  has  a  lifeline  component  to  ensure  that  households  with  per  capita  incomes  below  the  national \npoverty  line  will  be  able  to  continue  to  afford  sufficient  DNSAS  piped  water  for  consumption  and  personal  hygiene  when \nhouseholds are required to pay water tariffs. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n\nThe Project is funded by an Asian Development Fund Grant and poverty impact analysis for policy-based lending is not required.\n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nA  major  concern  for  the  Project  will  be  overcoming  the  current  community  attitudes  to  basic  social  services;  attitudes  that \nevolved in Dili during conflict and civil unrest. Dili residents have not been regularly paying for water for some years and have \nnot been invoiced since April 2006. When meters were still being read, meter tampering occurred, and now breaking pipes for \nwater or making illegal connections, especially to the connections of houses that have been destroyed by fire, is common. Theft \nof,  and  damage  to,  network  system  components  is  the  norm  and  rarely  are  direct  penalties  imposed  for  such  behavior.  This \nsituation is in part a consequence of household problems with the supply of DNSAS water and the consequent difficulties that \nresidents face in accessing water for household use. Connections to a reliable and safe supply of water will facilitate behavioral \nchange, especially if project implementation activities are carefully sequenced to ensure that no one currently obtaining  water \nillegally is ever left without a source of safe water while improvements are being made to the network. However, the Project will \nalso have a detailed strategy for promoting behavioral change concurrent with improvements being made to the local network \nsystem (Section E). This strategy will involve collaboration with other agencies such as the United Nations Development Fund \nfor  Women;  the  Alola  Foundation  (a  nongovernment  organization);  PLAN  International;  and  the  women\u2019s  organization,  the \nOrganizacao  Popular  Mulher  Timor,  which  is  linked  to  the  suco  councils.  These  linkages  will  mainstream  the  promotion  of \nresponsible  water use behavior in the ongoing activities of these agencies and in schools. Such activities  will need to involve \nsustained advocacy of appropriate behavior over an extended period. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nThe consultation process in project preparation included a household socioeconomic survey of 300 households in water supply \nzones in which the subprojects will be implemented, formal and informal meetings with suco chiefs and with women and youth \nmembers  of  the  suco  councils,  and  relevant  government  departments  and  nongovernment  organizations  working  with \ncommunities  in  Dili.  A  program  of  focus  group  meetings  on  specific  issues  of  relevance  to  involving  communities  in  the  long-\nterm sustainability of the Dili city water system was also carried out. This is discussed in detail in Supplementary Appendix H. \nDuring  this  consultation  process,  some  issues  essential  to  project  design  were  discussed,  such  as  (i)  role  of  subzone \ncaretakers;  (ii)  approaches  to  promote  responsible  water  use  behavior;  and  (iii)  strategies  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  illegal \nbehavior affecting the piped water system. Other issues such as the type of facilities (communal taps, tanks, etc.) to be provided \nfor households with no direct access to streets, did not produce a response, despite probing; specifically affected households \nwill  need  to  be  given  the  opportunity  to  comment  during  project  implementation,  once  proposals  have  been  developed.  The \nissues on which consultation has taken place and requiring community consultation in the course of project implementation are \nindicated in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n69\n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n (cid:55) Information sharing       (cid:55)  Consultation      (cid:55)  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\nThree types of community consultation and participation will be required during project implementation: \n\n(i)  A complaints system and process for regularly assessing consumer satisfaction and accurately monitoring complaints \nwill need to be established. Although critical to the success of project implementation, these processes will need to be \nestablished  as  permanent  ongoing  elements  in  DNSAS  management  of  the  water  system.  Accordingly  these \nprocesses will be developed under the community and customer relations program of the associated Dili Water Supply \nPerformance  Improvement  technical  assistance  project,  which  will  support  DNSAS  improvements  in  community  and \ncustomer relations including feedback mechanisms. \n\n(ii)  Community  consultation  will  be  required  in  relation  to  certain  aspects  of  the  project  design  as  implementation \nproceeds, such as the arrangements for bill paying and provision of water for houses without direct street access. For \nthe  most  part,  community  involvement  in  such  decisions  will  require  information  sharing  and  consultation.  These \nissues,  and  the  appropriate  consultation  and  community  participation  when  addressing  them,  are  discussed  in \nSupplementary Appendix H.  \n\n(iii)  Project  success  will  depend  on  the  commitment  of  local  communities  to  the  conservation  of  treated  water  and  the \nwater infrastructure, and the ultimate willingness of households to pay for the water they consume. Given the existing \ncontext,  achieving  this  commitment  will  require  sustained  community-based  advocacy  of  the  behavior  necessary  for \neffective functioning of the system. This will require the active collaboration of the Project with suco (small suburb) and \naldeia (neighborhood) council members and other groups in the community. To achieve this community involvement, \nthe  Project  will  also  collaborate  with  other  agencies  in  Dili  (e.g.,  United  Nations,  the  Alola  Foundation,  etc)  who  are \ndoing  community  mobilization  work  in  Dili  aldeias,  with  a  view  to  these  agencies  adopting  supportive  strategies. \nPreliminary discussions with relevant agencies and with the national women\u2019s organization (OPMT) at the aldeia level \nhave led to interest in such collaboration. Similarly  women in some  aldeia have expressed interest in  participating in \nsuch activities. Peer education opportunity, as one option, is discussed in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n\n \nOpportunity for the Project providing schools with extracurricular classroom resource material in the form of a booklet of games \nand other activities relating to the effective use of water as well as the need for conservation is also discussed in Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n \n3.  Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?    No \n  \nCommunity  consultation  and  participation  is  an  important  aspect  of  project  design  and  implementation.  The  C&P  process  for \nproject  design  is  elaborated  above  and  C&P  arrangements  during  Project  implementation  will  be  detailed  in  the  subproject \nappraisal reports and become an important component of successful subproject implementation. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nData from the  socioeconomic survey  is gender disaggregated and has been analyzed  accordingly. Information on the gender \ndivision of labor with respect to relevant household activities such as decisions about utility connections and payment of utility \nbills, collection of water, pumping, and filtering and boiling water, shows that most water-related tasks are shared by both men \nand  women.  However,  because  of  their  disproportionate  responsibilities  for  housekeeping  and  child-care,  women  are  most \naffected by the convenience of the water source available to them,   \n \nVirtually  no  difference  was  noted  in  the  willingness  of  male  and  female  respondents  to  pay  at  least  $2.00  a  month  for  piped \nwater (73% and 71% respectively) when willingness to pay was considered in terms of whether or not the respondent was the \nhousehold  member  solely  or  equally  responsible  for  managing  money  for  the  payment  for  utilities.  In  households  headed  by \nmen, a slightly lower percentage of those responsible for managing money were willing to pay (68%), compared with those not \nresponsible (77%). Women respondents who were responsible solely or partly for managing money for utilities were somewhat \nless willing to pay (65%) than were men in this position (70%). (The number of households headed by women was too small to \ndo a similar comparison for that group). Nonetheless, a clear majority of both men and women are willing to pay.  \n2.  Key  Actions.  Measures  included  in  the  design  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment\u2014access  to  and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making processes: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n   Other actions/measures      (cid:55)  No action/measure \n\n \nNo gender action plan will be required for the Project.  \n \nHowever  because  of  the  significance  of  their  role  as  water  users,  women  should  be  primarily  responsible  for  any  program \ndesigned  to  promote  good  water  use  behavior;  particular  attention  should  be  paid  to  women\u2019s  groups  in  the  community \nfacilitating  such  promotion.  Women  will  be  the  primary  target  for  any  such  community-based  promotion  activities.  Among \nhouseholds  using  public  facilities,  girls  will  also  be  a  target  group  for  such  promotion,  as  they  are  observed  to  often  be \nresponsible for clothes washing, etc. at the public water facilities.     \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \n\nLabor \n(cid:55) Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n(cid:55) Core labor standards \n\n \nAffordability \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \n\n(cid:55)Others (conflict, political \ninstability, etc.), please \nspecify \n\nIII.

With none present, no \nindigenous peoples will be impacted \nby the Project. \n\nImplementation will be undertaken \nby contract and employment \nopportunities for local laborers will \nbe significant.  \n\nSupplementary Appendix K \ndiscusses water tariffs, affordability, \nand willingness to pay. Early \nindications are that water tariffs are \naffordable and that consumers are \nwilling to pay for water provided the \nservice is adequate. The incidence \nof households in Dili that perceive \nthemselves as headed by women \nheaded is low. The small number \nidentified in the socioeconomic \nsurvey (7%) had a similar per capita \neconomic status as households \nheaded by men and showed little \ndifference in their willingness to pay. \n\nMany households have a \ncomponent of unstable or temporary \ncontract income in their per capita \nhousehold income. These \nhouseholds can be considered \nvulnerable. This issue is addressed \nin relation to affordability. \n \nPeace and order remains a problem \nin many parts of Dili.  \n \nAlthough construction work will be \ncarried out in the sucos, this will be \ndone mainly with local aldeia labor \nand thus not require any \nconstruction camps. No migrant \nlabor will be employed and the \nProject will not increase the risk of \nHIV/AIDS. \n\nAre  social  indicators  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  to  facilitate  monitoring  of  social  development  activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?   Yes  \n\n \n\nIV.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n71\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\n \n1. \nThis  summary  initial  environmental  examination  outlines  the  findings  of  the  initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) of the three core subprojects of the Dili Urban Water Supply \nSector  Project.  The  IEEs  are  presented  as  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  The  IEEs  of  core \nsubprojects are closely linked to the requirements and procedures of the Government\u2019s draft law \non environmental impact assessment. Government responsibility for urban environmental issues \nlies  with  the  secretary  of  state  for  environment  (SSE)  within  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nDevelopment.  The  environmental  assessment  process  followed  the  draft  law  and  is  in \naccordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  Under  the  ADB  assessment  guidelines,  the \nProject is categorized as an environment category B. IEEs were prepared for core subprojects in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  and  comply  with  ADB \nEnvironment Policy.   \n \nA. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nStarting  with  three  zones  within  the  Dili  water  supply  service  area,  the  Project  will \n2. \ndemonstrate a zonal approach to progressively upgrading an entire city\u2019s water supply secondary \nand  tertiary  distribution  (reticulation)  operation  to  sustainably  decrease  water  losses,  manage \nwater demand, boost customer satisfaction, and improve water supply business performance. Dili \ncity  is  divided  into  10  geographic  water  supply  zones.  Subprojects  were  selected  in  subzones \nwithin each of the three target water supply zones in the Dili water supply service area. Subzone \nboundaries were determined by the technical location of the existing water supply pipe network, \nas  well  as  the  location  of  control  valves.  Each  subzone  includes  approximately  1,000  water \nservices. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nTimor-Leste occupies the eastern half of the island of Timor, the most easterly island of \n3. \nthe Lesser Sunda Group. It is approximately 300 kilometers (km) long and 50 km wide with a total \nland area of 15,000 square kilometers. It is mountainous with peaks up to 2,920 meters (m) and \nis  bordered  by  coral  reefs.  The  urban  area  of  Dili  is  located  on  a  flat  strip  of  land  between  the \ncoast line and the foot of the mountains. The Project and subprojects are all located entirely on \nthis coastal strip of flat land. The climate is monsoonal with distinct rainy and dry periods. Rainfall \nis  relatively  high  (over  1,750  millimeters)  on  65%  of  the  island;  much  of  this  rain  falls  in  heavy \nstorms  during  the  months  from  December  to  March.  Average  temperature  at  sea  level  is  27oC \nand sea level relative humidity is around 80%. Timor-Leste has a combination of Australian and \nAsian  flora  and  fauna,  with  about  224  species  of  birds,  23  of  which  are  endemic  to  the  Timor \nisland  group.  Timor-Leste  also  has  rich  marine  life.  Threatened  or  endangered  species  include \nseveral turtle species and estuarine crocodiles.  \n \n4. \nTimor-Leste  is  one  of  the  least  developed  countries  in  the  world.  Per  capita  gross \ndomestic  product  (non-oil)  was  estimated  at  $370  in  2006,  and  has  fallen  in  most  years  since \n2001. Around 40% of the total population is reported to live under the official income poverty line \nof $0.55 per capita per day. Each year, about 14,000 young people enter the labor force. Youth \nunemployment  increased  nationally  from  15%  in  2001  to  23%  in  2004;  and  underemployment \nmay be three times as high. Timor-Leste\u2019s human development index remains the lowest among \nSoutheast Asian countries and Timor-Leste ranks 140th (value of 0.426 in 2004) of 177 countries \nranked  worldwide.  The  Project  is  wholly  within  the  urban  area  of  Dili  city  and  provides  water \nservices  to  industrial,  commercial,  and  residential  premises.  Dili  had  a  2006  population  of \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n160,000. Each subproject includes approximately 1,000 water connections and has a population \nof about 4,000 permanent residents.  \n \nC. \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nEach  subproject  will  systematically  repair,  refurbish,  or  replace  tertiary  distribution  pipe \n5. \nnetworks;  and  replace  or  install  water  meters  in  an  effort  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  both \nnonrevenue water and unaccounted-for-water. All work will be undertaken on the same alignment \nof  existing  water  pipes  and  services.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the \nwork in the subproject will occur during implementation, and will typically involve excavation and \nexposure of existing water pipes accompanied by local stockpiling of excavated material prior to \nbackfilling the excavation. Expected negative environmental impacts will be limited to (i) possible \nnoise  and  dust  pollution  while  work  is  in  progress;  (ii)  possible  broken  water  pipes;  and  (iii) \npresence  of  open  excavations  while  work  is  in  progress.  Positive  environmental  impacts  will \ninclude the repair of leaks in water pipes resulting in an expected substantial reduction of pooling \nwater within the urban area. Since the natural terrestrial environment of the subproject area has \nalready been significantly altered and disturbed by urban development with roads, drains, homes, \nand  industrial  and  commercial  buildings,  the  subproject  will  not  cause  any  significant  impact  to \nthe  existing  environment,  nor  will  it  affect  any  environmentally  significant  area.  Implementation \nwork of the subproject will not affect any streams or watercourses within the Dili urban area. No \nmajor  sites  of  archaeological,  cultural,  or  historic  significance  will  be  affected  by  subproject \nimplementation.  All  excavations  will  be  undertaken  in  ground  that  has been  subject  to  previous \nrecent  excavation.  All  asbestos  cement  pipes  to  be  disconnected  by  the  Project  will  be  left  in-\nground  and  covered.  As  all  subproject  activities  will  be  undertaken  on  the  footprint  of  existing \nwater  supply  infrastructure,  no  land  acquisition  or  land  for  resettlement  will  be  required.  The \nenvironmental  impacts  identified  for  preimplementation,  implementation,  and  operations  phases \nfor  the  subproject  are  detailed  in  this  appendix.  They  are  also  shown  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring  plan  (EMMP)  matrix  set  out  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  The \nEMMP addresses the impacts and mitigation measures identified, and outlines the requirements \nof various people or agencies that need to be addressed during the phases of the subproject. \n \nD. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  draft  law  on  environmental  impact  assessment  has  yet  to  be \n6. \npromulgated by the Council of Ministers. While the requirements of the draft law are clear, they \nare  not  well  enforced.  These  provide  for  the  preparation  of  an  IEE,  and  all  urban  development \nprojects will require SSE approval. SSE may require a full environmental impact assessment for \nsubprojects  with  significant  negative  environmental  impacts.  The  National  Directorate  for  Water \nSupply and Sanitation (DNSAS) will need to submit an application for approval to SSE for each \nsubproject.  A  subproject  appraisal  report  (SPAR)  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject  and  will \ninclude  an  IEE  prepared  following  ADB  requirements.  Approval  applications  for  subprojects  will \nbe supported by a SPAR. \n \n7. \nAn environmental and social unit (ESU) will be established within the Administration and \nHuman Resources Division of DNSAS. The ESU will comprise two staff who will be responsible \nfor  environmental  management;  and  public  and  customer  relations.  DNSAS  will  be  responsible \nfor  the  preparation  of  subproject  IEEs  including  an  EMMP.  The  IEE  will  be  reviewed  and \napproved  by  SSE  and  ADB.  SSE  will  determine  if  an  environmental  impact  assessment  is \nrequired according to the requirements of the draft law (although subproject screening criteria will \nexclude subprojects that may have significant negative environmental impact, according to ADB \ncriteria).  Prior  to  the  commencement  of  implementation  activities,  and  once  detailed  design \ninformation is available, the EMMP developed for the subproject will be refined by the ESU. The \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n73\n\nESU  will  assist  other  sections  DNSAS  in  supervising  EMMP  implementation  through  regular \nobservation and spot-checks of implementation activities. The ESU will help DNSAS ensure that \nEMMPs are adequately prepared and will ensure that adequate and timely remedial actions are \ntaken when issues arise during implementation. \n \n8. \nDuring  all  phases  of  subproject  implementation,  management  of  the  EMMP  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  DNSAS  with  overall  site  monitoring  of  the  subproject  the  responsibility  of  the \nESU.  Monitoring  will  include  regular  community  meetings  to  monitor  community  concerns,  thus \nidentifying  and  mitigating  these  concerns  as  early  as  possible  in  the  process  to  ensure \ncommunity  actions  do  not  prevent  access  or  incur  damage  to  the  subproject  site.  DNSAS  will \nprepare  quarterly  mitigation  progress  and  monitoring  reports.  At  the  end  of  subproject \nimplementation,  the  ESU  will  prepare  a  summary  report  and  verification  that  mitigation  actions \nwere completed and forwarded it to SSE with a copy to ADB.  \n \nE.  \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n9. \nDNSAS  will  provide  public  notification  of  the  subproject  in  a  widely  circulated  local \nnewspaper  in  both  Tetum  and  Portuguese  languages.  Notifications  will  invite  submissions  from \nmembers  of  the  public,  or  organizations  within  the  community  within  2  weeks  following  public \nnotification. Notification will advise that further information may be obtained at the office of SSE \nor  DNSAS.  Public  consultation  and  information  disclosure  requirements  are  detailed  in  the  IEE \n(Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nThe  Project  through  the  implementation  of  subprojects  will  improve  technical  and \n10. \ncommercial water losses in three of the city\u2019s water supply zones. Lessons can then be applied to \nsimilar  programs  in  adjacent  zones  and  progressively  replicated  until  all  10  of  the  city\u2019s  water \nsupply  zones  are  covered  and  overall  service  delivery  is  improved.  The  Project,  through  the \nimplementation of subprojects, will assist the Government to achieve its Millennium Development \nGoal  and  National  Development  Plan  targets  for  urban  water  supply.  The  Project  will  have  few \nnegative  impacts  and  all  can  be  satisfactorily  managed.  The  EMMP  establishes  compliance \nconditions. DNSAS will ensure that mitigation measures are included in subproject design while \nduring  implementation  the  ESU  will  have  monitoring  responsibilities.  The  Project  will  include \nstrengthening of DNSAS by establishing and supporting the ESU.   \n \nG. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Review Procedure \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Selection Criteria for Subprojects \n\n11. \nIn selecting subprojects, the following criteria will be used for the first level of screening. If \nany of these criteria are found applicable to the particular subproject and/or other conditions that \nmay lead to a full environmental impact assessment, the subproject will not be accepted as part \nof the sector Project: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsubprojects located in nature reserves; \nany significant loss of primary forest, mangroves, or sensitive wetland; \nany permanent negative effect on known rare or endangered species; \nand significant impacts on air quality and water quality; and \nany permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n\n \n\n \n12. \nThe  IEE  process  to  be  applied  will  confirm  this  or  recommend  necessary  work.  All \nsubprojects  will  be  subject  to  an  IEE  to  be  prepared  by  the  ESU.  The  IEE  of  subprojects  will \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\ninitially  be  prepared  under  the  supervision  and  guidance  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultants. \n \n\n2. \n\nReview  Procedure  for  Environmental  Assessment  of  Subprojects  and \nResponsibilities of DNSAS and ADB \n\n13. \nTo  ensure  that  all  subprojects  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  and  the  Government\u2019s  draft  law,  DNSAS  and  ADB  will  divide \nresponsibilities.  \n \n\na. \n\nDNSAS Responsibilities \n\n14. \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nDNSAS through the ESU will be responsible for the following: \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nprepare an IEE for each subproject for approval by the SSE; \nundertake adequate consultation with affected people and public disclosure; \nundertake  the  necessary  actions  to  ensure  environmental  compliance  with  the \nrequirements of the Government and ADB; \nobtain the necessary IEE clearance (development consent approval) from SSE; \nsubmit to ADB, IEEs and their summaries, incorporating EMMPs; \nsubmit  to  ADB  the  development  consent  approval  from  the  SSE,  and  its \nconditions, for ADB consideration in approving the subprojects; \nensure  that  the  EMMP  required  mitigation  measures  to  be  incorporated  during \npreconstruction activities are addressed by the design section within DNSAS; \nensure that the EMMP implementation stage mitigation measures are included in \nregulatory  clearances  (particularly  the  development  consent  approvals)  will  be \nobtained before commencing any civil work for the subproject; \nensure that the completed EMMP is submitted to SSE for approval; \nensure  that  all  DNSAS  sections  understand  their  responsibilities  to  mitigate \nenvironmental problems associated with implementation activities; \n\n(ix) \n(x) \n\n(viii) \n\n(vii) \n\n(xi)  monitor the EMMP and ensure it is properly implemented; and \n(xii) \n\nsubmit quarterly progress reports of on the implementation of EMMPs to the SSE \nand ADB. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nADB Responsibilities \n\n15. \n\nADB will be responsible for the following: \n(i) \n\nreview  IEE  and  summary  initial  environmental  examination  reports  and  disclose \nthe reports through the ADB website; \nreview  all  statutory  environmental  clearance  granted  by  the  SSE,  particularly  the \ndevelopment  consent  approval,  and  note  all  conditions \nthe \nsubprojects; \nreview the quarterly report of EMMP implementation and take necessary actions in \nclose consultation with DNSAS; and \nundertake  monitoring  of  EMMP  implementation  and  due  diligence  as  part  of  the \noverall project review mission. \n\nin  approving \n\nEnvironmental  Due  Diligence \nEnvironment Policy \n\nto  Ensure  Compliance  with \n\nthe  ADB \n\n16. \nDNSAS  should  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  undertake  environmental  due \ndiligence  for  all  subprojects,  if  necessary.  However,  DNSAS  has  primary  responsibility  for \nundertaking  environmental  due  diligence  for  monitoring  implementation  of  environmental \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n75\n\nmitigation for subprojects. The due diligence report and monitoring report of the implementation \nof the EMMP need to be systematically documented. \n \n\n4. \n\nPublic Disclosure \n\nFor  any  subproject  subject  to  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  and \n17. \nwhere an IEE is required, formal and documented public consultation and information disclosure \nwill  be  required.  This  will  be  done  once  during  IEE  preparation,  i.e.,  to  inform  stakeholders  of \nproject  components  and  to  encourage  input  to  identify  overlooked  environmental  issues.  The \ninformation  disclosed  and  feedback  provided  at  the  consultation  sessions  will  be  summarized, \nattendance  recorded,  and  the  document  attached  as  an  annex  to  the  IEE.  Invited  attendees  at \nIEE  consultations  will \nlocal  authorities,  community \nrepresentatives, as well as nongovernment organizations. At least 2 weeks notice of consultative \nmeetings  will  be  given.  DNSAS  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  documentation  including  the \nenvironmental due diligence and monitoring reports are properly and systematically kept as part \nof  the  DNSAS  project  record.  Environmental  documents  such  as  IEEs  are  subject  to  public \ndisclosure and therefore should be made available to the public on request. \n \nH. \n\ninclude  Government  agencies  and \n\nConclusions \n\n18. \nThe Project is classified as category B. All impacts can be satisfactorily mitigated and an \nEMMP  was  prepared  that  contains  practical  and  realizable  mitigation  measures.  The  IEE \nconcludes  that  the  subproject  will  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  environment.  The  IEE \nconcludes that adverse environmental impacts arising from the location, design, implementation, \nand operation and maintenance of the proposed water supply and delivery infrastructure can be \nminimized  to  insignificant  levels.  Therefore  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not \nconsidered  to  be  warranted.  An  EMMP  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I  and  will  be \nstrictly adhered to. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \nThe unit of currency in Timor-Leste is in US dollar. \n", "ADB \nAusAID \nADB \nBME \nCOM \nDNSAS \nEARP \nEIRR \nEMMP \nESU \nFIRR \nIBNet \nIEE \nJICA \nLARF \nm3 \nMDG \nMOF \nMOI \nNDP \nNGO \nNRW \nO&M \nSPAR \nSSE \nWACC \nWSS \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "benefit monitoring and evaluation \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Australian Agency for International Development \n\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Council of Ministers \n\u2013  National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure \n\u2013 \neconomic internal rate of return \n\u2013 \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan \n\u2013 \nenvironmental and social unit \n\u2013 \nfinancial internal rate of return \n\u2013 \nInternational Benchmarking Network (water supply utilities) \n-- \ninitial environmental examination \n\u2013 \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \n\u2013 \nland acquisition and resettlement framework \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \ncubic meter \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n--  Ministry of Infrastructure \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  weighted average cost of capital \n\u2013  water supply and sanitation \n", "national development plan \nnongovernment organization \nnonrevenue water \noperation and maintenance \nseveral subproject appraisal report \nsecretary of state for environment \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n \nVice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n", "NOTES \nThe fiscal year (FY) of the Government starts 1 January and ends 31 December. \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "C.
