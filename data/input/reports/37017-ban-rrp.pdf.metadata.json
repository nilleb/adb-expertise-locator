The  Good  Governance  Program  is  in \nline with the Government\u2019s priorities on good governance, and contributes \ndirectly  to  desired  outcomes  in  this  sector.  Governance  reform  is \nmultidimensional, but currently in Bangladesh the core of such reforms is \nanticorruption,  an  area  that  this  Program  directly  and  substantially \naddresses. There is no program at the moment in the country targeting the \nprimary  symptom  of  poor  governance  (i.e.,  corruption)  with  a  broad  and \ncomprehensive approach; this Program fills that void. \n\nThe objectives of the Program are to (i) strengthen the ongoing consensus \nbuilding  on  good  governance,  integrity,  and  anticorruption  reforms;  (ii) \nsupport  judicial  reforms  with  a  focus  on  the  performance,  transparency, \nthe \nand  accountability  of \nanticorruption  agenda;  (iii)  strengthen \nthe \nAnticorruption  Commission  so  that  it  can  better  fight  corruption;  and  (iv) \nbring  good  governance  and  anticorruption  initiatives  into  the  mainstream \nwithin selected sectoral level agencies to enhance their effectiveness. \n\nin \nthe  role  and  reach  of \n\njudiciary,  particularly  on \n\nits  role \n\nthe \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy reform program by providing a program loan of SDR \n97,910,000 ($150 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh.  The  loan  will \nhave  a  fixed  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The \ninterest charge will be at a rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be \nutilized over a period of 48 months from the date of effectiveness. \n\n\fii\n\nEstimated\nProgram\nCompletion Date \n\nProgram Period \nand Tranching \n\nExecuting and \nImplementing\nAgencies\n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\nCounterpart\nFunds\n\n48 months from the date of loan effectiveness \n\ntranche \n\nthe  corresponding \n\ntranches  upon  meeting \n\nThe  Program  will  be  for  4  years.  The  program  loan  will  be  released  in \nthree \nrelease \nconditions. The first tranche (not exceeding $50 million) is to be disbursed \nupon  loan  effectiveness,  subject  to  Government  fulfillment  of  all  prior \nactions  required  under  the  Program.  The  second  tranche  (not  exceeding \n$55 million) will be disbursed 12 months after program loan effectiveness \nupon  satisfactory \ntranche  release \nconditions (or earlier than 12 months if the conditions have been met). The \nthird  tranche  ($45  million)  will  be  disbursed  24  months  after  the  second \ntranche,  subject  to  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding  tranche \nrelease conditions (or earlier than 24 months if the conditions have been \nmet).  The  program  period  will  be \nloan \neffectiveness) to September 2011 (or 48 months after loan effectiveness). \n\nfrom  October  2007  (or \n\nthe  corresponding \n\nfulfillment  of \n\nThere  are  two  executing  agencies  (EAs)  for  the  Program:  the  Supreme \nCourt will be the EA for the program focus on strengthening the judiciary \nwhile the Cabinet Division will be the EA for all other activities. Given the \nseparation of the judiciary from the executive branch of government, and \ngiven  that  several  policy  reforms  are  within  the  judiciary,  it  is  deemed \nnecessary  to  establish  two  EAs  so  that  responsibilities  for  attaining \noutcomes  respective  to  the  two  branches  of  government  are  kept \nseparate.  Implementing  agencies  include  the  Anticorruption  Commission; \nMinistry  of  Law,  Justice,  and  Parliamentary  Affairs  (MLJPA);  Ministry  of \nShipping; Ministry of Establishment; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and other \nsectoral agencies. \n\nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange costs of items produced and procured in ADB member countries \nother  than  items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  7)  and \nimports  financed  from  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The \nGovernment  will  certify  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the \namount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected  disbursement  under  the  loan  for  the  given \nperiod. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to \nverify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n\nCounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will \nbe  used  to  finance  the  adjustment  costs  associated  with  the  Program, \nincluding: (i) implementation at all levels of the National Integrity Strategy \n(NIS) and the UN Convention Against Corruption; (ii) operation of ACC at \nthe central, regional, and district levels; (iii) separation of the judiciary from \nfor  capital \nthe  executive  branch  of  government, \nexpenditures  flowing  from  such  separation;  (iv)  implementation  of  the \napproved  recommendations  of  the  Judicial  Service  Pay  Commission;  (v) \nestablishment  and  operation  of  independent  prosecution  services;  (vi) \nreforms  at  Chittagong  Port  Authority;  (vii)  implementation  of  grievance \nhandling  mechanisms,  including  citizen  report  cards  and  Office  of  the \nOmbudsman; (viii) operation of the Judicial Service Commission; (ix) any \n\nincluding  costs \n\n\fBenefits and \nBeneficiaries\n\nRisks and \nMitigating\nMeasures\n\niii\n\nperformance  incentive  schemes  and  human  resource  plans  developed \nunder  the  Program;  and  (x)  independent  surveys  on  Program-related \ninterventions.\n\nThe  program  loan  will  result  in  long-lasting  policy  reforms  in  good \ngovernance,  particularly  those  related  to  instituting  good  practices  in \ncombating  corruption,  specifically  at  the  sectoral  agency  level.  The  loan \nwill  also  help  the  Government  to  formulate  and  implement  a  country-\ninclude \nspecific  anticorruption  vision  and  strategy.  Beneficiaries \nbusinesses,  public  servants  in  the  Bangladesh  civil  service  and  the \njudiciary services, service recipients, and citizens. \n\nThe  assumptions  inherent  in  the  Program  are  that  (i)  the  Government \ncommitment  to  reforms  across  the  various  sectors  (including  for  the \nAnticorruption  Commission)  will  continue  to  remain  high,  (ii)  the  political \nsystem  is  stable  during  the  program  implementation  period,  (iii)  the \nseparation of the judiciary from the executive branch of government will be \nformally completed in the very near future, and (iv) development partners \n(singly and jointly) remain engaged in the Program. \n\nThe  Program\u2019s  success  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  continuing  strong \ncommitment  to  governance  reforms  in  general  and,  more  specifically,  to \nsuccessfully  countering  endemic  and  widespread  corruption.  There  is  a \nrisk that current reforms may be reversed by future governments. This risk \nmay  be  mitigated  by  continued  policy  dialogue,  not  only  with  the \nGovernment  but  also  with  other  stakeholders  (such  as  the  judiciary,  civil \nsociety,  and  even  development  partners).  The  Program  also  targets \nreforms that are in the public interest, and so attempts at reversal by future \nto \ngovernments  will  be  more  difficult.  The  Government \nfundamentally  reform  the  electoral  process  \u2013  a  major  source  of  abuse  of \nauthority;  if  successful,  this  will  mitigate  risks  of  reform  reversal  and  will \nalso  mean  that  the  Program  outcomes  and  impact  will  be  easier  to \nachieve.\n\nis  keen \n\nThe Program may also place some demands on the institutional capacities \nof  the  Government  agencies  involved  in  executing  and  implementing  the \nProgram. Close performance monitoring and targeted technical assistance \nto the two EAs and all implementing agencies will help reduce the adverse \neffects  of  implementation  delays  due  to  capacity  constraints.  Enabling \nconditions for the Program that are in evidence at the moment may not still \nexist when an elected government takes over as expected in early 2009. \nThis  risk  can  be  mitigated  by  ensuring  that  the  leadership  in  the  various \nagencies  that  are  part  of  the  Program  is  suitably  engaged  in  Program \ndesign  to  ensure  continued  involvement.  The  extensive  process  of \nconsultation  within  the  bureaucracy  to  get  commitment  to  the  NIS  is \ndesigned to directly address this risk. \n\nTechnical\nAssistance\n\nIn conjunction with the Good Governance Program, technical assistance is \nproposed  for  providing  support  to  the  Government  to  enhance  the \ncapability  of  relevant  agencies  to  implement  the  policy  reforms,  and  to \nmore effectively manage the Program. The estimated cost of the technical \n\n\fiv\n\nassistance  (TA)  program  is  $3.00  million,  of  which  ADB  will  finance  $1.5 \nmillion  as  a  grant  from  its  TA  funding  program;  the  Government  of \nDenmark  $1.0  million  from  its  Human  Rights  and  Good  Governance \nProgram,  Phase  II;  and  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  $0.5  million  in \ncash  and  kind.  TA  program  consultants  will  be  recruited  according  to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time).\n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Good  Governance  Program,  and  (ii) \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for supporting the Good Governance Program. If the Board \napproves ADB providing the technical assistance, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby  the  Board,  will  approve  ADB  administering  the  balance  of  the  technical  assistance  not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1  million  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Danish \nInternational Development Assistance (DANIDA). The Program framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1\n\nSince  1991,  the  country\u2019s  economy  has  improved  when  measured  against  most \n2. \nmacroeconomic  indicators;  growth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  averaged  4.8%  in  the \n1990s, and by 2004 it had reached 6.3%. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) own estimate \nis that GDP will grow by 6.5% in FY2007. While it has the potential to grow faster, even at the \ncurrent rate Bangladesh is expected to become a middle-income country by 2023. Poverty has \nbeen declining at a rate of 1% per annum since 2001, but approximately 42% of the population \nstill live in poverty, and 29% are at the extreme poverty level.2\n\nThere is currently in place a broadly pro-market policy which is the outcome of a series \n3. \nof wide-ranging economic reforms initiated in the early 1990s. Those reforms concentrated on \neconomic liberalization and deregulation, along with the promotion of private enterprise. While \nsome of the reforms became well established, not all were implemented effectively, particularly \nin privatization and in the financial sector. This has been largely due to lack of political will from \nsuccessive governments to oppose powerful political, bureaucratic, and trade union groups. \n\nThe  country  faces  several  macroeconomic  challenges  that  impact  upon  governance \n\n4. \nreforms:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nDespite  prudent  fiscal  management,  revenue  collection  remains  disappointing. \nThe  ambitious  revenue  target  growth  set  by  the  National  Board  of  Revenue  of \n19.2%  in  FY2007  is  unlikely  to  be  achieved.  Revenue  is  also  expected  to \ndecrease by 0.2% of GDP in FY2007. \nBecause the first-generation market liberalization reforms were rushed through in \nthe  1990s,  implementation  of  institutional  and  administrative  arrangements \n(second-generation reforms, such as financial regulation) has been much slower. \nThis has been largely attributed to \u201cpolitical interference and a lack of political will \nto enforce regulations\u201d.3\nThe  budgetary  formulation  process  is  highly  centralized  within  the  bureaucracy, \nand  parliamentary  working  committees,  for  example,  have  no  opportunity  to \ncomment on the budget until it is presented in full to Parliament. In addition, the \ncentralized  nature  of  the  process  means  that  sectoral  allocations  tend  to  be \nstrictly incremental. \nThere  are  also  capacity  and  accountability  issues  in  line  ministries  as  far  as \npublic  expenditure  management  is  concerned.  This  is  demonstrated  by  the  fact \n\n                                                \n1  This analysis is drawn largely from Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee. 2006. The State of Governance in \n\nBangladesh. Dhaka: Centre for Governance Studies. \n\n2  In response to this, in June 2007 the Government announced that 57% of the proposed annual aggregate budget \n(non-development and development combined)  will be spent on programs directly or indirectly relating to poverty \nreduction, and about 11% of the total budget will be for social empowerment and safety-net programs. \n\n3  Chowdhury, A. 2002. Politics, Society, and Financial Sector Reforms in Bangladesh. International Journal of Social \n\nEconomics, 29(12), pp. 963\u2013988. \n\n\f2\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nthe  organizational \n\nthat  public  projects  funded  under  the  annual  development  programs  have  very \nlow completion rates.4\nPublic  financial  management  vulnerabilities  are  also  mirrored  in  the  fiduciary \nrisks  evident  at \nfinancial \nmanagement in key sectoral agencies are high operational risk areas.5\nPolitical disruptions (at least until late 2006) that affect the economy have led to a \ndecline in medium-term strong economic growth prospects. It is estimated that 3\u2013\n4% of GDP per year is lost as a result of hartals (strikes); more worrying is the \nfact that this has adversely affected Bangladesh\u2019s image as a place in which to \ndo business.6\n\nInternal  controls  and \n\nlevel. \n\n5. \nTo address these and other problems, some far-reaching reforms in the economic and \nfinancial  sectors  have  recently  been  attempted.  The  Government  has  now  introduced  the \nmedium-term budgetary framework (MTBF) in 14 ministries,7 and it has expressed commitment \nto implementation of budgetary reforms, fiscal reporting, and related monitoring and evaluation \nmechanisms. The Government in FY2005 issued new annual budget guidelines on a pilot basis, \nwhich  contained  elements  of  more  strategic  budgeting  practices,  better  fiscal  discipline,  and \nbetter  coordination  of  recurrent  and  capital  budgets. 8  In  May  2007,  the  Government  also \nannounced that any block-allocation in the budget for a government agency, if needed, must be \nfor specific projects to ensure discipline and transparency in public expenditure. In June 2007, in \nannouncing the annual budget, the Government hinted at broad tax reforms, including curtailing \ndiscretionary powers of the tax authorities and building a simplified and transparent tax regime. \n\n6. \nThe  Government  has  also  implemented  a  procurement  law  which  details  how  public \nprocurement should take place with a view to being transparent, efficient, and conscious of the \nprinciples  of  value  for  money.  It  is  beginning  to  institutionalize  procurement  management \ncapacity,  including  the  strengthening  of  procurement  policy  units  in  key  ministries.  Finally,  the \nGovernment  has  recently  announced  its  decision  to  privatize  17  state-owned  enterprises,  and \nBiman Bangladesh Airlines has already been corporatized. Plans are also underway to privatize \nthree nationalized commercial banks (Janata Bank, Sonali Bank, and Agrani Bank).  \n\n                                                \n4  Line  ministries  are  rarely  able  to  spend  the  funds  allocated  them  (i.e.,  they  have  poor  absorption  capacity);  in \naddition, the quality of those projects that actually do get implemented tends to be poor and subject to corruption \n(D. Bhattacharya. 2005. Bangladesh Economy: Macroeconomic Performance, Dhaka: Centre for Policy Dialogue). \nA 2002 report by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning found that the \naverage completion rate over a 4-year period was only 56%; a further 15% of projects made no progress at all. \n5  See,  for  example,  World  Bank.  2006.  Operational  Risk  Assessment.  Washington,  DC  (conducted  for  the  Roads \n\nand Highways Department, Bangladesh). \n\n6  The  state  of  governance  and  its  impact  on  the  investment  climate  is  a  critical  variable  to  consider  in \nmacroeconomic governance. While private sector investment in Bangladesh has increased steadily over the years \n(from  an  average  of  11%  of  GDP  in  1991\u20131995  to  17%  in  2001\u20132004),  recent  studies  have  pointed  out  that  the \ncountry\u2019s global competitiveness and economic growth rate would benefit greatly from governance improvements \nin  the  public  sector  (see,  e.g.,  D.  Roy.  2006.  Governance,  Competitiveness,  and  Growth:  The  Challenges  for \nBangladesh. Asian Development Bank Institute Discussion Paper 53. Tokyo). \n\n7   Each of these MTBF agencies is also expected to pay significant attention to internal audit and control mechanisms \n\nso as to ensure proper and effective resource use. \n\n8   As  per  the  provisions  of  the  MTBF,  selected  ministries  are  required  to  consider  an  overall  3-year  ceiling  and  set \npriorities  between  revenue  and  development  budget  spending  even  though  their  authority  to  redeploy  resources \ntoward highest social returns remains limited.  \n\n\f3\n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR9\n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nPolitical Governance \n\n7. \nParliamentary democracy was reinstated in Bangladesh in 1991 following the ouster of \nthe  autocratic  military  government  by  a  mass  movement.  A  parliamentary  form  of  government \nwas established and all powers previously vested in the president were transferred to the prime \nminister;  the  president  is  the  head  of  state,  and  the  prime  minister  is  the  head  of  the \nGovernment. Legislative powers are vested in the Parliament.10\n\nThree  successive  parliamentary  elections  have  been  held  since  1991.  These  elections \n8. \nensured  the  emergence  of  parliamentary  democracy  and  provided  for  a  process  of  peaceful \ntransfer of power, as witnessed by the formation of government by the two major political parties \n(Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Bangladesh Awami League) in 1991, 1996, and 2001. \nFor the 2006 national elections, there were problems in matters such as errors in the voters\u2019 list \nprepared earlier and implementation provisions in Article 58 of the Constitution in toto regarding \nformation  of  the  caretaker  government.  This  sparked  mass  protests  by  the  opposition  parties. \nThe country came to a standstill, resulting in the imposition of a state of emergency under the \nConstitution and the establishment of a caretaker government in early 2007. \n\n9. \nA large part of the problem in political governance in Bangladesh has to do with the low \nlevel of internal accountability and transparency. As a result, the government apparatus is often \npoliticized,  which  leads  to  inadequate  appreciation  of  different  point  of  views.  In  absence  of \nadequate checks and balances, decisions are often taken without adequate consensus.  \n\n2. \n\nGovernance in the Judiciary \n\n10. \nThe  Constitution  of  Bangladesh  envisions  an  independent  judiciary  having  the  final \nauthority to declare any laws or governmental actions void if they are not found consistent with \nthe Constitution. As per Article 94 of the Constitution, the judiciary in Bangladesh is divided into \ntwo  categories:  (i)  the  Supreme  Court,  and  (ii)  the  subordinate  courts.  The  Supreme  Court  is \ncomprised  of  the  Appellate  Division  and  the  High  Court  Division,  and  is  headed  by  the  chief \njustice.  There  is  a  Supreme  Judicial  Council  to  enquire  into  the  capacity  or  conduct  of  the \njudges  of  the  Supreme  Court.  The  Supreme  Court  has  the  jurisdiction  to  hear  public-interest \nlitigation and other writ petitions, and issues necessary orders to ensure justice to the victims of \ncivil  rights  violations.  The  Supreme  Court  is  empowered  to  review  legislative  enactments  and \nExecutive  actions  with  a  view  to  ensuring  their  compatibility  with  the  spirit  of  the  Constitution. \nWhile the Supreme Court cannot review the actions of the prime minister or president on its own, \nbased on any writ petition by any aggrieved party, the decision of the prime minister or president \ncan be reviewed and revoked by the Court. \n\n                                                \n9  The  term  sector  here  is  taken  to  mean  governance,  which  encompasses,  among  other  things,  public  sector \nmanagement, anticorruption, separation of powers among the three branches of government, and decentralization. \nIt  is  less  focused  on  corporate  governance  or  market  dynamics  (such  as  competition  and  regulation),  and  it  also \nexcludes  other  governance  components  such  as  the  election  system,  human  rights,  police  reforms,  or  political \nparty reforms. Appendix 2 contains a more detailed sector analysis. \n\n10 The  Parliament  has  48  committees  but  during  the  last  administration  these  were  not  formed  in  time  which \ninterfered with their oversight functions. For example, in the last seven parliaments, the Public Accounts Committee \nhas  been  formed  only  five  times,  resulting  in  a  backlog  of  audit  reports  to  be  reviewed  and  debated.  Further, \nministries frequently do not respond to the Public Accounts Committee\u2019s recommendations and directives.\n\n\f4\n\nAlthough  the  formal  structure  of  the  judicial  system  is  in  place  in  Bangladesh,  judicial \n11. \nindependence and performance is of concern. At any given time, approximately 800,000 cases \nare pending at different levels of the judicial system, including 400,000 civil cases and 200,000 \ncriminal  cases  filed  with  the  district  and  magistrate  courts,  and  around  40,000  cases  before \nspecialized  courts.  Although  a  separate  Judicial  Service  Commission  (JSC)  has  been \nestablished,  the  Government  is  yet  to  fully  implement  the  Supreme  Court\u2019s  directive  for  the \nseparation of  judiciary and  Executive.11 While  the  Supreme  Court  continues  to  be  held  in  high \nregard, perception about the integrity of the subordinate courts, including the district magistracy, \nis a cause of concern. \n\n12. \nThe core institutions of formal justice (the formal courts, prosecution, and the police) lack \nindependence and more could be done to enhance the performance of the subordinate courts. \nConsistent politicization of the justice sector agencies has been one of the key causes for the \ndeterioration  of  the  justice  system;  political  parties  in  power  have  deliberately  appointed  their \nloyalists in the justice system to ensure political protection and gains. The political parties, once \nin power, were unwilling to relinquish their influence over the judiciary and initiate the process of \njudicial reforms, particularly the separation of the judiciary from the Executive. The politicization \nof the higher judiciary has adversely influenced rule-based governance.  \n\n13. \nSince  access  to  justice  through  the  formal  system  is  costly  and  largely  inaccessible  to \nthe poor and marginalized, an informal institution (referred to as  shalish) is integrated into the \nrural  social  structure.  The  shalish  system  renders  fast  judgment  on  local  disputes  but  suffers \nfrom  gender  and  class  biases.  In  addition,  the  shalish  system  has  been  captured  by  political \ninterests which reduces the likelihood of fair local dispute resolution. \n\n3. \n\nPublic Sector Governance \n\n14. \nThe performance of Bangladesh\u2019s public service is constrained by (i) a top-down culture \nthat  leaves  little  space  for  mid-level  officials  to  exercise  independent  authority,  (ii)  inadequate \ncompensation of public officials, (iii) the absence of a fair system of reward and penalty, (iv) the \nlack  of  professional  development  training  and  other  incentives  to  improve  performance  and \naccountability,  (v)  the  lack  of  systematic  and  merit-based  policies  for  recruitment,  (vi) \ninadequate safeguards for actions taken in good faith, (vii) frequent reassignments often driven \nby political and other considerations, (viii) pressures faced by reform-minded officials in creating \nspace for change in government agencies, and (ix) a lack of uniform public demand for reform. \n\nThe  lack  of  significant  progress  in  administrative  governance  is  exacerbated  by  the \n15. \nfailure of successive governments, and the civil service itself, to pursue the reform agenda. The \nPublic Administration Reform Commission and several other studies have identified areas that \nundermine  the  efficiency  of  the  bureaucracy.  These  include  (i)  outside  interference  in \nadministrative decision making, (ii) politicization of the civil service, (iii) nepotism and favoritism, \n(iv) a lack of delegated authority by mid-level and local-level public officials, (v) a lack of public \nscrutiny of public administration, and (vi) a paucity of citizen demand for improvements in public \nadministration.\n\n                                                \n11 In  what  has  turned  out  to  be  a  rather  routine  affair,  in  late  July  2007  the  Government  once  again  asked  for  an \nextension to fulfill the formal requirements of the separation of the judiciary (see footnote 35). The Supreme Court \nhas given the Government until the end of October to complete official formalities to implement the separation. \n\n\f5\n\n4. \n\nCorruption as a Key Governance Problem \n\n16. \nThere is unanimous acceptance that the single-most telling indicator of poor governance \nin Bangladesh over the years has been the high incidence of pervasive corruption.12 According \nto  surveys  conducted  by  organizations  such  as  Transparency  International  and  Political  Risk \nServices,  Bangladesh  consistently  ranks  among  the  most  corrupt  nations  in  the  world. \nTransparency International Bangladesh (TIB) says that corruption has manifested itself in some \nvery  stark  socioeconomic  indicators,  including  the  fact  that  the  country  lost  $35  million  to \ncorruption in 2005.13 TIB and other corruption survey reports also show the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMore than one third of service recipients are forced to pay a bribe for admission \nto  school,  almost  30%  have  to  pay  to  gain  access  to  health  care  (outdoor \ntreatment), and nearly 80% pay to gain police clearance. \nNine out of 10 respondents in a TIB study on three police stations in 2004 paid \nvarious sums to lodge initial complaints, almost all of them had to pay a sum to \nvisit detainees, and 98% had to pay a sum to dissuade the police from torturing \ndetainees.\nFor  low-income  households,  almost  10%  of  household  income  is  lost  in  the \npayment of bribes (comparative figures are 4.5% for middle-income households \nand 2.3% for high-income households). \n\n17. \nThe broader economic picture is gloomier: off-the-record payments by firms cumulatively \nresult in 2\u20133% of gross domestic product (GDP) being foregone annually. A study done by the \nBangladesh Enterprise Institute in 2003 found that 60% of big firms surveyed viewed corruption \nas  the  top  constraint  to  their  work.  The  2004  World  Development  Report 14 stated  that  the \nvolume  of  illegal  payments  by  firms  is  almost  3%  of  their  total  sales.  These  are  significant \nnumbers  which  point  to  the  failure  of  previous  governments  to  tackle  the  culture  of  corruption \nand impunity. \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nIssues\n\n18. \nThe  characteristics  of  the  corruption  problem  in  Bangladesh  are  multifaceted.  The \ndetailed country governance assessment conducted by ADB in 2003\u20132004, and an analysis of \nthe recent political trends in the country,15 has identified that corruption in Bangladesh has been \n                                                \n12 The  term  corruption  has  wide  meaning.  As  used  in  the  context  of  this  Program,  it  encompasses,  among  other \nthings,  graft,  fraud,  rent  seeking,  bribery,  money  laundering,  misuse  of  political  office  for  personal  gain,  and \nmaladministration that unnecessarily adds transaction costs to service users (such costs are increasingly employed \nas proxy indicators of the incidence and level of corruption). This last point has been captured in corruption-survey \nwork  by  a  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  in  Bangladesh  which  has  determined  an  indicator  titled  hairani\nwhich  gauges  the  extent  of  harassment  that  service  users  are  put  through  by  service  providers  (see  Power \nParticipation  Research  Centre.  2007.  Unbundling  Governance:  Reforms,  Processes,  Institutions,  and  Risks.\nDhaka.  [April]).  Such  harassment  invariably  leads  to  a  situation  of  vulnerability  to  corruption  since  service  users \nhave adverse incentive to give bribes to receive the services (thus adding to their transaction costs of interacting \nwith the service providers). \n\n13 Zaman,  Iftekhar.  2006.

Bangladesh-Country Governance Assessment. Manila. The National Integrity Systems Country Study \nReport,  prepared  by  Transparency  International  in  2003,  identified  the  following  as  some  of  the  priority  areas  for \nreform:  weak  public-sector  recruitment  policies,  weak  enforcement  of  conflict-of-interest  rules,  the  absence  of \nregulation of party political finance, and the lack of independence of the lower judiciary. The Public Administration \nService Reforms Commission has also recommended improvements in transparency and accountability in service \ndelivery. \n\n\f6\n\nimpacted  by  several  variables.  Key  ones  that  are  relevant  to  the  proposed  Program  (and  are \ndetailed below) include: (i) public financial management problems, (ii) civil service problems, (iii) \na lack of judicial independence, and (iv) official secrecy.  \n\nPublic Financial Management. Weak internal and external control measures and poor \n19.\nauditing  and  accounting  standards  mean  that  the  scope  for  corruption  is  high.  There  are \nincreasing  backlogs  of  audits  for  the  Public  Accounts  Committee,  and  in  the  absence  of  a \nParliament  at  present,  the  current  Government  may  be  unable  to  act  on  the  annual  audit  and \nother  general  audit  reports.16 Monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms  in public-sector  agencies \nare also considered weak, thus exacerbating financial management weaknesses. \n\nA related area of concern has been with public procurement processes. Deficiencies in \n\n20. \nthe procurement process that give rise to corruption include: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nan underdeveloped legal framework (which has largely since been remedied with \npassage of the Public Procurement Law 2006); \ncomplex  and  often  inconsistent  procurement  rules  and  procedures  among \nvarious agencies; \ninadequate  human-resource  capacity  as  reflected  in  poor  quality  bidding \ndocuments and bid evaluation; and \nan absence of mechanisms for ensuring transparency and accountability.  \n\n21. \nDespite  the  recent  enactment  of  the  Public  Procurement  Law,  weaknesses  in  public \nprocurement processes continue to be evident given that no related rules and regulations have \nyet been framed. The World Bank recently completed an assessment of procurement practices \nin  Bangladesh  and  concluded  that  the  implementation  of  procurement  is  very  uneven  across \nagencies and, barring some exceptions, the process is far from satisfactory. \n\nProblems  with  the  Civil  Service.  The  problems  within  the  civil  service  are  manifold. \n22.\nThere is general consensus that prevailing weaknesses within the civil service have significantly \ncompounded  poor  governance  in  Bangladesh.  Recruitment,  appointment,  and  promotion \nprocedures  emphasize  patronage  over  merit,  thus  encouraging  rent-seeking  behavior.17 Low \nsalaries  and  a  lack  of  incentives  result  in  poor  motivation  amongst  civil  servants,  with  the \nattendant  risks  of  increased  vulnerability  to  corruption.  Potential  entrants  into  the  Bangladesh \ncivil service have no faith in the impartiality of the entry examination system, and a stifling quota \nsystem  remains  in  place.18 Media  reports  and  assessments  voice  popular  perception  that  the \n\n                                                \n16  Indeed,  the  office  of  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  (C&AG)  in  late  July  2007  asked  the  caretaker \ngovernment  to  immediately  constitute  a  Public  Accounts  Committee  (PAC)  on  an  ad-hoc  basis  to  scrutinize  the \naccounts  of  the  Government  and  reports  of  the  C&AG  in  the  absence  of  parliament.  This  is  in  line  with  a \nrecommendation  made  to  the  Government  by  the  World  Bank  in  June  2007  which  highlighted  that  given  the \nschedule of submission of reports by C&AG, there is a danger that the C&AG reports starting from FY2004\u20132005 \nwill not have been acted upon for at least three years if the country is to wait until early 2009 for a parliament to be \nin place. In asking for the formation of a PAC on an ad-hoc basis, the C&AG has drawn the Government\u2019s attention \nto  the  fact  that  already  in  mid-2007,  the  increase  in  the  number  of  unresolved  audit  reports  involves  millions  of \ndollars and the cases of retired government officials who are not getting their pensions due to unsettled objections \nremain  high.  The  need  for  an  ad  hoc  Public  Accounts  Committee  is  not  new  in  Bangladesh;  it  has  been  formed \nonce before in 1983 (see, \u201cGovt accounts pile up as parliament missing,\u201d The Daily Star [Dhaka], Thursday, 26 July  \n2007). \n\n17 The  Bangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee  reports  that  \u201ccivil  servants  tend  to  view  the  politicization  of  the \nPSC  [Public  Service  Commission]  as  the  root  cause  of  corruption  in  the  recruitment  process\u201d  (BRAC.  2006.  The\nState of Governance in Bangladesh. Dhaka). \n\n18 The quota system for both the cadre and noncadre posts in the civil service has merit  posts  weighted at a mere \n45%, while district-based quotas include: freedom fighter\u2019s children (30%), females (10%), tribal (5%), and general \n(10%).\n\n\f7\n\nPublic Service Commission (PSC) itself is politicized and thus unable to make the civil service \nmerit-based.\n\nLack of Judicial Independence. While the Supreme Court is widely regarded as being \n23.\nindependent  of  the  executive,  it  is  the  lower-tier  magistracy  (which  is  responsible  for  trying \ncriminal  cases  and  is  staffed  by  civil  service  assistant  commissioners) that  is  not  independent \nand that has been the most susceptible to corruption.19 A recent study asserts that \u201cpossibly the \nmost  serious  of  the  core  governance  failures  \u2026  is  the  lack  of  independence  of  the  lower \njudiciary, the magistracy\u201d (footnote 17). With the exception of the Supreme Court, the judiciary \ndoes  not  have  its  own  budgetary  allocation;  funding  for  the  courts  is  channeled  through  the \nMinistry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs (MLJPA). This lack of judicial independence \nhas, therefore, affected the quality of new entrants into the service over the years. \n\nOfficial  Secrecy. Compounding this problem is that of a culture of official secrecy that \n24.\neffectively  undermines  public  accountability.  The  traditional  practice  of  closed-door  policy \ndevelopment,  legal  drafting,  public  decision  making,  and  the  official  practice  of  classifying  all \ngovernment business as top secret, secret, confidential, or restricted, has not helped engender \na culture of openness in government business. As a result of this classification system, official \ninformation  cannot  be  disclosed  without  authorization.  Under  the  Official  Secrecy  Act,  1923, \nunauthorized disclosure is a criminal offense.20\n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n25. \nThere are several signs that these corruption-related variables are now being addressed, \nproviding opportunities for making a substantial contribution towards combating corruption. The \ncurrent Government has declared, and exhibited, political willingness to take a very tough line \non  corruption,  and  on  instituting  necessary  systemic  reforms.  Fortunately,  the  focus  on \nanticorruption is backed by wide public support for systemic reforms in the country. \n\nReforms  in  the  Anticorruption  Commission.  The  Anticorruption  Commission  was \n26.\ncreated in 2004 and, even though it has had its teething problems, it is set to play a critical role \nin  fighting  corruption.  In  early  2007,  in  order  to  provide  the  commission  with  a  more  vibrant \nleadership,  it  was  reconstituted  at  the  top  with  three  new  commissioners.  Further,  it  has  been \ngiven  additional  powers  to  fulfill  its  functions.  The  Anticorruption  Commission  rules  of \nprocedures that were not in place prior to 2007 have also been approved. In late March 2007, \nthe president approved the Anticorruption Commission rules, which also provide for an internal \nanticorruption  committee  within  the  Anticorruption  Commission  to  combat  corruption  and \nirregularities within the commission itself. \n\n27. \nPlanned  reforms  at  the  Anticorruption  Commission  by  the  new  leadership  focus  on, \namong  others  things,  (i)  a  stronger  decentralized  network  and  structure  of  Anticorruption \nCommission operations so as to better manage the initial handling of cases before all matters \nend up at headquarters and thus creating a stifling backlog of cases, (ii) a planned performance \nmanagement  scheme  which  will  provide  incentives  to  the  commission  staff  based  on \ndemonstrated performance, (iii) a separate prosecution unit to minimize reliance on government \nprosecutors to take up the cases, (iv) consideration of the outsourcing of noncore commission \nfunctions  (with  due  regard  for  security  and  confidentiality  of  information)  so  as  to  be  more \n                                                \n19 Indeed,  it  is  the  Ministry  of  Establishment  that  determines  a  judge\u2019s  career  path  and  where  he  or  she  is  to  be \nposted next, not a court administrator, registrar, or a senior judge. Now that the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) \nhas been established, it is hoped that the Commission will play a stronger role in this. \n\n20 In  Bangladesh,  along  with  the  1923  Official  Secrecy  Act,  the  Evidence  Act  (1872),  Penal  Code,  the  Code  of \nCriminal Procedure (1960), and the Rules of Business (1996) are the laws that restrict people\u2019s rights of access to \ninformation.\n\n\f8\n\nefficient, (v) automation and computerization of cases and records management, and (vi) more \naggressively partnering with civil society to address corruption from the community level. \n\nReforms  of  Political  Parties.  Due  to  politicization  in  practically  all  walks  of  life  in  the \n28.\ncountry,  and  the  attendant  risks  of  corruption  that  this  has  engendered  (including  abundant \nopportunities for special interest groups to secure influence over government decision making), \nreform of political parties is critical. The Election Commission intends to put in place campaign \nfinance  and  other  rules  that  will  begin  to  address  this  systemic  weakness.  Policies  that  are \nbeing  considered  include  (i)  the  oversight  of  rules  governing  party  funding,  (ii)  publicizing  the \nlevel  of  donations  and  sources  of  party  revenue,  (iii)  public  disclosures  by  political  candidates \nboth  before  and  after  elections,  (iv)  imposing  a  ban  on  the  use  of  state  resources  for  political \npurposes,  and  (v)  establishing  partial  public  funding  for  political  parties.  Proposals  have  also \nbeen  made  to  disassociate  professional  and  student  bodies  from  political  parties  as  a \nrequirement for registration. \n\nReforms in the Civil Service. The Government is aware that the primary way by which \n29.\ncorruption can be tackled in the long term is to target the development of a merit-based, suitably \nrewarded  civil  service.  It  has  reconstituted  the  PSC  by  appointing  a  new  chairman  and  other \nmembers,21 and has planned to develop a strategic perspective for improving the quality of the \ncivil service, beginning with recruitment and promotion policies and practices. Indeed, the PSC\u2019s \nlatest  annual  report  suggests  that  the  quota  system  needs  a  fundamental  review,  and  steps \nhave been initiated to tighten the entry examination system. \n\nJudicial  Independence.  The  Government  has  made  clear  its  intention  to  implement \n30.\nseveral  Supreme  Court  rulings  demanding  that  the  judiciary  (primarily  at  the  local  level)  be \nindependent of the executive. Commensurate with this, there is also a commitment to increase \ntransparency and accountability of the judiciary itself as well as support the JSC. The necessary \nprocedural work for the separation is being done; accordingly, the Supreme Court will assume \nadministrative  functions,  including  direct  supervision  and  control  of  the  subordinate  judiciary, \njudicial  magistrates,  and  administration  of  the  criminal  justice  system.  A  Judicial  Service  Pay \nCommission has also been established to review judicial remuneration. \n\nJudicial  independence\u2014indeed,  openness  in  government  business  as  a  whole\u2014is \n31. \nexpected to be bolstered by current plans to ensure the right to information. It is still early but \nthere  are  encouraging  signs  that  the  Government  is  favorably  disposed  towards  legislating  a \nright-to-information act in the not too distant future. \n\nRole  of  Civil  Society  and  the  Media.  Quite  separately  from  the  actions  of  the \n32.\nGovernment, and more so in recent months than ever before, civil society and the media have \ncontinued  to  highlight  cases  of  corruption  across  the  country,  and  already  there  are  in  place \nmechanisms  at  the  local  level  that  should  give  an  impetus  to  demands  to  address  corruption. \nThe  work  of  the  TIB-supported  Committee  of  Concerned  Citizens  is  reflective  of  this.  In \nrecognition  of  the  substantive  role  that  civil  society  can  play  in  fighting  corruption,  the \nAnticorruption  Commission  has  now  actively  sought  to  partner  with  NGOs  and  others  at  the \nlocal level.\n\n                                                \n21 The new chairman of the commission was nominated in May 2007, and other senior appointments have also been \nmade  in  recent  months.  In  this  regard,  there  are  calls  for  amending  Article  138  of  the  Constitution  to  enable  the \nchairperson and members of the PSC to be appointed by a select committee rather than by the prime minister in \neffect.  This  would  serve  the  purpose  of  instituting  some  transparency  into  the  nomination  process,  with  a \nconsequent focus on merit in the selection. \n\n\f9\n\n3. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n33. \nThe Government has stated its vision of establishing a modern democratic Bangladesh \nfree from corruption, discrimination, and exploitation. The National Poverty Reduction Strategy \nplaces  importance  on,  amongst  other  things,  making  governance  work  for  the  poor.  The \npriorities under the strategy include promoting good governance, tackling corruption, enhancing \naccess  to  justice  for  the  poor,  and  improving  sectoral  governance.  The  National  Poverty \nReduction  Strategy  (NPRS)  also  argues  that  any  anticorruption  strategy  should  touch  on \ndeterrence,  system  improvements,  and  value-creation. 22  Along  these  lines,  the  strategy  to \npromote good governance by combating corruption entails the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nin the short term, a focus on enforcement and sanctions to directly address the \nculture of impunity and to enhance public trust in government; \nin the medium term, to strengthen the core institutions of governance, including \nthe Anticorruption Commission, judiciary, Election Commission, and PSC, so that \nfundamental reforms in the system can begin to be embedded and also will not \nbe easily reversed by future governments; and \nin the long term, a focus on: \n(a) \n(b) \n\npublic awareness and education on preventive measures; \ncreating  the  right  conditions  for  the  public  sector  to  enhance  public \nservice delivery; and \nfundamentally  altering  the  manner  in  which  the  laws  (such  as  on \ncompetition  and  regulation)  are  applied  so  that  the  polity  is  qualitatively \nbetter at managing development. \n\n(c) \n\n34. \n\nThis is consistent with international experience on how to best fight corruption.23\n\n4. \n\nADB Strategy, Operations, and Lessons \n\nStrategy.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  on  good  governance  in  Bangladesh  is  based  on  the \n35.\nunderstanding that reform of institutions is an urgent priority. It is also based on the assumption \nthat cumulative effects of decades of poor governance cannot be overcome immediately, or on \nall fronts at once. Recognition that a long timeframe will be required to make an impact, and that \nthere should be greater attention to transforming institutions, is required in light of the range and \nseverity of issues to be addressed. ADB has stated that in Bangladesh it will continue to play a \nmajor  role  in  improving  sector  governance,  complemented  by  catalytic  support  to  address \ncritical  constraints  to  core  governance.  In  close  cooperation  with  other  development  partners, \nADB  will  support  measures  aimed  at  combating  corruption,  improving  access  to  justice,  and \nbuilding governance management capacity.  \n\nOperations. ADB\u2019s operations in Bangladesh are based on the assumption that building \n36.\na well-governed public sector is one of the most important priorities. A long-term commitment to \ncapacity development, encouragement of good governance practices, and an appropriate policy \nenvironment are critical, together with ownership and commitment to reforms by political leaders, \nGovernment,  and  civil  society.  Accordingly,  ADB\u2019s  operations  have  focused  on  support  to  the \n\n                                                \n22 Planning Commission. 2004. Unlocking the Potential: National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction. Dhaka \n\n(December).\n\n23 International  experience  shows  that  there  are  no  quick  fixes  in  fighting  corruption,  and  that  a  balanced  and \nsequenced  approach  (of  prevention,  detection,  and  prosecution  and  sanctions)  is  essential,  as  is  an  appropriate \ninstitutional  framework.  International  experience  also  shows  the  need  for  the  following  to  fight  corruption:  (i)  a \nstrategic vision, with high-level ownership; (ii) good governance in the mainstream in sectoral agencies; and (iii) a \nfocus  on  broad  governance  issues,  including  on  improving  fiscal  management,  financial  management,  public \nservice professionalism, public sector management efficiency, and corporate governance. \n\n\f10\n\nGovernment  in  various  areas,  including  helping  develop  an  overarching  National  Integrity \nStrategy  (NIS)  to  provide  a  strategic  policy  framework  for  anticorruption,  and  establishing  and \nstrengthening  the  Anticorruption  Commission.  Current  operations  at  the  sectoral  level  have \nfocused on governance reforms (as part of a larger program of support on sectoral investments) \nin the railway, power, and port sectors.24\n\nLessons.  A  review  conducted  as  part  of  the  preparation  of  the  2003  Country \n37.\nGovernance  Assessment  Report  for  Bangladesh  showed  that  the  experience  of  development \npartners in the governance sector in the country, as indeed elsewhere as well, was that success \nhas been greatest and sustained the longest when the development partner has: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nmaintained long-term involvement in the sector; \ncombined  programs  of  incremental  reform  with  capacity  development  and \ninvestment support; \nidentified\u2013and  substantially  engaged  with\u2013supporters \nelsewhere; and \nbuilt  effective  partnerships  with  other  development  partners,  the  private  sector, \nand civil society.\n\nin  government  and \n\n38. \nThis  Program  is  in  keeping  with  that  trend,  and  is  also  based  on  the  lessons  learned \nfrom the Operations Evaluation Department\u2019s evaluation of the country assistance program for \nBangladesh  (January  2003)  for  ADB  lending, 25 the  recommendations  of  which  included  the \nneed  for  a  more  proactive  approach  to  governance  issues,  and  the  support  of  local  reform-\nminded people.26 An upcoming Operations Evaluation Department sector evaluation study also \nhighlights  the  benefits  of  flexibility  in  policy  loan  conditions,  and  the  provision  of  sufficient \nto  support  capacity  development. 27  These  recommendations  are \ntechnical  assistance \nincorporated  in  this  Program,  where  particular  attention  has  been  placed  on  ensuring  that \nProgram executing and implementing agencies receive targeted capability-building assistance.  \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n\n39. \nDue  to  the  magnitude  of  the  corruption  problem  in  Bangladesh,  ADB\u2019s  work  must  be \nviewed  as  part  of  a  larger  multidonor  strategy  to  fight  corruption.  Development  partners  are \n                                                \n24 These include: (i) ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Supporting Good \nGovernance. Manila (TA 4140-BAN, approved on 4 July for $1.1 million); (ii) ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Supporting  Good  Governance  Initiatives  II.  Manila  (TA  4743-BAN, \napproved on 19 December, for $750,000);  and (iii) ADB.  2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of \nBangladesh for Preparing the Good Governance Project. Manila (TA 4744-BAN, approved on 19 December, for $1 \nmillion).  While  TA  4140-BAN  looked  specifically  at  how  the  Anticorruption  Commission  could  be  structured  and \nhow an institutional framework for anticorruption work could be developed, the ongoing TA 4744-BAN is a project \npreparatory technical assistance which largely focuses on developing the NIS, and on looking at the legal aspects \nof the work of the Anticorruption Commission (other tasks include doing a vulnerabilities to corruption assessment \nfor  the  energy,  port,  and  railways  sectors).  TA  4743-BAN  focuses  specifically  on  strengthening  the  technical \naspects of Anticorruption Commission work. The latter two TA projects will enable the Anticorruption Commission \nto  better  fulfill  its  mandates,  and  this  will  enable  the  Good  Governance  Program  to  yield  the  desired  outcomes. \nIncreasingly, ADB support at the sectoral level has incorporated components that focus on good governance. This \nhas meant that good governance is being brought into the mainstream in the sectors, which is also one of the key \ngoals  of  this  proposed  program.  Some  sector  projects  and  programs  where  this  has  been  evident  include,  for \nexample, the Sustainable Power Sector Development Program (Project No. 36107), the Railway Sector Investment \nProgram  (Project  No.  32234-02),  and  the  Chittagong  Port  Trade  Facilitation  Project  (Loan  2147-BAN).  In  the \nChittagong Port project, for example, development of  an  anticorruption strategy is  one  of the policy  conditions of \nthe project. \n\n25 OED. 2003.

Summary of Lessons from Evaluations of ADB Programs in Support of Public Sector Reform. Forthcoming. \n\n\f11\n\nactive in Bangladesh in the area of good governance and anticorruption (see Appendix 3), and \nareas of support have included: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\npublic service capability building and reforms; \ntransparency,  accountability,  and  voice  (including  procurement  reforms  and \nfinancial accountability); \njustice sector reforms (including police reforms and legal capacity development); \nparliamentary strengthening (including Parliament\u2019s role in executive oversight); \nanticorruption  (including  the  establishment  of  a  financial  intelligence  unit,  and \nfostering anticorruption initiatives at the service-delivery level); \nhuman rights; and \nlocal  governance  (including  participatory  governance,  in  particular  through \nsupporting civil society to demand greater accountability). \n\n40. \nCoordination among development partners in these and other activities is done through \nseveral  local  consultative  group  committees,  including  on  governance,  the  judiciary,  and \nanticorruption. ADB is an active member of these committees. The level of coordination existing \namong the development partners with respect to this Program is evident in their decision to be \ninvolved in the Program. \n\n6. \n\nRationale \n\n41. \nThe Government has taken a strong stand on developing major reforms to address the \nproblem  of  corruption.  This  is  a  major  program  of  the  Government,  which  has  publicly \nchampioned  it,  and  it  conforms  with  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  on  good  governance  and \ncontributes directly to desired outcomes in this sector. \n\n42. \nGovernance  reform  is  multidimensional,  but  currently  in  Bangladesh  the  core  of  such \nreforms has to be anticorruption, an area that this Program directly and substantially addresses. \nWhile the extent of development partners\u2019 involvement in areas associated with governance is \nextensive, there is no program in place that directly targets addressing the primary symptom of \npoor  governance  (i.e.,  corruption)  within  a  broad  and  comprehensive  approach  to  good-\ngovernance  outcomes.  This  proposed  Program  thus  focuses  less  on  the  area  of  governance \nthat  other  development  partners  are  already  targeting,  but concentrates  more  on  areas  where \nthe  Government\u2019s  bold  move  to  fundamentally  alter  the  governance  landscape  needs  to  be \nsupported.  Indeed,  other  development  partners  have  accepted  that  this  proposed  Program \noffers  a  viable  opportunity  to  tackle  poor  governance  in  Bangladesh,  and  several  have \nexpressed an interest in being involved in it. \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n43. \nThe  governance  reforms  (particularly  on  anticorruption)  initiated  by  the  Government \nneed to be made more extensive and embedded, which is why the Good Governance Program \nis vital at this juncture. The design of the reform program is based on the recommendations of \nthe ADB country governance assessment (footnote 15) which, based on detailed assessments \nas  well  as  reflections  from  lessons  learnt,  recommended  that  a  three-pronged  governance \nstrategy be put in place, consisting of (i) a primary focus on sectoral governance initiatives, (ii) a \nfocus on both enforcement and prevention, and (iii) working with the Government and the public \non a dialogue for governance reforms and collaboration with donors. \n\n\f12\n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n44. \nThe  proposed  Good  Governance  Program  is  in  keeping  with  international  experience \nand  the  Government\u2019s  own  stated  outcomes  on  good  governance  and  anticorruption.  It  is \nexpected  to  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  enhanced  public  access  to  effective  public \nservices  for  the  citizens  of  Bangladesh.  The  key  outcome  of  the  Program  will  be  improved \ngovernance and a lower incidence of corruption in the public sector. (Appendix 1 provides the \nprogram framework). The outcome of the Program will be reflected in: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nincreased  consensus  on  good  governance,  integrity,  and  anticorruption  reforms \nin the country; \nincreased performance of, and transparency within, key institutions mandated to \nfight and prevent corruption, such as the Anticorruption Commission, the judiciary, \nprosecution, and civil society; \nbringing  into  the  mainstream  initiatives  on  good  governance  and  anticorruption \nwithin selected sectoral-level agencies vital to public services; and \nthe strengthening of corruption prevention mechanisms such as the office of the \nombudsman, the right to information act, and legal and institutional framework for \nprotection of those who report corruption cases. \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n1. \n\nOutcome \n\nThe policy actions supported by this program loan will lead to improved governance and \n45. \na  lower  incidence  of  corruption  in  the  public  sector  (Appendix  4  presents  the  Development \nPolicy Letter and Policy Matrix of the program loan). The outcome of improved governance and \nthe lower incidence of corruption will be visible in (i) the work of key government entities (e.g., \nthose  which  are  implementing  the  MTBF)  in  addressing  vulnerabilities  to  corruption  aligned  to \nthe  NIS  which,  in  turn,  will  be  guided  by  the  principles  and  commitments  under  the  United \nNations  Convention  Against  Corruption  (UNCAC);  (ii)  the  Anticorruption  Commission  having  a \nstrengthened  and  more  effective  role  in  various  parts  of  the  country;  (iii)  a  transparent  and \naccountable  judiciary  at  all  levels  playing  a  critical  role  in  combating  corruption  in  the  country; \nand  (iv)  good  governance  and  anticorruption  initiatives  within  selected  sectoral  level  agencies \nenhancing the effectiveness of those agencies. \n\n2. \n\nProgram Outputs  \n\n46. \n\nThe Program will support the achievement of the following three outputs.28\n\na. \n\nOutput 1: Vision, Strategy, and Procedures \n\nNational  Integrity  Strategy. 29  As  a  first  step  to  ensure  a  strong  reform  regime  in \n47.\ngovernance,  it  is  necessary  to  formulate  and  implement  the  NIS  which  sits  at  the  core  of  the \ngood  governance  agenda.  It  is  based  on  the  premise  that  good  governance  is  fostered  by \nencouraging  and  facilitating  a  dialogue  among  key  participants,  including  civil  society, \nacademia, government, and politicians; in that sense, the NIS is expected to constitute a broad \n\n                                                \n28 The outputs and performance targets of the Program are in the program framework in Appendix 1. \n29 Supplementary Appendix C discusses the NIS in greater detail. Work on the NIS is currently ongoing and care is \nbeing taken to ensure that there is commitment to the exercise from the top political and bureaucratic leadership \neven as the  work is in the initial stages. Even the design  of the NIS is informed by  broad stakeholder input from \nacross the country; by September 2008, a final NIS is expected to be in place.  \n\n\f13\n\nnational  consensus  on  how  to  deal  with  corruption  and  issues  of  poor  governance.  The \nproposed  Program  will  enable  the  Government  to  disseminate  and  implement  a  nationally \nowned and well-resourced NIS. In addition, special arrangements for top-level coordination and \nsteering of the NIS will be required to continuously monitor and support the implementation of \nthe  strategy  at  all  levels  of  the  government,  across  different  line  ministries,  and  across  the \ncountry with the active support of civil society. This high-level coordination and ownership of the \nNIS is proposed to be provided by a National Integrity Advisory Committee (NIAC), consisting of \nsupporters from areas including the highest levels of Government, civil society, and academia, \nwhich  will  meet  at  least  twice  a  year  to  give  guidance  on  implementation  of  the  NIS.  This  is \ncritical if the strategy is to be brought into the everyday work of Government agencies. 30\n\n48. \nThe  Program  will  support  a  national  and  broad-based  development  of  the  NIS  and  its \nimplementation across sectors and different levels of government. Work on the NIS is currently \nunderway  with  leadership  from  the  Cabinet  Division,  and  the  strategy  is  likely  to  focus  on, \namong other things (see Supplementary Appendix C): \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nstrengthening of the relevant legislative and institutional mechanisms; \nmaking effective use of NGOs to provide external measures of control; \nfurther strengthening of current internal control measures in selected ministries; \ndeveloping  an  ethics-  and  values-based  public  service  to  complement  the \nexisting rules-based measures; \nmobilizing resources outside the government to encourage the private sector, the \nmedia, and others to scrutinize every aspect of government expenditure; and \ndetermining  strategic  measures  against  all  forms  of  corruption  at  all  levels  (i.e., \nensuring that, to the extent practical, all types of corruption are addressed). \n\nThe  United  Nations  Convention  Against  Corruption  (UNCAC).31 In  its  national  and \n49.\nlocal interventions, the NIS will articulate the goals, targets, and approach of the UNCAC, which \nthe  Government  acceded  to  in  early  2007,  thus  setting  the  overarching  framework  for \nanticorruption  efforts  at  the  country  level.  The  Convention  contains  an  extensive  treatment  of \nhow  corruption  can\u2014and  should\u2014be  tackled.  It  encourages  signatories  to  (i)  set  up \nautonomous  anticorruption  watchdogs,  (ii)  establish  merit-based  and  impartial  public  service \nrecruitment,  (iii)  establish  public  service  codes  of  conduct,  (iv)  publish  details  of  government \nexpenditure,  and  (v)  ensure  transparency  in  election  campaign  funding.  Ratification  of  the \nConvention allows Bangladesh to enjoy international cooperation to combat corruption and also \nset up international auditing and accounting standards for the local private sector. \n\nThe  Anticorruption  Commission and  Anticorruption  Work. 32  Tackling  corruption \n50.\nrequires  that  the  Anticorruption  Commission  has  a  clear  legal  and  policy  framework,  rigorous \ninternal management systems,33 sufficient resources, and working partnerships with civil society. \nImprovements in its physical and human resources, as well as incentives, are also required to \n                                                \n30 This is also in line with the recommendation made by TIB in its Corruption Database Report in 2006 about the need \nfor  a  central  corruption  monitoring  unit  in  the  office  of  the  prime  minister,  so  as  to  ensure  that  the  individual \nministerial  and  departmental  monitoring  units  function  effectively.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  of  the  composition \nand functions of the NIAC will be finalized during the work of the project preparatory technical assistance currently \nbeing provided to Government. In particular, the terms of reference will highlight the relationship between the work \nof NIAC and the Anticorruption Commission. \n\n31 For more details on the UNCAC, see Supplementary Appendix B. \n32 See Supplementary Appendix D for a background note on the Anticorruption Commission. \n33 This  includes  instituting  transparency  within  the  Anticorruption  Commission  currently,  all  staff  members  are  to \nsubmit  asset  and  wealth  declarations.  In  early  2007  the  Government  approved  the  Anticorruption  Commission \nrules,  which,  amongst  other  things,  provides  for  an  internal  anticorruption  committee  within  the  Anticorruption \nCommission  to  combat  corruption  and  irregularities  within  the  organization.  As  of  June  2007,  the  committee  had \nalready taken disciplinary action against three staff members. \n\n\f14\n\nenable  it  to  effectively  fulfill  its  mandate.  The  Anticorruption  Commission  Act  calls  for \ninvestigation  skills  within  the  Anticorruption  Commission  and  so  there  is  immediate  need  to \nstrengthen  its  technical  professional  expertise.34 In  line  with  the  UNCAC,  asset  recovery  and \nanti-money  laundering  provisions  as  well  as  international  cooperation  systems  need  to  be \ndeveloped. The Program seeks to strengthen the Anticorruption Commission not only in terms \nof  its  physical  resources  but  also  in  respect  of  the  performance  management  scheme, \nprosecutorial capability, and partnerships with civil society. \n\nb. \n\nOutput 2: Enforcement and Sanction Mechanisms \n\nIndependent and Transparent Judiciary. Recent efforts to separate the judiciary from \n51.\nthe  Executive  require  that  necessary  systems  are  in  place  to  anchor  the  separation  on  clear \npolicies and legal frameworks as well as on clear provisions related to staffing and availability of \nphysical  resources  and  budgets. 35 Further,  to  enhance  the  transparency  and  accountability \nwithin the judiciary, it will be imperative to improve incentives for the judiciary. An independent \nand  well-resourced  JSC  also  needs  to  be  supported  to  ensure  that  recruitment  exercises  are \ncarried  out  regularly,  and  that  professionalism  in  recruitment  of  judges  is  maintained.  Support \nwill also be provided to increase the number of specific special anticorruption courts, particularly \nin  terms  of  the  physical  and  human-resource  requirements  of  these  courts.  The  Program  will \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  resolve  to  ensure  timely  adjudication  of  cases  filed  by  the \nAnticorruption  Commission  by  dedicated  courts.  To  improve  the  method  of  appointments  of \njudges  at  the  Supreme  Court,  special  legislation  as  mandated  by  the  Constitution  is  required. \nFinally, a more thorough implementation of the judges\u2019 code of conduct would increase public \ntrust in the institution. (Supplementary Appendix E has more details on the judiciary.) \n\nthe  public  prosecution  service \n\nImproved  Prosecution  Services.  Currently, \n\n52.\nis \nunderresourced,  and  its  capacity  is  weak.  Hence  it  is  unable  to  carry  out  independent  and \neffective prosecution of criminal cases in general, and of anticorruption cases in particular. The \nAnticorruption Commission and the judiciary cannot fulfill their roles if the prosecution service is \nnot  strengthened  and  legal  or  policy  changes  are  not  effected  to  enhance  its  performance. \nThere  is  consensus  within  Government  and  other  national  stakeholders  that  an  effective  fight \nagainst  corruption  will  not  be  possible  without  a  reliable  and  professional  prosecution  service. \nBased on this imperative, the Program will assist the Government to establish a permanent and \nindependent  prosecution  service  whose  members  will  be  recruited  through  competitive \nexaminations to be conducted by the Public Service Commission. (Supplementary Appendix E \nhas more details on the prosecution service) \n\n                                                \n34 Prior ADB technical assistance to the Anticorruption Commission (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  Bangladesh  for  Supporting  Good  Governance.  Manila  (TA  4140-BAN),  approved  on  4  July,  for  $1.1 \nmillion)  has  determined  that  in  order  to  be  able  to  fulfill  its  mandates  effectively,  the  commission  should  have \ncapabilities in investigation, intelligence, surveillance, prevention, prosecution, and corporate affairs. \n\n35 In early May  2007, the full court of the Appellate Division, taking the most crucial step in separating the judiciary \nfrom  the  Executive,  issued  a  three-point  directive  on  the  Government  for  the  creation  and  sanctioning  of  a \nparticular  number  of  posts  of  judicial  magistrates  across  the  country  along  with  manpower,  including  supporting \nstaff, allotment of courtrooms and chambers, and necessary budgetary allocations. The court asked the ministries \nof Establishment, Finance, Public Works, and Law to take immediate steps in this regard. As of the end of July, the \nGovernment had created and sanctioned 877 posts of judicial magistrates and 5,030 posts of supporting staff, and \nhad  also  sanctioned  logistical  support  including  allotment  of  courtrooms  and  chambers.  The  Government  also \nmaintains that necessary budgetary allocations for the judicial magistracy are being processed. On a matter related \nto  the  separation,  the  court  has  observed  that  the  Ministry  of  Law  will  work  as  an  \u2018appropriate  authority\u2019  for \ncommunications between the country\u2019s president and the Supreme Court on control and supervision of the judicial \nofficials until a separate and independent secretariat of the Supreme Court is established. \n\n\f15\n\nc. \n\nOutput 3: Prevention Mechanisms \n\nis  on \n\nFocused  Anticorruption \n\nInterventions.  The  emphasis \n\n53.\nimproving  sector \ngovernance and strengthening anticorruption mechanisms to reduce fraud and mismanagement, \nand  improve  services  for  citizens. 36  Sector  agencies  where  vulnerability  to  corruption \nassessments  (VCAs)  have  been  completed,  and  where  a  subsequent  anticorruption  strategy \nhas  been  prepared,  will  be  supported  to  implement  the  strategy.37 In  that  regard,  in  the  initial \nstage, and as part of ongoing reforms under the ADB-financed Trade Facilitation Project for the \nChittagong  Port  Authority  (CPA),  this  Program  will  help  implement  the  CPA\u2019s  anticorruption \nstrategy and ongoing efforts to improve efficiency and increase private sector participation in the \noperations  and  maintenance  of  the  port.  This  will  enable  CPA  to  improve  port  operations  and \nreduce opportunities for graft, fraud, and rent seeking.38 Program funds will enable CPA to put in \nplace  systems  that  will  improve  the  operations  and  governance  of  the  port,  thus  directly \naddressing corruption vulnerabilities. \n\nAccountability Mechanisms within Line Ministries. Tackling corruption is not likely to \n54.\nsucceed if sectoral agencies are not supported in identifying and fighting corruption.39 Given that \nthe work of the Anticorruption Commission alone is not likely to effectively tackle the problem, \nthere is need to ensure that opportunities to minimize corruption at the service-delivery level are \nalso  effectively  utilized.  In  this  context,  strengthening  the  existing  accountability  mechanisms \nwithin  line  ministries  can  contribute  significantly  to  minimizing  corruption  opportunities  at  the \nsectoral  or  agency  level.40 In  addition,  the  Program  will  also  assist  the  Government  to  fully \nimplement the existing rules on declaration of wealth and assets by public servants. \n\nGrievance  Redress  and  Access  to  Information.  While  the  Bangladesh  Constitution \n55.\n(Article 77) provides for an office of the ombudsman, and the Government in 1980 passed the \n                                                \n36 One  particular  area  where  a  direct  contribution  can  be  made  to  reduce  the  vulnerabilities  to  corruption  for  the \naverage citizen, and which has wide implications for widespread service delivery improvements, is the application \nof the 2004 Birth and Death Registration Act and its implementing rules. As of the end of 2007, the act makes it \nmandatory  for  anyone  wishing  to  access  about  14  services  (including  schooling,  getting  utility  connections,  land \nregistration,  passports,  driving  license,  and  banking)  to  furnish  a  birth  certificate.  However,  only  7\u201310%  of  the \npopulation  currently  has  a  birth  record.  It  is  expected  that  as  of  the  end  of  2007  when  the  act  is  to  be  fully \nimplemented (although there are indications that the effectiveness date will be extended yet again), there will be a \nsurge in the number of applicants seeking this document. Unless the Government can meet this increased demand \nin an effective, efficient, and transparent manner, it can be expected that both rent seeking for service delivery, as \nwell as delays and the need for \u201cspeed money\u201d in delivering birth certificates, will increase considerably.  \n\n37 Recognizing that not all agencies may have the skills and institutional capacity to conduct vulnerability to corruption \nassessments (VCAs) and prepare anticorruption strategies, the Program will pilot VCAs and anticorruption action \nplans in key selected agencies and then replicate them elsewhere. Agencies that could be covered by the Program \ninclude those in the power and transport sectors (where ADB investments are high, and where the vulnerabilities to \ncorruption are also high; these two sectors also received the highest (Tk 33.8 billion) and fourth-highest (Tk 28.11 \nbillion) revised sectoral allocation of the Annual Development Program FY2005\u20132006. \n\n38 The  purpose  of  assisting  the  CPA  in  enhancing  internal  governance  systems  is  to  complement  ongoing  ADB \nassistance in improving operations at the port, and so that its operational efficiency  will boost the economy since \n85%  of  all  of  the  country\u2019s  international  trade  takes  place  out  of  Chittagong  Port.  Pursuant  to  the  prior  ADB \nassistance,  the  CPA  has  already  developed  an  anticorruption  strategy,  and  a  VCA  there  will  corroborate  the \nvarious components of the newly formed strategy. (See Supplementary Appendix F for a background note on the \nChittagong Port.)\n\n39  This  focus  is  nothing  new:  at  the  heart  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Development  Support  Credit  III  provision  lies \ngovernance-related reforms at the macro and sector levels. It is also widely accepted in Bangladesh that \u201cwithout \nsignificant  improvements  in  sectoral  governance  of  key  sectors,  it  will  be  very  difficult  to  bring  about  a  better \ngovernance  reality.\u201d  (Power  Participation  Research  Centre.  2007.  Unbundling  Governance:  Reforms,  Processes, \nInstitutions, and Risks. Dhaka. [April]).  \n\n40 This is in line  with the recommendation made by TIB  in its Corruption Database Report in 2006 about how  each \nministry and department should establish special units to monitor newspaper reports and take appropriate actions. \nThe Government has issued a circular to ministries and departments instructing them to strengthen their citizens\u2019 \ncharters.\n\n\f16\n\nto  grievance  redress  mechanisms, \n\nnecessary act for its establishment, such an office has not yet been established.41 The Program \nwill provide support to the Government to establish an ombudsman\u2019s office to improve citizens\u2019 \naccess \nthereby  providing  an  additional  check  on \nmaladministration and corrupt practices. Also, the right to information is a critical requirement of \nenhancing  transparency  of  government  decisions.  Currently,  the  legal  framework  for  the \nexercise  of  this  right  does  not  exist.  Under  this  Program,  the  Government  will  be  assisted  to \nprepare and enact a right to information law as well as a whistleblower protection act. Support \nwill also be provided to review (for purposes of amending and repealing): \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  Official  Secrecy  Act  1923,  by  appropriately  defining  secrets  to  only  cover \nmatters of state security and price-sensitive information; and \nSection  9  of  the  Government  Services  (Conduct)  Rules  1979,  which  provides \neffective legal coverage for public officials to deny information to the press. \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n56. \n\nSome important features of the Program are as follows. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nFor  the  first  time  in  Bangladesh  it  develops  a  NIS  that  will  enable  agencies  to \ncritically assess their vulnerability to corruption, and will be owned by an NIAC at \nthe  highest  level  of  Government,  with  membership  from  Government,  NGOs, \nacademia, think tanks, and others. \nThe  NIS  itself  will  be  aligned  to  the  provisions  in  the  UNCAC,  which  the \nGovernment has acceded to. \nIt takes a holistic approach to combating corruption (i.e., it encompasses different \nbranches  of  government,  and  includes  prevention  as  well  as  enforcement  and \nsanctions) in line with the Government\u2019s vision articulated in the NPRS. \nIt conforms with the outcomes and new initiatives of the Government, which has \npublicly championed this Program. \n\nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe estimated adjustment costs of policy reforms under the Good Governance Program \n57. \nare  based  on  medium-term  adjustment  scenarios  and  are  illustrated  in  Table  1  (see \nSupplementary Appendix G for further details on the derivation of the indicative costs). \n\nOutput \n\n1.

The program loan will have a fixed term of 24 years, including a grace period of \n8  years.  The  interest  charge  will  be  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter.  Program  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  utilized  over  a  period  of  48 \nmonths from the date of loan effectiveness. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n59. \nThere are two executing agencies (EAs) for the Program: the Cabinet Division will be the \nEA for all the activities that relate to the Executive; while the Supreme Court will be the EA for \nthe program focus on strengthening the judiciary. Given the separation of the judiciary from the \nExecutive, and given that several policy reforms are within the judiciary, it is deemed necessary \nto  establish  two  EAs  so  that  responsibilities  for  attaining  outcomes  respective  to  the  two \nbranches  of  government  are  kept  separate.  Implementing  agencies  include  the  Anticorruption \nCommission, MLJPA, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Establishment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \nPublic  Service  Commission,  JSC,  Economic  Relations  Division  of  MOF,  and  other  sectoral \nagencies. (Appendix 5 has details of program implementation arrangements.) \n\n60. \nBoth  EAs  will  act  under  the  guidance  of  the  Program  Steering  Committee.  The \nCommittee will be chaired by the Cabinet Secretary. Its members will comprise representatives, \nnot below the rank of Joint Secretary, from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Office of the Registrar, \nACC, JSC, MLJPA, Economic Relations Division of MOF, Finance Division of MOF, Ministry of \nHome  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Ministry  of  Establishment, \nMinistry  of  Information,  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division,  and  Planning \nCommission.  Other  members,  such  as  from  the  Public  Service  Commission  or  from  line \n\n                                                \n42 Gap funding for the remaining costs is assumed to come from the support provided by other development partners \n\non governance and anticorruption reforms and judiciary support, and from the Government. \n\n\f18\n\nministries,  shall  be  co-opted  as  necessary.  The  Program  Coordinator  at  the  Cabinet  Division \nshall be the member-secretary of the Program Steering Committee. The Committee shall meet \nwhenever  necessary,  but  in  any  case  not  less  than  once  every  quarter,  to  (i)  provide  policy \nsupport;  (ii)  oversee  Program  implementation  and  progress;  and  (iii)  facilitate  cooperation  and \ncoordination among all relevant agencies. \n\nThere will be two program management units (PMUs), one at the Cabinet Division and \n\n61. \nthe other at the office of the registrar (Supreme Court). \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAt the Cabinet Division, the PMU, which consists of the existing Governance Unit, \nwill be headed by a program coordinator at the level of an additional secretary or \njoint secretary. There will also be two deputy program coordinators at the level of \ndeputy  secretary  or  senior  assistant  secretary,  and  one  administrative  officer. \nThere will be a full-time national consultant program manager for 48 months (and \na deputy program manager for the initial 24 months) to be based at the PMU to \nassist the program coordinator in the day-to-day implementation of the Program. \nIn  the  various  implementing  agencies  a  focal  point  will  be  designated  so  that \nclose coordination on a regular basis is possible. \n\nThe PMU at the Supreme Court will be headed by a program coordinator who will \nbe the registrar of the Supreme Court. The office of the registrar will appoint one \nadditional  program  coordinator,  who  will  be  at  the  level  of  additional  or  deputy \nregistrar, and one officer to ensure necessary support services to the PMU who \nwill  be  designated  as  Assistant  Program  Coordinator.  There  will  also  be  a  local \nfull-time consultant program manager who will be based at the PMU to assist the \nprogram coordinator in the day-to-day implementation of the Program. \n\n62. \nBoth  PMUs  will  be  responsible  for  work  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \nproviding  technical  support  to  the  relevant  agencies,  as  necessary.  They  will  coordinate  the \ndaily activities of the various implementing agencies, and will provide secretariat services for all \nprogram outputs, and support activities in their program areas.  \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n63. \nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  program  loan  are  to  be  completed  48  months  after \nloan  effectiveness.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the  implementation  of  various  policy  reforms \nand  associated  operational  matters  (such  as  on  separation  of  the  judiciary,  independent \nprosecution services, PSC functions, ongoing reforms at the CPA, departmental accountability \nsystems, and citizen grievance and redress mechanisms) will function on an ongoing basis even \nafter the completion of the program loan.  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n64. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  Program  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  costs  (excluding  local \ntaxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  member  countries  (other  than \nthose  specified  in  the  ineligible  list  in  Appendix  7  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources).  \n\nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \n65. \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans, 43 the  proceeds  of  the  Program  loan  will  be \n                                                \n43 ADB.  1998.  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans.  Manila \n\n(R50-98, 23 March). \n\n\f19\n\ndisbursed  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import \ndocumentation will be required but loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of certification \nprovided by the Borrower for a period of 12 months for eligible expenditures, starting 180 days \nprior to loan effectiveness. For each tranche, when Program loan proceeds are expected to be \ndisbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible \nimports, and (iii) imports financed under other official development assistance, will be equal to \nor  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will \ncertify \nimport \nrequest  complies  with \ndocumentation under existing procedures will be required.  \n\nthat  each  withdrawal \n\nformula.  Otherwise, \n\nthis \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\nThe Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated from the proceeds \n66. \nof the program loan will be made available to meet the indicative costs, on a proportional basis, \nassociated  with  the  implementation  of  the  Program, 44 with  particular  regard  to  the  following \nactions:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nthe implementation of the NIS and UNCAC at all levels; \nthe  operations  of  the  Anticorruption  Commission  at  the  central,  regional,  and \ndistrict levels; \nthe  separation  of  the  judiciary  from  the  Executive,  including  costs  for  capital \nexpenditures flowing from such separation; \nthe implementation of the approved recommendations of the Judicial Service Pay \nCommission; \nthe establishment and operation of independent prosecution services; \nimplementation of grievance handling mechanisms, including citizen report cards \nand office of the ombudsman; \nthe operation of the JSC, and the Judicial Service Pay Commission; and \nother  reforms,  including  any  performance  incentive  schemes  and  human-\nresource  plans  developed  under  the  Program,  reforms  at  the  CPA,  and \nindependent surveys on program-related interventions. \n\nAny  counterpart  funds  not  required  for  the  Program  will  be  used  for  good-governance \n\n67. \ninterventions.\n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n68. \nADB will monitor program implementation through periodic progress reports and will field \nregular missions to (i) confirm fulfillment of policy actions for tranche release; (ii) confirm release \nof adequate funds from Government for program activities; (iii) monitor continued applicability of \nthe assumptions that might impact Program success, such as on political conditions, as well as \non specified risks and their mitigating measures; and (iv) advise on actions to maintain effective \nimplementation within the program period. \n\nFinancing for the Program will include three tranches (the policy matrix [Appendix 4] lists \n\n69. \nthe conditions for the release of the three tranches). \n\n(i) \n\nThe  first  tranche  (not  exceeding  $50  million)  is  to  be  disbursed  upon  loan \neffectiveness,  or  soon  thereafter,  subject  to  Government  fulfillment  of  all  first \ntranche release conditions. \n\n                                                \n44 Program adjustment indicative costs and assumptions are highlighted in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\n\f20\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe second tranche (not exceeding $55 million) will be disbursed 12 months after \nprogram  loan  effectiveness,  upon  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding \ntranche release conditions (or earlier than 12 months if the conditions have been \nmet).\nThe  third  tranche  ($45  million)  will  be  disbursed  24  months  after  the  second \ntranche,  subject  to  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding  tranche  release \nconditions (or earlier than 24 months if the conditions have been met). \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n70. \nTo  ensure  proper  fund  management,  ADB  retains  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification  for  each  withdrawal \napplication.  Immediately  after  Program  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  open  a  Special \nAccount at Bangladesh Bank for the specific purpose of depositing and utilizing the Counterpart \nFunds.  And  prior  to  withdrawal,  the  Government  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  Bangladesh \nBank into which the proceeds of the loan will be deposited and from which all withdrawals will \nbe  made.  The  accounts  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  Both  PMUs  will  send  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms. The progress reports will describe progress made and any changes to the \nimplementation schedule, and identify any problems encountered and remedial actions taken.  \n\n7. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n71.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, each PMU will establish and maintain a system to \nmonitor Program performance that will include a database on the status of policy measures and \nProgram indicators, based on the policy matrix and the program framework. Such a system will \nhave the following features. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nBaseline data in the various areas that the Program targets (technical assistance \nto be provided to the PMUs will assist in the collection of such baseline data). \nProvision to incorporate the results of regular program monitoring activities, so as \nto track progress on a continuing basis. \nUse  of  such  a  system  to  better  inform  periodic  program  review  (particularly  for \nthe purposes of confirming fulfillment of tranche-related conditions).  \nProvision to incorporate relevant information from associated evaluations that will \nbe  undertaken  under  the  Program  (such  as,  for  example,  that  on  NIS  and \nUNCAC implementation).  \n\n8. \n\nProgram Review \n\nADB, the Government, and development partners that cofinance the Program will jointly \n72. \nconduct  a  comprehensive  review  3  months  prior  to  the  scheduled  release  of  both  the  second \nand third tranche funds. There will be a final review at the end of the Program period. In the third \nyear  of  the  Program,  three  specific  independent  reviews  will  have  been  conducted  to  assess \nprogress  made  in  the  reform  agenda;  these  reviews  will  be  for  (i)  NIS  implementation  at  all \nlevels of government; (ii) an expert survey and national perception survey on the performance of \nUNCAC and anticorruption work; and (iii) an assessment of community outreach and corruption \nprevention  activities,  including  partnerships  of  anticorruption  agencies  with  civil  society.  All \nthese reviews will be done by an independent source, such as an NGO. \n\n\f21\n\n9. \n\nCorruption and Governance Risks \n\n73. \nCorruption  and  governance  risks  in  the  Program  can  be  categorized  as  (i)  related  to \nlegislation  and  policy  framework  (such  as  the  absence  of  a  right  to  information  act),  (ii) \nfor  example,  weak  prosecution  services),  or  (iii) \ninstitutional  arrangements  (such  as, \naccountability  and  transparency  (such  as  weak  grievance  redress  mechanisms  in  line \nministries).  The  severity  of  the  risks  vary  but  Type  I  risks  (i.e.,  risks  requiring  urgent  attention \nand  that  need  to  be  addressed  prior  to  any  assistance  being  rendered)  are  being  managed \npartly by ongoing ADB assistance in specific agencies such as the Anticorruption Commission \nand the CPA, and partly by engaging the Government to demonstrate\u2014and follow-through on\u2014\nits  political  commitment  to  institutional  and  long-term  reforms;  Government  commitment  does \nnot  appear  to  be  in  short  supply  in  the  country  at  the  moment.  (For  further  risk  analysis,  see \nAppendix 9 and Supplementary Appendix I.) \n\n74. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  as  well  as  the  Second \nGovernance and Corruption Action Plan was explained to, and discussed with, the Government \nand  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any allegedly \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Agreement \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n75. \nThe outcome of the technical assistance (TA) program is to enhance the capacity of the \nGovernment to effectively implement the Good Governance Program.45 This includes engaging \ncivil  society  more  actively  for  advocacy  purposes  and  to  raise  public  awareness  on  good \ngovernance  and  how  anticorruption  measures  can  be  supported  at  the  grassroots  level.  This \ncomponent of the Program provides assistance to develop the capacity of the EAs to manage \nthe Program and its activities.  \n\n76. \nSupport  is  also  to  be  provided  to  implementing  agencies  to  enable  them  to  attain  the \npolicy  reforms  and  actions  that  are  specified  in  the  Policy  Matrix.  In  particular,  technical \nassistance  support  will  be  provided  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  legal,  judicial,  and  institutional \ndevelopment work; (ii) automation; (iii) Program management; (iv) staff capacity enhancement; \n\n                                                \n45 The technical assistance to be provided by ADB is to be complemented by other development partners in various \nareas  related  to  governance  and  anticorruption.  The  European  Union  has  agreed  to  conduct  an  appraisal  for \nfinancing for \u20ac10 million for application of the 2004 Birth and Death Registration Act and its implementing rules as \nan associated intervention under the overall Good Governance Program. The United Nations Office of Drugs and \nCrime is considering providing approximately $1.5 million in support of the implementation of the UNCAC as well \nas  the  alignment  between  the  UNCAC  and  the  Anticorruption  Commission  Act  of  2004.  The  World  Bank  is \nconsidering  provision  of  financing  approximately  $2.5  million  to  develop  the  investigative  capability  of  the \nAnticorruption  Commission  in  line  with  the  outcomes  sought  under  this  Program.  Similarly.  the  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  has  expressed  an  interest  in  financing  approximately  $175,000  to support  the \nJSC  and  work  on  strengthening  the  judiciary.  The  Commonwealth  Secretariat  is  considering  providing  about \n$50,000 to support the Anticorruption Commission in the area of performance management within the commission; \nand a consortium of bilateral development partners (notably Canadian International Development Agency, Danish \nInternational  Development  Assistance  [DANIDA],  and  the  Government  of  Australia)  is  providing  short-term \ntechnical  support  (approximately  $0.5m)  to  the  Anticorruption  Commission  to  strengthen  various  aspects  of  its \noperations,  including  strategic  planning  and  operations,  information  technology,  physical  resource  requirements, \nand drawing of lessons from different jurisdictions. \n\n\f22\n\n(v)  organizational  performance;  and  (vi)  strengthening  aid  governance  management  in  central \nGovernment (a critical area to ensure that the Program is implemented effectively). Support for \nany  advance  procurement  that  needs  to  be  done  for  both  the  EAs  will  be  provided  by  the  TA \nprogram (see Appendix 6). \n\n77. \nThe  TA  program  will  commence  in  October  2007  and  end  in  September  2011.  It  will \nrequire a total of 11 person-months of international consulting services and 227 person-months \nof  national  consulting  services.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  individual  selection \nmethod,  least  cost  selection,  fixed  budget,  and  quality-based  selection  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n\n78. \n\nThe total TA program cost is estimated at $3.00 million, of which: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n$1.50  million  will  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  through  its  technical \nassistance funding program; \n$1 million will be provided by Government of Denmark on a grant basis to build \ncapability  within  the  Anticorruption  Commission  and  to  publicize  the  NIS  across \nBangladesh;46 and \n$0.5  million  will  be  contributed  by  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  in  kind  and \ncash as counterpart staff, office accommodation, and logistical support. \n\n79. \nThe detailed cost estimates and a financing plan for the TA program are in Appendix 8 \n(further details are provided in Supplementary Appendix H). The Cabinet Division will be the EA \nfor the TA program, which will be implemented over a period 48 months, commencing from the \ndate of Program loan effectiveness; the consulting services will be delivered intermittently over \nthe TA program implementation period. \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Benefits \n\n80. \nThe Program loan will help improve the capability of the Government of Bangladesh to \nbetter fight the corruption problem in the country, and, in the medium term, institute a system of \ngood  governance  upon  which  a  strong  basis  for  more  rapid  and  inclusive  growth  can  be \nestablished.  This,  in  turn,  is  expected  to  directly  contribute  to  a  situation  where  foreign  direct \ninvestments, and other associated benefits, will be evident. Specific benefits of the Program can \nbe outlined as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA  broad  and  long-term  vision  of  good  governance  and  anticorruption  that  is \naligned to the UNCAC, and is values-based. \nStrengthening  of  the  role  of  an  independent  judiciary  in  not  only  fighting \ncorruption  but  also  serving  as  an  effective  check  on  the  excesses  of  the \nExecutive.\nSubstantial strengthening of the Anticorruption Commission in enforcing relevant \nlaws  and  curbing  corruption,  and  over  time  beginning  to  exert  its  statutory \nindependence  on  the  basis  of  public  trust  and  credibility  that  it  will  be  able  to \ngenerate as a result of effective performance. \n\n                                                \n46 This  assistance  by  the  Government  of  Denmark  will  be  provided  from  its  Human  Rights  and  Good  Governance \n\nProgram, Phase II, which is effective until December 2010.  \n\n\f23\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nto  be  more \n\ninstituting \nEncouragement  of  sectoral  agencies \nanticorruption  and  good-governance  initiatives  and  actions  so  as  to  minimize \nvulnerabilities to corruption in the public sector.  \nThe establishment of a strong legal framework and practical measures to provide \ngreater  opportunities  of  redress  for  citizens,  which,  in  turn,  will  serve  as  a \nsignificant source of demand-driven pressures for good governance in the public \nsector.\n\ninvolved \n\nin \n\nAs  the  Program  seeks  to  contribute  to  the  overall  agenda  on  good  governance  in  the \n81. \ncountry, the entire public will benefit from it. This will be evident in areas such as lower levels of \nservice costs and better services. There is also empirical evidence to show that women have to \npay more in bribes than men, that women have to wait longer than men to see officials, and that \nwhen  they  do  they  are  three  times  more  likely  to  be  \u201cqueue-jumped\u201d  than  men.  This  support \nproposed  here  will  play  a  role  (albeit  an  indirect  one)  in  minimizing  the  negative  impact  of \ncorruption on women and other marginalized populations in Bangladesh. (A summary social and \npoverty analysis is presented in Appendix 10.) \n\n82. \nThe  key  socioeconomic  issues  that  are  evident  deal  with  the  adverse  impacts  of \ncorruption and mismanagement of public resources on the economy as a whole and on the lives \nof  the  citizens  (largely  through  poor  service  delivery  and  greater  costs of  accessing  services). \nWhile rent seeking cannot be entirely eliminated in any system, the Program attempts to reduce \nthe  incidence  of  corruption  by  strengthening  not  only  preventive  measures  but  also  measures \nassociated with enforcement and sanctions. These will have positive economic as well as social \nbenefits, including more efficient and effective service delivery, and a greater level of public trust \nin the Government in the medium to long term.\n\nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nPolitical  Commitment.  The  Program\u2019s  success  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s \n83.\ncontinuing  strong  commitment  to  governance  reforms  in  general  and,  more  specifically,  to \nsuccessfully  countering  the  corruption  problem.  There  is  a  risk  that  current  measures  and \nreform  efforts  may  not  be  sustained  by  a  future  government.  This  risk  may  be  mitigated  by \ncontinued policy dialogue not only  with Government but also with other stakeholders (such as \nthe  judiciary,  civil  society,  and  even  development  partners)  to  maintain  pressure  on  the \ngovernment of the day. The Program also targets reforms that are in the public interest, hence \nattempts  at  reversal  by  future  governments  will  be  more  difficult.  The  Election  Commission  is \nkeen to fundamentally reform the political party process, a major source of corruption and abuse \nof authority; if successful, this will mitigate the risk of reform reversal and will also mean that the \nProgram outcomes and impact will be easier to achieve.  \n\nThe  assumptions  inherent  in  the  Program  are  that  (i)  Government  commitment  to \n84. \nreforms  across  the  various  sectors  (including  for  the  Anticorruption  Commission)  will  remain \nhigh, (ii) the political system is stable during the implementation period, (iii) the separation of the \njudiciary  from  the  Executive  will  be  formally  completed  in  the  very  near  future,  and  (iv) \nthese \ndevelopment  partners\u2014singly  and \nassumptions  have  remained  valid  during  Program  processing,  and  are  expected  to  be  so  at \nleast until early 2009 when an elected government is expected to be in place. \n\njointly\u2014remain  engaged \n\nthe  Program.  All \n\nin \n\n85. \n\nThree other risk areas that could arise in the Program include the following: \n\n(i)\n\nInstitutional  capacity.  The  Program  may  place  some  demands  on  the \ninstitutional  capacities  of  Government  agencies \nthat  are  executing  and \nimplementing  it.  While  this  is  not  expected  to  be  substantial  in  many  instances \n\n\f24\n\n(since  much  of  the  reform  work  reflected  in  the  Program  is  already  underway), \nclose performance monitoring and targeted technical assistance to the two EAs \nand  all  implementing  agencies  will  help  reduce  any  adverse  effects  of \nimplementation delays due to capacity constraints. \nEnabling  conditions.  The  enabling  conditions  for  the  Program  that  are  in \nevidence at the moment may not exist after an elected government takes over as \nexpected in early 2009. This risk can be mitigated by ensuring that the leadership \nin  the  various  agencies  that  are  a  part  of  the  Program  is  suitably  engaged  in \nProgram  design  to  ensure  continued  commitment.  The  extensive  process  of \nconsultations within the bureaucracy, and at the top political leadership level itself, \nto get commitment to the NIS is designed to directly address this risk. \nFiduciary risks. Fiduciary risks in the Program could be reflected in two specific \nways, and mitigating measures for them are as follows: \n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nExpenditure  of  funds  not  for  the  purpose  intended.  While  this  is  a \ngeneric  risk  in  any  program  loan,  for  the  purposes  of  this  Program  the \nfollowing two risk mitigating measures will be in place. \n(1) \n\nThe  Loan  Agreement  will  specify  arrangements  to  ensure  that \nfunds  are  spent  for  the  purposes  for  which  they  have  been  set \naside.\nQuarterly  reporting  arrangements  are  built  into  the  assurances \nthat Government will give to ADB as per the Loan Agreement. \n\n(2) \n\ninvolved \n\nFinancial  sustainability  of  agencies \nin  the  Program. \nAssurances  have  been  sought  from  Government  that  counterpart  funds \nwill be made available for program delivery, and that they will be spent for \nprogram-specific  outputs.  Further,  while  some  agencies  such  as  the \nAnticorruption  Commission  have  already  been  assured  of  increased \nfunding from the Government, it has also given assurances that the same \nwill  be  the  case  for  others,  such  as  the  judiciary.  Regular  monitoring  of \nthis commitment will be done as part of program implementation. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n86. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPolicies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, as \ndescribed in the Development Policy Letter, will continue in effect for the duration \nof the Program period and subsequently. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  made  available  to  meet  the  financial \nrequirements  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  Program;  throughout \nProgram implementation, adequate allocation of the required counterpart funds47\n\n                                                \n47 These counterpart funds will be for, but not limited to, (i) the implementation of the NIS and UNCAC at all levels; (ii) \nthe  operations  of  the  Anticorruption  Commission  at  the  central,  regional,  and  district  levels;  (iii)  the  separation  of \nthe  judiciary  from  the  Executive,  including  costs  for  capital  expenditures  flowing  from  such  separation;  (iv)  the \nimplementation of the approved recommendations of the Judicial Service Pay Commission; (v) the establishment \nand  operation  of  independent  prosecution  services;  (vi)  implementation  of  grievance  handling  mechanisms, \nincluding citizen report cards and office of the ombudsman; (vii) the operation of the JSC, and the Judicial Service \nPay  Commission;  and  (viii)  other  reforms,  including  any  performance  incentive  schemes  and  human-resource \nplans  developed  under  the  Program,  reforms  at  the  CPA,  and  independent  surveys  on  program-related \ninterventions. Any counterpart funds not required for the Program will be used for good governance interventions in \nBangladesh. \n\n\f25\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nare  made,  approved,  and  released  in  a  timely  manner  to  ensure  proper \nimplementation of the Program.  \nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  Program,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to \ncomment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  Government  will  take  into \naccount ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and implementing any such proposals. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  implementing  agencies  are  adequately \nstaffed and provided with the necessary financial, technical, and other resources, \nincluding equipment, to perform their functions under the Program. \n\n(v)  Within  two  months  of  the  approval  of  the  NIS,  the  Government  will  establish  a \nbroad-based  and  independent  high  level  National  Integrity  Advisory  Committee \nwith a mandate to guide NIS implementation.  \n\n(ix) \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi)  Within 6 months of the approval of the NIS, and every 6  months thereafter, the \nCabinet Division will submit reports on the progress of NIS implementation at all \nlevels.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  in  developing  any  automation  networks,  all \nmeasures will be taken to guarantee full respect of privacy of information. \n(viii)  The Government will not intervene, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of policies \nor  actions  of  the  courts,  particularly  regarding  their  organizational  structure, \nrecruitment  of  personnel,  or  actions  regarding  their  management,  operational, \nand  financial  activities.  The  Government  will  refrain  from  taking  any  action, \ndirectly or indirectly, that inhibits, curbs, or otherwise limits the independence of \nthe judiciary. \nThe  Government  will  establish  a  budget  tracking  system  to  track  the  use  of the \ncounterpart funds generated by the loan on a quarterly basis. \nFunds  for  performance  management  schemes  will  only  be  allocated  if  such \nscheme is part of a wider human resources development plan that includes: (a) \nkey  job  descriptions  with  performance  targets;  and  (b)  provisions  for  career \ndevelopment. \nFor  the  recruitment  of  new  staff  as  a  result  of  the  Program,  including  judges, \ninvestigators  and  prosecutors,  all  measures  will  be  taken  to  attract  female \ncandidates. Equally qualified women will be given preference. \nThe Government will ensure that for any physical infrastructure built as a result of \nthe Program, the relevant Executing and Implementing Agencies will comply with: \n(a)  Bangladesh\u2019s \n(b) \nBangladesh  laws  and  regulations  regarding  environment;  (c)  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995); and (d) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Prior \nto any construction, the relevant permits and licenses will be obtained.  \n\nregulations  governing \n\nland  acquisition; \n\nlaws  and \n\n(xii) \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  action  plans  to  be  prepared  as  part  of  the \nProgram  will  be  fully  implemented  before  the  end  of  the  Program  and  that  all \nlegislation gazetted will have become fully effective. \n\n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that all legislation passed as part of the Program as \nwell as all public awareness campaigns and action plans will be widely published \nin a way that ensures access by all segments of the population. \n\n\f26\n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following conditions will be met before the loan becomes effective: (i) the PMUs will \n\n87. \nhave been established; and (ii) the Program Steering Committee will have been established.\n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n88. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 97,910,000 to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Good  Governance  Program  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board; and \nthe provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 \nto the Government of Bangladesh for supporting the Good Governance Program. \n\n5 October 2007 \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n\fAppendix 1\n\n27\n\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nMeasures of satisfaction of \npublic access to services show \nyearly increase. \nContribution to economic \ngrowth by sectors most \nvulnerable to corruption shows \nyearly increases.  \nPublic perception of good \ngovernance in relevant sectors \nof operations improves in all \nsurveys.  \n\nImproved Transparency \nInternational ranking on \ncorruption (from current CPI \nscore of 2.0 to 2.5 by 2011). \n\nDemonstrated Government \ncommitment to implementation \nof the NIS and UNCAC \nprovisions through increased \nbudgetary allocations. \n\nCabinet Division and office of \nthe registrar (Supreme Court) \nbetter able to manage good \ngovernance projects \nthroughout the public sector \nNIS is adopted by departments \nresulting in better management \nof grievance processes and \nuse of resources, as verified by \nauditor general\u2019s report. \nAnticorruption Commission Act \nof 2004 amended to give \nAnticorruption Commission \nclearer powers and greater \nindependence.  \nYearly increase in corruption \ncases investigated and \nprosecuted by Anticorruption \nCommission.\nAll judicial sector appointments \nand personnel matters \nunbundled from the PSC. \nYearly reduction in time taken \nto resolve corruption cases.  \nCode of conduct adhered to, \nand monitored, at the Supreme \nCourt and in district courts. \nAll departments have fully \noperational accountability \nmechanisms or units.\n\nData\nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms a\n\nRelevant national \nsurveys on public \nservice delivery \nGovernment\u2019s periodic \neconomic reports and \nbudgets \n\nEvaluation reports;

Indeed,  in  the \npublic sector, personal greed has always tended to be placed above public interests, which has \nled the country to the edge of failed statehood.1\n\nB. \n\nNature of the Governance Problem \n\n1. \n\nProblem of Corruption \n\n3. \nCorruption  has  been  the  most  telling  indicator of  poor  governance  in Bangladesh  for  a \nlong  time  (see  tables  1  and  2  below).  According  to  Transparency  International,  corruption  in \nBangladesh was perceived to be the highest in the world for five successive years from 2001; its \nranking for freedom from corruption in relation to other such freedoms is also extremely low. Its \nperformance  in  terms  of  selected  governance  indicators  has  also  shown  no  significant \nimprovement over time.2\n\nTable A2.1: Economic Freedoms in Bangladesh \n\n    \n\nTable A2.2: Ranking for Bangladesh in \nTransparency International\u2019s \nCorruption Perception Index \n\nYear \n2001 \n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n\nCPI Index  Rank/Countries \nLast/91 \n     0.4 \nLast/102 \n     1.2 \nLast/133 \n     1.3 \nLast/145 \n     1.5 \nLast/158 \n     1.7 \n156th/163\n     2.0 \nSource: Transparency International \n(Available: \nhttp://www.transparency.org/policy_researc\nh/surveys_indices/global/cpi)\n\nNote: The trend in \u2018freedom from corruption index\u2019 has been \na paltry score of 4 in 2003 to 15 in 2006, which is still very low. \nSource: The Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom, 2007 \n(Available: http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/country.cfm?id=Bangladesh) \nFdm fm: Freedom from. \n\n                                                \n1  Bangladesh  has  been  rated  as  one  of  the  top  20  states  in  the  world  most  at  risk  of  failure.  See  Foreign  Policy.\n\n2006. The Failed States Index. May/June. \n\n2 For example, in 2002\u20132005, values for control of corruption diminished from 13.7 to 7.9, and for rule of law from \n25.5  to  19.8.  (Source:  D  Kaufmann,  A  Kraay,  and  M  Mastruzzi.  2006.  Governance  Matters  V:  Governance \nIndicators for 1996\u20132005. Washington, DC.) \n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n33\n\n \n\n2. \n\nJudicial Autonomy and Transparency \n\n4. \nThere is consensus that much more work on good governance can be done in the police \nforce and the judiciary, two critical institutions in Bangladesh.3 The problem stems largely due to \npolitical interference in recruitment and management of these institutions. An upcoming study4\non  the  justice  sector  in  Bangladesh  states  that  the  core  institutions  of  formal  justice  lack \nindependence, and that formal legal mechanisms for holding government and other participants \nto  account  have  also  been  severely  undermined,  particularly  by  recent  processes  of \npoliticization  across  the spectrum.  Above  all,  it  emerges  that  the  single  greatest  source  of  the \njustice sector\u2019s problems is the lack of independence of the judiciary from the Executive, and the \nlevel of politicization has so hampered the effective delivery of judicial services that poor people \nhave effectively been priced out of the market in getting justice. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nVoice Mechanisms for Citizens \n\n5. \nThere  is  less  attention  paid  to  this  particular  problem  of  the  good-governance  agenda. \nThe media and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have indeed provided the opportunity for \ncitizens to voice their concerns regarding mismanagement and poor service delivery, but what is \nmissing  is  an  institutional  and  formalized  mechanism  to  convey  bottom-up  concerns  of \ncorruption  to  policy  makers.  This  is  evident  at  two  levels:  (i)  for  the  common  citizen  who  has \nbeen  deprived  of  the  right  to  receive  services  in  an  equitable,  efficient,  and  effective  manner; \nand  (ii)  for  the  departmental  employee  who  is  not  empowered  to  either  blow  the  whistle  or \nchannel relevant feedback to the upper hierarchy. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nPublic Service Reforms \n\n6. \nDespite  public  sector  reform  efforts,  the  civil  service  remains  relatively  ineffective  and \nunaccountable,  and  lacks  proper  motivation  due  to  a  weak  incentive  system.  The  highly \ncentralized  political  and  administrative  system  weakens  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  deliver \nand monitor services effectively. The Public Service Commission (PSC)\u2014the body responsible \nfor  recruitment  into  the  Bangladesh  civil  service\u2014itself  is  politicized  and  has  been  accused  of \ncorruption and a lack of transparency.5\n\nC. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Response to Enhance Good Governance \n\n7. \nEfforts  are  currently  underway  to  improve  core  governance  systems  in  areas  such  as \npublic  procurement,  financial  management,  fiscal  reporting, and  watchdog  institutions.  Several \n                                                \n3  According to the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) corruption database for 2004 and 2005, the police \ntopped  the  most  corrupt  list.  The  police  also  routinely  come  in  last  in  all  opinion  polls  and  attitudinal  surveys  on \nperceptions of corruption. This is corroborated by a 2006 survey in which 67.3% of respondents said they have no \ntrust in the police and feel that the police sector is the most corrupt (Power Participation Research Centre. 2007. \nUnbundling Governance: Reforms, Processes, Institutions, and Risks. Dhaka [April]). In the judiciary, the problem \nis primarily evident at the district court level where \u201cwidespread \u2026 malpractices delay and deny access to justice \nfor  many\u201d  (European  Commission  Justice  Identification  Mission.  2005.  Activating  the  Justice  System  in \nBangladesh:  Final  Report.  Dhaka  [November]). There  is  also  a  view  that  poor  terms  and  conditions  of  service  at \nthe subordinate court level directly contribute to the problem. The European Commission report notes that a large \npart  of  this  is  because  income  to  the  Treasury  generated  by  the  courts  amounts  to  2.5  times  the  annual  budget \nprovided to the operational running of the justice system. \n\n4  Bangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee.  2007.  The  Prospects  for  Justice  Sector  Reforms  in  Bangladesh. \n\nForthcoming. January. \n\n5  See,  for  example,  The  Daily  News.  2007.  Probe  corruption  in  PSC,  bring  culprits  to  book:  Speakers  tell  TIB \nroundtable.  Dhaka.  Friday,  23  March.  There  are  also  charges  against  the  Public  Service  Commission  (PSC)  of \ntampering with recruitment processes for entry into the civil service. \n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nreforms  to  improve  sectoral  governance  are  also  underway.  One  in  particular  that  will  prove \ncritical  for  economic  activity  and  international  trade  for  Bangladesh  is  the  governance  reform \ncurrently  underway  at  the  Chittagong  Port  Authority  (CPA).  This  port  handles  85%  of  all  the \ncountry\u2019s  trade  but  infrastructural  weaknesses,  bureaucracy,  and  administrative  red  tape  has \nresulted in it being considered \u201cthe most expensive port in the region\u201d.6 The CPA has recently \nintroduced measures that will not only speed up port operations through a single point operating \nsystem but will also protect importers from the harassment and financial losses they suffer in the \nstevedoring system.\n\n8. \n In the area of public administration, reforms have included improvement of a promotion \npolicy  for  Class  I  officers  (with  an  emphasis  on  merit),  an  improved  training  policy  for \nGovernment employees, and the creation of a career planning and training wing in the Ministry \nof Establishment. To improve public financial management, the Government in FY2005 issued \nnew  annual  budget  guidelines  on  a  pilot  basis.  These  contained  elements  of  more  strategic \nbudgeting  practices,  better  fiscal  discipline,  and  better  coordination  of  recurrent  and  capital \nbudgets. In order to be able to monitor progress against established benchmarks over time, the \nGovernment has undertaken expenditure tracking surveys in the health and education sectors \nto  ascertain  the  effectiveness  of  service  delivery.  Furthermore,  the  Government  has  recently \nreleased a comprehensive Public Financial Management Action Plan. \n\nThe Government has now also formulated the Money Laundering Prevention Ordinance \n9. \n2007,  which  will  facilitate  the  work  of  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Department  within  the \nBangladesh  Bank.  The  US  is  helping  establish  a  financial  intelligence  unit  to  combat  financial \ncrimes and retrieve assets kept overseas by graft suspects. Though set up in 2003 in line with \nthe anti-money laundering law enacted in 2002, the Anti-Money Laundering Department was not \nable  to  do  its  work  effectively.  With  this  ordinance,  the  Bangladesh  Bank  can  work  with  other \ncountries on financial crime investigation, and exchange information and expertise with financial \nintelligence units of other countries.7\n\n10. \nThe Supreme Court has now accepted the four rules on independent judicial service and \nthe  amended  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  (Amendment)  Ordinance,  legislated  by  the \nGovernment  to  separate  judicial  service,  including  the  judicial  magistracy,  from  government \ncontrol  in  compliance  with  its  12-point  directive  for  eventual  separation  of  the  judiciary.  The \ninterim  government,  taking  the  final  legislative  step  towards  separation  of  the  judiciary, \namended  the  Judicial  Service  Pay  Commission  Rules  2007  in  late  April  2007.  The  new  rules \nstipulate  that  existing  magistrates  who  have  opted  for  the  judiciary  will  be  absorbed  into  the \njudicial service for 3 years so that a sufficient number of officers can be appointed to the judicial \n\n                                                \n6  It  is  also  considered  the  most  inefficient:  the  number  of  days  waiting  for  operations  in  Chittagong  Port  is  10  as \nopposed  to  less  than  a  day  for  all  other  comparable  country  ports;  similarly,  Chittagong  Port  handles  only  5.2 \ncontainers per hour whereas other comparable ports handle 40\u201376. (Fixing our ports and beyond. The Daily Star.\n2007. Dhaka. Monday, 23 April.) \n\n7  This is an important aspect of anticorruption work and has the potential to substantially bolster the Government\u2019s \nfiscal  position.  For  the  first  time  in  its  history,  in  April  2007  the  Government  was  able  to  retrieve  Tk  2.7  billion  of \nillegal money from seven businessmen, and is expecting to recover around Tk3.0 billion more soon, much of which \nwas  illegally  transferred  abroad.  The  Bangladesh  Bank  reiterates  this  point  by  saying  that  the  anti-money \nlaundering  and  anticorruption  drives  by  the  Government  and  the  move  by  the  National  Board  of  Revenue  to \nexpand  the  tax  net  are  expected  to  yield  positive  results  in  terms  of  revenue  gains  for  the  Government.  On  the \nother hand, anticorruption drives have also had an indirect negative effect: e.g., car sales dropped 50% in the first \n3  months  of  2007  for  fear  of  problems  (The  Daily  Star,  Saturday,  24  March  2007);  similarly,  credit  and  deposit \ngrowth  of  commercial  banks  fell  \u201cdrastically\u201d  in  the  first  quarter  of  2007  (by  up  to  six  to  eight  times  of  that  in \nprevious periods) as the joint forces and the National Board of Revenue have been checking bank accounts as part \nof the anticorruption crackdown (The Daily Star. 2007. Dhaka, Tuesday, 15 May).  \n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n35\n\nservice in this interim period. According to the report submitted by the Government in April, only \n31 existing magistrates have opted for being absorbed into the judicial service. As of the end of \nFebruary  2007,  484,832  cases  are  pending  with  the  courts  of  magistrates  across  the  country \nand  at  least  890  magistrates  are  required  to  deal  with  them.  None  of  the  metropolitan \nmagistrates, however, have so far opted for absorption into the judicial service. As of the end of \nFebruary 2007, 112,772 cases are pending with the courts of the metropolitan magistrates and \nat least 52 magistrates are needed to deal with them. \n\nThe  Government  wishes  to  implement  the  separation  of  the  judiciary  at  the  earliest \n11. \nopportunity,  including  (i)  the  streamlining  of  recruitment  of  judges, 8 (ii)  independent  judicial \nadministration  and  management  through  the  Supreme  Court,  (iii)  special  pay  package  for  the \njudges,  (iv)  court  reforms  (particularly  caseload  management  and  modernization  of  systems), \nand  (v)  permanent  and  neutral  prosecution  services.  The  ordinance,  which  proposes  100 \namendments  to  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  1898,  strips  the  executive  magistrates \n(including deputy commissioners) of judicial powers and functions. \n\nOther  steps  the  Government  is  taking  or  considering  to  institute  good  governance \n12. \ninclude  (i)  a  consumer  protection  law,  which  should  have  an  indirect  impact  on  curbing \ncorruption since consumers would have greater rights to demand, and receive, better services; \n(ii) corporatization of several state-owned enterprises and nationalized commercial banks, which \nwill  ensure  that  government  patronage  in  these  organizations  will  diminish  and  market \npressures  will  assist  them  to  provide  better  services;  (iii)  a  website  to  receive  corruption \ncomplaints; 9  (iv)  in  April  2007  the  Government  revisiting  the  Members  of  Parliament \n(Remuneration  and  Allowances)  Act  1973  and  rescinding  the  privilege  of  members  of \nParliament to import of cars free of duty, a privilege that had been hugely abused in the past;10\nand (v) effective implementation of the Public Procurement Act 2006.11\n\nFinally, the Government has embarked on the following courses to tackle the corruption \n\n13. \nproblem.\n\n(i)\n\nStronger  enforcement  for  short-circuiting  the  culture  of  impunity.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  substantially  revamp  the  Anticorruption  Commission \n(supported  by  the  National  Coordination  Committee  on  Combating  Corruption \nand  Crime  [NCC]) 12  so  that  it  can  carry  out  its  work  more  effectively.  This, \ncoupled with several arrests of known and suspected corrupt officials, has meant \nthat  for  the  first  time  there  is  an  opportunity  for  the  culture  of  impunity  to  be \nsubstantially targeted. \n\n                                                \n8  This is a critical issue; the chief justice himself has publicly stated that the irregularities in appointment of judges in \n\nthe past will \u201cneed at least 20 years to remove\u201d (The Daily Star. 2007. Dhaka. 30 April). \n\n9  This is available at: www.ekhoni-shomoy.net. \n10 For example, it has been reported that during the period October 2001 to October 2006, a total of 303 expensive \nand luxury cars or jeeps were imported free of duty, costing the Government revenues amounting to Tk2.11 billion \n(The News Today. 2007. Dhaka. Tuesday, 17 April). \n\n11 While  the  act  is  a  very  useful  tool,  contract  awards  provide  opportunities  for  procurement,  and  political  influence \nand  pressure  from  trade  unions  in  the  procurement  process  compound  the  problem.  The  World  Bank  recently \ncompleted  an  assessment  of  procurement  practices  in  Bangladesh  and  concluded  that  the  implementation  of \nprocurement is very uneven across agencies, and barring some exceptions, the process is far from satisfactory. \n12  Having  said  this,  the  fact  that  there  are  at  present  40  task  forces  led  by  the  NCC  and  the  Anticorruption \nCommission mean that anticorruption work has a substantial coordination problem (The Daily Star. 2007. Dhaka. \nFriday, 20 April). \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nTaking a broad and long-term vision of anticorruption. Both the Government \nand  civil  society  have  forcefully  highlighted  the  corruption  issue,  and  there  is  a \nrising  expectation  among  the  public  that  the  Government  will  not  only  begin  to \nenforce and sanction corrupt officials but also put in place mechanisms that will \ndeter  the  type  of  massive  corruption  that  has  been  the  hallmark  of  public life in \nBangladesh.  The  Government  has  talked  about  the  need  for  an  institutional \nframework  (led  by  the  Anticorruption  Commission  but  including  other  agencies, \nsuch as the National Board of Revenue) that will begin to address the problem in \na  concerted  manner  and  with  a  long-term  vision,  strategy,  and  achievement  of \nanticorruption  outcomes  across  sectors,  institutions,  and  levels  of  government. \nThe substantive basis of this vision is emerging in the Government\u2019s decision in \nMarch 2007 to ratify the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). \nSupplementary Appendix B has more information on the UNCAC. \n\nthe  Anticorruption  Commission.  Already \n\nStrengthening \nthree  new \ncommissioners  have  been  appointed,  all  with  the  requisite  experience  and \ntechnical competencies. The change at the top has given the commission greater \nvisibility and raised public confidence that past practices will no longer apply. As \nfor  staffing,  the  Government  has  finalized  the  amendments  to  the  existing \norganization structure (or organogram) of the Anticorruption Commission raising \nthe  number  of  its  staff  from  650  to  1,257,  and  the  commission  has  been  given \ngreater powers to pursue, investigate, and prosecute the corrupt.  \n\nStrengthening the role of the judiciary in anticorruption. As noted earlier, the \nGovernment  has  already  accepted  the  Supreme  Court\u2019s  2000  decision  to \nseparate  the  judiciary  from  the  Executive  at  the  district  level.  Ensuring  the \nindependence  of  the  judiciary  implies  that  at  the  very  least  there  is  no \ngovernment interference in the appointment of judges, and that the judges have \nsecurity of tenure (thus minimizing the opportunities for interference), security of \nsalary  and  remuneration,  and  there  is  institutional  independence  of  the \nsubordinate judiciary especially from Parliament and the Government. \n\nBringing good governance into the mainstream at sector level. Striking gaps \nin Bangladesh at the moment are (a) the absence of focus on, and application of, \nanticorruption  measures  at  the  sectoral  level;  and  (b)  the  absence  of  any \nmeasures  to  reduce  citizens\u2019  vulnerability  to  corruption.  This  is  evident  in  (a) \ninternal  processes  in  sectoral  agencies  that  need  to  be  upgraded  or  rigorously \nenforced;  and  (b)  the  identification  of  key  interventions  that  will  provide  an \nenabling environment for citizen access and participation in preventing corruption. \nFor  instance,  the  right  to  information  is  a  critical  requirement  to  enhance \ntransparency of government decisions but the legal framework for the exercise of \nthis  right  does  not  yet  exist.  Such  enabling  features  are  essential  to  strengthen \nthe anticorruption drive in Bangladesh. \n\nIn  summary,  the  Government  commitment  to  make  much-needed  reforms  in  the \n14. \ngovernance  sector  is  most  evident  in  (i)  its  strong  support  for  the  work  of  the  Anticorruption \nCommission, (ii) separating the judiciary from the Executive, (iii) beginning to address systemic \nweaknesses  in  the  management  of  the  civil  service,  and  (iv)  seeking  to  improve  sectoral \ngovernance. These are also the focus areas of the Good Governance Program.\n\n\fDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX  \n(Major Donors and Relevant Governance Areas) \n\nAreas of Coverage/Objectives \n\nArea of \nProgram/Project \nDanish International Development Assistance (DANIDA)\nPart of Legal and \nJudicial Capacity \nBuilding Project  \nPreparatory phase of \nthe ombudsman \ninstitution  \nLocal Governance \nSupport Project  \n\nCapacity building of the Judicial Administration Training \nInstitute.\n\nActivities in preparation for setting up an ombudsman. \n\nPerformance based block grants, capacity development, \nresearch and studies under the learning and innovation \ncomponent. \nElectronic governance (E-governance) support, training. \n\nSeparation of judiciary including support to the Supreme \nCourt.\n\nStrengthening of \nParliament \nJudiciary support \n\nDepartment for International Development (DFID), UK\nTIB Making Waves \nProject\n\nHuman Rights and \nGovernance Fund \n(Manusher Jonno \nProject)\nFinancial \nManagement Reform \nProject\n\nPublic service \ncapacity building \nprogram (Managing \nat the top [MATT]) \nPolice Reform \nProgram\n\nIncreased demand by men and women for transparency in \npublic, nonprofit, and private-sector transactions.

The outcome of the TA is to enhance the \ncapacity of the Government to effectively implement the Program. Its impact can be measured \nonly in association with the attainment of the objectives of the Program itself (see Appendix 1). \n\nThe TA contributes to the attainment of the outcome and outputs of the Program; these \n\n2. \ncan be specified as follows: \n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nOutcome:  Improved  governance  in  the  public  sector,  through  training \nprograms  on  various  Program-related  interventions,  strengthened  Program \nManagement Units and Program Steering Committee, and action plans designed \nto  assist  selected  agencies  (such  as  the  two  Executing  Agencies)  to  meet \nProgram objectives.  \nOutput 1: Vision, strategy, and procedures, through a strengthened ACC Act \naligned  to  the  UNCAC  provisions,  and  a  well-prepared  and  well-publicized \nNational Integrity Strategy. \nOutput  2:  Enforcement  and  sanctions  mechanisms, through monitoring and \nreporting  protocols  at  the  Supreme  Court,  an  effective  decentralized  system  of \noperations in anticorruption, and performance management schemes in agencies \nsuch as the ACC. \nOutput 3: Prevention mechanisms, through legislative instruments such as the \nRight to Information Act and Whistleblower Protection Act, improved examination \nand  revised  quota  system  in  the  Bangladesh  Civil  Service,  and  corruption  risk \nmitigation plans and grievance handling mechanisms in Government agencies. \n\n3. \nFor proper management of the TA, a procurement plan is prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and the Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  This  plan  is  comprised  of  the \nfollowing:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nthe  particular  contracts  for  the  goods  (equipment,  technology),  consulting \nservices,  and  training  services  required  to  carry  out  the  Program  during  the \nProgram period; \nthe  proposed  methods  for  procurement  of  such  contracts  that  are  permitted \nunder the Loan Agreement; \nfor  consulting  services  packages,  this  plan  covers  the  proposed  methods  for \nselection  and  type  of  proposal,  and  an  indicative  recruitment  schedule  and \nbudget; and \nrelated ADB review procedures (see below). \n\nB. \n\nProcurement Plan Reviews \n\n4. \nADB  will  review  the  procurement  arrangements  in  the  procurement  plan  for  its \nconformity with the Loan Agreement and the relevant guidelines mentioned in para. 3. While this \nprocurement plan initially covers the entire 4 years of the Program period, the procurement plan \n\n\fwill be updated on an annual basis or as needed, always covering the next 18-month period of \nProgram implementation. \n\nTable A6.1: Program Information \n\nBangladesh \nGovernment of Bangladesh \nGood Governance Program \nProgram Loan \nOctober 2007 \n2.35 million \n \nCabinet Division \nJune 2007 \nSee above \nAugust 2007 \nOctober 2007\u2013September 2011 \n\n52\n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nProcurement Plan\n\nCountry \nName of Borrower \nProgram Name \nLoan or TA Reference \nDate of Effectiveness \nAmount ($) \nOf which Committed ($) \nExecuting Agency \nApproval Date of Original Procurement Plan \nApproval of most recent Procurement Plan \nPublication for Local Advertisements\nPeriod Covered by this Plan \nTA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nProcurement Method\n\nICB Works (none) \nICB Goods  \nNCB Goods (12e) \nShopping Goods (1e, 2e, 6e, 9e, 11e, 14e, 15e) \nDirect Purchase (none) \nExceptional Methods \n\nD. \n\nProcurement Thresholds for Goods and Related Services\n\nTable A6.2: Procurement Thresholds for Good and Related Servicesa\n\nValue\n\nOver $1,000,000 \n Over $500,000  \nOver $100,000 \n Over $5,000 \nUp to $5,000 \n\nValue\n\nOver $200,000 \nOver $100,000 \n \n\nNone  \ne  =  equipment  packages  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H,  ICB  =  international  competitive  bidding,  NCB  =  national \ncompetitive bidding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nE. \n\nProcurement Thresholds for Consulting Services\n\nTable A6.3: Procurement Thresholds for Consulting Servicesa\n\nProcurement Method\n\nQuality Cost Based Selection  \nConsultants Qualifications Selection (None) \nLeast Cost Selection (None) \nIndividual Selection: 1c, 2c, 4c, 5c, 6c, 7c, 8c, 9c, 11c, 13, 14c \nAlternative Methods \nQuality Based Selection:b 12c \nFixed budget:c 3c, 10c\n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n53\n\nc = consulting packages in Supplementary Appendix H. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\na Note  that  all  training  packages  (see  indicative  procurement  packages  below)  will  be  provided  in  conjunction  with \n\nrelevant associated consulting packages. \n\nb Quality-based selection will be employed to procure a consultant package where the assignment is complex, highly \n\nspecialized with overriding importance on the impact of the quality of the services.\n\nc The  Fixed  Budget  method  is  used  for  a  lump  sum  fixed  contract  for  conducting  publicity  of  National  Integrity \nStrategy  (NIS)  across  the  country,  and  for  evaluation  of  NIS  and  implementation  of  United  Nations  Convention \nAgainst Corruption (UNCAC) by an independent source. \n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\nTable A6.4: Indicative Procurement Packages for the Technical Assistance \n\nItem\n\nA.

Accordingly, this assessment considers (i) \nrelevant  governance  issues  in  key  institutions  engaged  in  anticorruption  and  their  functioning, \n(ii) potential risks in supporting a program in the particular sector, and (iii) mitigation measures \nto address the risks in the design and implementation of the Program.  \n\nA. \n\nRelevant Governance Issues in the Anticorruption Sector \n\n2. \nThe  Government  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  accepts  corruption  as  a \ncritical  challenge  within  the  field  of  governance  in  the  country  and  recommends  the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive national anticorruption strategy. The caretaker government\u2019s \npriorities  in  its  anticorruption  drive  manifest  in  the  following  key  steps  it  has  taken  thus  far,  or \nhas made a commitment to undertake. \n\n(i) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nStrengthening  the  Anticorruption  Commission  by  restructuring  the  leadership, \nstreamlining  the  legal  provisions,  committing  to  adequate  resourcing  to  enable \nprosecution of high-profile cases, and giving it greater powers.  \nStrengthening  the  scope  and  role  of  the  judiciary  by  separating  it  from  the \nExecutive and by announcing a policy on special anticorruption courts. \nCommitting  to  reforms  in  campaign  financing  that  will  begin  to  address  the \nsystemic weakness in the financing of political parties. \nContinuing with improvements in public financial management. \nTargeting  reforms  in  the  Public  Service  Commission  (PSC)  as  a  step  towards \naddressing the problem of corruption in the civil service.\n\nB. \n\nNature of Risks in the Program \n\nThe  governance  and  corruption  risks  with  respect  to  the  proposed  Program  can  be \n\n3. \ngrouped into the following three areas.  \n\n1. \n\nLegislative and Policy Framework \n\nRisks  in  this  particular  category  (which  relate  to  the  policy-making  process  both  in  the \n\n4. \nexecutive as well as the legislative branch of government) can be specified as follows \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nAn overarching national vision and strategy on anticorruption is missing. \nThe Anticorruption Commission Act and rules and regulations are not completely \naligned to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). \nThe  separation  of  the  judiciary  from  the  Executive  is  still  pending  although  the \nSupreme Court has sought cabinet\u2019s directive on this. \nThere is an absence of relevant legislation supporting anticorruption work (such \nas on whistleblower protection and right to information). \nAppropriate  legislation  prescribing  qualifications  of  High  Court  judges  for \nrecruitment is missing.\n\n                                                \n1 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II). Manila. \n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 9\n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n5. \n\nRisks in this category can be specified as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Anticorruption  Commission  is  still  underresourced,  is  constrained  by  weak \ncapacity,  systems,  and  human  resource  base,  and  has  weak  prosecution \ncapability. Its district and regional presence is also not effective. \nThe  public  prosecution  services  are  underresourced  and  unable  to  carry  out \nneutral and effective prosecution. \nThe Judicial Service Commission (JSC) is underresourced and there is a critical \nneed to enhance its capability to fulfill its functions. \nA regular and systematic process of monitoring subordinate judges and courts is \nnot fully in place. \n\n3. \n\nAccountability and Transparency \n\n6. \n\nRisks related to accountability and transparency are as follows: \n\nThere is weak accountability (including on internal audit) and grievance redress \nmechanisms within line ministries. \nThe office of the ombudsman has not yet been established. \nRecruitment  (and  mobility  within  the  civil  service)  of  civil  servants  is  not  merit-\nbased or transparent, and is excessively politicized. \nCitizens  have  no  authorized  access  to  information  on  government  functioning \nand decision making. \n\nC. \n\nRisk Severity and Risk Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nUnderlying Assumptions \n\n7. \n\nThe following are the main underlying assumptions that are made in this risk analysis. \n\nThe Government will remain committed to its objective and intention of improving \ngovernance at the national, central, judicial, and sectoral levels. \nLegal  and  institutional  reforms  so  far  brought  about  will  be  sustained  in  the \nimmediate future. \nEffective institution building and capacity development in key agencies, such as \nCabinet  Division,  judiciary,  the  Anticorruption  Commission,  the  Chittagong  Port \nAuthority (CPA), and power and railway sectors, will continue. \nThe Government shares the view that this assessment presents an accurate and \nadequate review of governance and anticorruption risks.  \n\n2. \n\nRisk Severity \n\nTable A9.1 shows the degree of severity of these and other risks. Note that Type 1 are \n\n8. \nthe most severe, followed by Type II and Type III.  \n\n\fTable A9.1: Risk Severity Matrix \n\n5 \n\nVery High \n\n4 \n\nHigh \n\n5 Very likely  Type I \n\n(cid:120) Public \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n 59\n\n2 \n\nLow \n\n1 \n\nVery Low \n\nType III \n(cid:120) UNCAC not \naligned to \nAnticorruption \nCommission Act\n\n4\n\nLikely \n\n(cid:120) Judiciary not fully \n\n(cid:120) Delays in \n\nseparate\n\npromulgating \nwhistleblower \nand right to \ninformation\nacts\n\nImpact (I) \n\n3 \n\nModerate \n\nType II\n\n(cid:120) Lack of comprehensive \nvision and strategy on \nanticorruption\n\n(cid:120) Regular and systematic \nprocess of monitoring \njudges and courts not \nfully in place\n\n(cid:120) Appropriate legislation \n\nprescribing\nqualifications of High \nCourt judges not \ndeveloped\n\n(cid:120) Establishment of \n\nOmbudsman delayed \n\n(cid:120) Low priority to \n\ngrievance redress \nmechanism by \nministries\n\nprosecution \nservice\nunderresourced\n\n(cid:120) JSC \n\nunderresourced\n\n(cid:120) Citizens lack \naccess to \ninformation\n\n(cid:120) Recruitment or \n\nmobility not merit-\nbased \n\n(cid:120) Anticorruption\nCommission\nunderresourced \n\n \n\n(cid:120) Expenditure of \nfunds not for \npurposes\nintended \n\n \n)\nL\n(\n \ng\nn\ni\nr\nr\nu\nc\nc\no\n \nt\nn\ne\nv\ne\n \nf\no\nd\no\no\nh\n\n \n\ni\nl\ne\nk\ni\nL\n\n3 Moderately \n\nlikely \n\n2\n\nUnlikely \n\nType IV \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1\n\nRare \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJSC = Judicial Service Commission, UNCAC = United Nations Convention Against Corruption. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n3. \n\nRisk Mitigation Measures \n\nSome of the mitigating measures for the more severe risks highlighted above are shown \n\n9. \nin Table A9.2. \n\nTable A9.2: Risk Mitigation Measures Matrix \n\nRisk \nAdequate resources not made available by \nthe Government for strengthening public \nprosecution service and the JSC. \n\nProposed Mitigation Measures \nFollow up on Government\u2019s assurance, use donor funding for reforms \nin anticorruption and the judiciary, and ADB loan funds earmarked for \nreforms.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 9\n\nRisk \nNo right to information access for citizens. \n\nProposed Mitigation Measures \n\nConsider drafting the right to information legislation as part of the \nbroader agenda on instituting good governance. \n\nPoliticization of the civil service, and the \nappointment process at PSC not yet \nindependent. \n\nStart by amending the selection process of PSC commissioners (so \nthat selection is done by a committee), and make recruitment and \nmobility processes in the civil service subject to transparent criteria. \n\nLack of an overarching vision and strategy \non anticorruption. \n\nRatify the UNCAC, and after development of the NIS is prepared, \nensure that the provisions of UNCAC are accurately reflected not only \nin the NIS but also in the Anticorruption Commission Act of 2004. \n\nRegular and systematic process of \nmonitoring judges and courts not fully in \nplace. \n\nEnsure that the Supreme Court is suitably resourced to facilitate \nregular monitoring visits, and a system is in place to capture the \nresults of the monitoring process as it relates to performance appraisal \nof district court judges.   \n\nJudiciary not yet fully separated from the \nExecutive. \n\nCabinet to issue a directive on the separation after preparing all \nnecessary ground-level work. \n\nNo legislation prescribing qualifications for \nhigh court judges. \n\nDraft relevant laws drawing on the provisions in the Constitution and in \nconsultation with the Supreme Court. \n\nEstablishment of ombudsman delayed. \n\nContinue to engage with Government on the need for an ombudsman; \nprovide technical assistance, and familiarize senior government \nofficials with good practices in this area. \n\nWeak accountability and grievance redress \nmechanisms in line ministries. \n\nConduct VCAs in relevant line ministries, and ensure that the VCAs \nlead to rigorous anticorruption strategies that also highlight how to \nstrengthen internal accountability systems in the organizations. \n\nJSC = Judicial Service Commission, PSC = Public Service Commission, UNCAC = United Nations Convention \nAgainst Corruption, VCA = vulnerability to corruption assessment. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nD. \n\nRecommendations  \n\nThe  assessment  identifies  several  recommendations  to  mitigate  the  risks  that  could \n10. \nimpact  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Program.

In addition, the \nNPRS  aims  to  halve  the  number  of  poor  people  by  2015,  and  to  achieve  substantial \nimprovement in all aspects of human development. \n\nIn addition to achieving progress on sectoral areas, the NPRS also aims to foster good \n2. \ngovernance by improving government capacity, promoting local government, tackling corruption, \nenhancing access to justice for the poor, and improving security and public order. This is to be \ncomplemented  by  fostering  partnerships  between  government,  the  private  sector,  and  civil \nsociety organizations to improve service delivery.  \n\n3. \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) 2006\u20132010 aims to assist good governance. \nADB will address key governance issues on a sector and thematic basis. Hence, ADB will play a \nmajor  role  in  supporting  policy  and  institutional  reforms  to  improve  sector  governance  and \nincrease sector efficiency (for example, in energy, transport, education, urban health and urban \nwater supply, and sanitation sectors). \n\nThe  caretaker  government  that  came  to  power  in  early  2007  has  stated  a  vision  of \n4. \nestablishing  a  modern  democratic  Bangladesh  free  from  corruption,  discrimination,  and \nexploitation.  Key  among  the  reforms  prioritized by  the  Government  are  fighting  corruption  and \nensuring judicial independence from the Executive. The Government is making steady but slow \nprogress  in  addressing  some  of  the  broad  governance  issues,  including  improving  (i)  fiscal \nmanagement,  (ii)  financial  management,  (iii)  project  documentation  and  processing,  (iv)  public \nsector management efficiency, and (v) corporate governance in key sectors.   \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\na. \n\nKey Issues \n\nThe contribution of good governance to poverty reduction is well documented. As good \n5. \ngovernance  creates  an  institutional  environment  that  is  characterized  by  principles  of \naccountability, transparency, predictability, and participation, it gives poor people a say in how \ndecisions  are  made  in  government  and  how  services  are  delivered.  This  voice  mechanism \nensures  that  governments  become  more  responsive  to  the  needs  of  poor  people,  and  this \ncreates an important link between good governance and poverty reduction.

Manila. \n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 10\n\ncivil society in Bangladesh in gearing service providers to be better attuned to the needs of poor \npeople exemplify this. \n\n6. \nThe  links  between  corruption  and  poverty  are  also  well  established.  This  link  has  a \nduality: corruption is often viewed as exacerbating conditions of poverty (such as in low income \nlevels  and  low  access  to  basic  services),  while  a  situation  of  chronic  poverty  invariably \nengenders  systemic  corruption.  While  corruption  itself  may  not  produce  poverty,  it  does  have \ndirect  consequences  on  economic  and  governance  factors  that,  in  turn,  impact  poverty  if  they \nare  not  managed  properly.  There  is  ample  evidence  to  suggest  that  corruption  hinders \neconomic  growth  (by,  for  example,  discouraging  investment  and  decreased  tax  revenues). \nBangladesh  would  have  higher  growth  rates  if  the  level  of  corruption  was  lower  than  it  is \ncurrently.\n\n7. \nCorruption also affects poverty by influencing governance factors which have an impact \non  poverty  levels.  Corruption  invariably  weakens  institutions  and  diminishes  the  quality  of \nservice delivery which impacts the poor disproportionately. They end up having to pay more for \nservices,  and  worse,  the  level  of  public  trust  in  Government  weakens;  this  increases  the \nvulnerability of the poor as they can rely less on the Government to provide for their needs in an \nefficient,  effective,  and  affordable  manner.  Thus,  effectively  combating  corruption  directly \ncontributes to the alleviation of poverty. \n\nb. \n\nDesign Features \n\n8. \n\nSome important features of the Program are as follows. \n\nFor the first time there exists a National Integrity Strategy (NIS) that will enable \nagencies to critically assess their vulnerabilities to corruption. The strategy itself \nwill be owned by Government at the highest level. \nThe  NIS  will  be  aligned  to  the  provisions  in  the  United  Nations  Convention \nAgainst Corruption (UNCAC), which the Government has acceded to. \nIt \nencompasses prevention as well as enforcement and sanctions.  \nIt  adheres  to  the  harmonized  approach  agreed  by  all  development  partners  in \nBangladesh.  \nIt is wholly aligned with the outcomes and new initiatives of the Government. \n\nin  different  branches  of  government,  and \n\nimpacts  upon \n\ninstitutions \n\nIn addition, the component on prevention under the Program includes several important \n\n9. \npro-poor features. \n\nWastage and mismanagement of resources will be checked in order to improve \nservice delivery to citizens including the poor in selected sectors.  \nExisting  accountability  mechanisms  in  line  ministries  will  be  strengthened  to \nminimize corruption opportunities at the sectoral and agency level. \nEstablishment  of  an  ombudsman\u2019s  office  will  improve  citizen\u2019s  access  to \ngrievance redress mechanisms. \nRight  to  information  legislation  will  enhance  transparency  of  government \ndecisions. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n\f3. \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n\nTable A10.1: Poverty Impact Analysis Matrix \n\nChannel Effect \n\nReform Summary \n\nEffect on the Poor/Other Stakeholders \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n 63\n\nMajor\ngroups \naffected \n\nKey issues \nfor poverty \nreduction and \ntargeting \n\nPort \nemployees \n\nLaborers  \n\nDaily \nworkers \n\nService\nusers\n\nEnsure that \nany voluntary \nretirement\nscheme has \nbeen shared \nwith all \naffected\nemployees in \nadvance \nEnsure that \nlower \nproduction \ncosts are \nactually \nreflected in \ncosts of \naccess\n\nAll users of \nservices\n\nProgram\nimpacts do not \nfilter down \nsufficiently to \nthe poor \n\nMitigation or \nenhancement \nmeasures to \navoid \nnegative \nsocial impact, \nif needed \nProvision of \nretraining \nneeds to be \nmade for those \nthat wish to re-\nenter the labor \nforce\n\nGovernment,\nsupported by \ncivil society, \nhas to be \nvigilant that the \npoor are \nbenefiting from \nreforms in the \nProgram\n\nGeneral \n\nSpecific \n\nDirect short \nrun\n\nIndirect \nshort run \n\nIndirect \nmedium run \n\nLabor \nMarket\n\nFormal\nInformal\n\n \n\nPossibility of \nimpact of \nany changes \nin staff size \nin\norganization \n\nPrices  and \nIncome\n\nFor \nconsumers, \nproducers,  \nmediators/ \nTransmission \n\nPayment of \nbribe by \nconsumers \nreduced in \nservice\ndelivery \n\nBetter\nreflection of \ntrue costs of \nservice\ndelivery \n\n \n\n \n\nAccess  for \nPoor\n\n \n\nAccess  to \nAssets\n\nPhysical \nFinancial \nHuman \nSocial\nNatural \nLegal and \nentitlement \n\nTransfers \n\nPrivate \ntransfer\nPublic transfer \n\nLower actual \ncosts of \nservices will \nimprove\naccess for \nthe poor to \nmany \nservices\n\nQuicker\naccess to \njudicial \nservices\ngiven \nseparation of \njudiciary \nfrom\nExecutive, \nparticularly \nat the local \nlevel\n\nControl over \nmismanage-\nment of \nresources \ncontributing \nto lower \nprices\n\nGreater\nproductivity \nenhances \nsavings\nGreater trust \nin the public \nsector by the \npoor will \nhave a \npositive \nimpact on its \nability to be \nmore\nefficient and \neffective\nGreater trust \nin the court \nsystem, and \nlower costs \nof judicial \nservices\n\nMore access \nto relevant \ninformation\non the \njudiciary \n\nAll those \nseeking \njudicial \nservices\n\nEnsure that \nlegal services \nare accessible \nat lower cost \n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 10\n\nChannel Effect \n\nReform Summary \n\nEffect on the Poor/Other Stakeholders \n\nGeneral \n\nSpecific \n\nDirect short \nrun\n\nIndirect \nshort run \n\nIndirect \nmedium run \n\nMajor\ngroups \naffected \n\nKey issues \nfor poverty \nreduction and \ntargeting \n\nMitigation or \nenhancement \nmeasures to \navoid \nnegative \nsocial impact, \nif needed \n\nNet Impact \n\n \n\n \n\nInformation Basis or \nCrucial Assumption \n\n \n\nThe net \nimpact is \npositive but \nwill take \nsome time to \nbe evident \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.

The \nconceptual basis of (ii) is grounded on the positive impact of anticorruption on growth. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nB. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nFindings of Social Analysis\n\n \n\na. \n\nKey Issues \n\n10. \nThe  key  socioeconomic  issues  that  are  evident  in  the  Program  deal  with  the  adverse \nimpacts of corruption and mismanagement of public resources on the economy as a whole and \non the lives of the citizens (largely through poor service delivery and greater costs of accessing \nservices).  While  rent-seeking  practices  cannot  be  entirely  eliminated  in  any  system,  the \nProgram  attempts  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  corruption  by  strengthening  not  only  preventive \nmeasures  but  also  by  introducing  enforcement  measures  and  sanctions.  These  will  have \npositive  economic  as  well  as  social  effects,  including  a  greater  level  of  public  trust  in \nGovernment, and more efficient and effective service delivery.  \n\n11. \nThe primary beneficiaries of the Program will be not only the citizens who interact with \nthe public sector on a daily basis, but also businesses, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nbureaucrats  themselves,  and  others.  All  the  stakeholders  have  the  same  demand:  that  the \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n 65\n\npublic sector provides better services more efficiently and effectively (i.e., costs charged do not \nexceed  the  true  costs  of  service  provision).  The  primary  constraint  to  this  occurring  at  the \nmoment  is  the  gap  in  existing  policies,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  that  inhibits  effective \nenforcement and sanctions against those involved in corruption. Finally, there is evidence of a \ncritical  lack  of  capability  in  key  government  agencies  to  combat  practices  that  lead  to \nmismanagement and corruption, and this Program specifically addresses that deficiency. \n\n2. \n\nStrategy to Address Social Issues \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nConsultation and Participation\n\nin \n\ninclude \n\nthe  program \n\nformulation  process \n\nStakeholder  groups  engaged \n\n12. \nthe \nAnticorruption  Commission,  Cabinet  Division,  central  level  Government  ministers  and  senior \nlevel  decision  makers,  Chittagong  Port  Authority  (CPA),  sectoral  agencies  (such  as  railways, \npower,  and  Ministry  of  Shipping),  and  others  outside  government  (such  as  NGOs  and \ndevelopment  partners).  The  decisions  made  through  consultation  and  participation  processes \nincluded (i) how to structure the National Integrity Strategy (NIS), (ii) how to best meet the gaps \nin organizational resources, (iii) how best to engage NGOs, and (iv) how to secure commitment \nfrom  top  political  and  bureaucratic  levels.  Moving  forward,  the  consultation  and  participation \nprocesses  will  involve  getting  commitment  from  all  stakeholders  on  the  NIS,  and  on \nimplementation  of  the  United  Nations  Convention  Against  Corruption  (UNCAC)  provisions. \nFurther,  a  National  Integrity  Advisory  Committee  (NIAC)  will  ensure  that  there  is  broad \ncommitment  from  Government,  particularly  on  the  NIS,  which  is  the  basis  of  the  Good \nGovernance Program. \n\n13.  What \nimplementation and monitoring?  \n\nlevel  of  consultation  and  participation \n\nis  envisaged  during \n\nthe  project \n\n  Information sharing\n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaboration     \n\n Empowerment \n\n14.  Was a consultation and participation plan prepared? \n\n Yes\n\n No\n\nNo specific consultation and participation plan is prepared, however, there will be formal \n15. \nterms  of  reference  of  the  NIAC,  as  well  as  terms  of  reference  for  participation  of  NGOs  in \nvarious program-related activities, such as reviews and evaluation. \n\nb. \n\nGender and Development \n\n(i) \n\nKey Issues\n\n \n\n \n\nThere is empirical evidence to show that women have to pay more in bribes than men; \n16.  \nthat women have to wait longer than men to see officials, and that when they do they are three \ntimes more likely to be \u2018queue-jumped\u2019 than men. By addressing the problem of corruption, the \nProgram will have indirectly maximized impacts on women, who (studies have shown) bear an \nunequal burden of the corruption problem.  \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nKey Actions  \n\n17.  Measures included in the design to promote equality between men\u2019s, women\u2019s and girls\u2019 \naccess to and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities: \n\n  Gender plan\n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 10\n\n18.  \nThere are no specific actions or measures that are needed in the Program to ensure that \ngender issues of anticorruption measures are taken into effective consideration. The policy level \nchanges are expected to have an impact across the full range of anticorruption issues, of which \ngender is one. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.   \n\nSocial Safeguard Issues and Other Social Risks \n\nTable A10.2: Social Safeguard Issues and Other Social Risks \n\nIssue\n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact\n\nStrategy to Address \nIssue \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included in \nDesign \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n  Resettlement \nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n  Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action\n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nThere are no specific \ninvoluntary resettlement \nissues inherent in the \nProgram\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nThere are no specific issues \nin the Program that relate to \nindigenous people \n\nLabor \n\n \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\nIssues are likely to emerge \nabout employment \nopportunities for women and \nmarginalized populations, \nand also that there might be \nlabor retrenchment at the \nChittagong Port as part of a \nlarger program of reforms in \nport operations. \n\nThere will be some civil \nworks in the Program. \n\nGiven that the Program will \ninvolve some public sector \nreform (including the \npossibility of revision of the \ncivil service law), legislation \nrelating to the civil service \nwill need to be specific about \nthe particular conditions for \nentry and exit into the civil \nservice.\n\nThe Executing Agency will, \nto the extent that it is \nnecessary and possible, \nensure that women and \nmen are given equal \nopportunities for \nemployment, and \ncontractors will also be \nrequired to ensure equal \npayment for equal work. \n\nIn Chittagong Port, a \nvoluntary retirement \nscheme could be in place \nas part of the CPA\u2019s move \ntowards greater \nproductivity. Program funds \nwill cover the adjustment \ncosts if this were to \nproceed. \n\nIn reviewing the quota \nsystem in the Bangladesh \ncivil service, and in \ntightening the merit \nrequirements for entry into \nthe civil service, care will \nbe taken to ensure that \nmerit principles and \njustifiable quota \narrangements are not  \nflouted.\n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n 67\n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included in \nDesign \n\n   Action \n   No Action\n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action\n\nIssue\n\nAffordability \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact\n\nStrategy to Address \nIssue \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS\nHuman trafficking \nOthers\n\nThere are no issues of \naffordability in the Program \nas there is no cost to \nparticipate in it. Also, the \nbenefits of the Program will \nnot only flow primarily to \nnon-poor consumers, hence \npoor groups are not likely to \nremain underserved or \nexcluded from the service. \n\n1. There are no major risks \nor vulnerabilities to the poor \nand marginalized \npopulations as a result of this \nProgram. There is a \npossibility that they may not \nsee the direct benefits of the \nanticorruption program in the \nshort term as policy reforms \ntake some time to embed \nthemselves and be evident in \nimproved service delivery \nand low rent-seeking \ntendencies. \n\n2. Lack of capacity of the \nEAs and implementing \nagencies for Program \nimplementation is a potential \nrisk.\n\n1. One way of dealing with \nthe issue is to ensure that \nthe marginalized \npopulations have access to \nvoice opportunities. This is \nreflected in the Program; \nnot only will there be \ngreater room for voicing \ngrievances against public \nsector agencies for poor \nservice delivery but there \nwill be also be provisions \nfor an ombudsman\u2019s office \nto ensure that there is an \ninstitutionalized \nmechanism in place to give \nvoice to marginalized \npopulations. \n\n2. The strategy to mitigate \nthe risk is to use the \ntechnical assistance \ncomponent of the Program \nto develop the said \ncapacity. \n\nCPA = Chittagong Port Authority, EA = executing agency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n4.     Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n19. \nSocial indicators have been included in the program framework to facilitate monitoring of \nsocial development activities or social impacts during Program implementation. These include (i) \nmeasures of satisfaction of public access to services, (ii) public perception of good governance, \n(iii)  perception  of  successful  anticorruption  drives,  (iv)  ready  access  to  information  on  the \njudiciary and its activities, and (v) citizens\u2019 report cards and their use. Reviews and evaluation in \nthe  Program  will  also  be  done,  in  some  instances  by  independent  NGOs,  so  that  a  more \nunbiased view is formed of the program outcome.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 2 October 2007) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "taka (Tk) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "Tk1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0145486 \nTk68.73500 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nBNP \nC&AG \nCIDA \nCPA \nCSP \nDANIDA \nDFID \nEA \nGDP \nJSC \nMTBF \nNIAC \nNCC \n", "NGO \nNIS \nNPRS \nPMU \nPSC \nSDR \nTA \nTIB \nUNCAC \nVCA \n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nBangladesh Nationalist Party \ncomptroller and auditor general \nCanadian International Development Agency \nChittagong Port Authority \ncountry strategy and program \nDanish International Development Assistance \nDepartment for International Development \nexecuting agency \ngross domestic product \nJudicial Service Commission \nmedium-term budgetary framework \nNational Integrity Advisory Committee \nNational Coordination Committee on Combating Corruption and \nCrime\nnongovernment organization \nNational Integrity Strategy \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy \nprogram management unit \nPublic Service Commission \nspecial drawing rights \ntechnical assistance \nTransparency International Bangladesh \nUnited Nations Convention Against Corruption \nvulnerability to corruption assessment \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.
