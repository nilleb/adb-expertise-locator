The  project  promotes  gender \nmainstreaming, greenhouse gas reduction, and public\u2013private partnership. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nVientiane, the capital of the Lao PDR has an estimated population of about 750,000. The \nprincipal urbanized areas have an estimated population of 500,000. The central core of the city \nhas  a  mixture  of  government,  educational,  religious,  and  commercial  institutions,  as  well  as \nresidential  areas,  and  is  also  the  tourism  center,  with  many  hotels  and  historical  and  cultural \nattractions.2 Many of the roads in Vientiane are narrow, and many of the intersections operate in \nan inefficient manner. The total number of private vehicles registered in Vientiane increased at \nan average annual growth rate of 17% during 2000\u20132009, and has increased at a growth rate of \nmore than 10% since then, placing Vientiane on an unsustainable transport development path, \nas  the  city  is  starting  to  experience  congestion,  increased  incidence  of  road  accidents,  and \ndeteriorating  local  air  quality.  The  expanding  use  of  private  vehicles  is  also  increasing \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions.  Motorcycles  are  the  primary  mode  of  transport,  accounting  for \n67.0% of daily  trips, while  public transport only accounts for an estimated 0.6% of daily trips.3 \nPublic transport in Vientiane is largely provided by privately operated vehicles, particularly tuk-\ntuks  (motorized  tricycles).  While  Vientiane  Capital  State  Bus  Company  (VCSBC)  provides \nservice from the central bus station in the core area to other points in Vientiane, there is no bus \nservice  linking  points  within  the  core  area.  VCSBC  lacks  (i)  staff  with  sufficient  skills,  (ii) \ncompetition,  (iii)  incentives  to  improve  efficiency,  and  (iv)  capital.  There  is  no  parking \nmanagement system in Vientiane, with no charge for on-street parking and little enforcement of \nparking regulations. \n \n4. \nThe  project  supports  the  objectives  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  sustainable  development \nstrategies,  including  the  Strategic  Framework  for  National  Sustainable  Development  Strategy \nand the National Rio+20 Report.4 The National Rio+20 Report specifies the government\u2019s long-\nterm  sustainable  transport  strategy  and  action plan.  The  project  will  support  achievement  of  a \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The core area comprises about a 1.6 square km section located along a 2.5 km stretch of the Mekong river. \n3  ADB.  2011.

ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  preparation  of  the  updated  BRT  Planning \nGuide will facilitate the use of best practices in developing the BRT system in Vientiane. 10 \n \n7. \nThe  project  has  a  number  of  special  features.  Cofinancing  will  be  provided  from  five \nsources  through  loans,  grants,  and  private-sector  investment.  The  parking  and  vehicle \nregistration systems will be financed and operated by the private sector; while operations of the \nbuses, fare system and control center, and other functions will be tendered out to private service \nproviders. The project will utilize advanced technology and innovative practices, particularly for \nthe BRT system, traffic control center, and parking and vehicle registration system. The project \nwill reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nin  public \n\nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  an  environmentally  sustainable  and  pedestrian-friendly \n8. \ntransport system developed in Vientiane. The project outcome will be improved urban transport \noperations and capacity in Vientiane. \n  \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \nOutput 1: A sustainable transport management agency for Vientiane established. \nThe agency will manage operations of systems and facilities to be developed under the project \nas  well  as  other  sustainable  transport  operations  in  the  future.  Its  primary  functions  will  be  (i) \nmanaging  the  private  sector  firms  providing  services  for  BRT  operations,  the  parking  and \nvehicle  registration  system,  and  system  management  functions;  (ii)  ensuring  that  services \nprovided  are  of  high  quality;  (iii)  managing  daily  operations of  the  public  transport system;  (iv) \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2014.

The project will develop  11.5 kilometers (km) of BRT corridors in the \ncenter of Vientiane dedicated to BRT services and NMT, including 24 enclosed stations, which \nwill be serviced by 96 new BRT buses meeting a minimum Euro IV emissions standard, which \nencompasses  use  of  cleaner  fuel  and  advanced  propulsion  and  exhaust  system  technology. \nThe  new  BRT  buses  will  serve  a  network  of  84.0  km  of  routes  covering  much  of  the  city. \nOperation  of  the  BRT  buses  will  be  tendered  out  to  private  operators.  The  project  will  also \nestablish  a  state-of-the-art  BRT  and  traffic  management  control  center  and  an  electronic  fare \nsystem  with  pre-board  fare  collection.  The  new  public  transport  system  will  be  fully  integrated \nwith the existing services of VCSBC in order to maximize the coverage of the network. VCSBC\u2019s \nexisting  buses,  most  of  which  were  financed  by  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency, \nwill continue to operate. The combined network, to be served by BRT and VCSBC buses, will \nhave a total length of 137.5 km. \n \n11. \nOutput 3: Traffic management in the core area of Vientiane  improved. The project \nwill introduce measures to improve traffic management so that traffic moves more efficiently in \nthe  core  area  of  Vientiane.  These  will  include  installing  or  upgrading  traffic  signals  at  21  key \nintersections,  providing  new  road  markings  and  signage,  and  establishing  a  central  traffic \ncontrol center (joint control center with the BRT system [para. 10]) using the latest technology. \n \n12. \nOutput  4:  Paid  parking  system  and  national  vehicle  registration  system \nestablished. A new on-street paid parking system for Vientiane\u2019s core area will be established \nthat  uses  electronic  meter  technology.  The  new  parking  system  will  provide  2,100  on-street \nparking  spaces  for  cars  and  1,800  spaces  for  motorcycles.  Also,  a  national  electronic  vehicle \nregistration system will be established  that facilitates enforcement of parking regulations. Both \nthe parking and electronic vehicle registration systems will be implemented by private firms. \n \n13. \nOutput  5:  Accessibility  for  pedestrians  and  other  nonmotorized  transport  in  the \ncore  area  of  Vientiane  improved.  The  project  will  improve  pedestrian  facilities  near  BRT \nstation areas by installing signalized pedestrian crossings, street lighting, pavement upgrades, \nand  universal  accessibility  measures.  In  addition,  the  project  will  finance  capacity  building  for \ntuk-tuk drivers and demonstration of modern electric-assist vehicles as a possible replacement \nfor existing highly polluting vehicles. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe project is estimated to cost $99.70 million (Table 1).

The  primary  functions  of  the  SUTMA  will  be  management,  quality  assurance,  future \ndevelopment,  and  public  communications  (para.  9).  It  is  expected  that  the  entity  will  manage \nabout  $17  million  of  revenue  per  year,  primarily  from  the  bus  services  and  parking  system. \nDiscussions among key stakeholders on the optimal organizational structure of the SUTMA and \ninstitutional  location  began  during  project  preparation.  The  discussions  will  continue  during \nproject  implementation  and  will  be  facilitated  by  project-financed  consultants.  The  project  will \nprovide an advisor to the SUTMA and financial support during its first 2 years of operation. \n \n17. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.12 Physical completion of the project will be by 30 June 2020, \nand  all  loans  and  grants  will  close  by  31  December  2020.  A  maintenance  period  to  cover  the \nfinal  3  years  of  the  5-year  maintenance  period  included  in  the  contracts  for  the  buses,  fare \nsystem,  control  center  equipment,  and  BRT  stations  will  extend  to  30  September  2023.  All \nexpenses during the maintenance period will be financed by the government. Since the project \nis  financed  from  Asian  Development  Fund  resources  with  ADB-administered  cofinancing, \nuniversal procurement will apply to all contract packages financed under the project.13 \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  Physical completion: 30 June 2020 \n\nArrangements \nJune 2015\u2013June 2020 \n\nLoan closing: 31 December 2020 \nMaintenance period: 30 September 2023a \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit  PCU, 8 staff \n\nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nSteering Committee \nVice Minister of MPWT (chair) \nOfficials from MPWT, Vientiane mayor\u2019s office, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment, and Ministry of Planning and Investment (members) \nMPWT \nDepartment of Transport (MPWT) \n\nInternational competitive bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nQCBS (90:10) \nLCS \nIndividual \nConsulting services for (i) project planning, management, detailed design, and \nsupervision; and (ii) international urban transport advisor \nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB \n\n5 contracts \n1 contract \n490 person-months \n30 person-months \n116 person-months \n\n$ 59.61 million \n$ 0.46 million \n$ 7.38 million \n$ 0.14 million \n$ 1.08 million \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, LCS = least cost selection, MPWT = Ministry of Public Works and Transport, PCU = \nproject coordination unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \na  All expenses during the maintenance period will be financed by the government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n                                                 \n12  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13  ADB.  2013.

The  institutional \nstructure of the SUTMA, which will operate the public transport system, is based on successful \nBRT and sustainable transport models currently in operation. The quality of the system will be \nenhanced by maximizing the use of private sector contracts for system operations, which will be \noverseen  by  SUTMA.  The  BRT  system  planning  utilized  global  positioning  system-based \nmapping,  analysis  of  existing  services  to  determine  current  demand,  surveys  and  inventory  of \nexisting  services  to  determine  current  service  capacity,  and  surveys  of  the  proposed  BRT \ncorridor. Based on the results, an optimized routing and network plan was developed. Ridership \nwill comprise more than 11,000 passenger boardings during the peak hour. \n \n19. \nFor the traffic management component, detailed analysis of traffic conditions was carried \nout that included traffic counts, surveys, and traffic signal efficiency analysis. As a result of this \nanalysis,  the  component  will  include  new  traffic  signalization  for  several  uncontrolled \nintersections,  upgrading  of  other  signals,  and  the  creation  of  a  new  centralized  traffic  control \ncenter. The design of the parking system is based on multiple parking surveys in the core area \nof the city and a full analysis of parking supply and demand, including the duration of parking. \nThe  use  of  electronic  metering  technology  in  conjunction  with  the  parking  tariff  system  will \nensure parking efficiency and optimization of resources. To improve accessibility for pedestrians \nand other NMT, pedestrian movements in the core area were analyzed.  The project will focus \non access points to the BRT stations as well as pedestrian safety priorities. The improvement of \noperating  conditions  and  profitability  for  existing  tuk-tuk  operators  has  also  been  targeted \nthrough provision of modern vehicles and customer service training. \n \nPublic\u2013private  partnership  structures  will  be  utilized  extensively  to  maximize  the \n20. \nleveraging of additional financial resources and to improve the quality of the services delivered. \nOverall quality control and system management will be the responsibility of the SUTMA, which \nwill  manage  private  sector  contracts  awarded  to  the  bus  operating  company,  the  fare  system \nand control center company, a financial clearinghouse company, and a quality control company \nthat  will  perform  monitoring  and  evaluation  responsibilities.  In  addition,  a  public\u2013private \npartnership  model  for  the  parking  management,  parking  enforcement,  and  electronic  vehicle \nregistration  components  will  directly  finance  those  components.  The  project  implementation \nconsultants will assist in the design of the public\u2013private partnership structures. This model of \npublic  sector  management  and  private  sector  service  delivery  has  been  proven  as  a  best \npractice model for the leading BRT and parking management systems worldwide.14 \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nEconomic. Four main benefits were identified and estimated for inclusion in the project\u2019s \neconomic  viability  assessment:  (i)  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  except  those  related  to  the \nparking  component;  (ii)  reduced  travel,  waiting,  and  walking  time  for  bus  passengers;  (iii) \nreduced costs of injuries and fatalities due to improved road safety; and (iv) reduced time spent \nsearching for parking places and associated reduced vehicle operating costs. The assessment \ncovered  6  years  of  project  implementation  and  20  years  of  operations.  The  economic  internal \n\n                                                 \n14 Institute for Transportation & Development Policy. 2007. Bus Rapid Transit Planning Guide. New York; ADB. 2011. \n\nParking Policy in Asian Cities. Manila. \n\n \n\n\frate  of  return  is  17.0%,  and  the  net  present  value  (discounting  at  12.0%)  is  $27.23  million. \nSensitivity analysis shows that the economic internal rate of return is 13.9% in the case of total \nbenefits  being  reduced  by  20.0%,  and  14.5%  in  the  case  of  total  costs  being  increased  by \n20.0%.  The  combined  effect  of  the  benefit  reduction  of  15.0%  and  the  cost  increase  15.0% \nleaves the economic internal rate of return at 12.9%, which is still above the threshold rate.15 \n \n22. \nFinancial.  The  project  is  financially  sustainable,  but  will  require  a  capital  subsidy  for \nreplacement of the buses and operating systems and a temporary operating subsidy. To assess \nthe  financial  sustainability,  financial  statements  covering  15  years  following  project  completion \nwere prepared. Recurrent annual and periodic project ongoing costs, which comprise those of \nthe  BRT  and  NMT  subprojects  and  the  SUTMA  operation  and  staff  costs,  and  revenues  from \nthe  bus  system  and  the  parking  subproject  concession  fee  were  estimated.16 An  analysis  was \nconducted to determine the extent to which bus fare revenue covers the bus system operating \ncost under alternative scenarios of (i) the current fare, (ii) the revenue-maximizing fare, and (iii) \na higher fare level. For reasons of elasticity of demand, increasing the fare to maximize revenue \nresulted in little improvement in cost recovery and a significant reduction in passengers, while a \nhigher fare lost more passengers and worsened cost recovery. Utilizing the current bus fare in \nthe projected financial statements, the public transport system will require (i) a capital grant to \nmeet the full replacement costs of the BRT buses, fare system, and combined BRT and traffic \ncontrol  systems,  and  (ii)  a  temporary  operating  subsidy  of  an  expected  total  of  $3.7  million \nequivalent  during  the first  4  years  of  operations.  These  will  not  be  provided  under  the  project. \nThe  government  has  agreed,  through  a  loan  covenant,  to  ensure  that  the  SUTMA  has  all \nnecessary resources to operate the bus system effectively. The combined bus fare and parking \nconcession revenue equaled or exceed the BRT subproject operating cost except during 2021-\n2022. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nAssessments  of  the  MPWT\u2019s  financial  management  and  procurement  capacity  and  of \n23. \nthe  PCU  confirmed  that  project  implementation  arrangements,  which  follow  previous  ADB \ntransport  sector  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR,  are  appropriate.  The  risk  ratings  of  the  project\u2019s \nfinancial  management  arrangements  are  substantial  for  overall  inherent  risk  and  moderate  for \noverall  control  risk.  The  executing  agency,  the  MPWT,  has  extensive  experience  in  managing \nADB-funded  and  other  externally  funded  projects  and  has  sufficient  capacity  to  undertake \ninternational  and  national  competitive  bidding  for  civil  works  packages.  The  MPWT  will  use  a \nproject financial management system, including internal control procedures currently being used \nfor  ADB-financed  road  projects.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  for  the \nproject,  following  the  successful  examples  of  ADB-financed  road  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR. 17 \nShort-term  assistance  will  be  provided  for  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  and  PCU  in  governance  and  public  financial  management  through  a \n$200,000  subcomponent  of  an  ADB  regional  TA. 18 A  private  firm  will  be  hired  for  external \nauditing  of  the  project  accounts.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  including  the  MPWT  and  the  mayor\u2019s  office. \n\n                                                 \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n16 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2007.

The  key  gender  issues \naddressed  by  the  project  include  appropriate  physical  design  that  meets  women\u2019s  needs, \naffordability,  safety,  and  security  of  female  passengers  to  promote  greater  use  of  the  BRT  by \nwomen. The project also provides an opportunity to change the traditional gender composition \nof the transport workforce by promoting women\u2019s employment in the BRT system and providing \ntraining. The project\u2019s gender action plan ensures that (i) 30% of employees of SUTMA will be \nwomen; (ii) the BRT system includes gender-specific design features such as priority seating for \nwomen and the elderly, adequate lighting, and security cameras in bus stations; (iii) 30% of jobs \ngenerated  in  the  BRT  system  are  filled  by  women;  (iv)  ticketing  and  fare  pricing  include \nmeasures  to  increase  affordability  and  access;  (v)  pedestrian-friendly  traffic  management  and \ntraffic  calming  measures  are  implemented  on  the  BRT  routes;  (vi)  baseline  sex-disaggregated \ndata and gender analytical information are collected for preparatory surveys, feasibility studies, \nand assessments prior to the start of construction; and (vii) gender indicators are included in the \nproject monitoring and evaluation system, and disaggregated data are reported.20 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n26. \nThe project is category B for environment, and an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nhas  been  prepared  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).21 The  IEE  has  been \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  project  does  not  involve  major  civil  works.  Adverse  impacts \nsuch  as  elevated  noise  levels,  dust  emissions,  traffic  disturbances,  and  other  construction-\nrelated impacts will be experienced in the vicinity of the project sites. These impacts, however, \nare  considered  minor,  being  short  term  and  localized  in  nature.  The  parking  and  traffic \nmanagement  systems  will  involve  works  of  a  minor  nature  with  negligible  environmental \nimpacts. During operation, the overall environmental impact of the project will be beneficial. The \nproject will contribute to reduced traffic congestion, improved conditions for walking and cycling, \nimproved  community  livability,  and  better  air  quality.  The  project  will  reduce  emissions  of \ngreenhouse  gases  by  shifting  transport  demand  from  private  vehicles  to  buses.  Potential \nadverse  impacts  from  operation  of  the  bus  depot  and  bus  staging  areas  are  considered \ninsignificant  and  can  be  addressed  through  good  design  and  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures  specified  in  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  included  in  the  IEE.22 The \nEMP  includes  environmental  mitigation  measures  for  all  project  phases,  and  monitoring \nrequirements and responsibilities for EMP implementation. The EMP will be incorporated in the \n                                                 \n19 Draft Stakeholder Communication Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Such  impacts  pertain  to  noise,  vehicle  emissions,  wastewater  from  washing,  waste  oil  from  maintenance  works, \nleaks and spills of hazardous substances, traffic congestion due to entry and exit of buses, and safety concerns. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fcivil works contract documents. Public consultations have been conducted for the project, and a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  developed  to  facilitate  resolution  of  project-related \nenvironmental impacts. \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n27. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  C  for  indigenous \npeoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. All affected land and structures \nidentified are owned by government organizations. The proposed stations for the BRT system \nwill  only  require  clearance  of  small  strips  of  government  right-of-way  land  and  public  parks. \nStructures  affected  are  roadside  pavements  and  curbsides,  streetlights,  electricity  poles, \nsewage intakes, and tree and garden fences. For the proposed bus staging areas, the project \nwill  acquire  the  entire  compound  (with  three  office  buildings)  owned  by  the  Institute  of  Mass \nMedia and Culture (about 2,700 square meters) and a portion of land with no structures (about \n1,500  square  meters)  owned  by  the  Vientiane Department  of  Education  and  Sports.  The  area \nfor the depot (about 1.7 hectares) is vacant land and is owned by the MPWT. No previous land \nacquisition  occurred  in  anticipation  of  ADB  financing.  Due  diligence  has  been  conducted  to \nconfirm that the depot site to be used by the project is not used by any person (i) who may be \neconomically displaced, (ii) whose structures have been or will be demolished, and/or (iii) who \nwill be restricted from using the specified area. All affected organizations have been consulted, \nand  key  information  in  the  resettlement  plan  such  as  project  entitlements,  grievance  redress, \ninstitutional  arrangements,  schedule,  and  cost  estimates  have  been  discussed  and  disclosed \nduring the preparation of the resettlement plan.23 \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28. \nThe  overall  assessment  is  that  there  is  a  medium  level  of  project  risk  that  can  be \nmitigated. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks \nand  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.24  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nThe SUTMA has insufficient capacity to ensure \nsustainability of project operations. \n\nLimited capacity in the PCU in implementation of \nurban transport projects results in delayed \nproject implementation and slow disbursement. \n\nInadequate maintenance undermines the \nsustainability of the investments in the buses \nand the fare system. \nPotential corruption in procurement due to lack \nof management personnel in the PCU with \nprocurement and financial management \nexperience on ADB-financed projects. \nGovernment counterpart funds are not provided \nas required. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project will finance 16 months of the operations of \nthe quality control company to assist in monitoring \noperators of the bus and parking components. \nThe project will finance international urban transport \nadvisors with extensive experience in public transport \noperations. The PIC will assist the PCU in \nprocurement, implementation, and disbursements. \nThe contracts for the buses and the fare system will \ninclude maintenance by the manufacturer for the first 5 \nyears of operations and training in maintenance. \nProcurement and financial management experts will \nassist the PCU during implementation. Procurement \nand implementation progress will be disclosed \npublicly. \nGovernment financing consists largely of taxes and \nprovision of government-owned land. \n\n                                                 \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe existing bus service provider objects to new \npublic transport services. \nLack of private sector interest in PPP \ncomponents \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MPWT = Ministry of Public Works and Transport, PCU = project coordination unit, \nPIC  =  project  implementation  consultants,  PPP  =  public\u2013private  partnership,  SUTMA  =  sustainable  urban  transport \nmanagement agency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nThe existing bus service provider will continue to \nprovide services on the overall network. \nThe PPP components will be designed to achieve \nsufficient returns to attract private sector interest. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n29. \nThe government and MPWT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \nThe government and MPWT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n30. \nwhich are set forth in the loan and grant agreements.
