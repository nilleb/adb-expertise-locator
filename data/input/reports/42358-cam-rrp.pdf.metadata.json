An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been \nprepared for the Project. \n\nThe  Project  will  assist  the  Government  of  Cambodia  to  improve \nthe  provincial  national  road  network  in  northwestern  Cambodia \nand  the  cross-border  facility  with  Thailand.  The  Project  includes \n(i)  improvement  of  National  Road  (NR)  56  (from  Sisophon  to \nSamraong,  approximately  113  kilometers  [km]),  (ii)  improvement \nof  the  cross-border  facility  at  O'smach,  (iii)  a  road  maintenance \nprogram,  (iv)  a  road  safety  program,  and  (v)  an  HIV  prevention \nand anti-human-trafficking program. \n\nThe  NR  56  (the  project  road)  is  a  major  provincial  road  that \ntraverses two provinces (Banteay Meanchey and Oddar Meanchey) \nin northwestern Cambodia, and also links the project area with the \nnortheastern provinces of Thailand. Banteay Meanchey and Oddar \nMeanchey  provinces  are  among \nin \nCambodia,  and  have  high  poverty  levels.  The  provinces  have \nstrong  potential  for  agriculture  development  (rice,  vegetables,  and \nfruit  plantations)  but  the  existing  road  infrastructure  is  inadequate \nfor sustainable rural development. The project road is a gravel road, \nthe surface of which is severely degraded and is subject to flooding \nand thus impassable during the wet season. The land in the project \narea  is  underutilized;  however,  since  2006,  the  area  has  seen  a \ngradual increase in contract farming from Thailand. \n\nthe  poorest  provinces \n\nThe project road links with NR 5, forming a feeder link to the Greater \nMekong  Subregion  east\u2013west  economic  corridor.  The  road  also \nconnects  to  NR  68 that links  with Thailand at  O'smach,  a strategic \nborder  point  with  strong  potential  to  promote  subregional  transport \nand  trade  between  northwestern  Cambodia  and  northeastern \nThailand.  Therefore,  the  proposed  rehabilitation  of  NR  56  and  the \nO'smach border facility will increase access to local markets, reduce \ntravel  times  and  vehicle  operating  costs,  and  increase  tourism, \nleading  to  increased  economic activity in the  project  area.  Also,  by \nproviding more direct routes to border crossings and links to major \n\n\f \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $47.89 million, \n\nincluding taxes and duties of $4.99 million.  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\neconomic  corridors, \ncooperation between Cambodia and Thailand. \n\nthe  Project  will  strengthen  subregional \n\nImproved  access \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  increased  subregional  transport \nand  trade  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand  due  to  improved \nsubregional  connectivity. \nin  northwestern \nCambodia due to rehabilitated roads will result in more direct routes \nto  border  crossings,  and  enable  increased  trade  and  tourism \nbetween  Cambodia  and  Thailand.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will \nbe  increased  transport  efficiency  in  northwestern  Cambodia.  The \nProject will help rehabilitate the provincial road network to increase \ntransport  efficiency,  sustain  economic  development  in  the  rural \nareas  and  provincial  centers,  and  facilitate  social  development  by \nreducing the remoteness of the project area. \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea\nGovernment of Cambodia \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n16.26 \n25.58 \n6.05 \n47.89 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n34.0 \n53.4 \n12.6 \n100.0 \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of \nSDR10,512,000  ($16.26  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special Fund \nresources.

The  economic  internal \nrate of return for the Project, which was calculated by comparing \nwith-project and  without-project  situations,  is  estimated  at  19.9%, \nshowing  that  it  is  economically  viable.  Sensitivity  testing  shows \nthat  there  is  a  minimal  risk  of  about  1.8%  that  the  economic \ninternal rate of return would fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. \n\nThe  project  beneficiaries  are  the  population  in  the  project  area \nwho  will  benefit  from  the  improved  roads,  increased  economic \nactivities  from  contract  farming,  and  better  access  to  health  and \neducation services. Beneficiaries also include road users traveling \nlocally, regionally, or internationally. \n \nThe  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i)  lower  than \nexpected traffic levels; (ii) delayed and suboptimal performance of \ncontractors  and  supervision;  (iii)  delay  in  procurement  and  local \ncounterpart  funding;  (iv)  delay  in  Thai  financing  for  NR  68  that \ncould reduce the transport efficiency of the road network; (v) lack \nof  adequate  counterpart  staff;  (vi)  delayed  or \ninadequate \nexecution  of  mitigating  measures,  notably  resettlement  and \nHIV/AIDS \nthe \nfuture \ninstitutional \nmanagement  and  maintenance  of  the  roads.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nCambodia, which has one of the highest incidences of poverty in Southeast Asia has had \ngood  overall  macroeconomic  figures  in  recent  years,  recording  an  average  of  11.1%  economic \ngrowth  in  2004\u20132007  although  inflation  rose  sharply  in  2008.  Despite  the  current  global  financial \ncrisis,  Cambodia  needs  to  sustain  this  economic  growth,  of  which  subregional  cooperation  is  an \nintegral  part.  Enhanced  subregional  economic  cooperation  requires  improved  connectivity  across \ncountries  and  between  centers  of  economic  activity.  For  Cambodia,  improved  links  between \nThailand  and  the  northwest,  west,  and  southwest  are  pivotal  to  this  economic  growth. \nNorthwestern  Cambodia  has  a  high  poverty  level,  and  the  provincial  road  network  is  vitally \nimportant  for  facilitating  economic  growth,  enhancing  rural  access  that  supports  the  economic \nactivity  of  northwestern  Cambodia,  and  providing  a  link  with  Thailand  to  facilitate  subregional \nconnectivity. \n \n3. \nThis  Project  forms  part  of  the  priority  projects  identified  by  Cambodia  under  the  southern \neconomic corridor flagship initiatives in 2004. The Project is included in the Vientiane Plan of Action \nfor  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Development  (2008\u20132012),  which  was  adopted  by  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  leaders  at  the  Third  GMS  Summit  2008.  The  summit  supported  the \nstrategic  thrusts  of  completing  key  parts  of  the  GMS  transport  network  and  transforming  these \ncorridors into fully fledged economic corridors. The Project will serve as another transnational corridor \nlinking Thailand with Cambodia, and will connect with the main corridor linking Bangkok, Phnom Penh, \nHo  Chi  Minh  City,  and  Vung  Tau.  It  will  also  support  the  GMS  transport  strategy  by  improving \nsubregional  connectivity  between  Thailand  and  Cambodia  at  O'smach, \nthereby  enhancing \nsubregional  transport  and  trade.  In  northwestern  Cambodia  the  Project  will  provide  reliable  all-year \naccess  from  provincial  towns  and  rural  areas  to  markets,  employment,  and  social  services  such  as \nadvanced health and education facilities, and also access to historical and natural cultural sites. The \nProject  road,  which  is  linked  to  about  722  kilometers  (km)  of  rural  roads  rehabilitated  under  the \nNorthwestern  Rural  Development  Project, 1  will  enhance  economic  and  social  activities  of  the \nnorthwestern areas by reducing production and transport costs, increasing private investment, raising \nagricultural activities, and supporting development of the tourism sector. The feasibility study for the \nProject  was  prepared  through  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  the \nGovernment of Cambodia, in 2005.2 \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n4. \nRoad is the principal transport mode for the movement of goods and people in Cambodia, \nand between countries within the GMS. Roads are critical to social and economic development in \nCambodia,  especially  in  the  project  areas  where  roads  are  the  only  available  transport  mode. \nCambodia's  road  network  comprises  39,400  km  of  roads  that  are  categorized  as  national, \nprovincial, and rural. The 4,800 km of national roads connect the capital Phnom Penh to the main \ninternational  border  crossings  and  the  provincial  capitals,  while  the  6,600  km  of  provincial  roads \nconnect  a  provincial  center  to  adjacent  provincial  or  district  centers.  The  national  and  provincial \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Cambodia for the Northwestern Rural Development Project. Manila (Loan 1862-CAM). \n\n2  ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Transport  Infrastructure  Development  and \n\nMaintenance Project. Manila (TA 4691-CAM). \n\n\froads are managed by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), while the network of \nabout  28,000  km  of  rural  roads  (gravel  and  laterite  paved)  is  managed  by  the  Ministry  for  Rural \nDevelopment.  With  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners  over  the  past  16  years, \nabout 2,700 km of national roads, mostly the primary or 1-digit national roads, have been paved. \nHowever,  this  represents  less  than  25%  of  the  total  national  road  length  and  the  secondary \nnational network (2-digit national roads that link provinces to the national road network and provide \nintraprovincial links to the tertiary and rural network and to Cambodia\u2019s largely rural population) has \nreceived  little  attention  until  recently.  As  a  result,  the  road  network  is  split  into  two  networks  of \nprimary and tertiary roads, which are loosely and unreliably interconnected. This situation hinders \nthe  development  of  cash-crop  production  in  the  rural  areas,  where  markets  in  many  places  are \nlimited to the local area due to lack of access. It also means that provincial centers and numerous \nnatural  and  cultural  sites  with  tourism  potential  are  inaccessible.  As  a  result,  many  important \nbilateral  cross-border  trade  routes  are  inaccessible,  thus  increasing  transport  costs  as  longer \nalternative  routes  have  to  be  used.  Poor  transport  connections  also  restrict  access  to  job \nopportunities, markets, schools, and health facilities. Therefore, the provision of improved roads in \nareas  where  populations  currently  do  not  have  good  access  to  such  basic  services  will  have  a \nmajor impact on their livelihoods. \n \n5. \nThe  contribution  of  the  road  sector  to  economic  development  is  being  limited  by  poor \nmaintenance  of  existing  road  assets  combined  with  rapid  traffic  growth.  As  is  the  case  in  many \nleast-developed  countries  such  as  Cambodia,  poor  road  maintenance  is  an  issue  as  financial \nresources  are  not  adequately  allocated  to  maintaining  these  assets.  However,  this  situation  has \nchanged  recently  in  Cambodia.  This  is  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  road  maintenance  funds  have \nincreased  significantly  in  2008  to  about  $42.5  million,  increasing  from  $7.0  million  in  2006  and \n$26.0  million  in  2007.  This  is  about  20  times  the  $2  million\u2013$3  million  total  maintenance \nexpenditure  during  2002\u20132003.  Given  the  indirect  impacts  of  the  world  economic  downturn,  the \nbudget  allocation  for  road  maintenance  in  2009  has  decreased  to  about  $32  million,  while \nprojections  for  road  maintenance  for  2010  are  about  $35  million,  and  for  2011\u20132013  about  $40 \nmillion per year. ADB is also providing additional support to address the road maintenance issues \nunder the Road Asset Management Project3 and the proposed Provincial and Rural Roads Asset \nManagement Project scheduled for approval in 2010. The current organizational structure for road \nmaintenance  management,  the  technical  capacity  of  road  agencies,  and  local  contractors  will  be \nfurther strengthened through implementation of these road projects. \n \nThe  ongoing  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement  Project 4  has \n6. \nassisted  the  MPWT  to  change  its  organizational  structure  to  effectively  manage  the  road  sector. \nThe  new  organizational  structure  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  prime  minister  by  mid-2009, \nfor  implementation  thereafter.  Also,  under  the  Road  Asset  Management  Project  approved  in \nJanuary  2008,  additional  support  was  provided  to  strengthen  the  MPWT's  capacity  in  road \nmaintenance  management  and  to  help  develop  private  contractors  who  could  undertake  road \nmaintenance works effectively. The establishment of the Road Asset Management Office to be the \nroad  asset  manager  as  required  under  this  Project  is  an  important  step  in  developing  a  road \nmanagement  system  that  will  establish  internal  incentives  for  accountability  and  efficiency.  The \nestablishment  of  the  Road  Asset  Management  Office  is  also  a  vital  step  in  the  MPWT's \nreorganization  program.  Further,  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Southern  Coastal  Corridor \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2007.

Manila (Loan 1945-\nCAM). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fProject 5 will  also  contribute  to  the  development  of  sustainable  road  maintenance  by  financing \ndemonstration  projects  that  will  enhance  implementation  of  road  maintenance  through  contracts \nthat have been competitively bid for. An overview of the road subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nSubregional traffic is dominated by freight and passenger road traffic. Although subregional \ntraffic  is  still  modest  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand,  great  efforts  are  being  made  to  promote \ninternational traffic by (i) forging effective cross-border agreements to facilitate movement of goods \nand  people,  and  (ii)  establishing  border-crossing  infrastructure  and  border  access  roads. \nCambodia and Thailand have already opened the O'smach\u2013Chong Chom border-crossing point to \ninternational traffic. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the Bilateral Exchange of Traffic \nRights  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand  was  signed  by  the  two  countries  during  the  Third  GMS \nSummit  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  in  March  2008. 6 The  intention  is  to  provide \ninterim  arrangements  for  the  exchange  of  traffic  rights  between  the  two  countries  for  up  to  40 \nvehicles, daily, until such time that the relevant annexes and protocols of the GMS Cross-Border \nTransport Agreement (CBTA) enter into force between the two countries (Appendix 3).7 Under this \nMOU, Cambodia and Thailand can include other border-crossing points, roads, and provinces in its \ngeographic  scope  of  application. 8 Cambodia  and  Thailand  are  discussing  the  inclusion  of  the \nO'smach\u2013Chong Chom cross-border point and associated corridor in the scope of the MOU, with \nthe expectation that it will be included in the scope of application of the CBTA when the CBTA fully \nenters  into  force.  Since  the  existing  border  post  at  O'smach  is  not  adequate  to  handle  projected \ncross-border cargo and passenger traffic, as well as accommodate the requirements of the CBTA \nimplementation, new border checkpoint facilities will be constructed under this Project. \n \nThe increasing importance of bilateral transport and trade across the borders, as indicated \n8. \nby the increase in traffic and trade, demonstrates the strategic position of this Project in the GMS \ncontext. The Project road, National Road (NR) 56, along with NR 68 (see para. 24 regarding the \nproposed rehabilitation of NR 68 by Thailand), forms a link to the Southern Economic Corridor and \nwill also contribute to the rapidly increasing cross-border trade between Thailand and Cambodia. \nThe  rehabilitation  of  these  roads  will  provide  a  shorter  and  more  direct  route  between  Surin  and \nSiem Reap, reducing the route from 350 km to about 200 km. \n \nFor  trade  in  goods  (mostly  rice,  agricultural  products,  and  apparel),  14%  of  Cambodia's \n9. \nexports  went  across  the  border  into  Thailand  in  1996;  85%  of  imports  into  Cambodia  came  from \nThailand.  These  figures  increased  to  68%  of  exports  and  98%  of  imports  in  2007,  thus  clearly \ndemonstrating the significance of cross-border trade between the two  countries.  For  passengers, \ncross-border tourism between Thailand and Cambodia through the O'smach border checkpoint has \n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \nKingdom  of  Cambodia  and  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Southern  Coastal \nCorridor Project. Manila (Loans 2372-VIE and 2373-CAM). \n\n6  Implementation of this MOU on the exchange of traffic rights between Cambodia and Thailand will be supported by the \nprogress achieved recently for the exchange of traffic rights between Cambodia and Viet Nam. On 17 March 2009 in \nPhnom Penh the two countries signed an MOU on expanding the quota for vehicles for cross-border transport from 40 \nto  150.  ADB's  financing  from  the  ongoing  loan  (footnote  4)  to  construct  a  common  control  area  will  facilitate  the \nimplementation of the national single window inspection at Bavet by June 2010. \n\n7  The  CBTA  covers  all  aspects  of  cross-border  transport  facilitation,  including  (i)  single-stop/single-window  inspection; \n(ii) cross-border movement of persons; (iii) transit traffic regimes; (iv) requirements that road vehicles will have to meet \nto be eligible for cross-border traffic; (v) exchange of commercial traffic rights (i.e., ability of vehicles in one country to \nbe operated in the neighboring country\u2019s territory); and (vi) infrastructure, including road and bridge design standards, \nroad signs, and signals. \n\n8  \"Additional  roads  and  provinces  to  be  included  in  the  geographic  scope  of  application  of  the  MOU  shall  be  mutually \nagreed by the duly authorized representatives of the National Transport Facilitation Committees of the Parties to the \nMOU. This shall take effect no later than 30 days after the conclusion of such agreement, except otherwise agreed.\" \nPara. 2, Article 4 of the MOU. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\falso  been  increasing  in  recent  years;  in  2008,  the  number  of  people  crossing  this  border  at  this \npoint  increased  by  12%,  over  2007.  There  is  considerable  potential  for  cross-border  tourism \nbetween  the  northeastern  provinces  of  Thailand,  especially  Surin,  and  northwestern  Cambodia, \ni.e., Siem Reap, given the close cultural and historical relationship between the two areas. \n \nIn addition, since 2006, contract farming arrangements in the project area have increased. \n10. \nCurrently  there  are  17  such  farms  operated  by  Thai  farmers  cultivating  high-value  fruits\u2014such  as \navocado, mango, and banana\u2014which are transported to three major destinations: Bangkok (80%), \nSurin  (10%),  and  Phnom  Penh\u2013Ho  Chi  Minh  City  (10%).  As  of  2008  the  area  cultivated  is \napproximately 60,000 hectares (ha). This is expected to increase further with the rehabilitation of \nNR  68,  thus  promoting  cross-border  agricultural  trade  between  the  two  countries.  With  the \nproposed  border  facility  improvement  at  O'smach  and  implementation  of  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation measures through the O'smach\u2013Chong Chom border crossing, cross-border agricultural \ntrade  and  tourism  are  expected  to  further  expand  along  NR  56  and  NR  68,  as  has  been \ndemonstrated  by  the  improved  NR  5  and  NR  6  under  the  ongoing  Greater  Mekong  Subregion: \nCambodia  Road  Improvement  Project  (footnote  4)  leading  to  the  Poipet\u2013Aranyaprathet  border \ncrossing. \n \n11. \nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  rapidly  established  themselves  around  the \nO'smach area after the project preparatory TA got under way in 2005; there is about 200 of them \nnow,  most  of  them  trade  based,  although  entertainment  businesses  are  becoming  dominant  in \nscale. These SMEs and businesses are awaiting the completion of the Project road and the new \ncross-border facilities, for further investment opportunities. \n \n12. \nThe MPWT is in the process of shifting its focus away from managing day-to-day operations of \nthe  transport  sector  towards  planning  and  policy  administration  of  the  sector.  The  process  is \nprogressing  with  significant  support  from  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, but is encumbered by shortages of skills and resources at national and provincial \nlevels. The implementation regulations of the Traffic Law are expected to be approved by the Council \nof  Ministers  some  time  in  2009.  This  law  clearly  defines  the  responsibilities  and  establishes  a \nframework  for  managing  the  road  network,  allocating  resources,  and  regulating  the  services  of \ntransport  services  providers.  Considerable  progress  in  maintenance  of  the  national  roads  has  been \nmade since the establishment of the Interministerial Road Maintenance Committee in September 2006. \nThe committee is responsible for facilitating road maintenance in terms of prioritization of works, budget \nallocation, disbursement processes, and monitoring. While the Government has given greater attention \nto  road  maintenance,  more  could  be  done;  there  is  a  need  to  further  strengthen  and  streamline  the \nprocesses for road maintenance management. The proposed Project will supplement the sustainable \nmaintenance  works  program  initiated  in  the  ongoing  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Southern  Coastal \nCorridor Project (footnote 5) and the Road Asset Management Project (footnote 3) by providing further \nsupport  to  (i)  strengthen  the  road  maintenance  management  capacity  of  the  MPWT;  (ii)  strengthen \nlocal contractors and encourage the emergence of new private construction companies (from which the \nProject  will  benefit  in  future,  after  its  completion);  and  (iii)  improve  the  cost  efficiency  of  road \nmaintenance works. \n \n13. \nOverloaded cargo vehicles, spurred by the economic development and lack of equipment to \ncontrol vehicle axle loads, have become a major cause of premature deterioration of the national \nroad network during 2002\u20132006. The Government established the Working Group for Overloading \nControl  and  Management  in  2007,  and  an  action  plan  was  developed  in  July  2007  with  the \nassistance of the Japan International Cooperation Agency. ADB also supported this activity under \nthe  ongoing  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement  Project  (footnote  4)  by \nproviding  seven  permanent  weigh  stations  on  national  roads,  and  these  are  expected  to  be \noperational some time in 2009. Since this overloading control operation requires wider coverage to \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fbe  effective,  the  proposed  Project  will  provide  further  assistance  by  establishing  more  weigh \nstations along national roads. \n \n14. \nDeteriorating  road  safety  is  a  growing  concern;  Cambodia  has  one  of  the  highest \nincidences of road accidents in the world. In 2007, there were 18 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, an \nincrease  of  50%  from  2000.  This  is  more  than  double  the  incidence  of  fatalities  in  neighboring \nThailand  (6.5  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles).  Based  on  studies  carried  out  in  other  countries,  the \ncost  of  accidents  in  Cambodia  is  estimated  to  be  the  equivalent  of  1%\u20133%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct annually. Moreover, traffic accidents disproportionately impact on pedestrians and cyclists, \nwho  are  typically  from  the  poorer  levels  of  society.  Therefore,  for  economic  and  social  reasons, \nCambodia\u2019s worsening road safety situation needs to be addressed while it is still manageable. To \ncombat this issue, in 2004 the Government approved the National Road Safety Action Plan and in \n2005  established  the  National  Road  Safety  Council.  The  aim  is  to  combine  the  forces  of  all \nministries concerned to create cooperation and collaboration and to facilitate measures to prevent \nand  reduce  road  traffic  accidents.  ADB-financed  regional  TA 9  provided  assistance  to  the \npreparation  of  the  National  Road  Safety  Action  Plan, 10  and  ADB  is  currently  supporting  the \nimplementation of this action plan under the ongoing Road Asset Management Project (footnote 3). \nTo be sustainable, this action needs continuous support, and the proposed Project will provide this. \n \n15. \nSubregional  Strategy.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  10-Year  Strategic  Framework \n(2002\u20132012), endorsed by the leaders of the GMS countries during the First GMS Summit held in \nCambodia  in  2002,  identified  that  the  ultimate  objective  of  the  GMS  is  to  facilitate  sustainable \neconomic  growth,  improve  employment  opportunities,  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  subregion  by \ntapping  the  comparative  advantages  of  the  participating  countries.  ADB\u2019s  regional  cooperation \nstrategy and program update (2007\u20132009) for the GMS11 noted progress on the implementation of \nthe strategy and program update\u2019s strategic pillars that provide the backbone of ADB's assistance \ntowards  enhancing  connectivity,  improving  competitiveness,  and  engendering  a  greater  sense  of \ncommunity  in  the  GMS.  The  GMS  Transport  Sector  Strategy  for  2006\u2013201512 intends  to  develop \nseamless transport services on a fully connected and integrated GMS transport network. \n \n16. \nUnder  this  strategy,  the  GMS  Southern  Economic  Corridor  (SEC)  was  identified  by  the \nGMS  countries  as  one  of  the  three  priority  projects  under  the  economic  corridor  approach  which \nthey  adopted  in  1998.  The  development  of  the  SEC  was  subsequently  designated  as  a  flagship \ninitiative  under  the  aforementioned  10-year  GMS  strategic  framework.  The  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion:  Cambodia  Northwest  Provincial  Roads  Improvement  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the \nSEC. It will provide a link between Thailand and Cambodia, and will connect with the main corridor \nlinking  Bangkok,  Phnom  Penh,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  and  Vung  Tau.  The  Project  will  assist  in \nachieving the goals of the GMS Transport Sector  Strategy of (i) moving towards an open market \nand open borders for transport services, and (ii) improving economic efficiency to reduce transport \ncosts. Details of this are given in Appendix 3. \n \nADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy. The pillars of the country strategy and program for Cambodia13 \n17. \nare  (i)  sustainable  pro-poor  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social  development,  and  (iii)  good \ngovernance and improved public service delivery. This Project will feed into all three strategic goals \nby  focusing  on  (i)  increasing  the  reach  and  reliability  of  transport  networks  in  rural  areas  to  spur \n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2002.

The  improvement  of  the  Project's  roads  will  support \nbroader  development  objectives,  principally  to  facilitate  (i)  the  movement  of  agricultural  products \nfrom surplus to deficit areas, (ii) the flow of consumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, \nand  (iii)  the  marketing  and  export  of  cash  crops  and  other  produce.  The  Project  will  meet  the \nGovernment's objective of completing the improvement of its road network system, particularly with \nregard to facilitating trade and improving access to neighboring countries. \n \n18. \nExternal Assistance. Most of the assistance to Cambodia\u2019s road sector has been directed \nto restoring a basic level of access to as much of the country as possible through rehabilitation of \nthe  primary  road  network.  Major  development  partners  in  the  road  sector  include  ADB;  the \ngovernments of Australia, the People's Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, \nand  Viet  Nam;  and  the  World  Bank.  A  list  of  external  assistance  to  Cambodia's  road  sector  is \nprovided in Appendix 4. ADB has approved seven transport projects for Cambodia, four of which \nare in the road sector. \n \n19. \nLessons.  The  country  portfolio  reviews  have  noted  that  there  have  been  implementation \ndelays  in  previous  road  projects,  especially  during  the  project  start-up  phase.  The  advanced \nprocurement action will be used for the recruitment of consultants in order to shorten the start-up \nphase. As delays in recruiting consultants or preparing detailed designs have led directly to delays \nin implementation of civil works, ADB will assist the Government in preparing terms of reference for \nthe  detailed  design  and  implementation  consultant,  who  will  be  tasked  with  (i)  preparing  detailed \nengineering  designs  and  bidding  documents  for  the  procurement  of  civil  works,  and  (ii)  providing \nassistance with the supervision of civil works. Delays have also been caused on past projects by \ninadequate resettlement planning and discrepancies in resettlement policy requirements between \nADB and the Government. For this Project, meaningful consultation with affected households will \nbe  undertaken  to  ensure  that  impacts  and  special  needs  of  poor  and  vulnerable  households  are \nproperly  identified,  and  that  suitable  rehabilitation  measures  are  in  place  to  avoid,  or  at  least \nminimize,  disruption  to  peoples'  socioeconomic  activities  and  social  networks.  Other  potential \nadverse  impacts  of  road  projects\u2014including  transmission  of  HIV/AIDS,  trafficking  of  women  and \nchildren, and environmental impacts\u2014will be mitigated under the HIV prevention and anti-human-\ntrafficking program of this Project. \n \nA  recent  project  performance  evaluation  report 14 has  identified  lessons  in  the  areas  of \n20. \nCBTA provisions, road maintenance, and road safety. This Project addresses all these three in a \nsystematic  manner  through  its  components.  First,  concerning  CBTA,  ongoing  projects  of  the \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement  Project  (footnote  4)  and  Greater \nMekong  Subregion:  Southern  Coastal  Corridor  Project  (footnote  5)  have  focused  efforts  on \nimproving  cross-border  facilities  between  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam,  while  facilitating  bilateral \nagreements.  This  Project  will  further  assist  these  efforts  with  the  improvement  of  cross-border \nfacilities  at  O'smach.  Second,  for  road  maintenance,  the  Project  supports  the  MPWT-wide \nmaintenance  regime  reforms  initiated  under  the  Road  Asset  Management  Project  (footnote  3), \nunder  a  strengthened  strategy  of  increasing  road  maintenance  budget  allocations  by  the \nGovernment. This also functions as a boost to the institutional reform agenda of the MPWT of the \nGreater Mekong Subregion: Cambodia Road Improvement Project (footnote 4). Finally, the Project \nfurther  supplements  the  nationwide  road  safety  interventions  supported  under  the  Road  Asset \nManagement Project (footnote 3) through a road safety component. \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2008.

That is, when rehabilitated, the \nroad  will  provide  (i)  reliable  all-year  access  from  provincial  towns  and  rural  areas  to  markets, \nemployment, and social services such as advanced health and education facilities; and (ii) access \nto historical and natural cultural sites in the area. This increased access in northwestern Cambodia \nwill indirectly improve agricultural and other industrial production by enabling more direct routes to \ninternational  border  crossings.  It  can  also  form  the  basis  for  development  of  the  tourism  industry \nwithin Cambodia, and between Thailand and Cambodia. \n \nThe outcome of the Project will be increased transport efficiency in northwestern Cambodia. \n22. \nThe Project will rehabilitate a major link of secondary national roads in northwestern Cambodia into \na reliable, safe, and economically efficient link between the rural roads networks and the primary \nnational roads network. \n \nB. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nRoad Improvements \n\n \n23. \nUnder the Project, 113 km of provincial NR 56 from Sisophon to Samraong will be improved \nfrom  an  existing  gravel  surface  to  an  all-weather  bitumen  standard,  and  a  cross-border  facility  at \nO'smach on the border with Thailand will be constructed. At Sisophon the project road meets with the \nprimary NR 5. At Samraong (the capital of Oddar Meanchey province) NR 56 joins with NR 68, which \ncontinues north to the border with Thailand at O'smach. \n \n24. \nNR 68 is a gravel road and certainly serviceable, thus the connection of NR 56 to O'smach \nborder is functional. Rehabilitating the NR 68 along its entire length from Kralanh to O'smach was \napproved by the prime minister of Thailand in March 2009, and this work may start in 2010. This \nwill then be in parallel with the NR 56 rehabilitation work, thus the development objectives of the \nroad network will be maximized, with completion of each road expected at around the same time. \n \n25. \nThe road improvement works are divided into three subprojects: (i) NR 56A from Sisophon \nto km 29 (29 km); (ii) NR 56B from km 29 to Samraong (84 km); and (iii) the cross-border facility at \nO'smach (para. 28). Under the Greater Mekong Subregion: Cambodia Road Improvement Project \n(footnote 4), 38 pre-stressed concrete bridges and some box and pipe culverts were constructed. \nThis  completes  the  requirement  for  bridgeworks  on  NR  56,  but  two  7  meter  (m)-wide  bridges  on \nNR  56  will  be  widened  to  10  m  under  this  Project  to  meet  the  standard  adopted  for  the  project \nroads. The existing road is located in predominantly flat open terrain, and the road surface is either \ngravel or earth and has extremely high road roughness values. The existing road is often too low \nand thus is frequently flooded in the wet season, preventing access. \n \n26. \nGenerally, the existing alignment of NR 56 will be retained; however, a realignment will be \ncarried  out  to  bypass  the  Banteay  Chhmar  temple.  A  royal  decree  protects  the  temple,  and  the \nsurrounding area has a series of protective zones which severely restrict the improvement of NR \n56. The realignment will avoid these zones. The 11-km realignment increases the overall length of \nNR 56 by approximately 0.5 km. Access to Banteay Chhmar is retained on the existing alignment \nof NR 56 and by an existing access road from this realignment. \n \n27. \nThe risk of unexploded ordnance principally from minefields, in the project area, is severe. \nMinefields totaling 89 km alongside the project roads have been identified. The Project provides for \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nclearance of the entire right of way. \n \n\n2. \n\nImprovement of the Cross-Border Facility at O'smach \n\n28. \nThe  cross-border  facilities  at  O'smach  are  inadequate  (para.  7).  New  facilities  will  be \nconstructed to meet GMS requirements and will be suitable for one-stop processing. The design is \nbased on the cross-border facility provided at Bavet on NR 1 under the Greater Mekong Subregion: \nPhnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project.15 The site will be located at the southern end of \nan  existing  0.9  km  concrete  pavement,  which  will  then  extend  to  the  border  gate  with  shopping \noutlets  located  to  the  east  and  a  hotel  on  each  side  of  the  road.  The  site  for  the  facility  is \napproximately  4  ha,  extending  on  both  sides  of  NR  68.  Truck  and  cargo  processing  will  be \nseparated  from  private  vehicle  and  bus  movements.  The  improvement  will  also  provide  new \nfacilities for the border agencies. \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Maintenance Program \n\n29. \nThe  MPWT  manages  the  primary  network  of  11,400  km.  Recent  investments  have  led  to \nthe improvement of 2,500 km of roads in this network to paved road standard. The preservation of \nthese  assets  brings  with  it  the  necessity  for  improving  the  capability  for  road  management  and \nmaintenance.  Historically,  road  maintenance  has  been  carried  out  by  the  departments  of  MPWT \nunder force accounting, but an expanding network brings with it a need for increased management \ncapability  and  increased  competence  within  the  private  sector,  especially  to  carry  out  periodic \nmaintenance.  The  Road  Asset  Management  Project  (footnote  3)  addresses  these  issues,  with \nMPWT road maintenance budget also increasing yearly and the institutional arrangements in place \nto support it. \n \n30. \nThe  work  proposed  under  this  Project  will  complement  the  aforementioned  intervention \nthrough axle load control. An essential element of road management is to increase the capability \nfor  axle  load  control  to  ensure  the  planned  durability  of  the  network  is  achieved.  The  Project \nprovides  the  services  of  an  asset  management  expert  within  detailed  design  and  implementation \nsupervision  (DDIS)  consultants'  contract.  The  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  developing  an \neffective axle load control program to support the ongoing MPWT comprehensive overload control \nprogram. Thus the road maintenance program will include the provision of equipment for axle load \ncontrol through some permanent weigh stations at strategic locations on the national road network. \nThe overall program will be developed during the early stages of the Project to efficiently support \nthe aforementioned ongoing interventions. \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety Program \n\n31. \nUnfortunately,  Cambodia  has  an  extremely  high  accident  rate  that  is  three  times  that  of \nother  countries  in  the  region.  The  Project  includes  a  component  to  address  this  problem  through \nthe provision of a road safety agency or firm which will develop a road safety program in concert \nwith existing programs in Cambodia. This will support implementation of the newly enacted Traffic \nLaw and be a part of the ongoing National Road Safety Action Plan. Within the program, practical \nsolutions will be delivered, including public awareness of the traffic law, road user competence and \neducation,  and  vulnerability  awareness  both  within  the  project  area  and  nationally.  Importantly,  it \nwill  also  address  the  role  of  the  civil  engineering  community  in  reducing  the  accident  rates  with \nclear guidance on adherence to good, safe, road design, construction, and maintenance practice. \nTherefore,  the  road  safety  program  of  the  Project  will  mainly  include  enhancing  road  user \neducation  in  the  project  area  and  nationwide,  public  awareness  campaigns,  the  provision  of \n                                                 \n15 ADB.  1998.

Local  communities  along  the  road  reported  HIV  prevalence  to  be  highest \namong the wives of migrant workers and military personnel, emphasizing the facilitating role played \nby  migration  and  mobility  in  the  spread  of  HIV.  Migration  to  seek  seasonal  or  long-term  work  in \nThailand or other provinces is a mode of survival for many Cambodians, but the steady supply of \nmigrant workers willing to cross the border has sustained human trafficking activities in the project \nareas.  The  border  dispute  over  the  Preah  Vihear  temple  has  also  resulted  in  the  increased \npresence  of  soldiers  along  the  border  areas  and  new  recruitment  of  soldiers  from  the  local \ncommunities.  With  the  rehabilitation  of  NR  56  and  NR  68,  there  will  be  a  large  influx  of  migrant \nworkers that may increase the demand for paid (and unpaid) sexual services in the local areas. \n \nRecognizing that the road construction may exacerbate the spread of HIV and increase the \n33. \npotential  for  human  trafficking  in  the  project  areas,  the  Project  includes  implementation  of  an \nintegrated  prevention  and  risk  mitigation  package  as  part  of  the  road  project  design.16 The  Project \naims to strengthen ongoing interventions, including the Greater Mekong Subregion: Cambodia Road \nImprovement  Project  (footnote  4)  and  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Southern  Coastal  Corridor \nProject (footnote 5), to address HIV/AIDS and human trafficking issues along the road corridors. \n \n34. \nThe outcome of the HIV prevention and anti-human-trafficking program will be reduced HIV \ntransmission  and  prevalence  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  among  workers  and  communities \nassociated  with  the  road  project.  There  will  be  four  outputs:  (i)  a  community-based  risk  mitigation \npackage  for  HIV,  safe  migration,  and  anti-human-trafficking  targeting  females  including  married \nwomen; (ii) focused HIV initiatives in the work setting, particularly for the construction workforce and \nentertainment workers, and enforcement education for military personnel, border police, and officials; \n(iii) strengthened district sexual and reproductive health services; and (iv) a rigorous monitoring and \nevaluation  system.  The  anti-human-trafficking  program  will  focus  on  safe  migration  and  linking  the \npoor to different poverty reduction programs in the area (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n35. \nImprovement  of  Provincial  Road  Network.  This  is  the  first  large  intervention  of  ADB  in \nrehabilitating the secondary national road network (i.e., the provincial road network) in Cambodia. \nThe Project is expected to provide linkage between the paved national primary road network and \nrural  areas  with  improved  provincial  roads.  This  will  then  trigger  more  balanced  and  improved \ntransport  efficiency  in  the  provincial  road  network  serving  the  agricultural  communities  of \nnorthwestern Cambodia. The Project will also be an important precursor to improving the rural road \nnetwork in future interventions. This is in urgent in need of rehabilitation as indicated by seasonal \nroad network closures. \n \nHIV  Prevention  and  Anti-Human-Trafficking  Program.  The  Project  will  have  a  novel \n36. \napproach  that  focuses  not  only  on  the  NR  56  road  corridor  but  also  includes  the  entire \nnorthwestern  area  of  Cambodia.  This  program  is  designed  to  supplement  the  national  HIV/AIDS \nprevention program of the Ministry of Health, which is funded by several agencies. An anti-human-\n                                                 \n16 This Program aims to strengthen and scale up previous HIV prevention initiatives in the project area, especially from \nsubprojects 5 and 9 under: ADB. 2008.

The Government will also request the \nGovernment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  to  provide  $25.58  million  equivalent  in  cofinancing  for  the \nProject,  provided  through  the  Export  Import  Bank  of  Korea  (KEXIM).  It  is  proposed  that  ADB \nprovide a loan of $16.26 million from its Special Funds resources to cover 34% of the total cost of \nthe Project. ADB will finance rehabilitation of 29 km of NR 56 (subproject [i] of para. 25), and the \ncross-border facility at O'smach (subproject [iii] of para. 25), plus the consulting services of DDIS, \nroad  maintenance,  road  safety,  and  HIV  prevention  and  anti-human-trafficking  programs.  KEXIM \nwill finance 53.4% of the total project cost, to cover rehabilitation of 84 km of NR 56 (subproject [ii] \nof para. 25) and provision of equipment for the cross-border facility. The Government, from its own \nresources,  will  meet  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  the  Project,  which  is  $6.05  million \nequivalent  amounting  to  12.6%  of  the  total  project  cost.  This  will  cover  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement costs and taxes and duties. \n \n39. \nThe Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. For the ADB loan, the repayment period of \nthe proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. This interest during construction will be financed \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nby the ADB loan. The proceeds of the loan will be made available by the Borrower to the MWPT \n(as  the  executing  agency)  through  budgetary  allocations.  The  ADB  loans  will  fund  ADB-financed \ncivil  works,  consulting  services,  and  equipment  totaling  $16.26  million.  KEXIM  will  finance  the \nProject on tied-parallel basis. This loan will have a fixed interest rate of 0.01% per annum and a 40 \nyears maturity, including a 15 years grace period. After the signing of the loan agreement, the loan \namount  will  be  denominated  in  won  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  the  US  dollar  amount. \nCounterpart funds will be allocated for land acquisition and resettlement, and taxes and duties. The \nfinancing plan is presented in Table 2 (see also Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea \nGovernment of Cambodia \n \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n16.26 \n25.58 \n6.05 \n\n47.89 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n34.0 \n53.4 \n12.6 \n\n100.0 \n\n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n40. \nThe MPWT will be the executing agency for the Project with responsibility for procurement, \nwithdrawal of loan proceeds, engagement and direction of consultants, acting as the employer for \nall  contracts  (including  coordination  between  contractors  and  consultants  financed  by  two \nfinanciers),  and  reporting  to  ADB.  Responsibilities  for  planning  and  implementation  will  be \ndelegated  to  Project  Management  Unit  No  3  (PMU-3)  under  the  General  Department  of  Public \nWorks  as  the  implementing  agency  for  the  Project.  The  MPWT  and  PMU-3  have  experience  of \nADB requirements and have performed satisfactorily on past projects. \n \n41. \nThe  interministerial  resettlement  committee  (IRC)  will  recruit  an  independent  resettlement \nmonitor  to  monitor  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans.  The  PMU-3  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for implementation of the environmental management plan (EMP) during the design \nand construction stages. EMP requirements will be incorporated into the construction documents. \nMonitoring  and  enforcement  will  be  ensured  by  the  PMU-3  with  the  assistance  of  the  DDIS \nconsultant.  The  Social  and  Environmental  Unit  of  the  Department  of  Planning  will  monitor  EMP \narrangements and activities. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nThe  implementation  period  for  the  Project  is  4  years  from  2010  to  2013  inclusive.  The \n42. \nimplementation  schedule  is  given  in  Appendix  6.  Advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  the  DDIS \nconsultants was initiated in June 2009; the consultant will begin services at the end of April 2010. \nDetailed  design  and  bidding  documents  for  the  first  civil  works  package  (NR  56)  will  commence \nimmediately  once  the  consultant  is  recruited.  The  contract  for  civil  works  for  NR  56  will  begin \nmobilization in September 2011 and works will be active from November 2011. The detailed design \nand implementation consultant will assist the IRC and PMU-3 to ensure completion of resettlement \nactivities before commencement of civil works. The construction period is 21 months and works will \nbe complete by the end of July 2013. The detailed design and bidding documents for each of the \nother  two  civil  works  contract  packages  will  be  undertaken  in  a  timely  and  efficient  manner  such \nthat the civil works packages may be undertaken as shown in the implementation schedule. \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n43. \nProcurement of all works financed by ADB will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  implementing  agency  in  Cambodia,  the \nPMU-3,  is  familiar  with  ADB  procurement  requirements.  Under  the  improvement  of  road \ninfrastructure and the cross-border facility components, two civil works contracts will be procured \nusing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Other  smaller  contracts  (less  than  $1  million) \nmay  be  procured  under  national  competitive  bidding  procedures,  and  those  less  than  $100,000 \nthrough the shopping procedure. For the KEXIM-financed contracts, the procurement methods of \nKEXIM  will  apply.  As  the  KEXIM  loan  is  on  tied-parallel  basis,  KEXIM  will  select  a  Korean \ncontractor(s) for such contracts. The Procurement Plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n44. \nFor  all  consulting  services  funded  from  ADB  loan  funds,  international  and  national \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Government  of  Cambodia  understands \nthat advance action for the recruitment of consultants does not commit ADB to finance the planned \nproject. \n \n45. \nConsultants  for  the  Project  will  be  recruited  under  two  packages\u2014one  for  ADB-financed \nconsulting works and the other for KEXIM-financed consulting works. Since the KEXIM loan is on \ntied-parallel  basis,  KEXIM  will  select  a  Korean  consultant  for  such  consulting  works.  The  total \nnumber  of  person-months  for  the  DDIS  consultant  under  ADB-financed  packages  is  estimated  at \n346,  comprising  69  person-months  from  international  experts  and  277  person-months  from \nnational experts. In addition, an international road safety consulting firm or agency will be recruited \nfor the road safety program, and a firm or a nongovernment organization will be recruited for the \nHIV prevention and anti-human-trafficking program. The outline terms of reference for consultants \nare in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n46. \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records \nand  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n47. \nThe  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \ntransparency, in addition to the standard ADB requirements. The project design includes measures \nto build capacity within the MPWT so that staff understand and comply with ADB and Government \nprocedures as outlined in the project administration manual. A project website will be developed to \ndisclose information about project matters, including procurement. With regard to procurement, the \nwebsite  will  include  information  on,  among  other  things,  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of \nthe  winning  bidder,  basic  details  of  bidding  procedures  adopted,  the  amount  of  the  contract \nawarded, and the list of goods and services procured. A grievance redress mechanism will be set \nup to encourage more stakeholder vigilance and ensure greater accountability. It will receive and \nresolve  complaints  and  act  upon  stakeholders\u2019  reports  of  irregularities  on  matters  relating  to  the \nProject, including grievances arising from resettlement. The MPWT will publicize the existence of \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nthis mechanism widely to ensure that stakeholders are aware that there is a venue to address their \nconcerns or grievances relating to fraud, corruption, or abuse in project implementation. \n \n\n6.  \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nDisbursements from the ADB loan for contracts for consulting services and civil works bid \n48. \nunder  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  through  direct  payment  procedures \ndefined  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements for incremental expenditures and shopping will be through an imprest account. The \nMinistry of Economy and Finance will establish one imprest account for the ADB loan. The Ministry \nof  Economy  and  Finance  and  the  MPWT,  which  have  sufficient  past  experience  in  administering \nADB-funded project accounts, will jointly administer the imprest account by means of arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. This joint administration of one imprest account is successfully demonstrated \nin the Greater Mekong Subregion: Cambodia Road Improvement Project (footnote 4). The imprest \naccount ceiling will be based on estimated expenditures to be paid from the imprest account for 6 \nmonths  of  project  implementation  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  less.  The  imprest \naccount will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Borrower and ADB. \nStatement of expenditure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances to \nthe  imprest  accounts  to  ensure  speedy  project  implementation.  The  ceiling  for  statements  of \nexpenditure will be $50,000 per payment. For the KEXIM loan, the disbursements will be made to \nthe  consultant  and  the  contractor  in  won  through  a  separate  imprest  account.  Arrangements  for \ndisbursement  of  funds  made  available  from  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  loan  will \nfollow the Republic of Korea procedures. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n49. \nThe MPWT will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received,  the  expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. The accounts for all project expenditures will be \nset  up  in  accordance  with  consistent  and  sound  accounting  principles.  Independent  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements \nannually. Unaudited accounts and financial statements will be submitted to ADB within 3 months, \nand audited accounts and financial statements not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal \nyear  to  which  they  relate.  This  will  include  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  (i)  the  use  of  the  imprest \naccount, and (ii) the use of statement of expenditure procedures. \n \nThe DDIS consultant will submit monthly progress reports to the MPWT and ADB. The MPWT \n50. \nwill ensure that in the reports the consultant includes progress on civil works and disbursement, and the \nstatus of land acquisition, resettlement, environmental management, training, and any other activities \nidentified in the terms of reference agreed upon with the DDIS consultant. \n \n51.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  civil  works,  the  MPWT  will  request  the \nconstruction supervision consultant to submit a project completion report in a format acceptable to \nthe  MPWT  and  ADB.  The  MPWT  will  monitor  project  preparation  and  implementation  in \naccordance  with  the  implementation  schedule,  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant \ndeviations that could result in the schedule not being met. The form and content of the report will \nbe in a format agreed upon with ADB during further processing of the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n52. \n\nThe MPWT, assisted by the consultants, will establish project performance monitoring and \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nevaluation  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB's  guidelines17 and  integrate  it  with  the  existing \nmanagement  information  system.  Ongoing  ADB  TA  is  currently  focusing  on  such  impact \nmonitoring.18 The Project will use indicators from this TA to set up a framework for monitoring and \nevaluation of impacts. Within 12 months of ADB loan effectiveness, the MPWT will conduct surveys \nto establish baseline data for subsequent performance monitoring. A second round of surveys will \nbe  carried  out  before  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project,  and  a  third  round  will  be  carried  out  6 \nmonths before project completion. The baseline and impact surveys will include appropriate control \nareas and will assess all interventions under the Project. The main sources of data will include, but \nnot be limited to, (i) secondary data from the Borrower\u2019s sources, (ii) traffic counts, (iii) freight and \npassenger  surveys,  and  (iv)  traffic  accident  statistics.  In  addition,  a  set  of  indicators  reflecting \ntransport costs, tariffs, and mobility will be developed to assess the effects of the improved roads. \nThe  MPWT  will  submit  a  report  to  ADB  summarizing  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  at  inception, \nmidterm review, and project completion. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n53. \nRegular  6-monthly  reviews  will  be  undertaken  jointly  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  KEXIM \n(as appropriate). In addition, the MPWT and staff of ADB and KEXIM will jointly undertake a midterm \nreview  in  about  mid-2012  to  assess  (i)  the  status  of  implementation,  (ii)  the  performance  of \nconsultants and contractors, (iii) the impacts of the Project, (iv) the progress of implementation, (v) \nthe status of compliance with the loan covenants stipulated in the loan agreement, and (vi) the need \nfor any changes in the project scope or schedule to achieve the Project\u2019s impact and objectives. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n54. \nThe  Project  will  provide  efficient  all-weather  access  to  the  rural  areas  in  two  provinces  in \nnorthwestern Cambodia, to the provincial and commercial centers of Sisophon and Samraong, and \nto  Poipet  (Cambodia\u2019s  primary  border  crossing  point  with  Thailand).  The  Project  will  promote \neconomic  growth  through  increased  agricultural  production,  tourism  around  the  many  historic \ntemples  throughout  the  project  area,  national  and  subregional  trade,  and  local  employment \ncreation,  which  will  help  combat  widespread  poverty,  especially  in  the  rural  areas.  By  reducing \nroad  transport  costs  and  improving  access  reliability,  the  Project  will  generate  substantial  direct \neconomic benefits from future savings in vehicle operating costs, logistics, and road maintenance. \nIt  will  also  relieve  the  isolation  of  remote  rural  areas  by  reducing  travel  costs  and  time,  and  by \neliminating seasonal disruption of traffic during the wet season, thus enabling continuous trade and \neconomic exchange and undisrupted access to schools, health services, and other services in rural \nareas.  Finally,  the  Project  will  enhance  the  impact  of  the  Northwestern  Rural  Development \nProject19 by providing crucial interconnection of rural road networks, without which the country will \nremain  fragmented  and  the  rural  roads  will,  at  best,  lead  to  small  provincial  towns,  isolating  the \npoor population and limiting the benefits of trade available to them. The main benefits of the Project \nare directly related to traffic, including (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) savings in vehicle and \npassenger  time  costs,  and  (iii)  benefits  from  traffic  generated  by  the  reduction  in  transport  costs. \nAdditional benefits derived from generated traffic include (i) producer surplus benefits; (ii) additional \ntourism-related  income;  (iii)  additional  income  from  the  increased  agricultural  activity  stemming \nfrom  the  rehabilitation  of  the  road;  and  (iv)  social  benefits  arising  from  better  access  to  schools, \nmedical  facilities,  and  other  social  services.  Derived  subregional  benefits  that  have  not  been \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2007. Guidelines for Preparing a Design and Monitoring Framework.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nKingdom of Cambodia for the Northwestern Rural Development Project. Manila (Loan 1862-CAM). \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\ninitial \n\ninvestment  costs, \n\ninvestment  by  considering \n\nquantified are long term, and are associated with the road\u2019s contribution to increased integration of \nthe  economies  of  Thailand  and  Cambodia,  which  will  enable  the  establishment  of new  and  more \nefficient trading and transport patterns in the subregion. \n \n55. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project was calculated by comparing the \nwith-project and without-project situations for the project roads. The economic analysis was carried \nout  using  the  highway  development  and  management  tool  (HDM-4).  The  model  evaluates  the \nproject \nfuture  periodic  and  recurrent \nmaintenance costs, and the future benefits derived from savings in road user costs. The project life \nafter  completion  was  taken  to  be  20  years.  The  EIRR  for  the  proposed  Project  is  estimated  at \n19.9%, indicating that the Project is economically viable. Sensitivity tests were performed for four \nscenarios:  project  benefits  decrease  by  20%,  project  costs  increase  by  20%,  fuel  prices  (which \nwere volatile in 2008) decrease by 65% (which essentially is mid-2009 price level), and generated \nsubregional  traffic  to  and  from  Thailand  does  not  materialize,  i.e.,  it  decreases  by  100%.  The \nsensitivity  analysis  shows  that,  in  all  cases,  the  EIRR  remains  above  19%.  Calculation  of  cutoff \nvalues  (the  value  of  a  sensitivity  parameter  where  the  Project's  EIRR  reaches  the  cutoff  rate  of \n12%) showed that benefits could reduce by 55% and costs increase by 122% before the Project \nwould become economically unviable. Meaningful cutoff values for fuel cost and subregional traffic \ncannot  be  determined  since  the  calculation  yields  a  negative  number.  The  robustness  of  the \nProject was confirmed by performing stochastic risk analysis, which indicates that the overall risk of \nthe  Project's  EIRR  falling  below  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%  is  1.8%.  The  economic  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 8. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Impacts \n\n1. \n\nResettlement Impacts \n\n \n56. \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  category  A  on  involuntary  resettlement.  It  will  affect  an \nestimated  310  households,  of  which  110  are  households  headed  by  women  and  about  9  are \nhouseholds headed by the elderly and/or a person with a disability. The other 200 households are \nseverely  affected  due  to  impacts  on  their  houses  and/or  shops,  and  23  of  these  households  are \nlandless.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  developed  taking  into  account  the  types,  characteristics, \nand  severity  of  project  impacts  on  assets,  living  conditions,  and  vulnerability  of  the  affected \npopulation.  The  resettlement  strategy  is  geared  towards  ensuring  that  the  affected  households  will \nhave a place to rebuild their homes and continue with their livelihood activities. The MPWT through \nits  PMU-3  and  the  IRC  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  project  resettlement  strategy  is \ncarried  out  diligently.  An  updated  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  during  detailed  design  since \ninformation on impacts is incomplete at this stage. A summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 9 and \nthe full resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n \n57. \nThe  rehabilitation  of  NR  56  will  strengthen  the  link  between  rural  roads  under  the \nNorthwestern  Rural  Development  Project  (footnote  19)  and  the  national  roads.  By  improving \nlinkages  of different  road  networks,  the  Project  will  have  an  indirect impact  on  poverty  reduction. \nKey impacts of the Project include higher prices for produce and a wider span of marketing options \nfor  agricultural  produce  and  increased  opportunity  for  trade  to  reduce  food  shortages.  Access  to \nNR 5 and NR 6, a main trade route with growing markets, will further increase the ability of farmers \nto  reach  a  variety  of  markets.  All-weather  access  along  NR  56  and  into the  target  villages  of  the \nNorthwestern Rural Development Project will reduce the costs of accessing social services such as \nhealth  care  and  education.  The  effectiveness  of  government  and  other  agencies  in  providing \nservices  will  significantly  improve  as  both  feeder  roads  and  the  NR  56  are  improved.  Increased \naccess to these areas will facilitate a more effective outreach for organizations engaged in direct \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\npoverty reduction efforts. The most immediate impact of the proposed project includes employment \nopportunities  for  the  poor  during  road  construction  and  road  maintenance,  and  thus  will  reduce \nseasonal migration to Thailand. \n \n58. \nCommon  diseases  of  the  project  area  included  dengue  fever,  malaria,  colds,  polio,  and \nwhooping cough. Also, there seems to have been an increase in road accidents on NR 5 and NR \n6, where improvements are almost complete. The local communities in the proposed project area \nare very concerned about safety given the experience with NR 5 and NR 6. A community-based road \nsafety program is included in the road safety program of the Project. \n \n59. \nNational  HIV  Situation.  Cambodia  has  made  good  progress  in  containing  the  HIV \nepidemic, with HIV prevalence falling from 1.2% in 2003 to an estimated 0.9% in 2006. The decline \nhas  been  attributed  to  the  100%  Condom  Use  Program  and  safe-sex  campaigns  that  have \ntargeted sex workers and their clients.20 However, a second wave of HIV infections is being seen \namong most-at-risk populations, including indirect female sex workers,21 clients of sex workers and \ntheir  partners,  men  who  have  sex  with  men,  and  injecting  drug  users. 22  The  confluence  of \nunprotected paid sex and sharing contaminated needles during drug use is flagged as a key driver \nin the current epidemic. According to 2006 data, HIV prevalence among injecting drug users tested \nwas at 14.3%.23 As male clients of sex workers also have sex with their wives and girlfriends, more \ntraditionally low-risk women are increasingly getting infected. In 2006, among the total number of \npeople  living  with  HIV,  52%  were  estimated  to  be  women  compared  to  37%  in  1998.  In  2005, \nmarried women accounted for almost half of new infections.24 \n \n60. \nLocal HIV Situation. Despite the significant progress made nationally, there are increasing \nrisks of HIV epidemic in parts of the country. NR 56 and NR 68 are in a region of the country with \none of the highest HIV rates (Banteay Meanchey is considered one of the areas with the highest \nHIV  rates  in  the  country).  Local  communities  interviewed  reported  HIV  prevalence  to  be  highest \namong the housewives of migrant workers and military personnel, emphasizing the facilitating role \nof migration and mobility in the spread of HIV.  25 In the Srey Snam district along NR 68, cases of \nsexually  transmitted  infections  are  highest  among  wives  of  migrant  workers  and  uniformed \npersonnel  (military  and  police). 26  In  Oddar  Meanchey,  based  on  a  local  nongovernment \norganization providing home-based care, people living with HIV in the area can be categorized into \nthree  groups:  former  military  soldiers  (30%),  former  migrant  workers  in  Thailand  (30%),  and  in-\nmigrants  from  other  provinces  that were  HIV  positive  prior  to  moving  to  Oddar  Meanchey  (40%). \nThe  prevalence  of  sexually  transmitted  infection  is  high\u2014one  commune  reported  a  20% \nprevalence among the total female adult population (15\u201349 years old). At the O'smach border, two \nThai-owned  casinos  operate  that  encourage  sex  oriented  entertainment.  The  National  AIDS \nAuthority reported that O'smach used to be the fourth-largest commercial sex hotspot in Cambodia \nbefore  the  border  dispute  escalated,  and  hence  it  should  be  included  in  the  HIV  intervention.  In \nBanteay  Meanchey,  HIV  prevalence  is  highest  among  migrant  workers,  military  personnel,  and \ntheir spouses or partners, and is concentrated in the towns of Sisophon and Poipet. \n                                                 \n20  Annual  reports  of  National  AIDS  Authority  for  2005  and  2006,  and  National  Centre  for  HIV/AIDS,  Dermatology  and \n\nSTDs. 2007.

Technical Assistance for \n\nHIV Prevention and Infrastructure: Mitigating Risk in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila (TA 6467-REG). \n\n26  The  disproportionate  number  of  women  with  sexually  transmitted  infections  is  because  men  rarely  seek  sexual  and \n\nreproductive health services in community health centers, but instead self-medicate or go to other districts. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\n \nHuman Trafficking. According to the Banteay Meanchey police force, human trafficking is \n61. \na  big  concern  in  the  area.  Cambodians  are  being  illegally  traded  into  Thailand's  sex  industry, \nfishing  vessels,  factories,  and  private  homes,  in  debt  bondage  or  physically  unable  to  escape.27 \nSeveral  syndicates  and  cartels  operate  in  the  area,  kidnapping  people  and  selling  and/or  trading \nthem  to  Thailand  or  elsewhere.  However,  it  is  important  to  understand  that  many  people  who \neventually end up being trafficked started out as willing migrants, who plan or pay others to assist \nthem  to  illegally  cross  the  border, but  then  find  themselves  in  exploitative  and  physically  abusive \nlabor  environments  once  outside  Cambodia.  Unsafe  migration  is  a  key  factor  that  can  lead  to \nhuman trafficking and/or high-risk settings for the transmission of HIV. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n \nThe Project will provide all-weather access to remote and poorly serviced rural areas and \n62. \nwill result in reduced dust emission from unpaved roads. Roadside vegetation in the project area \nconsists of rice crops and mixed dipterocarp and woodland vegetation interspersed among paddy \nareas. There are no primary forests in the project area. \n \n63. \nNR 56 runs within the Banteay Chhmar Protected Landscape (BCPL), which consists of flat \nplains covered by degraded dry dipterocarp and open woodland forest. The BCPL was declared a \nprotected area by royal decree in 1993 and includes a narrow strip (about 500 m wide) to the east \nof NR 56 such that it is a part of the protected area. It should be noted, however, that development \nalong NR 56 within the BCPL has led to removal of woodland forest for about 1 km on either side \nof  the  road.  In  2002,  the  governor  of  Banteay  Meanchey  province,  with  reference  to  the  royal \ndecree  on  the  protection  of  natural  area  and  in  recognition  of  the  needs  of  the  local  people  who \nalready occupy or use the land alongside NR 56 within the BCPL, informed the people that (i) from \nThmar  Pourk  to  Banteay  Chhmar,  the  Government  would  allow  them  to  continue  to  use  and \noccupy  the  land  located  alongside  NR  56  for  a  distance  of  400  m  on  both  sides  of  the  road;  (ii) \nfrom Thmar Pourk to Boeung Trakourn they would be allowed to use 5 km either side of the road; \nand (iii) at the border (with Thailand) they would be allowed to use 3 km on either side of the road. \nConcrete posts have been placed to mark the extent of the community area with respect to NR 56 \nwithin the BCPL. These community areas are set back about 400 m from NR 56. Since the current \nland uses within the part of the BCPL that runs alongside the NR 56 consists of residential areas, \npaddy  fields,  and  sparsely  vegetated  land  dominated  by  grasses  and  shrubs,  environmental \nimpacts to the BCPL due to improvements to NR 56 are considered negligible such that no specific \nenvironmental mitigation measures are necessary for this protected area. \n \nAccording to the Ministry of Environment, no rare or endangered species exist in the BCPL. \n64. \nNR  56  also  goes  around  the  Banteay  Chhmar  temple  at  chainage  57  km.  The  temple  is  a  large \nancient cultural monument, dating back to the Angkor Wat period, and it is governed by a special \nroyal decree dated 11 March 2003. The decree indicates that there are three zones of protection \nfor the temple: Zone 1 (core zone, needs high conservation), Zone 2 (buffer zone, rich with artifacts \nwhich constrain inappropriate development), and Zone 3 (support zone which is for socioeconomic \ndevelopment,  proposed  developments  require  environmental  assessment).  As  the  temple  is \nnominated for World Heritage status, the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts indicated that, due to the \nnew proposed United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) status, \nit  will  not  approve  a  route  though  any  of  the  zones.  To  avoid  the  three  zones  of  protection  and \nadverse impacts to the temple, the Project will involve construction of an 11-km bypass on sparse \nscrubland. \n \n                                                 \n27  UN Intra-Agency Project (UNIAP) on Human Trafficking in the GMS website (http://www.no-trafficking.org). \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nRisks \n\n65. \nThe predicted environmental impacts during construction include dust emission due to site \nworks and transport of materials, noise and vibration, water pollution due to fuel spills and improper \nwaste  disposal,  soil  erosion  and  siltation  of  water  courses  due  to  earthworks  and  extraction  of \nborrow materials, and loss of roadside vegetation. Impacts during the operation phase will include \nreduction in dust emission due to paved roads as well as air and noise pollution from vehicles. For \nthese  impacts,  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  prepared  for  the  Project  identifies \nmitigation  measures,  monitoring  activities,  and  environmental  capacity  strengthening  programs \nalong  with  estimated  costs  and  institutional  responsibilities.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The summary initial environmental examination \nis in Appendix 11. \n \nC. \n \nThe major risk is delayed project implementation as a result of slow procurement processes \n66. \nfor detailed design and construction supervision consultants, and for civil works contractors. There is \nalso a potential risk due to the lack of, or delay in, the provision of counterpart funds. These risks are \nmitigated by the design and advance procurement measures to be undertaken, and the Government \nhas  committed  the  allocation  of  counterpart  funds  for  the  Project  during  its  entire  period.  There \nremains the risk that Thai financing for NR 68 may be further delayed which, in turn, could reduce the \ntransport  efficiency  of  the  road  network  in  the  project  area.  This  risk  may  be  mitigated  through  a \nsupplementary  financing  or  cofinancing  modality  in  the  future  to  rehabilitate  NR  68B,  which  would \ncontribute to the intended transport efficiency. \n \n67. \nThere are also increased risks of HIV and human trafficking during the construction period \nbut these risks will be mitigated through the provision of an awareness program. Further, improved \nroad infrastructure implies smoother paved surface, thus higher vehicle speeds and greater risk of \nroad accidents. This is especially critical in rural areas where roadside residents are not sufficiently \neducated on road safety. A road safety component is included in the Project to mitigate this risk. It \nis implicit in the provision of durable infrastructure that maintenance activities will be implemented \nas required in a timely manner and that axle loading is controlled. This risk is mitigated by the road \nmaintenance  component  which  will  complement  other  programs  of  axle  load  control  initiated  by \nprevious and ongoing ADB-funded projects and those funded by other development partners. \n \nEnvironmental  risk  will  be  managed  by  an  effective  environmental  management  plan \n68. \nespecially  to  ensure  compliance  during  construction  activities.  The  Project  has  some  impacts  on \nsocial  aspects  of  the  roadside  residents  due  to  resettlement.  These  resettlement  risks  will  be \nmanaged  by  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  A  risk  of  unexploded  ordnance, \nprincipally  from  minefields,  exists  in  the  project  area.  The  project  design  includes  clearance  of \nthese devices from the right of way. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nSpecific Assurances \n \n69. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCofinancing.  MPWT  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard \npolicies  are  applied  and  implemented  for  all  project  components  regardless  of \nfinancing source. \nOperation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  facilities. MPWT will be responsible \nfor  the  operation  and  maintenance of  the  project  facilities  through  proper  technical \nsupervision and adequate fund allocation. The Government will ensure that annually \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nadequate  budget  is  made  available  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  project \nfacilities during and after the Project. \nEnvironment.  The  construction  and  operation  of  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  IEE  prepared  under  the  ADB  TA  and  will  comply  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. If \nthere  is  any  discrepancy  between  the  Government\u2019s  laws  and  regulations,  and \nADB\u2019s  environment  policy,  ADB\u2019s  policy  will  prevail.  The  MPWT  will  ensure \nimplementation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures,  environmental  monitoring \nactivities  and  environmental  capacity  strengthening  programs  as  well  as  other \nrecommendations  specified  in  the  IEE  to  minimize  any  adverse  environmental \nimpacts  arising  from  the  construction  and  operation  of  project  facilities. MPWT  will \nensure that the environmental mitigation and monitoring measures in the IEE will be \nincluded  in  the  bidding  documents  as  a  basis  for  the  contractors  to  prepare  and \nimplement  construction  environmental  management  plans.  MPWT  will  ensure  that \nprior  to  any  site  works,  construction  environmental  management  plans  will  be \ndeveloped based on the IEE, and complied with by the civil works contractors during \nimplementation. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  MPWT  will  ensure  that  any  involuntary \nresettlement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  resettlement  plan, \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and relevant laws of the country. In \ncase  of  differences  between  Cambodia\u2019s  laws  and  government  regulations  and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, ADB\u2019s policy will prevail. \nMPWT will only issue notice to commence civil works in a particular section of the \nproject roads when (a) compensation payment and relocation of the affected people \nin said particular section have been completed satisfactorily and in accordance with \nthe  updated  resettlement  plan  approved  by  ADB,  (b)  rehabilitation  assistance  for \nthat  particular  section  is  in  place,  and  (c)  that  particular  road  section  is  free  of  all \nencumbrances. \n\n(vi)  MPWT  will  update  the  resettlement  plan,  endorse  it  and  disclose  it  in  accordance \n\nwith ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii) \n\n(vii)  MPWT,  through  its  Social  and  Environmental  Unit,  and  in  close  collaboration  with \nthe Resettlement Department of the IRC, will be responsible for internal monitoring \nof resettlement activities, including engaging the services of an independent agency \nfor  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  1  month  after  the  commencement  of \nresettlement  plan  updating.  The  internal  and  external  monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB every quarter and uploaded on MPWT\u2019s website within 2 weeks of \ntheir submission. This will be carried out until resettlement has been completed. \nThe Government will ensure the timely provision of counterpart funds for resettlement \nand will meet any unforeseen obligations in excess of the resettlement budget in order \nto satisfy the requirements and objectives of resettlement. \nEthnic  minority.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  not  affect  any \nethnic minority peoples. In case that any ethnic minority will be affected, MPWT will \ndevelop and implement an ethnic minority development plan acceptable to ADB in \naccordance with the applicable laws and regulations of the Government and ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \nSocial and gender. The Government will ensure that all works contracts under the \nProject incorporate provisions and budgets to the effect that contractors (a) comply \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  labor  laws  and  related  international  treaty \nobligations and  do  not employ  child  labor,  (b) provide  safe  working  conditions  and \nseparate  water  and  sanitation  facilities  for  male  and  female  workers  in  the \nconstruction  camps  and  in  the  construction  sites,  (c)  provide  equal  wages  to  male \nand  female  workers  for  work  of  equal  value,  (d)  provide  day-care  services  for  the \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(xi) \n\nchildren  of  female  construction  workers,  and  (e)  recruit  local  labor  for  construction \nwork and road maintenance program. \nThe Government will ensure that the Gender Strategy provided in the resettlement \nplan  and  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  are  undertaken  to \nmaximize  project  benefits \nto  women.  Some  key  actions  are  (a)  separate \nconsultations  on  resettlement  activities  for  affected  women  groups  (households \nheaded by women, elderly women, and poor women); (b) timely compensation and \nrelocation of houses for such women groups; (c) implement HIV prevention and anti-\nhuman-trafficking  awareness  program  for  women  with  district  and  commune \ncouncils  of  women;  and  (d)  develop  monitoring  indicators  covering  women  groups \nand implement a project-specific gender strategy. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n70. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  10,512,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Northwest  Provincial  Road  Improvement  Project  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n29 July 2009 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nDesign Summary \nImpact \nIncreased subregional \ntransport and trade \nbetween Thailand and \nCambodia  \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators \n\n \nIncreased passenger \ntraffic at O'smach border \nby 30% from 2010 in \n2013 \n \nIncreased cargo traffic at \nO'smach border by 20% \nfrom 2010 in 2013 \n \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting Mechanisms \n \nADB\u2019s field traffic surveys \n \nMPWT annual reports \n \n \nNational Customs \nstatistics \n \n\nOutcome \nIncreased transport \nefficiency in \nnorthwestern Cambodia \n\n \nADB\u2019s field traffic surveys \n \nMPWT annual reports  \n \n\n \nAverage travel time to \nservices in the project \ndistricts of 1.0\u20131.5 hours \nin 2010 are reduced to \n30\u201345 minutes by 2018 \n \nIncreased average trip \nlengths of the project \nroad by 40% from 2010 \nin 2013 \n\nOutputs  \n1.

Roads  are  critical  to  the  social  and  economic \ndevelopment  of  Cambodia.  This  road  network  of  about  39,400  kilometers  (km)  includes  national \nroads,  or  the  primary  national  roads  (about  4,800  km),  and  provincial  roads,  or  the  secondary \nnational  highways  (about  6,600  km).  The  management  of  national  and  provincial  roads  is  the \nresponsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT).  The  remaining  network  of \nabout 28,000 km of rural roads is the responsibility of the Ministry for Rural Development. \n \n2. \nThe primary roads consist of national roads NR 1 to NR 9, which are national highways that \nextend  from  Phnom  Penh  to  provincial  capitals  and  the  main  access  points  to  the  country.  Lesser \nnational  roads  with  two-digit  numbers  are  provincial  highways  that  connect  the  provincial  capitals \nand  connect  to  minor  border  crossings  and  important  domestic  centers.  The  secondary  (provincial \nroads) and tertiary (rural and strategic roads) serve local transport needs. \n \n3. \nBy  the  early  1990s,  the  years  of  civil  war  had  left  the  road  network  severely  deteriorated. \nSince  1992,  with  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  multilateral  and \nbilateral  development  partners,  the  Government  has  focused  on  rehabilitating  the  core  national \ninfrastructure  that  is  required  for  the  economy  to  develop  in  a  sustainable  manner.  These \ndevelopment  efforts  over  the  past  16  years  have  seen  the  paved  national  road  network  extend  to \nabout 2,700 km, which amounts to slightly less than 25% of the total national roads. \n \nThe  road  network  was  mostly  built  before  1960,  and  has  a  significant  number  of  bridges\u2014\n4. \nthere  are  about  4,000  on  the  national  roads  alone.  The  general  design  standards  cater  to  lighter \ntraffic than current loads, with many existing bridges designed for gross vehicle road weights of 10 \ntons  (t),  well  below  the  current  standard  of  up  to  30  t.  Bridges  have  often  collapsed  due  to \noverloading,  and  most  are  now  seriously  damaged  or  have  failed.  Most  of  the  road  network  is \ndilapidated and large parts of the country are effectively isolated during the wet season. The MPWT \nconsiders  that  at  least  half  of  the  primary  road  network  and  nearly  all  the  secondary  and  tertiary \nroads are in need of urgent repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction. Road condition surveys in 2002 \nconfirm that 28% of the network is in good or fair condition, 35% is in poor condition, 28% is in bad \ncondition, and 6% is under reconstruction or rehabilitation. \n \n5. \nTherefore, despite the improvement of national roads, many provincial and most rural roads \nare in poor condition, and parts of the country  are effectively isolated during the wet season. Until \nrecently,  however,  the  secondary  national  network,  which  links  provinces  to  the  national  road \nnetwork and provides intraprovincial links to the tertiary and rural network and to Cambodia\u2019s largely \nrural population, has received little attention. The result is that the road network is split into networks \nof  primary  and  tertiary  roads  that  are  only  loosely  and  unreliably  interconnected.  The  situation \nhinders the development of cash-crop production in the rural areas, where markets in many places \nare  limited  to  the  local  area  due  to  lack  of  access.  It  also  means  that  provincial  centers  and \nnumerous  natural  and  cultural  sites  with  tourism  potential  are  inaccessible  at  times.  As  a  result  of \nthe  poor  condition  of  such  access  roads,  many  important  bilateral  cross-border  trade  routes  are \ninaccessible, thus imposing substantial diversion costs on the transport system as it must use longer \nalternative routes. \n \nThe unrehabilitated sections of the road network are characterized by cracks, ruts, potholes, \n6. \nedge  failures,  and  pavement  failures.  The  Government  recognizes  that  the  poor  state  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  road  infrastructure  poses  a  significant  hindrance  to  economic  development  and \nemphasizes the urgency of reestablishing the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRoad Traffic Issues \n\n \nB. \n \n7. \nVehicle Numbers. Given the growing network of trafficable roads, the increasing number of \nmotor vehicles in the country, and the robust growth of Cambodia\u2019s economy, traffic has increased \nrapidly. In 2003 there were approximately 450,000 registered motor vehicles in the country, of which \napproximately 73% were motorbikes; 23% were cars, pickups, and other light vehicles; and 4% were \ntrucks,  buses,  and  other  heavy  vehicles.  This  increased  to  873,000  vehicles  in  2007,  almost \ndoubling in 5 years, indicating an increase of 20% annually. \n \n8. \nOverloading.  Propelled  by  the  economic  development,  overloading  of  cargo  vehicles  has \nbecome  a  severe  cause  of  road  damage  in  Cambodia  in  the  past  5  years.  This  leads  to  premature \ndeterioration  of  road  pavements  and  threatens  the  stability  of  the  many  bridges  designed  for  light \ntraffic. The legal axle load in Cambodia is 10 t. There is evidence that some trucks, particularly those \ncarrying cement, take on as much as 60 t over a truck-trailer combination. A survey carried out in 1997 \nidentified an average axle weight of 10 t with maximum axle weights of up to 16 t. Further, the survey \nindicated that about 24% of the vehicles with two or more axles were overloaded. Enforcement of axle \nload limits in Cambodia is ongoing but weak, and thus it is essential that an effective axle load control \nprogram is formulated to lead to greatly extended pavement life and lower bridge maintenance costs. \nThis  is  particularly  important  for  bridges,  which  constitute  a  very  large  part  of  the  network,  as \nexceptionally heavy vehicles can damage structures irreparably. \n \n9. \nSubdecree  744,  Maximum  Load  Limit  of  Transport  Vehicles  Using  the  Road  Network  in \nCambodia, was approved by the Government on 3 September 1999. It details the load limits and sets \npenalties  for  overloading.  Such  penalties  should  reflect  actual  damage  and  discourage  overloading. \nPavement design is based on the fact that vehicle damage to a road depends entirely on the axle load \nof those vehicles. The penalties listed in the subdecree increase only linearly with increasing loads, but \ndamage to the road in reality increases exponentially as the load increases. Small increases in axle \nload above the legal limit of 10 t can result in a severe increase in damage to the road pavement. As \nfar as practicable, penalties should reflect the exponential increase in damage. \n \n10.  While  the  Government  enacted  the  legislation  required  to  enforce  overloading  control  in \n2006, the MPWT, supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, launched an axle load \ncontrol  program  in  2005  to  address  this.  ADB  also  supported  this  through  its  ongoing  Greater \nMekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement  Project 1 by  providing  seven  permanent  weigh \nstations  on  national  roads.  These  are  expected  to  be  operational  some  time  in  2009.  Since  this \noperation  requires  wider  coverage  to  be  effective,  this  initiative  needs  further  assistance  by \nestablishing more weigh stations on national roads, with an effective enforcement scheme. \n \n11. \nTraffic  Accidents. Deteriorating road safety is a growing concern. Cambodia has one of the \nhighest incidences of road accidents in the world. In 2007, there were 18 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, \nan  increase  of  50%  from  2000.  This  is  over  twice  the  incidence  of  fatalities  in  neighboring  Thailand \n(6.5 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles). Based on studies carried out in other countries, the cost attributable \nto accidents can be assumed to be equivalent to 1%\u20133% of gross domestic product (GDP) annually. \nMoreover,  traffic  accidents  disproportionately  impact  on  pedestrians  and  cyclists,  who  are  typically \nfrom the poorer levels of society. Thus, for economic and social reasons, Cambodia\u2019s worsening road \nsafety situation needs to be addressed while it is still manageable. In this context, ADB implemented \nregional  road  safety  TA  in  2002  with  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  and \ncurrently  supports  the  MPWT\u2019s  national  road  safety  action  plan  through  the  ongoing  Road  Asset \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila (Loan 1945-CAM). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nManagement Project2. This needs continuous engagement for sustainable outcomes. \n \n12. \nA focused, comprehensive, well-planned, and multidimensional road safety program is urgently \nneeded  to  address  the  problem  in  Cambodia.  An  indication  of  government  commitment  has  been \ndemonstrated  by  the  issuance  of  a  draft  subdecree  proposing  to  establish  a  National  Road  Safety \nCouncil  with  representation  from  several  key  ministries,  including  the  MPWT.  This  has  initiated  the \ncomprehensive road safety program for Cambodia: (i) an accident data system; (ii) the National Road \nSafety  Council,  with  the  secretariat  located  in  the  MPWT;  (iii)  infrastructure  improvement;  (iv) \nlegislation;  (v)  traffic  police  enforcement;  (vi)  education  and  publicity;  (vii)  driver  training  and  testing; \n(viii)  vehicle  testing  and  inspection;  and  (ix)  emergency  services.  This  area  also  needs  continuous \nengagement by donor agencies for sustainable results. \n \nC. \n \n13.  Meanwhile, as the improved national road network extends further throughout the country, the \nrural economy becomes more dependent on it. However, this network is deteriorating due to lack of \nadequate road maintenance combined with rapidly growing traffic, poor road maintenance standards, \nand design and construction deficiencies. Inadequate road maintenance is primarily due to a shortage \nof  financial  resources;  poor  organization  of  management,  planning,  and  implementation  of  road \nmaintenance; and weak technical capacity of road agencies and local contractors. \n \n\nFinancial and Institutional Sustainability of the Road Sector \n\n1. \n\nRoad Maintenance Management and Financing \n\n14.  Maintenance  Budget.  The  management  of  a  road  network  must  be  based  on  business \nprinciples,  using  economic  criteria  to  prioritize  and  schedule  maintenance  works.  An  asset \nmanagement  approach  is  most  appropriate  as  a  long-term  goal  for  maintaining  and  preserving  the \nroad  network.  In  Cambodia\u2019s  situation,  this  implies  a  move  from  the  present  crisis-response \nmanagement  mode  to  a  network  management  mode  as  the  core  network  stabilizes  and  normal \nperiodic maintenance works can be scheduled in a cost-effective manner. Essential to that approach is \nthe establishment of the maintenance management system with its basic building blocks that include a \nroad and bridge inventory, a system for updating the inventory and accompanying condition surveys, \nand application of evaluation tools to prioritize and schedule periodic maintenance. An ADB-financed \nstudy has developed a decentralized approach to road condition monitoring and the programming and \nmanagement  of  routine  maintenance  that  is  suitable  for  implementation  by  provincial  public  works \ndepartments. The study initiated implementation of the maintenance management system in three pilot \nprovinces, with the system now being adopted by the MPWT for replication in the remaining provinces \nof  Cambodia.  The  system  is  based  on  a  relatively  straightforward  road  condition  assessment \nprocedure that involves (i) vehicle operating speeds and travel time, (ii) drainage considerations, and \n(iii) engineering judgment. \n \n15. \nTo  ensure  an  effective  and  sustainable  planning  and  programming  process,  it  is  clearly \nessential to ensure security of funding and reliable cash flow with the attendant technical and financial \naudit  instruments.  The  MPWT  has  two  sources  of  funding  for  maintenance  and  development  of  the \nroad network: general funds from the annual budget, and special funds accumulated in the Fund for \nRepair and Maintenance of Roads. General funds allocated in the annual budget in effect cover only \nperiodic maintenance and pavement rehabilitation.  \n \n16. \nThe  current  level  of  maintenance  spending,  including  capital  expenditure  for  recurrent \nmaintenance and rehabilitation, is approximately 15% of total requirements and is clearly insufficient \nto meet the needs of the sector. The shortfall is partly explained by the dilapidated state of most of \n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nAdministration of Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Road Asset Management Project. Manila (Loan 2406-CAM). \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nthe  road  network  after  more  than  20  years  of  neglect,  which  translates  into  high  maintenance \nrequirements,  combined  with  the  Government\u2019s  limited  funding  capacity.  In  2000  and  2001,  the \nMPWT\u2019s expenditure on the primary and secondary road network (the national and provincial roads) \naveraged  approximately  $12.5  million  per  year,  of  which  20%  ($2.5  million)  was  recurrent \nexpenditure for routine maintenance, and 80% ($10.0 million) was capital expenditure for repair and \nrehabilitation  of  pavements.  Annual  average  external  agency  funding  added  an  estimated  $60 \nmillion  for  road  rehabilitation  and  improvement;  the  Government\u2019s  expenditure  for  counterpart \nfunding  of  externally  financed  projects  was  approximately  $6  million  equivalent,  making  for  total \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation  funding  of  $79  million.  No  new  funds  are  being  expended  on  the \nconstruction of new roads. \n \n17. \nIn recent years the Government has been allocating increasing amounts to road maintenance, \nfollowing the requirements of ADB\u2019s ongoing Greater Mekong Subregion: Cambodia Road Improvement \nProject  (footnote  1).  Specifically,  road  maintenance  expenditure  in  2008  was  about  $42.5  million, \nincreasing from $7.0 million in 2006 and $26.0 million in 2007. This is about 20 times the expenditure in \n2002 and 2003, when the annual total maintenance expenditure was only about $2.0 million\u2013$3.0 million \n(para. 16). Also, in 2007 ADB provided additional support to enhance the aforementioned maintenance-\nrelated  issues  and  improve  private  sector  contracting  industry  with  its  Asset  Management  Project.  It \nestablished a Road Asset Management Office to be the road asset manager for the MPWT, which was \nan important milestone towards a sustainable road network, and reinforced the MPWT's reorganization \nmomentum. \n \n18. \nADB  further  assisted  this  new  road  maintenance  regime  by  approving  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion:  Southern  Coastal  Corridor  Project3 in  2008  that  would  rehabilitate  and  maintain  some \nprovincial roads. This proposed project is to further supplement the sustainable maintenance works \nprogram  initiated  in  the  ongoing  Road  Asset  Management  Project  (footnote  2)  and  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion:  Southern  Coastal  Corridor  Project  (footnote  3).  This  overall  program  will \nstrengthen the road maintenance skills of local contractors and improve the cost efficiency of road \nmaintenance works. \n \n\n2. \n\nSustainable  Organizational  Structure  for  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and \nTransport \n\nInstitutional  constraints  also  contribute  to  the  low  level  of  road  maintenance  funding.  The \n19. \nMPWT  needs  to  strengthen  capacity  and  develop  an  effective  organizational  structure  to  carry  out \ncredible  and  efficient  maintenance  planning  and  implementation.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance should then be able to respond more efficiently in approving, disbursing, and monitoring funds \nfor defined maintenance programs. Disbursement of the approved road maintenance budget has been \nlow  and  approved  budget  allocations  have  been  falling.  This  development  urgently  needs  to  be \nreversed before substantial damage is inflicted upon the rehabilitated parts of the road network. \n \nThe  current  MPWT  was  created  by  royal  decree  in  January  1996  and  was  vested  with  the \n20. \nresponsibility  to  administer  and  regulate  the  public  works  and  transport  sectors  of  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia.  The  MPWT\u2019s  capabilities  in  addressing  issues  and  needs  in  the  transport  sector  require \nimprovement  through  reorganization  and  institutional  strengthening,  particularly  with  respect  to  (i) \ndefining more fully the MPWT\u2019s functions, responsibilities, and job descriptions; and (ii) setting in place \nthe  management  processes  necessary  for  the  development  of  policies  and  plans  and  the  guidance \nand control necessary to verify that developments and operations conform to those policies and plans. \nThe Greater Mekong Subregion: Cambodia Road Improvement Project helped the MPWT to develop \nmuch-needed institutional changes in reorganization of the MPWT. In that project, the aforementioned \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

This initiative was supplemented by the Road Asset \nManagement Project (footnote 2) of 2007. This project established a Road Asset Management Office \nto be the road asset manager for the MPWT (para. 17). \n \nD. \n \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  Strategy.  The  key  objectives  of  GMS  cooperation  in  the \n21. \ntransport  sector,  as  identified  by  the  GMS  10-Year  Strategic  Framework  (2002\u20132012),  are  to  (i) \ndevelop priority transport corridors critical to linking the subregion together and promoting trade and \ninvestment; (ii) reduce nonphysical barriers to the movement of people, goods, and services; and (iii) \nformulate  and  coordinate  strategies  to  ensure  that  the  transport  corridors  evolve  into  economic \ncorridors,  leading  to  agricultural  diversification,  industrialization,  and  the  creation  of  employment \nopportunities. Further, the overall intent of the GMS Transport Sector Strategy for 2006\u20132015 is to \nestablish a well-built, seamless, multimodal subregional transport network to fully connect the GMS. \nAlso, the Vientiane Plan of Action for GMS Development (2008\u20132012), adopted by the GMS leaders \nat  the  Third  GMS  Summit,  focused  on  the  strategic  thrusts  under  the  Vientiane  Plan,  namely, \ncompleting  key  parts  of  the  GMS  transport  network  and  transforming  these  corridors  into  fully \nfledged economic corridors. \n \nADB  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Cambodia4 supports  ADB's  overall  strategy  for \n22. \npoverty  reduction  through  broad-based  growth,  inclusive  social  development,  and  stronger \ngovernance for sustainable development. Given the continuing challenges in terms of rural access \nand sectorwide best practices, the country strategy for the sector has shifted from large-scale public \nsector  interventions  for  national  roads  to  (i)  fostering  technical  cooperation,  standard  setting,  and \nprivate investment in national transport; and (ii) supporting subregional projects that promote access \nto remote rural areas, operationalize cross-border transport agreements, etc. \n \n23. \nGovernment  Strategy.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  for  2009\u20132013  (the \nRectangular  Strategy5,  started  in  2004  with  the  first  phase,  now  in  its  second  phase)  emphasizes \ngenerating economic growth through the private sector; rehabilitation and development of the country\u2019s \nphysical  infrastructure  is  a  precondition  for  this.  This  combines  with  the  primary  tools  of  the \nGovernment's strategy for the road sector, which since 1994 have been to focus road investments on \nrehabilitating national highways and selected provincial, rural, and urban roads. \n \nThe Government's strategy has restored a core transport system that connects the country\u2019s \n24. \nmain centers and has significantly contributed to integrating the national economy with the regional \nand global economies. Also, the Government has initiated a process of decentralization and reforms. \nFor  example,  the  delivery  of  transport  infrastructure  services,  which  was  previously  centrally \nmanaged  by  the  MPWT,  is  now  delegated  to  the  provinces.  The  MPWT  itself  is  in  the  process  of \nshifting  its  focus  away  from  direct  management  of  transport  infrastructure  towards  planning  and \noversight of the sector, supported by ADB, the World Bank, and the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency.  However,  it  is  encumbered  by  shortages  of  skills  and  resources  in  the  provinces  and \ncentrally  to  undertake  these  new  roles,  and  thus  needs  continuous  engagement  through  future \ninterventions. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005.

In  their  joint  declaration, \nthe  heads  of  governments  of  the  six  GMS  countries  called  for  accelerating  the  construction  and \nimprovement  of  the  remaining  sections  of  GMS  corridors,  and  expanding  the  corridor  network \nthrough  multimodal  linkages.  They  endorsed  the  Vientiane  Plan  of  Action  for  GMS  Development \n(2008\u20132012),  which  includes  the  high-priority  projects  and  programs  in  the  nine  sectors  of  GMS \ncooperation. Items under the Vientiane Plan of Action in the transport sector were derived from the \nGMS Transport Sector Strategy Study (Box A3) and agreed upon by the GMS Transport Forum. \n \n\nBox A3: Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector Strategy (2006\u20132015) \n\n \nThe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) transport sector strategy was formulated under the auspices of Asian Development \nBank  regional  technical  assistance,  and  endorsed  by  the  six  GMS  governments  in  May  2006.  It  provides  a  subregional \nframework that is implemented through individual national transport strategies and action plans in the six GMS countries. \nThese strategies and action plans are supported to varying degrees with sector policy statements, strategies, objectives, \npriorities,  and  individual  project  analyses.  Although  there  are  many  regional  and  subregional  cooperation  groupings \ninvolved in transport in GMS countries, the GMS transport sector strategy is endorsed at the highest levels of leadership in \nthe six Governments. This has provided the GMS with a leading role in coordinating and implementing priority subregional \nprojects and initiatives. \n \nFormulation  of  the  GMS  transport  sector  strategy  for  the  period  to  2015  took  account  of  the  need  for  the  following:  (i) \nsector  focus  that  identifies  factors  critical  to  intraregional  and  transit  trade  and  improved  competitiveness  (e.g.,  missing \nlinks in the transport network and critical common needs such as maintenance, logistics, and multimodal integration) and \nthat  are  complementary  to  interregional  and  global  trade;  (ii)  comprehensive  intersector  strategy  that  (a)  identifies  major \nsocioeconomic trends and developments, (b) determines and prioritizes transport initiatives that respond to these needs, \n(c)  is  a  subset  of  a  comprehensive  GMS  development  plan,  and  (d)  encompasses  country  and  regional  transport  and \nrelated development strategies; and (iii) a goal setting and results-oriented management plan  that identifies key goals of \neconomic integration and regional cooperation for 2015 and beyond, and sets performance indicators and prioritizes GMS \ntransport initiatives to best realize these goals, e.g., the GMS as a \u201cgrowth bridge\u201d between the People\u2019s Republic of China \nand  India,  capitalizing  on  the  strategic  location  of  the  GMS,  and  the  realization  of  Millennium  Development  Goals.  The \nGMS  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study  identified  five  overarching  goals  for  transport:  (i)  to  exploit  synergies  in  the  GMS \ntransport system; (ii) to move towards an open market for transport services; (iii) to facilitate economic efficiency to reduce \ntransport costs; (iv) to complete the GMS network and improve links with South Asia; and (v) to encourage multi-modalism. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2006.

Manila. \n \n2. \nThe GMS Southern Economic Corridor (SEC) was identified by the GMS countries as one of \nthe  three  priority  projects  under  the  economic  corridor  approach  which  they  adopted  in  1998.  The \nother  two  were  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor  and  the  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  (Figure \nA3.1). The development of the SEC was subsequently designated as a flagship initiative under the 10-\nYear  GMS  Strategic  Framework  that  was  endorsed  by  the  leaders  of  the  GMS  countries  during  the \nFirst  GMS  Summit  held  in  Phnom  Penh,  Cambodia  in  2002.

It  will  serve  as  another \ntransnational corridor linking Thailand with Cambodia, and will connect with the main corridor linking \nBangkok, Phnom Penh, Ho Chi Minh City, and Vung Tau. \n \nB. \n \n3. \n \n\nCross-Border Road Infrastructure between Cambodia and Thailand \n\nThe SEC is defined by three subcorridors and an intercorridor link: \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nBangkok\u2013Phnom  Penh  (via  National  Road  [NR]  5  or  NR  6  from  Sisophon)\u2013Ho  Chi \nMinh City\u2013Vung Tau Subcorridor (Central Subcorridor or Subcorridor 1), \n\nBangkok\u2013Siem Reap\u2013Stung Treng\u2013Rattanakiri\u2013O Yadov\u2013Pleiku\u2013Quy Nhon Subcorridor \n(Northern Subcorridor or Subcorridor 2), \n\nBangkok\u2013Trat\u2013Koh  Kong\u2013Kampot\u2013Ha  Tien\u2013Ca  Mau\u2013Nam  Can  Subcorridor \n(Southern Coastal Subcorridor or Subcorridor 3), and \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nSihanoukville\u2013Phnom  Penh\u2013Kratie\u2013Stung  Treng\u2013Dong  Kralor\u2013Pakse\u2013Savannakhet \nSubcorridor  connecting  the  three  subcorridors  to  the  East\u2013West  Economic  Corridor \n(Intercorridor Link or Subcorridor 4). \n\n \n4. \nThe three subcorridors and intercorridor link pass through Cambodia\u2019s territory covering 18 \nprovinces  and  municipalities  (Figure  A3),  which  have  a  total  land  area  of  149,316.82  square \nkilometers (82.5% of Cambodia's area) and a combined population of 10.8 million people (77.8% of \nthe total population). \n\nFigure A3: Southern Economic Corridor Subcorridors in Cambodia \n\n \n\n5. \nThere are several roads linking Cambodia and Thailand. Major links, with direct access to GMS \ncorridors,  are  NR  5  and  NR  48;  NR  5  links  Thailand  in  the  west,  at  the  Poipet  cross-border  point \n(forming part of the Central Subcorridor), and NR 48 links Thailand on the southern coast at Koh Kong \n(forming  part  of  the  Southern  Coastal  Subcorridor).  The  ongoing  Greater  Mekong  Subregion: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTrade between Cambodia and Thailand \n\nCambodia  Road  Improvement  Project1 has  been  rehabilitating  NR  5,  with  a  four-lane  asphalt-paved \nhighway  to  attract  rapidly  increasing  volumes  of  international  traffic  along  the  corridor;  this  work  is \nnearly completed in June 2009. Similarly, the Government of Thailand provided financial assistance for \nthe  rehabilitation  of  NR  48  in  2007  with  double  bituminous  surface  treatment,  ideal  for  rural  and \nprovincial  roads  of  Cambodia  with  low  to  moderate  traffic  volumes.  This  link  similarly  supports  the \ngradually increasing traffic volumes along this subregional corridor, which extends to Viet Nam and is \nexpected  to  grow  further  after  the  ongoing  rehabilitation  of  the  cross-border  facility,  financed  by \nanother ADB project, the Greater Mekong Subregion: Southern Coastal Corridor Project.2 \n \nC. \n \n6. \nData  on  cross-border  trade  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand  shows  that  total  cross-border \nexports from Thailand to Cambodia increased significantly from B1.26 billion in 1996 to B32.2 billion \nin  2007. 3 From  1996  to  2007,  such  exports  increased  by  an  average  of  42.8%  per  year.  The \nAranyaprathet  border  checkpoint  (Central  Subcorridor)  accounted  for  about  half  of  the  total  cross-\nborder  exports  of  Thailand  to  Cambodia,  followed  by  the  Klongyai  border  checkpoint  (Southern \nCoastal Subcorridor) with about one-third. Around 85% of the total cross-border exports of Thailand \nto  Cambodia  have,  therefore,  taken  place in  the  Central  and  Southern  Coastal  subcorridors  of  the \nSEC.  The  major  export  products  from  Thailand  include  motorcycles  and  parts,  cement,  engines, \nlivestock  feeds,  petroleum,  woven  fabrics,  textiles,  and  chemical  fertilizers,  with  the  largest  being \nmotorcycles and parts (12% of total in 2007). \n \n7. \nTotal cross-border imports of Thailand from Cambodia fluctuated from B1.0 billion in 1996 to \nB1.6 billion in 2007, representing an annual average growth rate of 20% lower than that of the cross-\nborder  exports  of  Thailand  to  Cambodia.  The  Aranyaprathet  border  checkpoint  accounted  for  two-\nthirds  of  the  total  cross-border  imports  of  Thailand  from  Cambodia  and  Chantaburi  accounted  for \none-fifth,  reinforcing  the  importance  of  the  SEC  in  cross-border  trade  between  Thailand  and \nCambodia. The major products imported by Thailand through the border gates include \u201cremnant of \niron,\u201d  used  clothes,  \u201cremnant  of  aluminum,\u201d  corn  feeds  for  livestock,  soybean  grain,  \u201cremnant  of \npaper,\u201d  ready-made  clothes,  and  tapioca.  There  has  been  a  consistent  balance  of  trade \npredominantly  in  favor  of  Thailand,  which  suggests  that  there  is  large  potential  for  increasing \nCambodian exports to Thailand. Improved agricultural productivity and a more diversified production \nstructure in Cambodia will greatly help realize this potential. \n \n8. \nThe  share  of  cross-border  trade  to  total  trade  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand  increased \nsubstantially from 1996 to 2007. The share of cross-border exports to total exports from Thailand to \nCambodia was only 13.8% in 1996, but by 2007 this had risen to 68.2%. Similarly, the share of cross-\nborder imports to total imports of Thailand from Cambodia rose from 85.4% in 1996 to 97.5% in 2007. \nIn contrast, the share of trade conducted by sea and air to total trade between the two countries has \ngenerally declined over time. This demonstrates the growing importance of the SEC in trade between \nCambodia and Thailand due to improved physical connectivity, which has enabled the exchange of a \nwider range and larger volumes of goods. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Cross \nBorder Trade and Commerce in Thailand: Policy Implications for Establishing Special Border Economic Zones. Bangkok \n(special  study  submitted  to  the  Asian  Institute  of  Technology  in  partial  fulfillment  of  PhD  in  regional  and  development \nplanning  [December]).  Cross-border  trade  in  the  study  covers  only  formal  trade  and  is  defined  as  trade  conducted \nthrough land borders as contrasted to trade conducted through seaborne and airborne transport. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nCross-Border Transport Facilitation in Cambodia \n\nCross-Border Tourism and Agriculture Development \n\nD. \n \n9. \nCross-border tourism between Thailand and Cambodia through the O'smach border checkpoint \nhas  been  increasing  in  recent  years.  In  2008,  the  number  of  people  using  this  border  crossing  point \nincreased  by  12%  over  2007.  There  is  considerable  potential  for  cross-border  tourism  between  the \nnortheastern  provinces  of  Thailand,  especially  Surin,  and  the  northwestern  provinces  of  Cambodia, \nespecially  Siem  Reap,  given  the  close  cultural  and  historical  relationship  between  the  two  areas.  The \nproposed project will provide a shorter and more direct route between Surin and Siem Reap. \n \nSince  2006,  contract  farming  arrangements  in  the  influence  area  of  the  proposed  project \n10. \nhave increased. There are currently 17 such farms operated by Thai farmers to cultivate high-value \nfruits such as avocado, mango, and banana. The land area cultivated as of 2008 is approximately \n60,000 hectares. \n \nE. \n \n11. \nCambodia  is  a  party  to  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  transport  and \ntrade facilitation agreements being finalized by the 10 ASEAN member governments. These include, \namong other things, (i) the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Goods in Transit, (ii) the ASEAN Inter-\nState  Transport  Agreement,  and  (iii)  the  ASEAN  Multimodal  Transport  Agreement.  These \nagreements have yet to be implemented. \n \n12. \nIn  November  2001,  Cambodia  acceded  to  the  GMS  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement \n(CBTA),  which  is  a  compact  and  comprehensive  multilateral  instrument  which  covers  in  one \ndocument all the relevant aspects of cross-border transport facilitation. These include (i) single-stop \nand  single-window  customs  inspection;  (ii)  cross-border  movement  of  persons;  (iii)  transit  traffic \nregimes;  (iv)  requirements  that  road  vehicles  meet  to  be  eligible  for  cross-border  traffic;  (v) \nexchange of commercial traffic rights (i.e., the ability of vehicles in one country to be operated in the \nneighboring country\u2019s territory); and (vi) infrastructure, including road and bridge design standards, \nroad  signs,  and  signals.  The  CBTA  will  apply  to  selected  and  mutually  agreed  upon  routes  and \npoints  of  entry  and  exit  in  the  signatory  countries.  In  Cambodia,  these  routes  and  border-crossing \npoints  include  all  the  subcorridors,  except  the  Northern  Subcorridor  and  the  associated  border \ncrossing  with  Viet  Nam.  Cambodia  has  ratified  the  CBTA  Framework  Agreement  and  all  of  the \nCBTA\u2019s  20  annexes  and  protocols.  Cambodia  and  Thailand  are  discussing  the  inclusion  of  the \nO'smach\u2013Chong Chom border crossing points and associated corridor in the scope of the CBTA. \n \n13. \nTo  allow  for  the  early  identification  of  implementation-related  issues  and  demonstrate  the \nefficacy  of  the  CBTA,  the  GMS  ministers  agreed  at  their  12th  meeting  in  2003  to  carry  out  pilot \ntesting of the CBTA at seven (of the 17 agreed) border crossing points along three (of the agreed \n11) routes. In Cambodia, pilot CBTA implementation is to be carried out at the Poipet\u2013Aranyaprathet \nand Bavet\u2013Moc Bai border crossing points along the Central Subcorridor. This is to be done on the \nbasis of bilateral memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between Cambodia and Thailand (signed \nin 2005), and Cambodia and Viet Nam (signed in 2006). However, pilot CBTA implementation has \nyet  to  commence.  A  related  bilateral  road  transport  agreement  was  signed  by  the  governments  of \nCambodia  and  Viet  Nam  in  Hanoi  in  October  2005  to,  among  other  things,  allow  the  exchange  of \ncommercial traffic rights between the two countries on a limited basis, thereby helping address the \nissue of time-consuming and costly transshipment of cargo at the border areas. The road transport \nagreement has been in effect since September 2006, and transport ministries of the two countries \nsigned  an  agreement  in  March  2009  to  increase  the  current  quota  of  vehicles  allowed  to  cross \nborders from 40 to 150. A similar MOU between Cambodia and Thailand, which was attached to the \nMOU on pilot implementation at the Poipet\u2013Aranyaprathet border crossing point, was signed by the \ntwo countries on the sidelines of the Third GMS Summit, but is not being implemented. \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n14. \nThe  Government  of  Cambodia  has  promulgated  a  program  on  the  Facilitation  of  Trade \nthrough  Risk  Management,  and  plans  to  implement  the  national  single-window  system  in  line  with \nthe  related  ASEAN  agreement  by  2012,  with  ASYCUDA4 as  the  agreed  data  platform.  Cambodia \nhas  plans  to  establish  the  ASYCUDA  system  at  major  land  border  checkpoints,  including  at  the \nPoipet and Bavet border checkpoints. Anukret 21 is crucial to the effective implementation of single-\nwindow inspection in Cambodia, and will involve the finalization and implementation of service-level \narrangements  between  the  General  Department  of  Customs  and  Excise  and  other  specialized \nministries and agencies involved in checkpoint formalities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

The  connection  from  the  border \ncrossing  to  the  project  road  (forming  part  of  NR  68)  is  implemented  with  support  from  the \nGovernment of Thailand. An all-weather sealed bituminous surfaced will be provided. The Project \nwill  improve  access  to  markets,  employment,  and  social  services  for  the  local  population  and \nenable  access  for  the  growing  number  of  tourists  to  temple  ruins  and  other  tourist  spots,  which \ncould  help  mitigate  the  unsustainably  high  levels  of  tourism  at  Angkor  Wat.  The  cross-border \nfacility at O'smach will be upgraded to meet Greater Mekong Subregion standards. The economic \nanalysis  was  carried  out  by  comparing  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  In  the \nwithout-project  scenario,  the  roads  are  assumed  to  continue  receiving  minimal  maintenance \nconsisting  of  annual  grading  and  biannual  regraveling,  with  the  result  that  the  roads  slowly \ndeteriorate over time. The with-project scenario involves upgrading to paved all-weather standard \nand  includes  vertical  realignment  where  required  to  raise  the  road  above  the  flood  level  during \nseasonal flooding, and assumes the proposed upgrading of NR 68. During operation, routine and \nperiodic maintenance in the with-project alternative is assumed to accord with best practices. \n \nthe  project  roads  will  be \n2. \nimplemented  during  2010\u20132014  and  is  followed  by  20  years  of  benefits  during  2015\u20132034.  All \nbenefits  and  costs  are  expressed  in  fixed  2008  economic  prices.  The  economic  prices  are \nestimated  using  economic  border  prices  for  traded  goods  and  services,  and  domestic  market \nprices net of domestic taxes and subsidies for non-traded goods and services. \n \nB. \n \n\nThe  economic  analysis  covers  2009\u20132034.  Upgrading \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\n1. \n\nCurrent Road Condition \n\n \n3. \nThe  existing  roads  are  located  in  predominantly  flat  and  open  terrain.  They  are  currently \nsurfaced  by  gravel  or  earth  and  have  very  high  roughness  values.  In  some  places  the  vertical \nalignment  is  too  low  to  prevent  flooding  in  the  wet  season.  The  project  roads  interconnect  two \nprovincial headquarters: Sisophon, where the road starts, and Samraong, where it connects to NR \n68 leading to O'smach. \n \n\n2. \n\nTraffic Volumes \n\n \n4. \nThe volume of traffic on the project road was determined from traffic surveys undertaken on \n21 and  29  May 2008.  Traffic surveys  were conducted at the same counting stations identified in  a \nprevious study to ensure comparability. Traffic counts were conducted for two days over a period of \n12  hours  from  6  am  to  6  pm.  The  survey  results  were  normalized  by  applying  seasonal  factors \ndeveloped  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement  Project 1 to  generate \nannual average daily traffic figures for the base year. The traffic counts were classified according to \nvehicle type and analyzed using version 4 of the Highway Development Model (HDM-4). Motorized \nas well as nonmotorized traffic was considered in the analysis. Traffic volumes, expressed in terms of \naverage annual daily traffic, show that the project roads typically carry about  1,551\u20132,817  vehicles \nper day. The results of the counts are in Table A8.1 \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2002.

Elasticity values used in recent studies in Cambodia range from 1.2 to 1.5 for passenger \ntraffic, and from 1.0 to 1.4 for freight traffic. For motorcycle traffic, which is rapidly growing and is a \ndominant  mover  of  people  in  Cambodia,  an  elasticity  of  2.0  was  adopted,  recognizing  the  likely \ncontinued growth in this mode of transport, as has been seen in Viet Nam. Overall, the estimations \nyield  traffic  growth  rates  ranging  from  about  4.5%  per  annum  to  about  10.4%  per  annum, \ndepending on vehicle type and forecast year. This corresponds well with observed developments \nin  Cambodia  in  recent  years  and  is  in  agreement  with  recent  forecasts  for  comparable  roads  in \nCambodia.  Expected  future  traffic  growth  is  further  analyzed  in  the  sensitivity  and  risk  analyses. \nThe estimated traffic growth rates are in Table A8.2. \n \n6. \nForecast traffic has three intrinsic components: (i) normal traffic growth, which is the growth \nin existing traffic due to growth in the economy and the population; (ii) generated traffic, which is \nthe additional traffic that materializes as a result of upgrading the road because reduced transport \ncosts  and  travel  times  make  transport  more  attractive  than  without  the  project;  and  (iii)  diverted \ntraffic,  which  is  traffic  that  is  attracted  from  other  routes  to  the  upgraded  road  because  the \nupgraded route is quicker and less costly. Only normal and generated traffic is considered in this \nstudy; diverted traffic is ignored because the Project road has no near alternative routes. \n \n\nTable A8.2: Estimated Traffic Growth Rates \n(% per annum) \nPublic Utility \nVehicles  \n\nCommodity \nVehicles \n\nYear \n2008\u20132010 \n2010\u20132015 \n2015\u20132020 \n2020\u20132025 \n2025\u20132030 \n2030\u20132035 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nPrivate \nVehicles \n7.3 \n5.4 \n5.3 \n4.9 \n4.6 \n4.6 \n\n8.5 \n6.1 \n6.1 \n5.6 \n5.2 \n5.2 \n\nMotorcycle \nwith Trailer \n10.4 \n7.2 \n7.5 \n6.9 \n6.3 \n6.3 \n\n8.1 \n5.9 \n5.8 \n5.4 \n5.0 \n5.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nCosts \n\n \nProject investment costs comprise civil works, detailed design and supervision consultancy, \n7. \nresettlement and land acquisition, contingencies, and administrative costs.

The characteristics of each of the vehicles\u2014such as physical description, tires, utilization, \nloading, and costs of vehicle resources and time values\u2014and calibration factors assigned to road \nuser cost components\u2014such as vehicle maintenance intensity, optimal vehicle life, climate, speed, \nand  fuel  and  acceleration  effects\u2014were  retained  form  the  previous  study.  The  costs  of  vehicles \nand spares were established based on observed prices in the project area and then converted into \nborder  prices  by  deducting  taxes  and  duties.  This  approach  was  adopted  in  light  of  the  fact  that \nvehicles and spare parts sold in the project area are predominantly secondhand rather than new \nimports, which dominate in the cities. The economic costs of fuel and lubricants were established \nbased on the prevailing cost of crude oil with added margins for refining and transport to establish \nborder prices. At the time of the analysis (February 2009), the crude oil price was about $40 per \nbarrel,  equivalent  to  a  border  price  of  about  $0.33  per  liter  of  petrol  and  about  $0.32  per  liter  of \ndiesel. \n \n9. \nEstimated  VOCs  in  dollars  per  kilometer  for  various  types  of  vehicles  and  typical  road \nroughness levels in the without-project (assuming minimal maintenance of the existing gravel road) \nand the with-project cases are shown in Table A8.5. The recent substantial volatility in oil prices\u2014\nwhich  has  seen  crude  oil  rise  from  about  $35  per  barrel  in  the  spring  of  2008  to  about  $136  per \nbarrel in the summer of 2008 and fall to about $40 per barrel in the spring of 2009\u2014is at present \nthe biggest source of uncertainty in forecasting road user benefits. This uncertainty is addressed in \nthe sensitivity and risk analysis by applying wider than normal variation ranges for future fuel costs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n\n \nTable A8.5: Typical Vehicle Operating Cost With Project and Without Project ($ per km) \n\n \nVehicle Type \nCar/Pick-ups/Vans \nBuses \nTrucks \nMotorcycles \nMotorcycle with Trailers \nIRI = international rough index (meters/km). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nWithout-Project \n(IRI = 11) \n0.43 \n0.79 \n1.21 \n0.08 \n0.09 \n\nWith-Project \n(IRI = 2.5) \n0.23 \n0.45 \n0.71 \n0.06 \n0.07 \n\n \n6. \n\nBenefits \n\n \n10. \nThe main economic benefits of the Project are VOCs and road user time savings accruing \nto  future  normal  and  generated  traffic,  and  saving  in  future  maintenance  because  the  upgraded \nroad  requires  less  costly  maintenance  than  the  existing  road.  The  HDM-4  model  was  used  to \nestimate these benefits over time. This model predicts annual-total VOC savings over the life of the \ninvestment  based  on  (i)  predicting  deterioration  in  the  pavement  over  time,  which  in  turn  reflects \ntraffic intensity and the maintenance regime applied over time; and (ii) forecast traffic. In both the \nwith-project and without-project cases, the road roughness level varies from year to year according \nto  traffic  movement  and  the  maintenance  applied.  Road  roughness  is  expressed  in  terms  of  the \ninternational roughness index and has a direct impact on VOCs and hence on the level of benefits. \nSince  the  Project  consists  of  nonhomogeneous  sections  (in  terms  of  level  of  traffic  and  without-\nproject  condition),  benefits  were  estimated  individually  for  each  subsection  and  aggregated  to \ngenerate  results  for  the  entire  Project.  The  resulting  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was \ncomputed outside the HDM-4 model, using Microsoft Excel. \n \n11. \nThe other source of road user benefits is time savings for road users. However, given the \nlow traffic levels on the roads and the high percentage of motorbikes, which gain very little in terms \nof  time  savings,  the  contribution  of  time  savings  to  road  user  benefits  is  very  small  (less  than \n0.01% of total user benefits), and thus time savings have been ignored. \n \n12.  Maintenance  costs  savings  were  estimated  based  on  observed  recent  unit  rates  of  major \nmaintenance work items.

Rehabilitation  and  upgrade  of  the  Project  roads  will  prevent  periodic  flooding  of  low-lying \nsections  of  the  road  and,  provided  the  roads  are  adequately  maintained  after  completion,  will \npermanently reduce future transportation costs for passengers and freight. This will sustain existing \neconomic activity in northwestern Cambodia and facilitate new economic activities which otherwise \nwould not be undertaken. A benefit monitoring framework with a series of key performance indicators \nhas  been  established.  The  indicators  cover  (i)  economic  development  in  the  project  area;  (ii) \ntransport costs and times for specific types of vehicles and trips; (iii) extent of transport services and \ncharges; (iv) incomes per capita; (v) access to work, schools, markets, and social services; and (vi) \njobs created during construction and maintenance. \n \n17.   Data  collection  will  consist  of  (i)  secondary  data  from  central  and  local  government \nstatistics;  (ii)  project  data  and  other  road  and  traffic  information  collected  by  the  MPWT;  and \n(iii) sample surveys of vehicle operators, road users, and road neighbors. The MPWT will measure \nperformance against the indicators at project inception, midterm review, completion, and annually \nfor 5 years after completion. The MPWT will be responsible for providing data on (i) average road \nroughness, (ii) classified traffic counts, (iii) annual expenditure on routine and periodic maintenance \nof the project roads and bridges, and (iv) social and economic impact indicators. The MPWT  will \nprovide baseline data and be responsible for collection of average one-way passenger fares and \nfreight  transport  rates  for  general  cargo  to  and  from  predetermined  points  on  the  rehabilitated \nproject roads. Comments and findings on performance against these indicators will be included in \nthe midterm review.

The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Northwest  Provincial \nRoad Improvement Project will cover (i) the rehabilitation of National Road (NR) 56 (113 kilometers \n[km]) in the provinces of Banteay Meanchey and Otdar Meanchey, and (ii) improvement of cross-\nborder facilities at the end of NR 68B in O'smach. An 11-km bypass road will be constructed in NR \n56 to avoid the ancient temple of Banteay Chhmar in the commune of Banteay Chhmar, District of \nThma  Puok.  It  will  take  off  from  approximately  STA  53.2  km-station  skirting  around  the  support \nzone  on  the  eastern  boundaries  of  the  temple  complex,  before  rejoining  NR  56  at  approximately \nSTA 64.3 km-station. \n\n2. \nScope  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Impacts. The Government claims a road \nright-of-way (ROW) of 25 meters (m) measured from the road center line. The Government claim \nover the ROW is buttressed by Prakas (Government Order) No. 6, dated 27 September 1999 and \nentitled  Measures  to  Crack  Down  on  Anarchic  Land  Grabbing  and  Encroachments.  The  prakas \nsets  a  ROW  of  50  m  for  national  roads  2,  3,  6,  7,  11,  22,  64,  and  78  and  a  ROW  of  60  m  for \nnational  roads  1,  4,  and  5.  Notwithstanding  Prakas  No.  6,  however,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works \nand Transport (MPWT) plans on clearing only a corridor (also referred to as the corridor of impact, \nor  COI)  of  16  m  (or  8  m  either  side  from  the  road  center  line)  in  the  urban  communities  of  Srei \nSophon and Samraong, and a COI of 20 m (or 10 m either side from the road center line) in Svay \nChek, Thma Puok, and Banteay Ampil. \n\n3. \nUsing a corridor of impact of 16\u201320 m for the Project and the required land for the bypass \nand cross-border facilities, the census and inventory of losses that were conducted on 27 June\u201315 \nJuly 2008 estimated that 310 households will be affected. Of the 200 households severely affected, \ntwo will be required to relocate their houses, 21 are house-cum-shops, and 140 are shops or stalls. \nIt  should  be  noted  that,  during  the  conduct  of  the  inventory  of  losses,  it  was  impossible  to \ndetermine the boundaries, and therefore the areas, of cultivated or built-on plots of ROW land in \nopen  swathes  of  land  adjacent  to the  roadway  because said  occupied  lands  are not  demarcated \nand  there  were  no  plans  available.  During  resettlement  plan  updating,  and  following  the \nmobilization  of  the  Provincial  Resettlement  Sub-Committee  Working  Group  (PRSC-WG)\u2014which \nincludes  among  its  members  district,  commune,  and  village  officials\u2014details  on  the  number  and \nseverity of loss of affected lands, including their owners and/or occupants, will be determined. \n\n4. \nLegal and Policy Framework. The Project resettlement policy has been developed taking \ninto  account  the  types,  characteristics,  and  severity  of  Project  impacts  on  assets  and  living \nconditions  of  the  affected  population,  guided  by  the  Constitution  of  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia, \nprevailing  legal  and  government  procedures  and  policies,  and  resettlement  policies  and \nrequirements adopted by the Government for specific development projects that have been funded \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other multilateral and bilateral donor agencies. \n\n5. \nProject  Entitlements.  One  key  objective  of  the  project  resettlement  policy  is  to  avoid  or \nminimize  impacts  on  people\u2019s  assets  and  sources  of  livelihood.  Since  the  majority  of  the  main \nstructures  that  the  Project  will  adversely  affect  are  used  for  business,  the  project  resettlement \npolicy  puts  much  emphasis  on  ensuring  that  the  affected  people  are  able  to  continue  with  their \nlivelihood during and after construction with minimal, or no, disruption to their business operation. \nMoreover, assets and incomes that will be inadvertently affected will be replaced or compensated \nat  replacement  cost.  The  ultimate  goal  of  the  project  resettlement  policy  is  to  help  ensure  that \naffected people are as well off or even better off than they were without the improvement of NR 56. \n\n6. \nIncome Restoration. Since most of the affected structures are shops, emphasis is given to \nensuring  that  their  owners  will  not  experience  any  stoppage  in  their  operation,  allowing  them  to \ncontinue with their roadside livelihood. All standing annual crops, including privately owned trees, \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n49 \n\nwill be allowed to be harvested before the start of civil works in a particular section of the project \nroad. To avoid impacts on the livelihood of the affected shopowners, the necessary transition and \nmoving allowances will be provided to shopowners; therefore, there is no compelling reason for an \nincome restoration program. Payment of such assistance will only be given once the site (residual \nor  outside  the  ROW)  that  these  shopowners  will  move  to  is  ready  to  ensure  that  the  cash \nassistance provided will not be used for other purposes. For households with farms inside the COI, \nthe  Project  will  ensure  that  they  will  be  able  to  harvest  their  crops  prior  to  construction.  These \naffected households will be allowed to continue cultivating the residual area of their farm inside the \nROW.  Moreover,  during  the  updating  of  the  resettlement  plan,  the  socioeconomic  condition  of \nthese  affected  households  will  be  determined,  and  if  it  is  found  that  their  loss  to  the  Project  is \nequivalent  to  10%  or  more  of  their  source  of  livelihood  or  income,  they  will  be  assisted  by  the \nPRSC-WG in finding replacement land outside of the ROW with similar productive capacity which \nthe affected household could lease. In addition, the PRSC will provide assistance in cash or in kind \n(such  as  seedlings  and  farm  inputs)  to  said  affected  households  to  improve  productivity  of \nreplacement land. \n\n7. \nResettlement  Strategy.  All 23 landless households will be provided replacement plots of \n105 square meters, with secure tenure and latrine, in a location in the commune. The location will \nalso  be  suitable  for  re-establishing  their  shops  or  business.  During  the  conduct  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey,  the  PRSC-WG  will  consult  with  the  aforementioned  households  in  the \nselection,  development,  and  arrangements  for  the  orderly  transfer  of  the  households  to  the \nrelocation  sites.  Affected  persons  with  entirely  affected  regular  shops  and  temporary  stores  and \nstalls will be provided with a place in the residual area of the ROW, if the residual area of the ROW \nland  that  they  presently  occupy  is  insufficient.  The  PRSC-WG,  in  consultation  with,  and  with  the \nactive participation of, the affected households will look for a place in the residual area of the ROW \nfor  this  purpose.  The  location  in  the  residual  area  of  the  ROW  where  the  regular  shops  and \ntemporary stores or stalls will transfer to should be mutually acceptable to the affected households \nand the Government. Moreover, the transfer of said shops and stores will be done in a way that will \nallow  the  affected  people  to  gradually  phase  out  their  operation  in  their  present  location  and \ngradually begin their operation in their new place. Under this arrangement, the shopowners, whose \nbusiness cater greatly to road users, will not experience any stoppage in their operation. Therefore, \nthe livelihood of these shopowners will not be severely affected by the Project road. \n\nEthnicity,  Vulnerability,  and  Gender  Issues.  There  are  110  households  headed  by \n8. \nwomen. In addition, five households are headed by elderly people and four households are headed \nby  a  person  with  a  disability.  With  the  exception  of  one  person  in  Kampong  Svay  commune  (an \nimmigrant  from  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic),  the  affected  households  and  their \nmembers  were  Khmer.  Apart  from  the  additional  cash  assistance  that  it  provided  to  vulnerable \nhouseholds, the Project will carry out separate consultations during resettlement plan updating and \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  their  special  needs  and  concerns  are  identified  and  addressed. \nRestoration or improvement of their socioeconomic conditions will be carefully monitored.  \n\n9. \nConsultation  and  Grievance  Redress.  Consultations,  public  meetings,  and  village \ndiscussions with the affected households and the local governments have been done before and \nduring  the  conduct  of  the  inventory  of  losses  as  part  of  the  resettlement  planning  process;  eight \nmeetings  were  held  in  NR  56.  These  activities  will  continue  during  the  updating  and \nimplementation of the resettlement plan, consistent with the Project\u2019s participatory approach. The \ngrievance  mechanism  has  been  designed  to  ensure  that  the  concerns  and  complaints  of  the \naffected households are readily addressed at the village level in a timely and satisfactory manner. \nThe affected households will be made fully aware of their rights through verbal and written means \nduring resettlement planning, updating, and implementation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n50  \n \n10. \nImplementation  Arrangements  The  MPWT,  through  its  Project  Management  Unit  3 \n(PMU-3)  and  its  Social  and  Environmental  Unit,  and  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Resettlement \nDepartment  of  the  interministerial  resettlement  committee  (IRC),  has  overall  responsibility  for \nplanning and implementing all aspects of resettlement. A working group will be set up at the PRSC \nwhich  will,  among  other  things,  carry  out  detailed  measurement  surveys,  determine  levels  of \ncompensation  and  entitlements  as  per  the  Project  resettlement  policy,  implement  the  Project \nresettlement  strategy,  and  serve  as  the  main  vehicle  for  ensuring  that  affected  people  are \nconsulted and their grievances are heard and resolved. \n\n11.  Monitoring.  The  PIU-3  and  the  Social  and  Environmental  Unit,  together  with  the \nResettlement  Department  of  the  IRC,  will  serve  as  the  Project\u2019s  internal  monitor.  The  PIU-3  is \nresponsible for submitting to the MPWT and ADB quarterly progress reports that include updates \non the progress of resettlement. Moreover, the IRC will hire an external monitoring agency (EMA) 1 \nmonth after the start of the updating of the resettlement plan. The agency will submit an inception \nreport soon after mobilization and, subsequently, quarterly reports on the progress of the updating \nand implementation of the resettlement plan. Copies of its monitoring reports will be submitted to \nthe  IRC,  the  MPWT,  and  ADB.  The  EMA  will  also  conduct  a  post-resettlement  implementation \nevaluation study 6 months after the completion of resettlement activities. \n\n12. \nResettlement Plan Cost Estimates. The total cost of resettlement for NR 56 is estimated \nat  $1.13  million.  This  includes  compensation  and  other  entitlements  to  be  provided  to  eligible \naffected  people  and  affected  households,  acquisition  and/or  preparation  of  replacement  plots  for \nthe  houses  and  shops,  operational  and  administrative  expenses,  external  monitoring,  and \ncontingencies. The MPWT and the IRC will ensure the timely availability of funds for resettlement, \nincluding  unforeseen  costs  in  excess  of  resettlement  budget  estimates,  to  satisfy  the  Project \nresettlement objectives. \n\n13. \nImplementation  Schedule.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated  by  the  PIU-3,  in  close \ncollaboration with the PRSC-WG and with assistance from consultant specialists, after the detailed \nengineering  designs  have  been  completed.  The  updated  resettlement  plan  will  be  submitted  to \nADB  for  review  and  approval.  The  schedule  of  civil  works  in  a  particular  section  of  NR  56  and \ncross-border facilities will be planned with the direct participation of the affected people through the \nPRSC-WG  to  ensure  that  construction  works  are  synchronized  with  the  relocation  of  affected \nstructures and the harvesting of crops and trees. The MPWT will not allow construction activities in \na specific section to commence until the affected people have been relocated in accordance with \nthe project resettlement policy and the specific section of the road is free of all obstructions. \n \n\nTable A9: Resettlement Schedule \n\nActivity \nResettlement Plan Preparation \nMPWT Submission of Draft Resettlement Plan \nADB Approval of Draft Resettlement Plan  \nResettlement Plan Updating  \nSubmission and ADB Approval of Updated Resettlement Plan \nImplementation of the Approved Updated Resettlement Plan  \nInternal Monitoring (submission of quarterly progress reports) \nExternal Monitoring (intermittent) \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MPWT = Ministry of Public Works and Transport. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14. \nDisclosure of Resettlement Plan.

Since 1992, with assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners,  the  Government  has  focused  on \nrehabilitation  of  the  core  national  infrastructure  that  is  required  for  the  development  of  the  economy.  Despite  the \nimprovement  of  national  roads,  many  provincial  and  most  rural  roads  are  in  poor  condition  and  parts  of  the  country  are \neffectively  isolated  during  the  wet  season.  Until  recently,  the  secondary  national  network,  which  links  provinces  to  the \nnational  road  network  and  provides  intraprovincial  links  to  the  tertiary  and  rural  network  and  to  Cambodia\u2019s  largely  rural \npopulation, has received little attention. The road network is split into two networks\u2014primary and tertiary roads\u2014which are \nonly loosely and unreliably interconnected. The situation hinders the development of cash-crop production in the rural areas, \nwhere markets in many places are limited to the local area due to lack of access. It also means that provincial centers and \nnumerous natural and cultural sites with tourism potential are inaccessible. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy for \n2009\u20132013 (the Rectangular Strategya started in 2004 with the first phase, now in its second phase) emphasizes generating \neconomic growth through the private sector, thus rehabilitation and development of the country\u2019s physical infrastructure is a \nprecondition  for  this.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Cambodia  for  2005\u20132009b  supports  ADB's  overall  strategy  for  poverty \nreduction through broad-based growth, inclusive social development, and stronger governance for sustainable development. \nGiven the continuing challenges in terms of rural access and sectorwide best practices, the country strategy for the transport \nsector  has  shifted  from  large-scale  public  sector  interventions  for  national  roads  to  (i)  fostering  technical  cooperation, \nstandard setting, and private investment in national transport; and (ii) supporting subregional projects that promote access to \nremote rural areas. In this context, this Project is a core intervention of ADB in the transport sector, as included in the country \noperations business plan 2008\u20132010,c as a Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) project. The project supports this strategy, \nparticularly as it enhances connectivity, economic exchange between Cambodia and other GMS countries, and access to \nsocial services in remote areas. \n \nThe key objectives of GMS cooperation in the transport sector, as identified by the GMS 10-Year Strategic Framework \n(2002\u20132012), are to (i) develop priority transport corridors critical to linking the subregion  together and promoting trade \nand investment; (ii) reduce nonphysical barriers to the movement of people, goods, and services; and (iii) formulate and \ncoordinate  strategies  to  ensure  that  the  transport  corridors  evolve  into  economic  corridors,  leading  to  agricultural \ndiversification, industrialization, and the creation of employment opportunities. This Project will support the GMS transport \nstrategy by improving the subregional connectivity at O'smach between Thailand and Cambodia, to enhance subregional \ntransport and trade. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis \n1. \n \nThe majority of poor people in Cambodia live in rural areas and base their livelihoods on agricultural activities. The project \narea is located in the northwestern part of Cambodia near the border with Thailand, and includes National Road (NR) 56 in \nthe provinces of Banteay Meanchey, and Oddar Meanchey. The project area has very high poverty levels of over 60%. The \ndire  poverty  situation  in  the  project  area  can  be  related  to  the  relative  physical  remoteness  and  poor  infrastructure  in  the \narea. Government services, such as health and education, rarely reach the interior and tend to be restricted to peri-urban \nareas.  Insecurity  and  lack  of  access  have  also  reduced  the  effectiveness  and  outreach  of  development  activities  by \nnongovernment  organizations.  Many  poor  people  face  food  shortages  for  several  months  and  are  vulnerable  to  external \nshocks due to reliance on subsistence agriculture and lack of access to income-earning opportunities, markets, and social \nservices  during the  wet season. Food  security  is  a major concern  of  poor  people. Most farmers  are  primarily  subsistence \nfarmers  growing  one  (rain-fed)  crop  a  year,  often  of  low  quality  or  yield  (significantly  lower  than  yields  in  similar  agro-\necological  areas).  Irrigation  is  scarce  and  unreliable.  The  principle  mode  of  transport  in  Cambodia  is  by  road.  In  spite  of \nefforts to improve the Cambodian road network since the mid-1990s, it is still in poor shape. One-quarter of the national road \nnetwork  is  in  good-to-fair  condition.  The  quality  of  the  rural  roads  deteriorate,  the  majority  of  them  are  in  poor-to-bad \ncondition. The transport system in Cambodia carries the majority of passengers and cargo on its road network. The length of \nthe  rural  road  network  is  approximately  28,000  kilometers,  or  about  70%  of  the  total  road  network  in  Cambodia.  The \nproposed Project aims to provide reliable all-year road access from provincial towns and agricultural rural areas to markets, \nemployment,  and  social  services  in  northwestern  Cambodia.  Improved  infrastructure  will  lead  to  increased  openness  for \ncommunities  deprived  of  adequate  access  to  information  and  markets.  The  improved  road  will  increase  investment  and \ndevelopment programs, access to off-farm employment, and diversification of risk and vulnerability. Access to markets will \nreduce  vulnerability  to  food  shortages  and  reliance  on  subsistence  agriculture.  Enhanced  access  will  also  enable  the \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nKey Issues \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nGovernment and other development agencies to provide social services to deprived areas. \n \nThe project road serves as a subregional link to Thailand, connecting NR 68 with the border at O'smach. Therefore, the \nProject  also  aims  to  increase  transport  efficiency  by  enabling  more  direct  routes  to  international  borders,  especially  in \nO'smach.  This  will  facilitate  stronger  bilateral  trade  between  Thailand  and  Cambodia.  Further,  the  Project  will  improve \naccess to historical and natural sites along project roads, which will help develop the tourism industry. For infrastructure \nimprovements, the Project entails rehabilitation of NR 56 and improving the cross-border facility between Cambodia and \nThailand at O'smach. These road sections are currently gravel roads with moderate levels of traffic; average daily traffic \nvolumes ranging from 1,400 vehicles to 3,200 vehicles, with a current yearly growth rate of over 8%. The ongoing Greater \nMekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement  Projectd  completed  all  bridge  and  culvert  rehabilitation  in  early  2008 \non  these  road  sections  providing  reliable  access  during  rainy  season.  This  increased  the  percentage  of  heavy  good \nvehicles  on  these  roads  from  about  3%  to  4%\u201310%,  depending  on  the  section.  Such  vehicles  also  have  a  growth  rate \nforecast of more than 8% and serve the agriculture and industry sectors to support the economic and social development \nin this region. Cross-border traffic volumes show similar figures\u2014about 1,400 vehicles per day with heavy goods vehicles\u2019 \npercentage of 5%. As the majority of cross-border cargo consists of agricultural products and apparel, the proposed road \nimprovements may facilitate growth of these industries. \n \nExpected Impacts on Poverty and Vulnerability  \nThe  impacts  on  poor  people  in  the  project  area  would  largely  depend  on  how  national  road  networks  NR  5  and  NR  6, \nrehabilitated  by  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement  Project  (footnote  d),  are  linked  to  the \nprovincial road network of NR 56 (which begins from NR 5 in Sisophon) and NR 68 (which begins from NR 6 in Kralanh), \nand  meet  at  Samraong  thus  forming  a  loop,  and  connect  with  the  rural  roads  in  the  area  rehabilitated  under  the  ADB-\nfinanced  Northwestern  Rural  Development  Project  (NRDP)e.  The  proposed  rehabilitation  of  NR  56  will  enhance  the \npoverty  impacts  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement  Project  (footnote  d)  and  the  NRDP. \nThe  rehabilitation  of  NR  56  will  strengthen  the  linkage  of  feeder  roads  under  the  NRDP  and  the  national  roads.  The \nProject will not have a direct impact on poverty reduction; however, the improved links of different road networks and the \nProject  will  have  an  indirect  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  Experiences  of  the  impact  of  feeder  roads  show  that  the \ncompetitiveness of transport facilities are important factors in the reduction of poverty. The savings in vehicle operating \ncosts has an impact on  poor people. Key impacts of the  Project include higher prices  for produce  and a  wider span of \nmarketing options for agricultural produce and increased opportunity for trade to reduce food shortages. Access to NR 5 \nand  NR  6,  a  main  trade  route  with  growing  markets,  will  further  increase  the  ability  of  farmers  to  reach  a  variety  of \nmarkets.  All-weather  access  along  NR  56  and  into  the  target  villages  of  the  NRDP  will  reduce  the  costs  of  accessing \nsocial  services  such  as  health  care  and  education.  The  effectiveness  of  government  and  other  agencies  in  providing \nservices  will  significantly  improve  as  both  feeder  roads  and  main  roads  in  this  area  are  improved.  Only  a  few \nnongovernment  organizations\u2014the  World  Food  Program  and  de-mining  companies\u2014are  active  within  and  around  the \nproject  area.  These  groups  are  mainly  engaged  in  emergency  relief  and  food  for  work  programs.  Most  of  their \nbeneficiaries are disabled, war widows, or displaced people who are poor or very poor. Increased access to these areas \nwill  facilitate  more  effective  outreach  for  organizations  engaged  in  direct  poverty  reduction  efforts. The  most  immediate \nimpact of the proposed project includes employment opportunities during road construction. This is especially important \nfor the landless and for those  with inadequate agricultural land. The key contribution of the Project to the infrastructure \nsector will be to strengthen links between rural and urban areas and between different regions of the country to promote \neconomic growth and development activities that are geographically balanced. \n \n2. \n \nThe pro-poor design features of the Project include recruitment of local labor for construction work. In addition, periodic \nmaintenance  of  the  Project  will  recruit  local  labor.  Together  with  increased  access  to  a  wider  range  of  employment \nactivities,  labor-intensive  road  construction  and  local  maintenance  contracts  provide  off-farm  employment  opportunities \nfor  poor  people.  Local  employment  opportunities  will  reduce  the  need  for  migration  to  Thailand,  and  thus  reduce \nvulnerability of those left behind. \n\nDesign Features \n\n \n\nC. \n  \n\nPoverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  N/A \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe  vulnerability  of  the  population  in  the  area,  and  especially  of  the  poor,  is  marked  by  a  number  of  factors.  These \ninclude adverse demographic and socioeconomic conditions, illiteracy, poor access to drinking water and health facilities, \nand low school enrolment and attendance in comparison with the overall national situation. Adult literacy is estimated at \n46% compared with the national average of over 67%. The population with safe access to drinking water is estimated at \nless  than  7%  (compared  with  the  national  average  of  29%)  and  around  4%  are  estimated  to  have  access  to  sanitary \nlatrines (compared with the national average of 15%); school attendance (5\u201314 age groups) is below 60% compared with \n66% for the whole country. This is indicative of high opportunity costs of children to attend school and the need to engage \nchildren in livelihood activities. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n54  \n \n \nThe incidence of disabled persons is high (2.2 per 1,000 compared with the national average of 1.5). This is a reflection \nof the prolonged civil strife and the presence of unexploded ordnance in the area. Access to credit is severely limited and \nsavings  are  small,  leading  to  frequent  asset  liquidation  to  meet  crises  (most  frequently  caused  by  health  shocks). \nReproductive  services  exist  but  are  largely  inaccessible  due  to  the  widely  dispersed  nature  of  the  population  and  long \ntravel  distances  and  times  needed  to  reach  these  (especially  in  Oddar  Meanchey).  People  are  forced  to  use  multiple \nsources  of  water  with  rainwater,  water  from  dug  wells,  and  water  collected  from  ponds  and  other  surface  sources. \nCommon diseases in the project area include dengue fever, malaria, colds, polio, and whooping cough. The Project will \ninclude a safe drinking water program for Project villages and schools as part of the civil works contract to provide safe \ndrinking water to the poor households and school children. \n \nSocial Risks \nThe  Cambodian  Demographic  Health  Survey  2000  reveals  that  Banteay  Meanchey  is  one  of  the  provinces  with  the \nlowest level of awareness of HIV/AIDS, with 79% of respondents aware of HIV/AIDS compared to the national average of \n95%  awareness.  A  2000  sexually-induced  virus  surveillance  testing  in  Banteay  Meanchey  found  the  following  rates  of \nHIV-positive people in the groups tested: 7.3% of police, 37.3% of direct commercial sex  workers, and 4% of pregnant \nwomen attending antenatal clinics. While this is a decrease from previous years, it is still very high. Recent data from the \nvoluntary  confidential  counseling  and  testing  sites  in  Siem  Reap  shows  that  new  HIV  infections  are  highest  among \nhousewives and lowest among sex workers. In some of the districts of Siem Reap, 40%\u201350% of households have at least \none family member  who migrated to Thailand for  work, and there is an increase in the number of housewives  who are \ngetting  infected  by  their  husbands  who  worked  in  Thailand.f  In  Oddar  Meanchey  and  Banteay  Meanchey  provinces, \nmobile and migrant populations are a big concern. The large number of migrants who go to Thailand and other provinces \nresettle  in  the  community  when  they  are  tested  as  HIV  positive.  All  three  (Banteay  Meanchey,  Oddar  Meanchey,  and \nSiem Reap) provinces rank low in terms of women\u2019s knowledge of HIV prevention. \n \nDue to its proximity to Thailand, the area is prone to labor mobility, both inward and outward. A large number of people \nmigrate to the towns and to Thailand in search of work, usually illegally. Frequently the brokers come to the villages to \nrecruit  young  men  and  women.  They  migrate  for  mainly  economic  reasons,  in  response  to  wage  differentials  between \nThailand and Cambodia, food shortages, and underemployment. Most of the migrants are poor or very poor young men \nand women with inadequate landholdings. Short-term migration takes place in response to underemployment during off-\npeak agricultural seasons and serves as a coping mechanism for food insecurity. The seasonal migrant laborers work just \nacross the border in agriculture for very low  wages and under harsh conditions. Some of the long-term migrants\u2014both \nmen  and  women\u2014travel  deep  into  Thailand  and  engage  in  unskilled  employment  activities  such  as  construction  work, \nmanufacturing, and food processing activities. Young men and women migrants also become victims of human trafficking \nand  are  forced  to  become  sex  workers.  One  of  the  major objectives  of  the  Project  is  to  enhance  economic  integration, \nand increase mobility and intra- and cross-border trade. While labor mobility is already high, mobility can be expected to \nincrease both to and from this area. Given the high incidence and low awareness of HIV/AIDS in Banteay Meanchey, and \nan expected increase of truck drivers going through the area, there is a risk of further spread of HIV/AIDS to and from the \nproject area. The high level of labor migration to Thailand poses a significant risk of human trafficking. In order to reduce \nthe risk of human trafficking and HIV/AIDS, an awareness raising program on HIV prevention and anti-human trafficking \nwill be included in the Project. The HIV/AIDS program will be targeted to the construction camps, vehicle operators and \ntruck drivers, sex workers, and villages and towns in the Project districts of NR 56 and NR 68. In addition, in the project \narea construction workers, the commune and district health clinics, and medical centers will be provided with HIV/AIDS \nand  sexually  transmitted  diseases  medical  packages.  The  ADB  Technical  Assistance  for  HIV  Prevention  and \nInfrastructure: Mitigating Risk in the Greater Mekong Subregion (footnote f) will conduct post-construction awareness on \nHIV/AIDS  program  in  the  NR  5  and  NR  6  areas,  and  Southeast  Asia  Regional  Department  Social  Sectors  Division  will \nconduct pre-construction HIV/AIDS awareness programs in the NR 56 and NR 68 areas. The Project will coordinate with \nboth of the programs in terms of experience of the programs and lessons learned. The lessons will be incorporated into \nplanning of the project's HIV/AIDS awareness campaign in the NR 56 and NR 68 areas. The Project will include human \ntrafficking awareness programs for NR 5, NR 6, NR 56, and NR 68 since this these roads are linked to the border area, \nlabor migration is high in this area, and this poses a risk of human trafficking to Thailand. The human trafficking program \nwill focus on safe migration and linking the poor to poverty reduction programs. It is expected that provision of local labor \nrecruitment  and  links  with  poverty  programs  will  reduce  migration  to  Thailand.  Road  safety  is  a  major  concern  of  the \ncommunities given the experience of NR 6 and NR 6. The improvement of NR 56 will possibly lead to an increase in the \nnumber of accidents on the Project roads. A community-based road safety program will be part of the overall road safety \nprogram  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  include  a  baseline  survey  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project  and  a  poverty  and \nimpact  assessment  survey  at  the  end  of  the  Project  to  assess  HIV/AIDS  awareness,  incidence,  access  to  HIV/AIDS \ntreatment,  in  and  out  labor  migration,  human  trafficking,  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  waterborne  diseases,  seasonal \nemployment in construction works, reduction of vehicle operation cost, road accidents etc. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n \n2. \n\n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\nProvide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n\nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing      \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making      \n\n  Empowerment \n\nDuring the preparation of resettlement plan, consultation was done with the affected households.  \n\nWas a C&P plan prepared? \n\n \n3. \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). \n \n\n  Yes    \n\n  No \n\nC. \n\n Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues. In the project area, women are mainly engaged in small business, petty trading, wage employment, and \nfarming.  However,  opportunity  for  wage  employment  is  limited,  which  has  resulted  in  illegal  migration  of  a  significant \nnumber of women to Thailand. Migrant women farm workers in Thailand work in harsh conditions for low  wages. Often \nthey  are  harassed  by  the  law  enforcement  authority  and  sometimes  have  to  leave  behind  most  of  their  earnings  when \nthey return. Increasing numbers of married women are getting infected with HIV by their husbands who have worked in \nThailand. Women vendors and small entrepreneurs lack access to capital. The land acquisition aspect of the Project will \nhave an impact on the women entrepreneurs and small vendors who are located along the roadside. International Labor \nOrganization studies show that in Cambodia nearly 47% of road workers are women. The Project can create employment \nopportunities for poor women during construction and through road maintenance work. \n \n2.  Key Actions \n \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n(ii) \n\n \nThe  resettlement  plan  and  prevention  of  HIV  and  anti-human-trafficking  programs  will  include  specific  strategies  to \naddress gender issues in the Project. The following are the gender-specific strategies and measures: \n(i) \n\nConsultation meeting on resettlement activities will be held separately with women, households headed by women, \nand elderly women. \nAt the inception of the Project, a community meeting will be held with the affected households to inform them about \nresettlement activities; participation of poor women and women who are household heads will be ensured. \nThe  community  meeting  will  include  information  on  resettlement  activities,  compensation,  grievance  procedures, \nand  impact  of  the  project  on  livelihood  activities  related  to  small  business,  petty  trading,  loss  of  agricultural \nproduce,  and  other  productive  assets.  The  objective  of  the  meeting  is  to  provide  affected  communities  with \nunderstanding of resettlement issues and better access to compensation resources and information on grievance \nprocedures. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  During preparation of loss of inventory, men and women from the households will participate in discussion of loss \nof inventory. Compensation will be given to both men and women from the households. Specific attention will be \ngiven to paying the compensation on time to poor women who head households and elderly women. \n\n(v)  Relocation  of  houses  will  include  separate  discussion  with  women  from  affected  households,  women  who  head \n\nhouseholds, and elderly women (ethnic minority households if there are any). \n\n(vi)  All  employment  for  the  Project  will  respect  Government  commitments  to  gender  equity,  including  staffing  in  the \n\nproject implementation unit and resettlement committees. \n\n(vii)  An  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  awareness  campaign  will  be  conducted  during  the  construction  phase.  The \neducational materials,  workshop, and campaign on HIV/AIDS and  Human Trafficking Prevention Program  will  be \nconducted separately for women. These programs will be planned and implemented with the district and commune \nwomen's councils. \n\n(viii)  Construction  contractors  will  ensure  that  (a)  no  child  will  be  used,  (b)  no  differential  wages  are  paid  to  men  and \nwomen for work of equal value, (c) basic facilities (water, sanitation) for men and women workers are provided in \nthe construction camps, (d) separate bathing and toilet facilities are provided for women workers, and (e) day care \nservices will be provided for the children of women construction workers. \n\n(x) \n\n(ix)  Disaggregated  monitoring  indicators  by  gender  will  be  developed  for  monitoring  of  social  benefits,  economic \nopportunities,  seasonal  wage  employment  in  construction  works,  road  safety,  resettlement  activities,  HIV \nprevention, and the anti-human-trafficking program. \nThe  monitoring  indicators  will  include  (a)  women's  participation  in  resettlement  committees,  capacity  building \ntraining, the consultation meeting, livelihood training, and restoration of income; (b) recruitment of women laborers \nin construction and provision of separate bathing and toilet facilities in the construction site; (c) child care facility in \nconstruction  camps;  (d)  participation  of  women  in  road  safety  awareness  campaign;  and  (e)  women  and  girls' \nawareness on safe migration, human trafficking, and HIV/AIDS. \n\n(xi)  The project-specific gender strategy with be implemented by the executing agency in collaboration with the Project \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n56  \n \n\nimplementation and supervision consultants. \n\n(xii)  National  consultants  on  social  development  and  gender  will  be  included  in  the  consulting  services  for  the \nimplementation of the gender strategy. Terms of references for the social development and gender are included in \nconsulting  services.  The  budget  to  implement  the  gender  strategy  is  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  and \nconsulting  service  package  on  HIV  prevention  and  anti-human-trafficking  programs. The  social  development  and \ngender specialist will monitor overall implementation of the gender strategy in various components of the Project. \n\n \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nIII.

The road is about 113 kilometers (km) long. Generally, the \nexisting horizontal alignment will be retained, however a realignment of NR 56 will be carried out to bypass \nthe  Banteay  Chhmar  temple.  The  temple  is  protected  by  royal  decree  and  the  surrounding  area  has  a \nseries of protective zones which severely restrict the improvement of NR 56. The realignment will avoid \nthese zones. The realignment is 11 km long and increases the overall length of NR 56 by approximately \n0.5 km. Many years of civil disturbance have caused the road to be neglected; it is now in poor condition \nwith some bridges being on the point of collapse. Replacement of bridges and some structures along NR \n56  has  already  been  completed  under  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Cambodia  Road  Improvement \nProject.2 Implementation of the Project will provide all-weather access to remote and poorly serviced rural \nareas and improve community accessibility to markets and social infrastructure. It will promote subregional \neconomic and social development in the project area. \n \n3. \nImprovement  of  the  existing  cross-border  facility  at  O'smach  in  Oddar  Meanchey  Province  on \nthe border with Thailand will also be undertaken. New cross-border facilities will be constructed to meet \nGreater Mekong Subregion requirements and will be suitable for one-stop processing. The site will be \nlocated at the southern end of an existing 0.9 km cement concrete pavement, which will extend to the \nborder gate with shopping outlets located to the east and a hotel casino on each side of the road. The \nsite for the facility is approximately 4 hectares (ha). Truck and cargo processing will be separated from \nprivate  vehicle  and  bus  movements.  The  development  will  provide  new  customs,  CAMCONTROL \n(police force controlling the boarder post), and quarantine and administration buildings. \n \nB. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources  \n\n \nCambodia's climate is dominated by the monsoon which causes distinct wet and dry seasons. \n4. \nThe southwest monsoon brings the rainy season from May to October. The northeast monsoon brings \ndrier and cooler air from early November to March, then hotter air prevails in April and early May. The \nsouthern part of the country has a 2-month dry season whereas the northern areas have a 4-month \ndry  season.  Temperatures  are  fairly  uniform  throughout  the  country,  with  only  small  variations  from \nthe  average  annual  temperature  of  around  28\u00b0C.  January  is  the  coldest  month  and  April  is  the \nwarmest.  Most  of  Cambodia\u2019s  regions  have  an  average  wind  velocity  of  less  than  3  meters  per \nsecond. \n \n5. \nNR 56 commences in Sisophon and runs north. West of NR 56, the geological conditions are \npediments while east of NR 56 the land is covered by lake beds. From Kbal Spean village (km 16) to \nThma  Puok  (km  42),  deltaic  deposits  dominate  both  sides  of  the  project  road.  From  Thma  Puok  to \nSamraong, most parts of the land along the road are alluvial fans while pediments are found mostly at \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Manila (Loan 1945-CAM). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n58  \n \nBanteay Chhmar Protected Landscape (BCPL) at km 44 and north of NR 56 in Char village (km 66). \nNR 56 is 30\u201350 meters (m) above sea level, except in the vicinity of the BCPL where it rises to 70 m \nabove sea level. \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n \n6. \nForests make up a major part of the country's natural resources. Hill evergreen, tropical rain, \nand  dryland  evergreen  forests  are  found  in  the  humid  coastal  ranges,  humid  northeastern  uplands, \nand the very humid to subhumid low-altitude areas. In the project area, roadside vegetation consists \nof rice crops and mixed dipterocarp and woodland vegetation interspersed among paddy areas. There \nare no primary forests in the project area. \n \n7. \nNR 56 runs on the edge of the BCPL, which consists of flat plains covered by degraded dry \ndipterocarp and open woodland forest. The BCPL was declared a protected area by royal decree in \n1993 and includes a strip about 500 m wide to the east of NR 56. Development has occurred along \nNR 56 within the BCPL where woodland forest has been removed for about 1 km on either side of the \nroad. The villages of Sras Chrei, Banteay Chhmar Cheung, Banteay Chhmar Tbong, and Thmar Dek \nKes are situated along NR 56 within the BCPL, and three villages are situated inside the BCPL near \nthe Banteay Chhmar temple. In 2002, the governor of Banteay Meanchey province, with reference to \nthe royal decree on the protection of natural area and in recognition of the needs of the local people \nwho already occupy or use the land alongside NR 56, informed the people that (i) from Thmar Pourk \nto  Banteay  Chhmar,  the  Government  would  allow  them  to  continue  to  use  and  occupy  the  land \nlocated  alongside  NR  56  for  a  distance  of  400  m  on  both  sides  of  NR  56;  (ii)  from  Thmar  Pourk  to \nBoeung Trakourn, they would be allowed to use land 5 km on both sides of the road; and (iii) at the \nborder  with  Thailand,  they  would  be  allowed  to  use  land  3  km  on  both  sides  of  the  road.  Concrete \nposts have been placed to mark the extent of the community area with respect to NR 56; these are \nset back about 400 m from NR 56. The works on NR 56 will have no impact on the BCPL. According \nto the Ministry of Environment, no rare or endangered species exist in the BCPL. \n \n\n3. \n\nCultural Resources \n\n \n8. \nNR 56 also goes around the Banteay Chhmar temple at chainage 57 km. The temple is a large \nancient  cultural  monument,  dating  back  to  the  Angkor  Wat  period.  It  is  governed  by  a  special  royal \ndecree  dated  11  March  2003.  The  decree  indicates  there  are  three  zones  of  protection  for  Banteay \nChhmar: Zone 1 (core zone, needs high conservation), Zone 2 (buffer zone, rich with artifacts which \nconstrain  inappropriate  development),  and  Zone  3  (support  zone  which  is  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment). As the temple is nominated for World Heritage status, the Ministry of Culture and Fine \nArts  indicated  that,  due  to  the  proposed  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization (UNESCO) status, it will not approve a route though any of the zones. In order to avoid \nthe  three  zones  of  protection,  and  to  avoid  adverse  impacts  to  the  temple,  the  Project  will  involve \nconstruction of an 11-km bypass on sparse scrubland. \n \nC. \n \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nDrainage \n\n \n9. \nSome localized flooding occurs on the flat lower areas of NR 56. Raising the embankment will \ngive a flood-free road; some additional cross drainage will be necessary through the road embankment. \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n \n10. \nThere are no fisheries resources in the project area and no adverse impacts are anticipated on \nother ecological resources. The Project will not impact on the wildlife or forestry reserves of the BCPL. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59 \n\nNo adverse impacts on biodiversity in the higher terrain near O'smach are anticipated. \n \n\n3. \n\nCultural Resources  \n\n \n11. \nThe Banteay Chhmar temple has three zones around it which are protected by royal decree, \nand this temple is nominated for World Heritage status. The proposed bypass at Banteay Chhmar will \nrealign the route to the east and so avoid disturbance to the sensitive zones. If this new alignment is \nadopted there will be no adverse environmental impacts to the temple. There will be no other adverse \ncultural impacts. \n \n\n4. \n\nNoise and Dust \n\n \n12. \nNoise  and  dust  from  unpaved  roads  is  a  major  nuisance  for  roadside  residents,  especially \nthose in built-up areas. As traffic volumes increase, this problem will get worse until road surfaces are \npaved. The Project will have positive impacts on the quality of life of roadside residents as it will result \nin a significant reduction in dust and, to a smaller extent, noise. \n \nDuring  site  works  for  improvement  of  NR  56  and  border  facilities,  mitigation  measures  for \n13. \nnoise and dust will be necessary. To reduce noise impacts (i) construction activities will be avoided at \nnight close to residential areas, and (ii) vehicles will be equipped with effective mufflers. To minimize \ndust  (i)  construction  sites  and  access  roads  through  villages  will  be  watered  several  times  a  day \ndepending on the condition, and (ii) road paving will be commenced first in built-up areas to minimize \nthe  number  of  inhabitants  affected  by  dust.  Blasting  will  be  controlled  to  minimize  disturbance.  As \nmuch as possible, existing commercial quarries will be used. \n \n\n5. \n\nConstruction Materials \n\n \n14. \nBorrow  pits  will  need  to  be  located  along  the  roads  as  a  source  of  subgrade  material;  when \nfinished  these  will  be  revegetated.  Those  located  on  adjoining  private  land  may  be  used  for  fish  or \nduck ponds or for storing irrigation water for use in the dry season. This has been requested by local \nvillage residents. Gravel and crushed stone will be hauled by trucks from more distant gravel and rock \ndeposits. \n \nPre-cast  concrete  beams  are  likely  to  be  manufactured  at  a  site  centrally  located  within  the \n15. \nProject  and  then  transported  to  site  and  erected.  Apart  from  the  bridge  abutments  and  possibly  for \nlarge box culverts, quantities of cement and aggregate that would normally have been brought on site \nwill be significantly reduced. \n \n16. \nFuel, oil, and bitumen storage areas will be located well away from any watercourses. Storage \nareas will be bunded and provided with interceptor traps so that accidental spills do not contaminate \nthe  environment.  All  waste  oil  will  be  stored  and  disposed  of  to  acceptable  oil  industry  standards. \nWashing-down  water  will  be  directed  to  this  system  and  held  in  separation  areas  for  treatment. \nWherever  possible,  refueling  will  be  carried  out  at  a  fuel  storage  area  and  not  permitted  within,  or \nadjacent to, watercourses. \n \n\n6. \n\nCleanup of the Construction Site \n\n \n17.  When  construction  is  completed,  the  contractors  will  clean  up  the  construction  sites  by \nremoving all equipment and buildings and carrying out site remediation work. \n \n\n7. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\n \n18. \n\nThe main risks during the construction stage may arise from (i) inadequate sanitation facilities \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n60  \n \nin  work  camps,  (ii)  lack  of  preparation  for  accidents  and  injuries,  (iii)  introduction  of  sexually \ntransmitted or other diseases by immigrant workers, and (iv) outbreaks of malaria in the labor force. \nTo avoid these risks, (i) camps will be located well away from communities; (ii) the contractor will be \nrequired to prepare a worker health and safety plan which will include provision of sanitation facilities, \nequipment, and medical care; (iii) workers will receive health and safety training; and (iv) workers will \nunder go pre-employment health screening. \n \nD. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  will  ensure  that  the  environmental \n19. \nmitigation and monitoring measures in the IEE will be included in the bidding documents as a basis for \nthe  contractors  to  prepare  and  implement  construction  environmental  management  plans  (CEMPs). \nPrior  to  site  works,  the  contractors  shall  be  required  by  the  MPWT  to  submit  the  CEMPs  with \ninformation on the location of various site activities. It will also include the organizational structure and \nresponsibilities  with  regard  to  implementation  and  reporting,  budget,  time  frame,  schedules,  specific \nmitigation measures, as well as procedures and responsibilities to address complaints related to the \nenvironmental impacts of the construction activities. The CEMPs will be reviewed by the Social and \nEnvironmental Unit of the MPWT with assistance from the construction supervision consultant. After \napproval  by  the  Social  and  Environmental  Unit  the  contractor  will  be  responsible  for  complying  with \nthe  requirements  of  the  CEMP.  The  MPWT  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  ensuring  proper \nimplementation  of  the  CEMP  as  well  as  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  for  various  project \nphases. \n \n20. \nDuring  the  detailed  design  stage,  close  consultation  will  be  undertaken  with  line  ministries \nsuch  as  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology,  Ministry  of \nAgriculture Forestry and Fisheries, and the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts. \n \n21. \nUnit, and these will be incorporated into the quarterly project progress reports submitted to ADB. \n \nE. \n \n22. \nInformal interviews were conducted with commune residents along NR 56. They were asked \nfor their opinions on traffic pollution and disturbance and if they saw any benefits to them from a new \nroad. There have also been meetings with representatives from the MPWT, Social and Environmental \nUnit, Ministry of Environment, and other government agencies. Based on consultations with affected \npeople,  air  pollution  due  to  excessive  dust  emission  as  well  as  noise  is  currently  a  problem.  The \nrespondents recognize that improvement of the road will result in reduced dust levels and will shorten \ntravel time. Smooth asphalt surfacing can also reduce traffic noise levels. Concerns raised about road \nsafety will be addressed through the road safety program component of the Project. \n \nF. \n \n23. \nResults of the environmental assessment study indicate the Project will not result in significant \nenvironmental  impacts.  Potential  impacts  identified  during  construction  and  operation  phases  will  be \nadequately  addressed  through  implementation  of  mitigation  measures,  monitoring  activities,  and \nenvironmental  capacity  strengthening  programs,  along  with  estimated  costs  and \ninstitutional \nresponsibilities  identified  in  the  IEE.  Consequently,  the  lEE  is  regarded  as  sufficient  and  an \nenvironmental impact assessment is not necessary. \n\nThe  construction  supervision  consultant  will  submit  results  to  the  Social  and  Environmental \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 July 2009) \n \n\u2013 \n", "riel/s (KR) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "KR1.00\n$1.00\n", "= \n= \n", "$0.0002387 \nKR4,189 \n", "ADB \nASEAN \nBCPL \nCBTA \nCEMP \nCOI \nDDIS \nEIRR \nEMA \nEMP \nGMS \nIEE \nIRC \nKEXIM \nMOU \nMPWT \nNCB \nNR \nPMU \nPRSC-WG \nROW \nSEC \nTA \nVOC \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "construction environmental management plan \ncorridor of influence \ndetailed design and implementation supervision \neconomic internal rate of return \nexternal monitoring agency \nenvironmental management plan \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n\u2013  Banteay Chhmar Protected Landscape \n\u2013  Cross-Border Transport Agreement \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Greater Mekong Subregion \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Export Import Bank of Korea \n\u2013  memorandum of understanding \n\u2013  Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n\u2013 \n\u2013  National Road \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Provincial Resettlement Sub-Committee Working Group \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Southern Economic Corridor \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "initial environmental examination \ninterministerial resettlement committee \n", "technical assistance \nvehicle operating cost \n", "national competitive bidding \n", "project management unit \n", "right of way \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n", " \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars unless otherwise stated. \n", "C.
