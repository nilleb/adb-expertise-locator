The cessation of economic \ntransfers to Tajikistan from the former Soviet Union, the transition \nprocess, a civil war, and the subsequent political instability that \nstarted  in  1992  and  continued  until  1997  have  resulted  in  a \nprolonged economic depression. The aftermath of the civil war \nand economic depression have put more than 83% of the Tajik \npopulation below the poverty line.  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) responded to the postconflict \nsituation in 1999 through the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project \n(SSRP)  that  provided  basic  rehabilitation  assistance  to  the \neducation, health, and social protection sectors. The major focus \nin the health sector was  to rehabilitate health facilities, provide \nsupplies such as drugs and equipment, and train doctors and \nnurses to address immediate needs.      \n \nWith  security  and  political  stability  restored,  humanitarian \nagencies that have supported health service delivery and drug \nsupply in the postconflict period are about to exit. Currently more \nthan  30%  of  health  expenditure  is  financed  by  humanitarian \nagencies. A comprehensive social sector study by ADB identified \nthe following as major concerns in the health sector: (i)  high \nburden of diseases and precarious health status of the population; \n(ii)  shrunken  public  health  expenditures  and  inefficient  use  of \nresources; (iii) collapsed public health care system; (iv) increased \nout-of\u2013pocket payment by beneficiaries; (v) reduced access to \nand use of health services, particularly by the poor; (vi) weakened \nand  unreliable  health  information  system;  and  (vii)  limited \nmanagerial, technical, administrative, and financial capacity at all \nlevels of the health sector. The study highlighted the urgent need \nto replace the drug supply system introduced and managed by \nhumanitarian  agencies  with  a  well-managed,  sustainable \nprocurement and distribution system before their exit. The health \nsector  reform  project  (HSRP)  is  designed  to  respond  to  the \nfindings of this study.  ", "iv \n  At the recent consultative group meeting in May 2003, substantial \ngrant assistance was pledged, but is not yet visible. Even when \ngrant funds are forthcoming, it will be necessary to ensure that \nthey  are  used  efficiently  to  address  key  system  deficiencies. \nHSRP  provides  an  investment  framework  and  a  vehicle  for \ndialogue  on  policy  and  priorities  and  hence  provides a useful \nbasis for actions by Government and by aid agencies. \n \nObjectives and Scope  The goal of the HSRP is to improve people\u2019s health, in particular \nthe poor, women, and children in Tajikistan. The HSRP has three \nobjectives: (i)  improve the management capacity of the health \nsector and  system efficiency through institutional strengthening \nand reforms; (ii) increase equitable access to and use of quality \nbasic health services by the poor, women, and children; and (iii) \nsupport informed policy dialogue to pursue reform.   \n \n  The HSRP has three components: (i) institutional development for \nthe health sector, (ii) drug supply and quality control, and (iii) \nefficient  and  sustainable  delivery  of  a  pro-poor  health  service \npackage.  The  HSRP  will  have  national  and  pilot  district \ncomponents. Health service improvement will be implemented in \nfive rural  districts selected for  severity of poverty and level of \ninfant and maternal mortality. The HSRP will focus investment in \nareas  that  will  have  the  greatest  impact  on  the  poor  and \nvulnerable.    \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is $9.375 million equivalent, of which $5.340 \nmillion is foreign exchange and $4.035 million equivalent is local \ncurrency.   \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  % \n   Asian Development  5.340  2.160  7.500  80 \nBank \n   Government   \u2013  1.875  1.875  20 \n         \n  Total  5.340  4.035  9.375  100 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nIn view of Tajikistan\u2019s debt position and as requested by the \nGovernment, ADB is trying to mobilize cofinancing in the form of \ngrants from other sources to substitute for the loan particularly for \nthe \u201csoft\u201d components like training and consulting services. Once \ngrants are firmly committed, corresponding savings under the loan \nmay be reallocated or cancelled as appropriate.     \n ", "v \nLoan Amount and Terms  The proposed ADB loan is for SDR5.238 million ($7.5 million \nequivalent) from its  Asian Development Fund. The balance of \n$1.875 million equivalent will be provided by the Government. The \nADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The ADB loan will include \nfinancing of the interest charge. The Borrower will be the Republic \nof Tajikistan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The President\u2019s Office will be the Executing Agency with a deputy \nArrangements  prime minister as project coordinator. A  project implementation \nunit (PIU) will be established within the Ministry of Health (MOH). \nA Project Administration Unit (PAU) will be established under the \nPIU. The PAU will be shared with the parallel Education Sector \nReform  Project  and  will  function  as  a  secretariat  providing \nadministrative support to both projects. In each HSRP district, a \ndistrict  PIU  will  be  established.  The  PIU  will  make  technical \ndecisions  on  the  projects.  A  national  steering  committee  and \ndistrict supervisory groups will be  established to provide policy \nguidance and coordination. \n \nExecuting Agency  The President\u2019s Office \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nEquipment  and  supplies  will  be  procured  by  international \ncompetitive  bidding  for  contracts  in  excess  of  $500,000, \ninternational shopping for contracts in excess of $100,000, and \ndirect  purchase  for  contracts  less  than  $100,000. Civil works \nvalued  at  $1  million  or  less  will  be  carried  out  under  local \ncompetitive bidding.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  to  supply  164  person-months  of  services  (48  \ninternational and 106 domestic) will be recruited following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging  international  and  domestic \nconsultants. International consulting firms or individuals will be \nengaged to provide these consulting services. \n \nProject Benefits and  The HSRP will benefit the whole population indirectly through \nBeneficiaries  nationwide components.  Across MOH, capacity will be built  to \n  effectively plan, finance, and manage the health sector.  Reforms \n  in health services delivery and financing aim to create a more \n  responsive, sustainable, and equitable system. \n   \n ", "vi \n  The  HSRP  will  improve  people\u2019s  health,  especially  women, \nchildren,  and  the  poor,  in  five  of  the  poorest  districts. \nApproximately  5.5%  of  the  population  of  6.3  million  will  be \ncovered.  The  targeted  districts  have  high  infant  and  maternal \nmortality rates. The HSRP will focus on the health care levels \nmost used by the poor and will pilot-test the primary health care \n(PHC) system based on family group practices (FGPs). PHC is an \ninternationally  proven  cost-effective  method  to  respond  to  the \nneeds of the poor, women, and  children. The FGP system  can \nserve  the  poor  and  vulnerable  better  than  will  other  types  of \nservices, including hospitals. Based on lessons learned from pilot \ntesting,  the  PHC  system  will  be  expanded  nationwide,  thus \ndisseminating the benefits gained through the HSRP. To induce \nsynergy effects, the HSRP will work in the same districts with the \nEducation Sector Reform Project.  The HSRP is classified as a \ncore poverty intervention with a  human development focus and \ngender and development.      \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  Successful  implementation  of  the  reform-oriented  project  will \ndepend largely on the capacity of MOH. The HSRP will strengthen \nMOH\u2019s  capacity  to  analyze  situations,  and  elaborate  and \nimplement  reform strategies and action plans. The HMIS will be \nset up to plan, monitor, and evaluate reforms. \n \nA significant risk is the limited capacity of MOH staff to implement \nthe work promptly and efficiently. Close monitoring and oversight \nby experienced staff and committed government officials are key \nto  smooth  project  implementation.  This  risk  will  be  managed \nthrough the continued involvement of a deputy prime minister in \nthe President\u2019s Office, an effective implementation structure built \non the successful framework developed by the SSRP, provision of \ncapacity-building  support,  and  engagement  of  experienced \ndomestic and international consultants. \n \nThe changes being introduced in health services delivery require \na change in  the attitude of staff and clients and a change in \nmanaging resources for optimal use. The HSRP will invest in a \npublic  information campaign to  elicit  public perceptions on  a \nresponsive health system, and will strengthen management.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The TA financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund in \n  the  amount  of  $300,000  will  be  provided  initially  to  support \nbuilding  management  information  systems  for  informed  policy \ndialogue,  decision  making,  and  monitoring.  The  technical \nassistance (TA) will serve as a central policy tool to improve \nMOH\u2019s planning and budgeting and support reform in the health \nsector. The objectives are to (i) develop the health management \ninformation system (HMIS)  framework and action plans at  the \nMOH, region,  and  district levels;  (ii) provide a basis for planning, ", "vii \n  monitoring, and measuring system performance and progress of \nreforms; and (iii) provide a mechanism to support monitoring and \npolicy dialogue between the Government and aid agencies. \n   \nA second grant of $150,000 financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Special  Fund  will  develop  a  long-term  national  drug \nprocurement and distribution strategy. The TA objectives are to (i) \nsupport  policy  dialogue  and  develop  a  clear  strategy  and \nframework for establishing a drug procurement and distribution \nsystem; (ii) prepare a rational plan for  warehousing, equipment \ndistribution, and staffing; and (iii) provide operational guidelines on \nthe whole procurement and distribution process. \n \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Health Sector Reform Project. The report also describes two \nproposed technical assistance (TA) grants: (i) Planning and Policy Dialogue for Health Reform, \nand (ii) Developing the Drug Procurement and Distribution Strategy, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTAs.   \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Cessation of economic transfers to Tajikistan from the former Soviet Union following \nindependence in 1991 and the release of ethnic pressures contributed to the outbreak of civil \nwar in mid-1992. Macroeconomic conditions worsened until the 1997 cease-fire agreement. \nSince then the economy has shown signs of recovery, but the gross domestic product (GDP) in \n2001 was  only 43% of that of 1991. Benefits  from improvement in  GDP growth have not \nreached the household level. GDP per capita in 2001 was $162. Annual inflation rate, although \nmuch reduced compared with the level  in the early 1990s, is  still high, while real wages \ndecreased to 25% of 1991 levels in 1999.1 The aftermath of the civil war together with economic \ndepression has put more than 83% of the Tajik population below the poverty line. \n \n3.  The  Government  places  a  high  priority  on  poverty  reduction.  External  agencies \nsupported the development of the national poverty reduction strategy adopted in 2002 that sets \nout efficient and fair provision of basic social services as  one of  the key approaches. The \npoverty  partnership  agreement  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the \nGovernment stipulates that ADB and the Government will promote efficient and effective social \nservices delivery to the poor and rationalize social sector expenditures to ensure equitable \naccess. The Government has adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2015 as \nthe key targets in poverty reduction (Table 1).       \n \nTable 1:  Tajikistan Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \n \n        Latest  2015 \nArea       Goal  Indicator  1990  year a  (target) \nPoverty  Reduce poverty by 50% by 2015  % of population   \u2013    82.6  58 \nChild Health  Reduce infant mortality rate by two thirds  Deaths per  40.4    36.7  25 \nfrom 1990 to 2015  1,000 live \n  births \nMaternal  Reduce maternal mortality ratio by three  Deaths per  \u2013    43.1  35 \nHealth  quarters from 1990 to 2015  100,000 live \n  births \nReproductive  Increase access to contraceptives   % of  female   \u2013    21.8  30 \nHealth  population     \n  aged 15-45   \nAdult Health  Halt and reverse incidence of tuberculosis  Incidence per  \u2013  33.5        22 \n  and other major infectious diseases  by  100,000 \n2015  population \n(\u2014 = no data available.) \na  Official figures.

Tajikistan\u2019s Household Livelihood Security Assessment Study,  Background Report to CARE. Dushanbe.  ", "2  \n \n4.  Tajikistan has a rapidly growing population with a young population structure. The \npopulation in 2000 was about 6.3 million with 49.5% under 17 years old. This implies that health \nservices must be planned to accommodate the needs of this young population. The fertility rate \ndeclined from 5.0 in 1990 to 3.7 in 2000. But it is still the highest among the Central Asian \nrepublics (CARs) and risks doubling the population every 20 years. \n \n5.  The reduction in the GDP and the parallel reduction of the proportion of GDP spent on \nhealth have resulted in a very large decline in per capita spending on health. Public health \nexpenditure as a percentage of GDP was only 0.9% in 2002 from 4.8% in 1990. This is the \nlowest  among  CARs  and  much  lower  than  the  5%  target  figure  for  developing  countries \nadvocated  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO).  In  2001  per  capita  public  health \nexpenditure was only $1.60 equivalent, about 1.5% of that in 1990.  \n \n6.  During the Soviet era, the health system in Tajikistan was characterized by widespread \naccess to health services, but the services were costly and very inefficient (overstaffing and \nexcess accommodation, hospital-based services biased toward curative rather than preventive \ncare).  It  provided  low-quality  care  and was  based  on  outdated  treatment  protocols.  The \nconsiderable  reduction  in  financial  resources  and  enormous  demographic  pressure  have \nresulted in: (i) lower quality of health services, (ii) collapse of the already inefficient public health \nsystem, and (iii) increased prevalence of informal out-of-pocket payments for officially free \nservices.  Together  with  prevailing  poverty  at  household  level,  the  reduction  resulted  in \ndecreased service use and deteriorating health status of the population. The sector analysis is \nin Appendix 1.  \n \n7.  Since 1991, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has adopted major changes in national health \npolicy  directions.  Particularly  in  1998-2000,  MOH  developed  a  health  sector  reform  plan \nsupported by WHO and the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO). In adjusting to \nthe socioeconomic, demographic, and epidemiological situation, the reform emphasizes primary \nhealth care  (PHC) system based on  a  family  group  practice  (FGP)2  as the strategy for \ndelivering health services. The strategy responds to client needs (particularly to the poor, \nwomen, and children),  and provides  cost-effective, good-quality care that is equitable  with \nsustainable access.  \n \n8.  International assistance to Tajikistan in the postconflict period has concentrated on \nhumanitarian assistance. Humanitarian nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have been active \nin  providing  health  services  to  the  population  affected  by  conflict  and  poverty.  A  shift  in \ninternational assistance is now occurring from emergency relief and short-term rehabilitation to \ndevelopment. As long-term stability has been secured, the nature of  the required work has \nbegun to shift. Development agencies started to work in the health sector in the late 1990s, \nwhen NGOs and emergency-oriented agencies were beginning to withdraw. In 1998 the World \nBank approved the Primary Health Care  Project that focused on  strengthening PHC in two \ndistricts.  The  ADB-funded  Social  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project  (SSRP)  approved  in  1999 \nfocused on rehabilitating and re-equipping schools and health facilities.  ADB and the World \nBank collaborate closely through information exchange to avoid duplication and consolidate \nefforts on the health sector.  \n \n                                                 \n2  A FGP is a team of doctors and nurses who work as a private entity under contract with the local government and \nprovide holistic family health services.  \n ", "  3\n9.  International assistance in the health sector has accounted for at least one third of the \ntotal health expenditures for 1992\u20131997. In 2001 total health expenditures amounted to $39 \nmillion equivalent or $6.30 equivalent per capita financed by users (31%), the Government \n(26%),  development  banks  (7%),  and  humanitarian  and  United  Nations  agencies  (36%). \nAppendix  2  summarizes  external  assistance  to  the  health  sector.  Timely  support  from \ndevelopment agencies is  important to ensure that the exit of humanitarian agencies will not \ncreate a vacuum and that health sector development and reforms stay on track.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n10.  Unreliable Health Data and  a Double Burden of  Diseases. Life  expectancy and \nmortality trends in Tajikistan have improved steadily according to official figures. However, other \ninformation suggests a more precarious health situation. Using other  information sources, \nmortality rates, particularly the infant mortality rate (IMR), appear to have stagnated over the \ndecade. The officially reported IMR, a key MDG, was 36.7 per 1,000 live births for 2000, but the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) estimated it as 82.4. Health data is unreliable due to \nsubstantial underreporting attributable to the breakdown of the data collection system during the \nwar and the introduction of registration fees that discourage poor families from recording births \nand deaths. A 1998 United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) survey revealed that over 80% of \nbirths and infant deaths were not registered. Continued use of the Soviet definition of live births3 \nis another reason for underreporting, despite the official adoption of the WHO definition. In \naddition, a death is recorded where it occurs, for example, in urban hospitals, instead of the \nplace of residence. This practice distorts data and results in incomplete statistical data for rural \nareas.    \n \n11.  Cardiovascular diseases (33%) are the biggest cause of death in Tajikistan, followed by \nrespiratory diseases (17%), accidents (10%), and infectious and parasitic diseases (9%). Over \nthe decade, infectious and respiratory diseases and those related to poverty are reemerging \nand increasing. They include malnutrition, tuberculosis, typhoid,  and diarrhea. Malnutrition is \nprevalent in many parts of the country. For example, as many as 39% of children in Khatlon, \none of the regions affected by the civil war, suffer from chronic malnutrition. Another 7% suffer \nfrom acute malnutrition. Major causes of infant mortality are respiratory, diarrheal diseases, and \nperinatal conditions. Causes of maternal mortality are hemorrhages, eclampsia, and infection, \nmost of which are preventable. Anemia, from which 60% of women of reproductive age suffer, is \na strong factor  contributing to  maternal complications.  Tajikistan thus suffers from a double \nburden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases.  \n \n12.  Limited and Reduced Access to, Quality of, and Use of PHC. PHC in Tajikistan is \nprovided by feldshers (community nurses), midwives, and doctors at medical houses, polyclinics, \nrural health centers, and rural hospitals. Patients are referred to central district hospitals. The \nPHC network is extensive, but is not functioning  effectively. Despite  the high percentage of \nanemia among reproductive women, officially recorded maternal complications are less than \n10% of the total recorded pregnancies. This is substantially less than in other CARs, suggesting \nthat the antenatal care system in Tajikistan  fails to identify and respond to needy  people. \nAnother issue requiring attention is the increasing proportion of home deliveries and births \nwithout skilled health personnel in attendance. According to UNICEF, these births were less \nthan 10% in 1990, but  increased to 45% in 2000. The rising proportion of home deliveries \n                                                 \n3  The Soviet definition of live births does not include premature and low-birth weight babies who do not survive \nduring the first week. This lowers the infant mortality rate estimate.   \n ", "4  \nsuggests the breakdown of the local health care system and the financial inability of families to \npay for medical care.       \n \n13.  PHC facilities are in poor  condition, with equipment, pharmaceuticals,  and reference \nmaterial largely absent if not  supplied through humanitarian aid. Although most of the PHC \nbudget is allocated to salaries, salaries are well below the level necessary for survival and \ndemoralize health staff. Unofficial fees are now widely charged.  Fixed salaries provide no \nfinancial incentive for health staff to serve those unable to pay. The knowledge and skills of \nhealth staff at all levels of the heath system are often outdated and limited. Many remote health \ncenters are seriously understaffed. These factors limit access to PHC. A lack of awareness of \nPHC among the population also reduces the demand for it. Many people still believe that the \nhospital-based health care system developed before independence remains the best and that \nthe former health system must be rebuilt.   \n \n14.  The cost of health services, including pharmaceuticals and out-of-pocket costs, is a key \naccess issue, particularly for the poor even at the PHC level. Even where user fees have been \nestablished, the official cost of  health services can be unaffordable. Fear of unpredictable \ndemands  for  additional  unofficial  fees  also  deter  the  poor  from  using  government  health \nservices. ADB\u2019s poverty assessment indicates that the poor seek health care less than richer \ngroups do because of the difficulty of paying for it and resort to self-medication. To set up a fully \nfunctional and pro-poor PHC system, a comprehensive approach  covering the following is \nrequired: material and facility support,  staff training, removal of barriers to access to health \nservices among the poor, and changing perceptions of health services among the population. \nEffective  community  participation  will  ensure  that  the  community  is  aware  of  services, \nunderstands the problems of delivery, and thereby contributes to strengthening the quality and \nresponsiveness of the services. Better services will  in turn increase  use, permit regularizing \ninformal out-of-pocket payments, and contribute to the full integration of the health sector in the \ncommunity.  \n \n15.  The health reform concept adopted in 2000 proposes to base PHC on the FGP system. \nDevelopment agencies, including ADB, the World Bank, and ZdravPlus program supported by \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  have  been  retraining \nspecialists. So far 240 family doctors and 188 family nurses have been trained. However, no \nlegal framework has been set up for the FGP system, and hence trained staff continue to see \npatients who fall within their original clinical specialty  in unchanged working conditions. For \nfamily doctors and nurses to effectively serve the population, particularly the poor, they need a \nnew  working  environment  that  involves  a  change  in  provider  payment,  introduction  of \nperformance-based contracts, and registration of the population with FGPs.     \n \n16.  Limited Institutional Capacity of the  Health Sector. MOH has limited institutional \ncapacity to effectively plan, manage, finance, and monitor the public health sector. The health \nmanagement information system (HMIS) should provide a basis for planning and monitoring. \nBut the current HMIS is inadequate. Health care is inadequately funded and resources are not \nwell managed, resulting in failure to base resource allocation on needs and evidence. Health \nbudget allocations do not reflect MOH\u2019s policy on PHC, but continue to be based on traditional \nnorms, such as hospital beds and staff numbers, so that the majority of the budget goes to \nhospitals. PHC\u2019s share of the total health budget is extremely small, and even decreased from \n7.3% in 2000 to 6.0% in 2002.4   \n \n                                                 \n4 The Health expenditure review is in Supplementary Appendix A. ", "  5\n17.  The human resource policy and planning capacity  of the health sector are not well \ndeveloped. Analysis suggests lack of consistency in available staffing data; overstaffing  at \nnational and provincial levels and understaffing at district and health centers; significant gaps in \nkey  staff  categories;  inappropriate  deployment  of  specialty  staff;  poorly  defined  roles  and \nfunctions of staff; and weak human resource management. The cost-effective use of human \nresources and efficient use of the budget are key in a resource-constrained context such as in \nTajikistan. Capacity building is required at all levels of the health sector.   \n  \n18.   Lessons Learned.  The Government and its development partners have learned many \nlessons in recent years. ADB fully considered the experience of World Bank pilot activities and \nthe ADB SSRP in project design.5 The most important lesson is that capacity building and \nimplementation of expanded capacity is a long-term process that involves training and on-the-\njob support. Staff will perform to a high standard when appropriate salary and performance-\nrelated incentives are provided and when effective management and operating resources are \npresent.  Effective  human  resource  management  at  the  district  and  facility  levels requires \nsufficient delegation of authority and responsibility. Appropriate training  is also required  with \nongoing supervision.  Functional analysis  is needed  to identify staffing needs and  support \nplanning and management for an  effective workforce. \n \n19.  The SSRP demonstrates that experienced project staff familiar with ADB guidelines and \ncommitted government officials are key to smooth project implementation. To compensate for \nthe lack of experience of line ministries in administering ADB projects and to ensure cost-\neffectiveness, the Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP) and  the parallel  Education Sector \nReform Project (ESRP) will share the same project administration structure based on the SSRP \nimplementation framework that has proved successful. The deputy prime minister will continue \nas  project  director,  capacity  building  will  be  supported,  and  experienced  domestic  and \ninternational consultants will be recruited. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives  \n \n20.  The HSRP will improve people\u2019s health, especially of women, children, and the poor in \nTajikistan, and lay a foundation for  longer-term development. The HSRP will help Tajikistan \nachieve the MDG by reducing by 30% IMR, under-5 mortality rate, and maternal mortality rate \n(MMR) in pilot districts. Specifically, the HSRP aims to   \n \n(i)  improve the management capacity of the health sector and system efficiency through \ninstitutional strengthening and reforms; \n \n(ii)  increase equitable access to and use of basic health services by the poor, women, \nand children; and \n \n(iii)  support informed policy dialogue to pursue health sector reform.   \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Experience in the ADB-funded Mongolia Health Sector Development Program, that achieved considerable success \nin introducing FGPs has also been considered. \n ", "6  \n B.  Components and Outputs \n \n21.  The HSRP has three components: (i) institutional development for the health sector, (ii) \ndrug supply and quality control, and (iii) efficient and sustainable delivery of a pro-poor health \nservice package. The project framework is in Appendix 3. The project conceptual framework \n(Appendix 4), illustrates that all subcomponents are interlinked to support the efficient delivery of \nthe pro-poor health service package.   \n \n22.  The HSRP will have national and pilot district components. Health service improvement \nwill be implemented in five rural districts (Roshkala in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region \n[GBAR],  Ayni  and  Gornaya  Matcha  in  Sughd  region,  Garm  in  Region  of  Republican \nSubordination [RRS], and Kulyab in Khatlon region) selected for their  level and severity  of \npoverty and the level of infant and maternal mortality (Map, page viii). Synergistic effects of \nparallel implementation of  the HSRP and  the ESRP in the same districts will be particularly \nbeneficial to community mobilization and child health and early education. The profile of the \nproject districts is in Appendix 5.  The HSRP will invest in areas that will have the greatest \nimpact on the poor, women, and children.    \n \n1.  Institutional Development \n \n23.  In the emergency and postconflict situations, health sector staff have so far received \nlimited capacity-building support. The HSRP will build the capacity to plan, manage, and monitor \nat the national, region, and district levels. The HSRP will strengthen MOH and training institutes, \nsuch as the medical university, to enable them to train staff so that the health sector can \neffectively plan, manage, and monitor services delivery, financing, and staffing. Gender balance \nwill be ensured in training. Enhanced efficiency is one of the benefits of capacity building. The \nHSRP will reform the health services delivery system to improve system efficiency. The initial \nfocus in reform is to develop the FGP-based PHC system. Appendix 6 describes a plan  for \nintroducing FGPs in Tajikistan. The HSRP will help MOH and the medical university to analyze \nworkforce situations and prepare a workforce development plan. An effective HMIS  will be \ndeveloped to support planning and monitoring.  \n \na.  Capacity Building for Planning and Management \n \n24.  The HSRP will finance overseas training of key staff of MOH and  the medical university. \nStaff of MOH, regions, and pilot districts will receive in-country training in health sector planning \nand management.  The HSRP will  enhance the ability of  MOH, Ministry of Labor and Social \nProtection, and the medical university to analyze workforce situations and to develop a human \nresource policy and a workforce plan. The medical university must better understand health staff \nneeds and required qualifications  under the reformed health system.  MOH and the medical \nuniversity will need to better coordinate student intake, distribution of graduates, staff numbers, \nprofiles and distribution, job descriptions, and training needs. The plan will provide a basis for \nrationalizing staff for pilot districts. However,  lack of reliable data on  the existing workforce \nseriously impairs effective human resource planning. Therefore, HMIS development and district \nsurveys on staffing will proceed. The licensing system for medical staff will be improved and the \naccreditation system will be developed and implemented. The HSRP will strengthen continuing \neducation  programs  that  have  been  provided  by  humanitarian  agencies  but  are  not \nstandardized and coordinated. The HSRP will develop a facility rationalization plan based on the \nhealth reform concept. The HSRP will strengthen the capacity of MOH and pilot districts to plan \nand  supervise  a  public  information  campaign  in  close  cooperation  with  UNICEF.  Public ", "  7\ncampaigns will be a strong tool in changing people\u2019s perception and behavior toward health and \nhealth services.  \n \n25.  Using the framework developed under the associated TA (paras. 55-56), the HSRP will \nimplement HMIS and train staff nationwide to collect, analyze, and use data. The HSRP will \ncomputerize HMIS at  MOH and at strategic planning levels. An intersectoral and aid agency \nforum will be set up to supervise HMIS and help plan, implement, and monitor the reform. HMIS \nreports will be published annually in Russian and  in English. Surveys in the five HSRP pilot \ndistricts will supplement and strengthen the reliability of HMIS data at the national level.  \n \nb.  Developing a Family Group Practice Framework  \n \n26.  The HSRP will help MOH establish legislative, financial, and operational frameworks for \nthe FGP system. This includes setting up  the accreditation scheme of FGPs, developing a \nframework  and  guidelines  for  FGP  mapping  and  population  registration,  and  designing \nperformance-based contracts and capitation payment mechanisms for proper incentives. A \nmonitoring system will be prepared to measure the impacts.  The HSRP, together with other \nsources, will train the staff of MOH, Ministry of Finance (MOF), regions, and pilot districts in the \nFGP system and help them finalize its framework. The FGP framework will be tested in pilot \ndistricts.  \n   \n2.  Drug Supply and Quality Control  \n \n27.  Eleven NGOs have been providing emergency drugs effectively through a supply system \nset up, coordinated, and maintained by the Pharmaciens Sans Fronti\u00e8res (PSF).6 The public \nsupply system collapsed after independence and has not been able to distribute any drugs for \nthe last 6 years. The Government intends to incorporate the humanitarian system in the national \nsystem,  but  lacks  capacity  for  it.  Another  issue  is  uncontrolled  poor-quality  drugs.  The \nGovernment is unable to control the quality of drugs that come into the country from a wide \nrange of sources. Fake, counterfeit, and low-quality drugs have contributed to the prescription of \nmultiple drugs. The result is increased drug expense, developing drug resistance, and distrust of \nthe health sector among the population.       \n \na.  Establishing of an Efficient Drug Procurement Center \n \n28.  The  subcomponent  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  national  procurement  and \ndistribution system. A new drug procurement center will be established with the assistance of \nPSF. The HSRP will directly contract PSF to exploit its expertise in building public capacity and \ntransferring responsibility for running the humanitarian supply system. Public capacity regarding \ndrug supply management will be strengthened in (i) the procurement process: drug selection, \ntender management; (ii) distribution and management: need assessment, stock management, \ndistribution;  (iii)  storage:  warehouse  management,  working  protocols;  (iv)  software  for \nimplementing stock management; (v) training and retraining of health workers in pilot districts in \nstock management; and (vii) rational planning for  warehousing, equipment distribution, and \nstaffing.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  A summary of the pharmaceutical sector review is in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n ", "8  \nb.  Developing a Drug Quality Control Mechanism  \n \n29.  Medicines must meet international quality requirements. The HSRP will strengthen the \ndrug quality control center, which is part of MOH, by (i) assessing the current capacity of the \ncenter and establishing a time-bound improvement plan; (ii) providing a regulatory framework \nand guidelines for drug quality control; (iii) providing a laboratory for drug quality monitoring with \nequipment, reagents, and reference literature; and  (iv) guaranteeing sustainability through  a \ncost recovery mechanism for quality control services and capacity building for human resources. \nThe drug quality control center will receive resources to improve the existing equipment and \nreagents  for  drug  analysis.  An  international  consultant  will  conduct  training  on  up-to-date \nmethods of drug quality analysis. Waste and reagent management will be addressed.  \n \n3.  Efficient and Sustainable Delivery of a Pro-Poor Health Service Package  \n \n30.  This component will focus on enhancing the quality and increasing access to, and use of \nbasic health services especially among the poor, women, and children in the five HSRP districts. \nThe HSRP will finance and deliver the pro-poor service package reflecting MOH\u2019s reform plan. \nThe HSRP will train staff, provide equipment, and rehabilitate health facilities for the package to \nbe effectively used. Simultaneously, the HSRP will reform the service delivery and financing \nmechanisms. Although family doctors and nurses have been trained, the FGP system where \nthey can work has not yet been set up. The HSRP will introduce, finance, and test the FGP- \nbased PHC system as developed at the national level. FGP\u2019s contractual arrangements and \ncapitation rates will entail  incentives for pro-poor and  efficient service delivery.  The quality \ncontrol of FGP services and ongoing performance and impact  assessment of the  reformed \nsystem will be ensured. The plan to rationalize excess hospital beds will be implemented in \nHSRP districts. Rationalization will bring savings that will be reallocated to the FGP system and \nPHC to increase the financial sustainability of the reformed system. The pro-poor package and \nthe reformed system nationwide will be extended once the pilot activities prove successful. \n \n31.  For the first 2 years, the HSRP will focus on capacity building and development of the \nsystem framework at the national, regional, and pilot district levels. Capacity building  before \nimplementing reforms is important. Health departments will be created in HSRP districts to take \nfull-time responsibility for health sector planning, management, and reforms. Currently the chief \ndoctor of the district hospital manages district health programs under the supervision of the \nregional health department.  District health  departments will have the  following functions in \naddition  to  implementing  and  administering  regular  district  health  programs:  (i)  monitor \nworkforce distribution,  FGP system implementation, capitation payments, performance-based \ncontracts, facility functions, caseloads in individual facilities, and  use of pharmaceuticals; (ii) \noversee of rehabilitation and distribution of equipment; (iii) coordinate and manage public \ninformation campaigns; and (iv) act as a conduit for community input into PHC management. \n \n32.  Feasibility  studies  of  the  FGP  system  and  pro-poor  package  delivery  will  ensure \neffectiveness and sustainability. A critical mass of FGPs must be created in the HSRP pilot \ndistricts.7 Actual delivery of the pro-poor health package though the FGP system will start in the \nthird year. The information campaigns will coincide with FGP system introduction. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  Currently only seven family doctors are working in the five pilot districts.  ", "  9\na.  Providing of a Pro-Poor Health Service Package  \n \n33.  The HSRP will provide a standard pro-poor health package, including basic drugs and \ncontraceptives, to FGPs and rural health centers in the pilot districts. The package will be free \nfor patients. The package is part of the guaranteed health package proposed by MOH, but is \nmore focused for service cost-effectiveness. The package covers basic neonatal care, breast-\nfeeding, growth monitoring, nutrition, integrated management of child illness, acute respiratory \ndiseases, diarrhea, typhoid, school health, worms, contraceptives, safe motherhood (antenatal, \ndelivery, and postnatal care), sexually transmitted infections, brucellosis, and hypertension.8 A \nlife-cycle approach will be considered in targeting services. Immunization and  tuberculosis \ncontrol are important contents of the package,  and are financed  in parallel  by UNICEF and \nUSAID. The HSRP will complement immunization and tuberculosis control by providing relevant \nequipment and training and raising awareness through public information campaigns.   \n \n34.  Staff of FGPs, rural health centers, and district hospitals will be trained to deliver the \nservices in the standard pro-poor package. Roles of health staff will be defined in line with pro-\npoor  interventions  and  delivery  strategies.  Roles  of  community  nurses  in  providing \ncommunication and information services for the population will be emphasized to increase the \ndemand for health services and improve family health practices. An international consultant will \nset  up  quality  control  measures  for  FGP  services  covering  classroom  training,  on-the-job \ntraining, and impact monitoring. The district health department will monitor training impacts.  \nThe HSRP will also train pharmacists in five HSRP districts on Tajikistan\u2019s essential drug list, \ntreatment guidelines, clinical pharmacy and evidence-based medicine, stock management, and \nprocurement. The HSRP will create a critical mass of FGPs in HSRP pilot districts by retraining \nspecialists and mid-level personnel in family medicine through 6-month courses.  \n \n35.  The HSRP will procure basic equipment for FGPs, rural health centers, and central \ndistrict hospitals to provide quality services related to the pro-poor package. As the equipment \nwill be basic, recurrent costs will be manageable. The HSRP will rehabilitate and rebuild PHC \nfacilities according to district rationalization plans. The health facility and FGP mapping to be \nconducted in the first year will be a basis for the rationalization plan in each HSRP district. In \ntotal, about 40 PHC facilities will be rehabilitated or rebuilt. If  it is necessary to build new \nfacilities, district administrations will screen proposals for any involuntary resettlement effects \nand prepare land acquisition and resettlement plans, in line with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement. An international consultant will assist. Civil works will be designed according to \nservices provided at facilities, actual caseloads, energy efficiency, provision of appropriate \ntechnical  services  such  as  telephones,  heating,  water,  and  sanitation and environmental \nrequirements. A medical waste management plan and wastewater management measures will \nbe developed and implemented at the rehabilitated and rebuilt facilities.   \n \nb.  Reforming Service Delivery and Financing  \n \n36.  The HSRP will finance and test the capitation payment mechanism for paying the FGPs. \nMOH has proposed capitation payment in the broader health care financing reforms and will \nformulate  the  capitation  method  and  the  contractual  arrangements  for  FGPs,  assisted  by \ninternational consultants. Performance-based contracts will be made between FGPs and the \ndistrict health departments established under the HSRP. The arrangements will be adjusted and \nintroduced at the district level after intensive meetings among international consultants, district \n                                                 \n8  The content of the package with delivery strategies is explained in Supplementary Appendix C. The list of drugs \nand equipment to implement the package are explained in Supplementary Appendix D. \n ", "10  \nand region administrations, and MOH. Capitation rates will be higher for infants, women  of \nreproductive age, and the aged, while the contract will stipulate in detail services for the poor, \nwomen, and children. The monitoring system will  assess FGP\u2019s performance and impacts, \nincluding access to basic health services by the poor, women, and children.     \n \n37.  The HSRP will rationalize the health system and staffing distribution in pilot districts to \nreflect the national plans and reallocate savings to finance the FGP system, PHC, and the pro-\npoor health package. Under the current input-based budget allocation scheme, reduced hospital \nbeds and staff imply lower budget allocations and act as a disincentive to rationalization. MOF \nclaims the savings from rationalization. An agreement will be made with MOF so that district \nhealth departments will be entitled to keep those savings and not suffer any corresponding \nreduction in their budgets from rationalization. District health departments will produce proposals \ndemonstrating the savings to be achieved and presenting a business plan for using the saved \nresources. The HSRP will help district health departments design the business plan.   \n \n38.  The HSRP will strengthen  the capacity of the region and district administrations  to \nmanage the reformed system, rationalize hospitals, plan the budget, and monitor all. District \nhealth department staff in each pilot  district will be trained intensively in management, health \ncare financing, health sector reform, and HMIS. The HMIS based on the framework developed \nunder the associated TA will be set up and implemented in the pilot districts. HMIS data will be \ncollected routinely and surveys will be conducted for monitoring reforms. The survey data will \ncomplement and verify the quality of HMIS data at the national level. The initial in-depth survey \nwill be designed and conducted under the associated TA. Staff at all levels of the health system \nin the pilot districts will be trained to collect, analyze, and use data. \n \n39.  The HSRP will help district administrations conduct public information campaigns and \nmobilize community participation to raise awareness and understanding of health reforms, the \nFGP-based PHC system, and major health problems. Campaigns will be conducted with the full \nparticipation of local governments,  communities, and local NGOs. MOH will supervise and \ncoordinate campaigns on major health problems (diarrhea, tuberculosis, typhoid), reproductive \nhealth, sexually  transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS9 control, health promotion based on  the \nlife-cycle approach, health care reform, and the introduction of the free pro-poor health package.  \nInformation on the purposes, content, and benefits of the reformed system are critical messages \nof the campaigns. The campaigns will be designed to reach the poor and women as their lack of \ninformation on health services is one of the barriers that keep them from accessing services. \nLocal government staff will be trained to organize campaigns and mobilize communities.   \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n40.  Tajikistan in the postconflict period faces complex development challenges: volatile and \nunstable security, fluid coalition Government, uncertain political commitment, limited institutional \ncapacity,  governance  concerns,  and  years  in  a  development  vacuum.  Involvement  of \nhumanitarian and grant-based agencies has contributed to creating dependency expectations \nand have established duplicate systems that parallel national and local structures. Development \nagencies have not been active for security  and governance reasons. Changes in services \ndelivery, management, and financing of the health sector are required, but difficult in a context \nwhere changes take place slowly. The HSRP will focus on capacity building across the health \nsector and reforms at the PHC level. The HSRP will support the national drug supply system in \n                                                 \n9  HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", " 11\ncollaboration with humanitarian NGOs that have been implementing the efficient drug supply \nsystem to prevent its collapse after their withdrawal.     \n \n41.  Tajikistan is also a transition economy where the move from rigid central planning to a \nmore open market environment has created many new challenges to the health system. To \ncope with these challenges, the HSRP supports policy and institutional reforms including  (i) \nreorienting health service delivery from hospital-based and cure-biased to PHC, (ii)  shifting \nprovider  payment  mechanisms  from  fixed  salary  to  capitation  payment  with  pro-poor  and \nefficiency incentives, (iii) refocusing budget preparation from norm-based to per capita allocation, \nand (iv) accelerating system rationalization. \n        \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n42.  The total cost of the HSRP is estimated at $9.375 million equivalent, of which $5.340 \nmillion, or 57%, is the foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost is estimated at $4.035 \nmillion equivalent or 43% of the total cost. The costs are summarized in Table 2, with details in \nAppendix 7.  \n \nTable 2: Cost Estimates, by Component  \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nCost by Component  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n \nA.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $7.5 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to finance 80% of the total project cost. The ADB loan will be repayable over 32 years \nwith a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  The Borrower will be Tajikistan. ADB will fund 100% of \nthe foreign exchange cost, totaling 57% of the estimated project cost, and 54% of the local \ncurrency  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $1.875  million  equivalent  as \ncounterpart financing,  which accounts for 20% of the total cost. This includes financing civil \nworks; taxes and duties; training, workshops, surveys, studies; and other recurrent costs. The \nfinancial plan is in Table 3. \n \n44.  In view of the difficult debt situation, the Government has requested that costs for \nconsultants,  project  management,  and  training  be  reduced  or  grants  attracted  for  these \n ", "12  \nactivities, noting pledges made at the recent consultative group meeting (CG).10 ADB has been \nactively seeking grants to substitute for some of the loan proceeds. The HSRP has been broken \ndown  into  self-contained  packages  based  on  the  conceptual  framework  and  proposed  to \nsources for cofinancing (Appendix 8). If grant funds are firmly committed, corresponding savings \nunder the loan may be reallocated or cancelled. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n \nForeign  Local  Total \n \n  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  Share (%) \nAsian Development Bank  5.340  2.160  7.500  80  \nGovernment  0.000  1.875  1.875    20 \n   Total  5.340  4.035  9.375  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management and Implementation Period \n \n45.  The HSRP will be implemented in parallel with the proposed  ESRP. The President\u2019s \nOffice will be the Executing Agency, with the deputy prime minister as project coordinator for \nboth  HSRP  and  ESRP.  A  national  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  give overall \nguidance and coordinate both projects. The committee will be chaired by the project coordinator \nand composed of senior officials from MOH, Ministry of Education, MOF, and regions, and pilot \ndistricts. Both projects will work in the same pilot districts. The national steering committee will \nmeet quarterly. It will approve the annual HSRP budget and activity plan and review and advise \non implementation progress. Task teams will be established at MOH for key areas, e.g., health \ncare financing (use of the existing one), human resource development, FGP system, and HMIS. \n \n46.  A project implementation unit (PIU) will be set up in MOH with a project manager and \ntwo other full-time staff. In full consultation with MOH, the PIU will make a detailed annual plan, \ndevelop the time frame, decide on procurement of consultants, select fellowships, and monitor \npilot district activities. A project administration unit (PAU) will be set up in Dushanbe, based on \nthe  existing  SSRP  structure,  under  PIU.  The  PAU  will  serve  as  a  secretariat  to  provide \nadministrative support for procurement, consultant recruitment, and disbursement; and monitor \nand  report  on  progress  against  indicators.  The  PAU  head  will  be  assisted  by  staff  for \nadministration, accounting, monitoring, procurement/civil works, and interpretation.  \n \n47.  Each pilot district will have a district supervisory group, shared by the ESRP, comprising \nrepresentatives of the  district governor\u2019s office, district departments of health and education, \nvillage leaders, schools, feldshers, FGPs, health centers, and hospitals. The group will guide \nand coordinate district activities. Each pilot district will have a district PIU for  the  HSRP, \ncomprising  a  district  project  coordinator,  a  reform  officer,  and  an  administrator.  Project \nmanagement and monitoring  capacities at PAU, PIU, and district PIU will be strengthened \nthrough staff training.  The implementation arrangements are  described in Appendix 9.  The \n                                                 \n10 At the CG meeting in May 2003, aid agencies pledged $900 million, including $700 million grants for over a 3-year \nperiod. Aid agencies and the Government noted that it would be preferable to finance social sectors by grants to \nthe extent possible. ", " 13\nHSRP  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  2004  to  2008.  Appendix  10  gives  the \nimplementation schedule. \n \n48.  Mobilizing parallel grant funds in response to the Government's request will result in a \nvariety of financing sources and will impose an additional degree of difficulty in implementing \nand coordinating the HSRP. To complement the roles of the PAU and the PIU, an effective aid \ncoordination mechanism will be set up. \n \n2.  Procurement \n \n49.  Goods, related services, and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2018s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Equipment will be procured by international competitive bidding \n(ICB) for contracts in excess of $500,000, international shopping for contracts in excess of \n$100,000, and direct purchase for contracts valued at less than $100,000. Civil works valued in \nexcess of $1 million will be awarded through ICB and civil works contracts valued at or less than \n$1 million will be awarded under local competitive bidding (LCB), in accordance with procedures \nacceptable to ADB. The indicative contract packages are in Appendix 11.  In accordance with \nADB procedures, eligible foreign contractors may participate in the bid for contracts through \nLCB. ADB\u2019s domestic preference scheme may be applied when evaluating bids under ICB. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n \n50.  A total of 164 person-months of consulting services (48 person-months international and \n106  domestic)  will  be  required  for  the  HSRP  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The \nconsultants will be recruited individually (for project management and for specific technical \nexpertise) or through a firm. Quality and cost-based selection will be applied to a firm. Detailed \ncosting  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E. The outline of terms of reference for  consulting \nservices are in Appendix 12. The indicative training program is in Supplementary Appendix F.   \n \n4.  Direct Contracting of Pharmaciens sans Fronti\u00e8res (PSF) \n \n51.  PSF  will  be  directly  selected11 to  support  the  establishment  of  an  efficient  drug \nprocurement center by transferring its experience and knowledge to the Government. PSF has \nbeen  operating  the  humanitarian  drug  supply  system  in  Tajikistan  since  1994  and  has \ncoordinated all major NGOs\u2019 drug distribution. A lump sum contract will be implemented with \nquarterly progress payments made contingent on satisfactory contractor performance. The \ncontract will specify objectively measurable service delivery goals, a minimal acceptable level of \nimprovement, and penalties that will be incurred if these levels are not met.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n52.  The PAU will establish an imprest account in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB to \nexpedite disbursement of the loan proceeds, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook dated January 2001 and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. \nThe Government may make withdrawals from the imprest account for PAU/PIU staff costs; \ntraining, seminars, and studies; locally available material; domestic consultants; rationalization \nincentives; and civil works contracts under  LCB. The initial  amount to be deposited into the \nimprest account will not exceed $250,000. Procedures  from ADB\u2019s statement of  expenditure \n                                                 \n11  Terms of reference for the PSF are included in Appendix 12 and a draft contract is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n ", "14  \n(SOE) will be followed to liquidate the imprest account and reimburse individual SOE payments \nthat do not exceed $50,000 \n \n6.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit \n \n53.  The PIU together with the PAU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation \nin line with ADB\u2019s project performance report and submit them to ADB within 30 days after the \nend of the applicable period. Within 3 months after physical completion, PIU will submit a project \ncompletion report to the ADB. The PAU will maintain separate records and accounts for all \nexpenditures financed from the proceeds of the loan, in accordance with sound accounting \nprinciples.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  project  accounts,  including  financial \nstatements. SOEs, and imprest account records annually. The audit report will be submitted to \nADB in English not later than 6 months after the fiscal year to which it relates. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System \n \n54.  The  President\u2019s  Office,  MOH,  PIU,  and  PAU  will  establish  a  project  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation system (PPMES), acceptable to ADB. PPMES aims to (i) review \nHSRP technical performance; (ii) evaluate the delivery of planned activities; (iii) measure HSRP \nimpacts; (iv) measure social and economic benefits with a focus on the poor, women, and \nchildren; and (v) monitor achievement of MDGs. PPMES indicators will be used in preparing \nreports on project implementation and the reform process covering fiscal impacts, improved use \nof resources, change in access to services, improved services quality, cost savings from \nrationalization, and client satisfaction. Routine HMIS and special surveys financed by the HSRP \nwill  supply  PPMES  with  information.  Where  feasible,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by \nsocioeconomic levels and sex. The HSRP will assist the President\u2019s Office, PIU, and PAU to \nfinalize indicators and the monitoring system during HSRP inception. A close link among MDG, \nPPMES, and HMIS will be ensured. Appendix 13 shows an indicative list of PPMES indicators. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n55.  The technical assistance (TA) will support developing management information systems \nfor informed policy dialogue, decision making, and monitoring. The TA will serve as a central \npolicy  tool  to  improve  MOH\u2019s  planning,  budgeting,  and  reform  for  the  health  sector.  The \nobjectives are to (i) develop the HMIS framework and action plans at MOH, region, and district \nlevels; (ii)  lay the  basis for  planning, monitoring, and measuring system performance and \nreforms;  and  (iii)  create  a  mechanism  for  monitoring  and  policy  dialogue  between  the \nGovernment and aid agencies. The TA will conduct an in-depth survey in pilot districts to obtain \nan accurate and disaggregated baseline database for the health sector. The TA will finance \nconsultants  (7  person-months  international,  14  person-months  domestic)  with  expertise  in \nsurveys, poverty, and HMIS. The TA will be implemented  over  12  months.  More detailed \ninformation on the TA is in Appendix 14. Consultants will be engaged individually or through a \nfirm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n56.  The TA will be financed on  a grant basis  by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA is estimated to cost $355,000 equivalent, comprising $169,000 in \nforeign exchange and $186,000 equivalent in local  currency. ADB will provide $300,000 to \nfinance the entire foreign currency expenditures and $131,000  equivalent of local currency \nexpenditures. The Government will provide the remaining $55,000 equivalent in kind. ", " 15\n57.  A second TA will develop a drug procurement and distribution strategy. The strategy will \ncover all aspects of the procurement and distribution process, namely: selecting drugs, ensuring \nquality, managing the tender process, distributing drugs, managing stocks, and monitoring drug \nuse and prices. The objectives are to (i) support policy dialogue and develop a clear strategy \nand framework for establishing a drug procurement and distribution system, supported by action \nplans at MOH, region, and district levels; (ii) prepare a rational plan for warehousing, equipment \ndistribution, and staffing; and (iii)  supply operational guidelines on  the above procurement \nprocess.  Support  for  developing  strategies  to  strengthen  public  drug  procurement  and \ndistribution capacity is urgently needed to ensure the continuation of an adequate and reliable \nsupply of quality drugs when assistance from humanitarian agencies ends. The private sector \ncurrently does not have the capacity and lacks an appropriate legal framework to assume these \nresponsibilities immediately. The TA will fill the vacuum created by private sector absence and a \nlack of public sector capacity, while proposing long-term development strategies to increase \nprivate  sector  involvement,  including  public-private  partnerships,  in  drug  procurement  and \ndistribution. The TA will finance consultants (4 person-months international, 18 person-months \ndomestic) with expertise in drug procurement. The TA will be implemented over 6 months. More \ndetailed information is in Appendix 15. PSF will be directly engaged (para. 50).  \n \n58.   The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA is estimated to cost $180,000 equivalent, comprising $114,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $66,000  equivalent  in  local currency.  ADB  will  provide $150,000 to \nfinance the entire foreign currency expenditures and $36,000  equivalent of local currency \nexpenditures. The Government will provide the remaining $30,000 equivalent in kind.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits \n \n59.  The HSRP addresses both immediate needs and long-term sustainability. It responds to \nthe most urgent health needs of the poor and vulnerable, while making a positive impact on the \ncurrent weak health care system and increasing access to and use of basic health services. The \nHSRP will improve people\u2019s health\u2014especially that of the poor, women, and children\u2014in five of \nthe poorest districts, covering approximately 5.5% of Tajikistan\u2019s population of 6.3 million. The \ntargeted districts have high infant and maternal mortality rates. The HSRP will focus on the most \naccessible health care levels and will pilot-test the FGP-based PHC system. The PHC is an \ninternationally proven cost-effective method to respond to the needs of the poor, women, and \nchildren.  The FGP system benefits the poor and vulnerable better than any other service \ndelivery modalities.  Considering the results of the pilot testing, the system will be expanded \nnationwide, disseminating the benefits gained through the HSRP. \n \n60.  To strengthen equity, efficiency, and sustainability of the health sector, the HSRP will \nbuild MOH\u2019s capacity to effectively plan and manage the health sector and to pursue reforms. In \nparticular, the HSRP will support reforms in health service delivery and financing. In reforming \nthe systems, the HSRP will especially challenge the situation where patients currently finance \nabout 80% of the total health expenditure, while the Government contributes about 5%, thus \nputting the financial burden on the poor. \n \nB.  Project Risks \n \n61.  The successful   implementation of the reform-oriented HSRP depends largely on the \ncapacity of  the local governments and MOH. The HSRP will strengthen MOH\u2019s capacity  to \n ", "16  \nanalyze situations and develop reform strategies and action plans. HMIS will be set up to plan, \nmonitor, and evaluate the reform. \n \n62.  Risks in project management relate to the limited capacity of line ministries and their \nstaff. The presence of experienced staff and committed government officials is key to smooth \nproject implementation. This risk will be managed by continuously involving a deputy prime \nminister in the President\u2019s Office, using an implementation structure based on the ADB SSRP \nframework,  providing  capacity-building  support,  and  engaging  experienced  domestic  and \ninternational consultants. Involvement of the President's Office and shared implementation \narrangements with  the ESRP, based on an  experienced PAU,  offset to some degree the \ncomplicated  implementation  arrangements  and  risks,  aggravated  by  the  Government's \nreluctance to borrow for training, consulting services, and project management. These activities \nare at the minimum level feasible and any further attempt to prune them may pose a serious risk \nto project implementability.  \n \n63.  The changes being introduced in health services delivery require changes in attitudes of \nstaff and clients and a change in management style. The HSRP will invest in public information \ncampaigns  to  elicit  public  perceptions  on  responsive  health  systems and will strengthen \nmanagement. \n \n64.  Financial sustainability of the HSRP depends on the financial sustainability of the health \nsector in Tajikistan itself. Efficient and sustainable delivery of a pro-poor service package, a \nmajor HSRP component, will involve a profound change in the current health budget allocation \nmechanism  in  Tajikistan  and  require  an  increase  in  the  allocation  to  PHC.  Financial \nsustainability means that the reforms introduced by the  HSRP should continue beyond the 5 \nyears life span of the HSRP, and this continuity must rely on Government resources. In this \nsense, the HSRP aims to improve the government\u2019s capacity to develop and maintain reforms in \nits health financing system and to reform health service delivery. \n \n65.  The low level of public expenditure on health is explained by the low level of economic \ndevelopment, low  relative priority given to  the  health  sector,  and the poor capacity of the \nGovernment to raise revenues. In Tajikistan the total revenue from taxes has remained around \n11% of the GDP, a very low level of tax collection (revenue collected as a percentage of GDP in \nlow-income countries is 14% on average). It is hard to expect a significant raise in the economy, \nhealth sector priority, and  tax revenue in the short term. The baseline scenario for planning \nhealth financing is that the health share of the public budget will not increase significantly. While \nit is necessary to increase  resource allocations for health, it is also vital to assure that  the \nmoney spent achieves the best possible results and health gains. That efficiency concerns have \nto  penetrate  the  system  is  one  of  the  major  targets  of  the  HSRP in capacity building, \nrationalization, and reforms. If the required changes do not materialize under the HSRP or are \nnot sustained, there will be failure of not only the financial sustainability of the HSRP but also \nthat of the entire health system as well. The Government must sustain its commitment to PHC. \nThe  HSRP  will  intensify  policy  dialogue  in  pursuing  capacity  building,  rationalization, and \nreforms as well as in giving priority to the health sector. \n \nC.  Environment \n \n66.  The HSRP has been classified in category B for environmental impact. The summary of \nthe initial environmental examination is in Appendix 16.12 The HSRP will rehabilitate and rebuild \n                                                 \n12  The full Summary of the Initial Environmental Examination is in Supplementary Appendix H. ", " 17\nhospitals and  health centers in five districts. Environmental benefits will be  realized through \nimproved medical waste management and wastewater disposal.  The HSRP will (i) ensure that \nappropriate environmental measures are put in place, (ii) organize training for health workers \nand local governments on medical waste management, (iii) set up an environment monitoring \nmechanism, and (iv) improve wastewater and reagent management at the drug quality center \nwhen reagents are provided for drug quality analysis. Guidelines for reagent management will \nbe prepared, training organized, and environmental monitoring done.  \n \nD.  Social Analysis \n \n67.  The HSRP aims to increase equity  and effectiveness in distributing health benefits in \nTajikistan by focusing on five districts disadvantaged by recent natural disasters, the civil war, \npoverty, and health status. For the poor, women, and children who are also specific foci, HSRP \nwill use health measures that are internationally proven. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy form is in Appendix 17.  \n \n68.  Poverty  remains  the  central  development  issue  in  Tajikistan.  The Tajikistan Living \nStandards Survey reported that 83% of the population lined below the poverty line in 1999. The \nsurvey also revealed that poverty rates were high for households with many children and those \nheaded by women, the unemployed, persons  without access to any social safety net (the \ndisabled, school dropouts, street children, and the elderly), single pensioners, and returnees \nand  internally  displaced  population.  Geographically,  rural  areas  particularly  in  remote \nmountainous  areas,  have  more  and  deeper  poverty.  The  HSRP  will  target  poor  areas, \nparticularly, mountainous districts, to ensure access to health services.  \n \n69.  The  HSRP is also designed to respond effectively to the poor\u2019s health-seeking behavior \nand health conditions. Thus, the HSRP will address the most important health problems of the \npopulation, particularly the poor, and  make it easier for them to use  the necessary health \nservices. Despite the generally worse health outcomes, the poor do not recognize their poor \nhealth as reflected in the low percentage of people who report illness in surveys. Many do not \nseek health services until conditions become very serious and rely on self-medication. Surveys \nindicate that use of health services by the poor is about half of that by the non-poor. The poor \nare more likely to suffer from infectious diseases, maternal and child health problems, and \nmalnutrition. Financial burden is the major factor preventing the poor from using health services. \nLack of information or ignorance is also a concern. Information that the public sector provides to \nthe poor is limited. The HSRP will supply the pro-poor health package free by considering the \npoor\u2019s priority health problems and the cost-effectiveness of  health services. To deliver the \npackage, the HSRP will develop the FGP system that is considered the most pro-poor delivery \nmethod. Information will be disseminated to reach the poor. The HSRP expects to bring the \npoor\u2019s use of health services to the same level as that of the non-poor and reduce the burden of \npoverty-related diseases.  \n \n70.  Reproductive health is a major concern in Tajikistan. High birth rates, high rates of \nmaternal and infant mortality, large numbers of abortions, and rising prevalence of sexually \ntransmitted infections all contribute to low women\u2019s health status. The situation is compounded \nby the growing incidence of informal charges for health care services. The perceived financial \nburden is particularly high among women seeking reproductive health services: 80% of women \nof reproductive age who were not pregnant cited cost as  the main reason for not using \ncontraceptives; 60% of pregnant women who do not obtain antenatal care think that they cannot \nafford it. Poor women increasingly give birth at home without medical assistance to reduce the \ncosts associated with childbirth. About half of all births in 1998 were delivered at home. If the \n ", "18  \npro-poor  package  including antenatal and delivery care, family  planning, and treatment of \nsexually transmitted infections is used effectively, the HSRP will reduce the number of women \nwithout access to reproductive health by more than half. \n \n71.  The Republic of Tajikistan is composed of a number of cultural groups.  Tajiks have \nincreased from 56.2% of the population in 1970 to 62.3% in 1989. Ethnic groups are widely \ndistributed throughout the country, although locally some clustering tends to occur.  No specific \ndata is available on the health and education status of ethnic minority groups. All understand \nand speak the Tajik language and there are health workers and teachers from minority groups. \nThe constitution of Tajikistan states that no person will be discriminated against on the basis of \nethnic origin, and minorities are guaranteed equal access to education and health. According to \nNGOs working in the HSRP pilot districts, ethnic minorities are well integrated in society and \nhave the same level of health and education status, with the exception of elderly Russians. The \nHSRP is classified in Category C in terms of indigenous people.  \n \nE.  Economic and Financial Analysis \n \n72.  Improved people\u2019s health status with the HSRP can be quantified in economic terms. \nThe economic benefits will result from resource cost savings, representing a reduction in out-of-\npocket expenses, and productivity gains.  The HSRP will reform health service delivery and \nfinancing mechanisms to promote system efficiency and  service quality. The proposed FGP \nsystem has operational advantages and would be more cost-effective, compared with the NGO-\nrun health system (Appendix 6). It will also provide incentives for providers to serve the poor, \nwomen, and children. Service users will receive effective services with reduced risk of informal \npayments. Community mobilization and strengthened monitoring will reinforce the supervisory \nfunctions over service quality and payment. In addition, HSRP\u2019s free pro-poor health service \npackage, including drugs, will constitute a substantial economic benefit itself, given the level of \nprivate expenditure on drugs.  More  effective services, reduced informal payment, and free \ndrugs will substantially contribute to resource cost savings. \n \n73.  Productivity gains will result from fewer days lost because of illness and a consequent \nincrease in productivity. HSRP will provide cost-effective measures to reduce IMR, MRM, and \nunder-5 mortality corresponding to MDG by 30% in HSRP districts. The economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) is estimated to be around 24.1%. HSRP has a potential to directly benefit \napproximately 350,000 people in pilot districts and will generate further benefits for the whole \ncountry. Sensitivity analysis shows that the strongest factor influencing economic returns is the \nextension of the benefits  by  expanding  reformed  systems  nationwide.  The  results  of  the \nsensitivity analysis call attention to the need for keeping a nationwide perspective and for \nextracting valuable lessons from the pilot regions to be applied to the whole country. Analysis of \nthe financial sustainability of nationwide establishment of the FGP system indicates that the total \npublic  health  budget  must  be  increased  to  1.5%  of  GDP.  This  percentage  represents  a \nsubstantive increase from the current level of 0.9%, but is still well below the 3% observed in \nother Central Asian republics (Appendix 6). MOF plans to increase the public health allocations \nto 1.8% of GDP (as indicated in Supplementary Appendix A) to increase the chances of FGP \nsystem sustainability. The HSRP will undertake policy dialogue to ensure that the increase is \nrealized. \n \n74.  The  analysis  also  evaluated  the  HSRP  impact  on  the  Government  budget.  The \nGovernment\u2019s annual share in project costs will average around $0.38 million, about 2.8% of the \nhealth  sector  annual  budget  of  about  $13.5  million.  The  recurrent  costs  borne  by  the \nGovernment during the  HSRP are about $0.18 million per year. The budgetary impact of the ", " 19\nestimated  annual  recurrent  costs  during  and  after  HSRP  implementation  is  considered \nmanageable. The detailed economic and financial analyses are in Appendix 18. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n75.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal document. \n  \n1.  Project Implementation and Monitoring \n \n76.  A  distinct  supervisory  group  will  have  been  established  in  each  HSRP  district, \nacceptable to ADB, within 3 months of loan effectiveness  \n \n77.  MOH and MOF will agree to establish in each pilot district a district PIU that will cover \nthe roles of the district health department, within 3 months of loan effectiveness  \n \n78.  The President\u2019s Office, MOH, and HSRP district governments will finalize the PPMES \nindicators,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  integrate  these  into  HMIS  within  6  months  of  loan \neffectiveness date. Indicators of the poor\u2019s access to and use of essential health services will be \nincluded. Impact indicators will contribute to monitoring the achievement of MDGs. \n \n2.  Reform  Planning,  Monitoring,  and  Policy  Dialogue  Based  on  Health \nManagement Information System \n \n79.  An intersectoral committee (MOH, MOF, medical university, and aid agencies) will be \ncreated within 6 months of loan effectiveness to review and use the HMIS data to plan and \nmonitor the reform process and to maintain policy dialogue with aid agencies on reform.  \n \n3.  Human Resource Development \n \n80.  MOH and the medical university will develop a workforce plan and targets within 15 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. MOH will develop a time-bound action plan to meet workforce \ntargets on staff reduction and equitable distribution of staff; the medical university will develop a \ntime-bound action plan on student intake and outputs consistent with the workforce plan, within \n21 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n4.  Introducing the FGP System in the HSRP Districts \n \n81.  MOH will develop the legal and financial framework of the FGP system to be pilot-tested \nin the HSRP districts within 18 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n82.   The Government should legalize, as a pilot test, the introduction of the FGP system with \na financial and monitoring package in the HSRP districts within 21 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe package covers FGP geographical mapping; population registration; capitation payment; \nperformance-based contracts; monitoring of access to and use of FGP services by the general \npopulation, particularly the poor, women of  reproductive age, infants, and other vulnerable \ngroups; user satisfaction; and FGP\u2019s performance. \n \n5.  Rationalizing System and Staffing in HSRP Districts \n \n83.  The local government of the HSRP districts, together with MOH, will develop and adopt \nplans, acceptable to ADB, for rationalizing excess health facilities and hospital beds and poor \n ", "20  \nstaff distribution in the HSRP districts within 21 months of loan effectiveness. The plans will be \nimplemented from year 3 of the HSRP. \n \n6.  Financial Matters \n \n84.  MOF will issue decrees to allow local governments to keep and reuse the district health \nbudget savings from system  rationalization and to allow local governments to reallocate  the \nhealth workforce at their discretion and as appropriate to the health system in the HSRP districts, \nwithin 1 month of loan effectiveness. \n \n85.  MOH and MOF will agree to provide\u2014after the HSRP\u2019s completion\u2014through its public \nhealth budget the capitation payment budget and the pro-poor health package cost introduced \nby the HSRP to ensure their sustainability. The Government will submit a budget plan covering \ncapitation payment and the pro-poor package by the midterm review of the HSRP. \n \n86.  Throughout project implementation, ADB will continue the policy dialogue with MOH and \nMOF to increase the share of public health expenditure devoted to PHC from 6% in 2003 to \n20% by the end of 2008. MOH and MOF will provide baseline data of the budget allocation \namong the levels of the health system within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n7.  Environmental Measures and Other Safeguards \n \n87.  The Government will ensure that (i) environmental classification will be conducted for \neach  subproject  and  IEE  will  be  prepared,  if  necessary,  during  civil  works  surveys,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines;  (ii)  an  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP) covering medical waste will be developed and implemented corresponding to the laws \nand procedures of the Government and the environmental requirements presented in  the \nsummary IEE in Appendix 16; and (iii) a report on the progress  of EMP will be submitted \nsemiannually. \n \n88.  If it becomes necessary to build new facilities under the HSRP, the district administration \nwill  screen  for  any  involuntary  resettlement  effects  and  prepare  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plans, in line with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n89.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 5,238,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Health Sector Reform \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n                  Tadao Chino \n                President\n                                                 \n \n20 November 2003 \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  21\n \nHEALTH SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Large-scale changes in the political and economic environment over the decade have \ncreated many new challenges to the health care system in Tajikistan. But little has changed \nsince Soviet times and the health system is unable to protect the health of the population.   \n \nA.  Management Structure and Function \n \n2.  The Government remains the main public financier and provider of health care services. \nThere are five main levels of management: the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Health \n(MOH), region and Dushanbe health departments, chief doctors of central district hospitals who \nare responsible for district health services, and facility managers. MOF budgets and transfers \nthe funds to regional administrations. The budget allocation is based on norms, such as \nnumbers  of  beds  and  staff,  rather  than  on  outputs.  Norms  have  not  been  revised  since \nindependence. MOH sets up health policies but has no control over the health budget, nor over \npolicy execution. A considerable degree of autonomy in the use of approved resources is given \nto local administrations at the district level. Local governments may use the resources according \nto the approved plan, but could use them differently. MOH can\u2019t ensure whether the health \nbudget has been executed properly or not.  \n \n3.  Despite overall responsibility for health care delivery at the district level, a district health \ndepartment  does  not  exist,  but  a  chief  doctor  of  the  central  district  hospital  manages  it. \nManagement of primary health care (PHC) by hospital staff creates a conflict of interest, such as \nthe priority given to hospital budget allocations  rather than to PHC. Budgets throughout the \nsystem are based on 11 line items and facility managers cannot transfer funds, giving no \nflexibility to lower-level managers. The current system lacks incentives for quality or efficiency. \nDue to the collapsed information system, managers at the national level have no accurate data \non which to base their decisions, while those at the field level who face real situations have no \nauthority to introduce changes.  \n \n4.  Institutional capacity to effectively plan, budget, manage, and monitor the health sector \nis weak at all levels. This capacity was not required before independence, as decisions were \nmade  in  Moscow.  Capacity  building  efforts  and  opportunities  for  exposure  to  efficient \nmanagement have been limited for several reasons: limited developmental work and capacity \nbuilding  by  external  agencies  under  emergency  situations, and  the  Government\u2019s  limited \nrecognition  of  the  need  for  increased  capacity  and  learning  alternative  health  system \nmanagement.  \n \nB.  Health Care Delivery \n \n5.  PHC is provided by community nurses, midwives, nurses, and doctors in a range of \nfacilities. The health care delivery system inherited from the former Soviet Union is extensive, \ncomplex, and fragmented at all levels. It is also costly. PHC is provided in cities at  polyclinics \nthat are fragmented, with separate clinics for adults, children, and women\u2019s reproductive health; \nin specialized dispensaries, and in health posts of universities. In rural areas, PHC facilities are \nmore complicated and consist of medical houses, the rural health centers, and rural hospitals. \nAbout 2,670 PHC facilities exist in the country. The high degree of specializations of doctors \nand nurses adds complications and  makes actual services to patients inefficient. There are \nabout 125 specialties. To provide care to the broad community, a number of  specialists of \ndifferent disciplines are present even at the PHC level. Health resources are used in providing \npotential access to medical care rather than in actual services to patients.  \n ", " 22 Appendix 1 \n \n \n6.  The PHC network has deteriorated substantially due to the economic depression and the \ncivil war. Facilities are in poor condition. If not supplied through humanitarian aid, equipment, \npharmaceuticals, and reference material are largely absent. Although  the bulk of the  PHC \nbudget is for salaries, salary levels are below the level necessary for survival, demoralizing the \nhealth staff. Unofficial fees are widely charged. Many staff members are forced to work outside \nof the health system. Overstaffing has been amended without any regulations, as many have \nofficially left the system to seek better pay. Some remain officially within the system but do not \nwork where they are supposed to. Facilities are often seen not staffed or not used. One facility \nsurvey of the ADB Social Sector Rehabilitation Project revealed  that a staff of only 70  are \nworking in a district where more than 230 are supposed to work.  \n \n7.  The  hospital  sector  is  overly  specialized,  extensive,  and  fragmented.  About  428 \nhospitals with 41,925 beds (1 bed per 150 persons) exist. Physical infrastructure is often in poor \ncondition, particularly in rural and central district hospitals. Equipment has not been upgraded \nsince independence and much is nonfunctional. Consumables are in short supply, patients \nusually have to purchase pharmaceuticals, and pay for their food although these items are \nofficially free. Patients usually make payments to nurses and doctors. The number of hospital \nbeds decreased from 1,096 per 100,000 population in 1991 to 680 per 100,000 in 1999, \ngenerating reported savings of $5 million. However, the savings from rationalization were taken \nfrom the health sector by  MOF which bases budget allocation on the number of beds.  The \naverage length of stay has changed little at 14.0 days in 1999, well above the European \naverage of 9.6 days. Hospital rationalization is Government policy, but the current plan includes \nonly closure of rural hospitals or their conversion to rural health centers. Conversion of so many \nhighly specialized hospitals into general hospitals or inefficient hospital management, such as \nlow intensity of care and long period of stay, has not yet been addressed in the Government \npolicy paper.     \n \n8.  Reflecting  the  deteriorated  health  care  system,  the  use  of  health  services  is  low, \nparticularly among the poor. The poor's use of health services is about half that of the non-poor. \nThis is due to several factors: cost of consultation, official and unofficial; distrust of health staff; \nand cost of drugs. Regional difference in health service use also exists. In Sughd region, people \nuse health services four times a year, while in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAR) \nand Kahtlon, the poorest regions, people use services only at 1.5 and 1.6 times a year. The \npopulation, but excluding the poor, use hospitals more. A fixed salary provides no incentives for \nhealth staff to serve those unable to pay. Another issue requiring attention is the increasing \nproportion of home deliveries and births without skilled health personnel.  According  to the \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), these births were less than 10% in 1990, but had \nincreased to 45% in 2000. The rising proportion of home delivery suggests the breakdown of the \nlocal health care system and the financial inability of families to pay for medical care.   \n \n9.  Against this background, the Government has adopted a policy to move to a generalist-\nbased system (family group practice [FGP]), so as to alter the balance toward expenditure on \ndirect patient care, rationalize PHC facilities, and promote access to basic health care by the \npoor. Aid agencies have been actively retraining specialists and transforming them into family \ndoctors and nurses. So far around 400 staff members have been trained. Medical students who \ntake family medicine have started to graduate. However, the FGP system itself has not been set \nup and trained staff continue to cover the same narrow field that were their original specialty.  \nWithout a system in place, training benefits will quickly be lost.    \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  23\n \nC.  Health Care Financing and Budget Allocation \n \n10.  A large out-of-pocket payment is the main feature of health care financing in Tajikistan. \nThe total health expenditures in 2001, which amounted to TJS95 million ($39 million) or TJS15 \nper capita ($6.3), were financed by (i) users, at least 31% of total expenditures; (ii) Government, \n26%; (iii) development banks, 7%; and (iv) humanitarian agencies, 36%. Salaries of personnel \nare the government focus, with users matching  these resources. Drugs are  the users\u2019 main \nspending item funded by external agencies that are leading the investment efforts. \n  \n11.  Out-of-pocket expenses, in order of importance are for (i) drugs and ancillary items, (ii) \nin-patient and outpatient consultation fees (official and unofficial), and (iii) hospitalization fees.  \nConsultation fees  are collected according to  the price schedule of each hospital or health \ncenter. Most other services are left to discretionary price setting. Fees collected at the health \ncenter are kept in the facility.  MOH does not standardize and regulate user charges. Users \ncharges at the time of use of health care are likely to impede access of the poor to the needed \nservices. On the other hand, although the population pays a significant share of the medical \ncare, these resources don\u2019t address the priority problems. Out-of-pocket payment is the most \nregressive way to pay for health care. This fact highlights the need  to \u201crationalize\u201d the user \npayments or the need to pool resources in a more efficient and equitable way.  \n \n12.  Currently, MOH is elaborating a proposal to introduce co-payments at the hospital and \nPHC level. The proposal recommends Identifying various mechanisms to bring into the health \nsystem out-of-pocket payments. The mechanisms are (i) introducing standardized user charges; \nand (ii) pooling resources through different community financing schemes, including  a drug \nrevolving fund, prepayment at PHC level, and community insurance at the hospital level. It is \nplanned that the users charges should combine with free provision of a health package within \nthe current budgetary resources available.  \n \n13.  During the decade of political crisis, the health sector lost priority, and  public health \nexpenditures fell from 4.8% of GDP in 1990,  3.1% in 1995, 0.96% in 2001, and to 0.86% in \n2002. As the GDP itself has shrunk to 40% of its 1991 level in 1999, the actual public spending \non health per capita has decreased to 1.5% of that in 1991. The public health expenditure is \nlimited not only in its budget size, but also in its efficient use. About 50% of the budget goes to \nsalaries and staff\u2019s social security, 20%  to  maintenance  and  operation,  and  14% to food. \nMedicine accounts for 10% and others such as training receive only 1.5%. Capital expenses for \nequipment and civil works account for about 5%. At the PHC level, about 95% goes to salaries \nand social security. The distribution of  expenditures by line item shows a distorted picture, \nespecially at the PHC level, leaving actual services unmet. Despite the Government policy on \nstrengthening  PHC,  the  share  of  public  health  expenditure  at  the  PHC  level  is  low  and \ndecreasing: 7.3% in 2000 and 6% in 2002. The hospital sector receives majority of the budget.   \n \nD.  Human Resource Development \n \n14.  A number of human resource issues have been constraining the delivery of affordable, \neffective, quality health services in Tajikistan. They include issues related to efficiency and cost \nof the use of human resources, staff distribution and equity of services, staff performance, and \ncapacity for human resource policy and planning. The cost-effective use of human resources is \nkey to the delivery of health services in a resource-constrained context as in Tajikistan. Analysis \nof the current situation suggests a lack of consistency in available staffing data, overstaffing at \nnational and provincial levels and understaffing at district and health centers levels, significant \ngaps in key staff categories, inappropriate deployment of specialty staff, poorly defined roles \n ", " 24 Appendix 1 \n \nand functions of staff, and weak human resource management. It is difficult to allocate staff to \nremote facilities because of low salaries and incentives and weak workforce management. \n \n15.  Human resource policy and planning capacity is not well developed. The implementation \nof human resource policy and plans is incomplete. The capacity  within MOH is insufficient. \nExisting standards for service delivery and staffing are outdated. The human resource database \nis not yet ready for use in comprehensive workforce planning. \n \nB.  The Government Policy and Strategies \n \n16.  Since  1991,  MOH  has  adopted  major  changes  in  national  health  policy  direction. \nParticularly  in  1998\u20132000,  MOH  developed  the  comprehensive  health  sector  reform  plan \nsupported by international agencies, such as World Health Organization (WHO) and European \nCommittee Humanitarian Office (ECHO). In adjusting to the socioeconomic, demographic, and \nepidemiological situation, the master plan emphasizes PHC as the strategy for delivering health \nservices to the population that is responsive to needs of client,  particularly the poor, women, \nand children; cost-effective; and of good quality with equitable and sustainable access.  \n \n17.  To implement the  reform plan,  further health strategies  such as the   \u201cConception on \nHealth  Care  Reform  in  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan\u201d  were  developed.  The  developmental \nstrategies for health care reform defined in this document have the following objectives: \n \n(i)  Setting Priorities. State resources are inadequate to solve all existing problems; \ntherefore, there is a need to prioritize. \n \n(ii)  Strengthening the primary health care.  As the majority of health problems can \nbe solved at the PHC level in a more cost-effective way, all strategic measures \nare directed to improving PHC.  \n \n(iii)  Distributing  resources  according  to  need.  Health  care  resources  will  be \nallocated in accordance with the system requirements, considering geographical \npeculiarities, demographic and health indicators, and level of health service. \n \n(iv)  Developing human resources. Human resources are key to the health status of \nthe population and solving  priority health problems.  Health policy should be \ndirected to supplying health care facilities with quality human resources. \n \n(v)  Rationalization of services. Scarce resources should be used wisely. \n \n(vi)  Improving the quality of care. The quality of the provided health care will \ncontinuously be improved and will be oriented to the final result. \n \n(vii)  Strengthening  management  capacity. Developing management capacity is \nindispensable for successful realization of health care reforms. \n \n(viii)  Ensuring necessary information for management.  Information systems are \nimportant in providing feedback for decisions and monitoring reform impact.  \n  \n(ix)  Creating among the population personal responsibility for their own health.  \nHealth care reforms should address the needs of the population. It is important to \nconsider public opinion in developing the health care structure and sector activity.

Introduction \n \n1.  A family group practice (FGP) is a team of doctors and nurses who work as a private \nentity through contract with the local government and provides primary health care (PHC) and \nholistic family health services to the population. Tajikistan has no tradition of general practice. \nThe health care delivery system inherited from the former Soviet Union and continuing without \nsignificant changes is extensive, complex, and fragmented at all levels of the system.  PHC is \nprovided in cities at polyclinics that are fragmented with separate clinics for adults, children, and \nwomen\u2019s reproductive health; at specialized dispensaries; and at health posts of universities. In \nrural areas it is more complicated. PHC facilities in rural areas are medical houses (previously \ncalled FAP), rural clinics, and rural hospitals.    \n \n2.  The specialist system of around 125 different specialties further adds complications and \ninefficiency to actual services to patients. For example, a doctor could be a specialist \u201ccardiac \nreanimator\u201d whose sole responsibility is resuscitating patients suffering from cardiac arrest and \ncardiogenic shock. To provide care to the broad community, a number of specialists of different \ndisciplines  are  found  even  at  the  PHC  level.  A  consequence  of  this  high  degree  of \nspecialization, the number of patients seen by many individual doctors is extremely low; thus, \nmost resources are used in providing potential access to medical care rather than on actual \nservices to patients. The move to a generalist-based system aims to allocate funds for direct \npatient care through the provision of doctors who are able to treat, at least in the first instance, \npatients of both genders and all ages exhibiting the most problems. \n  \n3.  As part of overall health sector reforms, a general practice model has been proposed. In \n2000, the Ministry of Health (MOH) prepared the draft document on Health Reform Master Plan \n2000\u20132010 that sets out  a plan for retraining and training  family doctors and nurses. On 4 \nMarch 2002, the Government approved the concept of health reforms including the retraining of \nfamily doctors and nurses. Students choosing to specialize in family medicine undertake training \nin years 6 and 7 at the Tajik medical university, which is the only institution providing medical \nundergraduate training. At first, 11 students took the family doctor training program in 2001 and \ngraduated in June 2003. In 2002, only 25 out of 500 students chose to go to family medicine, \nindicating the low popularity of the program.  \n \n4.  The postgraduate medical institute conducts retraining of family doctors and nurses. So \nfar, over 240 specialists have been retrained since 1998. In 2001, 13,400 medical doctors \nregistered in Tajikistan. Only 1.8% majored in family medicine. In 2001 MOH and  the World \nHealth  Organization  (WHO)  shortened  the  course  from  8  months  to  6  months.  Several \ninternational agencies, such as Asian Development Bank/Social Sector Rehabilitation Project, \nthe World Bank, WHO,  Agha Khan Foundation, and Zdravplus, support retraining programs. \nCurrently 20-26 family doctors are trained annually. The same agencies support the retraining of \nfamily nurses.     \n \n5.  Evaluation of the family medicine retraining program has shown that doctors completing \nthe  program  continue  to  work  in  medical  houses  or  polyclinics  under  the  same  working \nconditions as before and tend to continue to see patients who fall within their original clinical \nspecialty. Apparently family  doctors and nurses are not only limited in numbers, but also \nineffective in providing services for which they have been trained.       \n \n ", "                    Appendix 6   33 \n6.  Introducing the FGP process involves, not only adoption of general and group practice, \nbut also  (i) a change in provider payment (from the norm-based budget allocation for state \nemployees to risk-adjusted capitation payment to private providers of service); (ii) introduction of \nperformance based contracts; (iii) the purchaser-provider split where the public health authority \nplays the role of purchaser while a FGP takes the role of an independently contracted provider, \nand registration of the population with FGPs; (iv) retraining programs; (v) accreditation systems \nto assure the quality of FGP services; and (vi) public information campaigns on the FGP system. \nA monitoring system is another important pillar for population registration, and performance and \nimpact monitoring. The pro-poor nature of the FGP system is  strengthened by capitation \npayment and contractual arrangements, and ensured by the monitoring system. The plan is to \nset up a FGP unit with a staff of two family doctors and two family nurses for multiple functions \nincluding management of the facility. The unit will cover 3,000 persons on average. (The reform \nplan proposal is for one family doctor to cover 1,500 persons.)    \n \nB.  Proposed Assistance Under the Health Sector Reform Project  \n \n7.  The capacity of the Government for policy development and administration is limited. It \nlacks experience in  planning and implementing  reforms. The Health Sector Reform Project \n(HSRP) will strengthen MOH  capacity and assist MOH to develop the operational, legal, and \nfinancial framework for the FGP system. The capitation rates and contracts\u2019 contents will be \ncarefully designed to have pro-poor incentives. District health departments will be created and \ntheir capacities built. Regional supervisory functions will be strengthened.  \n \n8.  The HSRP will finance capitation payment in pilot districts and will pilot-test the FGP \nsystem. The pilot activity will start from  year 3 of project implementation. By that time, the \ndesign of the FGP system will have been completed and enough trained staff available to start \nworking in the pilot  districts. The necessary legal framework and regulations will have been \nenacted and the management requisites will be in place. Simultaneously, facilities will have \nbeen rehabilitated, equipped, and supplied with medicines. Before the purchaser-provider split \nand contractual status of FGPs are introduced, extensive public campaigns, consultation, and \ndiscussion must take place to raise awareness and understanding.  \n \nC.  Capitation Payment \n   \n9.  Capitation is the payment scheme by which FGPs are paid according to the number of \npeople registered with them. Capitation should be introduced only when all requirements are in \nplace. Basic characteristics of the proposed capitation payment scheme follow: \n \n(i)  Contracts will be established between the FGP units and the district health departments. \nThe contract will set a series of targets, procedures, and monitoring measures. The pro-\npoor objective must be clearly stated in the contract. Specific monitoring instruments will \nsystematically evaluate the accomplishment of objectives.    \n  \n(ii)  The  package  will  include  consultation  to  start  the  scheme.  The  package  will  be \nexpanded to include drug costs after experience on FGP management has accumulated \nand health workers follow rational drug use.  \n  \n(iii)  The capitation rating will consider age, sex, and the poverty level of the registered \npopulation. This is to increase incentives for  the provider to see needy people (for \ninstance, infants and pregnant women) and the poor. \n  \n ", "34  Appendix 6 \n(iv)  The FGP unit will be accountable to the district health authority, and must comply with \nthe health policy being implemented. The staff might still keep their employee status and \ntheir salaries guaranteed until the purchaser-provider split is fully introduced.     \n \n(v)  At the  end of   year 2 of the HSRP there will be around 100 trained  family doctors. \nConsidering that each FGP unit (two doctors and two nurses) will cover a population of \n3,000  people,  around  114  FGPs  will  be  necessary  to  cover  the  whole  population \n(350,000) of the five pilot  districts. The full coverage in the pilot areas should be \nachieved by year 5 of the HSRP. For the 3 years of the HSRP,  there should thus be 57 \nFGPs on average.  \n  \n(vi)  The HSRP will allocate seed money to support the scheme for 3 years until the end of \nthe Project.  \n \nD.  Financial Feasibility of Nationwide Capitation Payment \n \n10.  After being evaluated in five HSRP districts, the FGP system will expand nationwide.  \n \n11.  The actual composition of the FGP unit and the capitation rate for the pilot districts will \nbe determined during the first 2 years of the HSRP. Due to the absence of suitable data for \ndetailed planning, the following indicative planning is made for estimating budget requirement \nfor the FGP system under the HSRP and nationwide. This indicative planning is based on the \nexperience in Mongolia that has successfully introduced FGP nationwide, but adjusted by the \neconomic difference between Mongolia ($400 of GDP per capita) and Tajikistan ($162). In \nMongolia, the introduction of FGP nationwide has increased by 7% in the allocation to PHC in \nthe public health budget, and transferring the hospital allocation to PHC offset this increase. The \nGovernment continues to pay the salary of family doctors and family nurses. Other costs1 \n(capitation, performance and development) will be met  by the HSRP. Under the contractual \narrangement, the FGP unit will receive $1,800 (TJS5,500) annually for 3,000 enrollees, based \non $0.6 per enrollee per year.   \n \n12.  For a nationwide FGP system, around 2,066 FGP units will be set up and around \nTJS11,363,000 per year will be required to finance the system. (Considering that the annual \ncost of one FGP unit is TJS5,500, TJS11,363,000 per year will be necessary). Two possible \nfunding strategies are proposed to extend the scheme nationwide: one is based on increases in \nthe health budget, as in the Mongolian case, and the other  on pooling private contributions \ncollected locally. The HSRP will support a detailed feasibility analysis when the HSRP and the \nGovernment evaluate the pilot FGP system. The two strategies are briefly examined in paras. \n13-16.   \n  \n1.  Increasing Allocation to PHC or Increasing Public Expenditure  \n \n13.  If the additional requirement is to be covered by  reallocation from the public health \nbudget, the allocation to PHC must increase from 6% to 34%. For a proposed forecasted public \nhealth budget of TJS36 million by the end of year 5 of the HSRP (2008), the estimated total of \nTJS11.4 million for funding the scheme will represent 32% of the total budget. Considering that \nthe total spent on PHC currently represents only 6% of the public health budget, an increase by \n                                                 \n1 In the context of this paper, capitation refers to funding for the delivery of health care to enrolled populations. \nPerformance relates to payments made to FGPs who meet predefined performance standards for priority services \nand appropriate referral practices, and so on. Development refers to competitive grants for innovation in case \npractices. With other costs, the FGP will manage its services, excluding drug prescription.  \n ", "                    Appendix 6   35 \n34% would bring the system to a more adequate and efficient distribution of resources between \nprimary and hospital levels. The new distribution will correct a serious distortion of the current \nallocation.  The  HSRP  will  promote  system  rationalization,  including  reduction  of  beds, \nappropriate staff distribution, and increased  efficient hospital management, and will help the \nGovernment reallocate funds from the hospital sector to the PHC level. \n \n14.  If the requirement is to be covered by increasing the total public health budget, the total \nbudget  will  have  to  account  for  1.5%  of  GDP.  This  percentage,  despite  representing  a \nsubstantive increase from the current level of 0.9%, is still well below the 3% observed in other \ncentral Asian republics. This plan will  make the FGP system sustainable.  The Ministry of \nFinance plans to increase the public health budget to 1.8% by 2008. The HSRP will undertake \npolicy dialogue to see this plan happening and furthermore to raise public health expenditure to \nthe level in the other central Asian republics.    \n \n2.  Pooling Private Contributions           \n \n15.  Health care users have been making substantive formal and informal payments to \nhealthcare  providers.  The  payments  are  estimated  to  be  larger  than  the  Government \nexpenditure in health; therefore, it is important to design alternatives to bring these resources to \nthe system in a transparent and nondiscretionary way. The proposal discussed here envisages  \ncollecting a yearly contribution from the beneficiaries. The contributions should entitle the \nbeneficiaries to free health care throughout the year, and should be pooled at the district level.  \n \n16.  For estimation purposes, an indicative contribution of TJS2 should be collected annually \nfor  each  of  the  3,000  inhabitants  of  the  area  covered  by  a  FGP  unit.  Assuming  100% \ncompliance, a total of  TJS6,000 will be collected in the catchment area of the FGP unit. \nAccording to estimates, this fund will be enough for paying TJS500 a month to the FGP unit. \nSuch a scheme would release pressure on the Government budget. Considering that the annual \nout-of-pocket private expenditure in Tajikistan is estimated  as S$2 (TJS6.2) per capita, and \nassuming that 50% (TJS3.1) of that is spent on drugs and the other 50% is payment to health \ncare providers, the suggested contribution of TJS2 per capita should easily be affordable to the \nmajority of the population.  \n \nE.  Comparative Analysis of the FGP System and a NGO Service System \n \n17.  Involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  running  health  services \nimproves access to and the quality of the services. It is necessary to examine the possibility of \nsetting up a NGO-run health system in Tajikistan before deciding to set up the FGP system. \nTajikistan was an emergency country, and its public health system has collapsed. Only NGO-\nsupported health facilities function well. Continuing to use NGOs is an option. However, such an \napproach is not financially or operationally sustainable in Tajikistan for the following reasons. \nThe NGOs are international or affiliated with international support and too costly to be financed \nby the Government budget. NGOs\u2019 overhead cost is high and their health workers receive much \nhigher salaries than public health workers do. At present, emergency NGOs are withdrawing, \nwhile development NGOs or local NGOs are too few. In conclusion, the NGO health system is \nnot sustainable in Tajikistan. The proposed FGP system, as understood here, involves, not only \nadoption of general practice, but also (i) a change in provider payment and (ii) introduction of \nperformance-based contracts with rigid monitoring. These aspects will enhance the pro-poor \nnature of the FGP system and service efficiency. Hence, the proposed FGP system has the \nadvantages of the NGO system, but at the same time has the least cost based on appropriate \ncapitation rates. \n ", "   \n COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN   3\n6\n \n($ million) \n                                   \nA\nTotal Project  ADB  Government  p\np\nItem        Cost               Financing               Financing      e\nn\nd\n   Foreign    Local    Total    Foreign    Local    Total    Foreign    Local    Total  ix\n   Exchange   Currency    Cost    Exchange    Currency    Cost    Exchange   Currency    Cost   7\n \nA.

Background and Rationale \n \n1.   An effective health management information system (HMIS) is essential for planning, \nreforming, managing, and monitoring  the health sector of Tajikistan. However, reliable and \ndisaggregated  information  is  currently  lacking.  The  lack  of  reliable  data  on  the  existing \nworkforce seriously hampers effective human resource development planning. Financing data is \nrequired to design financing strategies and develop mechanisms for performance-based budget \nallocations. HMIS needs streamlining. The Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP) aims to reform \nthe  health  care  delivery  system  by  introducing  the  family  group  practice  (FGP)  and  the \ncapitation  payment  scheme.  It  is  important  to  ensure  that  HMIS  functions  effectively  in \nmonitoring the new systems\u2019 performance and evaluating the impacts of changes.  \n \n2.  In addition to lack of accurate information, the use of data for planning and monitoring is \nlow at all levels of the health system. Neither does a forum exist where the Government and \nexternal agencies could monitor and discuss the reform process and sector development. The \ntechnical assistance (TA) will set a foundation for improving decision making and policy and \nplanning capacity, supporting monitoring, and facilitating policy dialogue on sector reform and \ndevelopment between the government and external agencies. \n \n3.  Critical for measuring impacts is the availability of a baseline data that indicates  the \nactual situation in the health sector. It is important to survey HSRP pilot districts to determine \nthe level of health care delivery, including service use, and health status.   \n \nB.    Objectives \n \n4.  TA will (i) develop the HMIS framework and action plans at the Ministry of Health (MOH), \nregion, and district levels; (ii) provide a basis for planning, monitoring, and measuring system \nperformance  and  reforms;  and  (iii)  provide  a  monitoring  and  policy  dialogue  mechanism \nbetween the Government and external agencies. The TA will conduct an in-depth survey in pilot \ndistricts to obtain accurate and disaggregated baseline database for the health sector. The TA \nwill technically orient HSRP\u2019s HMIS component. Based on the TA\u2019s outputs,  the HSRP will \nestablish HMIS, conduct training nationwide, and facilitate policy dialogue on reforms \n \nC.  Scope and Methodology \n \n5.  First, the TA will review the situation and assess current capacity in handling HMIS data. \nIt will examine  a  list  of  data  currently  collected, the process of data  collection, gaps and \nusefulness of data collected, actual use of information at all levels, capacity of staff to effectively \nanalyze data, and accuracy of data. Consequently, the TA will develop the HMIS framework \nwith a minimum required data set, cost-effective methods, and a scheme to improve data quality. \nThe TA will train key MOH officials on HMIS while developing the HMIS framework. \n \n6.  Second, the TA will design and implement an in-depth survey on health care delivery \nand health status for the pilot district level. The baseline data produced by the survey will be \nused for planning, monitoring, and measuring HSRP activities. It will be fed into HMIS at the \nnational level to complement the system as well. Finally, the TA will create a forum where the \nGovernment and external agencies can review HMIS data and discuss the reform process. \n ", "46  Appendix 14 \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $355,000, of which $169,000 is in foreign \nexchange and $186,000 equivalent is in local currency. The Government has requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to finance $300,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost \nof $169,000 and $131,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance \nthe balance of the local currency cost through the provision of counterpart staff, office space \nwith utilities, and workshop facilities.

Background and Rationale \n \n1.  The former state drug procurement (including quality control) and distribution system in \nTajikistan collapsed after independence and has not been able to distribute any drugs in the last \n6 years. All drugs except those donated by humanitarian agencies must be purchased through \nprivate suppliers based in the country, either through out-of-pocket payment by individuals or \nthrough use of the state budget by public hospitals. Small-scale drug procurement by individual \nhealth facilities or individuals cannot benefit from economies of scale. Drug quality is uncertain. \nFacilities buy whichever drugs are readily available, without following the essential drugs list. \nThis situation contributes to further impoverishing the population and to wasting the already \ninadequate state budget allocated for medicines. Rebuilding public procurement, establishing \nquality control, and improving distribution capacity will lead to the availability and ensure the \nquality of cost-effective drugs needed by the poorest among the population. \n \n2.    The Government plans to establish a new drug procurement and nationwide distribution \nsystem under  the MOH. Some elements of the system are in place, including a nationwide \nnetwork of MOH warehouses, but the Government will require support in developing a long-term \nstrategy and in strengthening key aspects of the new system. A drug procurement center run by \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) financed by  the European  Commission Humanitarian \nOffice (ECHO), and established and maintained by Pharmaciens Sans Fronti\u00e8res (PSF) has \nbeen delivering essential drugs to health facilities supported by NGOs nationwide, but continued \nsupport is in doubt as  emergency-oriented, humanitarian agencies plan to exit the country. \nECHO had planned to cease  financial  support  by  May  2003,  but support has since been \nextended by 1 year. The Government hopes to incorporate essential elements of  the PSF \nsystem into the national system before ECHO and PSF exit, but it currently lacks the capacity to \nplan or manage this process.       \n \nB.  Objectives \n \n3.  The technical assistance (TA) will develop a drug procurement and distribution strategy \nthrough  a  participatory  process  involving  discussions,  exposing  MOH  staff  to  several \ndevelopment options, and reaching consensus. The strategy will cover all  aspects of the \nprocurement and distribution process, namely: selecting drugs, ensuring quality, managing the \ntender process, distributing drugs, managing stocks, and monitoring drug use and prices. The \nTA will (i) support policy dialogue and develop a clear strategy and framework for establishing a \ndrug procurement and distribution system, supported by action plans at  MOH, region, and \ndistrict levels; (ii) prepare a rational plan for warehousing, equipment distribution, and staffing; \nand (iii) provide  operational guidelines for the procurement process. Support for developing \nstrategies to strengthen public drug procurement and distribution capacity is urgently required to \nensure continuation of an adequate and reliable supply of quality drugs when assistance from \nhumanitarian agencies ends. The private sector currently does not have the capacity and lacks \nan appropriate policy/legal framework to assume these responsibilities immediately. The TA will \nfill the vacuum created by private sector absence and a lack of public sector capacity, while \nproposing long-term development strategies to increase private sector involvement, including \npublic-private partnerships, in drug procurement and distribution. \n \n4.  The TA will  complement and  technically support the Health Sector Reform Project \n(HSRP) subcomponent for establishing a drug procurement center. Using the TA\u2019s outputs, the \n ", "  Appendix 15  49 \nHSRP will establish the  drug procurement and distribution system and conduct necessary \ntraining at the national, regional, and pilot district levels.  \n   \nC.  Scope and Methodology \n \n5.  Through study tours, training, and workshops, the TA will build the capacity of MOH for \ndrug  procurement.  The  TA  will  help  MOH  assess  capacity,  performance,  problems,  and \nopportunities of the current public drug procurement system and the NGO system. Based on the \nassessment,  the  TA  will  support  a  consultative  process  to  help  MOH  develop  the  drug \nprocurement strategy (1 month) to achieve the core principles of public drug procurement, such \nas (i) procuring the most cost-effective drugs in the right quantities to treat prevailing health \nproblems in the majority of patients served; (ii) achieving the lowest possible total cost, taking \ninto account purchase price, hidden costs, holding costs, and operating costs; (iii) ensuring \ntimely delivery of products to health facilities and to patients; and (iv) assuring drug quality \nthrough suppliers selection, monitoring of supplies, and quality control programs (quality control \nprograms will be covered under the quality control subcomponent of the HSRP). \n \n6.  Based on the new drug procurement strategy, the TA will propose a drug procurement \nsystem framework and an implementation plan with  minimum required  interventions, cost-\neffective methods, and a scheme to establish a drug procurement system incorporating the PSF \nsystem. The TA will also prepare a detailed rationalized plan for warehousing, equipment \ndistribution and staffing of the center; formulate guidelines for the procurement process; and \nestablish contents and schedule for training. As proposed by the TA, the HSRP will establish the \ndrug procurement system and train MOH.    \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $180,000, of which $114,000 is  in foreign \nexchange and $66,000 equivalent is in local currency. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance  $150,000,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $114,000  and  $36,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency  cost  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space  with utilities  for  TA \nadministration, and workshop facilities. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Table A15.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  The TA will start in January 2004 and last for 6 months. The President\u2019s Office will be \nthe  Executing  Agency.  MOH  and  PSF  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The  steering \ncommittee for the HSRP will guide the TA and oversee Government coordination, ensuring \nclose links with the HSRP. It will meet on a quarterly basis.  \n \n9.  The TA will directly contract with PSF.1 A team of international and domestic consultants \nwill implement the TA. The TA will provide 4 person-months of international consulting services \nin the areas of drug procurement and management of the drug supply. The TA will also provide \n18 person-months of domestic consulting services in the same areas and in logistics.   \n                                                 \n1 As approved by ADB, HSRP will directly contract PSF to exploit its expertise in building new system's capacity and \ntransferring responsibility for running the humanitarian supply system. For the same reason, it is proposed to \ndirectly select PSF for the TA as well. \n ", "50  Appendix 15 \n \n \nTable A15: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan   \n($'000) \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP) was rated as environmental category B in the \nrapid  environmental  assessment.  This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE) \nanalyzes the scope of the potential environmental, health, safety, and social impacts.  \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n2.  SIEE  fieldwork  and  interviews  did  not  reveal  concern  about  the  vegetation at the \nsubproject sites. Endangered species and other wildlife are not affected since their living areas \nare far from the subproject sites. There are no cultural heritage sites in the project areas. Public \nhealth conditions are very poor. Generally, the health facilities are in very poor condition. Even \nbuildings erected after 1990 show substantial damage to structures and equipment due to lack \nof maintenance.  Because of  their potential environmental impact, water supply, wastewater, \nwaste disposal, and drug handling are identified as issues of concern for the Project. \n \n3.  Water Supply. The availability of safe drinking water is a high priority need. The water \nsupply infrastructure of most hospitals is old. It is not maintained and, as a result, is either not \nworking properly or completely out of order. While central district hospitals are connected to the \nwater supply networks,  others depend on on-site artesian wells (over 60 meters deep). The \nquality of the local pipe system usually does not meet  Government standards and is unsafe \nusing any other possible benchmarks. The poor technical condition of wells is a major problem, \nas they are filled with sediment and the well equipment is in bad condition or inoperative. Due to \nlack of a continuous supply of electricity, drinking water from both networks and on-site wells is \nusually supplied only 2-4 hours a day. Smaller medical structures like medical houses or rural \nhealth centers are as a rule not connected to piped water. Their demand for drinking water is \nsignificantly smaller than that of hospitals, as no beds are occupied. \n \n4.  Wastewater. The current situation wastewater management in with hospitals/clinics is \nunsustainable, causing pollution of drinking water sources and waterborne epidemics. Hospitals \nhave toilets, but there are no provisions for safe wastewater treatment/discharge. Only hospital \nbuildings located in central towns of rural areas are connected to sewer systems, which are in a \nvery bad condition. Sewer systems and treatment of municipal wastewater are the responsibility \nof local authorities. On-site wastewater treatment facilities, if in place, lack maintenance and are \nfunctioning  badly.  Clinics  in  most cases have pit latrines that are  not protected from  the \nelements,  have  no  provision  for  their  maintenance,  and  lack  basic  hygiene  education \nrequirements.  \n     \n5.  Waste Management. There is concern  about the potential transmission of infectious \ndiseases through inadequate management of waste from medical facilities. A number of laws \nand guidelines for handling hazardous waste are in place, but it is not clear whether waste from \nmedical facilities is considered hazardous.  Hospitals operate solid, medical  (syringes, blood \nbags), and human waste  (placenta, fetuses, body parts). Medical houses and rural health \ncenters produce solid and medical waste.  \n \n6.  In the medical houses the total amount of waste is small  because medical services \noffered are limited. However, safe waste storage is needed. Hospitals have a significant amount \nof waste due to their larger size,  the number of beds and the more comprehensive health \ntreatment offered. For a  central district hospital, about 2-3 cubic meters of waste excluding \n ", "52  Appendix 16 \nmunicipal solid waste is typically generated  weekly. Waste generation is slightly higher in \nsummer than in winter, as people tend to postpone nonemergency medical treatment until \nsummer due to lack of heating or acceptable sanitation. Currently, at best, medical waste is \nstored in containers together with other kinds of waste and disposed of, where other municipal \nsolid waste is also dumped. Human waste is mostly generated in maternity houses (placenta, \nfetus) and surgery departments (body parts) and is often mixed with medical waste. Solid waste \nis disposed of at local dump sites. Technical methods of disposal are poor and inappropriate \nbecause there are no regular and safe disposal facilities. With road connections between the \nproject areas and  district centers bad or absent, particularly in mountainous areas in winter \ntimes, waste is often stored conducted on-site.  \n \n7.  Drug Handling. The  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH) has issued  regulations for  the safe \nstorage of medical drugs and equipment, including syringes, plastics, etc., to guide all ministries \nand agencies. In rural areas,  however, institutions are generally not able to comply with the \nregulations.  \n \nC.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n \n8.  The  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  (MEP)  is  the  state  body  responsible  for \nenvironmental protection and management.  The  Government  agency  responsible  for  testing \nand approving all drinking water supplies is the Sanitary Epidemiological Services (SES) under \nMOH. The SES offices at district level take water samples, conduct tests and issues permits. \nThe regulation on environmental impact assessment issued by MEP in August 2000 details the \ncontents  of  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (EIS),  specifies  its  documentation,  and \nestablishes a process of review and approval, including public review. \n \n9.  Water Supply. Comprehensive improvement of  the water supply  pipe networks from \ncommunities is beyond the scope of HSRP. HSRP will repair the pipe in hospital premises or dig \nwells or provide disinfectants, but  will not repair the whole pipe network.  If there is no pipe \nnetwork and/or the decision is made to provide an individual water source, the HSRP will study \nhow acceptable quality of drinking water can be provided in cost-effective and sustainable ways \nby (i) monitoring the quality of the new/former water source; (ii) improving the existing source of \nwater or using an alternative water source if improvement of sources is not possible (tube wells \nover  60  meter  deep  are  recommended  as  surface  water  and  ground  water  sources  are \nconsidered  unsafe);  and  (iii)  establishing  adequate  operation  and  maintenance  and  water \nquality monitoring procedures. The relatively small demand for drinking water for  medical \nhouses and heath centers  will be satisfied through bottled water or other appropriate and \naffordable options. There are no existing groundwater-related subsidence problems in HSRP \ndistricts and limited amount of water intake for rebuilt or renovated facilities is not likely to cause \nshortages or cause conflicts with other water users. No special monitoring will be required. \n \n10.  Wastewater Disposal.  The HSRP will not cover rehabilitation of sewer systems in the \ntowns. If local authorities cannot ensure the reliability of sewage systems, the HSRP will provide \non-site septic tanks to health facilities. Chemicals for septic tanks treatment processes will be \nprovided (e.g., lime chloride).  \n \n11.  Waste Management.  For medical houses and health centers, the HSRP will provide \nsafe, temporary on-site storage equipped with transport containers. The HSRP will arrange for \ntemporary stored waste  to be transported for final disposal to the  center district hospitals. \nLeachate will be collected and treated on site or disposed of in sewer systems. For hospitals, \ntwo disposal routes will be established under the HSRP: (i) human waste will be burned in on-\n ", "  Appendix 16  53 \nsite incinerators; if no combustion capability is available, other appropriate equipment will be \ninstalled at hospitals; and (ii) solid and medical waste will be disposed of either on-site or in \nupgraded designated areas of existing landfills. The technical staff of the hospital will supervise \nall major activities regarding on-site waste management.  \n \n12.  Handling of Expired Drugs and Wasted Reagents. The HSRP will provide necessary \nfurniture to ensure that expired drugs are stored safely in designated metal lockable containers, \nplaced in an administration room until collection takes place.  The HSRP will provide on-site \ntanks for wasted reagents with chemicals, as necessary, to avoid environmental damage by \nreagents.    \n \n13.  Project Location and Design. The HSRP will attempt to rehabilitate/build structures at \nexisting locations as much as possible  and therefore  is not  likely to  cause any incremental \nenvironmental impacts due to conflicting land use or impediments to movement of people and \nlivestock. Designated sites for disposing of hospital waste disposal will not require expansion of \ncurrently functioning landfills run by local authorities. No resettlement is anticipated. However, \nwhen necessary, resettlement will be pursued according to guidelines of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). The HSRP will ensure that rehabilitated/rebuilt infrastructure facilities meet safety, \nseismic and fire compliance norms (including building materials, electrical systems, operations \nand maintenance of boilers and remaining stoves).  \n \n14.  Construction Stage. Adverse environmental impacts associated with civil works will be \nminimal, of short duration, and mitigated by appropriate design and management of facilities \nconstruction and operation.   \n \n15.  Project Operation. The HSRP will establish a monitoring system, which will include \nchecks on drinking water quality, maintenance and operations of water supply, waste collection, \nsanitation, waste disposal, and drug and reagent handling.  \n \nD.  Environmental Monitoring Program  \n \n16.  Civil works will be subject to environmental classification conducted jointly by the project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  assisted  by  environment  consultants.  IEEs  for  facilities  will  be \nconducted where they are required. IEEs will be (i) based on the results of the civil work surveys \nand social analysis; (ii) designed in accordance with the Government and ADB requirements by \nlocal design institutes in charge of designing of subproject civil works; and (iii) approved by \nMOH. 1 Environmental monitoring procedures during design, construction and operation will be \nspecified and monitored by implementing an environmental management plan (EMP) designed \nfor  each  health  facility.  The  EMP  will  cover  the  design  and  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures, and specify monitoring activities to ensure compliance. EMPs will be designed by \nlocal design institutes and approved by MOH.2 They will include (i)  an action plan on staff \nhygiene education; (ii) a handbook on operations and maintenance procedures; (iii) internal and \nexternal monitoring procedures; (iv) a financial sustainability plan for operating facilities, and a \nfollow-up monitoring plan; (v) contracts with qualified technical permanent/contractual staff to \noperate facilities; (vi) contracts with local authorities for emptying septic tanks  regularly; (vii) \ncontract agreements for disposing of medical waste to the landfills/rural hospitals, and for \ndisposing of human waste  in furnaces; and (viii) training courses in operating  environmental \n                                                 \n1 I EEs for subprojects exceeding $100,000 for civil works will be approved by ADB. \n2 EMPs for subprojects exceeding $100,000 for civil works will be approved by ADB. \n ", "54  Appendix 16 \nequipment, safe management/disposal of medical waste, water conservation practice, and  \nemployee health and safety training. \n \n17.  Civil work surveys, IEEs, and EMPs will be designed in a participatory manner through \ninput of local information, and intensive public discussions with health and education providers, \nhospital  management  and  personnel,  district  administrators,  and  village  development \ncommittees. Environmental public information campaign and training will be a part of project-\nwide health management information system and public information campaigns.  \n \n18.  The national steering committee, consisting of MOH, MEP, and Ministry of Construction, \nwill direct and supervise the implementation of project environmental mitigation measures. The \nPIU will be responsible for administering the project\u2019s environmental monitoring system. It will \nensure the incorporation of environmental due diligence into the subproject cycle; incorporate \nenvironmental mitigation measures into subproject design, construction, and operations; and \nprovide the Government and ADB with timely information on progress toward the expected \noutputs.  A  civil  engineer/environmental  specialist  will  serve  as  a  full-time  PIU  staff,  with \nresponsibility for (i) overseeing the development of environmental items in the selection criteria \nfor subprojects; (ii) assisting in civil works survey concerning environmental issues, including \ninitial quality testing of  drinking water  source before  involvement of SES; (iii) participating in \nselecting subprojects; (iv) liaising with MOH on subproject environmental classification; (v) \nestablishing contact with local key stakeholders; (vi) overseeing the development of IEEs by \nselected design institutes according to Government and ADB guidelines; (vii) submitting IEEs \nfor approval to MOH and ADB as necessary; (viii) overseeing the preparation of EMPs by \ndesign institutes at the subproject design stage; (ix) submitting for approval to MOH and MOE \nand ADB, as necessary; (x) administering monitoring surveys during the construction phase and \naudits after the completion of construction; and (xi) developing reports on the implementation of \nthe project-specific EMPs on a semiannual basis, reporting to ADB, and informing the project \nsteering committee.  \n \n19.  On the Government side, MEP (through local environmental protection committees), will \nbe  responsible  for  (i)  environmental  clearance  of  physical  investments;  (ii)  environmental \ncompliance monitoring during construction; and (iii) routine environmental monitoring. SES (at \nprovince and district levels) will be responsible for (i) testing and approving water supplies; (ii) \nroutine water quality monitoring; (iii) aspects of public health education and awareness; and (iv) \npublic health monitoring. The Government will ensure that SES carries out tests for drinking \nwater quality, bacteriological analysis, and conventional pollutants according to their mandate, \nand as part of project counterpart contribution.  \n \nE.  Conclusions \n \n20.  The screening process carried out in this SIEE has not identified any significant negative \nenvironmental impacts likely to be caused by the Project. The HSRP will promote enhanced \nquality of living in rural communities and reduce poverty through access to improved health and \neducation and improved environmental management of clinics and hospitals. Therefore it will \nhave major positive environmental impacts. The HSRP will improve drinking water supplies; and \nintroduce appropriate medical waste management, adequate wastewater treatment, and safe \ndrug and reagent management. These measures will have a significant positive effect on public \nhealth.  \n  \n \n ", "  Appendix 17  55 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY FORM  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty \nanalysis?  Yes  partnership agreement?  Yes \n \nContribution of the health sector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \n \n1.           Investment in the health sector, in particular in primary health care (PHC) will help reduce the burden of \ndiseases among the poor. The poor will benefit from productivity gains from improved health status and resource cost \nsavings.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis       Proposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention \n2.      The Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP) has national level components and a pilot district component. At \nthe national level, the HSRP will help the Ministry of Health develop the heath service system that responds to the \nneeds of the poor and the vulnerable. The system will also reduce barriers to access to services. The HSRP will \ndesign the health management information system framework that will monitor use of services among the poor and \nthe vulnerable.  \n \n3.          The district component will improve the health status of the poor, women, and children in five districts that are \npoor and with high maternal and infant mortality rates. The pilot districts represent 5.5% of the population of 6.3 \nmillion. The HSRP will strengthen PHC, deliver a pro-poor health service package, and establish the family group \npractice (FGP).   \n \n4.         PHC is an internationally proven best practice to meet the needs of the poor and vulnerable groups, especially \nwomen and children. The pro-poor service package is designed to cover ill conditions that are closely related to \npoverty. The FGP system serves the poor, women and children better than other types of services such as hospitals. \nThe FGP system has incentives for family doctors and nurses to see the poor and vulnerable through capitation \npayment weighted with the poverty rate and performance-based contracts.       \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis?  Yes \n \n5.  The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) team carried out a multilevel consultation process with a \nwide range of stakeholders. Information on health-seeking behavior among service users was obtained through \ninterviews, focus group discussions and literatures. Health service providers often expressed dissatisfaction with \nhuman resource issues and working environment. They include poor salary level, lack of training opportunities, lack of \nreference material, lack of drugs and equipment, and poor conditions of facilities. The TA team closely consulted \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), aid agencies, and national and local policymakers and decision makers in \ndesigning the project activities.  \n \nParticipation strategy? Yes \n \n6.       Stakeholders\u2019 perception of access to and quality of health services was considered in designing the HSRP \nscope and detailed activities. Community  participation will be supported as part of a public information campaign \nunder the HSRP. Community participation will be used as well in monitoring access to health care services.   \n \nD.         Gender and Development \n \n7.  Strategy to maximize impacts on women: HSRP\u2019s strategies to maximize the impacts on women follow. (i) \nThe pro-poor health service package offer services in family planning, antenatal care and safe motherhood, (ii) the \ncapitation payment rate will be set higher for women of reproductive age, (iii) the performance based contract will \nspecify the need for facility based and outreach services for women of reproductive age, and (iv) data of the project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system be gender disaggregated.    \n \n8.  Special attention will be given to (i) ensuring no gender bias in the health staff training opportunities; \n(ii) the use of  the local women's network in the community awareness and public campaign on health \nservices. \n \nGender plan prepared?  No. The above strategies are well reflected in the HSRP, no special gender plan is required. \n ", "56  Appendix 17 \n \nE.

Economic benefits potentially include social returns from the investment through (i) \nproductivity gains from the improved health status of intended beneficiaries, and (ii) resource \ncost savings. The Health Sector Reform Project (HSRP) will improve the internal efficiency of \nthe health system and increase  the use of quality primary health care (PHC). PHC is cost-\neffective for decreasing maternal mortality ratio (MMR), infant mortality rate (IMR), and general \nmorbidity. The HSRP will increase the number of persons receiving quality health care and will \ncontribute to raising the productivity of the target beneficiaries. Where possible, the expected \neffects have been summarized in monetary terms as either resource cost savings or increased \nproductivity. These benefits exclude externalities that accrue to the Project.   \n \n2.  Productivity gains due to reduction in days lost because of illness are expected to accrue \nfrom HSRP interventions. Increased access to quality care will lead to improved in health status \nthat will lead to longer healthy life years, that, in turn, will lead to increases in productivity. \nReduction in morbidity and mortality will translate into productivity gains. Through system \nreforms, the entire country is envisioned to benefit from the HSRP, particularly as institutional \ncapacity at the central level permeates the health system.   \n \n3.  Resource cost savings include  reduction in out-of-pocket health expenditures and in \nexpenditures on drugs in the pilot areas. By introducing a free pro-poor health package at HSRP \ndistricts, the basic health needs of the target population will be addressed. The package will be \ndelivered efficiently. The services will be provided  through the family group practice (FGP) \nsystem, which serves the poor and the vulnerable better than  other types of service. The \nbeneficiaries  will  receive  better  quality  health  care  at  reduced  costs.  The  pharmaceutical \nsupport under the HSRP will constitute a substantial economic benefit itself, given the current \nlevel of out-of-pocket expenditure on drugs. Patients are currently purchasing drugs of unknown \nquality\u2014which are often counterfeit, or low quality\u2014in an unregulated environment. By receiving \nquality drugs dispensed free in the HSRP, cost savings will accrue to intended beneficiaries. \n \n4.  These measurable economic benefits are  linked to the final health outcomes of  the \nHSRP. Intermediate benefits  likewise result from developing  capacity and rationalizing the \nsystem. An effective health system delivering equitable and quality health care will  improve \nhealth outcomes. Human capital development is an economic benefit creating the potential for \nyielding sustainable synergies through the proposed system reforms. For estimation purposes, \nthe economic analysis assumes that human capital in the health sector will generate increasing \nreturns as economic gains that will accrue to the pilot areas and to the entire country. \n \n1.  Key Assumptions \n \n5.  By 2008, the HSRP targets are (i) reducing IMR, MMR, and under-5 mortality by 30%; \n(ii) reducing the number of deliveries without assistance; (iii) reducing children\u2019s respiratory \ninfection and diarrhea; (iv) improving maternal and child health by at preventing at least 200 \ndeaths; and (v)  increasing  allocation  for PHC. The economic benefits of the  HSRP were \nquantified based on varying assumptions. Table A18.1 presents the key benefit assumptions \nand corresponding economic rate of return and net present value (NPV) of the HSRP. \n                                                 \n \n    \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 18 \nTable A18.1: Economic Benefits, EIRR, and NPV \n \nReduction in Productivity Losses                  Base Data \n   \nPopulation of Tajikistan  6,200,000 \nPopulation in the Pilot Areas  350,000 \nGDP ($ billion)   1 \nProductivity Loss (% GDP)  9 \nProductivity Loss Whole Country ($)  90,000,000 \nProductivity Loss in Pilot Areas (n $)  5,080,645 \nReduction in Productivity Loss in Pilot Areas  10 \nTotal Annual Reduction of Loss in Pilot Areas ($) (A)  508,065 \nReduction in Productivity Loss for the Rest of the Country (%)  0.5 \nTotal Annual Reduction of Loss for the Rest of the Country ($) (B)  450,000 \nTotal Annual Reduction in Productivity Loss (Pilot + rest of the country) (A + B)   958,065 \n   \nReduction in Out-of-Pocket Health Expenditure (formal and informal payments)   \n   \nOut-of-Pocket Health Expenditure ($ per capita per year)  2 \nTotal Out-of-Pocket Annual Expenditure in Pilot Areas ($)  700,000 \nReduction in Annual Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (%)  15 \nTotal Annual Reduction in Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (pilot areas)  105,000 \nTotal Out-of-Pocket Annual Expenditure in the Whole Country Minus Pilot Areas ($)  11,700,000 \nReduction in Annual Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (%)  8 \nTotal Annual Reduction in Out-of-Pocket Expenditure for Whole Country ($)  936,000 \n   \nReduction in expenditure with drugs in pilot areas    \n   \nPercentage of Out-of-Pocket Expenditure Spent on Drugs (%)  50 \nOut-of-Pocket Expenditure with Drugs ($ per capita per year)  1 \nTotal Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (Drugs) in Pilot Areas ($)  350,000 \nPercentage of Yearly Savings Due to the Distribution of Drugs Free of Charge in Pilot Areas (%)  65 \nTotal Drugs Benefit  in the Pilot Areas ($)  227,500 \n  Total Economic Benefits ($)  2,226,565 \nEIRR (%)  24.1 \nNPV ($)  3,828,079 \nEIRR = economic rate of return; GDP = gross domestic product; NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  The 1998 Viet Nam Living Standards Survey shows that the economic cost of working \ndays lost due to sickness is about 8.7% of gross domestic product (GDP). The International \nLabour Organization (ILO) report1 published in April 2003 gives the figure for Latin America as \n10%, assuming that this is the general condition  in developing countries. Based on these \nreports, the total reduction in productivity loss under the HSRP is estimated at 9% of GDP (10% \nin pilot areas and 0.5% in the whole country). HSRP\u2019s pro-poor health package component aims \nto have a 15% reduction in the out-of-pocket health expenditures of target beneficiaries in the \npilot districts. It is estimated that the out-of-pocket expenditure averages about $2 per capita.2 \nAlthough  the  component  targets  25%  reduction  in  out-of-pocket expenditure, this analysis \n                                                 \n1 International Labour Organization, 2003. Safety in Numbers \n2 Tajikistan Living Standards Survey, 1998. \n ", "  Appendix 18  59 \nconsiders the reduction to be 15%. These conservative estimates are justified since informal \nfees and formal copayment are existent in Tajikistan. It is estimated that decreases in out-of-\npocket  expenditure  in  the  whole  country  would  be  8%.  Under  the  HSRP,  a  reduction  in \nexpenditure on drugs is assumed to be 65% of out-of-pocket expenditures. This is based on the \nassumption that about 50% out-of-pocket health expenditure is spent on pharmaceuticals.  \n \n2.  Economic Rates of Return and Net Present Value \n \n7.  Even with these relatively conservative assumptions, the HSRP yields a return of 24.1%. \nThese benefits exclude externalities that accrue to the HSRP. Table A18.2 shows the estimated \neconomic internal rate of return for the HSRP.  The analysis covers 20 years (2003-2023) and \nwas carried out in constant 2002 prices, with domestic prices used as numeraire.  Economic \ncosts were calculated based on the annual project cost disbursements.  Incremental recurrent \ncosts were estimated at about 5% of capital costs. Tradable goods of capital and operation and \nmaintenance costs were adjusted by a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.20.3 Tradable \ngoods are about 50% of project costs. At a discount rate of 12%, NPV is $3,828,079. The \nanalysis indicates that the main factors influencing the economic returns include the reduction in \nproductivity  loss  and  the  reduction  in  out-of-pocket  expenditures  estimated  for  the  whole \ncountry. This means that the extension of the benefits nationwide will be crucial in guaranteeing \nthat the investments will yield acceptable returns. While focusing on the pilot areas, it is \nnecessary to consider the systemic gains from the pharmaceutical reforms and capacity building \nat the central level. \n \nB.   Financial Sustainability and Fiscal Impact \n \n8.  The total financial cost of the  HSRP is $9.375 million for 5 years.  About 80% of  the \nHSRP will be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the rest by the Government. \nA financial sustainability analysis was done to evaluate  HSRP\u2019s impact on the Government \nbudget under the following assumptions: (i) health expenditure will be maintained at over 1% of \nGDP and 5% of state expenditure throughout the project period; and (ii) incremental recurrent \ncosts after the Project will be maintained at minimal levels and increases  will be contained \nthrough allocation of existing resources. The Government\u2019s annual share in project costs will \naverage around $0.38 million, or about 0.36% of the average annual health budget (projected) \nof about $13.5 million. The recurrent costs borne by the Government during  the HSRP are \nestimated to be about $0.18 million per year and include (i)  operating expenses for project \nmanagement, and (ii) operation and maintenance of renovated health facilities and equipment. \nAssuming the health spending is maintained, the budgetary impact of the estimated annual \nrecurrent costs during and after project implementation is considered minimal.  \n \n9.  In the health sector, humanitarian agencies finance more than 30% of the total health \nexpenditures. Users finance about 30%, while the Government covers about 26%. Development \nbanks average 7%. Humanitarian agencies are withdrawing, but the probability of development \nagencies' support is mixed. ADB has dropped loans for social sectors from the country program \nof 2004-2006. The World Bank's health project is planned for 2006. Bilateral sources have not \nfirmly committed yet, although $900 million, including a $700 million grant, was pledged at the \nConsultative  Group  meeting  in  May  2003.  Significant  deterioration  may  happen  to  health \nexpenditure over the years. It is critical to keep updating the full picture of all financing sources \nto capture overall budgetary implications.  \n                                                 \n3 Based on Asian Development Bank\u2019s guidelines. \n ", " \n6\nTable A18.2:    Economic Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value  0\n \n \nYear  Economic Costs  Economic Benefits   \nA\n  Capital  Incremental  Incremental  Incremental  Cost  Cost Savings  Cost Savings  Total   Net  pp\nCosts  Recurrent   Benefits  Benefits  Savings   (Project: lower  (country, lower  Benefits  Benefits  e\nn\nCosts  (productivity-  (productivity- (pilot free  formal and  formal and  d\npilot)  country)  drugs)  informal  informal  ix 1\npayments)   payments)  8\n \n                   \n2003  848,100  15,435   203,226  0.00  227,500.00  52,500.00                        0.00  483,225.81  -380,310 \n2004  1,696,200  46,306   304,839     0.00  227,500.00  84,000.00                        0.00  616,338.71 -1,126,168 \n2005  2,120,250       88,711   406,452  45,000  227,500.00  105,000.00               93,600.00  877,551.61 -1,331,410 \n2006  2,544,300  139,597   508,065  135,000  227,500.00  105,000.00  280,800.00  1,256,364.52 -1,427,533 \n2007  1,272,150  165,040   508,065  225,000  227,500.00  105,000.00  468,000.00  1,533,564.52  96,394 \n2008  0.00  165,040   508,065  315,000  0.00  105,000.00  655,200.00  1,583,264.52 1,418,224 \n2009  0.00  165,040   508,065  360,000  0.00  105,000.00  748,800.00  1,721,864.52 1,556,824 \n2010  0.00  165,040   508,065  405,000  0.00  105,000.00  842,400.00  1,860,464.52 1,695,424 \n2011  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2012  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2013  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2014  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2015  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2016  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2017  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2018  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2019  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2020  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2021  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2022  0.00  165,040   508,065  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n2023  0.00  165,040   508,064.52  450,000  0.00  105,000.00  936,000.00  1,999,064.52 1,834,024 \n \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return = 24.1%  \nNet Present Value (12% discount rate) = $3,828,079 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R261-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20031129132313Z", "Title": "R261-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040210155024+08'00'"}, "author_page": " \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n(ii) In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  This report was prepared by a team consisting of T.
