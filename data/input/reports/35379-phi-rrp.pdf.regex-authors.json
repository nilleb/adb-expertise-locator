The Project will consist of consulting services for (i) \nthe preparation of feasibility and other studies required to prepare \nnew water source projects, and (ii) capacity building for MWSS in \nthe field of financial management.  \nRationale  Six  years  after  two  private  concessionaires,  Manila  Water \nCompany Inc. (MWCI) and Maynilad Water Services Inc. (MWSI) \ntook over operations from MWSS, water supply continues to be a \nmajor  concern  in  the  Metro  Manila  area.  Nonrevenue  water \nremains high, and some areas experience water shortages, low \nwater pressure, and interrupted supply. By the end of 2002, MWCI \nand MWSI provided about 82% of the population in the MWSS \nservice  area  with  water.  However,  existing  water  sources  can \nbarely  meet  current  demand,  let  alone  connect  additional \ncustomers,  requiring  the  development  of  new  water  sources. \nWater provided from the additional sources will not only ensure \nimproved and sustainable service delivery for existing customers, \nbut also enable extension of service coverage, particularly for the \nurban poor. MWSS has identified three potential water source \nprojects  requiring  comprehensive  consulting  services  including \npreparation of feasibility studies and provision of high-level advice \non legal and financial issues. The TA loan will provide MWSS with \na  facility  to  complete  project  preparation  in  time,  ensuring \nappropriate  quality.  The  envisaged  projects  will  also  generate \npotential business opportunities for the private sector in water \nsource development. \nObjectives and Scope  The objective of the Project is to provide consulting services to (i) \nprepare and design projects for the development of new water \nsources for Metro Manila suitable for financing from ADB, the \nprivate sector, or other sources, and (ii) improve MWSS\u2019 capacity \nfor  financial  management,  accounting,  and  fiscal  control.  The \nresulting water source projects will improve the living conditions \nand health of the population in Metro Manila through providing \nsafe water, and will facilitate the expansion of the service area, \nparticularly to the urban poor. Projects will also generate business \nopportunities for the private sector in water source development. \nThe  Project  consists  of  consulting  services  for  Part  A\u2014\nDevelopment of New Water Source Projects, and for Part B\u2014", "  iii \nDevelopment of New Water Source Projects, and for Part B\u2014\nCapacity Building. Part A will include (i) feasibility study for the \nWawa River Project; (ii) feasibility study, detailed design, and \ntender documents for the Angat Water Utilization and Aqueduct \nImprovement Project; and (iii) studies, including a resettlement \nplan,  a  review  of  existing  design  and  tender  documents,  and \nfinancing arrangements, for the Laiban Dam Project. All three \nprojects will address environmental, poverty, social analysis, and \nsocial safeguards concerns as required by ADB guidelines. Part B \nwill include capacity building to strengthen financial management \nof MWSS, and will comprise training and preparation of manuals \nand  guidelines  for  (i)  management  accounting;  (ii)  corporate \nplanning,  budgeting,  and  budgetary  control;  (iii)  financial \naccounting; (iv) internal control and audit systems; and (v) data \nprocessing. \nCost Estimates  Total  Project  cost  is  estimated  at  $4.97  million  equivalent,  of \nwhich $1.30 million is the foreign exchange cost (26%), and $3.67 \nmillion equivalent (74%) is the local currency cost. \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \nloan of  $3.26 million or 66% of the project cost, to cover the entire \nforeign exchange cost and $1.96 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs. MWSS will finance the remaining local cost of \n$1.71  million  equivalent.  The  Republic  of  the  Philippines  will \nguarantee the performance of MWSS' obligations under the Loan \nAgreement. \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $3.26 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 10-year term \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a front-end \nfee of 0.5%, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in \nthe Loan Agreement. \nPeriod of Utilization   Until 30 June 2007 \nEstimated Project  31 December 2006 \nCompletion Date \nImplementation  An inter-agency steering committee (IASC) composed of MWSS \nArrangements  and the concessionaires was formed in March 2001 to prioritize \nand supervise development of new water source projects. The \nIASC will be responsible for guidance, monitoring, and supervising \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  MWSS  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency and will implement the Project over 3 years through the \nexisting project management office.  \nExecuting Agency  MWSS ", "iv \nConsulting Services  Consultants  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, \nincluding the use of the quality- and cost-based selection method \nfor consulting firms and arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Approximately  438.5 \nperson-months of consulting services will be required, comprising \napproximately  36.5  person-months  of  international  and  402 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. \nProject Benefits and  The TA loan will enable preparation of new water source projects \nBeneficiaries  for Metro Manila resulting in improved living conditions and health \nof the population through provision of safe water and expansion of \nthe  service  area,  particularly  benefiting  the  urban  poor.  The \nProject will also generate business opportunities for private sector \nparticipation in water source development through a transparent \nand competitive process, thus producing greater efficiencies and \nbetter services to the consumer.  \n ", "v\n120oE 128oE 121o40'E UMIRAY\nLUZON PHILIPPINES Polillo\n16oN MANILA ProjectArea 16oN MDWESVSENLOEWPMWEANTTEPRRSOOJUERCCTE reviimrRya IdlangC Strait\nU M reek\nar\nana\ngul\nVISAYAS Cre\nInamina ek\nCreek\n8oN MINDANAO8oN Mt.Sumag Oyongan River\n15o50'N 15o50'N\nBULACAN\ner\n120oE 128oE wayiRv\nTRANSBASIN uili\n121o00'E TUNNEL B\nBaliwag\nSanRafael SumagR.\nBustos UMIRAY\nANGATRESERVOIR DIVERSIONSITES\nAngat\nMt.Mabitoan R.\nAngatRiver ANGATDAM Ravitan\nPlaridel IPO-BICTITUNNELS IPODAM QUEZON\nBICTI-LAMESA\nAQUEDUCTS BictiBasin\nBalagtas SanJose\nBuBlaoccaanue UIATMINALPGQIRZAUOATETVDIWEOUMANCTEATENDNRTeDlMonte TangaRiver PuraRiver Montalban Rirve Mt.Calangdang\nPROJECT N\nLAMESA\nMarilao LAMESA RESERVOIR WAWADAM\nTREATMENT\nPLANTS Rodriguez 0 5 10\nMeycauayan\nObando\nTullahanRiver naR SanMateo Kilometers\nMariki RIZAL\nMNaalavobtoans VCaalelonozcuaQenluaezonCity BTPRALAELANARTTMSAENT BosoBosoR Bosoboso LAIBANDAM\nMarikina iver\nSanJuan\nMANILA\nAntipolo\nMandaluyong\nManila Bay MPaaksaitgiRiver Pasig Taytay\nAngono\nPasay\nNationalCapital\nPateros\nBaras City/Town\nMorong\nTanay Tunnel/Aqueduct\n14o30'N Taguig Road 14o30'N\nPara\u00f1aque Pililla\nRiver\nProvincialBoundary\nLasPi\u00f1as\nBacoor Binangonan Boundariesarenotnecessarily\nLaguna\nde authoritative.\nBay\n121o00'E 121o40'E\n03-1181RM", " \n \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), \nguaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines, for the MWSS New Water Source Development \nProject.  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider a TA loan \n(the Project) to finance the preparation of new water source development projects required to \nmeet future water demand in Metro Manila. Following the request, the Loan Processing Mission \nwas fielded from 15 October to 16 November 2001. The Mission met with officials of MWSS and \nits two concessionaires, Manila Water Company, Inc. (MWCI) and Maynilad Water Services, Inc. \n(MWSI),  and  the  representatives  of  the  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority, \nDepartment of Finance, and Commission on Audit. After extended discussions, an agreement \nwith MWSS and the Government was reached in December 2002 on the scope, costs, financing, \nand implementation arrangements for the Project. The project framework is attached in Appendix \n1. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Water Supply Coverage and Service Levels \n \n3.  As of the end of 2000, as reported in the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan \n(MTPDP) 2001\u20132004,1 access to public water supply systems had increased from about 60% in \n1985  to  about  80%  of  the  total  population  in  the  Philippines.  According  to  MWSS,  its \nconcessionaires MWCI and MWSI served about 76% of the population living within the MWSS \nservice area at that time. This contrasted with urban areas outside of Metro Manila, where 88% \nof the population had access to safe drinking water through systems provided by the Local Water \nUtilities Administration (LWUA), local government units (LGUs), and the private sector. By the \nend of 2002, the share  of  population  served  in  Metro  Manila  by  the  concessionaires  had \nincreased to 82%.  \n4.  Significant improvement in terms of coverage cannot be expected in the coming years, \nand it is unlikely that the MTPDP 2004 target of providing 90.5% of the population with access to \nsafe drinking water will be met. In the MWSS service area the concessionaires lack sufficient \nwater supply to expand their systems. For urban areas outside MWSS' reach the situation is \neven more difficult. Only 150 of 560 water districts have been able to avail of financing from \nLWUA, and there is little likelihood of this increasing unless the performance of LWUA is \nimproved.  \n5.  Even though levels of service generally have been improved in terms of expanded \ncoverage, system  reliability  and  capacity  are  frequently  inadequate,  and  illegal  tapping  is \ncommon. Inadequate supply is usually manifested by low pressure in the distribution system \nduring peak hours of use. Consequently, suppressed demand for water that makes it difficult to \nassess the real demand and to prepare adequate forecasts of demand and of willingness to pay. \n                                                 \n1 \nNational Economic Development Authority. 2001 Draft Medium Term Philippine Development Plan. ", " 2  \n6.  In 2002, nonrevenue water2 (NRW) in Metro Manila was about 60% on average, with \n69% within the service area of MWSI and 53% in the service area of MWCI.3  While water \nsupplied in Metro Manila and in most water districts is generally disinfected with chlorine, water is \noften supplied without treatment and is of dubious quality in a number of areas. An analysis of \nthe sector is presented in Appendix 2. \n2.  Lessons Learned \n7.  The key lessons learned based on experience with project implementation relate to \nsystemic weaknesses in the sector in three areas. The first is the inability of institutions to \ndevelop new projects and to maintain existing water supply networks and thus to respond to \nrapidly increasing demand. Related issues are the lack of readiness for project implementation \nand the lack of transparency and accountability of the agencies involved. There is a need to \nsupport the development of new projects and to address the issue of NRW, as provided under \nthe Project. New high priority projects must be prepared based on concerted, well-resourced \nefforts, linked to adequate funding of the resulting investment. \n3.  External Assistance \n8.  Multilateral and bilateral agencies have given considerable support for the urban sector \nand for the WSS sector in the Philippines. Since 1974, ADB has played a major role by providing \n19  loans  to  the  WSS  sector  amounting  to  approximately  $728  million,  and  27  technical \nassistance grants totaling $12.41 million. Projects for MWSS financed by ADB include 8 loans for \nwater supply and 1 for sewerage. In addition to ADB, the major providers of official external \nassistance are the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the World Bank. Others include \nthe  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency,  European  Union,  France,  Germany  (Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau), Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nNew Zealand, United Kingdom Department for International Development, United Nations, and \nthe United States Agency for International Development. A summary of external assistance to \nthe sector is presented in Appendix 3.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.  The development of water supply systems is financed by a combination of government \nsubsidies, internal cash generation of supply systems, foreign grant and loan assistance, and \nlocal government contributions. In the past, the main source of funding for water supply was the \ncentral  Government  assisted  by  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies.  With  the  Government\u2019s \nprivatization thrust, private capital is also seen to help finance projects in the sector, as in the \ncase of the MWSS service area. \n10.  Outside the MWSS service area, in systems managed by the water districts, internal cash \ngeneration has not been a reliable source for financing water system improvements. Tariffs are \noften set below levels required for full cost recovery. Funds for capital investment are usually \nprovided through the following sources: (i) LWUA; (ii) LGUs; and (iii) loans from the Development \nBank of the Philippines, and Land Bank of the Philippines. There are also cases where funds are \nprovided directly through congressional allocations. Tariffs of water supply systems operated by \nLGUs often do not cover operation and maintenance costs, and LGUs have to provide subsidies \nto keep systems operating. LGUs fully subsidize loan repayment in many cases, and water \ndistricts often face political resistance when they try to raise water tariffs. \n                                                 \n2 \nNRW is composed of (i) physical losses caused by leakages; and (ii) commercial losses resulting from illegal \n \nconnections, meter under registration, and billing inefficiencies.\n3   \nSource: MWSS.", "  3\n11.  Six years after the concessionaires took over operations from MWSS, water supply \ncontinues  to  be  a  major  concern  in  the  Metro  Manila  area.  By  the  end  of  2002,  the \nconcessionaires provided about 82% of the total population within the MWSS service area with \nwater. NRW remained very high at about 60% on average, and some areas still experience \nwater shortages, low water pressure, and interrupted supply. At present, MWSS provides about \n4,000 million liters per day (MLD) of water from the Angat Reservoir to the concessionaires for \ndistribution to the population and to industry.4 However, these water sources can barely meet \ncurrent demand, let alone connect to additional customers.5 Therefore, the development of new \nwater sources is urgently required. Water provided from these additional sources will ensure \nimproved and sustainable service delivery for existing customers and enable extension of service \ncoverage, particularly to the urban poor.  \n12.  Access to clean drinking water is essential for reducing urban poverty and to improve the \neconomic status of the urban poor, who often have to rely on water supplied by vendors at high \ncost, and suffer from ill health resulting from inadequate access to clean water. Clean drinking \nwater provides important social development and economic returns through reducing the burden \nof poverty, particularly on women, and through reducing water-borne diseases. The Project aims \nat  increasing  access  to  adequate  water  supply  for  the  poor,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \noperational  strategy  in  the  Philippines,  which  emphasizes  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment through promoting equitable growth, improving basic social services, and improving \nmanagement and protection of the environment.  \n13.  To meet future demand the Project will finance preparation of new water source projects.6 \nThe assistance will incorporate key lessons learned from previous projects and will provide well-\nresourced, focused assistance for the preparation of high priority projects based on a least-cost \napproach. The Project will help to facilitate potential financing of subsequent investments by \nADB,  the  private  sector,  and  other  sources,  and  will  contribute  to  improving  financial  and \nadministrative systems of MWSS. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n14.  The objective of the Project is to provide consulting services to (i) prepare and design \nprojects for the development of new water sources for Metro Manila suitable for financing from \nADB,  the  private  sector,  or  other  sources,  and  (ii)  improve  MWSS\u2019  capacity  for  financial \nmanagement, accounting, and fiscal control. The resulting water source projects will improve the \nliving conditions and health of the population in Metro Manila through providing safe water and \nwill facilitate the expansion of the service area, particularly to the urban poor. Projects will also \ngenerate business opportunities for the private sector in water source development.  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n15.  The Project consists of consulting services for Part A\u2014Development of New Water \nSource Projects, and for Part B\u2014Capacity Building.  \n                                                 \n4 \nMWSS' responsibilities include facilitating the provision of bulk water to the concessionaires; a detailed description \nof MWSS is included in Appendix 4. \n5 \nAccording to MWSS, without the development of new water sources the projected supply of water would fall short of \n \ndemand by about 200 MLD in 2006.\n6 \nAdditional assistance to investigate long-term water supply is being provided by the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency to the National Water Resources Board through The Study on Water Resources Development for Metro \n \nManila.", " 4  \n1.  Part A\u2014Development of New Water Source Projects  \n16.  Part A will include three components: (i) a feasibility study for the Wawa River Project; (ii) \na feasibility study, detailed design, and tender documents for the Angat Water Utilization and \nAqueduct Improvement Project (AWUAIP); and (iii) studies, including a resettlement plan, review \nof existing design and tender documents, preliminary design for a transmission pipeline, and \nfinancing arrangements, for the Laiban Dam Project. Detailed terms of reference (TOR) for a \nfeasibility study for the Wawa River component are attached in Appendix 5. Descriptions of \ncomponents  (ii)  and  (iii)  are  included  in  Appendix  6.  Detailed  TOR  for  the  water  source \ndevelopment components (ii) and (iii) will be prepared by the Executing Agency during project \nimplementation, to be approved by the ADB.  \n(i)  Part A.1\u2014Wawa River Project: The Wawa Dam, located on the river of the same \nname, which forms part of the Marikina River, was constructed in 1906 and was in \nuse as a water source for some decades. But water source facilities at the dam \nwere abandoned a long time ago. To restart operations, the dam and associated \ninfrastructure need major refurbishing. The envisaged investment project resulting \nfrom the TA Loan will comprise the renovation of the dam including the water \nintake, removal of silt from the reservoir, and construction of a new transmission \npipeline and of a water treatment plant to deliver 50 MLD of water. The water \ntreatment plant will be located close to the dam on a site already owned by \nMWSS,  which  also  has  the  right  of  way  for  the  new  pipeline.  The  plant\u2019s \nmechanical and electrical equipment has already been provided under a French \nsoft loan (French Protocol) about 6 years ago and was intended to treat water \nfrom Laguna Lake. However, because of technical and environmental concerns \nthe project at Laguna Lake has been deferred, and the equipment has been kept \nstored in a warehouse since then. Water supplied from the Wawa Dam will be \nprovided to settlements in Rodriguez and San Mateo, which are currently serviced \nby MWCI through deep wells and surface water from Balara. The growing demand \nin these areas, particularly for the urban poor, cannot be met through these \nsources alone, and the deep wells are costly to operate. Investment costs are \nestimated at about $13.5 million. In order to develop the project, a feasibility study \nfinanced under the TA Loan will be prepared. Project development will include the \npreparation of preliminary land acquisition and resettlement plans (PLARPs) and \nplans for the relocation of a small community of informal settlers along the route of \nthe pipeline and near the proposed site for the water treatment plant, as well as \nthe  preparation  of  the  necessary  environmental  impact  assessments  and \ncompliance reports. Total costs for the study are estimated at $309,000, of which \nADB will finance $213,000.  \n(ii)  Part A.2\u2014Angat Water Utilization and Aqueduct Improvement Project:   The \nAngat Reservoir, complemented by water diverted from the Umiray river basin, is \nthe main water source for Metro Manila and provides about 4,000 MLD water or \n97% of total water production. The reservoir is used for water supply, irrigation, \nand  hydropower  generation.  Current  water  right  allocation  from  the  Angat \nreservoir provides for water supply of 1,900 MLD, complemented by 1,300 MLD \nset aside for irrigation. In addition, another 780 MLD is diverted from the Umiray \nRiver  into  the  Angat  Reservoir  for  water  supply  purposes.  MWSS  plans  to \nincrease its share of water from the Angat Reservoir through a reallocation of \nwater rights by converting an existing temporary allocation from the irrigation \nwater to a permanent allocation, and by obtaining additional water from irrigation \nfor water supply. A definitive ruling from the National Water Resources Board on ", "  5\nthis issue will be sought by MWSS. Water from the Angat Reservoir is transported \nthrough  a  system  of  tunnels  and  aqueducts  to  the  water  treatment  plants. \nHowever, recent surveys have revealed that aqueduct no. 5 (AQ5), which carries \nabout  2,000  MLD,  is  in  urgent  need  of  repair.  Leakage  of  this  aqueduct  is \nestimated at about 100 \u2013 150 MLD. In case it would break, about half of the total \nwater supply for Metro Manila would be at risk. MWSS and the concessionaires \nhave taken action to carry out emergency repairs, but there is an urgent need to \nbuild a new aqueduct (AQ6), to be constructed in two phases. Phase 1 (5.5 km \nlength) will serve as a by-pass while repairing the corresponding section of the \nexisting AQ5, and will be financed by the Government of the Philippines. Phase 2 \nentails  the  construction  of  the  remaining  section  (11.5  km  length)  of  AQ6. \nPreparation of a feasibility study, detailed design, and tender documents for \nPhase 2 will be financed under the Project. Costs of the resulting investment \nproject  are  currently  estimated  at  about  $90  million.  This  would  include \nconstruction of AQ6 and pumping stations; repair of the existing AQ5; and, if \nadditional water can be allocated, construction of additional transmission pipelines \nand an extension of water treatment plants. Project development for AWUAIP will \ninclude  preparation  of  (i)  a  feasibility  study,  inclusive  of  PLARP,  preliminary \ndesign, and, if required, a resettlement plan; and (ii) detailed design and tender \ndocuments. The cost of these activities is estimated at $2,100,000, of which ADB \nwill finance $1,428,000 under the Project. An indicative list of tasks and budget \nitems is set out in Appendix 6. The Executing Agency will prepare detailed TOR \nand budgets during project implementation for approval by ADB.  \n(iii)  Part A.3\u2013Laiban Dam Project: Preparation of the Laiban Dam Project started in \n1979. It is a project to deliver 1,900 MLD of high quality water to Metro Manila. \nEven though the construction of diversion tunnels had already been completed, \nfurther construction was suspended in 1989 for a number of reasons, including \nchanged priorities and emerging resettlement issues. Today, about 3,000 families \nhave settled on the dam site. Due to the growing need to secure long-term water \nsupply for Metro Manila, MWSS is considering reviving the project at an estimated \ncost of about $1.0 billion. Project preparation financed from the TA loan will \ninclude the preparation of a PLARP for the relocation and rehabilitation of about \n3,000  families,  financing  arrangements,  review  of  existing  design  and  tender \ndocuments,  preliminary  design  of  a  transmission  pipeline,  and  environmental \nimpact assessment. Total costs for the TA are estimated at $2,049,000, of which \nADB will finance $1,326,000. Detailed TOR and budgets will be prepared by the \nExecuting Agency during project implementation for approval by ADB. \n2.  Part B\u2014Capacity Building  \n17.  For the FY1999 and FY2000, COA rendered an adverse opinion on the fairness and \npresentation of the financial statements of MWSS. While MWSS, in discussion with ADB, has \nalready prepared and implemented an action plan to address COA\u2019s recommendations, Project \ncomponent  Part  B\u2014Capacity  Building  will  contribute  to  strengthening  MWSS\u2019  financial \nmanagement and internal control mechanisms. Part B comprises training and preparation of \nmanuals as well as guidelines for (i) management accounting; (ii) corporate planning, budgeting, \nand budgetary control; (iii) financial accounting; (iv) internal control and audit systems; and (v) \ndata processing. Total costs for this aspect of the TA are estimated at $215,000, which will be \nfinanced by MWSS if grant financing from a bilateral agency cannot be secured. Detailed TOR \nand budget are enclosed in Appendix 7. ", " 6  \nC.  Cost Estimates  \n18.  The total project cost is estimated at $4.97 million equivalent, of which $1.30 million is the \nforeign exchange cost (26%) and $3.67 million equivalent (74%) is local currency cost. Cost \nestimates are presented in Appendix 8 and summarized in Table 1. \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nComponent  Exchange  Currency  Cost   \nPart A:  Development of          \n  New Water Source Projects \nA.1: Wawa River Project  97  212  309  6 \nA.2: Angat Water Utilization and Aqueduct   308  1,792  2,100  42 \n  Improvement Project \nA.3: Laiban Dam Project  600  1,449  2,049  42 \nPart B: Capacity Building  0  215  215  4 \nPart C: Interest and Fees  293  0  293  6 \n  Total   1,298  3,668  4,966  100 \n  26%  74%  100%   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.         \nD.  Financing Plan \n19.  MWSS has requested a loan of $3.26 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp finance the Project. The loan will have a 10-year term including a grace period of 3 years, \nan interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a front-end fee of 0.5% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Republic of the \nPhilippines will provide a guarantee for the loan. No commitment fee will be charged for the TA \nloan. \n20.  Of the total project cost of $4.97 million, ADB will finance $3.26 million or 66%, including \nthe complete foreign exchange costs of $1.30 million and $1.96 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost.7 The remaining 34% of total project cost will be financed by MWSS in cash and \nkind including the cost of office accommodation, counterpart staff, incremental administration, \ntaxes, and duties. The Financing Plan is presented in Appendix 8 and summarized in Table 2. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost   \nAsian Development Bank   1,300  1,960  3,260  66% \nMWSS   -  1,710  1,710  34% \n    Total   1,300  3,670  4,970  100% \n  26%  74%  100%   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n7  The share of 66% ADB financing is within the limit of 70% ADB financing for TA projects in the Philippines. ", "  7\nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n21.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  MWSS  through  its  existing  project \nmanagement office (PMO), which was established to implement projects financed by ADB and \nother donors.8 MWSS is a Government- owned and -controlled corporation, created under \nRepublic Act No. 6234 on 19 June 1971. The enactment of Republic Act No. 8041, the National \nWater Crisis Act of 1995, resulted in a reorganization of MWSS. After Executive Order No. 311 \nwas issued on 20 March 1996, encouraging private sector participation (PSP) in the operations \nof MWSS, it entered into concession agreements with MWCI and MWSI on 21 February 1997. \nThe  former  manages  the  East  Zone  and  the  latter  the  West  Zone  of  Metro  Manila.  The \nconcession contracts commenced on 1 August 1997. A financial and institutional analysis of \nMWSS including financial projections is presented in Appendix 4. \n22.  An inter-agency steering committee (IASC) composed of MWSS and the concessionaires \nwas formed in March 2001 to prioritize and supervise development of new water source projects. \nThe IASC will be responsible for guiding, monitoring, and supervising implementation of the \nProject. The Project will be implemented by MWSS through the existing PMO, which is headed \nby  a  PMO  manager  and  comprises  staff  for  engineering,  project  management,  and \nadministration. Staff seconded from the concessionaires will complement the PMO based on \nexisting working arrangements for the implementation of ongoing MWSS-financed projects. \nHowever, involvement of concessionaire staff in the implementation of any part of the Project will \nbe subject to the condition that the seconding concessionaire and its affiliates and subsidiaries \nagree to refrain from bidding for the resulting water source project. \n23.  The PMO will be responsible for overall implementation of the Project based on ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and in accordance with other relevant ADB requirements, \npolicies,  and  guidelines.  Consultant  selection  will  follow  quality-  and-cost-based  selection \n(QCBS) procedures. Activities of the PMO will include (i) preparation of TOR and budget for each \nassignment, (ii) shortlisting of consultants, (iii) preparation of tender documentation, (iv) invitation \nto submit proposals, (v) evaluation of proposals, (vi) contracting of consultants, (vii) monitoring of \nconsultants\u2019 performance and output, (viii) preparation of withdrawal applications, (ix) payment of \nconsultants, and (x) reporting. MWSS will provide logistical support for the consultants, including \nadequately  furnished  office  space,  data  and  project  documentation,  and  access  to \ncommunication facilities. \n2.  Subproject Formulation and Approval \n24.  The detailed TOR for the feasibility study for Part A.1\u2014Wawa River Project and for Part \nB\u2014Capacity Building are attached in Appendix 5 and 7, respectively. The PMO will prepare \ndetailed  TOR  and  budget  for  each  of  the  other  components  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements, guidelines, and policies and will submit them to ADB for comment and approval \nprior to recruitment of consultants. Individual consultants and firms of consultants, as required, \nwill carry out studies and consulting services financed under the Project.  \n3.  Implementation Period \n25.  The Project will be implemented over a 3-year period. Implementation is planned to \ncommence in 2004 with recruitment of consultants for preparing the feasibility study for the \nWawa River Project, and for the Capacity Building component. Further activities will include \n                                                 \n8  See Appendix 3. ", " 8  \nstudies for the development of the AWUAIP, and for the Laiban Dam Project. An implementation \nschedule is attached in Appendix 9. \n4.  Consulting Services \n26.  Consultants  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, including the use of the QCBS method for consulting \nfirms, and, for domestic consultants, arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Approximately 438.5 \nperson-months of consulting services will be required, comprising approximately 36.5 person-\nmonths of international and 402 person-months of domestic consultants. Consulting firms that \nare affiliated with, or a subsidiary of, MWSS or the concessionaires will not be eligible to be \nengaged under the Project.  \n5.  Advance Recruitment Action \n27.  At  the  request  of  MWSS,  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  recruitment  of \nconsultants to address the urgency of developing the new water source projects. Advance \naction, which may take place prior to loan effectiveness, includes recruitment of international and \ndomestic  consultants,  up  to  but  not  including  contract  signing.  All  advance  recruitment  of \nconsultants will be carried out in conformity with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nMWSS was advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the \nProject. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n28.  The minimum withdrawal amount will be $100,000 equivalent in accordance with ADB \nprocedures. Any disbursement below that amount will be made through the imprest account or \nreimbursement procedures. An imprest account will be established at a bank to be agreed upon \nby MWSS and ADB to facilitate the timely release of loan funds. The initial amount to be \ndeposited in the imprest account will not exceed $320,000 equivalent. ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate \nadvances provided to the imprest account. The individual payments that may be reimbursed or \nliquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed $40,000 equivalent per payment. The \nimprest account and SOE procedure will be established and maintained in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, dated January 2001, and detailed arrangements between \nMWSS and ADB. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n29.  MWSS will assign a project manager within the existing PMO to be responsible for the \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  including  project  supervision,  monitoring,  accounting,  and \nreporting. MWSS through the PMO will (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project, and (ii) \nhave such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by auditors acceptable to \nADB and in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement and Guarantee Agreement \nand as specified in the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment \nProjects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. The imprest account and SOE records will \nalso be audited as part of the annual audit. MWSS will submit to ADB certified copies (in English) \nof such audited accounts and financial statements, and the related reports of the auditors, within \n9 months after the close of each financial year. The Project will be consistent with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines on the prevention of fraud and corruption. ADB\u2019s audit requirements have been \ndiscussed with MWSS and its auditor, and a full understanding of the loan covenant on audited \nstatements has been reached.  \n30.  The PMO, on behalf of MWSS, will submit to the ADB a quarterly progress report on \ncommitments and disbursements, local and foreign costs, implementation status of approved ", "  9\nsubprojects, problems encountered during the quarter under review, action taken or proposed to \nbe taken to remedy the problems, and the expected progress during the following quarter. \n8.  Project Review \n31.  Progress under the Project will be subject to a formal review every 6 months following \neffectivity to enable MWSS and the Government to make adjustments in the project design and \nthe implementation arrangements if needed. The review will cover in particular the status of \nsubproject preparation and implementation, the performance of consultants, and the possible \nreallocation of loan proceeds. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n1.  Poverty and Social Analysis \n32.  Water provided from the additional water sources developed under the Project will not \nonly ensure improved and sustainable service delivery for existing customers, but also enable \nextension  of  service  coverage,  particularly  for  the  urban  poor.  Both  concessionaires  have \nsuccessfully taken action to provide urban poor with equitable access to safe and reliable water \nsupply. By the end of 2002, MWSI had installed 63,730 connections for households of the urban \npoor under its Bayan Tubig (\u201cwater for the people\u201d) program.9 MWCI, in a similar approach, has \ndeveloped the Tubig Para sa Barangay (\u201cwater for the community\u201d) program under which several \npoor families can share the cost and use of a single water meter. By the end of 2002, about \n63,910 households have been connected under this program (footnote 9). The new water \nsources will not only improve the service quality of existing customers, but also facilitate the \nconnection of new customers, including poor households. Poverty and social analysis will be \nconducted as part of the feasibility studies financed under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Poverty and Social Analysis. The results of the analysis will be documented in the \nappropriate sections of the initial poverty and social analysis (IPSA) and, in greater detail, in the \npoverty and social analysis report (PSAR) for each of the water source projects developed under \nthe Project. The poverty impact ratio will be computed in the economic analysis carried out for \neach of the water source projects.  \n33.  Poverty and social analysis concerns to be discussed in the IPSA and the PSARs will \ninclude (i) an assessment of the poverty and social development impact of the Project on poor \nand vulnerable groups, including impacts on health, livelihood, and wealth; (ii) identification of \ngender concerns; (iii) preparation of design measures that will enhance the Project's contribution \nto poverty reduction and social development; and (iv) identification of participatory approaches to \nbe applied in the preparation and implementation of the new water source projects. A poverty \nand social analysis summary is attached in Appendix 10. \n2.  Financial Analysis \n34.  A  financial  analysis  was  carried  out  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank, \nincluding (i) evaluation of the financial performance of MWSS for the past 3 years (1999-2001) \nand  (ii)  preparation  of  financial  projections  for  the  duration  of  the  Project.  The  financial \nprojections are presented in Appendix 4 and indicate that MWSS will operate in a sustainable \nmanner and that the costs of the Project are affordable to the organization.  \n                                                 \n9  Figures provided by MWSS. ", " 10  \n35.  MWSS\u2019  single  major  source  of  revenue  comes  from  concession  fees  paid  by  the \nconcessionaires consisting of (i) MWSS current operating budget, (ii) debt service of existing \nloans, and (iii) counterpart funds for ongoing investment projects. Based on the projections, it is \nexpected that MWSS will have to pay P31.2 million for annual debt service for the TA loan from \n2007 to 2013, which will be covered through the concession fees, subject to tariff adjustments. \nThe TA loan will therefore have limited impact on the financial performance of MWSS. Based on \nan average billed water volume in 2002 of about 1,500 MLD, the required tariff adjustment in \n2007 will probably be in the range of about P0.06 per cubic meter.10 However, billed water \ndemand is expected to increase until 2007, thus reducing the required tariff adjustment. A \ndetailed financial and economic analysis will be carried out as part of the feasibility studies for \nthe new water source projects resulting from the TA loan. \n3.  Nonrevenue Water \n36.  ADB has been providing loan financing for water supply infrastructure in the MWSS \nservice area for about 30 years. While these projects supported major investment for NRW \nreduction including (i) water meter installation, (ii) replacement of valves and pipes, (iii) leak \ndetection and repair, (iv) reducing illegal connections, and (v) conducting training programs, \ntargets for NRW reduction have generally not been met. Following commencement of the \nconcessions in August 1997, NRW reduction is now the responsibility of the concessionaires, \nwho  are  implementing  the  ongoing  MWSS  projects  as  well  as  their  own  NRW  reduction \nprograms.  \n37.  Despite considerable efforts and the involvement of experienced operators the level of \nNRW is still high at about 60% in 2002. It appears that targets set in previous projects for NRW \nreduction have been too ambitious and could not be met due to the complexity of the issues \ninvolved. For example, improving service quality, including 24-hour water supply in most of the \nservice area and higher network pressure, has to some extent contributed to the continued high \nlevel of NRW through increasing water losses from the deteriorating network. NRW reduction will \nbe a long-term effort requiring further massive investment in network rehabilitation, which can be \nfinanced only through appropriate water tariffs. In addition to reducing losses caused by leakage, \ncontinuous  efforts  will  be  required  to  reduce  commercial  losses  as  well,  including  illegal \nconnections  (footnote  2).  While  the  main  responsibility  for  NRW  reduction  rests  with  the \nconcessionaires, feasibility studies financed under the Project will address NRW by reviewing \nprograms  for  its  reduction  and  assessing  impacts  on  the  forecast  of  water  demand  and \nproduction.  \n4.  Private Sector Participation \n38.  All three water source projects will have the potential for PSP, which will be investigated \nduring project preparation. TOR for the studies financed under the TA loan will explicitly require \nthe consultants to assess the viability of PSP in all three projects. MWSS intend to involve the \nconcessionaires in project management and implementation based on existing arrangements. \nHowever, detailed implementation and procurement arrangements, based on transparent and \ncompetitive procedures as required for projects supported by ADB, will be developed during \npreparation of the feasibility studies.  \n                                                 \n10 This compares with current average water tariffs per cubic meter of P15.76 for the MWSI service area, and P10.06 \n \nfor the MWCI service area; source: MWSS.", " 11\n5.  Environmental and Social Measures \n39.  Environmental  and  social  impact  assessments,  including  issues  of  involuntary \nresettlement  and  gender  development,  will  be  integral  components  for  the  preparation  of \nfeasibility  studies  and  other  consulting  services  financed  under  the  Project.  Environmental \nassessment will be undertaken in accordance with the revised Operations Manual Section 20: \nEnvironmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Social Safeguards (Involuntary Resettlement \nand Indigenous Peoples) concerns, as outlined in Appendix 11, will be addressed in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis  and  ADB  policies  on  Involuntary \nResettlement, as detailed in the  Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice, and \nIndigenous Peoples. The impact of the proposed projects on indigenous people occupying land \nin the upper catchment areas of both the Angat and Laiban projects will be investigated in detail \nduring the project studies, and appropriate mitigation measures will be designed if required. \nB.  Project Risks \n40.  Risks Associated with Concession.  The efficient implementation of the Project will rely \non the continued commitment of MWSS and the concessionaires. The concessionaires will (i) be \ntreating and distributing the  additional bulk water provided from the new water sources, (ii) \nsupport the PMO through seconding of staff, and (iii) be responsible for loan repayment through \nadjusted water tariffs. One of the concessionaires, MWSI, which is responsible for providing \nwater supply and sanitation services in the West Zone, has given notice that it will terminate its \nconcession agreement. While this case is under arbitration, it will most likely result in reduced \nparticipation of MWSI in project implementation. The potential adverse impact on the Project will \nbe limited, since (i) both MWSS and MWCI are sufficiently experienced, and each is staffed to \nsuccessfully implement the Project without support from the other concessionaire; and (ii) the \nadditional water sources resulting from the TA loan are urgently needed, thus providing a strong \nincentive for all parties involved to implement the Project expeditiously. In case MWSI will \nactually terminate its concession, either MWSS or a newly contracted concessionaire will take \nover responsibility from MWSI, including loan repayment. \n41.  Risks Associated with Consultant Selection. Quality and timely delivery of studies \nprepared under the Project will particularly depend on the competence and commitment of the \nconsultants recruited by MWSS. This risk will be mitigated by (i) detailed TOR for the studies that \nfully address the issues set out in the Report and Recommendation of the President and that will \nbe  subject  to  approval  by  ADB,  (ii)  consultant  recruitment  following  ADB  procedures  and \nguidelines, and (iii) consultant selection following QCBS procedures.  \n42.  Risks Associated with Timely Implementation. The Project will include preparation of \nthree potential water source projects. While the Wawa River Project and capacity building \nactivities will come first, implementation of the other two projects will follow shortly. This will \nimpose a heavy workload on the PMO, particularly at the beginning of project implementation, \nwhen consultants need to be recruited and adjustments to project design may be needed during \nthe inception phases. This risk of implementation delays is manageable because the PMO (i) is \nexperienced in recruitment of consultants and in working according to ADB requirements, and (ii) \nwill be supported by staff seconded by the concessionaires as required. \n43.  Risks  Associated  with  Availability  of  Bilateral  Support  for  Capacity  Building. \nCapacity building to improve financial management of MWSS is an important component for \nsuccessful implementation of the Project and the resulting water source projects. To address this \nissue, capacity building has been included in the project design under Part B. While several \npotential bilateral funding agencies have been approached, grant financing for this component \nhas not been secured yet. MWSS has agreed that the capacity building component will be ", " 12  \nfinanced from its own funds in case a bilateral grant donor cannot be identified. Commencement \nof the capacity building component will be a condition for disbursement of funds for components \nunder Part A of the Project. \n44.  Risks  Associated  with  Resettlement  Issues.  The  Laiban  Dam  component  is \nparticularly affected by resettlement issues. International nongovernment organizations have \nalready expressed their concerns. The risk for the Project consists of delayed implementation \nthrough protracted consultations on resettlement. This risk will be mitigated by (i) detailed TOR \nfor the studies that fully address the resettlement issues and that will be subject to approval by \nADB, and (ii) active consultations by the MWSS and ADB with organizations representing \nsettlers at the dam site.  \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n45.  In addition to the standard assurances, MWSS has given the following assurances, which \nare incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  All  projects  will  be  designed  in  strict  conformity  with  the  applicable  national \nenvironmental impact standards and in line with the  Environment Policy of the \nAsian Development Bank. Initial environmental examinations will be undertaken \nfor  each  subproject,  and  an  assessment  will  be  made  as  to  whether  the \nsubproject  is  environmentally  sensitive.  Depending  on  the  outcome  of  the \nassessment, and the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and of applicable \nnational standards, an environmental impact assessment will be prepared for \neach of the resulting water source projects. \n(ii)  The studies and engineering designs prepared for the subprojects and other \nconsulting  services  provided  will  comply  with  all  relevant  ADB  requirements, \npolicies, and guidelines including, without limitation, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement,  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  Water  Policy,  Guidelines  for \nIncorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations, and  Guidelines for the \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the \nAsian Development Bank. \n(iii)  MWSS will ensure that all necessary counterpart funds for project implementation \nare provided fully and in a timely manner.  \n(iv)  In the event MWSS arranges for the PMO staff to be complemented by staff \nseconded by the concessionaires, or their affiliates or subsidiaries, the relevant \nconcessionaire, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries,  will be disqualified \nfrom bidding for resulting water source projects for which they have seconded \nstaff.  \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n46.  The following conditions for disbursement have been agreed: \n(i)  The disbursement of TA loan proceeds for Part A\u2014Development of New Water \nSource  Projects  will  be  subject  to  the  commencement  of  Part  B\u2014Capacity \nBuilding. \n(ii)  No  withdrawals  will  be  made  from  the  Loan  Account  for  Part  B\u2014Capacity \nBuilding.

Sector Description \n1.  As of the end of 2000 and as reported in the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan \n(MTPDP) 2001-2004,1 access to public water supply systems had increased from about 60% in \n1985  to  about  80%  of  the  total  population  in  the  Philippines.  According  to  Metropolitan \nWaterworks  and  Sewerage  System,  its  concessionaires  Manila  Water  Company,  Inc.  and \nMaynilad Water Services, Inc., served about 76% of the population living within the MWSS \nservice area at that time. This contrasted with urban areas outside of Metro Manila, where 88% \nof the population had access to safe drinking water through systems provided by the Local \nWater Utilities Administration, local government units (LGUs), and the private sector. By the end \nof 2002 the concessionaires provided water to about 82% of the total population within their \nservice areas in Metro Manila. Since commencement of the concessions in 1997, service quality \nhas improved, and the number of households connected has increased significantly. \n2.  Efforts at integrated planning and development of water supply programs to improve the \nsituation at the provincial level have, in many cases, not shown significant progress. Sector data \nthat  could  be  used  for  planning  and  monitoring  have  become  very  scarce.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector plan study conducted in \n1999 and 20002 noted that more than 20 government agencies are involved in different aspects \nof the sector, resulting in a fragmented approach to management, an ambiguous definition of \nresponsibilities, functional duplication, absence of a reliable comprehensive database, and \nfractured water resources management planning. The two national institutions with a significant \nand specific policy mandate in the WSS sector are the Department of the Interior and Local \nGovernment (DILG) and the National Economic and Development Authority. \n3.  In the past, the main source of funding for water supply was the central Government, \nwith  assistance  from  bilateral  and  multilateral  loans  and  grants.  With  the  Government\u2019s \nprivatization thrust, private capital is also seen to gradually help finance projects in the sector. \nKey problems in financing water supply include (i) inability of the majority of water supply \nagencies to generate sufficient funds from operations to finance system development and \nimprovement, (ii) inadequate provision for operation and maintenance to sustain the current \nlevels and quality of service, and (iii) inadequate assessment of ability and willingness of \nconsumers to pay for WSS services. \n4.  While the National Water Resources Board (NWRB)3 is mandated to coordinate and \nintegrate the plans and programs of all water resources agencies, such plans seldom receive \nNWRB approval. Until recently, master and river basin plans have been nonexistent and NWRB \nlacks the resources needed to assess and approve investment plans. This lack of effective \ncoordinated planning and implementation of a river basin or watershed approach does not allow \nadequate priority setting and makes it difficult for both public and private sectors to prepare, \noffer, and assess investment proposals.  \n5.  The lack of effective al w enforcement is also a concern, as watersheds continue to \nremain unprotected. This constitutes a major concern because (i) human settlements are fast \nencroaching into watershed areas; (ii) the common practice of employing kaingin (slash-and-\n                                                 \n1  National Economic Development Authority. 2001.

It is \nplanned to transfer the NWRB to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in the future. The main \nresponsibilities of NWRB include regulating the use of water sources through the issuance of water rights, drafting \nof framework plans and policies, and overall coordination and integration of the water resources plan. ", "  Appendix 2  17 \nburn)  cultivation  sometimes  results  in  uncontrollable  forest  fires;  and  (iii)  logging  and \ndeforestation activities, despite legislative prohibitions, are degrading catchment areas. \nB.  Government Policies and Plans \n6.  The overriding principle pertinent to the provision of WSS services is the empowerment \nof local government units (LGUs). The enactment of the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991 \nprovides them with a central role in the provision of WSS services. To implement this, national \nagencies have adopted the following policies and strategies: (i) provide a favorable environment \nfor LGU activity in the WSS sector and assistance from DILG, together with encouraging private \nsector participation in the provision of WSS services; (ii) privatize water supply facilities in urban \nareas whenever appropriate; (iii) develop and provide incentives for contiguous water districts to \namalgamate into single business entities to attract private sector investments in water supply \ndevelopment; and (iv) adopt a holistic approach to water resources development through the \ninclusion of supply, distribution, treatment, and sanitation.  \n7.  In implementing and applying these strategies, agencies and organizations within the \nsector should apply the following crosscutting principles: (i) water sector development is to be \nparticipatory and consultative at each level, leading to commitment by stakeholders and action \nthat is socially acceptable; (ii) water use should be sustainable with appropriate incentives, \nregulatory controls, and public education promoting economic efficiency, conservation of water \nresources, and protection of the environment; and (iii) successful water sector development \nrequires a commitment to sustained capacity-building, monitoring, education, research, and \nlearning at all levels, to respond effectively to the changing needs at the national, basin, project, \nservice entity, and community levels.  \nC.  External Assistance to the Sector \n8.  There has been considerable support by multilateral and bilateral agencies for the urban \nsector and for the WSS sector in the Philippines. Since 1974 ADB has played a major role by \nproviding 19 loans to the WSS sector amounting to approximately $728 million, and 27 technical \nassistance grants totaling $12.41 million. In addition to ADB, the major providers of official \nexternal assistance are the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and the World Bank. \nOthers include the Australian Agency for International Development, Canadian International \nDevelopment  Agency,  European  Union,  France,  Germany  (Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit  and  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau),  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, New Zealand, United Kingdom Department for International Development, \nUnited Nations, and the United States Agency for International Development. \nD.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n9.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy in the Philippines emphasizes poverty reduction and social \ndevelopment  through  promoting  equitable  growth,  improving  basic  social  services,  and \nimproving management and protection of the environment. The  WSS sector is in a state of \ntransition because of sector reforms introduced as a result of devolution and decentralization of \nsector responsibilities. ADB has encouraged a shift from a traditional top-down centralized \nplanning approach to the concept of bottom-up planning and extensive local consultation, \nincluding  training  and  capacity  building  of  sector  agencies  in  project  management  and \ncommunity development. ADB is emphasizing community participation and decentralization of \nthe implementation process.

The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) is a Government-owned \nand -controlled corporation created under Republic Act No. 6234 on 19 June 1971. Republic Act \nNo. 8041, the National Water Crisis Act of 1995,1 reorganized MWSS. After Executive Order No. \n311 was issued on 20 March 1996, encouraging private sector participation in the operations \nand facilities of MWSS, it entered into concession agreements with two concessionaires, the \nManila Water Company, Inc. (MWCI) and Maynilad Water Services, Inc. (MWSI) on 21 February \n1997.  The former manages the East Zone and the latter the West Zone of the MWSS service \narea.  The  concessions  commenced  on  1  August  1997,  and  MWSS  was  divided  into  two \nindependent entities, namely MWSS-Residual Services and the MWSS-Regulatory Office. \n2.  Based  on  the  revised  organizational  structure  and  staffing  plan  approved  by  the \nDepartment of Budget and Management (DBM), MWSS Residual Services activities include (i) \nadministration and management of retained assets, (ii) administration of existing loans, (iii) \nfacilitating the provision of bulk water, and (iv) facilitating development of new water sources. \nThe  MWSS-Regulatory  Office,  on  the  other  hand,  is  the  regulatory  body  to  monitor the \nprovisions and performance targets specified in the concession agreements and to ensure that \nappropriate measures are being taken in case of noncompliance. An Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)-financed technical assistance (TA) grant for capacity building and strengthening of the \nregulatory body is under implementation.2 \nB.  Institutional Analysis \n1.  Organization \n3.  The corporate powers and functions of MWSS are vested in and exercised by a board of \ntrustees of nine members. Management of the company is vested in the administrator, who is \nseconded by the deputy administrator. There are three major departments: (i) Administration \nand  Finance;  (ii)  Engineering  and  Project  Management;  and  (iii)  Asset  Management,  and \nGeneral Services. The existing organizational structure is presented in Figure A4. \n4.  MWSS has 104 employees, complemented by 68 contractual staff.

The organizational structure of MWSS as approved by DBM after commencement of the \nconcessions is still considered as an interim solution subject to a reevaluation of the staffing \npattern by the management and approval by the board of trustees and DBM. While most of the \nexisting positions are filled, there appears to be a need for MWSS to increase manpower and/or \nefficiency to fulfill its mandate.   \n2.  Administration and Finance Department \n6.  Of the 28 regular personnel under the Administration and Finance Department, 7 are \ncertified public accountants, 12 are accounting majors, while the others are commerce or \nbusiness administration graduates. While the qualifications of the staff appear to be adequate, \nthe program of work, information technology, and efficiency require improvement to cope with \nresponsibilities requiring a great deal of work.  \n7.  Since 1997 training for financial personnel has been conducted on three topics: (i) fiscal \nand property management; (ii) cash flow statement; and (iii) financial information system for \nexternally assisted projects. Most of the personnel in the Finance Department have attended \nthese training programs, which are shown in Table A4.2 \nTable A4.2: Training Conducted, 1998-1999 \nTitle of Training  Date   Duration  Attendees \nFiscal and Property Management  October 1998  40 hours  21 \nCash Flow Statement  May 1999  16 hours  24 \nFinancial Information System   October 1999  24 hours  36 \nfor Foreign Assisted Projects \nSource: MWSS. \n8.  Improving  information  technology  and  upgrading  of  the  computer  system  could \nsignificantly  increase  staff  efficiency.  An  inventory  of  computer  units  available  to  the \nAdministration and Finance Department shows an almost one-to-one ratio between regular \npersonnel and computers. However, a number of computers are outdated, which is aggravated \nby incompatibility of operating systems and lack of an adequate network, resulting in low \nefficiency and lack of information sharing. Standard spreadsheet software is being used, but \nfiles are currently not linked, requiring duplication of work in encoding data and manual report \ngeneration. \n3.  Capacity Building  \n9.  For FY1999 and FY2000 the Commission on Audit (COA) rendered an adverse opinion \non the fairness and presentation of the financial statements of MWSS, citing a number of \nfindings and recommendations that needed to be implemented by MWSS. The adverse opinion \non the audited accounts has been aggravated by the fact that many of the recommendations \npreviously made by COA have not been fully implemented by MWSS. This issue, together with \nfindings of the Mission, has revealed weaknesses in MWSS financial management, accounting, \nand control that need to be addressed through capacity building.  \n10.  Training programs for capacity building will include (i) management accounting; (ii) \ncorporate  planning,  budgeting,  and budgetary control; (iii) financial accounting; (iv) internal \ncontrol and audit systems; and (v) data processing. Training will be complemented by the \npreparation of guidelines and manuals for specific financial activities including (i) budgeting \nprocedure; (ii) accounting system; (iii) cash management; (iv) auditing; (v) report generation; \nand (vi) internal control. The need for improved information technology will be addressed \nthrough procurement and installation of computer hardware and software including an adequate ", " 22  Appendix 4 \n \nnetwork for the Administration and Finance Department. Outline terms of reference and budget \nfor capacity building are presented in Appendix 7. \nC.  Financial Analysis \n1.  Introduction \n11.  Financial analysis was carried out following the Guidelines for the Financial Governance \nand Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank, including (i) \nevaluation of the financial performance of MWSS for the past 3 years, 1999 \u2013 2001; and (ii) \npreparation of financial projections for the duration of the Project. \n2.  Current Performance \n12.  MWSS\u2019 single major source of revenue comes from concession fees paid by MWSI and \nMWCI. Smaller portions are derived from rentals of leased properties, interest income, and \nother operating and service income.  The concession fees are determined by the provisions of \nthe concession agreements and have to provide for three major expenditures: (i) MWSS current \noperating budget (COB); (ii) debt service of existing loans; and (iii) counterpart funds for \nongoing investment projects.   \n13.  The standard accounting system and procedure being followed by MWSS is embodied \nin  the  Government  Accounting  and  Auditing  Manual  (GAAM).  It  provides  guidelines  for \nmaintaining  financial  records  of  property,  keeping  books  of  account,  and  compiling  final \naccounts and financial statements. Accounting standards, particularly those related to financial \nreporting, are defined by COA. Aside from the GAAM, no other guidelines or manuals are \navailable to the financial staff to provide guidance on day-to-day operations.  \n14.  Due to the absence of a corporate planning group, no multiyear budgeting is being done. \nPlanning is limited to short-term budgeting and control procedures, which are based on annual \nplans. The annual budget is prepared each year but the mandate of MWSS with a privatized \noperation exempts it from the General Appropriation Act. Thus, it does not undergo the usual \nbudget cycle that regular government agencies are subjected to, and it does not have any \nspecific compliance date as far as DBM is concerned. \n15.  The COA Annual Audit Report discusses its findings relative to the legality and regularity \nof transactions and, to a limited extent, the evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of \nsystems and procedures of certain aspects of the operations of MWSS, the main objectives of \nwhich were to ascertain the fairness and reliability of its financial position and the results of its \noperations. For FY1999 and FY2000, the Auditor rendered an adverse opinion on the fairness \nof  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  of  MWSS,  citing  a  number  of  findings  and \nrecommendations that would need the implementation of MWSS. MWSS, in consultation with \nCOA and ADB, has developed and implemented a time-bound action plan to address the issues \nraised. In March 2002, COA confirmed that, per their evaluation of the actions taken, MWSS \nhad substantially complied with audit recommendations. Of the six findings that caused the \nadverse opinion on the financial statements for FY2000, three had been fully implemented, two \nsubstantially  complied  with,  and  one  partly  implemented.  For  FY2001,  COA  rendered  an \nunqualified opinion on the accounts of two MWSS projects financed by ADB. A qualified opinion \nwas  rendered  on  a  third  ADB-financed  project,  but  was  not  considered  to  be  a  material \nqualification, since it would not have adverse impact on the quality of the project.  \n16.  Because of the devaluation of the Philippine peso, the cost of debt service has increased \nconsiderably, and MWSI, which had taken on 90% of the existing debt at the time of concession \ncommencement, requested adjustment of water tariffs in September 2000. An agreement for \ntariff adjustment was reached one year later, becoming effective for MWSI on 20 October 2001 ", "Appendix 4    23\n \nand for MWCI on 12 November 2001. MWSI has been in arrears in payment of concession fees \nsince March 2001. Following tariff adjustment, MWSI committed to pay COB for 2002 fully in \nJanuary 2002, and all outstanding fees for debt service and progress billing including interest \nand incidental expenses incurred in June 2002. However, payment of outstanding concession \nfees has not been settled yet. In the meantime, MWSS has applied for short-term loans from \nlocal  and  foreign  banks  to  bridge  the  financial  gap  caused  by  the  delayed  payment  of \nconcession fees. By the end of 2002, MWSI had given notice that it would terminate its \nconcession  agreement,  and  arbitration  is  ongoing  to  decide  about  the  termination \narrangements. \n17.  Prior to the issuance of Republic Act 8424, the Tax Reform Act of 1997, MWSS had been \nenjoying tax exempt status from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). However, the issue of \nwhether MWSS was still covered by the exemption from corporate tax came up in 1997 when \nBIR issued a new list of exempt agencies that did not include MWSS. A number of studies and \nconsultations with BIR were done to settle the issue. Finally, in May 2001, a legal opinion was \nissued by BIR confirming the tax exempt status of MWSS. \n18.  MWSS is in the process of restating and clearing its financial statements according to \nCOA\u2019s recommendations. In the absence of restated accounts, the analysis of MWSS\u2019 existing \nfinancial statements for 1999- 2001, on which the auditor expressed an adverse opinion, as well \nas projections based on these statements, could be misleading. The income statements  for \n1999- 2001,  for  instance,  would  indicate  that  the  company  has  not  been  profitable  in  its \noperation, which is caused mainly by the nonclassification of concession fees for debt service \nand progress billing as revenue for the 3 year period.

Financial Projections \n19.  Financial projections have been prepared and are presented in Tables A4.7 to A4.10. \nHowever, it is evident that the financial viability of MWSS and the Project is largely dependent \non the two concessionaires. When MWSI failed to pay the concession fee for several months, \nMWSS had to use its unappropriated reserve funds to meet obligations and finally had to resort \nto  domestic  and  international  short-term  borrowing  to  meet  its  financial  obligations.  The \nresolution of several issues, including tariff adjustment for currency devaluation, will hopefully \ncontribute to improved financial performance and reporting. The tax exemption of MWSS on \npayment  of  corporate  tax  likewise  settles  the  issue  of  proper  accounting  of all relevant \nrevenues, thus providing management with accurate financial information in the future.  \n20.  The effect of the proposed TA loan is indicated in the projections. It is expected that \nMWSS will have to pay about P31.2 million for annual debt service from 2007 to 2013. \nHowever, debt service will have to be covered through the concession fees subject to tariff \nadjustments, thus having limited impact on the financial performance of MWSS. Based on an \naverage billed water volume for 2002 of 1,500 million liters per day the required tariff adjustment \nin 2007 would probably be in the range of about P0.06 per cubic meter. This compares with \ncurrent domestic water tariffs of P15.76 per cubic meter for the MWSI service area and P10.06 \nper cubic meter for the MWCI service area.3 However, billed water demand will have increased \nconsiderably until loan repayment starts, thus reducing the required tariff adjustment. A detailed \nfinancial analysis will be carried out for the new water source investment projects resulting from \nthe TA loan, for which debt service will also have to be covered through the concession fees. \n                                                 \n3  \n Source: MWSS.", "Table A4.7:   Income Statement 2\n8\na2c0tu0a2l  2003 2004 (2P0 0m5illion) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011

It is expected that, by improving service quality and expanding the number of poor \nfamilies with water connection, the water source developments to be prepared by the Project \nwill have positive impacts on the poverty situation in the Metro Manila areas they aim to serve. It \nis also anticipated that the new water sources will contribute to maintaining low water costs and \nimproving livelihood, hygiene, and sanitation standards of serviced households. These benefits \nare expected to result in a reduction of household expenses and greater income opportunities \nfor poor water users. The projects will particularly benefit women, who among all household \nmembers are usually the ones who are most involved in water use.  \n2.  The Project will document poverty and social development concerns in accordance with \nthe Asian Development Bank  Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis by preparing the \nappropriate sections of the initial poverty and social assessment and a poverty and social \nanalysis  report  detailing  poverty  and  social  impacts  for  each  of  the  water  sources  to  be \ndeveloped. \n3.  The poverty and social analysis will focus on the following: (i) determine the magnitude \nand likely impact of the Project on the poor, (ii) identify design measures that will enhance the \nProject\u2019s contribution to poverty reduction and social development, (iii) identify constraints for \nvulnerable groups to benefit from the Project and identify design measures to overcome these \nconstraints, (iv) conduct gender analysis to identify potentials and constraints for women to \nparticipate in and benefit from the Project, and (v) identify how water users can be mobilized \nthrough participatory mechanisms in the preparation of the new water sources. ", "Appendix 11    47\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARDS ISSUES \n(Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples) \n1.  The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System New Water Source Development \ntechnical assistance loan (the Project) constitutes an effort to facilitate the planning of new water \nsource projects for Metro Manila including (i) the Wawa River Project, entailing the rehabilitation of \nthe Wawa Dam and Reservoir and the construction of a pipeline and water treatment plant; (ii) the \nAngat Water Utilization and Aqueduct Improvement Project, entailing the repair and construction \nof aqueducts and associated facilities; and (iii) the Laiban Dam Project entailing the construction \nof a major dam and associated infrastructure. In case the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nconsider participating in financing of these projects the planning work carried out under the Project \nwill provide an extensive base for their final preparation.  \n \n2.  In designing the Project attention was given to land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) \nand indigenous peoples (IP) issues. Initial social assessments (ISAs) of LAR and IP impacts will \nbe prepared. When warranted by the ISAs, (i) preliminary LAR plans (PLARPs) fitting the ADB \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement as outlined in ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to \nGood Practice1, and (ii) preliminary IP development plans (PIPDPs) fitting the ADB Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples will be prepared.  \n3.  PLARPs planning will follow several principles, including the following: (i) impacts will be \nminimized as much as possible based on a thorough analysis of design alternatives; (ii) LAR will \nbe planned so as to improve or at least restore the living standards of the affected people (AP); \n(iii) APs eligible for compensation and rehabilitation will include informal settlers and IPs; (iv) \nimpact surveys will be based on recent cadastral maps; (v) APs will be fully consulted on \ncompensation and rehabilitation options; (vi) affected assets will be valued at replacement and \nmarket  rates  based  on  ad hoc  surveys;  (vii)  detailed  resettlement  areas  and  agricultural \nreplacement  areas  plans  will  be  included  in  the  PLARPs;  and  (viii)  compensation, \nagricultural/residential replacement plots, and relocation subsidies will be scheduled so as to be \ndelivered in full prior to impoundment, ground leveling, or demolition. \n4.  PIPDP initiatives will be commensurate to IPs' degree of vulnerability, impact type, and \nagreements between the Executing Agency and IPs. If affected IPs are fully integrated in \nmainstream society and culture and impacts have no specific sociocultural dimensions, the \nPIPDPs will be included as a chapter in the PLARP. The same applies if affected IPs keep a \ndegree  of  sociocultural  and  institutional  distinction  and  impacts  carry  some  sociocultural \ndimension but do not have broad community effects. However, if affected IPs maintain a degree \nof sociocultural and institutional distinction and impacts not only carry a sociocultural dimension \nbut have wide community or livelihood effects, the PIPDPs will be prepared as stand-alone \ndocuments inclusive of a participatory community development action plan (CDAP), and specific \nimplementation schedules and budgets. \n5.  PLARP and PIDP planning will be based on a participatory process involving civil society \nand APs. Particular attention will be given in ensuring that the design of eventual residential and \nagricultural  replacement  land  schemes,  or  of  PIPDPs\u2019  CDAPs,  is  carried  out  with  the \nparticipation  and  endorsement  of  the  beneficiary  communities  and  their  nongovernment \norganization representatives. \n                                                 \n1 \nCases affecting 200 or more APs, or 100 or more APs belonging to IP or vulnerable groups require a full LARP; \ncases affecting less than 200 APs or 100 IP or vulnerable groups APs require only a short LARP (for details and \ndefinitions see the \u201cADB Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice\".)  ", "48  Appendix 11 \n6.  In case ADB will consider in the future participating in financing of a project developed \nunder the TA Loan, PLARPs and PIPDPs will be thoroughly reviewed during project appraisal \nincluding consultations with the APs, update of impact surveys based on detailed design, \nrevised plans for resettlement areas, and new schedules and budgets, as may be required.
