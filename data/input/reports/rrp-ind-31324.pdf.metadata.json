Subborrowers  will  be  state  electricity  boards  (SEBs) \nand  other  state-level  power  utilities  that  have  given  a  firm \ncommitment  to  PFC  on  undertaking  power  sector  reforms.  The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  loan  assistance  to \nthe  selected  subborrowers,  through  PFC,  to  meet  part  of  their \nfinancing  requirements  for  reducing  system  losses,  enhancing \noperational flexibility and efficiency, and improving the delivery of \nservices  to  consumers.  The  borrowing  limit,  at  any  given  time,  is \nlinked  to  the  reform  milestone  corresponding  to  that  stage  of  the \nagreed reform process. \n \nThe  subprojects  will  consist  of  (i) transmission  and  distribution \nrehabilitation,  (ii) transmission  and  distribution  facilities  required \nfor  system  expansion  and  reinforcement,  and  (iii) renovation and \nmodernization of existing generating plants. \n \nIt  is  being  recognized  that  comprehensive  sector  reforms  are \nneeded to improve the performance of India's power sector.  ADB \nhas already initiated such reforms in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh \nand is in the process of doing so in Kerala. Considering that there \nare 29 states and 6 union territories, most of which are in need of \nadvice  and  assistance  to  undertake  reforms,  it  is  necessary to \ncomplement the ongoing efforts by focusing on more states. \n \nPFC,  which  started  lending  to  the  power  sector  in  1988  and \ncommenced  promoting  reforms  in  1996,  is  heavily  involved  with \nstate-level power utilities. Based on its previous performance, and \nstaff  skills  and  experience,  PFC  appears  to  be  the  best  agent  to \npromote  state-level  power  sector  reforms.  The  proposed  loan \naims to utilize PFC's experience and expertise in reform-oriented \nlending,  thereby  supplementing  ADB's  own  staff  and  financial \nresources. Lending through PFC will allow ADB to facilitate sector \nreforms  in  more  utilities  than  would  otherwise  be  possible.  The \nproposed loan is also in synergy with the Government\u2019s efforts in \npromoting power sector reforms through mechanisms such as the \nAccelerated Power Development and Reform Program. \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe overall objective of the ADB assistance is to help improve the \nstate  power  sector  in  India  so  that  it  becomes  financially  self-\nsustaining  and  capable  of  adequately  providing  its  share  of \nservices  to  the  country's  economic  and  social  development.  The \nimmediate objectives are to (i) promote power sector reforms in a \nfew  selected  states;  (ii) help  establish  independent  regulatory \nbodies;  and  (iii) functionally  unbundle  the  sector  entities  so  that \nthey  become  commercially  and  operationally  autonomous  and \nefficient,  and  financially  viable.  To  help  achieve  these  objectives, \nADB will provide financial assistance, channeled through PFC, to \nthe  selected  SEBs  to  meet  part  of  their  financing  requirements \nneeded  to  reduce  system  losses,  enhance  operational  flexibility \nand efficiency, and improve the delivery of services to consumers. \n \nADB will finance 60% of the total subproject cost. The remaining \nfunds  will  come  from  the  subborrowers\u2019  own  resources,  which \nmay  include  further  PFC  loans.  The  maximum  lending  for  any \nsingle  subborrower  will  be  40%  of  the  total  ADB  loan  unless \notherwise agreed by ADB. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $150 million  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources will \nbe  provided  under  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan \nwill have a 20-year term including a grace period of 5 years, with \nrepayments  linked  to  actual  disbursements  under  the  Loan,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a \nfront-end  fee  of  1.0%,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \nPFC will relend ADB funds in accordance with individual  reform-\noriented operational and financial action plans (R-OFAPs) agreed \nwith  the  eligible  subborrowers,  and  PFC's  Operational  Policy \nStatement. The subloans will have a maximum maturity period of \n15 years, including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2008. \n \n \n31 December 2007 \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n\fImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nsocial \n\nPFC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  proposed  loan.  Its \nchairperson  and  managing  director  will  be  responsible  for  the \noverall management of the Project. Day-to-day implementation of \nthe  Project  will  be  carried  out  by  the  relevant  divisions  under \nguidance from their respective directors as follows: formulation of \nand  obtaining  approval  for  R-OFAPs,  determining  maximum \nlending  limits  for  R-OFAP  milestones,  and  monitoring  of  their \ncompliance  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Institutional  Appraisal \nand Development Division; appraisal and approval of subprojects \nand  monitoring  of  their  implementation,  including  procurement \nactivities,  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Projects  Division.  The \nEnvironmental  Assessment  and  Monitoring  Cell  in  the  Externally \nAided  Projects  Unit  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  and \nsocial  assessment  of  subprojects  and  the  monitoring  of  their \nenvironmental  and \nimpact  mitigation  measures. \nCoordination of all project-related matters between ADB and PFC \nwill be the responsibility of the Externally Aided Projects Unit. \n \nPower Finance Corporation Limited \n \nProcurement for goods and services financed under the ADB loan \nwill follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. For contracts valued \nat  $5 million  or  more,  subborrowers  will  follow  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.  For  contracts  below  $5 million, \nPFC  will ensure that competitive and transparent procedures will \nbe followed by subborrowers. \n \nProcurement will be from ADB member countries only. \n \nThe financial health of many SEBs has been deteriorating due to \ninsufficient  cost  recovery,  inadequate  tariffs,  and  high  operating \ncosts.  Consequently,  most  of \nthe  SEBs  are  now  being \nrestructured  under  various  initiatives  to  achieve  financial  viability \nand  improve  operational  efficiency.  The  proposed  loan  will  be \nused to support these reform-minded SEBs. The subprojects to be \nfinanced  under  the  proposed  loan  will  contribute  to  financial \nrecovery  through  increased  efficiency,  lower  transmission  and \ndistribution  losses,  and  better  metering  and  collections.  These \nimprovements  are  expected  to  improve  the  financial  condition  of \nthe  assisted  agencies  and  will  lead  to  improved  delivery  of \nservices to the final consumers. \n \nThe  indirect  benefits  attributable  to  the  proposed  loan  are  also \nsubstantial.  For  example,  tariff  rationalization  by  independent \nregulatory  bodies  will  result  in  more  equitable  tariff  levels  across \nconsumer  categories,  leading  to  efficient  allocation  of  financial \nand  economic  resources.  Improvements  in  the  quality  of  power \nsupply will enhance agricultural production and will discourage the \n \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nuse  of  inefficient  captive  power  generation  by  agricultural  and \ncertain  industrial  consumers.  Finally,  the  tariff  decisions  by \nindependent regulatory bodies and a stable power supply, through \nsystem \nimprovements,  will  encourage  more  private  sector \nparticipation  both  in  the  power  sector  and  in  other  parts  of  the \neconomy. \n \nThe main risk is the financial viability of SEBs and hence of PFC. \nPFC\u2019s  asset  quality  is  vulnerable  to  the  poor  creditworthiness  of \nits SEB clients. PFC has attempted to mitigate this credit risk by \nsecuring its loans though escrow account arrangements and state \ngovernment  guarantees.  Escrow  account  arrangements  cover \n1.25  times  the  present  and  future  debt  service  of  SEBs  owing \nmoney  to  PFC.  To  further  minimize  this  risk,  PFC  will  select \nsubborrowers based strictly on the proposed R-OFAP mechanism \nand  ensure  timely  risk  control  management.  These  efforts  are \nexpected to minimize the associated risks. \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Power  Finance  Corporation  Limited  (PFC),  for  the  State  Power  Sector  Reform  Project1. \nThe loan will be guaranteed by India. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Performance2 \n\n1. \n\nThe Power Sector Setup \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Power  of  the  Government  of  India  (the  Government)  provides  overall \n2. \nguidance  to  the  sector.  The  recently  established  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  is \nempowered  to  regulate  the  sector  at  the  national  level,  including  central  power  utilities  in \naccordance  with  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  Act,  1998.  The  central  power  utilities \ninclude the National Thermal Power Corporation, National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, and \nNuclear Power Corporation, which are engaged in generation, and the Powergrid Corporation, \nwhich  is  engaged  in  interstate  power  transmission.  The  Government  also  owns  financing \ninstitutions  devoted  solely  to  power  sector  lending  such  as  PFC  and  the  Rural  Electrification \nCorporation.  Recently,  the  Government  established  the  Power  Trading  Corporation,  to  be \nresponsible for power trading among states and between states and central power utilities. \n \n3. \nAt  the  state  level,  the  state  governments  control  the  sector  through  state  electricity \nboards  (SEBs)3  and    electricity  departments  (EDs).  These  SEBs  and  EDs  are  responsible  for \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution,  usually  within  their  own  states  and  territories.  The \ncentral  power  utilities  own  and  operate  30%  of  the  country's  total  generation  capacity,  while \nSEBs  and  EDs  have  59%  of  the  total.  In  addition,  five  privately  owned  utilities,  operating  in \ncertain  urban  centers  and  responsible  for  power  distribution  within  their  franchised  areas, \ntogether with some independent power producers, have a share of 11% of generation. \n \n\n2. \n\nSector Performance \n\n4. \nThe objectives that have been set for the power sector in the Government's recent five-\nyear plans have not been fully met. The main objective of the most recent plans was to ensure \nthat  the  anticipated  demand  for  electricity  was  met  adequately  and  in  a  reliable  and  cost-\neffective  manner.  Power  sector  performance,  measured  using  this  objective  as  the  yardstick, \nhas not been satisfactory. \n \n\na. \n\nTechnical Performance \n\nIn  terms  of  capacity  addition,  the  performance  during  the  Eighth  Plan  (FY1993\u20131997) \n5. \nwas  only  54%  of  target,  having  added  only  16,422  megawatts  (MW)  instead  of  the  targeted \n30,538 MW. The Ninth Plan envisaged a total addition of 40,245 MW during the FY1998\u20132002 \nperiod,  comprising  11,909  MW  by  central  sector  agencies,  10,748  MW  by  state  utilities,  and \n17,588  MW  by  the  private  sector  independent  power  producers  (IPPs).  However,  the  actual \ncapacity  addition  fell  far  short  of  target,  with  the  central  sector  meeting  only  37.8%  and  the \nprivate  sector  28.8%  of  target.  The  state  sector  performed  better,  achieving  87.9%  of  target. \nGiven the SEBs\u2019 difficulties associated with establishing adequate escrow accounts to service \n\n                                                 \n1    The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Appendix 2 gives a detailed description and analysis of the sector. \n3   Seven out of these SEBs have been restructured into separate generation, transmission, and distribution entities. \n\n\f2 \n\npower  purchase  contracts  and  the  attendant  problems  in  achieving  financial  closure  for  IPP \nprojects currently in India, realizing the full IPP contribution to the generation addition appears to \nbe unlikely in the immediate future.  \n \n6. \nWhile new generation addition has fallen short of target, the existing generating plants, \nmainly  coal-fired  thermal  power  plants,  have  shown  improved  performance  during  the  recent \npast.  With  the  renovation  and  modernization  (R&M)  program  for  thermal  power  stations, \nintroduced  in  the  early  1990s,  the  plant  load  factor4\u2014a  performance  indictor\u2014has increased \nfrom 64.4% in FY1997 to 69.9% in FY2002. According to the Common Minimum National Action \nPlan (para. 10), the overall plant load factor was expected to increase to a minimum of 65% for \nstate-owned utilities and to a national average of  70% by 2002. However, given the substantial \nshortage  in  capacity  addition,  these  improvements  in  the  performance  of  existing  generating \nplants are inadequate to narrow down the demand-supply gap. Although, by the end of FY2002, \nIndia had a total installed capacity of 105,000 MW, there was a peak power deficit of 12.6% and \nan energy deficit of 7.5%. Per capita electricity consumption stood at 355 kilowatt-hours (kWh) \nin FY2002, compared to, for example, 719 kWh for the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \nOperational  performance,  measured  in  terms  of  transmission  and  distribution  (T&D) \n7. \nlosses, has also not been satisfactory. T&D losses are reported to have increased from 24.5% \nin  FY1997  to  27.8%  in  FY2002  for  the  entire  country.  In  the  absence  of  adequate  metering \narrangements,  especially  for  agricultural  consumers,  part  of  the  losses  used  to  be  lumped \ntogether  with  agricultural  consumption.  The  actual  losses  are,  therefore,  thought  to  be  much \nhigher, with some SEBs now reporting T&D losses as high as 45\u201357%.5 The major reasons for \nsuch  high  losses  are  pilferage  of  energy  through  unauthorized  connections  and  tampering  of \nmeters, and technical losses originating from overloaded distribution networks. \n \n\nb. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n8. \nSince  the  SEBs  account  for  almost  80%  of  commercial electricity sales in the country, \nthe  financial  performance  of  the  entire  sector,  including  that  of  central  sector  agencies,  is \nheavily dependent on the performance of the SEBs. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948, \namended in 1984, the financial performance of the SEBs used to be measured in terms of rate \nof return (ROR) on net fixed assets with a mandated minimum ROR of 3%. However, none of \nthe SEBs achieved this mandated minimum without a subsidy from their state government, and \nonly  Karnataka  achieved  a  3%  ROR  with  the  government  subsidy.  All  the  others  posted \nnegative RORs. As indicated in Table 1 below, the consolidated performance of all SEBs shows \nthat  the  minimum  required  value  has  not  been  achieved  during  the  recent  past,  and  indeed, \ndeteriorated  over  the  period  indicated.  The  major  reasons  for  this  unsatisfactory  financial \nperformance were the increasing gap between the cost of supply and the average tariff, and the \ndecreasing  recovery  rate.  These  figures  stood  at  Rs1.10  per  kWh  and 68.6%, respectively, in \nFY2002. \n\n                                                 \n4   Defined as the ratio of actual capacity utilization of the plant to its rated capacity utilization. \n5   For example, T&D losses for Delhi are reported to be 57%. \n\n\f3 \n\nTable 1.

Planning Commission.  \n \n9. \nThe  poor  financial  performance  of  the  SEBs  and  the  resulting  shortage  of  liquidity  has \nalso  adversely  affected  their  operational  efficiency and led to increasing T&D losses. With the \nlimited  financial  resources  available,  the  tendency  of  most  of  the  SEBs  had  been  to  invest  a \nlarger proportion in generation to address the demand-supply gap and less in transmission and \ndistribution. Over the years, this approach has led to inadequate distribution facilities resulting in \noverloading, inadequate maintenance, high T&D losses, and poor supply reliability, which in turn \nled to insufficient revenue\u2014thus resulting in a vicious circle. \n \nB. \n\nKey Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nStructural Weaknesses of the Sector and Government Strategy \n\n10. \nThe  main  reason  for  the  overall  unsatisfactory  performance  of  the  sector  can  be \nattributed to structural weaknesses.  For  more  than  half  a  century,  the  Indian  Electricity  Act  of \n1910  and  the  Electricity  (Supply)  Act  of  1948  provided  the  basic  framework  for  power  sector \noperations.  They  provided  for  the  establishment  of  SEBs,  EDs,  and  central  sector  utilities  and \ncontributed to the current status of development of the sector serving a population of more than \n1 billion.  However,  with  the  worldwide  changes  in  economic  and  financial  imperatives  and \ntechnological developments, the sector needed comprehensive reforms to provide the flexibility \nrequired to meet the challenges that lay ahead. These challenges included achieving financial \nautonomy  and  viability,  good  governance,  attracting  private  sector  investment,  and  finally, \nproviding  a  good  quality  supply  to  an  increasingly  demanding  population.  The  Government's \ninitial  approach  to  address  these  issues  was  not  comprehensive  enough.  For  example,  to \npromote private sector participation in generation projects, the Government, in 1991, amended \ncertain parts of the Electricity Act, 1910 to facilitate mobilization of domestic and foreign private \nfunds  and  to  allow  incentives  such  as  high  returns  on  investments.  Although  there  was  some \ninitial enthusiasm from the private sector, these measures have not resulted in more than 6,800 \nMW  of  capacity  addition  so  far.  The  poor  financial  performance  of  the  SEBs  did  not  provide \nsufficient  comfort  to  potential  investors.  In  1993,  as  a  result  of  efforts  made  by  the  National \nDevelopment Council,6 a high-level committee on power was constituted. In its report, submitted \nin October 1994, the committee recommended (i) organizational reforms at the state level aimed \nat  unbundling  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  operations  of  SEBs  and \ncommercialization of the ensuing entities; (ii) organizational reforms at the national and regional \nlevels  aimed  at  freeing  the  central  sector  agencies  from  tight  government  control  and  at \nreducing the Government's equity in these agencies so as to enable participation of the private \n\n                                                 \n6   The National Development Council is India's highest political body comprising the chief ministers of all the states \n\nin India, and chaired by the Prime Minister. \n\n\f4 \n\nsector  on  a  joint-venture  basis;  (iii) large-scale  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  generation \nand  transmission,  with  sponsors  selected  through  transparent  and  competitive  bidding \nprocedures; (iv) creation of national and regional tariff boards to take over the responsibility for \ntariff  setting  independently  of  central  government  and  state  government  control;  and \n(v) progressive  phasing  out  of  subsidies  to  agricultural  consumers.  These  recommendations \nultimately  led  to  the  adoption  by  the  National  Development  Council  of  a  Common  Minimum \nNational  Action  Plan  for  Power  in  1996.  To  operationalize some of the recommendations, the \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commissions  Act  was  passed  in  1998  enabling  the  establishment  of \nindependent  regulatory  bodies  at  the  central  and  state  levels.  Although  this  was  a  significant \nstep  toward  improving  the  sector,  it was not comprehensive enough to cover complete sector \nrestructuring. The Government set up the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission under the \nAct,  to  be  responsible  for  regulating  power  sector  operations  at  the  national  level,  related  to \ngeneration  and interstate transmission. The state governments were given the option to set up \ntheir  own  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions  (SERCs)  under  the  Act  or  under  bills  to  be \npassed  by  their  own  legislative  assemblies.  As  a  result  of  these  initiatives  and sometimes on \ntheir own, some states have taken steps to reform their power sectors. Foremost among them \nwas Orissa, which, with World Bank assistance, completely unbundled its SEB and established \nthe  country's  first  SERC  in  1996.  Reforms  in  Orissa  were  followed  by  similar  reforms  in \nHaryana,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Karnataka,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  with  World  Bank  assistance  and  in \nGujarat and Madhya Pradesh with ADB assistance. \n \nTo promote more comprehensive reforms in the power sector, the Ministry of Power has \n11. \nfinalized  the  draft  Electricity  Bill  2001.  As  with  concurrent  subjects  (Appendix  2),  consultations \nhave  been  held  with  state  governments  on  the  contents  of  the  draft  and  the  final  version  was \npresented to Parliament in 2001.7 This Bill attempts to consolidate previous acts relating to all \npower  sector  operations  including  the  setting  up  of  independent  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  companies  as  well  as  regulatory  agencies;  national  and  state-level power sector \nplanning;  consumer  protection  and  dispute  resolution;  and  safety  aspects.  Once  enacted,  the \nBill  will  repeal  previous  electricity  acts,  thereby  providing  a  single  comprehensive  body  of \nlegislation for the entire range of sector operations. As with previous acts, the Bill provides for \nany state government to hold in abeyance within its territory, provisions of the Bill for a period \nnot  exceeding  6  months  from  the  date  of  enactment  of  the  Bill  in  order  to  address  any \ntransitional issues. \n \n12. \nThe  other  notable  features  of  the  Bill  are  (i) open  access  to  transmission  systems; \n(ii) compulsory metering of all consumers within 2 years of enacting the Bill; (iii) facilitating the \nentry  of  power  traders  as  opposed  to  distribution  service  providers;  (iv) prioritizing  the  use  of \nproceeds from privatizing power sector assets; and (v) promoting more targeted and transparent \nsubsidies  to  the  rural  and  economically  weaker  consumers.  While  providing  a  comprehensive \nframework for improvement of the power sector, the Bill also provides the necessary flexibility to \nstate  governments  to  determine  their  own  pace  and  priorities  for  sector  reform.  However,  to \naccelerate  the  state-level  reforms,  the  Government  has  also  established  a  number  of  other \ninitiatives  such  as  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform  Program.  Under  this \nProgram, state governments and their SEBs can use additional federal funds for selected types \nof  power  projects,  based  on  their  commitment  to  reforms  under  memorandums  of  agreement \nsigned with the central Government.8 \n \n\n                                                 \n7   The Bill is being studied by a Standing Committee of Parliament. \n8  PFC  is  one  of  the  agencies  designated  for  implementing  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform \n\nProgram. \n\n\f5 \n\n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n13. \nOperations  of  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies  in  the  power  sector  in  India  have  been \ngenerally  successful  from  a  project  point  of  view;  i.e.,  the  projects  concerned  have  been \ncompleted,  although  with  implementation  delays,  and  performed  to  the  expected  technical \nlevels.  Although  operations  of  the  project  components,  taken  individually,  have  been \nsatisfactory,  the  overall  sector  performance,  in  terms  of  delivering  a  high  quality  and  reliable \npower  supply,  continued  to  deteriorate.  This  situation  was  primarily  on  account  of  (i) highly \ndistorted  tariff  setting  undermining  cost  recovery;  (ii) government  rules  and  regulations,  and \ngovernment  control  of  SEBs,  inhibiting  their  performance;  and  (iii) the noncommercial setup of \nthe  sector  that  failed  to  attract  private  sector  players  to  step  in  to  bridge  the  gap  between \ndemand  and  supply  or  into  other  operational  areas.    The  Government  and  other  key  players \nwere beginning to realize that unless the structural framework of the sector setup was modified \nto remove the above impediments, long-term sustainable improvements could not be achieved. \n \n14. \nThe  policy  reforms  required  for  comprehensive  sector  restructuring  could  not  be \nintroduced earlier for a number of reasons. First of all, the India power sector was not yet ready \nfor  reforms:  there  was  no  consensus  among  concerned  agencies  on  what  should  constitute \nreforms  until  the  adoption  of  the  Common  Minimum  National  Action  Plan,  and  the  necessary \nlegislation and financial incentive mechanisms were not in place. Most important, SEBs or their \nstate  governments  were  not  feeling  the  financial  crunch  as  they  do  now.  The  compelling \nreasons for power sector reforms are the SEB financial burden on state governments\u2019 budgets \nand the resulting shortage of funds for other development needs. It is therefore evident that the \nopportunity offered by these events be made use of to turn the sector around. \n \nThe  project  completion  report9  of  the  previous  loan  to  PFC  indicated  a  number  of \n15. \nlessons to be learned. These included (i) the need for com prehensive reforms and restructuring \nof  the  power  sector;  (ii) PFC\u2019s  limited  leverage  to  influence  the  states  to  adopt  key  policy \nchanges;  (iii) the  importance  of  compliance  with  loan  conditions  prior  to  subloan  approval; \n(iv) recommendations on financial  criteria  for  subproject  selection;  and  (v) the  need  to  have  a \nsufficiently  long  list  of  subprojects  before  loan  approval.  These  lessons  have  been  taken  into \nconsideration during the project design and the subsequent discussions with PFC. \n \n\n3. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operational Strategy \n\n16. \nADB\u2019s  overall  operational  strategy  for  India  consists  of  supporting  efforts  to  achieve \nhigher  sustainable  economic  growth  to  promote  employment  and  reduce  poverty.  Its \ncontribution  to  higher  growth  focuses  on  improving  supply-side  efficiency  of  the  economy, \nespecially  by  reducing  bottlenecks  in  key  infrastructure  sectors.  Emphasis  is  on  improving  the \npolicy,  institutional,  and  regulatory  framework  so  as  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  public  sector \noperations and to encourage private investment. \n \n17. \nADB's strategy for India was revised in 1996 to accommodate the need for a portion of \nits assistance to be provided in a systematic and comprehensive manner at the subnational or \nstate level. This need reflected the facts that (i) a geographic focus, together with the ongoing \nselective  sector  focus,  enables  ADB  to  maximize  its  development  impact  both  in  the  states \nconcerned  and,  through  the  demonstration  impact  of  its  operations,  in  other  states  as  well; \n(ii) state-level  economic \ntaken \nby the Government,  needed  support  and  incentives;  and  (iii) the  states  have  considerable \nautonomy  and  have  major  legislative,  administrative,  and  fiscal  responsibilities  in  many  of  the \neconomic  and  social  sectors.  Accordingly,  ADB  is  building  up  the  reform  process  from  the \ngrassroots by considering assistance to those states that have demonstrated the political will to        \n\nreforms,  which  have  been \n\nlagging  behind \n\ninitiatives \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2001. Project Completion Report on the Power Efficiency (Sector) Project. Manila.  \n\n\f6 \n\nsubstantially reform their public sector operations, and by assisting them to operationalize these \nreforms.  Gujarat,  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  Kerala  have  been  initially  identified  for  ADB\u2019s  holistic \nsupport.10 ADB-assisted power sector reforms in the first two states include adopting state-level \nreform bills, establishing and operationalizing independent regulatory bodies, unbundling sector \nentities along functional lines, rationalizing tariffs, and 100% metering of consumers. \n \n18. \nThe  proposed  loan  is  designed  to  complement  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  in  promoting \nreforms in more states. While  direct  assistance  to  the  power  sector  at  the  state  level  is  being \ncontinued,  with  Assam  being  considered  as  the  fourth  state,  assistance  through  suitable \nfinancial intermediaries is considered as a second option. PFC has been selected as the agent \nto leverage reforms since it is very active in state-level power sector reforms and it is also the \npremier development finance institution exclusively dedicated to the sector. Through PFC, ADB \nseeks to promote power sector reforms in a greater number of states than would otherwise be \npossible  by  direct  lending.  Such  an  approach  will  broaden  ADB's  association  with  state-level \npower  utilities  and  will  complement  the  Government's  own  efforts  at  power  sector  reforms \nthrough  mechanisms  such  as  the  Accelerated  Power  Development and Reform Program. The \nproposed  loan  will  also  mobilize  additional  resources  in  terms  of  counterpart  funds,  as  ADB \nlending will be limited to 60% of the subproject costs. \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Power Sector \n\nThe  power  sector  has  received  a  major  portion  of  India's  external  assistance.  For \n19. \nexample,  of  ADB\u2019s  total  government-guaranteed lending to India, amounting to  $10.317  billion \nas of 30 June 2002, 11 loans for $2.215 billion (21.5%) were approved for the power sector. The \nfirst four projects were for power generation, three were sector loans to support improvements \nin SEB efficiency and development of the national transmission grid, while the two most recent \nwere for sector development to support the restructuring of a state\u2019s power sector. In addition, \nunder  its  private  sector  operations,  ADB  has  approved  three  loans  and  investments  totaling \n$79.8 million for one captive transmission and two generation projects. Power subprojects have \nalso  been  considered  for  financing  under  ADB's  private  sector  infrastructure  facility  and  the \nInfrastructure  Development  Finance  Company.  ADB  has  also  approved  $12.9 million  for  21 \ntechnical assistance grants, mainly advisory, at both the national and state levels. Previous ADB \nassistance to India\u2019s power sector is listed in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n20. \nThe major funding source to the sector has been the World Bank, which  has supported \npower generation, transmission, and distribution projects, including assistance directed to SEBs. \nIt  is  now  supporting  power  sector  reforms  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  Orissa, \nRajasthan,  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  In  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh,  power  sector  reform  is \nviewed as part of overall reform of state finances. ADB coordinates with the World Bank on the \ngeographic demarcation of state-level operations, as well as to ensure overall complementarity \nof actions at both the central and state levels. Other major agencies funding the sector are the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  of  Germany, \nDepartment \nthe  United  Kingdom  (DFID),  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  (CIDA),  and  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment.  Although  the  combined  assistance  of  all  aid  agencies  constitutes  only  about  8\u2013\n10% of the total investments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have been catalyzed as \na result. \n \n\nInternational  Development  of \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n10  This support started with Loan 1506-IND: Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program  and Loan 1717-\nIND: Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program , each for $250 million, approved on 18 December \n1996 and 14 December 1999, respectively. They were followed by Loans 1803/1804-IND: Gujarat Power Sector \nDevelopment  and  Loans  1868/1869-IND:  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Development  Program , each for $350 \nmillion, approved on 13 December 2000 and 6 December 2001, respectively. \n\n\f7 \n\n21. \nThe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  been  supporting  the  expansion  of \npublic  sector  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution,  including  rural  electrification.  DFID\u2019s \nexclusive  objective  in  providing  assistance  is  poverty  reduction.  It  has  financed  studies  for \npower sector restructuring in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Orissa. The  United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  has  extensively  supported  and  continues  to  support  policy \naspects of private sector participation. It has supported studies for state sector reforms through \nPFC  by  providing  grant  assistance  for  energy  management,  conservation,  and  training.  CIDA \nassisted  Kerala  in  conducting  extensive  studies  for  restructuring  its  power  sector.  ADB  is \nfollowing  up  on  CIDA\u2019s  work  through  policy  dialogue  and  preparation  for  a  possible  loan \nintervention.  Together  with  the  World  Bank,  CIDA  is  providing  similar  TA  for  power  sector \nreforms  in  Andhra  Pradesh.  In  Madhya  Pradesh,  CIDA  and  ADB  are  cooperating  and \ncoordinating closely in providing assistance for power sector reform. Some of the major projects \nfinanced by other aid agencies are also listed in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n22. \nThe overall objective of the ADB assistance is to help improve the state power sector of \nIndia so that it becomes financially self-sustaining and capable of adequately providing its share \nof services to the country's economic and social development. The immediate objectives are to \n(i) promote  power  sector  reforms  in  a  few  selected  states,  (ii) help  establish  independent \nregulatory  bodies,  and  (iii) functionally  unbundle  the  sector  entities  so  that  they  become \ncommercially and operationally autonomous and efficient, and financially viable. To promote the \nachievement of these objectives, ADB will provide financial assistance, channeled through PFC, \nto  the  selected  SEBs  to  meet  part  of  their  financing  requirements for reducing system losses, \nenhancing  operational  flexibility  and  efficiency,  and  improving  the  delivery  of  services  to  the \nconsumers. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nSubborrowers \n\nSubborrowers will be selected from among SEBs11 based on written commitments by the \n23. \nconcerned state governments and SEBs to undertake power sector reforms. The main criterion \nfor eligibility will be the availability of a reform-oriented operational and financial action plan (R-\nOFAP) acceptable to PFC. The R-OFAPs may include a series of time-bound reform steps to be \ncarried  out  in  phases  (para. 31).  Each  R-OFAP  will  be  tailor-made  to  suit  the  state/SEB \nconcerned, taking into account the degree of reforms already undertaken by the state and other \nprevailing  conditions  in  the  power  sector  of  the  state.  Following  the  adoption  of  an  R-OFAP, \nPFC  will  review  the  investment  requirements  of  the  concerned  SEB  and  will  develop  an \nassistance plan linking specific reform steps to maximum borrowing limits for the SEB at various \nphases  of  the  reform  process.  PFC  will  then  submit  the  finalized  R-OFAP and the assistance \nplan to ADB prior to starting lending to the SEB under ADB\u2019s line of credit. The R-OFAPs will be \nfinalized in consultation with ADB. Any subsequent modifications or amendments will be notified \nto ADB. \n \n24. \nSEBs in the following states have been proposed as eligible subborrowers initially: West \nBengal, Maharashtra, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, and Karnataka. PFC will have the option of \nselecting  more  SEBs  during  loan  administration,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  should  the \n\n                                                 \n11  The  term  SEB  is  used  to  denote  state  electricity  boards  as  well  as  other  public  power  utilities  established  as  a \n\nresult of sector restructuring. \n\n\f8 \n\nsubprojects  already  identified  appear  to  be  inadequate  to  cover  the  total  loan  amount,  for  any \nreason. The main criterion for selecting further states/SEBs will remain the same: the availability \nof  an  agreed  R-OFAP.  Those  SEBs  that  are  already  receiving  assistance  from  ADB  or  the \nWorld Bank will not be entitled to the line of credit from PFC under the loan except as otherwise \nagreed with ADB. \n \n25. \nTo be selected, the SEBs will be required to show that they can achieve (i) at least a 3% \nROR on net fixed assets in service; and (ii) a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of at least 1.2 \ntimes, both within such period from the date of the first subloan as indicated in the respective R-\nOFAP. For this purpose, PFC will arrange to review financial projections for the candidate SEBs \nduring  selection  to  ensure  that  the  above  requirements  can  be  met.  In  order  to  ensure \ncommitment  and  ownership  of  the  subborrower  to  the  subprojects,  the  SEBs  will  also  be \nrequired  to  (i) commit  to  contribute  counterpart  funds  not  less  than  40%  of  the  cost  of  the \nsubproject;  and  (ii) indicate  satisfactory  performance  under  the  ongoing  subloans,  including \nmeeting targets under the R-OFAPs. The subproject appraisal reports, to be prepared for each \nsubproject by PFC, will assess whether they meet these criteria.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubprojects \n\nthat \n\nfollowing \n\nthe  R&M  works,  generating \n\n26.  While  the  shortage  of  power  generating  capacity  has  been  a  chronic  problem  in  India, \ninefficient  operation  of  existing  facilities  is  a  more  urgent  issue  that  needs  to  be  addressed  to \nimprove  sector  performance  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  The  loan  will  therefore  be  targeted \nmainly at those projects that will improve system operations and reduce system losses, such as \nrehabilitation of power transmission and distribution facilities. Financing will also be available for \nimproving  access  to  electricity  by  extending  transmission  and  distribution  networks.  R&M  of \nexisting  generating  facilities  that  are  required  to  achieve  compliance  with  environmental \nregulations  and  improve  efficiency  will  also  be  considered.  The  subborrowers  will  have  to \ndemonstrate \nfacilities  will  meet  applicable \nenvironmental  requirements  of  the  pollution  control  boards  of  the  relevant  state  and  other \nstatutory  bodies  concerned.  PFC  will  select  subprojects  categorized  as  resettlement  B  or  C \nonly.  New  generation  projects  or  projects  for  extension  of  generation  projects  will  not  be \nselected for subloans. \n \nBased  on  the  above,  the  following  categories  of  subprojects  will  be  considered  for \n27. \nfinancing  under  the  loan:  (i) transmission  and  distribution  rehabilitation,  (ii) transmission and \ndistribution  facilities  required  for  system  expansion  and  reinforcement,  and  (iii) renovation and \nmodernization  of  existing  generating  plants  that  are  required  for  achieving  compliance  with \nenvironmental regulations and efficiency improvement. \n \n28. \nSubprojects  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  (i) being  part  of  the  least-cost option for \nmeeting  the  project  objectives;  (ii) environmental  and  social  acceptability\u2014conforming  to \nrelevant  ADB  guidelines  and  having  obtained  relevant  statutory  clearances;  (iii) economic \nviability\u2014the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) being greater than 12%; and (iv) financial \nviability\u2014the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  being  greater  than  the  weighted  average \ncost of capital. The subproject appraisal reports, to be prepared for each subproject by PFC, will \nassess whether they meet these criteria. \n \n29. \nPFC\u2019s Projects Division has so far identified 22 projects in West Bengal, 16 projects in \nMaharashtra,  14  projects  in  Assam,  and  3  projects  in  Tamil  Nadu  consisting  of  transmission, \ndistribution,  and  R&M  of  existing  power  stations.  The  total  cost  of  these  identified  projects  is \nestimated  at  $392.7 million,  consisting  of  $235.6 million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and \n$157.1 million in local currency costs. A summary of costs is given in Table 2 and the details are \npresented in Appendix 3. \n \n\n\f9 \n\nTable 2: Estimated Cost of Identified Projects \n($ million) \n \n\nState \nWest Bengal \nAssam \nMaharashtra \nTamil Nadu \nTotal \n\nTotal Cost  \n65.9 \n18.2 \n266.7 \n41.9 \n392.7 \n\nForeign Cost  \n39.5 \n10.9 \n160.0 \n25.2 \n235.6 \n\nLocal Cost   \n26.4 \n7.3 \n    106.7 \n16.7 \n157.1 \n\n \nSource:  Power Finance Corporation \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nOperational  and  financial  action  plans  (OFAPs)  are  a  mechanism  devised  in  the  early \n30. \n1990s  to  monitor  the  performance  of  SEBs  borrowing  from  PFC.  Formulated  by  PFC  in \nconsultations with ADB and the World Bank during the processing of the previous loans to PFC, \nOFAPs  were  based  on  the  results  of  initial  diagnostic  studies  of  the  operational  and  financial \nsituation  of  individual  SEBs.  The  resulting  OFAPs  focused  on  technical  and  financial  remedial \nactions  to  improve  SEB  performance,  together  with  detailed  actions  for  accomplishing  such \nimprovements  in  a  time-bound  manner  by  action  centers  specifically  identified.  Key  elements \nincluded  improving  power  plant  performance;  reducing  system  losses;  adjusting  tariffs; \nimproving  billing  and  collections;  and  developing  and  streamlining  financial,  accounting,  and \nmanagement  information  systems.  PFC\u2019s  approval  of  a  loan  to  an  SEB  was  subject  to  the \nformal agreement of an OFAP. PFC then monitored the implementation of the OFAP as part of \nits loan administration activities. Although OFAPs were successful in bringing about operational \nimprovements  in  SEB  performance,  there  were  some  inherent  weaknesses  in  the  OFAP \nmechanism  as  applied  initially.  First,  the  action  plans  proposed  within  the  OFAPs  were \nconstrained  by  the  structural  framework  within  which  the  power  sector  operated.  Without \nstructural  reforms,  remedial  actions  could  not  be  implemented  in  a  sustainable  manner,  partly \ndue to political constraints. For example, in the absence of independent regulatory bodies, the \ntariff  adjustments  that  were  needed  to  reach  agreed  financial  performance  could  not  be \nimplemented  in  an  equitable  manner,  mainly  due  to  political  interference.  Second,  the  OFAPs \ncontained  too  many  performance  targets  and  the  modest  levels  of  investments  and  technical \nassistance  could  not  adequately  support them. Furthermore, OFAPS required much time and \neffort to monitor and enforce, and affected the smooth implementation of the supported projects. \n \n31. \nBased  on  the  lessons  learned,  the  OFAP  mechanism  has  been  improved.  Instead  of \nattempting  to  achieve  improved  performance  within  the  existing  structural  framework,  the \nframework itself will be restructured to facilitate remedial actions. The restructuring may include \nunbundling  SEB  operations  along  functional  lines,  setting  up  independent  regulatory  bodies  to \noversee  sector  operations  and  set  tariffs,  and  introducing  commercially  oriented  operational \ntechniques into distribution operations with performance targets. These actions are incorporated \ninto an R-OFAP. It is an action plan developed jointly by PFC, the SEB concerned, and its state \ngovernment, and agreed to by the three parties involved. A typical R-OFAP will consist of three \nor  four  phases.  Each  phase  will  contain  a  set  of  reform  tasks  to  be  accomplished  within  an \nagreed  time  frame.  The  reforms  will  include  (i) adopting  reform  measures  by  the  state \ngovernment, including a reform bill if considered necessary; (ii) establishing and operationalizing \nan  independent  SERC;  and  (iii) establishing  a  high-level  state  government  committee  to \noversee  the  reform  process  and  a  working-level  group  to  coordinate  the  reform  actions; \n(iv) formulating and filing proposals for tariff rationalization to obtain the SERC\u2019s rulings on the \nproposals; (v) implementing the SERC\u2019s tariff rulings in a time-bound manner; (vi) adopting and \ncontinuing the implementation of a policy on metering, with the eventual goal of 100% consumer \nmetering;  and  (vii) adopting  enhanced  measures  by  the  state  government  to  discourage \n\n\f10 \n\nelectricity theft by imposing penalties and other measures.  A  summary  of  a  typical  R-OFAP is \ngiven in Appendix 4. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n1. \n\nTerms and Conditions of the Loan \n\n2. \n\nRelending Terms and Arrangements \n\n \n32. \nPFC has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the Project. The loan will have a 20-year term including a grace period of 5 years, with \nrepayments  linked  to  actual  disbursements  under  the  Loan,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement. PFC has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n \n \n33. \nPFC  will  relend  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  to  eligible  subborrowers  for  subprojects \nthat ADB has agreed to. Subborrowers eligible to receive ADB funds will be only those meeting \nthe requirements set out in paras. 23 and 25. The subloans will have a maximum maturity of 15 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  not  exceeding  5  years  and  a  relending  rate  determined  in \naccordance with PFC's Operational Policy Statement (OPS) (Supplementary Appendix B). The \nADB  loan  will  be  used  only  to  finance  a  part  or  the  whole  of  the  direct  and  estimated  indirect \nforeign exchange components of subprojects and will be limited to 60% of the total subproject \ncost. In all other respects, PFC will relend ADB funds in accordance with its  OPS and individual \nR-OFAPs  agreed  with  the  eligible  subborrowers.12  The  funds  accumulated  from  shorter \nrelending maturity and grace periods may be used to finance other eligible subprojects. \n \n34. \nIn  order  to  achieve  the  maximum  possible  reform  impacts  without  spreading  ADB \nresources  too  thin,  it  was  agreed  that  the  maximum  lending  limit  for  any  single  subborrower \nwould  be  40%  of  the  total  ADB  loan  except  where  a  higher  limit  is  warranted  due  to  special \ncircumstances. PFC will obtain ADB\u2019s prior approval for such increases. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\na. \n\nExecuting Agency \n\nfor \n\nPFC will be the Executing Agency for the proposed loan. Its chairperson and managing \n35. \ndirector  will  be  responsible \nthe  Project.  Day-to-day \nthe  overall  management  of \nimplementation of the Project will be carried out by the relevant divisions under guidance from \ntheir respective directors as follows. Formulation and finalization of R-OFAPs, determination of \nmaximum lending limits for R-OFAP milestones, and monitoring of their compliance will be the \nresponsibility of the Institutional Appraisal and Development Division; appraisal and approval of \nsubprojects and monitoring of their implementation, including procurement activities, will be the \nresponsibility  of  the  Projects  Division.  The  Externally  Aided  Projects  Unit  (EAPU)  will  be \n                                                 \n12  As per the OPS, the structure of interest rates to be charged by PFC would be as attractive as possible without \nendangering its own operations or overall objectives. The structure would, in general, be dependent on the cost of \nraising resources and the state of the financial markets. In certain areas, assistance may be provided on softer \nterms  wherever  promotional  and  development  requirements  so  demand.  The  interest  rate  structure  would  be \nreviewed from time to time. \n\n\f11 \n\nresponsible for assessing the environmental and social feasibility of subprojects and monitoring \nthe implementation of environmental and social impact mitigation measures. EAPU, through its \nEnvironmental  Assessment  and  Monitoring  Cell,  will  also  be  responsible  for  monitoring \nresettlement  preparation  and  implementation.  The  Head,  EAPU  will  be  responsible  for  overall \ncoordination and execution of the Project, and for liaising between PFC and ADB.  A description \nof  PFC,  its  operations,  and  its  financial  performance  are  given  in  Appendix  5.  PFC's \norganization chart is in Appendix 6. \n \n36. \nPFC's operational philosophy and procedures are guided by its OPS. Developed in 1990 \nin  close  consultation  with  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  and  since  then  revised  to  reflect  recent \nchanges  in  the  India  power  sector,  the  OPS  provides  a  comprehensive  set  of  guidelines  for \npower sector lending. It defines PFC\u2019s mission and objectives and sets out guidelines for project \nidentification, eligibility, lending modalities, exposure limits, guarantees and security, and project \nadministration  including  procurement  procedures.  It  also  specifies  limits  for  key  financial \nparameters,  such  as  return  on  equity  and  DSCR,  to  ensure  PFC\u2019s  own  financial  health  while \nlending  to  others.  The  key  features  of  the  revised  OPS  are  (i) emphasis  on  power  sector \nreforms  in  addition  to  project-based  lending;  (ii) provision  of  other  services  such  as  consulting \nand advisory services, foreign exchange management, and lender's engineering services; and \n(iii) assistance to private sector projects. A summary of the OPS is in Supplementary Appendix \nB. \n \nOver the past 5 years,  from FY1998 to FY2002, PFC\u2019s financial performance has been \n37. \non  a  sound  level.  PFC  has  exceeded  all  the  financial  performance  targets13  agreed  with  the \nMinistry of Power every year for this period. Both the return on assets and the return on equity \nin FY2002 indicate adequate profitability of 5.0% and 20.4%, respectively. The DSCRs are also \nhigher than the minimum  1.2 times. PFC\u2019s  capital position,  as  measured   by its risk-weighted  \ncapital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR),14  was  25.6%  in  FY2002,  which  is  superior  by  international \nstandards.15  The  financial  position  of  PFC  has  stabilized  for  a  combination  of  reasons.  First, \nPFC  continuously  expanded  its  loan  size  to  support  the  growing  investment  needs  of  India\u2019s \npower sector. Second, nonperforming loans amounting to about Rs7.5 billion were restructured \nbetween  FY1997  and  FY2000  and  as  a  result,  PFC  was  able  to  improve  cash  generation. \nConsequently,  PFC  has  maintained  high  overdue  recovery  rates  of  97\u2013100%  since  FY1998. \nThird,  funding  cost  has  been  relatively  low  due  to  PFC\u2019s  access  to  tax-free  bonds,  tax \nexemption  on  loans  to  infrastructure  projects,  and  external  borrowing  with  government \nguarantees.  A  summary  of  PFC\u2019s  actual  financial  performance  is  given  in  Table  3  and  details \nare in Appendix 7.  \n \n\n                                                 \n13  At  the  end  of  every  financial  year,  PFC  and  the  Ministry  of  Power  prepare  a  memorandum  of  understanding \n(MOU)  agreement  to  set  financial  targets,  e.g.,  sanctions,  disbursements,  collection, return on assets, return on \nequity, operating ratio.  \n\n14  The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is the ratio of total qualified capital (equity [Tier I] plus mezzanine capital [Tier II, \nIII]) to total risk-weighted assets including off-balance sheet items. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates the \nrequirements and standards based on types of financial institutions.  However, PFC has been exempted from the \nrequirements.  Accordingly,  the  calculation  of  CAR  is  based  on  RBI  norms  for  nonbanking  financial  companies . \nWhen CAR was calculated on the two standard norms, RBI and BIS, the difference between the two values was \nless than 0.5% for 2001. \n\n15  The Basel Accord of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) recommends a mandatory CAR of 8% for banks \nin  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. For most developing member \ncountries (DMCs), the guidelines recommend a minimum CAR of 12%. \n\n\f12 \n\nTable 3.

PFC\u2019s  profitability  is  likely  to  remain acceptable \nover the near term due to the strong demand for funds from the state power sector as well as \nfrom the central power utilities. Although aggressive expansion of the loan portfolio will result in \na  gradual  decline  of  its  capital  position  and  profitability  of  its  assets,  PFC  is  still  expected  to \ndemonstrate  sound  financial  performance.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  PFC\u2019s  financial \nposition will depend on its internal risk control. First, PFC will be exposed to more market risks \nby  increased  market  borrowing  and  foreign  currency  funding,  and  by  decreased  government \nsupport,16 such as tax-free bonds, equity contributions, and regulatory exemptions. Second, in \nthe  event  that  interest  yields  are  lower  due  to  a  competitive  financial  market  in  the  near term, \nPFC\u2019s  other  revenue  sources  besides  the  intermediary  service  are  likely  to  be  limited.17 \nFurthermore,  PFC\u2019s  profitability  might  be  eroded  by  the  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  the  SEB \nloan portfolio. Therefore, over the long term, PFC will be required to conduct timely risk control \nand  thorough  asset-liability  management  justified  by  an  increase  in  the  stable  funding  base  at \nacceptable  costs  as  well  as  by  profit  opportunities.  A  summary  of  PFC\u2019s  projected  financial \nperformance is given in Table 4 and details are in Appendix 7. Assumptions made in preparing \nthe financial projections are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n                                                 \n16  Government support, in the form of direct loans or tax-free bonds, has substantially declined over the years [(e.g., \n58% (FY1999) to 15% (FY2002)]. Particularly, the Government has made no direct loans since FY2001. There are \nno other explicit subsidies involved in PFC\u2019s lending operations. \n\n17  Besides  its  core  lending  business,  PFC  has  been  starting  fee-based services, such as engineering consultancy \n\nservices. \n\n\f13 \n\nTable 4.

They  are  reviewed  by \nqualified  statutory  external  auditors18  appointed  by  the  Government.  PFC  also  has  an  internal \naudit system that appears to be broadly commensurate with the size and nature of its business. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSubproject Selection and Appraisal \n\n40. \nSubprojects  will  be  selected  from  the  eligible  categories  of  projects  listed  in  para.  27, \nbased on detailed project reports submitted by the subborrowers. Subproject appraisal reports \nwill  then  be  prepared  by  PFC,  according  to  the  format  outlined  in  PFC\u2019s  Outline and Guiding \nPrinciples  for  Project-Loan  Appraisal  Reports. Approval procedures will follow PFC's standard \npractices  for  project  appraisal  and  approval.  Approval  of  a  subproject  will  be  subject  to \n(i) meeting the economic, financial, and environmental and social acceptance criteria as set out \nin para. 28; and (ii) not exceeding the borrowing limit assigned to the subborrower at that stage \nof the reform process. \n \nThe borrowing limit of a subborrower at any given stage will be governed by the R-OFAP \n41. \nmechanism. Each major milestone in the R-OFAP will be linked to a maximum borrowing limit \nfor that milestone  as indicated in para. 23. Subprojects will be approved within this applicable \nborrowing  limit  of  the  subborrower  at  any  given  time.  In  order  to  raise  the  limit,  the \nsubborrower/state government will have to satisfactorily complete the reform tasks specified for \nthe  next  phase.  If  a  particular  phase  of  the  R-OFAP  is  not  completed  within  the  time  frame \nagreed  upon,  PFC  may,  with  ADB's  concurrence,  divert  loan  funds  to  a  better  performing \nsubborrower. The maximum borrowing limit, the corresponding R-OFAP milestone, and the time \nframe for achieving that will be determined at the stage of selecting the subborrower as outlined \nin para. 23. A flowchart indicating the detailed subproject approval procedure is in Appendix 8. \n\n \n\nc. \n\nSubproject Approval \n\n42. \nThe first subproject for each SEB will be submitted to ADB for review prior to approval by \nPFC  to  ensure  that  ADB's  guidelines  on  procurement,  environmental  and  social  assessment, \nand economic and financial analyses, as well as the terms and conditions of the ADB loan are \nfollowed. Thereafter, only subprojects exceeding $10 million in ADB financing will require prior \nreview  by  ADB.  However,  irrespective  of  this  limit,  prior  review  by  ADB  will  be  required  for \nfinancing any subproject that either involves significant environmental impacts or resettlement. \n \n\n                                                 \n18  The  recent  minor  qualifications  by  auditors  in  FY2002  have  been  resolved.  The  qualifications  were \n(i) understatement of Rs1.5 crore profit, consequent to the change in accounting policy in respect of provision for \nleave encashment and (ii) an excess future claim from the Government with respect to the interest subsidy fund \naccount.  \n\n\f14 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n43. \nThe Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years, commencing in January 2003. \nThe commitment period during which PFC will continue to approve subprojects will be limited to \nthe first 4 years. Disbursements for the approved subprojects will continue until the end of the \nfifth year. A project implementation schedule is given in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  follow  provisions \n44. \napplicable  to  development  finance  institutions  in  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  For \ncontracts valued at $5 million or more, subborrowers will follow international competitive bidding \nprocedures.  For  contracts  below  $5 million,  PFC  will  ensure  that  competitive  and  transparent \nprocedures  will  be  followed  by  the  subborrowers  in  prequalifying  bidders,  evaluating  bids,  and \nawarding contracts, with due consideration of economy and efficiency. Procurement will be from \nADB member countries only. \n \nADB  management  has  approved  advanced  procurement  action.  PFC  and  the \n45. \nsubborrowers  have  been  permitted  to  initiate  procurement  procedures  for  eligible  subprojects, \nsuch  as  preparation  of  draft  bidding  documents  and  submission  of  the  documents  for  review \nand approval by ADB after loan appraisal.  \n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n46. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  finance  eligible  subprojects  in  accordance  with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, January 2001,  as amended from time to time. For ease \nof  loan  disbursements,  the  Borrower  may  set  up  an  imprest  account with a local commercial \nbank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and \nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. The imprest account will \nhave a ceiling of 6 months projection and not more than 10% of the loan.  \n \n47. \nPFC has opted for repayments linked to disbursements under the Loan in accordance with \nthe Policy on Review of ADB\u2019s Financial Loan Products.19  Accordingly the Loan will comprise of  \na series of amortization schedules based on aggregate disbursements under the Loan, for each \nsemestral period with a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years schedule.20  The final \nmaturity date under the Loan is fixed at 15 October 2028 applicable to the disbursements made \nduring the last semester of the loan closing date at 30 June 2008.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n48. \nPFC will require subborrowers to maintain separate subloan accounts and records in a \nmanner  that  facilitates  assessment  of  the  performance  of  each  of  its  subprojects.  PFC  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  these  subloan  accounts  when  required  by  ADB.  PFC  will  also  submit  to  ADB \nunaudited  financial  statements  of  subborrowers  within  9  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial \nyear, and audited financial statements within 12 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n49. \nPFC  will  submit  to  ADB,  within  9  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  audited \nfinancial  statements  of  PFC  consisting  of  an  income  statement,  balance  sheet,  and  cash  flow \nstatement (audited by an auditor acceptable to ADB), financial projections, and portfolio reports \nshowing asset quality and capital adequacy in the form and complying with criteria requested by \nADB,  and  within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  unaudited  financial  statements  of \n\n                                                 \n19  R79-01, Revision 1, Final dated 19 June 2001. \n20 R79-01, Revision 1, Final dated 19 June 2001, paragraphs 42-26. \n\n\f15 \n\nPFC.  Before  31  December  of  each  year,  PFC  will  review  its  ability  and  meet  its  financial \nobligations  and  take  necessary  steps  to  meet  with  such  requirements  under  the  Loan.  A \nconsolidated  progress  report  will  be  prepared  for  each  subborrower  and  its  subprojects  and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  on  a  6-monthly  basis.  The  report  will  cover  (i) compliance  with  R-OFAPs, \n(ii) appraisal  of  subprojects,  (iii) implementation  of  subprojects,  (iv) subproject compliance with \nADB's  social  and  environmental  guidelines,  (v) progress  on  commitment and disbursement of \nfunds,  and  (vi) such  other  information  as  may  be  reasonably  required  for  ADB  to  monitor  the \nuse of loan proceeds. A project completion report, covering all major aspects of loan utilization \nand  subproject  implementation,  will  be  submitted  within  6  months  of  the  closing  of  the  loan \naccounts of each subborrower and within six months of closing of the Loan. \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nPFC,  with  the  assistance  of  the  subborrowers,  will  carry  out  project  performance \n50. \nmonitoring and evaluation and benefit monitoring and evaluation through periodic reviews of the \nsubprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  Systems  Handbook. \nFor this purpose, PFC will compile and analyze socioeconomic and other appropriate data such \nas  the  number  of  beneficiaries,  tariff  levels,  and  institutional  improvements  of  the  borrowing \nentities as well as of the subprojects concerned. The appraisal report for each subproject and \nthe initial social assessment reports for each state will provide the baseline data, which will be \nupdated through the periodic reviews. The findings of these reviews and supporting data will be \nincorporated into a project completion report for each state. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  throughout  project  implementation.  In  particular,  a \n51. \nmidterm  review  covering  the  entire  scope  of  the  Project  will  be  conducted  during  mid  2005  to \ndetermine  whether  any  adjustments  to  the  implementation  of  the  R-OFAP  mechanism, \nprocurement procedures, and project management arrangements are required. \n \n52. \nPFC,  on  its  part,  will  also  carry  out  regular  project  reviews  of  its  subborrowers.  These \nreviews  will  cover  procurement,  availability  of  counterpart  funds,  project  implementation \nprogress,  and  implementation  of  the  R-OFAP  for  each  subborrower.  The  findings  of  these \nreviews will be consolidated into a semiannual progress report for each subborrower and will be \nsubmitted to ADB. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\nThe financial health of many of the SEBs has been deteriorating due to insufficient cost \n53. \nrecovery.  Inadequate  tariffs  and  high  operating  costs  have  squeezed  their  profit  margins. \nFurthermore,  low  collection  of  receivables,  high  T&D  losses,  and  unpaid  state  government \nsubsidies  (to  compensate  for  free  power  supply  to  agricultural  or  domestic  customers)  have \naccelerated SEBs\u2019 financial difficulties. The Planning Commission of India estimates the SEBs\u2019 \nlosses  at  Rs248  billion  ($5.174  billion)  and  uncovered  subsidy  outstanding  at  Rs290  billion \n($6.037 billion) for FY2002. Consequently, most of the SEBs are now being restructured under \nvarious  initiatives  in  order  to  achieve  financial  viability  and  improve  operational  efficiency.  The \nproposed loan will be utilized to support the reform-minded states and their SEBs. First, the loan \nconditions  require  recipient  states  to  undertake  reforms  including  tariff  rationalization  through \nSERCs,  which  will  help  generate  financial  profits.  Second,  as  the  subloans  focus  on  system \nimprovement through rehabilitation, modernization, and upgrading of transmission, distribution, \nand generation infrastructure, as well as on metering, the subprojects will contribute to financial \n\n\f16 \n\nrecovery  through  increased  efficiency,  lower  T&D  losses,  and  better  metering and collections. \nAll these improvements are expected to improve the financial condition of the assisted agencies \nand minimize financial risks. \n \n54. \nThe indirect benefits attributable to the proposed loan are substantial. For example, tariff \nrationalization by independent regulatory bodies will result in more equitable tariff levels across \nconsumer  categories,  leading  to  efficient  allocation  of  financial  and  economic  resources. \nImprovements  in  the  quality  of  power  supply  will  enhance  agricultural  production  and  will \ndiscourage the use of inefficient captive power generation by agricultural and certain industrial \nconsumers.  Improvement  of  the  financial  position  of  utilities  will  reduce  the  burden  on  state \ngovernment budgets for subsidies and will enable them to allocate more budgetary resources to \nother needy sectors of the economy such as education, health, and rural infrastructure. Finally, \nthe  independent  tariff  decisions  by  the  SERC  and  a  stable  power  supply  through  system \nimprovements will encourage more private sector participation both in the power sector and in \nother parts of the economy. \n \nB. \n\nProject Impacts \n\n1. \n\nSocial \n\n55. \nPFC's precondition for selecting eligible SEBs is the availability of an R-OFAP (Appendix \n4)  that  outlines  the  reform  steps  and  social  aspects  of  reforms.  For  example,  the  R-OFAP \nprepared  for  the  West  Bengal  State  Electricity  Board  describes  the  functions  of  the  SEB; \nrequirements  for  electrification  in  rural  and  urban  areas  as  well  as  for  different  consumer \ncategories; unbundling of SEB operations; SEB financial management; rationalization of tariffs; \nservices to poor and vulnerable groups and to agricultural consumers; and management of tariff \nsubsidies. Recommendations regarding proposed reforms are under the management of a high-\nlevel steering committee. R-OFAP recognizes the need to provide services at affordable prices \nto the poor and to disadvantaged groups. R-OFAP also identifies the need to address this issue \nand  the  state  government's  responsibility  to  reimburse  the  SEB  for  any  subsidies.  The West \nBengal  State  Electricity  Board  has  set  up  a  task  force  to  address  the  impacts  of  reform, \nincluding human resources impacts of reorganizing the power sector. Similar approaches will be \nundertaken by each state government and their respective  SEBs. A  summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy form is attached as Appendix 10. \n \n56. \nADB  has  agreed  with  PFC  on  procedures  to  screen  and  classify  subprojects.  To \nfacilitate the screening process, screening forms and a flow-chart for triggering actions by PFC \nwere developed by ADB staff. PFC\u2019s newly established EAPU will be responsible for managing \nsocial  issues,  including  resettlement.  Additional  staff  have  been  assigned  to  EAPU  to  ensure \nthat  adequate  human  resources  are  available.  PFC  and  SEB  staff  participated  in  a  training \nprogram  on  environment  and  resettlement  administered  by  ADB  staff.  PFC  staff  will  receive \nfurther  training  on  resettlement  through  the  India  Resident  Mission\u2019s  training  program, \nspecifically designed for development finance institutions. PFC confirmed that only subprojects \nwith insignificant resettlement will be financed; subprojects therefore fall within categories B and \nC only. Any subproject in category A that may be considered for financing will not be included \nwithout prior  consent  from  ADB.  A  resettlement  framework  is  attached  in  Appendix  11.  Loan \ncovenants will be included to ensure that short resettlement plans are forwarded to ADB prior to \nthe award of civil works contracts. PFC will monitor resettlement but ADB will reserve the right \nto monitor subprojects. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental \n\n57. \nThe types of subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan vary from rehabilitation \nof transmission and distribution facilities, expansion of transmission and distribution systems, to \n\n\f17 \n\nrenovation  and  modernization  of  existing  generating  plants.  Under  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Requirements, the subprojects could fall under environment category B or C. It has \ntherefore  been  agreed  between  ADB  and  PFC  that  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE) \nreport be prepared for each subproject that is categorized as a \"B\" project, in accordance with \nthe  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements.  In  addition,  each  R&M  subproject  will  need  an \nIEE  report.  An  environmental  review  procedure  was  developed  by  ADB  staff  and  agreed  with \nPFC to be implemented. The procedure includes screening and approval of subprojects and is \npresented in Appendix 12. \n \nA  summary  IEE  of  a  typical  subproject  representing  a  transmission  and  distribution \n58. \nproject is given in Appendix 13. The summary IEE shows that the environmental impacts will be \nminimal  and  temporary.  These  impacts  are  mostly  related  to  land  clearing  activities  and \ntransport of construction equipment to the subproject area. The proposed mitigation measures \nidentified by the IEE are manageable and are mostly related to the contractor\u2019s obligations. The \nmitigation  measures  under  the  proposed  management  plan  will  be  covenanted  by  PFC  in  its \nloan  agreement  with  the  concerned  subborrower.  Although  the  environmental  impacts  of \nsubprojects  will  be  minimal,  regular  monitoring \nimplementation  of \nenvironmental management plans will be carried out by PFC, particularly for subprojects where \npolychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) has been used in the past. \n \nC. \n\nto  ensure  proper \n\nProject Risks \n\n59. \nThe main risk is the financial viability of the SEBs and hence of PFC. PFC\u2019s asset quality \nis vulnerable to the poor creditworthiness of its SEB clients. PFC has attempted to mitigate this \ncredit  risk  by  securing  its  loans  through  escrow  account  arrangements and state government \nguarantees. Escrow account arrangements cover 1.25 times the present and future debt service \nof  SEBs  owing  money  to  PFC.  PFC  assesses  escrowable  capacity  of  an  SEB  based  on  the \nfuture  cash  flow  in  the  \u201cwith  reform\u201d  scenario.  Therefore,  loans  to  an  SEB  could  be  under-\ncollateralized  if  reforms  do  not  produce  the  incremental  cash  flow  as  projected.  This  risk  is \nexpected  to  be  mitigated  by  state  government  guarantees.  In  addition,  to  avoid  this  risk,  PFC \nneeds to select subborrowers based strictly on the proposed R-OFAP mechanism and to ensure \ntimely  risk  control  management.  The  Asset-Liability  Management  Committee  that  was \nestablished within PFC in December 2001 is expected to ensure such risk control management, \nincluding  appropriate  resource  mobilization  to  bridge  the  liquidity  gap,  currency  exchanges, \ncurrency variations, and market fluctuations, thereby ensuring stable funding and profitability.21 \nIn  addition,  PFC  will  need  to  monitor  and  control  loan  portfolio  quality,  its  proper  provisioning, \nand the resulting capital adequacy in a recurrent manner. These efforts will minimize the risks \nassociated with PFC as a borrower. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  PFC  have  given  the \n\n60. \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nA. \n\nGeneral \n\n(i) \n\nPFC will carry out its operations in accordance with the OPS adopted by \nits board of directors. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n21  To meet liabilities due to currency depreciation, PFC has maintained a separate trust fund, the Exchange Risk \nAdministration  Fund,  since  1994.  In  2001,  PFC  also  started  hedging  interest  rate  and  exchange  risks  through \nswaps. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFinancial \n\nB. \n\n \nC. \n\nResettlement \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n  \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nPFC  will  not  lend  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  to  any  subborrower \nwithout a finalized R-OFAP or other eligibility criteria satisfactory to PFC. \n\nPFC  will  not  preallocate  ADB  funds  among  borrowers  or  states  but  will \nlend  strictly  in  accordance  with  eligibility  and  exposure  criteria  set  out  in \nits OPS and lending limits established using the R-OFAP mechanism. \n\nFor financing under the ADB loan, except as otherwise agreed with ADB, \nPFC  will  not  select  subprojects  (a) from subborrowers already receiving \nassistance  from  ADB  or  the  World  Bank  or  (b) that  involve  new \ngeneration projects or extension of existing generation projects. \n\n(v) \n\nPFC  will  ensure  that  EAPU  is  fully  functional  and  adequately  staffed \nthroughout the implementation of the Project. \n\nPFC  will  maintain  a  DSCR  of  not  less  than  1.2  and  a  capital adequacy \nratio based on new prudential norms, of not less than 12%. \n\nExcept  as  otherwise  agreed  by  ADB,  PFC  will  maintain  (a) a  net  profit \nbefore tax to beginning value of its equity (where equity includes reserves \nand \n(b) liquid \ninvestments/lines of credit adequate to meet projected disbursements. \n\nretained  earnings)  of  not \n\nthan  15%  and \n\nless \n\nPFC  will  adopt  the  formulated  new  prudential  norms  (including  asset \nclassification,  provisioning,  capital  adequacy,  risk  assessments,  and \nasset-liability  management)  within  the  time  frame  as  agreed  with  the \nGovernment as soon as available and not later than March 2003. \n\nPFC will ensure through the subloan agreements that (a) the subprojects \nare  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  ADB's  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement and where applicable ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples, \n(b)  the  resettlement  framework  will  form  the  basis  for  preparing \nresettlement  plans  for  each  subproject  that  has  land  acquisition  and/or \nresettlement  impacts,  and  (c)  all  efforts  are  made  to  avoid  or  minimize \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts.  \n\nPrior  to  selecting  a  subborrower,  PFC  will  prepare  a  social  impact \nassessment  for  the  respective  eligible  state  to  assess  social  impacts  of \nreforms and the subprojects financed under the loan.  \n\nPFC  will  only  select  subprojects  that  are  classified  as  B  or  C  in \naccordance with the resettlement framework. For subprojects that involve \nland  acquisition  or  resettlement,  the  initial  screening  checklist  for \ninvoluntary resettlement and the initial social and poverty screening form \nwill be submitted. \n\nPFC will ensure that (a) civil works contracts will not be awarded until a \nresettlement  plan  as  agreed  between  ADB,  PFC,  and  the  subborrower \nhas  been  approved;  and  (b)  works  will  not  commence  until  after  the \nsubborrower  acquires  the  land  and  rights  to  the  land,  free  from  any \n\n\f \nEnvironment \n\nD. \n\n19 \n\nencumbrances.  A  compliance  memorandum  indicating  compliance  with \nADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, signed by the Head, EAPU will \nbe  forwarded  to  ADB  along  with  the  resettlement  plan.  PFC  will  also \nsubmit  6-monthly  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  with  regard  to  land \nacquisition and resettlement under the subprojects. \n\nPFC  will  not  select  subprojects  (a)  where  litigation  is  ongoing  or  where \ncompensation  payments  are  outstanding;  or  (b)  that  are  category  A  in \naccordance with ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement or projects that \nindigenous \naffect  more \npeoples/scheduled tribes.  \n\nindividuals  belonging \n\nthan  100 \n\nto \n\nPFC will designate one staff member within EAPU to be responsible for \nof \nhandling \nresettlement  plans  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement \nimplementation.  \n\nresettlement-related \n\npreparation \n\nincluding \n\nissues, \n\n(vii)  PFC  will  ensure  that  subprojects  that  require  resettlement  plans  will  be \nprepared and implemented in consultation with affected persons and that \nresettlements  plans  are  disclosed  to  the  public.  The  mechanisms  for \ndisclosure will be discussed in the resettlement plan. PFC will be guided \nby ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Assessment and  Handbook \non Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. \n\nPFC  will  ensure  through  subloan  agreements  that  all  subprojects  (a) \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements and the IEE \nand  (b) are  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Environmental \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. \n\nPFC  will  be  responsible  for  reviewing  the  IEE  of  all  subprojects  with  an \ninvestment  cost  of  less  than  $10 million  and  for  formulating  the  relevant \ncovenants for the same under the subloan agreements.  \n\nPFC  will  forward  to  ADB  for  approval,  IEE  reports  for  all  subprojects (a) \nthat have significant impacts or (b) that have a capital cost of more than \n$10 million.  PFC  will  include  in  the  subloan  agreements  required \nenvironmental covenants as recommended by ADB for these subprojects. \n\nPFC will not select subprojects that  (a)  are  environment  category  A  and \nsensitive  category  B,  as  per  ADB's  Environmental  Assessment \nRequirements  or  (b)  involve  capacity  expansion  of  coal-based  power \nplants  except  where  appropriate  clean  technology  and  pollution  control \nmeasures are adopted by the SEB. \n\nPFC  will  undertake  an  environmental  monitoring  program  to  ensure  that \neach of its borrowers implements all mitigation measures as stated in the \nrelevant IEE report. \n\nPFC will ensure that environmental aspects of all subprojects are properly \ndocumented and made available to the public if requested. \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f20 \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n61. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $150,000,000  to  the  Power  Finance \nCorporation Limited, India to be guaranteed by India, for the State Power Sector Reform Project \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  20  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  with \nrepayments  linked  to  actual  disbursements  under  the  Loan,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and \nGuarantee Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n19 November  2002 \n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nPerformance \nIndicators/Targets \nviable \nFinancially \nstate-level \npower \nutilities,  achieving  a \n3% \nminimum \nreturn  on  net  fixed \nassets  as  mandated \nby law. \n \n \n\u2022 \n\nof \n\n Sector \nrestructured \n\nDesign Summary \n\nGoal \nTo \nimprove  power \nsector  operations  at \nthe state level. \n \n\n \nPurpose \nSupport \nthe \nestablishment  of  a \ncommercially \noriented, \nfinancially \nviable,  and  efficient \npower sector. \n \n\n\u2022  Annual \n\nreports  of \n\n \n\npower utilities \n\n\u2022  Annual Report of the \n\nPlanning \nCommission  on  the \nworking \nstate \nelectricity boards.  \n\nof \n\n \n \n\u2022  Reform-oriented \noperational and \nfinancial action plans \n(R-OFAPs) \n\n\u2022  Official notification of \nregistration of new \nentities \n\n \n \n\u2022  Continued \n\ncommitments to \nreforms by the state \ngovernment. \n\n \n\u2022  Political will \n\n\u2022 \n\nIndependent and \ntransparent sector \nregulation \n\n\u2022  R-OFAPs \n\u2022  Adoption of a reform \n\n\u2022  State government's \n\ncommitment to reforms \n\nact or policy \nstatement \n\n \n\n\u2022  Depoliticized tariff \n\n\u2022  State \n\nElectricity \n\nsetting \n\nRegulatory \nCommission  (SERC) \nestablished \n\n \nOutputs \nEstablishment of new \nsector entities \n \n\n \n \n\u2022 Sector restructuring \n\nplan adopted \n\n \n\u2022 Segregation of \n\nassets and liabilities \n\n \n \n\u2022  R-OFAPs \n\u2022  Official \nby \nthe \ngovernment \n\n \n\u2022 R-OFAPs \n\nnotification \nstate \n\n\u2022  State government's \ncommitment to \nreforms \n\n \n \n\u2022  Cooperation \nemployees \nagencies \nrestructured \n\nfrom \nthe \nbe \n\nof \nto \n\n \n\u2022  Continued assistance \nby Power Finance \nCorporation (PFC) and \nthe state government. \n\n \n\u2022 Appointment of \n\nboard of directors \n\n \n\u2022 Official notification by \nthe state government \n\n \n\u2022  Political \n\nconsiderations \n\n\fMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\n\u2022 R-OFAPs \n\u2022 Progress reports from \n\nthe newly created \nagencies \n\n \n\u2022 R-OFAPs \n\u2022 Progress reports from \n\nnew agencies \n\n \n\u2022 Signed memorandums \n\n of understanding \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\u2022 Cooperation from \n\npersonnel affected by \nthe transfers \n\n \n\u2022 Commitment \n\nstate government. \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n \n\u2022 Commitment to continue \nreforms  by \nthe  state \ngovernment  and  new \nagencies \n\n \n \n\u2022  State government \n\nbudget \n\n \n \n\u2022  State government's \n\ncommitment \n\n \n\u2022  SERC publications \n\n \n\u2022  SERC publications \n\n \n\u2022  Regulatory risk \n   -

Electricity  is  one  of  the  key  inputs  for  India's  overall \nsocioeconomic  development,  especially  in  commercial  and  industry  sectors,  and  has  strong \nlinkages  to  other  infrastructure  elements,  such  as  transport  and  telecommunications.  Basic \nhuman needs, such as water supply and sewerage, and many social welfare activities, such as \neducation  and  health  care,  are  also  directly  or  indirectly  supported  by  electricity  supply. \nAlthough  India's  power  sector  has  seen  impressive  growth  with,  for  example,  generation \ncapacity increasing from 2,000 megawatts (MW) in 1950 to 105,000 MW in 2002, it still suffers \nfrom  severe  deficiencies.  These  include  chronic  power  shortages,  unacceptably  high  system \nlosses, poor supply reliability, and highly inefficient utility operations. \n \nEarlier attempts, during the 1980s and early 1990s by the Government, multilateral and \n2. \nbilateral aid agencies, and state governments to rectify these deficiencies have had only limited \nsuccess. Attempts were often piecemeal, directed at micro-level corrections within the existing \ninstitutional  framework,  and  lacked  a  holistic  approach  to  address  the  basic  power  sector \nproblems. It is now being realized that comprehensive sector reforms, supported by investments \ntargeted  to  remove  technical  and  institutional  bottlenecks,  are  essential  to  improve  the \nperformance of the sector.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Sector Setup \n\n1. \n\nOrganization \n\nIndia  consists  of  29  states  and  six  union  territories  with  a  total  population  of  over \n3. \n1 billion. The organization of the power sector is determined by the country's federal structure. \nThe  subject  of  electricity  is  covered  under  the  Concurrent  List  in  the  Constitution  of  India, \nimplying  that  both  the  central  Government  and  state  governments  have  the  power  to  make \nlegislation  for  the  sector.  As  a  result,  all  major  issues  affecting  the  power  sector  require \nconcurrent  action  by  the  central  Government  and  state  governments.  The  Government's \nMinistry  of  Power  provides  overall  guidance  to  the  sector  through  the  Central  Electricity \nAuthority. The recently established Central Electricity Regulatory Commission is empowered to \nregulate  the  central  power  utilities  in  accordance  with  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission \nAct, 1998. The central power utilities include the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), \nthe  National  Hydroelectric  Power  Corporation  (NHPC),  and  the  Nuclear  Power  Corporation \n(NPC), which are engaged in generation, and the Powergrid Corporation, which is engaged in \ninterstate power transmission. The Government also owns financing institutions devoted solely \nto  power  sector  lending  such  the  Power  Finance  Corporation  Limited  (PFC)  and  the  Rural \nElectrification  Corporation.  Recently, \nthe  Power  Trading \nCorporation, to be responsible for power trading among states and between states and central \npower utilities. \n \n4. \nAt  the  state  level,  the  state  governments  control  the  sector  through  21  state  electricity \nboards (SEBs)1 and 14 electricity departments (EDs). These SEBs and EDs are responsible for \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution,  usually  within  their  own  states  and  territories.  The \n\nthe  Government  established \n\n                                                 \n1  Seven of these SEBs have been restructured into separate generation, transmission, and distribution entities. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\ncentral  power  utilities  own  and  operate  30%  of  the  country's  total  generation  capacity,  while \nSEBs  and  EDs  have  59%  of  the  total.  In  addition,  five  privately  owned  utilities,  operating  in \ncertain  urban  centers  and  responsible  for  power  distribution  within  their  franchised  areas,  and \nsome independent power producers have a share of 11% of the generation. \n \nC. \n\nState Electricity Boards \n\n5. \nMost  of  the  SEBs  are  vertically  integrated  entities,  and  are  wholly  owned  by  their \nrespective  state  governments.  The  Electricity  Act  of  1910  and  the  Electricity  (Supply)  Act  of \n1948  provide  the  legal  basis  for  their  establishment  and operation. Since their establishment, \nthe  SEBs  have  grown  substantially  in  terms  of  meeting  the  demand  for  electricity  and  now \naccount  for  approximately  80%  of  commercial  electricity  sales  in  the  country.  Although  the \nelectricity acts allowed considerable managerial and financial autonomy to the SEBs, most state \ngovernments  used  them  as  vehicles  for  pursuing  their  social  and  political  objectives.  These \nincluded low tariffs for agricultural and residential consumers and employment to attract political \nsupport. The state governments also tend to interfere with SEBs\u2019 day-to-day operations, thereby \ncomplicating  the  task  of  SEB  management.  These  interventions  have  led  to  the  SEBs\u2019 \ndeteriorating  financial  performance,  which  has  become  the  main  issue  hindering  power sector \ndevelopment in India. \n \nA  sick  and  underperforming  power  sector  has  far-reaching  repercussions  on  other \n6. \nsectors  of  the  economy.  Unavailability  of  adequate  and  reliable  power  is  impeding  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  attract  domestic  and  foreign  investment  to  sectors,  such  as \ntelecommunications  and  information  technology,  which  are  vital  to  the  Government\u2019s  medium-\nterm development plans. If not improved, it will be one of the major constraints to the economic \ndevelopment of India in the coming years. The cash-starved SEBs have also been a big drain \non the state governments\u2019 financial resources. The diversion of resources to SEBs has forced \nstate  governments  to  curtail  their  activities  in  other  priority  sectors,  such  as  health  and \neducation,  which  are  essential  for  poverty  reduction.  Power  sector  reforms  at  the  state  level \ntherefore  require  greater  momentum  to  foster  overall  economic  development  and  to  conserve \nstate financial resources to meet important social and other development objectives. \n \nD. \n\nCentral Power Utilities \n\n7. \nTo  address  the  shortage  of  generating  capacity  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of \ngeneration, the Government established three central sector power utilities\u2014NTPC, NHPC, and \nNPC in 1975. Their mandate was to efficiently generate bulk power for sale to SEBs. In 1989, \nthe  Powergrid  Corporation  was  established  as  a  transmission  and  dispatch  agency  by \namalgamating  the  transmission  and  power  dispatch  facilities  of  other  central  power  utilities. \nRecently, the Government has established the Power Trading Corporation, which will take over \nthe responsibility for power trading among central utilities and SEBs as well as among SEBs. In \naddition  to  these  wholly  owned  companies,  the  Government  also  owns  shares  in  special-\npurpose  power  generating  companies.  The  central  agencies,  such  as  NTPC,  NHPC,  and \nPowergrid,  are  seriously  affected  by  the  poor  financial  health  of  most  SEBs,  as  has  been \nevidenced  several  times  in  the  past  when  excessive  accounts  receivable  from  those  SEBs \nseriously impaired the central agencies\u2019 financial liquidity. \n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nE. \n\nSector Performance \n\n1. \n\nTechnical Performance \n\nIn  terms  of  capacity  addition,  performance  during  the  Eighth Plan  (FY1993\u20131997) was \n8. \nonly  54%  of  target,  having  added  only  16,422  MW  instead  of  the  targeted  30,538  MW.  The \nNinth Plan envisaged a total addition of 40,245 MW during the FY1998\u20132002 period, consisting \nof 11,909 MW by central sector agencies, 10,748 MW by state utilities, and 17,588 MW by the \nprivate  sector  independent  power  producers  (IPPs).  However,  the  actual  capacity addition fell \nfar short of target, with the central sector meeting only 37.8% and the private sector 28.8% of \ntarget. The state sector performed better, achieving 87.9% of target. Given the SEBs\u2019 difficulties \nassociated  with  establishing  adequate  escrow  accounts  to  service  power  purchase  contracts \nand  the  attendant  problems  in  achieving  financial  closure  for  IPP  projects  currently  in  India, \nrealizing  the  full  IPP  contribution  to  the  generation  addition  appears  to  be  unlikely  in  the \nimmediate future.  \n \nWhile new generation addition has fallen short of target, the existing generating plants, \n9. \nmainly  coal-fired  thermal  power  plants,  have  shown  improved  performance  during  the  recent \npast. With a renovation and modernization program for thermal power stations, introduced in the \nearly  1990s,  the  plant  load  factor2\u2014a  performance  indictor\u2014has  increased  from  64.4%  in \nFY1997 to 69.9%  in FY2002.  According to the Common Minimum National Action Plan (para. \n10 of main text), the overall plant load factor was expected to increase to a minimum of 65% for \nstate owned utilities and to a national average of 70% by 2002.  However, given the substantial \nshortage  in  capacity  addition,  these  improvements  in  the  performance  of  existing  generating \nplants are inadequate to narrow down the demand-supply gap. Although, by the end of FY2002, \nIndia had a total installed capacity of 105,000 MW, there was a peak power deficit of 12.6% and \nan  energy  deficit  of  7.5%.  The  per  capita  electricity  consumption  stood  at  355  kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) in FY2002, compared to, for example, 719 kWh for the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n10. \nOperational  performance,  measured  in  terms  of  transmission  and  distribution  (T&D) \nlosses, has also been not satisfactory. T&D losses are reported to have increased from 24.5% \nin  FY1997  to  27.8%  in  FY2002  for  the  entire  country.  In  the  absence  of  adequate  metering \narrangements,  especially  for  agricultural  consumers,  part  of  the  losses  used  to  be  lumped \ntogether  with  agricultural  consumption.  The  actual  losses  are,  therefore,  thought  to  be  much \nhigher, with some SEBs now reporting T&D losses as high as 45\u201357%.3 The major reasons for \nsuch  high  losses  are  pilferage  of  energy  through  unauthorized  connections  and  tampering  of \nmeters, and technical losses originating from overloaded distribution networks. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Performance  \n\nSince  SEBs  account  for  almost  80%  of  commercial  electricity  sales  in  the  country,  the \n11. \nfinancial  performance  of  the  entire  sector,  including  that  of  central  sector  agencies,  is  heavily \ndependent on the performance of SEBs. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948, amended in \n1984,  the  financial  performance  of  the  SEBs  used  to  be  measured  in  terms  of  rate  of  return \n(ROR) on net fixed assets with a mandated minimum ROR of 3 %. However, none of the SEBs \nachieved  this  mandated  minimum  without  a  subsidy  from  their  state  governments,  and  only \nKarnataka  achieved  a  3%  ROR  with  the  government  subsidy.  All  the  others  posted  negative \nRORs. As indicated in Table A2 below, the consolidated performance of all SEBs show that the \n\n                                                 \n2   Defined as the ratio of actual capacity utilization of the plant to its rated capacity utilization. \n3   For example, T&D losses for Delhi are reported to be 57%. \n\n\f \n\n  \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nminimum required value was not achieved during the recent past, and indeed, deteriorated over \nthe  period  indicated.  The  major  reasons  for  this  unsatisfactory  financial  performance  were  the \nincreasing gap between the cost of supply and the average tariff, and the decreasing recovery \nrate. These figures stood at Rs1.10 per kWh and 68.6%, respectively, in FY2002. \n \n\nTable A2.

With the \nlimited  financial  resources  available,  the  tendency  of  most  of  the  SEBs  has  been  to  invest  a \nlarger proportion in generation to  address the demand-supply gap and less in transmission and \ndistribution. Over the years, this approach has led to inadequate distribution facilities resulting in \noverloading, inadequate maintenance, high T&D losses, and poor supply reliability, which in turn \nled to insufficient revenue\u2014a vicious circle. \n \nF. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\nFor  more  than  half  a  century,  the  Indian  Electricity  Act  of  1910  and  the  Electricity \n13. \n(Supply) Act of 1948 provided the basic framework for power sector operations. They provided \nfor  the  establishment  of  SEBs,  EDs,  and  central  sector  utilities  and  contributed  to  the  current \nstatus of development of the sector serving a population of more than 1 billion people. However, \nwith the worldwide changes in economic and financial outlook and technological developments, \nthe  sector  needed  comprehensive  reforms  to  provide  the  flexibility  required  to  meet  the \nchallenges  that  lay  ahead.  The  Government's  initial  approach  to  the  issue  was  not \ncomprehensive  enough.  For  example,  to  promote  private  sector  participation  in  generation \nprojects, the Government, in 1991, amended certain parts of the Electricity Act, 1910 to facilitate \nmobilization of domestic and foreign private funds and to allow incentives, such as high returns \non  investments.  Although  there  was  some  initial  enthusiasm  from  the  private  sector,  these \nmeasures have not resulted in more than 6,800 MW of capacity addition so far. The problem lay \nwith  the  structural  weaknesses  of  the  sector  setup,  especially  with  the  SEBs  whose  financial \nperformance  did  not  provide  sufficient  comfort  to  potential  investors.  In  1993,  as  a  result  of \nefforts  made  by  the  National  Development  Council,4  a  high-level  committee  on  power  was \nthe  committee  recommended \nconstituted. \n\nits  report,  submitted \n\nin  October  1994, \n\nIn \n\n                                                 \n4   The National Development Council is India's highest political body comprising the chief ministers of all the states \n\nin India, and chaired by the Prime Minister. \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n(i) organizational  reforms  at  the  state  level  aimed  at  unbundling  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution operations of the SEBs and commercializing the ensuing entities; (ii) organizational \nreforms  at  the  national  and  regional  levels  aimed  at  freeing the central sector agencies from \ntight government control, reducing the Government's equity in these agencies so as to enable \nparticipation  of  the  private  sector  on  a  joint-venture  basis;  (iii) large-scale  involvement  of  the \nprivate sector in generation and transmission, with sponsors selected through transparent and \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures;  (iv) creation  of  national  and  regional  tariff  boards  to  take  over \nthe  responsibility  for  tariff  setting  independently  of  the  central  Government  and  state \ngovernments; and (v) a progressive phasing out of subsidies to agricultural consumers. These \nrecommendations  ultimately  led  to  the  adoption  by  the  National  Development  Council  of  a \nCommon  Minimum  National  Action  Plan  for  Power  in  1996.  To  operationalize  some  of  the \nrecommendations,  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commissions  Act  was  enacted  in  1998,  enabling \nthe establishment of independent regulatory bodies at the central and state levels. Although this \nwas a significant step toward improving the sector, it was not comprehensive enough to cover \ncomplete  sector  restructuring.  The  Government  set  up  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission  under  the  Act,  to  be  responsible  for  regulating  power  sector  operations  at  the \nnational  level,  related  to  generation  and  interstate transmission. The state governments were \ngiven the option to set up their own state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) under the \nAct or under bills to be passed by their own legislative assemblies. As a result and sometimes \non their own, some states have taken the initiative of reforming their power sectors. Foremost \namong them was Orissa, which, with World Bank assistance, completely unbundled its SEB and \nestablished  the  country's  first  SERC  in  1996.  The  SEB's  power  generation  business  was \nentrusted  to  two  power  corporations,  transmission  to  a  grid  corporation,  and  distribution \noperations  to  four  companies  that  were  subsequently  privatized.  Reforms  in  Orissa  were \nfollowed  by  similar  reforms  in  Haryana,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Karnataka,  and  Uttar  Pradesh with \nWorld Bank assistance and in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh with ADB assistance.  \n  \n14. \nTo promote more comprehensive reforms in the power sector, the Ministry of Power has \nfinalized  the  draft  Electricity  Bill  2001.  As  in  the  case  with  concurrent  subjects (see para. 4 of \nmain  text),  consultations  have  been  held  with  state  governments  on  the  contents  of  the  draft, \nand  the  final  version  was  presented  to  Parliament  in  2001.5  This  Bill  attempts  to  consolidate \nprevious  acts  relating  to  all  power  sector  operations  including  setting  up  of  independent \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  companies,  regulatory  agencies,  national  and  state-\nlevel  power  sector  planning,  consumer  protection  and  dispute  resolution,  and  safety  aspects. \nOnce  enacted,  the  Bill  will  repeal  previous  electricity  acts,  thereby  providing  a  single \ncomprehensive body of legislation for the entire range of sector operations. As in the case with \nprevious acts, the Bill provides for any state government to hold in abeyance, within its territory, \nprovisions of the Bill for a period not exceeding 6 months from the date of enactment of the Bill \nin order to address any transitional issues. \n \nThe  most  notable  features  of  the  Bill  are  (i) open access to transmission systems with \n15. \ntransmission  service  providers  prohibited  from  holding  interests  in  generation  assets; \n(ii) compulsory metering of all consumers within 2 years of enactment of the Bill; (iii) facilitating \nthe entry of power traders as opposed to distribution service providers; (iv) prioritizing the use of \nproceeds from privatizing power sector assets to compensate staff affected by such privatization \nand  then  to  retire  debts  and  other  liabilities;  and  (v) promoting  more  targeted  and  transparent \nsubsidies to the rural and economically  weaker consumers. While providing a comprehensive \nframework for improvement of the power sector, the Bill also provides the necessary flexibility to \nthe state governments to determine their own pace and priorities for sector reform. \n\n                                                 \n5  The Bill is still awaiting approval by Parliament. \n\n\fLIST OF SUBPROJECTS ALREADY IDENTIFIED\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nWest Bengal State Electricity Board\nProject \nNo.\n\nName of Project\n\n \n\n \n\n         \n1\n\n         \n2\n\n         \n3\n\n         \n4\n\n         \n5\n\n         \n6\n\n         \n7\n\n         \n8\n\n         \n9\n\n       \n\n10\n\n       \n\n11\n\n       \n\n12\n\n       \n\n13\n\n       \n\n14\n\n       \n\n15\n\n       \n\n16\n\n       \n\n17\n\n       \n\n18\n\n       \n\n19\n\n       \n\n20\n\n       \n\n21\n\n       \n\n22\n\nDistribution Projects\n\n Distribution Scheme for Mirpur(Amtola) \nunder 24-Pargana (South) Dist.

\n \n1. \nThe overview consists of a description of the state power sector including information on \nexisting  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  facilities;  previous investments in the \nsector; and an analysis of the future investment needs. It also includes recommendations of the \nvarious power sector reform committees and consultants, on which the R-OFAP milestones are \nbased. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe R-OFAP contains a number of detailed reform steps, divided into broad categories. \nEach  reform  step  is  associated  with  a  target  completion  date,  responsibility  center,  and \nresources  required.  The  following  are  extracted  from  the  R-OFAPs  for  Karnataka  and  West \nBengal. \n \n\nPower Sector Reforms \n\n1. \n\nStructural Reforms \n\nThese  include:  submission  of  recommendations  for  sector  unbundling;  identification  of \n3. \nassets and liabilities; restructuring of the sector into separate functional entities; segregation of \nassets  and  operational  areas;  issue  of  procedures  for  appointment  of  professionals  into \nstructured entities; and appointment of boards of directors. \n\n \nFinancial Reforms \n\n2. \n\n4. \nThese include: adoption of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); developing \nfinancial  instruction  manuals;  introduction  of  activity-based  costing;  developing  MIS  to  monitor \nrevenue  and  expenditure  in  activity  centers;  training;  finalization,  approval,  registration,  and \noperationalization  of  Pension  Trust;  identification  and  valuing  fixed  assets;  action  plan  for \nclearing  arrears  and  its  implementation;  identification  of  outstanding  liabilities;  preparation  of \nfinancial  projections;  preparation  of  provisional  balance  sheets  for  restructured  entities;  and \nsettlement of government subsidies according to regulator's rulings. \n \n\n3. \n\nTransfer Scheme  \n\n5. These include: transfer of personnel to newly created agencies; and Government to arrange \nfor meeting unfunded pension liabilities.  \n \n\n4. \n\nHuman Resources Development \n\n6. These include: developing organization structures for new agencies;  assessment of staffing \nrequirements  for  the  new  agencies  and  training  needs;  preparation  and  implementation  of  a \nvoluntary  separation  scheme;  and  preparation  and  implementation  of  incentive  schemes  for \nemployees.  \n \n\n5. \n\nState Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) \n\n7.  \nThese  include:  establishing  SERC;  providing  SERC  with  adequate  budget  and \ninfrastructure facilities; issue of customer charter and commercial standards; and carrying out \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\neffective  communication  and  information  campaigns  to  disseminate  information  to  various \nstakeholders.  \n \n\n6. \n\nTariff Rationalization \n\n8. \nThese  include:  establishing  working  groups  to  compile  and  analyze  load  forecasts, \navailability  of  power,  classification  of  costs  and  their  allocation,  costs  to  various  consumer \ngroups, revenue requirements, rate of return, etc.; developing tariff proposals for consideration \nby SERC; and modifying and revising tariffs in accordance with SERC rulings.  \n \n\n7. \n\nRegional Business/Profit Centers \n\nThese include: deciding to establish business or profit centers; signing memorandums of \n9. \nunderstanding  for  their  performance;  evaluating  performance  of  business  centers;  and \ndeveloping  schemes  for  incentives/disincentives  for  motivating  business  centers  to  achieve \ntargets in the memorandums of understanding. \n \n \n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n \n\nPOWER FINANCE CORPORATION \n \n\nfour \n\nit  has \n\nincluding \n\nfull-time  members \n\nThe Power Finance Corporation (PFC) was established by the Government in 1986 as \n1. \nan  independent  public  sector  company  under  the  Companies  Act  and  started  operations  in \nJanuary  1988.  Its  main  objectives  are  to  finance,  facilitate,  and  promote  power  sector \ndevelopment in India, including private sector power projects. PFC's areas of financing cover all \ntypes of power projects other than rural electrification. In addition to lending operations, PFC is \nalso involved in providing technical assistance and advisory services to state electricity boards \n(SEBs).  As  a  financial  institution,  PFC  was  accorded  sovereign  rating  of  Ba21  by  Moody's \nInvestor Service and AAA by two local credit rating agencies in 2002. \n \nThe memorandum of association of PFC prescribes that its board will consist of between \n2. \nthree  and  15  directors.  Currently, \nthe \nchairperson/managing director and two part-time members representing the Ministry of Power. \nThe  chairperson/managing  director  is  in  overall  charge  of  PFC  operations.  Its  operations  are \norganized  into  three  separate  groups,  each  headed  by  a  full-time  director.  The  Director \n(Institutional  Development  and  Administration)  is  responsible  for  human  resources,  legal \naspects and administration, management systems, and institutional appraisal and development \nof borrowing power sector clients. The Director (Projects) is in charge of project appraisal and \nadministration,  management  information  systems,  and  technical  development.  The  Director \n(Finance  and  Financial  Operations)  is  responsible  for  financial  and  legal  operations,  fund \ngeneration, international financing operations, and loan disbursement and recovery. PFC's loan \nand project appraisal and administration are structured on a regional basis, with five regions\u2014\nnorthern,  southern,  western,  eastern,  and  northeastern\u2014covering  the  entire  country,  thereby \nproviding a better regional focus. At the end of FY2002, it had a total staff of 272, consisting of \n157 employees of executive level and above, and 115 in other categories. PFC's organization \nchart is in Appendix 6. \n \n3. \nHuman  resources  development  has  been  a  high  priority  activity  for  PFC.  In  the  early \n1990s,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  the  former \nOverseas Development Administration of the United Kingdom provided substantial assistance to \ntrain PFC and some SEB staff in project preparation, project appraisal, and financial operations. \nAs  a  result  of  this  early  training,  PFC  now  has  a  skilled  workforce  capable  of  successfully \nhandling all aspects related to power sector lending. To complement its development of human \nresources, PFC, in 1998, also introduced modern computer-based management systems. The \nareas  computerized \nfinancial  and  operational \nmanagement such as financial accounting, bond management, loan accounting, recoveries, and \nproject  and  loan  appraisal  and  sanction,  and  office  automation.  These  developments  have \nlargely contributed to the substantial expansion of its operations without increasing its overhead \ncosts. In fact, PFC has been able to increase disbursements by 3.3 times and net profits by 3.1 \ntimes while marginally increasing its staff resources by 17% during the period FY1996\u20132001. In \n2002,  PFC  plans  to  add  to  the  integrated  system  functions  of  financial  planning,  fund \nmanagement, and asset-liability and risk management. \n \n4. \nPFC's  operational  philosophy  and  procedures  are  guided  by  its  Operational  Policy \nStatement (OPS). Developed in 1990 in close consultation with ADB and the World Bank, and \nsince  then  revised  to  reflect  recent  changes  in  the  India  power  sector,  the  OPS  provides  a \n\ninclude  human  resources  management, \n\n                                                 \n1  This is limited by the sovereign rating for the country. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\ncomprehensive  set  of  guidelines  for  power  sector  lending.  It  defines  PFC's  mission  and \nobjectives  and  sets  out  guidelines    for  project    identification,  eligibility,  lending  modalities, \nexposure  limits,  guarantees  and  security,  and  project  administration  including  procurement \nprocedures.  It  also  specifies  limits  for  key  financial  parameters  such  as  debt-equity ratio and \ndebt  service  coverage  ratio  to  ensure  PFC\u2019s  own  financial  health  while  lending  to  others.  The \nkey features of the revised OPS are (i) emphasis on power sector reforms in addition to project-\nbased lending; (ii) provision of other services such as consulting and advisory services, foreign \nexchange management, and lender's engineering services; and (iii) assistance to private sector \nprojects. A summary of the OPS is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n5. \nThe  objectives  set  out  in  the  OPS  have  been  incorporated  into  PFC's latest corporate \nplan:  The  Corporate  Strategic  Plan,  2007.  The  plan  includes  projections  for  the  9th  five-year \nplan  (FY1997\u20132002),  and  the  10th  five-year  plan  (FY2002\u20132007), and recommendations for a \npossible  approach  to  the  11th  five-year  plan  (FY2007\u20132012). The corporate plan also includes \nthe  recommendations  of  a  high-level  committee  on  financial  operations  of  PFC.  Some  of  the \nrecommendations of that committee are to (i) increase PFC's investments in public sector power \nprojects by up to 20% of the total requirements and in private sector projects by up to 5% and \n(ii) reach  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  of  30\u201335%  in  terms  of  disbursements  and  loan \napprovals. \n \nAccording  to  the  15th  Electric  Power  Survey,  about  72,500  MW  of  new  generating \n6. \ncapacity  is  required  to  be  added  during  the  10th  five-year  plan  (FY2002\u20132007).  Taking  into \naccount  the  associated  investments  in  transmission  and  distribution,  the  total  investment \nrequirements  during  the  10th  plan  are  indicated  in  Table  A5.1  below.  PFC\u2019s  planned \ndisbursements to support this development program are also indicated. \n \n\nTable A5.1: Total Sector Investment Needs and Power Finance Corporation Share \n \n\n \n\n  Year \n \n\n  PFC Share \n(Rs billion) \n\n700 \n756 \n812 \n868 \n924 \n4,060 \n\nCapacity Addition \n \n\nTotal Investments \n  (Rs billion) \n\n(MW) \n12,500 \n13,500 \n14,500 \n15,500 \n16,500 \n72,500 \n\n \n \n \n2003 \n \n2004 \n \n2005 \n \n2006 \n \n2007 \n \n \nTotal \nMW = megawatts. \nSource: Power Finance Corporation. Corporate Strategic Plan 2007. \n \n7. \nGiven  the  chronic  shortage  in  energy  and  peak  power  capacity  in India, the assumed \ncapacity  addition  appears  to  be  reasonable.  However,  PFC's  ability  to  finance  its  share  of  the \ninvestments, indicated in Table A5.1, will depend on its ability to raise funds. For this purpose, \nPFC  expects  to  access  provident  funds,  pension  funds,  and  long-term  operation  funds,  in \naddition to funds available under various government initiatives and from multilateral agencies. \nComplementary to project-based lending, PFC's corporate plan provides for supporting reforms \nand  restructuring  of  the  state  power  sector.  It  has  already  started  promoting  power  sector \nreforms  and  restructuring  of  sector  agencies,  by  providing  them  with  technical  advice  and \nfinancial support. \n \n\n46 \n52 \n95 \n110 \n130 \n433 \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nOver the past 5 years, from FY1998 to FY2002, PFC\u2019s financial performance has been \n8. \non  a  sound  level.  PFC  has  exceeded  all  the  financial  performance  targets1  agreed  with  the \nMinistry of Power every year for this period. Both the return on assets and the return on equity \nin  FY2002  indicate  adequate  profitability  of  5.0%  and  20.4%,  respectively.  The  debt  service \ncoverage ratios (DSCRs) are also higher than the minimum 1.2 times. PFC\u2019s capital position, as \nmeasured  by  its  risk-weighted  capital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR),2  was  25.6%  in  FY2002,  which  is \nsatisfatory by international standards.3 The financial position of PFC has stabilized for a variety \nof reasons. First, PFC continuously expanded its loan size to support growing investment needs \nof  India\u2019s  power  sector.  Second,  nonperforming  loans  amounting  to  about  Rs7.5  billion  were \nrestructured between FY1997 and FY2000 and recovered cash generation. Consequently, PFC \nmaintained  high  overdue  recovery  rates  of  97\u2013100%  after  FY1998.  Third,  funding  costs  have \nbeen  relatively  low  due  to  PFC\u2019s  access  to  tax-free  bonds,  tax  exemption  on  loans  to \ninfrastructure  projects,  and  external  borrowing  with  government  guarantees.  A  summary  of \nPFC\u2019s actual financial performance is given in Table A5.2 and details are in Appendix 7.  \n \nTable A5.2: Power Finance Corporation Audited Actual Financial Performance Indicators, \nFY1998-2002 \n \nFY1998 \n25.8 \n25.5 \n7.4 \n7.3 \n2.4  \n31.0 \n97.6 \n10.7 \n10.7 \n\nFinancial Indicators \nReturn on Equitya (Pretax, %) \nReturn on Equitya (Post-tax, %) \nReturn on Asset  (Pretax, %) \nReturn on Asset  (Post-tax, %) \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio \nCapital Adequacy Ratio (%) \nDue Collection Rate (%) \nNPAs on Gross Loans: RBIb Norms (%) \nNPAs on Gross Loans: BIS c Norms (%) \nNPA = non performing asset. \na  Opening value, excluding reserves for bad and doubtful debts. \nb  Reserve Bank of India prudential norms. \n \nc  Bank for International Settlements recommended norms. \nSource:  PFC and staff findings. \n \n9. \nFor  the  next  10  years,  PFC  is  targeting  20%  average  disbursement  growth  based \nannually  on  the  10th  and  11th  five-year  plans.  PFC\u2019s  profitability  is  likely  to  remain  acceptable \nover the near term due to  the strong demand for funds from the state power sector as well as \nfrom  central  power  utilities.  Although  aggressive  expansion  of  the  loan  portfolio  will  result  in  a \ngradual  decline  of  capital  position  and  profitability  on  its  assets,  PFC  is  still  expected  to \ndemonstrate  sound  financial  performance.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  PFC\u2019s  financial \nposition  will  be  depend  on  its  internal  risk  control.  First,  PFC  will  be  exposed  to  more  market \n                                                 \n1  At the end of every financial year, PFC and MOP prepare a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to set financial \n\nFY2001 \n22.8 \n17.9 \n5.8 \n4.5 \n1.4  \n26.9 \n99.5 \n3.4 \n3.4 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFY2000 \n26.8 \n21.4 \n7.1 \n5.7 \n2.8  \n27.1 \n98.7 \n6.0 \n6.0 \n\nFY2002 \n25.3 \n20.4 \n6.1 \n5.0 \n1.2  \n25.6 \n97.1 \n4.4 \n4.4 \n\nFY1999 \n26.7 \n21.9 \n7.5 \n6.1 \n1.1  \n29.1 \n98.5 \n2.8 \n2.8 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\ntargets, e.g., sanctions, disbursements, collection, return on assets, return on equity, operating ratio.  \n\n2  The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is the ratio of total qualified capital (equity [Tier I] plus mezzanine capital [Tier II, \nIII]) to total risk-weighted assets including off-balance sheet items. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates the \nrequirements and standards based on types of financial institutions. However, PFC has been exempted from the \nrequirements.  Accordingly,  the  calculation  of  CAR  is  based  on  RBI  norms  for  nonbanking  financial  companies. \nWhen CAR was calculated on the two standard norms, RBI and BIS, the difference between the two values was \nless than 0.5% for FY2002. \n\n3  The  Basel  Accord  of  the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  recommends  a  mandatory  CAR  of  8%  for  banks  in \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. For most DMCs, the guidelines recommend \na minimum CAR of 12%. \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nrisks  by  increased  market  borrowing  and  foreign  currency  funding  and  by  decreased \ngovernment  support,4  such  as  that  from  tax-free  bonds,  equity  contribution,  and  regulatory \nexemptions.  Second,  in  the  event  that  interest  yields  will  be  lower  due  to  the  competitive \nfinancial market in near term, PFC\u2019s other revenue sources besides the intermediary service are \nlikely to be limited.5 Furthermore, PFC\u2019s profitability might be eroded by the deterioration in the \nquality of the SEB loan portfolio. Therefore, over the long term, PFC will be required to conduct \ntimely risk control and thorough asset-liability management justified by an increase in the stable \nfunding  base  at  acceptable  costs  as  well  as  by  profit  opportunities.  A  summary  of  PFC\u2019s \nprojected  financial  performance  is  given  in  Table  A5.3.

In FY2002, 164 new loans totaling \nRs66 billion  ($1.375  billion)  to  43  borrowers  were  approved  and  disbursements  totaling \nRs52 billion  ($1.083  billion)  were  made  during  the  same  period.  As  a  result,  PFC\u2019s  loans \noutstanding  in  FY2002  amounted  to  Rs165  billion  ($3.437  billion).  More  than  95%  of  PFC\u2019s \nloans outstanding have been lent to public power sector, consisting mainly of SEBs and state \ngovernments. In FY1999, PFC started lending to private sector clients; however, disbursement \nto this sector has been decreasing recently. The largest five borrowers are public sector utilities \nwhose  loans  exceeded  1.4  times  PFC\u2019s  equity  in  FY2002.    Accordingly,  PFC\u2019s  loan  portfolio \nquality is exposed largely to financial conditions of public sector clients. Considering the current \nunstable financial situation of these SEBs, it is essential that PFC appropriately assess its asset \nquality,  provisioning,  and  income  recognition.  As  for  income  recognition,  PFC  accounts  for  its \ninterest  revenues  on  an  actual  cash  basis  in  a  conservative  manner.  However,  PFC  has  not \nidentified  asset  quality  and  its  provisions  in  past  years  because  it  has  been  exempted  from \nIndia\u2019s financial regulations applicable to these aspects. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, \ncalled the prudential norms, regulate assets into four classes: standard, substandard, doubtful, \nand loss assets, based on the length of time the loan has been overdue. According to the RBI \nstandards, PFC\u2019s nonperforming assets (NPAs) in  FY2002  would  be  4.4%  substandard  only. \nThis  portion  of  NPAs  is  now  small  enough  to  be  fully  covered  by  PFC\u2019s  reserves  for  bad  and \ndoubtful  debts,  but  PFC  is  required  to  establish  its  own  policy  norms  for  asset  quality  control \nand its provisioning to cushion the credit risk, such as default by large SEB borrowers. Over the \n                                                 \n4  Government support, in the form of direct loans or tax-free bonds, has substantially declined over the years [e.g., \n58% (FY1999) to 15% (FY2002)]. Particularly, the Government has made no direct loans since FY2001. There are \nno other explicit subsidies involved in PFC\u2019s lending operations. \n\n5  Besides  its  core  lending  business,  PFC  has  been  starting  fee-based services, such as engineering consultancy \n\nservices. \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\npast 5 years, the actual size of NPAs as per BIS norms6 has been the same as per RBI norms \nas indicated in Table A5.3. However, ADB will re-assess PFC\u2019s future NPAs based on both the \nIndian  and  the  International  asset  classification  norms  on  a  regular  basis  to  monitor  portfolio \nquality and provisioning. \n \n11. \nAs  per  the  OPS,  PFC\u2019s  relending  rates  are  determined  based  on  cost  of  raising \nresources and the state of the financial markets without breaching the operational policy or any \nother  covenanted  agreements.  In  the  past,  the  indicated  rates  were  higher  than  prime  lending \nrates  or  medium-term  lending  rates  in  India.  However,  recent  rates  have  been  competitive \ncompared to the market rates. These competitive interest rates from FY2001 stem from cheaper \nfunding due to the recent improvement in PFC\u2019s borrowing ability from the market, rather than \ndue to government support,7 which is currently decreasing. PFC has set different lending rates \nfor  different  type  of  borrowers  or  projects.  In  addition,  starting  in  June  2002,  PFC  has  offered \nmore  competitive  rates  of  12.0\u201312.5%  (including  0.5%  rebate  for  timely  repayment)  for \nreforming  states,  and  further  market  driven  rates  of  11.0\u201312.0%  (including  0.5%  rebate  for \ntimely repayment) for states with no default declaration as of August 2002. \n \n\nTable A5.4.

They  are  reviewed  by \nqualified  and  statutory  external  auditors8  appointed  by  the  Government  .

PFC will appraise the subprojects in \nterms  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  will  complete  screening  forms  to  identify  the \nresettlement impacts for the subprojects to evaluate them. The screening forms have been sent \nto PFC and are attached to the framework. For transmission lines, either designs should permit \ncultivation, or land compensation, crop compensation, and compensation for loss of trees will be \npaid. For nonprotected right-of-way acquisition, crop compensation and compensation for land \nacquired  for  transmission  towers  will  be  paid.  PFC  will  carry  out  due  diligence  to  ensure  that \nsubproject  selection  and  resettlement  plan  preparation  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement.  \n \n2. \nPFC  will  ensure  that  compensation  is  adequate  to  replace  the  lost  assets,  including \nlivelihood  restoration  and  related  assistance.  This  would  include  any  nontitled  persons, \nsharecroppers, tenants, and wage laborers living or carrying out livelihood activities affected by \nland acquired. Valuation that is based on compensation under the law allows for a 30% solatium \nand  interest  of  12%  from  the  time  of  gazette  notification.  Valuation  is  based  on  the  current \nyear\u2019s price. \n \nFor each subproject entailing land acquisition and resettlement, PFC will prepare short \n3. \nresettlement  plans  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice \nand ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.  \n \nPFC will work with SEBs to ensure that resettlement plans are prepared in consultation \n4. \nwith  affected  persons  and  appropriate  grievance  redress  procedures  are  developed  and \nincluded in the resettlement plans. Consultation will be conducted by SEB staff and  panchayat \n(local government)  representatives.  The  panchayat  and  SEB  project  officer  in  charge  will  be \nresponsible for grievance redress to ensure that any disagreements are resolved at the village \nlevel. The mechanisms will be documented in the resettlement plans. In subprojects where land \nacquisition is considered to be sensitive, PFC will be involved in the consultation process. \n \nAn  itemized  budget  with  mechanisms  for  delivery  will  be  included  in  the  resettlement \n5. \nplans. An implementation schedule that clearly indicates resettlement implementation, payment \nof  compensation  (at  the  time  of  possession  of  land  and  assets)  will  be  included  in  the \nresettlement plan. \n \n6. \nPFC will designate staff member(s) within the Externally Aided Projects Unit (EAPU) to \nbe responsible for resettlement, including, preparation of resettlement plans and monitoring and \nevaluation of resettlement implementation. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Category B projects: Short resettlement plan is required for insignificant resettlement. Resettlement is insignificant \nwhen: (i) fewer than 200 people are displaced from housing; (ii) fewer than 200 people will lose fewer than 10% of \ntheir productive assets (income generating); or (iii) 500 people or less experience minor impact. When fewer than \n100 scheduled tribes   (individuals)  are  affected,  a  full  indigenous  peoples\u2019  development  plan  is  not  required  but \nimpact  and  mitigation  measures  can  be  dealt  through  the  resettlement  plan.  When  it  is  category  C,  i.e.,  no \ninvoluntary resettlement effects, no resettlement plan is required.  \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nArrangements for monitoring will be described in the resettlement plan. PFC will forward \n\n7. \nto ADB monitoring reports on land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \n8. \nPFC  has  developed  procedures  for  screening  subprojects  and  preparing  resettlement \nplans,  in  the  following  formats:  (i) triggering  actions  required  by  PFC,  (ii) initial  checklist  for \nresettlement impacts, (iii) screening form for initial social and poverty screening of subprojects, \nand  (iv) compliance  memorandum  to  be  signed  by  head,  EAPU.  For  category  C  projects,  no \naction is required. \n \n9. \nPrior  to  forwarding  the  resettlement  plans  to  ADB,  PFC  will  ensure  that  they  are \ndisclosed  to  the  public  and  confirm  such  to  ADB.  The  mechanisms  for  disclosure  will  be \ndiscussed in the resettlement plan. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n49 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCEDURE FOR APPROVING SUBPROJECTS  \nIndia\u2019s Environmental Assessment Regulations \n\n1. \n \n1. \nThe type of proposed subprojects (e.g., construction of new transmission and distribution \nlines, new substations and rehabilitation of old substations, and rehabilitation and modernization \nof existing power stations) is not covered by the Indian Environmental Assessment Regulations. \nTherefore, approval from the Ministry of Forests and Environment for the environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) prior to execution of the subproject is not required.    \n \n2. \n\nPower Finance Corporation\u2019s Environmental Assessment and Monitoring Unit \n\n2. \nIn 1998, the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) established procedures for incorporating \nenvironmental  concerns  into  project  design  through  its  appraisal  process.  Its  Environmental \nAssessment  and  Monitoring  Unit    (EAMU)  carries  out  environmental  appraisals  for  projects \nfunded  by  PFC  and  formulates  environmental  covenants/conditions  in  its  loan  agreements  if \nnecessary.  EAMU  is  responsible  for  monitoring  environmental  performance  of  the  projects \nthrough  monthly  progress  reports.  If  the  project  executing  agency  does  not  meet  the  loan \nconditions,  PFC,  through  EAMU,  takes  necessary  action  to  help  the  agency  meet  the \nenvironmental  loan  conditions.  However,  if  the  agency  does  not  meet  the  requirements \nthereafter,  loan  disbursements  are  suspended  until  the  problems  are  resolved.

These types \nof  projects  are  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  projects  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) Environmental Assessment Requirements. The initial environmental examinations (IEEs) \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements \nfor  two  sample \ninvestments  were  prepared  by  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  summarized  below.

The  proposed  alignment  of  the \ntransmission  lines  will  pass  through  agricultural  fields,  transverse  some \nsmall rivers, home gardens, and some settlement areas. The topography \nof  the  project  area  is  basically  flat  with  some  area  having  gently  slope. \n\n \nNo. \n\n 1 \n\n \nC. \n \n3. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n57 \n\nThe  nearest  forest  is  located  about  2 km  from  the  alignment  of \ntransmission line in Western Midnapore. The line does not pass through \nforest,  wildlife  sanctuary,  and  national  park.  It  does  not  pass  also  any \nsocial  infrastructures  (e.g.,  schools,  medical  clinic,  and  cultural  or \nhistorical  importance).    The  proposed  substation  is  located  in  Jhargram \nsubdivision,  which  is  about  170 km  from  Kolkata.  The  town  is  well \nconnected by railway and roads. \n\nii. \n\nAurangabad.  The  distribution  system  will  serve  the  Aurangabad  city \narea. The proposed substations will also located in the city area. There is \nno environmentally sensitive area nearby this city. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \nD. \n \n4. \nThe  screening  of  potential  impacts  identifies  that  there  will  be  no  significant \nenvironmental  impact  arising  from  the  siting  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  lines  and  the \nsubstations,  because  none  of  them  is  located  nearby  or  within  any  environmentally  sensitive \narea. \n  \nThe environmental impacts associated with the construction stage will be mainly related \n5. \nto  land  clearing  activities  and  excavation  of  land  to  place  the  tower  foundations.  The \ntransmission line  (132 kV) and medium voltage distribution line (33 kV) will require clearing of a \nright-of-way  across  about  10\u201320 meters (m). No land  clearing  will  be  required  for  low  voltage \ndistribution lines (11 kV). Concrete poles of 10\u201311 m high will be erected at distance not greater \nthan  40\u201350 m.    Each  poles  will  require  land  of  9\u201325  square  meters.  While,  the  low  voltage \ndistribution  line  (230 V)  will  not  require  a  special  right-of-way,  and  it  does  not  require  also  a \nconcrete  pole.  The  poles  will  be  about  8 m  height  and  using  wood.  Therefore,  the  impacts \nassociated  with  the  laying  of  the  distribution  line  will  be  very  minimal  and  the  mitigation \nmeasures will be manageable. The impacts associated with the construction of the transmission \nline will also be minimal because the activities will be carried out as much as possible by using \nthe existing motorable roads. If temporary roads are needed, the contractor will be required to \nemploy  good  construction  practices  by  maintaining  the  topsoil  and  rehabilitating  temporary \nroads if the communities living nearby the project area do not want these temporary roads.    \n \n6. \nThe  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  operation  would  not  be  significant, \nbecause  the  activities  during  the  operation  will  involve  only  maintaining  clearance  from  tree \nbranches  and  leaves,  not  exceeding  3 m  in  height.  Noise  is  the  only  impact  associated  with \nsubstation operation.  \n \nThe  proposed  mitigation  measures  will  involve:  (i) select  a  route  for  alignment  to \n7. \nminimize the number of trees to be removed; (ii) avoid cultural and historical monuments, public \nutility  services  (e.g.,  playground,  school),  and  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas;  and \n(iii) locate the transformers at a reasonable distance so that noise levels from the fencing should \nmeet Indian national standards.  \n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n8. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe following guidelines for transmission lines and tower spotting will be observed: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  alignment  will  avoid,  without  exception,  known  wildlife  reserves,  closed  (or \nold-growth)  forests,  archaeological  sites,  religious  structures,  and  educational \ninstitutions. \nAs  far  as  practicable,  the  alignment  will  avoid  agricultural  estates  and  houses \n(permanent or temporary). In particular, special care will be taken to avoid human \nsettlement  clusters.  Where  agricultural  estates  are  unavoidable,  the  ground \nclearance will be increased to at least 10 m. \n\n(iii)  Where  road  or  river  crossing  is  unavoidable,  prescribed  vertical  and  horizontal \n\nclearance requirements will be strictly adhered to. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n \nE. \n \n9. \nThe state electricity board will take full responsibility for implementing the environmental \nmanagement plan and for ensuring that the Project complies with best environmental practices \nand meets mitigation and monitoring requirements described in the IEE reports. The contractor \nwill  take  responsibility  for  implementing  all  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction stage. \nThe  PFC  will  randomly  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures,  which  include \ncross-checking  the  contract  and  bidding  document,  if  necessary,  to  ensure  that  the  contractor \nwill be bound by the responsibility to implement the mitigation measures. For the transmission \ncomponent that passes though any sensitive area, which is subject to government regulations, \nthe  state  electricity  board  will  ensure  that  no  contract  for  civil  work  will  be  awarded  prior  to \napproval from the relevant institutions.  \n \nF. \n \n10. \nOverall  environmental  impacts  are  deemed  to  be  minor.  Therefore  an  environmental \nimpact  assessment  is  unnecessary.  It  is  recommended  that  project  implementation  should \nstrictly adhere to proposed mitigation measures stated in the IEE reports.  \n \nG. \n \n11. \nconsidered adequate.  \n \n  \n\nThe  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  will  be  minor.
