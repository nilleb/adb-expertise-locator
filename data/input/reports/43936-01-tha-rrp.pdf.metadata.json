Its development and implementation will be covered by a 5-\nyear  automatically  renewable  power  purchase  agreement  between \nthe  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT)  and  NED \nunder  the  Small  Power  Producers  Program.  EGAT  will  purchase  all \nthe energy output of the plant up to 55 MW, the upper limit set in the \npower  purchase  agreement.  The  solar  project  will  use  innovative \nthin-film  photovoltaic  technology  and  is  expected  to  be  one  of  the \nlargest solar photovoltaic projects in the world. It is also working with \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  prefinance  certified  emission \nreductions under ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative.  \n \nThe  project  will  use  thin-film  photovoltaic  technology  produced  by \nSharp,  and  will  be  implemented  by  Sharp  and  the  Italian-Thai \nDevelopment  Public  Company  under  a  fixed-price,  date-certain \nengineering, \ncontract  with \nand \nperformance  guarantees  for  on-time  completion  and  a  25-year \nperformance warranty for the photovoltaic module. Among the world\u2019s \nlargest  suppliers  of  solar  cells,  Sharp  holds  about  20%  of  the \nworldwide market for solar power. The company is rated A/stable by \nStandard & Poor\u2019s and A2/stable by Moody\u2019s. \n \nThe proposed loan will be for up to the lower of $70 million equivalent \nin baht (or dollars if for any reason Baht is not available) and 25% of \nproject  costs.  In  the  event  that  ADB  cannot  effectively  fund  baht \nloans, or NED elects to arrange financing under an ADB partial credit \nguarantee,  the  proposed  direct  loan  may  be  replaced  by  a  partial \ncredit guarantee issued by ADB to eligible lenders up to the lower of \n$70  million  equivalent  in  baht  and  25%  of  project  costs.    The  grant \ncomponent  of  investments,  amounting  to  $2  million,  will  be  financed \non a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy \n\nprocurement, \n\nconstruction \n\nBorrower \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironmental and \nSocial Safeguards \nClassification \n \nProject Description \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProposed ADB \nAssistance \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \nImpact, Outcome \nand Benefits \n\n \nSponsors \n\n \nNonsovereign \nOperations Rating \nand Rationale \n\n \nJustification and \nADB Value-Added \n\n \n\nFinancing  Partnership  Facility,  comprising  three  clean  energy  funds \nwhose aim is to help improve energy security in DMC's and decrease \nthe  rate  of  climate  change.  The  grant  funds  will  be  administered  by \nADB  and  cover  a  portion  of  the  contingency  financing  in  the  event \nthat the project has to draw down contingency funds. The grant funds \nfor  contingency  financing  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of  introducing \nPV technology on a large scale. \n \nThe  project\u2019s  development  impact  will  result  from  the  demonstration \neffect  of  the  feasibility  and  sustainability  of  a  large-scale  private \nsector  solar  farm,  a  model  that  can  be  replicated  by  other  private \nsector investors in Thailand and other developing member countries. \nOf  all  renewable  energy  sources  in  Thailand,  solar  energy  has  the \nmost  potential,  possibly  offering  more  than  50,000  MW  of  installed \ncapacity.  The  project  will  be  the  first  to  demonstrate  this  unrealized \npotential.  The  project  and  its  anticipated  replication  will  diversify \nThailand\u2019s energy mix by adding renewable energy capacity, helping \nthe  country  to  meet  its  target  of  obtaining  20.4%  of  its  primary \ncommercial energy from renewable energy by 2022.  \n \nThe project is sponsored by the China Light and Power (CLP) Group, \nMitsubishi, and the Electricity Generating Public Company. The CLP \nGroup  is  a  leading  power  utility  in  Asia  with  more  than  30  power \ngeneration  assets  and  distribution  businesses  throughout  the  Asia \nand Pacific region. The group is rated A\u2212/stable by Standard & Poor\u2019s \nand A2/stable by Moody\u2019s. Mitsubishi, Japan\u2019s largest general trading \ncompany,  has  managed  businesses  in  a  wide  range  of  industries \nincluding  energy,  metals,  machinery,  chemicals,  food,  and  general \nmerchandise. Mitsubishi is rated A+/stable by Standard & Poor\u2019s and \nA1/stable by  Moody\u2019s.  The Electricity Generating Public Company is \nThailand\u2019s first and largest independent power producer. \n \nThe  final  rating  reflects  the  guaranteed  offtake  arrangements  with  a \nstrong  government  utility  (EGAT),  the  leading  technology  and  long-\nterm  warranties  from  Sharp,  a  pioneer  in  the  solar  industry,  and  the \nlocal and  international  power  sector  expertise  of  the sponsors  (CLP, \nMitsubishi  and  Electricity  Generating  Public  Company),  offset  by  the \nlonger  tenor  of  ADB's  facility,  exposure  to  movements  in  wholesale \nelectricity  market  rates  post-adder  and  the  greenfield  nature  of  the \nProject, which has no track record of operations.  A higher rating may \nbe warranted once a stable level of operations has been achieved.      \n \nThe justification for ADB\u2019s assistance for the project is based on the \nvalue  that  ADB  can  add  to  the  project  and  its  development  impact \nand demonstration effects. The project merits ADB\u2019s support because \n(i) ADB\u2019s assistance is consistent with its country partnership strategy \nfor  Thailand  2007\u20132011  and  country  operations  business  plan,  both \nof which are built on infrastructure development and environmentally \nsustainable  development  as  core  strategic  areas  of  partnership; \n(ii) the  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  strategy  of  diversifying  its \nenergy mix and securing its supply from domestic resources; (iii) the \n\n\fiii \n\nproject will help the government meet its target of using energy from \nrenewable  sources  to  fill  20.4%  of  the  country\u2019s  primary  commercial \nenergy  needs  by  2022;  (iv) the  project  will  demonstrate \nthe \ncommercial viability of large-scale private sector solar farms, a model \nthat other private sector investors can then replicate in Thailand and \nelsewhere in the region; (vi) ADB assistance will play a crucial role in \nhelping the project to obtain appropriate long-term financing, which is \na  necessary  condition  for  the  viability  of  a  solar  project;  and  (vii) \nwithout  the  availability  of  ADB's  loan  or  guarantee,    pre-financed \nCERs  from  the  Future  Carbon  Fund  and  the  proposed  GCI,  it  is \nunlikely  that  the  Project  would  meet  the  Sponsors'  minimum  hurdle \nrates to implement the project.  \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  either  a \nproposed loan for the Solar Power Project up to the lesser of $70,000,000 equivalent in baht (or \ndollars if for any reason baht is not available) and 25% of project costs, from the ordinary capital \nresources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  without  government  guarantee,  or  a  partial \ncredit  guarantee  issued  by  ADB  to  eligible  lenders  to  the  Natural  Energy  Development \nCompany  (NED),  and  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  component  of \ninvestment  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2,000,000  to  the  Natural  Energy  Development \nCompany to be financed on a grant basis provided by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean \nEnergy  Financing  Partnership  Facility1   to  cover  a  portion  of  the  contingency  funding  for  the \nSolar Power Project. If approved, the project will constitute ADB\u2019s third private sector investment \nin Thailand.  \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\nTo  implement  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  20202 and  the  Thailand  country  strategy  by  supporting \n2. \nclean energy projects, ADB worked with Thailand's Ministry of Finance to organize a seminar on \nthe  financing  of  clean  energy  projects.  The  seminar  was  held  in  Bangkok  and  generated \nconsiderable  interest  among  clean  energy  project  sponsors  and  financial  institutions.  After  the \nseminar, ADB identified the proposed project as one of the best in environmental sustainability, \nfinancial  and  technical  feasibility,  potential  for  carbon  emission  reduction,  and  demonstration \nimpact.  \n \n3. \nSolar energy is an abundant resource throughout Thailand and can represent a potential \nof more than 50,000 megawatts (MW) in installed power capacity, 3 according to measurements \nof average solar irradiation over the last 20 years.4 The project will pioneer in demonstrating the \ncommercial viability of large-scale private sector solar farms, a model that other private sector \ninvestors  can  then  replicate  in  Thailand  and  elsewhere  in  the  region.  The  photovoltaic  power \nplant to be built under the project is expected to be one of the largest in the world.  \n \n4. \nThis  project  and  its  potential  demonstrational  impact  will  benefit  from  a  confluence  of \nunique  factors.  The  sound  track  record  of  China  Light  and  Power  (CLP),  Mitsubishi,  and  the \nElectricity  Generating  Public  Company  (EGCO)  (the  project  sponsors);  the  commitment  of  the \nGovernment  of  Thailand  to  clean  energy  through  a  supportive  feed-in  tariff;  regulatory  stability; \nand achievements of the solar industry worldwide\u2014all these will mitigate the challenges that often \ngo with large-scale solar projects. Moreover, ADB\u2019s combination of financial products will bolster \nthe viability of the project. Without prefinanced certified emission reductions (CERs) from ADB\u2019s \nFuture  Carbon  Fund  (FCF),  ADB\u2019s  long-term  financing  and  the  CEFPF\u2019s  GCI,  the  project  is \nunlikely to meet the sponsors' minimum hurdle rates for implementation. The innovative structure \nof the grant component of investment (GCI) will significantly reduce the risk of introducing thin-film \nphotovoltaic technology on a large scale by increasing the confidence of private sector investors \n                                                 \n1 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain and Sweden \n2 ADB.  2008.

ADB\u2019s long-term local currency \nloan  (or  PCG)  will  give  NED  the  tenor  it  needs  to  fund  a  power  generation  plant  with  high \ninvestment  costs  up front  but  no  ongoing  fuel  costs.  ADB\u2019s  presence  will  also  encourage  local \ncommercial banks with less experience in clean energy projects to commit to the project.  \n\nB. \n\nSector Overview \n\nThailand  is  a  large  consumer  of  electricity.  As  of  June  2009,  its  installed  power \n5. \ngeneration  capacity  was  28,482  MW,  70%  of  this  from  natural  gas  and  21%  from  coal  and \nlignite. Its recent energy policy has stressed the importance of diversifying and securing sources \nof  fuel  for  power  generation.  Overreliance  on  natural  gas,  coupled  with  exposure  to  oil  price \nvolatility,  has  magnified  the  country\u2019s  political  and  economic  risk.  The  country  continues  to \ndepend on imports as domestic demand for commercial primary energy outpaces the discovery \nof indigenous oil and gas.  \n \nEnergy consumption in Thailand is growing much faster than the gross domestic product, \n6. \nreflecting  the  increasing  share  of  energy  investment.  Energy  consumption  is  responsible  for \nmore than 50% of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.5 If unchecked, the rapid growth in \nenergy  consumption  will  increase  carbon  intensity  in  the  economy.  In  the  second  revision  of \nThailand\u2019s  Power  Development  Plan  2007 6 ,  published  in  2009,  the  Electricity  Generating \nAuthority  of  Thailand  (EGAT)  projected  a  4.9%  average  growth  in  net  electricity  generation \ndemand  and  a  5.4%  annual  average  increase  in  peak  demand  between  2008  and  2021.  The \nenergy  technology  choices  Thailand  makes  now  will  therefore  have  important  implications  for \nclimate change in the region in the long term.  \n \n7. \nFortunately,  Thailand  has  abundant  renewable  energy  sources\u2014biomass,  biogas, \nmini-hydro,  solar,  and  wind.  Using  these  domestic  sources  of  renewable  energy  can  boost \nThailand\u2019s  energy  security,  save  foreign  exchange,  and  protect  the  country  from  global  price \nfluctuations.  As  part  of  the  strategy  of  diversifying  the  energy  mix  and  promoting  renewable \nenergy,  the  government  has  prepared  an  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan7 (2008\u20132022) \nand  set  a  target  of  20.4%  for  primary  commercial  energy  from  renewable  energy  sources  by \n2022.  This  implies  a  renewable  energy  capacity  of  5,608  MW  by  2022,  a  significant  increase \nfrom the present 1,750 MW. 8  \n \n8.  \nTo  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy  the  Ministry  of  Energy  is  advocating \ndecentralized power generation mainly by supporting the country\u2019s Small Power Producer (SPP) \nand Very Small Power Producer (VSPP) programs. The SPP program allows private developers \nto  build,  own,  and  operate  10\u201390 MW  power  projects  and  enter  into  power  purchase \nagreements (PPAs) with EGAT. Under the VSPP program, on the other hand, producers of up \nto  10  MW  may  sell  power  to  the  Metropolitan  Electricity  Authority  (MEA)  and  the  Provincial \nElectricity  Authority  (PEA).  The  country\u2019s  118  VSPPs  contribute  less  than  1%  to  total  power \ngeneration,  but  the  60  SPPs  account  for  10%.9 Renewable  energy  SPPs  and  VSPPs  can  get \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2009.

Solar energy projects \nreceive  a  fixed  adder  subsidy  of  B8  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  for  10  years  from  the  start  of \ncommercial operations.  \n \nOver  the  past  2  decades,  solar  power  has  become  more  and  more  economically \n9. \nattractive. Grid-connected solar photovoltaic generation systems are the fastest growing in the \nworld: cumulative installed capacity grew by 50% yearly in 2006 and 2007 to 7.8 GW by the end \nof  2007.10 According  to  the  Annual  Energy  Outlook  2009,11 the  capacity  costs  of  new  plants \nusing  solar  photovoltaics  will  be  37%  lower  by  2030  than  the  2009  costs.  At  the  same  time, \nelectricity from conventional sources will cost more to generate; thus, electricity prices will go up \nin  places  like  Thailand  that  have  large  numbers  of  gas-fired  power  plants.  By  2030,  cheaper \nsolar  energy  and  higher-cost  conventional  power  generation  are  expected  to  approach  grid \nparity.  With  these  trends  converging,  global  installed  solar  capacity  in  2020  could  be  20\u201340 \ntimes what it is today. \n \n10. \nThe  project  will  be  the  first  to  demonstrate  the  capacity  of  large-scale  solar  projects  to \nmeet  power  needs  in  Thailand.  After  a  large-scale  private  sector  solar  farm  is  shown  to  be \nfeasible, other private sector investors can replicate the model in Thailand and other developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs).  Small-scale  solar  power  has  been  around  for  many  years,  mainly \nproviding  energy  to  communities  with  no  access  to  the  national  power  grid.  There  are  32 \ngrid-connected  solar  rooftop  projects  with  a  generating  capacity  of  0.14  MW,  and  many  small \noff-grid  solar  VSPP  projects  producing  a  total  of  32  MW.  In  addition,  a  few  small  solar  farms, \nsponsored by EGAT and the private sector, have a generating capacity of less than 2.2 MW.12 \nThailand\u2019s  Alternative  Energy  Policy  projects  solar  power  to  grow  from  34  MW  to  500  MW  by \n2022 (footnote 6). \n\nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \n\n11. \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  supports  environmentally  sustainable,  private  sector\u2013assisted \ndevelopment  in  meeting  the  growing  energy  demand  in  the  region,  even  as  it  capitalizes  on \nADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure development and finance, among other areas. The \nstrategy seeks the expansion of environmentally friendly technologies, specifically for clean and \nefficient  energy  generation  and  use,  and  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure \nfinancing through public\u2013private partnerships. \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Country Strategy \n\n12. \nThe main constraints on sustainable economic growth are the central concerns of ADB\u2019s \npartnership with Thailand. The country partnership strategy for Thailand 2007\u2013201113 is directed \nat  three  core  strategic areas\u2014infrastructure,  environmental  sustainability,  and  capital  markets. \nThe  government\u2019s  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  approved  by  the  Cabinet  on \n28 January 2009,  notes  the  immense  potential  of  Thailand\u2019s  solar  energy  and  the  savings  on \nenergy imports that can be made through its use, with private sector investment. \n\n                                                 \n10 Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21). 2008.

Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with Energy Policy \n\nADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy 14  gives  emphasis  to  investments  in  energy  efficiency  and \n13. \nrenewable  energy  projects,  and  in  wider  access  to  energy.  In  2013,  ADB  will  raise  its  clean \nenergy  investment  target  to  $2  billion  a  year  from  the  present  $1  billion,  in  a  bid  to  speed  up \nlow-carbon  growth  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  region.  The  policy  also \nunderscores ADB\u2019s continued financial and technical support for projects that qualify for carbon \ncredits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. The proposed \nproject is expected to benefit from the prefinancing of CERs by ADB's Carbon Market Initiative \n(CMI).  The  CMI  team  has  been  working  on  the  CDM  component  with  the  project  sponsors, in \nparallel with the ADB loan discussions. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n1.  \n\nThe Borrower and the Sponsors \n\n \n\n14. \nThe  project  is  sponsored  by  a  unique  partnership  that  combines  regional  leadership, \noperating  and  technical  expertise,  and  strong  local  presence.  The  borrower,  NED,  is  a  joint \nventure in which the sponsors\u2014CLP Thailand Renewables (a wholly owned subsidiary of CLP \nHoldings),  Diamond  Generating  Asia  (a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Mitsubishi),  and  EGCO\u2014\neach hold a 33.33% share. NED, headquartered in Bangkok, has the primary aim of developing, \nowning, managing, and operating renewable energy projects in the region.15  \n \n15. \nCLP Thailand Renewables, established as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CLP \nHoldings Limited (CLP), will hold a 33.3% stake in NED. CLP is one of the leading power utilities \nin Asia with more than 30 power generation assets and distribution businesses throughout the \nAsia  and  Pacific  region.  CLP  has  equity  in  about  6,400 MW  of  generating  assets  in  Australia, \nIndia,  Thailand,  and  Taipei,China.  In  Hong  Kong,  China,  CLP  operates  a  vertically  integrated \nelectricity  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  business  with  an  installed  capacity  of \n6,908 MW and a transmission capacity of 12,000 kilometers (km). It supplies electricity to about \n80% of the population of Hong Kong, China. CLP is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. \nCLP  has  a  strong  commitment  to  renewable  energy.  The  group,  in  2004,  set  a  target  of \ngenerating 5% of its output from renewable sources by 2010 and met the target 3 years ahead \nof  time.  It  has  also  expanded  into  solar  energy  through  its  Australian  subsidiary,  TRUenergy, \nwhich is developing a solar power station in Melbourne.  \n \n16. \nCLP is rated A\u2212/stable/A\u22122 by Standard & Poor\u2019s and A2/stable by Moody\u2019s. This rating \nreflects the group\u2019s strong liquidity, favorable regulatory environment, good liability management, \nand  significant  financial  flexibility.  CLP  plans  to  increase  its  financial  leverage,  but  it  has \nmaintained  good  access  to  the  capital  markets  despite  tightening  global  financial  markets. \nCLP\u2019s  market  capitalization  is  about  HK$126.6 billion  ($16.3 billion)  and  the  group  revenue  in \n2008 was about HK$54.3 billion ($7.0 billion) and net income HK$10.4 billion ($1.3 billion). \n \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n15 NED  has  given  its  assurance  that  if  it  develops  and  owns  other  renewable  energy  projects,  there  will  be  no \ncommingling  of  costs,  revenues,  accounts,  properties,  or  assets  with  the  project  (excluding  in  respect  of  any \ncommon facilities) and there  will  be  no cross-default among the facilities  for  different  projects. Any encumbrance \nover  common  facilities  used  by  the  project  and  other  projects  will  be  subject  to  lenders  agreeing  to  customary \nnon-disturbance agreements.  \n\n\fThe  second  sponsor,  Mitsubishi,  is  Japan\u2019s  largest  general  trading  company  and  has \n17. \nmanaged  businesses  in  a  wide  range  of  industries,  including  energy,  metals,  machinery, \nchemicals,  food,  and  general  merchandise.  Mitsubishi  brings  an  expansive  network  to  the \npartnership,  as  it  has  more  than  45  years  of  experience  operating  in  Thailand,  with  nearly \n100 joint-venture  investment  companies  in  the  country.  Mitsubishi  has  developed,  sponsored, \nand invested in numerous power projects in the Australia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Southeast Asia, \nthe United Kingdom, and the United States with gross capacity of about 11,500 MW. Through \nOneEnergy Limited, a 50:50 joint venture of Mitsubishi and CLP, Mitsubishi has equity interests \nin  Taipei,China\u2019s  Ho  Ping  Coal-Fired  Power  Station,  with  capacity  of  1,320 MW,  and  various \npower  plants  in  Thailand  through  the  investment  in  EGCO,  in  which  OneEnergy  has  a  22.4% \nstake. In 2009, Mitsubishi signed an agreement with Acciona to acquire a 34% equity interest in \nAmper  Central  Solar  S.A.,  which  developed  and  operates  one  of  the  world\u2019s  largest  solar \nphotovoltaic projects (45.8 MW) in Amareleja, Portugal. \n \n18.  Mitsubishi  is  rated  A+/stable/A\u22121  by  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  and  A1/stable  by  Moody\u2019s.  It \nrepresents diverse and profitable business segments with particular strength in the energy and \nmetal  resources  divisions.  The  rating  reflects  its  strong  and  sustainable  franchise,  improved \nfinancial  fundamentals  over  the  past  several  years,  including  sharp  increase  in  earnings  and \ndeleveraging,  strong  funding  ability  and  good  management  team,  and  the  challenge  of \nsignificant concentration in the current deteriorating domestic and global business environment. \nFor the year that ended on 31  March 2009, Mitsubishi Corporation recorded total revenues of \n\u00a56,146.4 billion  ($62.1 billion)  and  posted  a  consolidated  net \nincome  of  \u00a5369.9 billion \n($3.7 billion). \n \nThe  third  sponsor,  EGCO,  is  Thailand\u2019s  first  independent  power  producer.  It  was \n19. \nincorporated in 1992 and was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 1995. EGCO\u2019s major \nshareholders are EGAT (25.4%) and OneEnergy Thailand (22.4%). EGCO has investments in \npower  generation  and  supply,  as  well  as  comprehensive  energy  services  providing  operation, \nmaintenance,  engineering,  and  construction  services  to  power  plants  and  other  industries  in \nThailand and overseas. EGCO has a total power generating capacity of 3,836 MW from a total \nof  13  power  plants.  The  company  focuses  its  investments  in  power  generation,  both \ndomestically  and  abroad,  specifically  within  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \nfour  main  businesses: \ncountries.  The  company  has \n(i) independent power producers (IPPs, 3,507 MW); (ii) small power producers (SPPs, 302 MW); \n(iii) overseas power producers (27 MW); and (iv) other related businesses.  \n \nEGCO  is  regarded  as  a  company  with  high  corporate  governance  standards  and \n20. \ntechnical expertise. Through its experience in managing a large portfolio of IPPs and SPPs in \nThailand, EGCO will contribute not only technical expertise but also understanding of the SPP \nProgram and renewable energy policies in Thailand.  \n\ninvestments  and  subsidiaries \n\nin \n\n  \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n21. \nThe  project  entails  the  construction  of  a  55 MWp  solar  generation  plant  in  the  Lopburi \nprovince of Central Thailand. The development and implementation of the SPP will be covered \nby  a  5-year,  automatically  renewable  PPA  between  EGAT  and  NED  under  the  SPP  Program. \nEGAT  will  purchase  all  energy  output  of  the  plant  up  to  55 MW,  the  maximum  defined  in  the \nPPA. The project will use innovative thin-film photovoltaic technology and is expected to be one \nof the largest solar photovoltaic projects in the world. In addition, the project is working with ADB \nfor the prefinancing of CERs under ADB\u2019s CMI.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProject Output and Outcome \n\n22. \nThe  project\u2019s  output  will  be  Thailand\u2019s  first  large,  utility-scale  solar  power  generating \nfacility  (55 MWp).  Through  its  development,  construction,  and  operation,  its  personnel  will \nacquire the skills to facilitate the spread of solar power projects in the region.  \n \n23. \nThe project\u2019s outcome will be the demonstration of the profitability and sustainability of a \nlarge-scale solar power farm. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduced is one of \nthe indicators, in addition to the usual financial and operations indicators.  \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\n24. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  result  from  the  demonstration  effect  of  the  feasibility  and \nsustainability of a large-scale private sector solar farm, a model that can be replicated by other \nprivate  sector  investors  in  Thailand  and  other  DMCs.  Through  the  project  itself,  as  well  as \nthrough  the  anticipated  replication,  Thailand\u2019s  energy  mix  will  be  diversified  by  adding \nrenewable energy capacity, thereby helping the country to meet its target of 20.4% of primary \ncommercial energy coming from renewable energy by 2022.  \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n25. \nSolar  energy  holds  the  most  potential  of  all  renewable  energy  sources  in  Thailand, \npossibly offering more than 50,000 MW of installed capacity (footnote 6). The project will be the \nfirst to demonstrate this unrealized potential for large-scale solar projects to meet power needs \nin  the  region.  The  project  will  establish  the  commercial  viability  of  large-scale  solar  farms \nconnected to the grid and set off the necessary growth in the sector by advancing a model that \ncan be replicated by other private sector investors throughout the region.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n26. \nThe  quantifiable  economic  benefits  from  the  project  include  the  value  of  power  as  an \ninput  to  economic  activity,  the  premium  for  solar  power  as  a  stable  source,  and  the \nenvironmental  advantage  of  clean  energy.  The  economic  costs  include  the  cost  of  evacuating \nthe  power  to  the  grid.  The  calculated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  12%,  higher  than  the \nsocial discount rate of 10%.16  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n27. \nThe project has been classified as category B for environment because it is unlikely to \ncreate  any  significant  environmental  impact  during  construction  and  operation.  Although  the \nMinistry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  does  not  require  an  environmental  impact \nassessment for solar power projects, NED commissioned a comprehensive environmental and \nsocial assessment for the project to ensure that the project will be environmentally sound and \nacceptable to the local communities. The environmental and social assessment was completed \nin  early  December  2009  and  its  major  findings  and  conclusions  are  presented  in  a  summary \ninitial  environmental  examination  in  Appendix  1.  The  project  location  is  not  within  or  near  any \n\n                                                 \n16 According to the Good Practice Standards for Private Sector Investment Operations of the Evaluation Cooperation \n\nGroup (GPS-PIO), a project is satisfactory if its economic internal rate of return is 10% or higher. \n\n \n\n\fecologically  or  culturally  sensitive  area,  and  the  15  km  transmission  line  will  be  within  the \nexisting right-of-way along the roads. \n\n \n28. \nDuring  construction,  the  project  will  create  only  minor  and  transient  environmental \ndisturbances such as dust and noise from project site leveling, transportation of materials and \nequipment,  assembly  of  photovoltaic  panel  supports,  construction  of  a  small  control  building, \nlaying  of  cables,  and  installation  of  inverters  and  other  electrical  equipment.  At  its  peak  the \nconstruction will require not more than 500 transported workers, most of whom would be hired \nfrom  local  communities.  Domestic  wastes  from  the  construction  workers  will  be  adequately \nmanaged on-site. The construction will create only a small incremental increase in traffic due to \nthe transportation of materials, which will be managed to ensure public safety. Fugitive dust at \nthe  project  site  will  be  minimized  through  frequent  water  spraying.  During  operation,  the  solar \npower  plant  will  not  have  emissions  apart  from  domestic  wastewater  from  about  40  operating \npersonnel. \n  \n29. \nThe project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. Land required for the \nproject is not occupied and prices have been negotiated with individual landowners on a willing \nbuyer\u2013willing seller basis. The purchase price is based on prevailing market prices, which are \nabove the Department of Land\u2019s appraised prices for land transaction tax purposes. The plant \nwill  be  connected  to  the  existing  Chai  Ba  Dan  2  Substation,  through  a  15 km,  115 kV \ntransmission  line,  which  will  be  built  using  the  right-of-way  of  an  existing  22 kV  line.  No \nindigenous peoples live within or close to the project site; therefore, the project is classified as \ncategory C for indigenous peoples.17 \n \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nPower Purchase Agreement \n\n30. \nNED\u2019s net generating capacity is 55 MWp (73 MWp gross capacity), to be sold to EGAT \nunder  the  SPP  program.  Under  the  PPA  with  EGAT,  EGAT  has  committed  itself  to  buy  all \ngenerated electricity from the project up to 55 MW at the regulated PEA wholesale rate18 plus \nan adder incentive for solar projects. The adder incentive (feed-in tariff) of B8 per kWh will apply \nfor 10 years from start of commercial operations. The PPA will contract the parties for an initial \nperiod of 5 years, with continual automatic extensions, unless the NED terminates the PPA or \neither party terminates following a breach of the PPA which is not cured. This PPA is EGAT\u2019s \nstandard  PPA  for  all  similar  SPPs,  and  the  risk  of  nonrenewal  or  renegotiation  may  be \nconsidered minimal since EGAT is obligated to renew the PPA without amendment, unless NED \nis  in  breach  of  the  PPA.  Details  of  the  interconnection,  metering,  and  payment  arrangements \nare covered in the PPA.  \n \n31. \nEGAT  was  established  in  1969  as  a  state  enterprise  by  the  Electricity  Generating \nAuthority of Thailand Act, B. E. 2511 (1968). EGAT is the country\u2019s largest electricity generator, \nthe  single  wholesale  purchaser  of  electricity,  the  system  operator  and  dispatcher  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  system-wide  electricity  generation,  the  owner  and  operator  of  Thailand\u2019s  wholesale \ntransmission network, and the sole supplier of electricity to Thailand\u2019s two electricity distribution \nauthorities, MEA, and PEA. As of 2009, the total installed capacity was 28,482 MW, comprising \n13,615 MW (48%) from  EGAT\u2019s power plants, 14,224 MW (50%) from  domestic private power \nproducers  (IPPs  and  SPPs),  and  640 MW  (2%)  purchased  from  neighboring  countries.  Under \n                                                 \n17 In Thailand, the majority of indigenous peoples are hill tribes in the northern region. \n18 The current wholesale tariff is B3.84 for peak generation and B2.03 for off-peak generation. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nincluding \n\nthis  project.  EGAT\u2019s \n\nthe Renewable Portfolio Standard, EGAT must produce or purchase 5% of its new generating \ncapacity in 2008\u20132010 from renewable sources. To meet this obligation EGAT must produce or \npurchase 140.7 MW of renewable energy, from sources such as private power producers under \nthe  SPP  Program, \ntransmission  network  comprises \n30,219 circuit-kilometer  lines  and  209  high-voltage  substations.  EGAT  has  maintained  a  high \nstandard of system reliability.  \n \nEGAT  is  rated  BBB+/negative19 for  foreign  currency  obligations  and  BBB+/negative  for \n32. \nlocal currency obligations by Standard & Poor\u2019s. EGAT has never defaulted on any of its debt \nobligations  and  is  considered  one  of  the  strongest  off-takers  in  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  EGAT  receives \nsovereign  support  from  the  Government  of  Thailand  and  this  support  is  expected  to  continue \nbecause of (i) the dominant and important service EGAT provides to the electricity sector, and \nto a large extent to the Thai economy as a whole; (ii) the legislative requirement that obligates \nthe  government  to  cover  any  deficiencies  in  its  cash  flows; 20  (iii) the  current  government \nguarantees  for  its  debt  obligations;21 and  (iv) the  government\u2019s  financial  interest  in  the  wholly \nowned  state  utility.  For  these  reasons,  EGAT\u2019s  credit  ratings  are  likely  to  remain  linked  to  the \nsovereign ratings of the Government of Thailand. \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n\n2. \n\nSelected Photovoltaic Technology  \n\n33. \nA  solar  cell  is  an  electronic  device  which  directly  converts  the  sunlight  into  electricity \nthrough  the  \"photoelectric  effect\"  thus  the  solar  cell  produces  both  current  and  voltage  to \ngenerate  electric  power.  This  process  requires  a  special  material,  a  photosensitive \nsemiconductor  enriched  with  other  complementary  elements,  in  which  the  absorption  of  light \nraises their electrons to a higher energy state. These electrons move from the solar cell into an \nexternal electrical circuit, dissipate their energy there, return unloaded to the cell and begin the \nprocess  over  again.  The  silicon  material  used  for  solar  cells  can  be  single-crystalline,  multi-\ncrystalline, poly-crystalline  or  amorphous.    The  two  main  categories  of  technology  are  defined \nby the choice of the semiconductor\u2014either crystalline silicon in wafer form or thin films of other \nmaterials. \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nMonocrystalline  silicon.  This  is  the  most  efficient  technology  to  date.  The \nphotovoltaic  cell  is  made  from  single  crystals  of  silicon.  Research  cells  have \nreached nearly 28% efficiency; commercial modules of single-crystal cells, more \nthan 18%. \n\nMulti-crystalline  silicon.  Multi-crystalline  silicon  is  manufactured  more  cheaply \nthan monocrystalline silicon, with the cells being cut from an ingot of melted and \nrecrystallized silicon. These cells are less efficient than single-crystal silicon cells. \nResearch  cells  approach  24%  efficiency,  and  commercial  modules,  16% \nefficiency. \n\n(iii) \n\nThin  film.  Various  materials,  such  as  amorphous  silicon,  cadmium  telluride \n(CdTe),  and  copper  indium  diselenide  (CIS),  are  used  to  make  thin-film \n\n                                                 \n19 S&P revised its outlook to negative on 2 December 2008 after taking similar action on the sovereign credit ratings \n\nfor Thailand, which is rated BBB+/negative.  \n\n20 EGAT Act contemplates that budget support may be available if EGAT cannot obtain funds from other sources.  \n21 Sovereign guarantees cover all of EGAT\u2019s foreign debt and about half of its domestic debt.  \n\n\fphotovoltaic  cells.  These  are  technologies  with  lower  efficiencies  than  those  for \ncrystalline silicon photovoltaic cells but have cheaper material costs.  \n\n \n34. \nThe  sponsors  have  selected  thin-film  photovoltaic  technology  after  in-depth  analysis  of \nlocal  conditions,  on-site  measurements,  and  competitive  bidding.  Amorphous  silicon  thin-film \nsolar  cells  will  be  used  in  the  project.  Thin-film  technology  was  selected  for  the  following \nreasons.  Thin-film  solar  cells  are  relatively  lower  in  production  cost  than  other  types  of \nphotovoltaic  cells.  Moreover,  thin-film  photovoltaic  cells  are  better  at  absorbing  sunlight \napproaching  the  cell  from  different  directions  and  at  maintaining  efficiency  under  different \nirradiations.  Therefore,  thin-film  photovoltaic  technology  better  suits  Thailand\u2019s  climatic \nenvironment  (irradiation  profile)  because  it  does  not  require  near-perfect  solar  conditions. \nClouds and overcast conditions at times create diffuse light, which cannot be concentrated but \nstill  produces  energy  on  thin-film  photovoltaic  panels.  Besides  irradiation,  thin-film  solar  cells \noffer better relative performance in climates with higher average temperatures. In general, solar \ncells become less able to convert the solar energy into electrical power (conversion efficiency) \nas the temperature increases. Thin-film solar cells, however, decrease in conversion efficiency \nmore slowly than other solar cells.  \n \n35. \nThe  market  for  thin-film  solar  cells  has  been  growing  rapidly.  In  recent  years, \nmanufacturers of thin-film solar cells have brought production costs down and tried to achieve \ncompetitive  strengths  through  more  advanced  thin-film  technology.  This  is  evidenced  by  the \nrapid  growth  in  market share  of  thin-film  solar cells in  the United  States,  to  44% in  2006  from \nless  than  10%  in  2003.  The  European  Photovoltaic  Industry  Association  expects  annual \nproduction capacity for thin-film technology to double to more than 4 GW by 2010. Overall, solar \nphotovoltaic  installations  reached  a  record  high  of  15  GW  in  2008.  Europe\u2019s  installed \nphotovoltaic  capacity  of  9 GW  is  65%  of  this  total,  Japan\u2019s  2.1 GW  is  15%,  and  the \nUnited States\u2019 1.2 GW is 8%. \n\n3. \n\nEngineering, Procurement, and Construction \n\n36. \nAfter  competitive  bidding,  the  sponsors  have  selected  Sharp  Corporation  and  the \nItalian-Thai  Development  Public  Company  (ITD)  as  the  engineering,  procurement,  and \nconstruction  (EPC)  contractors.  They  will  use  thin-film  photovoltaic  cells  produced  by  Sharp.22 \nSharp will provide the key items of equipment (including the solar panels), and ITD will provide \nall onshore construction and engineering services. Sharp and ITD are jointly and severally liable \nunder  the  supply  and  construction  arrangements.

The  loan  documentation  between  ADB  and  NED  will  further  allow \nADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\n41. \nThe project sponsors have expressed their interest in working actively with ADB on an \nintegrated basis, including debt financing through ADB, a GCI from the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership  Facility,  and  possible  carbon  credit\u2013based  cofinancing  through  ADB\u2019s  Future \nCarbon  Fund.  The  project  will  therefore  allow  ADB  and  the  Clean  Energy  Program  to \ndemonstrate  the  range  and  depth  of  products  that  ADB  can  provide  for  renewable  energy \nprojects in the DMCs. \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1.  \n\nLoan or Guarantee \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f \n42. \nThe proposed ADB facility of up to $70 million equivalent in baht or 25% of total project \ncosts,  whichever  is  lower,  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  without \ngovernment  guarantee.  Interest  during  the  grace  period  may  be  capitalized.  The  loan  may  be \ndisbursed in baht or in dollars if for any reason baht is not available. \n \n\n2. \n\nGrant Component of Investment \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n\n \n43.  While there are no fuel costs during the operating phase, solar technology requires very \nhigh  investment  costs  up front.  These  comparatively  high  costs  make  the  technology  less \neconomically  attractive  to  private  sector  investors  aiming  for  larger-scale  solar  operations, \nbecause they entail significant risks. Power projects need contingency funds to cover risks that \nare directly related to total project capital expenditure. For solar power projects, the contingency \nfunds  per  MW  of  installed  generation  capacity  are  large  because  of  their  very  high  capital \nexpenditures. Moreover, this will be a first-mover project: it will be one of the largest photovoltaic \npower  plants  in  the  world  and  will  use  highly  complex,  innovative  thin  film  photovoltaic \ntechnology. The project will therefore bear additional risks, which will also have to be covered by \ncontingency  funds  to  provide  comfort  to  private  sector  investors  and  lenders.  A  conventional \ngas-fired power plant in Thailand requires contingency funds of only $15,000\u2013$20,000 per MW \nof  installed  capacity,  versus  $200,000  for  the  project.  These  contingency  funds  have  to  be \nfinanced and will involve financing costs in the case that they have to be drawn down, resulting \nin incremental risks to the Project's debt service capability and therefore constitute a barrier to \nthe financing and implementation of the Project.  \n \n44. \nThe  proposed  GCI  from  the  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership  Facility  (footnote  1),  amounting  to  $2 million  would  support  the  implementation  of \nthe  project, which  will  be  the  first  to  demonstrate  the  capacity  of  a  large-scale solar  project  to \nmeet  the  power  needs  in  Thailand,  and  to  prove  the  feasibility  of  thin-film  photovoltaic \ntechnology  for  utility-scale  power  generation.  Specifically,  the  CEFPF  funds  would  cover  a \nportion  of  the  contingency  in  the  event  that  the  project  has  to  draw  down  additional  funds  for \nproject costs, which represents a key risk associated with solar power projects and a barrier to \ntheir  funding  and  implementation,  as  mentioned  above.  The  CEFPF  funds  may  be  applied \ndirectly  by  NED  to  cover  additional  project  costs  being  ADB  member  country  goods  and \nservices for up to $2 million.  ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to tie) will apply to \nthe  GCI  funds.  The  CEFPF  funds  may  help  to  overcome  the  gap  and  significantly  reduce  an \ninherent risk of introducing new thin-film photovoltaic technology on a large scale. However, if \nthe project can be implemented successfully without drawing down the contingency funds, the \nCEFPF funds will not be used and can be allocated to another project.  \n \n45. \nThis innovative structure may ease the critical constraint on solar power investment by \nincreasing the confidence of private sector investors in the sustainability of the new technology, \nwhile  pursuing  private  sector  efficiency  and  commercial  independence  without  subsidy  in  the \noriginal implementation plan.  \n \n\nClean Development Mechanism  \n\n3. \n \n46. \nThe  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM),  established  under  the  Kyoto  Protocol  and \nmanaged  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  will  provide \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fadditional financing for the development of renewable energy projects. The proposed project is \nlikely to be eligible for carbon financing. \n \n47. \nADB has taken several initiatives to bring climate change considerations into its funding \nmainstream.  The  current  CDM  support  program  of  ADB  is  administered  through  the  CMI,  and \nmanaged  by  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department.  The  CMI  has  four \ncomponents:  (i)  up-front  carbon  financing  through  the  Asia  Pacific  Carbon  Fund  (APCF)  for \npre-2012 carbon credits, (ii) up-front carbon financing through FCF for post-2012 carbon credits, \n(iii)  CDM-related  technical  support  through  the  technical  support  facility,  and  (iv)  marketing \nsupport for residual carbon credits through the credit marketing facility. \n \n48. \nThe APCF is a fund established and managed by ADB that cofinances CDM projects in \nthe DMCs by securing a portion of the expected future CERs from CDM-eligible projects (those \ngenerated up to 31 December 2012) in exchange for up-front financing. The FCF can similarly \nprovide up-front financing by purchasing a portion of the first credits that will be generated from \n1 January 2013  to  31  December  2020.  The  technical  support  facility  provides  comprehensive \ntechnical support to project sponsors in developing CDM-eligible projects, thus contributing to a \ncontinuous pipeline of \u201cviable\u201d clean energy projects that may be considered for ADB financing \nand up-front funding from the APCF or the FCF. The credit marketing facility provides marketing \nsupport  to  project  sponsors  in  obtaining  optimal  prices  and  sale  terms  from  third-party \npurchasers of residual CERs not purchased by the APCF or the FCF. \n \n49. \nThe  estimates  of  CER  potential  are  based  on  the  available  CDM  methodology, \nACM0002.  Emission  reductions  under  the  proposed  project,  up  to  2012  based  on  a  10  year \ncrediting  period  starting  on  the  date  of  commissioning  of  the  full  plant, 24  are  estimated  at \n33,300 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). At a reasonably conservative payment-on-delivery price \nof $15 per tCO2e, this could mean revenues of about $0.50 million for the project up to 2012. \nADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Carbon Fund could purchase up to 50% of CERs up front. \n \n50. \nAfter  2012,  emission  reductions  are  estimated  at  400,000  tCO2e  up  to  2020  and \n66,700 tCO2e  after  2020  (based  on  a  10  year  crediting  period  starting  on  the  date  of \ncommissioning  of  the  full  plant).  These  may  amount  to  some  $4.8  million  (assuming  a \nreasonably  conservative  payment-on-delivery  price  of  $12  per  tCO2e  up  to  2020  and  of  $0 \nbeyond 2020). ADB\u2019s Future Carbon Fund may consider purchasing a share of up to 50% of the \nexpected post-2012 CERs up to and including 2020, and pay in advance against delivery of the \nfirst CERs. The terms and conditions for such a potential carbon transaction must be approved \nby the FCF board of directors. \n \n\n                                                 \n24 Construction  of  the  plant  will  be  implemented  phase  by  phase  with  1  month  gap  from  phase  1  to  phase  7.  This \nmeans that commercial operation occurs phase by phase from November 2011 (phase 1) to May 2012 (phase 7). \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nFigure 2: Capex and Operating Costs of Power Plants \n(B million)\n\nCapex and Operating Cost of Solar Power \nProject (per MW) \n\nCapex and Operating Cost of Traditional \nGas-fired Projects (per MW) \n\nContingency  $200,000 \nper MW \n\nCapex \n\nOperating  cost \n(no fuel cost)  \n\nCapex \n\nContingency $15,000 \u2013  \n20,000 per MW\n\n0 \n\n2 \nCOD \n\n25 years \n\n0\n\n2 \nCOD \n\nCAPEX = capital expenditures, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nCompliance with Investment Limitations \n\nOperating  cost \nincluding \nfuel \nt\n\n25 years \n\n \n\n51. \nThe  proposed  transaction,  once  approved  and  signed,  will  increase  ADB's  projected \nnonsovereign exposure by the end of 2010 to $4.2 billion. Additionally, the proposed transaction \nwill increase nonsovereign exposure to the Kingdom of Thailand to $0.2 billion or 3.5% of total \nnonsovereign  exposure  and  will  increase  nonsovereign  exposure  in  the  Renewal  Energy \nGeneration  subsector  to  $0.3  billion  or  6.2%  of  total  nonsovereign  exposure.  The  proposed \nfinancing  is  within  ADB\u2019s  approved  medium-term,  country,  industry,  single  obligor  and  group \nexposure limits for nonsovereign operations. ADB will ensure that the proposed financing up to \na maximum of $70 million will not exceed 25% of total project cost limit at any given point in time. \n\nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\n52. \n\nThe project merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n  \n\n(i)  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  strategy  of  promoting  renewable  energy  to  help \nmeet  the  government\u2019s  target  for  20.4%  of  primary  commercial  energy  to  come  from \nrenewable energy sources by 2022.  \n\n \n(ii)  ADB assistance will play a crucial role in helping the project to obtain financial close and \nappropriate long-term financing, which is a necessary condition for the viability of a solar \nproject.  Due  to  the  recent  credit  crunch,  bank  liquidity  is  limited,  and  local  banks  can \nrarely provide loans for more than 10-12 years. However, tenors required for solar power \ngeneration projects are significantly longer. ADB's long-term local currency loan or, in the \nalternative, guarantee give NED the tenors it needs in order to fund a power generation \nplant  that  has  high  upfront  investment  costs,  but  no  ongoing  fuel  cost.  Without  the \navailability of ADB's long-term loans, the proposed prefinanced CERs from FCF and the \n\n \n\n\fproposed  CGI,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  project  would  meet  the  Sponsors'  minimum  hurdle \nrates to implement the project. \n\n \n(iii)  ADB's facility (or PCG if required) encourages the commitment of local commercial banks, \nwhich have less experience in clean energy projects. Therefore ADB's participation in the \ndebt financing will help facilitating local and/or international bank participation.  \n\n \n(iv)  The  project  will  pioneer  in  demonstrating  the  commercial  viability  of  large-scale  private \nsector solar farms, a model that other private sector investors can then replicate elsewhere \nin  the  region.  The  proposed  project  will  be  the  first  large-scale  power  generation  project \ntapping  into  Thailand\u2019s  abundant  solar  resource,  which  has  more  than  50,000  MW  of \npotential power generation capacity. \n\n \n(v)  The  project  supports  the  government  energy  strategy  to  diversify  its  energy  mix  and \nincrease  security  of supply  from  national  resources.  Thailand  currently  relies  heavily  on \nnatural gas and lignite to a lesser extent as its major sources of fuel for power generation. \n\n \n(vi)  ADB  assistance  for  the  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for \nThailand  2007\u20132011  (footnote  13)  and  Country  Operations  Business  Plan,25 where  the \nthree  core  strategic  areas  of  partnership  are  infrastructure  development,  environmentally \nsustainable development and capital markets development.  \n\nC. \n\nAssurances \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n\n \n \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \n53. \nCharter), 26  the  government  has  been  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the \nproposed  assistance  to  NED.

The \nproject is designed to have a gross generation capacity of 73 megawatts (MWp) of direct current. \nThe alternating current output will be about 57.9 MW, of which about 2.9 MW will be consumed \ninternally  and  the  remaining  55  MW  will  be  sold  to  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of \nThailand (EGAT) through a 115 kilovolt (kV) transmission line to a Provincial Electricity Authority \n(PEA) substation about 15 km away. The project construction is expected to begin in the second \nquarter of 2010 and will take about 24 months to complete.  \n\n \n2. \nThe Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment does not require an environmental \nimpact  assessment  for  solar  power  projects.  Nevertheless,  NED  commissioned  a  local \nconsulting  firm2 to  undertake  an  environmental  and  social  assessment  (ESA)  of  the  project  to \nensure  that  the  project  will  be  absolutely  environmentally  sound  and  acceptable  to  the  local \ncommunities.  The  ESA  was  conducted  from  August  2009  to  early  December  2009.

The project site \nhas  no  irrigation  system  and  is  used  mainly  for  planting  cash  crops,  particularly  cassava  and \nmaize, and also eucalyptus trees. Some parts are unattended land covered by grasses, bushes, \nand shrubs.  \n\n2. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\nThe project site has a humid tropical climate with annual average temperatures ranging \n6. \nfrom  23.6\u00b0C  to  33.7\u00b0C,  average  annual  rainfall  of  1,123.8  millimeters,  and  annual  average \nrelative humidity of 71%. Soil in the project site is of low to medium fertility. The project site is in \na low-seismic-risk region. \n \n7. \nSurface water at the project site is drained by two small, unnamed natural watercourses. \nOne  watercourse  traverses  the  western  part  of  the  project site  in  a  south\u2013north  direction,  and \ndrains water into a natural canal. Another watercourse traverses the eastern part of the project \nsite in a south\u2013north direction, and drains water into another canal.  \n \n8. \nThe  project  site  still  has  good  environmental  quality  as  it  has  no  nearby  industries  or \nurban  communities.  The  two  watercourses  in  the  project  site  are  still  virtually  unpolluted,  as \nindicated by the low levels of biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and oil and \ngrease.  The  dust  level  in  the  ambient  air,  measured  as  total  suspended  particulates  (TSP),  is \nstill lower than the national standard of 0.33 mg/Nm3 (24-hour average). Ambient noise levels in \nthe three nearest communities are below the national standards 24-hour not exceeding 70 dBA \nper 24 hours, and maximum not exceeding 115 dBA. \n\n3. \n\nBiological Environment \n\n9. \nThe project site is not located in or near a sensitive ecosystem. An ecological survey of \nthe project site confirmed the absence of unique or ecologically significant flora and fauna. The \nnearest wildlife sanctuary, Sublanka, is about 60 km away. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\n4. \n\nSocioeconomic Environment \n\n10. \nThe  project  site  has  no  communities.  Two  subdistricts,  Wang  Plerng  and  Khao  Laem, \nare within a 5 km radius of the project site. Wang Plerng has 13 villages with a total population \nof 7,536 living in 1,963 households (April 2009 records). Khao Laem has 8 villages with a total \npopulation  of  3,298  living  in  940  households  (April  2009  records).  Barn  Chonmuang  in \nWang  Plerng Subdistrict, about 650 meters away, is the community nearest to the project site. \nThere  are  no  indigenous  peoples  living  within  or  close  to  the  project  site.  About  90%  of  the \nhouseholds rely on agriculture as their main source of income.  \n\n \n\n5. \n\nHistorical and Cultural Value \n\nThe project site and the surrounding areas have no important historical or cultural sites. \n\n11. \nThere are no records of archeological findings. \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nImpact during Construction \n\nThe project will involve only minor civil, mechanical, and electrical works taking place at \n12. \nmany  locations  within  a  vast  project  site.  The  site  preparation  will  involve  only  minor  leveling, \nand  thus  will  not  significantly  change  the  drainage  pattern.  The  transportation  of  construction \nmaterials  and  project  equipment  will  require  about  15  truck  trips  per  day  during  the  working \nperiod  of  8  hours.  Considering  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  construction  works  and  the \necological  insensitivity  of  the  project  site,  it  is  certain  that  only  minor  and  manageable \nenvironmental disturbances will be created during construction, with minimum impact on nearby \ncommunities  and  the  natural  environment.  Environmental  disturbances  during  construction  will \nbe small and transient, such as dust, noise, incremental traffic loads on the roads, and gaseous \nemissions  created  by  trucks  and  heavy  construction  equipment.  Estimates  of  the  incremental \nincreases in ambient dust and noise levels during construction were made and were found to be \nmarginal. The ambient dust level will increase by 23.51 micrograms per cubic meter and noise \nby 0.7 dBA at the nearest community. \n \n13. \nAs  the  15  km,  115  kV  transmission  line  will  be  constructed  within  the  corridor  of  an \nexisting  22  kV  transmission  line  of  PEA,  there  will  be  no  need  for  any  land  acquisition  or \nclearance.  The  transmission  line  will  therefore  create  minimum  transient  environmental  and \nsocial impact. \n \n14. \nThe  construction  will  require  not  more  than  500  workers,  who  will  reside  outside  the \nproject  site.  No  groundwater  will  be  tapped  at  the  project  site  as  the  project  site  has  low \ngroundwater  potential.  The  water  required  for  construction (concrete  mixing)  and  consumption \nwill  be  brought  in  from  outside  sources.  Domestic  wastewater  generated  by  the  construction \nworkers would not be more than 20 cubic meters per day  and will be treated either in a small \ncentralized package treatment plant or by individual septic tanks, one for each toilet. \n\n \n15. \nThe nature of the construction works indicates that no toxic or hazardous materials will \nbe used, apart from fuel oils for vehicles, which will be properly stored. Construction wastes will \nbe sorted out by the contractors for recycling. The residual wastes will be properly handled by \nthe relevant municipal units for waste disposal. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n2. \n\nImpact during Operations \n\n16. \nUnlike  thermal  power  plants,  the  operation  of  the  project  solar  power  plant  will  have \nnegligible environmental impact on the site during operation. There will be no waste products, \nno requirements for cooling, no moving parts, no noise, and no impact on flora and fauna. The \nlargest impact could be visual. However, as the project site and the surrounding areas have no \nnatural  beauty,  visual  impairment  would  not  be  a  problem.  With  an  old  design  of  solar \nphotovoltaic arrays, reflected sunlight may cause problems if the system is close to a road and \nis facing in a direction in which the reflected sunlight may cause problems. This problem will not \noccur  in  this  project  as  its  solar  photovoltaic  panels  are  of  new  design,  which  can  absorb \nsunlight and eliminate sunlight reflections.  \n \n17. \nuse polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). Therefore, there will be no PCB disposal problem.  \n \n18. \nsmall number of people could be readily handled by conventional practices. \n\nThe project will use transformers of forced-oil and forced-air-cool designs, which do not \n\nOnly about 40 staff will operate the project facilities. Domestic wastes generated by this \n\nE. \n\nSocial Impact \n\nThe project has no resettlement or indigenous peoples (IPs) issues. In August 2009, the \n19. \nproject entered into a land purchase option agreement4 with all 11 landowners to purchase the \nland on a willing-buyer-willing-seller basis, valid for 8 months with a 4-month extension period. \nThe landowners will be allowed to harvest their crops before the project starts construction, in \nline  with  the  requirements  of  the  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  for  negotiated \nsettlement. Only one owner lives on his land and will be allowed to stay on and be employed by \nthe project. Therefore, there will be no relocation issue. The project site has no people identified \nas  IPs.  The  project  is  therefore  expected  to  be  classified  as  category  C  for  both  involuntary \nresettlement and IPs. \n\nF. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\n20. \nAs  the  project  is  virtually  environmentally  benign,  the  institutional  requirements  for \nenvironmental  management  during  construction  and  operation  will  be  minimal.  Nevertheless, \nthe project plans to apply for environmental accreditation through ISO14000.  \n \n21. \nDuring construction, the contractors will be contractually mandated to minimize transient \nenvironmental  disturbances,  using  known  conventional  methods  such  as  water  spraying  to \nminimize dust, the imposition of speed limits on vehicles in the project site, the provision of an \nadequate number of bathrooms and toilets for construction workers, the proper management of \ndomestic wastes (particularly the disposal of food wastes), and the imposition of sanitation and \nwork  safety  rules  and  regulations.  The  project  manager  of  NED  will  closely  monitor  the \ncontractors\u2019 compliance with the environmental and safety clauses of the contracts. TSP levels \nin  the  ambient  air  and  noise  levels  in  the  nearest  communities  will  be  occasionally  monitored \nduring construction. \n\n                                                 \n4 Thus, the sponsors have reached an agreement with the farmers that the project may buy the land at a certain price \n\nif the project is implemented.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\nDuring  the  project  operation,  environmental  management  will  mostly  involve  domestic \n\n22. \nwastes created by about 40 staff. This matter can be readily handled. \n\nG. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosures \n\n23. \nDuring  the  conduct  of  the  ESA,  two  public  consultation  meetings  were  held  at  the  two \nsubdistricts.  In  addition,  a  field  survey  was  also  carried  out  to  collect  basic  socioeconomic \ninformation at the household level and solicit views on the project. Information from the public \nconsultation meetings and the field surveys is summarized in Table A1.3. \n \n\nTable A1.3: Public Consultation Meetings and Field Surveys \n\nSubdistrict \nWang Plerng \n \nKhao Laem \n \nField  Surveys \nsubdistricts) \n \n\n(the \n\ntwo \n\nDate \n31 August 09 \n2 October 09 \n16 September 09 \n21 October 09 \n26\u201330 September 09 \n\n \n\nNumber of Participants \n\n71 \n65 \n114 \n188 \n66 community leaders and \nlocal government officials \n347 persons \n\n       Source: Natural Energy Development Company  \n \n24. \nAs  the  project  will  have  no  significant  environmental  and  social  impact,  the  local \ncommunities  and  community  leaders  did  not  oppose  the  project.  They,  however,  sought \nassistance in community development and support for community cultural events.  \n\nH. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nThe ESA findings establish that the project site is a relatively infertile agricultural land, is \n25. \nnot located in a sensitive ecosystem, and has no historical or cultural value. This nature of the \nproject site, coupled with the clean nature of solar power generation, confirms that the project \nwill not cause any significant, lasting environmental and social impact. Only minor and transient \nenvironmental disturbances will be generated in the project site during construction, and will be \nminimized  through  established  control  measures  to  be  implemented  by  the  contractors.  It  is \ntherefore  recommended  that  the  project  be  considered  environmentally  and  socially  feasible, \nand  that  the  IEE  be  considered  adequate  to  justify  environmental  and  social  clearance  of  the \nproject. There is no need for further analysis, and the environmental and social assessment of \nthe project is considered complete. \n\nIt is concluded that the project has no further environmental and social issues to follow \n\n26. \nup, and will fully comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n\nI. \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 March 2010) \n", "Currency Unit\nB1.00\n$1.00\nCurrency Unit\n\u00a51.00\n$1.00\nCurrency Unit\nHK$1.00\n$1.00\n", "baht (B) \n \n$0.03 \n \nB34 \n \nyen (\u00a5) \n \n$0.011 \n\u00a588.93 \n \nHong Kong dollar/s (HK$) \n \n$0.13 \n \nHK$7.76 \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsia Pacific Carbon Fund \n", "capital expenditures \n", "Clean Development Mechanism \nClean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \ncertified emission reduction \nChina Light and Power \nChina Light and Power Thailand Renewables \nCarbon Market Initiative \ncarbon dioxide \nDiamond Generating Asia \ndeveloping member country \ndebt service coverage ratio \nEnergy Conservation Promotion (Fund) \nElectricity Generating Authority of Thailand \nElectricity Generating Public Company \nengineering, procurement, and construction \nEnergy Policy and Planning Office \nFuture Carbon Fund \nfinancial internal rate of return \nfinancial transfer \ngrant component of investment \nIndependent power producer \nItalian-Thai Development Public Company \nMetropolitan Electricity Authority \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (USA) \nNatural Energy Development Company \nNational Energy Policy Council \npartial credit guarantee \npower development plan \nProvincial Electricity Authority \npower purchase agreement \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ADB \nAPCF \n", "CAPEX \n", "CDM \nCEFPF \nCER \nCLP \nCLPTR \nCMI \nCO2 \nDGA \nDMC \nDSCR \nECON \nEGAT \nEGCO \nEPC \nEPPO \nFCF \nFIRR \nFt \nGCI \nIPP \nITD \nMEA \nNASA \nNED \nNEPC \nPCG \nPDP \nPEA \nPPA \n", " \n"]}
