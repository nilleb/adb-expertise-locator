Building on international trade theories and good practices \n\nand FTA experience of member countries, the book explains important facts and benchmarks \n\nto be considered when preparing, negotiating, and enforcing FTAs in Asia.\n\nAbout Asian Development Bank\n\nADB\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member \n\ncountries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s \n\nmany successes, it remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s poor. Nearly 1.7 billion people in the region \n\nlive on $2 or less a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \n\nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n\n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \n\nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \n\nand technical assistance. In 2007, it approved $10.1 billion of loans, $673 million of grant projects, and \n\ntechnical assistance amounting to $243 million.\n\nHow to Design, Negotiate, and Implement a\n\nFree Trade Agreement in\n\nASIA\n\nH\n\no\n\nw\n\n \n\nt\n\no\n\n \n\nD\n\ne\n\ns\n\ni\n\ng\n\nn\n\n,\n\n \n\nN\n\ne\n\ng\n\no\n\nt\n\ni\n\na\n\nt\n\ne\n\n,\n\n \n\na\n\nn\n\nd\n\n \n\nI\n\nm\n\np\n\nl\n\ne\n\nm\n\ne\n\nn\n\nt\n\n \n\na\n\n \n\nF\n\nr\n\ne\n\ne\n\n \n\nT\n\nr\n\na\n\nd\n\ne\n\n \n\nA\n\ng\n\nr\n\ne\n\ne\n\nm\n\ne\n\nn\n\nt\n\n \n\ni\n\nn\n\n \n\nA\n\ns\n\ni\n\na\n\nAsian Development Bank\n\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\n\nwww.adb.org\n\nPublication Stock No. BBK-119108\n\nISBN: 978-971-561-684-3\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f \n\n\fHow to Design, Negotiate, and Implement a \nFree Trade Agreement in Asia\n\nOffice of Regional Economic Integration\n\nApril 2008\n\n\f\u00a9 Asian Development Bank \n\nAll rights reserved.

Viewed \npragmatically, against the backdrop of slow progress in \nglobal trade talks, FTAs can promote continued trade \nliberalization, induce structural reforms in the economies \nconcerned, and widen market access across a vibrant \neconomic region, where the demand for greater intra-\nregional trade is rapidly increasing. \n\nOn the negative side, the proliferation of bilateral FTAs \n\ncan create the so-called \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d effect as multiple \nrules of origin arising from overlapping agreements cause \nharm particularly to small and medium enterprises with \nlimited capacity to comply with them. The resulting \nmarket fragmentation would be more costly even for  \nmajor multinational companies because of rising \ntransaction costs and regulatory barriers. The flow of \nforeign direct investment and the associated transfer of \ntechnology and know-how to smaller economies would \nalso decline. \n\nNevertheless, FTAs are a growing reality. If we recognize \n\nthat and hope to foster regional trade agreements as  \nbuilding blocks of global trade and investment integration, \nwe cannot stand idly by and wait for a comprehensive \nglobal resolution. We strongly support the Doha \nnegotiation process, while recognizing the need to \nconsolidate and streamline regional and bilateral FTAs \ninto an eventual Greater Asian FTA. \n\nThe recent proliferation of FTAs in Asia and the Pacific \nis placing mounting strain on the region\u2019s FTA negotiating \ncapacity and on the knowledge and technical skills of \ngovernment officials. The areas of interest now go beyond \nconventional trade in goods and services and extend to \nintellectual property rights, government procurement, and \nlabor and environmental issues, among others. \n\n\fiv\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nThe capacity constraints are especially \nacute in poorer countries, which also lack \nthe institutions to train their officials. \nThis reference book is intended to be \nused mainly in present and planned FTA \ntraining courses of the Asian Development \nBank, to increase the knowledge and \ncapacity of officials who are active in \ndesigning, negotiating, and implementing \nFTAs. Building on theories of international \ntrade economics and the good-practice \nFTA experiences accumulated by both \nfront-runners and late beginners in this \narea, the book explains important facts \nand benchmarks to be considered when \npreparing, negotiating, and enforcing FTAs. \nRather than going into the details of specific \ntopics, this reference book covers the overall \nFTA process and its main features. \n\nWith this reference book, we expect to \nhelp shape common perspectives among \ngovernment officials in Asia and the \nPacific on what a desirable FTA should \nbe, as we look forward to the eventual \nharmonization of FTAs in this region. This \ncomprehensive version is the first step \nin that direction. We hope this reference \nbook will serve the increasing demand for \nFTA knowledge in the region.\n\nJONG-WHA LEE\nHead\nOffice of Regional Economic Integration\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nT he Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI)  \n\nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nconducted training courses in free trade agreements \n\n(FTAs) for mid-level government officials in Asia since \nOctober 2006. Starting with the second program in July \n2007, we expanded participation to all ADB developing \nmember countries to meet the growing demand for FTA \ntraining in the region. Around 100 government officials \nfrom all over Asia participated in the training.\n\nFrom the outset, we felt a need for a reference book on  \n\nFTA for the training course. Drafting a structured text \nmaterial for the courses was the main objective of this \nproject. But this book serves other purposes as well. \nGovernment officials who are or will be involved in \nFTA negotiations can get background knowledge and \nguidelines on practical issues from this reference book. \nThe general public, including the academe and students \nwho are interested in practical aspects of FTA, can also \nbenefit from this. It avoids excessively academic or  \ntechnical terms and is written in language that is \naccessible to everyone with basic, common-sense ideas \nabout economics, international trade, and FTAs. \n\nNegotiating free trade agreements: a guide, prepared by \nthe Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, \nwas the benchmark for this project. Nevertheless, we have  \ntried to cover a wider scope of issues ranging from \nfundamental theories to actual components and practical \nissues related to FTAs.\n\nJong Woo Kang, Economist, OREI, organized this \nproject and coordinated the overall production of the \npublication. Michael Plummer of Johns Hopkins University \nwas overall editor of the project.\n\nA group of international experts, ADB professional \nstaff, and consultants contributed to this reference book. \nMichael Plummer of Johns Hopkins University and \nGaneshan Wignaraja, Jong Woo Kang, and Rosechin \nOlfindo (staff consultant) of ADB wrote Part I: Economics \nof a Free Trade Agreement. \n\n\fvi\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nSeveral academics and experts \n\nFinally, Part III: Negotiating, \n\ncontributed to Part II: Coverage of a Free \nTrade Agreement. Rachel MacCulloch \nof Brandeis University wrote on trade in \ngoods and on environmental and labor \nstandards; William James of ADB, on rules \nof origin; Aik Hoe Lim of Institute for \nInternational Trade, Adelaide University, \non trade in services; Arthur Appleton \nof Appleton Luff Inc., on intellectual \nproperty, dispute settlement mechanisms, \nsanitary and phytosanitary standards, and \ntechnical barriers to trade; Siow Yue Chia \nof the Singapore Institute of International \nAffairs, on investment and FTA-plus issues, \nincluding government procurement and \ncompetition policy; and Dorothea Lazaro, \nADB consultant on trade facilitation.\n\nImplementing, and Evaluating Free Trade \nAgreements was written by Jong Woo \nKang and Dorothea Lazaro of

here to \n\ninclude any formal preferential trading arrangement \nbetween two or more countries, came late to Asia. 1  \n\nBefore the turn of the 21st century, there were few \nregional trading agreements in existence. While successful \nAsian economies by and large exploited the international \nmarketplace effectively, they did so in the context of the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)/World \nTrade Organization (WTO) framework (see Box 1.1 for \nan overview of the evolution of the multilateral system). \nHowever, regionalization, which we will define as a \nmarket-led process of increasing economic interaction, has \nbeen building up momentum in Asia for decades, spurred \nby unilateral liberalization, market-oriented reforms, and \nsuccessful economic growth in Asia consistently above \nthe global average (with the exception of the Asian Crisis \nyears, 1997\u20131998). Hence, formal preferential trading \narrangements in the region, particularly in the form of \nfree trade areas (FTAs), are being developed as a means \nof enhancing regionalism (\u201cthe flag following trade\u201d) \nrather than the other way around, as was true of such \nagreements as colonial preferences or even the early \nyears of European economic integration. In most of Asia, \nregionalism is being used as part of the overall process of  \neconomic reform, to buttress the outward-oriented \ndevelopment strategies of the region\u2019s economies.\n\n1

After all, FTAs all have \ndiscriminatory features and, therefore, \nare \u201csecond best.\u201d There are in fact no \nguarantees that a \u201cfree trade area\u201d will be \na movement in the direction of free trade, \nits name notwithstanding. It depends very \nmuch on the agreement. We will argue in \nthis book that the current FTA movement \nin Asia is outward-oriented, and that the  \nintentions of economies engaged in \nthese agreements are pro-market and \nconsistent with multilateral rules. \nHowever, to be certain that regionalism \nwill support efficient regionalization and \ncompetitiveness, policy makers must \nunderstand the complicated nature of \nthese agreements and learn to embrace \nthe positive elements while minimizing \nthe potentially negative ones. Part I was \nwritten with this in mind.\n\nrise of free Trade agreemenTs  \nin asia and The Pacific\n\nThe rapid spread of regionalism has \nbecome one of the most important \nrecent developments in the global trade \nsystem. The proliferation of bilateral and \nplurilateral FTAs is fundamentally altering \nthe world trade landscape. Trade between \nFTA partners now makes up nearly 40% \nof global trade, and new agreements \nincreasingly address issues beyond trade. 2 \nAsia is a latecomer in the move toward \nFTAs compared with Europe, the Americas, \nand Africa, but has seen an unprecedented \nincrease in total FTA activity since the \n1990s. By Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nestimates, at least one Asian country 3 is \n\n2  World Bank (2005). However, the amount of trade \n\nthat is actually preferential is smaller because of the \ncosts of compliance with free trade agreements (FTAs), \nparticularly those associated with the rules-of-origin \nrequirement.\n\n3  Asia in the ADB FTA database refers to Asia and the \n\nPacific.\n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\n\ninvolved in 204 FTAs in various stages \nof implementation: 95 concluded, 60 \nunder official negotiation, and 49 being \nproposed (see Box 1.2 for information on \nADB\u2019s FTA Database, which gives up-to-\ndate information and analysis regarding \nemerging and existing FTAs). This is a \ndramatic increase from the fewer than 10 \nFTAs involving Asian countries in the early \n1990s (see Figure 1.1). \n\nThe rise in the number of FTA \n\ninitiatives in Asia is driven by a number \nof factors including: (i) a defensive \nresponse to the proliferation of trading \nblocs and FTAs in other major regions; \n(ii) uncertainty over progress in global \ntrade talks under the WTO framework; \n(iii) the need to improve productivity in \nthe face of the heightened competitive \npressure from the economic emergence of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and \nIndia, in particular with respect to  \neconomies of scale through market \nintegration; (iv) the perceived need for \ndeeper integration with trading partners, \ndue in part to the demonstration effect \nof successful regional integration accords \nelsewhere; and (v) the promotion of \n\u201cbeyond the border\u201d structural reforms as \npart of a competitiveness strategy (e.g., \n\ninvestment liberalization, promotion of \ndomestic competition, harmonization of \nstandards, and upgrading of technology \ndevelopment). The recent increase in \nFTAs has also been driven by the richest \nand largest economies in the region such \nas the PRC, Japan, Republic of Korea, \nSingapore, and, Thailand, suggesting a \nlink between FTA growth and economic \nprosperity, although the exact causation \nstill needs to be explored further.\n\nbox\u20021.2:\u2002 ADB\u2019s Free Trade Agreement Database\n\nlaunched\u2002in\u2002october\u20022006\u2002by\u2002adb\u2002and\u2002managed\u2002by\u2002\nits\u2002office\u2002of\u2002regional\u2002economic\u2002integration,\u2002the\u2002free\u2002\nTrade\u2002agreement\u2002(fTa)\u2002database\u2002in\u2002the\u2002asia\u2002regional\u2002\ninformation\u2002Center\u2002(ariC)\u2002website\u2002(www.aric.adb.org)\u2002\ntracks\u2002fTas\u2002of\u200247\u2002regional\u2002members\u2002of\u2002adb\u2002and\u2002provides\u2002\nthree\u2002types\u2002of\u2002information:\u2002(i)\u2002fTa\u2002trends\u2002(statistical\u2002tables\u2002\non\u2002the\u2002status\u2002and\u2002various\u2002categories\u2002of\u2002fTas\u2002in\u2002asia\u2002and\u2002\nthe\u2002pacific);\u2002(ii)\u2002available\u2002resources\u2002on\u2002each\u2002fTa\u2002(i.e.,\u2002legal\u2002\ndocuments,\u2002official\u2002summary,\u2002studies\u2002and\u2002researches,\u2002\nnews,\u2002opinions\u2002and\u2002editorials,\u2002fTa\u2002membership,\u2002and\u2002\nan\u2002external\u2002link\u2002to\u2002the\u2002unesCap\u2002database);\u2002and\u2002(iii)\u2002\na\u2002comparative\u2002fTa\u2002toolkit\u2014an\u2002innovative\u2002feature\u2002\nof\u2002the\u2002fTa\u2002database\u2014which\u2002allows\u2002side-by-side\u2002\ncomparison\u2002of\u2002around\u200280\u2002chapters/provisions\u2002of\u2002more\u2002\nthan\u200240\u2002concluded\u2002\u2002fTas.\u2002The\u2002list\u2002of\u2002fTas\u2002on\u2002the\u2002ariC\u2002\nwebsite\u2002is\u2002based\u2002on\u2002official\u2002sources\u2002(joint\u2002statements,\u2002\ndeclarations,\u2002press\u2002releases,\u2002and\u2002government\u2002websites).\u2002\nThe\u2002information\u2002about\u2002them\u2002is\u2002also\u2002from\u2002official\u2002sources,\u2002\nresearch\u2002sites,\u2002and\u2002online\u2002news\u2002items.\u2002\n\nsource:\u2002adb.\n\nfigure\u20021.1:\u2002 Number of Free Trade Agreements \n\nInvolving Asia and the Pacific Countries, \n1990\u2013\u0018007\n\nfigure\u20021.2:\u2002 Number of Free Trade Agreements \nInvolving Asia and the Pacific  \nSubregions, \u0018007\n\nProposed\n\nUnder Negotiation\n\nConcluded\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1990\n\n1997\n\n2000\n\n2007\n\nEast Asia\n\nCentral Asia\n\nSouth Asia\n\nPacific\n\nsource:\u2002adb\u2002fTa\u2002database.\u2002available:\u2002www.aric.adb.org\n\nsource:\u2002adb\u2002fTa\u2002database.\u2002available:\u2002www.aric.adb.org\n\n\f\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nAmong the Asian subregions, East Asia 4 \nis the most active in forming FTAs: at least \none East Asian economy is involved in \nany of 112 FTAs, almost twice the number \nof FTAs involving Central or South Asian \ncountries (see Figure 1.2). 5 The Pacific is \nthe least involved in FTA formation among \nthe four Asian subregions. Given the rise \nin the market-based regionalization of \nEast Asian economies over the past 20 \nyears, that is, the increase in the regional \nshares of trade and investment due to \nmarket-driven activity, the deepening of  \nregional economic interdependence is the \nmost fundamental rationale behind the \nrecent economic regionalism in East  \nAsia\u2014an example of the \u201cflag following \ntrade.\u201d Since the Asian Crisis of \n1997\u20131998, East Asian economies have \nembarked on various initiatives under the \ngeneral rubric of economic regionalism \nin trade/investment and money/finance. \nThe crisis prompted the subregion\u2019s \neconomies to realize the importance of \neconomic cooperation and to make efforts \nto institutionalize such interdependence. 6\nAn important feature of the rise in the \n\nnumber of FTAs in Asia is the growing \nnumber of overlapping agreements and \nthe so-called Asian \u201cnoodle bowl,\u201d 7 that \nhas emerged from the proliferation of \nbilateral and plurilateral FTAs in the \nregion. Each FTA can be quite different \nin coverage, depth of liberalization, and \nthe specific regulations that make the \naccord function (e.g., rules of origin). \nAccording to ADB estimates, Asian \ncountries are involved in 156 bilateral \nand 48 plurilateral FTAs in various \nstages of implementation. Many of these \nagreements\u2014especially the new ones, \n\n4  Unless specified otherwise, \u201cEast Asia\u201d in this reference \nbook refers to the 10 Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) countries plus the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC); Hong Kong, China; the Republic of \nKorea; Mongolia; Taipei,China; and Japan.\n\n5  See Kawai and Wignaraja (2007).\n6  See Kawai (2005).\n7  The terms \u201cnoodle bowl\u201d and \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d are \n\nare with countries outside the region \n(see Table 1.1). The fact that many FTAs \nextend beyond the Asian region itself \nunderscores the importance of external \nmarkets particularly for the export of \nfinal products. The formation of cross-\nregional agreements is driven by several \nfactors including energy security, access to \nminerals and other natural resources, and \nefforts by countries to \u201clock in\u201d reforms \nby making them part of a formal trade \ntreaty with a major developed country or \nregion. 8\n\nTable\u20021.1:\u2002 Types of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) \nInvolving Asia and the Pacific  \nCountries, \u0018007\n\nRegional \nCoverage\n\nBilateral  \nFTAs\n\nPlurilateral \nFTAs\n\nTotal  \nFTAs\n\nwithin\u2002asia-pacific\n\noutside\u2002asia-pacific\n\n\u2002 Total\u2002fTas\n\n73\n\n83\n\n156\n\n25\n\n23\n\n48\n\n98\n\n106\n\n204\n\nsource:\u2002adb\u2002fTa\u2002database.\u2002available:\u2002www.aric.adb.org\n\nAround half of the established FTAs \ninvolving at least one Asian country have \nnot been notified to the WTO. A large \nportion of the WTO-notified FTAs involve \nEast Asian economies, indicating significant \nadherence in East Asia to WTO rules and \nprocedures for FTAs. However, many of the \nprovisions of recent agreements formed \nby East Asian economies extend beyond \nthe WTO regulatory framework (\u201cWTO-\nplus agreements\u201d) to include provisions \nrelated to a host of \u201cdeep\u201d issues such as \ntrade facilitation, investment, government \nprocurement, competition, intellectual \nproperty, and environment and labor rules. \nSuch provisions are

raised concern in the \nlight of its potential to add greatly to the \ncomplexity of international trade and to \nthe administrative costs of trade. The web \nof differing trade arrangements can tangle \nadministrative procedures\u2014e.g., customs \nprocedures, technical standards, rules of \norigin\u2014and thereby raise the cost for both \nenterprises and governments. To mitigate \nsuch adverse effects, some have called \nfor the creation of a region-wide FTA \nwith harmonized rules of origin among \nother business-friendly provisions. In this \nregard, the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) could form a natural \nhub for East Asia and for Asia in general. 9\nGiven their complicated and inherently \n\ndiscriminatory nature, many of these \nsubregional and regional initiatives would \nbe more efficiently handled at the global \nlevel. After all, Article XXIV of the GATT/\nWTO was intended to be an exception \nto the MFN rule (see Box 1.3). But what \nhappens when the exception becomes the \nrule? We address this and related issues in \nthe rest of this section.\n\nWhy enTer inTo a free Trade \nagreemenT?\u2014PoliTical  \nand economic goals\n\nAs noted above, the major surge in \nFTAs is fundamentally changing the \ninternational commercial landscape, with \nAsian economies being an important \npart of this process. This trend did not \ndevelop by accident. In this section, we \nconsider some of the general economic \nand political goals behind the formation \nof FTAs.\n\nTo begin with, we should stress that, \nwhile economics may be an important \nmotivation in setting up an FTA, political \n\n9  See Kuroda (2007).\n\ncircumstances generally dominate. In fact, \nwhile one can list a number of accords \nwith a dubious economic rationale but \nstrong political motivations, no major \naccord made good economic sense but \nwas politically untenable. Hence, while \nthis book emphasizes the economics \nof regional trading arrangements, the \nimportant political dimensions of each \nagreement should also be respected. \n\ngains from Trade\n\nThe \u201cgains from trade\u201d argument, \nfirst developed by the famous British \neconomist David Riccardo, has been \nused to promote the need for trade \nliberalization over the past two centuries. \nIn short, as a country specializes in the \nproducts that it produces most efficiently, \ncompared with other countries, and then \ntrades the goods in surplus, it is able to \nimprove its standard of living. On the \nsupply side, efficient structural adjustment \ntakes place: the country uses its resources \nin the most productive way. On the \ndemand side, firms are able to source the \nmost cost-effective inputs and consumers \nare able to purchase imports at the lowest \nprice. When all countries specialize in \ntheir \u201ccomparative advantage\u201d products, \nthe entire world is better off and global \nprosperity is maximized. \n\nAs Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson \nhas noted, the principle of comparative \nadvantage might be the only proposition \nin the social sciences that is both true and \nnontrivial. It is also counterintuitive to \nmany. For example, in the debates over \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement \n(NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and \nthe United States (US), opponents of the \nagreement in Mexico argued that there \nwas no way Mexico could compete with \na technological superpower like the US, \nand in the US those that opposed NAFTA \ninsisted that the US could not compete \nwith Mexicans, whose wages were only \n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  7\n\na fraction of those at home. Riccardo \ndemonstrated more than a century earlier \nthat both were wrong. With free trade, \nthe US and Mexico would produce the \nproducts in which they had inherent \ncomparative advantage, and both would \nbenefit. In a hospital, a medical doctor \ncan perform all the roles of a nurse and \nmuch more specialized tasks. But there \nstill is a role for the nurse, who can \nspecialize in more routine, less specialized \nactivities, leaving the doctor to specialize \nin more advanced tasks. In accepting this \ndivision of labor, each will prosper and \nthe hospital will be more efficient. \n\nThis does not mean that the doctor \nand the nurse will be paid equally. The \nformer will be more productive in the \narea requiring a high degree of expertise \nthan the latter and, hence, will receive \na higher salary. Likewise, countries with \nhigher productivity will have a higher \nstandard of living than lower-productivity \ncountries. In addition, under a regime of \nfree trade, countries do not decide what \nthey will produce. Economics, rather than \npolitics, dictates comparative advantage. \nBut as the Hungarian economist Bela \nBalassa has noted, comparative advantage \nis man-made; policy matters. Japan, for \ninstance, began after World War II as \none of the world\u2019s most labor-abundant \ncountries, and exported low-cost, labor-\nintensive products for decades. But its \nevolution over time, driven by forward-\nlooking government policy, allowed it to  \nshift its comparative advantage into \nhigh-tech, capital-intensive exports. Many \nother Asian countries are also moving up \nthe development ladder.\n\nFurther, as economies evolve over \ntime from low-skilled production, of \nagricultural and labor-intensive goods \nfor example, into more sophisticated \nproducts, their comparative advantage \ntends to merge. Economic integration \nchanges from inter-industry trade \n(say, oil for computer chips) to intra-\n\nindustry trade (say, automobiles for \nautomobiles). Recent trends in East Asia \nunderscore this process. At first, trade \nwas inter-industry\u2014and, hence, there \nwas not much of it. But particularly \nsince the Asian Crisis, East Asian \ncountries have been engaging much \nmore in intra-industry trade, a process \nthat is responsible in part for the rising \nintra-regional trade share and greater \neconomic symmetry (Rana 2006). In \nfact, most of the world\u2019s trade takes place \nbetween developed countries (with the \nsame economic characteristics) and is of \nthe intra-industry variety.\n\nThis leads us to the distinction between \n\u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d specializations \nin production. Horizontal specialization \nrelates to production according to \ncomparative advantage in the traditional \nsense discussed above; vertical \nspecialization focuses on the many parts  \nand processes that make up the \nproduction of a final good, i.e., the \u201cvalue \nchain.\u201d While efficient division of labor \nwill always dictate specialization in what \nthe country does best relative to other \ncountries in the global trading system, \nmultinational corporations (MNCs) have \ntransformed radically how they organize \nproductive processes and source inputs. \nFor example, while in the 1950s and \n1960s an MNC might have produced an  \nentire automobile in the Philippines for  \nsale in the local and international \nmarkets, today that same MNC would \nhave operations in the Philippines that \nwould be part of a global production \nprocess, in which the MNC would exploit \nthe comparative advantages of each \ncountry in its network to produce the \nautomobile most efficiently. This value \nchain would see labor-abundant countries \nproducing labor-intensive components, \ncapital-intensive countries producing \ncapital-intensive components, high-skill-\nintensive countries producing high-skill-\nintensive components, and so on. The \n\n\f\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nproduction of automobiles and electronics \nis increasingly characterized by this sort \nof value-chain process in the modern \neconomy. The rising importance\u2014and, \noften, dominance\u2014of electronics in the \nexports of most East Asian economies \ntestifies to the importance of the vertical \ndivision of labor that is being created \nby these value chains, a process that \nin turn is driving economic integration \nand globalization more generally. It is \nstill driven by comparative advantage; \nhowever, in addition to having \ncomparative advantage in particular \nproducts, economies have comparative \nadvantages in processes and components \nthat are part of a vertical division  \nof production. \n\nFurther, this process allows developing \n\ncountries to tap more easily into global \nproduction chains. In the past, the \nproduction of an entire automobile in \nthe Philippines would have required a \ndemanding set of national economic \nprerequisites such as available inputs \nand skill sets that could have been \ndiscouraging to the MNC. Perhaps the \nPhilippines would have been bypassed \nin favor of a more developed country \nwith these attributes already in place. \nHowever, within the context of the \nvertical division of labor discussed \nabove, the Philippines would only have \nto have comparative advantage in a \nsubset of these skills to participate in the \nproduction chain. Hence, these value \nchains hold important advantages for \nless-developed countries, which can now \ntap into globalization far earlier than in \nthe past.\n\nIn sum, the \u201cgains from trade\u201d \nargument, based on the principle of \ncomparative advantage, explains the \ninherent logic of international free trade \nas the \u201cfirst best\u201d policy option, i.e., one \nthat should lead to greater welfare for all \ncountries. Comparative advantage is also \na dynamic process, suggesting that, while \n\ntrade increases efficiency and prosperity, \ngovernment policy at the national level \nplays a key role in determining to what \ndegree each will be successful. \n\nBut what is the difference between \nfree trade and FTAs? Unlike multilateral \nliberalization under the GATT/WTO, FTAs \ntend to be controversial in economic and \npolicy circles for a variety of reasons, \nmost of which are linked to the fact that \npreferential trading arrangements, such \nas FTAs and customs unions, are by their \nvery nature discriminatory. We explain \nthe economics of FTAs in the rest of this \nsection, and focus on political-economy-\nrelated issues in the next section.\n\nStatic effects\n\nThe \u201cstatic effects\u201d of FTAs generally \nrefer to the effect on price changes \ninduced by preferential tariff (and \nnontariff) liberalization. Free trade \nareas remove discrimination between \npartner countries and domestic firms, \nand, hence, home and country prices of \ntradable goods\u2014that is, exports, imports, \nand import-competing products\u2014tend \nto be equalized as barriers to trade are \nreduced. Relatively inefficient domestic \nproduction therefore contracts (\u201ctrade \ncreation\u201d) in favor of production in \npartner countries. This is essentially the \nsame efficiency-enhancing effect as in \nRiccardo\u2019s model. However, FTAs create \na new form of discrimination, that is, \nbetween the exports of partner and non-\npartner countries. Partner-country exports \nwill displace more efficient non-partner \nexports in the home market if the degree \nof preferential access is sufficient (\u201ctrade \ndiversion\u201d). Trade diversion implies a less \nefficient international division of labor, \nand, since the home country will lose \ntariff revenues and will pay a higher price \nfor its imports, the importing country \nloses. Thus, the net (static) effects of an \nFTA will depend on the degree of trade \n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  9\n\ncreation compared with trade diversion \n(\u201callocative efficiency\u201d). Note that trade \nliberalization under the WTO should \nnot involve any trade diversion, as MFN \ntreatment implies nondiscrimination \nbetween sources of imports. This is why \nit is \u201cfirst best\u201d option. On the other \nhand, since FTAs discriminate in favor \nof partner countries, regionalism is the \n\u201csecond best\u201d and, therefore, does not \nguarantee a more efficient division of \nlabor in the grouping.\n\nIn comparing the economics of \n\nnondiscriminatory trade liberalization, \nsuch as that taking place under the \nauspices of the WTO on the basis of MFN  \ntreatment, on the one hand, and \ndiscriminatory trade liberalization in the  \ncontext of an FTA, on the other, we \nshould keep in mind the qualitative \ndifferences between accords. First of all, \nwhile trade diversion does exist in the \ncontext of an FTA, it is also true that FTAs \ntend to be more comprehensive in the \ncoverage of goods (and services). In fact, \nArticle XXIV of the GATT/WTO, which \ndictates minimal requirements for FTAs, \ninsists on the coverage of substantially \nall goods. But no such requirement exists \nunder the GATT/WTO. Countries include \nas many sectors as they deem fit through \nnegotiations. This has led to a good deal \nof piecemeal liberalization under the \nGATT/WTO, leaving protection on some \nagricultural and labor-intensive products \npractically untouched after successive \nmultilateral rounds. The exclusion of \nindividual products can be problematic \non efficiency grounds, particularly when \nit involves products that are used as \ninputs in the productive network. For \nexample, duty-free inputs on steel will \ncause exaggerated protection of value \nadded (the \u201ceffective rate of protection\u201d) \nin the automotive sector. The exclusion \nof tariffs on imported lumber will do the \nsame in the furniture industry if the latter \nis excluded from liberalization. Free trade \n\nareas, on the other hand, are generally \nfar more comprehensive in the treatment \nof sectors across the board. Thus, while \nFTAs lead to potential trade diversion \nbecause of discrimination between \ncountries, the existing multilateral regime \nsuffers from negative efficiency effects \nbecause of discrimination between \nproducts. \n\nSecond, regionalism holds another \nadvantage over multilateralism in that it \nallows like-minded countries to address \nfar more issues and in a shorter period of \ntime. By choosing one or several  partners \nwith similar policy goals, countries are \nable to make more progress in deep \nintegration than they could in the  \nextremely diverse WTO context. The \nrecent interest in regionalism on the part \nof OECD countries that have traditionally \nshunned it (the US, Japan, the Republic \nof Korea, Australia and New Zealand, \nand so on) derives from their desire to \naddress these many issues and their \nunderstanding that they cannot resolve \nthem in the context of the WTO, or at \nleast not in the short or medium run. \nA successful conclusion to the Doha \nDevelopment Agenda would, perhaps, \ngive momentum to regionalism, but this \nis not certain. The incentives for entering \ninto new bilateral and plurilateral \naccords, as well as for deepening existing \nones, would remain.\n\nDynamic effects\n\nEconomists tend to focus on the static \neffects of economic integration. Price \nchanges in FTAs drive the theoretical \nand empirical FTA literature mainly \nbecause they are easier to conceptualize \nand estimate than other effects of \nregionalism (see Box 1.4). However, \nthe static effects of FTAs tend to be less \nimportant from the point of view of sheer \neconomic impact and the implications of \nregionalism for economic development. \n\n\f10\u2002

On the other hand, \u201cdynamic \neffects\u201d refer to the medium- and long-\nterm implications of regional integration \nand, as such, tend to be more significant. \nDynamic effects are also more pervasive, \naffecting almost all areas that relate to \nan economy\u2019s competitiveness. From \narticulated policy statements and the \n\ndirection of FTA formation in Asia, we \nfind that the economic policy goals of  \nFTAs in the region focus on these \ndynamic effects, rather than mere price \nchanges. Below, we consider some of the \nmost important dynamic effects in the \ncontext of FTAs\u2014economies of scale, \ntechnology transfer and foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI), and structural policy \nchange and reform. \n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  11\n\nEconomies of Scale.  If a firm\u2019s average \ncosts fall when its output expands, it will  \nbe able to sell at more competitive \nprices as its market grows. This type \nof production function would be \ncharacterized by \u201ceconomies of scale,\u201d of \nwhich the degree depends on the product \ntype. Economies of scale exist in the \nproduction of many agricultural, natural-\nresource-intensive, and manufacturing \nsectors, as well as services. This effect is  \nintuitive to both business people and \nconsumers, who are used to paying less \nfor larger purchases. \n\nThe importance of economies of scale \n\nin the context of FTAs is also intuitive. \nBy creating a larger market for firms \noperating in partner countries, an FTA will \nallow producers to take advantage of a \nlarger customer base and, hence, produce \nat a lower average cost on all sales. Firms \nwill even be able to lower prices for \nexisting customers\u2014the \u201ccost-reduction \neffect\u201d (Corden 1972). As a result, they \nwill become more competitive not only at \nhome but also in foreign markets.\n\nIt is clear that exploiting economies \nof scale is an important motivation for \nregional integration. Resource pooling \nand market sharing have been explicit \ngoals of ASEAN essentially since its \nfoundation. ASEAN has deepened \neconomic integration considerably over \ntime and is now creating an ASEAN \nEconomic Community, in part to compete \nwith the PRC and Indian markets, which \notherwise would have an important \ncompetitive advantage in economic \nscale. Deep integration in the European \nUnion (EU) has been pushed by the need \nto compete with the US for the same \nreasons.\n\nTechnology Transfer and Foreign Direct \nInvestment.  The link between FDI and \ntechnology transfer has been firmly \nestablished. It is one of the primary \nreasons why Asian countries seek to \n\nattract FDI inflows, through unilateral \nand concerted trade liberalization and \nother means. Bilateral and regional FTA \nformation attracts such long-term, risk-\nsharing investment flows by creating \na more integrated marketplace within \nwhich MNCs can enjoy a regional \ndivision of labor with low transaction \ncosts and exploit product-level economies \nof scale. \n\nGreater FDI flows can have important \n\nsalutary effects on the economy by \nbringing in long-term foreign capital \nand foreign exchange, providing ready-\nmade international customers through \nthe foreign firms\u2019 global networks, \nstimulating local competition, and \nputting pressure on government bodies \nto embrace \u201cbest practices\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis \ninvestment measures and regulations. \nBut perhaps the most important benefit \nfrom FDI, at least for developing Asia, is \ntechnology transfer.\n\nThe investment effect on trade creation  \n\nand trade diversion is also worth noting. \nAn MNC that believes an FTA between \nIndia and ASEAN will lead to greater \neconomic dynamism in Asia will be \ncompelled to invest more in India. \nSince the resulting investments would \nbe consistent with India\u2019s dynamic \ncomparative advantage, this is known as  \n\u201cinvestment creation,\u201d i.e., India (and \nthe rest of the world) experiences a more \nefficient distribution of global investment. \nHowever, suppose that the MNC decides \nto invest in India not because of a \nperceived increase in dynamism in that \ncountry but because it will now have \npreferential access to the ASEAN market. \nIn other words, although investing in, say, \nBangladesh might have been more cost-\neffective, the MNC diverts investment to  \nIndia because of this regional accord. The \nmotivation would be the same as in  \n\u201ctariff hopping\u201d FDI. This effect is known \nas \u201cinvestment diversion.\u201d India may be \npleased that it can draw in more FDI, \n\n\f1\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nbut Bangladesh will certainly suffer. \nMoreover, the investment in India could \nvery well go into sectors in which India \nis not internationally competitive but \nmerely competitive relative to ASEAN, \nproducing negative efficiency effects even \nthere.\n\nWhile conceptually clear, investment \n\ncreation and diversion is difficult to \nestimate. We observe a change in FDI \nflows empirically but are unable to \ntrace directly the motivation for the \ninvestment\u2014MNCs obviously do not \nannounce their management strategies. \nHowever, we would expect investment \ncreation to follow trade creation, and \ninvestment diversion to follow trade \ndiversion. To demonstrate this, let us \nreturn to our India-ASEAN example and, \nfurther, let us focus on electronics. If \ntariffs on electronic products in ASEAN \nwere equal to zero\u2014they are indeed very \nlow in the main ASEAN markets\u2014there \nwould be no incentive for investment \ndiversion, as the MNC even with its \nnewly gained preferential access would \nhave no real benefit from investing in \nIndia; all countries would have tariff-free \naccess. Hence, if it still speeded up its \ninvestments in India, we would attribute \nthis to investment creation. On the other \nhand, if the electronics markets in ASEAN \nwere highly protected, the potential for \ninvestment diversion would be great, \nas would be the potential for trade \ndiversion. \n\nUsing an FTA to attract FDI from third \ncountries, as well as partner countries, is \noften a key motivation for such an accord. \nThis is certainly the case in ASEAN, \nwhose free trade agreement (the AFTA) \nis thought of more as an investment \nagreement than as a trade agreement. \nIn other words, the goal of AFTA is \nto reduce transaction costs to MNCs \nwishing to use ASEAN as an integrated \nproduction platform to exploit vertical \ndivision of labor. Note, however, that the \n\ngoal of ASEAN (and other economies in \nAsia) is mainly to bring in third-country \nMNCs, that is, to attract greater FDI \ninflows from OECD countries. Developed \ncountries are by far the most important \nglobal investors. In 1995\u20132005, intra-\nASEAN FDI was only 14% of total FDI \ninflows, and almost half of that share was \nSingaporean investment in Thailand and \nMalaysia alone. Thus, it makes sense for \nFTAs to focus on non-partner countries as \nwell as partner countries. Multinational \ncorporations in developed countries also \nhave the advantage of having the most \nsophisticated technologies, and their \nglobal reach can pave the way to ready-\nmade export markets. \n\nIn fact, ASEAN has always placed \nemphasis, implicit or otherwise, on \nattracting non-partner FDI. The ASEAN \nInvestment Area (AIA), which was \nfounded in 1998 and will be an important \npillar in building the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity, explicitly charts a path for \nthe national treatment of partner- and \nnon-partner country investors, albeit \nwithin different time frames\u20142010 for \ninvestors from partner countries and 2020 \nfor those from non-partners.\n\nStructural Policy Change and \nReform in \u201cNew Age\u201d Free Trade \nAgreements.  Modern FTAs, particularly \nthose with OECD countries as partners, \ngo well behind the traditional focus \non tariffs to include other border and \nbehind-the-border measures. These \nmeasures now receive far greater \nattention in negotiations and tend to be \nmore important to the modernization and \ncompetitiveness of economic systems, \nin part because of the success of the \nGATT/WTO in bringing down tariffs and \nrendering them less significant. Examples \nof these behind-the-border areas are: \ncomplex measures specific to the service \nsectors; laws related to corporate \nand public governance; the national \n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  1\u0018\n\ntreatment of partner-country investors; \ncompetition policy, including the reform \nof state-owned enterprises; and other \n\u201csensitive sectors\u201d with important \nlinks to the rest of the economy. The \ninclusion of these nontraditional areas \nunderscores how far FTAs have gone \nbeyond mere commercial policy to \ninclude microeconomic policies that used \nto be considered the exclusive domain of \nnational economic policy.\n\nPolicy harmonization issues are \nespecially pertinent in this regard. \nAlthough the most significant effects of \nthe Single Market program of the EU are \nheld to be in many of the behind-the-\nborder areas mentioned above, perhaps \none of the most important areas of \ncooperation can be classified under the \nrubric of \u201charmonization issues,\u201d such \nas mutual recognition of product testing \nand professional certification, standards \nconformance, and customs and transit. \nAdopting universal harmonization \nstandards would maximize gains in all \nof these areas. Doing so worldwide is, \nhowever, much more difficult, and that \nis why the GATT/WTO has made such \nlittle progress in these areas. On the other \nhand, like-minded countries in an FTA are \nable to address these nontraditional areas \nthat improve the business environment by \nreducing costs, leveling the playing field \nfor foreign investors, and pushing policy \nreforms toward best practices.\n\nOne final point pertains to the limits \n\nof harmonization. In many ways, \n\u201charmonization\u201d implies creating a level \nplaying field. However, the playing \nfield must be in good shape, that is, the \nregion should adopt not only compatible \npolicies (harmonization) but also best \npractices. Otherwise, harmonization \nmay only reduce diversity in a region \nwhile doing little to improve the business \nenvironment, which, after all, should be \nthe overriding goal.\n\nCompetitiveness Incentives.  As is the case \nwith trade liberalization generally, greater \nexposure to international competition \nhas important salutary effects on a \npartner country in an FTA. Increased \nexposure to competition from partner-\ncountry producers not only leads to trade \ncreation, and, therefore, greater structural \nefficiency, but also increases the potential \nprofits for competitive, or potentially \ncompetitive, firms. An important incentive \nto invest in more efficient productive \nprocesses and technology is thus created. \nIn other words, the FTA enables the firms \nto adapt new technologies from abroad \nby increasing the potential for success in \nusing those technologies to break into \npartner-country markets.\n\nPolitical economy of Protection\n\nThe areas covered by regional trading \narrangements constitute a subset\u2014though \nan increasingly large one, as mentioned \nabove\u2014of overall macroeconomic and \nmicroeconomic policies. Moreover, all \nexisting and emerging trade accords \nin Asia are FTAs, rather than customs \nunions, meaning that the economic \npolicies of member countries continue to \nbe independent. 10 Thus, the question of \nhow FTAs will affect the policy stance of \nacceding countries will be crucial to the \nultimate success of the accord. For example, \nin the NAFTA debates discussed above, \nalmost all American economists supported \nthe agreement not out of any conviction \nthat regionalism was the best way to go\u2014a \nmajority saw regionalism as a threat to \nthe integrity of the multilateral system, in \nwhich they strongly believed\u2014but rather \nbecause they felt it was the best way to \nlock in the progressive economy-wide \nreforms that Mexico had set in motion \n\n10  The one exception might be the ASEAN Economic \n\nCommunity initiative, which may ultimately have to \ncreate a customs union to reach its goal of a common \nmarket.\n\n\f1\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nin the process leading up to NAFTA. In \naddition, accession to ASEAN has facilitated \neconomic reform in the transitional ASEAN \neconomies that joined in the 1990s, well \nbeyond what was needed to meet the \nexigencies of ASEAN-based agreements. In \nthis section, we consider some aspects of \nthe complicated interaction between FTAs \nand policy-making.\n\nDynamic policy considerations\n\nA government can try to protect its \ndomestic market from foreign competition \nby levying tariffs on imported goods or \nerecting nontariff barriers such as quotas \nof various kinds, discriminatory sanitary \nrequirements, or even administrative \naction (e.g., antidumping and \ncountervailing duties ). 11 While tariffs, \nalong with internal tax sources such as \nincome, corporate, and value-added \ntaxes, generate tax revenue for importing \ncountries, such a tax at the border \ncan itself be used as a policy variable \nto influence the economy\u2019s industrial \nstructure. Hence, tariff formation can be, \nand usually is, affected by various factors \nother than tax revenue maximization. \nAfter all, if revenue maximization were \nindeed the goal of a tariff regime, the \ncountry should favor an across-the-\nboard tariff that does not discriminate \nacross commodities when setting up \nits commercial policy regime. Such an \napproach would imply far less efficiency \ncosts than a tariff structure that differs \nacross commodities. 12 The fact that \nhomogeneous tariffs are rarely in evidence \nimplies that countries tend to use their \ntariff structure as a form of industrial \n\n11  This does not mean that all sanitary requirements and \nadministrative actions are protectionist. However, they \nhave been used as \u201chidden\u201d protectionist vehicles.\n12  The argument for an optimum tariff rate suggests that \ntariff rates should be set according to relative elasticity \nbetween the demand for and supply of the imported \ngood to maximize terms-of-trade gains. Given the \ncompliance costs and potential rent-seeking behavior, \nhowever, a uniform tariff can have great advantages \nover a complex one.\n\npolicy. This aspect of endogenous tariff \nformation has been explored through \npolitical, rather than purely economic, \nmodels. In general, this approach focuses \non the domestic government\u2019s political \nobjective of maximizing national welfare \nas determined from its own point of \nview, rather than from the economy\u2019s \nperspective. In line with this, the \ngovernment\u2019s objective function consists of \nthree major variables, i.e., domestic firms\u2019 \nprofit, aggregate consumer surplus, and \ntariff revenue, which can be represented \nin the simple objective welfare function \nW(\u03c0L ,C, \u03c4). It should be noted that this \n\u201cnational welfare\u201d function differs from \nwhat a neoclassical economy connotes.\nIn the political-support approach to \ntrade-barrier formation, the government \ntrades off political backing from \nconsumers against higher industry profits \nbecause higher protection for domestic \nindustry will inevitably lead to higher \nsale prices of goods (and, hence, will be \nopposed by consumers). If the government \ngives greater weight to consumers\u2019 surplus \nthan to the domestic firms\u2019 profit, the \neffective tariff rate will be lower, and vice \nversa. The local firms will lobby their \ngovernment for higher protection for their \nindustries. If the tariff revenue collected is \nto be redistributed among domestic actors, \nan altruistic government would choose a \ntariff to maximize aggregate support from \nits constituents. The altruistic government \nendeavors to maximize social welfare \nunder the political incentive to gain public \nconfidence in order to win elections or \ncarry favors from various constituents.\nThese policy considerations of the \n\nimporting country government, in \nturn, have strategic implications for the \nexporting sector. Faced with the importing \ngovernment\u2019s welfare maximization \nproblem, exporting firms behave \nstrategically to maximize profit under \ngiven constraints. An exporting firm not \nonly competes against the local firms in \nthe market of the host country, but also \n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  1\u0018\n\nengages in strategic behavior in responding \nto trade barriers in the country to which \nthe firm will be exporting (i.e., the \ndestination country). This dynamic aspect \nof strategic behavior is most evident in \nfirms\u2019 comportment under administrative \nprotection regimes of the importing \ncountry. Even in the context of rapid \nglobalization and with many FTAs that \nhave emerged as important policy vehicles, \nadministrative protection measures, \nsuch as antidumping and countervailing \nduties, have become the most important \ntrade barriers in industrialized (and some \ndeveloping) countries. The rationale and \neffects of these protective measures, as well \nas exporting firms\u2019 strategic behavior in \nfacing the domestic government\u2019s threat of \nprotection, must be explored in a political \neconomy context. Although it is not yet \nproven whether this kind of strategic \ninteraction exists in the real world, much \nresearch reveals that this political-economy \ncontext can explain a large portion of \ntrade barrier formation. This approach is \ncertainly more realistic than the logical \nneoclassic approach, which would suggest \nthat all countries should adopt free trade, \nwith the exception of \u201cinfant industries,\u201d \nstrategic trade policy, and the (theoretical) \noptimal tariff argument. 13 \n\n13  The infant-industry argument suggests that temporary, \nshort-term protection should be used to protect a \ncertain industry in the case of a financial bottleneck \nin developing countries. While there are examples \nof successful infant-industry protection, often the \nargument is used merely as an excuse for traditional \nprotection: most infant industries never grow up. \nStrategic trade policy refers to protection geared to \nencourage economies of scale in an industry by creating \na captive domestic market (and, with lower average \ncosts, enhance competitiveness in global markets) or \nto the protection of one (comparative-disadvantage) \nsector that is a necessary input to a comparative-\nadvantage sector. This argument, too, is problematic; \nwhile the former argument would lead to retaliation, \nthe latter has very weak theoretical foundations. Finally, \nwhile it would be logical for them to do so in theory, \ncountries do not apply tariffs according to an \u201coptimal \ncriterion,\u201d that is, they do not apply tariffs to improve \nterms of trade by forcing down import prices. Besides, \nthe criterion would not apply even theoretically to small \nand developing countries: as they cannot influence their \nrespective terms of trade (they are price takers), the \noptimal tariff would always be zero.\n\nThese dynamic policy considerations \nin the formation of trade barriers suggest \nthe possibility of suboptimal trade policy \nimplementation. While freer trade \nis better for the economic welfare of \nboth the exporting and the importing \ncountries, policy considerations in the \ndomestic market will inevitably lead \nthe government to suboptimal policy \ndecisions for protection. For example, \nantidumping protection is technically \ntriggered when the sale price of an \nexported commodity is lower than its \nprice in the country of origin, and this \nprice differential causes material injury \nto the domestic industry of the importing \ncountry through unfair competition. \nHowever, with the emergence of many \ninterest groups in the industrial sector, the \ngovernments become more vulnerable to \nexternal pressures from industry interests \nto say that dumping has occurred. After \nall, most businesspeople would define \ndumping as merely selling at a price \nthat is lower than their domestic price. \nFurthermore, given the difficulty of \nforming organized consumer-interest \ngroups, the balance of influence will \ntilt toward more heightened protection \nregimes at the cost of consumers\u2019 \nwelfare and efficient allocation of global \nresources. \n\nImplications of rent seeking\n\nExcept in the presence of market failure \n(e.g., where there exist externalities or \nimperfect competition), a standard result \nof economic theory is that government \nintervention in markets tends to lead \nto a less efficient outcome. Tariffs and, \ncertainly, nontariff barriers are no \ndifferent. As discussed above, a tariff \ndistorts consumption patterns and the \nstructure of production, thereby damaging \nthe static welfare of the country. Tariff \nbarriers raise revenue for the government, \nbut other sources of revenue, such as \nvalue-added taxes and direct taxes \n\n\f1\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\n(e.g., income taxes), tend to be less \ndistortionary. Nontariff barriers are even \nworse; they have the same negative \neffects on consumers and the productive \nstructure but often do not produce any \nrevenue at all for the government.\n\nStill, there are strong political reasons \n\nfor applying tariffs. In addition to the \nprocess described above in terms of \ndynamic policy considerations, support for \nprotection is usually justified to the public \nin order to protect national security, jobs, \nthe environment, even a way of life. After \nall, the economic case for free trade is \nso strong that it has essentially created \na consensus in mainstream economics, a \nfield where there is very little consensus \nin other areas. However, except for a \nfew small states, no country completely \nembraces free trade. The political \neconomy of protectionism, therefore, is \nobviously extremely important.\n\nAs long as there is protection, there will \nbe an incentive for rent seeking. 14 Without \nhard-and-fast rules based on economics \n(e.g., free trade or uniform tariffs), \ncomparative-disadvantage industries will \nalways have a strong incentive to lobby \ngovernment officials. This type of rent \nseeking is very costly to the economy.\nThe economic case for FTAs is \nactually strengthened in the context \nof rent seeking if the agreement is \ncomprehensive. Trade creation will \nreduce the lobbying strength of the most \ninefficient domestic firms and, hence, \ntheir capacity to rent-seek. Moreover, if \ntariff revenues are being used inefficiently \nor, worse, are being diverted to the \npockets of customs officials, the creation \nof an FTA, which obviously reduces tariff \n\n14  The term rent seeking was first used by American \neconomist Ann Krueger for a theory developed by \neconomist Gordon Tullock. Tullock\u2019s theory addressed \nthe active creation of monopolies, with the aim of \nachieving supernormal profits or market control, \nin competitive conditions. See A. O. Krueger, \u201cThe \nPolitical Economy of the Rent-Seeking Society,\u201d \nAmerican Economic Review, vol. LXIV (1974), 291\u2013303.\n\nrevenue from intra-regional trade, will \nhave less of a fiscal impact. However, \nfirms may try to include protection in the \nagreement itself to perpetuate protection \nand rents. Complicated rules of origin are \na case in point.\n\nPolitical and strategic considerations\n\nMost existing preferential trading \narrangements were either created as \neconomic arrangements in support of \npolitical goals or at least consistent with \nthe diplomatic strategy of the founding \ncountries. Economic cooperation in these \narrangements is seen as an important \nvehicle for the pursuit of political goals \n(which, in themselves, have important \neconomic ramifications). The EU has been \neffective in using preferential trading \narrangements as diplomatic tools over \nthe past 40 years, in part out of necessity. \nCommercial policy was (and still is) the \nonly truly unified policy at the regional \nlevel (Messerlin 2001).\n\nTo the extent that these regional \naccords add to the political stability of \nthe region, they do service to economic \ndevelopment in general and to the goal \nof policy reform in particular, even if the \narrangements have weak substance to \nthem. This, of course, is an important \npart of the early success story of ASEAN. \nAlthough most ASEAN countries had \nonly recently achieved independence \nand were struggling to create nation-\nstates (complete with many territorial \ndisputes), the arrangement established \nan important dialogue process that \nprevented overt hostilities between these \ncountries. To say that the (intentionally) \nweak economic cooperation initiatives \nin ASEAN had nothing to do with the \nsubsequent dynamic growth in the region \nis to seriously understate its role. \n\nHowever, there is also danger in \nletting political goals dictate economic \nagreements. If the overriding goal \n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  17\n\nis political, then the parties forming \nan agreement will tend to make it as \nrestrictive as possible. This will mean that \nthey will include sectors that will be trade-\ndiverting and avoid liberalizing sectors \nthat will be trade-creating, guaranteeing \nthat the FTA will be inefficient. A \u201cpositive \nlist\u201d approach to trade liberalization, \nin which countries specifically offer the \ncommodities that they would be willing \nto include in a package\u2014as opposed to \na \u201cnegative list\u201d approach, in which all \ncommodities are included apart from \nthose that are explicitly excluded\u2014is \nespecially vulnerable to this problem. \nASEAN\u2019s original Preferential Trade \nAgreement (PTA) and the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation\u2019s \nSouth Asian Preferential Trade Area \n(SAPTA) used the \u201cpositive list\u201d approach, \nand accomplished very little, if anything, \nin stimulating trade. \n\nMoreover, in the more political accords, \n\ncountries signing an agreement will \nlist increasing intra-regional trade and \ninvestment as the main goal. But such an \nobjective is political rather than economic. \nIf the FTA reduces transaction costs and \nincreases efficiency in the region, it will \nbe successful. But this does not necessarily \nmean that it will increase intra-regional \ntrade and investment. For example, if \nthe accord brings in a great deal of FDI \nfrom outside the region, this would serve \nto improve the competitiveness of the \nmember countries and, hence, would \nmean that the FTA is a success. But it \ncould very well be that the production \nfragmentation associated with this FDI as \npart of a global production chain could \nalso reduce intra-regional trade\u2014and \ncertainly, given the fact that the FDI came \nfrom outside the region, intra-regional \nFDI will fall. The important thing is \nthat the economies have become more \ncompetitive, trade and investment has \nincreased, and welfare has improved. The \nnationality of trade and investment flows \n\nis not particularly pertinent, at least from \nan economic perspective. \n\nAs is the case with multilateral \n\nliberalization, FTA negotiations produce a \ncomplicated matrix of political interaction. \nFirst, certain producers\u2019 interests will be \npitted against those of consumer groups. \nSince free trade tends to favor producers \nthat rely heavily on imported inputs, they \nwill generally back FTAs (as well as the \nWTO) but, given the potential for trade \ndiversion, special producer interests will \nattempt to reduce the scope and coverage \nof the agreement. Sectoral conflict will \nalso take place: manufacturing industries, \nfor example, that have dealt with many \nrounds of global trade liberalization may \nwell favor a given FTA, as they expect \nto benefit from trade creation, that is, \nexpansion into partner-country markets. \nHowever, sensitive manufactures will \nresist. Also, agriculture, which has been \nmainly excluded from GATT/WTO \nrounds, tends to be the most complicated \nsector of all because it is often the most \nprotected. The OECD, for example, \nspends $300 billion per year protecting its \nagricultural producers, which constitute \nless than 5% of its workforce. Protection \nis easiest to sell to the public in this sector \nbecause of the need for a certain level \nof agricultural production for national \nsecurity reasons, health issues, and the \n\u201cmultifunctionality\u201d of agriculture (a term \nmuch favored by the French that suggests \nthe need to protect agriculture not only \nfor the reasons just cited but also because \nof its positive effects on protecting and \nbeautifying the countryside). \n\nThere will also be conflicts due to firm \n\nsize. Large firms, which produce with \neconomies of scale, are often in favor of \nFTAs as the greater efficiencies from a \nlarger market in an FTA will have a \u201ccost \nreduction\u201d effect (Corden 1972). Small \nand medium-sized producers, on the other \nhand, will tend to oppose preferential \ntrade agreements as they anticipate being \n\n\f1\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nvulnerable to partner competition. An \nFTA that opens up the retail-food sector, \nfor example, will lead to a proliferation \nof supermarkets and a contraction in the \nnumber of \u201cmom and pop\u201d stores. Even \nimmigration groups will have a role: \ntrade can serve as a substitute for factor \nflows, and so anti-immigration groups \ntend to support FTAs (provided they do \nnot liberalize labor flows). This was the \ncase with NAFTA, which was generally \nsupported by anti-immigration groups in \nthe US.\n\nIn FTA negotiations, therefore, \ngovernments have to negotiate not \nonly with their partners but also with \na complex web of domestic interests. \nCompromises will have to be made across \ngroups within a country and across \ncountries in the FTA. Sometimes structural \nchange in the FTA can be facilitated \nthrough a compensation mechanism \n(e.g., the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram in the US): since the country is \nbetter off with trade creation, it makes \ngood economic sense to compensate the \nlosers. However, constructing efficient, \nwell-targeted compensation mechanisms \ncan be complicated, and certain interests \nwill still oppose liberalization. This \ncomplicated mix of considerations \nunderscores the critical importance of \nestablishing channels of communication \nwith different groups domestically \nbefore and during negotiations, as well \nas putting in place an astute, diverse \nnegotiating team. These topics are dealt \nwith in depth later in the book.\n\neconomics of consolidaTion/\nharmonizaTion\n\nDoes regionalism support unilateral or \nmultilateral reform goals, or does the \ndiscrimination inherent in a trade bloc \nlead to a \u201csecond best\u201d outcome at best, \n\nor an inward-looking one at worst? This is \nthe essence of the \u201cbuilding blocs\u201d versus \n\u201cstumbling blocs\u201d debate. The literature \nwould suggest that several possible \nnegative policy consequences (i.e., \ninherent \u201cstumbling bloc\u201d tendencies) \ncould emerge from an FTA, while other \ntendencies would be consistent with \nmultilateral goals and market-friendly \ndomestic liberalization. We review the \ngeneral arguments for each side below. 15\n\nstumbling Blocs\n\nMaximizing terms-of-trade gains\n\nRegional integration increases the size of \nan economic zone and, hence, increases \nmarket power. The potential benefits of \nexploiting such an advantage by imposing \nan \u201coptimal tariff\u201d (i.e., maximizing the \ndifference between the terms-of-trade \ngains from a tariff regime against its \ncosts in terms of efficiency) are familiar \nfrom the international trade literature. \nMoreover, FTAs and customs unions, \nbecause of the trade-diversion effect, \nimprove the terms of trade of the region \nrelative to the rest of the world. The larger \nthe grouping, the larger the potential \nimprovement in the terms of trade.\n\nIn reality, the first effect is probably \nnot particularly relevant, as even customs \nunions do not impose tariff regimes \naccording to optimum tariff rules. 16 \nMoreover, in the case of both customs \nunions and FTAs, changes in the external \ntariff regime cannot on average be more \nprotective than the pre-integration \n\n15  See Frankel (1997), on which some of these topics are \n\nbased.\n\n16  Nor are they at the country level, as noted earlier. \n\nWhile the optimum tariff argument is one of the three \nclassic economic arguments in favor of protection  \n(the others being the infant-industry argument and  \nstrategic trade policy), it is well recognized as a  \ntheoretical argument. Tariffs are generally \nimplemented for political and political-economy-\nrelated reasons, not as a means of trying to extract \nterms-of-trade gains.\n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  19\n\nstatus quo, according to Article XXIV \nof the GATT/WTO. There can still be \nnegative sectoral effects as some areas \nmay see their tariffs rise, but in this case \nother GATT/WTO members can sue for \ncompensation. \n\nWith respect to the terms-of-trade \neffect, since trade diversion undeniably \nresults from preferential trading \narrangements, it is certainly a concern. \nBut trade diversion is a one-time price \neffect and, hence, static. In fact, as \ndiscussed above, it is the static cost of \npreferential trading accords. \n\nSpecial interests manipulating the contents \nand scope of the agreement\n\nThis concern obviously also manifests \nitself in domestic policy formation. This \nis especially a problem in the context \nof accords between developed and \ndeveloping countries, in which the former \nobviously have the upper hand, as special \ninterests tend to be far better organized \nand funded. Article XXIV of the GATT/\nWTO is not particularly strict in regulating \nFTAs, and with special-interest groups free \nto rent-seek, the outcomes could be less \nefficient. Of course, this could also have \na positive effect: for example, special-\ninterest groups in developed countries \nno doubt push for better protection \nof intellectual property rights (IPR), \ncompetition policy, treatment of FDI, and \nbetter trade and investment facilitation, \nbut these could also have important \npositive effects on efficiency and policy-\nmaking in developing countries.\n\nWaste of scarce negotiating resources\n\nParticularly (but not exclusively) in the \ncase of developing countries, the scarcity \nof well-trained and well-experienced \nexperts in trade negotiations implies an \nopportunity cost of less resources being \ndevoted to multilateral negotiations \n\nif all the talent is engaged in regional \ndeals. Critics of regionalism suggest that \nsuch a capacity constraint can only be \ndetrimental to multilateral liberalization, \nand even policy reform at the national \nlevel. For example, after Viet Nam joined \nASEAN in 1995, it worked not only to \nenter into AFTA but also to implement \na number of other accords, including \nan extensive bilateral trade agreement \n(BTA) with the US in 2001. On top of \nthat, it was working on \u201cASEAN+3\u201d \ninitiatives. Given its human-capital \ncapacity constraints, this could very well \nhave delayed its drive to join the WTO, \nwhich was realized only at the end of \n2006.\n\nOr perhaps not. A counterargument \nwould be that Viet Nam was able to ready \nits economy for the WTO through the \noutward-oriented policies of ASEAN, and \nthe BTA itself was essentially a means \nof preparing Viet Nam for WTO entry, \nincluding legal and administrative reforms \nthat would in any event be necessary. \nThe agreement is replete with references \nto WTO protocols and WTO-consistent \nreforms, from service liberalization \nto \u201cTRIPS-plus.\u201d These negotiations \nhave also sharpened the expertise of \nVietnamese negotiating authorities. \n\nBuilding Blocs \n\nLocked-in policy change\n\nRegional integration can be seen as a \nblueprint for market-friendly reform \nand increased competitiveness in the \ninternational marketplace. Without \nASEAN (and eventually the BTA), one \ncan easily argue that Viet Nam would \nnot have made as much progress (and \nits joining the WTO would no doubt \nhave been further delayed). This effect \nalso applies to industrialized regions. \nWhen Greece (1981) and Spain and \nPortugal (1985) joined the EU, they \n\n\f\u00180\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nwere essentially \u201cnewly industrialized \neconomies,\u201d each having undergone \npolitical instability/transition only a few \nyears before. They each made significant \nstrides in modernizing their policies and \neconomies as a result of EU accession, and \ntoday have significantly closed the gap \nwith advanced industrial economies. \n\nImproved negotiating power for smaller units\n\nTraditionally, the possibility of small \ncountries joining together and working \nas one cohesive unit in trade negotiations \nhas always been considered an important \nadvantage of regionalism. This would \napply both to smaller countries as well \nas to larger units. Free trade areas are \nless effective in this regard relative to \ncustoms unions, as the former do not \ninclude a common external tariff and, \nhence, divergences in interests will persist \nand will make cooperation more difficult. \nHowever, a well-developed system of \nforming joint positions even in an FTA can \nensure that the whole will be greater than \nthe sum of its parts.\n\nA dynamic weeding process as a first step  \ntoward free trade\n\nIt could very well be that the process of \nstructural adjustment unleashed by a \nregional trading arrangement through \ntrade creation could, in effect, facilitate \nmultilateral accords. As the weakest \n(and, therefore, more resistant to any \ninternational competition) are weeded \nout, through an FTA or other means, \nthe stock of opposition to trade falls in \nimportance, thereby making multilateral \ninitiatives easier. \n\nPerhaps a heuristic example will \n\nillustrate the point. Suppose that the trade \npolicies of a country (let us call it \u201chome\u201d) \nare determined by domestic firms, and \n\u201chome\u201d trades with two other countries\u2014 \n\u201cpartner\u201d (i.e., the country that will \n\neventually form an FTA with \u201chome\u201d) and \n\u201crest of the world.\u201d Furthermore, assume \nthat, in autarky, there are six industries, \nwith the linear cost structures of the firms \nin the home country being such that two \nare globally competitive (in goods A and \nB), two are competitive only regionally \n(in goods C and D, in a potential FTA \nwith \u201cpartner\u201d), and two will never \nbe competitive with trade (in goods E \nand F). Now, assume that the \u201chome\u201d \ngovernment puts to a vote whether or not \nthe country should move to free trade. \nFirms producing A and B will vote yes, as \nthey will benefit from a larger market, but \nthe other four firms will vote against it, as \nfree trade will put them out of business. \nWe remain in an autarkic equilibrium. \nBut suppose now that the home country \nvotes on whether or not it should have an \nFTA with \u201cpartner.\u201d The firms producing \ngoods A, B, C, and D will vote in favor, \nand those producing E and F, against. The \nFTA will pass. Eventually, competition \nfrom the partner country will force out \nthe production of goods E and F in the \nhome country (trade creation), and there \nwill be no trade diversion (as we began \nin autarky). The remaining firms in the \nhome country will, therefore, eventually \nproduce only A, B, C, and D. Next, assume \nthat the home country votes once again \non whether or not it should have free \ntrade. The votes will now be two in favor \n(A and B) and two against (C and D); \nassuming that consumers have even a \nlittle say would be sufficient to usher in \nfree trade, because of the FTA \u201cstepping \nstone\u201d process.\n\nCompetitive liberalization to attract \ninternational capital, as well as a  \npositive \u201cthreat\u201d\n\nRegional integration can be used as \na means of rendering the component \neconomies more efficient, competitive, \nand market-friendly. While a grouping \n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00181\n\nmay or may not adopt global \u201cbest \npractices\u201d in regulatory, legal, and \nother issues, it can reduce the stock of \ndivergences across countries, thereby \nmaking it easier to integrate globally. \nBy reducing transaction costs across \ncountries, an FTA can enhance its \nattractiveness to MNCs. As an FTA \n\u201cdeepens,\u201d and policy externalities thus \nbecome increasingly important, the \nincentive to internalize them through \nmonitoring, information sharing, \ncloser cooperation, etc., increases. \nBecause trade and financial links are \nbecoming increasingly important and \nrecognized, countries within an FTA soon \nfind it useful\u2014or even necessary\u2014to \nfurther financial and macroeconomic \ncooperation. It may also be true that \nregional agreements can be used as \nimplicit and explicit \u201cthreats,\u201d particularly \nsince FTAs seem to have a tendency to \ngrow over time.\n\nIn sum, both the \u201cstumbling bloc\u201d and \n\u201cbuilding bloc\u201d arguments have theoretical \nmerit. But in practice, the inclination of \nthe regional accord tends to be extremely \nimportant. Clearly, if the group is being \nformed to enhance inward-looking \ndevelopment strategies or to isolate the \nregion from global competition, this initial \npolicy direction would set in motion many \nof the problems discussed above. In fact, \nthis approach led to the downfall of many \nregional trading agreements in the past, \nespecially in Latin America (e.g., the \nLatin American Free Trade Area). Yet, if \noutward-looking economies were to form \na regional grouping, regionalism is likely \nto promote the goals of domestic policy \nreform and multilateral liberalization. \nThese factors, among others, are \nresponsible:\n\n(i) \n\nIt is unlikely that a country \nwishing to promote outward-\nlooking policies, including \nextensive unilateral liberalization \n\nand active participation in the \nWTO, would contradict this stance \nin favor of a regionally closed \nsystem. \n\n(ii)  Reductions in trade barriers within \na preferential trading arrangement \nmake it more attractive for a \ncountry to reduce external barriers, \nin effect \u201cMFN-izing\u201d regional \nconcessions, because the most \nimportant cost of regionalism, as \nnoted above, is trade diversion and \nlower external barriers will reduce \nthe associated costs. \n\n(iii)  \u201cWeeding out\u201d least-competitive \nindustries, and making the \npolitical economy of trade \nliberalization more favorable \nover time, seems to have been \nimportant empirically. 17\n(iv)  The membership of FTAs and \n\nother cooperative accords tends \nto expand and to become more \ndiverse over time, thereby \nreducing regional sources of \nsupport for protectionism in a \nparticular country and industry, \nas well as reducing the overall \npotential for trade diversion. \nThis has been true for the EU, \nNAFTA, AFTA, the South American \nCommon Market (Mercosur), and \nother agreements. \n\ninconsistencies between agreements:  \n\u201cspaghetti Bowl\u201d effect\n\nThe boom in the number of separately \nnegotiated FTAs has often been blamed \nfor the \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d or \u201cAsian noodle \nbowl\u201d effect in the region. As mentioned \nearlier, these FTAs can be quite different \nfrom one another in coverage, depth of \nliberalization, and the specific regulations \nthat make the accord function (e.g., the \n\n17  \u201cAnecdotally\u201d would perhaps be more accurate, as \nthe empirical literature on this subject is not well \ndeveloped.\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\n\u201crules of origin\u201d discussed below). Their \ninherent inconsistencies and (sometimes) \ncontradictions could be a real problem \nin the global marketplace. A strong \nadvantage of the WTO framework is that \nit generally, but not totally, avoids this \nproblem.\n\nComplicated \u201crules of origin\u201d (ROOs) \n\nin FTAs are often cited as the most \nobvious example of the \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d \nproblem. Later in this reference we discuss \nROOs at length. Suffice it to note here \nthat they are necessary in FTAs to avoid \n\u201ctrade deflection.\u201d An example would \nbest illustrate the point. Suppose that \nIndia and Malaysia were to form an FTA. \nFurther, assume that tariffs on television \nsets are high in India but are low in \nMalaysia. Once the agreement is in place, \nJapanese exporters, for instance, will have \nan incentive to \u201cdeflect\u201d their exports \nfrom India to Malaysia, where they will \npay a low tariff, and then reexport the \ntelevision sets to India from Malaysia to \ntake advantage of duty-free access. This \nwill lower the tariff costs for the Japanese \nexporter. To avoid this possibility, any \nIndia-Malaysia FTA should include ROOs \nfor products that seek to take advantage of \nthe FTA.\n\nThe problem is that ROOs can be used \n\nas a protectionist technique, with high \nROOs being used as a way of protecting \ndomestic interests. Each FTA tends to \nbe unique and can choose its own ROO \nregime\u2014Article XXIV is completely silent \non the issue\u2014but many of them tend to \nbe extremely complicated, especially when \nthe FTA includes an OECD country. NAFTA, \nfor example, is a liberal FTA by most \nmeasures, but its ROO regime is infamous: \nthe ROO for automobiles, for example, is \n62.5% and for certain textiles, 100%.\n\nMoreover, the diversity of these ROO \nregimes is problematic. A country with \nmany FTAs could end up having different \nROOs for trade in a certain product for \neach FTA, potentially creating confusion \n\nbut also influencing the input-sourcing \ndecisions of the firm in a way that could \nhamper efficiency. Thailand, for example, \nhas FTAs with both Australia and New \nZealand. And even though Australia and \nNew Zealand themselves form one of the \nmost advanced FTAs in the world (the \nCloser Economic Relations agreement), \nthe set of ROOs for Thailand\u2019s FTA with \neach is different. Hence, a Thai producer \nthat exports to both Australia and New \nZealand may need to have a different \nproduction strategy for exports to each \nmarket. That would be costly in a number \nof ways to the Thai producer, which could \nlose scale economies, among others.\nExactly how costly these different \nROO regimes are to any given country is \nunclear. Some economists estimate the \ncompliance costs at 3\u20135% of the value of \nexports, but others suggest that the cost \nis lower. And governments can reduce the \nassociated costs by providing information \nto exporting firms and importers. The \nSingapore Government, for example, puts \nout an interactive CD-ROM that provides \ndetails to Singaporean firms regarding \nthe ROOs for any product and any FTA \ninvolving Singapore. \n\nWhat is clear is that the \u201cspaghetti \n\nbowl\u201d effect\u2014in terms of ROOs or \nother aspects of FTAs that tend to be \ninconsistent between countries\u2014does \nhave at least some economic cost. \nGreater harmonization of policies in \nthese agreements, in ways that would be \nmore consistent with economic efficiency \n(\u201cbest practices\u201d), would obviously be \nadvantageous, particularly as the number \nof FTAs in the region continues to grow. \nWe consider a set of best practices in the \nnext section.\n\nenhancing consistency in agreements:  \nBest Practices\n\nOne way to avoid inconsistency \nassociated with the \u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d \n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\neffect would be to have rules that govern \nFTAs. Article XXIV does have some \ngeneral rules, but they are extremely \ngeneral and have proven very difficult \nto tighten. At the Doha Development \nAgenda negotiations, for example, the \nproblem of the growing number of FTAs \nwas evident, but, even with a successful \noutcome, any improvement in FTA \nrules is likely to relate only to greater \ntransparency. It would be useful to define \na set of rules that would minimize the \nnegative effects of FTAs and maximize \nthe positive effects. This is especially \nimportant in the light of the FTA \nmovement in Asia, where policies, rather \nthan being inward-looking, are directed \nmore toward efficiency goals. We might \ncall such rules \u201cbest practices\u201d of FTAs. \nBelow are 10 major areas that might be \nconsidered in this regard: 18\n\n(i)\t Product\tcoverage:\tGoods.\t  \n\nComprehensive coverage is best, to be \nincluded within a reasonable period \nof time (defined as 10 years by the \nGATT/WTO). Article XXIV of the \nGATT/WTO stipulates that, in \nan FTA or customs agreement, \nproduct coverage should include \n\u201csubstantially all goods.\u201d But the \nexclusion of individual products \ncan be problematic on efficiency \ngrounds, particularly when it \ninvolves products that are used \nas inputs in the production chain. \nThus, to the greatest extent \npossible, the FTA should include \nall goods. Some will no doubt be \nexcluded either temporarily or \npermanently, but such exemptions \nshould be as few as possible \nand should take into account \nthe important effects that they \nmight have on the effective rate \n\n18  These best practices were developed by ADB; see \n\nPlummer (forthcoming 2007) for details.\n\nof protection, as well as on trade \ndiversion.  \n\n(ii)\t Product\tcoverage:\tServices.\t Again, \n\ncomprehensive coverage and a reasonable \ntime period for implementation are \nbest from an economic perspective, \nand transparency is important in \nsome areas. Services present some \nspecial and important challenges. \nCertain services are fairly easy \nto liberalize, e.g., in terms of \nallowing for the movement of \nprofessional persons, tourist-\nrelated services, and even high-\ntech/knowledge-based services. \nOthers are extremely difficult. \nEducational services tend to \nbe highly protected. Financial \nservices are often the most difficult \nto include in any liberalization \npackage. Still, the gains from trade \nin services are no less than those \nfrom trade in goods, and yet there \nhas been far greater attention \nto the latter in multilateral \nagreements and most FTAs.\n(iii)\t Rules\tof\torigin.\t Rules of origin \n\nshould be as low as possible as well as \nsymmetrical. As noted above, abuses \nof ROOs in FTAs are problematic. \nStringent rules could have \nimportant trade-diversion and \ninvestment-diversion effects, with \na potentially high cost to non-\npartners and greater inefficiencies \nin partner countries. To avoid this, \ngenerous and consistent ROOs are \nof the essence. \n\nextent possible, customs procedures should \nfollow global best practices and GATT/\nWTO-consistent protocols. Customs \nand related procedures are at the \nheart of \u201ctrade facilitation,\u201d a key \npriority in the Doha Development \nAgenda. They are obviously \nclosely related to ROOs, as one \nof the key challenges of customs \n\n(iv)\t Customs\tprocedures.\t To the greatest \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\n(v)\t\n\nofficials is to clear countries \nof origin of imports. Regional \ntrading agreements can be used as \ninstruments to modernize customs \nlaws, regulations, administrative \nguidelines, and procedures. \nIntellectual\tproperty\tprotection.\t IPR \nguidelines should be nondiscriminatory \nand consistent with TRIPS, TRIPS Plus, \nand related international conventions. \nAs will be noted later in this \nreference book, the protection of \nIPR is one of the most sensitive \nissues in negotiating FTAs. \nDeveloped countries, having a \nstrong comparative advantage \nin IPR-intensive products, want \nto make sure that IPR is taken \nseriously both de facto and \nde jure. Developing countries \noften criticize the IPR stance of \ndeveloped countries as being \ntoo severe and too favorable to \ninnovators, e.g., granting patent \nmonopolies for an exaggerated \nlength of time, or being too \ninsensitive in areas such as \npharmaceuticals. On the other \nhand, it may be that stronger, \nmore serious IPR protection \ncan actually be positive for the \ndevelopment of a country\u2019s own \ninnovative and artistic sectors, \nbesides promoting more FDI and \ntechnology transfer. \n(vi)\t Foreign\tdirect\tinvestment.\t  \n\nInvestment-related provisions should \nembrace national treatment and \nnondiscrimination, shun performance \nrequirements, have a highly inclusive \nnegative list, and provide the usual \nprotection to foreign investors. In \nparticular, national treatment \nis critical in this regard, as it \nhas important implications \nfor creating a competitive \nenvironment and a \u201clevel playing \nfield.\u201d\n\n(vii)\t Antidumping\tprocedures.\t  \n\n(viii)\tGovernment\tprocurement.\t  \n\nAntidumping procedures and dispute \nresolution need to be transparent and \nfair, and the process needs to be well \nspecified and effective. Antidumping \nand countervailing duties, also \nknown as \u201cadministrative actions,\u201d \nwere discussed briefly above. They \nmay or may not be stipulated \ndirectly in an agreement; \nsometimes, the references may be \nexclusively directed to the WTO \ndispute resolution. Antidumping \nclauses in an FTA might be used \nto tighten antidumping evaluation \nprocedures, promote transparency, \nand expedite processes. But it \nis also important that dispute \nsettlement procedures are \nclearly identified and respected. \nOtherwise, confusion can follow. \n\nGovernment procurement should \nbe as open and nondiscriminatory, \nand procedures as clear and open, \nas possible. The size of the state \nsector varies across the region \nand internationally, but in \nmost countries government \nprocurement is a significant \nsector. There is a WTO Agreement \non Government Procurement, but \nnot all WTO member countries \nare signatories. 19 Moreover, the \nrules on market access in this \nagreement are relatively limited. \nThe chapters on government \nprocurement in the \u201cdeeper\u201d \nFTAs tend to go much further. \n\u201cBest practices\u201d would require \nthat the arrangement produce \na transparent, open, and \nnondiscriminatory regime that \ngrants national treatment as much \nas possible to partner countries, \n\n19  In this sense this World Trade Organization (WTO) \n\nagreement is sometimes referred to as a voluntary or \nplurilateral agreement.\n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\nwith an excluded (negative) \nlist as short as feasible and the \nthreshold-bid level as low as \npractical.\n\n(ix)\t Competition.\t Policies related to \ncompetition should create a \u201clevel \nplaying field\u201d for both locals and \npartners, and they should not put non-\npartner competition at a disadvantage. \nMany countries in Asia do not \nhave a competition policy per \nse. But trade and investment \nliberalization is affected by \nindustrial organization at the \ndomestic level, and this becomes \nan especially important area in \ncountries having active state-\nowned enterprises. Hence, \nit follows that \u201cdeep\u201d FTAs \nshould have basic rules and \nprocedures designed to prevent \nanticompetitive behavior from \nstate-owned enterprises, quasi-\nstate firms, privately owned \ndomestic monopolies/oligopolies, \nand the like, that would give them \na competitive edge over foreign \ncompetition.    \n\n(x)\t Technical\tbarriers\tto\ttrade.\t These \n\nshould be kept to a minimum and \nharmonized in a nondiscriminatory way, \nwith clear and transparent mechanisms \nfor determining standards. The WTO \nAgreement on Technical Barriers \nto Trade (TBT) attempts to \n\u201censure that technical negotiations \nand standards, as well as testing \nand certification procedures, do \nnot create unnecessary obstacles \nto trade.\u201d TBT takes on particular \nsignificance at the global level, \nas many of its aspects, including \nharmonization of standards, \n\u201cmutual recognition,\u201d definition \nof legitimate means of protecting \nanimal and plant life and the \nenvironment, should have global \nrules of conduct. International \n\nstandards, however, are bound to \nbe general; FTAs, as they involve \nonly a few or several countries, \ncan potentially achieve far \ndeeper means of integration and \nprogress in this area. What would \nbe critical for efficiency and \noutward orientation, therefore, \nwould be TBT clauses based on \ninternational standards, having \nhigh levels of transparency, \nembracing best practices, and \neschewing discrimination against \noutsiders as much as possible.\n\nIn sum, by adopting best practices, \nFTAs can generate significant gains in \neconomic efficiency, well beyond the \neffects of traditional FTAs and, arguably, \nbeyond what any realistic multilateral \napproach could possibly hope to generate. \n\nsummary\n\nTrade policy is complicated. While \neconomic theory strongly supports \nfree trade and outward-oriented trade \nagreements, trade policy is decidedly \nin the political realm and, hence, \neconomic arguments constitute only \none\u2014albeit essential\u2014dimension of \ntrade negotiations. Still, it is important \nthat negotiators are aware of the \neconomic benefits of liberalization and \nthe economic costs to an economy of \ninward-looking policies. Rarely is the \nmost efficient outcome forthcoming from \nany multilateral, regional, or bilateral \nnegotiation. The trick is to maximize \nthe efficient aspects of any given accord \nand minimize any potential negative \nimplications.\n\nThis assessment of the costs and benefits \n\nof trade liberalization, at the global and \nbilateral/regional levels, was the main \nobjective of Part I, which also considered \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\npolitical determinants of trade policy. \nMoreover, given that Asian economies \nhave explicitly expressed their desire for \nFTAs to be outward-looking rather than \ninward-looking, we considered rules of \n\nthumb that would be useful in creating \nsuch arrangements (or, perhaps, merging \nthem in the future). In Parts II and III, we \nfocus specifically on component parts of \nFTAs and practical issues.\n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00187\n\nappendix to Part i:  application of a computable \ngeneral equilibrium model to fTas\n\nT rade models have become \n\nincreasingly useful tools for \nanalyzing the economic impact \nof trade agreements in recent years. \nAdvances in theory, analytical techniques, \nand data processing power of computers \nhave enabled analysts to assess the impact \nof trade agreements in quantitative terms \nand compare the effects under different \nscenarios. For instance, an estimate of the \nimpact of the Doha Round shows global \ngains of $68.6 billion to $155.2 billion by \n2025 (ADB 2006). Another estimate shows \nthat full liberalization of merchandise \ntrade would result in a $291 billion to \n$518 billion increase in world income by \n2015 (World Bank 2004). Meanwhile, \nbilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) like \nthe Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership \nAgreement have been estimated to \nincrease the income of Japan by $6.9 \nbillion and that of Singapore by $0.4 \nbillion (Hertel et al. 2001). Given the wide \nrange of estimates and possible impact \non developing member countries, it is \nimportant to gain a basic understanding \nof the simulation models being used and \ntheir strengths and weaknesses. \n\nAs noted in Box 1.4 above, the most \n\ncommon trade model is the global \ncomputable general equilibrium (CGE) \nmodel. The CGE model is based on \nthe concept of a general equilibrium, \nwhere supply equals demand in each \nmarket in the economy. The chart below \npresents an overview of the elements of \na typical CGE model and shows the links \nbetween markets. To achieve market \nequilibrium, prices are assumed to adjust \nuntil demand for factors of production \nequals available endowments, consumers \n\nhave chosen the desired basket of goods \ngiven their incomes, and firms have \nchosen production levels that maximize \ntheir profits. Because an FTA introduces \na set of policy changes in an economy, \nCGE models simulate an economy \nwhere markets have adjusted and a new \nequilibrium has been reached.The effect \nof an FTA can be estimated by comparing \nincomes under the old equilibrium with \nthose under the new equilibrium.\n\nThe attraction of a CGE model is that \nit arrives at a numerically exact answer \n(in the form of a change in income) \nwhile ensuring theoretically consistent \nresults. A CGE model identifies the \nsources of income gains or losses from \nfurther opening up to trade and shows \nhow these gains or losses are distributed \nacross countries or regions. Hence, \nCGE simulations can be used in FTA \nnegotiations to highlight, for example, \nthe sectoral and production effects of \nsome of the FTA provisions that could \nhurt vulnerable groups in an economy. \nThis would give a good idea of how the \ngovernment should target any assistance \ndesigned to facilitate restructuring \nand compensate the losers. Multiple \nsimulations can also be undertaken to \nwork out alternative scenarios that might \nturn national income losses from an FTA \ninto gains. Because of the multiplicity of \nlinks in an economy, a simple diagram \nmay not show all the effects of an FTA, \nwhereas CGE and other computer-based \nmodels allow systematic tracking of all \nthe interactions.\n\nThe CGE models used in empirical \n\nstudies vary somewhat in their underlying \neconomic structure, behavior of agents, \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nand focus. Box 1.4 presents different \ntypes of CGE models and their uses. With \na CGE model, simulation exercises can \nbe conducted to evaluate the welfare \ngains under different FTA scenarios. The \nprimary focus of such policy scenarios is \nthe removal of price distortions against \nimports that arise from trade barriers and \nother sources. An example of such an \napproach might best illustrate the point. \nA CGE model was used to evaluate gains \nfrom the following Asian FTA scenarios:\n\n(i)  Fragmented scenario: a \n\ncontinuation of the current wave \nof bilateralism, where the region \nis fragmented by several bilateral \nor small regional FTAs;\n\n(ii)  ASEAN+3 FTA scenario: free trade \n\namong Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) countries, \nthe PRC (including Hong Kong, \nChina), Japan, and the Republic \nof Korea;\n\n(iii)  Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation \n\n(APEC) FTA scenario: free trade \namong APEC members; and \n(iv)  Global trade liberalization scenario: \ncomplete abolition of import \ntariffs and export subsidies.\n\nThe economic impact of these FTA \nscenarios was estimated with the use \nof ADB\u2019s General Equilibrium Model \nfor Asian Trade (GEMAT) (see Box 1.4 \nabove). The results for gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) and welfare with \nequivalent variation for the four policy \nscenarios are given in the table below. \nExpectedly, a fragmented reality of \nmultiple bilateral and regional FTAs is \nthe least attractive for all regions and \ncountries. Among others, this scenario \nmay give rise to the famous Asian \n\u201cnoodle bowl\u201d effect, which refers to the \nhigher transaction cost from multiple \nROOs and standards in the growing \nnumber of FTAs in East Asia.\n\nElements of a CGE Model:\nThe Circular Flow in an Open Economy\n\nSavings\n\nInvestment\n\nInternational Sector\n\nConsumption\n\nGoods and Services\n\nHouseholds\n\nCapital Goods\n\nFirms\n\nFactor Services of Production\n\nFactor Incomes\n\nCge\u2002=\u2002computable\u2002general\u2002equilibrium.\nsource:\u2002plummer\u2002and\u2002wignaraja\u2002(2006);\u2002Kawai\u2002and\u2002wignaraja\u2002(2007)\n\n\fparT\u2002i:\u2002 eConomiCs\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00189\n\nImpact of Four FTA Scenarios, Change in Real Income (Equivalent Variation)\n\nFragmented \nScenario\n\nASEAN+\u0018FTA \nScenario\n\nAPEC FTA \nScenario\n\nGlobal Free \nTrade Scenario\n\nin\u2002$\u2002million\u2002(2001\u2002prices)\n\nRegion/ \nCountry\n\nnortheast\u2002asia\n\nasean\n\nrest\u2002of\u2002asia\n\nus\n\neurope\n\nworld\n\nrest\u2002of\u2002the\u2002world\n\nnortheast\u2002asia\n\nasean\n\nrest\u2002of\u2002asia\n\nus\n\neurope\n\nworld\n\nrest\u2002of\u2002the\u2002world\n\n(1,219)\n\n8,869\n\n(101)\n\n(1,371)\n\n(1,021)\n\n(555)\n\n4,401\n\n(0.02)\n\n1.72\n\n(0.01)\n\n(0.01)\n\n(0.01)\n\n(0.01)\n\n0.01\n\n21,724\n\n10,375\n\n(425)\n\n(2,362)\n\n(904)\n\n(464)\n\n27,546\n\n0.37\n\n2.02\n\n(0.06)\n\n(0.02)\n\n(0.01)\n\n(0.01)\n\n0.09\n\nin\u2002%\u2002of\u2002gdp\n\n56,734\n\n8,341\n\n(1,560)\n\n12,035\n\n(3,047)\n\n280\n\n74,689\n\n0.96\n\n1.62\n\n(0.22)\n\n0.12\n\n(0.04)\n\n0.01\n\n0.25\n\n72,944\n\n11,319\n\n4,288\n\n22,884\n\n25,325\n\n14,861\n\n153,718\n\n1.23\n\n2.20\n\n0.61\n\n0.24\n\n0.30\n\n0.34\n\n0.51\n\napeC\u2002=\u2002asia\u2002pacific\u2002economic\u2002Cooperation,\u2002asean\u2002=\u2002association\u2002of\u2002southeast\u2002asian\u2002nations,\u2002fTa\u2002=\u2002free-trade\u2002agreement,\u2002\ngdp\u2002=\u2002gross\u2002domestic\u2002product,\u2002us\u2002=\u2002united\u2002states\u2002of\u2002america.\u2002source:\u2002adb\u2002staff\u2002simulations.\n\nUnder the ASEAN+3 scenario, the \n\nWhile trade models like the CGE \n\nwelfare of members increases, with \nNortheast Asian GDP increasing by \n0.37% and ASEAN GDP by 2.02%, \nwhile nonmembers (the rest of Asia, US, \nEurope, and the rest of the world) incur \nmodest losses. An APEC FTA brings gains \nto Northeast Asia and the US but less \ngains to ASEAN than under a fragmented \nscenario. The rest of Asia and Europe, \nwhich would be excluded from an APEC \nFTA, also lose relative to the first scenario. \nGlobal free trade is the most attractive but \nunrealistic scenario since even the Doha \nDevelopment Agenda process, which \ndoes not aspire to global free trade, has \nbeen beset by uncertainties regarding \nthe timing and depth of multilateral \nagreements needed to reduce trade \nbarriers (see Plummer and Wignaraja \n[2006] for an analysis of the impact of \nthe different scenarios on East Asian \neconomies).\n\nmodel are useful in quantifying \nthe impact of FTAs, the drawbacks \ninclude their reliance on the quality of \ninformation fed into the model and on \nthe assumptions used in simulations. \nData may not always be of high quality \nand could be missing, links between \nmarkets in the economy may not always \nbe accurately specified, and different \nscenarios and model specifications \ncan mean different results. Moreover, \nexisting CGE modeling frameworks \ndo not include many aspects of trade \nagreements\u2014barriers to services, \ncompetition policies, investment rules, \nand other nontariff measures (e.g., \nsanitary and phytosanitary standards \nand technical barriers to trade), which \nare likely to afford more protection \nfor domestic industries than tariffs. \nAccordingly, the impact of these issues is \nnot reflected in the simulation results.\n\n\f\u00180\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nCGE models are best used in \n\nconjunction with other empirical tools\u2014\nnotably analysis of the complex structure \nof FTAs, econometric methods, country \nor case studies, and policy analysis. For \nexample, Gilbert et al. (2004) used both \nthe CGE model and a gravity model to \nanalyze regional trade agreements in \nAsia. A gravity model seeks to explain \nthe pattern of bilateral trade and its \nevolution over time in terms of certain \nfundamental variables. While a CGE \nmodel can show the effect of an FTA \n\nin the future, a gravity model shows \nthe historical pattern of trade. The \nfindings from a CGE model could also \nbe supported by country or case studies \nto highlight the possible microeconomic \nimpact of FTAs not accounted for by the \nmodels. Nonetheless, the results of CGE \nsimulations are useful in giving a sense \nof the order of magnitude that a change \nin policy can mean for economic welfare. \nHence, CGE models are complements, not \nsubstitutes, for a thorough policy analysis \nof FTAs.\n\n\fPart II:  \nCoverage of a Free \nTrade Agreement\n\nTrade in goods\n\nu nder the WTO rules, a member may enter into a trade \n\narrangement 20 with one or more other members under \nwhich they grant more favorable access to exports from \n\none another than to exports from other WTO members. As \ndiscussed in Part I, the basic rules governing this exception to \nthe WTO\u2019s MFN clause, or nondiscriminatory treatment for \ntrade in goods, are found in the GATT Article XXIV. Under this \narticle, a free trade agreement (FTA) binds a group of two or \nmore concurring countries 21 to eliminate tariffs and other trade \nbarriers on substantially all the trade between them in products \noriginating in any of the member countries, within a reasonable \nlength of time. \n\nCertain terms of Article XXIV are supplemented by the \nUnderstanding on the Interpretation of Article XXIV of GATT \n1994 (hereafter, \u201cUnderstanding\u201d), which was endorsed as part \nof the Uruguay Round agreements. The Understanding, however, \nis more specific on some significant points. For instance, where \nArticle XXIV indicates that tariffs should be eliminated within a \n\u201creasonable length of time,\u201d the Understanding is more explicit, \nstating that an agreement allowing more than 10 years would \nrequire \u201ca full explanation to the Council for Trade in Goods of \nthe need for a longer period.\u201d The Understanding is also more \nspecific on the criteria and procedures for the required review \nof new or enlarged free-trade areas by the Council for Trade in \nGoods. For developing countries, the 1979 Decision on Differential \n\n20  The WTO often uses the term \u201cregional\u201d to refer to FTAs and other integration \n\narrangements even when the members involved are not part of the same region and \nare far apart geographically, as in the Republic of Korea\u2013Chile and US-Australia FTAs.\n\n21  Article XXIV refers to \u201ccustoms territories\u201d\u2014territories with their own schedule of \ntariffs and other trade regulations. Thus, customs territories are usually countries. \nHowever, a country may have two or more distinct customs territories, as in the case of \nthe PRC and Hong Kong, China.\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nand More Favorable Treatment, \nReciprocity and Fuller Participation \nof Developing Countries (hereafter, \n\u201cEnabling Clause\u201d) 22 gives these countries \nmore leeway in the time allowed for \ncomplying with the GATT requirements, \nincluding Article XXIV, and generally takes \na more lenient stand on the review of \nFTAs between such countries.\n\nProvisions on trade in goods form \nthe heart of an FTA, and the mutual \ndesire to expand exports underlies every \nagreement. An FTA is a way for like-\nminded countries to reap the benefits \nof openness at a faster rate than is \nsustainable for the WTO, with its much \nlarger and more diverse membership. \nFrom the point of view of beneficial \nexpansion of trade in goods, potential \npartners may be compatible in several \nways. First, they may have significant \ndifferences in comparative advantage, \nusually indicated by internal relative \nprices. The Republic of Korea\u2013Chile FTA \nillustrates (see Case Study 2.1) such \na pairing, with the Republic of Korea \nenjoying strong comparative advantage in \nmanufacturing and Chile enjoying strong \ncomparative advantage in agricultural \nproducts. Moreover, each country is \nhighly competitive in these sectors at the \nglobal level, suggesting that losses due \nto trade diversion will be small relative \nto trade creation. But potential partners \nmay also be compatible because one or \nboth need access to a larger integrated \nmarket to benefit from scale economies \nin production or increased competition. \nIn this case the dynamic gains may \nbe important even if significant trade \ndiversion implies losses in terms of the \nstatic effects. \n\nThe formation of an FTA may reduce \nthe welfare of excluded trading partners, \nespecially if significant trade diversion \nresults, i.e., if tariff-free imports from \npartners replace lower-cost goods still \n\n22  As part of the Tokyo Round agreements.\n\nbox\u20022.1:\u2002 WTO Disciplines in  \n\nTrade-in-Goods Provisions\n\naside\u2002from\u2002compliance\u2002with\u2002the\u2002minimum\u2002requirements\u2002\nof\u2002the\u2002exception\u2002to\u2002the\u2002most-favored\u2002nation\u2002(mfn)\u2002\nclause,\u2002most\u2002free\u2002trade\u2002agreeents\u2002(fTas)\u2002also\u2002adopt\u2002or\u2002\ndraw\u2002reference\u2002to\u2002wTo\u2002principles\u2002and\u2002disciplines.\u2002a\u2002\nnumber\u2002of\u2002asian\u2002fTas\u2002have\u2002the\u2002following\u2002provisions:\u2002\n\nNational Treatment\n\n\u201ceach\u2002party\u2002shall\u2002accord\u2002national\u2002treatment\u2002to\u2002the\u2002\ngoods\u2002of\u2002the\u2002other\u2002party\u2002in\u2002accordance\u2002with\u2002article\u2002iii\u2002\nof\u2002the\u2002gaTT\u20021994\u2002and\u2002to\u2002this\u2002end\u2002article\u2002iii\u2002of\u2002the\u2002gaTT\u2002\nis\u2002incorporated\u2002into\u2002and\u2002made\u2002part\u2002of\u2002this\u2002agreement.\u201d\u2002\nThe\u2002national-treatment\u2002clause\u2002affords\u2002no\u2002less\u2002favorable\u2002\ntreatment\u2002of\u2002the\u2002goods\u2002of\u2002the\u2002other\u2002party\u2002than\u2002the\u2002most\u2002\nfavorable\u2002treatment\u2002the\u2002party\u2002accords\u2002to\u2002its\u2002own\u2002goods.\u2002\n\nImport and Export Restrictions\n\n\u201ceach\u2002party\u2002shall\u2002not\u2002institute\u2002or\u2002maintain\u2002any\u2002\n\nprohibition\u2002or\u2002restriction\u2002other\u2002than\u2002customs\u2002duties\u2002on\u2002\nthe\u2002importation\u2002of\u2002any\u2002good\u2002of\u2002the\u2002other\u2002party\u2002or\u2002on\u2002the\u2002\nexportation\u2002or\u2002sale\u2002for\u2002export\u2002of\u2002any\u2002good\u2002destined\u2002for\u2002\nthe\u2002other\u2002party,\u2002which\u2002is\u2002inconsistent\u2002with\u2002its\u2002obligations\u2002\nunder\u2002article\u2002xi\u2002of\u2002the\u2002gaTT\u20021994\u2002and\u2002its\u2002relevant\u2002\nprovisions\u2002under\u2002the\u2002wTo\u2002agreement.\u201d\u2002[emphasis\u2002\nsupplied]\u2002\n\nNontariff Measures \n\n\u201ceach\u2002party\u2002shall\u2002not\u2002introduce\u2002or\u2002maintain\u2002any\u2002\nnontariff\u2002measures\u2002on\u2002the\u2002importation\u2002of\u2002any\u2002good\u2002\nof\u2002the\u2002other\u2002party\u2002or\u2002on\u2002the\u2002exportation\u2002or\u2002sale\u2002for\u2002\nexport\u2002of\u2002any\u2002good\u2002destined\u2002for\u2002the\u2002other\u2002party\u2002which\u2002\nare\u2002inconsistent\u2002with\u2002its\u2002obligations\u2002under\u2002the\u2002wTo\u2002\nagreement.\u201d\u2002[emphasis\u2002supplied]\u2002\n\nsource:\u2002legal\u2002text\u2002of\u2002various\u2002fTas.\u2002\n\nsubject to tariffs.

The Understanding notes that \nthe value of an FTA is \u201cdiminished if any \nmajor sector of trade is excluded,\u201d and \nAPEC best-practice guidelines call for \n\u201cliberalization in all sectors.\u201d \n\nFTA concessions on trade in goods \ninclude either reduction or elimination of \ntariffs through (i) immediate elimination 26 \n\n24  The interpretation of that expression has remained \n\ncontentious. Two approaches, not mutually exclusive, \nare typical in  that respect:\n\n\u2022 The quantitative approach favors the definition of a \nstatistical benchmark, such as a certain percentage \nof the trade between regional trade agreement (RTA) \nparties, to indicate that the coverage of a given RTA \nfulfills the requirement.\n\n\u2022 The qualitative approach sees the requirement as \n\nmeaning that no sector (or at least no major sector) \nis to be kept out of intra-RTA trade liberalization. \nThis approach is aimed at preventing the exclusion \nfrom RTA liberalization of any sector where the \nrestrictive policies in place before the formation of \nthe RTA hindered trade, as could well be the case \nif a quantitative approach were used (see WTO \nCompendium of Issues Related to RTAs).\n\n25  For example, the European Community\u2013European Free \nTrade Agreeent(EC-EFTA) FTA and the EC-Israel FTA \naccord included only manufactured goods.\n\n26  Even before the FTA negotiations are concluded, some \ncountries already provide and implement immediate \ntariff reduction or partial tariff reduction in the form \nof \u201cearly harvest schemes\u201d for selected products.\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\nupon the FTA\u2019s entry into force;  \n(ii) gradual and straight-line reduction \nor elimination thereof; (iii) substantial \nelimination in the first year, followed \nby gradual elimination or reduction \n(particularly for sensitive products); or \n(iv) an initial grace period of several years, \nfollowed by elimination of tariffs. 27 \nIn most FTAs entered into by the \nmember countries of the ASEAN, tariff \nelimination follows certain modalities like \nthe normal- and sensitive-track approach. \nIn the case of the Asia Pacific Trade \nAgreement (APTA), tariff concessions may \nbe negotiated (i) product by product,  \n(ii) across the board, or (iii) for each \nsector. Concurrently, special concessions \nmay be further granted to least-developed \ncountries (LDCs) participating in the \npreferential arrangements (with respect to \nphasing or tariff elimination schedule and \nrates). Under the bilateral FTA between \nThailand and New Zealand, some goods \nwere freed when the FTA took effect, \nwhile other tariffs are to be eliminated \neither through progressive reduction or \nthrough immediate zeroing after a period \nin which duties are kept constant. \n\nProduct coverage \n\nSuccess in negotiation requires each \npartner to be prepared to accept increased \nimports of many types of goods. Thus, \nfrom the standpoint of the negotiation, \nsuccess is most likely when the partners \ndo not hope to expand exports in the \nsame industries, i.e., when the partners \ndiffer in comparative advantage products, \ngiving rise to trade patterns such as \nthe exchange of manufactured goods \nfor agricultural products (interindustry \ntrade), as in the case of the Republic of \nKorea and Chile. However, trade between \ntwo partners may expand even if their \nexports fall in the same broad category as \n\n27  See METI (2007) and Lee et al. (2006).\n\nlong as the partners specialize in different \nsegments of that category, as in the \nexchange of small gas-efficient vehicles \nfor luxury high-performance vehicles \n(intra-industry trade). Intra-industry \ntrade may also occur at successive stages \nof the value chain, as in the exchange of \ncomputer disk drives or semiconductors \nfor assembled computers.\n\nAlthough exceptions to free trade or \nslower phase-in for tariff cuts may help \novercome political opposition to an \nagreement that is beneficial overall, these \ntactics should be used sparingly. Cutting \nor eliminating tariffs on some goods at \na faster rate may actually raise rather \nthan reduce the amount of protection \nenjoyed by a domestic industry (\u201ceffective \nprotection\u201d of a productive activity 28 ). \nFor example, reducing the tariff on cotton \ncloth more slowly than the tariff on raw \ncotton will increase the protection of \ncotton cloth production during the phase-\nin period. To the extent that the goal of \nthe FTA is to increase exposure to world \nmarket forces at a manageable rate, \nthe effect is exactly the opposite of the \npolicy\u2019s goal. However, GATT Article XXIV \ndoes not require tariff elimination on the \ndate when the agreement takes effect, \nand most agreements allow tariffs and \nother barriers to be eliminated in stages. \nIn such a case, the provisions of the \nagreement must specify the schedule for \ntariff reductions. Policy makers, therefore, \nneed to be aware of this phase-in problem \n\n28  The effective rate of protection (ERP) measures the \n\nextent to which the overall structure of protection on \ngoods raises the value added of a specific industrial \nactivity relative to free trade. The ERP rises with the \ntariff rate on the activity\u2019s output but falls with the \ntariff rate on the activity\u2019s purchased intermediate \ninputs. If inputs are used in fixed proportions, the ERP \nfor the activity that produces good j expressed as a \nfraction of value added under free trade is given by: \n \n  (VT \u2212 VFT) / VFT = ( tj \u2212 \u2211aijti) / ( 1 \u2212 \u2211aij), \nwhere VT and VFT are value-added in production of \ngood j under the current tariff structure and under \nfree trade, the a --\u2019s are the shares of each input i in \nthe total cost of producing good j, and the t \u2019s are the \ntariff rates on each good.\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nand the potential (short-run) distortions \nin productive incentives.\n\nPhase-in period \n\nAs noted above, the time allowed for \nphasing in often differs across product \ngroups, with extra time allowed for \nsensitive products that are not excluded \nfrom preferential treatment. In the \nRepublic of Korea\u2013Chile FTA, some tariffs \nwere eliminated immediately, while a \nphase-in period of up to 16 years was \nallowed for a few sensitive products. \nThe NAFTA included phase-in times of \nup to 15 years. Such delays would be \nthe exception in principle, given the \n1994 Understanding, which insists on \na 10-year maximum except in special \ncases. Under the US-Singapore FTA, each \nparty eliminated customs duties on all \noriginating goods of the other party when \nthe agreement entered into force, but \nwill reduce the customs duties on some \nproducts under the US tariff lines over 4, \n8, or 10 years, depending on the product. \nThe Enabling Clause allows an even \nlonger phase-in period for FTA members \nclassified as developing countries. The \nAFTA, as well as the ASEAN-plus FTAs \nwith the PRC and the Republic of Korea \n(which were notified, or are to be \nnotified, under the Enabling Clause), \nclassifies the tariff items according to \ntheir sensitivities under the normal- and \nsensitive-track approaches. Under the \nnormal-track approach, some tariffs are \neliminated when the agreement takes \neffect and some others are eliminated \nwithin specified time frames. Under the \nsensitive track, on the other hand, items \nprotected or exempted by the member \ncountries are classified into sensitive or \nhighly sensitive lists. In the New Zealand\u2013\nThailand Closer Economic Partnership \nAgreement (New Zealand\u2013Thailand \nCEPA), no overall implementation period \nis explicitly provided, but the schedule \n\nof tariff elimination is up to 20 years for \nThailand and 10 years for New Zealand. \nMembers should keep in mind that a \nlonger phase-in period means a longer \nwait until the full benefits of the FTA can \nbe achieved, and, of course, differences in \nphase-in rates across goods may lead  \nto inappropriate increases in some \neffective protection rates. Like the case of \nThailand\u2019s FTAs with Australia and New \nZealand, the FTAs may provide further \nthat the elimination of customs duties may \nbe accelerated unilaterally or as a result of \nconsultations requested by either party, to \nprovide flexibility in the tariff concessions \nof the FTA.\n\nThe Harmonized System \n\nSince each country is likely to trade \nhundreds or even thousands of different \nproducts, negotiations on tariff \nelimination typically identify goods \naccording to the Harmonized Commodity \nDescription and Coding System, usually \ncalled the Harmonized System (HS). This \nis an internationally standardized method \nof classification developed by the World \nCustoms Organization (WCO). 29 Broad \ncategories of goods are first divided into \nsections, then into 97 chapters denoted by \ntwo digits, and then subheadings denoted \nby four or six digits. For example, Section \nII (vegetable products) covers Chapters 6\u2013\n14. Chapter 10 (cereals) is further divided \ninto four-digit subheadings that include \n10.06 (rice) and then into four separate \nsix-digit subheadings that include 1006.20 \n(husked rice). Some countries expand this \nsystem to eight or more digits. However, \ndifferences in treatment of goods within a \ngiven broad category should be kept to a \nminimum to prevent inefficiencies due to \nthe diversion of trade across subcategories \nor increases in effective protection rates. \n\n29  www.wcoomd.org/ie/en/topics_issues/\nharmonizedsystem/DocumentDB/\nTABLE%20OF%20CONTENTS.html\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00187\n\nPositive-list or negative-list approach \n\nA positive-list approach to trade in goods \nenumerates specific tariff items to be \nincluded in the liberalization schedule, \nwhile a negative-list approach identifies \nselected tariff items to be excluded from \nnegotiations for preferential tariffs. Most \nFTAs between developed and developing \ncountries adopt a positive-list approach. \nFor instance, the New Zealand\u2013Thailand \nCEPA takes a positive-list approach. Tariff \nelimination schedules are then set item \nby item. However, since an FTA must \ncover substantially all trade, it is more \nconvenient, though not popular, to use the \nnegative-list approach. \n\nWhich tariff rates? \n\nPreferential tariffs are negotiated from \ncertain base rates, which usually are \nthe MFN tariff rates of the negotiating \nparties. A procedural question regarding \ntariff rates in negotiations relates to \nwhether negotiations should take as a \nstarting point the current applied rates \nor the often higher bound rates of the \nparticipating countries (assuming the \ncountry does indeed bind its tariffs). 30 \nIn order For real liberalization to begin \nas soon as the agreement takes effect, \ncurrent applied rates are the appropriate \nstarting point. But where current applied \nrates are already very low, negotiations \ncould focus on binding rates at similarly \nlow levels. Singapore began negotiating \nthe US-Singapore FTA with applied tariffs \nof zero on most of its imports but agreed \nto reduce bound rates to zero as well.\nAnother potential area of confusion \nis whether a country\u2019s rates are applied \n\n30  Applied rates are those currently in use, while bound \nrates are the maximum rates to which WTO members \nhave committed themselves in accession agreements \nor multilateral negotiations. Thus, countries may \nraise their applied rates unilaterally without violating \ntheir WTO obligations if bound rates are higher than \napplied rates.\n\nto the \u201cfree on board\u201d (FOB) value of \nimports or, as is more usual, to the cost, \ninsurance, and freight (CIF) value. In \nthe latter case, an ad valorem tariff rate \nis applied to the value of insurance and \ntransportation costs, as well as to the cost \nof the goods themselves. \n\nTreatment of sensitive Products\n\nBecause of the very large number of tariff \nlines to be included in an FTA negotiation, \nbroad liberalization principles are \ntypically applied to most goods. For \nexample, negotiators may agree that all \ntariffs already below a certain level will \nbe reduced immediately to zero when \nthe agreement takes effect. However, the \nparticipants in any trade liberalization \nnegotiation must take into account the \nexistence of \u201csensitive products,\u201d for \nwhich immediate adjustment or even \nadjustment at the rate allowed for most \ngoods would cause severe problems in \na particular sector or region. Such a \ndisruption could cause harsh political and \neconomic problems, at least in the short \nrun. These goods would be exempted \nfrom the broad liberalization principles \napplied to most trade between the \npartners.\n\nIn the interest of transparency, each \npartner begins negotiations by presenting \na preliminary list of sensitive products. \nSince WTO rules require an FTA to \neliminate tariffs on substantially all \ntraded goods, these sensitive products \nmust be strictly limited in both number of \ntariff lines and total value. 31 The impact \nof liberalization on domestic producers \nof sensitive products may be mitigated by \na later start to tariff cuts and extra time \n\n31  A small value of current trade may not be relevant \n\nbecause sensitive sectors are usually highly protected. \nThus, the current trade value may be very low or even \nzero.\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nallowed for tariffs to be eliminated. 32 The \nprotocol for special treatment of sensitive \nproducts in ASEAN\u2019s Common Effective \nPreferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme 33 \nincludes flexibility in the starting date \nof the phase-in process, with a later \nstarting date and longer phase-in period \nfor LDC members; rules for ongoing \ntariff cuts, with no rate change applied \nfor more than 3 years, a reduction of \nat least 10 percentage points at each \nadjustment, and a final tariff rate of no \nmore than 5%; and scheduled elimination \nof all quantitative restrictions and other \nnontariff barriers.\n\nImports of sensitive products are often \n\nrestricted by a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) \nrather than a simple ad valorem tariff. \nUnder a TRQ, imports up to a stipulated \nceiling may enter at one tariff rate, while \nadditional imports beyond that ceiling \nare subject to a higher rate. During the \nphase-in period for such goods, scheduled \ncommitments should include gradual \nincreases in the size of the lower-rate \nquota, as well as reductions in the tariff \nrates themselves. If tariff quotas are \nmaintained, the agreement should be clear \non how the lower-rate quota will be filled. \nAn efficient option is for transferable \nimport licenses to be distributed through \na scheme that bases initial allocations on \nhistorical market shares. \n\nFor sensitive agricultural products, \nthe applicable MFN tariff rate may be \nseasonal, with a higher rate applied \nduring the part of the year when imports \ncompete with a like product grown \ndomestically. For example, the US, \nCanada, and Mexico all charge higher \n\n32  Because many goods are produced out of parts or \n\nintermediates imported from outside the FTA partner \ncountries, the provisions include rules of origin \n(ROOs) that determine whether these goods are \neligible for the preferential treatment (see the Rules of \nOrigin section in this chapter on page 49). In practice, \nrestrictive rules of origin for particular products are \nalso used to limit the impact on sensitive sectors.\n33  ASEAN Protocol on the Special Arrangement for \n\nSensitive and Highly Sensitive Products, Singapore, 30 \nSeptember 1999.\n\nseasonal rates on imports of some fresh \nagricultural products like tomatoes. \nUnder NAFTA, the tariffs on out-of-season \ntomatoes were phased out over 5 years; \ntariffs on in-season tomatoes were phased \nout over 10 years, with a tariff quota in \neffect during the transition period.\n\nTrade facilitation\n\nNontariff market access provisions are \ngaining wide attention in negotiations \n(multilaterally and bilaterally) and have \nbecome as significant as negotiations \non tariff-related provisions. This is \nbecause customs procedures and other \nadministrative hurdles can themselves \nbe significant barriers to trade. To \nbegin with, potential exporters and \nimporters need information on their \ncountries of origin and their partners\u2019 \nlaws and procedures that affect trade. \nAnd when trade is between FTA partners \n(or involves other kinds of preferential \narrangements), compliance with rules \nof origin usually involves additional \nadministrative procedures beyond those \nordinarily required in trade transactions, \ne.g., detailed production information in a \nspecific format. Compliance with customs \nregulations requires time and effort, but \nbasing procedures on best practices will \nlead to efficiency and reduced transaction \ncosts. In a narrow sense, trade facilitation \nmeans applying customs procedures \npredictably, consistently, and transparently, \nby improving access to information and \nreducing the cost of complying with \nadministrative procedures. In broader \nterms, trade facilitation includes reducing \nbehind-the-border costs from inadequate \nor inefficient transportation, logistics, and \nstorage facilities.\n\nMultilateral negotiations \n\nMultilateral negotiations on trade \nfacilitation are aimed at simplifying \ncross-border procedures and increasing \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00189\n\nthe capacity of developing countries to \nparticipate in the global trade. Trade \nfacilitation in the WTO context refers \nto \u201csimplification and harmonization of \ninternational trade procedures including the \nactivities, practices and formalities involved \nin collecting, presenting, communicating \nand processing data and other information \nrequired for the movement of goods in \ninternational trade.\u201d The focus is thus \nprimarily on reducing the administrative \ncosts 34 associated with trade.\n\nThe WTO Ministerial Conference in \nSingapore in 1996 requested the WTO \nGoods Council to begin exploratory work \nto simplify trade procedures. Negotiations \nin the WTO on trade facilitation began \nin 2004. 35 The negotiations are intended \nto \u201cclarify and improve relevant aspects \nof Articles V (transit of goods), VIII (fees \nand formalities affecting imports), and X \n(publication and administration of trade \nregulations) of GATT 1994 with a view to \nfacilitating trade among the members. 36 \nSince then, a number of trade facilitation \nmeasures have been proposed by WTO \nmembers. 37 \n\nNegotiators also examine ways of \n\nproviding technical assistance and \nsupport for capacity building, taking \ninto account the differences in levels of \ndevelopment among WTO members. This \nis being explicitly discussed at the Doha \nDevelopment Agenda under \u201caid for trade.\u201d\n\n34  These costs include compliance with rules-of-origin \nprocedures discussed in detail in the Rules of Origin \nsection of this chapter.\n\n35  The mandate for trade facilitation negotiations is set \nout in Annex D (Modalities for Negotiations on Trade \nFacilitation) of the July Package.\n\n36  www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tradfa_e/tradfa_\n\nnegoti_e.htm\n\n37  The proposals involve (i) the publication and \n\navailability of information; (ii) the time period between \npublication and implementation; (iii) consultation and \ncommenting on new and amended rules; (iv) advance \nrulings; (v) appeal procedures; (vi) measures enhancing \nimpartiality, nondiscrimination, and transparency; \n(vii) fees and charges connected with importation \nand exportation; (viii) formalities connected with \nimportation and exportation; (ix) consularization; \n(x) border-agency coordination; (xi) the release and \nclearance of goods; (xii) tariff classifications; and (xiii) \nmatters relating to goods transit.\n\nTrade facilitation provisions of FTAs\n\nTrade facilitation provisions may be part \nof the general principles, a section of \nthe customs procedures chapter, or an \nindependent chapter in FTAs. They often \nspecify measures, for example, simplified \nrequirements for documentation and \nmethods of determining compliance \nwith rules of origin (see the Rules of \nOrigin section on page 49). These trade \nfacilitation measures may be general or \nspecific\u2014depending on factors like the \ncoverage of the FTA, geographic situation, \nand institutional and technical capacity.\nWhile the Agreement of the Bay of \nBengal Initiative for Multisectoral Techno-\nEconomic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) \ndoes not specifically provide for trade \nfacilitation, it nevertheless suggests \nthe establishment of rules-of-origin \nmechanisms and the simplification \nof import and export formalities. In \nthe case of the South Asia Free Trade \nAgreement, provisions call for the prompt \npublication of rules and regulations, the \nidentification of \u201cinquiry points\u201d for the \nexchange of information, consultations \non rules of origin, electronic means \nof reporting and the identification of \nlow-risk and high-risk goods, customs \ncooperation, and technical assistance \nfor LDCs. 38 Meanwhile, the CEPT \nAgreement for AFTA provides that \n\u201cMember States shall explore further \nmeasures on border and non-border \nareas of cooperation to supplement and \ncomplement the liberalisation of trade.\u201d \nSince then, the ASEAN members have \nagreed to implement a Harmonized Tariff \nNomenclature as well as to establish and \nimplement the ASEAN Single Window \nto expedite customs clearance through \nsingle submission of information, \ndocuments, and formalities, single \nprocessing, and single decision making.\n\n38  See Chaturvedi (2007) for the detailed stocktaking of \n\ntrade facilitation provisions in South Asia FTAs.\n\n\f\u00180\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nThe trade facilitation provisions also \ndiffer even for the same bilateral partner. \nFor example, Japan\u2019s bilateral agreements, \non one hand, include commitments \nto facilitate the transport of goods, \nprovide exporters and importers with \ninformation regarding requirements for \ndocumentation, increase transparency, \nand build capacity through training, \ntechnical assistance, and exchange of \nexperts. Agreements like the Japan-\nSingapore, Japan-Philippines, and \nJapan-Thailand Economic Partnership \nAgreements (EPAs), on the other hand, \nprovide further commitments to improve \nthe speed and efficiency of customs \nprocedures through \u201cpaperless trading.\u201d \n\nEvolution of best practices  \nin trade facilitation\n\nExisting mechanisms and instruments 39  \ncan provide for best practices in \ntrade facilitation. A case in point is \nthe International Convention on the \nSimplification and Harmonization of \nCustoms Procedures (now commonly \nreferred to as the Revised Kyoto \nConvention). The principles of the \nconvention are explicitly recognized by \nnegotiators of the WTO and are being \nincorporated in FTAs. 40 The Asia Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation (APEC) member \ncountries have also adopted the Trade \nFacilitation Principles (applicable to both \ngoods and services), namely: 41\n\n(i)  Transparency; \n(ii)  Communication and consultation; \n(iii)  Simplification, predictability, and \n\nefficiency; \n\n(iv)  Nondiscrimination;\n\n39  The World Customs Organization (WCO) website (www.\nwcoomd.org/home_about_us_conventionslist.htm) lists \nand contains the text of these instruments.\n\n40  See for example, Chapter 4 of the Singapore-Australia \n\nFree Trade Agreement.\n\n41  See www.apec.org/apec/ministerial_statements/\n\nsectoral_ministerial/trade/2001_trade/annex_b.html\n\n(v)  Consistency and predictability; \n(vi)  Harmonization, standardization, \n\nand recognition;\n\n(vii)  Modernization and use of new \n\ntechnology; \n(viii) Due process; and \n(ix)  Cooperation.\n\nSome of these principles have been \n\nintroduced in a number of FTAs: \n\n(i)\t Customs\tcooperation.\t Cooperation \nis promoted between customs \nauthorities of FTA partners. It \nmay take the form of exchange \nof information such as customs \nlaws and procedures (especially \nfor new and amended customs \nrules); establishment of joint \ncommittees to discuss and address \ntrade facilitation issues; mutual \nadministrative assistance and \nexchange of experts; and common \ncustoms declaration and joint \ncustoms control at borders. \n(ii)\t Release\tof\tgoods.\t Principles like \n\nsimplification and standardization \nof procedures, risk management, \nand post-clearance audit allow \ncustoms to ensure the smooth and \nspeedy flow of goods. Simplified \nprocedures reduce formalities \nand documentation requirements \nto the minimum extent, aligned \nwith international standards. Risk \nmanagement involves the selective \ninspection of traded goods on a \nscientific basis. Post-entry audit \nallows goods to be released first \nand documents reviewed, thereby \nreducing the transaction costs of \nphysical examination at borders. \n\n(iii)\t Advance\trulings.\t Also called \n\n\u201cbinding rulings,\u201d these are issued \nat the request of an exporter or \nimporter to customs authorities \nto issue a decision relevant \nto the application of customs \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00181\n\nprocedures. Determining the \ntariff classification, customs \nvaluation, and applicable duties \nand taxes on certain products, for \nexample, would reduce clearance \nformalities and speed up the \nrelease of goods. \n(iv)\t Use\tof\tinformation\tand\t\n\ncommunication\ttechnology\t(ICT)\t\nand\tpaperless\ttrading.\t Modern trade \nfacilitation measures like the use \nof electronic filing and the transfer \nof trade-related information and \nelectronic versions of bills of \nlading, invoices, letters of credit, \nand insurance certificates (a form \nof electronic data exchange) \nare alternatives to paper-based \nmethods that enhance the \nefficiency of trade by reducing the \ncost and time involved. Although \nICT is not indispensable, it \nfacilitates the implementation of \na \u201csingle window\u201d 42 in customs \nprocedures. \n\nin\ttransit.\t Most FTAs involving \nlandlocked countries provide \nfor simplified procedures for the \ntemporary admission of goods in \ntransit. 43 Other FTAs (like those of \nJapan) provide for the application \nof existing customs conventions, 44 \nas well as Article V of GATT. \nThe effective implementation of \n\n(v)\t Temporary\tadmission\tof\tgoods\t\n\n42  A single window is commonly defined as \u201ca facility \nthat allows parties involved in trade and transport \nto lodge standardized information and documents \nwith a single entry point to fulfil all import, export, \nand transit-related regulatory requirements.\u201d \n(United Nations Economic Commission for Europe \nRecommendation on Establishing a Single Window: \nRecommendation 33, ECE/TRADE/352)\n\n43  For example, the Kyrgyz-Kazakhstan FTA states that a \n\u201cParty shall provide free transit via its territory, of goods \noriginating in the customs territory of the other Party or \nthird countries and intended for the customs territory of \nthe other Party or a third country.\u201d (Article 10, para. 2)\n44  Such as the Customs Convention on the ATA Carnet for \nthe Temporary Admission of Goods (ATA Convention) \nand the Convention on the International Transport of \nGoods under Cover of TIR Carnets (TIR Convention).\n\nthese transit agreements requires \npartnership between government \nauthorities, particularly customs \nand transport associations.\n(vi)\t Technical\tassistance\tand\tcapacity\t\nbuilding.\t Trade facilitation \nmeasures must be relevant and  \nmust take into account the \nresource constraints and needs \nof smaller countries that are \nparties to FTAs. As part of the \naid-for-trade agenda, developed \ncountries could provide funding \nand technical support 45 for the \nimplementation of multilateral \nor bilateral trade facilitation \nprograms. \n\nTechnical Barriers to Trade, and sanitary \nand Phytosanitary standards\n\nRegulations and standards often \nserve legitimate objectives including \nthe protection of the environment; \nconsumers; workers; national security; \nhuman, animal, and plant life or \nhealth; and the food and water supply. \nNevertheless, regulations and standards \nalso have a darker side\u2014they may be \nemployed as barriers to international \ntrade. As tariffs have fallen, regulations \nhave increasingly been used as nontariff \nbarriers to protect domestic producers. \nTwo WTO agreements\u2014the Agreement \non Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT \nAgreement) and the Agreement on \nSanitary and Phytosanitary Measures \n(SPS Agreement), seek to balance the \nprotection of legitimate objectives with \nthe need to restrain nontariff barriers to \nprevent protectionism.

Legitimate \nobjectives for TBT measures include the \nprotection of the environment, consumers \n(prevention of deceptive practices), \nworkers, national security, and human, \nanimal, and plant life and health. WTO \nmembers also apply TBT measures to \nensure quality and to encourage product \nstandardization. The TBT Agreement \napplies to \u201ctechnical regulations\u201d (which \nare mandatory), \u201cstandards\u201d (which are \nvoluntary), and \u201cconformity assessment \nprocedures\u201d (testing to verify whether \na product meets a particular technical \nregulation or standard). \n\nTBT measures relate to a product\u2019s \n\ncharacteristics, packaging, marking, \nlabeling, symbols, and terminology (among \nother aspects). A typical example of a \ntechnical regulation is a law requiring an \nautomobile dealer to display the vehicle\u2019s \nfuel efficiency. Compliance is mandatory\u2014\nthe dealer may not sell the vehicle unless \nits fuel efficiency is displayed. \n\nCompliance with a standard is \nvoluntary and often gives a product a \nmarketing advantage. A standard might \nset forth characteristics that a product \nmust meet before a government permits \nthe manufacturer to use a particular \nsymbol on the product\u2019s label. A typical \nexample would be rules governing the \nuse of a symbol showing that a product \nis recyclable. If the product can be sold \nwithout the symbol, the measure is a \nstandard and not a technical regulation. \nThe TBT Agreement establishes the \nfollowing disciplines, some of which are \nfamiliar from the GATT Agreement:\n\n\u2022\n\nNondiscrimination.\t WTO members \nmust ensure MFN treatment and \nnational treatment with respect to \ntechnical regulations, standards \n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nand conformity assessment \nprocedures.\nAvoidance\tof\tunnecessary\tobstacles\t\nto\ttrade.\t WTO members must \nensure that adopting or applying \ntechnical regulations, standards, \nand conformity assessment does \nnot create unnecessary obstacles \nto international trade. 46\nHarmonization.\t Members must \nbase technical regulations \nand standards on relevant \ninternational standards. 47 If \nresources permit, members must \nparticipate fully in the preparation \nof guides and recommendations \nfor conformity assessment \nby appropriate international \nstandardizing bodies.\nEquivalence.\t Members are \nencouraged to accept foreign \ntechnical regulations fulfilling \nthe same policy objectives, as \nequivalent.\nMutual\trecognition\tof\tconformity\t\nassessment\tprocedures.\t Members \nmust accept, whenever possible, \nthe results of foreign conformity \nassessments, even when the \nprocedures differ from their own, \nprovided they are satisfied that \nthe procedures offer assurance \nof conformity with technical \nregulations and standards \nequivalent to their own.\nTransparency.\t Members must \nprovide information about \nproposed and adopted technical \nregulations, standards, and \nconformity assessment procedures \nthrough inquiry points, \npublication, notification, etc. \n\n46  The measures should be the least trade-restrictive \n\nmeasures reasonably available to fulfill a legitimate \nobjective.\n\n47  An exception exists when international standards \n\nwould be ineffective or inappropriate, for example, \nwhen fundamental climatic and geographic factors or \nfundamental technological problems make reliance on \nsuch standards inappropriate.\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\n\u2022\n\nTechnical\tassistance.\t Upon request, \nmembers are required to provide \ntechnical assistance on mutually \nagreed terms. \n\nThe SPS Agreement\n\nThe purpose of the SPS Agreement is to \nensure that food and beverages are safe for \nhuman and animal consumption (safe from \npesticide residues, additives, toxins, etc.), \nand to prevent the spread of pests and \ndiseases (bacteria, viruses, invasive species, \netc.) among humans, animals, and plants, \nwhile at the same time ensuring that \nWTO members do not use SPS measures \nas disguised restrictions on international \ntrade. Typical examples of SPS \nmeasures are slaughterhouse inspection \nrequirements, quarantine requirements for \nsick animals, and pesticide and herbicide \nresidue requirements. \n\nThe SPS Agreement grants all WTO \n\nmembers the right to implement SPS \nmeasures to protect human, animal, \nor plant life or health from SPS risks \nprovided that the members comply with \nthe disciplines set forth in the Agreement. \nMembers that comply with the obligations \nof the SPS Agreement are presumed to \nbe in compliance with the obligations of \nGATT 1994, including its Article XX(b). 48\nUnlike the TBT Agreement, the SPS \n\nAgreement does not classify trade \nmeasures as technical regulations, \nstandards, or conformity assessment \nprocedures. SPS measures nevertheless \nfunction like technical regulations\u2014to the \nextent that compliance with SPS measures \nmay be necessary to import or sell a \nparticular product. Some provisions of \nthe SPS and TBT Agreements are similar. \nThe most important provisions of the SPS \nAgreement are the following:\n\n(i)\t\n\nScience-based\tagreement.\t The \nSPS Agreement is a science-\nbased agreement; hence, SPS \nmeasures must be based on \nsufficient scientific evidence and \non risk assessment. Precautionary \nmeasures must also be based on \nsome degree of scientific evidence. \n(The science-based nature of the \nSPS Agreement distinguishes it \nfrom the TBT Agreement.)\n(ii)\t Necessity.\t SPS measures must \n\nbe necessary to protect human, \nanimal, or plant life or health \n(they must be the least trade-\nrestrictive measures reasonably \navailable to achieve the desired \nlevel of risk prevention). 49\n(iii)\t No\tarbitrary\tor\tunjustifiable\t\n\ndiscrimination.\t SPS measures \nmust not result in arbitrary or \nunjustifiable discrimination \nbetween countries with identical \nor similar conditions. Measures \nmust not be disguised restrictions \non international trade.\n(iv)\t Harmonization.\t SPS measures \n\nmust be based on international \nstandards, guidelines, and \nrecommendations where they \nexist, unless there is scientific \njustification based on appropriate \nrisk assessment to use a higher \nstandard.\n\n(v)\t Equivalence.\t Members should \n\naccept as equivalent foreign SPS \nmeasures that provide the same \nlevel of protection. \n\n(vi)\t Transparency.\t Members must \n\nprovide information about their \nSPS measures through inquiry \npoints, publication, notification, \netc.\n\n(vii)\t Technical\tassistance.\t WTO members \nhave agreed to facilitate the \n\n48  Article XX(b) provides a general exception for trade \n\nmeasures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant \nlife or health. Some sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) \ndisciplines resemble those in the technical barriers to \ntrade (TBT) agreement.\n\n49  Members must recognize the concept of disease-free or \npest-free areas, and the possibility that the prevalence \nof pests and diseases could vary depending on \ngeography, ecosystems, etc.\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nprovision of technical assistance \nto other members, in particular \ndeveloping countries.\n\nTreatment of SPS and TBT measures in FTAs\n\nUnlike customs unions, in which members \ngenerally harmonize SPS and TBT rules, \nFTAs have no single practice for the \ntreatment of these regulatory matters. \nBecause of the sensitivity of agricultural \nand food safety issues, many FTAs contain \nfew SPS provisions and leave it up to the \nparties to apply the SPS agreement. 50 \nWith respect to TBT matters, FTAs often \ncontain stricter disciplines than those \nfound in the TBT agreement. \n\nFTAs take several different approaches \n\nwith respect to regulatory matters, in \nparticular TBT. Some FTAs acknowledge \nthe parties\u2019 WTO obligations but create \ncommittees only to study SPS and \nTBT problems. Other FTAs are moving \nslowly toward mutual recognition of \nconformity assessment procedures. A \nthird variant fosters greater integration \nby harmonizing certain regulations, \nrecognizing measures in various sectors \nas equivalent, and providing for a degree \nof mutual recognition of conformity \nassessment procedures\u2014often on a \nsectoral basis. Regardless of the approach \ntaken, the starting point in FTAs is \nusually recognition that the parties\u2019 WTO \ncommitments remain binding. The WTO \nAgreement thus serves as the lowest \ncommon denominator of commitments in \nFTA agreements. The following examples \nillustrate how SPS and TBT measures are \nhandled in selected FTAs. \n\nAgreements to Strengthen Cooperation \nand to Negotiate.  ASEAN\u2019s 2002 \nFramework Agreement with the PRC \nreaffirms relevant WTO commitments, \nand provides for strengthened \n\n50  This assumes that the parties are WTO members.\n\ncooperation with respect to trade in \ngoods by negotiating nontariff measures, \nscientifically unjustifiable SPS measures, \nand TBT measures. 51\n\nWTO as a Basis for Agreement to \nNegotiate.  The New Zealand\u2013Thailand \nFTA reiterates the parties\u2019 WTO \ncommitments with respect to nontariff \nbarriers, and more specifically with \nrespect to SPS and TBT measures. 52 \nThe FTA endorses equivalence, \nharmonization, and mutual recognition, \nand sets up a joint SPS committee \nto encourage consultations and \nnegotiations. It establishes a framework \nfor addressing SPS and TBT issues, and \nfor negotiating additional arrangements \nand annexes. 53 \n\nGeneral Reaffirmation of the \nWTO Agreement with Enhanced \nCooperation.  The US-Singapore Free \nTrade Agreement (USSFTA) reaffirms \nthe parties\u2019 WTO commitments and their \nshared commitment to facilitate bilateral \ntrade by reducing or removing technical \nand SPS barriers to the movement of \ngoods between the parties. 54 In Chapter 6  \nthe parties establish an enhanced \ncooperation and coordination procedure \nfor dealing with TBT issues. 55 The FTA  \n \n\n51  See Articles 3.8(e) and 7.3(a), Framework Agreement \non Comprehensive Economic Co-operation between \nASEAN and the People\u2019s Republic of China (Phnom \nPenh, 5 November 2002) (www.aseansec.org/13196.\nhtm). This agreement builds on the ASEAN-PRC FTA \nsigned on 6 November 2001. The goal of the parties is \nto create a free trade area by 2010.\n\n52  See Articles 2.7 (nontariff measures), 6.4.1 (SPS \nagreement), and 7.3.3 (TBT agreement) of the \nThailand\u2013New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership \nAgreement (www.thaifta.com/english/index_eng.\nhtml).\n\n53  See generally Chapters 6 and 7.\n54  See www.iesingapore.gov.sg\n55  See page 1 of the introduction to the US-Singapore \n\nFree Trade Agreement, www.iesingapore.gov.sg/wps/\nwcm/connect/resources/file/ebfe4f42743d685/FTA_\nUSSFTA_Agreement_Final.pdf?MOD=AJPERES.

ASEAN members have \nperiodically selected sectors for \nharmonization. They agreed to harmonize \nstandards in 20 priority product sectors in \n1997 and completed the process in 2003. \nThey also agreed to harmonize electrical \nsafety standards for 71 additional \nproducts in 1999 and completed the \nprocess in 2004. 58 In 2003, the ASEAN \nmembers agreed to harmonize cosmetic \nstandards. 59\n\ncontains provisions on the equivalence \nof mandatory requirements (particularly \nin the sectoral annexes), 61 cooperative \nactivities in SPS matters, 62 and the \nnegotiation of improved conformity \nassessment procedures. 63 The agreement \nalso contains two important sectoral \nannexes providing for mutual recognition \nof food products and horticultural goods. \nThe sectoral annex on food products \nreaffirms WTO commitments under \nthe SPS and TBT Agreements and is \napplicable to certain standards relating to \nfood products exported from one party to \nthe other, and to conformity assessments \nof manufacturers or manufacturing \nprocesses of food products exported from \none party to the other. 64 The sectoral \nannex on horticultural goods reaffirms \nthe parties\u2019 obligations under the SPS \nAgreement, 65 and provides for mutual \nrecognition of certain phytosanitary \ncertificates. 66\n\nsafeguards, antidumping measures, and \ncountervailing duties\n\nBroad Mutual Recognition.  The \nSingapore-Australia Free Trade \nAgreement (SAFTA) builds on these \ncountries\u2019 February 2001 mutual \nrecognition arrangements for medicinal \nproducts, electrical and electronic \nequipment, and telecommunications \nequipment. It streamlines inspection \nand compliance procedures for certain \nproducts, and commits the parties to \nharmonize their technical regulations \nwith international standards. 60 SAFTA  \n \n\nWTO rules indicate when members \nmay apply \u201ctrade remedies\u201d\u2014\nsafeguards, antidumping measures, and \ncountervailing duties\u2014in response to \nspecified actions by trading partners. \nWhile some FTAs merely indicate  \ncompliance with the relevant GATT \narticles, others modify these rules as  \nthey apply to trade among themselves.  \nFor example, the Republic of Korea\u2013 \nChile FTA simply indicates consistency \nwith the standard WTO treatment of  \n \n\n56  Article 6.3.1.\n57  See Article 6.3.4 and Annex 6A of the US-Singapore \nFree Trade Agreement.

An FTA may specify additional \ndispute settlement processes beyond \nthose provided in the WTO through \nthe creation of a regional body for \nthis purpose (see Dispute Settlement \nMechanism section on page 92). Where \nthis is the case, the rules should establish \nwhich parties have standing to bring \na dispute to this body, i.e., whether \nindividuals, firms, or nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) as well as countries \nmay bring disputes for resolution. In the \nWTO, member countries are the only \nparties with such standing.\n\nGlobal safeguards\n\nGATT Article XIX authorizes members \nto use safeguard measures to provide \ntemporary protection for a domestic \nindustry when increased imports cause \nor threaten to cause serious injury \nto the industry. In contrast to the \nrules on antidumping measures and \ncountervailing duties (see pages 47 \nand 48), access to safeguard protection \ndoes not require evidence that exporters \nbenefited from unfair trade practices. \nThe inclusion in the WTO of safeguard \nprovisions, which basically allow \ncountries to raise protection in particular \nsectors, is justified in terms of two \nfunctions. First, by allowing a country to \npull back temporarily when liberalization \ncauses greater problems than anticipated \nfor domestic import-competing \nindustries, safeguards provide a form \nof insurance or safety net to countries \nmaking liberalization commitments. \nSecond, because internal political forces \nmay push a government to protect a \nparticular sector, safeguards offer a safety \nvalve for protectionist pressure and \nthus maintain the integrity of the larger \n\nrelationship. In practical terms, without \na safeguard provision, it would be far \nmore difficult to conclude substantive, \ncomprehensive trade agreements. The \nkey is to avoid abuse.\n\nDuring the GATT era, safeguard \nprotection under Article XIX was used \nonly rarely. Some countries (notably \nthe US and EC countries) applied \u201cgray \narea\u201d measures to deal with domestic \nadjustment problems. In cases including \nfootwear, autos, and steel, importing \ncountries negotiated \u201cvoluntary\u201d restraint \nagreements with newer and highly \ncompetitive exporters like Japan and the \nRepublic of Korea. The WTO Safeguards \nAgreement revived interest in safeguards \nby prohibiting the use of gray-area \nmeasures but also set a time limit for \nany safeguard action through a \u201csunset \nclause.\u201d However, because Article XIX \nrequires safeguard-imposing countries to \nprovide compensation to countries whose \nexports are restricted, most safeguards \nare eliminated before the required sunset \nreview of the measures. \n\nWhile some FTAs simply indicate \n\ncompliance with the relevant WTO rules \non safeguards, others modify these rules \nas they apply to trade among themselves. \nUnder Article XIX, these safeguards\u2014\nnow often called \u201cglobal\u201d safeguards \nto distinguish them from \u201cspecial\u201d \nsafeguards discussed below\u2014are to be \napplied on a nondiscriminatory basis, \ni.e., according to the MFN principle of \nthe WTO. But just as FTAs depart from \nMFN treatment in tariffs and other \ntrade barriers, they may accord each \nother special treatment in the case of \nsafeguards. For example, the Singapore\u2013\nNew Zealand agreement specifies \nthat neither party will take safeguard \nmeasures against goods originating in the \nother, i.e., the partner is to be exempted \nfrom any safeguard measure taken under \nArticle XIX. But, as noted earlier, the \nRepublic of Korea\u2013Chile FTA provides no \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00187\n\nspecial status for partners when applying \nsafeguard protection under Article XIX. \n\nThe justification for exempting \n\npartners is that the aim of an FTA is to \nachieve a single integrated market, and \nrestricting partner imports as tariffs are \nbeing eliminated is a step backward from \nachieving that goal. On the other hand, \nexempting FTA partners or other groups \n(often LDCs are exempted) means that \nthe remaining suppliers outside these \npreferred groups will be subject to an \neven larger reduction in access to the \nsafeguarded market, exacerbating the \ntrade diversion. This spillover effect \ncould thus give rise to frictions with other \nimportant trading partners.\n\nTransitional and special safeguards\n\nLike global safeguards, these \u201cspecial \nsafeguards\u201d permit access only when \nthere is evidence of serious injury \nor threat of serious injury caused by \nimports, i.e., there is no presumption \nthat exporters have violated WTO norms. \nWithin the WTO, this type of safeguard \nhas been associated with liberalization \nin a particular sector, e.g., the phase-out \nof the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, or with \nthe entry of a new member, e.g., the PRC. \nAn FTA sometimes includes a transitional \nsafeguard to provide a \u201csafety net\u201d in case \nthe effect of regional liberalization on an \nimport-competing sector is particularly \nsevere. The injury test would then \nrequire not only evidence of serious \ninjury linked to increased imports but \nalso partner imports accounting for a \nlarge part of the increase in imports. \nThe Taipei,China\u2013Panama and Thailand-\nAustralia FTAs both include transitional \nsafeguard provisions allowing the relevant \ntariff to be returned (\u201csnapped back\u201d) \nto the MFN level for a 2-year period to \nstart with. Special safeguards, where \nincluded, apply only to a particular sector, \noften certain agricultural products. For \n\nexample, NAFTA included not only a long \ntransitional period (15 years) for sensitive \nagricultural products but also special \nbilateral safeguards. These allowed the \ntariff facing a partner to be snapped back \nto the MFN level for a 3- or 4-year period \nin the case of actual or threatened serious \ninjury as well as a \u201csubstantial\u201d increase \nin imports from the partner.\n\nLike product exceptions and slower \nphase-in periods for sensitive products, \ntransitional and special safeguard \nprovisions help achieve acceptance by \ndomestic import-competing industries but \nalso reduce the likely benefits from the \nFTA once in force. Because safeguards, by \ntheir very availability, increase uncertainty \nabout the actual terms of market access, \nthey may reduce incentives for investors \nto make new commitments that help \npartners to expand trade along the lines \nof comparative advantage. \n\nAntidumping measures\n\nGATT Article VI and the Agreement \non Implementation of Article VI of the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n1994 (AD Agreement) allow countries \nto penalize imports sold in the domestic \nmarket \u201cat less than the normal value \nof the products\u201d when there is evidence \nthat these imports are causing \u201cmaterial\u201d \ninjury to the competing domestic industry. \nSince antidumping complaints are \nspecific to particular exporting firms in \na particular country, the rules represent \na departure from the principle of MFN \ntreatment. In cases where dumping \nis found, import restrictions may be \nenacted by levying a supplementary \ntariff (antidumping duty) based on the \ndifference between the import price \nand the normal value of goods from \nthis source, or by negotiating a \u201cprice \nundertaking\u201d with the exporter, i.e., \nan agreement to raise the price of the \nproduct to an acceptable level.\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nDumping occurs when the product is \nsold at a lower price than at home or at \na price below its cost of production, but \nneither criterion is straightforward in \nits application. Moreover, the economic \njustification for antidumping measures in \nthe absence of predation is at best weak; \nalmost all affirmative dumping cases \ninvolve pricing behavior that would be \nlegal when practiced by a firm located in \nthe domestic market. Many economists \nfeel that the main case for antidumping \npolicy is political rather than economic, \nand that the beneficiaries are largely firms \nreluctant to compete with lower-cost \nforeign producers. Moreover, in practice \nantidumping measures often serve as an \nattractive alternative to safeguard action. \nThe injury criterion is less stringent \n(material versus serious injury), and no \nadjustment plan for the domestic industry \nis required. Moreover, because the injury \nis attributed to unfair pricing on the \npart of an exporting firm, antidumping \nmeasures entail no compensation of \naffected exporters and no limit to the \nlength of time that the measures can stay \nin effect. 67\n\nAlthough many FTAs merely stipulate \n\nthat partners retain their rights and \nobligations under GATT Article VI and the \nAD Agreement, some offer more favorable \ntreatment to their FTA partners.  Since \nmost alleged dumping would be legal \nif the sale were carried out by a firm \nin the domestic market, this favorable \ntreatment is consistent with the goal of \ncreating an integrated market. Notably, \nEU members may not use antidumping \nmeasures against firms in partner \ncountries, though they may pursue \ncomplaints if EU competition policy is \n\n67  The Antidumping (AD) Agreement contains a \u201csunset\u201d \nrequirement establishing that dumping duties should \nbe applied for no more than 5 years unless a review \nindicates that removing the duty would be likely to lead \nto the continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury. \nThe sunset provision also applies to price undertakings.\n\nviolated. Australia\u2019s agreement with the \nUS contains no chapter on antidumping \nmeasures, implying that WTO rules apply \nwithout modification. Its agreements with \nSingapore and Thailand refer explicitly to \nArticle VI but impose additional limits on \nthe use of such measures.\n\nSubsidies and countervailing measures\n\nThe WTO Agreement on Subsidies and \nCountervailing Measures governs the \nuse of countervailing measures when \nanother country\u2019s subsidies cause injury \nto a domestic industry.  As in the case of \nantidumping measures, WTO policy on \nsubsidies allows a departure from MFN \ntreatment. Here, however, the source of \nthe injury to a domestic industry arises \nfrom a government\u2019s action to provide a \nsubsidy rather than an exporting firm\u2019s \npricing practices.\n\nUnder the subsidies agreement, \nsubsidies requiring recipients to meet \nspecified export targets or to use domestic \ninputs instead of imported inputs in \nproduction are prohibited because they \nare designed to distort international \ntrade. 68 Outside of agriculture, most \nexport subsidies violate current WTO \nrules and can be challenged in the WTO. 69 \nIf a prohibited subsidy is not removed, \nthe complaining country can impose \nan additional tariff (countervailing \nduty) based on the value of the subsidy \nprovided by the government of the \nexporting country. \n\nMost other subsidies are categorized \n\nas \u201cactionable.\u201d Here the complaining \ncountry must show that the subsidy is \n\n68  The prohibition on export subsidies does not apply \nto least-developed countries (LDCs) and developing \ncountries with per capita incomes below $1,000. \nDeveloping countries and transition economies are \ngiven extra time to eliminate export subsidies and \nsubsidies to import-substituting industries; LDCs are \nallowed an even longer period to comply.\n\n69  A goal of the Doha Development Agenda is to phase out \n\nsubsidies in agriculture as well.\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00189\n\ncausing an adverse effect on its interests \nby damaging (i) an import-competing \nindustry, (ii) an export industry that \ncompetes in the subsidizing country\u2019s \ndomestic market, or (iii) an export \nindustry competing with firms in the \nsubsidizing country for the same third-\ncountry markets. 70 Otherwise the subsidy \nis permitted. If a subsidy does have an \nadverse effect, it must be withdrawn \nor its adverse effect removed. Again, if \ndomestic producers are hurt by imports \nof subsidized products, a countervailing \nduty can be imposed. 71 Alternatively, the \nsubsidized exporter can raise the price of \nits products.\n\nMany FTAs have no provisions \nmodifying the treatment of subsidies \nprovided in the WTO. However, Australia\u2019s \nFTAs with Thailand and Singapore go \nfurther than the WTO, prohibiting even \nagricultural export subsidies. This is in \naccord with APEC best-practice principles, \nwhich call for FTAs that \u201cgo beyond \nWTO commitments\u201d by building on \nexisting WTO obligations and exploring \ncommitments in areas not yet fully \ncovered by the WTO. \n\nrules of origin\n\nRules of origin (ROOs) are a necessity \nin any preferential trade agreement, \nincluding all FTAs. Without ROOs it would \nbe impossible to distinguish products \nthat are eligible for tariff preferences \nfrom those that are not. Since FTAs \nallow members to set external tariffs \nindependently, rules of origin are needed \nto prevent the transshipment of imports \n\n70  An obvious example of this latter actionable subsidy \nwould be the US\u2019 (successful) complaint against \nthe EU for its subsidies of soybean exports to third \nmarkets.\n\n71  Developing countries receive preferential treatment \nif their exports

Several caveats arise in marine \nfisheries and ocean-bed mining, however. \nProducts obtained outside the territorial \nlimits of a coastal entity may gain the \norigin of the vessel or platform that is \nused to extract, capture, or otherwise \nobtain the product in question. 75\n\nFor manufactured and processed goods, \n\nthe determination of origin is more \ncomplex and controversial, particularly \nfor products with intermediate inputs and \nprocessing or manufacturing operations \ntaking place in two or more countries or \ncustoms territories. The Kyoto Convention \nof the Customs Cooperation Council \n(now known as the WCO) of 1973 set \nforth the principle of a \u201clast substantial \n\n75  Whether a territory is confined to the 12-mile limit or \nto the extended limit provided for in the Law of the \nSea is disputed. Whether the flag of the vessel or its \nactual ownership and control confers origin is also in \nquestion (Imagawa and Vermulst 2005).\n\ntransformation\u201d for determining product \norigin in the case of processed and \nmanufactured goods. Three types of tests \nwere agreed on as applicable in satisfying \n(potentially) the principle of a last \nsubstantial transformation. These are  \n(i) a change in tariff heading (CTH) test, \n(ii) a specified process (SP) test, and  \n(iii) an ad valorem or percentage test. \nThese tests and their permutations are \nshown in Table 2.2.\n\nexamples of alternative Tests for \nsubstantial Transformation\n\nA CTH test is used to determine origin \nif the manufacture or processing \nundertaken results in a product coming \nunder a four-digit HS number different \nfrom the numbers under which the non-\noriginating components or articles fall \n(Imagawa and Vermulst 2005: 607). For \nexample, country A imports raw leather \nhide from country B (HS 41.01) and uses \nit to produce tanned leather hide (HS \n41.06), which it then exports to country \nC. Country B is the origin of the product \nimported by country C. When the test \nis applied at the six-digit HS code this \nis known as a CTSH test. For example, \nunder the Canada-US Free Trade \nAgreement of 1989, tomato paste (HS \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\n2002.09) imported by Canada from Chile \nand used to produce catsup (HS 2103.20) \nthat is later exported to the US originates \nin Canada and receives preferential \ntreatment in the US. However, NAFTA \nadopted a rule of origin specifying that \ncatsup (HS 2103.20) obtains its origin \nwhen transformed from any six-digit HS \nchapter except from subheading 2002.09 \n(NAFTA Volume II, Annex 401-8, 1993). \nHence, Canada can no longer import \ntomato paste from a source outside \nNAFTA and receive preferential treatment \nunder NAFTA rules of origin. The \n13.6% US MFN tariff on tomato paste \nput Chilean tomato paste at a distinct \ndisadvantage versus Mexican tomato \npaste. 76\n\nThe ad valorem or percentage criterion \n\ntest may take place in any one of three \nforms (Imagawa and Vermulst 2005: \n605): import content, domestic/regional \ncontent, or value of parts. The test \nspecifies a maximum non-originating \ncontent or a minimum regional or \ndomestic content requirement as a \npercentage of the FOB or ex-factory \nprice of the product that must be \nreached if a product is to satisfy the last \nsubstantial transformation principle \nin the last territory where the product \nwas processed or manufactured. The \npercentage test may or may not allow \ncumulation among members, 77 but \nallowance of cumulation is clearly more \nliberal than its disallowance. In the \ncase of the Japan-Malaysia Economic \nPartnership Agreement (JMEPA), \n\n76  This example is originally cited in Vermulst, Waer, and \n\nBourgeois (1994).\n\n77  \u201cCumulation\u201d allows value added for a group of \n\ncountries rather than just in the exporting country. \nFor example, suppose that product A produced in \nSingapore uses 50% of its inputs from Malaysia. \nWhen exported to a country with which Singapore \nhas an FTA, allowance for ASEAN cumulation would \nsuggest that 100% of the content would be accepted \n(and, hence, the produce would certainly qualify \nfor preferential treatment), whereas with no ASEAN \ncumulation only 50% would qualify.\n\nthe following formula is applied in a \npercentage test:\n\nQVC = [(FOB\u2212VNM) / FOB)] * 100\n\nwhere: QVC is the \u201cqualifying value \ncontent\u201d of a good as a percentage of \nits FOB value of a good payable by \nthe buyer to the seller regardless of \nmeans of shipment (excluding taxes \nand duties), and VNM signifies the \n\u201cvalue of non-originating material\u201d \nused in the production of the good.\n\nOrigin\n\nJapan\n\nJapan\n\nmalaysia\n\nItem\n\npart\u2002a\n\npart\u2002b\n\npart\u2002C\n\npart\u2002d\n\npart\u2002e\n\nother\u2002Costs\n\nfob\u2002price\n\nindia\u2002(non-originating)\n\nrepublic\u2002of\u2002Korea\u2002\n(non-originating)\n\npart\u2002f\n\nprC\u2002(non-originating)\n\nCost($)\n\n100\n\n100\n\n400\n\n300\n\n500\n\n400\n\n200\n\n2,000\n\n$2,000\u2002\u2212\u2002$1,200\u2002(parts\u2002d,\u2002e,\u2002\nand\u2002f)\n\nQvC\u2002=\u2002\n\nx\u2002100\u2002=\u2002\u200240%\n\n$2,000\n\nIn the case of JMEPA, the QVC must \nbe 40% or greater for the item to attain \norigin in the region. JMEPA allows \nregional cumulation to reach the required \nminimum QVC percentage. An example \nof the application of this rule to a color-\ntelevision receiver is given as follows \n(JMEPA 2006: Operational Procedures):\nThus, according to the JMEPA rules \n\nof origin, the color TV is eligible for \npreferential tariff treatment.\n\nA technical or specified process \ntest rounds out the acceptable criteria \nunder the WCO Kyoto Convention. This \ntest provides a detailed description of \nproduction or sourcing processes that \ndo (positive test) or do not (negative \ntest) confer origin. In most cases, simple \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\npacking and unpacking operations are not \nsufficient to confer origin. Normally such \nnegative test criteria are accompanied by \na positive test to provide more certainty \nto businesses.\n\nA technical test is frequently applied \n\nto preferential agreements in textiles \nand apparel. For example, the Japanese \neconomic partnership agreements with \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and \nSingapore apply a \u201cdouble jump\u201d or \ntwo-stage processing test requiring that \napparel be produced either from fabric \nthat is first dyed or printed in a member \n(stage 1), and then assembled into an \narticle of apparel (stage 2). Alternatively, \nif originating yarn is used to produce \nfabric, then even if dyeing and printing \nprocesses are carried out in a nonmember, \nthe test is satisfied, provided that the \nfabric is also woven and assembled into \na garment article in a member country. \nThe double-jump requirement in Japan\u2019s \nagreements is applied in a way that is \nrather liberal in that the processes need \nnot be completed in only one country but \nmay occur in both members. Furthermore, \nJapan allows any process occurring within \nASEAN to count toward the double-\njump test (i.e., \u201ccumulative origin\u201d). For \nexample, if yarn from outside the region \nis woven into cotton cloth in Malaysia \nand the cloth is then cut and assembled \ninto garments in the Philippines, the \narticle becomes eligible for preferential \ntreatment.\n\nThere is no perfect or universal test \n\nfor determining the origin of a good \nproduced in two or more locations. \nFor this reason, it is important that \nagreements provide clear definitions of \nrules of origin and publish these rules. \nThe CTH or CTSH criterion must clearly \nspecify the HS chapter tariff headings \nor subheadings that are addressed by \nthe rule. The percentage or ad valorem \ncriterion must indicate the formula for \ncalculating the percentage of originating \n\nand non-originating material and clearly \ndefine the price being used as the \ndenominator. The SP or technical test \ncriterion must be based on a positive \nstandard and must precisely set out the \noperation that confers origin (negative \nstandards may be set out to clarify the \npositive standard). \n\nadministrative requirements \n\nIt is quite useful for an FTA to include \nan annex with examples and guides \nfor firms and traders. These may be set \nout in an operational manual on rules \nof origin containing illustrations and \npractical examples of the application \nof each type of test and any supporting \ndocumentation that the customs requires. \nThe manual should have specimens of the \nrequired documents, including certificates \nof origin. JMEPA provides a detailed \nannex with administrative procedures \nfor obtaining and completing certificates \nof origin (COOs) including procedural \nmatters with regard to administration \nand enforcement of ROOs. The annex \ngives detailed information on seven \nrules associated with COO modification \nand minor errors, loss, or theft, as well \nas related provisions with regard to \nshipments that may pass through a third \nparty. Four rules are also set forth to \nclarify administration and enforcement, \nincluding offices responsible, stamps and \nspecimens of signatures and stamps used \nby the administering authorities, offices \nresponsible for advance customs rulings, \nand matters pertaining to communication \nbetween responsible authorities. \n\nThe annex also contains appendixes \n\nwith specimens of the COOs and \ninstructions for completing the COO \nforms, examples of the calculation of the \npercentage of qualifying value content, \nand a clarification of product-specific \nROOs including de minimis provisions; \nexamples of documents required when \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nusing ASEAN cumulation provisions; \nand a description of operations for \ndyeing or printing processes for textiles \nand clothing items (HS 50\u201363). In \ngeneral, the inclusion of such a detailed \nannex on administrative aspects of \nROOs greatly increases transparency \nand facilitates the use of agreements by \nprivate enterprises.\n\nrules of origin for services \n\nFTAs are increasingly providing \npreferential access for commercial services \nin addition to goods. While there are no \ngenerally accepted principles or criteria \nfor identifying the origin of a service, six \ntypes of tests tend to be used: nationality \nof service provider or service-providing \nentity, residency test, value-added test, \nownership test, intellectual input control \ntest, and \u201cmixed\u201d tests. 78\n\nIn general, service agreements \n\n(notified under Article V of GATS) may \nextend preferences to any or all four \nmodes of supply of commercial services \n(see Trade in Services section below). \nThe ROOs for services would have to take \ninto account which of the four modes of \nsupply is relevant in the provision of the \nservice.\n\nSetting rules for determining the \ncountry of origin of an internationally \ntraded service is essential for the \nimplementation of an FTA notified under \nArticle V of GATS. To the extent that \ncountries demand reciprocity in extending \nMFN treatment to services (implying \ndiscriminatory barriers to countries \nnot providing reciprocal access to their \nmarkets 79 ), ROOs are again necessary. \nArticle II of GATS codifies unconditional \nMFN treatment but allows members \nto maintain discriminatory measures, \n\n78  This section draws on James (1998).\n79  This is known as \u201cconditional MFN treatment\u201d (Grey \n\n1990).\n\nprovided that these are listed and are \nconsistent with conditions set forth in the \nAnnex to Article II. \n\nThe principle of last substantial \n\ntransformation, which is used to provide \na basis for the tests used to determine \nthe origin of manufactured goods, \nis irrelevant to international service \ntransactions (Kingston 1994). This \nproblem results from the difficulty in \nevaluating the different components that \nmake up a service and the fact that the \nnationality of a service-providing firm or \nentity may not reflect the ownership and \ncontrol of the firm or entity.\n\nOf the six possible ways of \n\ndetermining the origin of a service \noutlined above, most countries adopt an \nROO based on residency or ownership \nand control of the service-providing \nentity or, in cases where establishment \nis unnecessary, on the control of \nthe essential input without which \nthe service cannot be provided. The \nlatter is simple in the case of services \nprovided by natural persons. In contrast, \ndetermining non-originating value added \nof a service is likely to be extremely \ndifficult. Similarly, if foreign investment \nis required to provide a service through \nestablishment, the origin rule by \nresidency test is rather straightforward. \nResidency is simply the place where the \nservice firm is incorporated, provided the \nfirm has a substantial presence in that \nlocation (Hufbauer and Schott 1993: \n61). Selecting the origin of cross-border \nservices, particularly network services, \npresents a difficulty similar to that \nencountered in determining the country \nof origin of a good produced in several \nlocations in a global production and \ndistribution network. In general, simple \nand transparent ROOs based on the \nresidency test or ownership and effective \ncontrol of the service are desirable on \nefficiency and fairness grounds.\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\ncosts of compliance and Preferential  \nrules of origin\n\nCompliance with ROOs imposes costs \non firms and traders. Firms must decide \nwhether the benefits of receiving \npreferential tariff treatment are greater \nthan the costs of complying with the \nROOs. 80 Costly and complex rules of \norigin are an important consideration. \nThis is accentuated when a large and \nimportant economy such as Japan, the \nEU, or the US negotiates numerous \nseparate bilateral FTAs with differing sets \nof rules of origin. Development of \u201chub \nand spoke\u201d systems of FTAs, where the \nhub economy has preferential access to \neach spoke but spokes lack connection, \ncan isolate spokes, divert trade and \ninvestment, and raise trade costs (ADB \n2006). Consistent and clear ROOs are \ndesirable in avoiding the development \nof hub-and-spoke systems but such \nan outcome is unlikely when industry \ninterest groups lobby for ROOs designed \nto protect their interests. Indeed a review \nof ROOs in bilateral agreements involving \nmajor Asian hub economies (Japan, \nRepublic of Korea, PRC, Singapore, and \nThailand) revealed that ROOs vary not \nonly across hubs but even within hub-\nand-spoke systems (James 2006). The \n\u201cspaghetti bowl\u201d problem of complex, \ninconsistent, and overlapping ROOs is \ntherefore on the rise and is likely to get \nworse before it gets better.\n\n80  There are few ex post studies of the costs of \n\ncompliance with rules of origin. See, for example, \nProductivity Commission (2004). The study \nestimated that costs of compliance with ROOs in the \nAustralia\u2013New Zealand Closer Economic Relationship \n(CER) were about 1.5\u20136.0% of the ex-factory price of \nmanufactured goods. Herin (1986) reports that the \ncosts of compliance with EC ROOs led one fourth of \nexport firms in the EFTA to simply forgo attempting to \ncomply. Palmeter (1993) finds the cost of compliance \nwith EC rules of origin to be equivalent to 5% of \nproduction costs.\n\nThe costs of ROOs can be conceived of \nas being a direct addition to a firm\u2019s costs \nin the sense of requiring the firm wishing \nto avail itself of tariff preferences to incur \nadded costs. For example, keeping records \nof all shipments of inputs and their prices \nin production is necessary to establish \ncompliance with a value-added rule. \nHowever, the costs may also be indirect. \nFor example, if firms are required to make \nfabric from originating yarn and to cut, \ntrim, and assemble garments within the \nmember territories under the SP test for \ntextiles and apparel, this will discourage \nthem from locating production outside \nthe FTA, even if certain processes could \nbe done at lower cost. Indeed, ROOs \nmay discourage firms from undertaking \noutward processing arrangements in \nlocations that would otherwise benefit \nthem through low-cost, labor-intensive \noperations. \n\nThe CTH test is widely adopted as the \n\nbasis for ROOs for processed primary \ngoods and manufactured products in the \nWTO. However, the test is not perfect. \nFirst of all, the HS tariff classification \nwas not designed with ROOs in mind, \nnor has any other tariff classification \nsystem been so designed. This means that \nproducts may undergo a last substantial \ntransformation without changing tariff \nheading, particularly within machinery \nsectors where assembly is a very \nsubstantial transformation but does not \nconstitute a CTH. In such cases, a CTSH \nrule may be used at the HS six-digit level, \nbut this is usually supplemented by a \nminimal regional content or value-added \nrule. The value-added requirement is \nusually set high enough to discourage \nfirms from outsourcing production to \nlower-cost non-members, thus indirectly \nadding to production costs. Second, \ntariff schedules used for purposes of CTH \nbecome obsolete and must be constantly \nrevised and updated every 5 years. \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nCountries often exercise large amounts of \ndiscretion in applying the CTH test and \nin selecting processed or manufactured \nproducts with rules of origin that are \nexceptions to a CTH or CTSH test. \n\nThe value-added test is widely regarded \n\nas the most objective test, but this is the \ncase only if clear accounting principles \nare applied uniformly. The test sets a \nminimum threshold for regional content \nnecessary to confer origin but may also set \na maximum threshold for non-originating \ncontent as a percentage of the good\u2019s \nprice. Price itself is variously defined as \nex-factory, FOB, and CIF price in codes \nof rules of origin. The lack of precision \nof CTH-based rules often leads to the \napplication of the value-added test as a \nsupplement or as an alternative to the \nCTH rule for manufactured products. \nOne drawback to the value-added rule is \nthat higher value-added requirements are \nmore difficult for less-developed countries \nto achieve than for more-developed \ncountries, particularly where the former \nare engaging in labor-intensive activities \nusing imported intermediate products. \nThe SP test is used in cases where \nproduct value chains are complex and \noperations take place in two or more \ncountries. The SP rule is supposed to be \nbased on a positive standard, that is, a \nstatement of operations or processes that \ndo confer origin, and not of those that \ndo not. 81 However, in many cases the SP \ntest can be used as a commercial policy \ninstrument designed to protect domestic \nproducers rather than as an objective \ntest of rule of origin. The SP test is used \noften in HS Chapters 50\u201363 covering \ntextiles and apparel and may involve a \ntwo-step (\u201cdouble jump\u201d such as fiber \nto fabric or yarn to clothing) or even a \ntriple transformation. For example, to \ncomply with the NAFTA rules of origin \n\n81  However, the latter may be used to clarify a positive \n\nstandard.\n\n(see Box 2.3) clothing items must be cut \nand assembled from fabric that contains \nonly yarn originating within the member \ncountries, subject to a maximum of 7% \nby weight non-originating fabric or yarn. \nThe exemption of the 7% is under the de \nminimis provision that allows a certain \nexemption by weight of various types \nof non-originating material (such as \ncertain types of fabric or fiber in textile \nfabric and clothing that are not produced \nwithin the FTA), but careful and costly \naccounting is required of firms in \ncomplying with these requirements. \n\ncumulation and flexibility in satisfying  \nrules of origin in PTas\n\nFor developing countries to enjoy the \nbenefits of preferential market access \nunder unilateral preference schemes like \nthe Generalized System of Preferences \n(GSP) and other preferential trade \nschemes, the EU, Canada, and Japan \nhave modified their ROOs to allow \n\u201ccumulation\u201d between developing \ncountries, in the form of value-added \n(as in Canada\u2019s GSP) or cumulative \noperations (as in the double-jump or \ntwo-stage processing ROOs in Japan\u2019s \nand EU\u2019s GSP). The US has also shown \nsome flexibility in allowing apparel from \nsub-Saharan African countries to use \nnon-originating fabric up to a limit under \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act. \nJapan allows ASEAN cumulation in its \nGSP rules of origin (that is, operations \nwithin ASEAN countries count toward \nregional content requirements) and its \neconomic partnership agreement with \nMalaysia also allows operations that take \nplace in another ASEAN country to count \ntoward the double-jump rule for textiles \nand clothing. The EU has adopted a Pan-\nEuropean Cumulation System (PECS) \nthat permits inputs from any territory \nwith an association agreement to be \nadded to inputs from within the EU in \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00187\n\nbox\u20022.3:\u2002 NAFTA Product-Specific Rules of \n\nOrigin\u2014Textiles and Apparel\n\nThe\u2002north\u2002american\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreement\u2002(nafTa)\u2002\nof\u20021993\u2002provides\u2002for\u2002special\u2002rules\u2002of\u2002origin\u2002(roos)\u2002for\u2002\nintra-nafTa\u2002trade\u2002in\u2002fibers,\u2002yarns,\u2002textiles,\u2002and\u2002clothing.\u2002\nThe\u2002agreement\u2002states\u2002that\u2002it\u2002takes\u2002precedence\u2002over\u2002\nall\u2002other\u2002agreements\u2002members\u2002have\u2002with\u2002regard\u2002to\u2002\ntrade\u2002in\u2002textile\u2002products\u2002(including\u2002the\u2002multi-fiber\u2002\narrangement).\u2002stipulating\u2002the\u2002immediate\u2002elimination\u2002\nof\u2002us\u2002import\u2002quotas\u2002on\u2002textile\u2002products\u2002from\u2002mexico,\u2002\nnafTa\u2002prohibits\u2002the\u2002imposition\u2002of\u2002new\u2002quotas\u2002on\u2002such\u2002\ngoods,\u2002except\u2002as\u2002provided\u2002for\u2002in\u2002the\u2002safeguard\u2002provision\u2002\nduring\u2002a\u2002\u201ctransition\u2002period.\u201d\u2002\n\none\u2002of\u2002the\u2002most\u2002interesting\u2002and\u2002most\u2002restrictive\u2002\nprovisions\u2002of\u2002the\u2002nafTa\u2002special\u2002roos\u2002is\u2002the\u2002adoption\u2002of\u2002\na\u2002\u201cyarn-forward\u201d\u2002rule\u2002for\u2002most\u2002textile\u2002products.\u2002This\u2002rule\u2002\nrequires\u2002textile\u2002and\u2002clothing\u2002products\u2002to\u2002be\u2002produced\u2002\nfrom\u2002yarn\u2002that\u2002originates\u2002within\u2002nafTa\u2002member\u2002\ncountries\u2002to\u2002benefit\u2002from\u2002preferential\u2002treatment.\u2002for\u2002\nclothing\u2002made\u2002from\u2002cotton\u2002or\u2002man-made\u2002fiber\u2002yarns,\u2002\nhowever,\u2002the\u2002rule\u2002is\u2002\u201cfiber-forward.\u201d\u2002for\u2002such\u2002clothing\u2002\narticles\u2002a\u2002\u201ctriple\u2002transformation\u201d\u2002is\u2002required:\u2002\u2002from\u2002cotton\u2002\nor\u2002man-made\u2002staple\u2002fibers\u2002to\u2002yarn,\u2002from\u2002yarn\u2002to\u2002fabric,\u2002\nand\u2002from\u2002fabric\u2002to\u2002clothing\u2002or\u2002made-up\u2002articles\u2002of\u2002\ntextiles.\u2002for\u2002certain\u2002types\u2002of\u2002imported\u2002fabrics\u2002that\u2002are\u2002\nnot\u2002produced\u2002within\u2002the\u2002nafTa\u2002textile\u2002industry\u2002or\u2002that\u2002\nare\u2002deemed\u2002to\u2002be\u2002in\u2002short\u2002supply\u2002(particularly\u2002silk,\u2002linen,\u2002\nand\u2002certain\u2002shirting\u2002fabrics)\u2002exceptions\u2002are\u2002allowed.\u2002a\u2002\nde\u2002minimis\u2002provision\u2002also\u2002allows\u2002clothing\u2002using\u2002no\u2002more\u2002\nthan\u20027%\u2002by\u2002weight\u2002of\u2002non-originating\u2002fabrics\u2002to\u2002qualify\u2002\nfor\u2002preferences.\nsource:\u2002nafTa;\u2002James\u2002(2006).\n\nmeeting the value-added criterion for \nduty-free access.\n\nAllowing firms to choose between \ncomplying through a CTH or CTSH test \nor meeting a minimal regional content \nrequirement is an innovation in Japan\u2019s \neconomic partnership agreements with \nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and \nSingapore (see Appendix to Part II for \nMalaysia and the Philippines).

Many of \nthese find their origin in the GATS but \nthere has also been much experimentation \nover the last 10 years. A key element \nthat distinguishes preferential trade in \nservices is the approach to liberalization. \nDistinctions tend to be drawn, depending \non whether a GATS-type or a NAFTA-type \napproach has been followed. 82 This section \nexplains the key concepts and approaches \nin both models (including various hybrids). \nIt begins by explaining how trade in \nservices occurs and the types of preferences \nthat can be negotiated through an FTA.

Services, \non the other hand, are by definition \nintangible and can be transacted and \ntraded in more ways than goods. Some \nservices can be exchanged across a \nborder without either the producer or \nconsumer moving. Examples are the use \nof the Internet to provide online services \nlike distance learning, e-banking, hotel \nreservations, telemedicine, as well as many \nother Internet-based services. However, \nfor some other services, the producer \n\nand the consumer of that service have to \nmeet for the transaction to take place. \nThis is because the service is often not \ncreated until it is delivered. To achieve this \nproximity, either the producer has to move \nto the consumer, or the consumer has to \nmove to the producer (see Box 2.4 for the \nfour modes of supply under the GATS). \nWhile the four modes of supply \n\ndefined in the GATS have been criticized \nfor not necessarily reflecting transactions \nin real life, where a service may be \ndelivered through more than one mode, \nmost FTAs still use them as the basis \nfor scheduling commitments. The share \nof individual modes in world trade in \nservices has been estimated at: 40% \neach for modes 1 and 3, 20% for mode \n2 (mainly tourism), and less than 2% \nfor mode 4. 83 Mode 3 trade, mostly \ncombined with FDI, has been the most \ndynamic component in recent years.\nThe advantage of distinguishing \nbetween the four modes of supply is \nthat it gives flexibility to negotiators to \nliberalize only a certain type of activity \nwithin a sector. The existence of four \npossible ways of delivery, however, makes \nthe structure and content of the services \nchapter of an FTA more complex than that \nof the goods chapter. \n\nWhat are barriers to trade in services and \nhow are preferences granted?\n\nUnlike trade in goods, preferential \ntreatment in services is granted not \nthrough tariffs but through the removal \nof regulatory restrictions on foreign \nservices and service suppliers. 84 Many \nrestrictions on foreign services and \nservice suppliers typically occur in \n\n83  WTO Secretariat.\n84  See Sauve and Mattoo (2003) for a discussion of \n\npreferences in regional trade agreements that cover \nservices. See also Goode (2005) for an explanation of \nthe difference between eliminating discrimination and \nliberalizing trade.\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00189\n\ntechnical regulations, licensing, and \nqualification requirements. Some of these \nrestrictions may be discriminatory, with \nforeign providers having to fulfil more \ndemanding or burdensome requirements \nthan domestic providers. Others may \nbe non-discriminatory since they apply \nequally to both domestic and foreign \nproviders. Preferences are granted \nwhen discriminatory restrictions, such \nas national treatment restrictions on \nforeign ownership, the type of legal entity \nallowed, branching rights, performance \nrequirements, 85 nationality, or citizenship \nrequirements for managers, are eased \nor removed for an FTA party but not for \nnon-parties. Similarly, preferences may \noccur when quantitative restrictions on \nservice output or on the number of service \nsuppliers are completely removed, or a \nlarger quota is allocated, but only for an \nFTA party.\n\nAn important feature of reducing \n\nbarriers to trade in services is that, unlike \nreducing barriers to trade in goods, it does \nnot lead to a loss of tariff revenue. The \nremoval of discrimination usually happens \nthrough a change in domestic legislation, \nthe conclusion of mutual recognition \nagreements, or the harmonization of \nnational laws and regulatory practices. \nHence, implementing preferences in \nservices may not always be easy or \nfeasible. The nature of service regulations \nis such that many service restrictions, \nonce removed for one country, may not \ncontinue to be applied to others, given \nthe difficulty of putting in place different \n\n85  Performance requirements are measures that impose \ncertain requirements on the way investors operate \ntheir business. These can include the proportion of \noutput that must be exported, the amount of inputs \nthat must be sourced locally, or requirements related \nto the transfer of technology. These measures, which \naffect trade in services, are typically prohibited in the \ninvestment chapter of an FTA. The WTO Agreement on \nTrade-Related Investment Measures also prohibits many \nof these measures. Under the General Agreement on \nTrade in Services (GATS), performance requirements, \nif they are to be maintained, have to be scheduled as \nmarket access or national treatment limitations.\n\nregulatory regimes for suppliers from \ndifferent countries. 86 This means that \nmany service sector reform measures, \nagreed to in the context of an FTA, could \nbe relatively easy to \u201cmultilateralize\u201d \n(that is, extend to all partners). It would, \nof course, generally increase economic \nbenefits to do so.\n\nConformity with Article V of the GATS\n\nWhen negotiating preferences in the \ncontext of an FTA, the parties need \nto be mindful of the requirements of \nArticle V (economic integration) of the \nGATS (see Box 2.5). Article V, formally \nspeaking, refers to economic integration \narrangements and, unlike the counterpart \nArticle XXIV provision of GATT, does not \ndistinguish between customs unions and \nfree-trade areas. \n\nArticle V does not define what might \nconstitute \u201csubstantial sectoral coverage.\u201d \nIt simply notes that the phrase is to be \nunderstood in terms of the number of \nsectors, volume of trade, and modes of \nsupply, and that there should be no a \npriori exclusion of any mode of supply. \n\n\u201cAbsence or elimination of substantially \n\nall discrimination\u201d requires the parties \nto an FTA to remove measures, usually \ncontained in laws and regulations, that \ndiscriminate against foreign services \nand suppliers. This condition is to \nbe satisfied through the removal of \nexisting discriminatory measures or the \nprohibition of new or more discriminatory \nmeasures, or both. It is important to note \nthat what is being required is the removal \nof discriminatory treatment arising from \nthe regulation and not the regulation \nitself. A timetable can be established \nfor removing discrimination. Measures \nconcerning payments and transfers, the \nsafeguarding of the balance of payments, \n\n86  See Roy, Marchetti, and Lim (2006) for a discussion \n\nof why preferential arrangements could potentially be \nless harmful in services than in the goods trade.\n\n\f\u00180\u2002 |\u2002

exceptions, and security \nexceptions may be maintained.\n\nWhile an FTA lowers barriers between \nthe parties to the agreement, it must not \nat the same time raise the overall level of \nbarriers faced by nonparties as compared \nwith the situation before the agreement. \nIf significant changes occur, WTO \nmembers affected by them may seek \ncompensation or even withdraw some of \ntheir MFN commitments. \n\nArticle V is meant to ensure that the \nFTA, although it may be discriminatory, \ncontributes to further liberalization at the \nmultilateral level. In practice, assessing \nconformity with Article V is difficult for \na number of reasons. For one, there are \nsevere data limitations on the service \ntrade, making it almost impossible to \naccurately assess the volume of trade \ncovered by an FTA on services. 87 There \nis also no agreement on the meaning \nof \u201csubstantial sectoral coverage\u201d and \n\u201csubstantially all discrimination.\u201d \nMoreover, since Article V allows \ndiscrimination to be eliminated within \na reasonable time frame, questions may \narise as to what is \u201creasonable.\u201d These \nsame questions have emerged in the \ncontext of the GATT/WTO Article XXIV \nin the context of goods. However, one \nshould not make too much of these \ndifficulties. An ordinary reading of the \nword \u201csubstantial\u201d indicates that the FTA \nshould be comprehensive in its coverage \n(not exclude sectors) and should remove \nnearly all discrimination between \nthe parties. An FTA that reproduces \ncommitments in the GATS with only \na limited number of improvements \nwould, on the face of it, not qualify. A \n\u201creasonable\u201d time frame should also be \none where phaseout periods are kept to a \nstrict minimum.\n\n87  See Fink and Warren (2000).\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00181\n\nContents of a services chapter: scope, \ncoverage, general disciplines, market access, \nand national treatment\n\nThere is a strong degree of convergence \nbetween FTAs and the GATS in scope, \ncoverage, and general disciplines. FTAs \nalso tend to follow the GATS structure of \na framework of rules and disciplines and \nindividual schedules of commitments. \nIn some FTAs, additional sectoral \ncommitments are taken in financial \nservices, telecommunications, and the \ntemporary movement of natural persons. \nIt is also increasingly common for service-\nrelated disciplines to be found in separate \nchapters on investment, competition \npolicy, and government procurement. \nIn FTAs that follow a \u201cnegative list\u201d \napproach (see below the discussion of \nscheduling approaches), the schedule \nof commitments typically includes \nreservations on existing and future \nnonconforming measures. \n\nScope and Coverage.  Many FTAs follow \nthe GATS and exclude air traffic rights \nand services supplied in the exercise \nof governmental authority from the \nagreement. Following GATS Article 1(3), \ngovernmental authority is defined as \nservices provided neither on a commercial \nbasis nor in competition with other \nsuppliers. Other common exclusions are \ngovernment procurement, subsidies, \nand grants. Similar to the GATS, the \nnorm is also for FTAs to cover all \nmeasures affecting trade in services at all \ngovernment levels including sub-federal \nauthorities and nongovernment bodies \nexercising delegated authority.  \n\nThere are some exceptions. In the \n\nNAFTA-type FTAs, measures taken by local \ngovernments (municipal level) are usually \nexcluded, and air transport, although \ncarved out of the services chapter, is \ncovered by the investment chapter as far \nas mode 3 is concerned. \n\nGeneral Disciplines.  After specifying \nscope and coverage, FTAs tend to \ncontain a common set of general \ndisciplines, usually derived from the \nGATS, on MFN treatment, transparency, \npayments and transfers, monopolies and \nexclusive providers, domestic regulation, \nsafeguards, subsidies, government \nprocurement, recognition, rules of origin, \nand general exceptions. Apart from a few \ninnovations, there is often little difference \nbetween the FTA and GATS provisions on \nthese general disciplines.\n\n(i)\t Most-favored-nation\tclause.\t All \nFTAs tend to contain an MFN \nclause, which usually requires \nthe parties to the FTA to provide \ntreatment no less favorable than \nthat accorded to non-partners. \nThe purpose of this clause is to \nensure that no party to the FTA \nwill be disadvantaged if any other \nparty to the FTA negotiates better \nconcessions in another agreement \nwith a nonparty. This is an \ninteresting clause, as it essentially \nensures that whenever an FTA \ncommitment is negotiated, the \nparties can avail themselves of the \nbest preferential treatment that its \nFTA partner is providing or may \nprovide in any of its subsequent \nFTAs. There may, however, be \nlegal and operational issues \nto consider when negotiating \nsuch clauses, since they may be \nproviding a guarantee that extends \nbeyond what the party originally \nintended. There is also the issue of \nthe feasibility and consistency of \nextending MFN treatment between \nFTAs that may have significant \ndifferences in structure and \ncontent. \n\n(ii)\t Transparency.\t As is the case under \nthe GATS, FTAs typically contain \nobligations to publish relevant \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\n(iii)\t Monopolies\tand\trestrictive\tbusiness\t\n\nmeasures and notify new (or \nchanges to existing) measures \naffecting trade in services and to \nestablish national inquiry points to \nprovide information on measures \naffecting the service trade upon \nrequest. An innovation in FTAs \ninvolving the US is a clause \nrequiring the opportunity for prior \ncomment on proposed changes in  \nservice regulations. \n\npractices.\t Since some services \nare supplied by a monopoly \nprovider in many economies, \nthe FTA usually needs to specify \nwhat these services are and the \nextent to which competitors may \nsupply ancillary services. It is also \ncommon to guarantee foreign \nservice providers access under \nnondiscriminatory conditions \nto the services provided by \na monopoly. There may also \nbe additional transparency \nrequirements including the \nobligation to provide additional \ninformation on the request of a \nparty. In some FTAs, disciplines \non monopolies and restrictive \nbusiness practices are contained in \na separate chapter on competition \npolicy. \n\n(iv)\t Transfers\tand\tpayments.\t It is usually \nstandard for FTAs to contain a \nclause that prohibits restrictions \non transfers or payments subject \nto prudential exceptions. However, \nFTAs following the NAFTA model \nand AFTA, for instance, allow \nrestrictions in the event of serious \nbalance of payments and external \nfinancial difficulties. This is \nsimilar to GATS Article XII. In \nthe Australia-Thailand FTA, the \nprohibition is restricted only to the \nextent that the restrictions would \naffect scheduled commitments. \n\n(v)\t Recognition.\t An increasingly \nimportant feature of FTAs is \nmutual recognition agreements \n(MRAs) for professional services. \nAn example of an MRA is the \nrequirement in FTAs following \nthe NAFTA model under which \nthe parties are required to give \nequal opportunity to members \nof the agreement and eliminate \ncitizenship or residency \nrequirements for recognition \nor licensing within 2 years. \nAFTA allows for the recognition \nof equivalency in educational \nrequirements or experience \nin the granting of licenses or \ncertifications. GATS Article VII on \nMRAs requires WTO members that \nhave either begun or concluded \nnegotiations to notify the Council \nfor Trade in Services and to \nprovide adequate opportunity \nto any other WTO member to \nnegotiate its accession to such \nan agreement. In practice, many \ncountries appear to have taken \nthe line that MRAs negotiated as \npart of an FTA are exempt from \nthe Article VII requirement. It \nis argued that as the MRA was \nnegotiated in the FTA, it falls \nunder the Article V exception and \nArticle VII does not apply. On the \nother hand, since the GATS does \nnot explicitly provide for a link \nbetween economic integration \nagreements and recognition, it \ncould also be argued that Article \nV does not exempt WTO members \nfrom their Article VII obligation. \n\n(vi)\t Rules\tof\torigin.\t Unlike trade-in- \ngoods, FTAs usually have liberal \nROOs for services (reflecting the \nrequirement in Article V).  \nThird-country investors, \nprovided they have substantial \nbusiness operations in one of \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\nthe FTA parties, benefit from \nthe preferential treatment. More \ndetails were covered in the Rules \nof Origin section above.\n\n(vii)\t Domestic\tregulation.\t The provisions \nare often the same as those of the \nGATS. There has been no progress \nmade in FTAs on sensitive issues \nlike the \u201cnecessity test.\u201d \n\n(viii)\t Safeguards,\tsubsidies,\tand\tgovernment\t\nprocurement.\t In general, there \nhas been little progress in FTAs \non \u201cunfinished\u201d rule items like \nemergency safeguard measures \nand subsidies. The safeguard \nclause in FTAs typically refers \nto negotiations in the WTO. \nNegotiations on emergency \nsafeguard measures in the WTO \nhave, however, been inconclusive \nso far. On subsidies, with the \nexception of the EU and the \nAustralia\u2013New Zealand Closer \nEconomic Relations, FTAs have \nnot established any dedicated \ndisciplines on subsidies. 88 \nMoreover, subsidies and grants are \ntypically carved out from the scope \nof the general disciplines. There \nhas been relatively more progress \non government procurement, \nthough this tends to feature in a \nseparate chapter on government \nprocurement rather than as part of \nservices per se. 89\n\nFTAs is general (i.e., public morals, \nhuman, animal, or plant life or \nhealth) and security exceptions \nsimilar to those contained in Articles \nXIV and XIV bis of the GATS.\n\nOverall, FTAs do not go further than \n\nthe GATS with respect to the rules \narea, e.g., safeguards, subsidies, or \n\n88  See OECD (2002).\n89  OECD (2002).\n\ndomestic regulation. Exceptions include \nadditional disciplines on financial services \nand telecommunications, additional \ntransparency provisions, as well as some \nsector-specific provisions relating to the \ntemporary movement of natural persons \nand recognition. The most significant \nvariance between FTAs and the GATS, as \nwell as between FTAs themselves, tends to \ncome in their liberalization commitments, \nwhich are discussed below.\n\nMarket Access and National Treatment.   \nThe degree of liberalization that  \noccurs in an FTA depends on the \ncommitments made in respect to \nmarket access and national treatment. \nArticle XVI of the GATS allows WTO \nmembers when making commitments \nto schedule four types of quantitative \nrestrictions and limitations on the form \nof legal establishment and foreign equity \nparticipation. In general, FTAs using a \npositive list tend to include a GATS-like \nmarket access provision, while those using \na negative list normally require only the \nnotification of quantitative restrictions \n(see explanation of positive and negative \nlists below). It should be noted that the \nGATS market access provision does not \nappear in FTAs that follow the NAFTA \nmodel. In that connection, GATS goes \nfurther than NAFTA-based FTAs, as \nArticle XVI includes nondiscriminatory \nquantitative restrictions. \n\nprovision on national treatment, which is \nthe building block of any agreement on \nservices. The national treatment provision \nof the GATS is found in Article XVII. The \nprovision contains the notion of treatment \nno less favorable than that accorded to  \nlocally owned service suppliers. The \nbenchmark for national treatment in the \nGATS is not identical treatment but  \ntreatment that does not modify the \nconditions of competition in favor of \nnational services and service suppliers. \n\n(ix)\t General\texceptions.\t A feature of all \n\nA key element of all FTAs is the \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nUnlike market access, there is no \nexhaustive listing of limitations that can \nbe scheduled. Most FTAs have adopted \nthe national treatment provision of the \nGATS. In FTAs that contain a separate \ninvestment chapter, there is usually a \nnational treatment provision similar to \nthat found in the services chapter.\n\nIt should be noted that FTAs following \n\nthe NAFTA model usually have an \nimportant provision regarding the \n\u201cstandard of treatment\u201d that does not find a \nparallel in the GATS. 90 Under the provision, \nthe service suppliers of all parties must \nenjoy the better of national treatment and \nMFN treatment. In other words, if the PRC \ngets better MFN treatment in a particular \nstate of Australia than Australian service \nproviders, then Singaporean or Chilean \nservice providers should also get MFN and \nnot national treatment. \n\nPositive versus negative list\n\nA key element that distinguishes between \nGATS-type and NAFTA-type models is \nthe way commitments are scheduled. \nThe GATS uses a positive list of specific \ncommitments that are in turn subject to \nlimitations or conditions inscribed. This \nis in contrast to a NAFTA-based negative \nlist, where all services covered by the FTA \nare considered liberalized unless indicated \notherwise through lists of reservations. 91\n\nPositive list \n\nIn a positive list, only services included \nin the schedule will enjoy preferential \ntreatment to the extent that there are \n\n90  Marconini (2005) discusses the North American Free \nTrade Agreement (NAFTA) inspired approach in some \ndetail.\n\n91  NAFTA-type and GATS-type agreements also differ in \nthat the former deal with different modes of supply \nin different chapters: disciplines for modes 1, 2, and \n4 in a chapter on cross-border trade in services, and \ndisciplines relating to mode 3 as part of a chapter on \ninvestment.\n\nno limitations. National schedules list \nservice sectors and modes of supply \nthat enjoy market access and national \ntreatment, subject to limitations. \nCountries are at liberty to impose trade-\nrestrictive measures in all nonscheduled \nsectors, although those measures may \nstill be subject to an agreement\u2019s general \ndisciplines. The use of a positive list has \nvarious pros and cons. \n\nCountries may prefer a positive \nlist because its use in the GATS has \nalready made them familiar with the \napproach. A positive list may also be \neasier to handle for countries that feel \nless confident about their regulatory \nregime and wish to have more time \nbefore committing an existing regulatory \nsituation through a negative list. 92 The \npace of liberalization is likely to be slower \nunder such an approach, since progress \nis to be made through rounds of request-\noffer negotiations. Such negotiations \ntypically take a longer time to reach a \n\u201ccritical mass.\u201d A major problem with a \npositive list is that it does not provide \nany information on services that are not \nincluded in the schedule or the actual \nregime since economies may choose not \nto bind at the status quo.\n\nAn example of a positive list used in \nthe Singapore-India FTA is provided in \nBox 2.6. The example is a pure GATS-\nstyle positive list with a listing of services \nin the far left column and a breakdown \nof commitments into the four respective \nmodes of supply. The commitment is \nsubject to limitations on market access \nand national treatment. There may also \nbe limitations in the horizontal section \nthat are not shown in this example. \nThe term \u201cNone\u201d refers to a situation of \nfull liberalization with no limitations. \n\u201cUnbound,\u201d on the contrary, means that \nno commitment is provided and any \n\n92  This point is observed by many commentators \nincluding Goode (2005), Marconini (2005), \nStephenson (2002), and Sauve and Mattoo (2002).\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\nbox\u20022.6:\u2002 A Traditional GATS-Style Positive List\nThis\u2002example\u2002is\u2002taken\u2002from\u2002singapore\u2019s\u2002schedule\u2002of\u2002commitments\u2002in\u2002its\u2002free\u2002trade\u2002agreement\u2002with\u2002india.\u2002\n\nmodes\u2002of\u2002supply:\u2002\n\u2002\n\u2002\n\u2002\n\n\u2002\n\n\u2002\n\n\u2002\n\n\u2002\n\n\u2002\n\n(i)\u2002Cross-border\u2002supply,\u2002\n(iv)\u2002presence\u2002of\u2002natural\u2002persons\n\n(ii)\u2002consumption\u2002abroad,\u2002\n\n(iii)\u2002commercial\u2002presence,\u2002\u2002\n\nLimitations on  \nMarket Access\n\nLimitations on  \nNational Treatment\n\nAdditional \nCommitments\n\nSector or Subsector\n\nSECTOR-SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS\n\n1.

It is common \nin a positive list in mode 4 to refer to the \nhorizontal section for the commitments. \nThis is because mode 4 commitments tend \nnot to be sector-specific but to apply to \nall sectors (see explanation of horizontal \ncommitments below). \n\nVariations on the positive-list approach\n\nSome innovation has taken place \namong FTAs using the positive-list \napproach to simplify the schedule. These \ninclude removing the need to schedule \ncommitments by mode of supply, and \nreducing market access and national \ntreatment limitations to one column \n(see Box 2.7). 93 This is an interesting \nsimplification of the schedule, since \noverlaps between market access and \nnational treatment often give rise to \n\n93  Also discussed in Goode (2005).\n\nconsiderable confusion. 94 Merging the \nmarket access and national treatment \ncolumns into one removes the problem of \nhow to treat overlaps. \n\nNot specifying how the service is \ndelivered arguably does little to reduce \nthe complexity of scheduling, since the \nparties still remain free to schedule \nlimitations by mode of supply. On the \nother hand, having only one column for \nlimitations is an interesting innovation, as \na two-column schedule poses the typical \nproblem of distinguishing between market \naccess and national treatment. 95 Still, \ndespite these attempts to simplify the \nschedule, very few GATS-plus concessions \nwere actually granted in the Thailand-\nAustralia FTA. \n\n94  The convention in the GATS is to schedule limitations \n\nthat relate to both market access and national \ntreatment, in the market access column only.\n\n95  The guideline in the GATS is to schedule limitations in \nthe market access column if there is an overlap with \nnational treatment.\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nbox\u20022.7:\u2002 A Simplified Positive List a\nThis\u2002example\u2002is\u2002taken\u2002from\u2002Thailand\u2019s\u2002schedule\u2002of\u2002commitments\u2002in\u2002its\u2002fTa\u2002with\u2002australia.\u2002The\u2002\nmarket\u2002access\u2002and\u2002national\u2002treatment\u2002measures\u2002listed\u2002in\u2002the\u2002limitations\u2002column\u2002condition\u2002all\u2002the\u2002\nsector-specific\u2002commitments.\n\nSector or Subsector\n\nLimitations\n\nHORIZONTAL COMMITMENTS\n\n\u2026\u2026.\n\nLocal Government Measures\n\nThailand\u2002reserves\u2002the\u2002right\u2002to\u2002adopt\u2002or\u2002maintain\u2002\nany\u2002measure\u2002administered\u2002at\u2002the\u2002local\u2002government\u2002\nlevel\u2002unless\u2002that\u2002measure\u2002is\u2002applied\u2002on\u2002a\u2002\ndiscriminatory\u2002basis\u2002with\u2002the\u2002intention\u2002of\u2002nullifying\u2002\nor\u2002impairing\u2002the\u2002benefit\u2002accruing\u2002to\u2002australia\u2002under\u2002\nthe\u2002terms\u2002of\u2002the\u2002agreement.\n\nSECTOR-SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS\nnotes:\n(i)\u2002 \u2002\u2002\u2002Commitments\u2002in\u2002this\u2002schedule\u2002are\u2002subject\u2002to\u2002the\u2002general\u2002limitations\u2002contained\u2002in\u2002the\u2002\n\n\u201cHorizontal\u2002Commitments\u201d\u2002section\u2002of\u2002this\u2002schedule.\n\n(ii)\u2002 \u2002\u2002The\u2002(*)\u2002indicates\u2002that\u2002the\u2002sector-specific\u2002commitment\u2002for\u2002cross-border\u2002supply\u2002is\u2002unbound\u2002\n\nbecause\u2002of\u2002the\u2002lack\u2002of\u2002technical\u2002feasibility.\u2002b\n\n(iii)\u2002 The\u2002(**)\u2002indicates\u2002that\u2002the\u2002service\u2002specified\u2002constitutes\u2002only\u2002a\u2002part\u2002of\u2002the\u2002total\u2002range\u2002of\u2002\nactivities\u2002covered\u2002by\u2002the\u2002provisional\u2002Central\u2002product\u2002Classification\u2002(CpC)\u2002concordance.\n\n1.

The \nabsence of any reservations indicates \nthat the sector is fully liberalized. \nReservations are typically for existing \nnonconforming measures (Annex 1) and \nfor future measures (Annex 2). Negative \nlists have been used in all NAFTA-type \nFTAs. Such an approach can potentially \nprovide a high degree of transparency \nsince, subject to the number of Annex \n1 and Annex 2 reservations, the actual \nlevel of openness is spelled out, along \nwith an indication of the legal/regulatory \nframework in place.\n\nFTAs using a negative-list approach also \n\ntypically include a ratchet mechanism, \nwhereby any future liberalization \nof Annex 1\u2013type reservations is \nautomatically locked in. In other words, \nwhenever an FTA member removes any \nrestriction, even without any negotiation, \nit must extend the benefit of that \n\nliberalization to all FTA parties. The \nratchet mechanism thus automatically \nbinds any liberalization within the FTA. \nClearly, countries that feel confident \nabout their regulatory regime and have \nrelatively few discriminatory measures \ntend to favor a negative-list approach. 96 \nOtherwise, countries would resort to using \nthe Annex 1 and Annex 2 reservation \nlists, and thus defeat the point of using \na negative-list approach. There is also \nsometimes fear that a negative list would \nbind the hands of governments, since it \ncannot possibly be known what services \nmight be developed over time. However, \nit is worth bearing in mind that all FTAs, \nas with the GATS, recognize the right to \nregulate. What is required in a schedule is \nthe removal of discriminatory measures, \nnot necessarily deregulation.\n\nA negative list has no schedules of \ncommitments with sectors, modes of \n\n96  Marconini (2005).\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nsupply, and limitations, since all services \nby definition are liberalized. The annex \nof the agreements contains lists of \n\u201cnonconforming measures,\u201d i.e., those \nmeasures that for the time being continue \nto discriminate against foreign service \nsuppliers. Box 2.8 gives an example of an \nAnnex 1 list of existing \u201cnonconforming \nmeasures\u201d from the Australia-US FTA.\n\nBy expressing a reservation in Annex \n\n1, the party exercises its right under \nthe FTA to maintain the discriminatory \nmeasure in its current form, and is bound \nnot to make the measure more restrictive \nat a later date. The format of an Annex \n1 listing is fairly straightforward: \nvirtually all FTAs using a negative list \nfollow the NAFTA template. It is also \npossible to pre-commit in Annex 1 by \nsetting a timetable for the lifting of the \nreservation. Since reservations are based \non existing nonconforming measures, \nsuch precommitments to phase out \nrestrictions are a good indication of actual \nliberalization (for examples of phase-out \ncommitments in various FTAs, see Matrix \n1 in the Appendix to Part II). \n\nA second type of reservation\u2014on \n\u201cfuture measures\u201d\u2014allows parties to \nreserve the right to adopt new or more \nrestrictive measures. In a sense, this is \nsomewhat equivalent to the \u201cunbound\u201d \nsituation in a GATS positive list. Annex 2 \nreservations on \u201cfuture measures\u201d provide \nimportant exceptions to the sweeping \ncoverage of a negative list. Box 2.9 gives \nan example from the US-Chile FTA. \n\nWhether negative-list FTAs liberalize \nmore than positive-list FTAs depends on \nwhat is reserved in Annex 1 and Annex 2. \nIn principle, it is possible to arrive at the \nsame level of liberalization with either \na negative or a positive list. In practice, \nhowever, FTAs using a negative list tend to \nshow a significant degree of improvement \nover commitments taken in the GATS, \ncompared with FTAs using a positive list. 97 \n\n97  See Roy, Marchetti, and Lim (2006).\n\nIt should nonetheless be kept in mind \nthat a certain degree of self-selection \nmay be involved in these results, since \ncountries with the greatest motivation \nto liberalize may have chosen to use \na negative-list approach. More recent \nstudies are also starting to show that the \nchoice of a negative-list or positive-list \napproach does not always indicate the \nextent of liberalization, contrary to what \nis sometimes argued. 98 For instance, some \nFTAs that are following a negative-list \napproach exclude a high number of sectors \nin their specific commitments. 99 Ultimately, \nwhat matters more is what is committed \nin the individual schedules rather than the \nform these commitments take. \n\nmaking horizontal commitments\n\nThere is often considerable confusion \nabout the status of horizontal \ncommitments in a schedule. To clarify, \nhorizontal commitments in a GATS-type \npositive list bind all sectors listed in the \nschedule unless stated otherwise. 100 \nEssentially a formatting convention that \nremoves the need to repeat the same \nbinding in all the subsectors that follow, \nhorizontal commitments are thus normally \nused for measures of general application \nthat apply to all sectors (see Box 2.7: \nthe limitation placed by Thailand on \nlocal government measures binds all the \nsector-specific commitments that follow). \nNeither horizontal commitments nor \nsector-specific commitments rank higher; \n\n98  See Ochiai, Dee, and Findlay (2007); and Lesher and \n\nMiroudot (2006).\n\n99  See Ochiai, Dee, and Findlay (2007); and Lesher and \nMiroudot (2006). Percentages of sectoral exclusions \nin negative-list FTAs: Chile\u2013Republic of Korea, 46.4%, \nJapan-Mexico, 53.3%, US-Singapore, 59.4%, Republic \nof Korea\u2013Singapore, 59.8% (from Ochiai, Dee, and \nFindlay [2007]).\n\n100  The use of horizontal commitments in relation to \n\nmode 4 (refer to Box 4) sometimes creates confusion. \nThe GATS convention is for members to specify in the  \nhorizontal section the market access and national \ntreatment they grant for mode 4, but not for the other \nmodes of supply. Entries like \u201cUnbound except as \nindicated in the horizontal section\u201d are thus common \nin the sector-specific section.\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00189\n\nthe two need to be read together. The \nhorizontal section in a negative list follows \na similar logic. It contains reservations of \na general nature, which do not need to \nbe repeated in all following subsectors. In \nterms of good practice, only commitments \nor reservations that are truly horizontal, in \nthe sense that they bind all sectors, should \nbe included in this section.\n\nsector-specific disciplines\n\nOther interesting innovations in FTAs \nare found in sector-specific disciplines \nand liberalization modalities in financial \nservices, telecommunications, and the \ntemporary movement of natural persons. 101\n\nFinancial services\n\nFinancial services tend to be heavily \nregulated for prudential reasons. The \nsector is also characterized by a large \nnumber of diverse services that are \ndefined in the GATS Annex on Financial \nServices. Many of the standard provisions \nof a typical FTA could, of course, easily \napply to financial services as well. \nHowever, there is clearly a distinct \npreference for a separate chapter because \nof the unique characteristics of the \nfinancial services sector. Box 2.10 lists \ntypical contents of a financial services \nchapter and approaches taken.\n\nIn general, in developed and advanced \ndeveloping countries, market access and \nnational treatment restrictions in financial \nservices have been substantially reduced \nthrough domestic reform, and most of \nthe progress, especially for commercial \npresence, is reflected in the commitments \nmade in the GATS 1997 Round of \nfinancial services negotiations. As a result, \nwhen it comes to financial services, there \n\n101  The examples given here of typical provisions in the \n\ntelecommunications and financial services chapters of \nFTAs are drawn mainly from unpublished research by the \nInstitute for International Trade. See also Goode (2005) \nfor examples of typical provisions in these two sectors.\n\nis greater emphasis in FTAs on addressing \nnondiscriminatory measures, licensing \nrequirements, transparency, efficiency \nof the administrative process, and \ncompetitive safeguards.\n\nTelecommunications\n\nAn increasing number of FTAs have a \nseparate chapter dealing with the unique \ncharacteristics of the telecommunications \nservices sector. It is also worth bearing \nin mind that in the extended GATS \nTelecommunication Services negotiations, \nwhich concluded in February 1997, \nmany WTO members committed to open \ntheir national markets to international \ncompetition, thus removing the more \nimportant barriers to market access.\nWhile there is no single approach \n\nto a telecommunications chapter, \nit is clear that the value added for \ntelecommunications services for many \nFTAs comes in further developing the \nregulatory disciplines. NAFTA-type FTAs, \nespecially those involving the US, for \nexample, combine elements of the NAFTA, \nthe GATS Annex on Telecommunications, \nand the WTO Reference Paper, to form \na comprehensive set of regulatory \ndisciplines, which are GATS-plus. Other \nFTAs, such as Thailand-Australia, Japan-\nSingapore, New Zealand\u2013Singapore, \nPhilippines-Japan, do not have a separate \nchapter on telecommunications services.\n\nNetwork issues set telecommunications \n\napart. Without access to the essential \nfacilities of the network, it is impossible \nto provide telecommunication services. \nThere is also a need to separate policy \nand regulation. A separate independent \nregulator must be established to ensure a \ntransparent approach to the players in the \nmarket as well as regulatory certainty. \nProvisions on telecommunications \nservices are intended to ensure access to \nand use of the services without undue \ndiscrimination against service providers. \nThis is important because public  \n\n\f70\u2002 |\u2002

services are often \nprovided by a monopoly or under \nconditions where a former monopoly still \ndominates the market. As shown in Box \n2.11, the telecommunications chapters \nalso have provisions pertaining to the \nbehavior of regulatory bodies, especially \nwith respect to decision making, \ntransparency, and technical standards.  \nIncluding a telecommunications \nservices chapter in an FTA allows the \n\nparties to develop mutually beneficial \ninterpretations of the general principles \nlaid down in the GATS Annex on \nTelecommunication Services.

A regulatory \nissue that is important in one market \nmight be less so in another. \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |

To \nbe able to supply a service in a foreign \nmarket, professionals need to either have \nthe mandated local qualifications or have \ntheir foreign qualifications recognized. \nNonrecognition of qualifications is thus an \nimportant barrier to mode 4 access. The \napproach in many FTAs is to encourage \ntheir competent regulatory bodies to \nnegotiate and conclude MRAs. Some FTAs \nidentify specific professions for MRAs \nand establish negotiating time frames. A \ndetailed examination of MRAs is beyond \nthe scope of this chapter but it is clearly \nan area that holds much promise for the \nmovement of natural persons. An example \nof an easing of restrictions on certain \ncategories of mode 4 is given in the \nfollowing case study (Case Study 2.2)  \nof the Japan-Philippines Economic \nPartnership Agreement. \n\nThere is no one single FTA model to  \nliberalizing trade in services that can be  \nprescribed. Indeed, much will depend \non the objectives and individual \ncircumstances of the parties involved. This \nchapter provides an overview of some key \nissues that need to be considered when \nnegotiating the services chapter of an FTA.  \nIt examines some of the key approaches \nused and the potential issues that may \narise. In doing so, some examples of \ninnovative practice that have arisen over \nrecent years are illustrated and discussed. \nThe increasing popularity of some of these \ninnovations, such as in the scheduling of \ncommitments or the treatment of specific \nsectors like telecommunications and \nfinancial services, is giving rise to what \nappears to be a body of prevailing, if not \nof best, practice.  \n\nIt is, however, difficult to generalize. \nThe FTAs that have been concluded in \nthe recent past, not least the services \n\nBox 2.12 for some typical provisions \non business visitors). All such chapters \ninclude a GATS-style carve-out on access \nto the domestic employment market and \nthe regulation of the entry of natural \npersons. \n\nOn the whole, most FTAs do not go \nbeyond improving conditions of entry \nfor business visitors and intra-corporate \ntransferees.

of such agreements, are \nhighly complex in architecture and are \nstill evolving. But the race to conclude \nFTAs, and the inclusion of services as a \ncentral component, is showing no signs \nof slowing down. It would thus seem \nimportant to provide some normative \nguidance to those who may be involved in \nsuch negotiations. By way of conclusion, \nseveral points are worth reiterating:\n\n(i)\t\n\nBefore\tembarking\ton\tmastering\t\nthe\ttechnicalities\tand\tintricacies\t\nof\tnegotiating\tservices\tin\tan\tFTA\t\nit\tis\timportant\tto\task:\t\twhat\tare\t\nthe\tultimate\tgoals\tthat\tare\tto\tbe\t\nserved\tby\tthe\tagreement?\t This may \n\nseem to be an obvious question \nbut the reasons why economies \nchoose to conclude FTAs will \nbe critically important in the \nselection of the approach. Indeed, \nan assessment of existing polices \nand circumstances may well \nreveal that a preferential deal \nmay not be the best option. After \nall, if the objective of service \nliberalization is to reduce the \ncosts of service inputs and to \nattract FDI, this may well be \nbetter served by undertaking \nmultilateral commitments. \nMoreover, for practical reasons \nit is often difficult for economies \n\n\f7\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\n(ii)\t\n\nto have separate regulatory \nregimes for different supplier \ncountries. If preferences cannot be \nimplemented in practice, would \nit not be better to liberalize at \nthe multilateral level where, it is \ngenerally agreed, gains would be \ngreater than through preferential \ndeals? Good policy should guide \nnegotiating form and not the other \nway around. \nIf\tthe\tdecision\tis\ttaken\tto\tnegotiate\t\nan\tFTA,\tin\tthe\tcontext\tof\tservices,\ta\t\nprimary\tstarting\tpoint\tis\tto\tensure\t\ncompliance\twith\tArticle\tV\tof\tthe\t\nGATS.\t The substantive conditions \nof Article V are designed with \nthe objective of ensuring that \nwhen economies depart from \nMFN treatment to negotiate \npreferential trade agreements, \nthey do so in a way that minimizes \ntrade distortions and harm to \nthe multilateral trading system. \nThe conditions of Article V can \nbe met, for instance, by not \nexcluding modes of supply or \ntaking large sectoral carve-outs, \nand by substantially eliminating \ndiscrimination on national \ntreatment. \n\n(iii)\t Much\thas\tbeen\tmade\tof\twhether\ta\t\npositive-\tor\tnegative-list\tapproach\t\nshould\tbe\tadopted.\tWhile\tboth\t\napproaches\thave\ttheir\tpros\tand\tcons,\t\nit\tis\tpossible\tto\tarrive\tat\tthe\tsame\t\nlevel\tof\tliberalization,\twhichever\t\napproach\tis\ttaken.\t What is perhaps \nmore critical is a thorough \nunderstanding of the implications \nand consequences of either \napproach, since this will have \nan important bearing on how to \nprepare for the negotiations. A \nnegative list, since it automatically \nbinds all sectors and measures \nunless reservations are taken, \nrequires a thorough review and \n\nunderstanding of the regulatory \nregime in question. This does \nnot mean that a positive list \ndoes not require a similar level \nof preparation, if an ambitious \noutcome is sought, but since \nmarket access and national \ntreatment apply only to scheduled \nsectors there is less pressure to \ndo so. In terms of outcomes, it \ncannot be assumed that a negative \nlist will be far superior to a \npositive list.  This is an empirical \nquestion that can be answered \nonly by a thorough reading of \nthe reservations in a negative-list \nschedule and of limitations in a \npositive-list schedule. \n(iv)\t Given\tthat\tthere\tis\tusually\tless\t\nfamiliarity\twith\tconcepts\tand\t\napproaches\tused\tin\tFTAs\tas\t\ncompared\twith\tthose\tin\tthe\tGATS,\t\nit\tis\timportant\tto\tpay\tattention\tto\t\ndefinitions.\t Some key concepts \nthat are found in FTAs do not \nhave exactly the same objective \nas in the GATS. For instance, in \nFTAs, the MFN clause acts as an \n\u201cinsurance policy\u201d against an FTA \nparty providing better treatment \nto a third party. NAFTA-inspired \nFTAs also often require the better \nof MFN or national treatment. In \nsome cases, domestic suppliers \nactually get worse treatment \nthan that given on an MFN basis, \nsince the government\u2019s policy is \nto provide incentives to foreign \ninvestors.\n\n(v)\t Particular\tattention\tneeds\tto\tbe\t\ngiven\tto\tensuring\tcoherence\tand\t\nconsistency\tbetween\tthe\tvarious\t\nchapters\tof\tthe\tFTA\tthat\tdeal\twith\t\ntrade\tin\tservices.\t NAFTA-inspired \nFTAs typically contain disciplines \nfor modes 1, 2, and 4 in the \n\u201cservices\u201d chapter, while mode \n3 is covered by a chapter on \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  7\u0018\n\n\u201cinvestment,\u201d which covers both \ngoods and services. There may \nalso be an additional chapter on \ncertain categories of mode 4, such \nas business visitors. Managing \noverlaps and avoiding conflicts \nbecome an important challenge. \nFor instance, in many NAFTA-type \nFTAs, core air transport services \nare carved out of the services \nchapter. However, the investment \nchapter, which applies to mode 3, \ndoes not exclude any particular \nservice sector and would therefore \napply to all air transport services. \nIt then becomes necessary for a \nspecific reservation to be taken in \nthe relevant annex for the sectoral \ncarve-out to apply. \n\ninvesTmenT\n\nInternational investment flows have \ngrown more rapidly than international \ntrade in goods or world GDP. A major \ncontributing factor is the liberalization \nof FDI policies around the world and the \nglobal fragmentation of production. While \nthe bulk of direct investment flows is still \nbetween developed countries, there is also \na growing volume of direct investment \nflows to the developing economies.\nIn recent decades, FDI has been \nincreasingly regarded as an important \ninstrument for accelerated economic \ndevelopment. In East Asia, FDI has been \nused as an instrument to jump-start \nexport manufacturing. It has led to the \nestablishment of regional production \nnetworks and has been instrumental \nin linking the region to global supply \nchains. For some economies in East \nAsia, multinational corporation affiliates \nestablished via FDI account for over half \nof manufactured exports. In the more \nadvanced East Asian economies, such as \n\nHong Kong, China and Singapore, FDI in \nservices is also a growing phenomenon.\nThe developing countries in East Asia \n\nand beyond compete with one another \nfor FDI and try to improve their overall \ninvestment climate. The positive effects \nof FDI are being increasingly appreciated \nbecause of, among others, its ability to \nenhance productive capacity leading to \nhigher incomes and employment, the \nbuilding of manufacturing capabilities, \nand the upgrading of technological levels. \nHowever, countries remain concerned \nover the perceived negative effects, which \ninclude the \u201ccrowding out\u201d by foreign \ninvestment of domestic entrepreneurship \nin strategic and sensitive sectors of the \nnational economy. This has resulted \nin a broadly open national FDI policy \ncoexisting with sectoral limitations on FDI \nentry and operations. \n\nIn this section, we first consider the \nFDI aspects of FTAs in the broader context \nof multilateral rules and approaches and \nother forms of cooperation. Then we \nconsider best-practice approaches to FDI \npolicies in FTAs. \n\nfTas and fdi inflows \n\nLocation-specific factors contribute to the \noverall investment climate. These factors \ninclude an established legal framework \nand economic fundamentals. FTAs have \ndifferent investment provisions reflecting \ndifferences in various location-specific \nfactors. Investment provisions include \npre- and post-establishment treatment \nof foreign investors and their differences \nwith actual national investment rules, \nand the availability of effective dispute \nsettlement mechanisms. Empirical studies \nshow that investors want a predictable \ninvestment climate. Predictability may \nbe enhanced when domestic policies \nand regulations are enshrined or locked \ninto regional and bilateral treaties and \nagreements. It should also be noted that \n\n\f7\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\ntrade rules (tariffs, nontariff measures, \nrules of origin) could affect investment \nflows. FTAs have different effects on \nextra-regional and intra-regional sources \nof FDI.\n\nFDI from extra-regional sources\n\nThe lowering of regional tariffs may \ncreate incentives for extra-regional \ninvestors to establish a presence in the \nregion to take advantage of the larger \nintegrated market (horizontal market\u2013\nseeking FDI). If individual member \ncountries of the FTA were previously \nserved through trade, this may then \nraise inward FDI. If individual member \ncountries were already served through \nMNC subsidiaries, this may induce FDI \nflows to the least-cost location in the FTA. \nFurther, as noted in the Rules of Origin \nsection above, when the FTA has strict \nrules of origin, the extra-regional investor \nmay need to set up manufacturing \nand processing operations in several \nmember countries in the region. When \nmost inward FDI is from extra-regional \nsources, the attractiveness of the enlarged \nmarket size depends also on the margin \nof preference between the MFN-applied \ntariffs and the FTA tariff preferences. For \nexample, ASEAN is heavily dependent on \nFDI from extra-regional sources, yet these \ninvestors at present are not accorded the \nsame treatment as investors from within \nASEAN. A further concern arises when \nsome national FDI policies are more \ngenerous than the regional ASEAN FDI \npolicy.\n\nFDI from intra-regional sources\n\nFTAs may discourage horizontal \u201ctariff \njumping\u201d FDI because it becomes cheaper \nto serve member countries through trade \nrather than by establishing a subsidiary \nand incurring plant-level and firm-level \ncosts. The FTA region could be served \n\nmost cheaply through exports from the \nsingle regional location, thereby realizing \neconomies of scale. The tariff-jumping \nmotive favors FDI over exporting; the \nhigher the external tariff and the lower \nthe fixed costs of a new plant, the greater \nthe incentive for tariff-jumping FDI. \n\nOn the other hand, FTAs may encourage \n\n\u201cexport platform\u201d intra-regional FDI, \nbecause lower trade costs favor the \nestablishment of production networks \nand an efficiency-seeking subsidiary in a \nmember country as it becomes cheaper \nto reexport regional production. There \nis likely to be more intra-regional FDI \nin countries with few manufacturing \ncapacities and when flexible rules of origin \nallow for diagonal or full cumulation to \nenable non-members to supply the country \nthat attracts intra-regional FDI.\n\nCompetition for FDI\n\nAn FTA could result in a highly uneven \ndistribution of FDI among member \neconomies. While increased intra-regional \nFDI enhances the regional integration \nprocess, competition for FDI between \nmember states could be divisive and \ncostly if fiscal incentives are involved. \nTo minimize such competition, ASEAN, \nfor example, emphasizes investment \ncooperation among its members. It \nhas organized ministerial-level joint \ninvestment promotion activities in major \ndeveloped economies promoting ASEAN \nas an investment region (the \u201cASEAN \nRoad Show\u201d). The ASEAN Secretariat \nhas also undertaken several investment \nfacilitation activities, including providing \ninformation through portals, databases, \npublications, and statistics. \n\nWTo Provisions on investment \n\nWhile trade in goods and services is \ncovered by WTO rules, there are no \ncorresponding rules on international \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  77\n\ninvestment flows. A number of efforts \nto establish international rules on \ninvestment have failed. The latest is the \nabandonment after the 2003 Cancun \nmeeting of the Doha Development Agenda \nto establish a multilateral agreement on \ninvestment (MAI). The MAI was perceived \nas unbalanced and unacceptable to many \ndeveloping countries since it sought \nto protect investors and there were \nno provisions on investor obligations. \nDeveloping member countries of the WTO \nwere concerned that this would prevent \nor reduce their policy space to determine \ntheir own investment policies. \n\nWithout an overarching MAI, foreign \ninvestment provisions are dealt with in \na fragmented fashion in several existing \nWTO Agreements.\n\n1. \n\nIn the General Agreement on \nTrade in Services (GATS), FDI \nis covered under supply mode \n3 (commercial presence). GATS \nadopts a positive-list approach, \nthat is, countries can decide which \nservice sectors to commit. Once \na sector is committed, horizontal \n(all sectors) market access and \nnational treatment principles \napply, unless otherwise notified. \n\n2.  Under the Agreement on \nTrade-Related Investment \nMeasures (TRIMS), countries \ncannot impose trade-related \nperformance requirements on \nfirms that are inconsistent with \nthe national treatment principle. \nThe annex to TRIMS contains \nan illustrative list of prohibited \nperformance requirements. Many \ngovernments have used local \ncontent requirements in the past \nto promote backward integration \nand domestic value added, such \nas in the automobile industry. \nTRIMS provides for the phasing \nout of prohibited performance \n\nrequirements, with transition \nperiods of 2 years for developed \ncountries, 5 years for developing \ncountries, and 7 years for LDCs.\n\n3.  The Agreement on Trade-Related \n\nAspects of Intellectual Property \nRights (TRIPS) sets minimum \nstandards of protection for specific \ncategories of intellectual property \nand includes national treatment, \nMFN treatment, domestic \nenforcement procedures, and \ninternational dispute settlement. \nIt builds on existing conventions \nlike the Berne Convention, \nthe Paris Convention, and the \nWashington Treaty on Intellectual \nProperty in Respect of Integrated \nCircuits. \n\n4.  Under the Government \n\nProcurement Agreement (GPA), \ntenders may not discriminate \nagainst foreign products and \nforeign suppliers and locally \nestablished suppliers that are \nforeign-affiliated or foreign-\nowned. The GPA disallows \n\u201coffsets\u201d in the evaluation of \ntenders and award of contracts.\n\n5.  The Agreement on Subsidies and \nCountervailing Measures (ASCM) \nprohibits the use of investment \nincentives that fall under the \ndefinition of a \u201csubsidy\u201d and \ncause \u201cadverse effects.\u201d Subsidies \ncontingent on the exportation of \ngoods produced are prohibited. \nAdverse effects are defined in \nterms of distortions in the trade \nflows of subsidized goods.\n\ninvestment Provisions of fTas \n\nThe investment provisions of FTAs are \naimed at giving investors in the FTA \nmember countries better market access \nand right of establishment and national \ntreatment, as well as restraint in the use \n\n\f7\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nof performance requirements. However, \nthere are still substantial safeguard \nmeasures in the FTAs and in the national \nlaws that restrict FDI. The investment \nprovisions of FTAs usually go beyond \nthose in the WTO, particularly the \nprovisions on the right of establishment. \nThree categories of FTAs may be \ndistinguished in this regard:\n\n(i)  Those that do not have \n\ninvestment-related provisions \nexcept for trade rules. This is the \ncase with most FTAs between \ndeveloping countries.\n\n(ii)  Those that include comprehensive \ninvestment provisions from the \nstart, including pre-establishment \nnational treatment and \neffective investor-state dispute \nmechanisms, such as NAFTA.\n(iii)  Those that evolved toward a \ncommon approach over time, \nintroducing new provisions to \npromote regional investment \ncooperation and grant national \ntreatment and MFN treatment to \nforeign firms, as is the case with \nASEAN\u2019s AIA agreement, signed  \nin 1998.\n\nThe investment provisions of FTAs \ncan be categorized under definitions of \ninvestment and investors, treatment of \ninvestments and investors, and dispute \nresolution and settlement.\n\nDefinition of investment and investors\n\nInvestment.  Investments are usually \ndefined to be broader than FDI flows. \nThere are two principal ways of defining \ninvestments. The enterprise-based \nmethod defines the enterprise that is to \nbe covered and then defines the assets of \nthe enterprise to be included. The assets-\nbased method (NAFTA-type) itemizes the \ntypes of assets to be included, ranging \nfrom physical assets such as machinery \n\nbox\u20022.13:\u2002 Bilateral Investment Treaties \n\ninvestment\u2002provisions\u2002can\u2002be\u2002contained\u2002in\u2002bilateral\u2002\ninvestment\u2002treaties\u2002(biTs)\u2002as\u2002well\u2002as\u2002free\u2002trade\u2002agreements\u2002\n(fTas).\u2002without\u2002an\u2002overarching\u2002multilateral\u2002agreement\u2002\non\u2002investment\u2002(mai),\u2002biTs\u2002remain\u2002the\u2002main\u2002instrument\u2002for\u2002\nnegotiating\u2002investment\u2002rules\u2002between\u2002countries.\u2002There\u2002are\u2002\ncurrently\u2002well\u2002over\u20022,100\u2002biTs\u2002in\u2002existence.\u2002They\u2002are\u2002usually\u2002\ndesigned\u2002to\u2002protect\u2002foreign\u2002direct\u2002investments\u2002(fdis)\u2002from\u2002\nexpropriation\u2002and\u2002ensure\u2002certain\u2002standards\u2002of\u2002treatment\u2002\nby\u2002the\u2002host\u2002country.\u2002The\u2002actual\u2002contents\u2002of\u2002biTs\u2002can\u2002vary.\u2002\nus\u2002biTs\u2002often\u2002include\u2002pre-establishment\u2002rights,\u2002while\u2002\neuropean\u2002biTs\u2002usually\u2002focus\u2002on\u2002post-establishment\u2002rights.\nmost\u2002developed\u2002investing\u2002countries\u2002have\u2002already\u2002\n\nsigned\u2002many\u2002biTs\u2002with\u2002developing\u2002host\u2002countries.\u2002\nThey\u2002seek\u2002diplomatic\u2002protection\u2002of\u2002their\u2002nationals\u2002and\u2002\ntheir\u2002assets,\u2002and\u2002guarantees\u2002regarding\u2002repatriation\u2002of\u2002\nrevenues\u2002earned.\u2002in\u2002particular,\u2002biTs\u2002are\u2002useful\u2002in\u2002ensuring\u2002\nfdi\u2002flows\u2002to\u2002developing\u2002countries\u2002that\u2002lack\u2002sufficient\u2002\nnational\u2002legal\u2002safeguards\u2002for\u2002the\u2002protection\u2002of\u2002assets\u2002\nand\u2002property\u2002rights.\u2002asean\u2002countries\u2002have\u2002entered\u2002\ninto\u2002biTs\u2002that\u2002facilitate\u2002post-establishment\u2002rather\u2002than\u2002\npre-establishment\u2002rights.\u2002singapore\u2019s\u2002fTa\u2002investment\u2002\nchapters,\u2002however,\u2002tend\u2002to\u2002cover\u2002pre-establishment\u2002\nrights\u2002as\u2002well.\u2002There\u2002are\u2002even\u2002many\u2002biTs\u2002between\u2002asean\u2002\nmember\u2002countries.\n\nsource:\u2002adb\u2002staff.\n\nand equipment, to intangible assets \nsuch as patents, know-how, and other \nintellectual properties, as well as the \nlicenses and permits needed to carry out \nthe investment.

Some agreements include \nconcession agreements and the right to \nsearch for natural resources. In ASEAN, \nonly investments \u201capproved in writing\u201d \nare protected under the AIA, while other \ninvestments are protected either by \nthe national laws of the host country, \nBITs (see Box 2.13), or the principles of \ninternational law on state responsibility.\n\nInvestor.  Foreign investments can be \nmade by natural persons or by corporate \nentities. Usually investment protection \nis confined to citizens, although the \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  79\n\nMalaysia and Singapore agreements, \nfor example, also include permanent \nresidents. In common-law countries \n(such as Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, \nand Singapore) the concept of corporate \nnationality is based on incorporation, so \nthat any company that is incorporated \nin the country assumes its nationality. \nHowever, in civil-law countries (like the \nPhilippines and Thailand), nationality \nis based on the location of the effective \nmanagement of the company.\n\nTreatment of Investors and Investments.\nWhile many FTAs would include \u201cfair \nand equitable treatment,\u201d others provide \nnational treatment and MFN treatment for \npre-establishment and post-establishment. \nSome investment provisions apply to \nlisted sectors only (positive approach), \nwhile others apply to all sectors with \nlisted exceptions (negative approach). \n\nNational Treatment.  National treatment \nmeans that the foreign investor should \nbe treated on equal terms with local \ninvestors. National treatment is desired by \nforeign investors, but some host countries \nare reluctant to give it, preferring \ninstead to support local firms. National \ntreatment at the pre-establishment stage \nrefers to the right of establishment or \nforeign ownership of corporate equity, \nother assets, and land. At the extreme, \nforeign ownership is prohibited from \ncertain sectors and enterprises, while in \nmost cases majority foreign ownership is \ncontrolled. \n\nExceptions to National Treatment.  Many \nhost countries, both developed and \ndeveloping, impose sectoral limitations \non foreign ownership and control to \nshelter their strategic and sensitive \nsectors from foreign investor competition \nand on national security grounds. \nExcluded sectors are commonly found \nin the land and natural resource and \nservice sectors and include banking \n\nand finance, transportation, power \nand energy generation, media and \ntelecommunications, land and natural \nresources, real estate, small-scale \nagriculture, and small and medium \nenterprises. Most agreements confine \nnational treatment to the post-\nestablishment phase only. Many \nagreements also exclude state enterprises \nfrom the national treatment rule. In \naddition, most agreements reserve the \nright to implement future measures \nconcerning the limitation of national \ntreatment to several sectors, especially in \nthe service sectors.\n\nFlexibility in National Treatment \nProvision.  Some agreements seek to \npostpone national treatment to reflect the \nlower level of economic development of \nthe host country, while other agreements \nconfine national treatment only to those \nin \u201clike circumstances.\u201d Some agreements \nprovide for national treatment \u201cas far \nas possible.\u201d In the APEC Non-binding \nInvestment Principles, the national \ntreatment provision states that such \ntreatment is \u201csubject to the exceptions as \nprovided for in domestic laws, regulations \nand policies.\u201d \n\nFair and Equitable Standard.  This \nusually means that certain rights and \nprivileges usually regarded as having been \naccepted in customary international law \nshould be accorded the foreign investor. \nAs discussed below, Urata and Sasuya \n(2007) conducted a recent study of seven \nbilateral FTAs, covering the US, Canada, \nMexico, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, \nand found that Canada, Mexico, and \nAustralia have highly restrictive screening \nand approval of FDI projects. Under the \nInvestment Canada Act, Canada requires \na review of all acquisitions of Canadian \nbusinesses, with the value of the assets \nand the control being acquired. Japan \nhighly restricts the movement of foreign \ninvestors. Australia, Canada, Chile, the \n\n\f\u00180\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nRepublic of Korea, and Mexico are very \nrestrictive in their service sectors. In the \ntransportation sector, there are limitations \non foreign ownership especially of \noceangoing vessels and airlines; \noften, concessions for the domestic air \ntransportation sector are provided only to \ndomestic companies. In information and \ncommunications, Mexico, the Republic \nof Korea, and Singapore limit foreign \nownership in newspaper publishing. \nJapan limits foreign ownership in Nippon \nTelegraph and Telephone Corporation \n(NTT) to less than one third of total share \ncapital, and does not allow foreigners \nto serve as directors or auditors. The \nfinancial sector of Japan also has \nlimitations on foreign ownership and \nmarket access. Singapore restricts foreign \nbank provision of retail customer services \nsuch as the establishment of automated \nteller machine (ATM) networking, but \nrelaxes the restriction under the  \nUS-Singapore FTA.\n\nMost-Favored-Nation Treatment.  MFN \nclauses are commonly found in trade \nagreements. The foreign investor \ndesires national treatment between \nhimself and the local investors, as well \nas nondiscriminatory treatment with \nother foreign investors. This means \nthat privileges created in other future \nagreements will automatically flow to \nnationals of the first agreement. For \nexample, privileges accorded to US \ninvestors in the US-Singapore FTA would \nalso be accorded to Japanese investors \neven though they were not included in the \nearlier Japan-Singapore FTA. However, \nprivileges given by Singapore in the \ncontext of ASEAN do not automatically \nflow to Singapore\u2019s bilateral FTA partners.\n\nPerformance Requirements.  These are \nimposed by host developing countries \nto ensure that the foreign investor \ncontributes to expected benefits. They  \n\ncould cover a percentage of firm \nproduction that has to be exported, the \npurchase of local products and services, \nand the employment of local labor. Unlike \nTRIMS, which prohibits only trade-\nrelated performance requirements, FTAs \nseek to prohibit them altogether in their \ninvestment provisions.\n\n(i)\t NAFTA\tforbids\tthe\tuse\tof\t\n\n(ii)\t\n\nperformance\trequirements.\t  \nDeveloped countries argue that \nperformance requirements distort \ninternational trade. First, their \nimposition may result in the \nforeign investor using inefficient \ninputs or production processes, or \nboth. Second, they may influence \nthe type of investment, as they \ncould affect the quality of inputs \nused and, hence, investment \nprofitability.\nIn\tthe\tpast,\tASEAN\tcountries,\t\nexcept\tSingapore,\tlinked\tinvestment\t\nincentives\tto\tperformance\t\nrequirements.\t However, net \nincentives matter to investors, and \nthe performance requirements \ncould negate the positive effects \nof investment incentives. TRIMS-\ninconsistent performance \nrequirements have been removed \nunder the WTO Agreement. \nIt should be noted, however, \nthat abolishing performance \nrequirements alone is unlikely \nto attract FDI if other positive \nelements of the investment climate \nare absent. \n\nExpropriation and Nationalization.   \nInternational law and regulations \nnormally allow expropriation of foreign \nassets only when it is in the public \ninterest, is nondiscriminatory, and is \nmade with adequate compensation. FTAs \nwith such provisions aim at reducing \nthe noncommercial risks of foreign \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00181\n\ninvestment. Home countries require \npayment of prompt, adequate, and \neffective compensation.\n\nMost agreements favor the \u201cfull \n\ncompensation\u201d formula. However, some \ndeveloping countries seek an alternative \nflexible formula that would enable them \nto pay compensation within a flexible \ntime frame in times of balance-of-\npayments difficulties. Many investment \nagreements have also addressed the issue \nthat the protection of the environment \nor other interests of the state should \nnot be construed as amounting to \nexpropriation. For example, the side letter \nin the US-Singapore FTA reads: \u201cExcept \nin rare circumstances, nondiscriminatory \nregulatory actions, designed and applied \nto protect public welfare objectives, \nsuch as public health, safety and the \nenvironment do not constitute indirect \nexpropriation.\u201d\n\nRepatriation of Profits and Other \nProceeds.  Some countries insist on \nguarantees in agreements that assure \nthe ready repatriation of profits as well \nas the proceeds of liquidated assets in \na freely convertible currency and at \nthe prevailing exchange rate. However, \nstrong repatriation provisions may be \nresisted by host developing countries \nthat face balance-of-payments problems, \nparticularly occasioned by sudden \nflights of capital such as those that \ntriggered the Asian financial crisis in \n1997. Some safeguard provisions in \ninvestment agreements may provide for \nsuch situations. For example, Chilean \nagreements generally contain the \nprovision that \u201cequity capital can only \nbe transferred one year after it has \nentered the territory of the Contracting \nParty unless its legislation provides \nfor a more favorable treatment.\u201d The \nJapan-Singapore FTA provides for the \nsuspension of repatriation rights \u201cin the \nevent of external financial difficulties \n\nor in other exceptional circumstances \nin which capital movements could \nresult in serious economic and financial \ndisturbance.\u201d There are agreements that \nrefer explicitly to the right of a country \nunder the IMF Agreement to impose \nexchange restrictions. Also, GATS (Article \nXII) provides that repatriation may be \nstopped in the event of serious balance-\nof-payments and external financial \ndifficulties.\n\nUse of Investment Incentives.  Developing \nhost countries, including many in ASEAN, \noften use a variety of fiscal and non-fiscal \nincentives to attract FDI. These incentives \nare largely given at the discretion of \nhost governments and are normally not \nincluded in the investment provisions of \nFTAs or in BITs. Their use is controversial, \nas is the case with the use of performance \nrequirements. Critics point to lack of \nevidence of their efficacy in attracting \nFDI, their distortionary effect on resource \nallocation, and their negative effect on \ntax revenues.\n\nResponsibilities of MNCs.  One major \nreason why the MAI failed to find \nacceptance among developing countries \nis its failure to incorporate the interests \nof developing host countries by also \nrequiring investing MNCs to meet \nstandards of performance. BITs and \nthe investment provisions of FTAs also \ngenerally make no express reference to \nthe responsibility of MNCs, particularly \ntoward the environment. However, in \nIndonesian agreements, a foreign MNC \nthat pollutes the environment would not \nbe acting in accordance with Indonesian \nlaws and would not enjoy investment \nprotection. Additionally, the Indonesian \ninvestment agency (BKPM) could \nintroduce conditions on foreign investors \nat the time of entry and the granting of \nlicense to operate. \n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nDispute resolution and settlement\n\nInvestment rules, including those on \nexpropriation, need to be backed by an \neffective dispute settlement mechanism. \nThis can be state-to-state or investor-to-\nstate. Some host countries are averse to \ninvestor-to-state dispute settlement built \ninto investment agreements. Disputes can \nbe settled by national or regional courts, \nor referred to international arbitration \nunder the Convention of the Settlement \nof Investment Disputes (ICSID) or the UN \nCommission on International Trade Law \n(UNCITRAL). \n\nfdi strategy and Best Practices\n\nThe investment provisions of FTAs are \naimed at liberalizing the regulations and \nprotecting investments to encourage \nfreer and greater cross-border flows of \ninvestment, particularly of FDI. These \nprovisions have to be negotiated, taking \ninto account the laws, regulations, and \npolicies governing foreign investment \nin the FTA partner countries. Often, \ninvestment commitments in FTAs require \ncorresponding changes in national laws, \nregulations, and policies, which take time \nto put in place.\n\nThere is growing recognition that FDI \n\ncan contribute to a country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment, more particularly to \nparticipation in regional production \nnetworks and global supply chains, and \ntechnological and marketing capabilities \nin manufacturing. This benefit is strongly \nexemplified by the role of FDI in the rise of \nthe PRC as a manufacturing power in the \npast decade. Global competition for FDI \nhas intensified as FTAs have become more \nglobal in reach and as individual countries \nhave unilaterally liberalized. Besides \nliberalizing their policies and regulations, \nhost countries must also ensure that other \nkey elements of a favorable investment \nclimate exist, that is: political and \n\neconomic stability, a well-established \nand transparent legal and regulatory \nframework (including protection of \nintellectual property), and availability \nof cost-effective physical infrastructure \nand human resources. Countries that \nwish to attract FDI in high-tech activities \nhave to ensure a favorable environment \nfor research and development, while \ncountries that wish to attract FDI primarily \nfor employment creation have to ensure \na favorable labor market. Likewise, to \nbe effective, provisions on investment \nliberalization and protection have to \nbe buttressed by liberal trade rules, fair \ncompetition laws, and protection of \nintellectual property rights (IPR). \n\nNational treatment and MFN treatment \n\nare the cardinal principles desired by \nforeign investors. FTAs seek to enshrine \nthese principles. Nonetheless, economic \nand policy space will ultimately be \nnecessary to enable the host country \nto protect key and sensitive sectors \nand businesses from free and open \ncompetition from foreign investors. \nHowever, these temporary and permanent \nexclusions from national treatment should \nnot be lengthy and should be time-bound; \notherwise, the liberalizing principles \nlose their meaning. Nondiscriminatory \ntreatment of investments and investors \nwould enable a country to attract \ninvestment from the best sources \nand assure a level playing field to all \ninvestors.\n\nAn equally important principle sought \n\nby foreign investors is the protection \nof their investments from arbitrary \nand unjustified expropriation and \nnationalization. However, host countries \nneed to negotiate safeguard measures \nto cover themselves in \u201cemergency \nsituations.\u201d Dispute resolution could be \nundertaken under the impartial ICSID and \nUNICTRAL.\n\nIn the final analysis, the investment \n\nprovisions of FTAs represent a fine \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\nbalancing act between a country\u2019s \neconomic, political, and social benefits \nand the perceived costs of FDI. For \nexample, ASEAN would do better to have \na common template when negotiating \nthe investment chapters in FTAs with its \nvarious dialogue partners. This would \nhelp ensure coherence among the various \nagreements and attract more external FDI. \n\nfTa-Plus chaPTers\n\nTraditional FTAs as defined by economists \nfocused almost exclusively on tariffs. \nEven the EC, which began as a customs \nunion and ultimately evolved into an \neconomic union, had diverse commercial \npolicies (e.g., independent nontariff \nbarriers and lack of national treatment \nin certain areas) even three decades \nafter its foundation. It is clear from this \nreference book that modern FTAs are \ncomplicated; in certain areas they even \ngo beyond what the EC included. In this \nsection, we consider four additional key \nfeatures typically included in modern \nFTAs, particularly in the context of FTAs \nin which at least one developed country \nis a party: government procurement, \nintellectual property protection, \ncompetition policy, and environmental \nand labor standards.\n\ngovernment Procurement\n\nGovernment procurement in the WTO\n\nThe WTO Government Procurement \nAgreement (GPA) is a plurilateral \nagreement among 27 WTO members \nthat include the EU; the US; Japan; Hong \nKong, China; the Republic of Korea; and \nSingapore. Few developing countries \nare members, and some OECD countries \nhave not signed the GPA. It is essentially \na market access agreement because it \n\nlowers trade barriers in government \nprocurement through a framework of  \ncommon procurement procedures, \ntransparency at all stages of the \nprocurement process, and the opportunity \nfor aggrieved private bidders to challenge \nprocurement decisions and obtain \nredress. At the 1996 Singapore Ministerial \nConference, the WTO working group was \nmandated to look into the \u201ctransparency\u201d \naspects of government contracts. Many \ndeveloping countries objected to a WTO \nagreement on government procurement \ncovering national treatment, as they \nprovide preferential treatment to national \nfirms, suppliers, and contractors. The \nprocurement issue was removed from the \nDoha agenda in 2004. \n\nGovernment procurement in FTAs\n\nGovernment procurement is a key feature \nof many FTAs. This reflects the failure to \nsecure an agreement at the multilateral \nlevel and the recognition that foreign \nsuppliers of goods and services require \nnot only nondiscriminatory market access \nbut also transparent and fair procedures \nthat allow them to compete on a level \nplaying field. \n\nAPEC developed a set of voluntary, \nnonbinding principles on government \nprocurement. The principles, intended to \npromote the liberalization of government \nprocurement markets and transparency, \ncover value for money, open and effective \ncompetition, fair dealing, accountability \nand due process, and nondiscrimination. \nFTAs have gone beyond the GPA and \n\ninclude many developing (and some \ndeveloped) countries that did not sign \nthe plurilateral GPA. They are more \ncomprehensive in coverage, involving \ntransparency and information access, \nmarket access and national treatment, \nvarious tiers of government and various \ntypes of government business, and lower \nmonetary thresholds for contracts.\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nNondiscriminatory Treatment.   \nNondiscrimination requires each \ngovernment to accord the suppliers, \ngoods, and services of its FTA partner the \nsame treatment that applies to domestic \nsuppliers, goods, and services. Like the \nGPA, these agreements explicitly prohibit \noffsets.\n\nTransparency.  FTAs promote transparency \nthrough the collection and dissemination \nof all relevant information by electronic \nmeans. For example, the e-ASEAN \nFramework Agreement calls for the use of \nelectronic means in the procurement of \ngoods and services by members.\n\nNAFTA adopts lower thresholds and a \nnegative-list approach to service coverage. \nNAFTA seems to have influenced \nseveral bilateral agreements involving \nthe US. In the US-Australia FTA, the \nprocurement chapter sets out specific \nrules, procedures, and transparency \nstandards to be applied in the conduct \nof government procurement. Australia \nbecomes a \u201cdesignated country\u201d under \nthe US Trade Agreements Act and, hence, \nenjoys a waiver from the Buy American \nAct, which enables Australian suppliers to \ncompete in the US procurement market \non equal terms with American suppliers \nand suppliers from other \u201cdesignated \ncountries.\u201d In the negotiations for the US-\nMalaysia FTA, government procurement \nhas been one of the sticking points. In \nMalaysia, government procurement is \na key pillar of affirmative action policy, \nand a nondiscriminatory government \nprocurement policy would undermine \nsuch affirmative action.\n\nThere are no government procurement \n\nprovisions in AFTA nor in the FTAs that \nASEAN has concluded with the PRC \nand the Republic of Korea. However, \nthere are government procurement \nchapters in Singapore\u2019s FTAs with \nNew Zealand, Japan, the Republic of \nKorea, India, Australia, and the US. \n\nThe Singapore\u2013New Zealand FTA, for \nexample, commits to implement the \nAPEC nonbinding principles relating \nto transparency, value for money, open \nand effective competition, fair dealing, \naccountability and due process, and \nnondiscrimination. The US-Singapore \nFTA also makes reference to applying \nthe APEC nonbinding principles. Thus, \nthe APEC nonbinding principles appear \nto offer a common template for bilateral \nFTA negotiations on government \nprocurement.\n\nintellectual Property \n\nIntellectual property provisions of FTAs \ncompared\n\nThe starting point for intellectual property \n(IP) rules in FTAs is the network of \nexisting IP treaties 103 that bind almost \nall trading nations. Many provisions of \nthese treaties are incorporated into the \nWTO TRIPS Agreement (discussed in \nthe Investment section above), which is \napplicable to all WTO members. Together, \nthese rules form the lowest common \ndenominator of IP obligations. They bind \nboth developed and developing countries, \nalthough LDC members of the WTO \nAgreement enjoy a waiver until 1 January \n2016 before they must provide patent \nprotection for pharmaceutical products. \nFTAs often strengthen IP protection \nbeyond that required by the WTO TRIPS \nAgreement. Such provisions are called \n\n103  The WTO incorporates parts of the Paris Convention \nfor the Protection of Industrial Property (governing \npatents, trademarks, service marks, industrial designs, \nand utility models); the Berne Convention for the \nProtection of Literary and Artistic Works (Copyright \nand Related Rights); the International Convention for \nthe Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms \nand Broadcasting Organisations (Rome Convention); \nand the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect \nof Integrated Circuits (IPIC, or Washington Treaty), \nwhich governs layout designs/topographies). The \ntext of these World Intellectual Property Organization \n(WIPO)\u2013administered treaties can be found at: www.\nwipo.int/treaties/en/\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u0018\u0018\n\n\u201cTRIPS-plus\u201d provisions, since they exceed \nthe minimum obligations contained in the \nTRIPS Agreement. TRIPS-plus provisions \ninclude (i) the implementation of higher \nIP protection than that required in the \nTRIPS Agreement, or (ii) an agreement \nto forgo transition periods and privileges \nthat developing countries and countries \nin economic transition negotiated during \nand after the Uruguay Round of GATT. \nThe US and the EU in particular use \nFTAs as a vehicle for negotiating TRIPS-\nplus commitments. Typical commitments \ninclude agreements to accept the \npatentability of plants and animals \nother than microorganisms; 104 join the \nInternational Union for the Protection \nof New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) \nConvention; 105 grant additional protection \nto geographic indications beyond the \nweak protection granted in TRIPS Articles \n22\u201324 (particularly in the alcoholic \nbeverage sector); 106 limit parallel imports; \nextend industrial design, patent, and \ncopyright protection; 107 limit compulsory \nlicensing, particularly in the public health \nfield; 108 increase penalties for breaches of \nIP rights (IPR), increase IPR enforcement \nrules; expand the scope of trademark \nprotection to cover dissimilar goods \n\n104  See The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of \n\nIntellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Article 27.3(b).\n\n105  www.upov.int/en/publications/conventions/index.\n\nhtml.\n\n106  TRIPS Articles 22\u201324 apply to \u201cgeographical \n\nindications\u201d\u2014a term defined in Article 22 of the \nTRIPS Agreement as \u201cindications which identify a \ngood as originating in the territory of a Member, or \na region or locality in that territory, where a given \nquality, reputation or other characteristic of the good \nis essentially attributable to its geographical origin.\u201d\n\n107  The minimum periods of protection in the TRIPS \n\nAgreement for protection are 10 years for industrial \ndesigns (Article 26([3)]), 20 years for patents (Article \n33), and 50 years for copyrights (Article 12).\n\n108  Compulsory licensing is a decision by a government to \nallow the use of the subject matter of a patent without \nthe right holder\u2019s consent. Compulsory licensing is \npermitted by Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, in \nparticular with respect to certain pharmaceutical \nproducts, subject to recent disciplines agreed on by \nWTO members.

FTAs between \ndeveloped countries frequently contain \nprovisions requiring the ratification \nof post-TRIPS IP agreements, and \ncooperation in the implementation \nof TRIPS provisions, including the \nenforcement of laws protecting foreign \nintellectual property. The Singapore-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) \nprovides a good example of an FTA \nbetween a developed country and \nan advanced developing country. 109 \nSection 13 deals explicitly with IP \nprotection. Article 2 of Section 13 \nreconfirms each party\u2019s commitment to \nthe TRIPS Agreement (a common FTA \nprovision) and obligates the parties \nto accede or ratify several post-TRIPS \nIP agreements: the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization (WIPO) Copyright \nTreaty, the WIPO Performances and \nPhonograms Treaty, and the Geneva Act \nof the Hague Agreement Concerning the \nInternational Registration of Industrial \nDesigns. Article 5 requires the parties to \n\u201ccooperate with a view to eliminating \ntrade in goods infringing intellectual \nproperty rights, subject to their respective \nlaws, rules, regulations, directives or \npolicies.\u201d In Article 6 the parties agree to \ncooperate on education and the exchange \nof information on the protection, \nmanagement, and exploitation of IPR. \nMore stringent IP obligations are found in \nthe US-Singapore FTA. 110\n\n109  www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/safta/full_safta.\n\npdf\n\n110  Chapter 16 (Articles 16.1\u201316.10) of the US-Singapore \nFree Trade Agreement contains a large number of \nTRIPS-plus provisions, including the ratification of \nmany additional IP Agreements, and a considerable \nnumber of provisions directed at the enforcement \nof IP obligations. See www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade_\nAgreements/Bilateral/Singapore_FTA/Final_Texts/\nasset_upload_file708_4036.pdf\n\n\f\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nChapter 13 of the Thailand-Australia \nFTA 111 provides a more typical example of \nthe IP protection found in an agreement \nbetween a developed and a developing \ncountry. IP obligations are not as strong \nas those in either the SAFTA or the US-\nSingapore FTA, but are nevertheless \npresent. In general, cooperation with \nrespect to existing IP obligations is the \ntheme. Article 1302 requires the parties \nto observe the TRIPS Agreement. Article \n1303 requires the parties, upon receipt \nof information or a complaint, to take \nmeasures to prevent the export of goods \nthat infringe copyright or trademarks, in \naccordance with its laws, regulations, or \npolicies. Likewise, Article 1304 requires \nthe parties to cooperate on enforcement, \nand Article 1305 requires cooperation on \neducational activities. \n\nFramework of best practices and practical \napproaches to intellectual property\n\nDeveloped countries and advanced \ndeveloping countries are expected to \nconform to IP best practices. This means \nfulfilling their international IP obligations \narising under the WTO Agreement and \ninternational IP treaties, in particular civil \nand criminal enforcement obligations. 112 \nEnforcement issues are a sensitive subject \nin many ADB member countries, as a \nresult of the large number of TRIPS \nrequirements concerning enforcement, \nthe stringent enforcement provisions \npresent in the US-Singapore FTA, and \nlegislation such as Section 337 of \nthe of the US Tariff Act of 1930 (19 \nU.S.C. \u00a71337), which empowers the \nUS International Trade Commission to \n\n111  www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/aust-thai/tafta_\n\ntoc.html\n\n112  Unlike many of the WTO\u2019s covered agreements, \nArticles 41\u201361 of the TRIPS Agreement require \nmembers to establish fair and equitable procedures for \nthe enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR).\n\ninvestigate allegations of patent and \ntrademark infringement.\n\nBest practices also include fulfilling \nany TRIPS-plus obligations FTA members \nhave accepted. The more a country \ndevelops and trades, the more pressure \nthe developed world will place on it to \nmeet its IP commitments, and to accept \nTRIPS-plus commitments. The fulfilment \nof IP commitments, in turn, requires \neducating the private sector, civil society, \nenforcement agencies, and the judiciary \nabout IP protection. Good governance, \nincluding an effective judiciary, is \nnecessary for an effective IP regime.\n\nThe priority a country places on IP \nprotection will depend on its level of \ndevelopment, as well as demand from \nits own business, scientific, and cultural \ncommunity. LDCs almost never receive \nserious foreign pressure to enforce \nIP rules. They also benefit from the \ntemporary waiver of patent protection for \npharmaceutical products enacted in the \ncourse of the Doha Development Agenda. \nThis point should be considered by LDCs \nseeking to negotiate an FTA.\n\nPolicy recommendations and strategy for \nnegotiating IP provisions in FTAs\n\nThe advanced developed countries \nalready have solid IP protection in place \nand are important beneficiaries of the \nIP system. Their business interests are \nthe main proponents of TRIPS-plus \ncommitments. Because of the market \naccess opportunities that developed \ncountries can offer to developing \ncountries, they are in a strong negotiating \nposition vis-\u00e0-vis the developing world \nwhen they negotiate IP issues. \n\nNevertheless, developing countries \nhave historically been hesitant to tighten \nIP protection, both in the WTO and in \nFTAs. IP protection is generally viewed \nin developing countries as favoring \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00187\n\ndeveloped countries and their business \ninterests. IP protection is, however, \nof increasing importance to certain \ndeveloping countries, in particular \nthose that (i) seek to attract FDI (see \nthe Investment section above); (ii) have \ninnovators in particular technology \nsectors; or (iii) seek to protect their film, \nprint, and music industries.\n\nDeveloping countries that negotiate \n\nTRIPS-plus commitments with the \ndeveloped countries should evaluate the \nmerits of more stringent IP protection. In \nparticular, they should look at access to \ntechnology, health issues (in particular \naccess to medicines), the protection of \ndomestic innovation, and the protection \nof domestic artists, software producers, \netc. They should also evaluate the \nrelative strength of their negotiating \nposition in light of their existing TRIPS \ncommitments; the economic importance \nof the FTA, either directly or as a vehicle \nto attract FDI and increase development; \nand the positive and negative effects \nof strengthened IP commitments on \ndisadvantaged members of society. \nDeveloping countries should also consider \nIP commitments that they would like to \nreceive from prospective FTA partners, \nsuch as the protection of traditional \nknowledge and folklore (including \nmedicinal plants) and biodiversity.\n\nThere are strategies for strengthening a \ndeveloping country\u2019s negotiating position \nwhen negotiating IP commitments in an \nFTA, such as the following:\n\n(i)  A developing country should enter \nFTA negotiations knowing what it \nwants to gain. \n\n(ii)  A developing country should study \nother FTAs that prospective FTA \npartners have signed, particularly \nFTAs signed by countries at a \nsimilar level of development. More \nrecent FTAs are more likely to \n\nprovide an indication of a country\u2019s \nreal ambitions in the negotiations.\n\n(iii)  A developing country should \n\nstudy matters being discussed \nand negotiated in the WTO, \nincluding the review of Article \n27.3(b) of the TRIPS Agreement \non the patentability of plant \nand animal inventions, and the \nnegotiations on the protection of \ntraditional knowledge, folklore, \nand biodiversity. \n\n(iv)  If an FTA includes two or more \ndeveloping-country members, \nthe developing countries should \nconsider working together to \nnegotiate with prospective \ndeveloped-country members. \nEconomic blocs, like the EU, have \nstronger negotiating power than \nindividual countries. Likewise, \ndeveloping-country blocs are \nbeginning to enjoy greater \nnegotiating strength. Some \ndeveloping countries are already \nbeginning to work together on \nTRIPS-plus issues. 113\n\n(v)  Prospective FTA partners from \n\nthe developed world may expect \nat least minimal IP concessions \nfrom developing-country partners. \nDeveloping countries should \nidentify the sectors in which \nthey want market access or other \nconcessions, in return for IP \nconcessions.\n\n(vi)  If IP concessions are inevitable, \nthe developing country should \nseek in return exemptions for \nsensitive sectors, long transition \nperiods, technical assistance, \n\n113  For example in 2005, 10 Latin American health \nministers issued a joint declaration calling for \navoidance of TRIPS-plus provisions.

Competition \npolicy refers to the broad set of \nmeasures and instruments pursued by \ngovernments to enhance the contestability \nof markets, of which antitrust law is a \nsubset. Competition policy is directed \nat both government and private sector \nactions and includes privatizing state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs), deregulating \nactivities, cutting firm-specific subsidies \n(industrial policy), and reducing policies \nthat discriminate against foreign products \nand suppliers. Antitrust laws are directed \nat private sector behavior. They involve \ninstruments that control or regulate \nthe permissible behavior of private \nfirms or natural persons. They prohibit \nanticompetitive practices like price fixing, \ncollusion between firms to restrict output, \nor abuse of a dominant position.\n\nProvisions on competition in the WTO\n\nCompetition-related provisions have \nbeen incorporated in the GATT and \nsubsequent WTO agreements in a \npiecemeal manner. It appears in GATT \nArticle VI on antidumping measures \nand countervailing duties; GATT Article \nXVII on state trading enterprises; GATS \nArticle VIII on monopolies and exclusive \nservice suppliers; GATS Article IX on \nbusiness practices; and agreements on \nTRIPS, TRIMS, Safeguards, Technical \nBarriers to Trade, Application of \nSanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; \nPreshipment Inspection, Government \nProcurement, and Trade in Civil Aircraft. \nProposals have been made to extend \nthe WTO rules to include multilateral \ndisciplines in competition policies. A \nWTO working group has been mandated \nto focus on clarifying certain core \nprinciples, including transparency, \nnondiscrimination, procedural fairness, \nand provisions on hardcore cartels\u2019 \nmodalities for voluntary cooperation, and \nsupport for the progressive reinforcement \nof competition institutions in developing \ncountries through capacity building.\n\nProvisions on competition in FTAs\n\nCompetition-related provisions are in \nwidespread use in FTAs and they expand \non the WTO disciplines. For example, \nAPEC has produced a set of nonbinding \nprinciples on competition. The objective \nis to introduce and maintain \u201ceffective \nor adequate competition policy and/or \nlaws and associated enforcement policies, \nensuring the transparency of the above, \nand promoting cooperation among APEC \neconomies, thereby maximizing, among \nother things, the efficient operation of \nmarkets, competition among producers \nand traders, and consumer benefits.\u201d \nThe principles cover nondiscrimination, \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  \u00189\n\ncomprehensiveness, transparency, and \naccountability.\n\nTypically the competition chapter in \nan FTA would contain several important \nobligations, e.g., commitments to ensure \nthat (i) anticompetitive business practices \nare proscribed, (ii) monopolies do not \nabuse their powers, (iii) there are avenues \nfor complaints of unfair practices to be \ninitiated, and (iv) the relevant authorities \ncommit to cooperate and consult one \nanother to facilitate enforcement and \nshare best practices. Competition policy in \nFTAs is generally of two types: (i) supra- \nnational coordination of specific \ncompetition rules, and (ii) general \nobligations against anticompetitive \nconduct.\n\nSupranational Coordination of \nSpecific Competition Rules.  In the EU, \nenforcement of competition rules falls \non the supranational institutions. At the \nsame time, EU member states maintain \nseparate and distinct national competition \nlaws and national competition authorities. \nThe EU also has trade agreements with \nthird countries that call for the adoption \nand coordination of specific competition \nstandards and rules.\n\nGeneral Obligations against \nAnticompetitive Conduct.  These are \ngeneral obligations to take action against \nanticompetitive business conduct. NAFTA \nChapter 15 on competition policy, \nmonopolies, and state enterprises requires \nmember countries to \u201cadopt or maintain \nmeasures to proscribe anticompetitive \nbusiness conduct and to take appropriate \naction with respect thereto.\u201d FTA members \nare to consult and cooperate on the \neffectiveness of their national competition \nlaws and to cooperate on the enforcement \nof those laws via mutual legal assistance, \nnotification, consultation, and the \nexchange of information.\n\nIn the Australia\u2013New Zealand CER \n\n(ANZCEFTA), complaints about the \nmisuse of substantial market power \nmay be filed, heard, and enforced in \neither jurisdiction. These are buttressed \nby a separate bilateral enforcement \nagreement with extensive investigatory \nassistance and exchange of information. \nANZCEFTA phased out the application \nof antidumping remedies. In the US-\nSingapore FTA, the US was interested \nin how Singapore\u2019s SOEs competed and \ninteracted with other companies and how \nthey were regulated, particularly in view \nof their significant role in the Singapore \neconomy. The Competition Policy chapter \nensures that Singapore SOEs are subject \nto the same rules of fair competition as \nother companies, and that US companies \nin Singapore would be guaranteed a level \nplaying field. The Singapore Government \nalso committed to continue its policy \nof not intervening in the commercial \noperations of SOEs, reduce its stake in \nSOEs over time, and enact a competition \nlaw by 2005.\n\nenvironmental and labor standards\n\nAlmost every country adopts laws \nintended to maintain socially mandated \nenvironmental and labor standards. \nHowever, these standards vary across \ncountries as a consequence of historical \ndevelopments as well as economic and \nsocial factors. Standards tend to rise \nwith per capita income; at higher income \nlevels, citizens\u2019 demands move beyond \nbasic necessities and begin to focus \non issues like clean air and water and \nelimination of child labor that may have \nno direct effect on their personal living \nconditions. Differences across countries in \nenvironmental standards may also reflect \nclimate and geographic factors.\n\nSome FTAs include provisions on \n\nenvironmental or labor standards. \n\n\f90\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nSpecific terms may arise from one \nor more of three concerns. First, and \nespecially when partners are at different \nstages of development, the partner with \nhigher standards may fear that a trading \npartner\u2019s lower standards may translate \ninto a cost advantage in production and \nthus a competitive advantage in trade \n(\u201csocial dumping\u201d). Second, partners may \nfear that FTA commitments may restrict \na member\u2019s ability to regulate activity, \nincluding FDI, within its borders so as \nto maintain its own desired standards. \nFinally, developing countries may seek \ntechnical or financial assistance in raising \nstandards at home through participation \nin the agreement. \n\nSome agreements, such as the Republic \n\nof Korea\u2013EFTA FTA, have no provisions \nregarding environmental and labor \nstandards. The Republic of Korea\u2013Chile \nFTA does not provide for labor standards, \nbut its provision on environmental \nstandards reserves the right of either party \nto set appropriate standards for investment \nwithin its boundaries and warns against \nencouraging investment through the \nrelaxation of domestic health, safety, \nor environmental measures. Beginning \nwith NAFTA, all free-trade negotiations \nbetween the US and partner countries \nhave incorporated provisions on both \nenvironmental and labor standards. 114 \nTypically these oblige each country to \nenforce its own environmental and labor \nlaws, address consistency with multilateral \nenvironmental agreements, and affirm \nobligations under the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO) (e.g., Australia-US FTA \nand Singapore-US FTA).\n\n114  The Canada-US FTA dealt only with potential \n\nconflicts with parties\u2019 trade obligations under various \ninternational environmental agreements. In NAFTA, \nenvironmental and labor provisions appeared as \nside agreements added late in the negotiation to \novercome domestic political resistance in the US. \nSubsequent FTAs negotiated by the US have included \nenvironmental and labor clauses in the body of the \nagreement.\n\nEnvironmental standards\n\nWhile the Marrakesh Agreement \nestablishing the WTO begins with a \ncommitment to optimal use of the world\u2019s \nresources, sustainable development, \nand environmental protection, WTO \nrules place few restrictions on the \nenvironmental policies of its members. \nThe basic principle underlying WTO \nrulings on disputes arising from national \nenvironmental policies is that such \npolicies should not be applied in a way \nthat distorts trade by discriminating \nbetween domestic and foreign producers \nor between different trading partners. \nCountries are free to use subsidies to \nachieve environmental objectives, and \nWTO agreements dealing with such issues \nas product standards, food safety, and IP \nprotection acknowledge their relevance \nto environmental goals. Ongoing efforts \nin the WTO to reduce agricultural \nsubsidies are likely to have important \nenvironmental benefits in addition \nto their primary goal of removing an \nimportant source of distortion in world \ntrade flows. \n\nThe official stance of the WTO and of \nmany WTO members is that the setting \nof international rules for environmental \nprotection should be left to environmental \nagencies and conventions. While there \nare potential conflicts between terms of \nmultilateral environmental agreements \n(MEAs) and the WTO over the use \nof trade policies such as sanctions or \nother import restrictions to enforce an \nenvironmental agreement, in practice no \nsuch conflict has arisen.\n\nMost FTAs have no provision dealing \nspecifically with environmental issues. \nA few others explicitly address the \nenvironment in chapters on other \nsubjects. For example, the ASEAN-PRC \nFTA includes environment, fishery, and \nforestry among a large number of policy \nareas in which the parties commit to \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  91\n\nextend cooperation. The investment \nchapter of the Taipei,China\u2013Panama FTA \nincludes a section on environmental \nmeasures, which affirms that the \nagreement should not prevent the parties \nfrom adopting and enforcing appropriate \nmeasures to protect the environment. It \nalso recognizes that \u201cit is inappropriate \nto encourage investment by relaxing \ndomestic health, safety or environmental \nmeasures.\u201d \n\nA major exception would be FTAs \n\nnegotiated by the US, all of which include \nexplicit sections dealing specifically with \nenvironmental issues. (These illustrate \nthe propensity of the US to use FTAs to \nachieve a variety of non-trade objectives.) \nProvisions of the Canada-US FTA (Articles \n104 and 105, Annex 104.1) indicate that, \nwhere the agreement conflicts with trade \nobligations under specified MEAs, the \nlatter will prevail. Where a country can \nchoose among equally effective means \nof complying, it will choose the one that \nconflicts least with its commitments \nunder the agreement. NAFTA was one of \nthe first international trade agreements to \ninclude a full treatment of environmental \nissues and thus set a precedent for \nthe treatment of environmental issues \nin future agreements negotiated by \nthe US. Although the NAFTA text \naddresses environmental concerns \nin several places, including a section \non MEAs with language similar to \nthat in the agreement with Canada, \nadditional environmental provisions \nare contained in a side agreement. \nThe North American Agreement on \nEnvironmental Cooperation calls for \ntrilateral cooperation on environmental \nmatters and includes provisions regarding \nthe parties\u2019 responsibility to enforce their \nenvironmental laws. The US and Mexico \nagree to establish a bilateral commission \nto promote cooperation in achieving \nenvironmental goals and a North \nAmerican Development Bank to assist in \n\nfinancing environmental infrastructure \nprojects along the border. \n\nThe US-Singapore FTA is representative \n\nof environmental terms included in \nother US FTAs. The agreement includes \na chapter (18) specifically dealing with \nthe environment. However, the main \nterms generally call for each party to \nenforce its own environmental laws and \nto avoid using reduced environmental \nprotection to promote exports or to attract \ninvestment. The environmental chapter \nalso proposes the formation of a joint \ncommittee to deal with environmental \nmatters, and calls for each country to \nencourage public participation.\n\nLabor standards\n\nLabor standards are norms for the way that \nworkers are treated, including child labor \nand forced labor, the right to organize trade \nunions and to strike, minimum wages, \nhealth and safety conditions, and working \nhours. All WTO member governments \nare committed to a narrow set of \ninternationally recognized \u201ccore\u201d standards: \nfreedom of association, no forced labor, \nno child labor, and no discrimination in \nthe workplace. Beyond that agreement on \ncore standards, the primary international \norganization dealing with labor issues is \nthe International Labour Organization \n(ILO) rather than the WTO. 115 Nonetheless, \nsome groups, especially in wealthier \ncountries with higher wages and higher \nlabor standards, assert that the much lower \nwages in developing countries constitute a \nform of unfair competition. For their part, \ndeveloping countries understandably see \nthe emphasis on common labor standards \nas a form of protectionism intended to \nkeep their goods out of the markets of the \ndeveloped countries.\n\n115  At the 1996 Singapore Ministerial Conference, \n\nWTO members identified the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO) as the competent body to negotiate \nlabor standards.\n\n\f9\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nAs with environmental issues, most \n\nFTAs contain no provisions on labor \nstandards. FTAs negotiated by the US are \nthe principal but not the only exception. \nWhile ASEAN FTAs contain no labor \nstandards provisions, Malaysia\u2019s FTA with \nJapan includes provisions on encouraging \nhuman resource development and \nimplicitly commits Japan to share the \ncost. Although the Republic of Korea\u2019s \nother FTAs contain no labor provisions, \nthe agreement with Singapore does \ninclude a commitment to promote human \nresource development through such \nactivities as exchange of government \nofficials, cooperation between educational \ninstitutions, and special training programs \n(Article 18.10). \n\nIn contrast, all US FTAs beginning \n\nwith NAFTA have included special \nprovisions on labor standards. The \nNAFTA labor provisions are included in \na side agreement, the North American \nAgreement on Labor Cooperation. \nEach party commits to \u201cthe freedom \nof association, the right to bargain \ncollectively, the right to strike, prohibition \nof forced labor, restrictions on labor by \nchildren and young people, minimum \nemployment standards, elimination \nof employment discrimination, equal \npay for men and women, prevention \nof occupational accidents and diseases, \ncompensation in case of work accidents \nor occupational diseases, and protection \nof migrant workers\u201d consistent with its \nown domestic laws. The agreement also \ncreates a tri-national labor commission to \nfacilitate the achievement of its objectives \nand \u201cto deal with labor issues in a \ncooperative and consultative manner that \nduly respects each nation\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d \nSubsequent FTAs place labor provisions in \nthe main text but are similar in requiring \neach country to enforce its own labor \nlaws without regard to whether those \nlaws are consistent with internationally \nrecognized labor standards. A new \n\nfeature in the relevant article of the US-\nJordan agreement (Article 6) subjects \ncompliance with labor laws to the same \ndispute settlement process as other \nprovisions of the agreement. However, \nthe agreement only requires the parties \n\u201cto strive to ensure that domestic laws \nare consistent with \u201cinternationally \nrecognized labor rights\u2026 and to improve \nthose standards.\u201d\n\ndisPuTe seTTlemenT mechanism\n\nscope of the WTo mechanism \n\nWTO dispute settlement is state-to-state, \nrule-based, and binding, and takes place \nwithin strict time limits. The Dispute \nSettlement Understanding (DSU) is \nillustrated in a flowchart in Figure 2.1.\nThe scope of the DSU is set forth in \nits Appendix I. The DSU applies to the \nagreement establishing the WTO; the \nmultilateral trade agreements on trade \nin goods, trade in services (GATS), and \ntrade-related aspects of IPRs (TRIPS); \nthe DSU; and two plurilateral trade \nagreements still in force that cover \ntrade in civil aircraft and government \nprocurement.\n\nAs the flowchart suggests, WTO \ndisputes may have up to four phases:  \n(i) mandatory consultations; (ii) in the \nevent of unsuccessful consultations, an \narbitral procedure in which disputes \nare heard by a panel, composed usually \nof three persons serving as finders of \nfact and law; (iii) an appellate system \nunder which the finding of the panel \n(the panel report) can be appealed to an \nappellate body; and (iv) an enforcement \nmechanism according to which the \nwinning party may impose sanctions \n(withdraw trade concessions) until the \nlosing party brings its trade measures into \nconformity with the recommendations of \nthe WTO Dispute Settlement Body. \n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  9\u0018\n\nfigure\u20022.1:\u2002\u2002 WTO Dispute Settlement Flowchart\n\n60 days\n\nby 2nd DSB\nmeeting\n\n0-20 days\n\n20 days (+10 if \nDirector-General\nasked to pick panel)\n\n6 months from panel\u2019s\ncomposition,\n3 months if urgent\n\nup to 9 months\nfrom panel\u2019s \nestablishment \n\n60 days for panel\nreport unless\nappealed...\n\n\u2018REASONABLE\nPERIOD OF TIME\u2019\ndetermined by:\nmember proposes,\nDSB agrees; or parties\nin dispute agree;\nor arbitrator\n(approx 15 months \nif by arbitrator)\n\n30 days after\n\u2018reasonable \nperiod\u2019 expires\n\nConsultations\n(Art.  4)\n\nPanel established\nby Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) (Art. 6)\n\nTerms of reference (Art. 7)\nComposition (Art. 8)\n\nDuring all stages\ngood offices, conciliation, \nor mediation (Art.  5)\n\nPanel examination\nNormally 2 meetings with parties (Art. 12)\n1 meeting with third parties (Art. 10)\n\nExpert review group\n(Art.  13, Appendix 4)\n\nInterim review stage\nDescriptive part of report\nsent to parties for comment (Art. 15.1)\nInterim report sent to parties for comment (Art. 15.2)\n\nReview meeting\nwith panel\nupon request \n(Art. 15.2)\n\nPanel report issued to parties \n(Art. 12.8; Appendix 3 par 12(j))\n\nPanel report issued to DSB \n(Art. 12.9; Appendix 3 par 12(k))\n\nDSB adopts panel/appellate report(s)\nincluding any changes to panel report made\nby appellate report (Art. 16.1, 16.4, 17.14)\n\nImplementation\nreport by losing party of proposed\nimplementation within \u2018reasonable period of \ntime\u2019 (Art. 21.3)\n\nIn cases of non-implementation\nparties negotiate compensation pending full\nimplementation (Art. 22.2)\n\nRetaliation\nif no agreement on compensation, DSB\nauthorizes retaliaton pending full\nimplementation (Art. 22)\nCross-retaliation:\nsame sector, other sectors, other agreements \n(Art. 22.3)\n\n... 30 days for \nappellate report\n\nAppellate review \n(Art. 16.4 and 17)\n\nDispute over \nimplementation:\nProceedings possible,\nincluding referral to \ninitial panel on \nimplementation (Art. 21.5)\n\nPossibility of arbitration\non level of suspension\nprocedures and \nprinciples of retaliation\n(Art. 22.6 and 22.7)\n\nNOTE:  a panel\ncan be \u2018composed \u2019\n(i.e., panelists\nchosen) up to \nabout 30 days\nafter its \n\u2018establishment\u2019\n(i.e., after \nDSB\u2019s decision \nto have a panel)\n\nmax 90 days\n\nTOTAL FOR \nREPORT \nADOPTION:\nUsually up to \n9 months (no appeal),\nor 12 months \n(with appeal) from \nestablishment \nof panel to \nadoption of \nreport (Art. 20)\n\n90 days\n\nsource:\u2002world\u2002Trade\u2002organization\u2002(wTo)\u2002website.\u2002available:\u2002www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp2_e.htm\n\nThe WTO Agreement also provides for \ngood offices, mediation, conciliation, and \nan independent arbitral system. But WTO \nmembers rarely use these procedures. \n\nThe WTO DSU has been a tremendous \nsuccess. It is widely used by WTO members, \nwhich have lodged more than 300 disputes  \n\nunder it since 1995. WTO dispute \nsettlement stands in strong contrast to the \nGATT dispute settlement system, where the \nlosing party could block the adoption of a \npanel report (the findings of the arbitral \nprocess), delay was common, and the \nenforcement mechanism weak.\n\n\f9\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nDespite the success of the WTO system, \nhowever, certain questions remain. Should \nWTO panels have exclusive jurisdiction \nin trade disputes, or can a panel decline \njurisdiction when an FTA tribunal is \nseized with a dispute? The Appellate Body \nruled in the Mexico\u2013Soft Drinks dispute \nthat Articles 3, 7, 11, 19, and 23 of the \nDSU require WTO panels to take certain \nactions and that a \u201cdecision by a panel \nto decline to exercise validly established \njurisdiction would seem to \u2018diminish\u2019 \nthe rights of a complaining Member to \n\u2018seek the redress of a violation of  [WTO] \nobligations\u2026.\u201d 116 The Appellate Body\u2019s \ndecision in Mexico\u2013Soft Drinks would \nappear to restrict the right of a WTO \npanel to determine freely whether or not \nit can exercise jurisdiction. In instances \nwhen WTO rights and obligations are \nat issue, particularly rights affecting \n\u201cthird parties,\u201d it is possible that the \nWTO dispute settlement mechanism may \nbe elevated above dispute settlement \nmechanisms in FTAs.\n\ninstitutional structures of fTa dispute \nsettlement mechanisms compared\n\nFTA dispute settlement mechanisms vary \nconsiderably, yet almost always have \nseveral points in common with the WTO \nsystem. A few examples drawn from FTAs \ninvolving ADB members will demonstrate \nsome of the similarities and differences in \ndispute settlement provisions, and better \nillustrate the jurisdictional question posed \nabove.\n\nASEAN Free Trade Agreement.  AFTA \nwas the first major FTA in the East and \nSoutheast Asian region. The ASEAN \nProtocol on Enhanced Dispute Settlement \nMechanism governs disputes arising \n\n116  Appellate Body Report, Mexico\u2013Tax Measures on Soft \nDrinks and Other Beverage (Mexico\u2013Soft Drinks), \nWT/DS308/AB/R, paras. 48\u201353 (quoting para. 53).\n\nunder ASEAN economic agreements, \nincluding AFTA. The protocol is based \nalmost entirely on the WTO DSU. Like the \nWTO system, it provides for consultations, \na panel process, appellate review, and \nsuspension of concessions, under terms \nthat are almost identical to those of \nthe DSU. Minor differences do exist: \npanel reports are adopted at the Senior \nEconomic Officials Meeting (SEOM). The \nSEOM plays a role similar to that of the \nWTO Dispute Settlement Body. Like the \nWTO, a reverse-consensus rule applies in \nthe SEOM. Appeals are made to a seven-\nmember Appellate Body appointed by the \nASEAN economic ministers, with three \nmembers designated to hear a proceeding. \nArticle 1:3 of the protocol allows ASEAN \nmembers to resolve a dispute involving \nfellow members in other dispute \nsettlement forums (e.g., the WTO) at any \nstage before a party has made a request \nto the SEOM to establish a panel.

As is clear from the above \ndiscussion, economic partnership \nagreements that incorporate FTA \nagreements have become relatively \ncommon in East Asia.

Investor-state disputes are \nusually regulated under separate dispute \nsettlement provisions. For example, the \nJapan-Singapore Economic Partnership \nAgreement (JSEPA) is an FTA with a \ndispute settlement mechanism that \nprovides for general consultations to \navoid recourse to the dispute settlement \nsystem. Like the WTO Agreement, \nit makes arbitration, mediation, and \nconciliation available as options for \nsettling a dispute. If the parties are \nunable to settle their dispute through \nmeans short of formal dispute settlement \nproceedings, JSEPA provides for \u201cspecial \nconsultations\u201d as the first step in its \nformal dispute settlement process, before \narbitration. JSEPA permits the parties \nto have recourse to other international \ndispute settlement agreements (such \nas the WTO) to which they are parties. \nStarting an action under one agreement \nmakes that agreement the exclusive \nforum for the dispute unless \u201csubstantially \nseparate and distinct rights or obligations \nunder different international agreements \nare in dispute.\u201d\n\nComprehensive Economic Cooperation \nAgreement between the Republic of India \nand the Republic of Singapore.  This \nagreement also provides for \nconsultations, followed by arbitration \nto resolve disputes arising under it. It \nincorporates many WTO obligations. The \nparties affirm their rights and obligations \nunder existing bilateral and multilateral \nagreements to which both are parties, \nincluding the WTO Agreement, but what \nis to be done in the event of a conflict \nbetween agreements is left vague. The \nagreement only provides that, in the \nevent of an inconsistency, the parties \nshould immediately consult with each \nother with a view to finding a mutually \nsatisfactory solution.\n\nSingapore-Australia Free Trade \nAgreement.  Again, consultations \nfollowed by arbitration are used in the \nSAFTA. In the event of any inconsistency \nbetween this agreement and any other \nagreement to which both are parties, \nthe countries are required to consult \nwith each other with a view to finding \na mutually satisfactory solution in \naccordance with customary rules of \npublic international law.\n\nNorth American Free Trade \nAgreement.  Chapter 20 of the agreement \nis applicable to NAFTA disputes not \ninvolving investment, antidumping \nmeasures, or countervailing duties \n(which fall under other NAFTA dispute \nsettlement rules). NAFTA members \nare required to try to resolve Chapter \n20 disputes through government-\nto-government consultations. If \nconsultations are unsuccessful, the \nparties may request a meeting of \nthe NAFTA Free Trade Commission \n(comprising the trade ministers of the \nparties). If the commission cannot resolve \nthe dispute, a party may call for the \nestablishment of a five-member arbitral \npanel, which is entitled to seek assistance \nfrom scientific experts (\u201cscientific review \nboards\u201d). NAFTA permits parties to \nchoose whether to resolve trade disputes \nthrough arbitration within the FTA or \nbefore the WTO. Disputes like the long-\nrunning Softwood Lumber case have been \nheard in both forums.\n\nIn summary, the above examples are \nrepresentative of FTA dispute settlement \nprovisions. They suggest that FTA dispute \nsettlement systems \n\n(i)  are state-to-state; \n(ii)  require consultations; \n(iii)  usually make available good \noffices, mediation, and \nconciliation; and\n\n\f9\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\n(iv)  provide for some form of arbitration \nif consultations are unsuccessful.\n\n(i)\t Work\twithin\tWTO\trules.\t Many \n\nIn addition, FTA agreements generally \nuse an enforcement mechanism similar to \nthat of the WTO Agreement (but based \non the withdrawal of FTA, and not, WTO \nconcessions). 118 \n\nOne area where FTAs differ is in forum \nselection between the FTA and the WTO \nin the event of overlapping obligations. \nVarious options exist:\n\n(i)  Refrain from taking a position on \nthis point and simply require the \nparties to consult.\n\n(ii)  Make the FTA the exclusive forum \nfor the resolution of a trade \ndispute involving FTA members.\n\n(iii)  Allow FTA members to choose \n\nwhether to have a dispute heard \nbefore an FTA tribunal or before \nthe WTO (make the first forum \nbefore which the dispute is \nbrought the exclusive forum).\n(iv)  Allow the exercise of concurrent \n\njurisdiction.\n\nThe WTO Appellate Body decisions in \nthe Mexico\u2013Soft Drinks case (discussed \nabove) raises questions concerning FTA \nprovisions aimed at limiting an FTA \nmember\u2019s recourse to WTO dispute \nsettlement when WTO obligations are at \nissue, though the decision will not be the \nlast word on the subject. \n\nframework and Practical approaches \nfor Best Practices in dispute settlement \nmechanisms\n\nSome salient recommendations of realistic \nbest practices in dispute settlement would \ninclude the following:\n\n118  The effectiveness of this remedy may be tempered by \nthe existence of any bound concessions a party has \nmade under the WTO Agreement.\n\nFTAs draw inspiration from the \nWTO dispute settlement system \nand this is a good place to \nstart when analyzing practical \napproaches and best practices \nin FTA dispute settlement \nmechanisms. The success of the \nWTO dispute settlement system \nhas served as an inspiration for \nmany FTAs. AFTA presents the \nclearest example of an FTA with \ndispute settlement provisions \nmodelled on the WTO system. The \nframework applies consultations, \na panel process (arbitration), \nand an appellate process. \nEnforcement is generally well \nunderstood by trading countries, \nand commonly used in FTAs, with \nthe exception that FTA dispute \nsettlement mechanisms do not \nalways have an appellate stage of \ndispute settlement proceedings. \nAt a minimum, FTAs should be in \naccord with WTO rules, including \ndispute settlement practices.\n\nconsultations.\t The importance \nof consultations as a first step \nin dispute settlement must be \nstressed. A large number of trade \ndisputes are resolved either \nbilaterally through informal \nconsultations, or through \nformal consultation procedures. \nLikewise, although good offices, \nconciliation, and mediation are \noptions that are only infrequently \nused, their inclusion in an FTA \ncosts the parties nothing and \ntheir occasional use by the parties \nmay, in certain cases, help to \navoid recourse to formal dispute \nsettlement proceedings. Resolving \na trade dispute at an early stage, \nbefore the initiation of formal \ndispute settlement procedures, is  \n\n(ii)\t Place\timportance\ton\t\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  97\n\ncost-effective and efficient, \nand often the best solution for \nmaintaining harmonious trade \nrelations among FTA parties. \n(iii)\t Develop\ta\tchoice\tof\tlaw\tstrategy\t\nbetween\tWTO\tand\tFTA\t\nprocedures.\t Owing to the almost \nuniversal nature of the WTO \nAgreement, and overlapping \nobligations in the WTO and FTA \nAgreements, FTA members may \nfind themselves in situations \nwhere the rules of both the FTA \nand the WTO apply. They must \ndecide under which rules they \nwant to seek relief. Dispute \nsettlement proceedings might be \nheard under one or both systems, \nand the potential for inconsistent \nresults exists. Parties negotiating \nFTAs frequently insert a clause \nproviding that initiation of an \naction under the FTA excludes \ncommencement of the same \naction in the WTO. Two WTO \ndecisions have examined this \ntype of clause, 119 and in each case \nWTO panels assumed jurisdiction \ndespite the clause. Nevertheless, \nthese two rulings, for a number \nof technical reasons, are not the \nfinal word on the question. FTA \ndrafters should therefore continue \nto insert a provision on how \nconflicts between the two sets of \nrules should be managed, with \nthe expectation that members will \noperate in good faith and not seek \nrecourse in a second forum if they \nfail to prevail in the first forum.\n\n(iv)\t Use\tWTO\tdispute\tsettlement\t\n\nrules\tas\ta\tmodel\tfor\tFTA\tdispute\t\nsettlement\tprovisions.\t Because \nof their common goals (trade \nliberalization), FTAs frequently \n\n119  See the Mexico\u2013Soft Drinks and Argentina\u2013Poultry \n\ndecisions (discussed above).\n\ndraw on WTO principles \nand practices. The result is a \nframework of obligations that \nis familiar to the parties and \nmay result in fewer disputes. \nLikewise, FTAs frequently draw \non the dispute settlement rules \nof the WTO as a model for their \nown rules. The familiarity of \ntrading countries with these rules, \nand the relative success of the \nWTO dispute settlement system, \nsupports this choice, and may \nresult in a desirable degree of \nharmonization among FTA dispute \nsettlement systems. \n\n(v)\t Provide\ttechnical\tassistance\ton\tdispute\t\nsettlement\tto\tdeveloping-country\t\nFTA\tmembers.\t Economically \nmore advanced FTA members \nshould recognize the importance \nof strengthening capacity and \ninstitutions in less-developed \nmembers. Capacity constraints \ncan limit the ability of developing \ncountries, in particular LDCs, to \nparticipate successfully in FTA \ndispute settlement proceedings. \nTechnical assistance regarding \ndispute settlement practices \nand procedures is important in \nmaintaining an equitable dispute \nsettlement system. More broadly, \ninvestment in education in poorer \nmember countries can help \nimprove the success of the FTA in \ngeneral, and its dispute settlement \nsystem in particular. \n(vi)\t Emphasize\tgood\tgovernance\t\n\nprinciples,\tincluding\ttransparency,\tin\t\nFTA\tdispute\tsettlement\tprocedures\t\nand\tpractices.\t Factors like good \ngovernance and transparency \nwill influence the success of an \nFTA and will provide greater \nlegitimacy for its dispute \nsettlement system.

of invesTmenT \nagreemenTs\n\nKey NAFTA Investment Provisions.  Chapter \n11 contains the most established regional \ninvestment regime. Investment is defined \nthrough a broad list of assets, along with \na negative list of certain claims to money. \nAlthough investment provisions are \napplicable to all sectors in principle, each \ncountry has identified key sectors that are \nexempted. National treatment and most-\nfavored nation (MFN) treatment are granted \nfor the establishment (market access), \nacquisition, expansion, management, \nconduct, operation, and sale or other \ndisposition of investments. In addition, \nthere are prohibitions on restrictions on \nownership and on use of performance \nrequirements, and there are guarantees \non free transfer of funds and protection \nfrom expropriation and nationalization. \nThere is also a comprehensive dispute \n\nsettlement mechanism for state-to-state \nand investor-to-state disputes, including \naccess to international arbitration through \nthe International Centre for Settlement of \nInvestment Disputes (ICSID) and the UN \nCommission on International Trade Law \n(UNCITRAL). \n\n(i)  The obligations of the investment \nchapter in US FTAs go far beyond \nthe provisions proposed at the \nWTO. For example, they require \nUS investors and investments to \nbe treated at least equally with \nlocals (national treatment), in \npreestablishment rights and other \nmatters, unless the exceptions \nare listed in the FTA (negative-\nlist approach). Performance \nrequirements such as transfer of \ntechnology are also prohibited \nexcept in certain circumstances or \nfor listed exceptions.\n\n\fparT\u2002ii:\u2002 Coverage\u2002of\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002 |  10\u0018\n\n(ii)  US FTA negotiations with \nsome ASEAN countries on \nthe investment chapter have \nmet with various difficulties. \nThe expropriation provision \nrequires compensation, including \ninterest, for direct or indirect \nexpropriation of an investment. \nAs \u201cinvestment\u201d is defined very \nbroadly to include tangible \nand intangible property, loans, \nshares, intellectual property, \netc., investors can directly sue \nthe state at an international \ntribunal for violations of the \ninvestment chapter, including \nthe expropriation provision. \n\u201cIndirect investment\u201d could mean \nlosses resulting from government \nregulation or policy. The \ninvestment chapter could affect a \npartner country\u2019s ability to put in \nplace capital controls and other \npolicies such as those used during \nthe 1997 Asian financial crisis.\n\nmay also be brought before the ICSID, \nUNCITRAL, the Regional Centre for \nArbitration in Kuala Lumpur, or any other \nregional center. ASEAN has likewise \nentered into economic partnership \nagreements with its dialogue partners \n(the PRC, Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nthe Australia\u2013New Zealand FTA, India, \nand the EU). The investment chapter in \neach agreement is aimed at promoting \nliberalization, transparency, facilitation, \nand protection of cross-border investment. \nA concern, however, is the lack of \ncoherence and consistency among the \ndifferent agreements.\n\nKey Investment Provisions of the \nJapan-Singapore Economic Partnership \nAgreement (JSEPA).  In recent years \nSingapore has been prolific in signing \nbilateral trade agreements. The investment \nprovisions of JSEPA (Chapter 8) are \nexamined below.\n\n(i)\t\n\nKey ASEAN Investment Provisions.  These \nare contained in the 1987 ASEAN \nAgreement on the Promotion and \nProtection of Investment, and the 1998 \nFramework Agreement on the AIA. The \nlatter introduced the concept of the \n\u201cASEAN investor\u201d and covers investments \nfrom sources within and outside the \nASEAN region. It provides for national \ntreatment for ASEAN investors by 2010 \n(later advanced to 2003) and non-ASEAN \ninvestors by 2020 (later advanced to \n2010) with respect to investments that \nare specifically approved in writing \nand registered by the host country; for \npreestablishment rights subject to a \nnegative list of temporary and sensitive \nexclusions from each ASEAN state; \nand for state-to-state and investor-to-\nstate dispute settlement at the national \nand regional (meetings of the ASEAN \neconomic ministers) levels. Disputes \n\nInvestment\tvs.\tEnterprise.\t  \n\u201cInvestment\u201d is very broadly defined \nto cover every kind of asset owned \nor controlled, directly or indirectly, \nby an investor. It also includes profit, \ninterest, capital gains, dividends, \nroyalties, and fees. \u201cInvestor\u201d \ncovers nationals of Japan, nationals \nof Singapore, and permanent \nresidents of Singapore. \u201cEnterprise\u201d \nmeans any legal person/entity and \nincludes government-owned and \ngovernment-controlled corporations. \nAn enterprise is defined as \u201cowned\u201d \nby non-parties if more than 50% \nof the equity interest is owned by \nnon-parties, and \u201ccontrolled\u201d by \nnon-parties if such persons have \nthe power to name a majority of \nits directors or otherwise to legally \ndirect its actions.\n\n(ii)\t National\ttreatment\t(Article\t73):\t  \n\nEach party must accord investors/\ninvestments of its FTA partner \n\n\f10\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nnational treatment with regard \nto the establishment, acquisition, \nexpansion, management, \noperation, maintenance, \nuse, possession, liquidation, \nsale, or other disposition of \ninvestment.  National treatment \nalso extends to access to its courts \nof justice and administrative \ntribunals and agencies. National \ntreatment applies as well to any \nrestitution or compensation to \ninvestors that have suffered loss \nor damage to their investments \ndue to armed conflict or \nrevolution, insurrection, and civil \ndisturbance.\n(a)  Japan has listed the following \n\nexceptions: horizontal \nexceptions on land transport; \nprior notification requirement \nin some sectors; public \nmonopoly and state enterprises; \nsubsidies designated for \ninvestments in research and \ndevelopment; and permanent \nresidents of Singapore. \nSectoral exceptions cover \nagriculture (plant breeder\u2019s \nrights); the mining industry, \nincluding oil and natural gas \nexploration and development; \nthe water transport industry; \nfinancial services; and the \ntelecommunications industry. \nNational treatment and \nprohibition of performance \nrequirements do not apply to \nfisheries within the territorial \nseas, internal waters, and \nexclusive economic zones; the \nmanufacture of explosives; \nthe nuclear energy industry; \nthe aircraft industry; the arms \nindustry; the space industry; \nthe electric utility industry; the \ngas utility industry; and the \nbroadcasting industry.\n\n(b)  Singapore has listed the \nfollowing exceptions: \nhorizontal exceptions on \nsubsidies and incentives for all \nsectors; company registration \nformalities for all sectors (also \nexceptions to performance \nrequirements); ownership of \nresidential land and property; \nregulations on Singapore-\ndollar transactions; and \nprivatization (also performance \nrequirements).

In the \nJapan-Mexico agreement, Mexico \nhas more restrictions on FDI than \nJapan. In the Chile\u2013Republic \nof Korea agreement, the two \ncountries are almost equally \nrestrictive. Restrictions cover \nforeign ownership and market \naccess, national treatment, \ncomposition of management, \nperformance requirements, entry \nof investors and businesspeople, \nand right to implement future \nrestrictive measures.\n\n(ii)  The North American Free Trade \nAgreement (NAFTA) is also \nrestrictive to FDI. Canada and \nMexico maintain a high degree \nof restrictions. The US, while \nrelatively more open, requires \nreciprocity from its FTA partners\u2014\n\n\f10\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nit opens up only those sectors \nthat its FTA partner also opens \nup to US investors. Canada and \nMexico have very high restrictions \non agriculture and mining. All \nthree NAFTA countries maintain \nhigh restrictions on the financial, \ntransportation, and information \nand communications sectors.

The US is the most open \nto FDI; its restrictions usually follow the \nreciprocity principle. It is relatively open \nin the primary, manufacturing, and most \nservice sectors, except for the financial \nand transportation sectors. Singapore \nis relatively open to FDI, but imposes \nlimitations on foreign ownership in state \nenterprises, certain types of housing, and \nfinancial services. Foreigners who wish \nto register a business firm in Singapore \nneed to have a local manager, and a local \nresident for at least one of the directors, \nwhile all branches of foreign companies \nshould have at least two local agents.\n\n\fPart III: \nNegotiating, \nImplementing, and \nEvaluating Free \nTrade Agreements\n\ninTroducTion \n\na\u2002country\u2019s participation in a free trade agreement \n\n(FTA) does not begin and end with the actual \nnegotiations.

The \nprocedures, however, are usually the same \nand are more often dictated by national \nlaws and practices.\n\nThe starting point of an FTA process \n\nvaries between countries. While most \ndeveloped countries and some newly \nindustrialized economies (NIEs) in Asia \nbegin with pre-negotiation consultations \nor exploratory works, most developing \ncountries (e.g., member countries \nof the ASEAN) begin with high-level \ngovernment-to-government initiatives.\nAt the pre-negotiation consultation \n\nstage, national feasibility studies, \ndomestic sensitivity analysis, scoping \nstudies, or public hearings assess the \ndesirability and viability of the proposed \nFTA and identify sectoral difficulties. \nWhen the FTA is found to be appropriate \n\nand timely, the country that conducted \nthe feasibility studies proposes FTA \nnegotiation. FTA initiation therefore \ninvolves an active player (the country that \nhas determined the relevance of entering \ninto an FTA and thereby proposes FTA \nnegotiations with another party) and a \npassive player (the country that accepts \nthe proposal from a prospective FTA \npartner to negotiate).\n\nIn many countries, the decision to  \nenter into an FTA is politically motivated \nand is sometimes determined by \nthe head of state. In this case, FTA \ninitiation precedes the pre-negotiation \nconsultations. The idea of entering into \nan FTA is usually introduced in bilateral \nmeetings (such as state visits) to further \nthe economic relations between the \nparties involved. ASEAN, for instance, has \n\n\fparT\u2002iii:\u2002 negoTiaTing,\u2002implemenTing,\u2002and\u2002evaluaTing\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenTs\u2002 |  111\n\ntypically acceded to FTA talks initiated \nby its external dialogue partners in the \nASEAN-plus FTAs. \n\nAfter the initiation or pre-negotiation \nconsultation, the prospective FTA partners \nissue a joint statement declaring formally \ntheir intention to negotiate and enter \ninto an FTA. Joint statements usually \ncontain the rationale or significance of \nthe FTA, its broad coverage, the target \ndate of implementation, and sometimes \na reference to the country\u2019s WTO \ncommitments. \n\nSome pre-negotiation procedures \n\nare then required and preliminary \ngovernment-to-government contact \nis made. These internal government \nprocedures are a precursor to launching \nFTA negotiations, which include \nlegislative notification (especially where \nthe parliament has a strong role in or \ninfluence on executive policies), the \ncirculation of presidential or ministerial \ndirectives (as in most ASEAN countries), \nthe submission of the overall FTA \nobjectives and strategy to the cabinet for \napproval (as in the Republic of Korea), \nor formal adoption by member states \n(as in the case of the Australian Federal \nGovernment and the EU). In the process, \nthe mandate to negotiate is obtained.\n\nAt the organization stage or as early \n\nas the pre-negotiation stage, several \nbodies may be organized or convened\u2014\nnational advisory committees (with \nrepresentatives from the public and \nprivate sectors); legislative-executive \nand interagency committees (composed \nof public stakeholders, regulators, and \npolicy makers); and the negotiating team \n(at the working and support levels). The \ncommittees (which are either decision-\nmaking or consultative bodies) will \noversee and coordinate the policy aspects \nof the FTA and ensure that they are \naligned with the national objectives of the \ncountry. The negotiating team is tasked to \ncarry out their negotiation mandate. \n\nA joint study group (JSG) (which will \nconduct the joint feasibility study) and a \njoint coordinating team (JCT) (which will \nagree on the terms of the negotiation) are \norganized on both sides of the negotiating \ntable as part of the broader consultation \nand information-gathering stage. If the \nJSG report recommends entering into an \nFTA and this recommendation is accepted \nby the leaders of the prospective partner \ncountries, a framework agreement is \nsigned or formal negotiation ensues. \nThe framework agreement specifies \nthe outline or coverage of the proposed \nagreement, including areas for possible \neconomic cooperation and possibly \u201cearly-\nharvest schemes.\u201d 121 With or without a \nframework agreement, the JCT agrees on \nthe terms of the negotiation and moves on \nto the negotiation. \n\nFTA negotiation (which takes 1\u20132 \nyears, depending on the issues covered \nand the depth of the proposed agreement) \noccurs at two levels\u2014externally with the \nnegotiating counterparts, and domestically \nwith national stakeholders. External \nnegotiations are conducted between \nchief negotiators (especially on sensitive \nissues) and between sub-teams at plenary \nsessions and at working group level \n(for specialized or technical matters). \nDomestic negotiations take place with \nstakeholders from both the public sector \n(e.g., policy makers, cabinet members, \nand regulatory bodies) and the private \nsector (e.g., business or industry groups, \nNGOs, workers\u2019 unions, environmental \nlobbyists, civil society, and consumer \ngroups). Part of the negotiator\u2019s task at \nthis stage is therefore balancing external \nand domestic interests. While domestic \nnegotiations are an integral part of the \nwhole negotiation process in advanced \n\n121  A term used in trade negotiations for agreeing to \naccept the results of a portion of the negotiations \nbefore the rest of the negotiations are completed (e.g., \nearly implementation of tariff liberalization of selected \ngoods).\n\n\f11\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\ncountries, external negotiations are still \nat the center of the process in many \ndeveloping countries.\n\nConcurrently, coordination and \nconsultation with the interagency \ncommittee, the national advisory council, \nthe cabinet, and the legislative body 122 \ncontinues. While some practical issues are \naddressed through meetings among the \nministries concerned (at the director or \ndirector-general level depending on the \nlevel of authority needed to resolve the \nissues), critical issues are often elevated to \nthe interagency committee, the national \nadvisory council, or the cabinet. Highly \ncritical issues that dictate the destiny of \nthe whole negotiation are sometimes \ntaken up at the level of the head of \nstate, usually at the final stage of the \nnegotiation. In some countries, regular \nlegislative reports or notices provide an \nopportunity to discuss critical issues, \narrive at new bargaining positions if \nnecessary, and minimize possible conflicts \nor obstacles during ratification. \n\nSometimes the text of the agreement \nis based on previously signed agreements \n(e.g., agreements entered into by the US, \nJapan, and ASEAN) to which one of the \ncountries is a party. This process, called \n\u201cdocking,\u201d saves time, as negotiators no \nlonger need to renegotiate areas that do \nnot present any material issue to either \nside. Docking may even result in more \nconsistent or harmonized FTA agreements \n(especially in the matter of rules), \nlessening the so-called \u201cspaghetti bowl \neffect\u201d of FTA proliferation. \n\nAfter the negotiation but before the \n\nsigning of the agreement, the text of \nthe agreement is initialled by the chief \n\nbox\u20023.1:\u2002 How the US Negotiates a  \nTrade Agreement\n\nbefore\u2002negotiations,\u2002the\u2002administration\u2002notifies\u2002\nthe\u2002Congress,\u2002consults\u2002with\u2002relevant\u2002congressional\u2002\ncommittees\u2002and\u2002the\u2002Congressional\u2002oversight\u2002group\u2002\n(Cog),\u2002and\u2002complies\u2002with\u2002additional\u2002consultation\u2002and\u2002\nassessment\u2002requirements\u2002(for\u2002negotiations\u2002in\u2002the\u2002\nagriculture,\u2002textiles\u2002and\u2002apparel,\u2002and\u2002fish\u2002and\u2002shellfish\u2002\nsectors).\u2002The\u2002Congress\u2002then\u2002considers\u2002implementing\u2002\nlegislation\u2002for\u2002a\u2002trade\u2002agreement\u2002under\u2002expedited\u2002\nprocedures.\u2002\n\nduring\u2002the\u2002negotiations,\u2002the\u2002office\u2002of\u2002the\u2002us\u2002Trade\u2002\nrepresentative\u2002(usTr)\u2002consults\u2002closely\u2002with\u2002the\u2002Cog\u2002and\u2002\nall\u2002committees\u2002of\u2002jurisdiction.\u2002\n\nbefore\u2002signing\u2002the\u2002agreement,\u2002the\u2002president\u2002reports\u2002\nto\u2002the\u2002revenue\u2002committees\u2002the\u2002proposed\u2002amendments\u2002\nto\u2002the\u2002us\u2019\u2002trade\u2002remedy\u2002laws\u2002and\u2002then\u2002notifies\u2002Congress.\u2002\nprivate\u2002sector\u2002advisory\u2002committees\u2002will\u2002thereafter\u2002submit\u2002\nreports\u2002to\u2002Congress,\u2002the\u2002president,\u2002and\u2002the\u2002usTr.\u2002\n\nwithin\u200260\u2002days\u2002from\u2002entering\u2002into\u2002the\u2002agreement,\u2002\n\nthe\u2002president\u2002submits\u2002to\u2002the\u2002Congress\u2002a\u2002list\u2002of\u2002the\u2002\nrequired\u2002amendments\u2002to\u2002us\u2002law.\u2002The\u2002international\u2002Trade\u2002\nCommission\u2002submits\u2002to\u2002the\u2002president\u2002and\u2002Congress\u2002an\u2002\nassessment\u2002of\u2002the\u2002impact\u2002of\u2002the\u2002fTa\u2002on\u2002the\u2002us\u2002economy\u2002\nand\u2002the\u2002industrial\u2002sectors.\n\nsource:\u2002us\u2002Trade\u2002representative\u2002website;\u2002pregelj\u2002(2005).\n\nnegotiators. 123 The initialled text then \nundergoes \u201clegal scrubbing\u201d to ensure \nthat it reflects or is consistent with what \nwas agreed on and intended during \nthe negotiations.

However, public \ndisclosure before signing promotes \ntransparency and provides an opportunity \nto clarify the contents of the agreement \nto the stakeholders. In some countries \n(e.g., Singapore), cabinet approval is \nmandatory before the FTA is signed. \nThe signing of the agreement makes the \nFTA internationally binding between the \nparties involved. \n\nWhether or not the agreement is \n\nalready in effect or enforceable depends \non the domestic laws of each country. \nAfter the agreement is signed, it is made \navailable to the public and notified to \nthe WTO. 125 Where required in some \ncountries, legislative ratification precedes \nthe notification to the WTO. \n\nRatification may or may not follow the \nsigning of the agreement.

Lack of \nproper legal and administrative measures \nor their delay could undermine the \neffectiveness of signed FTAs.\n\nThe FTA is enforced and monitored by \n\nimplementing and regulatory agencies \nwithin the country with the assistance of \noverseas trade promotion offices (which \ncollect information and concerns from \ntraders and private sector groups abroad). \nReports from these agencies and offices \nare useful in evaluating FTAs. \n\nMost FTAs provide for their (interim or \nmidterm) evaluation. On the basis of the \nassessments made by a review committee, \nthe FTA may be revised or amended \nthrough protocols to the agreement. \nThe amendment may require the same \nprocedures as those carried out when \nnegotiating an FTA, or a simple addendum \nor side letters to the agreement signed \nby the trade ministers, depending on \nthe nature and coverage of the proposed \nchanges.\n\n126  In Australia, after an agreement enters into force, it \n\nis recorded, archived, and published in the Australian \nTreaty Series and registered with the United  \nNations (UN).\n\n127  This notification is different from that made by a WTO \n\nmember to the WTO.\n\n\f11\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nPreParing for fTa negoTiaTions\n\nbox\u20023.2:\u2002\u2002 US Trade Strategy\n\nCountries, at least in principle, have \nestablished systematic criteria for entering \ninto an FTA and selecting an FTA partner. \nIn most cases, the decision to enter into \nan FTA is primarily motivated by political \nrather than economic considerations. \nNevertheless, each country needs a \nwell-defined FTA strategy to maintain \na consistent negotiating position and to \nguide its negotiators, especially where \nthe negotiating mandate is insufficient or \nambiguous. \n\ngeneral fTa strategy \n\nThe need for an FTA strategy cannot be \noveremphasized. For active FTA players, \nthe strategy states their primordial goal \nand approach to FTAs. For countries that \npassively enter into FTAs, it provides a \nframework for negotiating agreements \nthat achieve the country\u2019s national \neconomic development objectives, and \nensures the effective management of \nscarce resources and skills in trade \nnegotiation.

What are the \neconomic results?\n\nTo answer these questions, a country \n\nshould:\n\n(i)  Develop an economic model of \nthe economy in its present state \nand project the economic results \nof commitments made in various \nsectors.\n\n(ii)  Consult industry and trade \n\nassociations, consumer groups, \nfarmers and farm groups, \nNGOs, and other stakeholders, \nand ascertain their FTA needs, \nobjectives, and concerns. \n(iii)  Examine the objectives in terms \nof the country\u2019s trade relations \nwith other countries, the needs \nof stakeholders, and the country\u2019s \nWTO obligations.\n\n(iv)  View objectives from an economic \n\nperspective:\n(a)  Can the FTA be used to \n\npromote domestic economic \nreform and competition?\n(b)  Will exempting sectors from \ncoverage (protectionism) \nmake a domestic sector \ninefficient?\n\n(c)  Will exemptions raise the price \nof certain inputs and diminish \ncompetitiveness? \n\n(d)  Will exemptions protect \n\ninfant industries? Should long \ntransition periods be used to \nprotect such industries?\n\nIn effect, this exercise is a cost-benefit \n\nanalysis to evaluate the potential gains \n\nand losses from the FTA, and to shape an \nappropriate negotiating strategy. \n\nDetermining the scope and coverage  \nof the agreement\n\nConsistency with WTO Rules.  Almost \nall trading nations are either WTO \nmembers or in the accession process; \nhence, WTO rules also influence the \nchoice of strategies in trade negotiations. \nWTO rules provide opportunities for FTA \nmembers to protect key sectors. Members \ncan seek to exclude products from the \nagreement, or to liberalize the covered \nproducts through gradual or transitional \narrangements. A country must, however, \nstrike an agreement on exemptions and \nphase-in periods in its FTA negotiations, \nand must bear in mind that sectoral \nomissions and phase-in periods could \njeopardize the success of the negotiations \nand could have diverse short- and long-\nterm economic implications.\n\nThe WTO rules that are applicable \nto free-trade areas serve as minimum \nrequirements that all FTAs should \nmeet, and specific WTO disciplines are \na starting point for determining the \nscope and coverage of FTAs. The WTO \nAgreement permits FTAs, but subjects \nthem to conditions designed to ensure \nthat any free-trade area formed by \nthe parties has substantial coverage\u2014\nsufficient to justify the discrimination \nand trade distortion that is likely to result \nfrom the FTAs. 129 \n\nSpecifically, GATT Article XXIV sets \nforth rules for the formation of an FTA \nfor trade in goods. Many of the same \n\n129  As illustrated in Part I and II, the GATT and the \nUnderstanding provide that (i) a free trade area \nshould facilitate trade between the constituent \nterritories and not raise new barriers to trade with \nother WTO members outside the FTA; (ii) an FTA must \neliminate duties and restrictive commercial regulations \non \u201csubstantially all the trade\u201d between its members \nwith respect to products originating in their territories; \nand (iii) an interim agreement to establish an FTA \nmust include a plan and schedule for the formation of \nthe FTA within a reasonable length of time.\n\n\f11\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nbox\u20023.3:\u2002\u2002 Japan\u2019s FTA Strategy\n\nJapan\u2002views\u2002free\u2002trade\u2002agreements\u2002(fTas)\u2002as\u2002a\u2002means\u2002of\u2002broadening\u2002the\u2002scope\u2002of\u2002its\u2002economic\u2002relationships\u2002\nwith\u2002other\u2002countries\u2002while\u2002maintaining\u2002its\u2002commitment\u2002to\u2002the\u2002world\u2002Trade\u2002organization\u2002(wTo).\u2002it\u2002considers\u2002\neconomic,\u2002political,\u2002and\u2002diplomatic\u2002factors\u2002when\u2002promoting\u2002fTas,\u2002and\u2002is\u2002guided\u2002by\u2002the\u2002principle\u2002of\u2002conformity\u2002\nwith\u2002wTo\u2002agreements.\u2002Japan\u2002aims\u2002for\u2002a\u2002comprehensive\u2002agreement,\u2002based\u2002on\u2002its\u2002first\u2002bilateral\u2002fTa\u2002with\u2002\nsingapore.\u2002it\u2002maintains\u2002flexibility\u2002by\u2002considering\u2002\u201csingapore-plus\u201d\u2002or\u2002\u201csingapore-minus\u201d\u2002options.\u2002a\u2002selective\u2002\napproach\u2002is\u2002also\u2002possible,\u2002for\u2002advance\u2002agreement\u2002in\u2002specific\u2002areas\u2002such\u2002as\u2002investment\u2002and\u2002services.\u2002Japan\u2002has\u2002\nstrategic\u2002priorities\u2002in\u2002determining\u2002which\u2002fTas\u2002to\u2002negotiate,\u2002and\u2002has\u2002established\u2002specific\u2002objectives\u2002in\u2002each\u2002case.\u2002\nnegotiations\u2002with\u2002asean\u2002countries,\u2002for\u2002example,\u2002should\u2002offer\u2002a\u2002broad\u2002range\u2002and\u2002high\u2002degree\u2002of\u2002liberalization\u2002to\u2002\nensure\u2002economic\u2002integration\u2002comparable\u2002with\u2002that\u2002of\u2002other\u2002regions.\u2002Japan\u2002also\u2002uses\u2002fTas\u2002to\u2002promote\u2002economic\u2002\ndevelopment\u2002by\u2002incorporating\u2002aspects\u2002of\u2002development\u2002assistance\u2002in\u2002fTas\u2002with\u2002developing\u2002countries.\u2002\n\nTemplate of Japan\u2019s Economic Partnership Agreements\n\nChapters\n\nTrade\u2002in\u2002goods\nrules\u2002of\u2002origin\nCustoms\u2002procedures\npaperless\u2002trading\nmutual\u2002recognition\nTrade\u2002in\u2002services\n\nfinancial\u2002services\u2002\ncooperation\u2002\niCT\u2002\u2002\nenergy\nscience\u2002and\u2002technology\nHuman\u2002resource\u2002\ndevelopment\n\ninvestment\nmovement\u2002of\u2002natural\u2002\npersons\nintellectual\u2002property\ngovernment\u2002\nprocurement\nCompetition\n\nTrade\u2002and\u2002investment\u2002\npromotion\nsmall\u2002and\u2002medium\u2002\nenterprises\nbroadcasting\nTourism\n\nObjective\n\nliberalization\u2002and\u2002\nfacilitation\u2002\n\neconomic\u2002partnership\u2002\nand\u2002enhancement\n\nsource:\u2002\u2002ministry\u2002of\u2002foreign\u2002affairs\u2002of\u2002Japan.\u20022002.\u2002Japan\u2019s\u2002fTa\u2002strategy.\u2002october.\u2002available:\u2002www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/fta/\n\nstrategy0210.html\n\nrules are applicable to customs unions, \nand WTO decisions interpreting the \nrules applicable to customs unions may \nhave relevance for the negotiation of an \nFTA since both forms of regional trade \nagreements are often couched in similar \nlanguage. \n\nGATS Article V, on the other hand, sets \n\nforth rules for the scope and coverage \nof an FTA for trade in services. 130 \nFundamental decisions regarding the \nmodality of service commitments must be \n\n130  An economic integration agreement liberalizing trade \nin services among its members must have substantial \nsectoral coverage, and eliminate substantially all \ndiscrimination between or among the parties, in the \nsectors covered by (i) eliminating discriminatory \nmeasures; and/or (ii) prohibiting new or more \ndiscriminatory measures, either when the agreement \ntakes effect or within a reasonable time frame.\n\ntaken at the start of service negotiations. \nIn particular, the parties must decide \nwhether to use a \u201cpositive-list approach\u201d \nlike the WTO, or a \u201cnegative-list \napproach.\u201d (See extensive discussions in \nPart II of this reference book.)\n\nComplementing Economic and \nDevelopment Strategy.

Of the staff complement of 45 in \nthe authorized department of one of the \nadvanced countries in the region, around 15 \nare involved full time in a particular FTA. \n\n132  The ministries or departments of foreign affairs and \ntrade (in Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Republic of \nKorea, and New Zealand); the department or ministry \nof (international) trade and industry (in Malaysia, \nPhilippines, Singapore, and Viet Nam); the economic, \ntrade and industry, and foreign affairs ministries (in \nJapan); and the ministry of (foreign) commerce (in \nthe PRC, Pakistan, and Thailand).\n\nUsing information as a negotiation tool\n\nEffective negotiation depends on the \navailability of essential data and the \nquality of the impact analysis of the \n\n\fparT\u2002iii:\u2002 negoTiaTing,\u2002implemenTing,\u2002and\u2002evaluaTing\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenTs\u2002 |  119\n\nproposed FTA. Trade officials must be \nequipped with this information to make \ninformed decisions in the negotiations. \nNegotiators are not expected to be \ntechnical experts in all FTA aspects. \nBut they must at least have at hand the \nrelevant information, such as economic or \ntrade indicators and regulations not only \nof their country but also of the other party \n(see Box 3.4). 133 \n\nConducting a feasibility study to assess  \nthe prospective FTA\n\nThe feasibility study assessing the \nprospective FTA is conducted either \ninternally (within the ministry) or \nexternally (with the assistance of an \nindependent government think tank or \na private consulting firm). The study is \ncarried out at the national level in the \npre-negotiation stage or jointly with \nthe FTA counterpart through a joint \nstudy group (JSG). The JSG, which \nis composed of government officials, \neconomists, and business sector \nrepresentatives, is gathered to examine \npotential complementarities between the \nnegotiating countries in terms of further \ntrade and economic cooperation through \nthe FTA. The report and recommendations \nof the JSG are reviewed and studied \nclosely by a joint task force or joint \ncoordinating team (usually composed of \nmembers of the negotiating committee) \nfor negotiation purposes. \n\nFeasibility studies are conducted by \ngovernment, members of the academe, \nor groups of eminent persons endorsed \nby the government. In most countries, \nresearch institutions, law firms, and \nscholars are selected through private \ntendering to perform feasibility or \neconometric studies including CGE \nmodel analysis based on Global Trade \n\n133  Also to avoid being surprised or embarrassed at having \nto face a counterpart negotiator who knows more \nabout the laws and regulations of a particular country \nthan the country\u2019s own negotiators.\n\nAnalysis Project (GTAP) simulations. To \nsupplement the quantitative analysis \nof the impact of FTAs, some type of \nqualitative evaluation may be required. \nIn some countries, a domestic sensitivity \nanalysis is performed to assess the \nlikely impact of the FTA on producers, \nconsumers, and regulators before going \nthrough negotiation. Other types of \nstudies are sectoral impact studies, \npolitical and social impact analyses, \nenvironmental impact assessments, and \nreview of laws and regulations that are \nrelated to or that may be affected by \nthe FTA. Econometric modeling may be \ncommissioned by the government through \nexternal consultants, along with other \nqualitative assessments of the costs and \nbenefits of the proposed FTA.\n\nThe breadth and relevance of the \nfeasibility study, which takes from 6 \nmonths to a year to complete for bilateral \nFTAs (1\u20132 years for ASEAN-plus FTAs), \ndepend on the scope and coverage of \nthe proposed FTA and the length of its \nnegotiation. The feasibility study may be \nconducted once at the pre-negotiation \nor joint feasibility study stage, and again \nduring the negotiation process to gauge \nthe impact of the scenario presented at \nthe negotiation table.\n\nThe results of the feasibility studies are \n\nuseful but sometimes do not provide the \ndepth of sectoral or industry analysis and \ndetailed information required during the \nnegotiations. In this regard, the in-house \ncapacity of the trade teams or FTA units to \ndeliver up-to-date information at various \nstages of negotiations is crucial in coming \nup with appropriate bargaining positions. \nThe trade negotiators may also tap the \nresources of other government agencies \n(through interagency cooperation) and \nindustry and consumer groups (through \npublic-private partnership) on specific \nissues and technical matters.

The negotiators must be \nequipped with appropriate skills and \ninformation to be effective as mediators \nrather than mere messengers in the \nnegotiation. A clear reporting line is also \nimportant for effective decision making \nduring the negotiations.\n\norganizational structure\n\nMost countries establish committees at \nthree levels when entering into an FTA \n(Figure 3.2). At the highest level is the \nnational advisory council, 134 where policy \n\n134  Steering committee on international trade negotiations \n(Thailand) or ministerial or national team (Indonesia).\n\nand national priority issues related to FTAs \nare discussed. The council may comprise \npublic-private representatives, a legislative-\nexecutive committee, or a combination \nof the two. At the second level is the \ninteragency committee, which is composed \nof the cabinet members and agencies \naffected by and involved in the FTA \nnegotiations. Other countries may provide \nfor a subcommittee (for example, the FTA \nsupport committee in Thailand) to oversee \nFTA implementation, economic adjustment, \nand restructuring. Wide consultation is \nmanaged or conducted at these first two \nlevels. Some members of these committees \n(together with distinguished members of \nthe academe) are assigned or appointed to \nthe JSG to identify the benefits and losses \nfrom the proposed FTA, and recommend \nthe type and coverage of the agreement, if \ndeemed desirable. \n\nAt the third level is the negotiating \nteam, composed of the chief negotiator, \nco-chairpersons, and several sub-teams \nor working groups to negotiate with \ntheir government counterparts. In \nsome countries, a task force for each \nFTA negotiation is created, to conduct \nall aspects of research, analysis, and \nconsultation and even actual negotiations. \nKey members of each party\u2019s negotiating \nteam together compose the JCT.

In ASEAN-\nplus FTA negotiations, the organization \nstructure is similar, with at least one lead \nnegotiator from each member country \nassigned to each dialogue partner. \n\nThe chief negotiator is assisted by the \n\nco-chairpersons (director level), who \nhead the sub-teams or working groups. \nThe co-chairpersons usually come from \nministries and regulatory agencies with \nresponsibility for each chapter of the FTA, \nand may also be technical government \nexperts (see Box 3.5, for example). In \nthe case of Japan, the co-chairpersons \ncome from the Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs, to ensure a unified and consistent \nperspective during the negotiations. In \nfederal governments like the Australian \n\nGovernment, representatives of the \nstate governments are also part of the \nnegotiating team. Similarly, if negotiations \nare held abroad the negotiating team \nis supported by ambassadors and trade \nattach\u00e9s assigned thereto.\n\nThe sub-teams or working groups hold \nspecific and focused negotiations on each \nchapter or sector of the proposed FTA \nbefore these provisions are considered \nby the joint negotiating committee at the \nplenary. The members of each working \ngroup and their number vary depending \non the resources of the negotiating \ngovernments (in size, most negotiating \nteams from developing countries stand \nin a 1:2 to 1:4 ratio vis-\u00e0-vis their \ncounterparts from developed countries).\nGovernment officials in the legal \ndepartments undoubtedly play a crucial \nrole in the negotiating team. Aside from \nhandling or co-chairing working groups \non dispute settlements, competition \npolicies, intellectual property rights, and \ninstitutional provisions, lawyers or the \nlegal team warrant that the mandate to \nnegotiate and the conduct of negotiation \n\n\f1\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nis sanctioned by their constitution and \nis consistent with domestic laws; ensure \nthat FTA provisions are carefully drafted \n(consistent with the agreement and \nflexible enough for situations that are \nnot or could not have been reasonably \nforeseen during the negotiations); \nundertake proper and legal scrutiny \nof the complete draft; and classify the \nagreement and render a legal opinion on \nthe need to have it ratified. \n\nThe negotiators\u2019 mandate\n\nAfter the pre-negotiation consultations, \na mandate in the form of directives or \nnegotiating instructions is issued. In \nsome countries, government departments \nprepare a submission to the cabinet, \nand the cabinet, after considering the \noptions and recommendations, decides to \nnegotiate. In the US, the Bipartisan Trade \nPromotion Authority Act of 2002 serves \nas the President\u2019s official mandate to \nnegotiate FTAs. The negotiation mandate \ncontains government approval to proceed \nwith the formal negotiations, grants \nauthority to represent the government, \nand delimits the negotiating team\u2019s \nauthority (in terms of coverage of the \nagreement, negotiating position, and so \non). The negotiators\u2019 mandate may change \nfrom time to time. Negotiators need a clear \nmandate from their ministries or at least \na channel through which they can obtain \nthe mandate promptly. In some cases, the \nlack of authority of negotiators drags out \nthe negotiation process. Regular meetings \ninvolving all sectoral bodies may be \nconducted to guide the negotiating team \nand clarify or strengthen their mandate. \n\ninstance, while the Republic of Korea \nor Japan may assign a team of around \n50 persons to each FTA negotiation, the \ndeveloping country negotiating team \nis often less than half that number. \nMoreover, negotiators from developing \ncountries handle more than one important \narea of negotiation or even several FTA \nnegotiations, thereby causing conflicts \nand problems of overlapping sessions.\n\nAlthough the size of the negotiating \n\nteam could prove valuable in the \nnegotiations, the quality of the \nnegotiators (i.e., the appointment of \nthe right persons) and the consistency \nof the core team members are much \nmore important concerns. First, the \nnegotiators in each working group must \nbe capable of aligning the sectoral (or \ntheir agency\u2019s) position with the national \nnegotiating position by interacting \nregularly with other working groups \nand consulting with the interagency \ncommittee through the co-chairpersons or \nthe chief negotiator. The core negotiating \nteam must be retained as much as \npossible for consistency and faster \nresolution of outstanding issues. This \nwill make the negotiation process more \nefficient and serve the national interest. \nLastly, the members of the negotiating \nteam must have adequate technical, \ncommunication, and negotiating skills 135 \nto be effective negotiators and not mere \nemissaries every time a negotiating \nissue is presented at the table. Access to \ninformation and support from various \nsectors are also essential. \n\nQuantity and Quality of the  \nnegotiating Team \n\nIn a negotiation between a developed \nand a developing country, the latter is \nfaced with negotiating constraints. For \n\n135  Training and capacity building in the following areas \nwould be useful to negotiators: (i) formulation of \ninternational trade negotiation positions and strategy; \n(ii) trade regimes and negotiation of international \ntrade agreements; (iii) trade diplomacy and advocacy; \n(iv) policy and research analysis; (v) rules of WTO and \nother international agreements; and (vi) the art  \nof managing political pressure and stakeholders\u2019 \nagenda(s).\n\n\fparT\u2002iii:\u2002 negoTiaTing,\u2002implemenTing,\u2002and\u2002evaluaTing\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenTs\u2002 |  1\u0018\u0018\n\nbox\u20023.6:\u2002 ASEAN Approaches to Negotiation\n\nbox\u20023.7:\u2002 Negotiation Approach under the GATS\n\nassociation\u2002of\u2002southeast\u2002asian\u2002nations\u2002(asean)\u2002free\u2002\ntrade\u2002agreement\u2002(fTa)\u2002negotiations\u2002are\u2002characterized\u2002by\u2002\na\u2002sectoral\u2002approach\u2002to\u2002negotiations\u2014first,\u2002agreement\u2002is\u2002\nreached\u2002on\u2002trade\u2002in\u2002goods,\u2002followed\u2002by\u2002trade\u2002in\u2002services\u2002\nand\u2002investment\u2002liberalization.\u2002even\u2002though\u2002the\u2002dialogue\u2002\npartners\u2002are\u2002supposed\u2002to\u2002negotiate\u2002with\u2002asean\u2002as\u2002\na\u2002whole,\u2002negotiating\u2002with\u2002asean\u2002involves\u2002bilateral\u2002\nnegotiations\u2002between\u2002each\u2002asean\u2002member\u2002country\u2002\nand\u2002the\u2002dialogue\u2002partner.\u2002This\u2002type\u2002of\u2002negotiation\u2002is\u2002\ncrucial\u2002in\u2002cases\u2002of\u2002modalities\u2002and\u2002coverage\u2002of\u2002fTas,\u2002\nparticularly\u2002provisions\u2002on\u2002sensitive\u2002sectors.\u2002The\u2002process,\u2002\nhowever,\u2002tends\u2002to\u2002drag\u2002out\u2002the\u2002negotiation\u2002because\u2002the\u2002\nnegotiators,\u2002having\u2002to\u2002weigh\u2002national\u2002versus\u2002regional\u2002\nobjectives,\u2002find\u2002it\u2002difficult\u2002to\u2002reach\u2002consensus.\u2002\nsource:\u2002adb\u2002staff.\n\nTrade\u2002in\u2002services\u2002under\u2002the\u2002world\u2002Trade\u2002organization\u2002\n(wTo)\u2002has\u2002quite\u2002different\u2002negotiation\u2002dynamics\u2002in\u2002terms\u2002\nof\u2002commitments\u2002and\u2002rules.\u2002on\u2002one\u2002side\u2002is\u2002the\u2002bilateral\u2002\nnegotiation\u2002of\u2002specific\u2002national\u2002commitments,\u2002which\u2002\ntakes\u2002the\u2002form\u2002of\u2002a\u2002bilateral\u2002bargaining\u2002process\u2002based\u2002\non\u2002requests\u2002and\u2002offers,\u2002and\u2002on\u2002the\u2002other\u2002the\u2002multilateral\u2002\n(i.e.,\u2002collective)\u2002negotiation\u2002of\u2002the\u2002governing\u2002rules,\u2002\nwhich\u2002involves\u2002an\u2002effort\u2002to\u2002build\u2002consensus\u2002on\u2002broad\u2002\nprinciples\u2002among\u2002member\u2002countries.\u2002\n\nThe\u2002steps\u2002in\u2002negotiating\u2002a\u2002proposal\u2002under\u2002the\u2002\ngeneral\u2002agreement\u2002on\u2002Trade\u2002in\u2002services\u2002(gaTs)\u2002are\u2002as\u2002\nfollows:\n(i)\u2002 develop\u2002requests\u2002under\u2002the\u2002request\u2002or\u2002offer\u2002\n\n(ii)\u2002 formulate\u2002negotiating\u2002proposals\u2002on\u2002rules\u2002in\u2002the\u2002\n\nprocedure\u2002in\u2002the\u2002wTo.\n\ngaTs\u2002negotiation.\n\nThe negoTiaTion Process \n\n(iii)\u2002 negotiate\u2002sectoral\u2002and\u2002functional\u2002agreements.\n\nsource:\u2002monning\u2002and\u2002feketekuty\u2002(2003).\n\nlaying out the negotiation rules  \nand Timetable\n\nUnlike multilateral negotiations (i.e., \nwithin the WTO framework), FTA \nnegotiations follow no established or \ninternationally accepted procedure. They \ndiffer from country to country and may \nbe deduced from past practices, protocol, \nor prior agreements entered into by \nthe negotiating countries. At the very \nleast, the JCT must agree on the rules \nof proceeding with the negotiations. In \nterms of sequencing, the negotiators may \nadopt a sectoral approach (see ASEAN \nexample in Box 3.6), a dual approach \n(i.e., the modalities-and-rules approach \nin the GATS, Box 3.7), or a gradualist \napproach (from simpler to more complex \nissues). These are not the only options\u2014\nnegotiators sometimes agree to adopt a \ntemplate FTA (another FTA previously \nsigned by a party to the negotiation) \nand no longer negotiate items that are \nacceptable to both parties or are not \notherwise disputed. \n\nThe sequence of negotiations \n\nlogically affects the preparation of the \nindicative timetable for negotiations. \nThe timetable must be flexible enough \n\nto take delays into account, especially \nin the negotiation of modalities (where \nthe number of tariff lines is negotiated \nseparately from the list of products; see \nFigure 3.3 and discussions under trade \nin goods in Part II), sensitive sectors, \nand exclusions. It must also provide for \nadequate consultation with domestic \nstakeholders and significant committees \nwhen critical issues are considered. There \nis no universal deadline for negotiation of \nFTAs. However, in the US the time limit \nset for the trade promotion authority \nserves as deadline for its FTA negotiation. \nThe election cycle in many countries may \nalso be a deadline for FTA negotiations. \nNegotiators are likewise faced with \nresource constraints (especially when \nsome agencies are unable to attend \nnegotiation meetings) and strong pressure \nto conclude the negotiations quickly. \n\ninteragency coordination \n\nAside from providing a venue for \ngovernment departments to balance \nnational interests and industry- and \nsector-specific concerns, interagency \n\n\f1\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nfigure\u20023.3:\u2002 Tariff Elimination Modalities for Negotiating FTAs\n\nMODALITIES\n\nEarly-Harvest Scheme\n\nNormal Track\n\nSensitive Track\n\nImmediate Elimination\n\nSensitive List\n\nGradual/Phase-in\nElimination\n\nHighly Sensitive\nList/Exclusion\n\nsource:\u2002author\u2019s\u2002compilation\u2002from\u2002various\u2002free\u2002trade\u2002agreements\u2002(fTas).\n\ncoordination facilitates at least two \nsignificant processes that are useful in \nnegotiating and implementing FTAs. \nFirst, interagency coordination enables \nthe consolidation of all the sectoral \nconsultations of the different departments \nor agencies. Formal hearings are \nsometimes selective and infrequent, so \nthe national advisory council or trade \nnegotiation team can base its assessment \nonly on sectoral information provided by \nthe ministries or agencies. \n\nSecond, interagency coordination \n\nprovides the necessary link in FTA \nenforcement and monitoring. For \ninstance, the effective implementation \nof the trade facilitation provisions \nof an FTA requires interconnectivity \nand coordination among all cross-\nborder agencies (customs, sanitary and \nphytosanitary, inspection, and quarantine \nagencies). In most cases, interagency \ncoordination is required before FTA \nimplementation (to itemize the products \nto be included in each modality of \ntariff liberalization). The interagency \ncommittee may be ad hoc and organized \nfor each negotiation or may already be \nembedded in the government structure \n(see Boxes 3.8 and 3.9 for an overview \nof the interagency mechanisms in the US \nand the Republic of Korea).\n\nnegotiation Techniques, habits, and role \nof the chief negotiator \n\nThere are various negotiation techniques, \nmost of which can be learned through \npractice. Simulation exercises have been \n\nproven to be practicable and effective. In \nsome countries, junior trade officers learn \nby observing actual negotiations. Exposure \nto FTA issues and involvement in actual \nFTA negotiations are effective ways of \ndeveloping negotiation skills. Whatever \nthe strategy or approach adopted by a \nnegotiating team, certain guidelines and \nprotocols must be followed to achieve \nsmooth and successful negotiations (see \nBox 3.10). The chief negotiators on both \nsides must ensure this. \n\nMost countries appoint a separate \nchief negotiator for each FTA rather than \nendorsing one for several FTAs. The chief  \nnegotiator must be clear about the \ncountry\u2019s national trade interests, maintain \na strategic and holistic framework in the  \nnegotiations, and ensure that the country\u2019s \nnegotiating position is clearly understood \nby the counterpart.

Public stakeholders who define \nnational policies, implement government \nprograms and measures in all sectors, \nand deliver services to the public are \nsubjects of the first type. They are the \nmembers of the parliament, the cabinet, \nand regulatory agencies. In the second \ngroup are the private stakeholders, \ncomprising chambers of commerce, \ntrade groups, sector or industry \nrepresentatives, consumers, labor groups, \nNGOs, and the general public. The level \nof participation of these groups varies \n(and existing mechanisms tend to be \nbiased in favor of big pressure groups). \nAt the very least, all of these sectors \nshould be well represented during the \nnegotiations. \n\nConsultation mechanisms may be \nformal or informal. Formal consultations \nare institutionalized and involve the \nmembership and participation of public \nand private stakeholders in the advisory \ncouncil as well as in the interagency \ncommittee\u2019s FTA policy debates. Some \ncountries convene public hearings \nbefore the official negotiation. Informal \nconsultation is done through sectoral \npublic hearings, opinion surveys, outreach \nand regional seminars, and other means \n(e.g., through invitations for comments on \ngovernment websites). \n\nContrary to common perception, \n\nconsultation is not a stumbling block but \nrather a building block (by providing \ninputs and outputs) in the negotiation \nprocess. In terms of inputs, consultation \nserves as a venue for discussing the \nissues and concerns of various sectors, \nidentifying the key sensitive sectors, \nand managing conflict arising from the \nresistance posed by civil society and \nother vested groups. In some cases, \nstrong opposition from interest groups is \na defensive tool used to protect certain \nindustries during the negotiation. \n\nIn terms of outputs, consultation \nbecomes an instrument of advocacy for \n\n\fparT\u2002iii:\u2002 negoTiaTing,\u2002implemenTing,\u2002and\u2002evaluaTing\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenTs\u2002 |  1\u00187\n\nthe negotiators, not only in disseminating \ninformation on the FTA at various stages, \nbut also in soliciting stakeholder support \n(thereby assisting in the legitimation \nof the FTA), understanding technical \ninformation, and drafting effective \nand non-trade-restricting measures to \nimplement the FTA.\n\nAlthough the type of consultation may \n\nvary in the stage of the FTA process, it \nshould nonetheless be conducted from pre-\nnegotiation to amendment (Figure 3.4). \nDuring pre-negotiation, public hearings are \nconducted to make a general assessment \nof the impact of the FTA. When feasibility \nstudies are conducted, economic scholars, \ntechnical experts, and the business sector \nprovide specific and quantitative analyses \nof the FTA. Politically sensitive items \nand other critical issues are discussed \nwith the various stakeholders through \navailable channels during the negotiation. \nConsultations during the implementation \nof the FTA assist the regulators as well \nas end users of government and trade \nservices in improving the FTA-established \nmechanisms and in assessing whether or \nnot the objectives of the FTA have been \nachieved.\n\nThe resources needed and the \nmanner of consultation depends on \nthe value accorded to the process by a \ncountry. To attain the expected effects \ndescribed above, the consultation should \nbe sufficient to help the stakeholders \nunderstand what is being presented at \nthe negotiation and consult with their \nconstituencies on the pros and cons of \nthe proposals from their own perspective. \nThis guarantees representation of \nall interests in policy debate and \nformulation.\n\nconsultation mechanisms \n\nfigure\u20023.4:\u2002 When Consultation Should  \n\nBe Conducted\n\nPre-negotiation\nConsultation\n\nJoint Feasibility\nStudies\n\nAssessment and\nAmendment\n\nConsultation\nduring Negotiation\n\nEnforcement and\nMonitoring\n\nsource:\u2002adb\u2002staff.\n\ndown approach, where those at the \nhigher levels (e.g., ministries, chief \nexecutive officers) steer the flow of \nconsultation and, ultimately, decision \nmaking.

FTA is within the mandate of \nthe government. 139 These procedures, \nhowever, often unduly delay the FTA\u2019s \nimplementation and, hence, also the \nattainment of its expected benefits. The \nimplementation stage requires the active \ninvolvement of all government agencies \n\n139  This presupposes that the agreement is in accord with \nthe country\u2019s constitution or requires no constitutional \nchange.\n\nconcerned, if only to comply with the \ncountry\u2019s FTA commitments and gain from \nnew market opportunities. \n\nPre-implementation \n\nThe effectivity of an FTA depends on  \n(i) the \u201centry into force\u201d provision in the \nFTA, and (ii) the internal or domestic \nprocedures of the signatories. Depending \n\n\fparT\u2002iii:\u2002 negoTiaTing,\u2002implemenTing,\u2002and\u2002evaluaTing\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenTs\u2002 |  1\u00189\n\non the nature of the agreement, the FTA \nmay take effect on the date it is signed, or \non the date one party gives notice to the \nother party that it has complied with all \nthe legal requirements such as ratification \n(or the number of days after that notice \nis received by the other party), or on \nthe date the FTA becomes effective and \nbinding as domestic law. 140 The date of \neffectivity may also be agreed upon by the \nsigning parties.\n\nIn the case of AFTA, member countries \n\nhave different procedures for the FTA \nto be effective. While the act of signing \nby authorized officials (which could \nbe the president or the trade minister \nas the president\u2019s alter ego) would \nmake the AFTA effective in Brunei \nDarussalam, Malaysia, and Viet Nam, \nother ASEAN countries have additional \nrequirements: a letter of acceptance \nsigned by the President in the Philippines \nand Indonesia, and ratification by the \nlegislature in Thailand. In Singapore, all \nnecessary approval is obtained before \nsigning; hence, no ratification is needed. \n\nIn the US, after an agreement is \n\nconcluded, the US President is required \nto submit its final text to Congress \ntogether with the draft implementing bill, \na statement of any administrative action \nproposed to implement the agreement, \nand other supporting information. \nFailure to comply with this submission \nrequirement would prevent the agreement \nfrom entering into force. 141 \n\nRatification \n\nThe AFTA requirements, however, do \nnot apply to ASEAN-plus agreements or \nbilateral FTAs entered into by individual \n\nmember countries. Indonesia considers \nFTAs and all other international \nagreements (e.g., the WTO Agreement) \nas presidential decrees, thereby requiring \nin most cases, only the signature of the \nPresident. The Philippines, on the other \nhand, makes a distinction: agreements \nthat primarily involve the reduction of \ntariffs are executive agreements and need \nnot go through legislative ratification, \nbut FTAs that are comprehensive in scope \n(covering items that could be subject to \nlegal enactments or are constitutionally \nmandated) require legislative \nconcurrence. Still, even if legislative \nratification is not required, strong \npolitical pressure would necessitate \u201cprior \nendorsement\u201d of the legislature if only to \nlegitimize the FTA (as in the case of the \nNew Zealand\u2013Singapore FTA). 142 \n\nIn Japan, executive agreements can \n\nbe concluded by the executive under \nits power to manage foreign affairs. \nHowever, treaties that require the \nmaintenance or adoption of legislative \nmeasures for their implementation or \ndeal with financial matters require the \napproval of the Diet. 143 In the same vein, \nother Asian countries like Georgia have \nmade it obligatory to ratify international \ntreaties and agreements that require \na change in domestic legislation or \nthe adoption of laws and acts with the \nforce of law to honor the international \nobligations undertaken. 144 If an \nagreement requires no change in domestic \nlegislation, it may be accepted without \nparliamentary ratification.\n\nIn the US, Congress has delegated \nthe tariff-negotiating authority to the \nPresident and authorized the latter to \nsuspend existing duty-free treatment. By \nvirtue of this delegation and the doctrine \n\n140  For example, when the FTA has provisions affecting \nthe rights and obligations of citizens or imposes \npenalties, due process requires notice or publication. \nThe FTA takes effect only after the publication \nrequirements have been complied with. In this \ncase international agreements have the standing of \ndomestic law.\n141  Pregelj (2005).\n\n142  The New Zealand Constitution provides that the \nParliament has no power to delay or alter an \ninternational agreement or ratify one. The Parliament \nonly takes into consideration the FTA to identify and \nprovide for necessary changes to law.\n\n143  Japan\u2019s two-house Parliament.\n144  Article 65, Constitution of Georgia.\n\n\f1\u00180\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nbox\u20023.12:\u2002 Australia\u2019s Treaty Approval Process\n\nThe\u2002australian\u2002treaty\u2002approval\u2002process\u2002involves\u2002the\u2002\nfollowing\u2002steps\u2002for\u2002all\u2002treaty\u2002actions\u2002(negotiating\u2002a\u2002new\u2002\ntreaty,\u2002amending\u2002an\u2002existing\u2002one,\u2002or\u2002abrogating\u2002a\u2002treaty):\n\n(i)\u2002 The\u2002preparation\u2002of\u2002a\u2002national\u2002interest\u2002analysis\u2002(nia),\u2002\n\nwhich\u2002sets\u2002out\u2002the\u2002advantages\u2002and\u2002disadvantages\u2002\nto\u2002australia\u2002of\u2002becoming,\u2002or\u2002not\u2002becoming,\u2002a\u2002party\u2002\nto\u2002the\u2002treaty,\u2002including\u2002the\u2002significant\u2002quantifiable\u2002\nand\u2002foreseeable\u2002economic\u2002and\u2002environmental\u2002\neffects\u2002of\u2002the\u2002treaty.\u2002among\u2002several\u2002other\u2002points,\u2002\nthe\u2002nia\u2002must\u2002detail\u2002the\u2002consultations\u2002that\u2002have\u2002\ntaken\u2002place\u2002with\u2002the\u2002states\u2002and\u2002territories,\u2002and\u2002with\u2002\ncommunity\u2002and\u2002other\u2002interested\u2002partners.\n\n(ii)\u2002 The\u2002preparation\u2002of\u2002a\u2002regulatory\u2002impact\u2002statement,\u2002\nincluding\u2002an\u2002assessment\u2002of\u2002the\u2002impact\u2002of\u2002the\u2002\u2002\nproposed\u2002regulation\u2002(i.e.,\u2002the\u2002treaty)\u2002and\u2002its\u2002\u2002\nalternatives\u2002on\u2002different\u2002groups\u2002and\u2002the\u2002\ncommunity\u2002as\u2002a\u2002whole.\n\n(iii)\u2002 The\u2002tabling\u2002of\u2002the\u2002treaty\u2002before\u2002parliament\u2002for\u200220\u2002\n\nsitting\u2002days\u2002and\u2002consideration\u2002of\u2002the\u2002proposed\u2002\ntreaty\u2002action\u2002by\u2002the\u2002Joint\u2002standing\u2002Committee\u2002on\u2002\nTreaties.\n\n(iv)\u2002 The\u2002preparation\u2002and\u2002passage\u2002of\u2002the\u2002enabling\u2002\n\nlegislation.\n\nsource:\u2002goode\u2002(2005).\n\nof political agency, negotiators (with the \napproval of the President and designated \npolitical appointees of the President) \ncan commit to an executive agreement \nwithout the approval of the Congress, \nbut not to a treaty or an agreement that \nchanges US law. An agreement classified \nas a treaty must be ratified by two thirds \nof the US Senate, while an agreement that \nchanges US law must be approved by a \nmajority of both houses of Congress. 145\nFTAs are considered as treaties in \n\nAustralia, so the FTA must undergo treaty \napproval (see Box 3.12). After treaty \napproval and when the agreement enters \ninto force it is recorded, archived, and \npublished in the Australian Treaty Series \nand registered with the UN.\n\n145  Monning and Feketekuty (2003). See also Grimmett \n\n(2004) and Pregelj (2005).\n\nWTO notification \n\nA mandatory action for WTO members \nsigning an FTA is to notify the agreement \nto the WTO. The following rules govern \nthe notification procedure: \n\n(i)  The Decision on the Transparency \nMechanism for Regional Trade \nAgreements, which calls for \nan early announcement by \nmembers participating in FTA \nnegotiations; 146 and \n(ii)  GATT Article XXIV:7; the \n\nUnderstanding; and GATS \nArticle V:7, which provides that \na member must notify the WTO \nand submit details to the WTO \nregarding FTAs and interim \nagreements that the member is \njoining or intends to join.\n\nNotification under the WTO may \nbe under the Enabling Clause, GATT \nArticle XXIV, or GATS Article V, 147 and \nmay be made to the WTO\u2019s Committee \non Regional Trade Agreements (those \nFTAs falling under GATT Article XXIV \nand GATS Article V) or to its Committee \non Trade and Development (FTAs falling \nunder the Enabling Clause). The types \nof agreements notified are preferential \narrangements, free-trade agreements, \ncustoms unions, service agreements, and \naccession to any of these agreements. \nAfter the required notification, a working \n\n146  It also requires parties to specify the provision(s) of \n\nthe WTO Agreement under which the FTA is notified, \nand to provide the full text of the FTA and any related \nschedules, annexes, and protocols, in one of the WTO \nofficial languages (English, French, and Spanish).\n147  WTO rules for trade in goods are found in Article \nXXIV of the GATT, and for trade in services, in \nArticle V of the GATS. The Enabling Clause allows \ndeveloped countries to accord more favorable \ntreatment to developing countries without according \nsuch treatment to other countries. It also applies \nto preferential trade arrangements (PTAs) or FTAs \nbetween developing countries but not PTAs and FTAs \nbetween developed and developing countries. See \nFiorentino et al.

Furthermore, \nperiodic reports on the operation of \nthe FTAs, including significant changes \nand developments in the agreements, \nare required. A new regional trade \nagreement (RTA) transparency \nmechanism was adopted on a provisional \nbasis in 2006. This refers to the early \nannouncement of RTA and notification to \nWTO (see Figure 3.5 for the major steps \ninvolved). \n\nimplementation \n\nLegislative enactments and amendments\n\nenactment or amendment of laws may be \nmade by the president\u2019s office. \n\nThe laws to be passed or amended \nare those covered by the FTAs that affect \nthe rights and obligations of the citizens \nof the FTA member country. These \nlaws either translate the international \nagreement into domestic law or clarify the \nissues presented in the new arrangement. \nThis is especially the case where some \nrestrictions are lifted or foreign entities \nare given preferential treatment by the \nFTA (see Box 3.13 for an example of legal \nchanges adopted as a result of entering \ninto an FTA). These new or amended laws \nare complemented by implementing rules \nand regulations, as discussed in the next \nsection. \n\nMost countries pass new legislation or \namend existing laws to comply with \ntheir FTA commitments or to extend \npreferential treatment to traders from FTA \ncountries. These procedures are necessary \nfor FTAs to be effective as domestic laws \nand to fill the gaps left by the general \nprovisions and even the implementation \narrangements provided in the FTAs. \n\nThe legislative enactment presupposes \n\nthat the FTA is consistent with the \nconstitution and has passed the \nratification stage. It is worth noting that \nthe procedure and voting requirement \nwhen ratifying an FTA may be different \nfrom the requirement for passing \nlegislation to implement the FTA. In \nsome countries where the president has \nlegislative powers, the requisite legislative \n\nDirectives, issuances, and regulations \n\nEven after an FTA takes effect (and the \nrequisite laws are passed or amended), \nsome administrative procedures still \nneed to be carried out to fulfill the \nrequirements of the FTA. Some FTAs \ndraw out uniform operational guidelines \nin implementing the customs procedure \nand rules of origin mechanism. In the \nPhilippines, the executive order from the \nPresident is followed by issuances from \nthe finance department and guidelines \nfrom the customs bureau.

The procedures are \nmore complex (where implementing rules \nand regulations follow a law that has \nbeen passed or amended) to implement \nthe nontariff provisions of the FTA (e.g., \nservices or investment liberalization \nprovisions). \n\nThe directives, issuances, or \n\nregulations should serve as essential \nguides for regulators as well as traders/\nindividuals especially in availing \nthemselves of the preferences given \nunder the FTA. They should not be too \nstringent or complicated so as to restrict \nor discourage the business sector from \ntaking advantage of what the FTA has  \nto offer. \n\naustralia\u2002\nJapan\u2002\u2002\n\nsingapore\u2002\u2002\n\nThailand\u2002\u2002\n\nwww.fta.gov.au/\u2002\nwww.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/fta/\nindex.html\nwww.iesingapore.gov.sg/wps/portal/\nfTa\nwww.thaifta.com/english/index_eng.\nhtml\u2002\n\nunited\u2002states\u2002\u2002 www.ustr.gov/Trade_agreements/\nsection_index.html\n\nsource:\u2002author\u2019s\u2002compilation.\n\nPublic information \n\nInformation dissemination has always \nbeen crucial in the implementation of an \nagreement. For instance, many observers \nhave attributed the low utilization of \npreferential tariff rates to the lack of \ninformation on the AFTA tariff scheme. 148 \nThe fact that the newly signed FTA \nwill not impose any undue burden on \nexporters who value the reduction or \nelimination of nontariff barriers more \nthan differential tariff rates should also be \nhighlighted. \n\nInformation dissemination is \ntraditionally conducted through \nbrochures, newspapers and other \npublications, seminars, road shows, and \ntrade discussions. However, there are \nmodern approaches to introducing FTA \nto the public, including disseminating \ninformation through FTA websites (see \nBox 3.14 for a list of FTA websites). \nThese sites are useful not only in \nproviding one-stop online resource \nsites on the FTAs entered into by the \ncountry but also in soliciting feedback \nor conducting public consultation \non proposed FTAs. FTA sites may \nalso provide additional assistance by \npublishing the names of those who \n\n148  Other reasons given for the low utilization rate are \n\nthe minimal margin between WTO or MFN rates and \ncommon effective preferential tariff (CEPT) rates, and \nthe additional procedures required.\n\n\fparT\u2002iii:\u2002 negoTiaTing,\u2002implemenTing,\u2002and\u2002evaluaTing\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenTs\u2002 |  1\u0018\u0018\n\ncan render expert advice to exporters \n(e.g., in Singapore and Australia). In \nAustralia, an FTA export advisory panel \nhas been established to promote the \nbenefits of FTAs, by offering advice \non implementation and market access \nissues, and by identifying specific trade \nand investment opportunities created by \nsuch agreements. The panel is made up \nof senior representatives from a range of \nindustry groups and includes input from \na cross-section of specialists, business \norganizations, and community groups.\n\nevaluaTing an fTa \n\nThe review clauses of FTAs provide \nan opportunity to identify areas \nwhere the agreements can be further \nimproved. This stage, however, requires \nproper mechanisms for monitoring \nand evaluation to assess whether the \nobjectives of the FTA have been met in \nthe first place and whether the scope of \nthe agreement can be expanded and its \nterms improved.\n\nmonitoring and enforcement \n\nCompliance monitoring requires \nresources and intensive effort not only \nfrom the lead agency but especially \nfrom the implementers and regulators. \nIn the US, monitoring is primarily done \nby the same agency that negotiates FTA, \nalthough several other agencies, both \ndomestic and overseas, are likewise \ninvolved (see Box 3.15). \n\nIn most countries, monitoring is \n\nlodged with the implementing agencies. \nCoordination among agencies is essential \nespecially between those agencies that \nwill put into operation the provisions \nof the agreements and those that will \neventually review the agreements and \nprovide for the necessary amendments. \n\nFor example, although valuable, data on \nthe actual utilization of the FTA are not \nalways readily available. The directive to \nbe issued by the customs or tariff agency \ncould require traders that avail themselves \nof preferential rates under the FTA to \nreport such use on the specified form \ndirectly to a specific unit or agency, to \nfacilitate recording and monitoring. Such \ninformation will be handy in evaluating \nthe impact of FTAs on traders. \n\nOther possible mechanisms for \n\nmonitoring and compliance are regular \nconsultations with the private sector and \nfull use of the technology (such as the \ninternet and available mobile services) \nto gather comments from other sectors \nincluding consumers.\n\nassessment and evaluation \n\nSome FTAs provide review clauses to \nanalyze the impact or progress of their \nimplementation. Most countries use \ngeneral indicators to assess the economic \nimpact of FTAs, from macroeconomic \nindicators (in the Republic of Korea) \nto industry utilization indicators (in \nSingapore). The review, however, is often \nlimited to analyzing whether tariff cuts \nhave been made or whether the FTA has \nresulted in an increase in trade volume \nor growth in market shares between the \nFTA partners. The use of these indicators \nshould be approached with caution since \ntrade expansion need not be a direct \nresult of the tariff liberalization and may \nbe caused by other factors beyond what \nis covered by the FTA. There is also a \ngrowing interest in assessing FTAs by \nexamining the existence or nonexistence \nof nontariff barriers to trade.\n\nAnother important aspect is identifying \n\nthe proper agency to evaluate the \nFTAs. While some countries designate a \nspecialized body, in others trade-related \ninstitutes or other organizations conduct \nannual studies on the economic effects of \n\n\f1\u0018\u0018\u2002 |\u2002 How\u2002To\u2002design,\u2002negoTiaTe,\u2002and\u2002implemenT\u2002a\u2002free\u2002Trade\u2002agreemenT\u2002in\u2002asia\n\nbox\u20023.15:\u2002\u2002 US Monitoring and Enforcement System\n\nThe\u2002monitoring\u2002and\u2002enforcement\u2002of\u2002trade\u2002agreements\u2002of\u2002the\u2002us\u2002involves\u2002four\u2002agencies\u2002and\u2002several\u2002\nunits\u2002within\u2002each\u2002agency.\u2002each\u2002agency\u2002has\u2002both\u2002domestic\u2002and\u2002overseas\u2002components,\u2002as\u2002well\u2002as\u2002several\u2002\ngeographic,\u2002industry,\u2002and\u2002issue-specific\u2002units\u2002involved\u2002in\u2002monitoring\u2002and\u2002enforcement.\u2002The\u2002agencies\u2002\ncoordinate\u2002monitoring\u2002and\u2002enforcement\u2002activities\u2002through\u2002an\u2002interagency\u2002network\u2002for\u2002trade\u2002policy\u2002\ndevelopment\u2002led\u2002by\u2002the\u2002office\u2002of\u2002the\u2002us\u2002Trade\u2002representative\u2002and\u2002involving\u2002at\u2002least\u200217\u2002federal\u2002agencies.\u2002To\u2002\nimprove\u2002interagency\u2002coordination,\u2002a\u2002regular\u2002forum\u2002is\u2002provided\u2002to\u2002allow\u2002federal\u2002agencies\u2002to\u2002share\u2002and\u2002discuss\u2002\ninformation,\u2002set\u2002priorities,\u2002assign\u2002responsibilities,\u2002and\u2002design\u2002and\u2002implement\u2002strategies.\u2002Trade\u2002agencies\u2002take\u2002\nadvantage\u2002of\u2002technology\u2002(through\u2002e-mail\u2002and\u2002videoconferencing)\u2002to\u2002communicate\u2002information\u2002on\u2002trade\u2002\ncompliance\u2002issues.\n\nAgency\n\nMain Unit at Headquarters\n\nOverseas and Other Units Involved\n\nus\u2002Trade\u2002\nrepresentative\n\nCommerce\n\nmonitoring\u2002and\u2002enforcement\u2002unit\n\nmarket\u2002access\u2002and\u2002Compliance\u2002\noffice\n\nstate\n\nTrade\u2002policy\u2002and\u2002programs\n\nagriculture\n\nforeign\u2002agricultural\u2002service\n\nsource:\u2002us\u2002government\u2002accountability\u2002office\u2002(2005).\n\nus\u2002mission\u2002to\u2002the\u2002world\u2002Trade\u2002organizations\u2002\n(wTo);\u2002trade\u2002policy\u2002officers;\u2002wTo\u2002and\u2002\nmultilateral\u2002affairs;\u2002region-specific\u2002offices\n\nTrade\u2002promotion\u2002agencies;\u2002foreign\u2002\nCommercial\u2002service;\u2002market\u2002access\u2002and\u2002\ncompliance\u2002officers\u2002overseas;\u2002manufacturing\u2002\nservices;\u2002import\u2002administration;\u2002patent\u2002and\u2002\nTrademark\u2002office\n\neconomic\u2002section\u2002of\u2002embassies;\u2002country\u2002desk\u2002\nstaff;\u2002issue-specific\u2002task\u2002forces\n\nanimal\u2002and\u2002plant\u2002Health\u2002inspection\u2002service;\u2002\nfood\u2002safety\u2002and\u2002inspection\u2002service\n\nFTAs. Often the foreign affairs ministry \nis responsible for both implementing \nand evaluating FTAs. The frequency of \nreviews depends on each specific FTA. \nFor example, the joint committee under \nthe Australia-US FTA is supposed to \nmeet annually to supervise the overall \nimplementation of the agreement.\n\nEven if the importance of this stage \nis well recognized among the countries, \nmanpower and other resources are \noften limited. With this constraint, it is \nimportant to remember that there should \nbe an independent assessment of the FTAs. \nAt the very least, those who were directly \ninvolved in the negotiations should not be \nthe ones who evaluate the FTAs. \n\namendment Procedures\n\nLike the review clauses, most FTAs have \nsections on amendments and modification. \nThese amendments may take the form \nof exchanges of notes and protocol \nagreements. Where no substantial change \nis introduced, these protocols require \nonly the endorsement of the parties (i.e., \nthe signature of the trade ministers). \nThere are countries that require cabinet \napproval, depending on the changes to \nbe introduced. Some FTA amendments \nundergo the same domestic procedure \nas treaty amendments. In certain cases, \namending FTAs involves ministerial \napproval and legislative change.\n\n\fappendix to Part iii:  sample Questionnaire on the \nnegotiation, implementation, and evaluation of  \nfree Trade agreements\n\nPreparing for fTa negotiations\n\n(1)  Please choose the kind of FTA \n\nnegotiation strategy that you use and \nidentify its main components:\n\nType \n\ngeneral\u2002\nfTa\u2002\nnegotiation\u2002\nstrategy\n\ndifferent\u2002\nstrategy\u2002\nper\u2002fTa/\npartner\n\nMain Components\n\neconomic\u2002objective\n\npolitical\u2002consideration\n\nCoverage\u2002of\u2002fTa\n\nsensitive\u2002sectors\u2002to\u2002be\u2002\nprotected\n\nsequencing\u2002of\u2002\nnegotiation*\n\nothers\u2002(please\u2002specify)\n\n*\u2002e.g.,\u2002trade\u2002in\u2002goods\u2002first,\u2002then\u2002trade\u2002in\u2002services\u2002and\u2002\ninvestment.\u2002\n\n(2)  Who is responsible for formulating your \ntrade (or FTA) negotiation strategy?\n\nlegislature\n\npresident/executive\u2002department\u2002\n\nspecialized\u2002body\u2002(such\u2002as\u2002trade\u2002\nrepresentative\u2002office)\n\nothers\u2002(please\u2002specify)\n\n(3)  Do you have written laws, directives, \nguidelines, or policies regarding your \nFTA negotiation strategy?

Its mission is to help its developing member \ncountries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s \nmany successes, it remains home to two thirds of the world\u2019s poor. Nearly 1.7 billion people in the region \nlive on $2 or less a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.\n     Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for \nhelping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, \nand technical assistance. In 2007, it approved $10.1 billion of loans, $673 million of grant projects, and \ntechnical assistance amounting to $243 million.\n\nHow to Design, Negotiate, and Implement a\n\nFree Trade Agreement in\n\nASIA\n\nH\no\nw\n\n \n\n \nt\no\nD\ne\ns\ni\ng\nn\n\n,\n \n\nN\ne\ng\no\nt\ni\na\nt\ne\n,\n \na\nn\nd\n \nI\n\nm\np\n\nl\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \na\n \nF\nr\ne\ne\n \nT\nr\na\nd\ne\n \nA\ng\nr\ne\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \ni\n\n \n\nn\nA\n\ns\ni\na\n\nAsian Development Bank\n6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City\n1550 Metro Manila, Philippines\nwww.adb.org\nPublication Stock No. BBK-119108\nISBN: ISBN 978-971-561-684-3\n\nPrinted in the Philippines\n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "How to Design, Negotiate, and Implement a \nFree Trade Agreement in Asia\n", "Office of Regional Economic Integration\n", "April 2008\n"]}
