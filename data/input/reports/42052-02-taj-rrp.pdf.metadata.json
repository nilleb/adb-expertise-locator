The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE CORRIDOR \n\n \n2. \nThe  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program  has  developed  a \ntransport and trade facilitation strategy and action plan covering short-, medium-, and long-term \ninvestments across six road and rail corridors across the region. The aim is to improve regional \nconnectivity, cut transport costs, and increase competitiveness. The CAREC Corridor 3 covers \nalmost 7,000 kilometers (km) of roads and runs in the north\u2013south direction, linking the Russian \nFederation  to  the  Persian  Gulf.  Tajikistan  is  one  of  the  key  transit  points.  However,  several \nsections in the country are in bad shape and incomplete. Moreover, facilities at border crossing \npoints  are  inadequate  and  cross-border  procedures  inefficient.  As  a  small  and  sparsely \npopulated  country,  Tajikistan  depends  on  the  corridor  for  investment,  job  creation,  trade,  and \nultimately economic growth and poverty reduction. Export-driven agriculture accounts for 37% of \ntotal  employment  and  23%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  Aluminum  exports  are  equally \nimportant. These two activities need the CAREC Corridor 3 to reach regional and international \nmarkets\u2014the  nearest  seaport  for  Tajikistan  is  more  than  3,000  km  away.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  have  completed  rehabilitation  of \nclose  to  90%  of  CAREC  Corridor  3  sections  within  Tajikistan. 2 However,  various  important \nsections  are  still  unrepaired.  These  stretch  from  Dushanbe  to  the  Uzbekistan  border  and \namount to 62 km in total\u2014with an estimated investment of close to $200 million. \n  \n3. \nfor \nReconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  to  finance  these  corridor  sections.  The  EBRD  will \nsupport one section close to the capital (Avicenna Monument\u2013West Gate section, from km 0 to \nkm 5)  and  ADB  will  provide  the  rest  of  the  network  up  to  the  Uzbekistan  border.  The \ngovernment  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  several  soft  infrastructure  components,  including \nimproving  infrastructure  and  facilities  at  the  Dusti  border  crossing  point  with  Uzbekistan,  and \nproject management assistance. The financing plan for the Tajikistan section of Corridor 3 is in \nTable 1. \n\nThe  Government  of  Tajikistan  has  asked  ADB  and \n\nthe  European  Bank \n\nTable 1: Corridor 3 (Tajikistan Section) Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank (Asian Development Fund)  \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nGovernment of Tajikistan \n        Total \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nLength \nkm 5\u2013km 62 \nkm 0\u2013km 5 \n\n \n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n120.0 \n27.0 \n39.0 \n186.0 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n\n64 \n15 \n21 \n100 \n\n                                                 \n1   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe project is part of the government\u2019s 2010\u20132011 Public Investment Program3 and fits \n4. \nwith the ADB country partnership strategy for Tajikistan, 2010\u20132014.4 It is also an integral part \nof  the  CAREC  transport  and  trade  facilitation  strategy  and  action  plan,  2008\u20132018. 5  The \nregional dimension is now fully embedded in national planning in Tajikistan. \n \n5. \nCorridor sections. The road from Dushanbe to the border with Uzbekistan crosses the \nGissar  valley  and  the  town  of  Tursunzade  (km  5\u2013km  62)\u2014two  busy  and  growing  agricultural, \nindustrial,  and  commercial  points  in  Tajikistan.  Gissar  has  the  highest  agricultural  output  in \nTajikistan,  comprising  cotton,  grain,  fruits,  and  vegetables\u2014all  important  exports.6 Tursunzade \nis  home  to  Central  Asia\u2019s  largest  aluminum  processing  plant7 and  several  small  light  industry \nclusters\u2014ceramics, brick, cable and cotton-ginning, and cleaning\u2014employing 10,000 people. A \nquarter of Tajikistan\u2019s cross-border vehicles and freight pass through the Dusti border crossing \npoint.  However,  the  condition  of  the  road  from Dushanbe  to  the  Dusti border  crossing  point  is \ndeteriorating and needs rehabilitation. \n \n6. \nSector strategy and reforms. The National Development Strategy, 2006\u20132015 targets \nrapid improvements to the country\u2019s transport infrastructure, related services, and maintenance. \nA sector road map and investment program supports the strategy. Institutionally, a restructured \nMinistry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) has been mandated to execute investments \nunder the road map. The rest of the institutional setup includes legal and regulatory frameworks \nand improved procurement systems. The sector also benefits from the work of various institutes \ncovering  design  and  quality  control.  The  budget  process  has  been  refined  and  includes \nsystematic provisions for capital investment, operation, and maintenance. The budget has been \nincreasing  by  18%  annually  since  2004.  A  road  safety  program,  2009\u20132013  is  in  place  and  is \nbeing  implemented  satisfactorily.  The  country\u2019s  road  accident  rate  has  fallen\u2014it  is  the  lowest \namong the 10 members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The MOTC is working on \npilot performance-based contracts for routine maintenance works, which is a new but important \ninitiative  in  the  country.  The  objective  is  to  maintain  the  quality  and  life  of  assets  while \ncontaining costs. The works will be outsourced to the private sector to perform a large share of \nthis work. \n \n7. \nDespite significant progress in the planning, policy, institutional, maintenance, oversight, \nand funding areas, the transport sector remains affected by several gaps which are summarized \nbelow. \n \n\n(i) \n\nTolling.  Road  sector  investment  and  maintenance  will  need  the  private  sector. \nThe  government  introduced  tolling  on  a  Dushanbe\u2013Khujand\u2013Chanak  (350  km) \nroad  on  31  March  2010.  The  performance  of  this  road  is  being  assessed  but \nwork is at an early stage. \n\n                                                 \n3   Government Regulation 641, \u201cThe State Investment Program for Grants and Capital Construction for 2010\u20132011,\u201d \n\nincludes the construction of the Dushanbe\u2013Uzbekistan border road. \n\n4  ADB. 2010. Country Partnership Strategy: Tajikistan, 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2008. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy. Manila. \n6   The project area produces 61% of the country\u2019s fruits, 12% of vegetables, and 28% of meat, although it has only \n\n9% of the total sown area on less than 3% of the country\u2019s land area. \n\n7   This is Tajikistan's main industrial asset. The country has no aluminum ore, so the raw material for the plant has to \n\nbe imported.  \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\nContract  modalities.  The  public  and  private  sectors  require  predictable  and \nrobust contract modalities. The MOTC still applies too many different modalities, \nespecially  regarding  project  management,  construction,  and  maintenance.  This \naffects transparency, competition, and efficiency. It also limits the private sector\u2019s \ninterest in the sector. \n\nRoad  database.  Investment  and  maintenance  planning  need  a  good  database \ncovering  traffic  count,  road  conditions,  accidents,  etc.  The  current  database  is \ninadequate and incomplete. \n\nFunding.  Capital  investment  and  maintenance  finance  requires  substantial  and \npredictable  funding.  The  budget  has  been  constrained  by  the  recent  economic \ncrisis.  Although  this  is  improving,  much  of  the  funding  still  relies  on  external \nsources.  A  more  sustainable  system  is  required,  particularly  for  maintenance. \nPerformance-based contracts and road funds are under consideration to address \nthis problem. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n8. \nUnder  the  project,  ADB  will  provide  finance  to  help  the  MOTC  address  some  of  these \nissues.  Training  will  be  provided  to  support  work  in  other  areas  specified  under  the  Transport \nSector  Master  Plan.8 Further,  ADB  will  assist  with  measures  to  mitigate  specific  governance \nrisks identified in the sector governance assessment report.9 \n \n9. \nThe  project design  incorporates  the key  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in the \ntransport  sector  in  Tajikistan  and  other  Central  Asian  countries.  These  lessons  include  (i) \nobtaining  the  government\u2019s  financing  assurances  for  adequate  funding  for  maintenance  of  the \nproject road, and for increases in financing of road maintenance; (ii) using advance contracting \nand  retroactive  financing  to  avoid  initial  implementation  delays;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the \nexecuting agency\u2019s project implementation capacity with provision of consulting services. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe project will increase national and regional trade, and further economic growth. The \nproject outcome will be improved connectivity and mobility along the Tajikistan sections of the \nCAREC Corridor 3. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe outputs will comprise (i) reconstructed and upgraded road sections from Dushanbe \nto Tursunzade to the Uzbekistan border (km 5\u2013km 62); (ii) improved infrastructure and facilities \nat  the  Dusti  border  crossing  point;  and  (iii)  developed  gender  and  border  communities  and \nimproved road operations. \n \n12. \nThe  first  part  of  the  road  investment  will  be  centered  on  the  West  Gate\u2013Tursunzade \nsection  (km  5\u2013km  50),  which  is  currently  classified  category  II.10 The  project  will  upgrade  it  to \ncategory  I\u2014equivalent  to  a  four-lane  international  design  standard  along  the  existing  right-of-\n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n10 Category I road requires a design speed of 120 km per hour, and a carriageway of 4 or more lanes with lane width \nof 3.75 meters each. Category II road requires a design speed of 100 km per hour, and a carriageway of 2 lanes \nwith  lane  width  of  3.75  meters  each.  Category  III  road  requires  a  design  speed  of  80  km  per  hour,  and  a \ncarriageway of 2 lanes with lane width of 3.5 meters each \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nway.  The  works  cover  road  widening,  minor  realignment,  and  improvements  to  pavements, \ndrainage structures, and bridges for higher traffic volumes. The second part of the investment is \ncentered  on  the  road  section  from  Tursunzade  to  the  Uzbekistan  border  (km  50\u2013km  62).  This \nwill be upgraded to category II (from category III), while maintaining the existing two-lane road. \nIn  both  sections,  road  safety  will  be  improved.  This  will  be  preceded  by  road  safety  audits, \nreview of traffic management and road signing, training, and public campaigns. \n \n13. \nThe  project  will  also  improve  infrastructure  and  facilities  at  the  Dusti  border  crossing \npoint  with  Uzbekistan.  The  investments  include  connecting  to  a  dependable  power  source; \nmodernizing the customs buildings; installing new information technology and other equipment; \nbuilding a new all-weather walkway for pedestrians; and putting in place ancillary buildings and \nfacilities for cars, trucks, and people.11 Border guards, customs, and other agencies working at \nthe  project  border  crossing  point  will  have  better  working  and  living  conditions.  The  border \ncrossing  point  will  also  benefit  from  better  control  equipment.  Border  management  will  be \nimproved through training programs.12 New and more efficient procedures will be introduced to \nassure the efficient movement of goods. \n \n14. \nThe project includes a gender and border community development program, which is the \nfirst  such  program  in  Tajikistan  and  will  enrich  the  livelihood  of  border  communities.  The  plan \nincludes  investments  to  improve  village  access  roads,  sidewalks,  footpaths,  footbridges,  and \nsocial  infrastructure  in  selected  border  communities.  Through  direct  financial  and  capacity \ndevelopment  support,  the  project  will  encourage  cross-border  trading\u2014involving  women \nentrepreneurs.  The  road  investment  will  benefit  from  a  program  to  deal  with  the  spread  of \nsexually  transmitted  infections  and  HIV-related  disease  in  the  project  area.  Education \ncampaigns will target high-risk population groups such as migrant workers and their families. \n \n15. \n \n\nDirect support to the MOTC will focus on the following areas: \n\n(i)  \n\nTolling framework. ADB will provide specialist services on this program.  \n\n(ii)  \n\nMinistry  of  Transport  and  Communications  website.  A  new  website  will  be \nset up to show key MOTC activities, new initiatives, and their funding sources. It \nwill  include  current  and  planned  projects;  environmental  impact  assessments, \nand  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans;  road,  rail,  and  air  transport \nconditions;  traffic  volumes;  accident  and  safety  statistics;  driver  and  vehicle \nlicensing and registration; licensed rail and air transport operators; contact details; \nand  grievance  redress  arrangements.  The  website  will  also  be  used  to  receive \nfeedback from the public and other stakeholders. \n\n(iii)  \n\nContract  management.  The  MOTC  will  be  assisted  to  set  up  improved \ncontracting  modalities,  contract  processing,  and  contract  performance \nmonitoring. \n\n(iv)  \n\nDatabase. Training and support services will be provided to the MOTC to collect \nand update road sector data. \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB.  2004.

Both  are  confirmed  as  viable.  Based  on \npopulation and traffic growth projections, the corridor sections require widening within the next 4 \nyears.  About  50%  of  the  pavement  areas  have  cracks,  potholes,  and  deformation.  Rutting \naverages  5.5\u20136.0  meters/km  measured  in  accordance  with  the  international  roughness  index. \nThe sub-base is weak and requires urgent investment. The due diligence process confirmed the \nreasonableness  of  the  investment  and  maintenance  plans.  It  also  confirmed  the  technical \nspecifications\u2014adoption  of  category  I  design  standards  in  one  section  and  category  II  in \nanother. The road alignment, which follows the existing right-of-way, was studied and confirmed \nas valid, thereby minimizing land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. \n \n20. \nThe due diligence also focused on soft infrastructure, in particular the quality of facilities \nat the Dusti border crossing point. This border crossing point handles 50,000 vehicles per year, \nwith an average of about 150 trucks per day. However, the assessment confirmed the facilities \nto  be  inadequate  and  without  reliable  supply  of  electricity.  The  due  diligence  team  checked \ncustoms  procedures  and  concluded  that  they  were  inefficient  and  contributed  to  long  border \ndelays. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n21. \nThe project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 24%. The \nproject road sections will experience 20% annual growth (for goods and containerized transport). \nAnnual  traffic  and  cargo  growth  is  projected  to  increase  on  average  by  9%  for  trucks,  8%  for \nbuses,  and  11%  for  cars  and  minibuses.  This  is  broadly  in  line  with  GDP  growth  of  10% \nprojected for the medium term. Annual nationwide border cargo and vehicle movement growth \nrates\u2014vehicle entering, leaving, and transiting\u2014peaked at 16% during 2006\u20132008. The project \nwill increase trade and freight between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by 20% annually. It will ensure \nlower  transport  costs  and  higher  export  values,  and  will  attract  transit  traffic  by  reducing  the \ncurrent  border  crossing  time  to  and  from  Uzbekistan  by  30%.  It  will  generate  additional  traffic \nfrom Afghanistan through the Nijni Pyanji border crossing point and from the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  through  the  Kulma  border  crossing  point  to  Turkmenistan,  Turkey,  the  Caspian  Sea, \nand Europe. Benefits accrue through savings in road user costs and travel time, and increases \nin agricultural and industrial production and trade. A risk analysis concluded that the likelihood \nof the economic internal rate of return falling below 12% is less than 10%. The project is only \nmoderately  sensitive  to  capital  cost  increases.  The  switching  value  for  total  traffic  is  \u201333%, \nimplying that the base traffic could fall by a third before the project becomes unviable.  \n \n22. \nTrade  relations  between  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  are  improving,  although  some  risks \nare  possible  in  this  area.  Uzbekistan  is  Tajikistan\u2019s  fifth  largest  trading  partner.  The  CAREC \ntransport and trade facilitation strategy is dealing with cross-border and trade issues, including \nharmonization  of  border  and  customs  regulations  and  procedures,  simplification  of  customs \nduties and other taxes, and joint customs control. \n \n23. \nThe MOTC budget, covering capital investments and maintenance, has increased every \nyear.  Actual  maintenance  funding  increased  by  34%  during  2008\u20132009.  With  GDP  of \n$4.6 billion,  $23  million  (i.e.,  0.5%  of  GDP)  is  the  minimum  spending  required  for  road \nmaintenance.  The  MOTC  made  available  $8  million  (0.2%  of  GDP)  for  road  maintenance  in \n2010. This budget outlay will increase by about 18%\u201320% per year during the next 5 years. An \nautomated  road  databank  will  help  validate  the  maintenance  budget,  and  a  contract \nmanagement system will contribute to improving sustainability of road projects. \n \nC. \n \n24. \nA  road  sector  governance  assessment  was  completed  in  November  2009.  It  reviewed \nthe  overall  country  systems,  including  institutional  arrangements,  legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks,  public  finance  management  and  procurement,  and  a  risk  management  plan.  The \nreport  points  out  the  absence  of  legal  certainty  and  a  commercial  vision,  which  integrate \nfinancial  resources  with  maintenance  requirements.  It  recommends  establishing  a  consistent \ncommercial  policy  and  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  as  prerequisites  to  public\u2013private \npartnership \ninclude  nontransparent  operations,  outdated \noperational  tools,  and  a  skills  gap.  The  project  incorporates  all  of  the  assessment  report \nrecommendations. \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed  with,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  MOTC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n \n \n\ntransactions.  Other  obstacles \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n26. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  a  general  and  a  geographically  targeted  intervention  with \ndirect impact on the project area, targeting border communities. An assessment of the poverty \nand  social  implications  was  undertaken.  It  revealed  that  the  project  area  has  witnessed  an \nincreasing number of households headed by females as a result of male migration. The poverty \nrate  for  women  is  high,  the  number  of  households  headed  by  women  increasing,  and  formal \nsector  jobs  for  women  are  few.15 Women  need  to  be  encouraged  to  start  small  businesses, \nideally supported with conditional grants and training. A gender action plan has been prepared \nas part of the project-related work, and the PAM details a grant finance scheme. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nThe  project is  classified  environment  category  A  because  of  the  road  widening  section \nfrom the West Gate to Tursunzade (km 5\u2013km 50). The due diligence confirmed that the project \ndoes  not  pass  through  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  The  MOTC  prepared  an \nenvironmental impact assessment, examined by ADB and uploaded to ADB\u2019s website on 8 June \n2010.  The  project  has  met  all  public  disclosure  requirements.  Significant  impacts  associated \nwith  the  project  are  typical  of  a  road  project  which  includes  traffic  disruption,  traffic  noise, \nvibration,  and  air  quality.    Mitigation  measures  for  all  impacts  are  included  in,  and  will  be \nimplemented  through,  the  environmental  management  plan.  The  design  features  an  improved \nroad surface, which will lessen traffic noise and limit progressive degradation. \n \n28. \nCivil works will entail significant land acquisition and involuntary resettlement impact with \nabout  376  households  to  be  affected  because  of  the  road  widening.  The  involuntary \nresettlement is category A. The MOTC prepared a land acquisition and resettlement plan, which \nADB disclosed on its website on 24 September 2010. The MOTC will be responsible for meeting \nall  ADB  safeguards  requirements.  ADB  will  directly  select  an  external  reviewer  to  monitor \nresettlement  and  compensation  progress,  and  provide  training  on  safeguards  to  mitigate \npotential  risks.  The  project  affects  neither  indigenous  peoples  nor  vulnerable  groups,  and  is \nclassified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Positive  economic  and  social  impacts  are \nexpected. \n \nF. \n \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.16 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                 \n15 About 97% of household members leave Tajikistan to work. \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n\fTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nCompliance with the land \nacquisition and resettlement plan \nClimate change risks \n\nMaintenance \n\nCross-border arrangements with \nneighboring countries \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe Asian Development Bank will directly select an independent \nreviewer to monitor compliance \nThe bidding document will specify a pilot program for climate \nresilience recommendations for road works  \nThe government will increase the annual road maintenance \nbudget from TJS2,400 per kilometer in 2009 to TJS5,000 per \nkilometer in 2015 \nThe CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy will \nimplement the action plan and continue policy dialogue.
