I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  CAREC  Corridor  3  (Dushanbe\u2013Uzbekistan  Border) \nImprovement Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  THE CORRIDOR \n \n2.  The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program has developed a \ntransport and trade facilitation strategy and action plan covering short-, medium-, and long-term \ninvestments across six road and rail corridors across the region. The aim is to improve regional \nconnectivity, cut transport costs, and increase competitiveness. The CAREC Corridor 3 covers \nalmost 7,000 kilometers (km) of roads and runs in the north\u2013south direction, linking the Russian \nFederation to the Persian Gulf. Tajikistan is one of the key transit points. However, several \nsections in the country are in bad shape and incomplete. Moreover, facilities at border crossing \npoints  are  inadequate  and  cross-border  procedures  inefficient.  As  a  small  and  sparsely \npopulated country, Tajikistan depends on the corridor for investment, job creation, trade, and \nultimately economic growth and poverty reduction. Export-driven agriculture accounts for 37% of \ntotal employment and 23% of gross domestic product (GDP). Aluminum exports are equally \nimportant. These two activities need the CAREC Corridor 3 to reach regional and international \nmarkets\u2014the  nearest  seaport  for  Tajikistan  is  more  than  3,000  km  away.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and other development partners have completed rehabilitation of \nclose to 90% of CAREC Corridor 3 sections within Tajikistan.2 However, various important \nsections  are  still  unrepaired.  These  stretch  from  Dushanbe  to  the  Uzbekistan  border  and \namount to 62 km in total\u2014with an estimated investment of close to $200 million. \n  \n3.  The  Government  of  Tajikistan  has  asked  ADB  and  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD) to finance these corridor sections. The EBRD will \nsupport one section close to the capital (Avicenna Monument\u2013West Gate section, from km 0 to \nkm 5)  and  ADB  will  provide  the  rest  of  the  network  up  to  the  Uzbekistan  border.  The \ngovernment has requested ADB to finance several soft infrastructure components, including \nimproving infrastructure and facilities at the Dusti border crossing point with Uzbekistan, and \nproject management assistance. The financing plan for the Tajikistan section of Corridor 3 is in \nTable 1. \nTable 1: Corridor 3 (Tajikistan Section) Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of \nSource  Length  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank (Asian Development Fund)   km 5\u2013km 62  120.0  64 \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development  km 0\u2013km 5  27.0  15 \nGovernment of Tajikistan    39.0  21 \n        Total    186.0  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Manila. ", "2 \nIII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n4.  The project is part of the government\u2019s 2010\u20132011 Public Investment Program3 and fits \nwith the ADB country partnership strategy for Tajikistan, 2010\u20132014.4 It is also an integral part \nof  the  CAREC  transport  and  trade  facilitation  strategy  and  action  plan,  2008\u20132018.5 The \nregional dimension is now fully embedded in national planning in Tajikistan. \n \n5.  Corridor sections. The road from Dushanbe to the border with Uzbekistan crosses the \nGissar valley and the town of Tursunzade (km 5\u2013km 62)\u2014two busy and growing agricultural, \nindustrial, and commercial points in Tajikistan. Gissar has the highest agricultural output in \nTajikistan, comprising cotton, grain, fruits, and vegetables\u2014all important exports.6 Tursunzade \nis home to Central Asia\u2019s largest aluminum processing plant7 and several small light industry \nclusters\u2014ceramics, brick, cable and cotton-ginning, and cleaning\u2014employing 10,000 people. A \nquarter of Tajikistan\u2019s cross-border vehicles and freight pass through the Dusti border crossing \npoint. However, the condition of the road from Dushanbe to the Dusti border crossing point is \ndeteriorating and needs rehabilitation. \n \n6.  Sector strategy and reforms. The National Development Strategy, 2006\u20132015 targets \nrapid improvements to the country\u2019s transport infrastructure, related services, and maintenance. \nA sector road map and investment program supports the strategy. Institutionally, a restructured \nMinistry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) has been mandated to execute investments \nunder the road map. The rest of the institutional setup includes legal and regulatory frameworks \nand improved procurement systems. The sector also benefits from the work of various institutes \ncovering  design  and  quality  control.  The  budget  process  has  been  refined  and  includes \nsystematic provisions for capital investment, operation, and maintenance. The budget has been \nincreasing by 18% annually since 2004. A road safety program, 2009\u20132013 is in place and is \nbeing implemented satisfactorily. The country\u2019s road accident rate has fallen\u2014it is the lowest \namong the 10 members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The MOTC is working on \npilot performance-based contracts for routine maintenance works, which is a new but important \ninitiative  in  the  country.  The  objective  is  to  maintain  the  quality  and  life  of  assets  while \ncontaining costs. The works will be outsourced to the private sector to perform a large share of \nthis work. \n \n7.  Despite significant progress in the planning, policy, institutional, maintenance, oversight, \nand funding areas, the transport sector remains affected by several gaps which are summarized \nbelow. \n \n(i)  Tolling. Road sector investment and maintenance will need the private sector. \nThe government introduced tolling on a Dushanbe\u2013Khujand\u2013Chanak (350 km) \nroad on 31 March 2010. The performance of this road is being assessed but \nwork is at an early stage. \n                                                 \n3  Government Regulation 641, \u201cThe State Investment Program for Grants and Capital Construction for 2010\u20132011,\u201d \nincludes the construction of the Dushanbe\u2013Uzbekistan border road. \n4  ADB. 2010. Country Partnership Strategy: Tajikistan, 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2008. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy. Manila. \n6  The project area produces 61% of the country\u2019s fruits, 12% of vegetables, and 28% of meat, although it has only \n9% of the total sown area on less than 3% of the country\u2019s land area. \n7  This is Tajikistan's main industrial asset. The country has no aluminum ore, so the raw material for the plant has to \nbe imported.  \n ", "3 \n(ii)  Contract  modalities. The public and private sectors require predictable and \nrobust contract modalities. The MOTC still applies too many different modalities, \nespecially regarding project management, construction, and maintenance. This \naffects transparency, competition, and efficiency. It also limits the private sector\u2019s \ninterest in the sector. \n \n(iii)  Road database. Investment and maintenance planning need a good database \ncovering traffic count, road conditions, accidents, etc. The current database is \ninadequate and incomplete. \n \n(iv)  Funding. Capital investment and maintenance finance requires substantial and \npredictable funding. The budget has been constrained by the recent economic \ncrisis. Although this is improving, much of the funding still relies on external \nsources. A more sustainable system is required, particularly for maintenance. \nPerformance-based contracts and road funds are under consideration to address \nthis problem. \n \n8.  Under the project, ADB will provide finance to help the MOTC address some of these \nissues. Training will be provided to support work in other areas specified under the Transport \nSector Master Plan.8 Further, ADB will assist with measures to mitigate specific governance \nrisks identified in the sector governance assessment report.9 \n \n9.  The project design incorporates the key lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience in the \ntransport  sector  in  Tajikistan  and  other  Central  Asian  countries.  These  lessons include  (i) \nobtaining the government\u2019s financing assurances for adequate funding for maintenance of the \nproject road, and for increases in financing of road maintenance; (ii) using advance contracting \nand  retroactive  financing  to  avoid  initial  implementation  delays;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the \nexecuting agency\u2019s project implementation capacity with provision of consulting services. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project will increase national and regional trade, and further economic growth. The \nproject outcome will be improved connectivity and mobility along the Tajikistan sections of the \nCAREC Corridor 3. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The outputs will comprise (i) reconstructed and upgraded road sections from Dushanbe \nto Tursunzade to the Uzbekistan border (km 5\u2013km 62); (ii) improved infrastructure and facilities \nat the Dusti border crossing point; and (iii) developed gender and border communities and \nimproved road operations. \n \n12.  The first part of the road investment will be centered on the West Gate\u2013Tursunzade \nsection (km 5\u2013km 50), which is currently classified category II.10 The project will upgrade it to \ncategory I\u2014equivalent to a four-lane international design standard along the existing right-of-\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n10 Category I road requires a design speed of 120 km per hour, and a carriageway of 4 or more lanes with lane width \nof 3.75 meters each. Category II road requires a design speed of 100 km per hour, and a carriageway of 2 lanes \nwith lane width of 3.75 meters each. Category III road requires a design speed of 80 km per hour, and a \ncarriageway of 2 lanes with lane width of 3.5 meters each \n ", "4 \nway. The works cover road widening, minor realignment, and improvements to pavements, \ndrainage structures, and bridges for higher traffic volumes. The second part of the investment is \ncentered on the road section from Tursunzade to the Uzbekistan border (km 50\u2013km 62). This \nwill be upgraded to category II (from category III), while maintaining the existing two-lane road. \nIn both sections, road safety will be improved. This will be preceded by road safety audits, \nreview of traffic management and road signing, training, and public campaigns. \n \n13.  The project will also improve infrastructure and facilities at the Dusti border crossing \npoint with Uzbekistan. The investments include connecting to a dependable power source; \nmodernizing the customs buildings; installing new information technology and other equipment; \nbuilding a new all-weather walkway for pedestrians; and putting in place ancillary buildings and \nfacilities for cars, trucks, and people.11 Border guards, customs, and other agencies working at \nthe project border crossing point will have better working and living conditions. The border \ncrossing  point  will  also  benefit from  better  control  equipment.  Border  management  will  be \nimproved through training programs.12 New and more efficient procedures will be introduced to \nassure the efficient movement of goods. \n \n14.  The project includes a gender and border community development program, which is the \nfirst such program in Tajikistan and will enrich the livelihood of border communities. The plan \nincludes investments to improve village access roads, sidewalks, footpaths, footbridges, and \nsocial  infrastructure  in  selected  border  communities.  Through  direct  financial  and  capacity \ndevelopment  support,  the  project  will  encourage  cross-border  trading\u2014involving  women \nentrepreneurs. The road investment will benefit from a program to deal with the spread of \nsexually  transmitted  infections  and  HIV-related  disease  in  the  project  area.  Education \ncampaigns will target high-risk population groups such as migrant workers and their families. \n \n15.  Direct support to the MOTC will focus on the following areas: \n \n(i)   Tolling framework. ADB will provide specialist services on this program.  \n \n(ii)   Ministry of Transport and Communications website. A new website will be \nset up to show key MOTC activities, new initiatives, and their funding sources. It \nwill include current and planned projects; environmental impact assessments, \nand  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans;  road,  rail,  and  air  transport \nconditions;  traffic  volumes;  accident  and  safety  statistics;  driver  and  vehicle \nlicensing and registration; licensed rail and air transport operators; contact details; \nand grievance redress arrangements. The website will also be used to receive \nfeedback from the public and other stakeholders. \n \n(iii)   Contract  management.  The  MOTC  will  be  assisted  to  set  up  improved \ncontracting  modalities,  contract  processing,  and  contract  performance \nmonitoring. \n \n(iv)   Database. Training and support services will be provided to the MOTC to collect \nand update road sector data. \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  The technical due diligence assessment focused on the definition of the investment plan \nand  operation  and  maintenance  arrangements.  Both  are  confirmed  as  viable.  Based  on \npopulation and traffic growth projections, the corridor sections require widening within the next 4 \nyears. About 50% of the pavement areas have cracks, potholes, and deformation. Rutting \naverages 5.5\u20136.0 meters/km measured in accordance with the international roughness index. \nThe sub-base is weak and requires urgent investment. The due diligence process confirmed the \nreasonableness  of  the  investment  and  maintenance  plans.  It  also  confirmed  the  technical \nspecifications\u2014adoption  of  category  I  design  standards  in  one  section  and  category  II  in \nanother. The road alignment, which follows the existing right-of-way, was studied and confirmed \nas valid, thereby minimizing land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. \n \n20.  The due diligence also focused on soft infrastructure, in particular the quality of facilities \nat the Dusti border crossing point. This border crossing point handles 50,000 vehicles per year, \nwith an average of about 150 trucks per day. However, the assessment confirmed the facilities \nto be inadequate and without reliable supply of electricity. The due diligence team checked \ncustoms procedures and concluded that they were inefficient and contributed to long border \ndelays. \n \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  The project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 24%. The \nproject road sections will experience 20% annual growth (for goods and containerized transport). \nAnnual traffic and cargo growth is projected to increase on average by 9% for trucks, 8% for \nbuses, and 11% for cars and minibuses. This is broadly in line with GDP growth of 10% \nprojected for the medium term. Annual nationwide border cargo and vehicle movement growth \nrates\u2014vehicle entering, leaving, and transiting\u2014peaked at 16% during 2006\u20132008. The project \nwill increase trade and freight between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by 20% annually. It will ensure \nlower transport costs and higher export values, and will attract transit traffic by reducing the \ncurrent border crossing time to and from Uzbekistan by 30%. It will generate additional traffic \nfrom Afghanistan through the Nijni Pyanji border crossing point and from the People\u2019s Republic \nof China through the Kulma border crossing point to Turkmenistan, Turkey, the Caspian Sea, \nand Europe. Benefits accrue through savings in road user costs and travel time, and increases \nin agricultural and industrial production and trade. A risk analysis concluded that the likelihood \nof the economic internal rate of return falling below 12% is less than 10%. The project is only \nmoderately sensitive to capital cost increases. The switching value for total traffic is \u201333%, \nimplying that the base traffic could fall by a third before the project becomes unviable.  \n \n22.  Trade relations between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are improving, although some risks \nare possible in this area. Uzbekistan is Tajikistan\u2019s fifth largest trading partner. The CAREC \ntransport and trade facilitation strategy is dealing with cross-border and trade issues, including \nharmonization of border and customs regulations and procedures, simplification of customs \nduties and other taxes, and joint customs control. \n \n23.  The MOTC budget, covering capital investments and maintenance, has increased every \nyear.  Actual  maintenance  funding  increased  by  34%  during  2008\u20132009.  With  GDP  of \n$4.6 billion,  $23  million  (i.e.,  0.5%  of  GDP)  is  the  minimum  spending  required  for  road \nmaintenance. The MOTC made available $8 million (0.2% of GDP) for road maintenance in \n2010. This budget outlay will increase by about 18%\u201320% per year during the next 5 years. An \nautomated  road  databank  will  help  validate  the  maintenance  budget,  and  a  contract \nmanagement system will contribute to improving sustainability of road projects. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  A road sector governance assessment was completed in November 2009. It reviewed \nthe  overall  country  systems,  including  institutional  arrangements,  legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks, public finance management and procurement, and a risk management plan. The \nreport  points  out  the  absence  of  legal  certainty  and  a  commercial  vision,  which  integrate \nfinancial resources with maintenance requirements. It recommends establishing a consistent \ncommercial  policy  and  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  as  prerequisites  to  public\u2013private \npartnership  transactions.  Other  obstacles  include  nontransparent  operations,  outdated \noperational  tools,  and  a  skills  gap.  The  project  incorporates  all  of  the  assessment  report \nrecommendations. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed with, the Ministry of Finance and the MOTC. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n \n \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  The project is classified as a general and a geographically targeted intervention with \ndirect impact on the project area, targeting border communities. An assessment of the poverty \nand social implications was undertaken. It revealed that the project area has witnessed an \nincreasing number of households headed by females as a result of male migration. The poverty \nrate for women is high, the number of households headed by women increasing, and formal \nsector jobs for women are few.15 Women need to be encouraged to start small businesses, \nideally supported with conditional grants and training. A gender action plan has been prepared \nas part of the project-related work, and the PAM details a grant finance scheme. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  The project is classified environment category A because of the road widening section \nfrom the West Gate to Tursunzade (km 5\u2013km 50). The due diligence confirmed that the project \ndoes  not  pass  through  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  The  MOTC  prepared  an \nenvironmental impact assessment, examined by ADB and uploaded to ADB\u2019s website on 8 June \n2010. The project has met all public disclosure requirements. Significant impacts associated \nwith the project are typical of a road project which includes traffic disruption, traffic noise, \nvibration, and air quality.  Mitigation measures for all impacts are included in, and will be \nimplemented through, the environmental management plan. The design features an improved \nroad surface, which will lessen traffic noise and limit progressive degradation. \n \n28.  Civil works will entail significant land acquisition and involuntary resettlement impact with \nabout  376  households  to  be  affected  because  of  the  road  widening.  The  involuntary \nresettlement is category A. The MOTC prepared a land acquisition and resettlement plan, which \nADB disclosed on its website on 24 September 2010. The MOTC will be responsible for meeting \nall  ADB  safeguards  requirements.  ADB  will directly  select  an  external  reviewer  to  monitor \nresettlement  and  compensation  progress,  and  provide  training  on  safeguards  to  mitigate \npotential risks. The project affects neither indigenous peoples nor vulnerable groups, and is \nclassified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Positive  economic  and  social  impacts  are \nexpected. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n                                                 \n15 About 97% of household members leave Tajikistan to work. \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n ", "9 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCompliance with the land  The Asian Development Bank will directly select an independent \nacquisition and resettlement plan  reviewer to monitor compliance \nClimate change risks  The bidding document will specify a pilot program for climate \nresilience recommendations for road works  \nMaintenance  The government will increase the annual road maintenance \nbudget from TJS2,400 per kilometer in 2009 to TJS5,000 per \nkilometer in 2015 \nCross-border arrangements with  The CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy will \nneighboring countries  implement the action plan and continue policy dialogue.

The government and the MOTC have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and grant agreement. \n \n31.  The government and the MOTC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are included in the grant agreement. Disbursement of the grant proceeds will be \nconditional upon payment of compensation and provision of other entitlements under the land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  plan,  and  the  exemption  of  taxes  and  duties  on  project \nexpenditures, or allocation of funds for their payment. \n \nVI.
