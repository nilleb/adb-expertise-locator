The  Project  has  three \ncomponents:  (i)  developing  a  national  curriculum  framework  and \naligned  education  standards,  (ii)  improving  teaching  and  learning \nenvironments in primary and secondary schools, and (iii) promoting \ndemand-driven vocational education for the youth.  \n   \nRationale  Key issues in the current Mongolian education system are (i) poor \nquality  and  relevance  of  the  current  curriculum  for  primary  and \nsecondary education, (ii) inadequate teaching qualifications and skills, \n(iii)  lack  of  consistent  education  standards,  (iv)  weak  learning  and \nteaching  environments  in  schools,  and  (v)  supply-driven  irrelevant \nvocational education for youth. The Government has decided to extend \nthe education system from the current 10-year system to a 12-year \nsystem  in  2008,  which  will  align  Mongolia\u2019s  education  system  with \ninternational standards. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will assist \nthe Government in the implementation of this policy, which will require \ncomprehensive reform of the curriculum framework, establishing new \neducation standards, streamlining the current teacher in-service training \nsystem, and developing a national teacher accreditation system.  \n \nThe  limited  capacity  and  poor  condition  of  school  facilities\u2014which \ncontinue to deteriorate\u2014are major constraints to increasing enrolment \nand retention, and improving the quality of education services. This has \nbeen particularly acute in rural areas where budget funds for preventive \nmaintenance  and  technical  resources  for  rehabilitation  are  scarce. \nBuilding construction and technology are inefficient in terms of use of \nmaterials, structural capacity, and energy performance.  \n ", "iv   \n  The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MECS) is the sole \npublic sector provider of vocational and technical education (VTE) for \nthe youth. Currently, vocational education programs are based on the \nformer  Soviet  system,  which  is  neither  responsive  to  labor  market \ndemands  nor  cost-effective.  Graduates  have  difficulty  finding  jobs \nbecause they lack employable skills. School facilities have deteriorated, \nadequate  training  equipment  is  lacking  or  outdated,  and  the \npedagogical and technical skills and knowledge of many teachers are \noutdated. With the introduction of the 12-year school system, the VTE \nsystem  will  need  to  be  adjusted  to  the  new  national  curriculum \nframework. \n   \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  education  sector  in  Mongolia  has  evolved \nsince the early 1990s to support the Government in strengthening the \neducation  system  step-by-step.  ESDP  was  approved  in  1996  and \nincluded a program loan to support fundamental policy reforms in the \norganization,  management,  staffing,  and  financing  of  the  education \nsector; and a project loan to support initial investments. SEDP was \napproved in 2002 and builds on the initial reform framework established \nby  ESDP,  with  a  focus  on  school  and  kindergarten  rehabilitation, \nprovision  of  learning  materials,  and  limited  support  in  curriculum \ndevelopment and teacher training. The Project focuses on two major \nfeatures which have not been addressed by previous interventions: (i) a \ncomprehensive  curriculum  reform,  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s \ndecision to extend the schooling period by 2 years; and (ii) reforming \nthe  current  VTE  system,  which  is  a  development  priority  of  the \nGovernment to enhance employment and income-earning opportunities \nand  promote  economic  growth.  The  Project  contributes  to  two \nMillennium  Development  Goals:  (i)  achieving  universal  primary \neducation,  and  (ii)  eliminating  gender  disparity  in  primary  and \nsecondary education. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be improved employability and income-\nearning  opportunities  of  graduates  from  secondary  and  vocational \neducation. The outcome of the Project will be enhanced and more \nequitable access to\u2014and improved quality and relevance of\u2014primary, \nsecondary, and vocational education. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $16.38 million equivalent. The \nforeign exchange cost is estimated at $3.83 million (24% of the total \ncost)  and  the  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at  $12.55  million \nequivalent (76% of the total cost). \n   \n ", "  v\nFinancing Plan  ($ \u2018000) \nLocal  Foreign \nSource  Total  Percent \nCurrency  Exchange \nAsian Development \nBank  9,170  3,830  13,000  79.4 \nGovernment of \nMongolia  3,378  0  3,378  20.6 \nTotal  12,548  3,830  16,378  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTo  further  support  project  activities,  Germany  German  Agency  for \nTechnical Cooperation [GTZ] has indicated that it will provide additional \nconsulting inputs of $0.60 million on a grant basis, and the United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has indicated that it will provide \nconsultancy inputs of $0.09 million on a grant basis.  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  8,794,000  Special  Drawing  Rights  ($13 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance \n79.4% of the total project cost. The loan will have a maturity of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years. Interest will be charged at \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \nPeriod of Utilization  30 March 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 September 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MECS) \n   \nImplementation  The project steering committee (PSC) established under SEDP will be \nArrangements  reorganized and will consist of eight members\u2014two representatives \nfrom MECS, one from Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, and two \nfrom  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy;  and  one  each  from \nnongovernment organizations, industry, and development partners. The \nchairman will be appointed by the minister of education and will be the \nproject  director.  The  PSC  will  provide  strategic  guidance,  monitor \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  and  ensure  donor  coordination.  The \nproject  director  will  coordinate  overall  implementation  of  project \nactivities. The Project will be implemented through the current project \nimplementation unit (PIU) established under ESDP, staffed by a project \nmanager and five additional staff, who will be responsible for the overall \nimplementation of activities. MECS will provide office space for the PIU. \nThe PIU will report to the project director and provide quarterly result-\nbased progress reports to the PSC, MECS management, and ADB.  \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance \nwith its Procurement  Guidelines. Procurement of civil works will be \ncarried  out  through  national  competitive  bidding.  Procurement  of \nequipment will be performed through international competitive bidding, \nand national competitive bidding satisfactory to ADB, and shopping. \n   \n ", "vi   \nConsulting Services  A total of 8 person-months of international and 265 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services will be contracted under loan funds. This \nwill include experts in the field of policy development, curriculum and \nstandards  development,  teacher  training,  and  civil  engineers \nspecialized  in  school  rehabilitation.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  In \naddition, Germany [GTZ] is expected to provide grant assistance for \n40 person-months of international consultants and UNICEF is expected \nto finance 6 person-months of international and 4 person-months of \nnational consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Direct beneficiaries of the Project will include all students enrolled in \nBeneficiaries  primary and secondary schools. Nationwide, about 560,000 students\u2014\nincluding about 201,000 students from poor families\u2014will benefit from \nimproved curriculum, well-defined education standards, and enhanced \nassessment systems. About 31,000 students and 1,200 teachers will \nbenefit from improved school and dormitory facilities in 45 schools to be \nrehabilitated under the Project. In addition, about 23,000 students and \n900 teachers of 30 model schools will benefit from upgraded teaching \nfacilities.  Rehabilitation  works  will  contribute  to  reduce  the  cost  of \nutilities and operation and maintenance (O&M). About 21,400 teachers \nthroughout  the  country  will  benefit  from  in-service  teacher  training \nprograms.  \n  \n  About 21,900 students of vocational education institutions will benefit \nfrom reform of the VTE system and a new demand-driven curriculum, \nwhich will improve their employment and income-earning opportunities \nafter graduation. Student and teachers of six key VTE institutions will \nbenefit  from  rehabilitated  facilities  and  modern  training  equipment. \nIndustries and services will benefit from improvements in relevance and \nquality of VTE. Graduates of VTE institutions entering the labor force \nwill possess knowledge and skills in line with industry requirements, \ncontribute to higher labor productivity, and increase economic growth. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Successful implementation of the Project rests on the assumption that \nthe Government will (i) maintain the high level of budget allocation for \nthe education sector; (ii) be committed to improve donor coordination to \nstrengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of education \nservices; (iii) maintain its commitment to carry out education reforms, \nincluding national curriculum reform; (iv) provide adequate budget to \nprovide in-service training for all teachers employed by the system; and \n(v)  reform  and  rationalize  the  current  VTE  system.  To  achieve  its \nimpact, the Project assumes that further steady economic growth will \ncreate new job opportunities. \n \nThe managerial and technical capacity of MECS is limited and might \naffect the smooth implementation of the extension of the school system \nto  a  12-year  system  and  the  introduction  of  the  new  curriculum \nframework nationwide. The  risks  will  be mitigated through training and \n \n ", "  vii\n  capacity building under the Project. The policy impact of introducing \nnew education standards and uniform assessments will be significant. \nRisks include resistance from teachers and school directors to accept \nchanges to implement the new curriculum framework and introduce \nuniform  examinations.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  adopting  a \nparticipatory  approach  to  project  implementation,  actively  involving \nschool  directors,  teachers,  and  communities.  Financial  risks  involve \npotential difficulties in the provision of incremental recurrent costs for \nO&M  of  rehabilitated  schools.  To  mitigate  the  risk,  ADB  will  work \nclosely with the Government to ensure that adequate resources are \nallocated  for  the  education  sector,  incremental  recurrent  costs  are \nassigned for O&M, and appropriate assurances are included. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  ADB  will  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  MECS\u2019 \ntechnical and management capacity in strategic planning and policy \nanalysis, and enable the ministry to set up a sector wide approach in \nthe education sector. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $210,000 \nequivalent,  of  which  $55,000  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and \n$155,000 equivalent the local currency cost. ADB will provide $150,000 \non a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \nfinance the balance through provision of workshop facilities, counterpart \nstaff, office space, and furniture for TA administration. \n ", "(cid:78) (cid:78)\n(cid:48)(cid:39)

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia  for  the  Third  Education  Development  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Development of a Sector Wide Approach in Education, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In 2002, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide TA to \nassist the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MECS) to prepare the Third Education \nDevelopment Project (the Project)1 as a follow-up to the ongoing Second Education Development \nProject (SEDP)2 and the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP)3 that was successfully \ncompleted in 2002. The Government considers improving the quality of the education system, \nenhancing access to basic education services, and promoting demand-driven vocational education \nto be key instruments to alleviate poverty, accelerate economic growth, and reduce disparities in \nthe  development  process\u2014particularly  between  rural  and  urban  areas.  In  accordance  with \nGovernment\u2019s  development  strategy,  the  Project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram Update 2005\u20132006 and Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2006\u20132008. 4 The project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Socioeconomic Context \n \n3.  After 14 years of economic transition, Mongolia stands out as a good performer among \ntransition economies. Profound economic reform has led to the successful implementation of the \npillars of a market economy and, at present, substantive macroeconomic stabilization has been \nachieved. However, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ($602 in 2004) has not yet reached \npre-transition levels and poverty has emerged as an unwelcome side effect of the transition. \nPoverty spread on a large scale in the 1990s as a consequence of the structural transformation of \nthe economy. Following the collapse of the socialist institutions, a range of services deteriorated, \nincluding health care, education, transportation, water supply, and sanitation. Poverty remains \npersistent in both rural and urban Mongolia and 36% of the population live below the national \npoverty line ($0.75 a day). Continued growth is helping to lift living standards but the benefits are \nnot distributed equally among the population, as revealed by income inequality and unchanged \npoverty incidence. Rural poverty is significantly higher than urban poverty, with Western Mongolia \nstanding out as the most seriously affected region. Sectoral composition of GDP has changed, with \nindustry and services expanding fast while agriculture has declined. This has led to a significant \nmigration  flow  from  the  countryside  to  the  major  urban  centers,  which  has  caused  major \nimbalances in educational service provision. A total of 57.4% of the population currently lives in \nurban centers. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Mongolia has a relatively young, economically active population. Of the total population of \nabout 2.5 million, 38% are below the age of 16, and 55% are of working age. The sharp fall in \naverage income that marked the first years of the transition triggered a drop in birth rate and the \npopulation\u2019s growth rate declined from 2.7% in 1989 to 0.8% in 2004. \n \n5.  High  unemployment  (14.2%)  and  underemployment  caused  by  a  mismatch  between \navailable skills and labor market needs is one of the major causes of poverty. The service sector is \nthe main source of employment in Mongolia, followed by agriculture and industry. However, the \npattern is completely different in urban and rural areas. While services account for 75% of the \nemployed in urban centers, they employ only 5% of the rural labor force, which is mainly engaged \nin livestock and farming activities. The lack of relevant knowledge and skills among poor migrants \nrestricts their earning opportunities to intermittent low-wage employment in the informal sector and \nis a major cause of poverty among this group. The recent Household Income and Expenditure \nSurvey and Living Standards Measurement Survey5 found that the poor have lower education \nattainments than the nonpoor in general; and lack the managerial, professional, or technological \nskills required in burgeoning industries. The divide is particularly evident in urban areas where only \n14% of the poor possess skills in demand, compared with 38% of the nonpoor.  \n \n6.  Mongolia\u2019s  experience  suggests  that  economic  growth  does  not  translate  into  poverty \nreduction immediately, given the narrow base of the economy and its vulnerability to external \nshocks. Hence, specific interventions are required to combat poverty. Education is perceived as an \nimportant vehicle to reduce poverty, upgrade human development, and generate job opportunities. \nImproving the quality and relevance of education\u2014both in urban and rural areas\u2014is essential to \nstrengthen  the  country\u2019s  human  capital,  widen  the  range  of  opportunities  for  employment \ngeneration, and promote competitiveness and private sector development.  \n \n2.  Education Sector \n \n7.  Education was one of Mongolia\u2019s main achievements in the socialist era. School and \ndormitory facilities were established in all soums (districts), allowing all children\u2014including those \nfrom remote nomadic families\u2014to obtain a basic education. Results were impressive. The gross \nenrolment  rate  (GER)  in  primary  and  secondary  education  reached  99%  by  1990.  This  was \naccompanied by high literacy rates which, even in 2004, stood at 97% of the population aged over \n15. With the termination of financial and technical support from the Soviet Union in 1991, the \nquality of and access to education services in Mongolia deteriorated. State education expenditures \nwere massively reduced. Without finance for operation and maintenance (O&M) and essential \nrepairs,  school  facilities  deteriorated  and  many  were  forced  to  close.  Availability  of  learning \nmaterials dwindled and teachers\u2019 real salaries eroded distinctly. By 1996, the GER had fallen to \n82% and dropout rates6 had increased. A description of the education sector is in Appendix 2. \n \n8.  Robust  planning  and  investments  by  the  Government\u2014and  major  support  from  ADB, \nGovernment of Japan, and other development partners over the last 10 years\u2014have reversed this \ndecline and resulted in improvements across the education sector, including (i) major policy reform; \n(ii) rationalization of financing, staff, and facilities; and (iii) rehabilitation and upgrading of a large \nnumber of school facilities and classrooms. In the 2003\u20132004 school year, the GER increased to \n                                                 \n5  The survey was conducted by the National Statistical Office with assistance from the World Bank and United Nations \nDevelopment Programme in 2003\u20132004. \n6  This is defined by MECS as a pupil who has missed a year of school. Reasons behind student dropout vary. MECS \nhas identified the following key reasons behind the dropout rate: (i) problems with income and the affordability of \neducation; (ii) migration pressures, i.e. seeking work in urban areas; and (iii) school-based discrimination against \nmigrant children. Other agencies have identified the cost of education in relation to poverty levels, city schools refusing \nto accept new enrolments, lack of interest in learning, and poor health as contributing reasons.  \n ", "3 \n97%. In 2005, the Government decided to extend the current 10-year system to a 12-year system \nin 2008, which will align Mongolia\u2019s education system with international standards. \n \n9.  The formal education system in Mongolia consists of kindergarten and preschool (up to \nage 7), primary education (4 years), lower secondary education (4 years), and upper secondary \neducation (2 years). From the 2005\u20132006 school year, the Government extended the structure of \nschool education from grades 1\u201310 (4+4+2) to grades 1\u201311 (5+4+2), with the expectation of \nexpanding this further to a 12-year system (6+3+3) in 2008. Basic education (primary and lower \nsecondary  education)  is  compulsory  and  funded  by  the  state.  In  2004\u20132005,  some  557,346 \nstudents were enrolled in 710 primary and secondary schools with a total of 21,458 teachers. \nMECS is the central administrative body that formulates national educational policy and sets the \nstandards  for  each  level  of  formal  education.  MECS  also  administers  general  provisions  on \neducation matters, teacher training, curriculum development, and state examination procedures, \nand is responsible for the accreditation of higher education institutions. \n \n10.  MECS is the sole public sector provider of vocational and technical education (VTE) for \nyouth. Vocational and technical training and retraining for adults is offered by institutions under the \nMinistry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW), other line ministries, and the private sector. MECS \nadministers a total of 42 VTE institutions. There are 22 vocational education and training centers \n(VETCs) and vocational training and production centers (VTPCs), which offer a 2.5-year combined \nprofessional and general education, leading to a professional certificate and a secondary education \ncertificate. The entry level for VTPCs/VETCs is grade 8. The curriculum in VTPCs/VETCs retains \nlarge elements of the pre-transitional system. MECS also administers 14 branch schools (attached \nto  higher  education  institutions)  and  6  technical  colleges,  which  provide  advanced  technical \neducation  for  higher-level  skills  development,  leading  to  a  professional  diploma  or  bachelors \ndegree. In 2004\u20132005, 21,911 students were enrolled in VETCs, VTPCs, and branch schools. \n \n11.  Mongolia\u2019s education expenditure is among the highest of the transition countries at 7.3% \nof GDP or 18.5% of the total national budget in 2004. Expenditure on primary and secondary \neducation  is  highest  among  the  subsectors,  at  48%  of  total  education  expenditure,  with \nkindergarten (preschool) education at 17%, VTE at 4%, higher education7 at 19%, and other \nexpenditure8 at 12%. Of total expenditure on education in 2004, recurrent expenditure amounted to \n91.3%, capital expenditure 4.5%, and net lending (through the State Education and Training Fund) \n4.2%. \n \n12.  Depending on the location of schools, between 70% and 90% of school budgets are spent \non personnel and heating costs.9 The Government\u2019s commitment to meet salaries and heating \ncosts will continue to absorb most of the annual budget for education. Education financing is \nexpected to remain sufficient over the short to medium term to maintain the current status of the \neducation  system.10  However,  given  the  high  level  of  investment  needs  in  the  sector,  while \ngovernment  expenditure  is  expected  to  be  sufficient  to  cover  recurrent  expenditure  and \nincremental O&M costs, it is unlikely to be able to accommodate further increases in investment \n                                                 \n7  Including expenditure on student loans and grants through the State Education and Training Fund (SETF). \n8  Including expenditure on MECS itself, aimag (province) education and culture departments, culture, science, and \nadditional sectoral investment. \n9  Of recurrent expenditure for primary and secondary education in 2004, the costs of personnel (salaries, allowances, \nand insurance contributions) amounted to 64%; heating 17%; food 5%; electricity 2%; water supply, transport, and fuel \n2%; current renovation (maintenance) 2%; other goods and services 7%; and subsidies and transfers 1%. For \nvocational and technical education, the proportions were personnel 41%; heating 17%; food 7%; electricity 5%; water \nsupply, transport, and fuel 3%; current renovation (maintenance) 5%; other goods and services 21%; and subsidies \nand transfers 1%. \n10 Preliminary estimates of the Ministry of Finance and Economy indicate that education\u2019s share of GDP will rise to 8.2% \nin 2005, declining to 6.1% by 2008. \n ", "4 \nspending  for  the  sector  which  are  essential  to  rehabilitate  school  facilities  and  finance  the \nmodernization of the education system. The Government will be dependent on external assistance \nto meet future challenges in strengthening and modernizing the education system. \n \n13.  Despite gains over the past decade, the affordability of education continues to present \nchallenges for families, in particular for the poor. At the beginning of each school year, families \nmust meet new costs, including compulsory school uniforms, textbooks, a range of unofficial \ncharges made by schools (including enrolment and/or transfer \"fees\"), and informal incentive \npayments for teachers. There is only limited capacity within most communities for contributing to \nthe urgently required rehabilitation and maintenance needs of schools. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Issues and Challenges \n14.  National  Curriculum  Framework  and  Revised  Education  Standards.  The  planned \nintroduction of a new 12-year education system will need to be supported by curriculum reform and \nthe development of agreed education standards for each subject and grade level. At present, a \nconsistent broad curriculum frame linked to educational standards is not in place. The extension of \nthe schooling period has not been reflected in recent curriculum revisions. The current education \ncurriculum is overloaded with subjects and content requirements, with insufficient emphasis on \nmodern learning methodologies, and echoes learning arrangements of the socialist era, which are \nno longer consistent with the need for greater flexibility in subject selection and a student-centered \nteaching environment. MECS has started the process of revising education standards and a set of \nnew standards has been published. However, the new education standards have not yet taken into \naccount the need to modernize the curriculum framework; and teachers, parents, and textbook \nauthors find the standards too complex and difficult to translate into clear student competences. At \npresent, student examinations have little transparency due to lack of clear standards. Exams are \nnot prepared according to uniform national standards and are not comparable between schools, \nwhich makes it difficult to monitor quality.  \n \n15.  Teachers\u2019 Qualifications. The main constraints on improving educational quality are the \nlack  of  a  (i)  comprehensive  teacher  in-service  training  system,  and  (ii)  national  teacher \naccreditation system. Currently, there is no agreed national teacher accreditation system in place. \nStudents graduate from 38 universities and colleges with different levels of education. Training \nprograms at these universities and colleges do not follow agreed national standards. School and \naimag (province) authorities are in charge of teacher recruitment and assessment. However, due \nto the lack of national agreed professional standards and teacher accreditation schemes, the \nknowledge and competence of new teachers vary from school to school.  \n \n16.  The teaching techniques and subject knowledge of many teachers are inadequate and \noutdated and need to be upgraded, particularly in rural areas. The shortage of qualified English \nand vocational teachers is largely due to the inability of the education sector to compete with the \nprivate sector in employing personnel with these skills. Emphasis needs to be placed on improving \nteachers\u2019  working  conditions  and  upgrading  their  qualifications.  Currently,  in-service  teacher \ntraining is carried out by 22 Education and Culture Departments (ECDs) at aimag level, some \nuniversities and colleges, and donor supported projects. However, training programs do not follow \nnational standards, are not coordinated, and do not include all teachers employed by the system. \nThe new national curriculum frame and the extension of the schooling period by 2 years will place \nnew demands on teacher\u2019s skills and competencies. \n \n ", "5 \n17.  Facilities. A major constraint on increasing enrollment and retention and improving the \nquality  of  education  services  is  the  limited  capacity  of  school  facilities,  which  continues  to \ndeteriorate due to inadequate maintenance and investment. This has been particularly acute in \nrural areas, where budget funds for O&M and resources for rehabilitation are scarce. Lack of safe \nwater and sanitation pose significant hygiene and health risks, especially for students in dormitory \nfacilities. Building construction and technology of schools, which have not yet benefited form \nrehabilitation measures, are based on 30-year old construction standards that are inefficient in \nterms of use of materials, structural capacity, and energy performance. Insulations are poor and \nurban schools\u2019 heating systems are usually linked to a public heating distribution system without \nmetering or control of consumption.  \n \n18.  Recent large-scale migration from rural to urban areas\u2014in addition to being one of the \nresults of declining service provision in rural areas\u2014has caused major imbalances in educational \nservice provision and has greatly tested the capacity of schools in areas witnessing high population \ninflows.11 Schools in urban centers have seen demand for services increase substantially, while \nsome rural schools are now operating below capacity as a result of outflows from their catchment \nareas. The introduction of a 12-year system in 2008 will cause a significant increase in student \nnumbers in the national education system, which will be an additional burden on schools\u2019 capacity. \nThe increase in enrollments and lack of additional school space will force about one third of all \nsecondary schools to conduct classes in two or even three shifts. MECS has identified 200 out of \n710 schools in urgent need of rehabilitation, which will require donor assistance due to national \nbudget constraints. The lack of adequate teaching aids and learning materials is another major \nconstraint on applying modern teaching methodologies. In rural schools, in particular, teaching \nequipment for science subjects and up-to-date computer equipment are lacking. Reliance on more \ntraditional resources, such as chalkboard and textbooks, in pre-service and in-service training had \nled to teaching being dominated by traditional \"chalk and talk\" centered learning. \n \n19.  Vocational and technical education has been one of most neglected areas of education \nin Mongolia. The Government enacted legislation to encourage the private sector to become \ninvolved in VTE and subsequently reduced its role in this subsector. However, only a few private \ntraining providers and companies are engaged in vocational education and are providing support. \nCurrently, there is a serious mismatch between skills supply and labor market demand, which \nimpedes further economic growth and leads to lack of sufficiently skilled labor. The economic \nconsequences  of  these  deficiencies  are  unemployment,  lagging  competitiveness,  insufficient \ninnovation, and low productivity. At present, MECS is the sole public provider of VTE for youth. \nTraining programs for youth offered by private training institutions are limited to few sectors in \nurban areas. Students from rural areas are disadvantaged in gaining access to private training and \nchildren from poor families are unable to afford training fees. A lack of employment opportunities \nand adequate private and public training provisions make it crucial to promote VTE as a means to \nprovide employable skills and knowledge to students who do not advance to higher education.   \n \n20.  Mongolia\u2019s VTE system is in need of comprehensive reform. The current VTE program\u2014\noffering a combined 2.5-year professional and general education based on the former Soviet \nsystem\u2014is not responsive to labor market demands or cost-effective. Although VTE students \ndeclined from 11% in 1987 to 4% in 2004 as a proportion of all students in grades 1\u201310, enrollment \nin VTE institutions increased from 12,177 in 2000 to 21,911 in 2004. Graduates of the combined \nsystem have difficulty competing with the academic performance of graduates from the general \nsecondary education stream, and do not find jobs easily after graduation without further on-the-job-\ntraining due to their lack of employable skills. With the introduction of the 12-year school system, \n                                                 \n11 Between 1990 and 2000, the population in Ulaanbaatar increased by 27%.Today about one third of the capital's \npopulation of about 950,000 are migrants. \n ", "6 \nthe vocational education system will need to adjust to the new national curriculum framework. The \nnew school organizational structure will have implications for the entry level and entry qualifications \nof students enrolling in VTE, and needs to be reflected in the development of new vocational \ncurriculum modules.  \n \n21.  Training  programs  currently  offered  by  MECS  are  supply-driven  and  have  not  yet \nsignificantly refocused on the emerging needs of the labor market. VTE institutions are often not \nfully aware of industry\u2019s needs and are not able to explore ways to involve industry (such as on-\nthe-job training, attachments, and apprenticeship programs). School facilities have deteriorated, \nadequate training equipment is lacking or outdated, and consumables and tools are lacking. The \nteaching techniques, technical skills, and knowledge of many teachers are outdated and need to \nbe upgraded. Teachers have no benchmarks to measure their own technical and instructional \ncapability, and thus have no means of determining the gap between their current performance and \ndesired capability. Cooperation between MECS, MLSW, and other training providers is weak. A \nnational policy on VTE (linking both systems under MECS and MLSW with present and future labor \nmarket needs) and a recognized national system for skills standards are not in place.  \n \n2.  Government Policy \n22.  The Government\u2019s Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGSPRS), \nthe National Action Plan, and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for education, together \ndescribe  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  in  the  education  sector.  The  Project  will \ncontribute to two MDGs: \u201cAchieve universal primary education\u201d and \u201cEliminate gender disparity in \nprimary and secondary education\u201d. The Government considers strengthening the education system \nas an integral part of its (i) economic growth strategy, aimed at steady, private sector-led growth; \nand (ii) social strategy, aimed at improving access of the poor to stable income opportunities and \nimproving the quality and accessibility of public services.  \n \n23.  The Government\u2019s education policy has been driven by the Education Sector Strategy \n(ESS) (2000\u20132005) and the Education for All strategic plan. The major focus of the ESS has been \non improvements in (i) access to, and quality and relevance of, basic education services; and \n(ii) development of qualified and competitive human resources, contributing to raise economic \ngrowth. Building on the achievements and lessons learned from the ESS (2000\u20132005), MECS is \ncurrently developing a new Education Master Plan for 2006\u20132015 with assistance from ADB. \n \n3.  External Assistance to the Sector \n24.  ADB and the Government of Japan are the major development partners in the education \nsector in Mongolia. ADB has supported the Government\u2019s efforts to strengthen the education \nsystem since the early 1990s (para 30). The Government of Japan is financing the upgrading of \nprimary  and  secondary  schools,  strengthening  teacher  training,  and  providing  support  for \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) in education. ADB has coordinated with the \nCanadian International Development Agency, whose feasibility study on school construction and \nrehabilitation contributed significantly to the SEDP\u2019s design. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF)  is  active  in preschool, nonformal,  and  primary  education.  The  Danish  International  \nDevelopment Assistance agency has supported the development of 40 rural schools. The World \nBank has financed small-scale renovations of schools under its Poverty Alleviation Program and is \nfinancing a public expenditure tracking survey in the education sector. Currently, the World Bank is \npreparing  a  Rural  Education  Support  Project  financed  from  an  International  Development \nAssociation  grant.  Germany  has  provided  support  for  selected  vocational  schools  while  the \nEuropean Union has provided support for higher education. With the exception of assistance \nprovided  by  ADB  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  inputs  by  these \n ", "7 \nagencies have been relatively modest in financial terms. In 2004, the Government submitted a \nproposal to the Millennium Challenge Corporation with a sizeable educational component, which is \ncurrently under review. An overview of donor funded projects is in Appendix 3. The project design \nhas been prepared in close coordination with JICA, World Bank, UNICEF, and Germany [GTZ].  \n \n25.  At present, investment in the education sector is fragmented. Externally financed projects \nare largely planned and executed directly between development agencies and the Government, \nlimiting coordination and coherence between projects and raising transaction costs. To enhance \nharmonization and coordination, and improve the efficiency of donor assistance, the Government \nand the donor community agreed that the current cooperation mechanism needs to be improved. \nDonor interventions should be fully in accordance with government policies, under government \nleadership. At the initiative of ADB, World Bank, JICA, and UNICEF, the proposal to gradually \nestablish a sector wide approach (SWAp) in the education sector emerged, with agreement that \nADB would take the lead. The proposed SWAp strategy will be underpinned by a partnership-\nbased approach aimed at enhancing joint donor planning towards direct budget support for the \nnational education system. As a first step in that direction, MECS and key donors have formally \nagreed to establish a donor consultative mechanism in education, aimed at enhancing donor \ncoordination and harmonization within the framework of the new Master Plan. \n  \n4.  Lessons Learned \n26.  The project design takes into consideration experience gained and lessons learned in \nimplementing the ESDP, the ongoing SEDP, and the project for Innovating Rural Education in \nMongolia through ICT (IIREM).12 Through ESDP\u2019s reform program, the education facilities and staff \nof around 120 primary and secondary schools were rationalized and merged into 45 complex \nschools, which contributed to improving the effectiveness of the education system and quality of \neducation services. By 2004, 210 schools have been rehabilitated under the ESDP and SEDP, \nwhich has resulted in stronger student participation in rural areas, decreased dropout rates, and \nimproved  teaching  and  learning  environments.  The  Project  will  benefit  from  the  technical \nexperience in school rehabilitation, in particular regarding improving heating systems, sanitation, \nand roof repairs. The selection criteria for schools to be rehabilitated under the Project will consider \nindicators to increase participation of poor students in rural areas and students from migrant \nfamilies in urban centers. \n \n27.  SEDP and IIREM have developed strategies for using ICT to bring education content, \nmodern pedagogy, and information to schools. Lessons learned from these projects will help to \ndevelop  a  new  in-service  teacher  training  approach  based  on  ICT  methods.  Further  lessons \nlearned relate to the need to ensure that (i) adequate O&M budgets and preventive maintenance of \nrehabilitated school facilities are provided, (ii) necessary infrastructure is in place prior to the \nprovision of modern teaching and learning equipment, and (iii) sufficient budgets are in place to \ncover ensuing expenditures for utilizing ICT equipment and facilities efficiently. \n \n28.  A major lesson learned relates to the importance of donor coordination. At present, the level \nof harmonization of donor activities in the education sector is low and MECS manages donor \nfunded projects largely on an individual basis. The Project\u2019s strategy aims at achieving improved \ndonor harmonization and coordination across the sector. Through an associated TA, the project \ndesign addresses the need to strengthen MECS\u2019 core technical and management capacity to \nenable the ministry to take a phased approach to establishing a SWAp in education. \n                                                 \n12\nADB. 2004. Grant Assistance to Mongolia for Innovating Rural Education in Mongolia. Manila. IIREM aims at \nestablishing a replicable model for using ICT to bring education content, modern pedagogy, and information to poor \nrural schools; and includes empowerment of rural teachers in basic education grades to improve teaching practice and \nfoster a pupil centered learning environment. \n ", "8 \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n29.  ADB\u2019s assistance to the education sector in Mongolia has evolved since the early 1990s to \nsupport the Government in the different stages of reforming and strengthening the education \nsystem. ESDP was approved in 1996 and included (i) a program loan to support fundamental \npolicy reforms in the organization, management, staffing, and financing of the education sector; \nand (ii) a project loan to support initial investments. SEDP was approved in 2002 and builds on the \ninitial reform framework established by ESDP, with focus on school and kindergarten rehabilitation, \nprovision of learning materials, and limited support in curriculum development and teacher training. \nESDP was completed in 2002 and rated highly successful in the project completion report.13 The \nimplementation progress of SEDP is fully satisfactory. The Project focuses on two major features \nwhich have not been addressed by previous interventions: (i) a comprehensive curriculum reform \nin support of the Government\u2019s decision to extend the schooling period by 2 years, which will align \nMongolia\u2019s  education  system  with  international  standards;  and  (ii)  reforming  the  current  VTE \nsystem, which is a government priority, to promote economic growth. \n \n30.  The focus of the Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Education.14 Activities are aimed \nat reducing poverty and providing knowledge and skills essential to meet the needs of a demand-\ndriven modern economy. ADB\u2019s strategy in the education sector, as outlined in the CSP 2006\u2013\n2008, will remain focused on (i) improving access to, and quality of, basic education services; (ii) \nmore  efficient  and  effective  education  provision;  (iii)  promoting  demand-driven  vocational \neducation; and (iv) more effective donor coordination. The new Education Master Plan 2006\u2013\n201515 is considered a key sector output, which will provide a strategic framework to ensure that \neducation spending and investment in the sector is evidence-based, informed, and sustainable. \nAfter supporting the Government in reforming the curriculum framework and adopting a SWAp in \nthe education sector, future ADB assistance is expected to focus on providing education services \nto rural and marginal urban populations and further development of private provision of education \nand skills training, as set out in the CSPU 2005\u20132006.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  The impact of the Project will be improved employability and income-earning opportunities \nof graduates from secondary and vocational education. The project outcome is more equitable \naccess to\u2014and improved quality and relevance of\u2014primary, secondary, and vocational education. \n \nB.  Outputs \n32.  The Project has three components: (i) developing a national curriculum framework and \naligned education standards, (ii) improving teaching and learning environments in primary and \nsecondary schools, and (iii) promoting demand-driven vocational education for youth. \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB.2003.

Manila.  \n ", "9 \n1.  Component  1:  Developing  a  National  Curriculum  Framework  and  Aligned \nEducation Standards \n \n33.  The Project will assist MECS in developing a new national curriculum framework for the 12-\nyear education system,16 related education standards, professional standards for teachers, and an \nin-service training system with the objective to improve the quality, relevance, and efficiency of \nprimary and secondary education. Four subcomponents will contribute to meet these objectives: \n(i) developing a national 12-year curriculum framework, including the rationalization of subjects for \nbasic education; (ii) establishing a mechanism to streamline educational standards, based on the \nnew  curriculum  framework,  and  linking  them  to  national  standards  for  teacher  education; \n(iii) establishing a national accreditation system for pre-service teacher training programs and a \nteacher certification system; and (iv) establishing a comprehensive professional development and \nin-service teacher training system based on the new standards and national curriculum framework. \nThe component will include assistance to develop strategies for textbook preparation, including the \nestablishment of national textbook standards. \n \na.  Development of a National Curriculum Framework \n34.  This  subcomponent  will  assist  MECS  in  rationalizing  the  number  of  subjects  in  basic \neducation and developing a new national curriculum framework based on core subjects organized \ninto key learning areas (KLAs)17 and key learning outcomes. The curriculum framework will be \nstudent-centered and will include (i) the scope and sequence of student learning for all core \nsubjects; (ii) a national curriculum statement; (iii) a national policy for assessment and reporting; \n(iv) teacher guides for preschool, primary, and secondary education; (v) new syllabi and teacher \nguides for integrated subjects;18 (vi) in-service modules to support implementation of the curriculum \nframework; and (vii) implementation guides for school head teachers. Prior to the development of \nthe  national  curriculum  framework,  30  teacher  educators  selected  from  MECS,  universities, \ncolleges, and schools will receive up to 3 months training in overseas departments of education \nwhere  they  will  work  alongside  education  officers  responsible  for  curriculum  and  education \nstandards.  Criteria  to  select  the  teacher  educators  will  be  developed  by  MECS,  with  ADB \nconcurrence. Supported by international and domestic consultants, these teacher educators will\u2014\njointly with MECS\u2014develop the new curriculum framework and revise standards and guidelines for \ntextbook development. The national curriculum framework will be accompanied by developing \nuser-friendly manuals for understanding and using the framework, teaching methods handbooks \nfor each of the core subjects, and teacher guidebooks. These manuals and guidebooks will be \nprovided to all 21,000 primary and secondary teachers. A further 4,000 sets of materials will be \nprepared for graduates entering the teaching profession during the life of the Project.  \n \nb.  Strengthening National Education Standards \n35.  The objective of this subcomponent is to assist MECS in developing education standards \nfor each subject and grade consistent with the new national curriculum framework. The national \neducation standards will provide the education system\u2019s expectations of students in each subject, \ndescribing what students should know and be able to do at each grade level. The education \nstandards will reflect the increasing complexity and sophistication that students are expected to \n                                                 \n16 The project design acknowledges the importance of early childhood education to improve the learning abilities of \nstudents and reduce dropout rates. The curriculum framework will include curriculum revision for preschool, covering \nchildren aged 3\u20135. UNICEF intends to assist MECS in revising the curriculum and standards for kindergarten students.   \n17  MECS is rationalizing the current curriculum to a new set of core subjects covering KLAs, including the arts, health, \nphysical education, foreign languages, mathematics, Mongolian (language and literature), science, social studies \n(history and geography), and technology. \n18 Physics, chemistry, and biology will be integrated into natural science for grades 6\u20139. \n ", "10 \nachieve  as  they  progress  through  school.  Eighty  teachers  with  a  strong  grasp  of  curriculum \npractice will receive 4 weeks\u2019 training on developing education standards and improving the quality \nof learning assessments provided by international and domestic experts. Groups of 10 teachers \nwill be trained to focus on each of the nine core subjects and allied KLAs. This group of 80 \nteachers will lead the revision of the educational standards to conform with the new 12-year \ncurriculum framework, jointly with education experts from the National Center on Standardization \nand Metrology, the Institute of Education, and the 30 teacher educators. Based on the national \ncurriculum  framework  and  the  revised  education  standards,  the  Project  will  assist  MECS  in \nestablishing  a  National  Education  Examination  Scheme  to  ensure  uniform  standards  of \nexaminations in grades 8, 10, and 12. \n \nc.  Establishing a National Accreditation System for Pre-Service  \n            Programs and Developing a Teacher Certification System \n \n36.  In parallel with the development of the new curriculum framework and the revision of \neducation  standards,  the  Project  will  support  the  Mongolian  National  Council  for  Education \nAccreditation (NCEA) in developing an accreditation system for pre-service teacher programs. To \nensure  the  quality  of  pre-service  teacher  training,  university  and  college  teacher  education \nprograms will need to be approved by NCEA. Five key officers from NCEA, MECS, and the \nUniversities and Professional Teacher Association will participate in a 10-day overseas training \nprogram on accreditation systems. In addition, the 30 teacher educators will provide training on the \nnew curriculum framework for department heads and program directors from universities and \ncolleges to make certain that pre-service programs follow the new curriculum framework. To \nensure that new teachers meet the required qualification, the Project will support MECS in the \nestablishment of a teacher accreditation system for graduates of teacher training programs. \n \nd.  Strengthening Professional Development for Teachers \n37.  This subcomponent will strengthen in-service training of teachers to implement the new \ncurriculum and improve learning assessment. The Project will assist MECS in establishing an in-\nservice teacher training system which will provide continuous training opportunities to upgrade the \ncapacity of teachers. Supported by national consultants and education standards specialists, the \nteacher  educators  trained  overseas  on  curriculum  and  standards  development  will  train  300 \nteacher mentors across Mongolia, who will, in turn, train teachers to implement the new curriculum \nin schools, applying student-centered teaching methods and new assessment techniques. Teacher \nmentors will be given 4 weeks of training and equipped with manuals. Training programs will be \nconducted in cooperation with the ECDs at aimag level and will include all teachers currently in \nservice.  \n \n38.  In addition to in-service training conducted by teacher mentors, the Project will support \nMECS to establish an ICT-based teacher training platform that will offer updated information on \neducation content, modern pedagogy, relevant support for lesson plans, and reference material for \nteachers. Many ECDs have state-of-the-art ICT facilities, including video conference facilities and \nInternet access, enabling teachers to engage in interactive in-service teacher training. This highly \neffective  means  of  professional  development  for  teachers  needs  to  be  strengthened  and \nexpanded. In building on the achievements of SEDP and IIREM, the Project will assist MECS to \nfurther  develop  and  implement  a  continuous  in-service  teacher  training  approach  using  ICT \ntechnology and distance learning. Selected teachers and experts from universities, ECDs, and the \nInstitute of Education will design new professional development programs for teachers, focusing on \nschool-based curriculum development and student-centered teaching methodologies. The Project \nwill build on teacher education initiatives started under SEDP and draw on examples of best \npractice teacher education from other projects supported by donors, nongovernment organizations \n ", "11 \n(NGOs), and the private sector. Training packages will include virtual textbooks and instructional \nmaterials using a combination of CD-ROM instructional programs and distance learning developed \nby a range of agencies. The computers provided under SEDP and proposed under the Project will \nprovide a technological base for transforming teacher professional development from lectures to \ninteractive learning, using computer-based problem solving techniques. Virtual science laboratories \nas a substitute for scarce textbooks will also be explored under this subcomponent. \n \n2.  Component 2: Improving the Learning Environment in Primary and  \n Secondary Schools \n \n39.  This component will assist MECS to improve the teaching and learning environment in \nprimary and secondary schools and rationalize O&M costs. About 45 schools will be identified for \ncomprehensive  rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation  priorities include  (i)  provision  of adequate  heating \nsystems  and  insulation;  (ii)  improvement  of  roof  structures;  (iii)  repair  of  sanitation  systems; \n(iv) repair  of  defective  walls  and  ceilings  (including  replacement  of  damaged  floors,  doors, \nwindows); and (v) upgrading of school and dormitory facilities. To improve access for disabled \nstudents, who may have faced exclusion, rehabilitation works will include provision of facilities for \nwheelchair-bound students, adjusted furniture, equipment, and improved sanitary facilities. Building \non the experience gained in rehabilitating schools under ESDP and SEDP, local civil engineering \nconsultants will support the Construction Client Unit (CCU) in MECS in planning and supervising \nrehabilitation works. Lessons learned in establishing \"child-friendly schools\" under the UNICEF \nprogram will be incorporated. UNICEF intends to provide assistance to advise CCU on the design \nof rehabilitation works. Key rehabilitation activities will be scheduled to coincide with the long \nsummer holidays to minimize disruption to school operations. The current state of school facilities \nis described in Appendix 5. \n \n40.  To improve the quality of teaching and learning, a package of educational equipment will be \nprovided to each of the rehabilitated schools consisting of classroom furniture, basic science \nlaboratory equipment and simple science kits, and ICT equipment (including classroom computers \nand software applications). A set of hand tools and equipment will be provided to each school for \nuse in routine maintenance work by school maintenance personnel. \n \n41.  To achieve community ownership of the rehabilitated school plant and ensure the provision \nof  regular  maintenance,  school  management  community  members  will  (i)  be  involved  in  the \nplanning of rehabilitation works, and (ii) participate in the day-to-day supervision by working in \npartnership with the civil engineer to ensure that contractors implement rehabilitation works as \nspecified in the rehabilitation contract. The expertise of JICA\u2019s Community-Based Rehabilitation \nProject will be tapped to assist the CCU and the project implementation unit (PIU) in developing a \nstrategy to mobilize community support in school rehabilitation. \n \n42.  MECS has provided a priority list of schools to be rehabilitated under this component. The \nselection criteria include (i) schools with high enrollments of students from poor families and/or \nmigrants, (ii) school staff and community members\u2019 commitment to participate in the rehabilitation \nand  maintenance  works,  and  (iii)  evidence  that  adequate  O&M  budget  will  be  provided  for \nrehabilitated schools. Proposed selection criteria for schools to be rehabilitated are in Appendix 6. \nFinal selection of schools and scope of rehabilitation works will be submitted by MECS for ADB \nconcurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n43.  At least 30 schools will be selected as model schools for effective teaching. Schools will be \nselected from among those already rehabilitated under ESDP, SEDP, and JICA support, and are \nconsidered to be model schools in particular subject areas. These model schools will be developed \nto serve as venues for in-service teacher training, including the application of ICT-based training to \n ", "12 \nimprove student-centered teaching and learning methods based on the new curriculum. Upgrading \nof model school facilities will include the (i) provision of ICT equipment and software for developing \nand  producing  teaching  and  learning  materials,  (ii)  provision  of  teaching  equipment  for \nmultipurpose rooms, and (iii) upgrading of library facilities with provision of textbooks and reference \nmaterials.  Model  schools  will  also  need  to  demonstrate  child-friendly  school  strategies  and \npreparedness to enroll disabled children and children from poor families. \n \n  3.  Component 3: Promoting Demand-Driven Vocational Education \n \n44.  At present, MECS is the sole public sector provider of VTE for youth. The objective of this \ncomponent is to assist MECS in reforming the current VTE system to improve the quality and \nrelevance of VTE and make it more demand-driven, which will contribute to increased employment \nand  earning  opportunities  for  graduates.  A  reformed  VTE  system  will  address  the  mismatch \nbetween  skills  supply  and  labor  market  demand.  The  component  has  two  subcomponents: \n(i) establishing a policy framework conducive to promote demand-driven VTE, including stimulating \nprivate training provision; and (ii) rehabilitation of facilities and upgrading of training equipment of \nsix VTE institutions. \n \na.  Establishing a Policy Framework for VTE \n \n45.  The Project will assist MECS to develop\u2014jointly with MLSW, other major government \nstakeholders, and industry\u2014a national policy framework promoting demand-driven VTE. The policy \nframework will (i) streamline legal, regulatory, and institutional arrangements for the subsector; \n(ii) define the roles and responsibilities of all major stakeholders; and (iii) provide national skills \nstandards  and  a  National  Vocational  Qualification  (NVQ)  system  based  on  standards  of \ncompetence set by industry. The Project will take into consideration lessons learned from the \nSocial  Security  Sector  Development  Program,19  which  initiated  policy  changes  to  promote \nemployment through skills training and entrepreneurship development and has developed skills \ntraining modules. An analysis of the VTE subsector is in Appendix 7.  \n \n46.  Parallel to the development of a national policy framework, the Project will assist MECS in \nreforming the current VTE system, in particular addressing challenges related to (i) the revision of \nthe current 2.5-year combined professional and general education program; (ii) developing new \nprofiles  for  VTE  institutions,  focusing  on  the  provision  of  relevant  demand-driven  vocational \neducation  programs  for  skilled  labor;  (iii)  adjusting  VTE  programs  to  the  reformed  national \ncurriculum framework and the extended grade 1\u201312 school structure (including the amendment of \nentry  levels  and  qualification  requirements  of  students);  (iv)  developing  new  demand-driven \ncurriculum  in  close  cooperation  with  industry,  based  on  market  surveys  and  internationally \naccepted standards; and (v) qualification of vocational teachers and the need for an in-service \nteacher training system.20 In addition to the reform of vocational education for skilled workers, the \nProject will assist MECS in reviewing diploma and bachelor programs offered by 6 technical \ncolleges and 12 branch schools to improve the demand orientation of its curriculum in line with \nlabor market needs and revised national skills standards. \n \n47.  The Project will implement a public information campaign to (i) enhance awareness among \nthe public, students, and parents about the new profile of VTE institutions and income-earning and \nemployment  opportunities  of  VTE  graduates;  and  (ii)  improve  the  low  social  status  of  VTE. \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Mongolia \nfor the Social Security Sector Development Program. Manila. \n20 JICA has indicated that it will consider providing a technical assistance to support MECS in the areas of curriculum \ndevelopment and teacher training. \n ", "13 \nAwareness  promotion  will  include  multimedia  campaigns  and  printed  material.  A  professional \nmedia company will be contracted to prepare and conduct the public information campaign. \n \n48.  Germany [GTZ] intends to support project activities by providing 40 person-months of \ninternational consulting services to assist MECS in policy development, preparation of a transition \nstrategy for VETCs and VTPCs, development of national skills standards, preparation of the NVQ, \ndesign of demand-driven curriculum modules, and preparation of an awareness strategy.  \n \n    b.  Establishing Model Institutions for Vocational Education \n \n49.  Once an agreed national VTE policy framework and an approved reform strategy for the \nVTE system is in place, six VTE institutions will be selected for rehabilitation and modernization. \nThe selection criteria will include (i) preparedness to enroll students from poor and/or migrated \nfamilies, (ii) evidence that adequate budget will be provided for O&M of equipment and provision of \nconsumables, (iii) confirmation that the new curriculum at institution level is relevant and demand-\ndriven, (iv) evidence of industry involvement, and (v) availability of qualified teachers. The Project \nwill upgrade and rehabilitate school and dormitory facilities, including repair of heating systems and \nfloor and roof structures, improving sanitation and electrical systems, and provision of facilities for \ndisabled  students.  The  Project  will  provide  the  institutions  with  furniture,  teaching  aids,  and \n10 classroom computers (each with software applications to support teaching and learning). The \nselection of training equipment will be based on training programs to be conducted at the four \nmodel schools. Market surveys will be carried out to determine dynamic economic subsectors that \noffer high employment opportunities for graduates as skilled labor. \n \nC.  Special Features \n50.  By  establishing  a  national  12-year  curriculum  framework  with  consistent  education \nstandards and reforming the VTE system to become demand-driven, the Project will assist MECS \nin completing the transition of Mongolia\u2019s education system from the Soviet model to a system that \nis consistent with internationally accepted requirements of a market-based economy. Through \nimproving learning environments in rural areas, where poverty is prevalent, the attendance and \ncompletion rate of poor students will be increased. Only schools that have at least 30% of enrolled \nstudents from poor families will be selected for rehabilitation under the Project to ensure that poor \ncommunities will benefit from improved learning environments. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n51.  Model schools with a child-friendly learning environment and access to safe water and \nsanitation will demonstrate modern learning environments, student-centered teaching methods, \nintegration of disabled students, school-based curriculum development, and school-based teacher \nprofessional development. The introduction of uniform transparent student learning assessments\u2014\naligned to education standards\u2014will enable the Government to monitor quality improvements of \nthe education system. To further improve effectiveness and efficiency in the education sector, ADB \nwill provide TA to support MECS in improving donor coordination towards gradually establishing a \nSWAp in education. The new Education Master Plan will provide the policy structure to improve \ncoordination in the sector. The TA will include support in strengthening the financial management \nstructure as a precondition for developing a SWAp.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n52.  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $16.38  million  equivalent.  Of  the  total  cost, \n$3.83 million  (24%)  comprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $12.55  million  (76%)  the  local \ncurrency cost.

To  further  support  project  activities,  Germany  [GTZ]  has  indicated  that  it  will  provide \nadditional consulting inputs of $0.6 million on a grant basis, and UNICEF has indicated that it will \nprovide consultancy inputs of $0.09 million on a grant basis. In parallel with the ADB loan, the \nGovernment  of  Japan  will  provide  $26.3  million  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  to  support  the \neducation sector in Mongolia.22 \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n55.  The Executing Agency of the Project will be MECS. The project steering committee (PSC) \nestablished  under  SEDP  will  be  reorganized  and  will  consist  of  eight  members\u2014two \nrepresentatives from MECS, one from MLSW, and two from the Ministry of Finance and Economy; \nand one each from NGOs, industry, and development partners. The chairman will be appointed by \nthe minister of education and will be the project director. The PSC will provide strategic guidance, \n                                                 \n21 The allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented in special drawing rights (SDR) equivalent of \nUS dollars, with reference only to total expenditure, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Cost Sharing and Eligibility of \nExpenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. \n22  The Government of Japan\u2019s assistance will not be implemented through the Project. \n ", "15 \nmonitor the implementation of the Project, and ensure donor coordination. The PSC will meet \nquarterly, or as often as required. The project director will coordinate the overall implementation of \nproject activities.  \n \n56.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  through  the  current  SEDP-PIU,  staffed  by  a  project \nmanager and five additional staff, who will be responsible for the overall implementation of project \nactivities. Office space for the PIU will be provided by MECS. The PIU will report to the project \ndirector and provide quarterly results-based progress reports to the PSC, MECS management, and \nADB. The ongoing SEDP is expected to be completed in 2007 while the Project is planned to \ncommence in 2006. A joint implementation plan for activities planned for 2006\u20132007 will be agreed \non during the first quarter of implementation. After completion of the SEDP, qualified staff will be \nassigned through competitive selection and confirmed by PSC. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n57.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from September 2006 to September 2011. \nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n58.  All ADB-financed civil works, goods, and related services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works will involve rehabilitation of existing facilities, but \nthere will be no construction of new facilities. Civil work contracts will be less than $1 million. \nDomestic contractors are capable of carrying out all rehabilitation works, so civil work contracts \nestimated  to  cost  $1  million  or  less  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n59.  The Project will provide teaching aids, classroom furniture, learning materials, and manuals \nas well as ICT, laboratory, and VTE equipment. Equipment and goods estimated to cost more than \n$500,000 will be procured under international competitive bidding procedures. Equipment and \nmaterials estimated to cost $500,000 or less will be procured under national competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Teacher manuals and other equipment and materials valued at \n$100,000 or less will be procured by shopping. Procurement plan is in Appendix 10.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n60.  A total of 8 person-months of international and 265 person-months of national consulting \nservices will be contracted, financed by ADB funds. International and national consultants financed \nfrom ADB funds under component 1 will be recruited as firms under quality and cost based \nselection methods, using full technical proposals. National consultants under component 2 will be \nrecruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, or other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB in engaging national consultants. Under the guidance of the \nproject director, MECS will be fully involved in the selection process of the consultants. Consulting \nservices will include experts in the field of (i) curriculum and standards development, (ii) teacher \ntraining, (iii) civil engineers specialized in school rehabilitation, (iv) VTE policy development, and (v) \nNVQ development. Consulting service requirements and outline terms of reference for consultants \nare  in  Appendix  11.  In  order  to  field  consultants  as  soon  as  possible,  the  Government  has \nrequested advance recruitment action of a consulting firm. In addition, Germany [GTZ] intends to \nprovide 40 person-months of international consulting services, and UNICEF plans to provide 6 \nperson-months of international and 4 person-months of national consulting services from grant \nfunds. \n \n ", "16 \n5.  Anticorruption Measures \n61.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  government \nofficials. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, \nADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MECS \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Staff Development and Training \n62.  The Project will provide in-country and external training to upgrade skills and knowledge of \nkey counterparts from MECS, universities, NCEA, and ECDs. MECS will prepare the selection \ncriteria  for  training  candidates  for  approval  by  ADB  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness. \nSubsequently, the PIU will provide ADB with (i) a list of nominated candidates, (ii) proposed \ntraining  institutions,  and  (iii)  detailed  costing  of  the  proposed  training  programs.  The  training \nproviders will be selected based on competitive submission of training proposals. Facilities of \nmodel schools and ECDs will be used to conduct in-service teacher training programs. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n63.  The  proposed  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  to  expedite  disbursement  of  the  project \nproceeds. The PIU will open the account in a commercial bank selected by the Government, \nacceptable to ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed \n$250,000. \n \n64.  Statement of expenditure procedures will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures under \nADB-financed activities and liquidate advances provided to the imprest account, in accordance \nwith procedures satisfactory to ADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nEach individual payment reimbursed or liquidated under the procedures will not exceed $50,000 \nequivalent for each item of expenditure. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n65.  MECS will maintain the project accounts and prepare financial statements according to \ninternational accounting standards. MECS will have the project accounts and related financial \nstatements audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the \naudited project accounts and audited financial statements (including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the \nuse of loan proceeds, compliance with loan covenants, and the use of the imprest account under \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures) will be submitted to ADB in English not later than \n6 months after the end of each financial year. \n \n66.  The PIU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation to be approved by the \nPSC  and  submit  them  to  ADB  within  30  days  after  each  quarter. Reports  will  be  in  a  form \nacceptable to ADB and will indicate, among other matters, progress made against established \ntargets, problems and constraints encountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed to \nbe taken to resolve problems, compliance with loan covenants, and the proposed program of \nactivities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after completion of the Project, the PIU will \n ", "17 \nsubmit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  providing  details  about  project  implementation, \naccomplishments, costs, benefits, impacts, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n67.  Within  the  first  3  months  of  implementation,  the  PIU  will  prepare  a  detailed  project \nimplementation  plan  to  be  approved  by  the  PSC  and  will  establish  a  project  performance \nmanagement system in accordance with the ADB project performance management systems. In \naddition to the performance targets and indicators specified in the project design and monitoring \nframework, the Project will develop a monitoring mechanism to evaluate project impacts on the \nparticipation of disabled students and students from poor families. Results from surveys will be \nused  to  adjust  the  annual  implementation  plans.  The  PIU,  jointly  with  MECS,  will  develop  a \nstrategy to assess whether teacher training organized by the Project is being applied in classroom \nteaching,  and  monitor  the  progress  of  the  implementation  of  the  new  national  curriculum \nframework. A regular tracer system will be established to monitor whether graduates from revised \nVTE programs have been employed or started their own income-earning activities. Feedback from \nindustry  and  parents  will  be  collected  to  monitor  and  adjust  training  programs  and/or \nimplementation schedules regularly, if necessary. School rehabilitation works will also be evaluated \nannually by ADB, MECS, and community representatives. The rehabilitated schools will provide \nevidence that they have received sufficient budget to carry out preventive maintenance. Evaluation \nreports on rehabilitation measures will be submitted annually to the PSC and ADB for review. \n \n10.  Project Review \n68.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake semiannual reviews of the Project. The \nreviews will assess progress in each component, identify issues and constraints, and determine \nnecessary remedial action and adjustments. Germany [GTZ] and UNICEF will participate in the \nreviews. A midterm review will be conducted at the end of the third year of implementation. The \nmidterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and implementation arrangements and identify \nadjustments  required;  (ii)  assess  progress  of  the  project  implementation  against  performance \nindicators;  and  (iii)  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation  arrangements,  if \nnecessary. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n69.  ADB will provide associated TA for the development of a SWAp in the education sector. \nThe TA will strengthen the technical and management capacity of MECS in strategic planning and \npolicy analysis and enable the ministry to set up a SWAp in the education sector gradually. A key \nprecondition for the establishment of a SWAp\u2014to align development assistance with MECS policy \npriorities\u2014is the existence of a comprehensive policy framework that provides clear directions for \nbudget  planning  and  donor  interventions.  The  new  Education  Master  Plan  2006\u20132015,  being \nprepared with the assistance of ADB, will provide the necessary policy structure for improved \ncoordination, effectiveness, and efficiency in the sector. Since the Education Master Plan is being \nprepared in close consultation and cooperation with all key development partners, the process of \nestablishing a donor coordination mechanism is initiated. The TA will assist MECS in (i) developing \nannual  operational  implementation  strategies  to  meet  the  policy  objectives,  (ii)  identifying \ninvestment priorities for modernizing the school system and extending the schooling period as \nplanned, (iii) preparing annual and longer-term budget frameworks linked to the Education Master \nPlan (including financial plans for regional authorities), and (iv) building capacity to establish an \nefficient structure to collect data and other information needed for monitoring and performance \nevaluation.  \n \n ", "18 \n70.  MECS will be the Executing Agency of the TA. The TA will provide 3 person-months of \ninternational and 48 person-months of national consulting services, with specialists in the areas of \n(i) strategic planning and policy analysis, (ii) financial analysis and annual budget preparation \nlinked to the Education Master Plan, (iii) launching of a management information system to monitor \nthe  achievement  of  policy  objectives  established  under  the  Master  Plan,  and  (iv)  improving \ncoordination of development cooperation efforts. The consultants will be recruited individually in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto  ADB.  Procurement  of  office  equipment  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Upon TA completion, all equipment will be retained by MECS.  \n \n71.  The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The total \ncost of the TA is estimated at $210,000 equivalent, of which $55,000 is the foreign exchange cost \nand $155,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has requested ADB to finance \n$150,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost ($55,000) and $95,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost through the \nprovision of counterpart staff, office space and furniture for TA administration, workshop facilities, \nand transport and allowances of government officials. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, \ncommencing in March 2006. Details of the TA and outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 12. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n72.  Project  Beneficiaries.  Direct  beneficiaries  of  the  establishment  of  a  new  curriculum \nframework and the modernization of the education system will be all students enrolled in primary \nand secondary schools. Nationwide, about 560,000 students will benefit from improved curriculum, \nwell-defined education standards, and enhanced assessment systems. About 31,000 students and \n1,200 teachers will benefit from rehabilitated school and dormitory facilities in 45 schools. About \n23,000  students  and  900  teachers  of  30  model  schools  will  benefit  from  upgraded  teaching \nfacilities. About 21,400 teachers throughout the country will benefit from in-service teacher training \nprograms. About 21,900 students of vocational education intuitions will benefit from the reform of \nthe VTE system and a new demand-driven curriculum, which will improve their employment and \nincome-earning opportunities after graduation. Student and teachers of four key VTE institutions \nwill benefit from rehabilitated facilities and modern training equipment. Industries will benefit from \nimprovements in relevance and quality of VTE. Graduates of VTE institutions entering the labor \nforce will possess knowledge and skills that are in line with industry requirements, contribute to \nhigher labor productivity, and increase economic growth. \n \n73.  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Development  Impact.  The  Project  will  have  a  direct \nbeneficial impact on about 201,000 poor students in primary and secondary schools.23 Specific pro-\npoor and social development measures of the Project include the following: (i) targeted school for \nrehabilitation  should  have  at  least  30%  of  enrolled  students  coming  from  poor  families; \n(ii) enhanced access for disabled children to general secondary education; and (iii) community \ninvolvement in school rehabilitation and maintenance. Over 90% of teachers are female, and the \nProject  will  directly  benefit  all  teachers  through  its  training  programs,  which  are  expected  to \nenhance the attractiveness of the teaching profession. To improve gender responsiveness, the \nProject  will  develop  strategies  to  address  gender  stereotypes  in  curriculum  and  textbook \ndevelopment. The Project was designed through a participatory process. During implementation, \nthe Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation in its activities and benefit from improved \ndonor coordination. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. \n \n                                                 \n23 This assumes that 36% of the students on average are from poor families, a poverty indicator based on the World \nBank Living Standard Measurement Survey (1998\u20132002). \n ", "19 \n74.  Educational Benefits. The close link between educational development and reduction in \nthe incidence of poverty, improvement of productivity, economic growth, and improving general \nliving conditions is well established. The Project focuses on quality improvements of the national \neducation  system  to  complete  the  transition  of  Mongolia\u2019s  education  system  and  improve \nenrollment and retention rates, including (i) improved teaching and learning environments through \na modern and relevant curriculum, student-centered teaching methods, rehabilitated and upgraded \nschool and dormitory facilities, and modern teaching equipment and materials; (ii) improved criteria \nfor assessing students through the integration of education standards with the proposed national \ncurriculum framework; (iii) a uniform national system for accreditation of teacher training and \ncertification; and (iv) reforming the VTE system to become demand-driven, leading to improved \nincome-earning and employment opportunities for young graduates. In addressing early childhood \nrequirements in curriculum reform, the Project will have an impact on the level of efficiency of the \nprimary school cycle and reduce dropout rates.24  \n \n75.  Financial Benefits and Sustainability. The most significant economic benefit will come \nfrom  increases  in  future  earnings  of  school  graduates  with  better  education  attainment \n(Supplementary Appendix B). Capacity building assistance provided through the TA\u2014in supporting \nMECS  in  areas  related  to  financial  analysis  and  preparing  annual  and  longer-term  budget \nframeworks  linked  to  the  Education  Master  Plan\u2014will  contribute  to  improve  efficiency  and \neffectiveness in the delivery of education services and reduce transaction costs.  \n \n76.  Public expenditure on education as a share of GDP is estimated to average 6.5% in the \nperiod 2006\u20132008.25 It can be assumed that the budget will be sufficient to continue education \nservice delivery at the current rate and finance the modernization of the system. By rehabilitating \nschool facilities, particularly improving heating systems and insulation, the Project is expected to \ncontribute to significant reductions in O&M costs. The Government share in the Project is included \nin the budget. Based on a projection of education expenditure, it can be assumed that the Project \nis financially sustainable (Appendix 4 and Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n77.  Environmental and Social Safeguards. The Project will carry out minor rehabilitation and \nrepairs of existing school buildings and facilities with no land acquisition required, and no negative \nenvironmental or resettlement impact. Some school rehabilitation works will include improved water \nsupply and sanitation and sewage systems, which will promote good health and have a positive \nenvironmental impact. There are no issues of ethnic minority language of instruction in Mongolia, \ntherefore the Policy on Indigenous Peoples  is not applicable. \n \n78.  Assumptions. Successful implementation of the Project assumes that the Government will \n(i) maintain the high level of budget allocation for the education sector, (ii) be committed to improve \ndonor coordination to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of education \nservices, (iii) maintain its commitment to carry out education reforms (including national curriculum \nreform), (iv) provide adequate budget to provide in-service training for all teachers employed by the \nsystem, and (v) reform and rationalize the current VTE system. To achieve its impact, the Project \nassumes that further steady economic growth will create new job opportunities. \n \n79.  Risks. At present, MECS\u2019 managerial and technical capacity is limited, and might affect the \nsmooth  implementation  of  the  extension  of  the  school  system  to  a  12-year  system  and  the \nintroduction of the new curriculum framework nationwide. These risks will be mitigated through \ntraining  and  capacity  building  under  the  Project  and  associated  TA.  The  policy  impact  of \nintroducing new education standards and uniform assessments will be significant. Risks include \n                                                 \n24 It is well established that interventions in the early childhood development of children and their preparedness for \nschool result in significant improvements in school performance and reduced dropouts.  \n25  There is no reliable financial information available for years beyond 2008. \n ", "20 \nresistance from teachers and school directors to accept changes to implement the new curriculum \nframework  and  introduce  uniform  examinations.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  adopting  a \nparticipatory approach to project implementation\u2014actively involving school directors, teachers, and \ncommunities. Financial risks involve potential difficulties in the provision of incremental recurrent \ncosts  for  O&M  of  rehabilitated  schools.  To  mitigate  the  risk,  ADB  will  work  closely  with  the \nGovernment to ensure that adequate resources are allocated for the education sector, incremental \nrecurrent costs for O&M are assigned, and appropriate assurances are included. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n80.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n81.  The  Government  will  allocate  in  a  timely  manner  adequate  budget  funding  for \n(i) government counterpart salaries, (ii) its share of local costs in support of training programs, \n(iii) incremental  recurrent  costs  for  O&M  of  all  schools  and  VTE  institutions  rehabilitated  or \nsupported under the Project, and (iv) replacement capital costs for computer equipment to be \nprocured four to five years after initial procurement of such equipment. Prior to tendering of civil \nworks or provision and installation of equipment, MECS or concerned aimag administrations will \npresent evidence on the provision of sufficient budgetary resources for O&M costs of individual \nschools and VTE institutions supported under the Project.  \n \n82.  The  Government  shall  maintain  sufficient  annual  expenditure,  acceptable  to  ADB,  for \neducation sector activities during the Project implementation. In this connection, the Government \nwill annually provide ADB with information on allocations and actual expenditure for the education \nsector. \n \n83.  The Government will ensure through MECS that schools selected for rehabilitation and \nmodernization meet the criteria agreed by PSC and ADB as defined in Appendix 6.  \n \n84.  The Government will approve the new Education Master Plan not later than 1 year after \nloan effectiveness and will adopt a new national curriculum framework satisfactory to ADB within \n3 years of loan effectiveness. \n \n85.  The Government will ensure that the donor coordination mechanisms developed under the \nTA are in place, operational and complied with within 18 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n86.  The Government will ensure that all rehabilitation works under the Project are undertaken \nwithin the existing school facilities. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n87.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 8,794,000 to Mongolia for the Third Education \nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                President \n24 May 2006 \n ", "  Appendix 1       21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms \nImpact       \nEmployability and  \u2022  Increased number of  \u2022  National Statistics data   \u2022  Steady economic \nincome-earning  secondary school (grade 12)  \u2022  MECS baseline/research  growth creates new \nopportunities of  graduates accepted into  studies on secondary  job opportunities \ngraduates from  accredited HEIs and technical  school and VET \nsecondary and  colleges  graduates \nvocational schools \n\u2022  Increased number of  \u2022  Project management and \nimproved \nsecondary school/VTE  aimag (province) ECD \ngraduates obtaining work in  reports on high school/ \nthe formal sector or start their  TVET graduates \nown businesses within \n\u2022  Tracer studies \n6 months of graduation  \n\u2022  Satisfaction survey \n\u2022  Industry reports that time \nreports from employers \nrequired to train/retrain \nof secondary school/VTE \ngraduates from \ngraduates \nsecondary/VTE schools is \n\u2022  Progress reports on \nreduced \nMDGs \n\u2022  Youth unemployment rates \nreduced by 5% by 2011a   \n \n \nOutcome       \nEnhanced equitable  \u2022  Increased transition rate from  \u2022  MECS annual reports  \u2022 The Project is well \naccess to and improved  primary to lower secondary  generated through EMIS  coordinated with \nquality and relevance of  from 98.2% to 99% by 2011  \u2022  Grade 10 national  JICA\u2019s education \nprimary, secondary,  \u2022  Increased transition rate from  examination results  projects  \nand vocational \nlower to upper secondary from  published by MECS  \u2022 Education Master Plan \neducation \n76.3% to 90% by 2011   \u2022  Grade 12 national  is endorsed by 2006 \n\u2022  Dropout rates from basic  examination results  \u2022  Public expenditure on \neducation decreased from  published by MECS  education is sufficient \n2.3% to 1% by 2011    to finance planned  \n\u2022  GER for primary education   modernization of the \nincreased from 97% to 99%  school organizational \nby 2011  structure  \n\u2022  GER for secondary education \nin rural areas improved from \n70% to 85% in 2011 \n\u2022  Improved results in the \nuniform  national examinations \nunder the new systemb \nOutputs       \n1.

The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MECS) is the central administrative \nbody that formulates national educational policy and sets the standards for each level of formal \neducation.  The  Ministry  also  administers  general  provisions  on  education  matters,  teacher \ntraining, curriculum development, and state examination procedures, and is responsible for the \naccreditation of higher education institutions. The current structure of the formal education \nsystem is shown in Figure A2.1 while Table A2.1 provides a summary of basic institutional and \nenrollment indicators of the education sector in Mongolia over the past 5 years. Education \nsector financing is described in detail in Appendix 4. The Government\u2019s education policy has \nbeen driven by the Education Sector Strategy (ESS) 2000\u20132005. Its major focus has been on \nimprovements in access to, and quality and relevance of, basic education services. However, \nprioritized implementation strategies were lacking. Building on the achievements and lessons \nlearned  from  the  ESS  2000\u20132005,  and  based  on  a  comprehensive  sector  review,  a  new \nEducation Master Plan for 2006\u20132015 is being developed with the assistance of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \n2.  The formal education system in Mongolia consists of kindergarten and preschool (up to \nage 7), primary education (4 years), lower secondary education (4 years), and upper secondary \neducation (2 years). From the 2005\u20132006 school year, the Government will extend the structure \nof school education from grades 1\u201310 (4+4+2) to grades 1\u201311 (5+4+2), with the expectation of \nhaving  a  12-year  system  (6+3+3)  in  2008. Basic  education  (primary  and  lower  secondary \neducation)  is  compulsory  and  funded  by  the  state.  In  2004\u20132005,  557,346  students  were \nenrolled in 710 primary and secondary schools with a total of 21,458 teachers. In addition, \nMECS administers 43 higher education institutions and 42 vocational and technical education \n(VTE)  institutions.  VTE  institutions  consist  of  22  vocational  education  and  training  centers \n(VETCs)/vocational training and production centers (VTPCs) that offer a 2.5-year combined \nprofessional  and  general  education  based  on  the  former  Soviet  system,  which  leads  to  a \nprofessional  certificate  and  a  secondary  education  certificate;  and  14  branch  schools  and \n6 technical colleges that provide advanced training for higher-level skills development, leading \nto a professional diploma or bachelors degree. In 2004\u20132005, 21,911 students were enrolled in \nVETCs/VTPCs/branch schools. An assessment of the VTE system is provided in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Higher education has experienced the most rapid enrollment expansion of any level of \neducation in Mongolia over the past 4 years. The number of higher education institutions has \nincreased to 178 during the past 10 years, of which 135 are private. Enrollment in private higher \neducation institutions has more than doubled over the past 4 years. It is estimated that 80% of \nsecondary school graduates continue into postsecondary education. In 1994, the Government \nbegan requiring public higher education institutions to begin charging tuition at levels sufficient \nto cover the entire cost of academic staff salaries, thus generating a large reduction in the \ngovernment higher education budget. \n \n4.  The  strength  of  the  Mongolian  education  system  is  its  high  coverage  of  a  widely \ndispersed population. This is reflected in a gross enrollment rate of 98% among the school-age \npopulation and an adult literacy rate of 97%. Further, unlike most developing countries, girls are \nnot disadvantaged in the educational system. In fact, 60% of all students enrolled in higher \neducation in Mongolia are females. However, greater attention needs to be paid to address \nissues related to dropout rates. Table A2.1 reflects a decline in the dropout rate across the \nentire Mongolian education system, yet there are continuing concerns about the accuracy of \nofficial statistics. In a recent study of school dropouts in Mongolia, numbers of out of school \nchildren provided by different agencies ranged from 11,953 (MECS) to 68,115 (National Human \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nRights Commission of Mongolia). The study revealed that migrant children were more than \nthree times more likely to be out of school than long-term resident children.26 \n \n5.  Key issues in the current Mongolian education system are (i) poor quality and relevance \nof  the  current  curriculum  for  primary  and  secondary  education,  (ii)  inadequate  teaching \nqualifications  and  skills,  (iii)  weak  learning  and  teaching  environments  in  schools,  and \n(iv) supply-driven irrelevant vocational education for youth. Despite progress in revising the \ncurriculum and syllabi, the basic education curriculum remains overloaded with subject and \ncontent requirements, with insufficient emphasis on student-centered learning. The Government \nhas decided to extend the current organizational structure of school education from a 10-year \nsystem to a 12-year system in 2008, which will require reform of the curriculum framework and \ndevelopment  of  new  education  standards  linked  to  the  curriculum.  At  present,  student \nexaminations have little transparency due to lack of clear standards. Exams are not prepared \naccording to uniform national standards or comparable between schools, which makes it difficult \nto monitor quality. Lack of a comprehensive teacher in-service training system and a uniform \nnational teacher accreditation system are key constraints on improving the quality of education. \nTeachers graduate from universities and colleges with different levels of education. Teaching \ntechniques and subject knowledge of many teachers are inadequate and outdated and need to \nbe upgraded. In addition, the extension of the schooling period by 2 years will place new \ndemands on teachers\u2019 skills and competencies. \n \n6.  A major constraint in increasing enrolment and retention and in improving the quality of \neducation services is the limited capacity of school facilities, which continues to deteriorate. This \nhas been particularly acute in rural areas, where budget funds for preventive maintenance and \ntechnical resources for rehabilitation are scarce. Building construction and technology are based \non  30-year  old  construction  standards,  which  are  inefficient  in  terms  of  use  of  materials, \nstructural capacity, and energy performance. \n \n7.  Currently, the harmonization level of donor activities in the education sector is very low. \nDonor-funded projects are not linked to the overall policy framework and are managed largely \non an individual basis. The low coordination level results in ineffective and inefficient use of \nscarce resources in the education sector. The new Education Master Plan will provide the \nnecessary policy for improved coordination, effectiveness, and efficiency in the sector. Policy \nobjectives established under the master plan will need to be prioritized and translated into \noperational  implementation  strategies  and  annual  budget  plans.  However,  due  to  MECS \ncapacity limitations, an effective planning structure is not in place. Strategic planning, policy \nanalysis, and evaluative research need to be strengthened to enhance planning and budgeting.  \n                                                 \n26  Batbaatar, M., et al. 2005.

The education sector is financed principally from three sources: (i) central and local \nbudget, (ii) tuition fees (or core activities), and (iii) sale of goods and services (or noncore \nactivities).27 In the past 2 years, the State Education and Training Fund (SETF) has also been a \nsignificant source of revenue for vocational and technical education and higher education, as \nillustrated in Table A4.1. \nTable A4.1: Sources of Revenue by Subsector in 2004 \n(%) \nEducation  Kinder- Primary &  Vocational \nRevenue Source  Sector  garten  Secondary  & Technical  Higher  Other \nBudget  81.5  88.8  97.5  79.2    4.6  99.4 \nCore Activities  11.7  10.0    1.4    9.6  59.1    0.2 \nNoncore Activities    2.3    1.2    1.2    7.7    7.6    0.4 \nSETF    4.5    0.0    0.0    3.5  28.5    0.0 \nOthers    0.0    0.0    0.0    0.0    0.1    0.0 \nSETF = State Education and Training Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and World Bank estimates. \n \n2.  Public expenditure on education has been on average 7.8% of gross domestic product \n(GDP)  for  the  past  5 years,  falling  from  8.6%  in  2001  to  7.5%  in  2004  (Table  A4.2  and \nTable A4.4).28 This is considerably higher than for other transition economies.

Education\u2019s share of public expenditure has also remained consistently high, averaging \n18.6% over the 2000\u20132004 period, although it has not quite reached the more than 20% share \nas required by the Education Law, 1995, revised in 1998 (Article 33:1). \n4.  Subsectoral  Shares  of  Education  Expenditure.  Subsectoral  shares  of  public \neducation expenditure have fluctuated very little from 2000 to 2004 (Table A4.3). There have \nbeen slight declines in the shares of kindergarten, primary, and secondary education and higher \neducation; a slight increase in the share of vocational and technical education (VTE); and a \ndoubling of the share of other items of expenditure, which include the Ministry of Education, \n                                                 \n27 Data for 2003 received from the preliminary findings of the World Bank/Open Society Forum Public Expenditure \nTracking Survey being conducted in 2005 (for grades 1\u201310 schools, special schools, private schools, and \ntemporary courses) indicate that revenue sources were as follows in 2003: central budget 81.7%, local budget \n9.3%, tuition fees 4.1%, income generating activities 1.6%, donations 0.1%, project funds 0.4%, and others 2.7%. \n28 For reasons as yet unexplained, education expenditure figures given by the Ministry of Finance and Economy \n(MFE) are different from\u2014generally higher than\u2014those given by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science \n(MECS). According to MFE, education expenditure as a share of GDP has been on average 8% between 2000 and \n2004, falling from 8.8% in 2001 to 7.3% in 2004.

The overall increase in expenditure of 13.3% in 2001 over the previous year is reflected \nin each subsector, apart from VTE and other capital expenditure. In 2002, there was a decline in \ntotal recurrent expenditure but an increase in capital expenditure, mainly in the primary and \nsecondary education and other categories. In 2003, there was only a minimal increase in \nrecurrent expenditure overall\u2014with expenditure on kindergartens recovering to its 2000 level\u2014\nbut  a  further  increase  in  capital  expenditure,  except  in  the  VTE  subsector  where  capital \nexpenditure appears to have ceased altogether. In 2004, there was a significant increase in \nrecurrent expenditure (reflecting a 25% increase in the salaries of civil servants, including \nteachers) but a decline in capital expenditure overall in line with the Government\u2019s move to keep \nthe fiscal deficit in check. The approved budget of 2005 showed further increase in expenditure \nin real terms in each major category, especially in net lending (or SETF). \n6.  Expenditure Categories. Between 2001 and 2004, total expenditure on education30 has \non average comprised 92% recurrent expenditure, 5% capital expenditure, and 3% net lending. \nRecurrent expenditure consists of three main categories: (i) personnel costs (an average 51.6% \nof total recurrent expenditure between 2000 and 2004), which include salaries and wages, \nallowances, and social security or insurance schemes paid by the employer; (ii) other goods and \nservices (46.8%) including fixed costs and food; and (iii) subsidies and transfers (1.7%). \n7.  At  the  institutional  level,  these  proportions  are  less  balanced.  Fixed  costs  include \nelectricity,  heating,  transport  and  fuel,  and  water  supply  and  treatment\u2014in  a  country  with \nextremely  harsh  winters  where  heating  costs  are  high.  Food  is  also  an  important  item  of \n                                                 \n29 Since SETF is devoted to providing grants and loans to higher education students, and since there are problems in \nrecovering debts, it might make sense to include net lending under higher education. This would increase higher \neducation\u2019s share in 2004 to 19% and reduce the share of other expenditure (including additional sectoral \ninvestment) to 12%. \n30 The year 2000 was unusual in that recurrent expenditure was 98% of total public expenditure on education with \ncapital expenditure and net lending being approximately 1% each. \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \nexpenditure,  where  every  effort  is  made  to  encourage  children  (particularly  from  nomadic \nfamilies) to attend school by providing dormitory accommodation with state-financed food.

The \nEducation Law provides for a further fixed cost\u2014an extra year\u2019s salary for each teacher on \nretirement after 25 years\u2019 service\u2014which is allocated to the relevant schools. All other items31 of \nrecurrent expenditure are classed as variable costs. Recurrent expenditure on selected costs is \ndescribed in Figure A4.1. \nFigure A4.1: Average Share of Recurrent Expenditure of Selected Costs by  \nSubsector, 2000\u20132004 \n70.0\n60.0\n50.0\ne Personnel\ng\na  \nnt 40.0 Heating\nce Food \nPer 30.0 O&M\nOther\n20.0\n10.0\n0.0\nKindergarten  Primary  VTE Higher Sector \nand \nSecondary\nO&M = operation and maintenance, VTE = vocational and technical education. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and World Bank estimates. \n \n8.  As a proportion of recurrent expenditure in the sector, personnel costs are 51.6%, \nheating is 15.3%, food is 6.3%, and maintenance is 2.4%. However, in kindergartens, heating \nand food together are 39.2% of recurrent expenditure and, in primary and secondary schools, \nthe proportions are skewed towards personnel costs at 64.1% and heating at 18.6%. In the VTE \nsubsector, an average of 5.4% of recurrent expenditure has been devoted to maintenance as \nthe subsector relies heavily on capital equipment; its other major costs are for training and \npractice expenses (8.4%). For higher education, other major costs are also for training and \npractical expenses (9.5%), and payment for services provided by the private sector (10.5%), \nwhich effectively means personnel costs. \n9.  If we consider variable costs only (i.e., excluding fixed costs and food), kindergarten \npersonnel costs were 81.4% of variable costs (including subsidies and transfers) in 2004;  \ngeneral secondary personnel costs were 86.5%; and VTE personnel costs were 59%. For \nhigher education, personnel costs were 61.5% of the equivalent of variable costs in 2003. In \n2004, this was reduced to 2.9% as personnel costs were transferred to services provided by the \nprivate sector line. \n10.  At primary and secondary levels in particular, 14.5% of variable costs does not appear to \ncover the true cost of the day-to-day running of the school and the purchase of quality inputs, \n                                                 \n31 Including workshops for teachers, stationery, materials, communication expenses, minor facilities and furniture \nrepairs and maintenance, and uniforms for nonteaching support staff. \n ", "  Appendix 4  33 \nincluding teaching and learning materials and equipment over and above textbooks and in-\nservice teacher training (professional development). \n11.  Financing  Primary  and  Secondary  Education:  Expenditure  by  Aimag  and  Unit \nCosts per Student. Variable costs differ from region to region, from aimag to aimag, and in \ncomparison with Ulaanbaatar. Region by region, the proportion of students is roughly similar to \nthe proportion of total recurrent expenditure, with Ulaanbaatar\u2019s costs being less (28.4%) than \nits  proportion  of  students  (33.4%).  The  same  can  be  said  for  fixed  costs,  except  that \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s fixed costs are proportionately lower than for each of the regions; it is here that \nthe majority of double shift and triple shift schools operate, thus reducing the fixed cost per \nstudent, at least. However, when the unit considered is the school rather than the student, the \nrelationship between the proportion of fixed costs and the proportion of schools in each region is \nnot so disparate. With food, the Western Region has a lower proportion of costs (37.1%) than \nstudents living in dormitories (42.4%). Finally, with variable costs, the proportions of students \nand costs are roughly similar, with the Western Region being slightly more expensive and \nUlaanbaatar slightly less expensive. \n12.  However, when we consider per student unit costs (for total recurrent expenditure, food, \nfixed costs, and variable costs), there are great differences between regions, aimags, and \nUlaanbaatar.32  In  all  cases,  the  Southern  Region  had  the  highest  per  student  costs,  and \nUlaanbaatar had the lowest. \n13.  Per  dormitory  student  food  costs  were  on  average  MNT88,720,  ranging  from \nMNT35,626 in Ulaanbaatar, MNT49,474 in Zavkhan aimag (Western Region), to MNT131,202 \nin Gobisumber aimag (Southern Region). Per student variable costs averaged MNT88,270, \nranging from MNT83,024 in Arkhangai aimag (Central Region), MNT84,120 in Ulaanbaatar, to \nMNT108,907 in Zavkhan aimag (Western Region). Variable costs also differ according to level \nof education and whether the students are boarding or not. For example, in Darkhan-Uul aimag, \nthe variable unit cost in 2005 is MNT73,000 for a primary (grades 1\u20134) student, MNT91,600 for \na lower secondary (grades 5\u20138) student, MNT99,800 for an upper secondary (grades 9\u201310/11) \nstudent,  MNT110,900  for  a  boarding  lower  secondary  student,  and  MNT118,500  for  a \nkindergarten pupil. \n14.  Fixed  costs  per  school  averaged  MNT19,196,347  ranging  from  MNT11,923,888  in \nZavkhan  aimag  (Western  Region),  MNT18,881,244  in  Ulaanbaatar,  to  MNT34,227,087  in \nSukhbaatar  aimag  (Eastern  Region).  Per  student  fixed  and  variable  costs  averaged \nMNT112,562  ranging  from  MNT100,963  in  Ulaanbaatar,  MNT105,575  in  Khuvsgul  aimag \n(Northern Region), to MNT147,945 in Gobisumber aimag (Southern Region). Per student total \nrecurrent costs averaged MNT119,001 ranging from MNT101,178 in Ulaanbaatar, MNT109,898 \nin Darkhan-Uul aimag (Northern Region), to MNT160,146 in Gobi-Altai aimag (Western Region). \n15.  The Government\u2019s contribution to the Project is estimated at $4,962 million (26% of the \ntotal project cost) over 5 years. To date, provisional financial projections have only been made \nfor 2005\u20132008. There is no financial information for the years beyond 2008, although work is \ncurrently being carried out in estimating the financial framework for the proposed Education \nMaster Plan 2006\u20132015. \n                                                 \n32 Regional differences for each type of expenditure are illustrated in Figures 3.2\u20133.5 in the Supplementary Appendix.  \nIn both Table S23 and Figures 3.2\u20133.5, Ulaanbaatar is considered separately from the Central Region. \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \n16.  Table A4.4 shows a macroeconomic framework for education financing up to 2008, \nusing the information supplied by the MECS Education Finance study team. Assuming that the \nProject starts in 2006, project costs (including maintenance costs) for the Government for the \nfirst 3 years will be between 0.1% and 0.2% of public expenditure on education. Although public \nexpenditure on education, as a share of both GDP and total public expenditure, is expected to \ndecline from 2006 onwards, such project costs are insignificant and strongly suggest that project \nactivities supported by the Government are sustainable. However, there is need for caution in \nrespect of the proportion of government project costs allocated to maintenance, which needs to \nbe increased to finance preventive maintenance expenditures. \n \nTable A4.4: GDP, Total Public Expenditure, Education Expenditure, and  \nGovernment Share in the Project up to 2008 \nItem  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nGDP ($ million)  945.4  1,016.4  1,117.5  1,274.4  1,525.5  1,615.6  1,765.1  1,898.4  2,088.5 \nTPE ($ million)  398.7  446.2  494.1  537.1  602.3  634.9  678.0  686.2  704.8 \nPEE ($ million)  72.1  86.9  89.4  97.1  115.0  120.0  142.5  126.7  122.8 \nPEE as % of GDP  7.6  8.6  8.0  7.6  7.5  7.4  8.1  6.7  5.9 \nPEE as % of TPE  18.1  19.5  18.1  18.1  19.1  18.9  21.0  18.5  17.4 \nGovernment share in the \n            0.7  1.2  1.2 \nProject ($ million) \nGovernment share in the \n            0.1  0.2  0.2 \nProject as % of PEE \nGDP = gross domestic product, PEE = public expenditure on education, TPE = total public expenditure.  \nSources: World Bank, Ministry of Finance and Economy, Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, and Project \ncosting.\n ", "  Appendix 5  35 \nSCHOOL FACILITIES  \n \n1.  Situational Analysis of School Physical Facilities. In 2005, Mongolia had a total of \n710  public  primary  and  secondary  schools,  with  facilities  provision  in  the  order  of \n896 school  buildings  and  144  dormitories  distributed  throughout  the  6  khoros \n(municipalities) of Ulaanbaatar, 21 aimags (provinces), and 329 soums (districts). Many \nschool facilities were constructed in the 1970s or 1980s and have seriously deteriorated due to \nsevere weather conditions, continuous use, and inadequate maintenance. About 499 or 56% of \nthe school buildings are considered by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (MECS) \nto be in a very poor condition. Some 12% of secondary schools have not received any form of \nassistance for facilities improvement or replacement.  \n \n2.  The  896  public  school  buildings  were  designed  to  accommodate  a  total  of  around \n325,000  students.  During  the  2004\u201305  school  year,  the  total  enrollment  in  primary  and \nsecondary schools was 557,346 students\u2014about 65% more than the planned capacity. Due to \nthe increase in enrollments and lack of additional school space, about 43% of all secondary \nschools in the country were conducting classes on two or three shifts. The shift to the 12-year \nschooling  system,  as  planned,  will  exert  increased  pressure  on  the  capacity  of  facilities. \nMigration to cities has created overcrowding in urban schools and underutilization of rural \nschool facilities. Some schools in Ulaanbaatar are operating at an average of 260% of their \ncapacity with over 50 students in some classes. This has led to overuse of facilities and will \nresult in the speedy deterioration of school facilities, if not maintained properly. In rural areas, \nmigration has generated an underutilization problem of schools, with some operating at only one \nthird of their capacity. \n \n3.  Inadequate budget allocation for preventive maintenance has resulted in considerable \ndeterioration of school buildings and facilities over the last 15 years. Rehabilitation of school \nfacilities has depended largely on donor support. The finance allocated for maintenance of \nschool  facilities  has  been  inadequate.  Maintenance  is  only  2.4%,  as  a  proportion  of  the \nrecurrent expenditure in the education sector. From 2000 to 2003, the Government\u2019s provision \nfor maintenance and repair of buildings was only MNT17,592 million ($14.84 million) compared \nwith MNT34,335 million ($28.97 million) from aid agencies.  \n \n4.  Sustaining the physical condition of rehabilitated school facilities needs to be addressed. \nFinancial data obtained from 44 sample schools rehabilitated under the Second Education \nDevelopment Project (SEDP) showed actual expenditures on repairs and maintenance to be \nonly MNT2,735,352 ($2,308) per school in 2002 (prior to rehabilitation) and MNT2,194,230 \n($1,852) in 2004 (after rehabilitation). Based on selected reviews of sample schools, the budget \nfor repairs and maintenance should be at least $3,766 to $4,000 per year per building or $673 \nper student. \n \n5.  The inflexibility of the government budgeting system\u2014where savings from any of the \nschool budget expenditure items are reverted back to the national consolidated revenue\u2014\nleaves no flexibility for schools to utilize savings from other budget allocations for urgently \nneeded school repairs and maintenance. However, from 2006, schools with genuine savings will \nbe allowed to retain the level of their budget allocation for the following year similar to the \nprevious year without penalty. A number of schools have been piloted with this reform from \n1 July 2005. \n \n6.  Inefficient Teaching and Learning Environment due to Poor Physical Facilities. \nMECS has identified about 200 schools that no longer provide the basic requirements of an \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \nappropriate teaching and learning environment and that need urgent repairs. The buildings are \nover 20 years old, with old and inefficient building construction and heating technology, and \nunacceptable sanitation. In particular, the outdated heating technology generates high utility \ncosts. Heating remains a major issue, with 10% of schools still using ordinary stoves for heating \nclassroom buildings. As a result, classroom and dormitory temperatures often drop to below \nzero with temperatures plummeting to minus 30 degrees centigrade during extremely harsh \nwinters. The heating system of the majority of school buildings is usually linked with other public \nbuildings to a heating distribution system without proper metering and control of consumption. \nLeaking roofs, water infiltration to the building structures, damaged and leaking windows and \ndoors  with  poor  insulation,  defective  wooden  floors,  malfunctioning  sanitary  and  plumbing \nfacilities, and leaking water supply lines were major defects common to all the school buildings \nand would need to be repaired/rehabilitated soon to avoid further deterioration. The motivation \nof even dedicated teachers under poor working conditions\u2014in particular in rural schools\u2014\nwanes in the long run. Students and teachers tend to transfer to schools where the educational \nfacilities and learning environment are better. Enrollment data from schools rehabilitated under \nSEDP showed increased enrollments after school rehabilitation. \n \n7.  Declining  enrollment  and  attendance  rates  as  well  as  poor  quality  of  education\u2014\nparticularly in rural areas\u2014can be attributed in part to the poor condition of school infrastructure \nand facilities, dilapidated furniture, lack of equipment, and failing heating systems. During harsh \nwinter  conditions,  students  and  teachers  are  forced  to  remain  home,  especially  when \nclassrooms become extremely cold due to poor heating systems. Some schools have to close \noccasionally due to this condition. Poor families cannot afford to buy the minimum clothing and \nshoes for their children during winter. Therefore, the poorest pupils are not able to attend \nclasses because classrooms can be extremely cold and children cannot withstand freezing \ntemperatures during the coldest periods in winter. The condition of educational facilities has the \ngreatest negative impact on access for disabled and vulnerable students. Old school facilities do \nnot have the necessary provisions and services to meet the needs of these special groups. \n \n8.  MECS has been advocating student-centered approaches to teaching in instructional \nprograms  to  improve  the  traditional  \"chalk  and  blackboard\"  method.  But  efforts  towards \nachieving this goal have been hampered, in part, by the lack of appropriate equipment needed \nto prepare and produce learning materials to make the student-centered learning process more \ninteresting and effective during class sessions.  \n  \n9.  Outdated  Science  Laboratory  Equipment.  Of  6,355  secondary  schools,  some \n347 schools do not have the basic equipment for science laboratories. The equipment was \nsupplied during the Soviet era, is obsolete, and is no longer used for conducting experiments. \nFlasks, chemicals, and instruments used for conducting experiments in chemistry and physics \nare no longer suitable. Without basic laboratory equipment, it will not be possible to conduct \nexperiments for science subjects, as required by the new curriculum framework.  \n  \n10.  Shortage of Classroom Computer Equipment for IT-assisted Learning. The general \nlack of up-to-date classroom computer equipment deprives many students from learning basic \ncomputer operations and software applications vital to IT-assisted learning and for conducting \nbasic research work through the internet. Beginning in the 2005\u20132006 school year, informatics \nwill be taught with mathematics from grades 6\u201310. Learning the practical aspects of informatics \nwill require the use of computers, which should be made available in the schools. In the majority \nof schools, however, computer equipment is obsolete, not functioning, or not available at all.  \n ", "  Appendix 6  37 \nSELECTION CRITERIA FOR SCHOOLS TO BE REHABILITATED \n \n1.  As agreed with the Government, candidate schools to be selected for rehabilitation \nunder the proposed project will meet the following criteria.  \n \n(i)  Schools have been identified as priority schools by both Ministry of Education, \nCulture and Science (MECS) and the relevant provincial administration and are \nnot  included  in  any  future  assistance  program  on  facilities  expansion  or \nrehabilitation from any other agency. \n \n(ii)  Schools have a minimum of 30% of enrolled students from poor families33 at the \ntime of selection. \n \n(iii)  Schools have sufficient qualified teachers.  \n \n(iv)  School management and MECS provide evidence that adequate budget will be \nmade available for preventive maintenance after rehabilitation. \n \n(v)  Parents from the community and teachers are willing to be actively involved in \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  and  in  supervising  and  monitoring  school \nrehabilitation works. \n \n2.  All sites and facilities will be selected subject to Asian Development Bank concurrence. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n33  Poverty in Mongolia is defined using the minimum living standards approach. Currently, the poverty line is \nMNT19,500\u201325,000 ($17\u201321) per capita per month, depending on the region (ADB. 2004. Outlook 2004. Manila). \n ", "38  Appendix 7 \nVOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION \n \n1.  The sole public provider of vocational and technical education (VTE) for youth is the \nMinistry of  Education, Culture and Science (MECS). Vocational and technical training and \nretraining for adults is offered by institutions under the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare \n(MLSW), other line ministries, and the private sector. Overall, the VTE system is supply-driven, \nfragmented,  and  poorly  coordinated.  Industry  involvement  is  weak,  hence  the  majority  of \nprograms are not relevant and do not respond to the needs of industry. \n \nA.  Formal VTE System under MECS \n \n2.  The provision of VTE for youth is the responsibility of MECS. The VTE system caters to \nyouths who have at least completed grade 8 or are about 15 years of age. Most students \nenrolled in VTE institutions are from lower-middle income families or families below the poverty \nline. MECS administers a total of 42 VTE institutions. There are 22 vocational education and \ntraining centers (VETCs)/vocational training and production centers (VTPCs), which offer a 2.5-\nyear school-based vocational education that combines professional and general education, \nleading  to  a  professional  and  secondary  education  certificate.  School-based  vocational \neducation  started  in  1965  on  a  50:50  theory-practice  ratio  that  includes  30\u201335%  general \neducation, 5\u201320% basic vocational theory, and 50\u201355% practice, which is not carried out at \npresent because of lack of appropriate training equipment. Curriculum model standards are \nprepared by MECS, subject to approval by the Mongolian Agency for Standardization and \nMetrology.  However,  the  vast  majority  of  graduates  from  the  combined  general-vocational \neducation  system  cannot  compete  with  the  academic  performance  of  graduates  from  the \ngeneral secondary education stream and do not find jobs in industry due to lack of employable \nskills. In addition, the social status of vocational education is very low, as the majority of \nstudents are weak performers in the basic education grades and come from poor families.  \n \n3.  MECS also administers 14 branch schools (or schools attached to higher education \ninstitutions) and 6 technical colleges, which provide technical education for higher-level skills \ndevelopment, leading to a professional diploma or bachelors degree. Technical education is a 2-\nyear advanced training after completion of grade 10. This system started in 1996 by shifting \nfrom the 1-year specialized vocational education program to the 2-year advanced training, \nleading to a professional diploma. The diploma program can be linked with higher education \nafter 2 years, leading to a bachelors degree. The aim of vocational education is to provide basic \noccupational  skills  and  knowledge  in  a  chosen  vocation  while  the  objective  of  technical \neducation is to develop higher-level skills in a range of occupations and jobs in a given industrial \nsector. \n \n4.  The number of VTE institutions has increased from 36 in 2001 to 42 in 2005. VTE \nstudents as a proportion of all students in grades 1\u201310 declined from 11% in 1987 to 4% in \n2004. However, enrollment in VTE institutions increased from 12,177 in 2000 to 21,911 in 2004, \nof which 49.5% were female. About 144 vocational and technical courses are offered by VTE \ninstitutions. A total of 117 courses deal with basic training or professional certificate courses in \noccupations such as cooking and bakery, food production, caf\u00e9 and restaurant services, sewing, \nbeauty  culture,  carpentry  and  wood  processing,  secretarial,  farming,  painting,  consumer \nelectronics, shoe repair, photo studio operator, and hotel and restaurant services. Most of the \ncourses were designed without any labor market survey or active participation by industry. \n \n5.  Some  27  courses  are  offered  as  areas  of  specialization in  the  technical  education \nprogram\u2014related to auto mechanics, computer technicians, heavy equipment operation and \n ", "  Appendix 7  39 \nrepair,  food  production,  advertisement,  mining,  sewing,  electrical  technicians,  construction, \npublic nutrition, archive documentation, music, dance, and singing. The diploma courses with \nhigh  social  demand  are  sewing  technique,  computer/electronics,  computer  operator,  auto \nmechanics,  secretarial,  and  driving.  In  general,  courses  do  not  mirror  new  and  emerging \ntechnologies for developing highly skilled workers and technicians to meet the manpower needs \nof a gradually diversifying economy. The course titles do not provide clear distinction on the \nlevels of technology. \n \n6.  There were 8,338 VTE graduates in 2004, of which almost 53% was female. No reliable \ntracer  information  is  available  to  assess  whether  graduates  found  employment.  However, \nconsultations with industry representatives revealed that only a very small number of graduates \nfound  direct  employment  due  to  lack  of  relevant  knowledge  and  skills.  Many  graduates \nparticipate in short-term courses offered through MLSW to increase their employment and \nincome-earning opportunities.  \n \n7.  Although vocational education is a development priority of the Government, the current \nbudget allocation for VTE is inadequate to ensure efficient and effective delivery of programs. \nFor 2004, the budget allocation for formal VTE was about 4% of the education budget. There \nwas only incremental budget increase for the last 15 years, which is way below the international \naverage level of expenditure. There was no allocation for capital expenditure since 2004.  \n \nB.  Nonformal Vocational Training under MLSW \n \n8.  MLSW is the main provider of vocational training in the form of short-term courses to \ntrain and retrain adults. There are no strict entry qualifications for taking up training courses. \nParticipants include unemployed adults, secondary school leavers, soldiers, and adults who \nneed  retraining  or  skills  upgrading.  Short-term  training  is  carried  out  by  private  and \nnongovernment training providers. About 358 vocational training centers (VTCs) were registered \nwith MLSW to cater to adult training. Courses are mostly designed to cater to the service sector, \nsuch  as  training  of  hairdressers,  cooks,  accounting  assistants,  cosmetologists,  waitresses, \nreceptionists,  salesgirls,  sewers,  textile  workers,  electricians,  computer  operators,  welders, \ncarpenters, bricklayers, and interior and exterior decorators. The training duration ranges from \n1 to 3 months. \n \n9.  The total number of unemployed persons who benefited from training at VTCs reached \n20,000 for various occupations. This represents a small portion of the 150,000 persons who \nregistered for training in 2004. However, courses offered are highly redundant and produce an \noversupply of trained persons, particularly in the service sector.  \n \nC.   Condition of Training Facilities \n \n10.  One  serious  issue  in  VTE  is  the  need  to  rehabilitate  and  modernize  facilities  and \nequipment. Due to years of inadequate maintenance and investment, school buildings have \nseriously deteriorated (including heating, electricity, and water and sanitation systems). Old and \ninefficient building construction and heating technology generate high utility costs. The lack of \nappropriate equipment, adequate teaching aids, and learning materials constrains applying \nmodern teaching methodologies. The quality of hands-on skills training is seriously hampered \nby outdated training equipment, and lack of consumables and tools.  \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \nD.  Quality of Teaching and Delivery \n \n11.  There were 1,160 teachers and trainers employed in the 42 VTE institutions in 2004, of \nwhich about 63% are female. The teacher-student ratio was 1:19, which is considered an ideal \nsize. About one third of teachers in service are general education teachers. Most of the teachers \nhave  bachelors  degree  and  about  1\u20135  years\u2019  experience,  which  is  indicatively  short.  The \npedagogical and technical skills and knowledge of many teachers are outdated and need to be \nupgraded. There is a lack of pre-service and in-service teacher education programs for technical \nVTE  teachers.  The  delivery  of  training  is  conventional  and  classroom-based,  with  little \nopportunity to develop practical skills due to lack of up-to-date equipment and training supplies. \nThere is an acute shortage of learning resources. Most of the textbooks and resource materials \nare seriously outdated, with no systematic library management system in place. There are no \nmultimedia facilities or even classroom computers available to apply modern teaching and \nlearning methods. \n \n12.  Currently, there is no comprehensive recognized national system for skills standards in \nplace. The quality of skills training depends on the quality of instruction, which is often adversely \naffected by the lack of training materials and equipment, and poor teaching environment and \noutdated knowledge of teachers. VTE institutions set their own examination, without formal \nexternal quality control or moderation. The industry is only involved occasionally. \n \nE.  Market  Orientation  and  Cooperation  to  Strengthen  Relevance  and  Demand \nOrientation \n \n13.  MECS\u2019 VTE system is suffering from weak interaction with industry, poor coordination \nwith MLSW and other training providers, and lack of an elaborate labor market assessment \nstrategy to design programs of economic and social relevance. VTE is largely supply-driven and \nnot significantly refocused to reflect the emerging needs of the labor market. The current labor \nmarket information system is unable to provide up-to-date labor market data to guide the design \nand revision of training programs. The lack of information and resource sharing among MECS, \nindustry, and other training providers lowers the quality and relevance of training programs. \nMECS needs to improve strategies to explore ways to involve industry participation.  \n \n14.  A  review  of  courses  offered  under  MECS  and  MLSW  will  be  necessary  to  clearly \ndelineate  and  calibrate  the  type  and  level  of  courses  offered  by  each  ministry  to  avoid \nduplication of resources and redundancy of programs. Moreover, there is a need to cluster \ncourses  into  major  occupational  groups  to  warrant  international  classification  of  training, \nfacilitate  standard  setting  and  international  benchmarking,  and  for  economy  of  scale  in \nequipment provision and maintenance.  \n \n15.  The present curricula have not been seriously updated in the past and need major \nredesigning to conform to the new national curriculum framework. There are only 16 training \nstandards, which were developed from 1998 to date for sewers and tailors of soft items; food \nproduction, cooks and bakers; electric and gas welders; carpenters; plumbers and welders; \nmechanics  and  drivers;  shoemakers;  farmers;  hairdressers  and  beauticians;  construction \nmasonry workers; general vocation in mining, repair and maintenance of mining equipment and  \ndrivers  of  heavy  load  machinery.  These  training  standards  appear  too  basic  and  almost \nduplicate the short-term courses at VTCs. There is a need to recalibrate these standards and \nintroduce new ones for multiskilled development rather than simple operation work. Some \nconstraints are the lack of an elaborate labor market survey and tracer studies, as well as the \ncapacity and resources to undertake curriculum revision. \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  41 \nF.   Reform Needs \n \n16.  There is a need to develop a comprehensive national policy linked to a national human \nresource development plan and the present and future labor market. The current VTE system \nunder MECS needs to be reformed, particularly addressing challenges related to (i) adjusting \nVTE programs to the reformed national curriculum framework and the extended grade 1\u201312 \nschool  structure  (including  amending  student  entry  levels  and  qualification  requirements); \n(ii) addressing challenges related to the revision of the current 2.5-year combined professional \nand general education program; (iii) developing new profiles for VETCs/VTPCs, focusing on the \nprovision  of  relevant  demand-driven  vocational  education  programs  for  skilled  labor;  (iv) \ndeveloping a demand-driven curriculum in close cooperation with industry, based on market \nsurveys and internationally accepted standards; (v) assessing training needs for vocational \nteachers and developing an in-service teacher training system; and (vi) reviewing diploma and \nbachelors programs to improve demand orientation.34 \n \n17.  A reformed VTE system needs to be in line with policies, regulations, and standards of \nall training providers to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire system. A \nnational  policy  framework  needs  to  (i)  streamline  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional \narrangements  for  the  subsector;  (ii)  define  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  all  major \nstakeholders; (iii) agree on national skills standards; and (iv) prepare for a National Vocational \nQualification (NVQ) system based on standards of competence set by industry.  \n \n18.  Public-private partnership needs to be improved substantially. The private sector could \nplay a greater role in developing, promoting, and owning VTE. Public-private partnership in VTE \ncould build on the encouraging lessons learned from the Skills Training Voucher Program with \nsupport from the Employment Promotion Fund. However, incentives are necessary to enhance \nprivate sector participation in VTE provision.  \n \n19.  The recurrent budget of a VTE school is based on enrollment. The variable cost of \ntraining has been calculated as one of the major parameters in allocating the budget. The \npresent  system  of  public  budgeting  has  no  provision  for  recognizing  performance  as  an \nincentive for excellence. This is important to foster the quality of, and competition in, VTE \nprovision. Another major drawback of the VTE system is the lack of financial autonomy. There is \na need to initiate fiscal policy reform to improve the present financing mechanisms. \n \n20.  The quality assurance system in VTE is weak. The accreditation system for higher \neducation  institutions  and  vocational  and  technical  training  centers  was  embodied  in  the \nEducation Law, 1995, as amended. The Mongolian National Council for Education Accreditation \nwas established in 1998 as the national accrediting body. To date, only two vocational training \ncenters have been accredited out of 42 VTE institutions. An accreditation system should be \ndeveloped  with  industry  participation  and  closely  coordinated  with  the  Mongolian  National \nCouncil  for  Education  Accreditation  to  enhance  the  present  accreditation  system.  A  NVQ \nframework does not exist in Mongolia. \n \n \n                                                 \n34  Japan International Cooperation Agency has indicated that it will consider providing technical assistance to support \nMECS in the areas of curriculum development and teacher training. \n ", " \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($) \nTable A8.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category\n4\n2\nItem  Component  Component  Component  Project  Total  Physical   \n1a  2b  3c   Management  Contingencies \n            %  Amount  A\np\nI.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support the Ministry of Education, Culture and \nScience (MECS) in providing associated technical assistance (TA) for the development of a \nsector wide approach (SWAp) in the education sector in Mongolia. The TA will strengthen \nMECS\u2019  technical  and  management  capacity  in  strategic  planning  and  policy  analysis,  and \nenable the ministry to set up a SWAp in the education sector. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated at $210,000 equivalent, of which $55,000 is the foreign exchange cost and $155,000 \nequivalent the local currency cost. The Government has requested ADB to finance $150,000, \ncovering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  ($55,000)  and  $95,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost through the \nprovision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  and  furniture  for  TA  administration;  workshop \nfacilities; and government officials\u2019 transport and allowances. The TA will be implemented over a \nperiod of 24 months, starting March 2006.  \n \n2.  Currently, the level of harmonization of donor activities in the education sector is very \nlow. Donor funded projects are not linked to an overall policy framework and are managed \nlargely  on  an  individual  basis,  which  leads to  increased  transaction  costs  for  MECS.  The \npriorities  of  MECS  are  not  transparent  to  regional  administrations,  educational  institutions, \ndonors, nongovernment organizations, and other stakeholders in the community that have an \ninterest in education. The lack of clear policy directions and low coordination level results in \nineffective and inefficient use of scarce resources in the education sector, whether provided \ndomestically or by donors. \n \n3.  A comprehensive policy framework that provides clear directions for budget planning \nand donor interventions is a key precondition for the establishment of a SWAp that will align \ndevelopment assistance with country priorities. The new Education Master Plan 2006\u20132015, \nprepared with the assistance of ADB, will provide the necessary policy structure, leading to \ngreater coherence and improved effectiveness and efficiency in the sector. However, policy \nobjectives established under the Education Master Plan will need to be prioritized and translated \ninto operational implementation strategies, annual budget plans will need to be linked to the \nMaster  Plan,  and  a  management  information  system  needs  to  be  set  up  to  monitor  the \nachievement of policy objectives.  \n \n4.  At present, MECS lacks capacity in strategic planning, policy analysis, research, and \nimpact oriented monitoring. There is no effective planning structure in place because (i) limited \nqualified staff is available, and (ii) data collected are not subjected to systematic analyses and \nfinancial cost indicators are not linked to institutional data. The current education management \ninformation system (EMIS) in MECS is poorly maintained and there are inefficiencies in the data \ncollection process. Statistical data is regularly collected from all levels but it appears that it is not \ndirectly used for planning and decision making. Conclusions drawn from the data are not \nconsistent across levels of education administration. Annual reports simply present the data in \ntabular form with no analysis or interpretation of their implications for the education sector. \nConsequently, policy analytical and evaluative research is generally not used to inform planning \nor budgeting. Given this situation, the development of an effective EMIS, which lends itself to \npolicy analysis and is accompanied by human capacity building, is sorely needed. An improved \nEMIS will also contribute to improve donor coordination. \n \n5.   Based on the new Education Master Plan, the TA will support MECS in developing \nannual  implementation  plans,  identifying  investment  priorities,  and  preparing  adequate \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nmonitoring strategies to review whether policy objectives are being achieved and advise if there \nis a need for policy adjustments. The TA will assist with the preparation of annual and longer-\nterm  budget  frameworks  linked  to  the  Education  Master  Plan,  including  financial  plans  by \nregional and institutional authorities, and the development of an improved donor coordination \nmechanism. The TA will help set up and train a team within MECS that will regularly conduct \nand/or  facilitate  education  research  and  policy  analysis\u2014in  cooperation  with  universities, \nresearch  institutions,  and  aid  agencies/funding  agencies\u2014to  (i)  support  informed  decision \nmaking, (ii) initiate up-to-date discussions on strategic issues leading to greater participation in \nsetting directions for education development, (iii) increase transparency, and (iv) complement \nMECS\u2019 monitoring and evaluation activities. \n \n6.  The TA will assist MECS in reducing the fragmentation of development cooperation \nefforts and shifting from a project to program approach, and support MECS in developing \nstrategies  to  align  planning,  implementation,  disbursement,  reporting,  and  accounting \narrangements  with  government  procedures.  This  will  reduce  transaction  costs  and  MECS\u2019 \nadministrative burden, and increase efficiency and effectiveness in the sector. Joint monitoring \nmechanisms will focus on the impact of interventions on the improvement of the quality of the \nentire education system rather than on single projects.  \n \n7.  TA Staffing and Indicative Terms of Reference. The TA will build capacity in MECS \nthrough the provision of international and domestic consultants in the areas of strategic and \nfinancial planning, policy analysis, and donor coordination. The TA will also strengthen the \ncurrent EMIS. A total of 3 person-months of international and 48 person-months of national \nconsulting services will be contracted under the TA. This will include experts in the fields of \n(i) education  planning,  policy  analysis,  and  research;  (ii)  financial  planning  and  budgeting; \n(iii) monitoring and EMIS; and (iv) donor coordination. Consultants will be recruited individually \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. In addition, the TA will provide office equipment for up to $10,000, which \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.  \n \n8.  The international advisor (3 person-months) will assist MECS in (i) developing annual \nstrategic plans based on the Education Master Plan, using appropriate data analytic approaches \nfor informing an annual strategic planning cycle; (ii) identifying key performance indicators for \nmonitoring  the  strategic  planning  cycle;  (iii)  designing  a  monitoring  mechanism  to  provide \nqualitative  information  on  achievement  of  policy  objectives;  (iv)  analyzing  policies,  laws, \nregulations, and degrees related to the new Education Master Plan; and (v) and provide advise \non  capacity  building  strategies,  including  training  for  selected  staff  to  strengthen  policy \ndevelopment and analysis. The international advisor will closely work with the head of the \nEducation Department and other key stakeholders and donors.  \n \n9.  Under  the  guidance  of  the  international  advisor,  domestic  consultants  (22  person\u2013\nmonths) will assist MECS in (i) policy analysis; (ii) developing implementation strategies for \neach subsector, based on the Education Master Plan; (iii) reviewing financial management and \ndeveloping strategies for improvement; (iv) preparing budget plans, (v) establishing a system to \nmonitor the implementation of the Education Master Plan; and (vi) conducting training on policy \nanalysis, and employing decision-oriented research and reporting.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: \n \nAccording to Mongolia\u2019s Economic Growth Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGSPRS), \u201cone of the \nkey priorities of the Government is improvement of the quality and access to basic education and health \nservices, to support employment and income-generating activities, thereby improving the social safety net \nand supporting sustainable human development. In implementing these activities, the Government will \nensure that the poor and vulnerable groups of society have equal access to basic social services, thus \nsupporting their opportunities for employment and participation in economic activities. It means that having a \nperson reach satisfactory levels in terms of education, food availability and health is the prerequisite to \nprevention of, and escaping from, poverty and vulnerability, especially inter-generational poverty.\u201d \n \nThe Project is closely related to national priorities defined in the EGSPRS. The Project will upgrade the \nquality of education at all levels by (i) modernizing the curriculum so that it is more relevant to the needs of \nsociety and the economy, (ii) reforming the vocational and technical education (VTE) system to become \nrelevant  and  demand-driven,  (iii)  improving  the  teaching  and  learning  environment  through  school \nrehabilitation and upgrading of facilities, and (d) improving the system of professional development for \nteachers. The Project will contribute towards ensuring that educational services are accessible in all areas \n(particularly rural areas) and for vulnerable groups, and that school dropout is further reduced, by (i) \nrehabilitating rural schools and those serving children living in peri-urban areas, and (b) improving dormitory \naccommodation in selected areas to give better opportunities for children from herder families and rural \nhouseholds to remain in school. The Project will also contribute towards strengthening management capacity \nat central and aimag (province) level by improving capacity in policy planning and analysis through the \nassociated technical assistance (TA).  \n \nSupported by the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP)1 and the Second Education Development \nProject  (SEDP),2  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture  and  Science  (MECS)  has  contributed  to  reduce \ndeprivation poverty by increasing access to education in areas with the lowest enrolment rates (including \nrural areas and principal urban areas), and reducing income and deprivation poverty by improving access to \nquality preschool and basic education in poorer rural and urban areas. In addition, the Social Security Sector \nDevelopment Project (SSSDP),3 supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), has a component \ndedicated to skills training and entrepreneurship development for the adult unemployed and poor. \n \nThe Project will build upon the successes of ESDP and SEDP, as well as SSSDP, to reduce poverty by \nincreasing access to better quality education services at primary and secondary levels, particularly in rural \nand peri-urban areas, and by improving opportunities for demand-driven, vocational education. In general, \nhigher  educational  attainment  produces  greater  income-earning  potential  in  Mongolia,  since  both  the \naccessibility of education and the quality of the learning experience in school are important factors in \ndetermining school enrolment and completion. The Project will contribute substantially to (i) improving \naccess to schooling for children from both rural and urban poor families (through expanding dormitory \nplaces), (ii) creating a healthy and stimulating environment (through improved water supply and sanitation, \nimproved facilities, more relevant curriculum, and better qualified and motivated teachers), and (iii) catering \nfor the physically disabled) learning and teaching environment.

Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nOverall, 36% of the total population lived in poverty. In 2002, poverty incidence was higher in rural areas \n(43%) than in urban areas (30%); lowest in Ulaanbaatar (about 27%), where half of the population resides; \nand  highest  (51%)  in  the  Western  Region.  The  recent  World  Bank  analysis  of  the  Living  Standards \nMeasurement Survey 1998 & 2002 finds that the negative impact of poverty on a child\u2019s dropout from school \nis significant at every level of schooling\u2014even at primary level where completion rates are near universal\u2014\nand it has the largest effect on upper secondary dropout. Poverty affects children\u2019s educational outcomes \ndirectly (out-of-pocket and opportunity costs) and indirectly (family/parental background). Educational quality, \nas measured by examination results, is significantly lower in rural areas, and poorer soums (districts) perform \nworse than richer soums; and the quality of teaching influences parental decisions on whether to keep their \nchildren in school or not. The Government\u2019s flagship social assistance program, the Child Money Programme \n(CMP), has started providing MNT3,000 per child per month to poor households, provided that the child is \nand continues to be enrolled in school (from 1 July 2005).4  Early findings of the ADB-funded Participatory \nPoverty Assessment and Monitoring Project indicate that the MNT3,000 per child is considered to an \nimportant source of income for very poor families, although the informal charges levied by many schools are \ntoo high for the poor, even with CMP support. However, it has been estimated that 49%5 of recipients in the \nCMP are from nonpoor families and 17% of eligible poor families are excluded.   \n \nThere has been increased migration from rural areas to peri-urban areas, mainly in search of better \neducation, health, and other services; and income-earning opportunities. This inflow of population has \ncaused overcrowding and high absenteeism in urban schools (nearly 7% of 8 year olds do not attend \nschool).  High  migration  rates  can  be  associated  with  poor  student  performance  in  schools,  fees  for \npreschools and boarding facilities are prohibitive for aimag and soum households, the indirect cost of \nschooling in relation to household per capita expenditure increases significantly for grades 9 and 10, and \npoorer families are underrepresented in upper secondary education in both rural and urban areas. In effect, \npoverty is an important factor in determining whether a child is enrolled in school or not. Yet, without \nunhampered access to quality education, opportunities for earning a reasonable income and rising above the \npoverty line are restricted; indeed, graduates of at least secondary education are significantly less likely to be \npoor. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nThe  main  institutional stakeholders  include  MECS,  aimag  authorities  (including  Education  and Culture \nDepartments),  higher  education  institutions  (especially  those  with  an  education  department),  VTE \ninstitutions, primary and secondary schools, and kindergartens. The primary stakeholders are teachers and \nstudents. Through the Project, the structure and process of the professional development of teachers will be \nmodernized and strengthened. The principal focus of the Project will be students in primary and secondary \nschools and VTE institutions. A number of international finance and technical assistance agencies and \nnongovernment organizations are also stakeholders in the education sector. A sector wide approach (SWAp) \nin education is currently being initiated by MECS, with Japan and ADB at the forefront. Other stakeholders \ninclude construction companies carrying out school rehabilitation of schools, and community groups who will \nsupervise the rehabilitation process.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe  Project was  designed  in  a  participatory  process  involving  major  government  and  nongovernment \nstakeholders  at  national  and  aimag  level,  school  directors  and  teachers,  community  leaders,  and \ndevelopment  partners  through  regular  consultations,  series  of  workshops,  and  presentations.  During \nimplementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation in its activities and will benefit from \n                                                 \n4 Previously, it was provided to poor families with three or more children. \n5 World Bank estimates. \n ", "64  Appendix 13 \nthe establishment of a SWAp in the education sector. \n \nThe Project will encourage (i) nationwide consultation in the development of the new national curriculum \nframework;  (ii)  greater  community  participation  in  supervising  and  ensuring  the  quality  of  (a)  school \nconstruction work and equipment procurement, and (b) school facilities maintenance; and (iii) partnership \nbetween employers and VTE institutions in developing and delivering market-oriented training programs. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on gender: \nAccording to the ADB/World Bank Mongolia Country Gender Assessment (2005), girls enrolled in school \noutnumber boys in every aimag, including the capital. This pattern emerged in the immediate post-transition \nperiod and continues, although the gap has narrowed in recent years. Dropout rates for boys at secondary \nlevel are high among poor families in urban areas while, in rural areas, children drop out even at primary \nlevel. The reverse gender gap is particularly noticeable at higher levels of education. Women constituted \n80% of students who had completed secondary education in the United Nations Development Fund for \nWomen (UNIFEM)-EGSPRS survey sample.   \n \nTo address the reverse gender gap in the school enrollment, the Project attempts to (i) incorporate learning \nmaterials that reinforce the right of all boys and girls to attend school so they can reach their full potential; (ii) \nexamine the issue of gender stereotyping through analysis of curriculum content and identify strategies for \nimproving portrayal of gender in curriculum content; (iii) provide training for teachers in techniques for dealing \nwith presentation of gender roles and issues; (iv) give high priority to matching skills and educational \nachievements to employment opportunities through demand-driven vocational education; and (v) encourage \nparents to send their children back to school through the provision of improved school facilities, better \ncurriculum standard, and more qualified teachers. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
