The report  also  describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Enhancing Climate Resilience of Hydropower Plants,1 and \nif the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated to me  by  the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \nThe  proposed  project  will  support  Uzbekistan\u2019s  national  goals  to  increase  renewable \n2. \nenergy generation and diversify its energy mix. The project has multifaceted interventions to help \nUzbekistan (i) deploy small and mini hydropower plants (HPPs) to add 25 megawatts (MW) of \nrenewable energy capacity; (ii) develop a hydropower master plan to optimize a future investment \nprogram,  which  will  help  develop  planning  capacity  for  climate  resilience  and  environmental \nsustainability; and (iii) complement sector reforms by strengthening the institutional capacity of \nJoint-Stock Company Uzbekhydroenergo. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nBenefiting  from  high  commodity  prices,  Uzbekistan  enjoyed  high  economic  growth  that \n3. \naveraged at a rate of 8.4% over the past 10 years. However, the weakening external environment, \nextensive state control, weak governance, and low foreign investments have increasingly slowed \neconomic  growth,  necessitating  far-reaching  reforms,  including  continuing  the  institutional  and \nstructural reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The energy sector, which has underpinned \nUzbekistan\u2019s  sustained  growth  and  contributes  about  20%  to  gross  domestic  product,  faces \nchallenges in introducing market-oriented principles to catalyze private sector investment and in \ndiversifying  energy  resources  while  scaling  up  urgent  investments  in  critical  infrastructure  to \nsupport fast-growing power demand and ensure long-term sustainability. \n \n4. \nUzbekistan has served as an electricity trade hub in Central Asia, where an interconnected \nand  coordinated  power  system  established  during  the  Soviet  era  provided  countries  with  high \nenergy security and an optimal energy mix by unifying the region\u2019s unevenly distributed energy \nresources.  Under  this  system,  hydropower-rich  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  exchanged \nelectricity  with  fossil  fuel-generating  Kazakhstan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  However,  a \nbreakdown  in  this  regionally  coordinated  energy  system  pushed  Uzbekistan  to  rely  heavily  on \nfossil fuels in its generation mix. \n \n5. \nNatural gas is the dominant fossil energy source in the country\u2019s power generation mix, \ncontributing 80% of the 63 terawatt-hours of total electricity produced in 2018. Of the 11 gigawatts \n(GW) of thermal power plant capacity in Uzbekistan, more than 40% are 30\u201340-year-old plants \nwith  low  thermal  efficiency.  Most  thermal  power  plants  were  also  designed  for  baseload \ngeneration with no flexible load management measures, further reducing thermal efficiency and \npower  supply  reliability.  Moreover,  continued  reliance  on  meeting  power  demand  growth  by \nburning fossil fuels, the country\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will rise, as 85% of emissions \ncome from the energy sector. \n \n\n                                                \n1  Of which (i) $1,000,000 will be provided by the Climate Change Fund and (ii) $500,000 will be provided by the Clean \nEnergy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership  Facility and administered by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAs part of the complex reform measures undertaken by the government, focus has shifted \n6. \ntoward  the  use  of  renewable  energy  to  diversify  energy  sources.  Uzbekistan  has  abundant \nrenewable energy resources, and the most harnessed is hydropower, with installed capacity of \n1.9 GW or about 13% of total installed generating capacity. However, this is only about 20% of \nthe  country\u2019s  hydropower  potential  of  7.5  GW.2  The  exploitation  of  water  resources  prioritized \nagriculture (i.e., for irrigation purposes) as there were no strategies for integrated water\u2013energy \nresources management through  hydropower  development. Issues  such  as  low  electricity  tariff, \ngeological and hydrological risks, and socio-environmental footprints were additional constraints \nto the effective development of hydropower in Uzbekistan. \n \n7. \nIn  this  light,  the  government  adopted  a  $2.6  billion  investment  program  to  increase \nhydropower capacity by 1.6 GW by 2030.3 Uzbekhydroenergo was established in May 2017 to \nadminister  the  ambitious  program,  backed  by  preferential  tariff  for  hydropower  projects. \nUzbekhydroenergo  was  created  by  unbundling  the  HPPs  from  Uzbekenergo,  the  vertically \nintegrated state utility, and integrating them with HPPs under the Ministry of Agriculture and Water \nResources.  Hydropower  planning  and  water  resources  management  were  streamlined  into \nUzbekhydroenergo. \n \n8. \nThe  government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  to  align \nhydropower development with the overarching goals of the country\u2019s energy sector development \nand support SOE reform. As a newly established company and a new executing agency for ADB \nprojects, Uzbekhydroenergo needs to build management, planning, and technical capacity. ADB \nwill  help  improve  Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s  technical  capability  and  financial  management  skills. \nInitially,  Uzbekhydroenergo  will  focus  on  less  risky  small  hydropower  projects  and  HPP \nrehabilitation. Gradually, it will shift to the development of more complex large HPPs and cross-\nborder hydropower projects. \n \n9. \nUnder  the  project,  Uzbekhydroenergo  will  install  three  small  HPPs  with  24  megawatts \n(MW) total capacity on the Aksu River in Kashkadarya Province; and at least three mini HPPs \nwith 1 MW total capacity in rural areas. The government originally proposed 30 MW total capacity \nwith dams of 40 to 70 meters in height and storage reservoirs, but Uzbekhydroenergo agreed to \nmodify the project design to maintain water flow for the river eco-system and people\u2019s daily use \nin  consideration  of  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements,  international  standards  and  practices,  and, \nmore importantly, long-term socio-environmental sustainability. Such joint efforts have helped the \ngovernment  and  Uzbekhydroenergo  infuse  environmental  sustainability  in  the  country\u2019s \nhydropower planning landscape. \n \n10. \nLessons. ADB has applied lessons from its long-term sector operations in designing the \nproject.4 First, development partner coordination meetings and interagency coordination meetings \nhelp  streamline  government  regulatory  procedures  and  tackle  bureaucratic  hurdles  that  delay \nimplementation.  Second,  TA  is  needed  to  strengthen  the  executing  agency\u2019s  planning  and \nimplementation capacity and address operational bottlenecks. Third, ADB\u2019s continued support for \nsector and SOE reforms improves project efficiency and overall sector sustainability. In particular, \nADB  support for  cost recovery  tariff  reforms  will  help  improve  the  sector\u2019s financial  health  and \n                                                \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012.

The benefits of hydropower are especially salient for mini HPPs, \ngiven their smaller environmental and social footprint. The mini HPPs will ensure the efficient use \nof  water  resources,  such  as  spillover  water  from  dams  or  irrigation  channels,  and  will  provide \nreliable electricity in the country\u2019s remote villages. \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Climate  resilience  promoted  in  hydropower  planning.  The  project  will \nprepare a hydropower development master plan focused on climate resilience and environmental \nsustainability. Large deployment of hydropower is seen as an effective GHG mitigation strategy, \nbut given the water-stressed situation of Uzbekistan, larger attention needs to be paid to the water \nresource assessment with due consideration to the climate change impacts and environmental \nsustainability  assessments.  The  attached  TA  (para.  22)  will  directly  contribute  to  output  2  by \nundertaking  critical  analytical  work  to  reassess  and  optimize  Uzbekistan\u2019s  hydropower \ndevelopment  plan  from  climate  resilience  and  environmental  sustainability  perspectives.  The \nmasterplan will also provide potential private sector investment opportunities by conducting early-\nstage project studies and exploring public\u2013private partnerships for hydropower projects. \n \n16. \nOutput  3:  Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s  institutional  capacity  enhanced.  Output  3  will \nstrengthen  Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s  institutional  capacity  in  financial  management  and  improve  its \ncorporate  governance  to  leverage  reforms.  It  will  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of \nUzbekhydroenergo, a newly formed entity, and the transparency of financial information.  \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $75.3  million  (Table  2).

The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.7  million,  of  which  $1.0  million  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund10 and $0.5 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Clean Energy Fund11 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nand administered by ADB. Uzbekhydroenergo will provide counterpart support in the form of office \naccommodation, counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. ADB will oversee TA activities. \nThe TA will be implemented over 15 months, with an estimated start date of September 2019. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nThe project is in the Shakhrisabaz District of Kashkadarya Province in the middle course \nof the Aksu River, which is 12 km upstream of the Gissarak dam. The project site is a narrow \nvalley suitable for hydropower development, and all subprojects are run-of-the-river type with no \nwater  storage  capacity.  A  22  km,  35\u2013110-kilovolt  transmission  line  will  be  built  to  export  the \ngenerated  electricity  to  the  nearby  substation  at  the  Gissarak  HPP.  Seismic  risk  is  sufficiently \nmitigated by the application of adequate seismic codes in the project design. Site accessibility is \nfair  as  is,  but  the  access  road  will  be  partially  expanded  and  rehabilitated for the  community\u2019s \nimproved access. \n \n24. \nThe HPP outputs have been optimized to minimize environmental and social impacts. An \nenvironmental flow assessment helped establish technical design to deliver maximum generation \ncapacity and minimum impact on sediment, optimal water flows, and the measures to integrate \nenvironmental sustainability and established good practices for Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s hydropower \nplanning. The climate change assessment suggests moderate climate change risk. Many climate \nchange scenarios were examined, and the reinforcement of the intake weir and floodwall for the \npowerhouse are in the project design as adaptation measures. \n \n\n                                                \n10 Established by ADB. \n11 Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n25. \nAn economic analysis indicates an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 10.9%. Given \nthe  hurdle  rate  of  9.0%,  the  project  is  deemed  economically  viable.  This  considered  the  non-\nincremental benefits of fuel cost savings and avoided GHG emissions, otherwise the government \nwill  have  to  rely  on  thermal  power  plants  to  meet  power  demand.  Even  without  environmental \nbenefits, EIRR is 10.1%. The 2.7% financial internal rate of return compares favorably with the \n1.5% weighted average cost of capital. Financial viability is gauged by comparing the revenue \nand cost streams of with- and without-project scenarios, and sensitivity analysis confirmed that \nthe  project  remains  economically  and  financially  viable  against  adverse  events.  The  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  based  on  the  historical  trajectory  of  end-user  increases  from  2010  to \n2018. The government adopted a new tariff methodology in April 2019 that will implement gradual \nrealization  of  improved  cost  recovery  level  as  part  of  financial  recovery  action  plan.  But  to  be \nconservative, these tariff scenarios were not considered in the financial analysis, which is based \non  the  historical  tariff  level.12  In  case  of  inadequate  tariff,  the  government  assured  in  a  loan \ncovenant that it will provide debt servicing and operation coverage to Uzbekhydroenergo. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nSector governance. The government set up the Ministry of Energy on 1 February 2019 \nto  regulate  the  sector.  Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s  revenue  stream  depends  on  payments  from  the \ntransmission  company  as  the  country\u2019s  sole  buyer  of  electricity.  The  government  has  put \nsignificant effort on improving the governance and strengthening the financial sustainability of the \nsector. Early achievements include the implementation of time-bound financial recovery actions \nto improve the management capacity, financial resilience, and liquidity of state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs). Among the recovery measures, the government has prioritized revenue enhancement, \nincluding  the  adoption  of  the  new  cost  recovery  tariff  and  improvement  of  revenue  collection \nthrough nationwide advanced metering projects. These measures have been covenanted under \nother ADB-funded projects. \n \n27. \nFinancial  management.  Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s  financial  management  risk  is  high  and \nfinancial  management  capability  is  low.  As  a  newly  created  entity,  Uzbekhydroenergo\u2019s \naccounting  and  financial  reporting  policies  and  procedures  follow  the  national  accounting  and \nauditing  standards  of  its  predecessors.  Supported  by  external  consultants,  Uzbekhydroenergo \nintends  to  complete  its  first  audited  statements  that  follow  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandards (IFRS) for FY2017\u2013FY2018 by end of 2019. Uzbekhydroenergo needs to strengthen \nits institutional capacity and staff skills to consolidate its accounts under national accounting and \nauditing  standards  and  IFRS,  and  to  conduct  financial  planning  and  audit.  To  meet  IFRS \nrequirements, it has prioritized (i) the implementation of first-time asset revaluation; (ii) automation \nof the accounts consideration and management reporting process; and (iii) capacity enhancement \nmeasures,  including  recruiting  an  adequate  number  of  qualified  accounting  staff.  Integrity  due \ndiligence conducted on Uzbekhydroenergo found no significant integrity risks. \n \n28. \nProcurement. The procurement risk is moderate. Although the project is the first ADB-\nfunded  project  for  Uzbekhydroenergo,  it  has  sufficient  domestic  procurement  experience  and \nexperience in procuring goods and services under projects funded by bilateral donors. There are \nno  limitations  in  domestic  practices  and  procedures  that  restrict  the  application  of  the  ADB \n\n                                                \n12 Based  on  the  new  tariff  methodology,  ADB  proposed  a  3-year  tariff  increase  cycle  to  2028  to  ensure  tariffs  are \nincreased to full cost recovery. The government is reviewing the level of tariff increase. As of 15 August 2019, the \ngovernment increased residential tariff by 18% and other categories of customers by 36%.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The lack of ADB-funded project experience can \nbe mitigated by engaging international project supervision consultants to aid Uzbekhydroenergo \nthroughout  procurement  and  contract  execution.  ADB  will  also  provide  assistance,  including \nprocurement training. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Uzbekhydroenergo.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \nPoverty and social. The major benefit of the project is the increased reliability of power \n30. \nsupply  primarily  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project.  This  will  provide  stable  access  to grid-connected \nelectricity,  which  will  promote  business  expansion  and  create  job  opportunities  for  local \ncommunities, including poor and socially disadvantaged women. In the project site, only 24.2% \nof working-age women are employed compared with 65.5% of men. As high as 46.5% of women \nneither work nor look for jobs, compared with 2.6% of men. The project will therefore contribute \nto poverty reduction around the project site, including improving the condition of the access road. \nDuring  construction,  the  project  is  expected  to  generate  indicatively  400  jobs  for  skilled  and \nunskilled laborers, including the poor, vulnerable groups, and women. \n \n31. \nGender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Gender issues and \nopportunities for gender development were considered during project preparation based on the \ndue diligence on Uzbekhydroenergo and the project site. A gender action plan has been prepared \nto promote gender equality in Uzbekhydroenergo. Key features include (i) collecting, analyzing, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  sex-disaggregated  data  and  information;  and  conducting  general \ngender  awareness  training  for  Uzbekhydroenergo  employees  (at  least  50%  will  be  women), \nincluding  on  preventing  sexual  harassment,  exploitation,  and  abuse;  (ii)  recruiting  a  social \ndevelopment  and  gender  specialist  in  the  project  management  unit  (PMU);  (iii)  facilitating \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  project  activities;  and  (iv)  designing,  adopting,  and  implementing  a \ngender equality strategy and policy by and for Uzbekhydroenergo. \n \nE. \n \n32. \ncategories are as follows.13 \n \n33. \nEnvironment (category A). A draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was \nprepared  and  disclosed  in  May  2019.  Public  consultation  was  conducted  for  the  nearest \ncommunities  at  the  scoping  stage  and  twice  on  the  draft  EIA.  The  EIA,  which  adequately \naddressed  all  issues  raised  during  the  consultations,  identified  the  potential  impacts  that  the \nproject could generate and proposed an adequate environmental management plan (EMP) with \nmitigation measures, a monitoring plan, cost estimates, and EMP implementation arrangements. \nThe EMP will form part of the bidding documents. \n \n34. \nEnvironmental  impacts  that  could  occur  during  construction  and  operation  are  mainly \nwithin the sections of the Aksu River between the weir and the powerhouse that will experience \nreduced water flows, on the corridors of the transmission line and access roads, and on nearby \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fvillages. The main impact during operations would be on the aquatic ecology and river ecosystem \nmainly related to the presence of the weir, which is an impassable obstacle to all fish,  and the \nreduced flow, which will impact nearby villages and permanently impact the river ecosystem. As \npart of the EIA, an environmental-flow modeling was undertaken, and the study presents that the \nproject  design  maintains  the  acceptable  flow  to  ensure  the  river  is  not  significantly  impacted \n(paras. 23 \u2013 24). A carefully designed fish ladder will be included as a mitigation strategy. \n \n35. \nThe Aksu River is heavily modified by the large multipurpose dam and HPPs about 12 km \ndownstream from the project area, which essentially dammed the valley. Information on the river\u2019s \nbiodiversity value suggests few species of fish live in the river, and none are protected or red-\nlisted nationally or internationally. 14 No vulnerable species were observed during inventories of \nthe area. Reduced water flow is an important concern for the local population, particularly in areas \nwhere piped waterway will pass, as some use river water for various purposes, including drinking. \nThe water balance assessment further suggested that the river will maintain adequate water for \npeople\u2019s daily use, livestock, and irrigation. \n \nThe  PMU  will  implement  the  EMP  in  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n36. \n(2009)  and  national  environmental  regulations.  International  and  national  environmental \nconsultants will strengthen the PMU\u2019s safeguard staff capacity, while environmental specialists of \nthe  project  supervision  consultant  will  help  the  PMU  implement  the  EMP.  The  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  contract  will  include  a  budget  for  implementing  the  mitigation \nmeasures. The PMU budget will include environmental consultant support, capacity building, and \nindependent  monitoring  with  the  local  environmental  authority.  The  project  will  establish  a \ngrievance redress mechanism to handle environmental and social safeguard issues. \n \n37. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The project does not envisage the acquisition of \nprivately owned land, and only state-owned land will be acquired. Construction of facilities, such \nas the weir, pipelines, and the transmission line, will affect 33 households and 204 people. Of \nthese, 27 households and 163 people are considered severely affected per the Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).  A  resettlement  plan  disclosed  in  June  2019  has  an  entitlement  matrix  and \nresettlement budget to provide compensation at replacement cost and restore livelihoods as per \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); it will be updated to an implementation-ready plan upon \ncompletion  of  the  detailed  design  and  engineering  by  the  engineering,  procurement,  and \nconstruction  contractor.  Uzbekhydroenergo  will  provide  adequate  resources  to  comply  with  all \nsafeguard  requirements  in  the  resettlement  plan.  No  physical  and  economic  displacement  will \noccur  until  full  compensation  at  replacement  cost  and  all  other  entitlements  are  paid  to  the \ndisplaced people following the final resettlement plan. \n \n38. \ndefined by the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \nF. \n \n39. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 \n \n\nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
