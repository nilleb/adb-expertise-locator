It will support policy actions strengthening resilience to \ndisasters and provide a source of financing for timely emergency response and early recovery. \nThe program is the third phase of the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program; the first phase was \napproved in December 2017 for Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu,1 and the second phase in September \n2019 for FSM, RMI, Solomon Islands, and Tonga.2 In addition, ADB set up country-specific CDF \nprograms for the Cook Islands and Palau.3 Phase 3 will provide (i) another round of financing for \n(a)  countries  that  drew  down  their  CDF  programs  for  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic (the Cook Islands, FSM, RMI, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga) and (b) Tuvalu, \nwhich drew down the funds in February 2020 in response to Cyclone Tino; and (ii) CDF for the \nfirst time for Kiribati and Vanuatu.  \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDisasters  and  health  emergencies  in  the  Pacific.  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  DMCs  are  highly \nexposed  to  many  types  of  hazards,  including  tropical  cyclones,  earthquakes,  storm  surges, \ntsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, droughts, and disease outbreaks. The region experiences a \ndisproportionately high share of global disaster impacts relative to the size of its economy and \npopulation. Disaster risk is increasing because of climate change, poor development planning, \nunplanned  urbanization,  and  ecosystem  decline.  Climate  change  can  increase  the  intensity  of \nextreme  weather  events.  Sea  level  rise  is  increasing  erosion  and  the  risk  of  more  destructive \nstorm surges and tsunamis, and ocean warming and acidification are destroying the coral reefs \nthat form natural coastal barriers. Climate change may also create favorable conditions for the \ndistribution of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases.  \n \n\n4. \nPacific DMCs have limited resources and capacity to invest in resilience to natural hazards \nand  health  risks,  and  to  facilitate  timely  recovery  and  reconstruction;  they  also  face  further \nchallenges  because  of  their  remote  locations  and  geographical  features.  Most  have  relatively \nsmall populations that are widely dispersed over multiple islands, many of which are isolated and \ndifficult  to  reach  during  emergencies.  These  factors  contribute  to  the  relatively  high  cost  and \ndelayed delivery of emergency response and reconstruction. The delays exacerbate the indirect \neconomic and social costs of disasters, worsen their ultimate impacts, and compromise long-term \nfiscal balances. Disasters can erode many years of economic development gains by damaging \ncritical infrastructure, disrupting services, and diverting resources from development spending. 4 \n\n \n\n1  ADB.

Cook  Islands:  Disaster  Resilience  Program  ($10 \n\nmillion); and ADB. Cook Islands: Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 2) ($10 million). \n\n4  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Disaster  Risk  Management;  and  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Health  (both \n\naccessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fPolicy  and \n\n5. \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  risk  management.  Disaster  risk \nmanagement  (DRM)  objectives  are  generally  well  articulated  within  the  participating  DMCs\u2019 \npolicies  and  plans,  and  all  countries  have  defined  the  legal  responsibilities  for  DRM  and \nprocedures for declaring a state of emergency or disaster. However, building resilience requires \nactions on many fronts, and the countries remain constrained by limited capacity and competing \npriorities. Women and girls are disproportionately impacted by disasters and face greater barriers \nto  participating  in,  and  benefitting  from,  DRM  arrangements.  The  governments  recognize  that \nmore  effort  is  required  to  strengthen  policy  and  institutional  arrangements,  and  to  strengthen \ncapacity  to  reduce  risks  and  to  plan  and  implement  timely  and  effective  responses  and  early \nrecovery at national and local levels. DRM arrangements can be further strengthened by defining \nroles and responsibilities in policies and legislation, and by incorporating climate change and DRM \ninto national and sector planning. Sex-disaggregated data and gender analysis can help highlight \nthe  need  to  specifically  support  women  and  girls  through  policy  actions.  The  10  DMCs  have, \nthrough early and decisive action, prevented the spread of COVID-19 within their territories, and \nprepared  their  health  systems  to  manage  imported  cases  as  repatriation  of  nationals  and \nreopening  of  borders  are  being  introduced.5 In  order  to  contain  a  possible  outbreak,  whole-of-\ngovernment public health policies and legislation are required to ensure early detection, timely \nactivation of emergency response protocols for case management, and cross-sector coordination.  \n \n6. \nRisk-informed  investment  planning  processes  and  tools.  Capacity  to  deal  with \ndisasters and public health emergencies is particularly weak at the local level. Regular capacity \nbuilding  and  drills  are  required  to  ensure  successful  implementation  of  emergency  response \nplans. National disaster management offices are often underfunded, and health systems are weak \nthroughout the Pacific. Physical development and land use planning often give insufficient regard \nto considerations of resilience. Climate and disaster resilience of communities and assets can be \nstrengthened by enhancing related strategies and plans; strengthening gender mainstreaming; \nintegrating resilience considerations into sector, land use and settlement plans; and ensuring risk \nsensitive asset management, including for state-owned utilities. Capacity for infectious disease \nprevention, detection, and clinical management can be significantly strengthened in all countries, \nincluding  upgrading  of  local  laboratories for  COVID-19  testing,  expanding  quarantine  capacity, \nand maintaining adequate supply of essential medical supplies and equipment. Solomon Islands \nand Vanuatu must also contend with the aftermath of Cyclone Harold that struck in April 2020, \nand  the  duality  of  the  crises  requires  balancing  pandemic  prevention  and  cyclone  response \nneeds. Other DMCs have also experienced the dual impact of COVID-19 and extreme weather \nevents, such as droughts in FSM, RMI, and Palau. \n \nRisk financing. All 10 DMCs have some financial arrangements in place for emergency \n7. \nresponse,  including  annual  contingency  budgets  and,  in  some  cases,  sovereign  disaster \ninsurance.  Improved  access  to  and  management  of  disaster  finance  is  critical  for  achieving \nstrategic  outcomes  related  to  long-term  resilience.  In  the  event  of  a  significant  disaster, \ngovernments typically have insufficient resources through budget contingency lines, reserves, or \ninsurance to meet immediate financing needs. Instead, they rely heavily on budget reallocations, \nwhich  can  take  time  to  secure  and  often  redirect  funds  away  from  development  priorities. \nReallocations for emergency response within the health sector budget are particularly concerning \nwhere these deplete resources for critical health priorities. Supporting better use of emergency \nfinance requires strengthening public financial management and expenditure, and ensuring funds \nfor emergency response are earmarked, and that budgeting covers gender and social inclusion. \n \n \n\n5  As of 29 October 2020, imported COVID-19 cases or repatriated nationals have been reported in Solomon Islands \n\n(8) and RMI (2). All cases remain in isolation. The other eight countries remain COVID-19 free. \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f8. \nDevelopment  partner  support.  In  the  aftermath  of  disasters  in  the  Pacific,  major \ndevelopment partners\u2014including the governments of Australia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nJapan, New Zealand, and the United States\u2014usually move quickly to mobilize immediate relief, \nincluding  in-kind  support  and  financing  through  humanitarian  nongovernment  organizations. \nThe  United  Nations\u2019  Pacific  Humanitarian  Team  mobilizes  relief  and  technical  support  from \nseveral regional offices. Development partners, including ADB, also provide financing to support \nreconstruction. There is regular coordination between the governments and major development \npartners, including ADB, the World Bank, Australia, and New Zealand, on macroeconomic and \nstructural  reforms  and  joint  policy  matrices.  The  policy  dialogue  on  the  CDF  programs  is \ncoordinated with World Bank programs with Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Options.6 \n \n \n9. \nADB  engagement  and  lessons.  ADB  attaches  significant  importance  to  DRM  in  the \nPacific, and has provided loans, grants, and technical assistance (TA) for post-disaster response, \nearly recovery, and reconstruction. This support has progressively broadened from post-disaster \nassistance to proactive disaster risk reduction (DRR) through various financing mechanisms. ADB \nprovides  dedicated  funding  to  its  concessional  assistance-only  countries  through  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) 12 DRR financing mechanism; and concessional assistance countries \ncan access the ADF 13 (2021\u20132024) Regional Thematic Pool for DRR purposes. ADB often plays \na  key  role  in  post-disaster  needs  assessments  that  seek  to  inform  resilient  recovery  and \nreconstruction. For post-disaster humanitarian response, ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Disaster Response \nFund  can  provide  grants  up  to  $3  million  per  event  within  1  week  of  a  disaster. 7 Additional \nconcessional  funds  can  be  accessed  through  the  ADF  Disaster  Response  Facility  for  early \nrecovery  and  reconstruction.  Since  2004,  ADB  has  offered  an  emergency  assistance  loans \ninstrument  with  extended  grace  and  repayment  periods,  increased  retroactive  financing,  lower \ninterest rates, and streamlined processing requirements, thereby facilitating the approval of fast-\ntracked assistance for early recovery purposes.8 Nevertheless, emergency assistance loans can \nstill take 3 months or more to process, and reconstruction loans under normal lending modalities \ncan  take  significantly  longer.  Therefore,  since  2016,  ADB  has  set  up  contingent  financing \nprograms  in  eight  Pacific  DMCs  to  provide  more  timely  post-disaster  financing  through  stand-\nalone policy-based loans and grants. In August 2019, ADB formally adopted CDF as an option \nunder its policy-based lending policy,9 and in April 2020, ADB approved a special policy variation \nfor an initial duration of 15 months that expands the scope of new CDF to include health-related \nemergencies as part of ADB\u2019s response to COVID-19.10 \n \n10. \nADB  has  supported  efforts  to  strengthen  the  Pacific  region\u2019s  resilience  to  infectious \ndiseases  through  the  regional  vaccines  project  in  Samoa,  Tonga,  Tuvalu,  and  Vanuatu. 11 In \naddition to the countries drawing down on existing CDF programs, ADB\u2019s immediate and medium-\nterm  response  to  COVID-19  in  the  participating  countries  includes  the  COVID-19  Pandemic \nResponse  Option  assistance  approved  for  the  Cook  Islands  ($20  million),  FSM  ($14  million), \nPalau  ($20  million),  Samoa  ($20  million),  and  Solomon  Islands  ($20  million).12 A  policy-based \ngrant that included policy actions on COVID-19 response was also approved for Tonga ($12.2 \nmillion).13 These programs help address the economic and direct health impacts of COVID-19 by \n\n \n\n6  A contingent financing line to address shocks related to disasters caused by natural hazards or health-related events.  \n7  ADB.

All  10 \nparticipating countries have also accessed the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to address \nimmediate financing gaps under their national COVID-19 response plans.14 Through regional TA, \nADB  has  also  provided  support  for  regional  pooled  procurement  of  essential  and  emergency \nsupplies for COVID-19.15 In addition, ADB has other regional TA for medium- to long-term support \nin response to COVID-19 in Pacific DMCs.16  \n \nThe proposed approach. The program provides Pacific DMCs with a source of financing \n11. \nthat  can  be  rapidly  disbursed  following  disaster  events.  It  will  complement  risk  financing \ninstruments  currently  in  use  by  the  participating  governments,  including  annual  contingency \nbudgets,  national  disaster  funds,  parametric  disaster  insurance,  and  traditional  indemnity \ninsurance. Eligibility to withdraw loan and grant proceeds is based on achieving prior resilience-\nrelated policy actions, but disbursements will be triggered when a state of disaster or emergency \nis declared. The DRM policy actions for each participating DMC will reduce the underlying disaster \nrisk and enhance preparedness. Each government has also agreed on an ongoing post-program \npartnership framework (PPPF) to strengthen DRM performance that is based on a gap and needs \nanalysis in each country. In addition to disasters caused by natural hazards, the scope of phase \n3 is expanded to cover health-related emergencies in the policy matrices. The DMCs face similar \nchallenges and will benefit greatly from a regional approach in which good practices are shared. \nThe  program  will  support  coordination  and  cooperation  both  between  Pacific  DMCs  and  with \ndevelopment  partners  on  risk  financing  arrangements  and  policy  reform  discussions.  The  first \nphase of the regional program includes an attached TA, and this has been expanded to include \nthe new countries under phase 3.17 The TA project has started country-level support to strengthen \nthe  policy  environment  and  institutional  arrangements  for  DRM  by  strengthening  post-disaster \nfinancial management capacity, started work on disaster risk information in some countries, and \ninitiated multi-hazard disaster risk assessments. Gender considerations are mainstreamed in the \ncountry-level support under the TA. \n \n12. \nThe program is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, in particular its operational priority 3 on \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability, which supports strengthening DMCs\u2019 financial preparedness for disaster response \nthrough policy-based contingent financing.18 The program aligns with ADB\u2019s operational plan for \nhealth by strengthening institutions for improved health governance, and enabling health financing \nto  tackle  public  health  threats  and  pandemic  preparedness;19 and  with  the  Pacific  Approach, \nwhich serves as ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the 11 smaller Pacific DMCs, including \nthe  10  countries  in  this  program.20 The  Pacific  Approach  focuses  on  managing  risks  as  a  key \nstrategic  area,  and  highlights  the  need  to  (i)  expand  work  on  climate  change  and  DRM;  \n(ii) introduce innovative solutions to strengthen disaster preparedness, address vulnerability, and \nbuild  resilience;  (iii)  pursue  a  more  programmatic  and  regional  approach  to  financing  climate \n\n \n\n14 Approved amounts range between $0.5 million and $1.5 million per country.   \n15 ADB.

In  addition to  supporting  critical  DRM  actions, the  program \nsupports urgent measures required by DMCs to prepare for and address the economic impact of \nCOVID-19.  All  10  countries  have  made  significant  progress  in  strengthening  the  resilience  of \ninstitutions  and  communities  through  three  reform  areas  under  phase  3,  with  policy  actions \ncompleted by October 2020 as outlined below and in the country-specific policy matrices.22 \n \n14.   Reform  area  1:  Policy  and  institutional  arrangements  for  risk  management \nstrengthened. Resilience considerations were mainstreamed into the new national strategic plan \nin RMI. Long-term preparedness and response plans to COVID-19 and other health emergencies, \nand  COVID-19  specific  regulations,  were  developed  by  all  national  governments.  The  Cook \nIslands  and  Samoa  also  prepared  health  emergency  bills,  and  Vanuatu  prepared  a  role \ndelineation policy to standardize health systems. In Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, \nthe governments prepared climate change and DRM-related bills. Kiribati also prepared a national \naction  plan  on  climate  change,  incorporating  DRM,  and  considering  gender-differentiated \nvulnerabilities  and  impacts.  A  national  land  subdivision  policy,  incorporating  resilience \nconsiderations into land and settlement development, was approved for Vanuatu; a national urban \npolicy with resilience considerations was approved for Solomon Islands; and a national housing \nrecovery and resilience policy was approved for Tonga. The Solomon Islands Maritime Authority \nBoard was established, marking a significant step in strengthening the maritime authority\u2019s role in \nemergencies  and  disaster  events;  and  RMI  established  new  disaster management  operational \narrangements.  The  PPPFs  include  further  actions  in  these  areas  such  as  emergency \nmanagement acts; integrated policies and plans on climate change, DRM, and spatial planning; \nrisk-informed land-use and urban policies, as well as hazard and disaster data-sharing policies; \nand public health legislation and policies.  \n \n15.   Reform area 2: Risk-informed investment planning processes and tools improved. \nAsset  management  was  strengthened  in  the  Cook  Islands,  Palau,  Samoa  and  Tuvalu  through \nasset management plans and strategies, and improved asset registries and property registration \nand  building  licensing.  In  Palau,  risk  information  has  been  incorporated  into  the  urban \ndevelopment strategy and plan, and in Tuvalu, the Funafuti drought monitoring plan was approved \nto  improve  drought  preparedness.  Tonga\u2019s  new  water  resources  bill  incorporated  climate  and \ndisaster  resilience  considerations.  National  and/or  local-level  DRM  plans  were  prepared  in the \nCook Islands, FSM, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu; and integrated vulnerability assessments were \napproved  in  Tuvalu  using  a  whole-of-island  approach  to  inform  the  decision-making  process. \nIn RMI  and  Tonga,  sector  or  cluster  specific  standard  operating  procedures  and  terms  of \nreference  were  developed.  Kiribati  finalized  a  strategic  roadmap  for  emergency  management. \nCross-sectoral  table-top exercises  were  carried  out  in  FSM  and  RMI  to  strengthen  emergency \npreparedness.  Health  sector-specific  emergency  plans  and  regulations  were  prepared  in  all \n10 countries to define key preparedness and response activities, including expanding quarantine \nunits, upgrading isolation wards, stockpiling personal protective equipment and medication, and \nequipping  local  laboratories  for  COVID-19  testing.  In  FSM,  all  four  state  governments  also \n\n21 Pacific Community. 2016. Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific, 2017\u20132030.

In Palau, climate change and DRM \nwere incorporated into the high school science curriculum. The country-specific PPPFs include \nfurther actions on incorporating resilience considerations into building codes; updating national \ninfrastructure  investment  plans;  preparing  local  disaster  plans,  multi-hazard  risk  assessments, \nand  climate-  and  disaster  risk-sensitive  zoning  regulations;  and  strengthening  capacity  for \ninfectious disease prevention. \n \n16.   Reform  area  3:  Risk  financing  expanded.  Specific  COVID-19  economic  response \nfinancing  packages  were  approved  in  all  10  countries  including  a  long-term  phased  approach. \nResources  available  nationally  for  emergency  response  were  expanded  through  increased \nbudget allocations to national emergency funds, budgets and/or disaster insurance in the Cook \nIslands, FSM, Kiribati, RMI, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu; and Kiribati \nalso  prepared  a  climate  change  and  disaster  risk  financing  assessment  with  an  action  plan. \nThe PPPFs include further actions, such as development of multi-hazard contingency plans and \ndisaster risk financing strategies; and strengthening of post-disaster budget allocation, execution \nand reporting processes, and procurement arrangements. \n \n17. \nValue addition. Contingent financing can be effective in addressing risks associated with \nevents  that  would  exhaust  dedicated  national  reserves  or  contingency  budgets  but  occur  too \nfrequently to be covered cost-effectively through insurance. The program will address this critical \nfinancing gap. Moreover, ADB and the participating governments have engaged in an ongoing \npolicy dialogue since the processing of the previous CDF programs in the Pacific to support the \nimplementation of the policy actions identified in the previous PPPFs. The DRM gaps identified \nfollowing the approval of the earlier CDF programs are addressed by new PPPFs developed for \nphase  3,  including  near-  and  medium-term  government  plans  to  strengthen  resilience.  The \nattached  TA  (footnote  17)  supports  priority  PPPF  actions,  and  facilitates  regional  knowledge \nsharing on DRM and integration of regional objectives into national strategies. \n \nC. \n \n18.  \nThe impact of the program is aligned with goals 1 (strengthened integrated adaptation and \nrisk reduction to enhance resilience to climate change and disasters) and 3 (strengthened disaster \npreparedness, response and recovery) of the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific \n(footnote 21). The program is also aligned to objective 1 of the regional COVID-19 health sector \nsupport plan to expand country readiness and response operations.23 The program will provide a \ntimely and predictable source of emergency financing to facilitate rapid implementation of priority \nactions, and reduce the indirect economic and social costs of direct physical losses.  \n \n19.  \nThe policy actions will encourage reforms that ultimately result in economic benefits by \naddressing the constraints that have been identified in DRM. The economic impact of the policy \nactions will depend on the scale and type of disaster event, and geographic area of impact. Under \nreform area 1, potential benefits will include reduced loss of lives and property, and reduced costs \ndue  to  shorter  business  and  public  facility  closures.  These  benefits  will  result  from  improved \nplanning  and  response  and  faster  restoration  of  essential  infrastructure  and  services.  Under \nreform  area  2,  benefits  will  include  reduced  damage  to  property,  improved  public  safety,  and \nreduced health impacts. These will result from improved sector planning, improved response and \npreparedness to disasters and health-related emergencies, and more resilient infrastructure and \nassets.  Under  reform  area  3,  the  opportunity  costs  associated  with  budget  reallocations  and \nfinancial costs associated with additional borrowing will be reduced, while the economic stimulus \npackages will reduce the income loss of vulnerable households and businesses. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n23 World Health Organization. 2020. COVID-19 Pacific Health Sector Support Plan Phase II. Suva. \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nD. \n \n20.   During the initial availability period of 2021\u20132023, the overall development financing needs \nof participating governments are estimated to be 10.2%\u201325.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) \nper annum, with 12.5% to 16.2% of GDP to be mobilized from external financing, predominantly \nas grants.24 The post-disaster financing needs have been determined based on the likely fiscal \nimpact  of  medium-  to  low-frequency  disasters,  taking  into  account  resources  available  from \ndomestic  and  international  sources,  the  need  to  maintain  sustainable  levels  of  debt,  and  the \navailability of concessional resources. Although data on historical losses are incomplete, analysis \nundertaken under the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative indicates that \naverage annual losses from cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis alone are equivalent to 2.0% \nof GDP in the Cook Islands, 2.9% in FSM, 0.2% in Kiribati, 2.0% in RMI, 1.6% in Palau, 1.7% in \nSamoa, 3.0% in Solomon Islands, 4.3% in Tonga, 0.8% in Tuvalu, and 6.6% in Vanuatu. Probable \nmaximum losses for a 1-in-50-year event (limited to  cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis) are \nestimated at $56.8 million for the Cook Islands, $75.3 million for FSM, $0.4 million for Kiribati, \n$34.1  million  for  RMI,  $16.8  million  for  Palau,  $109.8 million  for  Samoa,  $189.6  million  for \nSolomon  Islands,  $140.2  million  for  Tonga,  $2.8 million  for  Tuvalu,  and  $61.4  million  for \nVanuatu. 25 In  addition  to  cyclones,  earthquakes  and  tsunamis,  frequent  flooding  and  drought \nevents are causing recurrent losses in the participating countries, with a cumulative impact on \nlivelihoods and economies. The 10 countries also experience storm surges, health emergencies \nand, in some cases, volcanic eruptions.  \n \n21. \nRecent examples of disasters in the participating countries include Cyclone Harold in April \n2020, which caused damage and loss estimated at $453 million (46% of GDP) in Vanuatu; and \n$111 million (25% of GDP) in Tonga. Other examples include Cyclone Gita in 2018, which caused \ndamage equivalent to 38% of GDP in Tonga; Cyclone Pam in 2015 with estimated damage and \nloss at around $600 million, or 64% of GDP in Vanuatu; severe flooding in 2014, causing damage \nequivalent to 9% of GDP in Solomon Islands; Typhoon Maysak, which caused losses equivalent \nto 4% of GDP in FSM; and severe drought in 2016, which caused losses of 3% of GDP in RMI. \nThe proposed financing per country under the program ranges from 0.5% to 9.4% of annual GDP, \nless than the cost of a typical medium-impact disaster in the Pacific.  \n \nThe economic impacts of COVID-19 are projected to be significant: travel restrictions are \n22.  \nexpected to cause significant declines in those Pacific economies dependent on either tourism or \nlabor exports. Economic contraction in the Pacific is now forecast at 6.1% in 2020 because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the Cook Islands, the economy is expected to contract by \n7.0% in FY2020 and by a further 15.4% in FY2021; and in Palau by 9.5% in FY2020 and by a \nfurther 12.8% in FY2021, mostly due to the total shutdown of the tourism sector due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic.26 Pacific countries continue to impose travel restrictions to safeguard their limited \nhealthcare  systems  from  possible  COVID-19  outbreaks.  To  help  finance  the  program,  the \ngovernments  have  requested  (i)  a  facility  of  NZ$30,312,000  for  the  Cook  Islands  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources  (OCR). 27  In accordance  with  the  CDF  pricing  option  2,  after  the \noccurrence  of  a  qualifying  disaster,  ADB  and  the  Cook  Islands  will  enter  into  a  short-form \nagreement that will specify the actual loan amount requested by the Cook Islands, as well as the \nlending terms, and only then will ADB commit the requested amount. Upon signing the short-form \nagreement there will be a one-time front-end fee of 0.10% of the committed loan amount. If the \ncommitted funds are not fully disbursed, the undisbursed loan amount could be renewed for a 3-\nyear availability period (up to four times), each time with a fee of 0.25% of the renewal amount \n\n \n\n24 Fiscal deficit and external financing figures are gross national income-weighted averages for the 10 countries. \n25 Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative. 2011.

Executing  agencies  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  or  equivalent  in  each  country. \nImplementing  agencies  will  include  ministries  responsible  for  health,  finance,  planning, \ninfrastructure,  DRM,  and  climate  change.  Each  participating  DMC  has  country-specific  policy \nactions and legal agreements. In the case of the eight countries that had earlier CDF programs \n(para. 2), the new policy actions were completed after the completion of the previous phase policy \nactions, but before 31 October 2020. In the case of newly joining countries, policy actions were \ncompleted between 1 December 2018 and 31 October 2020.28 The program will be completed on \n30 June 2024, with a renewal option for (i) a second 3-year period for the ADF countries; and (ii) \nup  to  four  additional  3-year  periods  for  the  OCR  countries.  Program  renewal  is  subject  to \nreconfirmation  as  to  adequacy  of  the  macroeconomic  environment,  including  an  updated \nInternational Monetary Fund assessment letter; DMCs\u2019 continued progress toward the PPPF; and \nan updated PPPF with mutually agreed objectives for the subsequent availability period. Renewal \nmay also be affected by any changes to the country classification during the program period.29  \n \n24.   Disbursements. A withdrawal may be triggered after a government declares a state of \ndisaster  or  emergency  in  accordance  with  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations,  or  takes \nequivalent  measures,  following  a  disaster  caused  by  a  natural  hazard  or  a  health-related \nemergency during the availability period; or, in the case of COVID-19, only after the government \n\n28 Policy actions were identified, and their implementation encouraged through policy dialogue, which has been ongoing \n\nsince 2017 with some support from various ongoing TA projects. \n\n29 Footnote 9, para. 26. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\freports occurrence of community transmission as confirmed by the World Health Organization,30 \nas specified in each legal agreement. The government can withdraw the loan and grant proceeds \npartially or entirely, depending on its assessment of the event\u2019s severity and resultant need. Only \na  single  withdrawal  may  be  requested  per  event,  and the  request  should  be  received  by  ADB \nwithin  90  days  of  the  respective  declaration  of  a  state  of  disaster  or  emergency  or  equivalent \nmeasure.31 Any undisbursed amounts at the conclusion of the availability period can be disbursed \nto the respective participating countries under the deferred disbursement option, subject to ADB \nreconfirming the DMC\u2019s continued adoption of policy actions and the PPPF through submission \nof a progress report. Funds will be spent through national budget processes for eligible items.32 \nProceeds of the policy-based loans and grants will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  periodically  monitor \ncontinuing implementation of the policy actions and PPPF during the availability period. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n25.  \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \nas category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples safeguards.33 \nProgram activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none of the activities will \nresult in or lead to any physical works that could create environmental or social impacts, physical \nor  economic  displacement,  or  involuntary  resettlement.  The  activities  will  not  negatively  affect \nindigenous  peoples.  Stakeholder  dialogue  was  carried  out  during  the  program  design  and  will \ncontinue during implementation. The policy actions will improve the participating countries\u2019 ability \nto maintain greater fiscal stability in the event of a disaster or health emergency and to initiate \nrelief  and recovery  efforts  with  minimum  delay, thereby  reducing  the  immediate  economic  and \nsocial  impacts  of  the  event.  Implementation  of  the  policy  actions  is  expected  to  continue  to \nstrengthen  existing  social  protection  arrangements,  helping  to  ensure  that  communities  and \nvulnerable households (including households headed by women) can receive support to rebuild \ntheir lives and assets. The policy actions on COVID-19 response will benefit vulnerable groups \nsuch as older people and those with pre-existing co-morbidities, as they will be disproportionately \naffected by the potential direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n26.  \nThe  program  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Women  are  impacted  by \ndisasters  and  health  emergencies  in  different  and  often  overlooked  ways.  The  program  will \ndirectly  benefit  women  by  ensuring  gender  is  a  core  component  of  key  strategic  and  policy \ndocuments.  Gender-responsive  policy  and  institutional  arrangements  for  risk  management \ninclude  gender-specific  performance  indicators  to  monitor  the  empowerment  and  protection  of \nwomen  and  girls  in  climate  change  and  DRM  plans (Kiribati);  a national housing  recovery  and \nresilience policy that prioritizes households headed by women (Tonga); and climate change or \nDRM  acts  that  commit  to  gender  mainstreaming,  ensuring  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision-\nmaking,  and  providing  support  for  gender-based  violence  prevention  and  response  in  post-\ndisaster  situations  (RMI,  Tuvalu,  and  Vanuatu).  Investment  planning  processes  and  tools  that \nsupport  women  and  girls  include  community  integrated  management  plans  for  climate  and \ndisaster resilience that promote the participation of women in DRM decision-making (Samoa and \nTonga); Cyclone Tino Recovery and Vulnerability Reduction Plan allocating funding for gender \n\n \n\n30 Community  transmission  is  the  highest  level  of  the  4-level  COVID-19  transmission  classification  adopted  by  the \nWorld Health Organization. It involves large outbreaks of local transmission defined through an assessment of factors \nincluding, but not limited to: (i) large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission chains; (ii) large numbers of cases \nfrom sentinel lab surveillance; and (iii) multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country. \n\n31 The start date of a disaster event is often not clear (e.g., droughts, floods); however, a declaration is typically issued \nvery shortly after a natural hazard event turns into a disaster, and is therefore used as a proxy for the disaster event.  \n\n32 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fand  protection  initiatives  (including  gender-based  violence),  and  integrated  vulnerability \nassessments that include gender analysis and data (Tuvalu); municipal preparedness plans that \nuse standardized damage assessment forms, including questions on women\u2019s needs and gender-\nbased violence (FSM); and an Urban Development Plan that highlights linkages to Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goal  5  on  women\u2019s  empowerment,  and  commits  to  the  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated data and gender analysis (Palau). The final reform area on expanded risk financing \nincludes funding commitments for gender and protection clusters (Solomon Islands), provision of \ndignity kits for women and girls (RMI), and support for caregivers (the Cook Islands). \n \n27.   Coordinating disaster and health emergency response, including the support offered by \ndonors  and  civil  society organizations  with  competing  requirements  and procedures, can  pose \nsignificant  administrative  challenges.  Therefore,  government  absorption  capacities  are  often \nstretched in the aftermath of such events. The regional TA under phase 1 has been expanded to \ninclude all countries under phase 3, and it prioritizes capacity development focused on financing \nand budgetary issues, including post-disaster budget allocation and execution, to ensure that all \nparticipating  countries  have  adequate  systems  in  place  to  use  program  resources  effectively, \naccountably,  and  transparently  (footnote  17).  Risks  to  program  implementation  are  related  to \npossible external shocks to the economies and capacity constraints among government agencies, \nincluding public financial management system constraints. These risks will be managed in part \nthrough support for capacity development of government counterparts. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \n28.   ADB\u2019s  debt  sustainability  analyses  for  the  Cook  Islands  and  Palau\u2014the  only  countries \nunder phase 3 accessing loan resources\u2014indicate that near-term vulnerabilities have increased \nas a result of the fiscal impacts of COVID-19. 35 However, with public debt-to-GDP ratios projected \nto  decline  over  the  medium-term  as  economies  recover  from  the  current  crisis,  ADB\u2019s  debt \nsustainability  analyses  conclude \nthese  countries. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernments and executing agencies.  \n \n\nremains  sustainable \n\nthat  debt \n\nin \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe governments have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \n29.  \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the legal \nagreements. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that a qualifying disaster \nevent has occurred or that the conditions for deferred disbursement option have been met. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed contingent disaster financing facility, policy-based loan, \n30.  \nand policy-based grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n\n \n\n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Debt sustainability analyses are conducted in connection with recent or planned CPRO operations. For the Cook \nIslands,  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  projected  peak  at  about  43%  in  FY2022  before  declining  gradually  to  38%  by \nFY2024. For Palau, public debt is seen to reach 69% of GDP in FY2021 but can revert to the pre-COVID-19 level of \n32% of GDP by FY2028. Sound macroeconomic management is an eligibility criterion for CPRO operations, which \nhave been approved for the Cook Islands, FSM, Palau, Samoa, and Solomon Islands, and are forthcoming for RMI \nand Vanuatu. The IMF Assessment Letters for 9 countries (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2), and ADB\u2019s macroeconomic assessment for the Cook Islands, confirm that the countries broadly demonstrated \nstrong macroeconomic management prior to COVID-19, allowing them to build fiscal buffers, but the pandemic is \nresulting in temporary near-term fiscal imbalances.   \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nthe contingent disaster financing facility to the Cook Islands for the Pacific Disaster \nResilience  Program  (Phase  3)  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  not  exceeding \nNZ$30,312,000, which comprises the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  in  regular  terms,  with  interest  and  other  terms  to  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  and  is  subject  to  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft facility agreement presented to the Board; \nthe loan of $20,000,000 to the Republic of Palau for the Pacific Disaster Resilience \nProgram  (Phase  3)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in  regular  terms,  with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board;  \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $6,000,000  to  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster \nResilience  Program  (Phase  3)  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board;  \nthe grant not exceeding $8,000,000 to the Republic of Kiribati from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  for  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience \nProgram (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board;  \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $6,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster \nResilience  Program  (Phase  3)  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board; \nthe  grant  not  exceeding $10,000,000  to  Independent  State  of  Samoa from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  for  the  Pacific  Disaster \nResilience  Program  (Phase  3)  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board;  \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $5,000,000  to  the  Solomon  Islands  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  for  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience \nProgram (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board; \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  the grant not exceeding $10,000,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  for  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience \nProgram (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board;  \nthe grant not exceeding $4,000,000 to Tuvalu from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 3) on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft grant agreement presented to the Board; and \nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $5,000,000  to  Republic  of  Vanuatu  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  for  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience \nProgram (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident\n\n \n\n \n16 November 2020 \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the \nReform \nResilience of \ninstitutions and \ncommunities \nstrengthened \n\nReform Areas \n \n1.
