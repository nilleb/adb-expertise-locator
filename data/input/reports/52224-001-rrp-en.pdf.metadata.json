By supporting an established international renewable energy investor, it will provide impetus \nto Government  of  Kazakhstan  efforts  to  promote  investment  in the  renewable  sector.  This  will \nhelp replace imports of electricity in power-deficient south-eastern Kazakhstan with indigenous \nrenewable sources. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. Kazakhstan\u2019s electricity sector is largely privatized and unbundled \ninto generation, transmission, and distribution systems, and power traders. There is competition \nin electricity generation as Kazakhstan operates a wholesale market and tariffs are deregulated, \nalthough  the  government  has  retained  price  regulation  in  \u201csocially  significant\u201d  segments. 1 \nHowever, the major challenge is the reliance of the electricity sector on coal-fired plants. As of 31 \nDecember 2017, Kazakhstan\u2019s total installed capacity was 21.6 gigawatts, with available capacity \nof 18.7 gigawatts. Coal-fired plants account for 80.5% of generated electricity, hydro power plants \nfor 10.9%, gas for 8.2%, and solar and wind sources for 0.4%.2 There are 118 power plants with \ndifferent  forms  of  private  and  state-controlled  ownership.  The  government  classifies  the  most \nimportant assets (large thermal power plants and hydro power plants) as power plants of national \nimportance. While some investments in upgrades have been made over the years, about 70% of \ninstalled capacity is considered technically obsolete.3 There is still a significant electricity supply \nshortage, especially in Kazakhstan\u2019s southern region. The country\u2019s entire electricity sector needs \nsignificant investment to rehabilitate outdated assets and expand capacity.4 In 2013, Kazakhstan \nadopted  an  ambitious  plan  to  transition  to  a  green  economy,  aiming  to  increase  the  share  of \nrenewable energy in electricity generation to 50% by 2050.5 \n \n4. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a strong working relationship with the European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  in  Kazakhstan.  The  EBRD  has  been  very \nactive  in  Kazakhstan  renewable  energy,  policy  and  investments,  and  successfully  financed \nseveral renewable energy projects. ADB and EBRD are jointly financing the Baikonyr Solar Power \nProject,6 which is the first joint renewable energy project between ADB and EBRD in Kazakhstan. \nBuilding  on  this  successful  partnership  with EBRD,  ADB  was  invited  to  support the  project,  as \nADB is one of very few financial institutions with the capacity to raise local currency funding to \nfinance renewable energy projects with tariffs denominated in tenge.  \n                                                \n1  As a result, affordability for consumers and cost recovery are well addressed and balanced. \n2  Kazakhstan Operator of Electric Power and Capacity Market. 2017.

The borrower is M-KAT Green LLP, a special-purpose vehicle \n\nProject  design.  The  project  comprises  the  design,  construction,  commissioning,  and \n5. \noperations and maintenance (O&M) of a 135 megawatt (MW) (direct current) ground-mounted, \nsolar power plant with single axis tracking system (along with associated infrastructure) and grid \nintegration  for  further  electricity  sale  per  a  fixed  tariff.  The  project  site    is  in  southeastern \nKazakhstan, about 3 kilometers (km) south of the town of Shu in the Jambyl Region and will cover \n500 hectares. The land needed for the project has been acquired and leased  from the land office \nof  Shu  district  for  49  years.  The  main  project  components  will  include  approximately  403,200 \nphotovoltaic panels, 40 inverters, a substation and a 12 km 220 kilovolts (kV) transmission line to \nthe  existing  500kV  substation.  The  total  annual  output  from  the  project  is  expected  to  be  207 \ngigawatt-hours, with an average capacity factor of 17.5% at P90.7  \n \n6. \nPower  from the  project will  be  sold under  a  15-year  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA) \nwhich  was  executed  on  9  September  2016  between  M-KAT  Green  LLP  and  the  Financial \nSettlement  Centre  for  Support  to  Renewable  Energy  Sources  LLP  (FSC).  All  electric  power \nproduced by the project will be purchased by the FSC, a limited liability  partnership created in \n2013  and  100%  owned  by  the  Kazakhstan  Electricity  Grid  Operating  Company  Joint  Stock \nCompany (KEGOC) for the promotion of renewable power sources in Kazakhstan. The prevailing \nfixed tariff rate for power produced from solar energy is T34.61 per kilowatt-hour less value-added \ntax, indexed annually and adjusted for inflation (confidential information redacted). \n \n7. \nincorporated in Kazakhstan (confidential information redacted). \n \n8. \n \n9. \n \n10. \n \nIntegrity  and  enhanced  tax  integrity  due  diligence  were  conducted. 8 No  significant  or \n11. \npotentially significant integrity risk was identified.

The  project  outcome  will  be  additional  solar  power  generation  to  satisfy  the \n\n13. \nincreasing electricity demand and the avoidance of carbon dioxide emissions.11  \n \n14. \nOutputs. The outputs are (i) 135 MW direct current (nominal power) of solar power project \nis  commissioned  and  operated  by  the  private  sector;  (ii)  generation  of  local  employment;  (iii) \nstimulation  of  local  and  national  economy;  and  (iv)  gender  equity  of  human  resource  policy \nimproved. \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n15. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  which  includes  tackling  climate  change  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability as among the key operational priorities.12 ADB\u2019s support for the project is also in \nline  with  its  country  partnership  strategy  for  Kazakhstan,  2017\u20132021,13 as  the  project  will  help \nfoster sustainable green growth in response to climate change by promoting the use of renewable \nenergy sources, and support private sector operations in clean and renewable energy. \n \n16. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB\u2019s Energy Policy \nemphasizes  investments  in  renewable  energy  projects,  private  sector  participation,  and  wider \naccess \nthe  recently  approved  Samruk-Energy \nRestructuring and Transformation Project, which has a focus on developing a renewable energy \npipeline in the country.15 This ADB loan will be counted as climate financing and will help achieve \nADB\u2019s annual climate finance target of $6 billion by 2020. \n \nLessons  learned  from  previous  operations.  ADB,  jointly  with  other  international \n17. \nfinancial  institutions,  has  been  actively  involved  in  the  dialogue  on  legal  and  regulatory \nimprovements  to  attract  private  sector  investments  in  renewable  energy  generation  of \nKazakhstan. The project will benefit from ADB's earlier support to the government to achieve its \nintended  nationally  determined  contribution  and  renewable  power  generation  targets. 16  The \ntransmission operator KEGOC has been trained and equipped with modern tools to analyze the \nimpact  of  intermittent  power  generation  sources  on  the  grid  stability  and  undertake  necessary \nstabilizing measures (confidential information redacted).  Key lessons learned is the significance \nof  having  a  robust  upstream  regulatory  framework  and  ensuring  that  the  grid  is  sufficiently \nstrengthened to accept renewable, intermittent sources of energy,  before the private sector can \nbe meaningfully attracted to the renewable sector at scale.  \n \nD. \n \n18. \n  \nE. \n \n19. \n\n(Confidential information redacted).   \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n                                                \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 ADB. 2018.

The repayment profile of the ADB loan, which is significantly longer than what is \navailable in the market for similar transactions, is necessary for the project to achieve sound debt \nservice coverage levels over the life of the project. ADB\u2019s proposed assistance will also have a \ndemonstration effect on other developers and sponsors, thereby helping establish the viability of \nsolar  power  projects  in  a  country  with  an  emerging  solar  power  sector.  ADB\u2019s  local  currency \nsupport\u2014appropriate  for  projects  of  this  nature  that  generate  local  currency  denominated \nrevenues\u2014will  strengthen  the  momentum  towards  long-term  local  currency  financing  of \nrenewable energy assets. ADB\u2019s assistance will ensure that the project is developed with high \nenvironmental and social standards. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n \n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\n(Confidential information redacted).  \n\n(Confidential information redacted). \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nADB  has  determined  the  investment  to  be  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009),  with  the  following  categorizations:  environment\u2014category  B,  involuntary \n\n4  \n \n\nF. \n \n20. \n \n\n23. \n \n24. \n \n25. \n \n26. \n \n27. \n \n28. \n \n29. \n \n30. \n \n\n \n\n\f 5 \n\n \n\nresettlement\u2014category  C,  and  indigenous  peoples\u2014category  C. 17 ADB  has  undertaken  due \ndiligence  and  reviewed  the  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  and  the \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts in the safeguard \nreports  and  plans.  The  environmental  and  social  measures  and  the  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment of M-KAT Green LLP to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are \ndeemed adequate. \n \n32. \nEnvironmental  Safeguards.  An  initial  environmental  examination  report  has  been \nprepared by an independent consultant. The potential environmental impacts\u2014noise, vibration, \ndust, waste generation, ground contamination, and soil erosion\u2014are generally associated with \nconstruction  activities.  These  impacts  are  generally  site-specific  and  short-term  and  can  be \neffectively  managed  by  implementing  good  engineering,  construction,  and  housekeeping \npractices  as  well  as  preventive  and  control  measures  reflected  in  the  World  Bank  Group\u2019s \nEnvironmental,  Health,  and  Safety  General  Guidelines,  as  detailed  in  the  site-specific \nenvironmental  management  plans. 18  Occupational  health  and  safety  risks  will  be  mitigated \nthrough the development of a health and safety plan that will include routine training, monitoring, \nand the provision of personal protective equipment. Environmental and occupational health and \nsafety  provisions,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements,  will  be \nincorporated into the contractor agreements. The sponsor is required to submit a safeguards and \nsocial  monitoring  report  on  an  annual  basis  that  will  include  information  on  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social aspects.  \n \n33. \nSocial Safeguards. The project will not cause involuntary resettlement and will not impact \nindigenous peoples. The project will be built on a 500-ha state reserve land classified as pasture \nland. The land has not been allocated to any entity. A graveyard and water canal were within the \ninitial land allocation plan, but these areas will be excluded when the solar power plant is fenced \nto avoid displacement impacts. Two adjacent villages - Alga and Sauytbek - graze their livestock \nin  the  area  until  early  summer,  after  which  the  grass  withers  and  irrigation  channels  dry  out. \nTraditional non-intensive husbandry is practiced, with the villages accessing the adjacent state-\nowned  pasture  land.  The  fencing  of  the  solar  power  plant  will  not  have  significant  impacts \nbecause: (i) the allocated area is poorly vegetated grassland, a portion of which is used only for \ngrazing in spring and early summer; (ii) the villagers consider non-intensive husbandry as a hard, \nrisky business, with marginal profit, and would readily change to another profession or intensive \nhusbandry  with  livestock  kept  indoors;  and  (iii)  other  pasture  lands  are  available  that  can  be \naccessed and used by the villagers and herders. (Confidential information redacted).  \n \n34. \n \n35.  \nThe proposed solar power project site is in the Shu district of Jambyl Region. Inhabitants \nof  the  area  are  almost  exclusively  Kazakh,  with  a  few  oralman  (returnee)  families  from  the \nKarakalpak region of Uzbekistan, Iran and the People\u2019s Republic of China. The oralmans are fully \nintegrated  with  the  local  community,  know  the  legislation,  and  are  represented  in  the  local \ngoverning  bodies.  The  project  will  not  impact  sociocultural  groups  who  may  be  considered \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n36. \nGender Mainstreaming.

During  the  construction  period,  a  maximum  of  400  workers  are \nexpected to be employed, of which 5% are likely to be women. During the operations phase, the \nproject will employ about 16 staff (4 technical specialists, 3 cleaners, 6 solar panel cleaners, and \n3 guards), at least 25% of whom will be women. Women staff will benefit from relevant training. \nThe  human  resources  policy  will  be  enhanced  to  include  provisions  on  nondiscrimination  and \nprevention  of  sexual  harassment.  A  corporate  social  responsibility  program  will  be  developed \nwhich will take into consideration projects that will benefit vulnerable people including women and \ngirls.  \n \n37.
