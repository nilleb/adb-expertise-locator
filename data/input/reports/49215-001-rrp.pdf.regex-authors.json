THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Support  for  Project  Implementation  of  the  Nepal  Earthquake \nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. 1 \n \n2.  The Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project will support the Government of Nepal to \naccelerate recovery and reconstruction following the devastating earthquake of 25 April 2015 and \nthe major aftershock of 12 May 2015. The project will support the rebuilding of schools, roads, \nand district-level government buildings, and strengthen resilience to future disasters. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Disaster risk in Nepal. Nepal is one of the most disaster-prone and vulnerable countries \nin the world. It is the 11th most earthquake-vulnerable country, with major earthquakes occurring \nabout every 80 years.2  \n \n4.  Description of the emergency. An earthquake of 7.8 magnitude struck Nepal on 25 April \n2015. Its epicenter was in Gorkha district, 77 kilometer (km) northwest of Kathmandu, causing \nwidespread damage. Key characteristics of the disaster are (i) the prolonged period of large-scale \naftershocks; and (ii) catastrophic damages to poorly built buildings and infrastructure in vast and \nrugged rural terrain that is difficult to access. The humanitarian impact of the earthquake has \nbeen equally serious, affecting as many as 8 million people. Estimates, as of 3 June 2015, show \n8,702 deaths and 22,493 injuries. Preliminary reports indicate that more than 785,000 homes \nwere destroyed or damaged. Education of around 1.5 million children has also been affected, as \nthe earthquake destroyed or damaged about 7,000 schools.3   \n \n5.  The government, international community, and nongovernment organizations responded \nquickly to provide immediate rescue and relief. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a \n$3 million grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund on 27 April 2015.  \n \n6.  Damage and loss to property and infrastructure. On 20 May 2015, a joint post-disaster \nneeds assessment (PDNA) was initiated by the government in partnership with development \npartners,  including  ADB,  the  European  Union,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the \nUnited Nations, and the World Bank. Covering 23 sectors and themes, it assessed damages and \nlosses caused by the earthquakes.4 Preliminary estimates of direct damage total $4.8 billion\u2013$7.7 \nbillion, equivalent to about 22%\u201335% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the country.5 The \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  United Nations Development Programme. 2009. Nepal Country Report: Global Assessment of Risk. ISDR Global \nAssessment Report on Poverty and Disaster Risk 2009. Kathmandu. \n3  Classrooms are the unit used by the government to estimate damages; and 30,000 classrooms is about 7,000 \nschools.  \n4  ADB led the sector assessments for education (co-led with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund), irrigation, transport, \nand macroeconomic impact (co-led with the World Bank) in collaboration with respective agencies and supported the \npreparation of the cross-cutting disaster risk resilience report.   \n5  Post-Disaster  Needs  Assessment  Draft  Executive  Summary  (accessible from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \nAppendix 2).  \n ", "2 \nlargest component is private housing, which amounts to $1.2 billion\u2013$3.9 billion,6 followed by \neducation at $250 million. \n \n7.  Economic impacts. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, annual GDP growth in \nFY2015 will be 1.6 percentage points lower than the 4.6% estimated in the Asian Development \nOutlook 2015.7 The services sector accounted for 51.0% of FY2014 GDP and has been hit \nhardest, particularly tourism. The main earthquake and prolonged aftershocks caused extensive \ndamage in seven out of 10 world heritage sites in Kathmandu valley and severely affected \npopular trekking routes. The agriculture sector appears less affected in FY2015, given that the \nharvesting season had passed. However, the impacts of lost livestock and productive assets, \nwhich were severe in affected districts, will prolong recovery. Prior to the earthquakes, Nepal was \nmaintaining a sound fiscal balance, with a fiscal deficit of only 0.1% of GDP in FY2014 and a \nsurplus of 0.7% of GDP in FY2013. Public debt has been consistently declining. A preliminarily \ndebt sustainability analysis indicates that Nepal may be able to maintain its current low debt \ndistress rating. However, close monitoring and concessional support will be needed to cope with \nthe upward pressure. Overall, the economic growth outlook is contingent on the scope and pace \nof reconstruction activities, remittance inflows, the political situation, and monsoon rains. \n \n8.  Poverty impacts. The 14 severely affected districts8 account for about 13.6% of the total \npopulation living below the poverty line in Nepal. Among them, six have higher poverty rates than \nthe national average of 25.2%,9 and nine have a human development index score lower than the \nnational  average.  Preliminary  estimates  show  that  the  income  shock  resulting  from  the \nearthquake will likely push an additional 700,000 to 982,000 people below the poverty line. The \nincome shock is largely felt through the loss of income-generating opportunities and livelihoods \n(including death and injuries to primary wage earners); and the loss of housing, productive assets \n(seeds, livestock, and farm equipment), and durable assets (assorted household items). Progress \ntoward  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  is  likely  to  be  adversely  affected  given  the \nwidespread damage to schools, houses, and health posts. 10 \n \n9.  The poor and vulnerable are particularly dependent on local infrastructure for access to \nlabor and commodity markets, and for services such as health care and education that strengthen \nhuman capital, especially that of children. Reviving local economic activities and resumption of \nbasic public services, coupled with an accelerated implementation of reconstruction projects, will \nbe critical to make up for the setback on poverty reduction. Restoring educational services after \nsuch a disaster is crucial, since time away from school has long-term negative impacts on \neducation and development. Rebuilding school facilities, planning for a better educational future, \nrestoring connectivity, and promoting resilience are all ways to support faster recovery. \n \n10.  Government\u2019s  reconstruction  strategy,  road  map,  and  response.  In  line  with \npreliminary  PDNA  findings,  the  government  has  started  preparing  a  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction policy. The government is also organizing a high-level donors\u2019 conference on \n25 June 2015 to consult on the reconstruction strategy and programs, including financing. The \n                                                \n6  The amount varies depending on the valuation method used for rural housing. \n7   ADB. 2015. Asian Development Outlook 2015: Financing Asia\u2019s Future Growth. Manila.  \n8  Bhaktapur, Dhading, Dolakha, Gorkha, Kathmandu, Kavrepalanchok, Lalitpur, Makawanpur, Nuwakot, Okhaldhunga, \nRasuwa, Ramechhap, Sindhuli, and Sindhupalchowk. \n9  The districts below the national poverty average are Dolakha, Makwanpur, Ramechhap, Rasuwa, Sindhuli, and \nSindhupalchowk. \n10 Sustainable Development Goal targets for education include (i) ensuring that all girls and boys complete free, \nequitable, and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes by 2030; \nand (ii) building and upgrading education facilities that are child, disability, and gender sensitive and provide safe, \nnon-violent, inclusive, and effective learning environments for all by 2030. \n ", "3 \ngovernment  has  set  up  a  National  Reconstruction  Fund  to raise  $2 billion,  and  contributed \n$200 million. The outcome of the conference will be reflected in the FY2016 budget to be finalized \nby 15 July 2015 for immediate initiation of the reconstruction programs.  \n \n11.  Development  partner  coordination.  Before  the  earthquake,  various  development \npartners had been closely coordinating to build  the government\u2019s disaster risk management \n(DRM) capacity. In 2009, the Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium was launched by the government \nin partnership with several development partners including ADB, to strengthen preparedness, \nresponse systems, and the overall policy framework. ADB assisted in pilot retrofitting 160 schools \nin Kathmandu valley (all of which withstood the earthquake of 25 April 2015) and preparing a \nnational  school  safety master  plan.  After  the earthquake, the government  and  development \npartners closely coordinated rescue, relief, and early recovery efforts. The PDNA process also \ndemonstrated  a  high  level  of  coordination.  The  outcome  of  the  PDNA  provides  a  common \nplatform to implement development partner-assisted reconstruction programs in a harmonized \nand collaborative manner.  \n \n12.  Close consultations continue among key development partners and the government on \nthe assistance to be provided. The government intends to apply aid coordination principles as \nreflected in the Paris Declaration\u2014reduced fragmentation, development partner collaboration \npossibly led by a key development partner in each sector, and harmonization. Based on these \nprinciples, focal areas for ADB assistance in the initial part of the reconstruction phase were \nidentified as education (in light of ADB\u2019s lead role taken in school safety under the Nepal Risk \nReduction Consortium), road transport, and district towns (in light of the long-term partnership of \nADB in the urban sector). These sectors were also selected in view of the highly significant social \ndevelopment and livelihood restoration implications.11 Development partners were consulted on \nthe proposed project design to provide a platform for others to cofinance. \n \n13.  Request for emergency assistance loan. The government requested an emergency \nassistance  loan  (EAL)  on  27  May  2015  to  support  its  post-earthquake  recovery  and \nreconstruction.  ADB\u2019s  different  lending  modalities  were  assessed  to  determine  the  most \nappropriate way to help the government respond to urgent needs while remaining within the \nnational expenditure programs. 12  \n \n14.  Lessons  in  disaster  response.  The  project  incorporates  key  lessons  from  recent \ndisasters in India, Pakistan, and the Philippines. It supports the government to build back better \n(BBB) and strengthen resilience to future disasters, particularly through more resilient schools, \nroads and government office buildings and by using school communities to build awareness and \ncapacity  for  DRM.  Government  capacity  for  BBB  will  also  be  strengthened  through \nimplementation of the project and capacity building. In view of the finite human resources within \nthe government, the project will require outsourcing of experts to supplement the gaps while not \ndiverting  human  resources  from  ongoing  development  operations.  Building  on  the  existing \npartnership  with  and  capacity  of  the  sector  agencies  is  another  lesson  to  facilitate  timely \nimplementation,  while  using  advanced  procurement  and  retroactive  financing.  To  promote \ntransparency, reduce the administrative burden, and ensure sound management, a TA will be \nprovided to set up an electronic, results-based monitoring, and evaluation system. Finally, to \nidentify synergies and avoid duplication, close development coordination was undertaken for \nselecting sectors and designing the project. \n                                                \n11  In the meantime, the World Bank is planning to focus on rural housing reconstruction. The Japan International \nCooperation Agency has also shown interest in reconstruction and building resilience in major cities.  \n12 The project meets all six characteristics of an EAL, as defined in the Staff Instructions. ADB. 2015. Staff Instruction \non Processing and Administration of Emergency Assistance Loans. Compendium of Staff Instructions. Manila. \n ", "4 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The  impact  of  the  project  is  accelerated  economic  and  social  recovery  in  Nepal\u2019s \nearthquake affected districts. The outcome will be critical economic and social services resumed \nwith disaster-resilient infrastructure.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  In response to and in line with the PDNA findings, the project has four outputs:13 \n(i)  Output 1: Schools are rebuilt and upgraded. At least 700 schools will be rebuilt \nor retrofitted in line with school reconstruction plans to disaster-resilient standards \nand  equipped  with  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  including  sex-disaggregated \ntoilets.14 About five will be model schools built with information and communication \ntechnology equipment, science laboratories, and improved learning spaces.  \n(ii)  Output 2: Roads and bridges are rehabilitated and/or reconstructed. About \n135 km  of  strategic roads  and  about  450 km of rural  roads  damaged  by  the \nearthquake and landslides will be rehabilitated.15 Project roads and bridges will \nhave built back better features for road safety and climate resilience. Construction \nand maintenance equipment will also be procured. \n(iii)  Output  3:  District-level  government  facilities  constructed  and/or  rebuilt. \nAbout 300 district-level government buildings will be rebuilt or retrofitted to disaster \nresilient standards with basic utilities, and furnished.16 Transitional district-level \ngovernment  offices  will  also  be  established  to  enable  services  to  continue \nthroughout the reconstruction period. \n(iv)  Output 4: Disaster preparedness and management capacities strengthened. \nAll outputs are assured to be disaster risk resilient. Engineering divisions of all \nimplementing agencies will be strengthened.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n17.  Investment plan. The project is estimated to cost $232 million (Table 1). Detailed cost \nestimates by expenditure category and detailed cost estimates by financier are provided in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).17 \n \n18.  Financing plan. The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR143,212,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum; a term of 40 years, including a grace \nperiod of 10 years; repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the grace \nperiod and 4% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The loan from ADB will finance (i) civil works and equipment, (ii) consulting \nservices and capacity building, (iii) financing charges during construction on ADB\u2019s loan, and (iv) \n                                                \n13  Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval Procedures (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  The  total  number  of  classrooms  to  be  rebuilt  or  retrofitted  is  at  least  7,000,  or  almost  one-fourth  of  the \n30,000 damaged classrooms, benefiting at least 350,000 children. \n15 PDNA  preliminary  estimates  are  damages  to  4,400  km  of  roads  in  rural  areas,  requiring  $250  million  for \nreconstruction. Their reconstruction is critical to restore the livelihoods of the affected population.    \n16  This responds to the urgent need for restoration of public service delivery in district headquarters. PDNA preliminary \nestimates are $250 million in damages to government buildings.   \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nnominal taxes and duties on ADB-financed project expenditure.18 The government will provide \n$32  million  equivalent  to  cover  (i)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  (ii)  incremental \nadministration costs, and (iii) all other taxes and duties.

Cofinancing. Some development partners have expressed their interest to participate in \nthe proposed project, including through cofinancing.  Considering that the damages and losses \nare substantial, additional funds from cofinanciers could be utilized to expand the coverage of the \nproject components. ADB typically seeks Board approval for the administration of loan or grant \nfunds  from  cofinanciers  only  when  cofinancing  commitments  are  in  place.  Discussions  are \nunderway, but no firm commitment has been made at this short notice. In light of the need for \nexpediency  and  efficiency  in  the  response  to  post-disaster  recovery  and  rehabilitation, \nManagement requests Board approval for the administration of any cofinanced funds obtained \nfrom  development  partners  subsequent  to  the  date  of  Board  approval,  consistent  with  the \nobjective, purpose or scope of the project. The administration of such cofinanced funds will be \napproved by Management and reported to the Board in accordance with standard reporting \nprocedures. \n  \n                                                \n18 ADB financing includes part of tax and duties of about $5 million. The estimated expenditure is not excessive (2.5% \nof ADB financing amount) and will apply only to ADB-financed expenditures. The amount is within a reasonable \nthreshold identified during the country partnership strategy preparation process. Financing of the taxes and duties is \nmaterial and relevant to the success of the project and to simplify and expedite disbursement arrangements. Any \nincidental expenditures relating to bank charges, local transport, freight, and insurance are eligible for ADB financing. \n ", "6 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  An interministerial project steering committee, chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of \nFinance, will guide project implementation and review progress and results. It will meet at least \ntwice a year. The government is establishing a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to manage the \nreconstruction programs with high efficiency through focused, streamlined, and flexible decision \nmaking in budgetary, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation processes. The SPV will be \nthe executing agency for the project once established, and the Ministry of Finance will be the \ninterim executing agency. The project management unit will be established within the SPV. \n \n21.  The implementing agencies are: \n(i)  The Department of Education of the Ministry of Education for schools (outputs 1 \nand  4),19 supported  by  the  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Building \nConstruction of the Ministry of Urban Development.  \n(ii)  The Department of Local Infrastructure Development of the Ministry of Federal \nAffairs and Local Development and the Department of Roads of the Ministry of \nPhysical Infrastructure Transport for rural roads and strategic roads, respectively \n(outputs 2 and 4).  \n(iii)  The Department of Urban Development and Building Construction of the Ministry \nof Urban Development for district headquarters buildings (outputs 3 and 4).  \n \n22.  A project implementation unit will be established in each implementing agency. At the \ndistrict level, each implementing agency will have district implementation units to supervise and \nimplement the approved subproject activities.  \n \n23.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in the PAM \n(footnote 17). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2015\u2013September 2018 \nThe project will be implemented over 3 years. The extended \nimplementation period beyond the EAL norm of 2 years is justified \ngiven the extensive nature of the disaster, low capacity, the need for \nbuilding back better, and Nepal\u2019s historically low disbursement record. \nEstimated completion date/loan  30 September 2018/31 March 2019 \nclosing date \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee comprised of the secretary, Ministry of \nFinance (chair);a secretary, Ministry of Urban Development; secretary, \nMinistry of Education; secretary, Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local \nDevelopment; secretary, Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and \nTransport; representative, National Planning Commission; and project \ndirectors (four implementing agencies) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance (for interim period) \n(iii)  Key implementing  Department of Education, Department of Local Infrastructure \nagencies  Development, Department of Roads, Department of Urban \nDevelopment and Building Construction \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Four implementing agencies; about 40 full-time staff proposed \nProcurement  ICB  2 contracts  $15.0 million \nNCB  Numerous contracts  $157.5 million \n                                                \n19 Output 4 includes consultancies to support all four implementing agencies; and outputs 1 to 3.  \n ", "7 \nAspects   Arrangements \n  Shopping  Numerous contracts  $6.5 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  1,683 person-months  $6.3 million \nICS  930 person-months  $2.2 million \nCQS  90 person-months  $0.3 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  For eligible expenditures incurred for consulting services; procurement \nadvance contracting  of goods, services, and civil works; and project administration after 25 \nApril 2015, and up to a maximum of 30% of the loan amount. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nADB. \nADB =  Asian  Development Bank,  CQS=consultants\u2019  qualification selection,  EAL =  emergency  assistance loan, \nICB = international competitive bidding, ICS = individual consultant selection, NCB = national competitive bidding, \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection,  \na \nThe special purpose vehicle chief executive officer will chair the committee once the special purpose vehicle is \nestablished. \nSources: Asian Development Bank; Government of Nepal. \n \n24.  Procurement.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  works,  and  recruitment  of  consulting \nservices, will be carried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient procedures \npermitted under ADB\u2019s Disaster Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time), and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n25.  Based on the procurement capacity assessments of the executing agency (interim) and \nimplementing  agencies,  (i)  centralized  procurement  will  be  used;  and  (ii)  thresholds  for  the \nprocurement of works, goods, and consulting services have been agreed with the government. \nADB\u2019s prior review and post review have been set forth in the procurement plan. Domestic \npreference will be provided to the international competitive bidding contracts for goods and works \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The PAM\u2019s procurement section details the \nthresholds and processes to be followed. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n26.  To  support  the  new  SPV  (under  establishment)  and  the  implementing  agencies  in \nimplementing the project on time and efficiently and to build their capacities, the government has \nrequested ADB to provide TA grant support for earthquake reconstruction. The TA will have three \noutputs: (i) institutional capacity strengthened, (ii) effective monitoring and evaluation established, \nand (iii) school safety enhanced. The first output will provide capacity building support to the \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies for speedy and smooth implementation, particularly \nwith  respect  to  procurement,  contract  management,  quality  control,  and  disbursement.  The \nsecond output will help establish monitoring and evaluation systems at central and district levels. \nThe  third  output  will  help  establish  design  standards,  type  designs,  disaster  awareness \ncurriculums, and training systems for masons.20 The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 which \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).21 \n \n                                                \n20  The TA will provide international consultants to bring international best practices on school safety design and to \nprovide quality assurance. This complements related activities in the loan.  \n21 Capacity development will also be supported by ongoing TA for Enhancing Portfolio Performance, which provides \ntraining on a range of project implementation subjects by setting up the Capacity Development Resource Center \nbased on a capacity rating system and training calendars. ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Portfolio \nPerformance: Technical Assistance Report. Manila.  \n ", "8 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n27.  The final selection of subprojects is not complete but will be in accordance with the criteria \nand  approval  procedures  already  agreed  with  the government. These include  adherence to \nsafeguards requirements and technical viability. Implementing agencies will lead the screening of \npriority projects. The objective is to rebuild to a better standard. Climate risk screening, including \nnatural hazards caused by climate events, was conducted. Results will be considered in the \ntechnical design of schools, roads, and bridges as appropriate. Consultants under ongoing roads \nprojects will be used to prepare designs.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n28.  Given  the  focus  on  severely  affected  zones,  the  project  is  likely  to  bring  significant \nincremental benefits economy-wide and to the affected population. Financial and economic due \ndiligence will be conducted after Board approval and once the individual projects have been \nidentified due to the difficulty in acquiring information in the short processing time needed for \nemergency response. All of the identified subprojects will be subject to economic analysis as per \nADB guidelines to ensure that the selected projects are economically viable. \n \n29.  Overall, the multiplier effect of large-scale, productivity-enhancing capital investments will \nbe much larger in the post-quake rehabilitation and reconstruction phase given that the aggregate \ndemand is suppressed and private sector investment has slowed down. Furthermore, proposed \ncapital investments through the project will increase returns to private investment over time, \nincrease per capita income, create local jobs, and boost local as well as regional economic \nactivities.  \n \n30.  Project outputs are public service goods with no cost recovery, and hence no financial \nviability assessment is required. Roads, schools, and buildings constructed under the project will \nbe maintained from relevant ministries\u2019 ongoing recurrent budget. Government commitment will \nbe obtained as a loan assurance. As project outputs are built back with features to enhance \nresilience, there would be less strain on the operations and maintenance budget.  \nC.  Governance  \n31.  An  updated  financial  management  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies was conducted for the purposes of the emergency project. The overall fiduciary risk, \nalthough substantial, remains manageable as a result of the additional measures provided in the \nPAM,  notably  the  targeted  TA  and  support  to  the  executing  agency.  All  four  implementing \nagencies have satisfactory experience in implementing ADB-funded projects. A key risk mitigating \nmeasure  is  to  ensure  a  dedicated  full-time  qualified  accountant  forms  part  of  the  project \nmanagement unit and program implementation units.   \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, Ministry of Finance, and all implementing agencies. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The project is expected to help restore classes in permanent, safe buildings for at least \n350,000 students in project communities, and citizen services in at least 10 of the most affected \ndistricts. Beneficiaries include households headed by females and those below the poverty line. \n ", "9 \nThe  project  will  help  restore  and  improve  (i)  school  facilities,  in  consultation  with  affected \ncommunities; (ii) access to public and social service facilities; and (iii) connectivity toward the \nrecovery  of  business,  livelihoods,  and  commercial  activities.  It  will  also  act  on  social  risks \nassociated with disasters, such as sexually transmitted infections, human trafficking (child, girls, \nwomen trafficking), and child labor. \n \n34.  Gender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender equality \nand  social  inclusion  (GESI)  action  plan  has  been  prepared.  22  To  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of the GESI Action Plan, the project will hire four GESI experts\u2014one based in \nKathmandu and three in the affected districts. These GESI experts will ensure that women and \ndisadvantaged groups are  part  of the rehabilitation  and recovery  processes,  including  labor \nopportunities, and will receive equitable pay for work of equal value. GESI-related results will be \nreported using sex-, caste-, and ethnicity-disaggregated data.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  Environment. The project is classified category B for environment. Subproject selection \ncriteria were formulated to avoid significant adverse environmental impacts. An environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government laws and regulations. The draft EARF has \nbeen  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  Implementation  arrangements  build  on  the  implementing \nagencies\u2019 experience from other ADB-financed projects, and adequate capacity is ensured to \nmanage environmental impacts through consultant support. Initial environmental examinations \nand environmental management plans will be prepared consistent with the EARF, and will be \nincorporated in bidding documents and contract documents to be implemented by contractors \nand monitored by the implementing agencies. Environmental reporting to the Nepal Resident \nMission will be done on a semiannual basis. \n \n36.  Social. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for \nindigenous  peoples.  Subproject  selection  criteria  were  formulated  to  avoid  land  acquisition, \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts, and social risks. A resettlement framework has been prepared \nand disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and government \nlaws and regulations, to guide planning studies and detailed designs of subprojects. The project \nensures that the implementing agencies have adequate capacity to prepare resettlement plans \nthrough consultant support. Consultations will be undertaken with stakeholders in project areas \nduring implementation. Resettlement implementation reporting to the resident mission will be \ndone on a semiannual basis. \n  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures   \n37.  The overall risk is medium while the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. The main risks relate to the ongoing political impasse and capacity issues. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.23  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProlonged political  Development partners continue dialogue with the government and key \n                                                \n22  Gender Action Plan: Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \ntransition  stakeholders to ensure that the rehabilitation and reconstruction program can \nmove forward in light of the ongoing political processes. Establishment of a \nseparate special purpose vehicle with financial and approval powers for \nexecution of the rehabilitation and reconstruction program will further mitigate \nthe risk of slow implementation.  \nPoor financial  The executing agency will set up a unified web-based project monitoring and \nmanagement  management information system in the PMU, PIUs, and district counterparts to \ncompliance  monitor implementation, fund flows, accounting, audit and reporting functions. \nDedicated accounting staff shall be part of the PMU. \nLow implementing  Extensive support from ADB consultants will be provided for procurement, \ncapacity  financial management, disbursement, monitoring and safeguard policies, and \n(government)  procedures. Ongoing technical assistance will also be used to this end. \nLow implementing  Contractors will be trained in the preparation and submission of responsive bids, \ncapacity (contractors)  and compliance with contractual conditions. The design, construction, and \nsupervision consultant will be engaged for close monitoring and support on \ncontractual compliance. To ensure contractors\u2019 cash flow, an advance of 20% \nwill be provided against a reputable bank guarantee.  \nLack of sustainability   The assets will be transferred to the respective line ministry and/or the \ncommunity to ensure utilization and maintenance. Under the existing sector \npartnerships with ADB, line ministries have plans to pursue O&M sustainability \n(through sound asset inventories, performance monitoring, O&M planning, and \nbudget allocation for execution). Dialogue will be continued in this direction.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, O&M = operation and maintenance, PIU= project implementation unit, PMU = project \nmanagement unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n38.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual and loan documents. \n \n39.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \nforth in the loan agreement.  \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions \nof Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR143,212,000 to Nepal for the \nEarthquake Emergency Assistance Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum; for a term of 40 years, \nincluding a grace period of 10 years; with repayment of principal at 2% per annum \nfor the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% per annum thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of loans or grants in accordance with the proposal set \nforth in paragraph 19 of this report, to be provided by any development partner or \ncofinancier after the date of Board approval of the project. \n \nBindu N.
