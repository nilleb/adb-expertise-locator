The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment \nreport  was  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nBoard of Directors on 12 July 2006. \n \nThe  Colombo  Port  Expansion  Project  provides  for  dredging  and \nbreakwater  construction  sufficient \nthree \nterminals,  which  will  be  constructed  sequentially.  The  Project \nincludes  the  establishment  of  a  new  marine  operations  center, \nrelocation  of  a  submarine  oil  pipeline,  provision  of  navigational \naids,  and  construction  of  shore  utilities.  The  Project  will  be \ndeveloped  on  a  public-private  partnership  basis.  The  harbor \ninfrastructure  works,  i.e.,  dredging,  breakwater  construction,  and \nother works, will be implemented by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority \n(SLPA).  The  first  two  terminals  will  be  operational    in  2010  and \n2015  respectively  and  constructed  by  operators  chosen  through \nopen  competitive  bidding  under  a  build-operate-transfer \nconcession  agreement.  The  first  concession  bid  will  be  for  one \nterminal.  \n \nColombo Port is the natural transshipment hub port for the South \nAsian region. However, in recent years Colombo Port lost market \nshare  of \nthe \nfundamentals  of  the  market  changed  and  Colombo  Port  did  not \nadapt. Colombo Port cannot offer the additional operating capacity \nrequired  to  compete  for  the  Indian  subcontinent  transshipment \nmarket  or  the  depth  required  to  berth  the  latest  generation \ncontainer  ships.  Colombo  Port  will  have  to  develop  additional \ncontainer berths with the required depth to address these capacity \nand  depth \nto  remain  a \ntransshipment hub port.  \n \n\ntransshipment  market  because \n\ninfrastructure  constraints \n\nthe  regional \n\nis \n\nif \n\nit \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  \n \n\nin \n\nThe  Project  will  promote  economic  growth  by  improving  Sri \nLanka\u2019s  competitiveness \nthe  ports  sector  by  expanding \nColombo  Port  using  public-private  partnerships;  and  facilitate \neconomic  growth  by  enhancing  national  competitiveness  in \ninternational  trade  via  lower  transport  costs  and  faster  delivery \ntimes.  Container-handling  capacity  will  be  increased  from  3.3 \nmillion  twenty-foot  equivalent  units  (TEU)  in  2006,  to  5.7  million \nTEU  by  2010,  8.1  million  TEU  by  2015  and  10.5  million  TEU  by \n2024.  The  additional  capacity  will  enable  Colombo  Port  to \nincrease its Indian subcontinent transshipment market share from \n23%  in  2002  to  30%  by  2011.  Sri  Lanka  will  thus  be  able  to \ngenerate  additional  income  from  transshipment.  Foreign  direct \ninvestment in the ports sector will increase by approximately $800 \nmillion by 2024.  \n \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $781  million. \nThe  public  sector  component  is  estimated  at  $480  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $49.7 million.  \n \n\nTotal  \n($ million) \n \n300.0 \n180.0 \n\nTotal \n\n61.5 \n38.5 \n100.0 \n\n480.0 \n301.0 \n781.0 \n\nPercent \n \n38.5 \n23.0 \n\nSource \nPublic Sector Component \n  Asian Development Bank \n  Government \n \nSubtotal \nPrivate Sector Component \n \nSources: Feasibility study and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA loan of $300,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility.

The  project \ndirector will report to the Chairman, SLPA. The project director will \nhave  overall  responsibility  for  project  management  and  be \nresponsible  for  the  preparation  of  quarterly  and  annual  project \nmonitoring  and  progress  reports.  An \ninterministerial  project \nsteering committee chaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Ports and \nAviation  and  comprising \nfrom  concerned \ngovernment  agencies,  will  be  established  to  oversee  the  Project \nand  coordinate  issues  related  to  project  implementation.  The \nChairman, SLPA will report to the project steering committee on a \nregular basis. \n \nGoods, works, and related services to be financed by the loan will \nbe  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  contracts  will  be  procured \nthrough international competitive bidding.  \n \nfor \nInternational  and  national  consultants  will  be  required \nconstruction supervision. The consultants financed under the loan \nwill  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  single-source  selection  procedures \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2006, as amended from time to time). \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  Sri  Lankan  exporters  by  enhancing  their \ncompetitiveness  in  international  markets  through  lower  freight \ncosts  and  faster  delivery  times  for  time-sensitive  exports  e.g., \ntextiles,  which  account  for  52%  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  exports.  Lower \nfreight  costs  are  expected  to  result  in  annual  savings  of  $82 \nmillion  by  2015,  and  faster  delivery  times  will  create  annual \nsavings  of  $49  million  by  2015.  In  addition  transshipment  traffic \nwill  generate  direct  net  annual  income  to  terminal  operators \namounting to $77 million by 2015.  \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nrisk  has  been  mitigated  by \n\nAs  the  implementation  of  this  Project  will  be  on  a  public-private \npartnership  basis  with  the  public  sector  implementing  the  harbor \ninfrastructure  works  component  and \nthe  private  sector \nimplementing  the  terminal  component,  the  full  benefits  of  the \nProject are dependent on both components being implemented on \na  coordinated  basis.  Therefore,  the  major  risk  is  if  no  private \nsector  party  is  willing  to  take  up  the  terminal  component \nconcession.  This \nlinking \nimplementation  of  the  harbor  infrastructure  works  component  to \nthe  progress  of  selecting  a  successful  bidder  for  the  terminal \nconcession.  A  delay  in  the  consolidation  of  the  ceasefire  in  the \ncountry  may  also  have  some  impact  on  private  sector  interest. \nHowever, the private sector has been interested in Colombo Port \nas  indicated  by  the  implementation  of  the  South  Asia  Gateway \nTerminal project even before the ceasefire. The Government has \ndeclared Colombo Port a high-security zone and appointed the Sri \nLankan  Navy  as  the  designated  authority  for  port  security.  The \nnavy  has  drawn  up  comprehensive  security  plans  in  accordance \nwith  the  requirements  of  the  International  Ship  and  Port  Security \nConvention  of  the  International  Maritime  Organization  for  port \nsecurity and the special security considerations necessary for Sri \nLanka. Colombo Port is the first port in the South Asian region to \nhave  implemented  both  the  container  security  initiative  and  the \nmega port initiative.  \n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n \n\n\f \n\n2060a RM \n\nv\ni\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Colombo Port Expansion Project. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nSri Lanka\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the 1980s and 1990s averaged \nabout 5%, and increased to 6.1% in 2005. However poverty continues to be a major concern of \nthe  Government  as  22%  of  the  population  is  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  Government\u2019s \nobjective is to increase the rate of economic growth to around 8% per annum to generate the \nresources needed for sustained poverty reduction, achieve its social and economic goals, and \nreduce  regional  disparities.  Medium-term  prospects  hinge  on  Government  plans  to  foster \neconomic growth by significantly raising foreign direct investment as well as domestic public and \nprivate investment. No large infrastructure improvements have been made in the last 20 years, \nresulting in bottlenecks that are a heavy drag on the economy.1 An efficient port system is a key \nfactor  in  improving  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  and  attracting  investment.  It  can  also  be  a \nfactor in encouraging the establishment of other value-added industries since Colombo Port is \nideally situated to be the transshipment center for South Asia. The ports sector in Sri Lanka is \ndominated by Colombo Port. It is the only port equipped to handle container traffic and handles \n95% of Sri Lanka\u2019s total international trade. It also serves as a transshipment hub port for South \nAsia;  70%  of  Colombo\u2019s  container  volume  consists  of  transshipment  traffic  to  and  from  the \nIndian  subcontinent  (ISC).  The  volume  of  containers  handled  increased  from  200,000  twenty-\nfoot equivalent units (TEU) in 1985 to 1 million TEU in 1995, but the growth rate then tapered off \nand stagnated between 1997 and 2000 with an annual average of 1.7 million TEU. Growth then \nincreased,  and  in  2006  Colombo  Port  handled  3.08  million  TEU.  One  of  the  main  reasons  for \nthe stagnation and slow increase in growth is Colombo Port\u2019s lack of competitiveness with other \nmajor transshipment ports established to cater for ISC traffic.  \n \nColombo Port is owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), a statutory body under \n3. \nthe  Ministry  of  Ports  and  Aviation  (MPA).  The  current  SLPA  organization  structure  is  in \nAppendix  2.  SLPA  operates  the  three  container  facilities  at  the  port.  Jaya  Container  Terminal \n(JCT),  the  main  container  terminal,  has  a  capacity  of  2  million  TEU.  The  two  other  container \nfacilities are Unity Container Terminal with a capacity of 300,000 TEU and Bandaranaike Quay \nwith  a  potential  capacity  of  200,000  TEU.  In  addition,  a  private  sector  company,  South  Asia \nGateway Terminal (SAGT) Private Limited upgraded and now operates Queen Elizabeth Quay, \nwhich has a capacity of 1 million TEU. A sector analysis of Colombo Port is in Appendix 3.   \n \n\n1. \n\nContainer Traffic Volume  \n\n4. \nIn  2005,  container  traffic  volume  at  JCT  accounted  for  64%  of  the  total  Colombo  Port \ncontainer volume, and SAGT for 36%. JCT accounted for more than 90% of the SLPA revenues \nand  profits,  making  container  traffic  the  major  revenue  earner  for  SLPA.  About  70%  of \ncontainers handled in Colombo Port are transshipment containers of which 75% are for the ISC \nmarket and 25% for the West African market. Between 1998 and 2002, the transshipment share \nof Colombo Port for total ISC cargoes declined from 52% to 45% even as the ISC transshipment \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Asian Development Outlook 2006. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nmarket grew at 8% annually. The loss in market share accounted for the stagnation of overall \ncontainer  traffic  volume  at  Colombo  Port  during  this  period.  This  loss  resulted  from  a \ncombination  of  factors,  some  beyond  the  control  of  Colombo  Port,  while  others  are  internal \nfactors  including  lack  of  sufficient  capacity.  Enhancement  of  operational  efficiency  at  all  its \ncontainer  terminals  and  investment  in  port  infrastructure  is  urgently  needed  to  increase \nColombo Port\u2019s container-handling capacity and alleviate its depth infrastructure constraints to \nreverse  this  trend.  Remaining  a  transshipment  hub  port  will  not  only  bring  more  foreign \nexchange to the country, but will also develop supporting industries such as ship chandlery, ship \nrepair, and bunkering activities. \n \n\n5. \nDirect  calls  at  Indian  ports  started  around  1997,  when  traffic  volume  reached  the \nthreshold at which it became economic at Nhava Sheva port in India (until then India had been \nserved  by  feeders).  The  trend  of  increased  direct  calls  has  since  accelerated  as  a  result  of \nimprovements in port efficiency, which followed the construction of a private terminal at Nhava \nSheva in 1999. New ports started to compete for Colombo\u2019s transshipment traffic. Before 2000 \nthe competition came from two major ports: Dubai and Singapore; subsequently three additional \ncompetitors  emerged  i.e.  Salalah  in  Oman,  and  Port  Klang  and  Tanjung  Pelepas  both  in \nMalaysia. Internal factors affecting container traffic volume include the delay of construction of \nnew  capacity  until  2001,  resulting  in  congestion  during  1996\u20132000.  JCT  operation  had  no \nintraport  competition  until  2001  and  productivity  remained  below  that  of  the  main  competitors. \nColombo  Port  provided  no  flexibility  in  pricing  and  had  limited  ability  to  negotiate  prices  with \nshipping lines. This was a major disadvantage, as the competing ports such as Singapore and \nPort Klang were cutting prices to unusually low levels. In 2002, the period of stagnation ended, \nafter the introduction of new capacity in 2001 by the private operator\u2014SAGT. The introduction \nof  competition  between  the  terminals  promoted  an  overall  increase  in  efficiency.at  Colombo \nPort.  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOperational Performance \n\n6. \nThe overall container growth in Colombo Port increased by 13.3% in 2004 and 10.5% in \n2005. In the first 6 months of 2006, it increased by 18% compared with the same period in 2005. \nCrane productivity for mainline container vessels at JCT increased from 15.1 moves per crane \nper hour in 2001 to 23.4 in 2005. JCT and SAGT now have similar levels of crane productivity. \nAverage  service  time  for  container  ships  at  JCT  decreased  from  17.8  hours  in  2001  to  13.8 \nhours in 2005; and average turnaround time for container ships decreased from 23.1 hours in \n2001 to 16.0 hours in 2005. JCT has about 1,500 employees handling a total of 1.7 million TEU. \nSAGT  has  about  500  employees  handling  930,000  TEU.  As  a  comparison  to  world  best \npractice, Singapore Port handles 17 million TEU with only 5,700 employees.  \n \n \n \n7. \nSLPA  consistently  made  operating  profits  during  2001\u20132005:  SLRs5.26  billion  in  2001 \nand  SLRs7.4  billion  in  2005.  Earnings  after  tax  in  2005  were  SLRs10.1  billion.  Colombo  Port \naccounts  for  approximately  97%  of  SLPA\u2019s  income.  SLPA  accounting  is  done  using  accrual-\nbased  accounting  in  accordance  with  Sri  Lankan  accounting  standards,  which  are  identical  to \ninternational  accounting  standards.  SLPA  accounts  are  audited  by  the  Auditor  General  of  Sri \nLanka  and  then  presented  in  Parliament.  The  2005  summary  financial  statement  for  SLPA  is \nshown in Appendix 4.  \n \n\nFinancial Performance  \n\n3. \n\n\fB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\nColombo  Port  lost  market  share  of  the  ISC  transshipment  market  because  the \n8. \nfundamentals of the market changed and Colombo Port did not adapt to the change. Colombo \nPort  faces  increased  competition  from  other  transshipment  ports.  The  dynamics  of  the  size  of \ncontainer ships means that the trend is toward larger container ships. Use of larger ships in turn \nmeans  that  established  transshipment  ports  now  have  a  wider  hinterland  that  they  can \neffectively serve. Hence the use of larger containerships means that Colombo Port now has to \ncompete with established ports such as Singapore and new ports such as, Dubai, Port Klang, \nSalalah  and  Tanjung  Pelepas,  (para.  5)  for  the  ISC  transshipment  market.  These  ports  are \nowned  in  whole  or  in  part  by  established  port  operators  and  shipping  lines,  and  are  able  to \nprovide  higher  productivity  and  faster  ship  turnaround  times.  Thus  they  have  a  built-in \nadvantage when competing for the ISC market.2 Colombo Port\u2019s efficiency and locational edge \nin the ISC transshipment market has therefore eroded as new players in South-East Asia and \nthe  Gulf  region  have  used  more  modern  institutional  structures  and  equipment  to  reduce  ship \nwaiting and turnaround times.  \n \n9. \nColombo Port is not able to offer the additional operating capacity required to compete \nfor the ISC transshipment market. The total current transshipment market is 6 million TEU and \nis forecast to grow at 8% annually. The combined potential container capacity of all the facilities \nat Colombo Port is 4 million TEU. As 3.08 million TEU were handled in 2006, and as Sri Lanka\u2019s \nown  exports  and  imports  grow,  Colombo  Port  is  expected  to  reach  its  full  current  capacity  by \n2010.  It  will  thus  reach  its  limit  in  the  volume  of  transshipment  traffic  it  can  handle.  This  will \nmake the port unattractive to shipping lines that require guaranteed capacity before they decide \nto make a port a transshipment hub.  \n \nColombo Port has a depth of 15 meters (m). This means that it cannot berth the latest \n10. \ngeneration containerships, i.e., 9,000 TEU vessels; its competitors in Dubai, Singapore, Salalah, \nand Tanjung Pelepas can all berth 9,000 TEU vessels. Shipping economics mean that the trend \nis  toward  larger  container  vessels.  Major  shipping  lines  have  already  launched  11,000  TEU \nvessels for the Asia\u2013Europe route, and in the next 10 years major container lines could possibly \ndeploy vessels with 13,000 TEU carrying capacity. All hub ports therefore need to upgrade their \ninfrastructure to handle these larger vessels or see their competitive position eroded.   \n \nThe future performance of Colombo Port depends on how it addresses the institutional \n11. \nand infrastructure constraints that it faces to complement its excellent geographic location and \nto ensure that it remains a major transshipment hub port for the ISC region. This means that it \nhas to put into place measures to enhance its operational efficiency at all its container terminals, \nset  up  an  operating  environment  that  ensures  fair  competition  for  all  terminal  operators,  and \naddress  its  capacity  and  depth  infrastructure  constraints.  International  experience  in  the  ports \nsector  shows  that  the  most  appropriate  institutional  structure  for  port  efficiency  is  the  landlord \nport  model,  whereby  the  port  authority  is  responsible  for  the  common  facilities  while  terminal \noperations  are  carried  out  by  a  terminal  operating  company.  By  increasing  its  capacity  and \nefficiency, Colombo Port will remain a hub port, bring more foreign exchange to the country, and \ndevelop  supporting  industries  such  as  ship  chandlery,  ship  repair,  and  bunkering.  It  will  also \n\n                                                 \n2   PSA Corp, the Singapore container terminal operator operates Singapore Port.. Dubai is operated by Dubai Ports \nWorld, one of the largest port operators in the world. Hutchinson Port Holdings of Hong Kong, China, has an equity \nshare in Port Klang.

Being a transshipment hub will reduce shipping costs \nfor Sri Lanka\u2019s own exports and imports, and thus make the country a more competitive location \nfor foreign and domestic investment.  \n \n \n \n12.  Modern  development  of  Colombo  Port  started  in  1980  with  the  construction  of  the  first \nphase  of  JCT  using  funding  from  the  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund,  now  the  Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC). A series of JBIC loans through the 1980s and 1990s \nfunded enlargement of JCT to its present four berths. In 2000, JBIC provided a loan to upgrade \nJCT\u2019s  computer  systems.  JBIC  is  currently  providing  a  $124  million  loan  to  finance  the \nexpansion of Galle Port. The World Bank provided assistance to the ports sector under its Port \nEfficiency Project, which commenced in 1997. This funded studies into the legal, regulatory, and \nmanagement aspects of both the ports sector as a whole and Colombo Port in particular. This \nproject failed in 1999 due to lack of agreement between the World Bank and the Government on \nsector  restructuring.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  Sri  Lanka  ports  sector  includes  loan  and  equity \ninvestment in SAGT for private sector development and operation of the Queen Elizabeth Quay \nin Colombo Port.3 ADB also provided technical assistance in 1999 to assist the Government in \nexamining the feasibility of expanding Colombo Port.4  \n \n13. \nSubsequently, ADB provided a loan in 2001 to (i) address sector policy, and institutional \nand regulatory issues; and implement measures to improve the efficiency of the existing port, in \nparticular JCT; and (ii) carry out the preparatory work for the Colombo Port Expansion Project.5 \nThe main services consultant engaged for this project produced an action plan to increase JCT \nefficiency, a business plan analyzing the demand forecasts and economic and financial viability \nof  expanding  Colombo  Port,  and  a  detailed  engineering  report  on  the  technical  options \navailable.  These  were  reviewed  and  accepted  by  a  panel  of  experts  recruited  separately  as \nindividual  consultants  under  this  same  loan  to  assess  the  commercial,  operational,  and \ntechnical  viability  of  the  main  services  consultants\u2019  proposals.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \nmain services consultants require them to prepare detailed construction tender documents and \nbid concession documents, and provide technical and bid advisory services to the Government \nfor  the  Project.  A  summary  of  past  and  ongoing  external  assistance  to  the  ports  sector  in  Sri \nLanka is given in Appendix 5.  \n \n \n \n14. \nThe 2001 ADB loan included two significant policy covenants. The first covenant was for \nJCT to be transformed into a corporate entity wholly owned by the Government. The objective of \nthis  covenant  was  to  increase  overall  port  efficiency  through  increasing  JCT  efficiency  by \nmaking the landlord port model the dominant model in Colombo Port. However the Government \nhas not been able to corporatize JCT and thus has been unable to implement the landlord port \nmodel  in  Colombo  Port.  The  Government  instead  decided  to  increase  JCT  efficiency  through \n\nLessons Learned \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  1999.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Colombo Port Project. Manila (Loan  1689/7153-SRI, for $35.0 \nmillion [loan] and $7.4 million [equity investment], approved on 11 May).  \n\n4   ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Port of Colombo South \n\nHarbor Development. Manila (TA 3276-SRI, approved on 13 October for $1.46 million).  \n\n5   ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Colombo Port Efficiency and Expansion Project. Manila (Loan \n1841-SRI, for $10 million).  \n\n\fcompetition, i.e., using the existence of SAGT to spur greater JCT efficiency. This approach has \nsucceeded  and  the  relevant  efficiency  indicators  for  JCT  have  improved  since  2001.  Average \nturnaround  time  for  container  ships  improved  by  30%  from  23.1  hours  in  2001  to  16  hours  in \n2005;  average  waiting  time  per  ship  improved  by  77%  from  3.6  hours  in  2001  to  0.8  hours  in \n2005. The introduction of a private sector competitor\u2014SAGT\u2014has therefore helped to increase \noperational efficiency of the SLPA-run JCT until both JCT and SAGT now have similar levels of \noperational crane productivity at 23 moves per crane per hour. Although efficiency increase is a \nnecessary condition it is not a sufficient condition to result in an increase in ISC transshipment \nmarket  share.  Instead  increases  in  efficiency  need  to  be  supplemented  by  an  increase  in  the \navailable capacity to cater for changing market needs. This is shown by the fact that although \nJCT efficiency increased and the absolute volumes handled by Colombo Port increased since \n2003, it did not help to increase the overall market share of Colombo Port in the transshipment \nmarket. Colombo Port faces depth and capacity constraints that place it at a disadvantage in the \nmarket.  Hence  both  efficiency  levels  and  infrastructure  capacity  at  the  required  depths  at \nColombo  Port  need  to  be  further  increased.  As  the  capacity  of  JCT  and  SAGT  cannot  be \nincreased, a greenfield site needs to be developed as part of the Project so that Colombo Port \ncan  continue  to  offer  major  shipping  lines  guaranteed  capacity  and  be  able  to  take  the  large \ncontainer ships that will be introduced by  major shipping lines in the near future. Constructing \nadditional  terminals  will  also  help  to  increase  overall  port  efficiency  through  additional \ncompetition only if the landlord port model becomes the dominant model in Colombo Port.  \n \n15. \nAs  the  original  approach  to  make  the  landlord  port  model  the  dominant  model  through \ncorporatization  of  JCT  did  not  succeed,  ADB  carried  out  intensive  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment  to  use  the  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  approach  as  an  alternative  method \nallowing  the  landlord  port  model  to  become  the  dominant  model  in  Colombo  Port.  The \nGovernment  agreed  to  use  the  PPP  approach  for  future  container  terminals  in  Colombo  Port. \nCommon  facilities  such  as  capital  dredging  and  breakwater  construction  will  remain  a  public \nsector  responsibility,  while  terminal  operations  will  be  carried  out  by  terminal  concessionaires. \nThe Project will allow for three new container terminals to be developed, i.e., south, west, and \neast  terminals.  In  the  first  phase  only  the  south  terminal  will  be  developed.  The  prospective \nterminal operator will be a corporate entity selected through open competitive bidding to ensure \nthat  intraport  competition  between  the  different  terminals  is  enhanced  and  thus  improve  the \noverall  efficiency  of  Colombo  Port.  Open  competitive  bidding  will  also  be  used  for  the  second \nterminal to be built as part of the Project, tentatively in 2015. The third terminal to be developed \nin  2024  will  also  follow  the  PPP  modality.  This  Project  will  therefore  make  the  landlord  port \nmodel the dominant model in Colombo Port through using a PPP approach.  \n \n16. \nThe second significant policy covenant of the 2001 ADB loan (footnote 5) was to reform \nthe  regulatory  structure  for  the  ports  sector  through  legislation,  especially  to  curb  any \nanticompetitive  behavior  on  the  part  of  established  operators.  The  Government\u2019s  long-term \nobjective in this regard is to enact a Port Competition Act. Prior experience with both the World \nBank  and  the  ADB  assistance  indicate  that  changing  the  regulatory  structure  by  legislation \nneeds to be done in incremental steps with the agreement of all parties. Hence, in the interim, \nusing  a  regulation  by  contract  approach,  the  Government  through  a  Cabinet  decision  on  11 \nOctober 2006 approved the establishment of an advisory committee to consider any grievances \nor  complaints  that  current  and  future  container  terminal  operators  may  have  regarding  fair \ncompetition issues. The committee will be chaired by the Secretary, MPA and membership will \ninclude the person holding the post of Director General of the Public Utilities Commission. The \nGovernment  has  agreed  that  the  committee  will  be  operational  within  3  months  of  loan \neffectiveness.  The  proposed  terms  of  reference,  composition,  and  draft  procedures  for  the \ncommittee  are  given  in  Appendix  6.  Rules  and  procedures  of  the  committee  will  be  finalized \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nOpportunities \n\nwithin  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  Once  the  committee  is  operational,  all  existing  terminal \noperators will be informed of its role and reference to the advisory committee will be included in \nconcession agreements to be signed with future terminal operators.  \n \n \n \n17. \nEven  though  the  market  share  of  Colombo  Port  for  the  ISC  transshipment  market  has \ndeclined,  in  absolute  terms  the  volume  has  increased  and  Colombo  Port  has  the  potential  to \nfurther increase both its volume and its market share of transshipment traffic. Colombo Port has \nseveral  natural  advantages:  It  has  a  well-protected  deepwater  harbor  and  is  located  near  the \neast\u2013west  trunk  routes  between  the  Asia-Pacific,  Europe,  and  the  United  States  East  Coast \nregions. It is thus the closest transshipment port to the huge, rapidly expanding markets of the \nISC. For Europe-bound cargo for the east and south segments of the ISC, using Colombo Port \nas a hub port is more advantageous than using Southeast Asian ports because of the shorter \ndistance  to  Colombo  Port.  Extensive  market  studies  were  conducted  as  part  of  the  business \nplan  for  the  Project  taking  into  account  port  development  plans  in  competing  ports.  These \nstudies, which were validated by the independent panel of experts advising the Government on \nthe Project, show that if terminal operators at Colombo Port are able to offer high productivity, \nsufficiently large additional capacity, ability to take larger vessels, and ability to negotiate tariffs \nwithout  external  control,  a  revival  of  Colombo  Port\u2019s  share  of  regional  transshipment  traffic  is \nexpected\u2014from a 23% share of the ISC transshipment market in 2002 to 30% by 2011.  \n \n\n18. \nThe growth of the Sri Lankan domestic economy presents another business opportunity \nfor  Colombo  Port.  Domestic  container  volume  handled  by  Colombo  Port  has  been  a  few \npercentage  points  higher  than  the  GDP  growth  rate.  Domestic  container  traffic  is  projected  to \nrise by 9.5% annually to 2010 and account for approximately 30% of the total container traffic \nwith transshipment providing the balance.  \n\n5. \n\nADB Strategy \n\n \n \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s strategy for the ports sector is based on the fact that an efficient port system is a \nkey factor in improving a country\u2019s competitiveness and attracting investment. As Sri Lanka will \nnot  be  able  to  generate  sufficient  domestic  cargo  to  attract  mainline  vessels,  becoming  a \ntransshipment  hub  port  would  allow  Colombo  Port  to  attract  such  vessels.  As  they  are  more \neconomical they allow Sri Lanka\u2019s own imports and exports to obtain lower freight charges than \nwould  otherwise  be  possible  by  avoiding  the  need  to  use  feeder  vessels.  Enabling  Colombo \nPort to maintain its transshipment port status will also bring additional foreign exchange to the \ncountry. The larger volume of ships calling at Colombo Port because of its transshipment hub \nstatus  will  encourage  the  growth  of  ancillary  industries,  e.g.,  ship  chandlery  and  bunkering, \nwhich  will  increase  economic  activities  and  generate  employment  opportunities  that  otherwise \nwould not exist. Maintaining Colombo Port\u2019s transshipment hub port status will allow Sri Lanka \nto act as a distribution and logistics hub for the South Asian region, which if realized will again \ngenerate  economic  activities  and  employment  opportunities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  is  also  to \nencourage  PPP  in  the  ports  sector  as  part  of  efforts  to  implement  the  landlord  port  model  to \nincrease efficiency.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f6. \n\nGovernment Port Sector Policy \n\n \n \n20. \nThe  Government  policy  for  the  ports  sector  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Mahinda \nChintana national policy6, sets out the country\u2019s vision for the ports sector as follows: (i) develop \nthe  main  ports  of  the  country  to  facilitate  increasing  export  and  import  trade  associated  with \nrapid  economic  development  of  the  country  as  well  as  the  region  by  taking  advantage  of  the \nliberalization and globalization process, (ii) decongest Colombo Port by constructing South Port \nin  Colombo,  Galle  and  Hambantota  Ports,  (iii)  develop  medium-scale  ports  in  identified \nprovinces such as South, East, and North to divert increasing volumes of domestic bulk freight \ntransport  from  road  to  sea  transport;  (iv)  encourage  alternative  source  of  funding  for  new \ninvestment  in  port  related  infrastructure  development,  (vi)  operate  ports  as  commercial  entity \nwithout  Exchequer  support,  and  (vii)  encourage  public-private  partnership  investment  for  new \ninvestment  in  the  port  sector.  While  continuing  the  state  ownership  of  existing  ports,  the \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy  is  to  increase  efficiency  of  existing  ports,  operate  ports  as  commercial \nentity and establish container terminals as public  private partnership projects. This Project will \nbe the first transport PPP in Sri Lanka. ADB\u2019s proposed loan is in line with Government policy.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n21. \nThe Project will promote economic growth by improving Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness in \nthe  ports  sector  by  expanding  Colombo  Port\u2019s  capacity  using  PPP  to  maintain  its  status  as  a \nregional transshipment hub port. Container-handling capacity will be increased from 3.3 million \nTEU in 2006 to 5.7 million TEU by 2010, 8.1 million TEU by 2015 and 10.5 million TEU by 2024. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  economic  growth  by  enhancing  national  competitiveness  in \ninternational trade via lower costs and faster delivery times. Export container traffic handled by \nColombo  Port  is  expected  to  increase  by  9.5%  per  annum  starting  in  2011.  The  additional \ncapacity will enable Colombo Port to increase its ISC transshipment market share from 23% in \n2002  to  30%  by  2011.  Transshipment  volumes  handled  by  Colombo  Port  are  expected  to \nincrease by 8% per annum starting in 2011. Sri Lanka will thus be able to generate additional \nincome from transshipment. The direct payments generated by transshipment traffic alone are \nexpected to increase the contribution of the ports sector to GDP by an additional 0.1% by 2015, \nand attract foreign direct investment of approximately $800 million to the ports sector by 2024.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n22. \nThe Project will expand the container-handling capacity of Colombo Port by 7.2  million \nTEU in three increments of 2.4 million TEU each. The major project elements are dredging an \napproach  channel  and  inner  harbor  basin  west  of  the  existing  harbor,  and  constructing  a \nbreakwater  to  the  west  of  the  existing  harbor  sufficient  to  accommodate  three  new  terminals, \nwhich  will  be  constructed  sequentially.  In  addition  the  Project  includes  the  establishment  of  a \nnew marine operations center, relocation of an existing submarine oil pipeline near the entrance \nto  the  new  terminal,  provision  of  navigational  aids,  and  construction  of shore  utilities  including \nan  electrical  power  plant,  water  mains  and  storage  tanks  and  a  sewage  treatment  plant.  The \nProject  will  be  developed  on  a  PPP  basis.  The  terminals  will  be  constructed  by  operators \nchosen  through  open  competitive  bidding  under  a  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  concession \nagreement;  SLPA  will  carry  out  the  harbor  infrastructure  works,  i.e.,  dredging,  breakwater \n\n                                                 \n6 Ministry of Finance and Planning. 2006.

The concession bid for the first terminal will be carried \nout in the first half of 2007.  \n \n \n \n23. \nThe harbor infrastructure works component is designed to accommodate vessels with an \noverall  length  of  400  m,  beam  of  55  m,  and  draft  of  16  m.  It  will  be  created  by  constructing  a \nmajor new breakwater to the west of the existing harbor and a smaller secondary breakwater. \nThe harbor will be served by a new two-way channel with a depth of 20 m and width of 570 m. \nThe new breakwaters in the initial phase will enclose a basin area of 285 hectares (ha), which \nwill support three new terminals each with a quay length of 1,200 m and land area of 62 ha. The \nbasin will be dredged to 18 m with provision to deepen it to 23 m should a new generation of \ndeep-drafted  vessels  come  online.  The  depth  of  18m  is  sufficient  to  cater  for  11,000  TEU \nvessels.  The  existing  submarine  pipeline  to  the  main  crude  oil  single-point  mooring  will  be \nlowered where it crosses the new dredged areas.  \n \nPreliminary  studies  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  International \n24. \nNavigation  Association  (PIANC)  were  carried  out  to  size  the  channels.  The  outer  approach \nchannel has been sized for two-way traffic as it is common to both the existing harbor and the \nProject.  The  short  approach  to  the  existing  harbor  is  and  will  remain  for  one-way  traffic  only. \nModern  aids  to  navigation  will  be  installed  along  the  new  channels.  To  ensure  that  all  vessel \noperations  in  the  Project  and  the  existing  port  are  safely  and  efficiently  carried  out,  a  new \nmarine operations center is proposed near the entrance to the new terminals. This will include \nfacilities for berthing tugs and other harbor craft, a lookout station, and a control room for a new \nvessel traffic management system serving the whole port. In addition this component will include \nconstruction  of  utilities  such  as  an  electrical  power  plant,  water  main  and  storage  tanks,  and \nsewage treatment plant. ADB\u2019s loan will finance the construction of this component. A detailed \ndescription  of  the  harbor  infrastructure  works  component  and  cost  estimates  is  given  in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n \n \nThe first container terminal will have a planned capacity of 2.4 million TEU per annum. \n25. \nThe ship\u2013shore transfers are assumed to be handled by 12 rail-mounted gantry cranes and the \nyard operated by 40 rubber-tired gantry cranes. The area behind the berths will have a width of \n476 m comprising a quay apron of 71 m, a yard-stacking area of 325 m, a rear yard of 45 m, \nand common access road and utility corridor of 35 m. Although planned around the rubber-tired \ngantry cranes, the land area is sufficient to accommodate any yard handling method preferred \nby  the  concessionaire.  The  container  terminal  will  be  developed  by  the  private  sector  under \nBOT  concession  agreement.  The  winning  concessionaire  will  be  selected  using  open \ncompetitive  bidding.  Open  competitive  bidding  will  also  be  used  to  select  the  operator  for  the \nnext terminal. SLPA itself will not be allowed to bid but a corporate entity registered by the SLPA \nand/or  the  Government  under  the  Companies  Act  No.  72  of  1982  of  Sri  Lanka,  as  amended, \nmay  bid.  SLPA  equity  in  non-Sri  Lankan  Government  or  SLPA-owned  winning  concession \ncompanies will not exceed 15%.  \n \nC. \n\nContainer Terminal Component \n\nSpecial Features \n\n2. \n\nThe  Project  is  developed  as  a  PPP  with  the  public  sector  implementing  the  harbor \n26. \ninfrastructure  works  component,  while  the  private  sector  implements  the  container  terminal \ncomponent  in  line  with  the  provisions  of  the  SLPA  Act.  The  harbor  infrastructure  works \n\n\fcomponent is a prerequisite for development of the Project. It has high economic returns. The \ncontainer terminal component however will generate high financial returns and thus is being left \nto  the  private  sector  to  develop  and  operate  under  a  BOT  concession.  Operational  and \nmanagerial control will rest with the operator. The Project will generate opportunities for ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department as an equity partner and/or as a lender for the terminal \nconcession company.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n27. \nPhase  I  of  the  Project  involves  the  construction  of  the  harbor  infrastructure  works  and \none container terminal. The project investment cost for Phase I is $781 million, with the public \ninvestment component estimated at $480 million, including taxes and duties of $49.7 million and \na base cost of $331.2 million. The private investment component is estimated at $301 million. \nTable 1 provides a summary of the cost estimates and Appendix 7 detailed cost estimates. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\n \n\nA.

An interministerial project steering committee, \nchaired  by  the  MPA  secretary  and  consisting  of  representatives  from  concerned  government \nagencies,  including  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning,  External  Resources  Department  and \nNational Planning Department will be established to oversee, monitor, coordinate, and provide \nthe  necessary  policy  guidance  related  to  project  implementation.  This  committee  will  meet \nwhenever necessary but not less than once every six months. The Chairman, SLPA will report \nto the interministerial steering committee on a regular basis. The implementation arrangements \nare  shown  in  Appendix  8.  SLPA  as  an  institution  has  the  necessary  systems,  personnel, \naccounting  policies  and  procedures,  reporting  and  monitoring  mechanisms,  and  auditing \nprocedures  to  efficiently  carry  out  financial  management  for  the  Project.  A  financial \nmanagement  assessment  of  SLPA  is  provided  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix.  SLPA  has \nimplemented  major  foreign-aided  capital  projects  and  is  observed  to  have  the  capacity  to \nefficiently administer loans and implement projects. It has also implemented one ADB loan and \ntherefore is familiar with ADB procedures.  \n \n\n\f2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n31. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  48  months,  including  preconstruction  activities. \nThe scheduled completion date for the Project is October 2010. The harbor infrastructure works \ncomponent  will  be  completed  by  31  October  2010.  This  takes  into  account  advance \nprocurement  action  for harbor  infrastructure  works  construction.  The proposed  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n32. \nThe project director will be responsible for all procurement activities. All contracts will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  One  works  contract  will  cover  all  harbor  infrastructure  works,  i.e.,  dredging  and \nreclamation  works,  breakwater  construction,  construction  of  all  other  ancillary  civil  works,  and \nsupply  and  installation  of  navigational  aids,  which  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures with postqualification. Bidders will be given 90 days to prepare \nand submit bids. Indicative contract packages for the Project including consulting services are \nshown  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  10).  On  30  October  2006,  ADB  approved  advance \ncontracting  for  the  harbor  infrastructure  works.  The  Government  was  informed  that  ADB\u2019s \napproval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to subsequently approve the Project or \nto finance the procurement costs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsultant  selection \n\nInternational  and  national  consulting  services  will  assist  SLPA  in  implementing  the \n33. \nProject. The detailed design of the works is being prepared by the consultants with the Colombo \nPort Efficiency and Expansion Project (footnote 5). Under the proposed Project, consultants will \nbe required for construction supervision including monitoring of the environmental impacts of the \nworks.  The  consultants  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). The single contract \npackage  will  include  about  150  person-months  of  international  and  1,250  person-months  of \nnational consulting inputs. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix \n11.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  single-source  selection  procedures  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time).  \n \n34. \nthe  Project\u2019s  engineering  and \nimplementation requirements as breakwater design is a highly specialized technical aspect. The \nappointment  of  the  detailed  design  consultants  to  undertake  construction  supervision  was \nreviewed by the Maritime Structures and Port Engineering member of the panel of experts, and \nfound to be the most preferred option to minimize liability risks and disclaimers of responsibility, \nand  to  ensure  that  the  construction  is  executed  in  accordance  with  the  design  factors \nestablished  during  the  detailed  design  phase.  The  detailed  design  is  the  result  of  extensive \nengineering  work,  underwater  geotechnical  investigations  and  studies,  numerical  wave \nmodeling, physical wave modeling, current modeling, three-dimensional physical modeling, and \ntwo-dimensional  flume  testing  with  model  testing  of  the  breakwater  design.  Given  the  PPP \nnature of the Project, the issue of liability is particularly critical. Sufficient progress in the partial \nconstruction  of  the  breakwater  is  necessary  before  the  selected  private  sector  concessionaire \ncan  start  constructing  the  terminal.  Hence  if  delays  or  defects  in  the  breakwater  construction \ncause delays in the private sector\u2019s terminal construction schedule, the private sector party will \nhold SLPA liable and claim damages for the delay. Moreover, since the construction season for \nthe  breakwater  construction  is  limited  to  the  months  of  October\u2013May,  timely  progress  of  the \n\nis  especially  critical \n\nfor \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nbreakwater  construction  is  critical  to  enable  the  private  concessionaire  to  carry  out  terminal \nconstruction on schedule. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n35. \nADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government,  MPA,  and  SLPA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  are \nincluded  in  the  loan  agreements  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MPA; SLPA; and all contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  As  a  project-\nspecific  anticorruption  measure,  all  bid  awards  will  be  disclosed  on  SLPA\u2019s  website. \nAnticorruption assurances will be incorporated in the loan agreements.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n36. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2001, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government \nand  ADB.  For  works  and  consulting  services,  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  using  ADB\u2019s  direct \npayment  procedures  from  ADB  to  the  consultants  and  contractors  against  withdrawal \napplications submitted by SLPA to ADB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n37. \nSLPA  will  submit  detailed  progress  reports  on  a  quarterly  basis.  SLPA  will  maintain \nseparate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services financed from loan \nproceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for the Project, and local funds. \nThe  accounts  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  Consolidated \nproject  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by  recognized \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \nThe  project  director  will  coordinate  all  accounts  and  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  audit  and \naccounting requirements, which will be followed up in regular reviews by ADB.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n38.  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  through  SLPA,  will  develop  a \nproject  performance  management  system,  including  baseline  performance  monitoring  and \nsystematic project performance monitoring. SLPA will carry out surveys (i) at the start of project \nimplementation  to  establish  baseline  data,  (ii)  at  midterm  review,  (iii)  at  the  time  of  project \ncompletion,  and  (iv)  not  later  than  6  months  after  project  completion  to  evaluate  the  project \nbenefits.  Data  to  be  compiled  for  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  in  a \nformat  developed  in  consultation  with  ADB.  Key  indicators  will  be  proposed  by  SLPA  and \ndeveloped  in  consultation  with  ADB.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3 \nmonths  of  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  providing  detailed  evaluation  of  the  progress  of \nimplementation,  costs,  consultant  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  and  other  details \nas requested by ADB. \n \n\n\f9. \n\nProject Review \n\n39. \nA project inception mission will be fielded soon after loan effectiveness. Thereafter, ADB \nand  the  Government  will  conduct  regular  reviews  annually  or  more  frequently  as  required  for \neffective  project  implementation.  In  2009,  a  midterm  review  by  the  Government  and  ADB  will \nconsider the Project\u2019s progress and agree on any changes in scope or implementation required \nto  achieve  the  Project\u2019s  objectives.  SLPA  will  monitor  project  implementation  and  keep  ADB \ninformed of any significant deviations that may result in the schedule not being met. The project \ncompletion  report  should  be  prepared  within  3  months  after  the  physical  completion  of  the \nProject civil works component. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\nA. \n \n40. \nThe  Project  will  help  consolidate  the  position  of  Colombo  Port  as  a  transshipment  hub \nport for the South Asian region by providing sufficient container-handling capacity and sufficient \ndepth  for  the  latest  generation  of  mainline  vessels  to  call  at  Colombo  Port.  The  container-\nhandling  capacity  of  each  terminal  to  be  developed  is  2.4  million  TEU/year.  When  three \nterminals  are  fully  developed  they  will  provide  an  additional  capacity  of  7.2  million  TEU/year. \nMaintaining its status as a transshipment hub port will help enhance national competitiveness in \ninternational  trade  via  lower  costs  and  faster  delivery,  in  addition  to  generating  additional \nincome  from  transshipment.  Taking  into  account  SLPA\u2019s  strategy  to  provide  infrastructure \n(breakwaters, channels, etc.) that can accommodate three terminals, the economic and financial \nanalyses  are  based  on  the  scenario  that  three  terminals  will  be  sequentially  developed  as \nnecessary to meet forecasted demand.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n \n41. \nThe economic evaluation compares the economic benefits and costs of the Project from \nthe viewpoint of the national economy. The main consequence for the economy if the Project is \nnot  implemented  would  be  the  loss  of  the  frequent,  fast,  direct  shipping  services  used  by \nexporters  and  importers.  Without  investment  in  the  Project,  Colombo  Port  would  lose  its \ntransshipment  traffic;  and  if  the  port  no  longer  operates  as  a  transshipment  hub  port,  it  would \nsoon  lose  its  direct  calls  on  trunk-line  routes.  Local  traffic  is  not  high  enough  to  attract  direct \ncalls  by  trunk-line  ships.  Colombo  Port  would  eventually  become  a  feeder  port,  served  by  a \ncombination of feeder ships and mainline services with relatively long transit times for the ports \nwith lower traffic volumes. The consequences for Sri Lanka\u2019s current and future exports would \nbe serious. The Project will benefit Sri Lankan exporters by enhancing their competitiveness in \ninternational  markets  through  lower  freight  costs  and  faster  delivery  times  for  time-sensitive \nexports e.g., textiles, which account for 52% of Sri Lanka\u2019s exports. \n   \nThe main costs to the Sri Lankan economy of the reversion to a feeder port would be (i) \n42. \nadditional  costs  of  feeder  services  to  regional  hub  ports  such  as  Singapore,  to  connect  with \ntrunk  route  services  (at  least  20%  are  estimated  to  switch  to  feeders);  (ii)  longer  transit  times \nand  delays,  which  are  injurious  to  export  markets,  especially  for  textiles,  but  also  for  new \nexports that will emerge; (iii) loss of revenues to Sri Lankan terminals from transshipment; and \n(iv) loss of dues paid to SLPA by container vessels. Lower freight costs are expected to result in \nannual  savings  of  $82  million  by  2015,  and  faster  delivery  times  will  create  annual  savings  of \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n$49 million by 2015. In addition transshipment traffic will generate direct net annual income to \nterminal  operators  amounting  to  $77  million  by  2015.  The  benefits  of  the  Project  are  the \navoidance  of  these  costs  to  the  economy.  The  values  assigned  to  the  benefits  are  compared \nwith the total investment cost of $1.3 billion for the Project to 2034. The economic internal rate \nof  return  is  estimated  at  17.8%.  These  assumptions  do  not  include  the  value  to  be  placed  on \nfast,  direct  shipping  services  by  investors  considering  alternative  countries  as  locations  for \nsetting  up  new  manufacturing  or  distribution  centers.  It  also  does  not  include  loss  of \ninternational  investors,  who  will  include  frequent,  direct  shipping  services  on  their  checklist  of \npreconditions for locating in a country. Thus the economic analysis is conservative. Sensitivity \nand  risk  analyses  indicate  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  robust  under  most \nconditions. The full economic and financial analyses are given in Appendix 12.  \n \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return  \n\n2. \n \n43. \nThe  financial  analysis  assesses  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  harbor  infrastructure \nworks component. SLPA incurs the capital investment, and maintenance and repair costs of this \ncomponent.  SLPA\u2019s  income  stream  arising  from  royalties,  lease  cost,  port  entry  dues,  harbor \ntonnage dues, etc. was calculated using the forecasted demand for the Project at rates currently \nbeing  paid  by  SAGT,  the  existing  privately  operated  terminal  in  Colombo  Port.  The  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  approximately  11.5%,  which  exceeds  the  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital of 4.4%. The details are given in Appendix 12.  \n \n44. \nFinancial  analysis  for  the  first  terminal  operator  was  also  conducted  to  assess  the \nviability  of  private  sector  development  under  a  BOT  concession  (Appendix  12).  A  terminal \noperator incurs the capital investment cost of terminal construction and equipment and terminal \noperation  cost,  and  pays  concession  fees  to  SLPA,  while  earning  revenue  from  container \nhandling.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  approximately  16.3%,  which  is  in  line  with \ncomparable new terminal developments internationally.  \n \nC. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Social Dimensions \n\n \n \n45. \nThe  primary  area  of  influence  of  the  Project  includes  Colombo  City  and  the  Colombo \nMetropolitan Region (CMR), comprising Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts. CMR has an \nestimated population of 5.4 million; unemployment rates are lower than the rest of the country, \neven  though  it  has  a  relatively  large  unskilled  youth  labor  force.  In  Sri  Lanka,  poverty  is \nobserved to be greatest in the rural sector (20.8%), followed by the urban sector (6.2%), and the \nestate sector at 4.3%. Across the industry subsectors, the highest poverty is reported in mining \nand  quarrying  industries;  employment  in  quarrying  is  characterized  by  low  pay  as  well  as  its \ntemporary and irregular nature, making this one of the most impoverished industry groups in Sri \nLanka.  As  per  1996  data,  the  incidence  of  poverty  among  those  engaged  in  mining  and \nquarrying was 41.5%. The next highest incidence of poverty was in agriculture at 28.4%. As per \nDepartment of Census and Statistics (2004), the percentage of poor households living below the \nofficial poverty line7 was 5% for Colombo District, 9.2% for Gampaha, and 17.7% for Kalutara, \ncompared with 19.2% for Sri Lanka as a whole. Although the Western Province in which CMR is \nlocated records the lowest incidence of poverty in absolute numbers, it accounts for the largest \nproportion  of  the  total  poor.  A  closer  look  at the  poverty  profile  of  the  city  of  Colombo  reveals \n\n                                                 \n7   People  living  in  households  with  real  per  capita  monthly  total  consumption  expenditure  below  SLRs1,423  are \n\nconsidered poor (the official poverty line). \n\n\fabout  1,614  poor  urban  settlements  with  about  77,612  families.  The  urban  poor  of  Colombo \ninclude  those  engaged  in  informal  sector  activities  and  blue  collar  workers  of  the  ports, \nindustries,  railways,  etc.  They  are  mostly  concentrated  in  the  slums,  shanties,  and  low-cost \nhousing  in  the  northern  and  central  parts  of  the  city.  Lack  of  land  ownership,  poor  access  to \ndrinking water, poor sanitation facilities, and lack of a regular source of income are a few of the \nmain factors causing poverty.   \n \n46.  Major positive social impacts of the Project are anticipated through the creation of direct \nand  indirect  employment  opportunities  during  project  construction  and  operation.  Jobs  during \nconstruction  are  projected  to  total  1,950,  including  300  for  construction  of  the  breakwater  and \n550 for staged construction of each of the three terminals. During the operation phase, a total of \n3,870  permanent  jobs  are  estimated  to  be  created  after  the  breakwater  is  complete  and  the \nthree  terminals  are  commissioned.  Thus  the  additional  jobs  created  are  expected  to  be \nsignificant. Those who have the advantage of living in proximity to the Project will benefit most, \nas  they  will  access  the  majority  of  the  temporary  employment  related  to  construction  of  the \nbreakwater and three terminals. People who live close to the quarry sites, land-based transport \nroutes, and barge load-out points will also experience some of the direct impacts of the Project. \nThe  income  impact  of  quarrying  will  be  largely  attributed  to  contractors,  providers  of  related \nservices (such as transport), and workers. Workers engaged in quarrying-related activities have \ntraditionally come from unskilled and poor sectors of the community. According to the projected \nestimates for quarrying activities, the predicted opportunities of employment will vary from 4,000 \nto  12,000  per  year  depending  on  the  contractor\u2019s  method  of  production,  i.e.,  mechanized  or \ntraditional.  Benefits  will  also  result  from  increased  vessel  traffic  and  other  related  initiatives \noutside  the  immediate  scope  of  the  Project,  such  as  the  development  of  a  free  trade  zone. \nBenefits to import and export industries are likely to accrue in areas outside the project-affected \narea,  due  to  overall  improvements  in  the  national  economy  from  the  growth  in  shipping \noperations facilitated by the Project. Therefore the Project will provide a source of income and \nnew  employment  opportunities  in  a  wide  range  of  job  categories  including  unskilled  labor, \nparticularly  in  terminal  operations,  construction  work  at  the  project  and  quarrying  sites  for  the \nunemployed, low-income earners, and the impoverished. This will lead to poverty reduction. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n \n \n47. \nThe Project comprises construction of a new outer basin enclosed by a breakwater and \nserved  by  a  new  navigation  channel.  Material  dredged  from  the  channel  will  be  used  in \nreclamation  to  provide  new  container  berths  with  associated  infrastructure,  buildings,  and \noperation facilities. No land acquisition or negative resettlement impacts are associated with the \nProject.  Construction  and  operation  activities  will  extend  seaward  from  the  south  end  of  the \nexisting Colombo Port. Therefore, no additional land will be required by either the Government \nor the private sector. To link the existing port access road to the new harbor, three buildings will \nbe  demolished:  two  government  warehouses  and  one  SLPA  office.  The  warehouses  are \npresently not used and will not be rebuilt. The SLPA office building will be partially affected and \nthus will be partially demolished. The work space of employees will be accommodated in other \noffice  buildings  within  the  port  area,  and  thus  not  involve  construction  of  a  new  building.  The \nexisting port access road will be used for transportation of containers and other imported goods. \nNone  of  the  port  access  roads  will  be  widened  or  improved  and  thus  no  resettlement  will  be \nrequired. Furthermore, even after the development and operation of the Project, the transport of \ncontainers  and  other  imported  goods  within  the  port-related  activity  zone  will  not  displace  any \nbusiness  establishments  close  to  the  port.  With  regard  to  specific  effects  associated  with \nquarries,  the  quarry  location  will  be  identified  by  the  contractor  only  during  project \n\nResettlement  \n\n2. \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nimplementation  prior  to  the  construction  of  the  breakwater.  Thus  the  Government  will  have  to \nensure that any land acquisition and resettlement impact associated with quarrying of rocks will \nrequire  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  appropriate  mitigation  measures  in  compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact \n\n48. \nThe  Project  involves  the  dredging,  reclamation,  and  construction  of  breakwaters, \nterminals, and channels. All of these facilities are located within the SLPA area. The Project is \ncategorized  as  category  A  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003), \nand  the  Project is listed  as a  \u201cprescribed  project\u201d  according  to  the  National  Environmental  Act \nNo.  47  (1980)  as  amended.  Therefore  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nprepared.  Since  the  Project  is  located  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Coast  Conservation \nDepartment  (CCD)  and  according  to  the  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Coast  Conservation  Act  57  (1981), \nenvironmental approval and the permit for development activity were obtained from CCD. The \nEIA  was  approved  by  CCD  on  12  December  2005.  The  EIA  and  environmental  management \nplan (EMP), in principle, cover all the requirements set out in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines.  The  EIA  was  carried  out  from  January  2003  to  April  2005.  After  receiving  CCD \napproval of the EIA, the EMP and environmental monitoring plan were prepared in March 2006. \nThe summary EIA (SEIA) was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and disclosed to the public \nthrough ADB\u2019s website on 12 July 2006. \n \n49. \nThe EIA examined potential environmental impacts associated with the construction and \noperation  of  the  Project.  The  EIA  shows  that  environmental  impacts  will  mostly  relate  to \ndredging  and  reclamation  works.  The  impacts  include  (i)  increased  turbidity;  (ii)  geotechnical \nstability;  (iii)  siltation;  (iv)  change  in  current  pattern;  (v)  sediment  transport;  (vi)  change  in \nadjacent  beach;  (vii)  wave  disturbance;  (viii)  impacts  to  water,  noise,  and  air  quality;  and  (x) \nimpacts  to  marine  ecology  and  fisheries.  The  mitigation  measures  have  been  set  by  following \n\u201cmitigation through design\u201d and therefore the degree of impact could be minimized. Although the \nimpacts  are  predicted  to  be  insignificant,  continuous  monitoring  especially  during  construction \nwill  be  carried  out  to  avoid  unexpected  impacts  and  provide  remedial  measures  if  necessary. \nPublic  consultation  was  carried  out  with  fisher  communities  living  near  the  Modera  fishing \nharbor,  adjoining  SLPA  port  limits.  The  EIA  does  not  predict  any  impacts  to  the  livelihood  of \nfisherfolk; the modeling studies for physical impacts indicate that the construction works will not \naffect the livelihood of the fisherfolk living near the Modera fish harbor. However, monitoring is \nneeded to ensure that any unexpected impacts are redressed in a timely manner. The EMP and \nto  minimize  potential  adverse \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan  will  provide  guidance \nenvironmental impacts related to the Project and to enhance the positive impacts of the Project. \nThe  EMP  and  monitoring  plan  must  be  submitted  to  and  approved  by  CCD  prior  to \ncommencement  of  the  construction  work.  Adequate  funding  has  been  allocated  to  implement \nthese  plans.  The  EMP  and  monitoring  plan  emphasize  the  need  to  establish  a  sustainable \ninstitutional  mechanism  to  ensure  that  these  plans  are  properly  implemented.  The  PIU\u2019s \nenvironmental  engineering  and  coastal  engineering  sections,  as  well  as  the  environmental \nmonitoring committee will be responsible for implementing these plans.  \n \n50. \nOn  the  basis  of  the  analysis,  no  major  insurmountable  environmental  impacts  are \nassociated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  Project  with  the  assumption  that  the \nrecommendations  for  the  mitigation  measures  are  implemented.  Therefore,  environmental \nmonitoring  should  be  carried  out  to  ensure  that  the  EMP  is  implemented  and  any  unforeseen \nimpacts are managed and mitigated appropriately. \n \n\n\fE. \n\nRisks \n\n51. \nAs  implementation  of  this  Project  will  be  on  a  PPP  basis  with  the  public  sector \nimplementing  the  harbor  infrastructure  works  component  and  the  private  sector  implementing \nthe  terminal  component,  the  full  benefits  of  the  Project  are  dependent  on  both  components \nbeing implemented on a coordinated basis. The major risk is the lack of a private sector party \nwilling  to  take  up  the  terminal  component  concession.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  linking \nimplementation  of  the  harbor  infrastructure  works  component  to  the  progress  of  selecting  a \nsuccessful bidder for the terminal concession. The loan will only be effective upon completion of \nthe  evaluation  of  the  terminal  concession  bid  and  the  Government  issuing  an  invitation  for \nnegotiations to the successful bidder(s).  \n \nAnother risk arises from possible delays to the harbor infrastructure works construction \n52. \nprogram.  Since  completion  of  part  of  the  breakwater  will  be  necessary  before  the  terminal \nconcession  company  can  start  terminal  construction,  any  delay  in  the  construction  of  the \nbreakwater  may  give  rise  to  a  situation  where  the  terminal  concession  holder  could  claim \ncompensation from SLPA. This risk is mitigated by the fact that the construction schedule for the \nbreakwater  will  be  agreed  with  the  prospective  contractor  before  the  terminal  concession \nagreement  is  signed.  Hence  a  realistic  time  frame  for  the  breakwater  construction  can  be \nincluded  in  the  concession  agreement.  Delays  during  construction  will  be  mitigated  given  that \nthe  Government  has  agreed  that  the  International  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers (FIDIC) \nconditions  will  be  used  and  that  the  construction  supervision  consultant  will  be  designated  as \nthe \u201cEngineer\u201d in the contract to ensure that the consultant has sufficient authority to direct the \ncontractors.  Selection  of  the  detailed  design  consultant  as  the  construction  supervision \nconsultant  through  single-source  selection  is  an  additional  measure  to  mitigate  these  risks \nbecause the consultant will be familiar with the design and also avoid the issue of split liability \nbetween the detailed design and construction supervision consultants.  \n \nAside  from  project  risks,  delay  in  the  consolidation  of  the  ceasefire  in  the  country  may \n53. \nalso  have  a  significant  impact.  This  situation  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  Project  to  take \nmitigation measures. However the private sector has been interested in Colombo Port as shown \nby  implementation  of  the  SAGT  project  even  before  the  ceasefire.  The  Government  has \ndeclared  Colombo  Port  a  high-security  zone  and  appointed  the  Sri  Lankan  Navy  as  the \ndesignated authority for port security. The navy has drawn up comprehensive security plans in \naccordance with the requirements of the International Ship and Port Security Convention of the \nInternational  Maritime  Organization  for  port  security  and  the  special  security  considerations \nnecessary  for  Sri  Lanka.  An  assessment  of  the  Colombo  Port  security  system  found  that  port \naccess control is well-planned, coordinated and implemented. Colombo Port is the first port in \nthe  South  Asian  region  to  implement  both  the  container  security  initiative  and  mega  port \ninitiative.  There  is  also  excellent  military  protection  against  air,  land  and  sea  intrusions  into \nColombo Port. The security cover will be extended to cover the new facilities as well. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n54. \nThe Government will ensure that the advisory committee chaired by the Secretary, MPA, \nand including the person holding the post of Director General of the Public Utilities Commission \nas a member, is established and operational within 3 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nThe Government will ensure that concessionaires for at least the first two new terminals \n\nThe Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available to the \n55. \nProject  when  and  in  the  amounts  required  to  enable  project  agencies  to  discharge  their \nresponsibilities  under  the  Project;  and  that  counterpart  funds  will  be  increased  if  needed  to \ncover any shortfall of funds for the completion of the Project. \n \n56. \nunder the Project will be chosen by open competitive bidding processes.  \n \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  SLPA\u2019s  equity  share  in  the  terminal  concession \n57. \ncompanies will not exceed 15% of the entire issued capital of such concession company. This \nlimit  will  not  apply  in  the  case  of  a  corporate  entity  registered  by  the  SLPA  and/or  the \nGovernment  under  the  Companies  Act  No.  17  of  1982  of  Sri  Lanka,  as  amended,  for  the \npurposes of carrying out container terminal operations.  \n \n58. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  concession  agreements  with  all  terminal \nconcession companies operating under the Project include the provision that each concession \ncompany  will  follow  the  National  Environmental  Act  No.  47  of  1980  as  amended,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and ADB\u2019s Policy \non Indigenous People (1998) in constructing the terminal.  \n \n59.  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  (i)  project \ndirector is appointed in accordance with the Government\u2019s relevant procedures; (ii) PIU is fully \nstaffed and operational; and (iii) staff necessary for the environmental monitoring in the PIU as \nspecified in the SEIA, are recruited. \n \n60. \nLand  and  Resettlement.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nProject does not require any land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. The Government will \ncause SLPA to ensure that in case of change in project scope or any unanticipated resettlement \nimpacts  (due  to  quarrying  of  rocks,  widening  of  access  roads,  or  any  other  activity)  during \nproject  implementation,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  to  the  extent  not \ninconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  In  case  of \nunanticipated  resettlement  impacts  during  project  implementation,  the  Government  will  cause \nSLPA to submit a satisfactory Resettlement Plan to ADB for review prior to the award of harbor \ninfrastructure works contracts. Before any affected person is dispossessed or displaced from its \nassets, the Government will cause SLPA to ensure that they are consulted and compensated at \nreplacement  values  such  that  their  living  standards  are  not  adversely  affected,  in  accordance \nwith the Resettlement Plan.  \n \nEnvironment.  The  Government  will  cause  SLPA  to  ensure  that  the  Project  and  all \n61. \nproject facilities are developed, conducted, implemented, and maintained in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Environmental  Act  No.  47  of  1980,  as  amended,  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  In  case  of  any  discrepancies  between  the  Government\u2019s  laws, \nregulations, and/or procedures, and ADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) will \nprevail.  \n \n62. \nThe  Government  will  cause  SLPA  to  apply  the  environmental  mitigation  measures \nincluded  in  the  EIA  and  SEIA  report  for  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  as  necessary.  The \nGovernment will cause SLPA to monitor, review, and if necessary update the EMP prior to any \nworks  to  ensure  that  all  negative  environmental  impacts  related  to  the  works  are  mitigated \n\n\fproperly.  In  case  of  unanticipated  negative  environmental  impacts,  the  Government  will  cause \nSLPA  (i)  to  report  such  impacts  to  CCD  and  ADB,  and  (ii)  to  provide  remedial  mitigation \nmeasures to affected people in consultation with CCD and EMC.  \n \nThe  Government  will  cause  SLPA  to  conduct  regular  environmental  monitoring.  The \n63. \nmonitoring report should be submitted to ADB, environmental monitoring committee, and other \nrelevant agencies such as CCD and Central Environmental Authority every 6 months.   \n \nThe  Government  will  cause  SLPA  to  provide  the  contractors  and  concessionaires  with \n64. \nthe  EIA  report  and  the  SEIA  including  the  EMP,  and  ensure  that  contractors  and \nconcessionaires  implement  the  required  mitigation  measures  as  described  in  the  EMP  in  a \nsatisfactory manner. In addition, the Government will cause SLPA to ensure that the contractors \nand  concessionaires  report  implementation  of  the  EMP  on  a  regular  basis,  along  with  any \ndeviation from the EIA report.    \n \n65. \nSocial Development and Gender Issues. The Government will cause SLPA to ensure \nthat  all  works  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  laws;  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction \nand  maintenance  activities;  encourage  employment  of  the  poor,  particularly  women;  provide \nappropriate  facilities  for  women  in  construction  sites;  and  do  not  differentiate  wages  between \nmen  and  women  particularly  for  work  of  equal  value.  The  Government  will  cause  SLPA  to \nensure that works contracts include a requirement on the part of the contractors to conduct an \ninformation  and  education  campaign  on  communicable  diseases,  including  but  not  limited  to \nsexually  transmitted  diseases  and  HIV/AIDS,  for  construction  workers  as  a  part  of  the  health \nand  safety  program  at  campsites  during  the  construction  period.  The  works  contracts  will \ninclude  specific  clauses  on  these  undertakings,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  by \nSLPA during project implementation.  \n \n66.  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government,  through  SLPA,  will  develop  a \nproject  performance  management  system,  including  baseline  performance  monitoring  and \nsystematic  project  performance  monitoring.  The  Government  will  cause  SLPA  to  carry  out \nsurveys  (i)  at  the  start  of  project  implementation  to  establish  baseline  data,  (ii)  at  project \nmidterm  review,  (iii)  at  the  time  of  project  completion,  and  (iv)  not  later  than  6  months  after \nproject  completion,  to  evaluate  the  project  benefits.  Data  to  be  compiled  for  the  purpose  of \nproject performance and evaluation will be in a format developed in consultation with ADB. Key \nindicators will be proposed by SLPA and developed in consultation with ADB.  \n  \nConsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  good  governance, \n67. \naccountability,  and  transparency,  the  Government  will  ensure  and  will  cause  SLPA  to  ensure \nthat  the  project  funds  are  utilized  effectively  and  efficiently  to  implement  the  Project  and  to \nachieve the Project\u2019s objectives. The Government will cause SLPA to (i) disclose the bid awards \non SLPA\u2019s website; (ii) undertake necessary measures to create and sustain a corruption-free \nenvironment;  (iii)  ensure  that  the  Government\u2019s  Anticorruption  Law  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nAnticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  are  strictly  enforced  and  are  complied  with  during \nproject  implementation,  and  that  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  are \nincluded  in  all  bidding  documents  for  the  Project;  (iv)  facilitate  ADB\u2019s  exercise  of  its  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project;  (v)  conduct  periodic  inspections  on  the  project  contractor\u2019s \nactivities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; and (vi) ensure that contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  SLPA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  Government  will  cooperate  with  any \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f \n\n20 \n\n68. \n \n\n \n\naudit and investigation, and extend necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books \nand records, as well as engagement of independent auditors and experts that may be needed \nfor satisfactory completion of such audits and investigations.  \n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe Government will ensure that \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nfollowing an open competitive bidding process, SLPA has issued an invitation to \nthe  selected  terminal  operator(s)  prior  to  commencing  the  negotiations  for  the \nterminal BOT concession agreement; and \n\na subsidiary loan agreement is signed between the Government and SLPA, and \nsubmission  of  legal  opinion  on  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  the  Loan \nAgreement, and the Project Agreement in a form and substance satisfactory to \nADB is submitted by the Government and SLPA, respectively, to ADB. \n\nConditions for Harbor Infrastructure Works Implementation \n\n \nC. \n \n69. \nSLPA to ensure that an updated environmental approval from CCD is obtained. \n\nPrior  to  the  commencement  of  harbor  infrastructure  works,  the  Government  will  cause \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n70. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Colombo Port Expansion \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.35% per annum; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and \nProject Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \n     President \n\n \n \n \n02 February 2007\n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\n \nNational economic data \nand statistics \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nImprove Sri Lanka\u2019s \ncompetitiveness in the \nports sector using \npublic-private \npartnership \n \n\nOutcome \n(i) Reduce transport \ncosts for exports \n \n \n \n(ii) Increase \ntransshipment \ncontainer volume \nhandled by Colombo \nPort \n \n(iii) Increase container-\nhandling capacity of \nColombo Port  \n \n \n\nOutputs \n(i) Dredging, \nreclamation, and \nbreakwater construction \ncompleted  \n \n(ii) South terminal \nconstruction completed \n \n\n \nDirect contribution by \nports sector to GDP \nincreases by 0.1% by \n2015  \nForeign direct \ninvestment in ports \nsector increases by \napproximately $800 \nmillion by 2024 \n\n \nExport container traffic \nhandled by Colombo \nPort increases by 9.5% \nper annum starting in \n2011 \nTransshipment volumes \nhandled by Colombo \nPort increases by 8% \nper annum starting \n2011 \nContainer-handling \ncapacity increased from \n3.3 million TEU in 2006 \nto 5.7 million by 2010 \nand 8.1 million TEU by \n2015 \n \nBreakwater \nconstruction completed \nby June 2010 \nNavigational aids \ninstalled by June 2010  \nSouth terminal \nconstruction completed \nby October 2010  \n\n \nSLPA reports and \ninternational shipping \nstatistics reports \n\n \nSLPA reports and \nconsultant reports \n\nActivities with Milestones \n1.

The port basin covers 200 hectares and is dredged to depths of up to \n15 meters (m). Access to the harbor is provided on the western and northern sides. The entire \nperimeter of the harbor is occupied with berths, terminals, and vessel-related activities. The port \nis connected to the national rail network; however, virtually all cargo movements in and out of \nthe port are by road transport. Because of the physical constraints, any growth in the capacity of \nthe existing port is severely limited. \n \n2. \n \n\nThe majority of container traffic is handled at three container terminals: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nJaya Container Terminal (JCT) on the eastern side comprises four berths totaling \n1,292 m, the latest completed in 1996. Depths alongside range from 12 m to 15 \nm.  The  terminal  area  covers  45.5  hectares,  has  6  super-post  panamax  and  8 \npanamax gantry cranes, with capacities of 35.5 tons (t) to 41 t service weight limit \nto  serve  the  berths.  The  backup  area  varies  in  width  from  330  m  to  380  m \nforming  the  container  yard  with  capacity  of  9,800  ground  slots,  served  by  39 \nrubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) and 4 rail-mounted gantry cranes (RMGs). In \naddition, two feeder berths total 352 m with depths of 8 and 9 m. The terminal, \nwhich  is  owned  and  operated  by  the  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority  (SLPA),  is  fully \nself-contained  with  its  own  reefer  stacks,  offices,  workshops,  amenities,  and \nsubstations.  \n\nUnity  Container  Terminal  (UCT)  is  located  at  the  northern  end  of  the  harbor. \nOpened in 2004, it comprises two berths for feeder vessels of 340 m with depths \nalongside of 9 and 11 m, and is served by three panamax gantry cranes of 41 t \nservice  weight  limit.  Eight  RTGs  serve  two  stacking  areas  with  1,020  ground \nslots. SLPA owns and operates the terminal as a satellite terminal for JCT.  \n\nSouth  Asia  Gateway  Terminal  (SAGT)  located  inside  the  western  breakwater \nbecame  fully  operational  in  2003.  The  terminal  comprises  three  berths  totaling \n940  m,  all  dredged  to  a  depth  of  15  m  and  served  by  9  gantry  cranes  of  40  t \nservice weight limit. The backup area is 200 m wide and the terminal area covers \n22.2  hectares.  The  container  yard  is  served  by  28  RTGs  and  comprises  5,430 \nground slots. The terminal, which is owned by a private consortium of local and \nforeign parties, is fully self-contained. SLPA has 15% equity in SAGT. \n\n \nCurrently the majority of container operations are organized through the three terminals. \n3. \nPresent container throughput for the port as a whole exceeds 2.5 million twenty-foot equivalent \nunits (TEU) per annum and the maximum capacity that could be developed within the confines \nof  the  existing  harbor  after  taking  account  of  improvement  in  all  forms  of  productivity  is \nassessed at 3.7 million TEU per annum. Other cargo-handling facilities operated by SLPA within \nthe  harbor  include  a  tanker  berth,  cement  and  bulk  grain-handling  facilities,  quays  used  for \nvehicle imports, general cargo and military goods, and a passenger/cruise berth at the southern \nend of SAGT. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nInstitutional Environment and Regulatory Framework  \n\nThe Ministry of Ports and Aviation is responsible for the ports sector. SLPA is a statutory \n4. \ncorporation established under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act (1979) as the owner, operator, \nand sole supplier of marine and cargo-handling services at the country\u2019s ports. The SLPA Act \nendows the Minister of Ports and Aviation and SLPA with wide powers over the sector. The Act \nallows  SLPA  to  concession  out  terminal  operations.  SLPA  is  managed  by  a  board  comprising \neight appointees; the minister appoints the chairperson and five of the members.  \n\nC.  Container Traffic Trends \n\nColombo Port established its position as the dominant transshipment port for the Indian \n5. \nsubcontinent  by  the  mid  1990s;  its  success  was  attributable  to  several  natural  advantages:  (i) \nlocated  near  the  east\u2013west  trunk  routes  between  Asia-Pacific,  Europe,  and  the  United  States \nEast  Coast;  (ii)  the  closest  transshipment  port  to  the  huge,  rapidly  expanding  markets  of  the \nIndian  subcontinent;  and  (iii)  a  well-protected  deepwater  harbor.  With  these  advantages, \nColombo\u2019s container traffic rose from 0.6 million TEU in 1990 to 1.7 million TEU in 1997. After \n1997, traffic stagnated, remaining at 1.7 million TEU per annum until 2002.  \n \nThe  reasons  for  this,  were:  (i)  Direct  calls  at  Indian  ports  started  around  1997,  when \n6. \ntraffic volume reached the threshold at which they became economic at Nhava Sheva (previous \nto this India was served by feeders.) The trend to direct calls has since accelerated as a result \nof improvements in port efficiency that followed the construction of a private terminal at Nhava \nSheva  in  1999.  (ii)  New  ports  started  to  compete  for  Colombo\u2019s  transshipment  traffic.  Before \n2000,  Dubai  and  Singapore  were  the  primary  competitors;  now  Port  Klang  Salalah,  Tanjung \nPelepas  compete  for  this  business.  (iii)  Delay  of  the  construction  of  new  capacity  until  2001 \nresulted in congestion during 1996\u20132000. (iv) The operation at JCT had no intraport competition \nuntil  2001  and  productivity  remained  below  that  of  its  main  competitors.  (v)  No  flexibility  in \npricing  was  provided.  The  port\u2019s  limited  ability  to  negotiate  prices  with  shipping  lines  was  a \nmajor  disadvantage  as  competing  ports  such  as  Singapore  and  Port  Klang  cut  prices  to \nunusually low levels. (vi) The 2001 terrorist attack on the airport affected insurance rates.  \n \n7. \nThe period of stagnation came to an end in 2002. In 2001 new capacity was introduced \nat the privately operated SAGT. The introduction of competition between the terminals promoted \nan  increase  in  port  efficiency;  and  the  peace  process  was  revived  and  the  surcharge  on \ninsurance rates lifted. \n \n\nTable A3.1: Traffic Figures for Colombo Port \n\nYear \n\n1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \n\n1.36 \n\n1.69 \n\n1.71\n\n1.70\n\n1.73\n\n1.72\n\n1.76\n\n1.96\n\n2.24 \n\n2.46\n\n3.08\n\n29.2 \n\n24.5 \n\n1.5\n\n(0.5)\n\n1.6\n\n(0.6)\n\n2.3\n\n11.1\n\n14.3 \n\n9.8\n\n25.2\n\nTotal (TEU \nmillion ) \nAverage \nGrowth (%) \n\nTEU = twenty-foot equivalent units. \nSource: Sri Lanka Ports Authority (Note restows account for the balance of the traffic). \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\nThe overall container growth in Colombo Port increased by 13.3% in 2004 and 10.5% in \n8. \n2005. In the first 6 months of 2006, it increased by 18% compared with the same period in 2005.  \n\nCapacity Analysis \n\nD. \n \n9. \nAdditional capacity could be obtained by  converting the Bandaranaike Quay (BQ) from \ngeneral  cargo  to  a  container  feeder  berth.  Examination  of  operations  at  the  existing  terminals \nindicates  that  capacity  could  be  enhanced  by  measures  such  as  the  introduction  of  new \nequipment, expansion of yard areas, denser stacking, and reduced dwell time. The existing and \nmaximum enhanced capacity of these terminals is shown in Table A3.2.  \n \n\nTable A3.2 Existing and Potential Enhanced Capacity of Existing Terminals \n(in twenty-foot equivalent units [TEU]) \n\nTerminal \nJaya Container Terminal \nSouth Asia Gateway Terminal \nUnity Container Terminal \nBandaranaike Quay \nTotal \n \n\nPresent Capacity \n2,000,000 \n1,000,000 \n300,000 \n0 \n3,300,000 \n\nPotential Enhanced Capacity \n\n2,400,000 \n1,200,000 \n300,000 \n200,000 \n4,100,000 \n\nSource: Sri Lanka Ports Authority. \n \n10.  While  operational  enhancements  can  be  made  to  the  existing  terminals,  they  offer \ndiminishing returns.  The  area  of  water  in  the  existing  harbor  is  limited  and  maneuvering  more \nthan  one  ship  at  a  time  in  the  basin  is  difficult  and  dangerous.  The  capacity  of  the  existing \nharbor is governed by marine operations that limit movements by cargo vessels to 1 per hour, \nrather than the quay cranes or yard capacity. As a result, the practical capacity of the existing \nharbor is estimated to be 3.3 million TEU/year. This capacity is expected to be reached by 2010 \nand  additional  facilities  in  a  new  outer  harbor  will  be  required  before  this  figure  is  reached  if \ncongestion and delays are to be avoided. \n \nE. \n \n11. \nCrane productivity for mainline container vessels at JCT increased from 15.1 moves per \ncrane  per  hour  in  2001  to  23.4  in  2005.  JCT  and  SAGT  now  have  similar  crane  productivity. \nAverage  service  time  for  containerships  at  JCT  decreased  from  17.8  hours  in  2001  to  13.8 \nhours  in  2005,  and  average  turnaround  time  for  containerships  decreased  from  23.1  hours  in \n2001 to 16.0 hours in 2005. JCT has about 1,500 employees handling a total of 1.7 million TEU. \nSAGT  has  about  500  employees  handling  930,000  TEU.  JCT  has  taken  several  measures  to \nimprove  its  efficiency  and  labor  productivity.  In  2002,  an  incentive  scheme  was  introduced  to \nmotivate  workers.  This  was  followed  by  the  introduction  of  a  target  bonus  to  ensure  higher \nefficiency. The measures were successful in improving efficiency (Table A3.3). \n \n\nOperational Efficiency \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nTable A3.3: Efficiency Indicators for Jaya Container Terminal \n\n \nIndicators \n1.

Initiatives  to  improve  and  develop  capability  within  the  port  for  focused \naggressive  marketing  are  important  and  require  action  as  soon  as  possible.  All  levels  of \nmanagement and operations have a role in developing traffic and enabling the port to compete \ninternationally. SLPA should increasingly accept the role as landlord and focus on promoting the \nport as a whole. Detailed analysis of transshipment potential is required. A significant amount of \ndata  has  been  obtained  and  databases  developed  during  the  preparation  of  long-term  traffic \nforecasts. This data provides information for analysis, which is essential for preparing marketing \nplans. Development in competing ports must be closely monitored and market niches identified.  \n \nThe development of strategy is critical to business planning. It requires a continuous and \n13. \niterative  analysis  of  relevant  issues.  These  include  clear  identification  of  services  that  can  be \ncompetitively offered, tariff and pricing strategies to win trade, promotion of selected strategies \nthrough  strong  marketing  activity,  direct  engagement  of  target  clients,  and  finally  the \nmeasurement  and  response  to  marketing  initiatives.  Significant  volumes  of  Bay  of  Bengal \ncontainer  cargo  are  transshipped  through  Singapore  or  Port  Klang  for  Europe  and  the  East \nCoast of North America. .This is probably more expensive than transshipment at Colombo, and \nwill take longer. Colombo should investigate ways of supporting and encouraging more frequent \nand more regular feeder services, notably to Chittagong. To do this it should consider offering \nother special deals for this specific cargo. Such actions could initiate a swing back to Colombo. \nTrade  lanes  and  Indian  subcontinent  coasts  offer  opportunities,  however  they  are  not  sales \ntargets.  Target  customers  are  shipping  lines,  who  need  not  restrict  themselves  to  particular \nlocations. Colombo must therefore offer price and service packages designed to meet the needs \nof  particular  shipping  lines  in  the  context  of  the  full  range  of  container  shipping  services  they \nwish  to  offer  their  customers.  Colombo  offers  a  real  alternative  for  European  and  Far  Eastern \ncargoes.  The  port  is  a  national  asset,  which  should  promote  contacts  with  local  exporters, \nimporters, and development agencies by demonstrating to them how the port is able to assist \nthem.  The  growth  of  a  national  cargo  base  is  an  important  objective  and  direct  foreign \ninvestment in local industrial export-oriented business is to be encouraged. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\n2005 SUMMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR  \nSRI LANKA PORTS AUTHORITY \n\nSRI LANKA PORTS AUTHORITY \nCOMBINED INCOME STATEMENT \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2005 \n \n\n \n\nDescription \n\nOperations Revenue from Port Activities \nOther Revenue from Port Activities \nTotal Revenue \nOperations Expenses \nRepair and Maintenance Expenses \nAdministration Expenses \n  \nOperating Profit \nInterest on Government Loans \nVoluntary Retirement Scheme Expenses \nProfit before Foreign Exchange Gain/(Loss) \nForeign Exchange Gain/(Loss) \nProfit before Tax and after Foreign Exchange Gain/(Loss) \nSpecial Levy \nLess: Income Tax, Deemed Dividend Tax, and Social Responsibility Levy \nNet Profit (Loss) before Extraordinary Items and after Tax \nLess: Extraordinary Items: Tsunami Provision \nNet Profit (Loss) after Extraordinary Items and after Tax \nCumulative Profit (Loss) B/F \nRetained Profit and Loss \nAmount Transferred to Loan Redemption Reserve \nBalance Profit/Loss C/F \n\n( ) = negative. \nSLPA = Sri Lanka Ports Authority. \nSource: Sri Lanka Ports Authority \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSLPA \n\n 2005  \n SLRs  \n18,246,333,789  \n2,303,093,940  \n20,549,427,729  \n(6,670,347,616) \n(2,109,995,895) \n(4,403,022,377) \n(13,183,365,888) \n7,366,061,841  \n(1,186,010,675) \n  \n6,180,051,166  \n7,059,437,549  \n13,239,488,715  \n(115,000,000) \n (3,050,742,665) \n10,073,746,050  \n(1,820,521) \n10,071,925,530  \n(6,646,423,206) \n3,425,502,323  \n(3,425,502,323) \n (0)  \n\n 2004  \nSLRs  \n15,805,541,899 \n2,055,349,142 \n17,860,891,041 \n(5,054,347,809) \n(1,384,200,444) \n(4,672,414,643) \n(11,110,962,896) \n6,749,928,145 \n(1,356,211,293) \n(848,873) \n5,392,867,979 \n (5,665,517,002) \n(272,649,022) \n (95,000,000) \n(2,700,517,736) \n(3,068,166,758) \n(162,146,782) \n(3,230,313,541) \n(3,416,109,665) \n(6,646,423,206) \n  \n(6,646,423,206) \n\nNote \n\n1.1.2 \n1.3 \n  \n2.1 \n2.2 \n2.3 \n  \n  \n2.4 \n2.5 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n2.6 \n  \n2.7 \n  \n2.8 \n  \n  \n  \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO SRI LANKA PORTS AUTHORITY  \n1974\u20132006 \n \n\n \n \nProject \n\nAmount \n($ million \nequivalent) \n10.00 \n\n \nYear of \nApproval \n2001 \n\n28 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n \nSource \nADB \n \n \nJapan \n(JBIC) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nColombo Port Efficiency and Expansion Project \n\n \nSL-P4: Port of Colombo Expansion  \nSL-P7: Port of Colombo Expansion (II)  \nSL-P8: Port of Colombo Expansion (III)  \nSL-P12: Port of Colombo Expansion (IV) \nSL-P23: Port of Colombo Extension (I) \nSL-P27: Port of Colombo Extension (II) \nSL-P30: Port of Colombo Extension (III) \nSL-P33: Port of Colombo Extension (IV) \nSL-P41: Port of Colombo North Pier Development  \nSL-P46: Port of Colombo North Pier Development \n(II) \nSL-P67: Urgent Upgrading of Colombo Port \nSL-P85: Galle Port Development  \n \n\n \n35.90 \n28.30 \n10.24 \n14.11 \n40.15 \n78.41 \n158.25 \n74.18 \n56.72 \n58.92 \n \n18.59 \n130.00 \n \n35.00 \n \n0.10 \n \n1.00 \n\n \n1980 \n1984 \n1985 \n1987 \n1990 \n1991 \n1992 \n1993 \n1994 \n1995 \n \n1999 \n2006       \n\n2003 \n \n2004 \n \n2005 \n \n\nDenmark \n \nNorway \n \nNetherlands \n\nOluvil Port Development  \n \nAutomation of Port of Galle \n \nRefloating of Dredger at Port of Galle \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, SL = Sri Lanka.  \nNote: Applied exchange rate: $1 = SLRs = 100, monthly rates published by Bank of Japan. \nSource: Sri Lanka Ports Authority  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n29 \n\nPROPOSED TERMS OF REFERENCE  \nFOR THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PORT COMPETITION \n\n \n1. \nAs  a  prelude  to  the  enactment  of  a  full-fledged  Port  Competition  Act,  the  Government \nhas  agreed  to  establish  an  advisory  committee1 to  enhance  the  operating  environment  for  the \nports sector and to ensure a competitive environment for terminal operators. The committee will \nhave  an  advisory  role  to  redress  grievances  of  port  operators  related  to  unfair  competition  to \nensure  a  healthy  competitive  environment  for  terminal  operators  and  promote  intra-port \ncompetition when two or more different terminal operators within the same port compete for the \nsame  markets.  The  committee  will  advise  the  Minister  of  Ports  and  Aviation  on  actions  to  be \ntaken in case of anticompetitive behavior in port-related activities.  \n \nComposition.  The  committee  will  be  established  under  the  Ministry  of  Ports  and \n2. \nAviation  (MPA),  and  be  chaired  by  the  Secretary,  MPA.  It  will  comprise  (i)  the  Secretary, \nMinistry of Trade and Commerce; (ii) a representative from the shipping and maritime transport \ncommunity that does not have any equity interest in any terminal operator; and (iii) the person \nholding  the  post  of  Director  General  of  the  Public  Utilities  Commission  of  Sri  Lanka.

The Colombo Port Expansion Project involves the development of a greenfield \nsite south of the existing port facilities. The Project is designed to accommodate vessels with an \noverall length of 400 meters (m), beam of 55 m and draft of 16 m. The Project will be created by \nconstructing a major new breakwater to the west of the existing harbor and a smaller secondary \nbreakwater.  The  harbor  will  be  laid  out  with  three  lengths  of  quay  forming  a  U-shaped  basin \nopen  to  the  north,  each  providing  a  1,200  m  long  container  terminal  giving  a  nominal  three \nberths of 400 m length and a depth alongside of 18 m. A main breakwater from Galbokka Point \nat the southwestern corner of the existing harbor runs westward to a water depth of about 18 m \nand then turns northward following the 18 m contour. A secondary breakwater combined with a \nsmall boat harbor extends from near the entrance to the existing harbor. Together they protect \nthe basin and quays from waves. \n \n2. \nChannel  and  Navigation.  The  Project  has  been  planned  so  that  it  can  be  safely \naccessed by all sizes of container vessels. In addition, improvements in the navigation approach \nchannel  to  the  existing  harbor  are  proposed.  The  phase  1  harbor  basin  will  be  dredged  to  a \ndepth of 18 m, and will include sufficient space for vessels to come to a halt and to turn. Vessels \nwill approach via a new two-way channel with a depth of 20 m and a minimum width of 570 m. \nThe approach to the existing main harbor entrance will be realigned to suit the new layout and \nto provide a better approach for an improved one-way transit of vessels. Preliminary studies in \naccordance with the recommendations of the International Navigation Association (PIANC) were \nconducted to size the channels. The outer approach channel has been sized for two-way traffic \nto accommodate the existing harbor and proposed changes. The short approach to the existing \nharbor  is  and  will  remain  for  one-way  traffic  only.  The  existing  submarine  pipeline to  the  main \ncrude oil single point mooring will be lowered where it crosses the new dredged areas. \n \n3. \n \n\nThe principal dimensions of the channels, basins and turning areas are \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nMain channel: width: 570 m with additional width on the inside of bends; depth: \n20 m below local datum; \nSecondary channel: width: 340 m (reducing to 250 m near the harbor entrance); \ndepth: 16 m below local datum; and \nSouth Harbor Basin; depth: 18 m below local datum with provision to deepen to \n23 m; turning circle: 600 m (1.5 times the length of the design ship). \n\n \n4. \nModern  navigation  aids  will  be  installed  along  the  new  channels.  To  ensure  that  all \nvessel operations in the project area and the existing port are safely and efficiently carried out, a \nnew  marine  operations  center  is  proposed  near  the  entrance  to  the  Project.  This  includes \nfacilities for berthing tugs and other harbor craft, a look-out station, and a control room for a new \nvessel traffic management system serving the whole port. \n \nAncillary  Facilities.  The  harbor  will  include  common  user  areas  for  each  terminal, \n5. \nlocated  outside  the  container  yard  for  increased  safety  and  security.  These  may  include  lorry \ngates  and  waiting  areas;  X-ray  and  scanning  facilities;  parking  for  equipment  and  cars;  and \nbuildings  for  terminal  offices,  equipment  maintenance  and  staff  amenities,  empty  container \nstorage, container repairs, and bonded areas. In addition, a number of facilities are required to \nprovide  basic  infrastructure  to  all  terminals.  Operated  by  or  on  behalf  of  Sri  Lanka  Ports \nAuthority (SLPA), these may include (i) an electrical power plant, water main and storage tanks, \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n31 \n\nand  sewage  treatment  plant,  all  located  at  the  southern  end  of  the  new  development;  (ii)  a \ncontainer lorry access road to the Project, approached via an upgraded port perimeter road that \nwill serve all the terminals; and (iii) an access road for personnel and other noncontainer traffic \nto the south of existing port gate No 1. SLPA is expected to benefit from a new office building \nnear  the  entrance  to  the  project  facilities  and  a  new  marine  operations  center  at  the  northern \nend of the eastern quay that will include sheltered berthing facilities for the flotilla serving South \nHarbor.  Port  users  and  Customs  will  also  be  accommodated  in  new  facilities  near  the  SLPA \noffice. \n \n6. \nfor the civil works component is estimated to be $480 million (Table A7). \n \n\nCost Estimates.

The  additional  reports \nwill be annexed to the final completion report. \n\nE. \n\nData, Local Services, Personnel, and Facilities to be provided by the Employer \n\nThe employer will be represented by a project implementation unit (PIU) set up within Sri \n12. \nLanka Ports Authority. Through the PIU the employer will provide liaison and coordination with \nother  Government  authorities  and  port  users,  and  assistance  with  application  for  residence \nvisas,  port  permits,  etc.  In  addition  the  harbour  master\u2019s  office  will  work  closely  with  the \nengineer to coordinate the works and port operations so that minimum interference is caused to \nthe  ongoing  operations.  The  employer  will  make  available  to  the  consultant  the  following \nfacilities free of charge throughout the period of the services: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ncopies  of  all  reports  prepared  by  the  design  consultant  and  all  other  relevant \nproject data; \nall  other  relevant  data  and \nnotifications and orders for the completion of the assignment; \nfully  equipped,  furnished,  and  serviced  site  offices  provided  through  the \nconstruction contract; and \nfour site vehicles, two saloon cars, and two minibuses for the exclusive use of the \nsite staff provided through the construction contract. \n\nlegislation,  regulations, \n\ninformation  required, \n\nThe  employer  will  reimburse  all  reasonable  costs  associated  with  the  provision  of  services  on \nthe Project including \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\npersonal  taxes:  all  approved  travel  and  accommodation  costs  including  a  per \ndiem for  visiting foreign staff and a housing allowance for resident foreign staff; \nand \nall office running costs. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12         41 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nTraffic Forecasts \n\n \nA. \n \nThe forecast presented is based on analysis of the domestic and transshipment market, \n1. \nwhich  is  subdivided  into  Indian  subcontinent  (ISC)  transshipment  and  others.  The  forecast \nmodel  calculates  a  transshipment  share  of  the  ISC  market  and  assesses  Colombo\u2019s  share. \nBecause  Jawaharlal  Nehru  Port,  Nhava  Sheva,  accounts  for  half  of  the  ISC  market  and  has \nmoved  from  40%  to  70%  direct  calls  in  5  years,  the  transshipment  share  available  has  fallen \nrapidly  to  45%  of  the  total  container  traffic.  The  forecast  anticipates  the  share  of  the  ISC \ntransshipment market to continue to decrease. To date, no carrier has been limited in its choice \nof vessel size at an Indian port. However, quite soon as volumes increase and justify direct calls \nwith  bigger  ships,  size  will  become  a  factor.  Despite  dredging  programs  and  port  building, \ncarriers  will  be  constrained  by  size  at  Indian  ports  and  Colombo\u2019s  advantage  is  that  it  will  be \nable  to  handle  the  largest  vessels.  The  demand  estimates  for  the  Project  take  account  of  the \nport  expansion  plans  of  neighboring  countries  such  as  India,  as  well  as  the  opinion  of  the \ninternational  shipping  industry  regarding  the  potential  of  Colombo  Port  to  be  a  transshipment \nhub port in light of these plans. Shipping industry representatives state that while western Indian \ncargo  most  likely  would  be  lost  to  Colombo,  nevertheless  Colombo  is  in  a  good  position  to \ncapture eastern and southern Indian transshipment cargo provided that it expands its capacity. \nThe demand forecast in the project viability analysis therefore assumes that Colombo Port will \nhave a 30% market share of ISC cargo. Direct, not diverted, services are most important; in the \nfuture larger vessels will have greater difficulty diverting because of the traffic volume involved. \nThe container traffic forecast for national imports and exports is shown in Table A12.1. \n \n\nTable A12.1: Forecast of Domestic Container Traffic at Colombo Port  \n\n(\u2018000 twenty-foot equivalent units) \n \n\nForecast \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2010 \n\n2015 \n\n2020 \n\n2030 \n\n2040 \n\nActual \n\n546a \n\n601 \n\n661 \n\n727 \n\n1,118 \n\n1,643 \n\n2,414 \n\n4,975 \n\n9,786 \n\n         Note: 2002\u20132040: unconstrained by port capacity limitations. \n\n  a  Used as base for projection. \nSource: Consultant estimates \n\n \n2. \nTables  A12.2  through  A12.4  provide  a  forecast  of  container  traffic  volume  for  the  ISC. \nTable A12.2 provides a forecast of the total container traffic to be generated in the ISC. Table \nA12.3  provides  an  assessment  of  the  transshipment  share  of  the  ISC  container  market.  The \npotential  transshipment  share  of  the  ISC  market  is  expected  to  decline  in  the  short  term  as  a \nresult of increased direct calls. The decline rate is expected to fall in the medium term as larger \nships are introduced and then it will increase again. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \nTable A12.2: Forecast of Indian Subcontinent Container Traffic \n(\u2018000 twenty-foot equivalent units) \n\n \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2010 \n\n2015 \n\n2020 \n\n2030 \n\n2040 \n\nActual \n\nForecast \n\n4,739 \n\n5,274 \n\n5,871 \n\n6,536 \n\n10,643 \n\n15,790 \n\n21,652 \n\n40,902 \n\n77,707 \n\n       Note: Total including direct and transshipped containers. \n\nSource: Consultant estimates  \n\n \n\nTable A12.3: Share Adjustment Indian Subcontinent Transshipment \n \n\nPeriod \n\n% Share Adjustment Indian Subcontinent  \n\nTransshipment Share (%) \n\n2003\u20132008 \n2009\u20132011 \n2012\u20132040 \nSource: Consultant estimates  \n \n\n2 annual reduction \n1 annual rise (by advent of Suez max ships) \n1 annual reduction \n\n33 by 2008 \n36 by 2011 \n17 by 2040 \n\nTable A12.4: Forecast of Transshipment Indian Subcontinent Container Traffic \n(\u2018000 twenty-foot equivalent units) \n \n\nYear  \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2002 \nActual \n\n4,739 \n\n5,274 \n\n5,871 6,536 \n\n7,203 \n\n7,940  8,754 \n\n9,652 \n\n10,643 \n\nIndia, Bangladesh, \nPakistan container \ntraffic  \n\nPercentage \ntranshipped via \nColombo, \nSingapore, Salalah, \netc (%) \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\nYear  \nIndia, Bangladesh, \nPakistan container \ntraffic  \n\nPercentage \ntranshipped via \nColombo, \nSingapore, Salalah, \netc (%) \n\n45 \n2,133 \n\n43 \n2,268 \n\n41\n\n39 \n2,407 2,549 \n\n37 \n2,665 \n\n35 \n2,779  2,889 \n\n33 \n\n34 \n3,282 \n\n35 \n3,725 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013\n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2020 \n\n2030 \n\n2040 \n\n \n\n \n\n11,513 \n\n12,457 \n\n13,479 14,588 \n\n15,790 \n\n21,652 \n\n40,902 \n\n77,707 \n\n36 \n\n35 \n\n34\n\n33 \n\n32 \n\n27 \n\n22 \n\n17 \n\n4,360 \n\n4,583 4,814 \n\n5,053 \n\n5,846 \n\n8,988 \n\n13,210 \n\nTotal \n\n  \nSource: Consultant estimates  \n \n\n4,145 \n\n\fAppendix 12         43 \n\nColombo\u2019s  transshipment  forecast  is  built  on  the  following  basis:  (i)  the  forecast \n3. \ntransshipment volumes from the ISC set out in Table A12.4; and (ii) Colombo\u2019s share of the ISC \ntransshipment  market,  taking  into  account  the  market  dynamics  that  Colombo  is  able  to \nincrease its share from 23% in 2002 to about 29% by 2010, providing it is able to achieve high \nproductivity.

Infrastructure costs are based on detailed design currently \nunder preparation. Alternative designs were considered for each project component, and least-\ncost  technical  solutions  were  identified  by  comparing  benefits  and  costs  of  mutually  exclusive \ndesign options. The breakwater costs are based on a rubble mound structure, which minimizes \nthe use of rock by using concrete amour units and maximizes the use of dredged sand in the \ncore of the structure. This structure is less costly than an alternative caisson structure by 27% \nper  meter  for  this  Project.  Sand  for  reclamation  will  be  taken  from  the  access  channels  and \nharbor basin. The actual equipment to be used in the terminal will depend on the preference of \nthe terminal operator. However, for costing purposes, each terminal is assumed to have a quay \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nlength of 1,200 m and to be operated by 12 quayside cranes and 40 rubber-tired gantry cranes.  \nThe quay walls are costed as low reflective structures consisting of a reinforced concrete deck \nsupported on tubular steel piles. The total cost of the Project is estimated to be $1.3 billion. The \ndetails of the cost estimates are given in Table A12.7. \n \n6. \nOperating Costs. Operating costs are divided into variable costs, costs that would vary \nwith the utilization of the terminal, and fixed costs that are independent of terminal throughput. \nTables A12.8 and A12.9 set out the variable and fixed costs. \n \n\nTable A12.7: Estimated Project Capital Costs \n\n1.

This  would  require \nbuilding  additional  container  terminals  since  the  existing  container  terminals  are  quickly \nreaching capacity. Container terminals are a revenue-generating infrastructure project and can \nattract private sector investment. However the new container terminals can only be built outside \nthe area protected by the existing breakwater. A new breakwater is therefore a prerequisite for \nbuilding  the  new  terminals.  Breakwaters  are  a  \u201clumpy\u201d  investment  and  the  site  conditions  are \nsuch  that  the  minimum  size  of  the  breakwater  that  can  be  built  would  be  sufficient  to  protect \nthree  container  terminals.  However  demand  considerations  mean  that  the  container  terminals \nwould  be  needed  only  in  phases.  Thus  no  single  prospective  bidder  for  a  terminal  would  be \nwilling  to  shoulder  the  cost  of  building  a  breakwater  sufficient  to  protect  three  terminals.  The \nproject  breakwater  is  therefore  a  public  good  that  will  not  by  itself  attract  private  sector \ninvestment and thus has to be provided by the public sector.  \n \n \n \n8. \nThe  economic  evaluation  compares  the  economic  costs  and  economic  benefits  of  the \nProject from the viewpoint of the national economy. Economic analysis is based on the scenario \nthat  three  terminals  will be  sequentially  developed  to  meet  forecasted demands  by  taking  into \naccount the  strategy  of the  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority  (SLPA)  to  provide  basic  infrastructure  to \n\nEconomic Benefits and Costs \n\n2. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\naccommodate three terminals. The main consequence for the economy if the Project is not built \nwould be the loss of the frequent, fast, direct shipping services used by exporters and importers. \nWithout investment in the South Harbor, Colombo would lose its transshipment traffic; and if the \nport no longer operates as a transshipment hub port, it would soon lose its direct calls on trunk \nline  routes.  Local  traffic  is  not  high  enough  to  attract  direct  calls  by  trunk  line  ships.  Colombo \nwould eventually become a feeder port, served by a combination of feeder ships and multiport \nservices with relatively long transit times for the ports with lower traffic volumes.  \n \nThe Sri Lankan economy will experiences several costs if Colombo Port were to lose its \n9. \ntransshipment  hub  status.  The  benefits  to  the  Sri  Lankan  economy  are  thus  the  avoidance  of \nthese  costs.  The  first  economic  benefit  of  the  Project  would  be  the  avoidance  of  the  cost  of \nhaving  to  use  feeders.  The  average  cost  of  feeding  to/from  Singapore  and  other  regional \ntransshipment  hubs  would  be  around  $250  in  balanced  international  shipping  markets.  With \nsurplus capacity this price will decline; in period of shortages it will increase. Furthermore, the \nfeeder cost will be absorbed by the shipping lines where they have to compete with fast, direct \nservices.  But  when  the  fast,  direct  services  are  phased  out,  the  feeder  cost  will  normally  be \npassed  on  in  full.  The  feeder  cost  would  be  incurred  by  most  but  not  all  containers  on  long \ndistance  routes.  Freight costs  are  an  important  factor  in  key  Sri  Lankan  exports,  e.g.,  textiles, \nwhich make up more than 50% of Sri Lankan exports. SLPA records show that about one third \nof  Colombo\u2019s  imports  and  exports  are  on  long  distance  routes,  excluding  some  of  the  longer \nintra-Asian  routes.  A  study  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development1 \nfinds  that  freight  costs  from  Asian  countries  already  account  for  a  higher  percentage  of \nAmerican  market  textile  import  costs  at  about  6%  compared  with  about  3%  for  textile  imports \nfrom Latin America and the Caribbean. Some of these long distance routes are assumed to be \nserved by ships on multiport itineraries calling at Indian subcontinent ports; but that the majority, \n20% of exports and imports conservatively estimated, would use feeders to a regional hub if the \nProject  is  not  implemented.  If  the  Project  is  implemented  and  Colombo  Port  retains  its  direct \nservices,  conservative  estimates  are  that  an  average  feeder  cost  of  $250  per  TEU  on  20%  of \nexports  and  imports  would  be  saved.  This  benefit  is  estimated  at  $82  million  in  2015,  which \nwould otherwise have to be absorbed by exporters to maintain their market competitiveness.  \n \n10. \nThe value to shippers of direct, fast, frequent services can be measured by willingness \nto pay. A good example is the express service currently provided by one of the major shipping \nlines,  giving  fast  transit  on  the  route  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  via  Singapore  to \nEurope.  This  service  is  particularly  effective  in  getting  garments  to  retail  outlets  faster  than \ncompeting  services  in  minimal  time.  The  shipping  lines  are  in  practice  able  to  obtain  a  large \npremium  of  approximately  $500/TEU  for  the  fast  transit  time.  Longer  transit  times  and  delays \nare injurious to export markets, especially for textiles. Textiles accounted for 52% of Sri Lankan \nexports in 2002, and exporters confirm that a substantial proportion of these products have to \nget to retail outlets fast. The importance of the time factor in future textile trade has also been \nconfirmed.  The  study  (footnote  1)  found  that  lead  time  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  determining \ninternational  competitiveness  because  of  trade-offs  between  low  wage  costs  and  time  factors. \nThe  study  found  that  closeness  to  a  large  consumer  market,  e.g.,  United  States  or  Western \nEurope  provides  a  competitive  edge  in  the  highly  competitive,  time-sensitive,  and  fashion-\noriented clothing market, and also for new exports that will emerge. The cost to the economy is \nestimated conservatively on the basis that 10% of the total traffic would be willing to pay $300 \nper TEU for fast, direct, reliable service (in practice, premiums of $500 per TEU are being paid \nat  present).  On  this  basis  the  benefit  of  retaining  direct  services  is  estimated  at  $49  million  in \n\n                                                 \n1   Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.  2004.

Textile manufacturers confirm that this is a good illustration of willingness to pay for the \nmore time-sensitive national containers.  \n \n11. \nContainer  terminals  obtain  additional  revenue  from  transshipment.  Without  the  Project, \ntransshipment  traffic  would  almost  certainly  decline  rapidly  before  2010,  rather  than  being \nsqueezed out gradually by imports and exports. However, for the purpose of economic analysis, \nthe  most  conservative  scenario  in  which  existing  facilities  still  handle  the  considerable \ntransshipment  traffic  is  applied.  The  tariff  for  transshipment  is  assumed  as  $29  per  TEU  by \ntaking  into  account  the  international  hub  port  competition  to  attract  transshipment.  With  the \nProject,  this  transshipment  revenue,  $35  million  in  2015,  would  be  retained.  In  addition  to  the \nterminal operator, SLPA itself earns revenue from handling transshipment cargo. The revenues \nto SLPA come from harbor entering dues and harbor tonnage dues. They average $3 per TEU. \nAdditional revenue to SLPA would result from providing marine services, but this would be offset \nby costs and are not included here. These two revenues items are gains to the country as they \ncome from providing transshipment services to cargo originating outside Sri Lanka and destined \nfor places outside Sri Lanka as well.  \n \n12. \nThe costs of other items, e.g., freight costs, feeder shipping costs, and terminal and port \ncharges, are determined in the international competitive market. Thus, they are assumed to be \nfree of distortions and so shadow pricing is not necessary for measuring their economic costs. \nAccordingly, the avoidance of these costs reflects true economic benefits.

To estimate the WACC, ADB is \nassumed to finance 68% of the Project and the Government of Sri Lanka 32%. Nominal costs of \nfinancing are assumed at 6.0% for ADB and 11.4% for the Government. Incorporating the other \nassumptions,  i.e.,  a  domestic  inflation  rate  of 7.0%,  and SLPA\u2019s  effective  tax  rate  of  24%,  the \nestimated WACC is 4.4%. The FIRR of 11.5% exceeds this WACC, demonstrating the financial \nvalidity of the Project for SLPA.  \n \n18. \nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  changes  in  traffic  forecasts,  capital \ninvestment costs, and rates of revenue (Table A12.15).

A  terminal \noperator  incurs  the  capital  investment  cost  of  south  terminal  development,  terminal  operation \ncost, and concession fees (royalties and lease/rental fees to SLPA presented in Table A12.12) \nwhile  earning  revenues  from  tariffs  presented  in  Table  A12.13.  The  values  assigned  to  the \nincomes  are  compared  with  the  values  assigned  to  expenditures  for  the  operator  up  to  2034. \nThe FIRR is approximately 16.3%, which is in line with comparable new terminal developments \ninternationally.

The  Project  will  facilitate  economic \ngrowth  by  enhancing  national  competitiveness  in  international  trade  via  lower  costs  and  faster  delivery,  generate \nadditional income from transshipment, and provide incomes from construction. In addition it  will enhance export and \nimport  intensity  of  the  national  economy  and  provide  economywide  efficiency  benefits.  The  Project  will  contribute \nsignificantly to poverty reduction, primarily by creating income and employment opportunities for low income earners \nlinked with the export-import trade sector of the economy and lead to poverty reduction in the quarrying industry.  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                    \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe Project comprises construction of a new outer basin enclosed by a breakwater and served by a new navigation \nchannel.  Material  dredged  from  the  channel  will  be  used  in  reclamation  to  provide  new  container  berths  with \nassociated  infrastructure,  buildings,  and  operation  facilities.  The  project-affected  area  includes  (i)  Colombo  City, \nconsidered to be the main activity zone of the Project; (ii) Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR) comprising Colombo, \nGampaha and Kalutara districts; and (iii) quarry sites, including immediate neighborhoods, road corridors, and loading \npoints. CMR has an estimated population of 5.4 million and accounts for over 70% of the country's industrial activities, \n53% of industrial employment, and 31% of total employment. The three CMR districts have relatively high population \ndensities.1 Between districts, the highest urban population density of 54.7% is concentrated in Colombo district due to \nthe increased opportunities of employment in the garment industry, banking, services, and informal sectors. The CMR \neconomy has undergone substantial change over the past three decades. In terms of job formation, it has grown much \nfaster than the nation as  a  whole. Unemployment rates in CMR are lower than the rest of the country, although the \narea has a relatively large unskilled youth labor force. Of those employed, the average monthly income in Sri Lanka \nwas estimated at SLRs3,056 for 2002, while the corresponding figure for CMR was SLRs4,993. Each of the districts in \nCMR  also  had  average  incomes  above  the  national  average:  Colombo  SLRs4,923,  Gampaha  SLRs4,013,  and \nKalutara SLRs3,046.  \n \nModera and Mattakkuliya, major fishing areas in Colombo District, are located next to the Project. The coastal stretch \nsouth  of  the  Project  (Agulana,  Dehiwala,  Egoda  Uyana,Lunawa,  Mount  Levinia,  Moratuwa,  Rathmalana,  etc.)  also \nincludes  traditional  fishing  areas.  Of  these,  Moratuwa,  Dehiwala  Modera,  and  Mattakkuliya  were  affected  to  varying \nextents by the Asian tsunami, but generally these areas were less affected than communities further south and east. \nFishery  communities  largely  live  in  dwelling  units  constructed  on  beaches.  The  number  of  households  engaged  in \nfishing in these areas appears to be declining not only because of the preference for alternative employment, but also \ndeclining fish resources. Just over 2,000 households are now engaged in fishing. The majority of fishing crafts have \noutboard  motors  that  are  used  mainly  in  inshore  areas.  The  existing  port  and  its  approaches  have  a  security  zone \nwithin which fishing is not allowed. While the nation as a whole will experience the economic impacts of the Project, \nthe  existing  concentration  of  economic  activity  in  CMR  is  likely  to  function  as  an  important  factor  in  mediating  the \nsocial impacts of the Project in the surrounding areas. Thus, CMR residents will experience most of its social impacts \nemanating from economic, employment, trade, and transportation growth.  \n \nIn Sri Lanka, poverty is greatest in the rural sector (20.8%), followed by the urban sector (6.2%), and the estate sector \n(4.3%).  Across  the  industry  subsectors,  the  highest  poverty  is  reported  in  mining  and  quarrying  industries  as \nemployment in quarrying is characterized by its low pay as well as its temporary and irregular  nature,. As per 1996 \ndata, the incidence of poverty among those engaged in mining and quarrying was 41.5%. The next highest incidence \n\n                                                 \n1   Data  from  2001  shows  a  density  of  299  people  per  square  kilometer  for  the  country  as  a  whole  and  3,303  for \n\nColombo, 1,539 for Gampaha, and 1,539 for Kaluthara districts. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13        55\n\n \n\n \n\nof  poverty  was  in  agriculture  at  28.4%.  As  per  Department  of  Census  and  Statistics  2004,  the  percentage  of  poor \nhouseholds  living  below  the  official  poverty  line 2 is  5%  for  Colombo  District,  9.2%  for  Gampaha,  and  17.7%  for \nKalutara compared with 19.2% for Sri Lanka. Although the Western province in which the CMR is located, records the \nlowest  incidence  of  poverty,  it  accounts  for  the  largest  proportion  of  the  total  poor.  The  poverty  profile  of  the  city  of \nColombo reveals about 1,614 poor urban settlements with about 77,612 families. The urban poor of Colombo include \nthose  engaged  in  informal  sector  activities  and  blue  collar  workers  of  the  ports,  industries,  railways,  etc.  They  are \nmostly concentrated in the slums, shanties, and low cost housing in the northern and central parts of the city. Lack of \nland ownership, poor access to drinking water, poor sanitation facilities, and lack of a regular source of income are a \nfew of the main factors causing poverty.  \n \nImpacts  of  the  Project  will  be  distributed  differently  in  different  geographic  areas  and  over  time.  Communities  living \nadjacent  to  the  Project  will  experience  the  most  impacts.  The  major  positive  social  impacts  are  anticipated  to  arise \nthrough  the  creation  of  direct  and  indirect  employment  opportunities  during  project  construction  and  operation. \nEmployment opportunities are likely to occur due to (i) construction and operation related work; (ii) quarrying, and (iii) \npotential additional employment from benefits arising from increased vessel traffic and other development initiatives. \nThus  the  additional  jobs  are  expected  to  be  significant.  The  majority  of  the  temporary  employment  related  to \nconstruction of the breakwater and three terminals will be accrued by those living in CMR. About half of the population \nin  Colombo  live  in  slums  and  the  poor  who  are  underemployed  or  unemployed  will  have  access  to  temporary \nemployment  opportunities  created  by  the  Project.  Similarly,  those  residing  in  the  surrounding  areas  will  compete  for \nmore regular employment opportunities arising out of the Project. During project operation only a fraction of the new \njobs  are  expected  to  be  executive  positions,  the  largest  proportion  of  workers  employed  will  be  in  administration \n(clerks,  supervisors,  storekeeper,  typist,  etc),  followed  by  technical  (crane  operator,  vehicle  drivers  etc)  and \nnontechnical  positions  (dockers,  cleaners,  etc.).  Areas  where  rock  will  be  sourced  for  the  construction  of  the \nbreakwater will be determined by the appointed contractor. However, people who live close to the quarry sites, land-\nbased  transport  routes,  and  barge  load-out  points  will  experience  some  of  the  direct  impacts  of  the  Project.  The \nincome impact of quarrying  will be largely attributed to contractors, providers of related services (such as transport), \nand  workers. Those  working in the quarrying industry  are  recognized as  belonging to one of the most impoverished \nemployment  sectors  in  the  country,  due  to  low  wages  and  discontinuous  work.  As  such,  this  group  will  benefit \nsubstantially from any employment opportunities. As per the projected estimates for quarrying activities, the predicted \nopportunities  of  employment  would  vary  from  4,000  to  12,000  per  year  depending  on  the  contractor\u2019s  method  of \nproduction either mechanized or traditional. Increased vessel traffic and other related initiatives outside the immediate \nscope  of  the  Project,  such  as  the  development  of  a  free  trade  zone  will  also  create  benefits.  Benefits  to  import  and \nexport  industries  are  likely  to  accrue  in  areas  outside  the  project-affected  area,  due  to  overall  improvements  in  the \nnational economy from the growth in shipping operations facilitated by the Project. The potential efficiency gains of the \nProject will have an impact on export/import trade sectors and thereby will also offer significant benefits to low income \nearners  of  the  economy.  The  Project  will  also  increase  export-oriented  growth  activities,  which  will  in  turn  result  in \ngreater capital investment, greater employment, and increased employment of those living below the poverty line. \n \nC.

Issues  related  to  the  proposed  port  development  and  various  activities  involved  in  the \nconstruction and operation of the Project were discussed. The main objective was to ascertain community response to \nthe Project and any negative impacts that the Project needs to mitigate. All those consulted had positive reactions to \nthe  Project  and  welcomed  the  benefits  that  development  of  the  port  would  lead  to,  such  as  increased  employment \nopportunities for the people living in the project area.   \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \n2   People  living  in  households  with  real  per  capita  monthly  total  consumption  expenditure  below  SLRs1,423  are \n\nconsidered poor (the official poverty line). \n\n \n\n\f56        Appendix 13 \n\n \n\nIn Sri Lanka, according to the demographic survey of 1994, by the Department of Census and Statistics, about 97% of \nmales  and  87%  of  females  are  literate.  The  female  labor  force  participation  rate  has  been  increasing,  although \nunemployment among women is still higher than for men. In 2002, the labor force participation rate was 50.3%; about \n50% of the labor force belonged to the 20\u201339 years age group. Among the employed, males in the 30\u201339 years age \ngroup and females in the 20\u201324 years age group reported the highest participation in the labor force. The Project will \nprovide educated youth (men and women) equal opportunities to seek short- and long-term employment opportunities \ncreated  under  the  Project.  Those  men  and  women  supplying  labor  for  quarrying-related  activities  would  typically  be \nthose  with  low  literacy  rates  and  low  incomes,  with  a  higher  proportion  being  women.  Assuming  the  degree  of \nmechanization  does  not  affect  the  proportion  of  employees  by  gender,  the  Project  is  expected  to  provide  additional \nemployment opportunities for women. In general, the Project will provide employment opportunities for both men and \nwomen during project construction and operation, and in the quarrying sites. The Project will ensure that employment \nopportunities  and  rates  of  remuneration  are  determined  without  gender-based  discrimination,  according  to  the \nprinciples of equal remuneration for work of equal value.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nE.

Project construction and operation activities \nwill  extend  seaward  from  the  south  end  of  the  existing \nColombo Port and not require any additional land\u2014either \ngovernment  or  private.  To  link  the  existing  port  access \nroad to the new harbor, three government/SLPA buildings \nwill have to be demolished: two warehouses and an SLPA \noffice. The warehouses are presently not used and will not \nbe  rebuilt.  The  SLPA  office  building  will  be  partially \naffected and will be partially demolished. The work space \nof  employees  will  be  accommodated  in  other  office \nbuildings  within  the  port  area,  and  thus  will  not  involve \nconstruction  of  a  new  building.  The  existing  port  access \nroad  will  be  used  for  transport  of  containers  and  other \nimported  goods.  None  of  the  port  access  roads  will  be \nwidened  or  improved,  and  thus  will  not  lead  to  any \nresettlement impacts. Even  after project construction  and \noperation,  the  transport  of  containers  and  other  imported \ngoods  will  take  place  within  the  port-related  activity  zone \nand hence, will not displace any business establishments \nclose \nto  specific  effects \nassociated  with  quarries,  the  quarry  location  will  be \nidentified  by \nthe  contractor  only  during  project \nimplementation prior to the construction of the breakwater. \nThus the Government will have to ensure that if any land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  associated  with \nquarrying of rocks appropriate mitigation measures will be \nformulated  and  implemented  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  Policy  on  \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nNo affordability issues are foreseen \n\nthe  port.

Based  on  Statistical  Abstract \n2003,  Department  of  Census  and  Statistics,  in  the  three \nCMR districts 77%\u201392% of the population are Singhalese, \n1\u201310%  Sri  Lankan  Tamils,  1\u20134%  Indian  Tamils,  2\u20138% \nMuslims, and the rest are either Burghers or Malays. The \nProject  will  not  have  any  differential  impact  on  the \ndifferent  population/ethnic  groups.  The  communities  of \nindigenous people known as Veddha are found mainly in \nthe districts of Badulla, Anuradhapura, and Polonnaruwa, \nwith smaller numbers in other provinces mainly in the east \nand  north.  No  indigenous  people  are  present  in  the \nproject-affected area. \nBased  on \nthe \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  report,  the  Project  will \nbe  constructed  entirely  within  the  \u201cno  fishing\u201d  security \nzone so fish catch or extent of the fishing area available to \nfisherfolk  will  not  be  affected  and  thus  livelihoods  of  the \nfishing  community  in  the  surrounding  area  will  not  be \naffected.  If  the  existing  security  zone  is  increased  to \naccommodate  the  Project  and  dredging  activities  affect \nthe \nthe  community  during  project \nimplementation,  the  Ministry  of  Ports  and  Aviation  will \nensure \nthe  environmental \nto  construction \nmonitoring  plan  addresses  these  concerns  and  develops \nappropriate measures to mitigate the risks. \n\nthe  detailed  engineering  study  and \n\nlivelihood  of \n\nthat  prior \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 01 February 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "SLRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013  Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n \n= \n$0.0092 \n=  SLRs108.58 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \nbuild-operate-transfer \n\u2013 \nCoast Conservation Department \n\u2013 \nColombo Metropolitan Region \n\u2013 \nenvironmental impact assessment \n\u2013 \nenvironmental management plan \n\u2013 \nfinancial internal rate of return \n\u2013 \ngross domestic product  \n\u2013 \nIndian subcontinent \n\u2013 \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \n\u2013 \nJaya Container Terminal \n\u2013 \nLondon interbank offered rate \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Ports and Aviation \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "project implementation unit  \npublic-private partnership \nrubber-tired gantry crane \nSouth Asia Gateway Terminal \nsummary environmental impact assessment \nSri Lanka Ports Authority \nsuperintending resident engineer \ntwenty-foot equivalent unit \nUnity Container Terminal \nweighted average cost of capital \n", " \nNOTES \n", "ADB \nBOT \nCCD \nCMR \nEIA \nEMP \nFIRR \nGDP \nISC \nJBIC \nJCT \nLIBOR \nMPA \nPIU \nPPP \nRTG \nSAGT \nSEIA \nSLPA \nSRE \nTEU \nUCT \nWACC \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "L.
