The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment \nAssessment  report  was  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nBoard of Directors on 12 July 2006. \n   \nProject Description  The Colombo Port Expansion Project provides for dredging and \nbreakwater  construction  sufficient  to  accommodate  three \nterminals,  which  will  be  constructed  sequentially.  The  Project \nincludes the establishment of a new marine operations center, \nrelocation of a submarine oil pipeline, provision of navigational \naids,  and  construction  of  shore  utilities.  The  Project  will  be \ndeveloped  on  a  public-private  partnership  basis.  The  harbor \ninfrastructure works, i.e., dredging, breakwater construction, and \nother works, will be implemented by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority \n(SLPA). The first two terminals will be operational  in 2010 and \n2015 respectively and constructed by operators chosen through \nopen  competitive  bidding  under  a  build-operate-transfer \nconcession agreement. The first concession bid will be for one \nterminal.  \n   \nRationale  Colombo Port is the natural transshipment hub port for the South \nAsian region. However, in recent years Colombo Port lost market \nshare  of  the  regional  transshipment  market  because  the \nfundamentals of the market changed and Colombo Port did not \nadapt. Colombo Port cannot offer the additional operating capacity \nrequired to compete for the Indian subcontinent transshipment \nmarket  or  the  depth  required  to  berth  the  latest  generation \ncontainer  ships.  Colombo  Port  will  have  to  develop  additional \ncontainer berths with the required depth to address these capacity \nand  depth  infrastructure  constraints  if  it  is  to  remain  a \ntransshipment hub port.  \n   ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  promote  economic  growth  by  improving  Sri \nLanka\u2019s  competitiveness  in  the  ports  sector  by  expanding \nColombo  Port  using  public-private  partnerships;  and  facilitate \neconomic  growth  by  enhancing  national  competitiveness  in \ninternational trade via lower transport costs and faster delivery \ntimes.  Container-handling  capacity  will  be  increased  from  3.3 \nmillion twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) in 2006, to 5.7 million \nTEU by 2010, 8.1 million TEU by 2015 and 10.5 million TEU by \n2024.  The  additional  capacity  will  enable  Colombo  Port  to \nincrease its Indian subcontinent transshipment market share from \n23% in 2002 to 30% by 2011. Sri Lanka will thus be able to \ngenerate  additional  income  from  transshipment.  Foreign  direct \ninvestment in the ports sector will increase by approximately $800 \nmillion by 2024.  \n \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $781 million. \nThe  public  sector  component  is  estimated  at  $480  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $49.7 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Total  \nSource  ($ million)  Percent \nPublic Sector Component     \n  Asian Development Bank  300.0  38.5 \n  Government  180.0  23.0 \n  Subtotal  480.0  61.5 \nPrivate Sector Component  301.0  38.5 \n  Total  781.0  100.0 \nSources: Feasibility study and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  A loan of $300,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.35% per annum,  \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will make all proceeds from this loan available to \nTerms  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority  (SLPA)  under  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as the ADB loan.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 April 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31  October  2010  for  both  the  public  and  private  sector \nCompletion Date  components. \n   \nExecuting Agency   Ministry of Ports and Aviation \n   ", "  iii\nImplementation  SLPA will be the Implementing Agency. A project implementation \nArrangements  unit will be established with a full-time project director, and staffed \nwith  qualified  staff  with  expertise  in  contract  management, \nenvironmental monitoring, planning, and accounting. The project \ndirector will report to the Chairman, SLPA. The project director will \nhave  overall  responsibility  for  project  management  and  be \nresponsible for the preparation of quarterly and annual project \nmonitoring  and  progress  reports.  An  interministerial  project \nsteering committee chaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Ports and \nAviation  and  comprising  representatives  from  concerned \ngovernment agencies, will be established to oversee the Project \nand  coordinate  issues  related  to  project  implementation.  The \nChairman, SLPA will report to the project steering committee on a \nregular basis. \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and related services to be financed by the loan will \nbe procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, \nas amended from time to time). All contracts will be procured \nthrough international competitive bidding.  \n   \nConsulting Services  International  and  national  consultants  will  be  required  for \nconstruction supervision. The consultants financed under the loan \nwill be engaged using ADB\u2019s single-source selection procedures \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2006, as amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit Sri Lankan exporters by enhancing their \nBeneficiaries  competitiveness  in  international  markets  through  lower  freight \ncosts  and  faster  delivery  times  for  time-sensitive  exports  e.g., \ntextiles,  which  account  for  52%  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  exports.  Lower \nfreight  costs  are  expected  to  result  in  annual  savings  of  $82 \nmillion  by  2015,  and  faster  delivery  times  will  create  annual \nsavings of $49 million by 2015. In addition transshipment traffic \nwill  generate  direct  net  annual  income  to  terminal  operators \namounting to $77 million by 2015.  \n   \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  As the implementation of this Project will be on a public-private \npartnership basis with the public sector implementing the harbor \ninfrastructure  works  component  and  the  private  sector \nimplementing  the  terminal  component,  the  full  benefits  of  the \nProject are dependent on both components being implemented on \na  coordinated  basis.  Therefore,  the  major  risk  is  if  no  private \nsector  party  is  willing  to  take  up  the  terminal  component \nconcession.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  linking \nimplementation of the harbor infrastructure works component to \nthe  progress  of  selecting  a  successful  bidder  for  the  terminal \nconcession. A delay in the consolidation of the ceasefire in the \ncountry may also have some impact on private sector interest. \nHowever, the private sector has been interested in Colombo Port \nas indicated by the implementation of the South Asia Gateway \nTerminal project even before the ceasefire. The Government has \ndeclared Colombo Port a high-security zone and appointed the Sri \nLankan Navy as the designated authority for port security. The \nnavy has drawn up comprehensive security plans in accordance \nwith the requirements of the International Ship and Port Security \nConvention  of  the  International  Maritime  Organization  for  port \nsecurity and the special security considerations necessary for Sri \nLanka. Colombo Port is the first port in the South Asian region to \nhave implemented both the container security initiative and the \nmega port initiative.  \n   \n \n \n \n ", "  v\n ", " \n2060a RM  v\ni ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Colombo Port Expansion Project. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Sri Lanka\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the 1980s and 1990s averaged \nabout 5%, and increased to 6.1% in 2005. However poverty continues to be a major concern of \nthe Government as 22% of the population is living below the poverty line. The Government\u2019s \nobjective is to increase the rate of economic growth to around 8% per annum to generate the \nresources needed for sustained poverty reduction, achieve its social and economic goals, and \nreduce  regional  disparities.  Medium-term  prospects  hinge  on  Government  plans  to  foster \neconomic growth by significantly raising foreign direct investment as well as domestic public and \nprivate investment. No large infrastructure improvements have been made in the last 20 years, \nresulting in bottlenecks that are a heavy drag on the economy.1 An efficient port system is a key \nfactor in improving the country\u2019s competitiveness and attracting investment. It can also be a \nfactor in encouraging the establishment of other value-added industries since Colombo Port is \nideally situated to be the transshipment center for South Asia. The ports sector in Sri Lanka is \ndominated by Colombo Port. It is the only port equipped to handle container traffic and handles \n95% of Sri Lanka\u2019s total international trade. It also serves as a transshipment hub port for South \nAsia; 70% of Colombo\u2019s container volume consists of transshipment traffic to and from the \nIndian subcontinent (ISC). The volume of containers handled increased from 200,000 twenty-\nfoot equivalent units (TEU) in 1985 to 1 million TEU in 1995, but the growth rate then tapered off \nand stagnated between 1997 and 2000 with an annual average of 1.7 million TEU. Growth then \nincreased, and in 2006 Colombo Port handled 3.08 million TEU. One of the main reasons for \nthe stagnation and slow increase in growth is Colombo Port\u2019s lack of competitiveness with other \nmajor transshipment ports established to cater for ISC traffic.  \n \n3.  Colombo Port is owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), a statutory body under \nthe  Ministry  of  Ports  and  Aviation  (MPA).  The  current  SLPA  organization  structure  is  in \nAppendix 2. SLPA operates the three container facilities at the port. Jaya Container Terminal \n(JCT), the main container terminal, has a capacity of 2 million TEU. The two other container \nfacilities are Unity Container Terminal with a capacity of 300,000 TEU and Bandaranaike Quay \nwith a potential capacity of 200,000 TEU. In addition, a private sector company, South Asia \nGateway Terminal (SAGT) Private Limited upgraded and now operates Queen Elizabeth Quay, \nwhich has a capacity of 1 million TEU. A sector analysis of Colombo Port is in Appendix 3.   \n \n1.  Container Traffic Volume  \n4.  In 2005, container traffic volume at JCT accounted for 64% of the total Colombo Port \ncontainer volume, and SAGT for 36%. JCT accounted for more than 90% of the SLPA revenues \nand  profits,  making  container  traffic  the  major  revenue  earner  for  SLPA.  About  70%  of \ncontainers handled in Colombo Port are transshipment containers of which 75% are for the ISC \nmarket and 25% for the West African market. Between 1998 and 2002, the transshipment share \nof Colombo Port for total ISC cargoes declined from 52% to 45% even as the ISC transshipment \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Asian Development Outlook 2006. Manila.  ", "2   \nmarket grew at 8% annually. The loss in market share accounted for the stagnation of overall \ncontainer  traffic  volume  at  Colombo  Port  during  this  period.  This  loss  resulted  from  a \ncombination of factors, some beyond the control of Colombo Port, while others are internal \nfactors including lack of sufficient capacity. Enhancement of operational efficiency at all its \ncontainer  terminals  and  investment  in  port  infrastructure  is  urgently  needed  to  increase \nColombo Port\u2019s container-handling capacity and alleviate its depth infrastructure constraints to \nreverse  this  trend.  Remaining  a  transshipment  hub  port  will  not  only  bring  more  foreign \nexchange to the country, but will also develop supporting industries such as ship chandlery, ship \nrepair, and bunkering activities. \n \n5.  Direct  calls  at  Indian  ports  started  around  1997,  when  traffic  volume  reached  the \nthreshold at which it became economic at Nhava Sheva port in India (until then India had been \nserved by feeders). The trend of increased direct calls has since accelerated as a result of \nimprovements in port efficiency, which followed the construction of a private terminal at Nhava \nSheva in 1999. New ports started to compete for Colombo\u2019s transshipment traffic. Before 2000 \nthe competition came from two major ports: Dubai and Singapore; subsequently three additional \ncompetitors  emerged  i.e.  Salalah  in  Oman,  and  Port  Klang  and  Tanjung  Pelepas  both  in \nMalaysia. Internal factors affecting container traffic volume include the delay of construction of \nnew capacity until 2001, resulting in congestion during 1996\u20132000. JCT operation had no \nintraport competition until 2001 and productivity remained below that of the main competitors. \nColombo Port provided no flexibility in pricing and had limited ability to negotiate prices with \nshipping lines. This was a major disadvantage, as the competing ports such as Singapore and \nPort Klang were cutting prices to unusually low levels. In 2002, the period of stagnation ended, \nafter the introduction of new capacity in 2001 by the private operator\u2014SAGT. The introduction \nof competition between the terminals promoted an overall increase in efficiency.at Colombo \nPort.  \n \n2.  Operational Performance \n6.  The overall container growth in Colombo Port increased by 13.3% in 2004 and 10.5% in \n2005. In the first 6 months of 2006, it increased by 18% compared with the same period in 2005. \nCrane productivity for mainline container vessels at JCT increased from 15.1 moves per crane \nper hour in 2001 to 23.4 in 2005. JCT and SAGT now have similar levels of crane productivity. \nAverage service time for container ships at JCT decreased from 17.8 hours in 2001 to 13.8 \nhours in 2005; and average turnaround time for container ships decreased from 23.1 hours in \n2001 to 16.0 hours in 2005. JCT has about 1,500 employees handling a total of 1.7 million TEU. \nSAGT  has  about  500  employees  handling  930,000  TEU.  As  a  comparison  to  world  best \npractice, Singapore Port handles 17 million TEU with only 5,700 employees.  \n \n  3.  Financial Performance  \n \n7.  SLPA consistently made operating profits during 2001\u20132005: SLRs5.26 billion in 2001 \nand SLRs7.4 billion in 2005. Earnings after tax in 2005 were SLRs10.1 billion. Colombo Port \naccounts for approximately 97% of SLPA\u2019s income. SLPA accounting is done using accrual-\nbased accounting in accordance with Sri Lankan accounting standards, which are identical to \ninternational accounting standards. SLPA accounts are audited by the Auditor General of Sri \nLanka and then presented in Parliament. The 2005 summary financial statement for SLPA is \nshown in Appendix 4.  \n ", "  3\nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n8.  Colombo  Port  lost  market  share  of  the  ISC  transshipment  market  because  the \nfundamentals of the market changed and Colombo Port did not adapt to the change. Colombo \nPort faces increased competition from other transshipment ports. The dynamics of the size of \ncontainer ships means that the trend is toward larger container ships. Use of larger ships in turn \nmeans  that  established  transshipment  ports  now  have  a  wider  hinterland  that  they  can \neffectively serve. Hence the use of larger containerships means that Colombo Port now has to \ncompete with established ports such as Singapore and new ports such as, Dubai, Port Klang, \nSalalah and Tanjung Pelepas, (para. 5) for the ISC transshipment market. These ports are \nowned in whole or in part by established port operators and shipping lines, and are able to \nprovide  higher  productivity  and  faster  ship  turnaround  times.  Thus  they  have  a  built-in \nadvantage when competing for the ISC market.2 Colombo Port\u2019s efficiency and locational edge \nin the ISC transshipment market has therefore eroded as new players in South-East Asia and \nthe Gulf region have used more modern institutional structures and equipment to reduce ship \nwaiting and turnaround times.  \n \n9.  Colombo Port is not able to offer the additional operating capacity required to compete \nfor the ISC transshipment market. The total current transshipment market is 6 million TEU and \nis forecast to grow at 8% annually. The combined potential container capacity of all the facilities \nat Colombo Port is 4 million TEU. As 3.08 million TEU were handled in 2006, and as Sri Lanka\u2019s \nown exports and imports grow, Colombo Port is expected to reach its full current capacity by \n2010. It will thus reach its limit in the volume of transshipment traffic it can handle. This will \nmake the port unattractive to shipping lines that require guaranteed capacity before they decide \nto make a port a transshipment hub.  \n \n10.  Colombo Port has a depth of 15 meters (m). This means that it cannot berth the latest \ngeneration containerships, i.e., 9,000 TEU vessels; its competitors in Dubai, Singapore, Salalah, \nand Tanjung Pelepas can all berth 9,000 TEU vessels. Shipping economics mean that the trend \nis toward larger container vessels. Major shipping lines have already launched 11,000 TEU \nvessels for the Asia\u2013Europe route, and in the next 10 years major container lines could possibly \ndeploy vessels with 13,000 TEU carrying capacity. All hub ports therefore need to upgrade their \ninfrastructure to handle these larger vessels or see their competitive position eroded.   \n \n11.  The future performance of Colombo Port depends on how it addresses the institutional \nand infrastructure constraints that it faces to complement its excellent geographic location and \nto ensure that it remains a major transshipment hub port for the ISC region. This means that it \nhas to put into place measures to enhance its operational efficiency at all its container terminals, \nset up an operating environment that ensures fair competition for all terminal operators, and \naddress its capacity and depth infrastructure constraints. International experience in the ports \nsector shows that the most appropriate institutional structure for port efficiency is the landlord \nport model, whereby the port authority is responsible for the common facilities while terminal \noperations are carried out by a terminal operating company. By increasing its capacity and \nefficiency, Colombo Port will remain a hub port, bring more foreign exchange to the country, and \ndevelop supporting industries such as ship chandlery, ship repair, and bunkering. It will also \n                                                 \n2  PSA Corp, the Singapore container terminal operator operates Singapore Port.. Dubai is operated by Dubai Ports \nWorld, one of the largest port operators in the world. Hutchinson Port Holdings of Hong Kong, China, has an equity \nshare in Port Klang. Maersk, a large container shipping line has equity shares in Salalah and Tanjung Pelepas.  \n ", "4   \nhave the potential to make Sri Lanka a distribution center for the South Asian region, a role \nnormally centered on transshipment hubs. Being a transshipment hub will reduce shipping costs \nfor Sri Lanka\u2019s own exports and imports, and thus make the country a more competitive location \nfor foreign and domestic investment.  \n \n  2.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n12.  Modern development of Colombo Port started in 1980 with the construction of the first \nphase of JCT using funding from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, now the Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC). A series of JBIC loans through the 1980s and 1990s \nfunded enlargement of JCT to its present four berths. In 2000, JBIC provided a loan to upgrade \nJCT\u2019s  computer  systems.  JBIC  is  currently  providing  a  $124  million  loan  to  finance  the \nexpansion of Galle Port. The World Bank provided assistance to the ports sector under its Port \nEfficiency Project, which commenced in 1997. This funded studies into the legal, regulatory, and \nmanagement aspects of both the ports sector as a whole and Colombo Port in particular. This \nproject failed in 1999 due to lack of agreement between the World Bank and the Government on \nsector restructuring. ADB\u2019s assistance to the Sri Lanka ports sector includes loan and equity \ninvestment in SAGT for private sector development and operation of the Queen Elizabeth Quay \nin Colombo Port.3 ADB also provided technical assistance in 1999 to assist the Government in \nexamining the feasibility of expanding Colombo Port.4  \n \n13.  Subsequently, ADB provided a loan in 2001 to (i) address sector policy, and institutional \nand regulatory issues; and implement measures to improve the efficiency of the existing port, in \nparticular JCT; and (ii) carry out the preparatory work for the Colombo Port Expansion Project.5 \nThe main services consultant engaged for this project produced an action plan to increase JCT \nefficiency, a business plan analyzing the demand forecasts and economic and financial viability \nof  expanding  Colombo  Port,  and  a  detailed  engineering  report  on  the  technical  options \navailable. These were reviewed and accepted by a panel of experts recruited separately as \nindividual  consultants  under  this  same  loan  to  assess  the  commercial,  operational,  and \ntechnical viability of the main services consultants\u2019 proposals. The terms of reference for the \nmain services consultants require them to prepare detailed construction tender documents and \nbid concession documents, and provide technical and bid advisory services to the Government \nfor the Project. A summary of past and ongoing external assistance to the ports sector in Sri \nLanka is given in Appendix 5.  \n \n  3.  Lessons Learned \n \n14.  The 2001 ADB loan included two significant policy covenants. The first covenant was for \nJCT to be transformed into a corporate entity wholly owned by the Government. The objective of \nthis  covenant  was  to  increase  overall  port  efficiency  through  increasing  JCT  efficiency  by \nmaking the landlord port model the dominant model in Colombo Port. However the Government \nhas not been able to corporatize JCT and thus has been unable to implement the landlord port \nmodel in Colombo Port. The Government instead decided to increase JCT efficiency through \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1999.

Average \nturnaround time for container ships improved by 30% from 23.1 hours in 2001 to 16 hours in \n2005; average waiting time per ship improved by 77% from 3.6 hours in 2001 to 0.8 hours in \n2005. The introduction of a private sector competitor\u2014SAGT\u2014has therefore helped to increase \noperational efficiency of the SLPA-run JCT until both JCT and SAGT now have similar levels of \noperational crane productivity at 23 moves per crane per hour. Although efficiency increase is a \nnecessary condition it is not a sufficient condition to result in an increase in ISC transshipment \nmarket share. Instead increases in efficiency need to be supplemented by an increase in the \navailable capacity to cater for changing market needs. This is shown by the fact that although \nJCT efficiency increased and the absolute volumes handled by Colombo Port increased since \n2003, it did not help to increase the overall market share of Colombo Port in the transshipment \nmarket. Colombo Port faces depth and capacity constraints that place it at a disadvantage in the \nmarket.  Hence  both  efficiency  levels  and  infrastructure  capacity  at  the  required  depths  at \nColombo Port need to be further increased. As the capacity of JCT and SAGT cannot be \nincreased, a greenfield site needs to be developed as part of the Project so that Colombo Port \ncan continue to offer major shipping lines guaranteed capacity and be able to take the large \ncontainer ships that will be introduced by major shipping lines in the near future. Constructing \nadditional  terminals  will  also  help  to  increase  overall  port  efficiency  through  additional \ncompetition only if the landlord port model becomes the dominant model in Colombo Port.  \n \n15.  As the original approach to make the landlord port model the dominant model through \ncorporatization of JCT did not succeed, ADB carried out intensive policy dialogue with the \nGovernment to use the public-private partnership (PPP) approach as an alternative method \nallowing  the  landlord  port  model  to  become  the  dominant  model  in  Colombo  Port.  The \nGovernment agreed to use the PPP approach for future container terminals in Colombo Port. \nCommon facilities such as capital dredging and breakwater construction will remain a public \nsector responsibility, while terminal operations will be carried out by terminal concessionaires. \nThe Project will allow for three new container terminals to be developed, i.e., south, west, and \neast terminals. In the first phase only the south terminal will be developed. The prospective \nterminal operator will be a corporate entity selected through open competitive bidding to ensure \nthat intraport competition between the different terminals is enhanced and thus improve the \noverall efficiency of Colombo Port. Open competitive bidding will also be used for the second \nterminal to be built as part of the Project, tentatively in 2015. The third terminal to be developed \nin 2024 will also follow the PPP modality. This Project will therefore make the landlord port \nmodel the dominant model in Colombo Port through using a PPP approach.  \n \n16.  The second significant policy covenant of the 2001 ADB loan (footnote 5) was to reform \nthe  regulatory  structure  for  the  ports  sector  through  legislation,  especially  to  curb  any \nanticompetitive behavior on the part of established operators. The Government\u2019s long-term \nobjective in this regard is to enact a Port Competition Act. Prior experience with both the World \nBank and the ADB assistance indicate that changing the regulatory structure by legislation \nneeds to be done in incremental steps with the agreement of all parties. Hence, in the interim, \nusing a regulation by contract approach, the Government through a Cabinet decision on 11 \nOctober 2006 approved the establishment of an advisory committee to consider any grievances \nor complaints that current and future container terminal operators may have regarding fair \ncompetition issues. The committee will be chaired by the Secretary, MPA and membership will \ninclude the person holding the post of Director General of the Public Utilities Commission. The \nGovernment  has  agreed  that  the  committee  will  be  operational  within  3  months  of  loan \neffectiveness. The proposed terms of reference, composition, and draft procedures for the \ncommittee are given in Appendix 6. Rules and procedures of the committee will be finalized \n ", "6   \nwithin 3 months of loan effectiveness. Once the committee is operational, all existing terminal \noperators will be informed of its role and reference to the advisory committee will be included in \nconcession agreements to be signed with future terminal operators.  \n \n  4.  Opportunities \n \n17.  Even though the market share of Colombo Port for the ISC transshipment market has \ndeclined, in absolute terms the volume has increased and Colombo Port has the potential to \nfurther increase both its volume and its market share of transshipment traffic. Colombo Port has \nseveral natural advantages: It has a well-protected deepwater harbor and is located near the \neast\u2013west trunk routes between the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the United States East Coast \nregions. It is thus the closest transshipment port to the huge, rapidly expanding markets of the \nISC. For Europe-bound cargo for the east and south segments of the ISC, using Colombo Port \nas a hub port is more advantageous than using Southeast Asian ports because of the shorter \ndistance to Colombo Port. Extensive market studies were conducted as part of the business \nplan for the Project taking into account port development plans in competing ports. These \nstudies, which were validated by the independent panel of experts advising the Government on \nthe Project, show that if terminal operators at Colombo Port are able to offer high productivity, \nsufficiently large additional capacity, ability to take larger vessels, and ability to negotiate tariffs \nwithout external control, a revival of Colombo Port\u2019s share of regional transshipment traffic is \nexpected\u2014from a 23% share of the ISC transshipment market in 2002 to 30% by 2011.  \n \n18.  The growth of the Sri Lankan domestic economy presents another business opportunity \nfor  Colombo  Port.  Domestic  container  volume  handled  by  Colombo  Port  has  been  a  few \npercentage points higher than the GDP growth rate. Domestic container traffic is projected to \nrise by 9.5% annually to 2010 and account for approximately 30% of the total container traffic \nwith transshipment providing the balance.  \n \n  5.  ADB Strategy \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s strategy for the ports sector is based on the fact that an efficient port system is a \nkey factor in improving a country\u2019s competitiveness and attracting investment. As Sri Lanka will \nnot be able to generate sufficient domestic cargo to attract mainline vessels, becoming a \ntransshipment hub port would allow Colombo Port to attract such vessels. As they are more \neconomical they allow Sri Lanka\u2019s own imports and exports to obtain lower freight charges than \nwould otherwise be possible by avoiding the need to use feeder vessels. Enabling Colombo \nPort to maintain its transshipment port status will also bring additional foreign exchange to the \ncountry. The larger volume of ships calling at Colombo Port because of its transshipment hub \nstatus will encourage the growth of ancillary industries, e.g., ship chandlery and bunkering, \nwhich will increase economic activities and generate employment opportunities that otherwise \nwould not exist. Maintaining Colombo Port\u2019s transshipment hub port status will allow Sri Lanka \nto act as a distribution and logistics hub for the South Asian region, which if realized will again \ngenerate  economic  activities  and  employment  opportunities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  is  also  to \nencourage PPP in the ports sector as part of efforts to implement the landlord port model to \nincrease efficiency.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  7\n  6.  Government Port Sector Policy \n \n20.  The Government policy for the ports sector in line with the Government\u2019s Mahinda \nChintana national policy6, sets out the country\u2019s vision for the ports sector as follows: (i) develop \nthe main ports of the country to facilitate increasing export and import trade associated with \nrapid economic development of the country as well as the region by taking advantage of the \nliberalization and globalization process, (ii) decongest Colombo Port by constructing South Port \nin  Colombo,  Galle  and  Hambantota  Ports,  (iii)  develop  medium-scale  ports  in  identified \nprovinces such as South, East, and North to divert increasing volumes of domestic bulk freight \ntransport from road to sea transport; (iv) encourage alternative source of funding for new \ninvestment in port related infrastructure development, (vi) operate ports as commercial entity \nwithout Exchequer support, and (vii) encourage public-private partnership investment for new \ninvestment  in  the  port  sector.  While  continuing  the  state  ownership  of  existing  ports,  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy is to increase efficiency of existing ports, operate ports as commercial \nentity and establish container terminals as public private partnership projects. This Project will \nbe the first transport PPP in Sri Lanka. ADB\u2019s proposed loan is in line with Government policy.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n21.  The Project will promote economic growth by improving Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness in \nthe ports sector by expanding Colombo Port\u2019s capacity using PPP to maintain its status as a \nregional transshipment hub port. Container-handling capacity will be increased from 3.3 million \nTEU in 2006 to 5.7 million TEU by 2010, 8.1 million TEU by 2015 and 10.5 million TEU by 2024. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  economic  growth  by  enhancing  national  competitiveness  in \ninternational trade via lower costs and faster delivery times. Export container traffic handled by \nColombo Port is expected to increase by 9.5% per annum starting in 2011. The additional \ncapacity will enable Colombo Port to increase its ISC transshipment market share from 23% in \n2002 to 30% by 2011. Transshipment volumes handled by Colombo Port are expected to \nincrease by 8% per annum starting in 2011. Sri Lanka will thus be able to generate additional \nincome from transshipment. The direct payments generated by transshipment traffic alone are \nexpected to increase the contribution of the ports sector to GDP by an additional 0.1% by 2015, \nand attract foreign direct investment of approximately $800 million to the ports sector by 2024.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n22.  The Project will expand the container-handling capacity of Colombo Port by 7.2 million \nTEU in three increments of 2.4 million TEU each. The major project elements are dredging an \napproach  channel  and  inner  harbor  basin  west  of  the  existing  harbor,  and  constructing  a \nbreakwater to the west of the existing harbor sufficient to accommodate three new terminals, \nwhich will be constructed sequentially. In addition the Project includes the establishment of a \nnew marine operations center, relocation of an existing submarine oil pipeline near the entrance \nto the new terminal, provision of navigational aids, and construction of shore utilities including \nan electrical power plant, water mains and storage tanks and a sewage treatment plant. The \nProject will be developed on a PPP basis. The terminals will be constructed by operators \nchosen  through  open  competitive  bidding  under  a  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  concession \nagreement;  SLPA  will  carry  out  the  harbor  infrastructure  works,  i.e.,  dredging,  breakwater \n                                                 \n6 Ministry of Finance and Planning. 2006. Mahinda Chintana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka. Colombo. \n ", "8   \nconstruction, and other ancillary works. The concession bid for the first terminal will be carried \nout in the first half of 2007.  \n \n  1.  Harbor Infrastructure Works Component  \n \n23.  The harbor infrastructure works component is designed to accommodate vessels with an \noverall length of 400 m, beam of 55 m, and draft of 16 m. It will be created by constructing a \nmajor new breakwater to the west of the existing harbor and a smaller secondary breakwater. \nThe harbor will be served by a new two-way channel with a depth of 20 m and width of 570 m. \nThe new breakwaters in the initial phase will enclose a basin area of 285 hectares (ha), which \nwill support three new terminals each with a quay length of 1,200 m and land area of 62 ha. The \nbasin will be dredged to 18 m with provision to deepen it to 23 m should a new generation of \ndeep-drafted vessels come online. The depth of 18m is sufficient to cater for 11,000 TEU \nvessels. The existing submarine pipeline to the main crude oil single-point mooring will be \nlowered where it crosses the new dredged areas.  \n \n24.  Preliminary  studies  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  International \nNavigation Association (PIANC) were carried out to size the channels. The outer approach \nchannel has been sized for two-way traffic as it is common to both the existing harbor and the \nProject. The short approach to the existing harbor is and will remain for one-way traffic only. \nModern aids to navigation will be installed along the new channels. To ensure that all vessel \noperations in the Project and the existing port are safely and efficiently carried out, a new \nmarine operations center is proposed near the entrance to the new terminals. This will include \nfacilities for berthing tugs and other harbor craft, a lookout station, and a control room for a new \nvessel traffic management system serving the whole port. In addition this component will include \nconstruction of utilities such as an electrical power plant, water main and storage tanks, and \nsewage treatment plant. ADB\u2019s loan will finance the construction of this component. A detailed \ndescription  of  the  harbor  infrastructure  works  component  and  cost  estimates  is  given  in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n  2.  Container Terminal Component \n \n25.  The first container terminal will have a planned capacity of 2.4 million TEU per annum. \nThe ship\u2013shore transfers are assumed to be handled by 12 rail-mounted gantry cranes and the \nyard operated by 40 rubber-tired gantry cranes. The area behind the berths will have a width of \n476 m comprising a quay apron of 71 m, a yard-stacking area of 325 m, a rear yard of 45 m, \nand common access road and utility corridor of 35 m. Although planned around the rubber-tired \ngantry cranes, the land area is sufficient to accommodate any yard handling method preferred \nby the concessionaire. The container terminal will be developed by the private sector under \nBOT  concession  agreement.  The  winning  concessionaire  will  be  selected  using  open \ncompetitive bidding. Open competitive bidding will also be used to select the operator for the \nnext terminal. SLPA itself will not be allowed to bid but a corporate entity registered by the SLPA \nand/or the Government under the Companies Act No. 72 of 1982 of Sri Lanka, as amended, \nmay bid. SLPA equity in non-Sri Lankan Government or SLPA-owned winning concession \ncompanies will not exceed 15%.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n26.  The Project is developed as a PPP with the public sector implementing the harbor \ninfrastructure works component, while the private sector implements the container terminal \ncomponent  in  line  with  the  provisions  of  the  SLPA  Act.  The  harbor  infrastructure  works ", "  9\ncomponent is a prerequisite for development of the Project. It has high economic returns. The \ncontainer terminal component however will generate high financial returns and thus is being left \nto  the  private  sector  to  develop  and  operate  under  a  BOT  concession.  Operational  and \nmanagerial control will rest with the operator. The Project will generate opportunities for ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department as an equity partner and/or as a lender for the terminal \nconcession company.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n27.  Phase I of the Project involves the construction of the harbor infrastructure works and \none container terminal. The project investment cost for Phase I is $781 million, with the public \ninvestment component estimated at $480 million, including taxes and duties of $49.7 million and \na base cost of $331.2 million. The private investment component is estimated at $301 million. \nTable 1 provides a summary of the cost estimates and Appendix 7 detailed cost estimates. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Financing Plan \n28.  The Government has requested a loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the public sector component of the Project. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.35% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \n ", "10   \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The private sector component will be financed by the \nsuccessful terminal concession bidder. Table 2 shows the financing plan.  \n \n29.  The Government will onlend the proceeds of the ADB loan to SLPA on the same terms \nand conditions as the ADB loan. For this purpose the Government will enter into a subsidiary \nloan agreement with SLPA. The Government has also given assurance that the necessary \ncounterpart financing for the Project will be available.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  Percent \nA.

Project Management \n30.  MPA will be the Executing Agency for the Project, and SLPA the Implementing Agency. \nA project implementation unit (PIU) will be established headed by a full-time project director with \nqualified staff having expertise in contract management, environmental monitoring, planning, \nand accounting. The PIU\u2019s responsibilities will include (i) planning and scheduling of project \nactivities; (ii) supervision and monitoring of the project work program and project performance; \n(iii)  administration  of  procurement  activities;  (iv)  bookkeeping  and  maintenance  of  project \naccounts, and preparation of liquidation/claim reports; (v) preparation and submission of various \nreports to ADB including quarterly and annual project monitoring and progress report; and (vi) \ncoordination of field activities. The project director and key PIU officers will be appointed in \naccordance with the relevant Government procedures within 1 month of loan effectiveness. The \nproject director will report to the Chairman, SLPA. An interministerial project steering committee, \nchaired by the MPA secretary and consisting of representatives from concerned government \nagencies, including Ministry of Finance and Planning, External Resources Department and \nNational Planning Department will be established to oversee, monitor, coordinate, and provide \nthe necessary policy guidance related to project implementation. This committee will meet \nwhenever necessary but not less than once every six months. The Chairman, SLPA will report \nto the interministerial steering committee on a regular basis. The implementation arrangements \nare  shown  in  Appendix  8.  SLPA  as  an  institution  has  the  necessary  systems,  personnel, \naccounting  policies  and  procedures,  reporting  and  monitoring  mechanisms,  and  auditing \nprocedures  to  efficiently  carry  out  financial  management  for  the  Project.  A  financial \nmanagement assessment of SLPA is provided in the Supplementary Appendix. SLPA has \nimplemented  major  foreign-aided  capital  projects  and  is  observed  to  have  the  capacity  to \nefficiently administer loans and implement projects. It has also implemented one ADB loan and \ntherefore is familiar with ADB procedures.  \n ", " 11\n2.  Implementation Period \n31.  The Project will be implemented over 48 months, including preconstruction activities. \nThe scheduled completion date for the Project is October 2010. The harbor infrastructure works \ncomponent  will  be  completed  by  31  October  2010.  This  takes  into  account  advance \nprocurement action for harbor infrastructure works construction. The proposed implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n32.  The project director will be responsible for all procurement activities. All contracts will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to \ntime).  One  works  contract  will  cover  all  harbor  infrastructure  works,  i.e.,  dredging  and \nreclamation works, breakwater construction, construction of all other ancillary civil works, and \nsupply  and  installation  of  navigational  aids,  which  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures with postqualification. Bidders will be given 90 days to prepare \nand submit bids. Indicative contract packages for the Project including consulting services are \nshown in the procurement plan (Appendix 10). On 30 October 2006, ADB approved advance \ncontracting  for  the  harbor  infrastructure  works.  The  Government  was  informed  that  ADB\u2019s \napproval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to subsequently approve the Project or \nto finance the procurement costs.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n33.  International  and  national  consulting  services  will  assist  SLPA  in  implementing  the \nProject. The detailed design of the works is being prepared by the consultants with the Colombo \nPort Efficiency and Expansion Project (footnote 5). Under the proposed Project, consultants will \nbe required for construction supervision including monitoring of the environmental impacts of the \nworks. The consultants financed under the loan will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). The single contract \npackage will include about 150 person-months of international and 1,250 person-months of \nnational consulting inputs. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix \n11. The consultants will be recruited using single-source selection procedures in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time).  \n \n34.  Consultant  selection  is  especially  critical  for  the  Project\u2019s  engineering  and \nimplementation requirements as breakwater design is a highly specialized technical aspect. The \nappointment  of  the  detailed  design  consultants  to  undertake  construction  supervision  was \nreviewed by the Maritime Structures and Port Engineering member of the panel of experts, and \nfound to be the most preferred option to minimize liability risks and disclaimers of responsibility, \nand  to  ensure  that  the  construction  is  executed  in  accordance  with  the  design  factors \nestablished during the detailed design phase. The detailed design is the result of extensive \nengineering  work,  underwater  geotechnical  investigations  and  studies,  numerical  wave \nmodeling, physical wave modeling, current modeling, three-dimensional physical modeling, and \ntwo-dimensional flume testing with model testing of the breakwater design. Given the PPP \nnature of the Project, the issue of liability is particularly critical. Sufficient progress in the partial \nconstruction of the breakwater is necessary before the selected private sector concessionaire \ncan start constructing the terminal. Hence if delays or defects in the breakwater construction \ncause delays in the private sector\u2019s terminal construction schedule, the private sector party will \nhold SLPA liable and claim damages for the delay. Moreover, since the construction season for \nthe breakwater construction is limited to the months of October\u2013May, timely progress of the \n ", "12   \nbreakwater construction is critical to enable the private concessionaire to carry out terminal \nconstruction on schedule. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n35.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the Government, MPA, and SLPA. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption are \nincluded in the loan agreements and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of MPA; SLPA; and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. As a project-\nspecific  anticorruption  measure,  all  bid  awards  will  be  disclosed  on  SLPA\u2019s  website. \nAnticorruption assurances will be incorporated in the loan agreements.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n36.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2001, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government \nand ADB. For works and consulting services, loan funds will be disbursed using ADB\u2019s direct \npayment  procedures  from  ADB  to  the  consultants  and  contractors  against  withdrawal \napplications submitted by SLPA to ADB.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n37.  SLPA will submit detailed progress reports on a quarterly basis. SLPA will maintain \nseparate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services financed from loan \nproceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for the Project, and local funds. \nThe accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. Consolidated \nproject  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by  recognized \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  reports  and  related  financial  statements  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \nThe project director will coordinate all accounts and ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s audit and \naccounting requirements, which will be followed up in regular reviews by ADB.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n38.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through SLPA, will develop a \nproject  performance  management  system,  including  baseline  performance  monitoring  and \nsystematic project performance monitoring. SLPA will carry out surveys (i) at the start of project \nimplementation to establish baseline data, (ii) at midterm review, (iii) at the time of project \ncompletion, and (iv) not later than 6 months after project completion to evaluate the project \nbenefits. Data to be compiled for project performance monitoring and evaluation will be in a \nformat developed in consultation with ADB. Key indicators will be proposed by SLPA and \ndeveloped in consultation with ADB. A project completion report will be submitted within 3 \nmonths of physical completion of the Project, providing detailed evaluation of the progress of \nimplementation, costs, consultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details \nas requested by ADB. \n ", " 13\n9.  Project Review \n39.  A project inception mission will be fielded soon after loan effectiveness. Thereafter, ADB \nand the Government will conduct regular reviews annually or more frequently as required for \neffective project implementation. In 2009, a midterm review by the Government and ADB will \nconsider the Project\u2019s progress and agree on any changes in scope or implementation required \nto achieve the Project\u2019s objectives. SLPA will monitor project implementation and keep ADB \ninformed of any significant deviations that may result in the schedule not being met. The project \ncompletion report should be prepared within 3 months after the physical completion of the \nProject civil works component. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n \n40.  The Project will help consolidate the position of Colombo Port as a transshipment hub \nport for the South Asian region by providing sufficient container-handling capacity and sufficient \ndepth for the latest generation of mainline vessels to call at Colombo Port. The container-\nhandling  capacity  of  each  terminal  to  be  developed  is  2.4  million  TEU/year.  When  three \nterminals are fully developed they will provide an additional capacity of 7.2 million TEU/year. \nMaintaining its status as a transshipment hub port will help enhance national competitiveness in \ninternational  trade  via  lower  costs  and  faster  delivery,  in  addition  to  generating  additional \nincome  from  transshipment.  Taking  into  account  SLPA\u2019s  strategy  to  provide  infrastructure \n(breakwaters, channels, etc.) that can accommodate three terminals, the economic and financial \nanalyses are based on the scenario that three terminals will be sequentially developed as \nnecessary to meet forecasted demand.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n1.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n41.  The economic evaluation compares the economic benefits and costs of the Project from \nthe viewpoint of the national economy. The main consequence for the economy if the Project is \nnot implemented would be the loss of the frequent, fast, direct shipping services used by \nexporters  and  importers.  Without  investment  in  the  Project,  Colombo  Port  would  lose  its \ntransshipment traffic; and if the port no longer operates as a transshipment hub port, it would \nsoon lose its direct calls on trunk-line routes. Local traffic is not high enough to attract direct \ncalls by trunk-line ships. Colombo Port would eventually become a feeder port, served by a \ncombination of feeder ships and mainline services with relatively long transit times for the ports \nwith lower traffic volumes. The consequences for Sri Lanka\u2019s current and future exports would \nbe serious. The Project will benefit Sri Lankan exporters by enhancing their competitiveness in \ninternational markets through lower freight costs and faster delivery times for time-sensitive \nexports e.g., textiles, which account for 52% of Sri Lanka\u2019s exports. \n   \n42.  The main costs to the Sri Lankan economy of the reversion to a feeder port would be (i) \nadditional costs of feeder services to regional hub ports such as Singapore, to connect with \ntrunk route services (at least 20% are estimated to switch to feeders); (ii) longer transit times \nand delays, which are injurious to export markets, especially for textiles, but also for new \nexports that will emerge; (iii) loss of revenues to Sri Lankan terminals from transshipment; and \n(iv) loss of dues paid to SLPA by container vessels. Lower freight costs are expected to result in \nannual savings of $82 million by 2015, and faster delivery times will create annual savings of \n ", "14   \n$49 million by 2015. In addition transshipment traffic will generate direct net annual income to \nterminal  operators  amounting  to  $77  million  by  2015.  The  benefits  of  the  Project  are  the \navoidance of these costs to the economy. The values assigned to the benefits are compared \nwith the total investment cost of $1.3 billion for the Project to 2034. The economic internal rate \nof return is estimated at 17.8%. These assumptions do not include the value to be placed on \nfast, direct shipping services by investors considering alternative countries as locations for \nsetting  up  new  manufacturing  or  distribution  centers.  It  also  does  not  include  loss  of \ninternational investors, who will include frequent, direct shipping services on their checklist of \npreconditions for locating in a country. Thus the economic analysis is conservative. Sensitivity \nand  risk  analyses  indicate  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  robust  under  most \nconditions. The full economic and financial analyses are given in Appendix 12.  \n \n2.  Financial Internal Rate of Return  \n \n43.  The financial analysis assesses the financial sustainability of the harbor infrastructure \nworks component. SLPA incurs the capital investment, and maintenance and repair costs of this \ncomponent. SLPA\u2019s income stream arising from royalties, lease cost, port entry dues, harbor \ntonnage dues, etc. was calculated using the forecasted demand for the Project at rates currently \nbeing paid by SAGT, the existing privately operated terminal in Colombo Port. The financial \ninternal rate of return is approximately 11.5%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 4.4%. The details are given in Appendix 12.  \n \n44.  Financial  analysis  for  the  first  terminal  operator  was  also  conducted  to  assess  the \nviability of private sector development under a BOT concession (Appendix 12). A terminal \noperator incurs the capital investment cost of terminal construction and equipment and terminal \noperation  cost,  and  pays  concession  fees  to SLPA,  while  earning  revenue  from  container \nhandling. The financial internal rate of return is approximately 16.3%, which is in line with \ncomparable new terminal developments internationally.  \n \nC.  Social Impact \n  1.  Poverty and Social Dimensions \n \n45.  The primary area of influence of the Project includes Colombo City and the Colombo \nMetropolitan Region (CMR), comprising Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts. CMR has an \nestimated population of 5.4 million; unemployment rates are lower than the rest of the country, \neven  though  it  has  a  relatively  large  unskilled  youth  labor  force.  In  Sri  Lanka,  poverty  is \nobserved to be greatest in the rural sector (20.8%), followed by the urban sector (6.2%), and the \nestate sector at 4.3%. Across the industry subsectors, the highest poverty is reported in mining \nand quarrying industries; employment in quarrying is characterized by low pay as well as its \ntemporary and irregular nature, making this one of the most impoverished industry groups in Sri \nLanka.  As  per  1996  data,  the  incidence  of  poverty  among  those  engaged  in  mining  and \nquarrying was 41.5%. The next highest incidence of poverty was in agriculture at 28.4%. As per \nDepartment of Census and Statistics (2004), the percentage of poor households living below the \nofficial poverty line7 was 5% for Colombo District, 9.2% for Gampaha, and 17.7% for Kalutara, \ncompared with 19.2% for Sri Lanka as a whole. Although the Western Province in which CMR is \nlocated records the lowest incidence of poverty in absolute numbers, it accounts for the largest \nproportion of the total poor. A closer look at the poverty profile of the city of Colombo reveals \n                                                 \n7  People living in households with real per capita monthly total consumption expenditure below SLRs1,423 are \nconsidered poor (the official poverty line). ", " 15\nabout 1,614 poor urban settlements with about 77,612 families. The urban poor of Colombo \ninclude  those  engaged  in  informal  sector  activities  and  blue  collar  workers  of  the  ports, \nindustries, railways, etc. They are mostly concentrated in the slums, shanties, and low-cost \nhousing in the northern and central parts of the city. Lack of land ownership, poor access to \ndrinking water, poor sanitation facilities, and lack of a regular source of income are a few of the \nmain factors causing poverty.   \n \n46.  Major positive social impacts of the Project are anticipated through the creation of direct \nand indirect employment opportunities during project construction and operation. Jobs during \nconstruction are projected to total 1,950, including 300 for construction of the breakwater and \n550 for staged construction of each of the three terminals. During the operation phase, a total of \n3,870 permanent jobs are estimated to be created after the breakwater is complete and the \nthree  terminals  are  commissioned.  Thus  the  additional  jobs  created  are  expected  to  be \nsignificant. Those who have the advantage of living in proximity to the Project will benefit most, \nas they will access the majority of the temporary employment related to construction of the \nbreakwater and three terminals. People who live close to the quarry sites, land-based transport \nroutes, and barge load-out points will also experience some of the direct impacts of the Project. \nThe income impact of quarrying will be largely attributed to contractors, providers of related \nservices (such as transport), and workers. Workers engaged in quarrying-related activities have \ntraditionally come from unskilled and poor sectors of the community. According to the projected \nestimates for quarrying activities, the predicted opportunities of employment will vary from 4,000 \nto 12,000 per year depending on the contractor\u2019s method of production, i.e., mechanized or \ntraditional. Benefits will also result from increased vessel traffic and other related initiatives \noutside the immediate scope of the Project, such as the development of a free trade zone. \nBenefits to import and export industries are likely to accrue in areas outside the project-affected \narea,  due  to  overall  improvements  in  the  national  economy  from  the  growth  in  shipping \noperations facilitated by the Project. Therefore the Project will provide a source of income and \nnew employment opportunities in a wide range of job categories including unskilled labor, \nparticularly in terminal operations, construction work at the project and quarrying sites for the \nunemployed, low-income earners, and the impoverished. This will lead to poverty reduction. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 13. \n \n  2.  Resettlement  \n \n47.  The Project comprises construction of a new outer basin enclosed by a breakwater and \nserved  by  a  new  navigation  channel.  Material  dredged  from  the  channel  will  be  used  in \nreclamation  to  provide  new  container  berths  with  associated  infrastructure,  buildings,  and \noperation facilities. No land acquisition or negative resettlement impacts are associated with the \nProject. Construction and operation activities will extend seaward from the south end of the \nexisting Colombo Port. Therefore, no additional land will be required by either the Government \nor the private sector. To link the existing port access road to the new harbor, three buildings will \nbe  demolished:  two  government  warehouses  and  one  SLPA  office.  The  warehouses  are \npresently not used and will not be rebuilt. The SLPA office building will be partially affected and \nthus will be partially demolished. The work space of employees will be accommodated in other \noffice buildings within the port area, and thus not involve construction of a new building. The \nexisting port access road will be used for transportation of containers and other imported goods. \nNone of the port access roads will be widened or improved and thus no resettlement will be \nrequired. Furthermore, even after the development and operation of the Project, the transport of \ncontainers and other imported goods within the port-related activity zone will not displace any \nbusiness  establishments  close  to  the  port.  With  regard  to  specific  effects  associated  with \nquarries,  the  quarry  location  will  be  identified  by  the  contractor  only  during  project \n ", "16   \nimplementation prior to the construction of the breakwater. Thus the Government will have to \nensure that any land acquisition and resettlement impact associated with quarrying of rocks will \nrequire the formulation and implementation of appropriate mitigation measures in compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \nD.  Environmental Impact \n48.  The  Project  involves  the  dredging,  reclamation,  and  construction  of  breakwaters, \nterminals, and channels. All of these facilities are located within the SLPA area. The Project is \ncategorized as category A according to ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), \nand the Project is listed as a \u201cprescribed project\u201d according to the National Environmental Act \nNo.  47  (1980)  as  amended.  Therefore  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nprepared.  Since  the  Project  is  located  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Coast  Conservation \nDepartment  (CCD)  and  according  to  the  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Coast  Conservation  Act  57  (1981), \nenvironmental approval and the permit for development activity were obtained from CCD. The \nEIA was approved by CCD on 12 December 2005. The EIA and environmental management \nplan (EMP), in principle, cover all the requirements set out in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines. The EIA was carried out from January 2003 to April 2005. After receiving CCD \napproval of the EIA, the EMP and environmental monitoring plan were prepared in March 2006. \nThe summary EIA (SEIA) was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and disclosed to the public \nthrough ADB\u2019s website on 12 July 2006. \n \n49.  The EIA examined potential environmental impacts associated with the construction and \noperation  of  the  Project.  The  EIA  shows  that  environmental  impacts  will  mostly  relate  to \ndredging and reclamation works. The impacts include (i) increased turbidity; (ii) geotechnical \nstability; (iii) siltation; (iv) change in current pattern; (v) sediment transport; (vi) change in \nadjacent beach; (vii) wave disturbance; (viii) impacts to water, noise, and air quality; and (x) \nimpacts to marine ecology and fisheries. The mitigation measures have been set by following \n\u201cmitigation through design\u201d and therefore the degree of impact could be minimized. Although the \nimpacts are predicted to be insignificant, continuous monitoring especially during construction \nwill be carried out to avoid unexpected impacts and provide remedial measures if necessary. \nPublic consultation was carried out with fisher communities living near the Modera fishing \nharbor, adjoining SLPA port limits. The EIA does not predict any impacts to the livelihood of \nfisherfolk; the modeling studies for physical impacts indicate that the construction works will not \naffect the livelihood of the fisherfolk living near the Modera fish harbor. However, monitoring is \nneeded to ensure that any unexpected impacts are redressed in a timely manner. The EMP and \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan  will  provide  guidance  to  minimize  potential  adverse \nenvironmental impacts related to the Project and to enhance the positive impacts of the Project. \nThe  EMP  and  monitoring  plan  must  be  submitted  to  and  approved  by  CCD  prior  to \ncommencement of the construction work. Adequate funding has been allocated to implement \nthese plans. The EMP and monitoring plan emphasize the need to establish a sustainable \ninstitutional  mechanism  to  ensure  that  these  plans  are  properly  implemented.  The  PIU\u2019s \nenvironmental  engineering  and  coastal  engineering  sections,  as  well  as  the  environmental \nmonitoring committee will be responsible for implementing these plans.  \n \n50.  On  the  basis  of  the  analysis,  no  major  insurmountable  environmental  impacts  are \nassociated with the construction and operation of the Project with the assumption that the \nrecommendations  for  the  mitigation  measures  are  implemented.  Therefore,  environmental \nmonitoring should be carried out to ensure that the EMP is implemented and any unforeseen \nimpacts are managed and mitigated appropriately. \n ", " 17\nE.  Risks \n51.  As  implementation  of  this  Project  will  be  on  a  PPP  basis  with  the  public  sector \nimplementing the harbor infrastructure works component and the private sector implementing \nthe terminal component, the full benefits of the Project are dependent on both components \nbeing implemented on a coordinated basis. The major risk is the lack of a private sector party \nwilling to take up the terminal component concession. This risk has been mitigated by linking \nimplementation of the harbor infrastructure works component to the progress of selecting a \nsuccessful bidder for the terminal concession. The loan will only be effective upon completion of \nthe evaluation of the terminal concession bid and the Government issuing an invitation for \nnegotiations to the successful bidder(s).  \n \n52.  Another risk arises from possible delays to the harbor infrastructure works construction \nprogram. Since completion of part of the breakwater will be necessary before the terminal \nconcession  company  can  start  terminal  construction,  any  delay  in  the  construction  of  the \nbreakwater may give rise to a situation where the terminal concession holder could claim \ncompensation from SLPA. This risk is mitigated by the fact that the construction schedule for the \nbreakwater  will  be  agreed  with  the  prospective  contractor  before  the  terminal  concession \nagreement is signed. Hence a realistic time frame for the breakwater construction can be \nincluded in the concession agreement. Delays during construction will be mitigated given that \nthe Government has agreed that the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) \nconditions will be used and that the construction supervision consultant will be designated as \nthe \u201cEngineer\u201d in the contract to ensure that the consultant has sufficient authority to direct the \ncontractors.  Selection  of  the  detailed  design  consultant  as  the  construction  supervision \nconsultant through single-source selection is an additional measure to mitigate these risks \nbecause the consultant will be familiar with the design and also avoid the issue of split liability \nbetween the detailed design and construction supervision consultants.  \n \n53.  Aside from project risks, delay in the consolidation of the ceasefire in the country may \nalso  have  a  significant  impact.  This  situation  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  Project  to  take \nmitigation measures. However the private sector has been interested in Colombo Port as shown \nby  implementation  of  the  SAGT  project  even  before  the  ceasefire.  The  Government  has \ndeclared  Colombo  Port  a  high-security  zone  and  appointed  the  Sri  Lankan  Navy  as  the \ndesignated authority for port security. The navy has drawn up comprehensive security plans in \naccordance with the requirements of the International Ship and Port Security Convention of the \nInternational Maritime Organization for port security and the special security considerations \nnecessary for Sri Lanka. An assessment of the Colombo Port security system found that port \naccess control is well-planned, coordinated and implemented. Colombo Port is the first port in \nthe  South  Asian  region  to  implement  both  the  container  security  initiative  and  mega  port \ninitiative. There is also excellent military protection against air, land and sea intrusions into \nColombo Port. The security cover will be extended to cover the new facilities as well. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n54.  The Government will ensure that the advisory committee chaired by the Secretary, MPA, \nand including the person holding the post of Director General of the Public Utilities Commission \nas a member, is established and operational within 3 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n ", "18   \n55.  The Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available to the \nProject  when  and  in  the  amounts  required  to  enable  project  agencies  to  discharge  their \nresponsibilities under the Project; and that counterpart funds will be increased if needed to \ncover any shortfall of funds for the completion of the Project. \n \n56.  The Government will ensure that concessionaires for at least the first two new terminals \nunder the Project will be chosen by open competitive bidding processes.  \n \n57.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  SLPA\u2019s  equity  share  in  the  terminal  concession \ncompanies will not exceed 15% of the entire issued capital of such concession company. This \nlimit  will  not  apply  in  the  case  of  a  corporate  entity  registered  by  the  SLPA  and/or  the \nGovernment under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 of Sri Lanka, as amended, for the \npurposes of carrying out container terminal operations.  \n \n58.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  concession  agreements  with  all  terminal \nconcession companies operating under the Project include the provision that each concession \ncompany  will  follow  the  National  Environmental  Act  No.  47  of  1980  as  amended,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and ADB\u2019s Policy \non Indigenous People (1998) in constructing the terminal.  \n \n59.  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure that the (i) project \ndirector is appointed in accordance with the Government\u2019s relevant procedures; (ii) PIU is fully \nstaffed and operational; and (iii) staff necessary for the environmental monitoring in the PIU as \nspecified in the SEIA, are recruited. \n \n60.  Land and Resettlement. To the extent possible, the Government will ensure that the \nProject does not require any land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. The Government will \ncause SLPA to ensure that in case of change in project scope or any unanticipated resettlement \nimpacts (due to quarrying of rocks, widening of access roads, or any other activity) during \nproject  implementation,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  to  the  extent  not \ninconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  In  case  of \nunanticipated resettlement impacts during project implementation, the Government will cause \nSLPA to submit a satisfactory Resettlement Plan to ADB for review prior to the award of harbor \ninfrastructure works contracts. Before any affected person is dispossessed or displaced from its \nassets, the Government will cause SLPA to ensure that they are consulted and compensated at \nreplacement values such that their living standards are not adversely affected, in accordance \nwith the Resettlement Plan.  \n \n61.  Environment.  The Government will cause SLPA to ensure that the Project and all \nproject facilities are developed, conducted, implemented, and maintained in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Environmental  Act  No.  47  of  1980,  as  amended,  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). In case of any discrepancies between the Government\u2019s laws, \nregulations, and/or procedures, and ADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) will \nprevail.  \n \n62.  The  Government  will  cause  SLPA  to  apply  the  environmental  mitigation  measures \nincluded in the EIA and SEIA report for the implementation of the Project, as necessary. The \nGovernment will cause SLPA to monitor, review, and if necessary update the EMP prior to any \nworks to ensure that all negative environmental impacts related to the works are mitigated ", " 19\nproperly. In case of unanticipated negative environmental impacts, the Government will cause \nSLPA (i) to report such impacts to CCD and ADB, and (ii) to provide remedial mitigation \nmeasures to affected people in consultation with CCD and EMC.  \n \n63.  The Government will cause SLPA to conduct regular environmental monitoring. The \nmonitoring report should be submitted to ADB, environmental monitoring committee, and other \nrelevant agencies such as CCD and Central Environmental Authority every 6 months.   \n \n64.  The Government will cause SLPA to provide the contractors and concessionaires with \nthe  EIA  report  and  the  SEIA  including  the  EMP,  and  ensure  that  contractors  and \nconcessionaires implement the required mitigation measures as described in the EMP in a \nsatisfactory manner. In addition, the Government will cause SLPA to ensure that the contractors \nand concessionaires report implementation of the EMP on a regular basis, along with any \ndeviation from the EIA report.    \n \n65.  Social Development and Gender Issues. The Government will cause SLPA to ensure \nthat all works comply with all applicable labor laws; do not employ child labor for construction \nand maintenance activities; encourage employment of the poor, particularly women; provide \nappropriate facilities for women in construction sites; and do not differentiate wages between \nmen and women particularly for work of equal value. The Government will cause SLPA to \nensure that works contracts include a requirement on the part of the contractors to conduct an \ninformation and education campaign on communicable diseases, including but not limited to \nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, for construction workers as a part of the health \nand  safety  program  at  campsites  during  the  construction  period.  The  works  contracts  will \ninclude specific clauses on these undertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored by \nSLPA during project implementation.  \n \n66.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government, through SLPA, will develop a \nproject  performance  management  system,  including  baseline  performance  monitoring  and \nsystematic project performance monitoring. The Government will cause SLPA to carry out \nsurveys  (i)  at  the  start  of  project  implementation  to  establish  baseline  data,  (ii)  at  project \nmidterm review, (iii) at the time of project completion, and (iv) not later than 6 months after \nproject completion, to evaluate the project benefits. Data to be compiled for the purpose of \nproject performance and evaluation will be in a format developed in consultation with ADB. Key \nindicators will be proposed by SLPA and developed in consultation with ADB.  \n  \n67.  Consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, the Government will ensure and will cause SLPA to ensure \nthat the project funds are utilized effectively and efficiently to implement the Project and to \nachieve the Project\u2019s objectives. The Government will cause SLPA to (i) disclose the bid awards \non SLPA\u2019s website; (ii) undertake necessary measures to create and sustain a corruption-free \nenvironment;  (iii)  ensure  that  the  Government\u2019s  Anticorruption  Law  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nAnticorruption (1998, as amended to date), are strictly enforced and are complied with during \nproject  implementation,  and  that  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  are \nincluded in all bidding documents for the Project; (iv) facilitate ADB\u2019s exercise of its right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the Project; (v) conduct periodic inspections on the project contractor\u2019s \nactivities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; and (vi) ensure that contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of SLPA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. The Government will cooperate with any \n ", "20   \naudit and investigation, and extend necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books \nand records, as well as engagement of independent auditors and experts that may be needed \nfor satisfactory completion of such audits and investigations.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n68.  The Government will ensure that \n \n(i)  following an open competitive bidding process, SLPA has issued an invitation to \nthe selected terminal operator(s) prior to commencing the negotiations for the \nterminal BOT concession agreement; and \n \n(ii)  a subsidiary loan agreement is signed between the Government and SLPA, and \nsubmission  of  legal  opinion  on  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  the  Loan \nAgreement, and the Project Agreement in a form and substance satisfactory to \nADB is submitted by the Government and SLPA, respectively, to ADB. \n \nC.  Conditions for Harbor Infrastructure Works Implementation \n \n69.  Prior to the commencement of harbor infrastructure works, the Government will cause \nSLPA to ensure that an updated environmental approval from CCD is obtained. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n70.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Colombo Port Expansion \nProject from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.35% per annum; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and \nProject Agreements presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n     President \n \n \n \n02 February 2007", "Appendix 1        21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImprove Sri Lanka\u2019s  Direct contribution by  National economic data  Economic growth in India \ncompetitiveness in the  ports sector to GDP  and statistics  remains strong to generate \nports sector using  increases by 0.1% by  the cargo base for \npublic-private  2015   transshipment. \npartnership  Foreign direct   \n  investment in ports  Risks \nsector increases by  Investors and shipping lines \napproximately $800  are deterred by security \nmillion by 2024  factors. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n(i) Reduce transport  Export container traffic  SLPA reports and  Other factors affecting \ncosts for exports  handled by Colombo  international shipping  investment and economic \n  Port increases by 9.5%  statistics reports  development are in place. \n  per annum starting in  Terminal development is \n  2011  implemented on schedule. \n(ii) Increase  Transshipment volumes  Present terminals increase \ntransshipment  handled by Colombo  their capacity by improving \ncontainer volume  Port increases by 8%  efficiency. \nhandled by Colombo  per annum starting   \nPort  2011 \nRisk \n \nContainer-handling  Security situation causes risk \n(iii) Increase container-\ncapacity increased from  insurance premiums to \nhandling capacity of \n3.3 million TEU in 2006  increase and thus reduces \nColombo Port  \nto 5.7 million by 2010  transshipment volumes \n \nand 8.1 million TEU by  Colombo Port. \n \n2015   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n(i) Dredging,  Breakwater  SLPA reports and  Contract award for dredging \nreclamation, and  construction completed  consultant reports  and breakwater development \nbreakwater construction  by June 2010  is done on schedule. \ncompleted   Navigational aids  Terminal development is \n  installed by June 2010   implemented on schedule. \n(ii) South terminal  South terminal   \nconstruction completed \nconstruction completed  Risk \n  by October 2010   Delays in construction due to \nweather conditions affects \nconstruction schedule.  \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.

Colombo Port is located in an artificial harbor formed by three breakwaters constructed \nmore than a century ago. The port basin covers 200 hectares and is dredged to depths of up to \n15 meters (m). Access to the harbor is provided on the western and northern sides. The entire \nperimeter of the harbor is occupied with berths, terminals, and vessel-related activities. The port \nis connected to the national rail network; however, virtually all cargo movements in and out of \nthe port are by road transport. Because of the physical constraints, any growth in the capacity of \nthe existing port is severely limited. \n \n2.  The majority of container traffic is handled at three container terminals: \n \n(i)  Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) on the eastern side comprises four berths totaling \n1,292 m, the latest completed in 1996. Depths alongside range from 12 m to 15 \nm. The terminal area covers 45.5 hectares, has 6 super-post panamax and 8 \npanamax gantry cranes, with capacities of 35.5 tons (t) to 41 t service weight limit \nto serve the berths. The backup area varies in width from 330 m to 380 m \nforming the container yard with capacity of 9,800 ground slots, served by 39 \nrubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) and 4 rail-mounted gantry cranes (RMGs). In \naddition, two feeder berths total 352 m with depths of 8 and 9 m. The terminal, \nwhich is owned and operated by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), is fully \nself-contained  with  its  own  reefer  stacks,  offices,  workshops,  amenities,  and \nsubstations.  \n \n(ii)  Unity Container Terminal (UCT) is located at the northern end of the harbor. \nOpened in 2004, it comprises two berths for feeder vessels of 340 m with depths \nalongside of 9 and 11 m, and is served by three panamax gantry cranes of 41 t \nservice weight limit. Eight RTGs serve two stacking areas with 1,020 ground \nslots. SLPA owns and operates the terminal as a satellite terminal for JCT.  \n \n(iii)  South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) located inside the western breakwater \nbecame fully operational in 2003. The terminal comprises three berths totaling \n940 m, all dredged to a depth of 15 m and served by 9 gantry cranes of 40 t \nservice weight limit. The backup area is 200 m wide and the terminal area covers \n22.2 hectares. The container yard is served by 28 RTGs and comprises 5,430 \nground slots. The terminal, which is owned by a private consortium of local and \nforeign parties, is fully self-contained. SLPA has 15% equity in SAGT. \n \n3.  Currently the majority of container operations are organized through the three terminals. \nPresent container throughput for the port as a whole exceeds 2.5 million twenty-foot equivalent \nunits (TEU) per annum and the maximum capacity that could be developed within the confines \nof  the  existing  harbor  after  taking  account  of  improvement  in  all  forms  of  productivity  is \nassessed at 3.7 million TEU per annum. Other cargo-handling facilities operated by SLPA within \nthe harbor include a tanker berth, cement and bulk grain-handling facilities, quays used for \nvehicle imports, general cargo and military goods, and a passenger/cruise berth at the southern \nend of SAGT. \n ", "24  Appendix 3 \n \nB.  Institutional Environment and Regulatory Framework  \n4.  The Ministry of Ports and Aviation is responsible for the ports sector. SLPA is a statutory \ncorporation established under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act (1979) as the owner, operator, \nand sole supplier of marine and cargo-handling services at the country\u2019s ports. The SLPA Act \nendows the Minister of Ports and Aviation and SLPA with wide powers over the sector. The Act \nallows SLPA to concession out terminal operations. SLPA is managed by a board comprising \neight appointees; the minister appoints the chairperson and five of the members.  \nC.  Container Traffic Trends \n5.  Colombo Port established its position as the dominant transshipment port for the Indian \nsubcontinent by the mid 1990s; its success was attributable to several natural advantages: (i) \nlocated near the east\u2013west trunk routes between Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the United States \nEast Coast; (ii) the closest transshipment port to the huge, rapidly expanding markets of the \nIndian  subcontinent;  and  (iii)  a  well-protected  deepwater  harbor.  With  these  advantages, \nColombo\u2019s container traffic rose from 0.6 million TEU in 1990 to 1.7 million TEU in 1997. After \n1997, traffic stagnated, remaining at 1.7 million TEU per annum until 2002.  \n \n6.  The reasons for this, were: (i) Direct calls at Indian ports started around 1997, when \ntraffic volume reached the threshold at which they became economic at Nhava Sheva (previous \nto this India was served by feeders.) The trend to direct calls has since accelerated as a result \nof improvements in port efficiency that followed the construction of a private terminal at Nhava \nSheva in 1999. (ii) New ports started to compete for Colombo\u2019s transshipment traffic. Before \n2000, Dubai and Singapore were the primary competitors; now Port Klang Salalah, Tanjung \nPelepas compete for this business. (iii) Delay of the construction of new capacity until 2001 \nresulted in congestion during 1996\u20132000. (iv) The operation at JCT had no intraport competition \nuntil 2001 and productivity remained below that of its main competitors. (v) No flexibility in \npricing was provided. The port\u2019s limited ability to negotiate prices with shipping lines was a \nmajor  disadvantage  as  competing  ports  such  as  Singapore  and  Port  Klang  cut  prices  to \nunusually low levels. (vi) The 2001 terrorist attack on the airport affected insurance rates.  \n \n7.  The period of stagnation came to an end in 2002. In 2001 new capacity was introduced \nat the privately operated SAGT. The introduction of competition between the terminals promoted \nan  increase  in  port  efficiency;  and  the  peace  process  was  revived  and  the  surcharge  on \ninsurance rates lifted. \n \nTable A3.1: Traffic Figures for Colombo Port \n \nYear  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nTotal (TEU  1.36  1.69  1.71 1.70 1.73 1.72 1.76 1.96 2.24  2.46 3.08\nmillion ) \nAverage  29.2  24.5  1.5 (0.5) 1.6 (0.6) 2.3 11.1 14.3  9.8 25.2\nGrowth (%) \nTEU = twenty-foot equivalent units. \nSource: Sri Lanka Ports Authority (Note restows account for the balance of the traffic). \n ", "    Appendix 3  25 \n8.  The overall container growth in Colombo Port increased by 13.3% in 2004 and 10.5% in \n2005. In the first 6 months of 2006, it increased by 18% compared with the same period in 2005.  \nD.  Capacity Analysis \n \n9.  Additional capacity could be obtained by converting the Bandaranaike Quay (BQ) from \ngeneral cargo to a container feeder berth. Examination of operations at the existing terminals \nindicates  that  capacity  could  be  enhanced  by  measures  such  as  the  introduction  of  new \nequipment, expansion of yard areas, denser stacking, and reduced dwell time. The existing and \nmaximum enhanced capacity of these terminals is shown in Table A3.2.  \n \nTable A3.2 Existing and Potential Enhanced Capacity of Existing Terminals \n(in twenty-foot equivalent units [TEU]) \n \nTerminal  Present Capacity  Potential Enhanced Capacity \nJaya Container Terminal  2,000,000  2,400,000 \nSouth Asia Gateway Terminal  1,000,000  1,200,000 \nUnity Container Terminal  300,000  300,000 \nBandaranaike Quay  0  200,000 \n  Total  3,300,000  4,100,000 \nSource: Sri Lanka Ports Authority. \n \n10.  While  operational  enhancements  can  be  made  to  the  existing  terminals,  they  offer \ndiminishing returns. The area of water in the existing harbor is limited and maneuvering more \nthan one ship at a time in the basin is difficult and dangerous. The capacity of the existing \nharbor is governed by marine operations that limit movements by cargo vessels to 1 per hour, \nrather than the quay cranes or yard capacity. As a result, the practical capacity of the existing \nharbor is estimated to be 3.3 million TEU/year. This capacity is expected to be reached by 2010 \nand additional facilities in a new outer harbor will be required before this figure is reached if \ncongestion and delays are to be avoided. \n \nE.  Operational Efficiency \n \n11.  Crane productivity for mainline container vessels at JCT increased from 15.1 moves per \ncrane per hour in 2001 to 23.4 in 2005. JCT and SAGT now have similar crane productivity. \nAverage service time for containerships at JCT decreased from 17.8 hours in 2001 to 13.8 \nhours in 2005, and average turnaround time for containerships decreased from 23.1 hours in \n2001 to 16.0 hours in 2005. JCT has about 1,500 employees handling a total of 1.7 million TEU. \nSAGT has about 500 employees handling 930,000 TEU. JCT has taken several measures to \nimprove its efficiency and labor productivity. In 2002, an incentive scheme was introduced to \nmotivate workers. This was followed by the introduction of a target bonus to ensure higher \nefficiency. The measures were successful in improving efficiency (Table A3.3). \n \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \n \nTable A3.3: Efficiency Indicators for Jaya Container Terminal \n \nIndicators  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \n1.

Effective market research and business development is fundamental to the success of \nColombo  Port.  Initiatives  to  improve  and  develop  capability  within  the  port  for  focused \naggressive  marketing  are  important  and  require  action  as  soon  as  possible.  All  levels  of \nmanagement and operations have a role in developing traffic and enabling the port to compete \ninternationally. SLPA should increasingly accept the role as landlord and focus on promoting the \nport as a whole. Detailed analysis of transshipment potential is required. A significant amount of \ndata has been obtained and databases developed during the preparation of long-term traffic \nforecasts. This data provides information for analysis, which is essential for preparing marketing \nplans. Development in competing ports must be closely monitored and market niches identified.  \n \n13.  The development of strategy is critical to business planning. It requires a continuous and \niterative analysis of relevant issues. These include clear identification of services that can be \ncompetitively offered, tariff and pricing strategies to win trade, promotion of selected strategies \nthrough  strong  marketing  activity,  direct  engagement  of  target  clients,  and  finally  the \nmeasurement  and  response  to  marketing  initiatives.  Significant  volumes  of  Bay  of  Bengal \ncontainer cargo are transshipped through Singapore or Port Klang for Europe and the East \nCoast of North America. .This is probably more expensive than transshipment at Colombo, and \nwill take longer. Colombo should investigate ways of supporting and encouraging more frequent \nand more regular feeder services, notably to Chittagong. To do this it should consider offering \nother special deals for this specific cargo. Such actions could initiate a swing back to Colombo. \nTrade lanes and Indian subcontinent coasts offer opportunities, however they are not sales \ntargets. Target customers are shipping lines, who need not restrict themselves to particular \nlocations. Colombo must therefore offer price and service packages designed to meet the needs \nof particular shipping lines in the context of the full range of container shipping services they \nwish to offer their customers. Colombo offers a real alternative for European and Far Eastern \ncargoes. The port is a national asset, which should promote contacts with local exporters, \nimporters, and development agencies by demonstrating to them how the port is able to assist \nthem.  The  growth  of  a  national  cargo  base  is  an  important  objective  and  direct  foreign \ninvestment in local industrial export-oriented business is to be encouraged. \n ", "    Appendix 4  27 \n2005 SUMMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR  \nSRI LANKA PORTS AUTHORITY \n \nSRI LANKA PORTS AUTHORITY \nCOMBINED INCOME STATEMENT \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2005 \n       \nSLPA \nDescription  Note   2005    2004  \n SLRs   SLRs  \nOperations Revenue from Port Activities  1.1.2  18,246,333,789   15,805,541,899 \nOther Revenue from Port Activities  1.3  2,303,093,940   2,055,349,142 \nTotal Revenue     20,549,427,729   17,860,891,041 \nOperations Expenses  2.1  (6,670,347,616)  (5,054,347,809) \nRepair and Maintenance Expenses  2.2  (2,109,995,895)  (1,384,200,444) \nAdministration Expenses  2.3  (4,403,022,377)  (4,672,414,643) \n      (13,183,365,888)  (11,110,962,896) \nOperating Profit     7,366,061,841   6,749,928,145 \nInterest on Government Loans  2.4  (1,186,010,675)  (1,356,211,293) \nVoluntary Retirement Scheme Expenses  2.5     (848,873) \nProfit before Foreign Exchange Gain/(Loss)     6,180,051,166   5,392,867,979 \nForeign Exchange Gain/(Loss)     7,059,437,549    (5,665,517,002) \nProfit before Tax and after Foreign Exchange Gain/(Loss)     13,239,488,715   (272,649,022) \nSpecial Levy     (115,000,000)   (95,000,000) \nLess: Income Tax, Deemed Dividend Tax, and Social Responsibility Levy  2.6   (3,050,742,665)  (2,700,517,736) \nNet Profit (Loss) before Extraordinary Items and after Tax     10,073,746,050   (3,068,166,758) \nLess: Extraordinary Items: Tsunami Provision  2.7  (1,820,521)  (162,146,782) \nNet Profit (Loss) after Extraordinary Items and after Tax     10,071,925,530   (3,230,313,541) \nCumulative Profit (Loss) B/F  2.8  (6,646,423,206)  (3,416,109,665) \nRetained Profit and Loss     3,425,502,323   (6,646,423,206) \nAmount Transferred to Loan Redemption Reserve     (3,425,502,323)    \nBalance Profit/Loss C/F      (0)   (6,646,423,206) \n( ) = negative. \nSLPA = Sri Lanka Ports Authority. \nSource: Sri Lanka Ports Authority \n \n ", "28  Appendix 5 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO SRI LANKA PORTS AUTHORITY  \n1974\u20132006 \n \n    Amount   \n    ($ million  Year of \nSource  Project  equivalent)  Approval \nADB  Colombo Port Efficiency and Expansion Project  10.00  2001 \n \n       \nJapan  SL-P4: Port of Colombo Expansion   35.90  1980 \n(JBIC)  SL-P7: Port of Colombo Expansion (II)   28.30  1984 \n \nSL-P8: Port of Colombo Expansion (III)   10.24  1985 \n \nSL-P12: Port of Colombo Expansion (IV)  14.11  1987 \n \n  SL-P23: Port of Colombo Extension (I)  40.15  1990 \n  SL-P27: Port of Colombo Extension (II)  78.41  1991 \n \nSL-P30: Port of Colombo Extension (III)  158.25  1992 \n \nSL-P33: Port of Colombo Extension (IV)  74.18  1993 \n \n  SL-P41: Port of Colombo North Pier Development   56.72  1994 \n  SL-P46: Port of Colombo North Pier Development  58.92  1995 \n  (II)     \nSL-P67: Urgent Upgrading of Colombo Port  18.59  1999 \nSL-P85: Galle Port Development   130.00  2006       \n \n \nDenmark  Oluvil Port Development   35.00  2003 \n       \nNorway  Automation of Port of Galle  0.10  2004 \n       \nNetherlands  Refloating of Dredger at Port of Galle  1.00  2005 \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation, SL = Sri Lanka.  \nNote: Applied exchange rate: $1 = SLRs = 100, monthly rates published by Bank of Japan. \nSource: Sri Lanka Ports Authority  \n ", "    Appendix 6  29 \nPROPOSED TERMS OF REFERENCE  \nFOR THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PORT COMPETITION \n \n1.  As a prelude to the enactment of a full-fledged Port Competition Act, the Government \nhas agreed to establish an advisory committee1 to enhance the operating environment for the \nports sector and to ensure a competitive environment for terminal operators. The committee will \nhave an advisory role to redress grievances of port operators related to unfair competition to \nensure  a  healthy  competitive  environment  for  terminal  operators  and  promote  intra-port \ncompetition when two or more different terminal operators within the same port compete for the \nsame markets. The committee will advise the Minister of Ports and Aviation on actions to be \ntaken in case of anticompetitive behavior in port-related activities.  \n \n2.  Composition.  The  committee  will  be  established  under  the  Ministry  of  Ports  and \nAviation (MPA), and be chaired by the Secretary, MPA. It will comprise (i) the Secretary, \nMinistry of Trade and Commerce; (ii) a representative from the shipping and maritime transport \ncommunity that does not have any equity interest in any terminal operator; and (iii) the person \nholding  the  post  of  Director  General  of  the Public  Utilities  Commission  of  Sri Lanka.  The \ncommittee will be assisted by at least one administrative staff to provide logistical assistance. \n \n3.  Functions. The committee will function with fairness, impartiality, and independence in a \ntimely and transparent manner. Its functions will include the following: \n \n(i)  Investigate  complaints  made  by  any  port  operator  on  alleged  or  suspected \noffenses related to port business. \n(ii)  Prevent anticompetitive practices in all aspects of port business including abuse \nof dominant position to prevent or lessen competition, cross-subsidization of \nmonopoly  services  to  competitive  services  in  a  manner  that  threatens \ncompetitors,  price-fixing  among  competitors,  and  setting  of  prices  in  a \nnoncompetitive area of port business in a manner that threatens the relevant \nport\u2019s ability to compete against other transshipment ports within the region.  \n(iii)  Investigate any planned merger between (a) a marine service provider and a port \nservice  provider;  (b)  a  marine  service  provider  with  another  marine  service \nprovider; and (c) a port service provider with another port service provider. \n(iv)  Investigate any complaint by any port operator prior to or upon a merger to \ndecide whether the merger is compatible with the promotion of fair competition. \n \n4.  Procedure  for  Investigating  Complaints. Any affected port operator may lodge a \ncomplaint in writing to the committee, which will acknowledge receipt of the complaint within 3 \nworking days. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the committee will have from 2 to 8 \nweeks to receive details, investigate facts, and reach a decision. It may conduct a hearing or \nconsult with technical experts to determine the nature of the offence and appropriate redress \nmechanism. \n \n5.  Once investigated, the committee will advise the minister responsible for ports on the \ncourse of action to be taken to address the issue. The MPA will advise the complainant of the \noutcome of the complaint. The presence of this committee will not preclude the right of any \naggrieved party to seek legal remedy that may be available under the existing laws of Sri Lanka. \n \n6.  Details of committee composition and procedures will be strengthened by the advisory \ncommittee itself within 3 months of loan effectiveness. Once established, the committee will \nprovide port operators with its detailed rules and procedures by letter.  \n                                                 \n1  Approved by Cabinet decision PF/05/v/1/250 on 11 October 2006. \n ", "30  Appendix 7 \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF  \nHARBOR INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS COMPONENT AND COST ESTIMATES \n \n1.  Harbor. The Colombo Port Expansion Project involves the development of a greenfield \nsite south of the existing port facilities. The Project is designed to accommodate vessels with an \noverall length of 400 meters (m), beam of 55 m and draft of 16 m. The Project will be created by \nconstructing a major new breakwater to the west of the existing harbor and a smaller secondary \nbreakwater. The harbor will be laid out with three lengths of quay forming a U-shaped basin \nopen to the north, each providing a 1,200 m long container terminal giving a nominal three \nberths of 400 m length and a depth alongside of 18 m. A main breakwater from Galbokka Point \nat the southwestern corner of the existing harbor runs westward to a water depth of about 18 m \nand then turns northward following the 18 m contour. A secondary breakwater combined with a \nsmall boat harbor extends from near the entrance to the existing harbor. Together they protect \nthe basin and quays from waves. \n \n2.  Channel  and  Navigation.  The  Project  has  been  planned  so  that  it  can  be  safely \naccessed by all sizes of container vessels. In addition, improvements in the navigation approach \nchannel to the existing harbor are proposed. The phase 1 harbor basin will be dredged to a \ndepth of 18 m, and will include sufficient space for vessels to come to a halt and to turn. Vessels \nwill approach via a new two-way channel with a depth of 20 m and a minimum width of 570 m. \nThe approach to the existing main harbor entrance will be realigned to suit the new layout and \nto provide a better approach for an improved one-way transit of vessels. Preliminary studies in \naccordance with the recommendations of the International Navigation Association (PIANC) were \nconducted to size the channels. The outer approach channel has been sized for two-way traffic \nto accommodate the existing harbor and proposed changes. The short approach to the existing \nharbor is and will remain for one-way traffic only. The existing submarine pipeline to the main \ncrude oil single point mooring will be lowered where it crosses the new dredged areas. \n \n3.  The principal dimensions of the channels, basins and turning areas are \n \n(i)  Main channel: width: 570 m with additional width on the inside of bends; depth: \n20 m below local datum; \n(ii)  Secondary channel: width: 340 m (reducing to 250 m near the harbor entrance); \ndepth: 16 m below local datum; and \n(iii)  South Harbor Basin; depth: 18 m below local datum with provision to deepen to \n23 m; turning circle: 600 m (1.5 times the length of the design ship). \n \n4.  Modern navigation aids will be installed along the new channels. To ensure that all \nvessel operations in the project area and the existing port are safely and efficiently carried out, a \nnew marine operations center is proposed near the entrance to the Project. This includes \nfacilities for berthing tugs and other harbor craft, a look-out station, and a control room for a new \nvessel traffic management system serving the whole port. \n \n5.  Ancillary  Facilities. The harbor will include common user areas for each terminal, \nlocated outside the container yard for increased safety and security. These may include lorry \ngates and waiting areas; X-ray and scanning facilities; parking for equipment and cars; and \nbuildings for terminal offices, equipment maintenance and staff amenities, empty container \nstorage, container repairs, and bonded areas. In addition, a number of facilities are required to \nprovide  basic  infrastructure  to  all  terminals.  Operated  by  or  on  behalf  of  Sri  Lanka  Ports \nAuthority (SLPA), these may include (i) an electrical power plant, water main and storage tanks, ", "    Appendix 7  31 \nand sewage treatment plant, all located at the southern end of the new development; (ii) a \ncontainer lorry access road to the Project, approached via an upgraded port perimeter road that \nwill serve all the terminals; and (iii) an access road for personnel and other noncontainer traffic \nto the south of existing port gate No 1. SLPA is expected to benefit from a new office building \nnear the entrance to the project facilities and a new marine operations center at the northern \nend of the eastern quay that will include sheltered berthing facilities for the flotilla serving South \nHarbor. Port users and Customs will also be accommodated in new facilities near the SLPA \noffice. \n \n6.  Cost Estimates.

Traffic Forecasts \n \n1.  The forecast presented is based on analysis of the domestic and transshipment market, \nwhich is subdivided into Indian subcontinent (ISC) transshipment and others. The forecast \nmodel calculates a transshipment share of the ISC market and assesses Colombo\u2019s share. \nBecause Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Nhava Sheva, accounts for half of the ISC market and has \nmoved from 40% to 70% direct calls in 5 years, the transshipment share available has fallen \nrapidly to 45% of the total container traffic. The forecast anticipates the share of the ISC \ntransshipment market to continue to decrease. To date, no carrier has been limited in its choice \nof vessel size at an Indian port. However, quite soon as volumes increase and justify direct calls \nwith bigger ships, size will become a factor. Despite dredging programs and port building, \ncarriers will be constrained by size at Indian ports and Colombo\u2019s advantage is that it will be \nable to handle the largest vessels. The demand estimates for the Project take account of the \nport expansion plans of neighboring countries such as India, as well as the opinion of the \ninternational shipping industry regarding the potential of Colombo Port to be a transshipment \nhub port in light of these plans. Shipping industry representatives state that while western Indian \ncargo most likely would be lost to Colombo, nevertheless Colombo is in a good position to \ncapture eastern and southern Indian transshipment cargo provided that it expands its capacity. \nThe demand forecast in the project viability analysis therefore assumes that Colombo Port will \nhave a 30% market share of ISC cargo. Direct, not diverted, services are most important; in the \nfuture larger vessels will have greater difficulty diverting because of the traffic volume involved. \nThe container traffic forecast for national imports and exports is shown in Table A12.1. \n \nTable A12.1: Forecast of Domestic Container Traffic at Colombo Port  \n(\u2018000 twenty-foot equivalent units) \n \n2002  2003  2004  2005  2010  2015  2020  2030  2040 \nActual  Forecast \n546a  601  661  727  1,118  1,643  2,414  4,975  9,786 \n         Note: 2002\u20132040: unconstrained by port capacity limitations. \n  a  Used as base for projection. \nSource: Consultant estimates \n \n2.

Table \nA12.3 provides an assessment of the transshipment share of the ISC container market. The \npotential transshipment share of the ISC market is expected to decline in the short term as a \nresult of increased direct calls. The decline rate is expected to fall in the medium term as larger \nships are introduced and then it will increase again. \n ", "42  Appendix 12 \n \nTable A12.2: Forecast of Indian Subcontinent Container Traffic \n(\u2018000 twenty-foot equivalent units) \n \n2002  2003  2004  2005  2010  2015  2020  2030  2040 \nActual  Forecast \n4,739  5,274  5,871  6,536  10,643  15,790  21,652  40,902  77,707 \n       Note: Total including direct and transshipped containers. \nSource: Consultant estimates  \n \nTable A12.3: Share Adjustment Indian Subcontinent Transshipment \n \nPeriod  % Share Adjustment Indian Subcontinent   Transshipment Share (%) \n2003\u20132008  2 annual reduction  33 by 2008 \n2009\u20132011  1 annual rise (by advent of Suez max ships)  36 by 2011 \n2012\u20132040  1 annual reduction  17 by 2040 \nSource: Consultant estimates  \n \nTable A12.4: Forecast of Transshipment Indian Subcontinent Container Traffic \n(\u2018000 twenty-foot equivalent units) \n \n2002 \nYear   2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010 \nActual \nIndia, Bangladesh, \nPakistan container \ntraffic   4,739  5,274  5,871 6,536  7,203  7,940  8,754  9,652  10,643 \nPercentage \ntranshipped via \nColombo, \nSingapore, Salalah, \netc (%)  45  43  41 39  37  35  33  34  35 \n  Total  2,133  2,268  2,407 2,549  2,665  2,779  2,889  3,282  3,725 \n                 \nYear   2011  2012  2013 2014  2015    2020  2030  2040 \nIndia, Bangladesh, \nPakistan container \ntraffic   11,513  12,457  13,479 14,588  15,790  21,652  40,902  77,707 \nPercentage \ntranshipped via \nColombo, \nSingapore, Salalah, \netc (%)  36  35  34 33  32  27  22  17 \n   Total  4,145  4,360  4,583 4,814  5,053  5,846  8,988  13,210 \nSource: Consultant estimates  \n ", "Appendix 12         43 \n3.

Costs \n4.  On the basis of the economic and financial assessments, the basic infrastructure works \nand one terminal are assumed to be initially constructed, and two terminals will be subsequently \nconstructed to meet the forecasted demand of the Colombo Port Expansion Project.  \n \n5.  Capital Investment Costs. Infrastructure costs are based on detailed design currently \nunder preparation. Alternative designs were considered for each project component, and least-\ncost technical solutions were identified by comparing benefits and costs of mutually exclusive \ndesign options. The breakwater costs are based on a rubble mound structure, which minimizes \nthe use of rock by using concrete amour units and maximizes the use of dredged sand in the \ncore of the structure. This structure is less costly than an alternative caisson structure by 27% \nper meter for this Project. Sand for reclamation will be taken from the access channels and \nharbor basin. The actual equipment to be used in the terminal will depend on the preference of \nthe terminal operator. However, for costing purposes, each terminal is assumed to have a quay \n ", "44  Appendix 12 \nlength of 1,200 m and to be operated by 12 quayside cranes and 40 rubber-tired gantry cranes.  \nThe quay walls are costed as low reflective structures consisting of a reinforced concrete deck \nsupported on tubular steel piles. The total cost of the Project is estimated to be $1.3 billion. The \ndetails of the cost estimates are given in Table A12.7. \n \n6.  Operating Costs. Operating costs are divided into variable costs, costs that would vary \nwith the utilization of the terminal, and fixed costs that are independent of terminal throughput. \nTables A12.8 and A12.9 set out the variable and fixed costs. \n \nTable A12.7: Estimated Project Capital Costs \nCost Category  Cost  \n($ million) \nA.

Economic Evaluation \n \n  1.  Justification for Public Sector Role  \n \n7.  Colombo Port is ideally situated to be the transshipment center for South Asia, and \nmaintaining its status as a hub port is vital for the Sri Lankan economy. This would require \nbuilding  additional  container  terminals  since  the  existing  container  terminals  are  quickly \nreaching capacity. Container terminals are a revenue-generating infrastructure project and can \nattract private sector investment. However the new container terminals can only be built outside \nthe area protected by the existing breakwater. A new breakwater is therefore a prerequisite for \nbuilding the new terminals. Breakwaters are a \u201clumpy\u201d investment and the site conditions are \nsuch that the minimum size of the breakwater that can be built would be sufficient to protect \nthree container terminals. However demand considerations mean that the container terminals \nwould be needed only in phases. Thus no single prospective bidder for a terminal would be \nwilling to shoulder the cost of building a breakwater sufficient to protect three terminals. The \nproject  breakwater  is  therefore  a  public  good  that  will  not  by  itself  attract  private  sector \ninvestment and thus has to be provided by the public sector.  \n \n  2.  Economic Benefits and Costs \n \n8.  The economic evaluation compares the economic costs and economic benefits of the \nProject from the viewpoint of the national economy. Economic analysis is based on the scenario \nthat three terminals will be sequentially developed to meet forecasted demands by taking into \naccount the strategy of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to provide basic infrastructure to \n ", "46  Appendix 12 \naccommodate three terminals. The main consequence for the economy if the Project is not built \nwould be the loss of the frequent, fast, direct shipping services used by exporters and importers. \nWithout investment in the South Harbor, Colombo would lose its transshipment traffic; and if the \nport no longer operates as a transshipment hub port, it would soon lose its direct calls on trunk \nline routes. Local traffic is not high enough to attract direct calls by trunk line ships. Colombo \nwould eventually become a feeder port, served by a combination of feeder ships and multiport \nservices with relatively long transit times for the ports with lower traffic volumes.  \n \n9.  The Sri Lankan economy will experiences several costs if Colombo Port were to lose its \ntransshipment hub status. The benefits to the Sri Lankan economy are thus the avoidance of \nthese costs. The first economic benefit of the Project would be the avoidance of the cost of \nhaving to use feeders. The average cost of feeding to/from Singapore and other regional \ntransshipment hubs would be around $250 in balanced international shipping markets. With \nsurplus capacity this price will decline; in period of shortages it will increase. Furthermore, the \nfeeder cost will be absorbed by the shipping lines where they have to compete with fast, direct \nservices. But when the fast, direct services are phased out, the feeder cost will normally be \npassed on in full. The feeder cost would be incurred by most but not all containers on long \ndistance routes. Freight costs are an important factor in key Sri Lankan exports, e.g., textiles, \nwhich make up more than 50% of Sri Lankan exports. SLPA records show that about one third \nof Colombo\u2019s imports and exports are on long distance routes, excluding some of the longer \nintra-Asian routes. A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development1 \nfinds  that  freight  costs  from  Asian  countries  already  account  for  a  higher  percentage  of \nAmerican market textile import costs at about 6% compared with about 3% for textile imports \nfrom Latin America and the Caribbean. Some of these long distance routes are assumed to be \nserved by ships on multiport itineraries calling at Indian subcontinent ports; but that the majority, \n20% of exports and imports conservatively estimated, would use feeders to a regional hub if the \nProject is not implemented. If the Project is implemented and Colombo Port retains its direct \nservices, conservative estimates are that an average feeder cost of $250 per TEU on 20% of \nexports and imports would be saved. This benefit is estimated at $82 million in 2015, which \nwould otherwise have to be absorbed by exporters to maintain their market competitiveness.  \n \n10.  The value to shippers of direct, fast, frequent services can be measured by willingness \nto pay. A good example is the express service currently provided by one of the major shipping \nlines, giving fast transit on the route from the People\u2019s Republic of China via Singapore to \nEurope. This service is particularly effective in getting garments to retail outlets faster than \ncompeting services in minimal time. The shipping lines are in practice able to obtain a large \npremium of approximately $500/TEU for the fast transit time. Longer transit times and delays \nare injurious to export markets, especially for textiles. Textiles accounted for 52% of Sri Lankan \nexports in 2002, and exporters confirm that a substantial proportion of these products have to \nget to retail outlets fast. The importance of the time factor in future textile trade has also been \nconfirmed. The study (footnote 1) found that lead time will play a crucial role in determining \ninternational competitiveness because of trade-offs between low wage costs and time factors. \nThe study found that closeness to a large consumer market, e.g., United States or Western \nEurope provides a competitive edge in the highly competitive, time-sensitive, and fashion-\noriented clothing market, and also for new exports that will emerge. The cost to the economy is \nestimated conservatively on the basis that 10% of the total traffic would be willing to pay $300 \nper TEU for fast, direct, reliable service (in practice, premiums of $500 per TEU are being paid \nat present). On this basis the benefit of retaining direct services is estimated at $49 million in \n                                                 \n1  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2004. A New World Map in Textile and Clothing: \nAdjusting to Change. Paris. ", "Appendix 12         47 \n2015. Textile manufacturers confirm that this is a good illustration of willingness to pay for the \nmore time-sensitive national containers.  \n \n11.  Container terminals obtain additional revenue from transshipment. Without the Project, \ntransshipment  traffic  would  almost  certainly  decline  rapidly  before  2010,  rather  than  being \nsqueezed out gradually by imports and exports. However, for the purpose of economic analysis, \nthe  most  conservative  scenario  in  which  existing  facilities  still  handle  the  considerable \ntransshipment traffic is applied. The tariff for transshipment is assumed as $29 per TEU by \ntaking into account the international hub port competition to attract transshipment. With the \nProject, this transshipment revenue, $35 million in 2015, would be retained. In addition to the \nterminal operator, SLPA itself earns revenue from handling transshipment cargo. The revenues \nto SLPA come from harbor entering dues and harbor tonnage dues. They average $3 per TEU. \nAdditional revenue to SLPA would result from providing marine services, but this would be offset \nby costs and are not included here. These two revenues items are gains to the country as they \ncome from providing transshipment services to cargo originating outside Sri Lanka and destined \nfor places outside Sri Lanka as well.  \n \n12.  The costs of other items, e.g., freight costs, feeder shipping costs, and terminal and port \ncharges, are determined in the international competitive market. Thus, they are assumed to be \nfree of distortions and so shadow pricing is not necessary for measuring their economic costs. \nAccordingly, the avoidance of these costs reflects true economic benefits. (The development of \nGalle  Port mainly  aims  to  accommodate  bulk  cargoes and  does  not  decrease  the  project \nbenefits discussed here.) The values assigned to the benefits are compared with economic \ncosts of the project investment up to 2034. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at \n17.5% (Table A12.10). \n \n \nTable A12.10: Annual Benefit and Cost Streams for the Project \n($ \u2019000) \n               \nCost                                       Benefit \nBenefit-\nAdditional \nCost \nCapital     O&M       Total       Avoidance of  Revenue from  Total \nStream \n Year  Cost  Cost  Cost  Feeder Cost  Transship  Benefit \n2007  79,000  0  79,000 0 0  0  (79,000)\n2008  210,667  0  210,667 0 0  0  (210,667)\n2009  210,667  0  210,667 0 0  0  (210,667)\n2010  131,667  12,446  144,112 89,453 9,425  98,878  -45,235\n2011  0  16,031  16,031 96,609 17,988  114,596  98,565\n2012  0  18,703  18,703 104,338 22,843  127,181  108,478\n2013  0  21,602  21,602 112,685 27,920  140,604  119,002\n2014  37,625  24,746  62,371 121,699 33,220  154,920  92,548\n2015  100,333  28,153  128,486 131,435 38,747  170,182  41,696\n2016  100,333  31,340  131,673 141,950 42,920  184,870  53,197\n2017  62,708  44,659  107,368 153,306 47,188  200,494  93,126\n2018  0  48,505  48,505 165,571 51,544  217,115  168,610\n2019  0  52,630  52,630 178,816 55,983  234,800  182,169\n2020  0  57,054  57,054 193,122 60,497  253,619  196,565\n ", "48  Appendix 12 \nCost                                       Benefit \nBenefit-\nAdditional \nCost \nCapital   O&M   Total   Avoidance of  Revenue from  Total \nStream \n Year  Cost  Cost  Cost Feeder Cost Transship  Benefit \n2021  40,500  62,528  103,028 208,571 67,202  275,774  172,746\n2022  108,000  68,465  176,465 225,257 74,240  299,497  123,032\n2023  108,000  74,904  182,904 243,278 81,626  324,904  142,000\n2024  67,500  92,963  160,463 262,740 89,376  352,116  191,653\n2025  0  100,717  100,717 283,759 97,506  381,265  280,548\n2026  0  108,690  108,690 303,622 106,034  409,656  300,966\n2027  0  117,281  117,281 324,876 114,975  439,851  322,570\n2028  0  124,584  124,584 347,617 119,298  466,915  342,331\n2029  0  126,673  126,673 371,950 109,161  481,111  354,438\n2030  0  128,800  128,800 397,987 98,322  496,309  367,509\n2031  0  130,965  130,965 425,846 86,733  512,579  381,614\n2032  0  133,170  133,170 455,655 74,342  529,997  396,827\n2033  0  135,414  135,414 487,551 61,093  548,644  413,229\n2034  0  137,699  137,699 521,679 46,926  568,605  430,906\nEconomic Internal Rate Of Return   17.76%\nO&M = operations and maintenance \nSources: Consultant estimates, ADB staff estimates. \n \n13.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \nThe Colombo Port Expansion Project is to promote economic growth by improving Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness in the \nports sector through expanding Colombo Port using public-private partnership. The Project will facilitate economic \ngrowth by enhancing national competitiveness in international trade via lower costs and faster delivery, generate \nadditional income from transshipment, and provide incomes from construction. In addition it will enhance export and \nimport intensity of the national economy and provide economywide efficiency benefits. The Project will contribute \nsignificantly to poverty reduction, primarily by creating income and employment opportunities for low income earners \nlinked with the export-import trade sector of the economy and lead to poverty reduction in the quarrying industry.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                     Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe Project comprises construction of a new outer basin enclosed by a breakwater and served by a new navigation \nchannel. Material dredged from the channel will be used in reclamation to provide new container berths with \nassociated infrastructure, buildings, and operation facilities. The project-affected area includes (i) Colombo City, \nconsidered to be the main activity zone of the Project; (ii) Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR) comprising Colombo, \nGampaha and Kalutara districts; and (iii) quarry sites, including immediate neighborhoods, road corridors, and loading \npoints. CMR has an estimated population of 5.4 million and accounts for over 70% of the country's industrial activities, \n53% of industrial employment, and 31% of total employment. The three CMR districts have relatively high population \ndensities.1 Between districts, the highest urban population density of 54.7% is concentrated in Colombo district due to \nthe increased opportunities of employment in the garment industry, banking, services, and informal sectors. The CMR \neconomy has undergone substantial change over the past three decades. In terms of job formation, it has grown much \nfaster than the nation as a whole. Unemployment rates in CMR are lower than the rest of the country, although the \narea has a relatively large unskilled youth labor force. Of those employed, the average monthly income in Sri Lanka \nwas estimated at SLRs3,056 for 2002, while the corresponding figure for CMR was SLRs4,993. Each of the districts in \nCMR also had average incomes above the national average: Colombo SLRs4,923, Gampaha SLRs4,013, and \nKalutara SLRs3,046.  \n \nModera and Mattakkuliya, major fishing areas in Colombo District, are located next to the Project. The coastal stretch \nsouth of the Project (Agulana, Dehiwala, Egoda Uyana,Lunawa, Mount Levinia, Moratuwa, Rathmalana, etc.) also \nincludes traditional fishing areas. Of these, Moratuwa, Dehiwala Modera, and Mattakkuliya were affected to varying \nextents by the Asian tsunami, but generally these areas were less affected than communities further south and east. \nFishery communities largely live in dwelling units constructed on beaches. The number of households engaged in \nfishing in these areas appears to be declining not only because of the preference for alternative employment, but also \ndeclining fish resources. Just over 2,000 households are now engaged in fishing. The majority of fishing crafts have \noutboard motors that are used mainly in inshore areas. The existing port and its approaches have a security zone \nwithin which fishing is not allowed. While the nation as a whole will experience the economic impacts of the Project, \nthe existing concentration of economic activity in CMR is likely to function as an important factor in mediating the \nsocial impacts of the Project in the surrounding areas. Thus, CMR residents will experience most of its social impacts \nemanating from economic, employment, trade, and transportation growth.  \n \nIn Sri Lanka, poverty is greatest in the rural sector (20.8%), followed by the urban sector (6.2%), and the estate sector \n(4.3%). Across the industry subsectors, the highest poverty is reported in mining and quarrying industries as \nemployment in quarrying is characterized by its low pay as well as its temporary and irregular  nature,. As per 1996 \ndata, the incidence of poverty among those engaged in mining and quarrying was 41.5%. The next highest incidence \n                                                 \n1  Data from 2001 shows a density of 299 people per square kilometer for the country as a whole and 3,303 for \nColombo, 1,539 for Gampaha, and 1,539 for Kaluthara districts. ", "  Appendix 13        55   \nof poverty was in agriculture at 28.4%. As per Department of Census and Statistics 2004, the percentage of poor \nhouseholds living below the official poverty line2 is 5% for Colombo District, 9.2% for Gampaha, and 17.7% for \nKalutara compared with 19.2% for Sri Lanka. Although the Western province in which the CMR is located, records the \nlowest incidence of poverty, it accounts for the largest proportion of the total poor. The poverty profile of the city of \nColombo reveals about 1,614 poor urban settlements with about 77,612 families. The urban poor of Colombo include \nthose engaged in informal sector activities and blue collar workers of the ports, industries, railways, etc. They are \nmostly concentrated in the slums, shanties, and low cost housing in the northern and central parts of the city. Lack of \nland ownership, poor access to drinking water, poor sanitation facilities, and lack of a regular source of income are a \nfew of the main factors causing poverty.  \n \nImpacts of the Project will be distributed differently in different geographic areas and over time. Communities living \nadjacent to the Project will experience the most impacts. The major positive social impacts are anticipated to arise \nthrough the creation of direct and indirect employment opportunities during project construction and operation. \nEmployment opportunities are likely to occur due to (i) construction and operation related work; (ii) quarrying, and (iii) \npotential additional employment from benefits arising from increased vessel traffic and other development initiatives. \nThus the additional jobs are expected to be significant. The majority of the temporary employment related to \nconstruction of the breakwater and three terminals will be accrued by those living in CMR. About half of the population \nin Colombo live in slums and the poor who are underemployed or unemployed will have access to temporary \nemployment opportunities created by the Project. Similarly, those residing in the surrounding areas will compete for \nmore regular employment opportunities arising out of the Project. During project operation only a fraction of the new \njobs are expected to be executive positions, the largest proportion of workers employed will be in administration \n(clerks,  supervisors,  storekeeper,  typist,  etc),  followed  by  technical  (crane  operator,  vehicle  drivers  etc)  and \nnontechnical positions (dockers, cleaners, etc.). Areas where rock  will be sourced for the construction of the \nbreakwater will be determined by the appointed contractor. However, people who live close to the quarry sites, land-\nbased transport routes, and barge load-out points will experience some of the direct impacts of the Project. The \nincome impact of quarrying will be largely attributed to contractors, providers of related services (such as transport), \nand workers. Those working in the quarrying industry are recognized as belonging to one of the most impoverished \nemployment sectors in the country, due to low wages and discontinuous work. As such, this group will benefit \nsubstantially from any employment opportunities. As per the projected estimates for quarrying activities, the predicted \nopportunities of employment would vary from 4,000 to 12,000 per year depending on the contractor\u2019s method of \nproduction either mechanized or traditional. Increased vessel traffic and other related initiatives outside the immediate \nscope of the Project, such as the development of a free trade zone will also create benefits. Benefits to import and \nexport industries are likely to accrue in areas outside the project-affected area, due to overall improvements in the \nnational economy from the growth in shipping operations facilitated by the Project. The potential efficiency gains of the \nProject will have an impact on export/import trade sectors and thereby will also offer significant benefits to low income \nearners of the economy. The Project will also increase export-oriented growth activities, which will in turn result in \ngreater capital investment, greater employment, and increased employment of those living below the poverty line. \n \nC.

Yes                   No \nAs part of the project preparation, consultations were held with primary and secondary stakeholders including people \nin the project-affected area (men and women), fisherfolk cooperatives, Ministry of Ports and Aviation, and other local \nadministration departments. Issues related to the proposed port development and various activities involved in the \nconstruction and operation of the Project were discussed. The main objective was to ascertain community response to \nthe Project and any negative impacts that the Project needs to mitigate. All those consulted had positive reactions to \nthe Project and welcomed the benefits that development of the port would lead to, such as increased employment \nopportunities for the people living in the project area.   \n \n \nD.

The female labor force participation rate has been increasing, although \nunemployment among women is still higher than for men. In 2002, the labor force participation rate was 50.3%; about \n50% of the labor force belonged to the 20\u201339 years age group. Among the employed, males in the 30\u201339 years age \ngroup and females in the 20\u201324 years age group reported the highest participation in the labor force. The Project will \nprovide educated youth (men and women) equal opportunities to seek short- and long-term employment opportunities \ncreated under the Project. Those men and women supplying labor for quarrying-related activities would typically be \nthose with low literacy rates and low incomes, with a higher proportion being women. Assuming the degree of \nmechanization does not affect the proportion of employees by gender, the Project is expected to provide additional \nemployment opportunities for women. In general, the Project will provide employment opportunities for both men and \nwomen during project construction and operation, and in the quarrying sites. The Project will ensure that employment \nopportunities  and  rates  of  remuneration  are  determined  without  gender-based  discrimination,  according  to  the \nprinciples of equal remuneration for work of equal value.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The work space \nof  employees  will  be  accommodated  in  other  office \nbuildings within the port area, and thus will not involve \nconstruction of a new building. The existing port access \nroad will be used for transport of containers and other \nimported goods. None of the port access roads will be \nwidened  or  improved,  and  thus  will  not  lead  to  any \nresettlement impacts. Even after project construction and \noperation, the transport of containers and other imported \ngoods will take place within the port-related activity zone \nand hence, will not displace any business establishments \nclose  to  the  port.  With  regard  to  specific  effects \nassociated  with  quarries,  the  quarry  location  will  be \nidentified  by  the  contractor  only  during  project \nimplementation prior to the construction of the breakwater. \nThus the Government will have to ensure that if any land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts are associated with \nquarrying of rocks appropriate mitigation measures will be \nformulated and implemented in compliance with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and Policy on  \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n    No affordability issues are foreseen   \n   Significant   Yes \nAffordability     \n Not significant    No \n \n None \n    No  job  losses  will  occur.
