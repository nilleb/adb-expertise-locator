The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance \n(TA) for Strengthening Institutional Capacity of Palau Public Utilities Corporation, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \n2. \nThe program aims to strengthen state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Palau by improving the \ncorporate governance and financial management of Palau\u2019s electricity and water utility company, \nPalau  Public  Utilities  Corporation  (PPUC),  and  providing  an  enabling  environment  for  private \nsector participation in the electricity and water subsectors in Palau. The program will support the \ngovernment\u2019s  long-term  reforms  in  electricity  and  water  and  sanitation.  The  attached  TA  will \nsupport the implementation of ongoing and future energy and water and sanitation reforms and \nstrengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), PPUC, and Palau Energy Administration \n(PEA). \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMacroeconomic context. Palau consists of 340 islands, 10 of which are inhabited, with a \npopulation of about 18,400, almost 80% of whom live in Koror and Airai states. Development grants \nunder  Palau\u2019s  Compact of  Free  Association  with  the  United  States,  expected to  expire  in fiscal \nyear (FY) 2024, contributed substantially to a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $15,068 \nin FY2019. Palau depends heavily on revenues from tourism and services, which contribute almost \n55%  of  annual  GDP  and  employ  three-quarters  of  the  country\u2019s  formal  workforce.  Before  the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic,  Palau  had  maintained  an  annual  fiscal  surplus \naveraging the equivalent of 3.0% of GDP during FY2011\u2013FY2019, extending an impressive period \nof solid fiscal management that has resulted in annual surpluses since FY2011. This was facilitated \nby tax and revenue reforms that resulted in the tax-to-GDP ratio averaging 20.2% during FY2015\u2013\nFY2019, up from a 17.3% average during the preceding decade. Similarly, on the expenditure side, \nPalau has successfully controlled the public sector wage bill, which averaged 14.7% of GDP during \nFY2015\u2013FY2019, down from 17.1% of GDP on average in the decade prior. Public debt, estimated \nat the equivalent of about 32.5% of GDP in FY2019, was considered sustainable.1 \n \n4. \nCoronavirus disease impact. With no tourist arrivals expected for at least 2 years, Palau\u2019s \neconomy is projected to contract by 9.5% in FY2020 and 12.8% in FY2021,2 compared with an \noriginal outlook of a return to growth by FY2021 after two years of decline.3 Estimates suggest that \ntotal tax revenue will decrease by $11 million in FY2020 (4% of GDP) and by $19 million in FY2021 \n(7% of GDP). With the drastic decline in revenues and increased health and social expenditures, \nfiscal  deficits  of  $31.2  million  (12.2%  of  GDP)  in  FY2020  and  $53.4  million  (23.8%  of  GDP)  in \nFY2021 are projected. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to rise from 32.5% in FY2019 to \n66.9% in FY2020 to help meet the projected financing gap. Furthermore, the decline in tourism will \n\n \n\n1  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020.

A sound macro-fiscal policy framework is seen to \nfacilitate a steady reduction in the fiscal deficit and debt burden after COVID-19. An independent \nassessment shows that if tourism and economic recovery can commence by FY2022, Palau can \nrevert to running a small but steadily rising fiscal surplus by FY2024, resulting in a gradual decline \nin the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 46.5% by FY2030.4 This is supported by the latest assessment \nof the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (footnote 1), which concludes that Palau\u2019s public debt will \nrise  in  the  near-term  but  will  remain  sustainable,  with  concessional  lending  from  development \npartners helping to mitigate debt risks. The IMF further notes that a track record of fiscal prudence \nallowed Palau to build buffers ahead of the pandemic. \n\nAchieving  sustainable  economic  growth  is  complex  and  context-specific  in  the  Pacific\n5.\ndeveloping member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). However, the provision of\nmarket-augmented public goods such as electricity, water, and sanitation is a key determinant of\nthe quality of life for communities and, hence, the attractiveness of a country to private investment.\nWith  COVID-19  and  no  tourism  revenues,  Palau  is  experiencing  reduced  demand  for  utility\nservices (electricity, water, and sewage) and lower revenues to sustain its public infrastructure.\n\nSector  context:  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Palau  has  established,  through  ADB\n6.\nassistance,  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  water  and  wastewater  operations  (WWO)  on\ncommercial principles and at full cost recovery.5 About 96% of Palau\u2019s population has access to\npublic water supply systems. The Koror\u2013Airai water supply system services more than 96% of the\npopulation leaving in Koror-Airai. Water supply systems outside of Koror\u2013Airai are in poor condition\nand  service  delivery  standards  are  low.  Frequent  water  outages  have  a  significant  impact  on\nwomen\u2019s time poverty. Palau has a sanitation policy and a sewerage master plan for Koror through\n2035. Priority investments identified in the Koror sewerage master plan are being delivered under\nthe ADB-financed Koror\u2013Airai Sanitation Project.6\n\nEnergy sector. Since 2010, the government has implemented several significant reforms\n7.\nin the energy sector, including (i) signing into law the Palau Energy Act and creating its regulatory\nframework;  (ii)  setting  a  renewable  energy  target  of  45%  by  2025;7 and  (iii)  approving  energy\nefficiency benchmarks and tariff methodology. However, Palau remains highly dependent on fossil\nfuel  (diesel),  which  contributes  to  95%  of  energy  generation  (compared  with  5%  of  renewable\nenergy generation). This has resulted in a high cost of electricity production. Power generation,\ntransmission,  and  distribution  reliability  and  efficiency  are  below  Pacific  benchmarks  and\nundermined  by  aged  assets  and  no  maintenance  and  replacement. 8 Unreliable  power  has  a\ndisproportionate impact on women, who are responsible for most household tasks, and contributes\nto  women\u2019s  time  poverty.  Establishing  a  reliable  and  efficient  grid  with  financially  sustainable\nnetwork  management  will  attract  private  sector  investment  in  renewable  energy  and  improve\nsector performance.\n\n4  Graduate School USA. 2020.

PPUC  was  established  in  1994  as  a  government-\n8. \nowned utility for power generation, transmission, and distribution, and became responsible for the \nprovision of public WWO in 2013.9 Women are underrepresented at PPUC, and the company has \nmade little effort to undertake institutional gender mainstreaming initiatives or proactive actions to \nincrease women\u2019s employment. PEA, acting as the energy regulator, sets PPUC\u2019s tariffs based on \na cost-recovery methodology. In FY2016, PPUC almost achieved its target of full cost recovery for \nenergy and WWO, as total revenue rose to more than 90% of total operating expenses. However, \nin 2017, the Olbiil Era Kelulau10 froze tariffs for electricity and WWO because of political concerns \nabout  perceived  service costs  and  quality.  Subsequently,  PPUC  has  incurred significant  losses \nand has insufficient revenue to cover its basic operations without government support.  \n \n9. \nDeteriorating performance of the Palau Public Utilities Corporation. As Palau\u2019s largest \nSOE, PPUC\u2019s poor financial performance is a major burden on Palau\u2019s economy, imposing high \nrisks to both fiscal and financial sustainability. Since 2014, PPUC, the only SOE that has failed to \noperate commercially, has incurred losses of $21.9 million, or 8% of GDP.11 With operating losses \nof $6.87 million (2.6% of GDP),12 and its largest cash deficit (20% of revenues) in FY2019, PPUC \nmaintained  its  liquidity  by  deferring  all  maintenance  works.  Delayed  metering  and  power  grid \nupgrades have resulted in network losses up to 16%. These issues, combined with inadequate \nfinancial management (poor accounting systems, delayed reporting, and audit), has thrust PPUC \ninto a negative spiral of limited investments, poor efficiency, and debt. \n \n10. \nReliance on government support and widening fiscal risk. More than 85% of Palau\u2019s \npublic debt is owned by SOEs, and PPUC is a single largest borrower, with outstanding debt of \n$21.9  million  (32%  of  SOEs\u2019  total  debt,  or  8%  of  GDP).  With  negative  liquidity,  PPUC  requires \ncontinuous  government  support  to  remain  solvent.  PPUC  is  also  heavily  dependent  on  annual \nsubsidies for operation and maintenance and for replacing capital assets. Since 2013, PPUC has \nreceived more than $20 million (7.5% of GDP) in state subsidies, including operational subsidies \nof  $14.65  million  and  an  equity  injection  of  $5.5  million.13 Without  reforms,  the  government  will \nneed to increase its subsidies to PPUC by at least 80% (equivalent to an additional 8% of GDP) \nover the next 5 years. \n \n11. \nPoor corporate governance and transparency. Initiated in 2015, SOE corporatization is \nincomplete,  with  mixed  results  in  adopting  and  operationalizing  corporate  governance  and \ntransparency norms. The government\u2019s SOE oversight mechanism and transparency framework \nare not yet established, which inhibits timely disclosure of corporate statements by SOE boards \nand reduces performance quality and accountability. The SOE boards, including the PPUC board, \nare mostly focused on basic legal compliance and are rarely held accountable for performance. \nContinuous reliance on subsidies has led to heavy public sector influence on PPUC\u2019s governance, \naffecting the quality of financial disclosure. Lacking corporate board practices, gender diversity, \nand  independent  decision-making,  PPUC  has  failed  to  develop  a  high-performance  culture  in \nsetting revenue and operational targets, resulting in poor creditworthiness. \n \n12. \nLack  of  private  investment  in  renewable  energy,  and  water  and  wastewater \noperations.  PPUC  is  heavily  dependent  on  public  funds,  with  no  access  to  private  capital  for \nenergy or WWO investments. With fuel expenses making up more than 65% of generation costs, \n\n \n9   Utilities Consolidation Act (2013). \n10   Olbiil Era Kelulau, Belau\u2019s National legislative body, is a bi-cameral National Congress made up of the House of \n\nDelegates and the Senate. \n\n11  PPUC Audited Statements, FY2014\u2013FY2018. \n12  PPUC Audited Statements, FY2019 (draft). \n13  From PPUC financial statements, FY2013\u2013FY2018.

The government has prioritized the transition \nto  renewable  energy  by  introducing  long-term  concessions  for  independent  power  producers \n(IPPs). While power purchase agreements (PPAs) are instrumental for hedging IPPs\u2019 operational \nrisks, PPUC\u2019s underperformance and negative liquidity is a key country risk in attracting IPPs. It is \nestimated that the government\u2019s contingent liability associated with PPAs to keep PPUC solvent \ncosts about 1% of GDP annually.14 Furthermore, Palau\u2019s grid has not been augmented and the \nnetwork has not been upgraded, as required to meet its renewable energy target of 45% by 2025. \n\nADB\u2019s  previous  engagement  and  lessons.  Lessons  from  ADB  operations  in  Palau\n13.\nsuggest that (i) it is critical to allocate sufficient TA resources to support reforms given shortages\nand/or high turnover of qualified staff, and (ii) reform programs require more comprehensive (tariff\nand nontariff) dialogue with government stakeholders to ensure that agreed policy reforms can be\nimplemented in a changing political environment (footnote 5). Previous policy-based operations in\nthe  Pacific  also  show  that  (i)  strong  government  ownership  is  critical  to  achieving  results;\n(ii) sustained policy dialogue and coordination with development partners are important to advance\nreforms; and (iii) coordinated TA projects, provided in parallel with budget support programs, are\ncrucial  to  implement  the  reform  agenda. 15  The  program  also  draws  upon  the  lessons  and\nrecommendations  from  a  2018  report  by  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department  on  SOE\nreforms in ADB developing member countries, including lessons related to supporting government\noversight mechanisms for SOEs, SOE board issues, accountability, and governance risks.16\n\nB.\n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition\n\n14.\nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda. Palau\u2019s strategy for development of water and sanitation\nis guided by Palau\u2019s Water Policy (2012) and the Water Policy and Sanitation Master Plan (2011\u2013\n2036).17 Both documents remain relevant. The government adopted a strong reform agenda in the\nutility and energy sectors by (i) prioritizing tariff reforms to introduce market-driven incentives for\nPPUC\u2019s  sustainability,  and  (ii)  leveraging  private  investments  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  renewable\nenergy target of 45% by 2025. 18 An increase in renewable generation is expected to reduce the\noverall  cost  of  electricity  supply,  lowering  customers\u2019  tariff  and  phasing  out  subsidies.  With  the\nadverse  impacts  of  COVID-19,  utility reforms\u2014including  tariffs  and rationalized  subsidies,  good\ngovernance, and financial management\u2014are essential to ensure PPUC\u2019s positive contribution to\nthe economic efficiency, competitiveness, and security of utility services.\n\nThe program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and supports the following operational\n15.\npriorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in\ngender equality; and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.19\n\n16.\nProgram modality. The government has requested a programmatic approach comprising\ntwo  subprograms  to  support  the  PPUC\u2019s  reforms,  consistent  with  national  objectives. 20\nThe programmatic approach allows a longer horizon to effectively implement politically sensitive\nreforms in both energy and WWO. The sequencing of subprograms is intended to prioritize reforms\nunder  subprogram  1  that  will  sustain  PPUC\u2019s  viability,  financed  by  energy  operations,  which\naccount for more than 72% of PPUC\u2019s total revenues and 92% of its liquidity.

Both subprograms will support reforms \nin the following four areas. \n \n17. \nReform area 1: Tariff reforms managed. Energy tariff reforms are essential to improving \nPPUC\u2019s  financial  sustainability.  PEA,  under  the  Ministry  of  Public  Infrastructure,  Industries  and \nCommerce, has approved (i) a new cost-recovery tariff regulation for PPUC\u2019s electricity tariffs, and \n(ii)  guidelines  for  electricity  tariff  petition  by  PPUC.  The  new  regulation  will  enable  PPUC  to \ngenerate  sufficient  revenue  to  cover  its  fixed  and  variable  costs  for  power  infrastructure \ndevelopment and maintenance. The new guidelines for electricity tariff petition include procedures \nfor (i) implementing a subsidy program for poor and low-income households with clear and explicit \ninstructions  on  types  of  subsidies,  households\u2019  eligibility  criteria,  and  procedures  to  apply  for \nallocated  subsidies;  (ii)  launching  an  awareness-raising  campaign  for  poor  and  low-income \nhouseholds on the subsidy program, eligibility criteria, and the process of applying for subsidized \nelectricity  consumption;  and  (iii)  improving  communication  about  the  existing  grievance  redress \nmechanism  for  receiving  and  resolving  complaints  from  customers.  To  comply  with  the  new \nregulations, PPUC has prepared an electricity tariff petition based on a cost recovery method and \nsubmitted it to PEA.21 \n \n18. \nUnder subprogram 2, the government plans to expand PEA\u2019s mandate, enabling it to also \nassume a regulatory function for WWO; approve a new regulation for setting cost-recovery tariffs \nfor WWO; and issue guidelines for WWO tariff petition, including raising awareness of the WWO \nsubsidy program. Approval of the new cost-recovery tariff regulation and of tariff petition guidelines \nwill support the operational sustainability and reliability of WWO. \n \n19. \nReform  area  2:  PPUC\u2019s  financial  management  enhanced.  This  output  will  enhance \nPPUC\u2019s financial management by establishing reporting and disclosure norms based on industry \nstandards. The PPUC board approved PPUC\u2019s accounting policy and procedures, compliant with \nUnited States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, to maintain its financial and accounting \nrecords  comprehensively  and  accurately.  The  new  accounting  policy  and  procedures  will \nstandardize  PPUC\u2019s  accounting  function,  measurement  system,  and  procedures  for  presenting \ndisclosures.  The  PPUC  board  also  approved  the  required  corporate  annual  revenue  model  for \nelectricity  operations  during  2021\u20132023.  This  model  will  support  PPUC\u2019s  financial  projections \nbased on its revenue requirements\u2014i.e., the total amount of revenue required to recover its costs \nof  electricity  supply,  where  such  costs  include  prudent  operation  and  maintenance  costs  and \nreasonable  rates  of  return  on  debt  and  equity  required  to  finance  capital  investments. \nPPUC\u2019s projected revenue requirement is determined by comparing PPUC\u2019s total revenue with its \noperating and capital costs in FY2021 to estimate the ability of existing tariffs to recover its costs. \nThe PPUC board also approved PPUC\u2019s revenue enhancement action plan for 2021. The action \nplan prioritizes two high-value emergency actions to restore PPUC\u2019s sustainability.22 The action \nplan \nleast-cost  power  generation  and  transmission \nenhancement plan for 2021\u20132024, to be approved under subprogram 2 (para. 20). \n \n20. \nUnder subprogram 2, the government will focus on PPUC\u2019s WWO by approving (i) PPUC\u2019s \nannual  revenue  required  model  for WWO,  and  (ii)  PPUC\u2019s  WWO  revenue  enhancement  action \n\nis  aligned  with  PPUC\u2019s \n\nlong-term, \n\n \n\n21   PEA is solely responsible for electricity tariffs in Palau.  \n22  The emergency actions are (i) installation of pre\u2013paid meters, which will improve PPUC\u2019s revenue, cash collection, \nand  liquidity,  reducing  technical  losses;  and  (ii)  replacement  of  the  critical  control  system  at  the  Malakal  Power \nStation, which will avoid the risk of disastrous shut down and contribute to the security and reliability of more than \nhalf of the electricity consumed in Palau. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nplan for 2022. Going forward, PPUC will restore its sustainability and stabilize its investments and \nfinancing according to the long-term, least-cost power generation and transmission enhancement \nplan  for  2021\u20132024,  and  the  Water  Policy  and  Sanitation  Master  Plan,  2011\u20132036. 23 \nSubprogram 2  will  also  induce  professional  management  by  setting  up  a  business  analytics \nframework for PPUC for electricity and WWO. \n\n21.\nReform  area  3:    PPPUC\u2019s  corporate  governance  and  transparency  strengthened.\nTo comply  with  the  Palau  SOE  Policy  (2015),  the  PPUC  board  approved  a  code  of  corporate\ngovernance based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for\nCorporate Governance of SOEs.24 The corporate governance code aims to ensure that PPUC\u2019s\nboard  members  represent  the  interests  of  the  corporation  in  an  independent  manner  and  in\naccordance  with  established  international  corporate  governance  standards. 25  To  comply  with\ntransparency requirements, the PPUC board approved procedures for audit, risk, and compliance\nconsistent with international standards on auditing to establish oversight of (i) financial reporting\nintegrity;  (ii)  the  independence,  qualifications,  and  performance  of  the  corporation\u2019s  external\nindependent auditor and the performance of the internal auditor; (iii) evaluating risks in operations\nand investment decisions; and (iv) compliance with the legal and regulatory framework of Palau.\n\nTo promote gender equality, the PPUC board approved PPUC\u2019s gender strategy for 2020\u2013\n22.\n2023,  consistent  with  the  Palau  National  Gender  Mainstreaming  Policy  (2018).  PPUC  will  take\naffirmative measures provided in this gender strategy to promote and apply the principles of gender\nequality in the workplace as well as in relations with customers. PPUC will support developing a\nskilled and diverse workforce that will contribute to efficient business processes and organizational\nproductivity.  Furthermore,  the  PPUC  board  approved  new  corporate  gender-sensitive  human\nresources  management  procedures,  including  flexible  working  hours,  introduction  of  parental\nleave,  and  protocols  to  protect  against  workplace  harassment  and  discrimination  (including\ngender-based discrimination and sexual harassment). The new human resources procedures will\nensure a supportive workplace environment for all employees irrespective of gender and free from\ndiscrimination and harassment related to gender, race, or age bias.\n\nSubprogram  2  will  support  PPUC\u2019s  strengthened  governance  and  transparency  by  the\n23.\nboard\u2019s  approval  of  (i)  PPUC\u2019s  statement  of  corporate  intent,  performance  reporting  standards,\nand key targets (including on gender diversity); (ii) sustainable debt management procedures; and\n(iii) PPUC\u2019s  board  nomination  and  integrity  procedures  to  enhance  board  independence.\nUnder subprogram 2, the government plans to improve the governance and transparency of SOEs\nthrough the MOF\u2019s adoption of SOE performance monitoring policies and procedures.\n\nReform  area  4:  Market  access  for  private  sector  participation  in  energy  sector\n24.\nimproved.  The  government  has  approved  a  new  regulation  to  promote  the  development  of\nrenewable energy facilities by IPPs, which mandates PEA to (i) set licensing requirements applying\nto IPPs, (ii) review and approve PPAs between PPUC (the off-taker) and IPPs, and (iii) administer\nthe  process  for  soliciting  renewable  energy  from  the  IPPs  through  a  formal  tender  procedure.\nTo comply  with  the  new  regulations,  PEA  approved  the  PPUC\u2019s  capacity  plan,  the  objective  of\nwhich  is  to  confirm  grid  capacity  availability  for  renewable  energy  producers  and  IPPs,  and  to\nestablish measures for expanding power transmission infrastructure.\n\n23  Footnote 16. \n24   OECD.  2015.

ADB has been a major reform partner and has built \na  strong  relationship  with  the  government  in  supporting  PPUC\u2019s  corporate  reforms  and \nimplementing the policy reforms under subprogram 1.27\n The program complements and underpins \nADB\u2019s project loans and assistance in 2021\u20132022 for (i) power grid enhancement,28 (ii) disaster-\nresilient clean energy financing, 29 and (iii) an ongoing IPP transaction in renewable energy.30 \n \n27. \nDevelopment partner coordination. ADB coordinated with the IMF the program design \nand implementation of the policy reforms under subprogram 1. In its 2018 Article IV consultation \nstaff report (footnote 14), the IMF highlighted the need to reform PPUC to contain quasi-fiscal risks \nand  support  long-term  fiscal  sustainability.  IMF\u2019s assessment  letter  confirms  that  the  program \nwould not adversely impact the country\u2019s debt sustainability and would help Palau contain quasi-\nfiscal  risks  and  support  long-term  fiscal  sustainability. 31  Discussions  with  the  IMF  were  also \nconducted to ensure alignment of ADB and IMF assessments regarding Palau\u2019s broader macro-\nfiscal framework and prospects for recovery post-COVD-19. To cope with COVID-19 and finance \npandemic response measures, Palau prioritizes mobilization of concessional financing and grants \nfrom bilateral partners including Japan; Taipei,China; and the United States. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe  program  is  aligned  with  Palau\u2019s  development  objectives:  (i)  SOEs\u2019  sustainability, \nincluding full-cost recovery of business and capital, achieved; and (ii) reliability and resiliency of \nenergy supply improved based on adequate regulatory framework and tariffs.32 Improving PPUC\u2019s \nfinancial performance and sustainability and increasing the reliability of electricity and WWO will \nbring incremental and non-incremental benefits to consumers in Palau. Incremental benefits will \narise from additional consumption of electricity by existing and new customers connected to the \npower grid. Non-incremental benefits will accrue from more affordable and cheaper supply, from \nrenewable generation replacing fossil fuel-based generation, and from reduced use of costly back-\nup power generators. Economic benefits will also accrue from improved WWO, especially among \nmore  remote  populations.  The  program  will  contribute  to  budgetary  headroom  estimated  at \n$68.9 million (23.5% of GDP) over 10 years, enabling the government to invest in critical areas \nwith significant and positive impacts on economic growth and employment.33 \n \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\nPhase IV.

In July \n2020, ADB approved a $20 million concessional loan under its COVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption modality, which, along with the disbursement of $15 million in contingent disaster financing, \nassisted  Palau  in  fully  meeting  its  development  financing  needs  for  FY2020. 35 The proposed \nprogram is prioritized by the government as a key reform program, with the first subprogram of \n$5.0 million filling about 9.4% of the $53.4 million gross financing requirement for FY2021.36 The \ngovernment  has  engaged  in  initial  discussions  with  the  World  Bank  and  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation as potential financiers of budget support in FY2021 to mitigate adverse \nsocial impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Cofinancing would also prevent the government \nfrom drawing on its general fund deposit, which totals $31.2 million and which it needs to maintain \nan adequate fiscal buffer to enable immediate response to future disasters, to which Palau is highly \nvulnerable. \n \n30. \nTo  support  Palau\u2019s  increasing  development financing  needs  and  help  meet  the  costs  of \nimplementing reforms, the government has requested a loan of $5 million from ADB\u2019s concessional \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The indicative \nloan amount for subprogram 2 is $5 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital resources. \nAlthough the loan will inevitably lift the public debt ratio, it will not undermine its downward trend in \nthe medium term. The loan will not add significantly to the annual debt service obligations facing \nthe government. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nThe  MOF  is  the  program\u2019s  executing  agency  and  responsible  for  overall  program \nmonitoring and reporting. PPUC and PEA will be the implementing agencies. A program steering \ncommittee  chaired  by  the  minister  of  finance  and  comprising  senior  officials  from  PEA  and  the \nPPUC  board  will  meet  quarterly \nreforms. \nThe implementation  period  is  May  2020\u2013October  2020  for  subprogram  1  and  February  2021\u2013\nFebruary  2022  for  subprogram  2.  All  subprogram  1  policy  actions  have  been  accomplished. \nThe TA will prepare subprogram 2 and provide requisite analytical support to implement the policy \nactions. The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nreview  progress \n\nimplementing \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nin \n\nIII. \n\nATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n32. \nThe attached TA will support (i) WWO tariff and regulatory reforms, (ii) PPUC\u2019s financial \nmanagement  and  governance,  (iii)  public\u2013private  partnership  transparency  and  disclosure, \n(iv) gender and social safeguards, and (v) workshops and trainings. \n \n\n \n\n34  The gross financing requirement (without grants) is projected at $99.3 million, compared with $37.3 million before \n\n35  ADB.  2020.

The implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned with those of the \nPBL.  A  total  of  50  person-months  of  consultancy  services  (international  and  national)  will  be \nrequired  intermittently.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  following  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n34. \nSafeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), this program \nis  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. 38 \nInvestment activities prohibited under ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement will be excluded. \n \n35. \nPoverty and social. Access to modern, reliable, and affordable energy services under the \nprogram will have direct and indirect impacts on poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth. \nPalau  is  almost  100%  electrified,  but  utility  services  (electricity  and  water)  are  unreliable, \nwith unscheduled  interruptions  occurring  regularly.  The  country  has  one  of  the  highest  energy \npoverty  rates  in  the  Pacific.39 Policy  reforms  undertaken  by  the  government  for  subprogram  1 \ninclude  cost-recovery  tariff  regulations  and  electricity  tariff  petition  guidelines  that  provide  for \nimproved access to the lifeline tariff subsidy program for poor and vulnerable consumers.40  \n \n36. \nGender.  The  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Proactive  gender \nmeasures  under  the  program  include  a  set  of  policy  actions  approved  by  the  PPUC  board \n(para. 22).  COVID-19  is  exacerbating  the  existing  gender  wage  gap  for  women,  particularly  for \nhouseholds headed by women (34% of total Palauan households), which have a gender income \ngap of 18% compared with households headed by men. Given the increased economic challenges \nthat women and households headed by women are facing, a clear and fit-for-purpose electricity \nsubsidy  program  for  poor  and  low-income  households  will  better  target  those  most  in  need. \nThe awareness-raising  campaign  on  the  subsidy  program,  eligibility  requirements,  and  the \napplication process (para. 17) will improve women\u2019s access to subsidies (as many women from \npoor or low-income households may not be aware of the program or eligibility criteria).  \n \n37. \nGovernance. Palau has made considerable progress in improving the legal and regulatory \nframework for public financial management, with transparent accounting, budgeting, and auditing \nsystems in place. The public budget documents present the basic and supplementary information \nrequired  to  support  transparency  of  funds  flow.  The  financial  statements  of  all  SOEs,  including \nPPUC, are compliant with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles reporting standards and have \nbeen  audited  since  2010.  To  strengthen  PPUC\u2019s  fiscal  risk  management,  the  government \nmandated  PEA  to  monitor  PPA  terms  and  conditions  consistent  with  PPUC  offtake  capacity. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the table and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.41 \n \n\n \n\n37  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38  ADB.
